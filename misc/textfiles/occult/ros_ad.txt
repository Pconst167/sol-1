                                  FOREWARD

   Of the thirty years devoted by the undersigned to research and the  study
of astrology and astro-daignosis,  a large part was spent with Max  Heindel,
first as co-student and companion and later as his wife.   A portion of  the
astro-diagnosis  in  this  book have been taken from  Mr.  Heindel's  former
monthly  lessons to esoteric students,  and this fact together with our  as-
sociation  in astrological research in the reason why this volume  goes  out
under both our names, even though he passed into the larger life in 1919.

   This book may differ in a few instances from other books which deal  with
the science of diagnosis from the planets.  The authors of this volume, how-
ever,  have had opportunities such as few other writers on this subject have
had.   The Rosicrucian Fellowship,  of which they were the founders,  has  a
very  successful healing department.   A description of the method  used  in
this department may be found on page 440.   Of the thousands of patients who
have  written to us for healing since the department started,  each one  has
sent in data describing the disease from which he suffered, its symptoms and
peculiarities,  the doctor's diagnosis,  etc.  This information was in every
case carefully compared with the patient's horoscope, and a  detailed  study


[PAGE 4]                                  ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

made  of  both.   The most striking as well as typical cases  were  used  as
monthly  lessons  for the esoteric students of the Fellowship.   From  these
lessons we have chosen the best to print in this book.   At no time have  we
diagnosed direct to the patient.   His horoscope,  however,  has given us  a
wonderful key to the disease from which he was suffering and its causes, and
it has been used as a guide in giving advice regarding diet, exercise, envi-
ronment, and similar matters.

   We  do not claim that this book is the last word on the subject,  neither
do  we claim that it is infallible.  The knowledge which we have  gained  by
years of unceasing labor we are sharing with the world.   We give it freely,
and if others can add to it, we shall rejoice.

                                INTRODUCTION

   Astro-diagnosis is the science and art of obtaining scientific  knowledge
regarding  disease and its causes as shown by the planets,  as well  as  the
means of overcoming it.  This new science of diagnosis and healing is slowly
permeating the medical world.   It is a science which will not set aside the
old  school  of medicine and diagnosis,  but it is an addition  to  the  old
school   The latter,  we feel,  will in time accept this newer  method.   At
present  many physicians are willing to cooperate with the newer schools  of
osteopathy,  nature-cure,  chiropractic, etc., and these open-minded men are
ready to accept a more advanced method of diagnosis when it has been  demon-
strated to them as reliable.

   Depending entirely upon outward symptoms in locating disease and  relying
wholly  upon the action of medicine have cost millions of lives in the  ages
past.   But man is now becoming too enlightened,  too broadminded  to  stick
stubbornly  to old methods which have been proved by many mistakes,  by  the
sacrifice  of many lives,  to be inadequate.   Medical science with its  im-
proved instruments,  the X-ray, iri-diagnosis, blood tests,  etc.,  has made
great strides toward better methods of diagnosis.   But the time is not  far
hence when it will be generally conceded that to know in advance where human


[PAGE 6]                                  ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

chain is weakest,  to understand by the science of the stars where the prac-
titioner may look for trouble,  is by far the best way.   Doctors will  then
arrive  very quickly at the cause of disease,  and they will also know  what
methods  will  be best to effect a cure.  When they can use the key  to  the
soul,  the horoscope, they will find the treatment to which the patient will
respond.  They will also know the character of the patient, whether his will
is weak,  and whether he is negative or emotional.  They will then be guided
in their methods of treatment according to the information thus obtained.

   Disease  may be classed under two heads,  latent and active.   "Symptoms"
give  indication  of disease which is in process of  materializing.   Latent
tendencies  to disease are shown by the planetary afflictions in  the  horo-
scope of birth.  In some instances these tendencies may remain latent during
the entire life because the native has lived in such a manner that no strain
was  put on the body which would give the planets a chance to develop  their
latent  weakness.   If there is a weak link in a chain but no strain is  put
upon it,  the chain will remain whole.  So in the case of planetary  afflic-
tions, they too may remain latent.  But let the native abuse his body and at
once these weak spots will appear.   This gives us the second class of  dis-
ease,  the active type.   When the planetary aspects have been stirred  into
action and disease has appeared, the progressed planetary positions give the
diagnostician the key to it.

   When the medical  men,  the  scientists,  the  occult scientists, and the


[PAGE 7]                                  ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

astrologers have reached a friendly understanding,  when the budding discov-
eries  and the broader thoughts of man are no longer at variance  with  each
other,  then humanity will know that the terrors and the pain of the operat-
ing  room are things of the past.   Then buoyant health will be  universally
enjoyed, for mankind will be taught how to live in order to avoid suffering.
The  doctors will be just as anxious to keep people well as they now are  to
help them to recover from disease.   The time is not far hence,  we believe,
when the government will feel the necessity of paying doctors a yearly  sal-
ary to teach the people how to avoid the pitfalls which lead to disease.

                                  CHAPTER I

                 THE ANATOMICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
                                OF THE SIGNS

                                    ARIES

   When Aries,  which has rule over the head, is on the Ascendant, we have a
person  whose  actions are impulsive and aggressive.   He  acts  and  speaks
quickly.  An excess of life force is generated by these people.  This is in-
tensified when the dynamic Mars, which is the ruler of Aries, is also in Ar-
ies  on  the Ascendant,  or when the life-giving sun is there.   When  these
planets add their vital energies to the Ascendant,  we have a person who  is
very  apt to dissipate his forces.  people who express Aries  very  strongly
are apt to be quick of temper of an explosive kind, but will not hold spite.
Those with Aries on the Ascendant, or with the sun or Mars there,  are quick
to anger but also ready to forgive.

   Aries rules the head,  the cerebral hemispheres of the brain,  the  upper
jaw,  the eyes,  and the face.  The nose,  however,  is ruled by the martial
sign of Scorpio.


[PAGE 16]                                                    ASTRO DIAGNOSIS

    Aries is hot, dry, and inflammatory.  Aries people with a slight cold or
disturbance  of health may have a very high temperature.   In illness  their
fever will often be from three to four degrees higher than that of the  per-
sons born uder the watery of airy signs.   Under planetary afflictions these
people are subject to brain fever, dizziness, nosebleed, neuralgia,  inflam-
mation  of  the cerebral hemispheres,  and diseases of the brain  and  face.
They frequently suffer from a rush of blood to the head.

   The  will  of the patient plays a great part in the success  of  healing.
People under positive signs are most likely to respond,  for they make  per-
sonal  effort  to help the healer, while negative-sign people are  prone  to
follow  the line of least resistance and to be neglectful in  following  the
instructions of the healer.

                                   TAURUS

   Taurus has rule over the region of the neck,  the ears,  palate,  larynx,
tonsils, thyroid gland, lower jaw, occipital region, cerebellum, atlas,  and
cervical vertebrae,  vocal chords, carotid arteries,  jugular vein,  and the
pharynx.

   The  Taurian  is very stubborn and tenacious.   Taurus being  a  negative
sign, when a Taurian contracts a disease, he holds on to it tenaciously.  He
has great fear of sickness, and on account of this fear he makes a poor doc-
tor or nurse, whereas the Arian, being under Aires which is a positive sign,
will go into a sick room without fear and quickly throw off the disease.  If


[PAGE 17]                                            PROPERTIES OF THE SIGNS

you have a patient who has Taurus rising or the sun in Taurus, never let him
think he is much ill,  for his fear of sickness will often bring on a  spell
of it.   The Taurian has a tendency to take on flesh in middle life.   Being
short and thickest as a rule, he becomes very fleshy about the neck and base
of the skull.   This has a tendency to cause the swelling of glands, tonsil-
litis, quinsy, and various diseases of the organs of the neck; also polypi.

                                   GEMINI

   Gemini has rule over the arms, hands, shoulders, lungs, thymus gland, up-
per ribs,  trachea,  bronchi,  capillaries, breath,  and oxygenation of  the
blood.

   The  Gemini person is subject to nervous troubles.   Gemini being one  of
the common signs, a person born with this sign rising is often very careless
of  his health and habits,  and on this account we find more tubercular  pa-
tients among Gemini people than among people of any one of the other  eleven
signs.   Gemini being classed among the positive signs,  the  Gemini  person
can,  if he is given the least bit of help, often throw off a disease.   The
diseases to which Gemini is most subject are pulmonary troubles, bronchitis,
asthma, pneumonia, consumption, pleurisy, and nervous disorders.

                                   CANCER

   When  we  have  a horoscope to diagnose for one who has  the  watery  and
negative Cancer rising, we may look for one who is low in vitality; one  who


[PAGE 18]                                                    ASTRO DIAGNOSIS

is very timid yet loath to follow the advice of others.   Cancer people  are
apt  to  do the opposite from that which they are advised to do.   They  are
also full of suspicion,  and on account of lack of faith in others they  are
difficult to reach; but when their faith has once been established, they are
most loyal and ready to cooperate.  A little praise or appreciation will of-
ten win them over.   They are unduly sensitive,  and when hurt do not forget
it readily.  When the sun is in this watery sign, the native has more vital-
ity than when it is rising, for the sun is the giver of life and energy.

   Cancer has rule over the stomach, diaphragm,  the mammae,  upper lobes of
the liver,  thoracic duct, eumification, peristalsis, the pancreas,  gastric
vein, and the serum of the blood.

   The  afflictions which may be classed under the sign of Cancer are  indi-
gestion,  hiccough,  flatulency,  dropsy, and sclerosis.   Cancer people are
very fond of food and are usually hearty eaters.   Consequently they are of-
ten afflicted with diseases which originate in wrong diet;  especially do we
find this so with the people have Saturn in Cancer.   This planet has a  re-
stricting influence,  and wherever he is found he robs the corresponding or-
gan of its fluids.  When in Cancer he gives a desire for pastry and sweets.

                                     LEO

   When  we have to deal with a patient with Leo on the Ascendant,  we  have
one with great vital energy, one who will  not  readily  succumb to disease.


[PAGE 19]                                            PROPERTIES OF THE SIGNS

The Leo usually puts up a brave fight to overcome without calling upon  oth-
ers for help,  but when he gives up,  he is usually very sick;  he  recovers
rapidly from illness,  however.   His pride will not permit him as a rule to
become a charge upon others.  Being a positive sign the greatest handicap to
the Leo is impulse.  He feels he must do everything with a very great amount
of energy, which is detrimental to the health of the parts of the body ruled
by  this vital sign:   the heart,  aorta,  vena cava,  dorsal region of  the
spine, and the spinal cord.

   The  sun,  which is the life giver,  rules this sign of Leo and also  has
rule  over the vital etheric fluid coming through the spleen,  which is  the
gateway of the solar forces.   Through the spleen the sign of Leo draws  its
strength largely.   We find those born with this sign rising very vital  and
full of force,  especially if the sun is also in Leo; but by the destructive
use  of their surplus energy they are often afflicted with heart trouble  of
various  kinds,  also spinal troubles.  They suffer frequently with  distur-
bance of the spleen,  which has an effect upon the activities of the  blood,
causing  an excess of white blood corpuscles,  which are destroyers and  not
policemen of the blood stream as medical science claims.


                                    VIRGO

   Virgo is a feminine and negative sign,  the second of the earthy triplic-
ity, and has less power of resistance that the fixed sign of Leo.  Virgo may
stand considerable strain, however, being of a nervous and wiry temperament;


[PAGE 20]                                                    ASTRO DIAGNOSIS

still when the Virgoan gives up, he finds it very hard to rise and shake off
an illness.   Being of a negative disposition he is apt to let circumstances
rule  him,  and does not assert his will power to overcome.   Virgo  is  the
natural sixth house sign, the house which has rule over sickness; hence when
Virgo people once get into the clutches of sickness,  they are apt to become
chronic invalids.  Therefore though such people make excellent nurses,  they
should be advised against this vocation and avoid sick rooms and  hospitals,
for  they are like sponges and every ready to take on the disease  of  their
patients.

   Virgo  rules the abdominal region,  intestines,  the lower lobes  of  the
liver, the spleen, the duodenum, and the sympathetic nervous system.

   The  afflictions which may be classed under the sign of Virgo are  deter-
mined largely by the planets which may be afflicted in this sign.  Cramps in
the intestines, wind, colic, malnutrition, diarrhea, constipation, peritoni-
tis,  cholera, dysentery, worms, catarrh of the bowels, and appendicitis may
result from afflictions in Virgo.

                                    LIBRA

   Libra is one of the signs wherein the sun is weak.  The sun is symbolized
by  Sampson,  who is minus his strength,  for Delilah,  who is the  feminine
Virgo,  has shorn him of his power, which was in his hair,  representing the
sun's  rays.  As  the  sun  enters  Libra, it  changes  from  north to south


[PAGE 21]                                            PROPERTIES OF THE SIGNS

declination; and as Libra is the sign of Saturn's exaltation, the sun's rays
at this point,  the crossing of the equator,  are weakest.   Libra people on
this  account are not always able to rise above physical conditions.   Their
moods waver like the symbol which represents the sign,  the scales.   At one
time Librans are up in the seventh heaven of happiness and optimism,  but at
the  least mental disturbance they may drop to the very bottom of  pessimism
and despair.   Idealism is well developed in the Libran.  The Libran patient
should,  if possible,  never be discouraged in whatever he has set his heart
upon doing, for shatter his ideals and down goes one side of the scales into
the very deepest discouragement, which often causes ill health.   The Libran
should cultivate equilibrium.

   Physiologically  this sign rules the kidneys,  the lumbar region  of  the
spine,  the skin,  the ureters, which are the tiny ducts running between the
kidneys and the bladder,  and the vaso-motor system.   The afflictions  from
with  the  Libran is most likely to suffer are Brights's  disease,  lumbago,
disturbed urine.   The disease depends greatly upon the planets  afflicting:
if  Saturn,  there  is a scarcity of urine;  if  Jupiter,  an  excess,  etc.
Nephritis,  eczema,  and diabetes are also diseases from which the Libran is
likely to suffer.

                                   SCORPIO

   The martial,  watery sign of Scorpio is one of the least understood signs
of  the  entire  twelve.  Scorpio  produces  a number of types.  Usually the


[PAGE 22]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

Scorpio person is of a secretive, timid,  retiring nature,  one who does not
talk of his affairs.   But there is another type of Scorpio who is ready  to
argue at "the drop of the hat," holding our for his point, and he can become
very cruel.  He usually has an explosive temper, which may, if the horoscope
has afflictions, undermine the health.  The greatest danger to the health of
the Scorpio, however, comes from the generative organs and the ducts through
which the excretions of the body pass, such as the urethra (the small  canal
through  which  the urine passes from the bladder outward)  and  the  colon,
including the anus.

   The bladder,  the sigmoid flexure,  prostate gland,  pubic bone,  the red
coloring matter of the blood, and the nasal bones are also under the rule of
Scorpio.

   People  born under this sign make good healers,  surgeons,  doctors,  and
nurses.   But there is often a cruel and tyrannical streak in  the  Scorpio,
and the desire nature is strong, sometimes sensual.  Low desires often bring
excesses,  which may cause the following diseases, expressing themselves ac-
cording  to  the  planets and the  afflicting  aspects:   syphilis,  hernia,
scurvy,  fistula,  piles,  inflammation and falling  of  the  womb,  uterine
troubles, stricture of the prostrate gland, and nasal catarrh.

                                 SAGITTARIUS

   The  Sagittarian is usually the most gentle and easily cured of  all  pa-
tients, for with his frank and kindly nature  he  is  most trusting and ever


[PAGE 23]                                            PROPERTIES OF THE SIGNS

ready to follow all the instructions of the healer; but he will also respond
to every negative suggestion.  The healer may have given constructive advice
and left the patient feeling encouraged,  but should one of his many friends
(for  the Sagittarian is usually very popular and good mixer  and  therefore
attracts many friends to him) suggest sickness or tell him that he is  look-
ing bad or give him some other remedy to follow he is very apt to accept the
suggestion.  The result is that he often retards his recovery.  Therefore it
is  necessary  for the Sagittarian patient to be placed under  the  care  of
someone who will protect him from adverse suggestions.

   Sagittarius  rules the region of the body directly surrounding the  hips,
the  sacral  region of the spine, the coccygeal vertebrae,  the  femur,  the
ilium, the iliac arteries, the sciatic nerves, and the ischium.

   The Sagittarian diseases are locomotor ataxia, sciatica, rheumatism,  and
hip disease.

                                  CAPRICORN

   The  sign of Capricorn is an earthy sign and ruled by the planet  Saturn.
Capricorn people do not yield to disease very readily.   They are of a wiry,
persistent, and stolid nature, and will suffer considerable pain before they
will succumb to illness.   But once they have given in to sickness then they
are  just as slow and stubborn in holding on to it.   They sometimes  become
hypochondriacs,  and the healer must use most diplomatic methods to break up
the crystallized condition with which these Saturnian  people  clothe  them-


[PAGE 24]                                                    ASTRO DIAGNOSIS

selves.   The most unfortunate part of it is that if a Capricorn who  is  in
this  mental and physical state is aware that anyone is endeavoring to  help
him, he will resist help and close up against the friend who thus approaches
him.   Capricorn  people ae super-sensitive and very retiring.   They  often
form habits of entertaining gloom and despondency,  which have a deteriorat-
ing effect upon the health.

   The sign of Capricorn has rule over the knees, the skin, the joints,  and
the hair.  The skin of a Capricorn person is often sallow and dry.

   The disease to which Capricorn is subject are exzema, syphilis,  leprosy;
also dislocation of the bones.


                                  AQUARIUS

   The fixed and airy sign of Aquarius is under the rule of two planets, the
melancholy,  fearful, and overanxious Saturn, which is ordinarily termed the
planet of obstruction,  and the impulsive,  heedless,  emotional,  and  hys-
terical Uranus.  While Aquarius is a fixed sign which endows the native with
a strong will,  still when the Aquarian is afflicted by adverse aspects  be-
tween  certain planets,  especially Saturn or Uranus when they are  strongly
placed  in the horoscope,  he is prone to develop extreme gloom,  pessimism,
and  sensitiveness,  or  he is rash and responds to  the  emotional  Uranus.
These varying moods frequently result in ill health,  which too often  takes
the form of nervousness.  Aquarius being a mental and airy sign, its natives


[PAGE 25]                                            PROPERTIES OF THE SIGNS

are  wiry and ambitious,  and are prone to overdo.   They can never  measure
their strength until the body is strained to its very limit,  therefore when
they do give up they are usually in a critical state; but they will give the
healer every opportunity to help them, for they are ever ready to cooperate.

   Physiologically the sign of Aquarius rules the lower limbs and ankles.

   The diseases with which the Aquarian may be afflicted are varicose veins,
swelling of the legs, and nervous diseases of various kinds.  One indication
that  the Aquarian has when the nerves begin to get weak is  extreme  sensi-
tiveness of the skin.  There is a crawling sensation felt all over the body,
as if little insects were crawling on the skin.

                                   PISCES

   Pisces is a watery and common sign, and the people born under it are of a
lymphatic  and negative nature very fond of luxuries,  which too often  lead
them to seek a life of ease;  in later life they are prone to take on an ex-
cess of soft,  flabby flesh,  which leads to ill health.   The Pisces people
respond very readily to suggestions, whether they are good or evil, and they
will  also respond just as quickly to the influence of the healer.   Do  not
allow  anyone who is of a too sympathetic nature to visit the Piscean  while
he is ill.   Of the oversympathetic type there are too many in the world to-
day,  who  think  it  a  social  duty  to  call  upon every sick friends and


[PAGE 26]                                                    ASTRO DIAGNOSIS

encourage the ailing one to talk about his disease,  and then extend to him,
oh, so much sympathy!  The Piscean person will enjoy the visit of the sympa-
thizer,  but  when the latter has gone, he usually has a  relapse  and  must
quickly send for the doctor or healer.  He should be placed in a very cheer-
ful room, with a cheerful attendant, and a sign on the door, "No sympathetic
visitors allowed."

   The Piscean is prone to drift into the habit of drink and the use of nar-
cotics,  especially if we find an affliction of the moon and Neptune in  the
horoscope.

   Pisces rules the feet, the toes, and the fibrin of the blood.  On account
of their fondness for good food and an easy life Piscean people are  subject
to gout and the swelling of the feet.

                           SYMPATHY AND ANTIPATHY

   Pythagoras taught that the solar system is one mighty musical instrument,
that the twelve signs of the zodiac may be compared to the semitones of  the
chromatic scale, and that the planets constitute the seven white keys of the
cosmic key board.   Each sign responds to a certain tone;  some tones  blend
and are harmonious,  while others clash.  As we find disharmony and conflict
between  certain notes of a piano and between certain strings of a harp,  so
do we find similar inharmony between various signs of the zodiac and various
planets in their effect on man.

   The symbol of the trine is the triangle.   In astrology the trine is con-
sidered harmonious and benefic.   Then we have the signs which represent the
four elements, forming the fiery, earthy, airy, and watery triangles.

   The fiery and airy signs are in harmony with each other,  and  the earthy


[PAGE 34]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

and watery triplicities are friendly; but the fiery and watery will not har-
monize,  neither  will  the earthy and the fiery signs.   Planets  in  these
various  groups of signs will express the same sympathy or antipathy as  the
signs themselves.   The sign triplicities express themselves through harmony
in the temperaments and personalities of people,  while the squares  express
their afflictions through physical discomforts.

   Disease is really a lack of harmony between the spirit and the  personal-
ity,  a conflict between the lower and the higher man.   The trines or  tri-
plicities  act  as  peacemakers,  while the squares  and  oppositions  place
limitations upon the spirit.  The latter pair bring the lessons which are to
be  learned.   They exact payment of the debts of destiny from a person  for
the mistakes made and the selfishness expressed in past lives.   The squares
and oppositions are most vital in their action.  The squares operate through
three groups of signs which constitute--

[PAGE 35]                                             SYMPATHY AND ANTIPATHY

   Doctors have for years been studying the strange sympathy between differ-
ent  parts of the body which they have found manifested in the  diseases  of
various patients.   When they find a disease in one organ,  they are in  the
habit  of looking for the cause in another organ which is in  sympathy  with
the first.   For instance,  in glaucoma or certain kinds of eye trouble they
have invariably found that the real cause or seat of the trouble was in  the
stomach or the kidneys.   In certain types of throat trouble and in goitre a
weakened heart has frequently been found to be the cause.

   The  four  points  of the circle of the cardinal  or  equinoctial  signs,
namely, Aries the eyes, Libra the kidneys, Cancer the stomach, and Capricorn
the knees, are closely in sympathy with one another, and trouble in one will
frequently manifest in one of the other signs of this circle.  For instance,
if we find Saturn in the sign of its fall, Cancer, and afflicted,  digestive
troubles ensue and invariably the kidneys will be disturbed; sometimes stiff
knee joints are the result.   Eye troubles are frequently developed as a re-
sult of wrong eating.   People with Saturn in Cancer are extremists in their
selection of food.  They have strange likes and dislikes.

   The second vicious circle is that of the fixed signs:  Taurus the throat;
Scorpio the generative organs, rectum, urethra, and nose;  Leo the heart and
spine;  Aquarius the legs, below the knees.  When the organs of voice or the
tonsils are operated upon in childhood there will be disturbances at puberty
and later troubles in childbirth.  Great  sympathy  is found between the sex

organs  and the organs of speech.   The removal of parts of the  sex  organs
causes  change of voice,  the male voice becoming feminine,  and the  female
voice  masculine.   Valvular heart trouble often causes the swelling of  the
ankles.

   The  third  group of squares we find composed of the  common  or  mutable
signs,  corresponding to the cadent houses.  The 6th house,  which is corre-
lated to Virgo, and the 12th house, correlated to Pisces, are especially vi-
tal  in the horoscope,  for they are respectively the house of sickness  and
the  house  of confinement and hospitals.   We find great  sympathy  between
these two signs and houses.   Common signs are the most productive of  sick-
ness,  and more hopeless invalids are found among common-sign people than in
any other group for the reason that their will power is not overly strong.

   Two  common  signs  are ruled by Mercury,  which has  dominion  over  the
breath,  nerves,  and sense perception;  and one by Jupiter,  which has rule
over  the  fibrin  of the blood, the arterial circulation,  and  the  liver.
Gemini  rules  the lungs,  and through these organs the blood  is  oxidized.
Virgo has rule over the intestines, sympathetic nervous system,  and spleen.
How  often  we hear the remark,  "I caught cold (or pneumonia)  due  to  wet
feet,"  involving Gemini and Pisces.   Many more examples could be cited  of
the action of the vicious circles.

                                 CHAPTER IV

                         THE SCIENCE OF RIGHT LIVING


   In  the previous chapters we studied the properties of the signs  of  the
zodiac,  and had the anatomical groupings so arranged as to make it easy for
the student of astro-diagnosis to study them.   It is very necessary that he
become  familiar  with the basic properties of the signs as well as  of  the
planets.   It is impossible to make any headway in the art of  diagnosing  a
chart  unless the student has considerable knowledge of the zodiac  and  the
properties  of the signs and planets.   He should also  familiarize  himself
with the science of progression.  All these different phases he will have to
make use of before he can become proficient in diagnosis so that he may tell
what certain positions, aspects, and planets indicate.  It is essential that
he understand the temperament and character of the patient before he can re-
ally be sure of his diagnosis of disease.

   To find the key to a disease and the reason why a man or woman has become
an invalid, whether the disease is organic, and whether the patient has bro-
ken the laws of nature, is just as necessary as the  diagnosis  itself. What


[PAGE 38]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

is  the good of knowing what kind of a disease is shown in the horoscope  if
you  cannot show the patient where he is breaking the laws of nature?   Dis-
ease  in ninety-five cases out of every hundred is due to wrong  methods  of
living,  and to be able to point these out to the patient leads to the cure.
First, you must remove the cause, and then the cure will follow as a natural
result.

   The secret of the success of the progressive doctor lies in the fact that
he will never,  if he can possibly avoid it, diagnose the disease to his pa-
tient directly.   He will only give advice and prescribe,  and sometimes  he
may give a hint regarding the cause of disease; he will also give directions
as  to food and methods of living, and tell why the patient  should  discon-
tinue  certain habits.   From this diplomatic handling of the patient  comes
the doctor's greatest success.   He will never express a discouraging  word.
He  never robs the patient of his hope, and when he leaves the home  of  the
patient, he leaves with a smile and an encouraging word.

   There are exceptions, however, for there are doctors, and they are not in
the  minority by any means,  who are posing under the name of physician  but
who  will predict death or the necessity of operations of various kinds  be-
fore  they have really and truly diagnosed the disease.   Under the care  of
such  a physician the poor patient is frequently doomed,  for the  one  from
whom he has expected relief has really robbed him of hope.  So  we  want  to


[PAGE 39]                                        THE SCIENCE OF RIGHT LIVING

impress  it  very strongly upon our students that NEVER at any  time  should
they  predict  death;  also never at any time tell the patient that  he  has
heart  trouble,  that he is in danger of insanity,  or that he is  afflicted
with  the dread disease of tuberculosis; from such statements he  would  get
the thought of fear.   Fear is usually worse in its effect upon the mind  of
the negative one than the disease itself.  Ninety patients out of every hun-
dred are ill because of wrong and dangerous methods of eating,  ill  because
of fear, or ill because of the lack of will power to resist temptations;  in
fact, all disease is the result of ignorant violation of the laws of nature.
This  may not have occurred in this life alone.   It may have  been  brought
over from a life previous, and thus the patient has latent weaknesses.

   So we may realize that to be of real help in the healing of the sick  the
healer  or  the diagnostician must have sufficient knowledge to be  able  to
give  the  suffering one instruction in right living.   Our  advice  to  the
reader  would be to study carefully and memorize if possible the lessons  in
astro-diagnosis  which have just preceded; also to familiarize himself  with
the properties of the various foods and their combinations,  for you may ex-
pect  if you tell a patient to change his diet that he will ask you what  he
should eat.  One may see from all these considerations how very necessary it
is to get a sane and safe knowledge of the science of right living.

                                  CHAPTER V

                                THE MENTALITY

   Our  first thought when judging the mental qualities of a patient  is  to
find  the position of Mercury.   First note the sign in which it is  placed,
then the house,  and thirdly the aspects which this planet of reason is mak-
ing.

   To  save time and space in these lessons we will not give the effects  of
Mercury in the different signs of the zodiac,  but will refer the reader  to
THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS,  pages 201 to 207, also pages 549,  550,  where he
will find the basic qualities of Mercury in the twelve signs.   These should
be studied very carefully,  and this study will give a foundation upon which
to base the judgment.

   The next planet to consider is the moon.   If there is a good aspect  be-
tween the moon and Mercury,  especially if these two planets are well placed
in  the angles and in signs in which they can express their best  qualities,
we  may  expect the patient will be able to cooperate with the  healer.   If
Mercury,  however,  is conjunct Saturn,  we find a mind which  is  stubborn,
slow,  and  subject  to  melancholia.  When  Mercury  is trine or sextile to


[PAGE 41]                                                      THE MENTALITY

Saturn, a well balanced mind with good reasoning qualities will develop, and
a  retentive memory is shown.   When Mars or Uranus is in  conjunction  with
Mercury,  the  patient is of a high-strung,  emotional,  erratic  type  with
little control over the mind;  but should Mars or Uranus be sextile or trine
to Mercury, it will have a tendency to quicken the mental faculties,  giving
impulse.   If we find Mercury or the moon afflicted by Neptune,  the mind is
inclined toward unhealthy and unnatural conditions, obsession, religious ma-
nia, mediumship, drink, or drugs.  Observe the house and sign in which these
planets are placed to find how they tend to express themselves.  Neptune be-
ing the higher octave of Mercury,  this planet has a strong influence on the
higher mind.   Neptune when afflicted by Uranus or the moon gives tendencies
towards  undesirable experiences in psychism.  When Neptune is afflicted  by
Mars,  especially when it is in conjunction with this fiery planet,  the na-
tive  is often tempted to use hypnotism or black magic upon others,  and  is
himself  prone  to become the victim of those who unscrupulously  use  these
dreadful practices on others.

   When  the mental afflictions are in the eighth or the twelfth house  they
have  a  more subtle influence than elsewhere.   Afflictions in  the  eighth
house  may give the mind suicidal tendencies,  but if in the  twelfth  house
being the house of self-undoing, hospitals, prisons and insane asylums, they
may cause confinement in some institution.


[PAGE 42]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

   We  wish  to impress it very firmly upon the mind of the  reader,  never,
never at any time to base a diagnosis on only one or two aspects, but always
upon the entire horoscope.   To illustrate the dangers of superficial  judg-
ment we will take the horoscope of a man who had Mercury in Capricorn in the
sixth  house,  making only one aspect which was a weak  square  to  Neptune.
Judging  the horoscope quickly one would say that he had a  dull  mentality,
but as a boy he stood at the head of his class.  In spelling and mathematics
he was very bright.  As a man he has reached a high status among his associ-
ates.  He is a leader in a line of work which requires executive ability and
a keen mentality.  To illustrate our point we will note what the other plan-
ets indicated.   He had seven planets in airy signs,  five planets in mental
signs,  the moon and Neptune both well aspected and in angles,  the sun  and
moon in fixed signs, and fixed and cardinal signs on the four angles.   When
summing up the entire horoscope we can well see why this man reached such  a
high position in mental work with a weak Mercury.   So we want to impress it
firmly upon our readers to use their reasoning powers before giving a  judg-
ment on a horoscope, whether it is for mental, moral, spiritual, or physical
qualities.

                                 CHAPTER VI

                         THE SIXTH HOUSE INFLUENCES

   After  we have carefully studied the mental qualities of our  patient  we
must try to find the strength of the will.  The Ascendant as a rule gives us
a  key to will and to the mentality.  Now we will see what bearing  the  6th
house has on the matter.   The 6th house is the house of sickness,  and very
often gives the key to the patient's condition.   We therefore first look to
the ruler of this house to see what it indicates,  in what sign and house it
is placed,  and what the nature of the sign is and what part of the body  is
ruled by it.   Next we must see what planets are aspecting the ruler of this
house of sickness.

   Let  us suppose that Aquarius is on the cusp of the 6th house.   Then  we
would look for the two planets, Uranus and Saturn, which have rule over this
sign.   Naturally  they will have rule over the health of the patient  to  a
very great extent.   Now, suppose that Uranus is in the sign of Virgo and on
the  Ascendant,  as we find it in the horoscope of a man who was born  April
22nd,  1881, at 2 P.M.  Uranus rising gives the key to the nature,  which is
one of great impulse.  The co-ruler of the 6th house is  Saturn.  We find in


[PAGE 44]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

the  greater number of horoscopes that Saturn is the afflicter.   He is  the
taskmaster that brings to man the needed lessons.   Saturn in the  horoscope
which we have under consideration is in Taurus, intercepted in the 9th house
and in conjunction with the sun and Jupiter.  Saturn is not in this case the
worst afflicter.

   We now consider the planets which may be in the 6th house.   Here we find
the vacillating moon in Aquarius and square to Venus and Neptune.   The lat-
ter  two planets are in the sign of Taurus in the 9th house.   Here we  have
the whole trouble.  The moon and Venus are both feminine,  indicating women;
the moon is the ruler of the 11th house,  and thus represents women friends,
who  tempted and caused this man to respond to the Uranus-Mars impulse.   So
we may look for trouble through overindulgence of the desires, which are in-
dicated by the planets in Taurus and by Mars,  the latter ruling the sign of
Scorpio,  which governs sex.   Hence we may expect that wine and women  will
bring this man to his undoing.

   Note  that  Mercury is in the 8th house,  and aspected very weakly  by  a
semi-sextile of Saturn,  the sun,  Jupiter,  and Neptune.   Mercury in Aries
works  under  impulse.   It being practically unaspected in  this  sign  and
Uranus  being  in opposition to Mars indicate a lack of  forethought.   With
these  conditions and having a common sign on the Ascendant this man  was  a
perfect slave to his passions and desires.  Here we may see what the,  Virgo
Ascendant with Uranus in conjunction shows  regarding  the  will.  A decided


[PAGE 45]                                         THE SIXTH HOUSE INFLUENCES

lack of will power is indicated.  With Virgo,  the natural 6th house sign on
the Ascendant, and the sun in Taurus, this man was an easy victim of disease
for both Virgo and Taurus have a decided fear of sickness.

   We must never base our diagnosis on one or two afflictions,  but we  must
study all the signs and planets very carefully.   Some horoscopes show  very
plainly  what is the matter,  and at a glance we can see from a few  aspects
what the disease may be.   But other horoscopes hide the symptoms,  just  as
the doctor often finds it to be the case with his patients.   Some tell  him
at once where the disease is,  while others are a puzzle and the disease may
be difficult to locate.   Therefore the astrologer must study and reason  to
be very sure that he has the correct diagnosis.

                                 CHAPTER VII

                       PRELIMINARY STEPS IN DIAGNOSING

   We  are  now  ready to begin the real work of reading  and  diagnosing  a
chart.   First we must know what the rising sign indicates,  for by this  we
get the key to the patient's disposition.   The Ascendant indicates the gen-
eral  nature  of the planetary baptism which a man received  at  birth,  and
which will influence him all through this physical life.   According to  the
stamp of the stellar forces at birth will a man's tendencies be.   Remember,
we  do not say fate,  but TENDENCIES,  for man has the power within  him  to
change  to  a very great extent the influences that are shown in  the  horo-
scope.   We must admit that the horoscope is the result of his  past  living
and that it indicates a certain probable destiny.  If he allows the stars to
rule him, why then he becomes the victim of fate; but the wise man is he who
rules his stars.

   The Ascendant indicates the general characteristics and tendencies  which
are latent within a man.  Therefore this should be the starting point of our
diagnosis.   Then  we must see how the four angles are represented.   If  we
find common signs, namely, Gemini, Virgo,  Sagittarius, and  Pisces  on  the


[PAGE 47]                                    PRELIMINARY STEPS IN DIAGNOSING

cusps,  we have a patient who will respond quickly to suggestions, and while
he  will listen to the healer and may seemingly try to cooperate  with  him,
still  on account of his wavering tendencies, or let us say the weakness  of
will of the common sign person,  he is prone to forget to follow directions.
One's instructions must be repeated often or the common sign patient is  apt
to forget them.

   If the Ascendant and the four angles,  however,  are occupied by the four
cardinal signs,  namely, Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn, you may expect
cooperation from your patient;  but if Aries is on the Ascendant,  you  must
let him think that he is doing the work himself.  Never order an Arian to do
anything, but diplomatically ask him if he does not think so and so would be
good for him, for Aries dislikes to follow the dictates of another.  When he
does follow your instructions, however, he will do it with great force,  and
impulsively.   We sometimes hear of people who follow the doctor's orders to
the extent that they will take a whole box of pills at one dose.  Well, such
is the Aries patient.   He must have results quickly or he will lose his in-
terest.   The cardinal sign people as a rule are willing to  cooperate  with
the healer, and they will also make every effort to overcome disease.

   The fixed sign people,  namely,  those under Taurus,  Leo,  Scorpio,  and
Aquarius,  are creatures of habit; that is, they are so fixed that when they
get  into a rut,  or if they form a habit,  they are very difficult for  the
healer  to handle.  This habit, which may be  at  the  very  bottom  of  the


[PAGE 48]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

trouble  and have caused the disease,  they hold on to with  tenacity.   The
fixed  sign people have great determination, and when once they are  aroused
they  cooperate  fully with the healer.  Taurus and Scorpio  people  may  at
times display a stubborn nature which is hard to combat,  and they are  also
so  full of fear that the healer must be very careful of his suggestions  in
their presence.  He must always be optimistic and give suggestions of hope.

   The  healer  should be familiar with the temperament and  disposition  of
each  sign,  and realize that if the ruler of the sign is  afflicted  or  if
malefic planets are in the sign, the response will be very different than it
will when the best sign of the sign is expressed.  Remember, the unafflicted
magnanimous,  jovial, and loving Leo is a very different person from the af-
flicted blustering, bragging, quarrelsome, stubborn Leo.  Similarly,  we may
find two sides to each sign.   Let us study the signs and their rulers  very
carefully.  Note also very carefully what aspects the ruler of the Ascendant
makes, for this plant is usually the life ruler and has a great influence on
the life of the native.

   The  next step is to study the mind,  for if the mentality is  weak,  the
healer  finds his work most difficult.   In the mind of man lies  the  power
which  may be used to control disease.   A strong and well aspected  Mercury
will guide a man into a safe and sane path of living,  and such a person  is
not prone  to succumb to disease.  But the afflicted Mercury often leads man


[PAGE 49]                                    PRELIMINARY STEPS IN DIAGNOSING

into temptations,  and if the desire nature is strong and the mind weak,  we
may  expect  that the patient will not have the will to cooperate  with  the
healer.   Hence we may say that the healer must study the chart  very  care-
fully in order to trace the latent tendencies of his patient.   When he  has
traced them, he is able to get to the first cause.  Remember,  everything in
life  has a first cause,  and to get an understanding of a case we  must  go
back to the beginning.

                                CHAPTER VIII

                       HINTS AND HELPS FOR THE HEALER

   1.--NEVER,  NEVER  predict the time of death to your  patient.   Let  the
reader repeat this injunction so as to impress it firmly upon his mind.   If
you predict DEATH to a patient,  YOU may become his executioner,  and before
your  God you will be held accountable for a great wrong.   There is an  old
adage which says,  "While there's life, there's HOPE."  No matter how strong
the affliction may be in the horoscope, sometimes Divine Providence may lend
a hand, and very serious periods may be passed with the proper help.

   2.--The LAW does not permit a layman to diagnose disease for others; only
the licensed physician may do this.

   3.--The wise healer will NEVER discuss disease with his patient, nor will
he ever diagnose to the patient.  He will keep his knowledge for his own use
in healing.

   4.--At all times keep the patient's mind,  if possible,  from thoughts of
disease,  and  before  leaving give him some pleasant thought  to  help  him
along.  Laugh  and  joke  with  him;  always  leave  him  with  a smile, for


[PAGE 51]                                     HINTS AND HELPS FOR THE HEALER

cheerfulness is half the cure.

   5.--Refrain from asking him the question, "How do you feel?"   This has a
tendency to throw his thoughts back to his physical body,  which in  illness
is  a good thing for him to forget.   Let your first words of  greeting  be,
"What a beautiful day!   I am glad to see you."   Any greeting is good  that
will bring cheer, and help the sufferer to forget his pain.

   5A.--Never discuss the patient's horoscope with him;  if he insists  how-
ever, then give him encouraging hints only, but NEVER tell him of an impend-
ing crisis.

   6.--Sick  people often have a morbid desire to probe into the future,  to
know of any impending crisis or of possible death,  especially if they  have
some knowledge of astrology.   The healer should request the patient to dis-
continue  the study of his own horoscope while he is under his care;  other-
wise  he  will find that many adverse suggestions obtained from  such  study
will appear in the mind of the patient, which will hinder the healing.

   6A.--There are lines of force running between the two poles of a  magnet,
and there is in all nature a positive and negative side.   The human body is
a  most  powerful magnet expressing both the positive and the  negative  as-
pects.  When a man is ill, he expressed the negative side of his nature, and
therefore the healer should (and will if he is the right healer) express the
opposite aspect, namely the positive.  When this is done, the  patient  will


[PAGE 52]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

respond quickly,  and the healing will be successful.   Therefore it is very
necessary that the healer express positiveness and cheerfulness in the sick-
room.

   7.--When a man is ill, his power of resistance is at its lowest ebb,  and
he is very sensitive to influences from without.   At that time the currents
of the vital body are turned inward,  and he is apt to attract thoughts  and
magnetism  from  others which if negative will have an adverse  effect  upon
him.   When a man is in good health,  the vital body ethers radiate  outward
and thereby keep out negative elements, also throw out impurities.

   8.--When one is ill, his power of resistance is low, and at that time the
vibrations of the healer have a grater effect than at other times;  his  in-
fluence  is  therefore powerful either for good or evil.   If  the  healer's
thoughts are not pure,  if his life is not clean,  then his influence on the
patient  is not good.   Therefore it is most necessary that the healer  LIVE
THE LIFE of purity, otherwise he can do more harm than good.

   9.--If  the healer's Saturn is on the Ascendant or in the sixth house  of
the patient, he will have little success in helping the latter.

   10.--A healer with the sun in Scorpio or with Scorpio on the Ascendant is
usually successful.

   11.--The sun in fiery signs gives good healing power, also greater  power


[PAGE 53]                                     HINTS AND HELPS FOR THE HEALER

over the diseases of those signs than is possessed by others.

   12.--People  born  with common signs on the angles or with the sun  in  a
common  sign make the best nurses;  they have power to soothe the sick,  and
they bring a quieting influence into the sick room.

   13.--When Saturn is the afflicter,  the skin is often very dry,  and  the
vitality low.  Rub the skin briskly with rough bath gloves to stimulate cir-
culation.

   14.--People  with  Virgo on the Ascendant or with the sun in  Virgo  make
good nurses.

   15.--To calm a patient who has an afflicted Mars,  it is well to choose a
Saturn hour.

   16.--People  with Saturn in the sixth house rarely make a success in  the
art of healing.

   17.--When the patient is suffering with nervous trouble,  but Mars is not
afflicted,  it is well to use a sun or a Mars hour for manipulations or min-
istrations.

   18.--When the moon is increasing in light,  namely,  between the new  and
the full, stimulants have the greatest effect and sedatives the least.

   19.--When the moon is conjunction Saturn, stimulants have very little ef-
fect; but should the moon be conjoined to Mars, especially if Mars is strong
in the horoscope or is in the sign of Aries,  then the healer should be most
careful in administering stimulants.

                                 CHAPTER IX

                                  APHORISMS

   1.--The moon may be regarded as the giver and the taker of life; that is,
the  moon acts as a medium in carrying the life forces from the sun  to  the
earth and man, and the moon forces also eventually produce death.

   2.--When the moon is full, the tides are higher,  the bones are fuller of
marrow,  and oysters are fuller than at any other time.   The temperature is
then also highest in fevers.

   3.--During the first half of life, particularly in childhood the moon has
greatest rule,  and during the latter half of life the sun has the strongest
influence.

   4.--The moon has great influence over insane people,  that is,  lunatics,
and over hysterical,  epileptic, and nervous patients.   These patients feel
the changes of the moon very greatly; especially are they very restless dur-
ing the full of the moon.   They should never sleep with the moon shining on
them.

   5.--At the new of the moon the material forces are weakest.   The  period
of the waning moon,  namely between the full and the new,  is strongest  for
spiritual work, for at that time the influence of the sun is greatest.


[PAGE 55]                                                          APHORISMS

   6.--Do not perform an operation when the moon is in the sign which  rules
the part of the body to be operated upon.   Ptolemy says,  "Pierce not  with
iron  that part of the body which may be governed by the sign  actually  oc-
cupied by the moon."

   7.--Operations performed at the exact change of the moon are rarely  suc-
cessful.  Choose the time for an operation when the moon is waxing or, as it
is commonly termed,  the light of the moon.   Do not operate when the sun is
in the sign which rules the part of the body to be cut.

   8.--The moon revolves around the zodiac in about twenty-eight days.  Dis-
ease reaches a turning point every seven days.   Starting from the place  of
the moon at the beginning of the illness,  a change may be expected in seven
days  (the  square),  on the fourteenth day (the  opposition),  and  on  the
twenty-first day (another square).

   9.--The moon rules acute disease, the sun chronic.

   10.--It  is well to watch the squares and the opposition of the  moon  to
the transiting sun, Mars, and Saturn when operating.

   11.--The  moon has greatest rule over the health of the woman  while  the
sun influences the health of the man.

   12.--From the new to the full moon stimulants produce the most effect and
sedatives  are the weakest;  decrease the dose of the one and  increase  the
other.


[PAGE 56]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

   13.--When the increasing moon is in good aspect to the radical Jupiter or
Venus,  cardiac stimulation produces most lasting results.   Palpitation  is
most efficiently treated when the moon is decreasing and aspecting the above
planets favorably.   Apply heart stimulants with extreme care when the  moon
is  evilly aspected to these planets and especially when it is dark or  wan-
ing.

   14.--Good aspects to the radical moon from the transiting Jupiter and Ve-
nus are very helpful.

   15.   Saturn when placed in the sixth house of the horoscope at birth has
a tendency to lower the vitality.

   16.--The  sign in which the sun is at birth is a very vital  locality  in
the horoscope, its influence varying according as it is cardinal, fixed,  or
common.   Also the house containing the sun, be it cadent, succedent,  or an
angle  is important.   From the strength of the sun you may often judge  the
response which you will get from your patient.

   17.--Benefic aspects between the radical sun and Mars give great vitality
and resistance to disease.   An evil aspect between the Sun and Mars is bet-
ter from a health standpoint than no aspect at all.

   18.--Aspects to the Ascendant and the Midheaven are often unreliable  un-
less you are absolutely sure of the minute of birth,  and as clocks are fre-
quently off time and there is much confusion in regard to different kinds of
time, these two points should be used with great discretion.


[PAGE 57]                                                          APHORISMS

   19.--Planets that are in critical degrees (See Simplified Scientific  As-
trology,  page 81) have a greater influence either for good or evil than  in
other degrees.

   20.--Certain  fixed  stars have a powerful influence on  disease.   Espe-
cially should the three following nebular spots be watched:   the  Pleiades,
29 degrees of Taurus;  Ascelli, 6 degrees of Leo; and Antares,  8 degrees of
Sagittarius.

   21.--A  child with no aspect between the sun and Mars is subject to  many
child's diseases.

   22.--A  patient with many planets in airy signs requires more air in  the
sleeping apartment than others do; planets in fiery signs incline one to re-
quire much sunlight;  and people with planets in watery or earthy signs suf-
fer from too much sunlight.

   23.--With fixed signs on the angles and afflictions in common signs,  the
native  overcomes disease;  when common signs are on the angles and the  af-
flictions in fixed signs, he is more apt to succumb to disease.

   24.--A well aspected sun when in the sign of Aries or Leo gives great vi-
tality and an ability to throw off disease.

   25.--When people with Aries rising or the sun or Mars in the sign of  Ar-
ies at birth are ill, their temperature rises much higher than that of other
patients,  and they suffer much more quickly from fever, for there is a ten-
dency of the blood to rush to the head and to the skin.

   26.--An  affliction  between the Sun and Saturn or a square  between  the
moon and the sun gives low vitality.  When  this  condition  is found in the


[PAGE 58]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

horoscope  it is well during illness to watch the progressed moon in  aspect
to these afflicted plants,  and also especially the transits of the new  and
full moons.

   27.--Retrograde planets give very little help in disease.   Regardless of
whether  they are in good or evil aspect,  their influence is  latent  until
they turn direct; then we may look for their awakened influence.

   28.--Planets when they turn from retrograde to direct are slow in motion.
Their influence while in this slow motion is not as vital nor as powerful as
when they are swiftly moving.

   29.--Planets are strong when in signs of their own nature,  also when  in
aspect to planets which are in compatible signs.

   30.--When the hour of birth is not known a fairly accurate diagnosis  may
be  obtained  by using a flat chart, i.e.,  by placing Aries  on  the  first
house, Taurus on the second, Gemini on the third, etc.

   31.--Saturn's influence is contracting, while Mars' is loosening.

   32.--The  sun  rules  the vital fluid which is  specialized  through  the
spleen.   When the sun is afflicted at birth disease frequently occurs  when
progressions of the planets afflict the sun.

   33.--When the radical sun or moon is within orb of the Pleiades in 29 de-
grees of Taurus, the Ascelli in Leo 6, or Antares in Sagittarius 8,  trouble
with the eyes is indicated, especially if Saturn, Mars, or Uranus is also at
one of these spots.


[PAGE 59]                                                          APHORISMS

   34.--Mercury in the twelfth house, afflicted by the sun,  Saturn,  Uranus
or Mars, also Mercury in Capricorn, the house of Saturn, when afflicted by a
malefic will affect the hearing.

   35.--Watch  the malefic planets when they are placed in either the  sixth
or  the twelfth house,  the sixth being the house which has rule over  sick-
ness, and the twelfth having rule over hospitals and places of confinement.

   36.--It  is necessary to observe the antipathy between certain signs  and
planets.   For instance,  the fiery Mars may be posited in the water Pisces,
or the cold,  earthy Saturn in the fiery sign of Aries.  When a planet is in
the sign of its detriment, it may especially become a menace to health.

   37.--The  place where Saturn is found in the horoscope is most likely  to
be a weak place in the physical body, the place most easily affected by dis-
ease.

   38.--The  Lucifer  spirits from Mars aid in maintaining the heat  of  the
blood by dissolving the iron,  a Mars metal,  and enabling the blood to  at-
tract oxygen, a sun element.

   39.--A patient with the planet Mercury in square aspect to Saturn is  apt
to suffer from gloom.   A cheerful,  sunny room should be chosen,  with rose
colored walls.

   40.--The  sign  of Leo on the Ascendant with the sun  in  its  exaltation
sign, Aries, gives abundant vitality and the power to throw off disease.


[PAGE 60]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

   41.--If  a disease is caused by an affliction of Mars,  we may  look  for
help when the progressed moon reaches a good aspect of Venus.  When the dis-
ease is of a Saturnian nature, we may expect the greatest help when the moon
aspects Jupiter.   Note the symbol of Venus, the higher octave of Mars,  and
that of Jupiter, the higher octave of Saturn; in each case the latter symbol
is the inversion of the former.

   42.--If  the moon is in conjunction with Saturn at the beginning of  dis-
ease, we may expect that the disease will be of long duration.

   43.--Disease  related  to the moon is of an acute nature and  may  change
within twenty-eight days, but when the disease is related to the sun,  it is
of a more chronic nature and likely to be of longer duration and more  stub-
born in resisting treatment.

                                  CHAPTER X

                 DIAGNOSING FROM THE HANDS AND FINGER NAILS

   The astrologer often finds himself at a great disadvantage in his reading
and  diagnosing  in that the patient is frequently mistaken in the  hour  of
birth or is not able to give any time.  Also in seven out of every ten cases
in  which  the  native  thinks he has the right  time,  the  horoscope  when
corrected  by events or rectified is found to be wrong in  this  particular.
People are constantly coming to the Rosicrucian Headquarters with horoscopes
which they have erected or have had some professional astrologer set up, and
in numerous cases in which they have been positive they had the correct time
of  birth the rising sign does not tally with their personal appearance  and
temperament.

   In  one instance a woman claimed to have Pisces rising,  but when we  met
her personally we at once concluded that she had the first degrees of  Aries
on the Ascendant for she had red hair a decided ram's profile,  a  prominent
Roman nose,  and full lips,  which if you read THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  you
will find tally with Aries.   Another woman came to Headquarters claiming to
have Leo on the Ascendant, but she had a slender little body,  a  long  face


[PAGE 62]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

with  decidedly  receding  chin,  long slender  conical  fingers,  and  long
nails--a  perfect picture of Virgo.   One case came to our notice of an  ex-
tremely tall woman.  The hour of birth she gave brought Taurus on the Ascen-
dant,  but her personal appearance was very similar to that of Gemini.   The
horoscope had many planets in the signs indicating height:   the sun,  Jupi-
ter,  Mercury,  and Neptune were in Gemini, and the moon and Venus in Aries.
This would


                                  DIAGRAM A:
                    TWELVE DISTINCT TYPE OF FINGER NAILS


[PAGE 63]                                             HANDS AND FINGER NAILS

give her length of arm and upper body.   At first appearance we doubted  her
rising sign of Taurus, but when we examined her finger nails they were found
to be the perfect Taurian type.   Taurus was also indicated by the heavy jaw
and full neck.  A Gemini person's nails are small and the neck slender.

   Diagram  A will give the reader a key to the pure types of finger  nails,
correlated to the signs of the zodiac.   Horoscopes with many planets in one
sign will change the nails.  In the time the student will be able  by  using

                           DIAGRAM: FINGER NAILS


[PAGE 64]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

this  chart to detect the characteristics of any type.   Note how the  types
harmonize.  Fixed sign nails are broad, showing great persistence and deter-
mination.   The signs ruled by Venus, Taurus and Libra,  give a more rounded
nail; the fingers are well shaped and long, and the mount of Venus, which is
at  the base of the thumb is quite rounded and full.   We could  write  much
more on the hands and their characteristics as compared with the  horoscope,
but  as this chapter is especially written to help in the diagnosis of  dis-
ease, we will confine ourselves largely to this matter.

   It  is not very difficult to detect diseases which are latent.   For  in-
stance, look at Diagram No. 1.  We see a large, broad nail.  This is similar
to the pure Leo type.  With heart trouble latent, as in case No.  5A,  where
the impulsive Mars is on the Ascendant, square to Venus indicating poor cir-
culation  and a weak heart,  we will find that the little half-moons at  the
base of the nail are blue in color,  and the lines in the palms of the hands
are also blue.   When heart trouble has developed to a chronic stage and  is
deep-seated,  we find the nails ridged lengthwise as in Diagram No.  1,  and
the corners turned upward away from the flesh as in Diagram No. 2.   A horo-
scope  which  will illustrate this case may be found in THE MESSAGE  OF  THE
STARS, figure 3 on page 625.

   The  nail shown in Diagram No.  3 is characteristic of cases such as  No.
10A.   The nail which indicates liver trouble is usually large in  size  but
longer than No. 1 or 2.  The nail wedges into the flesh on the sides, and is


[PAGE 65]                                             HANDS AND FINGER NAILS

usually of a yellowish tint.  The lines of the palm are also yellow.  Remem-
ber when looking into the palm of the hand that the color of the lines is  a
valuable  clue to the health of the patient.   If in good health  the  lines
should be of a soft pin;  if the blood is impoverished,  the lines are  pale
and white;  if the patient is feverish,  the lines are red;  if the liver is
out of order,  they are yellow; and if the heart action is wrong,  the color
is blue.

   In Diagram No. 4, we have a nail which is generally found on the hands of
people who have common or watery signs on the angles.   Many planets in com-
mon  or watery signs produce what is called the psychic type.   People  with
long,  slender, clawlike fingers and nails are supersensitive and lacking in
strength and vitality.  This type of nail is often found on the hands of the
idle  rich,  women who nurse a lap dog instead of a child and always have  a
box of chocolates at their side.  Long, slender, well shaped hands and nails
belong to the psychic type, and when the nails are ridged lengthwise and the
color of the nail is pale,  it is an indication of a tendency to weakness of
the lungs.  People with long, slender nails are usually susceptible to colds
and coughs.

   Nail No.  5 belongs to the nervous person who is intellectually  inclined
and prone to overdo.

   Diagram No. 6 is that of a nail which indicates the person who frequently
bites  his nails.   It shows one who has little control over his temper  and
whose feelings are very easily hurt.  Such people are always carrying a chip


[PAGE 66]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

on their shoulder and always looking for slights.

                        DIAGRAM B: THE THUMB

   A well balanced thumb indicates ability to control the emotions,  includ-
ing  anger.  but where the thumb is short and the end of it  is  club-shaped
with a short nail, there is no control whatever over anger and things easily
turn red before the eyes.

                                  DIAGRAM B

   The thumb is a wonderful indicator of character,  and must be taken  into
consideration when diagnosing from the hand.   In Diagram B we see that  the
mount of Venus and the thumb are both a little too heavy.  This is a typical


[PAGE 67]                                             HANDS AND FINGER NAILS

Taurian thumb with the mount of Venus very large,  indicating a very  strong
desire nature.   The thumb is short and thick,  showing a lack of will power
to rule the desires.  When the thumb is long and well shaped, it is an indi-
cation of high ideals and the will to carry them out.

   In  a well proportioned thumb the first phalanx should occupy  two-fifths
and the second phalanx three-fifths of the length of the thumb.   The tip of
the  thumb should reach the middle joint of the first finger.   A very  long
thumb indicates that a person is obstinate, headstrong; a very short one in-
dicates lack of logic and a constant changing from one thing to another.  If
the thumb is very thick throughout its entire length, the desires and tastes
are more or less coarse and primitive, and the person is lacking in tack and
refinement.   If the thumb is very wide, especially at the tip, it indicates
one who "sees red" easily, often one who has an ungovernable temper; it also
indicates stubbornness.  The patient who has a normally developed thumb will
carry out the physician's orders.

   If  the  first phalanx of the thumb is very long and the  second  one  is
short, it indicates one who is reckless and whose actions are not controlled
by reason.   If the first phalanx is short and the second very long it indi-
cates a talker,  but not a doer.  Such a person is mistrustful of  everybody
and lacks self-control.

   The  mount of Luna is located on the little finger side of the  palm  and
extends from about the middle of the palm to the wrist.  When large and full
it  indicates  excessive  emotion  and  imaginations,   but   when  properly


[PAGE 68]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

proportioned  it gives a well balanced mind.  It is this mount of  the  moon
and  lines found upon it which give the diagnostician a clue to  mental  af-
flictions and designate the lunar person.


                      INDICATIONS FROM THE FINGER NAILS

   Long,  slender nails curving inward toward the flesh:  scrofulous and im-
pure blood, weakness of the lungs, and throat trouble.

   White spots on the nails:  anaemia, impoverished blood, nervousness.

   Long nails, thin and brittle:  weak vitality, negativeness, timidity.

   Black or blue spots on the half moons:  poison in blood,  obstructed cir-
culation,  or  restricted heart action.   The shape of the nails  should  be
taken into consideration before making a decision; see diagrams on page 63.

   Well rounded and clear cut half moons on nails indicate good circulation;
if pale pink, they indicate health; if dark blue, see page 64 for meaning.

   Nails whose top surface is concave indicate spinal weakness.

   Patients who have long smooth hands, the flesh soft and smooth,  the fin-
gers flexible, the nails white in color, and especially when the nails wedge
tightly into the side of the finger and the wedge portion is colored, may be
said  to have been BORN TIRED.   They will make little attempt to  help  the
healer;  they  would prefer to have the Invisible Helpers to  the  work  for
them.

Female, born January 27, 1865, 5:15 P.M.

   Instead of using this horoscope for the diagnosis of disease, we will use
it to illustrate the art of directing, and judging the crisis and the  dura-
tion of the disease.


[PAGE 71]                                              A LESSON IN DIRECTING

   We find the fixed sign of Leo on the Ascendant,  with the cardinal  signs
of Aries and Libra on the 10th and 4th cusps respectively;  the fixed  signs
of  Taurus and Scorpio intercepted.   In this horoscope we have two  rulers;
the  ruler of the Ascendant,  the sun,  which is in the sign of its fall  in
Aquarius and near the cusp of the 7th house; and the dynamic Mars,  which is
the  ruler  of the 10th house,  placed on the cusp of the 11th  house  in  a
critical  degree of the sign of Gemini.  Mars is sextile to Neptune  in  the
9th house and trine to the sun in the 6th house.   Therefore we may look  to
the sun and Mars as having the greatest influence on the life of this woman.

   Now  let us find the afflictions which were responsible for the  sickness
which  overtook  her.   We find Jupiter, which has rule  over  the  arterial
blood,  in  its own sign of Sagittarius in the 5th house,  square  to  Venus
which rules the venous circulation,  and which is exalted in the watery sign
of Pisces in the 8th house.   Jupiter is in opposition to Uranus in the sign
of Gemini and the 11th house.  Venus is also square to Uranus.   Now what do
these afflictions from the common signs indicate?  We have had similar indi-
cations  in the horoscopes of those who were afflicted with tuberculosis  of
the  lungs.   Venus  and Jupiter both so strong by  sign  and  afflicted  by
Uranus,  this  last named planet being in Gemini,  which has rule  over  the
lungs, would naturally interfere with oxygenation, also giving a tendency to
coughs and colds.

   On January 21,  1909, this woman contracted a heavy cold which culminated
in double pneumonia.  The adjusted calculation date (calculated as taught on
page 470, THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS) is August 16, 1864.

   We will now progress the planets from August 16, 1908,  which corresponds
to their places in the ephemeris on March 12, 1865.   By adding the distance
which the principal planets move in 5 months,  we find that in January  1909
the progressed sun was in 22-22 of Pisces;  the moon was in 27-28 of  Virgo;
Mars was in 21 degrees of Gemini; Jupiter in 27-19 of Sagittarius;  Venus in
7-50 of Taurus; Mercury in 17-16 of Pisces.

   Now to judge the kind of sickness we must see what aspects were made  be-
tween the progressed and radical planets bearing on the organic weakness  of
the lungs and poor circulation of the blood as shown in the radix.  We first
look for the afflictions of the planets in common signs,  and find that  the
sun had progressed to the conjunction of the radical Venus in Pisces,  which
made a square to the radical Jupiter.  Mars had progressed to the opposition
of the radical Jupiter, and was square to the progressed sun.   We also find
that  the  progressed moon was square to the radical Uranus in the  sign  of
Gemini, indicating the lungs.

   The  above aspects of the progressed planets to the radical were  a  very
severe affliction and especially since they were from the common signs.

   There are three points to be taken into consideration in reading a  horo-
scope; the radical chart is as the fact of the clock; the progressed planets


[PAGE 73]                                              A LESSON IN DIRECTING

are the hour hand; and the daily transits and the daily transits and the new
and  full  moons may be compared to the minute hand which  tells  the  exact
time.   The progressed aspects alone will not act; there must be an exciting
factor.   The transits act as the match that lights the fuse,  and the tran-
siting moon with its aspects and its lunations is the time marker.

   On January 21,  1909,  we find that the moon was in conjunction with  the
sun, and this was a new moon in the sign of Aquarius in square aspect to the
radical  Saturn,  which is in the fourth house in  Scorpio.   This  lunation
marked the day when the woman first contracted the cold which culminated  in
pneumonia.   Saturn at birth is square to the radical sun,  and the lunation
naturally strengthened this affliction.   This of itself would not have  af-
fected  the lungs,  but we find the progressed sun in conjunction  with  the
radical Venus in the 8th house and in the watery sign of Pisces.   Venus  is
the most adversely situated planet in the horoscope; it is in its exaltation
in Pisces, but is afflicted by a square of Jupiter and Uranus at birth.  The
radical  Jupiter is receiving assistance from the sextile of the  moon,  and
Uranus has a trine from Saturn,  which will ameliorate the evil of these two
planets,  but Venus is afflicted from both sides and without a  single  good
aspect to offset the evil.   We also find that Venus had progressed to  7-50
of  Taurus in the tenth house and had reached a square of the  radical  sun.
The  double affliction of the sun,  the effect of which is of a hot and  in-
flammatory  nature,  was in this case responsible for the inflammation which


[PAGE 74]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

took place in the capillaries of the lungs.

   But the question may be asked, Why should this inflammation take place in
the lungs?   Why not in the throat or the feet where the afflicting  planets
are  found?   Mars,  which is another hot and inflammatory planet  had  pro-
gressed  to 21-00 degrees of Gemini and was then squaring the radical  Venus
and progressed sun.  Mars, therefore, was the focusing point of the disease.

   We  have previously stated that the moon is the time marker of a  disease
and also marks the crisis.   We therefore go to the beginning when the  cold
was contracted and watch when the moon came to a square to the place of  the
lunation, which was at midnight of Jan. 27, 1909, seven days later.  Medical
science counts its critical days by 7, 14, and 21.   The moon has particular
influence over man, and marks the time when recovery is apt to take place.

   Let  us follow the transiting moon on her journey and see her  influence.
On the 25th she reached the conjunction of the radical Venus and  progressed
sun,  also  the opposition to the progressed moon,  which was  in  27-28  of
Virgo.   This did not bring any great change,  but on the night of the  27th
and  the  early  morning of the 28th when the transiting  moon  reached  the
square  of  the preceding lunation,  a conjunction with the  Midheaven,  the
Dragon's Tail,  and the progressed Venus, also an opposition to the  radical
Saturn, death was very close.  At 1 A.M. of the 28th the woman passed out of


[PAGE 75]                                              A LESSON IN DIRECTING

the body.   She was able to see herself lying on the bed, and was fully con-
scious that death was near when the cries of the nurse who shook her brought
her back to life.

   The  length of an illness may be known by the signs in which the  planets
which  caused the illness are found.   If in fixed signs,  the  recovery  is
slow;  in cardinal signs,  the illness is very severe but quickly over.   In
all cases it is well to look to the radical aspects of Mars and the sun.  If
these  planets are well situated and aspected as in the case of this  woman,
(Mars trine to the sun) and if fixed signs are on the angles it is an  indi-
cation that the patient will win out,  where many under similar  afflictions
would go to the grave.

   Well may Henley say that man is the captain of his soul.  When we look at
this horoscope,  we read the message in the planets that this soul had  pre-
pared a wide gate for itself and that the Path should be smooth and full  of
sunshine,  for  we find twenty-four good and but eight evil  aspects.   This
from an astrologer's point of view should bring good health and happiness.

   We  find the common and earthy sign of Virgo on the Ascendant,  with  the
moon  and Uranus in conjunction in the first house,  forming a sextile  with
Venus and a trine with Mercury,  which latter is the ruler of the  Ascendant
and  Midheaven;  also  a trine to the higher octave of Mercury, the mystical

house  and in conjunction with the moon, is ruler of the sixth  house  which
governs the common people, the laboring classes.

   The  common and earthy sign of Virgo gives a tendency to drift along  the
path of least resistance.  The people under this sign are not keen to battle
with the tide but prefer to drift and are prone to  become  victims of their

physical ailments.   In the case of this woman we find Mars,  the planet  of
dynamic  energy,  posited in Leo in the 12th house,  that  of  self-undoing.
When Mars is in the fixed and fiery sign of Leo,  its influence for good  or
evil is much greater than elsewhere.   We find in this case that Mars is the
chief afflicter, being square and parallel to the life ruler,  Mercury,  and
square  to its higher octave,  Neptune.  But why should this  affliction  be
considered  important  when  there are so many good aspects  to  offset  it?
People with Mars in Leo may be likened to a keg of powder:   they are apt to
go  off  at  any moment,  especially when Mercury  and  its  higher  octave,
Neptune,  are square to Mars and in the fixed sign of Taurus.  These aspects
give an ungovernable temper and indicate one who would hold resentment.

   We find Venus, the planet ruling the appetite, the palate,  and the plea-
sures of the table, in the 11th house, friends, in the sign of Cancer,  gov-
erning the stomach.  Venus is sextile to Mercury and Neptune,  both of which
are placed in the home of Venus, the sign ruling the throat, Taurus.   Venus
is also sextile to the moon, the ruler of Cancer, and to Uranus, the natural
ruler  of the 11th house.   These aspects and positions indicate  that  this
woman  was blessed (or shall we in this case term it afflicted?)  with  many
friends who invited her to many dinners, and she was ever ready to  respond,
for  with  the  moon and Uranus in conjunction in the first  house  she  was
naturally  of  a  restless  nature  and  ready  to go whenever an invitation


[PAGE 79]                                                           THE EARS

arrived.   A sextile between Venus in Cancer and the moon gives  desire  for
rich  pastries and sweets,  consequently her stomach was much abused by  ex-
cesses.   Also her nervous system was shattered by fits of anger.   Thus the
vagus or pneumogastric nerve was weakened.

   This cranial nerve, which has its origin in the fourth ventricle, plays a
prominent part in the functions of the physical body.   Its branches  extend
to  the  ear,  throat,  heart,  lungs,  and  liver,  and  it  surrounds  the
oesophagus,  the  tube  through which the food passes after  it  leaves  the
mouth,  with a network of little nerves.  Its branches also surround a large
part  of  the stomach.   An excess of food which dilated and  distended  the
stomach,  brought about by the impacts of the moon and Uranus on the  Ascen-
dant,  and  the temper of Mars square Mercury undermined this  poor  woman's
health so that she became a chronic invalid.

   The  sun is in a common sign near the Midheaven and afflicted by  a  con-
junction  with Saturn in the Mercurial sign of Gemini.   Mercury,  the  life
ruler,  has rule over the hearing.   We naturally look to the place occupied
by the strongest planet for the affliction.   This woman was afflicted  with
deafness in both ears,  for one branch of the vagus nerve rules the  auricle
of the ear.  She also suffered from a constant pain under her right shoulder
blade, indicating liver trouble, and she was abnormally nervous.

   Here  we may see how man may be his own executioner as indicated in  this
horoscope.  The ruler of the house of death, the  eighth house, is afflicted


[PAGE 80]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

in the house of self-undoing, the twelfth.  The only remedy for a patient of
this  type is to eliminate all sweets and pastries,  cut down the supply  of
food to one-half, and learn to be still, to relax.

   This woman was born on June 22, 1881, at noon.  We find the Venusian sign
of Libra on the Ascendant and the sun on the cusp of the Midheaven.  This is
the most powerfully situated planet and therefore the life ruler.   The  sun
is sextile to Mars.  In THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS, page 164, we are told that
a  good aspect between these two fiery planets strengthens the  constitution
and  makes the person able to perform hard tasks and produces  a  superabun-
dance of vital energy.  As the sun is accidentally dignified by being placed
in the 10th house and on the cusp of the Midheaven,  the native should  have
an  abundance  of will and energy to overcome almost any disease.   This  we
will touch upon later.

   We  find  here  a  very strange combination of  planets,  a  blending  of
benefics and malefics, all clustered in the 8th  house and in the fixed sign

Mars.   Some may question the conjunction of Mars 0-31 and Saturn 9-13 as we
have heretofore given six degrees as the orb of the minor planets, but there
are exceptions to this rule.  Where we find a cluster of planets placed in a
sign in which their evil tendencies are strong, especially when  in  a fixed


[PAGE 82]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

and also a bestial sign,  then the orbs of those planets are greater,  their
influence  is stronger.   Now,  with Saturn's evil enhanced by  the  martial
rays,  Saturn will have a strong influence for evil when he is placed within
orb of a conjunction with the moon and Neptune.

   We  look  for the physical trouble from the above  four  planets.   These
placed in Taurus, the sign ruling the neck, also the glands, nerves, and ar-
teries  within this region of the body which Saturn is afflicting,  indicate
atrophy  or obstruction.   Saturn's influence on Neptune and the moon  would
cause a contraction of the nerves.   We find Jupiter and Venus also in  con-
junction  with the moon and Neptune and therefore indirectly  influenced  by
the orb of the afflicting Saturn.  So we may conclude that this entire group
of six planets situated in the fixed sign of Taurus and in the 8th house  is
under affliction.

   Jupiter  rules the arterial blood,  and Venus the venous blood.   Neptune
and the moon on account of the conjunction with Saturn may be termed malefic
and  will restrict the circulation in the carotid artery and interfere  with
the  various tubes that carry air and fluid to the ear,  for the  moon  also
rules the white fluids or body oil.   As a result of the restriction of  the
various fluids, the semi-circular canals of the inner ear are lacking in the
liquid known as endolymph.  This liquid acts upon the nerves that run to the
three canals as the acid acts upon the copper plates in an electric battery.
Where this endolymph is lacking, the equilibrium of the  body  is disturbed,



[PAGE 83]                                                           THE EARS

and,  as in the case of this young woman,  people so afflicted can not  walk
without pitching forward.

   With  the obstructed circulation of both arterial and venous  blood,  she
has also suffered with spasmodic torticollis,  the twisting of the  cervical
muscles.  The square of Mercury to Mars would give this nervous contraction.

   The  trouble developed in the fall of 1914 when the progressed  moon  had
reached a conjunction with the radical Mercury, the transiting Uranus was in
8 degrees of Aquarius making a square to Saturn,  and the transiting  Saturn
was  in conjunction with the radical sun in the Midheaven.   These  transits
excited  the affliction of the progressed moon,  and naturally  the  nervous
system was disturbed.

   It has been said in our astrological diagnosis in the past that the  con-
junction  of Saturn and Neptune in Scorpio or Taurus may cause  malformation
of the generative organs,  and in THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS a case was  given
proving this.   The affliction of planets often works in squares and opposi-
tions.   In this case all the planets are in Taurus,  which rules the larynx
and  throat and is the sign opposite to Scorpio,  ruling the generative  or-
gans.   Here we find the cause of a disturbance which to some extent  helped
to  bring about the physical trouble.  There was an abnormal  and  unnatural
sex desire which,  not finding expression,  excited the flow of blood to the
throat, and this being obstructed caused a disturbance.


[PAGE 84]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

   Now regarding the sextile of the sun and Mars and the trine of Uranus  to
the various afflicted planets in Taurus,  were it not for these good aspects
this young lady would not have grown to womanhood,  for great trouble  would
have arisen during puberty.  But the life-giving sun, so powerfully situated
in the Midheaven,  sextile to Mars, and also within orb of a sextile to Sat-
urn, saved her much trouble during this period.

   If  she could come under th care of an experienced osteopathic  physician
who  understands  proper manipulations,  this together with a  careful  diet
would enable her to overcome her physical afflictions.

   In  this  horoscope we will continue with afflictions found  in  cardinal
signs.   While they may be in different signs of the cardinal group, yet the
effect is similar in all.

   In this lesson we have the horoscope of a woman with Virgo on the  Ascen-
dant  and  common signs on the angles.   Two prominent planets,  Uranus  and
Mars,  are in or near the 10th house.   While they are retrograde and not in
conjunction,  still they are parallel to each other and parallel to the sun.
Mars being in conjunction with the midheaven, sextile to Neptune,  and trine
to the moon,  gives great enthusiasm.  Whatever this woman attempts to do is
done under impulse and with great force.   With Mars and Uranus so prominent
and  the sun in Capricorn she feels that she must rule at any cost.   Should
she be denied this privilege,  she would become very resentful and  revenge-
ful.

   With Saturn in its sign of exaltation,  Libra,  square to Mercury in  the
Saturnian  sign  of Capricorn,  we meet the vicious circle of  the  cardinal
signs.   The sun in Capricorn afflicted by a square of Neptune, both in car-
dinal signs,  together with the parallel of the nervous and excitable Uranus
to the hot and inflammable Mars has caused a succession of abscesses in  the

was in a cardinal sign.

   It is not necessary,  however,  that these afflicted planets should cause
deafness.   The  planets  impel,  they  excite.  But wisdom is ever a friend

which saves;  man has but to learn to know himself.  If he would be as zeal-
ous  in understanding the functions of his own physical body as he is  those
of his radio or automobile,  then when planetary afflictions became known to
him and the symptoms appeared in the physical body,  he would at once set to
work  to conquer them just as he would go about repairing the  mechanism  of
his machine,  oiling it, and cleaning it.  For instance,  if congestion were
felt in the neck or ears, there would most likely be some discomfort experi-
enced before any damage was done.  Then a slight manipulation should be made
about the ears and the frontal bone,  up and down the jugular vein,  th back
of the neck,  and wherever the fingers can find sore spots on and about  the
cranium.   Frequently  a  towel wrung out of hot water will  relax  the  re-
stricted  nerve centers in head and neck and regulate the blood flow to  and
from the brain.  This will keep the congestion down, and all serious trouble
may be avoided.

   We usually judge the appearance of the native by the ruler of the  Ascen-
dant and the planets on or near the Ascendant,  also by the positions of the
sun and moon and their aspects.   In this case we find there are two rulers,

success in worldly matters.   He craves riches, and worries and becomes very
restless when material matters do not prospect.  This would in time, if con-
tinued, undermine his health and cause him to suffer from nervous disease.

   Neptune in the sign of Aquarius in square aspect to the moon in the  wor-
risome and pessimistic sign of Taurus in the 5th house, the house of invest-
ments,  indicates that he expends much energy in speculation.  It is plainly
indicated  that  he has a tendency to become entangled with  large  corpora-
tions.   He wrote to Headquarters several times endeavoring to get us to ad-
vise him regarding his speculations,  but was told repeatedly that this  was
against our teachings.  During the war he invested his all in a large corpo-
ration which was building a submarine boat in which it hoped to interest the
government;  but the corporation did not succeed in this, and in consequence
he lost heavily.  We find that Saturn in the 2nd house in the watery sign of
Pisces,  square to Jupiter in Gemini;  also the watery planet Neptune is  in
the last degree of Aquarius in the 2nd house,  square to the watery moon  in
the 5th house and the second sign,  Taurus,  all indicating speculation  and
loss.

   Worry  over financial loss aggravated the eye trouble from which  he  had
suffered for a number of years.  He has been an incessant reader and has put
a heavy strain on his eyes.   The mental disturbance over his financial loss
weakened the nervous system,  causing him to lose the sight of one eye.   We
find the moon in 29 degrees of Taurus conjunction the Pleiades and square to

Neptune;  Jupiter is in 10 degrees of Gemini in the 6th house, that of sick-
ness,  in opposition to the fixed star Antares,  which is situated in 8  de-
grees  of Sagittarius;  also Jupiter is making a square to  the  obstructing
Saturn, all indicating eye trouble.

   We find Mars square to Venus and trine to the moon in Taurus.   This  man
has in the past been fond of the "flesh pots of Egypt,"  and has gone to ex-
cess in drink and good things to eat.  The result is constipation and inter-
nal  hemorrhoids.   We note that with Jupiter square to Saturn he  has  also
suffered  from obstructed arterial circulation.   Due to the amount of  food
consumed  in the past the poor body has been unable to bear the strain.   At
present  he is fearing the loss of the second eye,  which if he is not  more
careful in his diet and mode of living may be the case.

   This man would be a very hard patient to heal,  as Mars in Capricorn near
the  Ascendant is a most stubborn influence;  he will not take  advice  from
anyone.   It would take great persuasion and diplomacy to get him to  follow
the advice of the healer.

   The  Rosicrucian method of healing is not only one of faith,  but  it  is
faith joined with common sense.   We recognize disease,  we acknowledge that
it  is caused by breaking the laws of nature.   Sometimes there is  lack  of
will.   The horoscopes that we will herewith diagnose will show how one  can
overcome  where another will succumb to almost the same astrological  condi-

   Application for healing was made by this woman during the winter of 1918,
to assist her during an operation for the removal of cataracts on both eyes.
She had been under the care of the doctor for a number of months.   He  con-
cluded  that the cataracts had reached a stage where they could  be  removed
with safety,  but the woman felt that she desired the assistance of our  In-
visible Helpers during this trying period.  She had previously heard of  the
wonderful success of our healers from friends who had been benefited.

   There were a number of good aspects in the horoscope,  which always  make
for safety,  especially Mars trine the sun,  which gives great  recuperative
power.  In  looking  for  the  afflictions we find Mercury opposition to the

eyesight;  especially is this true when they are afflicting the sun and Mer-
cury.

   Much  of this woman's trouble is due to the afflictions which we find  in
the cardinal signs,  Aries and Libra,  the latter of which has rule over the
kidneys.   Jupiter is conjoined to the restricting Saturn which is strong in
Libra, its sign of exaltation, and these two  planets,  namely,  Jupiter and


[PAGE 94]                                                    ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

Saturn,  are in opposition to Neptune in Aries, while Mars is also strong in
Aries,  being conjoined the moon.   These are danger signals,  showing  that
through  wrong living (moon conjoined Mars stimulates the appetite) she  has
undermined  her  health by wrong choice of foods and by  eating  to  excess.
These practices have filled the kidneys with poisons,  and when the  kidneys
suffer  the eyes go wrong,  for the eyesight is frequently impaired  through
the  kidneys.   However,  cataracts are usually due to an excess of  sweets,
creams,  and very rich foods, and the afflictions in Libra are prone to send
these impurities to the eyes.   But since Mars is in good aspect to the  sun
and Venus, and the sun and Venus are in conjunction, this woman has overcome
the obstacles and been cured, passing successfully through the operation for
removal of cataracts.

outcome  of  this case in 1919,  and earlier stage of which in 1915  is  de-
scribed in No. 11B.

   This is the case of a woman afflicted similarly to the one in No. 2B, but
the reverse condition is found as regards the aspects of the planets.  Noth-
ing but adverse aspects exist with the exception of one, Mars trine  to  the

moon.   We find the sun, the life giver, in the sign Aries,  restricted by a
conjunction  of  Saturn and in opposition to Jupiter,  ruling  the  arterial
blood,  placed in the sign Libra, ruling the kidneys.   These three  planets
are also square to the moon in Cancer,  the stomach.   Here we find the kid-
neys (the janitor),  the stomach, (the cook), and the head of the home,  Ar-
ies,  all afflicted,  careless, and not doing their work.  How can a home be
kept clean and fit to live in if all the workers are on a strike?   The dust
will  accumulate,  an naturally the tenant will be very  uncomfortable.   We
find the stove full of ashes;  it will not burn,  and the smoke is  escaping
through the doors and windows instead of through the chimney.

   In this horoscope we find the same indications as in No. 2B.  The kidneys
have not been eliminating properly,  and an abundance of food has been  con-
sumed which has not been properly digested.   Naturally the body has  become
overcharged with poisons, which must find an outlet.  We again find that the
weakest place is the head and eyes.   When this woman called upon us she had
been  operated  on by a doctor who claimed that it was necessary  to  remove
both eyeballs as they had become diseased.   The operation had already  been
performed upon one of them, which affected the sight of the other.   The re-
sult  was that our healing was not successful.   We were able,  however,  to
help  the  patient greatly in the matter of her stomach trouble,  it  having
seemed almost impossible for her to digest her food.   But in her  horoscope
we find little encouragement.  Mars evidently did not  give  the  assistance

necessary.  Mercury, the sun and moon are all afflicted.  The native had not
the  strength of will or mentality to assist nature in a cure of her  blind-
ness as we find Mercury square the moon and conjunction Saturn.

   In order to help such patients it is necessary first to remove the  cause
of the disease.  We must advise them to live so that the kidneys will be pu-
rified.   An entire change of diet is necessary; tea, coffee, meat,  and all
starchy foods must be eliminated.   Nine patients out of ten will respond to
healing  very  quickly as soon as you give them a sane  and  rational  diet.
Teach  them  how  to live,  and the work of the Invisible  Helpers  will  be
greatly reinforced.

   First we judge the mind,  by the aspects and position of Mercury and  the
moon.  We find that Mercury is in conjunction with the sun, but not so close
as to be combust; therefore he is in a very good position.  We also see that
he is sextile to Jupiter and Neptune and trine to Mars.  This gives the mind
considerable energy and brightness and creates an optimistic nature.  On the
other  hand we find the moon in conjunction with the planet of  obstruction,
Saturn, and square to Venus, which is a testimony in the opposite direction.
Saturn  is square to Neptune and Uranus is square to Mars.   Thus  all  four
malefics are afflicting one another, and there can never be any great cheer-
fulness  where  this is the case unless the person can  learn  through  phi-
losophy or religion to seek a peace that is above earthly understanding.  At
the same time it must be understood that all the good aspects in the present
case  will help to give the native occasional periods of optimism  and  joy,
which will break the periods of gloom and despondency.

   We find that there are common signs on the angles,  which is a  testimony
of  a flexible character,  difficult to rouse from sickness or trouble  into
which the native may fall.  The moon in conjunction with Saturn in Aquarius,
the sign which governs the ankles and lower parts of the limbs, is  evidence

tion to the  moon  and  Saturn  shows  that  there  is  a fluttering of that

organ.   This condition is much aggravated by the aforementioned  square  of
the four malefics.

   Saturn rules the pneumogastric nerve;  if you count four degrees  forward
from the position of Neptune to make the exact square with Saturn,  you will
find that the point thus reached falls in Taurus,  which  governs  the lower

part of the head and the neck.   This shows that there is pressure upon  the
pneumogastric nerve where it leaves the head.   If this could be relieved by
an osteopathic treatment,  much good could be done for this person.   On the
other hand, the square of Saturn to Mars in the last degrees of Libra (which
works also upon the first degrees of Scorpio),  shows that there is  trouble
with  the  elimination of the urine, a restriction of  account  of  scalding
urine  and bleeding piles,  for Mars afflicted always causes heat and  erup-
tion.

   But the worst affliction in this person's life arises from the fact  that
Uranus is in the nebulous spot of the zodiac called Ascelli,  which is  cen-
tered in Leo 6.   Uranus being there an in opposition to Saturn and the moon
causes  blindness,  which sad to say cannot be cured by any physical  means,
for the afflictions which come from the fixed signs usually indicate a  des-
tiny which we have made for ourselves in past lives and which is now "ripe."
All that we can do for this person is to endeavor to make her as cheerful as
possible under that affliction.

   With respect to the poor circulation and the faulty elimination of  waste
products  a great deal can be done by osteopathic treatments and the  proper
kind of food.   She should avoid all condiments and stimulating foods  which
heat  the  urine,  and she should be taught to walk for exercise  so  as  to
strengthen the circulation in the body.

   There are many people who have been afflicted with blindness yet who have

made their mark in the world.   "WHAT MAN HAS DONE,  MAN CAN DO."   By  con-
stantly stimulating her to effort she may be roused from the lethargy  indi-
cated  by the common signs on the angles so that she will cease to feel  her
condition as she does at the present time.

   If the poor child whose horoscope we are about to diagnose had lived,  he
might well have said, "I could have been the master of my fate,  but instead
I have become a slave."   Freedom of will depends upon the limitations which
the soul has placed for itself in its former lives.   It may have placed ob-
stacles in its way by wrong use of knowledge or by breaking the laws of  na-
ture in some way.   Man was made in the likeness of God and God gave him do-
minion over the lower kingdoms.   Therefore he has no one to interfere  with
his freedom of will; he is absolute master of his destiny.

established beyond a doubt, would not God, whom we know is an all-loving Fa-
ther,  be very cruel and unjust?   Could we love and worship such a  tyrant?
But  He  has made man a little lower than the angels and has offered  him  a
crown of glory.  This crown is not given for the asking, however;  man  must

earn it by a life of purity and unselfishness.


   Now let us see what fate we may find in this babe's horoscope:

   We find Sagittarius rising, with Venus, moon, sun, and Uranus all in con-
junction  in the advanced sign of Aquarius,  intercepted in the  2nd  house,
sextile to the Ascendant.   Also the Dragon's Head, which is of a Jupiterian
nature,  is in conjunction with the Ascendant.   This would have  given  the
little fellow a most beautiful and charming personality.  With Mars near the
Midheaven, trine to Mercury, which is in the mental sign of Aquarius, he was
very bright mentally.

   At eleven months of age he could stand alone.  On July 12,  1919,  at the
age of 17 months, he fell from a balcony, but no serious symptoms developed.
At that time we find the transiting moon and Mars square to the radical Mars
in  the Midheaven;  this is a very strong indication of accident.   On  July
14th  and 15th the boy began to get drowsy,  and could not keep food in  his
stomach,  for on that day the transiting moon was in Aquarius, making an op-
position to Saturn and Neptune in the eighth house in Leo.   On the  morning
of the 16th he was taken with convulsions,  the transiting moon having  just
passed  a  conjunction with Venus,  moon,  sun,  and  Uranus.   Uranus  when
afflicted  causes convulsions.   At the third convulsion the child lost  his
eyesight,  for the transiting Mercury had reached an opposition to the plan-
ets  in  Aquarius,  (especially the lights, the sun  and  the  moon),  which
brought on total blindness, as indicated in the radical chart by Neptune  in


[PAGE 103]                                                          THE EYES

conjunction with fixed stars, the Ascelli, and also in conjunction with Sat-
urn.   On the fifth day of his illness he became unconscious, lost his hear-
ing  and  the control of his tongue,  and the head was drawn back  over  the
spine.   A number of the most noted doctors were consulted,  but none  could
diagnose the case.   They operated on the head and spine,  however,  and the
operations failed.

   Now,  from the astrological diagnosis what do we find?  Neptune rules the
spinal canal,  that channel of spiritual fire from which all life  emanates.
Saturn,  the planet of obstruction,  the chastener,  is found in conjunction
with this occult planet,  which also has rule over the pineal gland  through
which the spiritual faculties first become awakened.  Abuse of the spiritual
powers in former lives brings about physical infirmities.   From birth  this
boy's spine was affected,  the spinal fluid obstructed,  and total blindness
unavoidable.  It is a known fact to astrologers that a child born at the new
or  the  full of the moon,  if not supported strongly  by  benefics,  rarely
lives.   This child was born when the sun and moon were in exact conjunction
with the benefic Venus,  and Mars,  the planet of energy,  was elevated near

pects made it possible for this babe to live for a short time.   We have not
the  exact date of the child's death.  The last letter we received from  the
parents stated that he was very low on November 6th, and was not expected to

live.  We find on November 14th, 1919, the transiting sun making a square to
the  cluster of planets in Aquarius, and the transiting moon in  conjunction
with  the afflicting planets in Leo and making an opposition to the  planets
in Aquarius.   It would be almost impossible for the babe to pass these  af-
flictions, and death, no doubt, occurred at that time.

   We will here give a lesson on the effect of Saturn, the obstructor,  when
in the last decanate of Aquarius.   The writer has observed that many  cases
of  eye trouble may be traced to Saturn when he is posited between the  24th
and the 30th degrees of Aquarius,  and especially does this affect the sight
of the left eye.

   We will use a flat figure as the hour of birth is missing.   We find  the
sun in its own sign of Leo.  Saturn is retrograde in its own sign, Aquarius,
and Mars is in Scorpio, the sign in which it is able to  exercise  its  full

strength.   These three powerful planets are all in fixed signs and  in  op-
position or square to one another.  Here we find a debt of ripe destiny fac-
ing this soul which it was impossible to avoid.   At the age of twelve  this
girl was almost entirely blind.

   Now  let  us see if we cannot read the message of the stars and  see  why
this  dreadful affliction should come upon one so young.   What is the  debt
that she is called upon to pay?   Neptune,  the planet which rules spiritual
sight, is  exalted  in  the watery sign of Cancer.  This occult planet is in


[PAGE 106]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

opposition to Uranus,  which is retrograde and in the saturnine sign of Cap-
ricorn.   Uranus stands for clairvoyance and the unseen.   Capricorn is  the
natural 10th house sign of authority, that of one who rules.  The sun,  Sat-
urn, and Mars, all at home and in fixed and dominant signs and Mars parallel
to both Neptune and Uranus indicate that this poor soul in a previous  life,
and in a cruel and dominant manner while occupying a male body, used his oc-
cult  powers to enslave the opposite sex,  thereby causing many tears to  be
shed.   It is said, "The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding
small."   The  Lords of Destiny have brought this Ego,  who caused  so  many
tears to flow in a past life, into the weak body of this little girl,  whose
mother,  fearing childbirth, shed many tears while carrying her.  The result
was a tender, sensitive body with impaired eye sight.

parallel to and in conjunction with Mars in the sign of Aries.   This  indi-
cates emotion and impulse.   It shows one who does not reason but jumps into
things thoughtlessly and with fear.  Especially  is  fear  indicated when in

addition the sign of Virgo is rising.  Sometimes in such cases the resulting
acts of impulse rebound upon the native,  causing great suffering as in  the
case of this woman.   When she began to suffer with eye strain she permitted
the  doctors to operate on her eyes on two different occasions.   The  first
time  they  removed  the right eyeball, and the second  time  the  operation
destroyed the sight of the left eye.   From planetary indications,  with the
proper care and diet her eyesight might have been saved,  but  unfortunately
she did not hear of the Invisible Helpers until too late.

   We see that in the case of horoscope no. 2E,  the native was in the hands
of fate,  and she had to pass through the greater part of this life in dark-
ness, while in the second figure fear and excessive emotion precipitated to-
tal blindness.

   Female, born July 27, 1856, at 9:00 A.M.

   This woman has the feminine,  earthy, and common sign of Virgo on the As-
cendant.   We are taught in the COSMO-CONCEPTION that the Law of Consequence
works  in  harmony with the planets,  and that the spirit is born  into  the
physical world at that opportune time when these may operate in harmony with
each other.   The birth of the Ego is so timed by the Lords of Destiny  that
the horoscope,  which is the clock of destiny,  registers the kind of  debts
which  the  Ego has incurred in its previous lives and the time  when  these
debts come to fruition, when the harvest from the seeds which have been sown
must be garnered.

   However, the law of destiny is not a blind law, for it may be modified to
a certain degree in proportion to the strength of the will of the Ego.  When
fixed or cardinal signs are on the angles and the afflictions are from  com-
mon signs,  then the Ego is often able to modify the effect of planetary af-
flictions;  but when,  as for instance in the horoscope under consideration,
we  find a common sign on the Ascendant and the afflictions come from  fixed
signs, then it is very probable that the forces involved in the debt of des-
tiny are too powerful for the Ego and the Law must take its course.

   In this horoscope we find the sun strongly placed in  its  own sign, Leo,

which is a fixed sign, in conjunction with Venus, square to the inflammatory
Mars,  and parallel to Uranus.   The fiery planet, the sun,  is also in con-
junction with Ascellus,  a fixed star which is in 5-41 of Leo and has influ-
ence over the eyes.  We  find  Uranus  in  24-36  Taurus,  a  fixed sign, in

conjunction with the Pleiades,  a group of fixed stars which are in 28-41 of
Taurus, also having an afflicting influence upon the eyes.  We find the moon
prominently situated near the Midheaven in 12-29 of Gemini and in opposition


[PAGE 111]                                                          THE EYES

to  another fixed star,  Antares,  which is in 8 degrees and 27  minutes  of
Sagittarius.

   Here  we may read from the clock of destiny that blindness was likely  to
be the fate of this woman.   With the feminine,  earthy,  and common sign of
Virgo on the Ascendant and the afflictions from fixed signs,  what could  be
expected but that the will of this soul would not be strong enough to  over-
come.  Total blindness was the result.

   But what did she do to precipitate this?   We find Saturn,  the planet of
obstruction,  in the 10th house in the sign of its fall, Cancer,  and square
to Jupiter.   Saturn is most evil in this watery sign, the sign of the stom-
ach,  where he can undermine health by denying the stomach the fluids  which
are  so necessary for digestion.   In Cancer Saturn also perverts the  appe-
tite.   People with Saturn afflicted in Cancer have strange likes  and  dis-
likes regarding food and are most stubborn about it.  Even if they know that
too many chocolate creams and sodas and too much pie, cake,  etc.,  will un-
dermine their health, they will have them.  People with this affliction fre-
quently suffer from auto-intoxication.   The poison which is then  generated
by the stomach is mixed with the blood stream, and this very frequently pre-
cipitates blindness.

   We  find in this horoscope a well aspected Mercury,  which is sextile  to
Uranus  and the Ascendant and trine to Neptune,  indicating that the  native
had a keen desire for knowledge,  especially along occult lines, and did not


[PAGE 112]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

save her eyes,  but very likely read with poor light late at night,  perhaps
reading in bed, which is a most dangerous habit and which has caused many to
lose their eyesight.   But every cloud has its silver lining,  and  although
this poor woman has been totally blind for some years, yet she has developed
the sixth sense.   With Neptune sextile Uranus and trine Mercury,  she has a
wonderful development of the spiritual faculties, making it possible for her
to  leave  her body at will and she claims to be able to travel  to  far-off
planets.

   Had  these  afflicting planets and the Ascendant been  reversed,  with  a
fixed sign rising and the afflictions from common signs,  even though Saturn
had been in Cancer,  the will would have been strong enough to have saved at
least a degree of this woman's eyesight.

   Female, born June 28th, 1868.

   This horoscope is minus the hour of birth, therefore we are using a plain
figure with the planets copied from the Ephemeris for noon,  Greenwich  Mean
Time;  but from all indications we believe that this woman has the last part
of Cancer on the Ascendant.

   The sun is in conjunction with Uranus,  square to Jupiter,  Uranus  being
square  to Neptune,  while Jupiter is in conjunction with Neptune in  Aries.
If we take the rising sign to be Cancer,  this would bring the moon back  so
that  it  would be within orb of an opposition to Jupiter  and  Neptune  and
square to Uranus.   We have here a configuration of planets which  indicates
that excesses and emotions have ruled this woman to a very great extent, es-
pecially  as we find the planet of desires,  the hot tempered Mars,  in  its
fall in Taurus.  Mars when in Taurus has a tendency to express his evil side
and is prone to cause excesses in food and also in temper.   Now,  with Can-
cer,  the  sign ruling the stomach,  on the Ascendant and with  Uranus,  the
planet  of impulse,  in conjunction with the sun and square to  Jupiter  and
Neptune,  we have a woman who has very little self-control.  Excesses of all
kinds have filled her body with toxic matter.  The blood vessels have become
clogged and hardened.  When a woman  at the age of fifty-five who has had to

work hard to support herself and family gives away to anger,  and when as  a
result  the blood bounds through the hardened arteries bringing  an  unusual
rush of it to the head, we may expect trouble.  Let us see where this may be
found:

   Mars  is  in  conjunction  with the group  of  fixed  stars,  called  the
Pleiades,  which have an evil effect upon the eyes.   With Mars in 27-55  of
Taurus in conjunction with fixed stars of a Mars-moon nature,  with the pro-
gressed sun within orb of a square to Mars, and with the  progressed  Saturn


[PAGE 115]                                                          THE EYES

retrograded back to the opposition of Mars, there is a tendency for the tem-
per to be aggravated, bringing trouble upon parts of the body which Mars af-
fects,--in this case the eyes.  Saturn has a hardening, ossifying, restrict-
ing influence upon the part of the body corresponding to his position in the
horoscope.  We find this planet in 0 degrees and 0 minutes of Sagittarius in
opposition  to  Mars radical.   With these afflictions we  may  expect  some
trouble with the eyes.

   In the early part of July, 1923, this woman developed what doctors called
retinitis  of the right eye,  which is an inflammation of the retina.   This
caused a rupture of one of the blood vessels accompanied by severe pains  in
the neck and shoulders.

   We would not,  however,  attribute all the damage to temper and  hardened
arteries,  for  the foundation of the trouble had been laid by  eye  strain.
This  woman was employed during the day as a chiropodist,  and at night  she
spent long hours in reading occultism and studying astrology.   She had  the
pernicious habit of reading with a bright light close to the eyes while  ly-
ing upon a couch or bed, thereby causing a strain of the muscles of the eye.
With Neptune in opposition to the moon and Uranus square to both Neptune and
the moon, there has been a desire to force development.  Intensive gazing at
bright objects,  such as crystals,  etc., which is ignorantly taught by some
occult  orders,  has a most destructive effect upon the eyes and has  caused
much eye trouble among occult students.

   Figure No.  3A has Leo rising,  with the ruler,  the sun,  in conjunction
with and parallel to Mercury in the 8th house, and in the 12th house sign of
Pisces.   This position and aspect of the ruler would deplete  the  vitality
and create nervousness.   The boy would be easily disturbed and of a fretful
nature.  This would interfere with the assimilation of food in the small in-
testines,  for the conjunction of Mercury an the sun would have an effect in
the opposite sign of Virgo, the intestines.   But we find another affliction
which will have a much more evil effect upon the health.   Mars,  the planet
of dynamic energy,  also hot and fiery by nature, is posited in the airy and
nervous sign of Aquarius and in the 6th house,  ruling sickness.   Mars  af-
flicted  in this saturnine sign shows an evil side.   We find him square  to

a  swelling  of  the  tonsils?  The  affliction  coming  from  fixed  signs,
and Mars being in the 6th house, sickness, the trouble will be somewhat dif-
ficult  to  overcome,  for this physical weakness was brought  over  from  a
former life in which the soul had broken the laws of nature.  A case of this


[PAGE 118]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

kind is often the result of abuses of the most sacred function of the  body,
that of the generative organs.  The results of abortions,  or abuses of like
nature,  are often brought back into the next embodiment producing  weakened
organs.

   This boy could be helped greatly by manipulation and massage to keep  the
circulation normal.   The Piscean sun, conjunction Mercury, requires a quiet
and harmonious environment which we fear he will not have.  Jupiter in Scor-
pio supplies good food and plenty of it which,  however,  he should not  in-
dulge  in to excess.   A simple vegetarian diet will be most  necessary  for
him.  Saturn in Taurus would indicate that one of the parents will be apt to
interfere with his freedom too much.  A Leo can be ruined by the "don'ts" of
a saturnine parent,  and the boy would suffer in health as a result of  this
restriction by one parent and overindulgence of the other.

   Horoscope No. 3B is that of a little girl who suffered from the same ill-
ness as in the case of 3A, vis.,  the swelling of tonsils,  adenoids,  etc.,
but with very different astrological afflictions.  This shows how invaluable
the  study of astrology would be to the physician in his diagnosis and  that
it  is absolutely dangerous to treat each case alike.   What will  heal  one
might be dangerous to another.

   Here  we  have another fixed sign on the Ascendant,  Taurus,  ruling  the
throat, with its ruler, Venus, near the cusp of the 1st house and sextile to
Saturn,  but square to Neptune and in conjunction with Mars.   The  symptoms
would  be very similar to those of 3A,  but the trouble is from a  different
source.

   We  find Saturn,  the planet of obstruction,  in the sign of Cancer,  the
stomach.   Although this planet is not afflicted, yet wherever he is placed,
or whatever organ he rules over, there we may find a lack of fluids.  Saturn
"dries up"  and when he is in Cancer the appetite is abnormal and  digestive
fluid  is lacking.   He craves the things that are detrimental  and  refuses
those which the body needs,  and is very apt to gourmandize when the  palate
is tickled with pie,  cake, candy, etc.  The result is that the body becomes
clogged  like a stream dammed up:   the material must find an  outlet  some-
where.  In this case Mars, the planet of  energy,  is  in  conjunction  with

Venus,  the planet ruling the venous blood.   This indicates the section  of
the body that will be affected.  The blood becomes impure,  causing swelling
and inflammation in the throat.  To manipulate  this  afflicted region would

cause more inflammation.   The remedy here would be to discontinue all  food
for a day or two and give the girl only pineapple juice, putting the feet in
hot water with cold cloths on head and throat,  in order to draw the surplus
blood to the lower extremities.  This would give instant relief.

   Can  we  wonder,  after comparing two horoscopes of this  kind,  why  the
medical man often fails in his treatment and feels that the only cure is the
removal  of  the inflamed parts?   If he could read the stellar  script,  he
would make few failures and would then not be so apt to ruin the life of the
child by an operation.   He little realizes that a removal of the tonsils or
an operation upon the throat interferes with the function of the  generative
organs.   A child who has been operated upon will suffer as a result when it
reaches puberty.   Painful menstruation and trouble in childbirth are likely
to  affect  the  life  of  the woman who has  been  thus  operated  upon  in
childhood.  Inflammation of the prostate gland in the man, and various other
physical weaknesses are often the result of an operation upon the throat.

                         NO. 3C.--THROAT AND TONSILS

   Male, born July 11th, 1882, 11:15 A.M.

   Here  is given the horoscope of a man with the cardinal sign of Libra  on
the Ascendant,  and the ruler,  Venus,  in the fixed sign of Leo in the 11th
house,  square and parallel to both the malefics,  Saturn and Neptune.   The
last  two planets we find in the fixed sign of Taurus and in the 8th  house.
This  at the start is a very serious affliction,  indicating that  this  man
came into life facing a heavy debt of destiny.

   Now  let  us see if we can find the cause of the condition and  why  this
soul  has been restricted even from birth.   Leo and Taurus are  both  fixed
signs, stubborn and immovable, therefore they are also the signs which bring
chronic and incurable illnesses;  and where the afflictions come from two of
the most subtle planets,  both slow in their motion, one may expect that the
disease  is of a nature which the soul has attracted to itself as a debt  of
destiny by the breaking of nature's laws in past lives,  and not so much  on
account of misdeeds in this embodiment.

   Planets often work in opposite signs.   Afflictions as in this horoscope,
in  the  fixed sign of Taurus governing the throat,  may have  been  brought
about by the abuse of the generative function (Scorpio) in one life, causing
a weakness of the throat or larynx in the next life, or vice versa.  The un-
necessary  removal  of  the female organs in one life may cause the Ego, who

changes sex in each life, to be born in a male body with the afflicted plan-
ets in the opposite sign,  Taurus,  as in the case of this man who was  born
with underdeveloped organs of voice and throat.

   The  above statement does not mean that all women who have been  operated
on  will have these afflictions.   Often through childbirth,  or neglect  of
nurse or doctors,  the poor woman is forced to undergo an operation.   These
are conditions for which she is not held  accountable;  but  should  she  on

account  of  excesses or abortions have weakened the organs  of  sex,  which
would make it necessary for their removal,  such sins will bring their reac-
tion in restrictions of some kind,  usually of the throat which is under the
rule of Taurus, the opposite sign to Scorpio, which rules the generative or-
gans.   In fact the larynx and brain were developed in primitive man by  the
sacrifice of one half of the creative faculty.   Afflictions may not be  ac-
tive  in the body in childhood,  and with a knowledge of the planets  and  a
strict  adherence to the rules of right living,  man may pass  through  life
with but little inconvenience; but whenever the laws are broken, when abuses
are  allowed,  then it is that the afflicted parts give way,  for as  it  is
said, the chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

   We find the sun in Cancer,  which is the sign of the stomach,  sextile to
Neptune in Taurus,  the throat and palate,  also sextile to Uranus which  is
the ruler of the 5th house, the house of pleasures.  Venus is sextile to Ju-
piter.   All these facts show that this man has been very popular  with  his
women friends,  who have entertained him lavishly,  and the pleasures of the
table have helped in his undoing.

   The planet which helps to bring about physical ailments, the inflammatory
Mars, is in the sign of the intestines, Virgo, square to the moon in Gemini,
showing that the intestines suffered first from an excess of food and drink.
When the small intestines are inflamed, as they would be in this case,  they
are   unable   to   assimilate   food  properly.  This  inflammation  throws

considerable  poison into the blood,  which seeks an outlet in  the  weakest
spot.   Saturn conjunct Neptune in Taurus indicates that the throat received
the poison.   This man has had his throat lanced twice for what the  doctors
termed quinsy, an inflammation of the tonsils.  He has had pieces taken from
the tonsils, showing that the blood was contaminated, causing suppuration in
the tonsils.

   We  will consider here the horoscope of a girl with Virgo on  the  Ascen-
dant.   Virgo people have somewhat less resistance to disease than the aver-
age, especially when common signs occupy the four angles and Mercury and the
moon,  which rule the mentality,  are also in common signs and in opposition
to each other.   The three strongest planets, namely, the sun,  Saturn,  and
Mars, are in fixed signs.  We may expect that these planets will indicate in
what part of the body the disease will show itself.

   The sign of Taurus, we are told, in "THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS," page 541,
has rule over the neck, throat, tonsils,  the carotid arteries,  etc.   From
this  we  may infer that Taurus also has rule over the  veins  and  arteries
which serve the organs located in the throat;  likewise it has rule over the
lower  part of the occipital region of the jaw.   The arteries of the  human
body have their beginning in a common center.   The aorta is to the circula-
tory system what the trunk is to the tree.  All main arteries and veins have
a connection with the great human engine, the heart.   The aorta is the main
trunk  line,  from which many branches carry the blood to all parts  of  the
body, after which the veins carry it back to the heart.  These branches feed
the various parts of the body.  The  branch  in which we are most interested

in this lesson is the carotid artery, from which branch off the thyroid  ar-
teries, two in number, the superior and the inferior.

   In this horoscope we have the inflammatory Mars in Taurus.   Mars focuses
heat,  and  wherever this planet is placed we find an  abundance  of  blood.
Mars here is in the sign ruling the neck and afflicted by the conjunction of

Saturn,  the planet of obstruction.   Saturn has a drying-up effect upon the
parts which he influences.   The effect of these two malefic planets may  be
pictured  by  filling  a  rubber tube with water and closing both ends, then


[PAGE 128]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

pinching  one end of the tube and forcing the water into the other end.   We
may  expect this to be the condition of the blood in the arteries and  veins
of this girl's neck.  Mars fills them full of blood, and Saturn with his re-
stricting  influence holds the blood in one part,  obstructing its flow  and
resulting in enlarged veins of the neck, goitre, swollen tonsils, etc.  Sat-
urn and Mars are afflicted by a square from the life-giving sun.  The sun is
strong in its own home, Leo, which rules the vena cava,  the aorta,  and the
heart.

   At the age of eleven years this young girl suffered with goitre and swol-
len  tonsils,  having  constant trouble with the throat and  a  tendency  to
coughs  and  colds.   One important fact will be found in the case  of  most
children  with a tendency to throat trouble,  namely,  that they formed  the
habit when tiny babies of breathing through the mouth.  In nine cases out of
ten  of children who are suffering with diseased tonsils and throat  afflic-
tions they have not been taught to breathe through the nose.  Parents should
at  all  times watch small children,  and if they show a tendency  to  mouth
breathing  while asleep,  they should be given a solid rubber nipple,  minus
the  opening.   This will force the breath through the nostrils and  thereby
save the child much suffering in later years.

   With the sun in Leo,  square to Saturn and Mars,  this girl has a  latent
tendency  to valvular heart trouble.   This may not develop until  later  in
life when the Mars-conjunction-Saturn-in-Taurus temper has been permitted to

do its damage,  and Mercury in Virgo in opposition to the moon,  in the 12th
and 6th houses, the latter ruling the health, have made themselves felt.

   There is great hope in this horoscope,  however,  due to Saturn being  in
trine aspect to Mercury and sextile to the moon.  This will give balance and
also persistence to the mind,  which will help to stave off any illness  and
save the girl much suffering in later life.

   As  we  have no birth hour,  the signs are entered on the houses  in  nu-
merical  order so that Aries occupies the first house,  Taurus  the  second,
Gemini the third,  etc.  and the noon positions of the planets are used just
as they are given in the ephemeris.

   We will first note that the progressed position of the sun in 1916 is Leo
23-27, and that of Mercury is Leo 26-27, retrograde.

   The  aspects which particularly concern us are:   Moon parallel  Neptune,
square Jupiter, the sun and Mercury; Jupiter opposition the sun and Mercury;
Saturn parallel and conjunction Mars, squared by the progressed sun and Mer-
cury.

   We  will first acquaint ourselves with the condition of the mind of  this
woman.   Gemini and Sagittarius are the signs ruling mind.   Mercury is  es-
sentially dignified in Gemini, and Jupiter in Sagittarius.   The sun also is
favorably situated in the Mercurial sign Gemini.   So far so good,  but Mer-
cury, our significator of the mind, follows the sun and is too close to this
luminary; furthermore, Jupiter is in opposition to the sun and Mercury.  Add
to this that the moon, the other significator of the mind,  is square to Ju-
piter, the sun, and Mercury,  and  it will be apparent that the mental state

of the native is not a very happy or auspicious one.

   Saturn  is in Taurus,  the sign of the throat.   He is the planet of  ob-
struction and has always an inimical influence on whatever part of the  body
he  occupies  by  sign.  We  may  therefore  judge  that  the throat will be

obstructed,  causing hoarseness of speech; and we may also be sure that Sat-
urn has an effect in the opposite sign Scorpio, which governs the generative
and eliminative organs.  Saturn is cold, clammy, and moist.  Mars is hot and


[PAGE 132]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

and dry.   He is posited in the sign Taurus,  closely conjoined and parallel
with Saturn,  giving a tendency to inflammation and swelling.  In the region
governed  by  the opposite sign he would produce scaling urine  and  copious
menses.

   Thus  to inimical forces of opposite natures have been at war in the  re-
gion of the throat from birth on,  but the case did not become really  acute
until  1914.   Then the moon by progression reached the  opposition  of  the
radical  sun and Mercury,  and at the same time the sun by progression  came
within orb of a square to Saturn and Mars from the sign Leo,  which  governs
the  heart.   The  keynote of Saturn is obstruction,  and in  Taurus  he  is
particularly  powerful with respect to the heart action for he  governs  the
pneumogastric nerve which produces cardiac inhibition.   On the other  hand,
when  the dynamic energy of Mars is directed by a square to  the  progressed
sun in Leo violent palpitation is bound to be the effect.  Thus the enormous
range of heart action attendant upon exophthalmic goitre is produced in this
case.   We also find that Saturn is near a conjunction with the Peliades lo-
cated in Taurus 29,  and his square to the progressed sun has an effect upon
the eyes, which protrude in people affected with exophthalmic goitre.

   The  configurations  of the significators of  mind  previously  mentioned
couples  with the absence of radical squares and oppositions to  Saturn  and
Mars  indicate  that the basic cause of the patient's condition  is  mental.
The diagnosis is further confirmed by the fact that the  acute condition was

brought  about by the above noted progressed positions of the sun  and  Mer-
cury.  As this affliction is from a fixed sign there is danger that the con-
dition may become chronic.   If the person,  however,  is placed in a quiet,
cheerful environment and if she can be taught to wean herself from her  mor-
bid  imagination,  there is a good chance of a permanent cure  being  accom-
plished when the sun gets out of orb of its square to Saturn and Mars,  par-
ticularly if the proper diet is adopted.

   This is truly so in the life of the soul whose horoscope we are to  study
here.

   With the fixed,  Saturnine sign of Aquarius on the Ascendant and the sec-
ond ruler of Aquarius, the inspirational and advanced Uranus, in Pisces, in-
tercepted in the first house, we may say that there are really two rulers of
this horoscope:   Saturn,  which is in its fall in the seventh house in Leo,
and Uranus, which is strong in the occult sign of Pisces in the first house.

   Planets in angles have a greater influence on the life of the native than
when  they are in cadent or succedent houses.   Planets which are  in  fixed
signs and afflicted also bring with them a debt of destiny, which is usually
most difficult to overcome.

   In this horoscope we find Mercury in the fixed sign of Taurus,  square to
the obstinate and obstructive planet, Saturn, which is in Leo, a fixed sign,
and in the seventh house angle.

   Saturn being one of the life rulers, though in the sign of its fall, will

have the post powerful rule over the life,  and when Mercury and Saturn  are
afflicting  each other from bestial signs, namely,  Taurus and Leo,  we  may
look for an impediment in the speech.

   This boy at the age of five years refused to talk.   He is able to speak,
but will do so only when the greatest persuasion is used.

   Doctors have operated on him twice for water on the brain but have failed
to  find anything wrong,  and what the effect of these operations  may  have
upon the organism in the future remains to be seen.  Up to the present time,

however, the health of the boy has been normal.

   He will repeat only the sentences which are suggested to him,  but if the
parents are persistent they may in time help him to overcome his weakness.

   On page 154, in the COSMO-CONCEPTION we are told:  "What we are,  what we
have,  all our good qualities are the result of our own actions in the past.
What we lack in physical, moral, or mental excellence may yet be ours in the
future."

   This boy has truly taken up his life where he laid it down in a  previous
one.   The planets are the clock of destiny, which shows when each soul must
needs learn certain lessons,  when it must reap from the seeds which it  has
sown in its past lives.

   We  learn in the Rosicrucian teachings that we are in this life  here  on
earth  preparing to build the archetype of the body which we are to  use  in
our next life.  In the case of this poor soul as we look back into his past,
we  see where in his keen desire for spiritual development he  neglected  to
build his physical body by mortifying the flesh and neglected to use the or-
gans of speech,  being a member of a silent Brotherhood.   In which the life
was spent in silence and prayer.  In this extremely one-sided life he devel-
oped the spiritual faculties at the expense of the physical senses.

   We  see here the mystical Uranus is in the sign of Pisces,  in the  first
house, trine to the moon, which is in its own sign of Cancer.  Neptune,  an-
other spiritual planet, is parallel to Mercury and  sextile  to Mars and the

sun,  indicating a soul who is highly developed along spiritual  lines,  but
one who is lacking in the ability to use his development in this life on ac-
count of the lack of desire to use the organs of speech.


   This child may,  however,  be assisted by the parents in developing  this
desire,  but it will require great patience, as the mentality, on account of
Mercury  square Saturn,  will be slow to respond,  and the boy will be  very
stubborn,  because  of this aspect being from fixed signs.   Mars,  however,
which is in the Mercurial sign of Gemini,  will lend its assistance in over-
coming the influence of Saturn to some extent.

                         NO. 3G.--THE LOSS OF SPEECH
                Male, born December 19th, 1896, at 12:30 A.M.

   The  young man whose horoscope we will analyze here has the cardinal  and
airy  sign of Libra on the Ascendant.   Physically he expresses the sign  of
Libra,  being six feet in height,  splendidly developed and  with  beautiful
blue  eyes.   People with cardinal or fixed signs on the  angles  have  more
power of resistance than others.   The will is stronger than that of  common
signs.  In the case of this young man, however, we find an affliction active
before he reached the age where he could be of assistance to the healers.

   In  the  COSMO-CONCEPTION  we are told that in the  latter  part  of  the
Lemurian  Epoch man's body became upright,  this being necessary  before  he
would become an indwelling,  self-conscious being,  and certain changes then
had  to take place in the bodily structure in order that the Ego  might  ex-
press  itself  through its vehicles.   When the Ego entered within  its  ve-
hicles,  it  was necessary that part of the sex force be used to  build  the
brain and larynx, for it was destined that man should henceforth learn to do
his own thinking, and the voice was necessary that he might make himself un-
derstood and thereby communicate with others.  To accomplish this a part  of
his sex force had to be used.  So a part of the creative organ remained with
the  upper  portion  of  the  body,  and  was  gradually converted into what

now  constitutes the brain and larynx.   Thus we may see that there must  of
necessity be a close connection between these organs, namely, the generative
organs, larynx, and brain.

   It is interesting to note through astrology  how this works out.  We find

the  throat  and larynx.   Proof of the above close connection may  also  be
found  in  the boy whose voice changes at puberty; also in the woman who has

had her ovaries removed and whose voice becomes deep and harsh.

   In the horoscope under consideration we find Saturn,  the planet of atro-
phy,  in the sign of Scorpio.  Saturn is in conjunction with Uranus.   These
two  planets  are unaspected save by the conjunction with each other  and  a
semi-sextile to the sun.  And this we must consider as a condition which had
its beginning in a past life.  When we find Uranus and Saturn in conjunction
in Scorpio and afflicted by other planets,  we look for perversion or abnor-
mal  sex expression.   But in reading these two planets we go into the  past
life for the abuses which have weakened the organs, causing the poor soul to
come  into this life with the larynx and brain each unable to function  nor-
mally.

   With  Saturn conjunction Uranus in Scorpio we may look for its effect  in
the opposite sign of Taurus,  the throat.  Saturn then has a tendency to re-
tard or restrict the secretion of the fluids of the glands or organs  within
the region of the neck,  for instance, the thyroid,  which is placed astride
the  windpipe at the front of the neck,  and which may truly be  called  the
balance necessary for the proper functioning of the mind.   The thyroid also
regulates all the other ductless glands, and every drop of blood in the cir-
culation  in  the upper part of the body passes back and forth  through  it.
Excesses  or  perversions of sex deplete the fluids of  the  thyroid  gland.
What  a telltale the human voice is!   How the misuse of sex will  make  the
male voice effeminate and the female voice masculine!


[PAGE 141]                                                        THE THROAT

   In  this horoscope we have the story of a man who at birth had  a  voice,
but after the age of four years he would not make a sound, nor has he spoken
a word since.   The organs ruling the voice in this case have been  weakened
by the dissipation of the sex fluids in a former life.  We find Neptune, the
higher octave of Mercury, the planet ruling the pineal gland,  in the mercu-
rial sign of Gemini,  in conjunction with the moon and Mars,  and in opposi-
tion  to  the sun.   Neptune has rule over the pineal gland and  the  spinal
spirit fire.   The brain in this case has remained childlike.  The young man
dresses himself but he will not speak, and he spends his entire  time  turn-
ing the leaves of books.

   Truly,  the spirit encased in this limited vehicle is learning  some  re-
markable lessons--lessons which are likely to bring it back in its next  em-
bodiment as a childlike, virtuous woman.

                            NO. 4A.--TUBERCULOSIS

   THE horoscope here shown is that of a well-to-do man who spoiled his life
by excesses of all kinds.  He was born on August 28, 1881, at 11 P.M.

   In the first place we find Jupiter, the planet of opulence,  in the  12th
house,  that of sorrow,  trouble,  and self-undoing,  sextile to Venus,  the
planet of attraction, in Cancer, the sign ruling the stomach, and in the 2nd
house, that of finance.  This accounts for the native's business instinct in
money matters as well as his desire for rich and unhealthful foods; in part,
too,  for his fatal weakness for the opposite sex.  The moon square to Venus
from the fifth house,  the house of pleasures, also Mars,  the planet of dy-
namic  energy,  conjunct the saturnine Dragon's Tail,  and  both  square  to
Uranus,  the  planet of unconventionality and clandestine  attachments,  are
other strong testimonies in the latter direction.  Furthermore, Saturn,  the
planet  of  obstruction,  in  the 12th house, that of sorrow, in conjunction

with Neptune,  the planet of underhandedness, in Taurus,  which is the oppo-
site of Scorpio,  the sign governing the sex organs,  shows trouble in  that
region and also in the throat.

consequent  clogging up of the system.  Venus in Cancer,  the latter  ruling
the stomach,  gives a love of good things to eat,  and especially to  drink.

ination.   The  conjunction  of  Saturn,  the  planet  of  obstruction, with
Neptune in the sign Taurus, this sign having  a  reflex  action  in Scorpio,
resulted  in painful hemorrhoids.   Mars,  the  planet  of  dynamic  energy,
conjoined with the saturnine Dragon's  Tail  in  Gemini, the sign ruling the
lungs, square to Uranus, the planet of spasmodic  action,  shows  a tendency
to coughs and weakness of the lungs, which finally destroyed the life.

   This horoscope is a lesson on the ravages of excess and indulgence of the
lower  nature,  and  astrologers may use it for the  purpose  of  convincing
people  who  are on the downward path that the way of  the  transgressor  is
hard, and that our sins will surely find us out.

   By  the  exercise of will power,  at least a great deal  of  the  trouble
indicated might have been avoided.  Toward the last the man realized that he
was going down and wanted help, but he was too weak to cease from his indul-
gences.   Consequently he yielded to the tendencies shown in his  horoscope,
and became the victim of tuberculosis and a number of complications.

   Female, born June 16, 1884, 8:30 A.M.

   Suffering from tuberculosis is shown very plainly by this horoscope,  for
Saturn,  the planet of obstruction and crystallization,  is in  Gemini,  the
sign  which  rules the lungs.   Although he is unaspected he  always  has  a
malefic  bodily influence in whatever part of the chart he is  placed.   His
obstructive  and  hardening tendencies clog and crystallize  the  lungs  and
would  be inimical even if he were not supported by evil aspects.   We  find
that the sun,  which is the giver of life, is also in Gemini,  square to the
moon, which is the particular significator of health in a woman's horoscope.
The  moon is placed in the 8th house,  the house of death,  in  pisces,  the
twelfth sign, ruling confinement in hospitals and kindred institutions.  The
sun is also square to the spasmodic Uranus,  and Uranus is in opposition  to
the moon.   This will produce the cough and the hemorrhage which are part of
the symptoms of tuberculosis.

   Leo,  the strong solar sign, is rising, and Jupiter,  the planet of opti-
mism and joviality,  is therein sextile to Mercury, the planet of reason and
mind.   We  may also note that all the angles are occupied by  fixed  signs.
These  conditions show that in the first place the constitution was  a  good
one,  that  the  native  had  to  begin with a strong, vigorous nature and a

jovial  sunny and friendly disposition.   Had this horoscope been set up  in
childhood's  days so that one could have worked with the native ad  counter-
acted  the tendencies to tuberculosis,  the chances are that she would  have
entirely  outgrown  this  tendency.  As  it  is,  however,  the  squares and

oppositions  of the sun, moon, and Uranus taken  together  with  the  moon's
placement in the 8th house and the 12th house sign  show  that  this case is
likely   to  terminate  fatally.    The  best  that  can  be  done  for  the

   BY mistake this chart was first set up so that Leo occupied the Ascendant
end the sun was in the fifth house.  The planets show the affliction no mat-
ter what sign rises,  but a glance showed the figure to be erroneous because
the sun cannot be in the fifth house at four o'clock in the morning.   So we
had it calculated again,  with the result that we find Saturn in the  eighth
house instead of in the eleventh and the sun in the second house instead  of
the  fifth.   This makes a great deal of difference in the strength  of  the
symptoms.   We would advise students that whenever they are given  a  figure
for  judgment it is wise precaution always to look at the place of  the  sun
and  notice  if its location in the horoscope corresponds  with  its  actual
place in the sky at the time of day when the birth took place.   If it  does
not,  that is evidence that the horoscope has been incorrectly set up and is
therefore  unfit to be used as a basis of judgment.   We are all  liable  to
make  mistakes in our calculations but this hint will undoubtedly help  stu-
dents to avoid this particular mistake.

   The subject of this horoscope is suffering from tuberculosis,  a  disease
neither necessarily serious nor fatal.  The student of  Astro-Diagnosis  has

special facilities for judging how deeply the disease is rooted by the posi-
tions and aspects of the afflicting planets.  Saturn, the planet of obstruc-
tion,  in Gemini, the sign which rules the lungs, shows the tendency to cold
in  the lungs and also hardening such as occurs in tuberculosis.   But  this

in  the  eleventh  house,  instead  of its  position  in  the true horoscope

   Mercury,  the ruler of Gemini, is in opposition to Saturn,  and so is the
life-giving sun.   We may also note that the moon,  which governs the  tidal
air  in  the lungs,  is in conjunction with Venus,  which rules  the  venous
blood,  and is square to Uranus.   All these are signs which show that there
is comparatively little hope of escape for this patient from the dread  dis-
ease until death looses the silver cord and frees him from the body.

   You will notice that the last degrees of Libra are rising so that the na-
tive has really more of the impulsive Scorpio characteristics than those  of
Libra.  Mars, ruler of Scorpio, in Leo adds to his energy and makes him fond
of swaggering and showing off, prodigal of his vitality.  Mars trine Mercury
in  Sagittarius  shows an inclination for sport and  probably  overexertion,
which  may  have  been  responsible  for  the  first  breakdown  about   the
twenty-eighth  year  when  the progressed moon was over  the  place  of  the
radical moon and Venus,  or the year preceding when it was in opposition  to
Saturn.

   It  would  be extreme cruelty to tell the patient that  there  is  little
hope,  of  course,  and  no aspirant to invisible  helpership  would  be  so
thoughtless, but would strive to make his lot as easy as possible during the
remaining  time,  though realizing that whatever measures were  taken  would
only palliate but not cure.   Meanwhile, it should be made clear to the per-
son that there is a spiritual reason for disease and that occult  investiga-
tions have established the fact that a materialistic conception of life in a

previous  embodiment is a fruitful source of just such a condition  as  this
one,  for by the thought that death ends all, the materialist gradually puts
himself out of tune with all activities in the spiritual world.  When he en-
ters the Second Heaven where the archetypes of new bodies are built, he puts
all his crystallizing thoughts into the new vehicle,  which is then born un-
der the hardening rays of Saturn,  who in some way obstructs the life-giving
sun.   If such a patient can be taught to believe this and become a  devoted
Christian, he will be saved a similar fate in a future life.

   Aquarius,  a fixed and airy sign, is on the Ascendant.   The fiery planet
Mars  is just above the cusp in the 12th house,  and the plastic and  watery
moon is in the same sign in the first house.   This gave this young woman  a
very  strange  nature,  for there is a great  difference  between  the  tem-
peraments given by the moon and Mars.  Mars on the Ascendant afflicted by  a
parallel to the ruler,  the impulsive Uranus,  gave the native a very impul-
sive nature.  It indicates one who would fly into a fit of rage at the least
provacation.  The two natures given by Mars and the moon were continually at
war with each other,  the one impulsive, energetic,  dynamic,  and the other
restless,  plastic, and changeable.  The moon, however, is trine to the sun,
which gave a soft, peaceable, kindly nature, directly opposed to the martial
temperament.  The restless, critical Mercury is placed near the Midheaven in

the martial sign of Scorpio; this added to the temper.

   Planets  when situated in angles and in fixed signs,  as are  several  in
this horoscope,  have a larger orb than otherwise, and we give eight degrees
or  a  little  more  to  the major planets in such cases.  We would consider

Jupiter  here  to be in opposition to Mars.   Venus is in square  aspect  to
Mars,  and Mercury is parallel to Venus and square to Jupiter.   With  Venus
ruling the venous blood and Jupiter the arterial blood, both being afflicted
by  Mars  and  Jupiter  by  Mercury  also,  this  young  woman suffered from


[PAGE 154]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

restricted circulation,  especially due to the fact that the afflictions are
all  from fixed signs and angles,  which affected the action of  the  heart.
With  her high-strung,  nervous temperament and uncontrolled fits of  temper
she precipitated an attack of heart trouble each time she permitted  herself
to be ruled by this emotion.

   There  are also indications of in harmony in the home,  for we  find  the
rulers of the 10th and 4th houses, Venus and Mars,  in square aspect.   Mars
is also the ruler of the 3rd house,  which stands for sisters and  brothers.
The above aspect would indicate that this young girl was greatly  domineered
by those in the home, and being of a very impulsive and dominant nature her-
self,  this provoked much display of temper, which was very injurious to the
health of one with the above planetary configurations.

   In 1917 the progressed sun reached the square to the radical Mars,  while
the progressed Mars was in conjunction with the Ascendant.   The result  was
that a chronic condition of heart trouble set in which slowly led to dropsy,
for restricted heart action frequently bring about other complications.  The
doctors,  unfortunately, were unable to diagnose the disease correctly,  and
she  was treated for Bright's disease.  In 1921 the progressed moon  reached
the opposition to its radical place at birth.  This opposition usually marks
the  beginning  of puberty,  and is sometimes a critical  period  for  young
girls, especially when Venus and Jupiter are both afflicted.  When  the moon

passed through Leo,  the sign of the heart,  while making the opposition  to
its radical place, it aggravated the dropsy, for the moon in Leo or Aquarius
has a tendency to cause dropsy in a patient suffering with heart trouble.

   Uranus,  the planet of impulse and the higher octave of Venus, which also
has an influence over the circulatory system, is in opposition to Neptune in
Cancer,  th sign ruling the stomach.   Neptune is in the 6th house,  health;
this would indicate that there was trouble with the digestive organs and  an
abnormal desire for indigestible food.

   The young woman's parents called upon Headquarters for healing after  the
doctors  had given her up.   They were told that the case was hopeless;  she
passed out three weeks after she was put on our healing list.   The case was
an incurable one when it reached our hands.  She died in February, 1921.  We
may  here  see how powerful afflictions are and how difficult to  over  some
when they are from fixed signs and in the angles.   This was truly a debt of
destiny which this soul was called upon to pay,  and it was beyond the power
of the Invisible Helpers.

                           NO. 5B.--HEART; KIDNEYS

   Male, born October 25, 1862, at 5:20 A.M.

   WE  will use here the horoscope of a man with Libra on the Ascendant  and
cardinal signs on all the angles.  The planet of obstruction, Saturn, is ex-
alted in Libra, and is placed in the twelfth house.  Saturn is in opposition
to Mars and Neptune.   Mars and Neptune are in conjunction and parallel with
each other.  We have here three malefic planets, one in the 12th house, rul-
ing hospitals, and two in the 6th house, the house of sickness.  The twelfth
and  the  sixth houses are very dangerous positions for  planets  afflicting
each other by opposition.

   Saturn in Libra,  when afflicted,  causes obstruction of the renal secre-
tions,  and lack of these secretions disturbs the chemical laboratory of the
kidneys.   Poisons are thrown off by the blood after it passes  through  the
renal arteries to the kidneys, where it is purified and undergoes a thorough
filtering  process,  leaving  its poisons such  as  urea,  phosphoric  acid,
sulphuric acid,  potash,  lime,  and other refuse matter which it has  taken
from the food.

   If  the kidneys are healthy,  these organs receive enough water from  the
flood to dissolve these poisonous secretions, which are then washed out from
the  kidneys  as  urine.  But  in  a case such as we have for our diagnosis,

where  Saturn is afflicted in Libra,  this washing out is not  fully  accom-
plished.   The kidneys retain some of these poisonous secretions,  which be-
come hardened mineral matter.   In course of time a hardening process devel-
ops  and  the  kidneys  refuse to function properly.  The result is that the

blood is not purified,  and this mineral matter is lodged in the blood  ves-
sels, which become clogged, and the circulation becomes impaired.

   The eyes are closely  allied with the kidneys, and when the latter organs


[PAGE 158]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

are sluggish and filled with mineral matter, the eyesight becomes impaired.

   People with Mars in Aries have a desire to drink much liquid,  as in  the
case  of this man,  who was afflicted with an unquenchable thirst.   As  the
kidneys were not able to extract the excess water from the blood,  this liq-
uid,  which was not eliminated through the skin, remained in the blood,  and
in time the man suffered from palpitation of the heart and dropsy.  his case
was diagnosed by the doctors as heart disease.   People suffering with  this
affliction have very scanty and very highly colored urine.

   If a case of this kind is taken in time,  the kidneys can be flushed  and
the poisons eliminated by a proper diet.  String beans, carrots,  asparagus,
and  tomatoes are most helpful in stimulating the kidneys and  assisting  in
the elimination of water.  Onions are astringents, and where there is an ex-
cess of urine,  the onion will regulate it.   Therefore it is very necessary
that the vegetables be properly chosen to work against and not with the dis-
ease.

   "We shape, ourselves, the joy or fear
   Of which the coming life is made,
   And fill our Futures' atmosphere

   We weave with colors all our own

had  fixed signs on the four angles and five planets therein.   This is  the
sign of a strong soul, a man who will never lean on anyone,  but who will be
a doer, a lifter; as such he spent his life.  This was a man who carried his
cross  willingly  and  who bore the stripes of the cruelties  of  the  world
uncomplainingly.  One with such signs on the angles  and with the planets as

strongly placed as in this horoscope and afflicting one another surely finds
his life full of lessons, and many responsibilities are placed upon him.

   In  his home he was most unhappy, as we see from Mercury  in  conjunction
with the Dragon's Tail in Scorpio in the 4th house.  This indicates that the
wife was a nagger and a scold.  Mercury in Scorpio shows that the wife would
never permit the husband to have a moment's peace.   Then we find Saturn  in
Cancer.   Cancer is the natural fourth house sign.   Saturn is square to Ve-
nus, again indicating a masterful and discordant marriage partner.  With Ju-
piter in the seventh house, in opposition to the moon and mars and square to
Uranus,  marriage and partnership are shown to be accompanied by many trials
and much opposition.

   In spite of all this we find that this man achieved quite a fortune,  did
a big work, and made many friends.  He was a leader in Masonry, where he did
many kind acts, helping the widow and orphan generously with his money.   He
was deeply interested in prison work and also in occult studies.  Neptune in
Pisces,  sextile to Uranus, shows his interest in occultism,  but both these
planets are retrograde, which brought him all kinds of restrictions.  He was
never free to follow his higher ideals.

   With his many crosses,  hard work, and disappointments he developed heart
trouble of a very serious nature,  and for years he used heart stimulants so
as  to  keep  at  his  work.  He  never  allowed  his physical sufferings to


[PAGE 162]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

interfere with his business,  however,  which was of a very responsible  na-
ture,  with many branches scattered over a large pat of America; also he had
many men under him.  With leakage of the valves of the heart and in spite of
the  resulting suffering he lived to the ripe old age of seventy years.   We
may  see  from this that the will can be used to overcome and  that  man  is
truly  the master of his fate.   Had this man had Virgo on the Ascendant  or
some  other sign less strong than Leo,  together with the  afflictions  from
fixed signs,  he would have become a confirmed invalid or have passed out as
a young man.  Hence we may see that "the wise man rules his stars;  the fool
is ruled by them."

   Male, born September 12, 1858, 8:15 A.M.


   OUR first concern when diagnosing this horoscope is to ascertain the men-
tal caliber of the patient.   Jupiter placed in the house of the higher mind
and  Mars  near the cusp of the house of the lower mind are  in  opposition,
also square to the sun and Mercury, a fact which stamps the native as a pes-
simist  of an irritable nature.   This is accentuated by the  opposition  of
mercury to Neptune, the lower mind being out of tune with all spiritual con-
cepts.   Saturn square Venus prevents the native from seeing the  beauty  of
life.   As  these adverse testimonies are only counterbalanced by  the  moon
sextile Mercury and the sun,  and trine Neptune,  we may conclude that  this
person is in a sad state and needs all the help and cheer it is possible  to
bring  him.   We  are afraid that even the best efforts  will  avail  little
against such a barrier of pessimism as he has built around himself.

   Regarding the disease to which he is subject,  the cold hand of Saturn in
leo shows us the obstructed heart action, and the consequent sluggish circu-
lation is designated by the square of Saturn to Venus and the square of  the
sun  and Mercury to Jupiter,  for Jupiter and Venus govern the arterial  and
venous  circulations respectively.   Uranus sextile Saturn produces a  spas-
modic action felt as a fluttering of the heart;  and being posited in Gemini

he also imparts a spasmodic motion to the lungs,  making it at times  diffi-
cult for the patient to breathe, though the condition is not so well defined
as  in  asthma.  The  affliction  of  the  sun  and  Mercury  in  Virgo  op-

position  Neptune  indicates intestinal trouble.  The affliction of the  sun
and Mercury by Jupiter and Mars from the houses of travel,  also the opposi-
tion  of the last named planets, show a predisposition to  accidents,  espe-
cially when on a journey.  With this phase of the  indications  we  are not,

however, concerned at the present time.

   We may bend our efforts to accelerate the action of the heart and promote
impaired digestion in order to give the person relief and a brighter outlook
upon life.   As Saturn controls the pneumogastric nerve, his presence in Leo
shows us that this is the principal set of the trouble, for his nerve inhib-
its the heart action and acts also upon other vital organs.  It is difficult
to reach this nerve in an efficient manner when we are clothed in our  dense
bodies.   But the conscientious Rosicrucian health adjuster has other  means
at his disposal, for his Obligation to himself taken before the Elder Broth-
ers enables him to work upon his patients during the hours when his body  is
sleeping.   And he is taught how he may materialize fingers inside the  body
of the ailing and thus give the needed help to remove obstructions, growths,
etc.; yes, even to adjust displaced bones.  We receive many letters at Head-
quarters  from patients who sense the presence of the Invisible Helpers  and
the withdrawal of hands from their bodies at the moment when they awake.

   The  best method to treat such a case as this would be for the healer  to
thoroughly  impress upon his or her mind where the seat of the malady is  to
be found,  physiologically and astrologically.   Then after retrospection in
the evening say,  "Now,  I will go to help my patient under the direction of
the Elder Brothers," letting that be the last waking thought.

   The healer best fitted to take charge  of  this  case  would be one whose

rising  sign is in harmony with Libra.   Aquarius would be the first  choice
and  Gemini the second.   It is further required that he or she  should  not
have Saturn in Libra or Pisces.

   HERE we have a horoscope with the energetic, active,  and aggressive sign
of Scorpio on the Ascendant,  with the life ruler,  Mars,  in the 1st  house
within  orb  of the Ascendant and in its own sign,  where a planet  has  the
greatest power either for good or evil.  In the case of this woman this mar-
tial energy is dissipated and not kept under control, for the planet Mars is
in  opposition to the erratic and impulsive Uranus which is posited  in  the
7th house in the fixed sign of Taurus where it is in its fall and  therefore
apt to show its evil side.  The combined influence of Mars and Uranus,  both
being planets of impulse,  acts like a fire fanned by the wind which has got
beyond control.

   We find the water moon near the Midheaven in the hot,  fiery,  and  fixed
sign of Leo, and this planet is in square aspect to both  the  above planets

the  planets of fire to the watery and emotional moon has a  similar  effect
upon the mind of this woman.  Mars in Scorpio afflicted and on the Ascendant

gives an uncontrolled temper,  showing a woman who would fly into a rage  at
the  least provocation and this anger is apt to be directed toward the  mar-
riage partner.  If we place a kettle of water on a fire which is kept fanned
into a red heat, in time the  water  boils  down,  the  bottom of the kettle

becomes dry and burns out.  In this state we find this woman.  For years she
has  created such a nervous and emotional environment about her in her  home
that the poor heart has been burned and scorched,  for the moon afflicted in
Leo indicates that the heart has been under a great strain.   The result  is
that  in the year 1916 when the progressed moon reached the  conjunction  of
the radical Mars in the 1st house and later the opposition of Uranus in  the
7th  house (indicating the husband), domestic relations reached  a  critical
point.  With the progressed Venus, Mercury, sun, and moon all transiting the
1st house and in the martial sign of Scorpio,  the resulting fiery  emotions
were too much for the body,  and the poor woman lost all control of herself.
She wanted to cry all the time, she could not digest her food, and would of-
ten swoon away with heart trouble.

   There is, however, another cause for this physical break.  We find a won-
derfully  strong  and well fortified Neptune in its own sign  of  Pisces  in
theoccult  4th house,  in sextile to Jupiter and Uranus and trine  to  Mars.
These  aspects,  especially  the sextile between  the  two  occult  planets,
Neptune  and Uranus,  ordinarily give a strong desire for development  along
mystical lines and would cause one to develop rapidly.   But Neptune is mak-
ing a square to Saturn, and Uranus is square to the moon.   Evil aspects be-
tween planets as well as good will bring development but the development  is
of a different nature.

   As we have often stated in our lessons,  anger and evil emotions are much
more  injurious to a person who is endeavoring to live the higher life  than
if he were content to drift and be of the earth earthy.  Each time that this
woman gave way to her anger she set in motion a counter-clockwise vibration,
a  fire  that burned up the spiritual life that had been awakened,  and  the
poor body could not stand the strain.  She cannot long continue placing this
strain  upon the heart,  for with the squares and opposition of Mars,  moon,
and Uranus from angles and fixed signs,  the heart will not be able to stand
the strain and death may be very sudden.

                  NO. 6A.--STOMACH TROUBLE AND TUBERCULOSIS

   In the  diagnosis  of disease by the science of the stars it is sometimes
most difficult to know in what direction the afflictions may work.   For in-
stance,  we have so often written of the sinister effects of Saturn in  Can-
cer,  the sign which has rule over the stomach.   When he afflicts  in  this
sign  he robs the stomach of its gastric juice,  which is necessary for  the
digestion of the food.  Saturn in this place has also a tendency to create a
desire for unhealthful foods and leads to the excessive use of cream, sugar,
desserts, etc.  But in this lesson and the next we will endeavor to show how
Saturn  when placed in the opposite sign,  Capricorn--in which Saturn is  at
home and where his influence is much more subtle and malevolent than when he
is in the sign of Cancer--has similar effects.

   We will use two horoscopes by which we will show the effects of Saturn in
Capricorn  whereby  diseases are produced of vastly different  natures.   We
will  first use horoscope 6A, which is that of a man born February 19, 1902,
3:00 P.M.

   We find Saturn in 23-21 of Capricorn in the 6th house which has rule over
the health.  Saturn is in opposition to the moon.  This last named planet is
in its own sign of Cancer, the sign ruling the stomach.  The moon is also in
opposition  to  Jupiter.  When  Jupiter  has  any  connection  with signs or

planets which rule the appetite, he creates a desire for food in large quan-
tities.  Whatever Jupiter does must be on a big scale; with the moon and Ju-
piter in opposition we may look for the gourmand.


[PAGE 172]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

   With  Saturn afflicted in Capricorn the gastric juice of the  stomach  is
sluggish, and we may expect trouble in the digestion of the food.

   If  the stomach is filled with an excess of rich food,  the man will  re-
ceive  nourishment  from only that part which the stomach can  digest.   The
blood is carried to the lungs to be oxygenated.   Oxygenation is to the body
what the draft is to the stove.   If we shut off the draft,  we smother  and
kill the fire,  and so it is in the body.  If man stops breathing,  he dies.
In shallow breathing the lungs are not able to supply sufficient oxygen  for
warmth and energy, and they do not exhale all the carbon dioxide.

   In  this horoscope we find Neptune in Gemini.   Gemini has rule over  the
lungs.   Neptune is on the cusp of the 12th house in opposition to Uranus in
the 5th house in Sagittarius.   Uranus and Neptune when afflicted indicate a
nervous, cramping, spasmodic action.  Neptune here indicates that the capil-
laries of the lungs were incapable of taking the amount of oxygen  necessary
to oxygenate the blood.   Consequently the carbon dioxide formed faster than
the lungs were able to exhale it.   The result was that poison was stored up
in  the system.   The nerve cells became weak and sluggish,  and  little  by
little  the body became lowered in resistive power;  the weakest  organ  was
then unable to keep up with its work.   The bellows of the body,  the lungs,
in the case of this man were unable to inhale enough air to burn up the poi-
sons.  The result was the lungs became diseased and tuberculosis set in.


[PAGE 173]                                                       THE STOMACH

   People with planets afflicted in common signs are frequently  susceptible
to tuberculosis.   With the sun and Mars in conjunction in Pisces,  and with
Uranus  in  Sagittarius in opposition to Neptune in  Gemini--Pisces,  Sagit-
tarius,  and Gemini being common signs--the lungs as a consequence attracted
the impurities.   hence we can see that Saturn in either Cancer or Capricorn
may be the direct cause of disease which expresses itself in another sign.

   Three years ago this man began to suffer with stomach trouble,  which has
now been followed by tuberculosis of the lungs,  a disease which had its be-
ginning in wrong eating.   It can at this stage be cured by a very carefully
chosen diet of raw vegetables and fruits and very little protein.

   We will in our next lesson take up Horoscope 6B, which has Saturn in Cap-
ricorn, but which has its outcome in a quite different disease.

                 STOMACH TROUBLE AND INFLAMMATION OF KIDNEYS

   Horoscope 6B is that of a man born February 26, 1871, 4 P.M.

   This will be a continuation of the lesson on the effect of Saturn in Cap-
ricorn, showing how this planet may express its evil side through the planet
which it aspects adversely.

   We find Saturn,  the planet of obstruction,  in the sign of Capricorn,  a
cardinal  sign.   Signs of the like nature,  especially the cardinal  signs,
have an affinity for one another and respond to afflictions more readily  on
that account.   In this horoscope Saturn is in Capricorn,  square to Mars in
Libra,  both cardinal signs.   Libra rules the kidneys and the little  ducts
leading from the kidneys to the bladder,  the ureters.   Where we find  Mars
afflicted  we may look for heat and excessive action.   Saturn in  Capricorn
gives  tendencies  similar  to those which  he  gives  in  Cancer--perverted
tastes,  desire  for strange and unnatural foods,  and a liking  for  sugar,
pastries, etc.

   Saturn in Capricorn also obstructs the flow of the gastric juices in  the
stomach,  hence we can see why people with an afflicted Saturn in tropic  or
cardinal signs,  namely, Capricorn or Cancer, are often afflicted with indi-
gestion, rheumatism, uric acid deposits, etc.  When we find the inflammatory
Mars in the cardinal sign of Libra, square to  Saturn  in  Capricorn, we may

expect  that the poisonous elements which are left undigested to ferment  in
the  stomach will lodge in the kidneys,  creating highly acid  urine,  which
causes inflammation in the kidneys and ureters.

   In  this horoscope we find the moon in Gemini,  square to the sun in  Pi-
sces.   Gemini and Pisces, being common signs, here obstruct the oxygenation
of the blood and interfere with its purification,  hence more impurities are
sent to the kidneys from this source.  Thus  we  may  see  the similarity of

same.

the  saturnine influence to bear upon the impulse and quick wit of the  last
two planets.  Mercury is also making a trine to the moon which is in its own
sign of Cancer.  But we find much that is dangerous in this active mentality
should the parents allow this child to take up the dangerous fads of  mystic
writing such as the planchette, ouija board, etc.  Saturn in the sign of the
head, Aries, in square aspect to the mystical planet Neptune,  Neptune being

   This  horoscope has another affliction which makes it a very  interesting
figure for diagnosis.   The moon is in the sign of Cancer,  the stomach,  in
opposition to the inflammatory Mars and the nervous and  contracting  Uranus


[PAGE 178]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

which  has  a tendency to disturb digestion and create gas in  the  stomach,
also inflammation of the mucous membrane.  Uranus is airy,  the moon watery,
Mars fiery.   In order to illustrate the effect of these three planets  upon
one another,  we kindle a fire,  allow a strong breeze to blow upon it,  and
after it is in full blaze pour water upon it;  this will describe to a  cer-
tain extent the effect of these three planets when acting upon the  stomach.
Every  bit  of food that was taken into the stomach created  a  disturbance.
This  child  rarely tasted food without having great distress,  nausea,  and
vomiting;  nothing could be retained in the stomach.   She was afflicted  in
this  manner even from birth.   At the age of eight years she  was  operated
upon  by  the doctors,  who diagnosed her trouble as being  in  the  cardiac
orifice, saying that this was too small.  But the patient received no relief
from this operation.

   If  the physician could only have reasoned that the vomiting and  distur-
bance when food was in the stomach could not have been caused by a defect in
the  entrance of the stomach but by another cause deeper down in the  organ!
Astrology tells us that Saturn in square to Neptune indicates  malformation,
undersize.   if these two planets had been in the first pat of the  sign  of
Cancer  or the last degrees of Gemini,  it would have indicated the  cardiac
orifice,  but we find that the moon is in 22 degrees of Cancer, showing that
it was nearer the lower part of the organ.   Mars and Uranus indicate invol-
untary muscular action.  Mars, when afflicting the moon, shows  nausea,  and


[PAGE 179]                                                       THE STOMACH

Uranus,  when afflicting the moon, causes contraction.   Thus we see indica-
tions  that  there were involuntary muscular action  and  contraction  which
caused nausea.   But why should the food be thrown back out of the  stomach?
as the child could retain nothing.  We find an undersized pylorus, an under-
sized outlet.  After the food was in the stomach it could not be passed into
the  intestines in the proper manner, and there being also insufficient  mu-
cous membrane,  there was faulty digestion.  Naturally vomiting would be the
result.

   In  such  a case it would have been difficult to cure  this  young  woman
without an operation, but instead of operating upon the cardiac orifice, the
doctors should have observed the pylorus and watched the action in this part
of the stomach.

   Female, born January 23, 1886, 4:00 A.M.

   A  number  of operations have been performed in the abdominal  region  of
this patient, and she has gone from one doctor to another until now she is a
physical and mental wreck.

   When we trace these effects back to their primal cause, we come to Saturn
in Cancer, the sign which rules the stomach.  It is our experience that most
people  who have Saturn in this position are mincers and peculiar  in  their
choice of food.   Saturn in this horoscope is square to Jupiter,  the planet
of self-indulgence, and to Uranus, the planet of spasmodic and irregular ac-
tion.   Thus Saturn causes this person to indulge unduly her desire for good
things to eat.

   Uranus and Jupiter in the sign Libra, which rules the kidneys,  square to
Saturn,  the  planet of obstruction,  show that after the  system  has  been
filled  with  food which it cannot assimilate,  the kidneys  are  unable  to
eliminate the waste products.   Thus there is a general clogging of the sys-
tem  with  toxins and poisons of all kinds.   Then the hot  and  fiery  Mars
placed in Virgo,  the sign ruling the intestines, lights the fire of inflam-
mation  in order to cleanse the system.  As the native's will power  is  not
particularly strong on account of the weak sign Sagittarius rising,  she  is
easily persuaded to undergo operations rather than undertake a reform in her
ways of living which would bring about an amelioration of her condition even
at this late hour.

   If  is  very sad to say that this is the case with a great  many  people.
They are sometimes  ready  to  admit  being  gluttons when the fact is shown

She would not even expend the energy necessary to keep up the weekly letters

   THE horoscope which we will use here is a flat figure.  The hour of birth
is  not known,  but in astro-diagnosis it is not necessary that we have  the
hour  of birth unless we are looking for a crisis.   We must then take  into
consideration the exact degree of the progressed moon and its aspects,  also
the  transiting planets;  but the natural tendencies as to  temperament  and
morals, also the organic weaknesses are shown by the radical planets,  which
give  the astrologer they key to the health of the native,  although if  one
has the rising sign to show the will and the strength it is a help.  Certain
signs  such as Aries,  Gemini,  Leo, Libra,  and Aquarius will overcome  and
fight off a disease where most of the feminine signs,  especially Taurus and
Virgo  have  not the will power to rise above physical conditions.   Of  the
common  signs the sign of Gemini is the best able to control  physical  ail-
ments.

arterial blood is in its own sign in conjunction with the sun and in opposi-
tion  to Saturn.   This opposition tends to lower the vitality,  for if  the
blood stream is stagnant, the entire body must suffer.   We find Venus,  the
planet  having rule over the venous blood, in its own home in  Taurus  where
this planet is strong.  Venus is afflicted by the opposition and parallel of
Uranus.  This will increase the ill effects of Jupiter and the sun afflicted
by  Saturn.   With the afflicting influence of Saturn from Virgo,  the  sign
which has rule over the small intestines,  we may expect impaired  assimila-
tion of food.

   We  find  the moon in opposition and parallel to Jupiter  and  square  to
Mars.  These aspects coupled with Venus in Taurus in opposition to Uranus in
Scorpio would indicate that sensual pleasures have ruled this young man  and
that  his health was quickly shattered.  Uranus in Scorpio in opposition  to
Venus  indicates indiscretion regarding the sacred generative function,  and
at  the age of sixteen when the progressed moon had reached the  conjunction
of  Venus and the opposition of Uranus,  he contracted the dread disease  of
syphilis.   Although later seemingly cured, yet the powerful compounds  such
as those of mercury and the various remedies used by medical science to com-
bat this disease left their destructive influence in the blood, and tubercu-
losis of the kidneys set in.   This is shown by the moon in the sign of  Li-
bra,  ruling  the kidneys,  square to Mars,  in opposition and  parallel  to
Jupiter, and in opposition to Mercury.

   This young man entered the medical profession.   Later he was operated on
and had one of his kidneys removed, which was found to be hollow.   The doc-
tors diagnosed his condition as tuberculosis of the kidneys.

   He passed out at the age of  twenty-eight.  When he reached that year, we

note  that the progressed moon had finished its cycle and had again  reached
its place at birth in Libra,  and the progressed Jupiter had reached the op-
position  to the radical and progressed moon.   The time when the  moon  has
made  the circle of the whole horoscope and reached its place at birth is  a
critical time, and frequently when the moon is afflicted in the radical fig-
ure,  this  is a time of illness and one in which the native is  faced  with
many trials.

   Male, born May 8th, 1865, at 1:45 A.M.

   This horoscope has the fixed sign of Aquarius on the Ascendant,  with the
sun  in the fixed sing of Taurus and in conjunction with Venus and  Mercury.
The  sun is also sextile to Mars.  Jupiter,  the planet of opulence and  be-
nevolence, is in the 10th house in its own sign of Sagittarius.  These posi-
tions  and aspects of the sun and Jupiter indicate one who is a great  lover
of humanity, a man who is very generous financially and very ready to go out
of his way for others,  even sacrificing his own comfort if he finds  anyone
whom he can relieve of suffering or shield from harm.   But we find Jupiter,
Mercury, Venus, and Saturn all retrograde.  This indicates that the man will
find  difficulty  in realizing his ideals and in doing as much good  as  his
heart  dictates,  for  retrograde planets indicate  latent  talents,  possi-
bilities, and opportunities.

   Ability  for earning money is very marked.   This man is also  a  liberal
spender,  having  Venus in its own sign,  and house--Taurus and  the  second
house--in  conjunction with the sun and sextile to Mars.   Whatever he  does
must be done on a large and generous scale.   He is a good entertainer  also
and a good liver, for the sun, Venus, and Mercury in Taurus, sextile to Mars
in  Cancer,  and Taurus ruling the palate, give a desire for good things  to
eat and  plenty of them.  Likewise does Mars in Cancer, sextile to Venus and

   With Mars in the 5th house this man loves to share with his friends.  But
while  this  generosity may have been good for others and he has made people

His  health  could not withstand the onslaughts made upon the body  by  high
living.

will show,  we look for the strongest afflictions.   We find Mars in Cancer,
ruling the stomach,  square to the moon and Saturn, which are in the sign of
Libra,  Libra having rule over the kidneys.  We also find Saturn in conjunc-
tion with and parallel to the moon.   The moon rules the white fluids of the
body and the lymph.  Saturn being the afflicter would as a result resist the
free  flow  of these fluids.   As Jupiter,  the planet ruling  the  arterial
blood,  is in its own sign of Sagittarius, near the Midheaven, in opposition
to  the nervous,  excitable,  and spasmodic Uranus in the Mercurial sign  of
Gemini,  and as Mars is parallel to both Jupiter and Uranus,  we find an ob-
structed arterial circulation with the lymphatic circulation also impaired.

   When the man is continually breaking the laws of health by excessive eat-
ing,  we may expect that the break must come some time.   In 1906 while  the
progressed sun was in conjunction with the radical Uranus in Gemini and  the
progressed  moon was making a square to Mars and an opposition to  both  the
moon  and Saturn radical,  this man was taken down with a severe  attack  of
pneumonia.  In 1907 the progressed sun reached the opposition to the radical
Jupiter.   This was followed in 1912 by the progressed moon  in  conjunction
with the radical Mars in Cancer.   During that same year the progressed moon
afflicted by square its own place at birth and the radical Saturn,  both  in
Libra.  This brought on a severe attack  of  kidney trouble and constriction


[PAGE 190]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

in the ureters,  which interfered with the waste water passing from the kid-
neys to the bladder.

   At the age of thirteen,  when the progressed moon had reached the sign of
Aries,  and during its transit through this sign,  it came to a  conjunction
with  the radical Neptune,  an opposition to the radical moon and Saturn,  a
square to Mars,  and a conjunction with the Dragon's Tail.   This brought on
trouble with the ears and continual headaches and earaches.   When the  moon
reached  the  conjunction with the radical Mercury and the  retrograde  pro-
gressed Venus in Taurus,  inflammation of the mastoid cells developed.   The
doctors  operated  on the mastoid bone twice,  draining the  pus  which  had
formed  in  the mastoid cavity.   These operations left the patient  with  a
chronic headache and impaired nerves.

   If this man had been taught that he should eat to live instead of  living
to eat he might have been saved much suffering.

   Judging the mind first as usual,  we find that Mercury is in  conjunction
with Venus and trine to the moon and Jupiter in fiery signs.   Thus all  the
three  significators of mind may be said to be in trine.   Jupiter is  in  a
measure  concerned  in the mental makeup because he is ruler  of  the  ninth
sign,  Sagittarius,  and  from him come the benevolent  impulses  which  are
gradually lifting humanity from savagery through civilization to sainthood.

   It is at once apparent that we have here a person of unusually fine  men-
tality.   Even the conjunction of Saturn with the moon is  very  beneficial,
for  as we have often said before, the nature of Saturn is obstruction,  and
when  he  lays his restraining hand upon Mercury or the moon,  it  helps  to
steady the flighty mind and gives power of concentration.  At the same time,
of course,  there is a tendency to melancholy connected with any of the  as-
pects of Saturn to the significators of mind.  Therefore it may be said that
those who have the greatest and deepest minds are usually of a sad  disposi-
tion.

   This woman is not of a deliberative nature,  however.   She does not moan
her  days  away over the sorrows and sufferings of the world for  there  are
cardinal  signs  upon the angles and Mars is conjunction Uranus in the first

house.   This gives here a very impulsive and restless nature.   She has the
mind to see where reforms are needed,  but the nature of her effort to carry
out  these reforms depends upon her station in life,  with which we are  not
acquainted.  If  she  had  been  born into a broad environment where wealth,

position,  and influence were at her command, she would have been a powerful
factor,  felt in a wide sphere; but if she was born in a financially cramped
environment,  she  would  be  correspondingly hampered by its circumstances.


[PAGE 193]                                                       THE KIDNEYS

However,  no matter where she is her influence is bound to be felt,  and she
will  endeavor to revolutionize things with the inevitable result  that  she
will wear herself out in her efforts for improvement.

   As a chain always breaks at the point where the weakest link is found, so
it  is also with the human life.   Uranus,  the planet of spasmodic,  uncon-
trolled  action is in opposition to Mercury,  the planet which  governs  the
cerebro-spinal system,  showing that there will be a nervous breakdown when-
ever great strain is put upon the body.  Saturn,  the planet of obstruction,
is in conjunction with the moon in the sign that governs the heart, Leo, and
it is square to the sun,  ruler of Leo.   Thus it is evident that the  heart
action is very poor and there is an inability to specialize the vital  force
from the sun,  also a poor circulation.  In fact,  the chart shows the  pos-
sibility  of a condition which can only be described as a general  breakdown
from  overwork and nervous tension,  affecting every organ in the body,  for
Uranus and Mars in Libra will interfere with the action of the kidneys,  the
sun  afflicted in Taurus will act upon the throat,  and the rectal  elimina-
tion,  governed by Scorpio, will be interfered with.  This condition has fi-
nally materialized.

   It is almost needless to say that in such a case as this,  absolute rest,
mental and physical, is necessary, preferably on a diet of fruits, for it is
very detrimental to force food into a system that is in such a shape as this
one.   An Aquarian nurse whose Saturn is not in Libra or Pisces would have a
quieting and beneficial influence.  But  even  though  relief is given and a


[PAGE 194]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

cure  effected,  persons with this nature and temperament are bound to  work
themselves to death some time sooner or later.   Nothing that one can say or
do to educate them to the fact that they should take things quietly in order
that  they may last will have any effect,  for the spasmodic urge of  Uranus
and the dynamic energy of Mars on the Ascendant will outweigh any  consider-
ation because there are cardinal signs on the angles.   This woman is  bound
to work even if she knew that she would drop dead the next minute.  There is
no  doubt,  however,  that she is bound to benefit very much in soul  growth
even if the body is destroyed in the process.

   In this horoscope Saturn is in conjunction with Mars and Venus.   Neptune
is  in  opposition to all three,  and the moon is square Saturn  and  Venus.
Mars,  the planet of impulse,  causes the native to see red on the slightest
provocation,  and were he left alone there would be absolutely no chance  of
restraining  him save by putting him in a straight-jacket,  particularly  as
the sun is square Uranus, which would intensify the impulsiveness and oblit-
erate  reason.    But  the  saturnine  ray  is  sufficiently  effectual   to
wet-blanket most of the erratic tendencies for he is in the sign of his  ex-
altation, Libra, and highly elevated.

   Mercury  in  conjunction  with Jupiter,  both elevated and  in  trine  to
Uranus,  shows us that there is a wholesome,  kindly,  and religious side to
the mind.   From Mars comes the readiness to take offense even where no rea-
sonable ground for it exists; Saturn will cause the native to brood over in-
juries whether they be real or fancied; but Jupiter will endeavor to instill
charity and judgment.   It is apparent, however,  that the forces which tend
to accentuate the evil side of the nature are the strongest and that it is a
hard and uphill fight for the higher nature.

   Saturn in the first part of Libra, the sign ruling  the  kidneys, acts in

such a manner that the secretion of urine is obstructed.   Mars there causes
inflammation.   The conjunction of Saturn with Venus,  the latter  governing
the venous circulation,  reveals the fact that the branch of the portal sys-
tem which conducts the blood from the kidneys is obstructed,  and the square

of Saturn to the moon diminishes the amount of urine secreted.   Neptune  in
opposition to Saturn shows clearly a mental cause,  irritability and  worry,
interfering with nerve action.  Thus  renal  calculi  are  formed,  and  the

person is subject to one of the most painful maladies imaginable.

   To  help  a person of this nature we must invoke the aid of  Jupiter  and
Mercury  trine Uranus.   Mars is the great energizer that impels to  action,
but Saturn in conjunction puts a damper on him, and the native becomes indo-
lent, averse to the exercise generally enjoyed by the Sagittarians.  We must
therefore wake the native up to the urgent necessity for exercise and plenty
of it.  The moon in Capricorn acts in the opposite sign, Cancer,  ruling the
stomach, and because it squares Saturn in Libra, the sign of the kidneys, it
interferes with the secretion of urine.  Hence the necessity for the regula-
tion  of the diet.   Nothing of an irritating or unduly  stimulating  nature
should be eaten.

   The best healer for this person would be one who has Leo rising,  as that
is in harmony with Sagittarius.   Aries is second choice for the reason that
an Arian may be too rough and arouse antagonism without so intending.   Nei-
ther should have Saturn in Sagittarius or Taurus,  these being on the  cusps
of the patient's first and sixth houses respectively.

   Female, born March 24, 1845, 5:06 A.M.

   In judging the case presented in this horoscope our first care, as usual,
is  to find out what sort of mental quality this person has,  for always  we
must remember that the mind is the maker of the body.   Therefore the wisest
doctors now use harmless pills and helpful suggestions.

   Mercury  and  the moon,  the two particular significators in  respect  to
mind,  are in opposition.  The moon is also in opposition to the sun,  Jupi-
ter,  and Uranus.  Mars is square to the sun, moon,  Jupiter,  Mercury,  and
Uranus.  Thus the person is extremely erratic, vacillating, and torn between
different  purposes.   There is only one redeeming feature,  namely,  Saturn
trine  the moon and sextile Jupiter.   Were it not for these aspects,  which
steady the mind, the native would likely have gone insane.  Take now in con-
junction  with the foregoing remarks the fact that four common signs are  on
the angles and you will understand that she is extremely difficult to handle
mentally.   She is one of those unfortunate weaklings afflicted with a wish-
bone instead of a backbone.   The sun square Mars makes her impulsive,  also
the adverse aspects from cardinal signs give a certain surplus energy  which
manifests  as impulse.   But she lacks the persistence to carry out her  im-
petuous designs.

   The affliction of Jupiter indicates faulty circulation,  and naturally we
judge the presence of Saturn in Aquarius as an indication of obstruction  in
that  place,  for the diseases to which the human body is heir are found  in
the weakest spot, and Saturn usually marks this.  Aquarius governs the lower

limbs, and the presence of Saturn there shows us that the obstruction of the
circulation is at work in that region.  Moreover, Mars has progressed to the
conjunction  of Saturn in Aquarius,  and both are in the twelfth house,  the
house which indicates confinement.  Therefore we may  judge  that the person


[PAGE 200]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

is  afflicted with a severe case of impeded circulation,  and it is no  sur-
prise  to learn that her legs are numb and cold,  that she cannot  use  them
properly, and that she is confined to her bed on that account.

   The moon in Libra, which rules the kidneys, and her opposition to Jupiter
shows  that the renal circulation is out of order,  and the presence  of  so
many  planets in Aries,  which governs the head,  is a sure indication  that
there  is a riot of conflicting forces there.   Thus because of the  afflic-
tions of these planets we have a case of sleeplessness, extreme nervousness,
and the irritability given by Uranus.  The blood runs riot in the upper part
of the body, and there is too little in the lower.

   As  that native is well along in years there is not much to  build  upon,
but an effort should nevertheless be made to stimulate the kidneys.  The se-
cretion of urine is often totally stopped by the opposition of Uranus,  Mer-
cury,  and Jupiter to the moon in Libra.   This leaves deposits of poison in
the  system,  and  as long as these are not eliminated the  person  will  be
weighted  down by a heavy and sluggish feeling which makes the body seem  as
if it were made of lead.  Great care should be taken to soothe and calm this
woman as every bit of anger or irritability makes elimination more difficult
and causes more poison to collect in the system.   A healer who has  Scorpio
rising and who does not have Saturn in Aquarius, Pisces, or Leo would have a
beneficial effect.

   When  we note that the moon and Mercury,  which are significators of  the
mind,  are squaring each other from fixed signs,  it is at once evident that
this  patient will be rather set in her opinions and on that account  diffi-
cult  to handle.   A person with Leo or Aries rising whose Saturn is not  in
Gemini would probably have the best success in making her obey orders.  Sat-
urn, the planet of obstruction, in Cancer, the sign which rules the stomach,
shows that the digestion is poor,  and his square to the sun,  Jupiter,  and
Venus  placed  in the sign Libra, which rules the  kidneys,  indicates  that
there  is difficulty in the removal of the waste material through these  or-
gans.   The sun being close to the cusp of Scorpio, the sign which rules the
rectum,  further accentuates the trouble of elimination,  showing  that  the
person is subject to constipation.

   It  should be noted that when the significator of bladder trouble  is  in
the fore part of the sign Libra, the difficulty will usually be found in the
kidneys themselves,  but if in the latter part of Libra, the bladder will be
affected.   Thus, following out this line of judgment we may know that as of
the  sun  is in 28 degrees of Libra, the trouble will be found more  in  the
bladder than in the kidneys.  The square of the moon to Mercury  in  Scorpio


[PAGE 202]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

shows  that there is nervous trouble in the rectal region.   Altogether  the
various signs and aspects which we have enumerated show that this person  is
suffering from constipation and bladder trouble.

   This is not all.   We find Mars,  the planet of surgery,  conjunction An-
tares.   When one of the malefics is placed near the nebulous spot  Antares,
Sagittarius 8, and either of the lights are afflicted, trouble with the eyes
is quite certain to result.  In this horoscope both  the  sun  and  moon are


[PAGE 203]                                                       THE KIDNEYS

afflicted, one by a square of Saturn, the other by a square of Mercury.   We
may therefore judge that this woman will have trouble with her eyes,  and as
Mars is placed in the twelfth house, which rules confinement in hospitals or
kindred  places,  it is evident that she is facing a grave danger from  that
source.

   It is also plain from the horoscope that Saturn in Cancer is at the  root
of all the trouble by obstructing the digestion, and if we can once convince
the patient that right living is the key to health,  it may not be too  late
to restore the tone of the system.  It will probably be very difficult to so
convince her on account of her fixed mental attitude indicated by th  square
of the moon and Mercury in fixed signs.

   A  diet  of coarse food consisting of whole wheat  bread  and  vegetables
which have a great deal of fibre in them will be necessary to stimulate  the
peristaltic  action of the bowels.   Asparagus and other foods which act  on
the  kidneys,  with plenty of lettuce and spinach,  which are full of  iron,
will help to tone the system up so that in time elimination will become nor-
mal and then the eyes will grow better.

   The patient in this case is suffering from diabetes,  a disease in  which
the  food is turned to sugar in excess of the requirements of the body,  and
this product is eliminated in the urine.  Here we find Jupiter on the Ascen-
dant in the sign Libra, which governs the kidneys,  conjunction and parallel
Uranus, and square the sun and Saturn, the latter in the sign Cancer,  which
rules the stomach.   We also find that the sun is square the moon in  Libra,
and parallel and opposition Saturn.   Thus it is very evident that the stom-
ach and kidneys are the weakest links in the chain of the body,  and  there-
fore we may look for disease in these organs.

   Jupiter  afflicted  and on the Ascendant denotes one who is too  fond  of
good things to eat,  a glutton.   The conjunction with Uranus tells us  that
this person is not satisfied with quantity alone but desires her food to  be
superfine in quality and to be excessively seasoned.  Saturn,  the planet of
obstruction,  being in Cancer,  the sign governing the  stomach,  interferes
with digestion.   Consequently the food cannot be entirely assimilated,  and
some of it must be expurgated from the system or it will cause a clogged and
poisoned condition.   Jupiter has rule over the liver,  where the sugar usu-
ally  required in the economy of the body is manufactured but he  is  sorely
afflicted by a square of Saturn and the sun.  Consequently this  activity is

abnormal, and as Jupiter is placed in the sign of the kidneys, Libra, he al-
lows  the sugar to slip out in the urine,  thus giving rise to the  symptoms
which we diagnose as diabetes.  There is  also  a  throat affliction because

Neptune is in Taurus,  the sign that governs the throat,  afflicting  Venus,
the ruler of Taurus.

   When we look to the inner causes of this disease in our endeavor to  find
a remedy we note that Saturn is elevated and afflicting the sun and Jupiter.

This makes the person morose and irritable,  given to looking upon the  dark
side of life and to finding fault with everything and everybody.   The duct-
less  glands  are  centers of important spiritual  activity.   An  afflicted
Neptune  in Taurus and an afflicted Uranus in Libra interfere with  the  ac-
tivities of the thyroid gland and the adrenals.

   Before such a person can be really cured she must experience some kind of
a  shock  or  be taken into an entirely new environment  and  more  cheerful
surroundings.   A healer with Gemini or Aquarius rising whose Saturn is  not
in Pisces would probably have the most beneficial effect.

   The horoscope of this woman has the sign of Libra on the Ascendant,  with
cardinal  signs on the four angles,  and Leo intercepted in the 10th  house.
These are all signs of strong feeling.  The cardinal signs are the favorites
of the universe, for the sun's entrance into these four signs marks the four
seasons.   People  with the cardinal signs on the angles feel  more  keenly,
live more intensely, and as a result suffer more than others.

   The ascending sign of our patient is that of Libra,  with Jupiter  retro-
grade on the Ascendant.  Jupiter is parallel to the sun,  but its being ret-
rograde  naturally weakens the effects of this planet.   We find Jupiter  in
the latter degrees of Libra,  a Venusian sign,  and Venus and the sun in the
Jupiterian sign of Pisces;  usually under such conditions the body taken  on
an  abundance of flesh after middle life.   This woman was of immense  size,
weighing over two hundred pounds, which is indicated by the above positions,
also by Jupiter on the Ascendant and Mars in Taurus sextile to Venus in  Pi-
sces.   Venus being in the fifth house,  this woman found great pleasure  in
good things to eat and wanted her food in large quantities.   This naturally
caused her to put on much flesh.

   Neptune, the planet of mysteries, representing hidden or occult things is
in Aries in the 6th house, sextile to the moon.  The  6th  house rules labor

and the 10th house the vocation.   The moon is the ruler of the 10th  house,
and  together  with Neptune indicates the vocation which  this  woman  would
choose.  It is thus clearly indicated that she was a professional medium.

She was reported to be a very good one,  which is shown by the moon  sextile
to  Neptune and trine to Saturn,  the 6th,  8th,  and 12th houses being  in-
volved.   Uranus being trine to Mercury, she would seek reasons for spiritu-
alistic phenomena, also because  Mercury  is  in  the  intellectual  sign of

Aquarius.   Uranus is in the mercurial sign of Gemini, a sign of intellectu-
ality,  and Uranus and Mercury are therefore in mutual reception,  which  is
conducive to much sympathy between these two planets.  What is meant by "mu-
tual  reception"  is that these planets have exchanged signs;  Uranus is  in
Mercury's sign,  and Mercury is in the Uranian sign.  These two planets as a
result have a strong influence on the life of the native.   This woman  con-
ducted classes in spiritualism and gave spiritualistic readings.

   We find Venus and the sun in Pisces in the 5th house,  the house of plea-
sure.   Venus is sextile to Mars and has a weak square to Uranus.   This was
clearly expressed in the woman's life, for she lived with a man whom she in-
troduced  as her husband but to whom she had never been married.   This  man
was represented by the sun and Venus in Pisces and by Venus sextile to  Mars
and in weak square to Uranus.   The man was large,  red-haired,  and fond of
drink.   He depended upon this woman entirely for his support, and they both
lived to eat, and to make merry upon the money which she earned as a medium.
This kind of a life may do for a while,  but there comes a time when  nature
rebels,  when the vital organs refuse to stand the strain any longer,  as in
this case.

   When  the progressed Venus reached a conjunction with Mars in Taurus  and
the progressed moon was in Aquarius,  making a square to Mars radical and to
Venus progressed, the strain which the woman had placed on her body  by  her

riotous  living found a weak spot in the kidneys,  for the chain is only  as
strong as its weakest link.   Saturn usually shows the spot where the  weak-
ness is apt to show itself.  We find in this case Saturn in Libra in opposi-
tion and parallel to Neptune.   This woman called upon headquarters when she
was suffering very greatly from diabetes.  It was,  however,  very difficult
for  her to follow the diet laid down for her as she was accustomed  to  the
richest foods, which were taken in large quantities.

   We are told in the ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION, page 269,  that when the
Ego entered into possession of its vehicles, it became necessary to use part
of  the  creative force for the building of the brain and the  larynx.   The
latter was originally a part of the sex organ.   The larynx was built  while
the  dense body was yet bent together in the bag-like shape which  is  still
the form of the human embryo.  As the dense body straightened and became up-
right,  part of the creative organ remained with the upper part of the dense
body and later became the larynx.

   It  is  always possible to make the lesson stronger by  using  two  horo-
scopes.  In this case we will begin with the horoscope numbered 8A, which is
that of man born April 22nd, 1881, at 2 P.M.

   The common sign of Virgo is on the Ascendant and common signs on all  the
angles.  In this horoscope we will show the law of the vicious circle, which
the doctors are so interested in and which is so baffling, and how this  law

proves the truth of the statement quoted from the COSMO-CONCEPTION.

   We have Saturn, the sun, and Jupiter in conjunction, and Saturn and Jupi-
ter are parallel to the moon.  Neptune is in conjunction with Venus and both

Virgo and in opposition to Mars.  These planets  are  in common signs and in

of the senses.  Mars is sextile to Venus and Neptune in Taurus, a sign which

makes  one  apt to drift along the same path,  Taurus ruling  the  sense  of
taste.   Neptune and Venus in Taurus, square to the moon in Aquarius,  would
lead  to  the habit of drink and also to irregular  association  with  women
friends, for the moon is the ruler of the house of friends, the 11th.

   We  find no planets in Scorpio,  the sign which rules the generative  or-
gans,  but Uranus afflicted by Mars gives a tendency to  venereal  diseases.
Syphilis was the net result.   Therefore we may see that Taurus which  rules
the throat and larynx,  here expresses itself through the opposite point  of
the  vicious circle of the fixed signs,  namely Scorpio,  ruler of the  gen-
erative  organs.   The moon in Aquarius,  the third point of the circle,  is
also a contributing factor in the situation.

   In  the second case we will use a plain figure,  as the hour of birth  is
lacking.  This is the horoscope, numbered 8B, of a woman born November 12th,
1895.

   In this figure we find Mercury, Mars, Saturn, the sun,  and Uranus all in
the sign of Scorpio, which has rule over the generative organs,  with Saturn
and Mars in conjunction and square to Jupiter.   The sun and Uranus are also
in conjunction with each other and the sun is parallel to Jupiter.

   This woman had her tonsils removed at puberty.   The tonsils are ruled by
Taurus.   Due to Mars in conjunction with Saturn, and the sun in conjunction
with Uranus in the sign of Scorpio, she unfortunately yielded to the vicious
practice of abortion,  which so weakened the functions of the generative or-
gans that removal of the ovarian tubes was necessary.  Here again we see the
vicious circle of the fixed signs in operation, Taurus and Scorpio being the
points affected.

   We may see by  comparison  of  these  two  horoscopes  how the generative

organs  and  the  throat are closely in sympathy with each  other  and  that
abuses  of the function of one of them often express themselves through  im-
paired functioning of the opposite organ.

   We  will  here illustrate how it is possible to diagnose a  disease  cor-
rectly from a flat figure.  It is, however,  impossible to predict the exact
time  of  crises or to judge the strength of the will of  the  patient,  for
those  with a common sign on the Ascendant some times become hopeless  inva-
lids  if planetary aspects are also weak, while one with fixed signs on  the
angles (especially with the vital sun sign Leo ascending), even if the plan-
ets  are weak,  will often through the determination and will power  of  the
fixed signs overcome adverse conditions.   The Taurians,  however,  although
under a fixed sign, sometimes allow fear to throw them into a chronic condi-
tion of ill health which with the fixed and stolid nature of this sign it is
very difficult to overcome.

science is greatly interested,  the thyroid glands of goats and monkeys hav-
ing been grafted into men to rejuvenate them.

   In  the  above horoscope we find Saturn,  the planet of  obstruction  and
crystallization and ruler of the pneumogastric  nerve,  in  conjunction with


[PAGE 217]                                                               SEX

the moon,  which rules the uterus, ovaries,  and sympathetic nervous system.
Venus, the planet ruling the sign of Taurus, the throat, also rules the thy-
mus  gland,  the organ through which the child receives the  parental  blood
necessary to build the body.   This gland has especially to do with the  de-
velopment  of the reproductive organs.   At puberty the thymus  gland  atro-
phies,  and  its  work is then continued by the  pituitary  body,  ruled  by
Uranus,  which is the higher octave of Venus.   In this girl's horoscope  we
find the planets Venus and Uranus in conjunction,  square to Saturn and  the
moon,  and in opposition to the planet Neptune,  which has rule over the pi-
neal gland and which is the higher octave of Mercury.   Scientists have  ob-
served that the pineal gland has some connection with the mind.  Dr.  J.  S.
Lankford stated in THE NEW YORK MEDICAL JOURNAL some time ago that "the  pi-
neal  gland,  which is at the base of the brain,  is a partly glandular  and
partly nervous structure, and is known to be the center of all sensation and
emotion;  at  the same time it rules and directs all the activities  of  the
whole  system of ductless glands and the vegetative nervous system,  thereby
governing all the functions of organic life.   It also serves as a  communi-
cating center between the brain and the other organs."

   Now,  where we find the planets which have rule over the  nervous  system
and the brain in square and opposition, what can we expect but that abuse of
one  kind  or  another  will  cause bodily disturbance!  In the case of this

young girl, whose guardians called upon our Healing Department for help, she
had  for some years been afflicted with the secret sex habit,  of which  the
guardians  were  unaware until apprised through our diagnosis.   The  venous
circulation is obstructed by the conjunction of Venus and Uranus.   The lat-
ter planet,  according to THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS (page 573),  "is  respon-
sible  for strange and abnormal growths which produce...freaks  of  nature."
The thymus gland in this case has an abnormal growth caused by the  conjunc-
tion of Venus with Uranus,  which created too much blood for the development
of  the generative organs in childhood.  This in turn created a  disturbance
in the parts of the body ruled by this gland.

   We  are told by the doctors that the pineal gland (under  Neptune)  rules
and  directs  all the ductless glands.   Max Heindel has been alone  in  his
claim that Neptune is the higher octave of Mercury, the latter planet having
rule over the thyroid gland.  Other astrologers have claimed that Neptune is
the  higher octave of Venus.   But science corroborates our contention  that
the pineal gland has rule over the mentality.   The COSMO-CONCEPTION  states
that this was at first an organ of sensation and orientation,  and that when
it began to withdraw into the head,  the division of the sexes began to take
place and the brain and larynx were developed.

   Dr.  Lankford further states that the large amount of sugar  consumed  by
humanity  overdevelops  and  overstimulates  the pineal gland.  The truth of


[PAGE 219]                                                               SEX

this  has been shown in our experience with cases in which Neptune  was  af-
flicted and especially where the afflictions were such that the patient  had
to  overcome  unnatural sex desires.  These patients invariably  were  heavy
sugar  eaters.   Sugar in excess as well as liquor is a false stimulant  and
excites the ductless glands,  which when overstimulated are responsible  for
sex degeneracy.   This young girl by years of abuse had dissipated the vital
fluids that were necessary to help build the brain,  and consequently at the
age of eleven she was afflicted with epilepsy,  which is a disease caused by
abnormality of one of the ductless glands.   The doctors could not find  the
cause and wished to remove the tonsils.   When there is an abnormal exercise
of the sex function or unexpressed unnatural desires, the throat,  and espe-
cially the tonsils and the larynx, are often enlarged and swollen.  Oh, what
a pity that all surgeons and the doctors of all schools do not have a knowl-
edge  of  diagnosis by the wonderful science of astrology  to  combine  with
their own science!

   In  order to help a case such as the one under consideration it is  first
necessary to remove the cause,  which is to help this poor girl overcome her
unnatural desires.  The diet must be changed; all highly seasoned food, con-
diments,  eggs, and especially sugar, must be eliminated, and the vegetables
which contain elements that work directly upon the nervous system should  be
used, such as celery, onions, parsley, lettuce, et cetera.  This body should
be kept clean by bathing and dry rubbing,  and  plenty  of  exercise  in the


[PAGE 220]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

fresh air and sunshine should be taken.  It will be difficult at the  girl's
present age to build up the brain, which is very undeveloped.   Young people
who  have dissipated their vital fluids between the ages of seven and  four-
teen when the creative force should be used for the development of the brain
will  seldom be very bright mentally.  The physical body,  however,  can  be
built up,  and if the habit is overcome before the age of twenty-one,  there
is hope that by careful living the brain can be developed, giving an average
mentality.

   Two  horoscopes will be used in this lesson in an endeavor to  illustrate
how the planets show when disease may be the result of breaking the laws  of
nature in former lives,  and how the seeds that have been sown by past  sins
will bring their fruits in this life.

   The first horoscope is that of a woman whose hour of birth is not  known.
Nor  is it necessary for diagnosis in a horoscope with planets so  strangely
grouped  and in the fixed signs.   We will set the figure with Aries on  the
Ascendant.   We find Mercury, sun, Venus, Jupiter, and the Dragon's Tail all
in the fifth sign,  Leo,  which represents the pleasures of the native.   We
find Mars in Taurus in its detriment,  the sign in which this planet of  dy-
namic  energy shows its most evil tendencies.   This planet is afflicted  by
the  opposition of the licentious Uranus and the obstructive Saturn.   These
last  named  planets are in conjunction and in the fixed  sign  of  Scorpio.
These three malefic planets, Mars, Uranus, and Saturn are also square to the
planets in Leo.

   Here we find a very heavy debt of destiny.   In the Rosicrucian teachings
we  are  told  that  we  lay the foundation in this life upon which we shall

build  the structure of future lives.   This woman in her previous life  had
developed  a very powerful desire nature, which in this embodiment was  very
hard to keep under control.  Venus  in  conjunction with the sun and Jupiter

and  square  to  Uranus and Saturn in the sign of Scorpio,  also  Mars,  the
planet  which has rule over the desires,  square to Venus and  Jupiter,  all
lead  to free love and clandestine attachments,  with the result  that  this
poor woman has contracted that dread disease, gonorrhea,  which has resulted

in tuberculosis of the pelvic and hip bones.

   Now planets impel but they do not compel.   This woman by her former liv-
ing  had attracted to herself these planetary afflictions,  but she was  not
impelled to respond to their weakness,  for we find the moon well  aspected,
making a sextile to Neptune and a trine to Jupiter, Venus, sun, and Mercury.
Neptune  is also sextile to Venus and Jupiter.   If the woman had  used  her
will and followed the desire to live right which naturally must have come to
her  from  time to time,  she could have transmuted this seeming  evil  into
good.  But the path of sensual pleasure was so much broader and so alluring,
while the upward path meant self-surrender!

   The  second horoscope is that of a young boy born with the dread  disease
with  which the woman in case No. 8D was afflicted.   The boy's poor  little
body at birth was covered with sores,  and in the early part of November  of
the birth year this poor soul passed out under great suffering.

   Now as regards the man who does not understand and believe in rebirth and

astrology seeks an answer to this seeming injustice,  he finds Uranus in Pi-
sces, the 12th house sign of self-undoing, near the Midheaven and in opposi-
tion to Saturn,  which is in the 4th house.  These two planets represent the
parents and show that this soul had sinned in its  previous  lives in such a

ease.

   We  also find Mars in the sign of Scorpio,  square to Neptune,  sun,  and
moon,  which  are in the fixed sign of Leo,  the natural 5th house  sign  of

were only the instruments through which it received its lesson.

   Pisces,  a watery and negative sign, is on the Ascendant,  and the ruler,
Jupiter,  is in another watery sign, Cancer, 29-18.  Planets that are in the
last three degrees of a sign are not as helpful and active as when they  are
less  advanced in the sign.   They act in the same manner as a  ball  thrown
with  force;  by the time it reaches its destination it has to  some  extent
lost its speed,  and the greater the distance it travels the less its force.
So we find that planets situated in the last three degrees of a sign partake
partly  of the sign in which they are placed and also of the one  following,
giving  a mixed vibration;  therefore they express the nature of two  signs.
In this horoscope Jupiter is in the 5th house, pleasures,  and trine to Mer-
cury,  the planet of reason,  which is in the impulsive and martial sign  of
Aries.   The moon,  the ruler of the 5th house is in the 11th house,  ruling
friends in the sign of its fall, Capricorn,  and in sextile to the planet of
love and pleasure,  Venus.   When this last named planet is on the Ascendant
the native is very apt to drift into the pleasure-loving path,  the path  of
the senses.   He is easily influenced by attention and flattery from the op-
posite  sex.   In this case,  the moon, a feminine planet,  in the house  of
friends,  indicates  that  this  young  man's  women  friends  will have the

strongest influence in his life.  Venus, another feminine planet, on the As-
cendant, afflicted by a square of Neptune, the co-ruler of the Ascendant and
the  higher octave of Mercury,  situated in the mercurial sign of Gemini  in
the 4th house, indicates that his women friends will lead him  into paths of

the senses and may destroy his love for the home, for Venus is also trine to
the restless and romantic Uranus and the materialistic Saturn.   These  last
named  planets are retrograde and in the martial sign of Scorpio,  governing
sex.  Mars, the planet of passion, is in the fixed  sign of Aquarius, in the

12th house, that of self-undoing, and in square aspect to Uranus and Saturn.
Saturn  and Mars are in mutual reception strengthening the good or  evil  of
these planets.

   What do we find?  It happens that this poor young man's weakness and love
for women have attracted licentious and free-love companions, and the result
is venereal disease which has poisoned the blood.  An with Venus, the planet
ruling the venous circulation,  on the Ascendant and afflicted by the watery
planet Neptune in the sign of the lungs,  Gemini,  quick consumption is  the
result.

   In  February,  1919,  the progressed moon reached the conjunction of  the
radical Saturn,  which brought on the lung disease.   In July,  five  months
later,  when the man called upon Headquarters for healing, he was already in
an  advanced stage of galloping consumption.   The following month,  August,
the  moon made a square to the inflammatory Mars,  which brought  on  hemor-
rhages.

   Here we an see the influences of the planets,  their causes and  effects.
The  relatives of this young man did not understand why he should have  con-
tracted  this  disease of the lungs which worked so rapidly and was  so  de-
structive.   With the affliction from watery signs,  the soil was well  pre-
pared for the seeds which were sown through dissipation and thoughtlessness.

   A case of this kind is very difficult to heal,  for with the negative Pi-
sces  on  the  Ascendant,  and  Saturn  and  Uranus,  the planets indicating

impulse,  yes,  even stubbornness,  in conjunction in Scorpio and square  to
Mars,  all in fixed signs,  it is very hard to guide such a person into safe
channels.   And we find both the lights afflicted, the moon in the saturnine
sign of Capricorn, showing determination and stubbornness, square to the sun
in  the impulsive sign of Mars.   Hence this young man would not  listen  to
reason.  He would do as he pleased regardless of caution and advice.  A life
in  the open air with careful diet and pure surroundings would be  the  only
cure; if he would listen to reason and adopt it he might get well.

   Leo is on the Ascendant,  and Jupiter is just above the cusp of the first
house,  making a square aspect to Saturn and Mercury in the sign of Scorpio.
The moon in Taurus, its exaltation sign, is in the 10th house and in opposi-
tion to Uranus, which is also posited in its exaltation sign, Scorpio,  rul-
ing  the  generative organs.   The moon so strongly situated will  have  the
greatest influence over the young man's life and health.   Being in  opposi-
tion to the licentious Uranus, it will make him very free and unconventional
in his love affairs, and he will be attracted to women of a low type.   With
the afflicted Jupiter ruling the arterial blood,  and with Neptune in Gemini
in the 11th house,  the house of friends,  in square aspect to Venus,  which
has rule over the venous blood,  this young man is apt to be led into  asso-
ciation  with undesirable women friends.   As a matter of fact they are  re-
sponsible  for his contracting a severe case of syphilis which poisoned  the
blood.

   In  1914 we find the progressed sun in the first degree of  Scorpio,  and
the progressed moon in the sign Aquarius forming an opposition to the Ascen-
dant  and the radical Jupiter in Leo.   It is also coming up to a square  of
the radical Saturn,  Mercury,  and Uranus in Scorpio.  In this same year two
new moons afflicted the three latter planets.  The one  on January 26th fell

the progressed sun.

   In  1921 the progressed sun came into conjunction with the  radical  Mer-
cury.   On April 22nd the full moon eclipse fell in two degrees  of  Scorpio
opposing the transiting sun and Venus.  At the same time the transiting Mars
was  within orb of a conjunction with the radical moon and in opposition  to
Uranus.   In the spring of that year the young man submitted to an operation
for an abscess under th diaphragm,  which after being opened was a very long
time in discharging,  necessitating a drain tube.   The doctors claimed that
the pus was from the lungs,  but the patient denied ever having had  trouble
with these organs.  The horoscope shows, however, that the doctors'  diagno-
sis was correct,  for Neptune in Gemini,  ruling the lungs,  afflicted by  a
square of Venus from the common and earthy sign of Virgo, would obstruct the
delivery of the venous blood to the lungs,  causing poor oxygenation.   With
the blood stream polluted by the dread disease of syphilis and with both the
arterial blood (ruled by Jupiter) and the venous blood (ruled by Venus)  ob-
structed,  the weakest organ,  the lungs, would naturally receive the poison
generated in the blood.

   After  the patient had somewhat recovered from the operation he  returned
home.  On April 25th, he was taken back to the hospital (that was three days


[PAGE 233]                                                               SEX

after  the  total  eclipse of the moon in Scorpio) with what  at  first  was
termed a case of mumps.   The throat, jaw, and larynx were very much swollen
and inflamed.   This condition was later diagnosed by some of the doctors as
actinomycosis,  an infectious,  chronic disease of cattle,  sometimes trans-
ferred  to man.   But there was a difference of opinion among  the  doctors.
Some held that the disease was cancer.

   As  the  moon is the most heavily afflicted planet in  the  natal  chart,
naturally  when  by  progression in 1922 it reached the  opposition  of  the
radical Saturn and Mercury and the square to Jupiter from the 10th house and
the  sign  of Taurus,  the disease reached a stage where the body  could  no
longer  rid  itself  of the poisons which had been stored  up  during  eight
years.   There  were two new moons in 1922 which helped to bring  about  the
crisis.   On January 27th the new moon fell in Aquarius,  seven degrees  and
eighteen  minutes,  opposing the radical Jupiter and square to  the  radical
Saturn and Mercury.  On April 27th the new moon fell in six degrees and nine
minutes  of Taurus,  square to Jupiter and in opposition to Saturn and  Mer-
cury.   All these afflictions were from or reacted upon the signs of  Taurus
and Scorpio.   The tonsils,  the larynx,  and the throat therefore  received
much of the pus generated in the body.  The result was death.

   Had this young man,  after he contracted the disease, lived a life of ab-
stinence  from  rich  foods,  tobacco,  meat,  liquor,  etc.,  he might have

overcome it and perhaps have lived for a number of years.   But the  poisons
which were lodged principally in the lungs were increased by more impurities
generated through ignorance of diet.

   Capricorn,  the Saturnian sign of the cardinal quadruplicity,  is on  the
Ascendant, and the ruler, Saturn, is in the 4th house, that of the home,  in
the determined,  stubborn, persistent sign of Taurus, making a square to the
life-giving sun, in the fixed sign of Leo ruling the heart.  This has a ten-
dency to obstruct the life forces.   The vitality is low,  the heart  action
sluggish, especially as we find Jupiter, the planet ruling the arterial cir-
culation,  afflicted by the conjunction of the fiery Mars.  This is a latent
condition  which  will give the native much greater trouble  after  she  has
reached the period of menopause.   Her restricted heart action will then  be
more troublesome than before.

the Invisible helpers persuaded her to write to Headquarters for  diagnosis.
She  did not ask for healing,  but only wanted to know what was  the  matter
with her physically,  stating that the doctor could not understand the cause
of her general poor health.


[PAGE 236]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

   In  our diagnosis we told her that she had not developed normally.   With
the  obstructing  Saturn  conjunction Neptune in the  sign  of  the  throat,
trouble was indicated at puberty, also restricted menses, adenoids,  and in-
flamed tonsils.   This had a reflex action in the opposite sign of  Scorpio,
which rules the generative organs,  showing that these organs had never  be-
come fully developed.  Neptune has this tendency when afflicted,  especially
in  the sign of Taurus or Scorpio and in conjunction with or  opposition  to
Saturn.   Then the generative organs are underdeveloped,  and childbirth be-
comes very severe and painful.   This woman had four children,  and at  each
birth her life was despaired of.  The result was uterine trouble.

   A  tendency to catarrh of the small intestine is also indicated,  for  we
have the moon, the ruler of the sign Cancer, the stomach, placed in the sign
Virgo,  the small intestines,  conjunct the spasmodic Uranus,  showing  that
there was spasmodic action of the intestines and that the food was not prop-
erly assimilated.  This aspect also interfered with the digestion of food in
the stomach,  as the moon is the ruler of that organ; this was aggravated by
a square of the moon to Venus.

   Uranus  in conjunction with the ruler of the 7th house,  the moon,  shows
inharmony in marriage.  The husband as indicated by this aspect is of a very
nervous,  irritable nature, fond of drink (Venus square moon).  A separation
is  shown.   This woman acknowledged that she had had trouble with her  hus-
band, that he had left her suddenly, and stated  that  she  was compelled to

support her four children.  One with Saturn, Neptune,  Jupiter,  and Mars in
Taurus  afflicting one another has a tendency to be critical and  severe  in
the  home,  but at the same time of a very frugal,  hardworking nature,  not
saving oneself but always working beyond one's physical strength.

   Due to the conditions noted this woman had become a broken-down,  nervous
wreck,  with  severe uterine trouble and catarrh of the stomach  and  intes-
tines.   She was not able to do a full day's work.   Inside of  two  months,
however, through the aid of the Invisible Helpers she was able to take a po-
sition, and she became a healthy, happy woman.  We advised a rational, care-
ful  diet,  eliminating all liquids with meals,  for one with the  planetary
conditions  noted likes to drink a great deal during meals.   This is  often
dangerous to one with poor assimilation, and where there is a lack of diges-
tive fluids in the stomach and intestines.

   It is evident from the figure that the native is of a very nervous, rest-
less  temperament,  for Mercury,  the planet which rules the  mind  and  the
nerves,  is in conjunction with its higher octave,  Neptune;  this makes her
very high-strung.  Then we find Saturn, the planet of obstruction, conjoined
with the life-giving sun in the mercurial sign Gemini.   This diminishes the
vital  solar  life currents which feed the nerves,  so that instead  of  as-
similating  a  great  among such as is necessary to feed  the  nerves  of  a
high-strung  person,  she gets less than the normal amount and therefore  is
"on edge"  and run down.  Add to this that Mars,  the planet of passion,  is
square Mercury,  the planet of mind, which makes her temper very short,  and
that the moon, ruler of the imaginative mind, is square Venus, the planet of
love,  and you will understand that this person is very unhappy  and  always
out of patience with her condition and environment.

   Her trouble is due to the after effects of childbirth.   The astrological
figure  gives  a  very good description of the case.   Mercury  is  conjunct
Neptune in the fifth house,  which governs children,  indicating an abnormal
condition.  The planet of parturition, the moon, is in mutual reception with
and square to Venus.  Mars in the eighth house, which  indicates  the manner

of death,  is square to Mercury in the fifth house,  ruling children,  which
shows the use of instruments,  loss of blood,  and a great shock to the ner-
vous  system in childbirth.   She must have been near the door of  death  at
that time.  But while Saturn conjunct the sun saps the life forces,  he also

imparts a tenacity of life.  Such people, unfortunately for them, do not die
quickly;  they linger in their agony, an almost unbearable burden  to  them-
selves  and other who must perforce live with them.   No one is more  to  be
pitied.  But the long years of invalidism shown by Saturn conjoined with the

sun in the sixth house, must be necessary to impart to the soul some quality
it  lacks and has refused to cultivate in other and easier  ways,  otherwise
our  Father in Heaven would never have taken such strenuous means  to  teach
her the lesson.

   From the healer's standpoint a case with Saturn and the sun conjoined  in
the sixth house is almost, if not quite, hopeless,  especially if there is a
fixed sign on the cusp, for the patient will be antagonistic, skeptical, and
recalcitrant to such an extent that he may more than neutralize all  efforts
to  aid nature in restoring harmony.  The principal work should be  directed
to cultivate in this patient a right understanding of the spiritual cause of
her  condition.   If she can be brought to pray for light to see the  lesson
and  for  a chance to correct her mistake,  whether in a past  life  or  the
present one,  the changed attitude of mind will cause a change in her condi-
tion  so that either a cure will be effected or a speedier release found  in
death.

   In the meantime such a person should be given food that will supply ether
to feed the nerves.   Milk,  warm and fresh from the cow,  has this in abun-
dance,  and  so have uncooked vegetables.  Under th Law of  Compatibility  a
healer with Aries or Leo rising whose Saturn is not in Gemini, would be best
for this person.

   Sagittarius is on the Ascendant in this chart.   On page 133 of THE  MES-
SAGE  OF THE STARS it states that this sign produces two  distinct  classes,
the  high  and lofty type which aims its arrow at the stars,  and  the  type
which responds to the animal instincts and indulges the animal desires.  The
latter type will not think of the future.  Like a child it will enjoy itself
to the fullest, living only from day to day, never laying aside anything for
a rainy day.  Give such a person a million dollars and he will become a pau-
per in spite of it.  His greatest enemies are his own appetites.

   In the horoscope which we have under consideration we find the ruler, Ju-
piter,  in the sign of his fall, Capricorn, in the first house.   Jupiter is
also  conjunct  the fiery Mars in its exaltation sign  of  Capricorn.   This
gives Mars greater power for evil than otherwise.  Planets have a reflex ac-
tion  and often affect the signs opposite them,  as in this case  where  the
sign  Cancer receives the effects of Mars conjunct Jupiter.   These  planets
denote bulk, and when affecting the sign of Cancer the person is apt to make
a god of his stomach.   His food must be of the very best,  rich and  highly
seasoned.

   The  ruler of Cancer,  the moon,  is afflicted in the fixed sign  Scorpio
(which has rule over the generative organs) by a conjunction of Saturn and a

impregnation,  and when found in the sign of Scorpio in a woman's  horoscope

the planet of obstruction,  Saturn, is also in this sign and afflicted,  the
organs of generation are sometimes undersized, as in the case of this woman.
During  the birth of her first and only child she was three days  in  labor,
suffering greatly.  This left her with a great fear  of  childbirth, led her


[PAGE 243]                                                               SEX

to resort to abortion, the most dangerous and vicious of practices.   Due to
the  moon in Scorpio conception was frequent,  and the native's  great  fear
caused  her to employ means which destroyed the foetus.   In th eyes of  God
she  became a murderess.   The continued abuse later enveloped into  a  most
dangerous case of blood poisoning,  which left her broken in health,  a con-
firmed invalid.

   Because of the rich food in which she had for years indulged,  her system
was  overcharged  with poisons,  and since Venus,  which has rule  over  the
venous blood,  and Jupiter, the arterial, were both afflicted, all the impu-
rities were attracted to that part of the body where these planets were  lo-
cated,  Capricorn and Aquarius.  Sluggishness of the body is always found in
the  parts  corresponding to the signs in which Venus and  Jupiter  are  af-
flicted.  There the ash is usually deposited.  This woman was unable to walk
for five years before her death, which occurred in February, 1920.   We have
not  been able to ascertain the exact day of her death.   We find  the  pro-
gressed  moon  in February making a square to the radical Venus.   The  pro-
gressed aspects alone, however, would not cause death.  We must look for the
exciting planets,  the transits.   The full moon on February 4th fell in  14
degrees and 16 minutes of Leo in opposition to the radical Venus and sun and
square to the radical Saturn and moon.   These aspects,  we think,  were re-
sponsible for the native's demise.

   How  wonderfully accurate is diagnosis by the planets!   Each  time  this
woman  passed  through a severe illness,  which was  quite  frequently,  her
relatives would report that it was a case of peritonitis.  We find, however,
no  affliction to the small intestines, but very severe afflictions  to  the
generative organs.

   This  horoscope  is the figure of a young woman who is  the  daughter  of
wealthy  parents,  as shown by the sun, which is ruler of the second  house,
trine to Jupiter.  We will first consider the mental caliber, as that is the
prime consideration in dealing with anyone.  The sun is in the twelfth house
showing  that the spirit in a certain sense is imprisoned.   The sun  is  in
conjunction  with  the Dragon's Tail,  which has a saturnine  influence  and
tends  to further obstruct.   These conditions rob life of its joy and  fill
the soul with melancholy and fear, gloomy forebodings,  and thoughts of  im-
pending evil.   Mars square to the moon, which is the life ruler,  shows re-
bellion against this condition.  The square of Mars to Venus, however,  adds
to the tendencies which rob life of its satisfaction.   The trine of the sun
to  Jupiter and the sextile of Mars to the sun,  Mercury,  and  Jupiter  are
mitigating influences which give some light and  life  to  this  poor soul's

place Cancer,  a weak sign,  on the Ascendant.   Four planets are posited in
the twelfth house,  which in this case denotes confinement upon a sick  bed.
Saturn, in the sixth house, which has to do with health, is a sufficient in-
dication  that  this  will  be  a  life of suffering.  Saturn, the principal

significator  in this respect,  shows that the ailments will be  deep-seated
and chronic.   The moon,  which is the peculiar significator of health in  a
woman's horoscope, is within six degrees of the sixth house cusp, adding its
testimony  in the same direction.   Mars square to the moon near  the  sixth
house renders the native liable to operations.  The sun conjunction the sat-
urnine Dragon's Tail in the twelfth house makes such operations  exceedingly
dangerous  for she has not the vitality wherewith to withstand and  recuper-
ate.   Moreover,  the sun in 1914 had progressed within orb of a parallel to
Saturn  at birth.   Thus the native had at that time less vitality than  she
had had in earlier years.  As the moon came into opposition to Saturn in the
sixth  house in October,  1913,  we may well conceive that the condition  at
that time became critical.

   Mars governs the muscles and the motor segment of the spinal cord.  He is
square to the moon, which governs the sympathetic nerves, and also square to
Uranus,  which  causes spasmodic movements.   Thus it is  evident  that  the
nerves  are affected and that the young lady has no dependable control  over
her limbs.  Neptune governs the spinal canal, and it is opposite Saturn, the
planet of obstruction.  This configuration occurs in the signs of Gemini and
Sagittarius,  and  in  the sixth and the twelfth houses.   It  is  therefore
evident that there is trouble in the spine--obstruction,  as denoted by Sat-
urn.

   The obstruction will be found in  the region indicated by the conjunction

of Neptune, Sun, and Dragon's Tail in 24 to 29 of Gemini, namely, the dorsal
region.  The doctors have been unable to diagnose this case, and sad to say,
it  is incurable by any physical means.   There is only one method,  namely,
the  dilation of the spinal canal by repeated manipulations FROM  WITHIN  of
the materialized fingers of the Invisible Helpers.   As the young woman  has
not applied to us for healing,  we are sorry to say that we cannot touch her
case;  but were it submitted to us, we should advise a healer having Scorpio
rising  and  with Saturn neither in Cancer nor in Sagittarius,  letting  the
healer put himself under the direction of the Elder Brothers, who would then
do the work.

                           NO. 9B.--SPINAL TROUBLE

   Male, born February 1, 1918, at 12:30 A.M.

   We  have  here  the horoscope of a boy who has fixed signs  on  all  four
angles and the martial sign of Scorpio on the Ascendant.   Our first thought
when looking at a horoscope for the diagnosis of disease is to find if there
is strength of will so that the patient will be able to give the needed  as-
sistance to the healer, for if he has persistence to fight for his life,  if
he  will follow the instructions given by the healer,  then the  healer  has
some  cooperation and the task is not so heavy.   The task is  doubly  hard,
however, in the case of a patient who has Saturn elevated in the 10th house,
conjunction with Midheaven, square the Ascendant, and with the stubborn sign
of Scorpio on the Ascendant.   To effect a cure against the stubborn will of
such a patient might truly be classed under the head of miracles.

   As  a rule we look to the strongest malefic planet when  diagnosing  from
the horoscope.   Here we find the obstructing and restricting Saturn in con-
junction  with the Midheaven,  also conjunction and parallel Neptune and  in
opposition to the life-giving sun.   Saturn is in the sign of the sun,  Leo,
and the sun is in Saturn's sign, Aquarius.   When planets are in mutual  re-
ception,  i.e.,  have exchanged signs, as we find Saturn and the sun in this
horoscope, and especially when they are also in angles and fixed signs, then

we may expect a most stubborn and deep-seated cause of disease.

   We  are told on page 619 of THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS that Leo  rules  the
spinal  cord, and on page 566 of the same book that Neptune rules the spinal

canal.   In this horoscope we find 10 degrees of Leo occupying the  cusp  of
the 10th house and the life-giving sun in opposition to Neptune, Saturn, and
the  Midheaven.  Can  we  find  a  more  pronounced  affliction  than  this,


[PAGE 251]                                                         THE SPINE

especially  with Leo ruling the spinal column and Neptune the spinal  canal,
the latter of which is filled with the spinal spirit fire,  the life of  the
Father?

   When  we find this spirit fire obstructed by Saturn and the sun,  we  may
conclude  that this affliction is the result of serious wrongs committed  in
previous  lives.   The wasting of the vital fluids,  the abuse of  the  gen-
erative faculty,  is a sin against the Holy Ghost and brings to the Ego  the
most severe punishment,  as in the case of this boy who was drawn to parents
who were fit instruments to give him a body which would cause the spirit  to
suffer for past sins.   And what a pitiful future faces him!   He has  never
walked nor talked.  He must be fed, and he has positively no use of his body
whatever.

   The question may be asked,  Is there any hope for this boy?   Yes,  to  a
certain degree.  The planet of reason, however, is weakly aspected by only a
semi-sextile  to  the sun and Uranus:  therefore we may expect  little  help
from this quarter of the horoscope.  But Mars, which is the ruler of the As-
cendant and the sixth house,  both ruling the health,  is the strongest  and
best aspected planet in the horoscope.   Mars is in the 11th house in Libra,
in  conjunction with the moon,  trine to Jupiter;  and we may also say  that
Mars is sextile to Saturn although seemingly out of orb,  for Saturn is ret-
rograding  and therefore throwing his influence towards Mars.   Also we  may
expect that Mars will receive some help from the life giving sun,  the sun's
orb being larger than that of other planets.

   When  a  patient  has  fixed signs on the four angles and a well aspected


[PAGE 252]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

Mars,  he will make a greater effort to overcome than one who has not  these
influences.   This boy should be placed in the home of a nurse who has Scor-
pio or Aries on the Ascendant, and away from the parents, for the home,  un-
der  the  rule of the Father,  is no place for him.   With this  change  and
proper  care he might be able to gain at least partial control of  his  body
and be able to walk and feed himself; but he will never be very bright  men-
tally, and will always to some extent be a charge to his parents.

   Female, born March 17, 1889, 7:04 A.M.

   The fiery and martial sign of Aries is on the Ascendant,  with Mars,  the
ruler of the horoscope,  in its own sign in the 1st house,  giving great en-
ergy and impulse.   Mars also in opposition to the erratic Uranus will  make
this young woman unable to use moderation in anything.  But she will be like
a skyrocket which is sent with great force into the air;  as soon as it  has
spent  its  energy  it  falls back to earth dull  and  lifeless.   With  the
life-giving sun,  the ruler of the 6th house, sickness,  in the negative and
watery  sign of Pisces,  and posited in the 12th house in opposition to  the
watery  moon which is in the house of sickness and in the earthy and  common
sign  of Virgo,  this woman has not sufficient vitality to keep up with  the
impulse of the double fiery influence on the Ascendant and is soon  depleted
in strength.

   Mercury  is sextile to Mars from the mental and fixed sign  of  Aquarius.
This makes the native very quick and active mentally,  but whatever she  be-
comes  interested  in she takes up with such force that the  nervous  system
suffers.  This is increased by Mercury square to its higher octave, Neptune,
in Taurus.

   The sun afflicted and intercepted in the 12th house in Pisces,  would in-
dicate  a very unhappy and restricted life in early childhood.   And as  the
moon, ruler of the 4th house,  the  home  and  the  mother, is afflicted, it

would indicate that much of the restriction will come from this direction.

that we are attracted to the parents who are physically, mentally,  and mor-
ally able to supply us with such a body.   In this case this young girl  was
attracted to a mother who was selfish and neurasthenic,  for  the  afflicted


[PAGE 255]                                                         THE SPINE

moon  in Virgo in the 6th house would represent the mother.   The moon  also
afflicts the small intestines, giving poor assimilation of food,  which low-
ers the vitality.  We find Saturn, the ruler of the 10th house, representing
the Father, square to Venus in her own sign of Taurus, ruling the throat and
palate, which indicates that the Father was fond of the winecup; he was,  in
fact,  a drunkard.  This would corroborate the indications, shown by the af-
flicted  sun  above the Ascendant,  of a hard life with many  privations  in
childhood.

   Now let us see how the afflictions between Saturn and Venus would  affect
the health.   As Leo is the sign ruling the heart and the spinal cord,  Sat-
urn,  the restricter,  when placed in this sign, square to Venus which rules
the venous blood, causes a restricted circulation.  It is stated in THE MES-
SAGE OF THE STARS,  page 555,  that Saturn in Leo gives a tendency to curva-
ture and disease of the spine.   The physical body is the crystallized coun-
terpart  of  the finer vehicles.   The vital body holds the  physical  atoms
together.   This vital body, which is ruled by the sun, surrounds and inter-
penetrates the physical.   If the sun in a person's horoscope is  afflicted,
the vital fluid is obstructed and the vital body becomes diseased,  as  this
invisible force gains its entrance through the spleen which is also ruled by
the  sun.   Therefore,  we can readily see that the vital  fluids  were  ob-
structed from childhood.

   This  young woman's case was diagnosed by the doctors as tubercular  dis-
ease of the spine, Potts' disease.  In December of 1918 and January 1919 she


[PAGE 256]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

had  severe attacks of inflammation of the spine and has had several  spinal
operations.

   It  will be very difficult to heal this patient on account of  her  great
impulsiveness  and the wasting of vitality.  With sun and moon afflicted  in
the 6th and 12th houses,  she will dissipate her strength and will rebel  at
restraint.

   She has Venus in the 1st house in Taurus, trine to Jupiter on the cusp of
the Midheaven.   This with Neptune in Taurus sextile to the sun should  give
wonderful musical ability and the faculty of writing and improvising  music.
The  impaired physical body and consequent suffering will soften the  nature
and bring out the spiritual side.   Neptune is making a trine to the moon as
a  result of which this girl could develop talent for the inspirational  and
spiritual side of music which would bring wonderful soul growth.   This soul
will make greater spiritual progress in this one life of suffering that  she
could in three ordinary lives with perfect health.

   Male, born January 18, 1919, 12 Noon.

   In  this lesson we will try to show how a doctor,  who can  only  observe
from outward and physical signs and who depends for his diagnosis upon symp-
toms only,  can err in his diagnosis, and how the science of astro-diagnosis
proves  that  functional weakness is shown even at birth.   "A chain  is  as
strong as its weakest link,"  is a proverbial expression,  and so it is with
the physical body.   We may go along smoothly for many years,  seemingly  in
good health,  when suddenly something goes wrong,  a link begins to  weaken;
the strain which we have been putting on our physical body causes this  weak
place to give way.

   This horoscope is that of a boy with the fixed sign of Taurus on the  As-
cendant,  and with the sun in Capricorn on the cusp of the  Midheaven.   The
life-giving sun, however, makes only a semi-sextile to Mars and Uranus,  be-
sides its conjunction with the Midheaven, therefore the boy cannot expect  a
great  amount of help from this planet.   We find Uranus in its own sign  of
Aquarius,  elevated in the 11th house, in conjunction with and  parallel  to
the dynamic Mars,  and in opposition and parallel to the obstructive Saturn,
which  is in the fixed sign of Leo and in the 5th house.   We also find  the
moon in the same sign,  in conjunction with Saturn and in opposition to Mars
and Uranus.

ligaments,  and with the moon and Saturn both in the sign of Leo,  which has
rule over the spinal column we may expect that the seat of the trouble  will
be found in this latter region.  Saturn dries up and causes atrophy.  There-
fore we may diagnose this case as a lack of synovial  fluid to lubricate the

vertebrae of the spine,  also a loss of strength in the ligaments which con-
nect the spinal bones.

   The result is that this child while healthy and well formed, seemingly in
moderate health, still was unable to bear his weight on his legs.   He would
draw them up Each time that the nurse attempted to teach him to stand.  This
affliction,  which comes from fixed signs,  will be a most difficult one  to
overcome  unless a miracle is performed through spiritual healing,  although
by patient manipulation with olive oil over the spinal region and a  careful
vegetarian diet the child may be helped to a very great extent.

conjunction with the obstructive Saturn, but in the sign of Sagittarius rul-

square to Mars.  In 1914,  after  a  spell  of  typhoid  fever, this man was

unable to walk without crutches.   He could not stand without swaying.   The
doctors  believed this weakness to have its seat in the spinal  cord,  while
astrology  diagnoses  it  as a drying up of the synovial fluid  of  the  hip
joints.  When the weight is put on the pelvic region by standing,  stooping,
or  by any strained position,  the pelvic bones slip out of position and  in
turn  press on the sciatic nerve,  which controls the sacral plexus and  the
limbs.   A pressure on this nerve may cause what is termed paralysis of  the
lower limbs.

   A case of this kind,  however, is curable.  A slight adjustment by an os-
teopathic  physician or a chiropractor will eliminate the pressure upon  the
sciatic  nerve.   Here we may see what a vast difference  there  is  between
astro-diagnosis  and medical diagnosis.   The healer who has a knowledge  of
the planets and their effect upon the physical body may find a great differ-
ence in cases which may have the same outward or physical symptoms.   Also a
knowledge of body adjustment is often very helpful.

   Male, born March 6th, 1831, 4 P.M.

   This  is the horoscope of a man with the fixed and fiery sign of  Leo  on
the Ascendant, and the obstructing Saturn in Leo in the 1st house.

   Whenever Saturn is placed in an angle, a fixed sign,  or near the  Ascen-
dant, his influence is much more destructive than elsewhere, especially when
in the sign of Leo, which rules the heart.  Then we may expect that the per-
son will be lacking in vitality.   Especially so in the case of this man  as
we  find Saturn in square aspect to the dynamic Mars,  and Mars in its  fall
and near the cusp of the 10th house, where its destructive influence may re-
sult in the greatest amount of damage, particularly as we find these two af-
flicting  and powerful planets in Leo and Taurus,  two of the most  powerful
signs in the horoscope.   These planets are of opposite natures;  Saturn  is
cold and moist,  while Mars is fiery,  and dry.   Consequently we may expect
that the body will suffer as a result.

and the conjunction of Mars, the Father was killed by the falling of a tree,

leaving the mother and three small children penniless.   This forced the el-
dest boy,  whose horoscope we are delineating,  to help earn the wherewithal
to live.  He was placed as an assistant to a blacksmith in the neighborhood,
and  was  compelled at the growing age of twelve years to do a  man's  work,
wielding the heavy sledge hammer.   As a result the valves of the heart were
not  fully developed.   For years he suffered,  and Each time he  reached  a
state of financial success,  his health would break,  forcing him to give up
and  change  to  another climate for relief.   Some  doctors  diagnosed  his
trouble  as tuberculosis,  others as asthma.  He had all the indications  of
asthma,  but these spells would come and go.  Each winter while in the cold,
eastern  climate he spent some time in bed with pneumonia or  congestion  of
the lungs.

   Here we see the effect of the affliction of sun square moon from the  two
common signs of Pisces and Sagittarius.   We find Mercury in the fixed  sign
of  Aquarius,  in  opposition to Saturn and square to Mars  in  Taurus,  the
throat,  which would give some tendency toward a nervous contraction of  the
trachea.

   Now  we  have  found the afflicting  planets  indicating  valvular  heart
trouble  and  weak lungs,  but the man died from an abscess  of  the  liver.
Where do we find the indication of liver trouble?   Mars in Taurus is in his
detriment.   This planet is the strongest in the horoscope; in fact Mars may
be called the life ruler.   When in the sign ruling the throat,  it gives  a
desire to tickle the palate and a thirst which  often leads to strong drink.


[PAGE 265]                                        THE LIVER AND GALL BLADDER

In this case we find Mars sextile to the sun and trine to Neptune.   Neptune
governs and sometimes predisposes to the use of drugs.   This had its result
in  an abnormal desire for strong, black coffee.   Instead of quenching  his
thirst with water, this man would drink cold coffee and in large quantities.
Mars in Taurus also gives an abnormal appetite, indicating one who is apt to
gourmandize.   With the lowered vitality on account of the affliction to the
heart and poor oxygenation in the lungs, the native was unable to do  manual
labor,  thereby being unable to work off the excess of  food.   Consequently
the poor liver was worked over time and became a receptacle for the  poisons
created by the excess of food which could not be absorbed by the blood.  Ju-
piter rules the liver;  we find Jupiter in conjunction with and parallel  to
Uranus in the 6th house, sickness, also parallel to the moon.  Naturally the
liver would be sluggish and easily overtaxed.

   If this man had lived normally,  he could have reached a ripe old age  in
spite  of the planetary afflictions,  for with Mars elevated and sextile  to
the  sun,  with the moon sextile to Jupiter,  and with fixed  signs  on  the
angles there is no reason why he should have passed out at the comparatively
early period of middle life.

   We  will judge first the mental caliber so that we may be better able  to
deal  with our patient,  for the basic quality and trend of the mind have  a
great  determining influence as to the way a person views sickness,  and  we
must  be prepared to meet his ideas in such a manner that we inspire  confi-
dence.  Mercury rules the 3rd house, which governs the lower mind.  Its par-
allel to Saturn,  the planet of obstruction,  curbs this flighty constituent
of the personality and gives it depth, but this aspect also gives a tendency
to look at the dark side of things;  pessimism and melancholy are among  its
results.   Mars in the mercurial sign of Virgo, square to Mercury, makes the
native cynical and quick to anger.

   Saturn in Cancer, the sign of the stomach, shows us that digestion is ob-
structed.  His opposition to Venus and the square of both to Uranus in Libra
show  that the venous circulation is also obstructed,  particularly that  of
the  renal veins which carry the blood from the kidneys (Uranus  in  Libra),
and that part of the portal system which carries the blood from the  stomach
(Saturn in Cancer),  through the liver.  Saturn rules the gall bladder,  and
his  position in Cancer,  square Uranus in the sign of the kidneys  (Libra),
shows the concretion of sediment in both of these organs.  As brick is baked

gallstones  and renal stones by the restraining action of Saturn when  anger
is kindled by Mars.   Inward impotent rage and vindictiveness which wait for
an opportunity to get even, the nursing of a  grievance  instead  of letting

appeal  to the higher nature,  for there is a basic benevolence that may  be
invoked.   Physical treatments can and must of course be given,  but however
effective they may prove for the time being, they are merely palliative, for
until  the  patient changes his mental attitude there can be no  real  cure.
Continued  inward  rage  will form new stones to take  the  place  of  those
eliminated or dissolved by the treatment.   To thoroughly impress this  fact
upon the patient is the first duty of the astro-therapeutic health adjuster.
The harm has been done in the present case,  and cultivation of serenity can
only act to correct.  But if a configuration like this is noted in the horo-
scope of a child, we ought to warn the parents so that this trait of nursing
wrath  may  be  eradicated ere it gets a hold on the growing  girl  or  boy.
Prevention is always better than cure.  It is not enough just to help people
to  regain health;  our aim should be to teach them how to live  in  harmony
with the laws of love and life that they may never be sick.   Until we thor-
oughly realize this and practice it we are missing the greatest part of  our
privilege.

   A  person with Scorpio rising would be our first choice when selecting  a
healer for this case; one with Taurus would come next.  But neither may have
Saturn  in  the degrees of the signs included in the patient's  1st  or  6th
houses.   The treatments,  both mental and physical,  should be given in the
hour of the sun.   Large doses of olive oil or copious draughts of hot water
would be of great assistance.

   Male, born April 23rd, 1850.

   No.  10C is the horoscope of a judge of the Supreme Court,  whose hour of
birth we could not ascertain, but from events in his life we judge that Cap-
ricorn would be on the cusp of the Ascendant.  Although the writer never met
this man in person,  yet from indications in the home he was born some  time
near 9:30 or 10 P.M.   This would place Jupiter and the moon in or near  the
Midheaven  or the 9th house which would correspond with his  character,  for
from reports of friends he was a very efficient and just judge.  He had much
inharmony in his home,  which would be indicated by Saturn and Uranus in Ar-
ies in the 4th house, describing the wife as nagging and erratic.  Saturn is
square to Mars in Cancer in the 7th house, again showing inharmony and quar-
reling with the marriage partner.

   The Judge was also greatly troubled through the weakness of an only  son,
who squandered his time in drink and immorality,  spending his money on  the
opposite sex.  This is shown by the position of Venus in the 5th house, gov-
erning children,  also pleasures.   Venus is very strong in the sign of Tau-
rus, which rules the palate and it is also sextile to Mars in Cancer, ruling
the stomach.

Saturn is square to Mars there is much temper but not of the explosive kind.

anger  when continued for years will crystallize the bile in the gall  blad-

pain while they are being eliminated.  The Judge suffered from these  stones
for nearly twenty years.  About  1894  the progressed Saturn neared an exact

the  forming of these stones.   This patient passed into the higher life  on
January 1,  1916,  when the transiting Saturn had reached the square to  its
own place at birth.

   Female, born December 14, 1855, at 10 A.M.

   This is the horoscope of a woman who has Capricorn on the Ascendant,  and
the ruler, Saturn, is in the 5th house, square to the inflammatory Mars.  We
have  noted  from a number of horoscopes in our files of patients  who  have
suffered  from gallstones that they have had Saturn and Mars conjunction  or
square.   Saturn in this horoscope is in the house ruling children, the 5th,
and square to Mars in the 8th.  This woman's troubles were caused by  aggra-
vations by the children of her husband's first marriage,  the  stepchildren.
Note  how  clearly this is shown by Mercury and the sun in the  11th  house,
which rules stepchildren, square to Neptune, ruler of the 2nd house.   Anger
and inharmony arose in her home on account of her husband's finances, and as
usual the Capricorn nature would not forget and forgive,  holding resentment
within until she paid the penalty in  1903  when she had the first attack of

gallstones,  followed  by another attack fourteen years later,  about  1917.
The  progressed moon was in Sagittarius in 1903 and in Gemini in 1917.   The
exact time of the illness is not given,  but the opposition and the conjunc-

   This disease is one of the most painful of afflictions.   When the stones
pass from the gall bladder,  pressing through the tiny gall duct which leads
into the duodenum, they often get partly through this duct but remain wedged

in, causing intense suffering.  A very safe and often most beneficial remedy
is to have ready one-half cup of olive oil and the juice of one lemon.   Set
the alarm clock to go off at 3 A.M.; at that time drink all of the oil  fol-
lowed  by the juice of the lemon.   Refrain from eating breakfast,  and  eat
very little during the day.  Repeat this for three nights in succession, and
the  third morning take a cathartic.   A tablespoon of Epsom salts has  been
used by some with excellent results.   If this does not eliminate the  gall-
stones, try the remedy again about two or three weeks later.

   Female, born April 24, 1862, midnight.

   The  Ascendant in this chart is occupied by the Saturnine sign of  Capri-
corn,  with Saturn,  the ruler, intercepted in the 8th house.   When we find
the  life ruler so weakly situated and afflicted,  we may look for a  person
who  is very likely to become a victim of circumstances,  instead  of  being
victor; one who will allow the planets to rule her instead of her ruling the
planets.   Where Saturn is afflicted in the house of limitations, the native
is very gloomy and always looks at the dark side of life,  and if he suffers
physically,  he is very apt,  like the Virgoans,  to give in to the disease.
Wherever Saturn, the plant of obstruction, is posited in the horoscopes,  we
may look for trouble.  In this case we find him in the sign of Virgo, ruling
the  small  intestines,  and in conjunction with the planet  Jupiter,  which
rules  the  arterial  circulation.  Jupiter also has rule over the adrenals.


[PAGE 275]                                                   THE CIRCULATION

The  secretion of these glands is necessary to give tone to the  blood,  and
when restricted by Saturn we may expect that the arterial blood will be dis-
turbed.

   But  we  do  not judge by Saturn and his influence alone.   We  find  the
planet Venus,  ruling the venous blood, in conjunction with the moon,  which
has rule over the synovial fluids,  the lubricants of the body.   Venus  and
the moon are in opposition to Jupiter and Saturn.  What  would be the effect


[PAGE 276]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

upon the body of the afflictions of the above four plants?   Due to the  re-
stricting influence of Saturn we may expect trouble with the arterial circu-
lation.   With the venous blood also restricted there is no freedom  to  the
blood flow, and the effect is the same as that of a stagnant stream of water
which becomes muddy and full of poisonous weeds.  We may expect the blood to
become polluted and stagnant.

   We extract a certain amount of minerals from our food, which while we are
children  can all be utilized to build bone;  but after we have reached  our
full  stature  and the body can use little of this mineral  matter  for  its
growth,  if taken in excess it then deposits in the joints and blood stream,
clinging to the surface of the little blood vessels in the same manner  that
it  does on the inside of a teakettle.   If the circulation is good and  the
blood  has freedom to flow through the arteries and veins in a natural  man-
ner,  this deposit is very slight; but in old age or when circulation is im-
paired,  this mineral is deposited in the blood and causes what is  commonly
known as sclerosis or hardening of the arteries.   In this case the walls of
the blood vessels are covered with a deposit of hard mineral substance, con-
sequently the blood flow is impeded; the muscles and joints become stiff and
sore,  and gradually as this condition becomes chronic the person loses  the
use of arms and limbs and chronic invalidism is the result.

   In  this  horoscope  we  find  both  Jupiter and Saturn posited in Virgo,


[PAGE 277]                                                   THE CIRCULATION

ruling the small intestine.   This small tube, although it is between 20 and
25 feet in length,  is coiled in a small space in the abdominal region.   It
is  lined with mucous membrane and small tongue-like vessels that assist  in
digesting and absorbing the food elements,  afterwards distributing  various
minerals extracted from the food into the white and red fluids of the  body.
If  the mucous membrane and these villi of the intestines are obstructed  by
Saturn,  as  in the case of this woman whose moon is also  opposed  by  this
afflicter,  then the secretion of lymph and chyle,  the white fluids of  the
body, is obstructed, and in addition, the blood receives little nourishment.

   The woman suffers greatly from palpitation of the heart, headaches,  high
blood pressure,  and a constant pain in back and limbs.   When the blood has
become sluggish and filled with ash it stands to reason that the heart  must
suffer,  for  when through undue excitement or anger an excess of  blood  is
drawn  to the heart and the clogged condition of the blood vessels  prevents
it from freely leaving this central station,  palpitation,  high blood pres-
sure, rush of blood to the head, and various other afflictions naturally re-
sult.

   Now,  what can we give as a remedy for such a condition?  First of all we
would  advise  a simple and very light diet with very  little  starch,  less
sugar, but more of raw onion, lettuce, spinach, etc.  Always keep the bowels
free,  and  give the body a dry rub with a pair of bath mitts  each  morning
onarising and at night before going to bed.  Unfortunately, a woman with the

sun aspected, as in this case, except by a semi-sextile to Neptune, and with
afflicting planets in Virgo and Pisces will not make the effort to get well.
It is so much less trouble to drift into invalidism.

   We first judge as usual the mentality of our patient.  Aries, the sign of
the head,  has more planets than any other,  and two of these are  malefics.
Even if this were all it would be unfortunate and an indication of  unfavor-
able  characteristics,  but the affliction of Saturn in Aries  to  the  sun,
moon,   Mercury,   Uranus,  and  Jupiter  tell  us  this  is  a  subtle  and
untrustworthy person, who is sadly indifferent to moral obligations of truth
and justice.   Nor is it to be wondered at that such pronounced mental char-
acteristics should produce a marked effect upon the bodily functions,  espe-
cially as the afflictions are all from cardinal signs.

   Saturn, the planet of obstruction, makes  the  native subtle and cautious

mentally  by his conjunction with Mercury and square to the moon,  and  also
protects her from being "found out."   This same configuration obstructs the
flow  of nerve force,  and thus causes a clogging of both the voluntary  and
sympathetic  nervous  systems,  which  are  ruled  by  Mercury  and the moon

pneumogastric nerve,  which is normally saturnine and suppressive in its ac-

Saturn  with  the sun is aggravated by the fact that they are  in  parallel,
situated in the first cardinal sign, Aries,  ruling the head,  square to the
moon in the second cardinal sign,  Cancer,  which rules the stomach,  and in
opposition  to Jupiter in the third cardinal sign,  Libra,  which rules  the
kidneys.  Were it not for the trine of Mars to the moon and the placement of
the sun in its exaltation sign,  Aries, it would be difficult for life to be
sustained in this severely afflicted nativity.

   This person is afflicted with sluggish circulation, indigestion, and ner-
vous  constipation on account of the planetary afflictions mentioned,  still
this  is far from the worst trouble.  The conjunction of the planets in  Ar-
ies,  the head,  and their opposition to Jupiter,  which rules the  arterial
circulation,  show plainly how the nerves and blood vessels are  clogged  in
that most important part of the body, the head.  As a consequence there is a
dearth of material with which to build up the various organs, and an accumu-
lation  of waste.   We all know that a bad stomach reacts on the  eyes,  and
when  we  consider the effect of the sun and Saturn in Aries square  to  the
moon in Cancer,  we see that it is small wonder that both eyes are afflicted
with the saturnine obstruction known as cataract.

   A Taurus healer would be best fitted to handle this case,  and it  should
be made very,  very plain to the patient that frankness and strict adherence
to truth are an absolute necessity for recovery.  Even if resented at first,


[PAGE 281]                                                   THE CIRCULATION

a  kindly statement of the fact of the opposite fault and its  effects  will
probably bring a change.   A religious attitude of mind will loosen the ten-
sion  of nerves,  allowing the bodily functions greater  freedom.   Uncooked
food  should be given in as large a measure as the patient will  allow,  for
its ether is necessary to build up the nerves.   Onions are prime  builders,
and  pineapple  is unrivaled as a digestive stimulant.   But  in  this  case
physical factors,  though of vital importance,  pale into insignificance  in
comparison with the benefit that will be derived from a proper  appreciation
of the moral factors that have caused the disease,  and a realization of the
imperative necessity of altering the trend of mind before any permanent  re-
lief can be experienced.   Nor should the healer despair and feel that  this
is a case analogous to that of the leopard changing its spots,  for the  af-
flictions  are  from  cardinal signs and  therefore  movable.   It  requires
thought and energy to plan how to deceive successfully,  and this energy  if
turned  to good,  will be a factor of equal power in bringing the  light  of
truth into the patient's life and letting it shine for others.

   Female, born January 17, 1875, 7:00 A.M.

   This woman has the Saturnian sign of Capricorn on the Ascendant, with the
life ruler, Saturn, in Aquarius where this planet is at home and most power-
ful.  Being in the first house, in an angle, and in a fixed sign we may look
to  Saturn as having the most powerful influence on the life as well as  the
health of the native.

   We find that the obstructing Saturn is in square aspect to the  inflamma-
tory Mars.   This last named plant is on the cusp of the Midheaven and  also
in an angle; it is in its own sign of Scorpio where it is powerful.  Mars is
square to the spasmodic Uranus, which is in the sign of its fall,  the fixed
sign  of Leo,  and also angular in the seventh house.   Consequently,  these
three malefics so powerfully situated in fixed signs and in the angles  will
be very difficult to overcome.

   Mars in the Midheaven will dominate the actions of this woman, and it be-
ing  square to the restless Uranus will incline toward excessive social  ac-
tivity.   With the Capricorn egotism enhanced by the sun and Mercury in  the
first house in Capricorn,  square to Jupiter and Neptune,  the native  would
aspire to shine in society.  Especially would this be true with Venus in the
active sign of Sagittarius and in the eleventh house, ruling friends.   With
Venus sextile to saturn she would aim to lead  in  games and social affairs,

of these last named planets being in martial signs, giving impulse,  the na-
tive  would  be  very  apt to dissipate her strength,  the  result  being  a
physical break in the weakest part.  The greatest afflictions in this  horo-
scope are found in the region of the knees, Capricorn,  and the lower limbs,

Aquarius, causing enlargement of the veins.  Varices are caused by interfer-
ences  in  the Venus circulation resulting from overtaxing  the  muscles  or
nerves of certain parts of the body.

   Venus  being  the best aspected planet and free from afflictions  in  the
sign of sports, Sagittarius, in the eleventh house, friends, trine to Uranus
and sextile to Saturn, and Mars, being prominent in the Midheaven,  indicate
that  the patient was an enthusiast in games;  also in the entertainment  of
friends,  for the moon is well aspected by the sun and Mercury and is in the
Venus sign of Taurus in the 4th house, indicating the home, where the native
would be lavish in her entertainments.  The consequent exertion would put  a
heavy strain upon the heart.  Uranus in Leo, square to Mars,  and opposition
Saturn  indicates organic heart trouble,  and causes a spasmodic gushing  of
blood  through  the  aorta.   Interference with the natural  flow  of  blood
through  the heart will cause a disturbance in the veins in other  afflicted
parts of the body, as in this case where we find enlarged veins in the lower
limbs.

   This  woman  called upon our Healing Department for  help  in  September,
1920,  while under the care of the doctors in a hospital, after having had a
second operation for varicose veins.   At that time the progressed Venus had
reached a conjunction with the radical sun, and the progressed moon was also
in that part of the horoscope.  The transiting sun, Mercury, and Saturn were

in  conjunction in Virgo,  the sign of health.   The transiting  Saturn  was
square  to the radical Venus,  which brought on the last attack and was  re-
sponsible for her submitting to the operation.

   Ordinary  cases of varicose veins may be relieved and even cured by  ban-
dages,  and by a removal of strain so that the circulation of the blood  may
become more normal.  When the knife is used, however, as in this case, heal-
ing is interfered with.

   This horoscope is minus the hour of birth, but as the given time of birth
is  frequently unreliable on account of the difference in time  and  clocks,
unless  we  have  some data by which we can correct the  horoscope,  we  are
nearly as safe in using a flat figure--diagnosing from the planets and signs
only.  A very safe diagnosis may be arrived at by this method.  Only when it
is  necessary  to  watch for the crisis in order to help  the  patient  pass
through  a critical period is it necessary that we have the hour  of  birth.
This  is then required in order to observe the progressed moon and  the  as-
pects of the transiting planets.

   We  here  find Saturn,  the malefic, conjunction Jupiter in the  sign  of
Virgo.  Virgo is the natural sixth house sign and therefore rules health and
sickness to a very great extent.   We find that people who are ruled largely
by Virgo are prone to think much of their health and often become  hypochon-
driacs.  When several planets are found in this sign, we may trace the cause
of disease to this part of the horoscope.   The small intestine is the organ
of distribution of the nutriment,  where much of the food must go to be dis-
tributed to the various parts of the body through the blood.  The intestines
are to the body what the commissary  department  is  to  the army. Therefore

Virgo necessarily is a most vital part of the horoscope.

three  most  important parts of the body,  namely the  heart,  stomach,  and
lungs.   Here they affect the distribution and digestion of the food in  the
small intestine due to the sluggishness of the  gall  bladder  in furnishing

the  needed amount of bile and through impaired peristalsis.   As  a  conse-
quence the tiny blood vessels which are distributed over the inner  intesti-
nal surface are robbed of their nutriment,  and the blood stream becomes de-
ficient and sluggish causing anemia.

   Especially is this true since we also find Venus,  which rules the venous
blood,  afflicted by a square of Uranus,  these planets being in the  common
signs  of Pisces and Gemini.   Uranus is also squaring Saturn  and  Jupiter.
This  will interfere with the oxygenation of the blood as it passes  through
the capillaries of the lungs.

   Before  middle  life  these afflictions may  express  themselves  through
colds,  pneumonia, and painful menstruation.  But after middle life when the
body begins to feel the strain of years,  these afflictions will cause  ane-
mia,  arterio-sclerosis, and high blood pressure.  The patient suffered from
the latter three diseases,  and at the age of sixty was threatened with  pa-
ralysis  of the right side.   She also had a dizzy,  reeling feeling in  the
head.

   A healer should advise such a patient against stimulants such as  coffee,
tea,  etc.   Stimulation by friction of the skin would be of great  benefit,
using a pair of bath gloves night and morning and rubbing the body until  it
glows.   Keep  the mind free from excitement and worry,  adopt a  light  and
carefully selected vegetarian diet,  and drink plenty of pure water  between
meals.

   We are using this chart to impress upon the mind of the student the great
necessity  of advising patients as to the proper diet.   Ninety per cent  of
those who are suffering and broken down in health are ill, not on account of
the lack of food but because of wrong combinations or too much food.

   This young woman has the fixed sign of Leo on the Ascendant, and the sun,
the ruler,  on the cusp of the first house.   We find the obstructive Saturn
in his detriment in the sign of Cancer, which rules the stomach.  Venus, the
planet ruling the venous circulation,  is in conjunction with Saturn and  in
opposition to the negative moon,  which is in its detriment in the Saturnian
sign  of Capricorn.   Since Saturn and the moon are both in their  detriment
and in mutual reception,  the power for evil of these two planets is greatly
increased.  The opposition occurs from the sixth house, that of sickness, to
the twelfth house, that of hospitals, confinement, and self-undoing.  We can
well see how this poor soul has been responsible for her complete breakdown.
She  has for years been an invalid in bed,  not able to use her limbs.   The
doctors have stated her disease to be arteriosclerosis.

moon gives a great desire for liquids and sweets, and Saturn gives an abnor-
mal  desire  for unnatural foods and an excess of pastries,  starches,  etc.

paper is burned it makes a terrific heat,  but the heat is not lasting,  and
the stove is quickly filled with ashes.

   With Saturn in Cancer,  there is a lack of gastric juice in the  stomach.
Leo  is  rising and the sun and Mercury are on the Ascendant in  sextile  to
Mars.   These positions give an unusual amount of energy but also  the  ten-
dency  to dissipate it.   When the body has become worn out and  tired,  the
stomach cannot digest the food; then if too much food is partaken of, decom-
position takes place, especially if the meal is made up of inharmonious food
elements.   In  the present case the poor weak stomach has been  stuffed  to
overflowing  with food,  and then cold water or hot tea with sugar has  been
poured in after it.   What was the result?   Fermentation took place and the
food turned to poison instead of nourishing the body.  This poor young woman
at the age of twenty-four was an invalid.  Her body was filled with ash, and
with  both the venous and arterial circulation impaired the blood could  not
remain pure.  She dissipated her energy, could not use moderation.  She went
to excess in food,  play,  and mental work, and the result was that the body
could not throw out the ash accumulated from the excessive and  ill-balanced
food.

   If  she had come in contact with a doctor who would have placed her on  a
rational and carefully chosen diet and who would not have given her  poison-
ous narcotics,  she could have been saved much suffering.  Man often starves
in the midst of plenty, overloading  his  stomach  while  the body is really

starving from non-assimilation, as was the case with this young woman.   She
lived to satisfy her appetite,  but did not give her body blood-making food.
Her  joints became stiff,  her body ached,  and in a few years she became  a
confirmed invalid and is now confined in a hospital.  If she were taken to a
hospital where scientific dietary treatment is given, she could yet become a
useful woman.

   When we meet such poor unfortunate ones, it behooves us who aspire to be-
come helpers and healers of humanity to use our efforts to guide them in the
right direction.

   We  are using here the horoscope of a young man with the martial sign  of
Scorpio on the Ascendant, and with the life ruler, Mars,  in the 10th house,
sextile to the Ascendant and in conjunction with the watery moon.   Where we
find the close conjunction of a hot and inflammatory planet with a cold  and
watery one as in this case,  and especially in the sign of Virgo,  which  is
the natural sixth house sign governing sickness, we may expect that it is  a
starting point of illness, for fire and water create steam.

   Virgo is the sign which has rule over the small intestine, the intestines
being among the principal organs for the digestion,  assimilation,  and dis-
tribution of the food.   The inflammatory Mars in this sign causes inflamma-
tion of the intestines.  As Mars is in conjunction with the moon, the latter
having  rule over the lymphatics,  we may expect that the lymphatic  vessels
and glands will be disturbed in their functions.   They are carriers between
the cells of the body and the blood.  Not only do they carry some of the nu-
triment of the food to the blood, but they also act as cleansers,  taking up
a  part of the waste matter and carrying it where it may be eliminated  from
the  body through the excretory organs.   When the moon is afflicted by  the
inflammatory Mars in Virgo, we may expect the lymphatics  to be inflamed and

not able to function so as to help the blood in its work.  The moon has rule
over  the  chyle,  or white fluid which has been  extracted  from  the  food
through the villi of the small intestine.   This intermingles with the lymph
and passes on into the circulation.  These white fluids,

which are so necessary in the work of feeding the blood,  are obstructed  in
the case of this boy.

   We  have still another affliction which interferes with the  purification
of  the  blood  stream.  Saturn  the  obstructor  is  in the sign of Gemini.


[PAGE 295]                                                   THE CIRCULATION

Gemini has rule over the lungs.  Saturn is in opposition to the planet Jupi-
ter,  ruling the arterial circulation,  and square to Venus,  which has rule
over  the venous blood.   The lungs are the bellows of the body.   Into  the
tiny  capillaries of these organs the pure air passes and the blood is  thus
oxygenated and aerated.   The pure oxygen is drawn into the air cells of the
lungs,  the poisonous carbon-dioxide is exhaled, and thus the body is  freed
from a large portion of its poisons.  Whenever we find Saturn in the sign of
Gemini, especially if this planet is afflicted by both Jupiter and Venus, we
may expect the blood to be unhealthy and impure for Saturn,  the obstructor,
is stationed at the door of the respiratory system,  partially shutting  out
the  air from without and also partially keeping the  carbon-dioxide  within
the body.

   With these planetary afflictions we may look from a health point of  view
for  impure  and anemic blood;  also a tendency to  intestinal  inflammation
which  will interfere with the proper assimilation and distribution  of  the
food.   This boy at the age of eight years suffered from blotches and  erup-
tions of the skin.  As the moon has rule over the synovial fluid, we may see
how  the  conjunction  of Mars with the moon caused  rheumatism  and  fallen
arches,  an indication that Mars burned up the oils which were necessary  to
keep the joints of his legs and feet in order.

   What  a pity that the parents were not familiar with the science  of  as-

afflictions and by a careful diet, plenty of fresh air, and training in deep
breathing this boy could have been saved from much suffering.   From all in-
dications tuberculosis of the lungs may set in should he neglect his  health
by  exposure to cold,  for with Saturn afflicted by both Venus  and  Jupiter
from common signs,  he has naturally developed a habit of shallow breathing,
which will tend to induce lung trouble.

the  fiery,  discordant Mars conjunction the restless Uranus in the  nervous
sign of Gemini (the arms and shoulders),  and square to the life-giving  sun

   This patient has always had some trouble with obstructed circulation, es-

positions.   Illustrating this we find the assimilation in the small  intes-
tine much impaired.  Venus, the planet ruling the venous circulation,  is in
opposition to the moon, which we find in the martial sign of Scorpio, ruling
elimination,  the anus,  urethra,  and the generative organs.   Saturn,  the
planet of obstruction,  is found in Libra, the kidneys,  and being placed in
the last degree of this sign he obstructs elimination  through  the ureters,

   Jupiter in the nervous sign of Gemini afflicted by the opposition of  the

The  great  strain  put upon his system and the abuse of  the  poor  stomach
caused neuritis,  as both the venous and arterial circulations are afflicted
from the signs ruling the nervous system.

   The  instruction  given  to both these patients would  be  very  similar,
namely a simple vegetarian diet, elimination of meat, alcoholic drinks,  and
highly seasoned foods, using plentifully green,  raw vegetables,  especially
lettuce and onions.   The onion is a wonderful nerve tonic and body  scaven-
ger.   If taken at night in the form of a sandwich when the stomach is empty
it  will  purify the kidneys and liver and build up the nervous  system.   A
good brisk massage with a pair of bath gloves night and morning to keep  the
pores  of  the skin open and stimulate the circulation is  recommended.   In
case 11H the bowels and kidneys should be kept free from clogging,  and food
should be taken that works directly upon the liver and kidneys.

Cancer, the stomach, and Libra, the kidneys.

the sign of its fall,  this planet is weak and therefore most evil.   Uranus
is  the higher octave of Venus,  and as Venus rules the moral nature on  the
lower  planes,  so  does Uranus rule or balance the  morals  on  the  higher
planes.   Uranus in the Venus sign of Libra afflicted by a square of  Saturn
would indicate that a lack of moral balance was  largely responsible for the

physical ailment of the patient.

   Uranus has rule over the pituitary body or hypophysis.   This little  or-
gan,  which  is so wonderfully protected in a cradle-like  bone  within  the
brain,  consists of two small lobes, the anterior and posterior.   The ante-
rior  lobe  has rule over the sex or creative force and  over  nerve  fibre,
while the posterior lobe contributes to and controls the circulation of  the
fluids of the body, especially the renal circulation.

   With Uranus is Libra, which has rule over the kidneys,  square to the ob-
structive   Saturn   and   both   in   cardinal   signs,   also   with   the
impulsive-cardinal  signs on all the angles,  we may expect excesses.   With
Mars,  the planet of dynamic energy and impulse,  in the first house in Can-
cer,  square to the planets of pleasure and self-indulgence,  Venus and  the
Moon,  (Venus being strongly situated in its own sign of Libra and the  moon
being the ruler of the Ascendant,  square to its own house,) we may conclude
that this man through his excessive desires indulged in sensual pleasure  to
such an extent that the functions of the pituitary body became impaired.  As
the  pituitary body regulates the assimilation of food,  and as  Saturn  and
Mars are afflicted in the sign of the stomach,  (Saturn in Cancer gives  ab-
normal tastes and appetites, and Mars in Cancer indicates a gourmand) we may
expect that this man would be apt to make a cesspool of his body.

   With  Venus and the moon in conjunction and square to Mars in  Cancer  on
the Ascendant, and with Saturn on the cusp of the  Ascendant,  we may expect

this  person to be very untidy and careless.   He is one who  would  neglect
cleanliness  of the body and of his surroundings,  also the  elimination  of
toxic poisons through the colon, kidneys, and skin.  This would in time fill
the body with poisons which would ultimately cause eruption.

   The  skin would become dry and dead, for the pituitary body with the  as-
sistance of the thyroid gland feeds the skin.   When these glands are  tired
and depleted by sensual excesses,  the conditions of the skin as well as the
general  circulation  of the body are impaired,  dulling the  mentality  and
causing the slowing up of energies of mind and body.   In this case the  re-
sult was leprosy.

   This dread disease first made its appearance after the Flood,  when  veg-
etation was scarce and Noah and his family were forced to revert to the  use
of  meat for food.   This together with excesses and degeneracy relating  to
the generative function was responsible for this disease being of such  com-
mon occurrence among the ancient Israelites and Egyptians.  This ailment was
classed as unclean, and those afflicted with it were ostracized and excluded
from the church.

   Truly it is a disease caused by unsanitary and unclean habits of  living,
and only those who, as in the case of this man,  are gluttonous and careless
in their personal habits are afflicted with it.   We will use horoscope  12B
to illustrate another phase of this disease.


[PAGE 305]                                                           LEPROSY

   During the ancient Israelitic times the Jews looked upon leprosy as a pe-
culiar disease sent to man by God.   It was recognized as a mark of the dis-
pleasure of God for some great sin committed, and it was considered a dread-
ful  moral disease.   The afflicted ones were separated from others  by  the
priests,  who used ceremonies of purification for the healing of  those  who
had this unclean disorder.

   We  see in this horoscope indications of moral depravity  and  uncleanli-
ness:  We find Saturn retrograde in Scorpio, the sign which rules the secret
parts,  the  generative  organs.   Saturn is square to  Mars,  which  is  in
Aquarius,  the home of Saturn.  Uranus is also retrograde and in the sign of
Scorpio.   These three planets, Saturn, Uranus, and Mars,  are in mutual re-
ception,  that is,  Mars is in a Saturn sign and Saturn and Uranus are in  a
Martian  sign.   Uranus is parallel to Mars and opposition  the  moon,  both
Uranus and the moon being in their exaltation signs and in angles and  fixed
signs.   These planets are thus strong both by position and sign;  therefore
they are also most powerful in their afflictions.  When Saturn afflicts Mars
from Scorpio and Uranus afflicts Mars and the moon from this sign of sex, we
may at once diagnose the case as venereal disease,  but it was of such a ma-
lignant nature that it was believed to be leprosy, for  all outward symptoms

of leprosy;  when the blood stream is poisoned, the glandular system is also
affected, which in turn interferes with the metabolism of the entire body.

   The  Jews in olden times used no medicine to cure this  unclean  disease.
They claimed  that  it  withered  all  desire  for grace and spiritual life;

therefore the only cure was prayer and spiritual purification.

   In Matthew,  8th chapter,  we find:  "When he (Christ) was come down from
the mountain,  great multitudes followed him.   And,  behold,  there came  a
leper and worshiped him,  saying,  Lord,  if thou wilt,  thou canst make  me
clean.   And Jesus put forth his hand and touched him,  saying,  I will;  be
thou clean.  An immediately his leprosy was cleansed."

   Paralysis  of the limbs and arms is the affliction of this  young  woman.
We  note first that this condition is indicated by the moon,  which  is  the
particular significator of health for a woman.  She is in Pisces which rules
the feet,  and square to Saturn, the planet of obstruction, placed in Sagit-
tarius,  the sign ruling the hips.  Thus the whole region of the lower limbs
is afflicted.  The moon is also square to Neptune and the saturnine Dragon's
Tail, which are placed in Gemini, the sign ruling the arms.  The life-giving
sun  is  square  to Uranus in Sagittarius and to the  Ascendant,  and  these
afflictions are all the more powerful because the sun and moon are both  an-
gular, one near the Midheaven, the other close to the Nadir.  Thus there are
strong tendencies to trouble with the arms and limbs, dropsy, paralysis, and
wasting disease shown in the natal horoscope.

   These  conditions did not become manifest until the patient was  eighteen
years of age.   At that time the progressed sun had reached Virgo 16-33;  it
was then square to the radical Saturn.  This brought out the latent weakness
and  resulted  in  a  gradual  loss  of control of the limbs, which left her

sign ruling the lungs,  gives an asthmatic condition and the afflicted  moon
in  Pisces  gives  a  tendency  to  dropsical  swellings,  which  have  also
manifested.  Thus for the time being she is in the  grip  of  what  seems an

incurable condition.  But it is noteworthy that the afflictions are all from
common signs,  and this gives the astrologer a ray of hope that when the sun
has  passed the critical points the affliction may be cured and she may  re-
gain the use of both arms and limbs even if not in full measure.

   In the meantime every effort should be made to promote circulation by the
manipulation and massage of the limbs and arms.  A diet of fresh milk, which
contains  much  ether,  and uncooked vegetables that will give  her  mineral
salts  is sure to be of great benefit in helping to keep the limbs in  shape
and  preventing atrophy so that when the present planetary afflictions  have
passed,  the sextile of the radical sun and Jupiter may restore circulation.
This patient can best be treated by a healer having Aries or Leo rising  and
whose  Saturn is not in any place included in the degrees of  the  patient's
1st or 6th houses.

   We note first the mental qualities of the patient.  The moon is conjoined
with the Dragon's Tail, a saturnine influence, and Mercury is square to Sat-
urn.  Thus the two significators of mind are afflicted by an obstructive and
melancholy  influence,  which also operates upon Mars and Venus through  the
square of Saturn.  Saturn moreover is placed in the 9th house in the sign of
the lower mind, Gemini.  Thus there is very little joy for this person;  all
the  world looks blue and gloomy to him;  he meets everybody and  everything
with gloom and distrust,  and is always afraid to make a move in any  direc-
tion for fear something is going to happen to him.

   This mental attitude is at the bottom of all his trouble,  for no one who
carries  such  thoughts  of fear and worry can ever be  healthy.   The  more
cheerful and optimistic we are,  the more we act as magnets for good things;
we  become what people call "lucky."  Conversely,  such an attitude as  this
person has is bound to bring misfortune and trouble.  He thinks he has cause
to  be worried,  and upon the surface it may appear so,  but the trouble  is
that he mistakes effect for cause.   The first work of a healer should be to
show  him  this  fatal error and teach him to smile or at least  to  try  to
smile.

   Just as cheer promotes circulation and elimination,  keeping the body  in
health,  so worry produces concretion by hindering the elimination of  waste
matter,  and  therefore  a diseased condition of the  body  follows.   Three

the first place Saturn is in the sign Gemini, which governs the lungs; he is
square Mercury, Mars, and Venus, and thus he obstructs the expulsion of car-
bonic acid and prevents the proper oxygenation of the blood.   The moon  has
particular rule over the fluids of the body.  She  is  in the latter part of

Scorpio  in conjunction with the Dragon's Tail.   Thus we may look  for  ob-
struction of the urine and for concretions in the bladder.   The sun and Ju-
piter are in Aquarius.  Uranus squares Jupiter and the moon squares the sun.
The effects of this is felt in the opposite sign Leo, which rules the heart.
The  sun is also parallel to Uranus, and therefore the heart action is  very
uncertain,  the circulation poor,  the blood poisoned and heavy  with  waste
matter  that  cannot be eliminated through the regular  channels.   So  this
clings to the walls of the arteries,  and in the course of years the  condi-
tion  known as hardening of the arteries takes place,  and the body  becomes
dry and emaciated.

   The  horoscope is the clock of destiny which marks the time when  tenden-
cies shown at birth are due to materialize.  In August,  1910,  the moon had
progressed to the conjunction of its radical place.   his configuration  ex-
cited  the moon's radical conjunction with the Dragon's Tail to  action,  as
well as her square to the radical sun and her opposition to Uranus  radical.
Thus the disease which had been prepared for during so many years took a se-
rious turn and commenced to seriously hamper the native.  In January,  1912,
the moon progressed to the opposition of Saturn radical and squared Mars and
Mercury, thus enlivening and bringing into action the condition foreshown in
the natal chart.  Mars and Mercury govern the nervous system.  Mars has rule

over the motor nerves and Mercury over the sensory nerves.   The above  pro-
gressed affliction obstructed the vital flow along the nerves and  paralyzed
the body.

   Jupiter was parallel to the sun's radical place during 1912-14,  and  the
conjunction of the progressed sun and Mars in January, 1914,  served to give
more energy.   These influences should have been taken on he wing.   The pa-
tient should have outdoor life, on a farm if possible,  with a diet in which
buttermilk has a large part, and above all the cultivation of a cheerful at-
titude should be forced.   This with manipulation of the spinal nerves would
probably  bring life into the paralyzed limbs and might restore a fair  mea-
sure of health under good progressed aspects.

   Female, born April 13, 1912, 9:00 A.M.

   This horoscope is that of a young girl with the watery and cardinal  sign
of  Cancer on the eastern angle and with the fiery Mars in conjunction  with
the Ascendant.   Mars is square to Venus and trine to the moon, the moon be-
ing the ruler of the Ascendant.   Mars is the ruler of the 6th house,  which
has rule over the health; consequently we must look to Mars as the indicator
of health.

   Mars in Cancer afflicted by a square from Venus, and Venus in the martial
sign of Aries,  would indicate a gourmand,  one who would as a result of too
much  rich and highly seasoned food suffer from indigestion or  inflammation
of the stomach.

   Neptune in Cancer afflicted by a square from the sun and Mercury would be
apt to give nervous trouble or malnutrition.   But this young girl has  been
in  the very best of health,  with the digestive organs in  good  condition.
The conjunction of Mars with the Ascendant in Cancer and square to Venus has
had little effect upon her health.

   The birth of this child was prepared for under the purest conditions  and
in  the most careful manner.   The parents had prepared for it  even  before
conception,  for they desired to attract to birth an Ego advanced and  pure.
During all the prenatal period the mother received the  greatest  care,  and

the  child was loved into this physical world by advanced and pure  parents.
She was a most wonderful child--healthy, happy,  far above the average child
of her years, and superior to other children of her age in mentality.

   In the summer of 1922 she was taken with frequent hemorrhages of the nose
and with severe headaches.  The best physicians were consulted,  who did ev-
erything possible to locate the cause, but to no avail.   The facial muscles
of the right side began to relax,  and  facial  paralysis  finally  set  in,

greatly  disfiguring a beautiful face.  After trying every available  method
to  relieve the child,  the father and mother took her on a touring trip  to
southern California,  hoping that the sea coast and lower altitude might re-
live her, which they did to some extent.

   Having  read  the Rosicrucian  books on astrology,  and  knowing  of  our
method  of healing and diagnosing,  they visited Headquarters with the  hope
that  the writer would be able to diagnose and help them in  their  trouble.
This hope was realized.  As soon as the aura of the child was contacted, the
writer  was impelled to lay the child on her face and to run her  hand  over
the spinal column.  Although not an osteopath nor a chiropractor,  she found
irregularity in the region of the upper cervical vertebrae, also in the cen-
ter of the dorsal region.

   During this,  may we call it intuitional or spiritual, diagnosis the par-
ents  were  silently watching every move of the writer,  exchanging  glances
from  time to time.   When it was mentioned that the spinal column  was  ir-
regular,  the father spoke up,  saying, "Oh, her spine is all right."   When
asked  if she had had an adjustment,  he admitted that both he and his  wife
were  chiropractors and had practiced for almost two years.   When asked  if
they  had not both practiced on the child,  they shamefacedly admitted  that
they had, with the result that the motor nerves had been over-stimulated.

   Through  the wonderful keyboard,  the spinal column with  its  thirty-one
spinal nerves, a skillful operator can by manipulation enervate or stimulate
almost any part of the body, while an unskilled one may cause untold suffer-
ing.  Such was the case with this beautiful young girl.  The parents who had
loved  her into existence,  who would have sacrificed their very  lives  for
her,  had in ignorance played once too often on her spinal nerves,  exciting
them  to work overtime,  and after the damage had been done,  they were  not
skilled enough to know what method to use to undo the damage.

   We  take the rulers of the 10th and 4th houses to indicate  the  parents.
Neptune is the ruler of Pisces,  which is on the Midheaven,  and Mercury the
ruler of Virgo,  which is on the cusp of the 4th house.  The above two plan-
ets are squaring each other.  Mars on the Ascendant indicates accidents, in-
juries,  etc.   Mars is square to Venus in Aries,  the head.   The  cardinal
signs act upon each other.   the parts affected by squares such as from  Ar-
ies,  the head, to Cancer, the stomach, are in mutual bondage to each other.
While the nerves of the stomach may have been over-stimulated, thereby send-
ing  an excess of blood to the head causing the bleeding of the nose,  by  a
knowledge of proper adjustments a skilled osteopath or chiropractor could in
a  few treatments overcome this trouble.  The Invisible Helpers of the  Rose
Cross, by materializing a hand, can also accomplish the same thing.

   We  will use for this lesson the horoscopes of a man and woman  who  have
afflictions  in common signs,  in order to illustrate why one  patient  will
succumb to disease and become an invalid when another who has many more  af-
flicting  planets rises above them and thus becomes able to lead  an  active
and useful life.

   We  will first diagnose horoscope 13D,  where we find the common sign  of
Sagittarius on the Ascendant with the ruler, Jupiter, retrograde, and in its
own sign in the 11th house, trine to the life-giving sun,  but square to the
obstructing Saturn, which is in the sign of Pisces, another common sign.  We
find the sun making only good aspects.  The moon is square the Ascendant and
in  conjunction with the desire body Dragon's Head,  which has a  Jupiterian
influence,  sextile  to Mars and Venus, and trine to  Jupiter.   These  con-
figurations  should give much vitality and be a strong factor for health  in
this horoscope.  Now why should a man with so few afflictions have become an
invalid?

   We find only two afflictions which would be detrimental to health;  these
are  Saturn square Jupiter,  and Venus conjunction Mars in Taurus square  to
Uranus in Leo.  But with the common sign on the Ascendant  this  man's  will

circulation.   Saturn in a common sign,  square to Jupiter also in a  common
sign,  Sagittarius,  which has rule over the sacral region,  shows that  the
fifth lumbar nerve and the sacral nerves were obstructed in their  function.
Naturally this interfered with  the  circulation  in  that part of the body,

the line of least resistance and drifts into invalidism.

and the square of Uranus.   Venus,  which has rule over the venous  circula-
tion,  is in the common sign of Virgo,  square to the obstructing Saturn  in
Sagittarius, the home of Jupiter, Sagittarius also ruling the sacral region.

A  native with the dynamic Mars on the Ascendant in the fixed and  impulsive
sign of Leo is full of energy and ambition,  and would naturally use up much
strength  and  through temper and impulse dissipate much  of  her  vitality.
With the circulation restricted in the sacral region by Saturn,  why  should
this  woman not suffer with conditions similar to those of the man in  horo-
scope No. 13D?

   In  the man's horoscope we find conditions indicating a phlegmatic,  men-
tally  lazy  person.   With moon and Mercury in conjunction  in  Pisces  and
sextile to Venus and Mars,  and with Jupiter trine sun,  everything came  to
him without any great effort.  Especially was he drawn to 5th, 7th, and 10th
house people--musical,  theatrical people and movie actors, who led him into
a life of pleasure.   We find the woman in horoscope No.  3E with plenty  of
will and ambition, whose desire to heal and help humanity led her to take up
the  medical profession.   But she had a constant fight to keep  her  joints
from  becoming stiff and sore.   With Saturn obstructing the circulation  in
the sacral region she suffered greatly with granulated joints of the  shoul-
ders,  hips and feet.   Venus or Jupiter afflicted from common signs gives a
tendency to paralysis of the limbs,  but with a fixed sign on the  Ascendant
the  native will not succumb.   Therefore i is most necessary at  all  times
when diagnosing a disease to observe the rising sign and the aspects of  the
sun, moon, and the ruler of the Ascendant.

   One who suffers from such  afflictions as the above should make an effort

to  keep the circulation normal by eating very lightly of plain food,  exer-
cising plentifully,  and with a pair of bath mitts rubbing the limbs briskly
morning and night.  This will often avert a case of paralysis.

   We  will here examine the sympathetic aspects of planets in the  cardinal
signs.  We find in this horoscope a most interesting lesson illustrating the
sympathy and antipathy of the planets when placed in signs which are  square
or in opposition to each other.

   The horoscope of this young man has the common sign of Gemini on the  As-
cendant,  with Mercury, Venus, Neptune, the sun, Mars, and the Dragon's Head
all  in Cancer,  the sign which has rule over the stomach.   Four  of  these
planets,  namely,  Mercury, Venus, Neptune, and the sun are in opposition to
Uranus  and square to Saturn.   The sun is parallel to Uranus  and  Neptune;
Neptune,  Uranus,  and the sun are square to the moon in Libra  in  the  6th
house.

   From our first observation we might diagnose this case as one of  stomach
trouble,  for with Venus in conjunction with Mercury,  Neptune,  and the sun
afflicted  in Cancer we may expect poor digestion.   When Neptune is one  of
the afflictors, especially when  it in turn is afflicted by Saturn, there is

a tendency to underdevelopment; the organs affected are often undersized and
Misshapen.   With Saturn square Neptune and Uranus, Uranus being in the sign
of  Capricorn  which is in opposition to the sign ruling the  stomach,  this
child could not digest its food,  which  was  often  found  in  the stool in

pieces.  The parents, being ignorant of the cause of the condition, were in-
dulgent and permitted him at the age of two years to eat whatever he craved;
as a small child he was given solid food to eat.

   With Neptune in the sign of the stomach, square Saturn, and in opposition
to  Uranus,  the tiny glands which secrete the gastric juice of the  stomach
and  which are so necessary to furnish the lubricating mucus as well as  the
digestive  fluid,  were  lacking in vitality and  prone  to  function  spas-
modically;  for Uranus causes spasmodic action, Saturn sluggish action,  and
Neptune  undersize or abnormal functioning.  Therefore we would expect  that
the blood in this case would not receive due nourishment from the food.  The
body,  as a result, would be deprived of the elements necessary for nourish-
ment.

   The  damage  in  such cases generally materializes where  the  planet  is
placed  which has the most evil aspects.   Here we find Uranus in  Capricorn
making several adverse aspects as noted above.   Uranus is receiving no help
whatever from other planets;  therefore naturally we may expect the place of
such  an  afflicted planet to be the focusing point of the  vicious  circle.
Capricorn has rule over the legs and joints, especially the knee joints.  At
the  age of two years this boy was afflicted with what the doctors call  in-
fantile paralysis, which caused him to lose the use of his feet.   Infantile
paralysis is a disease which is diagnosed by the doctors as inflammation  of
the gray matter of the spinal cord but this  has  not  been proven.  Some of


[PAGE 326]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

them are in doubt about this, and are seeking for another cause.

   No two children have the same effects from this infantile disease.   From
an astrological standpoint no two who are afflicted with it have exactly the
same planetary afflictions nor necessarily the same rising sign.  The writer
has found in seven horoscopes of children afflicted with it that Neptune has
been  the  chief afflicter in each case.  As stated in THE  MESSAGE  OF  THE
STARS,  Neptune has rule over the spinal fluids and the pineal gland, and it
depends  upon the planet which is afflicting Neptune as to how  the  disease
expresses itself.   This naturally baffles the doctors,  and they are unable
to explain why one child is left with one paralyzed leg,  another with  both

But the planets tell he reason for this diversity of outward expression.

                        NO. 13G.--RICKETS AND TETANY

   Female, born January 6th, 1911, 8:20 P.M.

   We  have  here the horoscope of a young girl who has the common  sign  of
Virgo  on the Ascendant,  with the sun in the fifth house in Capricorn.   We
are told in THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS, page 544, that the sun rules the vital
fluid  which  is  drawn  into  the body through  the  spleen  and  how  this
life-giving  fluid feeds the entire organism.  The sun is afflicted in  this
case  by an opposition of Neptune,  which is placed in the sign  of  Cancer.
Cancer has rule over the stomach.   The sun is also afflicted by a  parallel
of  Mars and Uranus.   We here may see that the gateway of the body  through
which the solar force must needs enter in order to make it possible for  the
vital body to restore what the desire body destroys, has not worked normally
even  from birth.   When the sun is afflicted by the spasmodic  Uranus,  the
cramping  effect of Neptune,  and the inflammatory conditions of  the  fiery
Mars,  we may expect that at some time during the life of the  native,  when
nature's laws have been broken and when the progressed planets start the af-
flictions into action, there will be trouble.

   In the beginning of the year 1923 the progressed moon was passing through
the  sign  of Virgo and made a square to the radical  Mars  in  Sagittarius.
This  disturbed  the  metabolism of the digestive tract, which on account of

the  resulting inflammation was unable to furnish the blood with the  proper
amount  of  mineral salts.   This combined with the  disturbed  solar  force
caused by an afflicted  sun  deprived  the  bones  and  the muscles of their

nourishment.   In  January 1923 the new moon fell in  conjunction  with  the
radical Venus,  Uranus,  and Mercury,  square to Saturn,  and opposition  to
Neptune.  This excited the latent condition caused by Neptune in Cancer, the
sun, Uranus, Venus, and Mercury in Capricorn,  and  the  malefic  Saturn  in

Aries making a square to the last three planets.  Added to all these afflic-
tions Mars radical is parallel to Uranus, Neptune, Venus and the sun.  Do we
wonder that this young girl was afflicted with the dread disease of rickets,
which is a malady in which the bones are lacking in mineral matter, and with
tetany,  which is a disease causing a nervous contraction of the muscles  of
the extremities?

   Had the parents known the tendencies in this horoscope when the child was
quite  young and carefully chosen her food so that she would  have  received
the  greatest  possible  amount of nourishment from  the  smallest  possible
amount of it, avoiding the excessive use of sugar,  starches,  and proteins,
and had they used more of nature's pure,  green vegetables,  they might have
helped  her to build better bones and muscles.   Unfortunately many  of  our
northern  countries do not have the pure green food all the year round  such
as  we  have here in sunny California, where it may be  found  in  abundance
twelve months in the year.

   In prescribing a diet for the patient suffering from the above malady  we
would eliminate all heavy proteins,  giving her plenty of pure fresh  goat's
milk,  carrots,  lettuce, onions, and spinach, adding a very small amount of
entire  wheat bread each day to give bulk.   Let her lie in the sunshine  as
much as possible; especially should the sun shine upon the spine.   Give her
friction rubs, which will stimulate the circulation.

   In  order  to illustrate to the student why the same disease  will  leave
different after-effects we will use two horoscopes.   These two charts prove
the claim which we have always made that there is no more perfect way of di-
agnosing   the   disease  of  a  patient,   nothing  more   reliable,   than
astro-diagnosis.

   Both  patients  have called upon the Invisible Helpers for  healing,  and
both  have  been sufferers from that dread disease which has taken  so  many
lives  all  over the world and has claimed more victims than did  the  world
war, the disease which the doctors call influenza, or for short, the "flu."

do  great things with it.   He is large and benevolent in all his ways.   We
find that this man had a great desire for wealth,  and after having had  in-
fluenza he put such a strain upon his physical body in order to gain  wealth
that  he  brought  about a nervous condition from which he is now suffering.

He has the restless moon in the Midheaven trine to the irresponsible and in-
ventive  Uranus,  giving  a great desire for speculation and  to  engage  in
get-rich-quick schemes.  But Neptune, the planet dealing with large corpora-
tions  and speculation,  is square to the sun and Saturn in the  2nd  house,
showing that he has always been speculating with large corporations and  al-
ways losing.

   Venus  in  Cancer  in  the 4th house in opposition to  the  moon  in  the
Midheaven gives an extravagant, frivoulous,  slothful,  and dissolute condi-
tion in the home,  indicating that money is wasted and used very  foolishly,
giving the native even greater desire to make money.   He sacrificed his vi-
tality  for the almighty dollar.   Being a telegraph operator,  he used  the
brain and the fingers tips to excess,  which caused inadequate nutrition  of
the nervous system.  The result was a complete nervous breakdown.

                    Male, born April 15, 1865, 8:22 A.M.

   With  the  nervous sign Gemini rising and  the  restless,  unconventional
Uranus  on  the Ascendant in opposition to Jupiter,  ruler of  the  arterial
blood,  this man was an easy prey to pneumonia,  as the capillaries  of  the
lungs were contracted, which made oxygenation spasmodic.

   The sun,  the life giver, we find in the 11th house in Aries,  in opposi-
tion to the retrograde Saturn in Libra.  Saturn is in his exaltation in  Li-
bra and very powerful.  We would ordinarily look for the greatest trouble in
the corresponding part of the body.   This man would some time have suffered
with  renal disorder as the body was very sluggish and charged with  impuri-
ties  and  the  kidneys had not been eliminating properly for  a  number  of
years.   He has always been a hearty enter.   With Mars in Cancer square  to
Neptune,  he has been very immoderate and abnormal in the indulgence of  his
appetite, also too fond of liquids.

   The planets frequently work in opposites.   In this case we find that the
sign Aries is the seat of the principal trouble.  This man was paralyzed af-
ter the effects of pneumonia were overcome.

   We  can see the difference between these two men.   14A is more  able  to
overcome disease,  having the fiery,  ambitious sign of Aries on the  Ascen-
dant.  He has better  circulation  for  he  has  Mercury  and Jupiter trine.

14B has the restless,  emotional Uranus in Gemini on the Ascendant badly af-
flicted, and it is very difficult for him to remain quiet and calm; his emo-

                         NO. 14C--D:  DEFECTIVE WALK

   A  pair of most interestingly similar charts,  both in aspects and  symp-
toms,  will now be considered.  We will first take figure No. 14C, that of a
boy born November 25, 1899, 0:30 A.M.

   We find the vacillating and negative moon in the 12th house near the  As-
cendant,  as the ruler of the horoscope.  This planet is square to  the  sun
and Uranus.   These last two planets are in conjunction in Sagittarius,  the
sign which has rule over the hips,  the sacral region of the spine,  and the
coccygeal  region.   Sagittarius also has rule over the iliac  arteries  and
veins,  sciatic nerves,  and locomotor muscles in hips and thighs.   We also
find Mars in this sign of the hips, in conjunction with Venus, Mercury,  and
Saturn.   Venus rules the venous blood, and wherever this planet  is  placed
and  afflicted,  the circulation in that part of the body is impeded.   Mars
burns up while Saturn restricts,  contracts, and dries up.   So we find that
the circulation is interfered with by these two afflicting planets,  and  as
Mercury rules the nerves we might expect that this boy would suffer from re-
strictions in the region of the hips.   Neptune,  the higher octave of  Mer-
cury,  works  upon the nervous system and rules the spinal canal.   In  this
horoscope Neptune is placed in the 10th house in an angle where his power is
greater than when placed in a cadent or succeedent house.   We also find him
in the  sign  of  Mercury  (Gemini) which rules the upper spinal nerves.  As

Neptune is in opposition to Venus, Mercury,  and Saturn,  and parallel  with
Saturn,  Mars, and Uranus, through this planet which has so many aspects and
the greater number of them  afflictions,  we  can  locate  the  seat  of the

trouble--obstruction in the nervous system and spinal fluids.


   This  boy has never been able to walk without staggering like  a  drunken
man.  Gemini being the sign of speech, and Mercury the planet ruling speech,
Neptune  in  Gemini has prevented his from learning to use  the  faculty  of
speech.  With the moon, the life ruler, afflicted in Virgo (the moon  having

rule over the white fluids of the body,  and Mercury,  the small intestine),
it  will be doubtful whether this young man can overcome these  afflictions,
for  a negative sign is rising and the afflictions from angles are  stronger
than the will of the patient.

                               NO. 14D


   The second figure,  that of a young man born March 17,  1900,  1:00 A.M.,
has  the  energetic sign of Sagittarius on the Ascendant with  Jupiter,  the
life ruler,  in its own sign in the 12th house, in conjunction with the ner-
vous  and  erratic Uranus,  which is co-ruler of the horoscope.   These  two
planets  are  also  in  conjunction with the Dragon's  Head  with  is  of  a
Jupiterian nature.   They are afflicted by a square of Mars,  from the  sign
Pisces,  also a parallel of Neptune and Saturn.   With these afflictions  of
Jupiter ruling the arterial blood, in the two Jupiterian signs,  Sagittarius
(hips) and Pisces (the feet), what may we expect but that the arterial blood
would be obstructed in the limbs?  As the action of Uranus is spasmodic,  it
shows that at certain times only does this young man suffer with cramping of
the motor nerves.  But we find Saturn, the planet of obstruction,  strong in
its own sign of Capricorn, ruling the knees, afflicted by the square of  the

moon  from near the Midheaven,  also by the square of Mercury in Aries.   As
the  joints of the body are largely ruled by the sign Capricorn,  especially
when  Saturn is placed in this sign and afflicted,  we may expect a lack  of
power in and control of the lower part of the body.

   We find Neptune, the planet ruling the spinal canal and the spinal spirit
fire,  square to the life-giving sun.   This aspect acts upon the body as  a
disconnected  wire would upon a telephone; there would be no response.   The
vital fluids cannot flow freely through the spinal column; and the upper and
lower part of the body may be likened to two disconnected wires.  This  boy,

like the first one, could not walk without the support of crutches; but this
affliction was very slight until he reached the age of seven years when  the
progressed moon reached the conjunction of the radical Saturn;  then he lost
entire control of his limbs.

   We are told in Galatians,  6th chapter, 7th verse,  that whatsoever a man
soweth,  that shall he also reap.   The question might be asked,  "How could
these  poor young men he held responsible for something that came upon  them
as babes?"   We are told that this life is not all,  that we have lived many
lives,  and that we are born to parent with whom we have made ties in previ-
ous  lives.   They are the instruments through which we are to  receive  our
lessons.  As we look into the lives of these poor souls we see this exempli-
fied.   They have been attracted to parents who could give them certain bod-
ies,  the archetype of which they themselves were the builders.   We note in
Horoscope No. 14C that Neptune is in the 10th house, opposition Saturn,  Ve-
nus,  and Mercury in the 4th house,  indicating lewdness and  drunkeness  of
both parents;  while in No. 14D the moon is afflicted in the 9th house by an
opposition of Mercury, and Saturn in square to both Mercury and moon,  indi-
cating a drunken father and a nervous and neuresthenic mother.

   May the poor boys born into these miserably afflicted bodies learn  their
lessons,  as  afflictions are to the soul what fire is to  gold--a  refiner.
Surely  the experiences in this life will bring them much  purification  and
soul growth.

                        NO. 14E--EXAGGERATED HYSTERIA
                 Female, born December 5th, 1873, 8:45 P.M.

   This horoscope has the positive,  vital, and fixed sign of Leo on the As-
cendant,  with the ruler,  the sun, in the fifth house in Sagittarius.   The
moon and Saturn are very strong in their own home signs.  Saturn, the planet
of obstruction,  is in Capricorn in the sixth house,  the house of sickness.
We  usually  look  to  such a planet and its position for  the  key  to  the
trouble.   Saturn is square to the retrograde planet Neptune,  which  is  in
conjunction with the Midheaven and in the impulsive sign of Aries.   Neptune
is the higher octave of Mercury; it is in the ninth house, ruling the higher
mind.   In such a case we may expect to find brain storms or  some  abnormal
mental trouble.

   The moon is in its own sign,  Cancer,  square to Jupiter.   Therefore the
native  can  expect little help from the moon,  and so we must look  to  the
planet  Mercury to see if the mind is to receive assistance to overcome  the
square of Neptune to Saturn.  Mercury is retrograde,  which makes its influ-
ence latent,  and in the sign of its fall,  the common and negative sign  of
Sagittarius.  Mercury, however, while weak by sign and retrograde, is helped
by  a sextile of Jupiter and by one of Saturn.   This will save  the  native

   Neptune in Aries square to Saturn causes the mind to become very selfish,
adn  from  childhood this native has demanded that others  grant  her  every
wish.  She would throw herself into a spasm in order to get what she  wanted

from her parents.  This habit grew upon her, and when she reached the age of
menopause, she had no control whatever over her emotions.  The doctors diag-
nosed her case as exaggerated hysteria.

   As  the progressed sun neared the conjunction with the radical  Mars  and
the opposition to the radical Uranus, heart trouble developed as a result of
the strain which she had put upon her body all through life by these selfish
spells.   With Neptune in Aries, square to Saturn,  she is lacking in mental
control and allows the emotional Uranus and Mars to entirely rule her life.

   Here is a case where the parents were much to blame by permitting her  as
a child to have her own way.   If they had controlled her in these spells in
the beginning, even though it had necessitated severe methods and caused the
clashing  of wills,  it would have helped her to get mastery over  the  emo-
tions.   But as it is they permitted her to have her way,  which has  caused
her untold suffering and may bring a fatal ending.

   This  is  a case in which the patient precipitated  her  trouble  through
violent  actions.   There is no reason whatever for poor  health  with  only
three afflictions,  namely, Saturn square Neptune and the Midheaven,  Uranus
in  conjunction  with the Ascendant and in opposition to Mars,  and  Jupiter
square the moon; while there are 15 good aspects in the horoscope, including
the  parallels and the sextile of the sun to Mars,  and fixed  and  cardinal
signs are on the angles.  It may well be said that this woman is digging her

   In this horoscope we have the common sign of Virgo on the Ascendant, com-
mon signs on the four angles,  and the afflicting planets are posited in the
common signs.   As a rule planetary afflictions from these weaker signs  are
more easily overcome than from cardinal or fixed signs, but when the patient
also has common signs on the four angles he will not make the effort  neces-
sary to overcome planetary conditions.

   We  find the sun in the martial and impulsive sign of Aries,  sextile  to
Uranus.  This latter planet is strong in its own sign of Aquarius.  The moon
is in the restless sign of Sagittarius, and the ruler of the Ascendant, Mer-
cury, is in conjunction with the fiery and impulsive Mars.  The positions of
these various planets will give this child a most impulsive,  restless,  and
ambitious nature, one which will keep her on the go constantly, and whatever
she  does  will  be  done  in a quick  and  impulsive  manner.   A  lack  of
self-control  is  shown.  She  will  eat  hurriedly,  failing to give proper

attention to the mastication of her food.   This hurry and impulse will have
a bad effect,  for Mercury ruling the nervous system,  conjunction Mars  and
square to the moon and the destructive Saturn,  will cause the nervous orga-
nization to become deranged each time that the native  gives  way  to  great


[PAGE 345]                                                        THE NERVES

excitement,  anger,  excesses in eating,  or anything which might produce  a
strain on the nerves.

   The moon has rule over the oesophagus and stomach,  and Saturn,  which is
posited  strongly in the Midheaven,  has rule over the pneumogastric  nerve.
Saturn  is in opposition to the moon, hence we may expect trouble  from  the
branches  of pneumogastric or vagus nerve.  The two divisions of this  great
nerve,  the oesophageal and the gastric branches,  are obstructed  in  their
functions by Saturn, and this interferes with peristaltic action.  The slug-
gish action of the oesophagus and the cardiac orifice cause the good to move
too slowly through this tube before it reaches the stomach,  and then it re-
mains  too  long  a time in the stomach before it is  digested,  for  Saturn
causes a sluggish condition of these organs.   This may result in great dis-
tress.

   This girl suffered intensely with stomach trouble once every six or eight
days,  the time varying.   These spells may be traced to the effect  of  the
transiting moon as it passed through the common signs,  forming the conjunc-
tion,  opposition,  or square of the planets in these signs.  The moon tran-
siting  over its radical place in Sagittarius,  over Mercury,  Jupiter,  and
Mars in Pisces, and over Saturn in Gemini will bring these afflicted periods
once a week.

   The  parents consulted a number of doctors,  each one giving a  different
diagnosis.  One  physician  was  positive  of  cancer and wanted to operate.

Between these spells of stomach trouble the girl seemed to be in fairly good
health.

   In  a  case  of this kind undue excitement and  all  excesses  should  be
avoided,  at  the time of the moon's transits over  the  afflicted  planets.
Caution in the choice of food should be exercised.   All coarse foods  which
are hard to digest should be avoided, and everything that is eaten should be
well masticated before it enters the oesophageal tube.

   Sagittarius 24-24 is on the Ascendant in the present instance and the in-
flammatory and destructive Mars,  the planet of impulse,  is on the cusp  of
the Ascendant in the pleasure-loving and heedless sign of Sagittarius.  This
man  was specially fond of horses.   Mercury is in the 12th house in  Sagit-
tarius,  sextile to the impulsive Uranus in the 11th house,  friends,  which
shows a desire for swift action, racing, fast driving, et cetera.  Mars, the
ruler of the fifth house, which has rule over pleasures, is sextile Jupiter.
This young man met with accident caused by horses.

   We  find that at the age of 21 years the boy's progressed sun  and  Venus
were in conjunction with the radical Mercury and sextile to Uranus, the pro-
gressed  Mars  having  just passed the square to  Uranus,  and  reached  the
sextile to Venus, indicating a most pleasurable time with friends.   But the

fall had bruised the bone and it had rotted.

   We find Saturn in the 8th house in Cancer square to Jupiter, which is the
ruler of the Ascendant.  The moon is in its exaltation sign of Taurus,  rul-
ing the palate, and in the fifth  house, hence there was a desire for drink.


[PAGE 349]                                                         THE BONES

From the indications in the 11th house, friends,  he was wined and dined un-
til  he had his body over charged with ash.   Now when this is the case  and
the boy is unable to take care of the excess of rich food,  the toxic  prod-
ucts  settle in the weakest place.  With Jupiter afflicted in  Libra,  which
has  rule  over the kidneys,  these organs were overworked and not  able  to
eliminate the toxins and poisonous matter.   The bruised femur naturally was
the point which attracted this toxic poison,  and decomposition  necessarily
took place.

   After  a number of operations the native passed out in June,  1918,  when
the progressed sun was nearing a conjunction with the Ascendant and the pro-
gressed  moon  was in Cancer in conjunction with Saturn in  the  8th  house,
death;  also the progressed Mars was then within one degree of an opposition
to Saturn.

   Now  had  this young man been in touch with a physician  who  could  have
properly  adjusted  the misplaced femur and who would have placed him  on  a
strict  vegetarian diet,  eliminating all meats and highly seasoned food  in
order to keep the blood pure, there would have been great possibilities that
the  life  might  have  been prolonged and that he  would  not  have  become
paralyzed.   But unfortunately he was in a small town in far-off New Zealand
where proper aid could not be obtained.  The dislocated and bruised bone was
neglected,  and the diet was largely composed of flesh foods  as  vegetables
were very scarce there at that time.

   It  is the rule when looking for physical ailments to take the  ruler  of
the 6th house,  which rules sickness,  and find the position of this  planet
and its aspects.  In this horoscope we find 28 degrees of Sagittarius on the
cusp of the 6th house,  but the influences of this sign is almost spent  be-
fore reaching this house.  We therefore consider Capricorn,  the sign on the
7th house,  with 28 degrees on the cusp.   The greater part of this sign  is
thus thrown into the 6th house;  therefore we may consider Saturn as  having
rule over the house of sickness.

   We find this disturbing and crystallizing planet in 24-37 Sagittarius  in
conjunction with the inflammatory Mars and in opposition to Neptune and  the
Dragon's  Tail.   We are told on page 566 of THE MESSAGE OF THE  STARS  that
Neptune  rules the spinal gas,  or spinal fluid as the doctors call it.   We
find  Neptune in conjunction with the Dragon's Tail in the sign  of  Gemini,
which has rule over the arms and the region of the 6th and 7th cervical  and
the 1st,  2nd, and 3rd dorsal vertebrae.  We find Mars and Saturn in the re-
gion  of  the  lower  end  of  the  spine, the sacral or Sagittarian region.

and inflammatory and Saturn is cold and moist, with a restricting influence.

   We also find Uranus,  the sun, and Mercury in conjunction and parallel in
this  same  part  of  the  body,  namely  the  sacral or Sagittarian region.

Wherever we find two hot, fiery planets such as the sun and Mars, we may ex-
pect that much of the heat and vitality of the body will be brought to  this
region,  and when the restricting influence of Saturn is opposed to the  ab-
normal  and ossifying influence of an afflicted Neptune in the opposite  re-
gion, namely the upper end of the spinal column, both exerting a harmful in-
fluence,  we may liken the spinal fluid of the patient to a stream of  water
which has been dammed at both ends.   No fresh water is allowed to flow  in,
and  the  old and stagnant water must remain and become  polluted.   As  the
greater  number  of  afflictions  are to be  found  in  the  sacral  region,
naturally the greater amount of impurity is also lodged there.

   This  young  girl developed arthritis of the hip joints at a  very  early
age, partly on account of the neglect of the parents, who were very inharmo-
nious.   The father was a drunkard and libertine and the mother careless and
neglectful of her home duties,  spending most of her time away from home and
leaving three little girls to shift for themselves.  It was never definitely
known whether the beginning of this disease was due to an accident;  but the
stars  indicate a fall,  which no doubt bruised the hip bone or  the  sacral
bones and was probably the first cause of the disease.   Gradually the right
leg atrophied, and the spine became bent.

   In 1917 this girl called on Headquarters for the healing of her hand  in-
jured  in  an  accident.  Here  we  may again note the influence of Mars and

Saturn in conjunction, which had their effect in the opposite sign,  Gemini,
and  caused the breaking of one of the fingers.   The bone became  affected,
and the doctors were unable to do anything to heal it.  With the help of the
Invisible Helpers, however, and a strict vegetarian diet she recovered.  But
the native has inherited tainted blood from the father,  in conjunction with
Saturn and in opposition to Neptune, which would indicate the affliction  of
the father, namely, the dread disease gonorrhoea.  Parents with this disease
frequently attract souls for rebirth who must needs suffer from spinal  dis-
eases,  blindness,  etc.  "The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind ex-
ceeding small."

   Male, born January 9, 1898, 8:00 A.M.

   This lesson is based on the horoscope of a man who has the fixed sign  of
Aquarius  on the Ascendant,  and fixed signs on all the angles indicating  a
nature  that  has  the will strongly developed,  and with  the  sun  in  the
Saturnian  sign of Capricorn there is indication that he has  great  persis-
tence in resisting disease.

   How well he has succeeded in his fight is shown by the aspect between the
sun and Mars, which often shows the extent of the damage which may have been
done to the physical body.  Any aspect between Mars and the sun, even though
it be a square or an opposition, is better than no aspect.   Strong signs on
the  angles  and the sun in a determined sign is an indication of  power  to
overcome physical restrictions.  But in this case the sun is void of aspects
to Mars showing that the disease has mastery over the man.

   Mars, which is exalted in Capricorn, is in conjunction with Venus, square
to Jupiter,  and elevated in the 11th house,  indicating liability to  acci-
dents.   Mars in the 11th house also shows that friends would be responsible
for leading him into danger.

   In  1917 the progressed Mars had reached a conjunction and a parallel  of

the  radical Saturn and Uranus.   This indicates that during the year  1917,
while  with  friends and horses this man sustained an injury to one  of  the
bones of the leg, which although at the time seemed but a bad bruise, never-
theless was a deep-seated injury.  We will see now how clearly and precisely
the clock of destiny registers events.   On December 3,  1918,  there was an
eclipse  of  the sun in 10-31 of Sagittarius,  conjunction with  this  man's
radical  Saturn.   The effect of an eclipse lasts during all the year  which
follows.  In 1919 we find the progressed sun conjunction the Ascendant, pro-
gressed Venus opposition to the radical moon,  and the progressed Mars  con-
junction  the radical sun.   We have here three afflictions during the  year
following the eclipse, and when the transiting moon on June 5, 1919, fell in
square  to the place of the eclipse at the same time making a square to  the
radical Uranus and Saturn,  the young man was taken with severe pains in the
right ankle,  followed by chills and fever.  From that time the leg began to
swell and a large abscess formed,  which was lanced by the doctor.   As soon
as one abscess healed another would form and in eight months he had been op-
erated on for abscesses at least ten times.   By 1920 pus began to run  from
small  holes  in  the  ankle  and  the  doctors  diagnosed  the  disease  as
"osteomyelitis."

   On  April  26th,  1924,  this man again entered the hospital for  an  op-
eration,  and at this time small pieces of bone were chipped away for  seven
inches up the leg.


[PAGE 357]                                                         THE BONES

   In August 1924,  when he called upon Headquarters for healing he was  re-
turning to the hospital for another operation.

   It is unfortunate that many doctors do not realize that operations or re-
movals  of parts of the body will never permanently cure so long as the  pa-
tient is not put on a proper diet.

   The  writer visited a friend in a hospital a short time ago who  was  se-
verely injured in an automobile accident.  While she was strictly a vegetar-
ian and disliked meat, the doctors compelled her to eat plentifully of meats
and broths while her wounds were healing.

   In the horoscope of this young man under consideration we find Venus con-
junction Mars in a Saturnian sign,  and square to Jupiter.   Venus and  Mars
are the rulers of the 4th and 10th houses indicating the parents,  from whom
he  had inherited scrofulous blood.   So we may realize that no  matter  how
many bones the doctors may remove from his limb the real disease which is in
the blood, can only be cured by the strictest vegetarian or fruit diet.

   Male, born April 27, 1868, 6:37 P.M.

   In  the  horoscope before us we consider first the  mental  qualities  as
shown in particular by Mercury and the moon.  Mercury has three aspects, the
conjunction  with its higher octave Neptune, which occurs in Aries the  sign
of the head,  a sextile to Venus in the Mercurial sign Gemini,  and a square
to the moon in Cancer.  We also note that Mercury goes before the sun.  This
shows a kindly disposition and fairly good reasoning ability, though the na-
tive will not employ the ordinary processes of reasoning,  but will use  the
Neptunian method in all his mental operations.

   The  moon in the ninth house in the psychic sign Cancer,  its home  sign,
and  in conjunction with Uranus gives marked intuition.   Saturn  in  Sagit-
tarius, the 9th house sign, trine to Jupiter, the ruler of Sagittarius, will
help to bring order into the native's thoughts, with the result that he will
be much more balanced than inspirational people  usually  are.  Nevertheless

he  will  always  stand out from the crowd for he is marked  as  a  dreamer.
Uranus  and  the moon conjoined in the 9th house,  the house of  the  higher
mind, will overrule everything else.  But the other  configurations  bearing

upon this matter save him from becoming foolish and a butt for jokes.

   With respect to his health, we note first that the ruler of Aries is near
the  cusp  of  the 6th  house  in conjunction with Neptune.  Neptune makes a


[PAGE 360]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

conjunction  with Mercury,  which will make this man very sensitive and  ir-
ritable,  offsetting  in that respect at times what we said  concerning  the
kindly disposition denoted by Mercury sextile to Venus.  The moon and uranus
in Cancer,  the sign which governs the stomach,  shows that it will be  very
difficult to please him with respect to food, and the square of Mars to this
configuration  shows that he is likely to have gastric trouble when the  re-
sistance of the system in broken down.  Strong drink will be craved,  and if
this desire is indulged, the psychic experiences of delirium are inevitable.

   Spirit  controls  are very apt to take possession of the body of  such  a
person  even apart from drink because the square of the moon and  Uranus  to
Neptune and Mars favors such a condition, and temporary insanity at least is
liable to occur.

   Part of these statements have already been realized, for this patient has
applied to Headquarters for relief from unwelcome attention of spirits which
he had attracted at spiritualistic seances.   He rebelled very much  against
the  diet which was prescribed for him and could not be made to keep up  the
weekly letters.   There is considerable hope, however,  from the sun sextile
to the moon and Uranus that the Ego will ultimately free itself from outside
influences,  though this will naturally cause the native a great  deal  more
trouble  than if he had remained on the healing list until cured instead  of
doing as he has done and as so many do.


[PAGE 361]                                                    SPIRIT CONTROL

   The  moment such people feel the slightest relief they think there is  no
need for further help from others.   That is not a bad attitude to take  be-
cause upon the Path of Attainment it is continually held up as an ideal that
"if thou art Christ,  help thyself."   There are too many leaners who do not
wish to bear their responsibility,  who shirk it whenever they can,  who are
always applying for help whenever they have even a toothache; some have even
telegraphed  because  of a headache and other ridiculously  small  ailments.
Therefore it is always best to encourage patients to help themselves as soon
as it is possible,  for in that way they gain spiritually even if physically
their progress is more slow.

   In a case of this nature the simplest diet should be prescribed in  order
to soothe the nerves:  lettuce if it is at all obtainable, and onions in the
evening  in any case.   Such a diet, and exercises to limber up  the  spine,
particularly in the lumbar region where Saturn in Sagittarius has a grip  on
the sciatic nerves,  will in time restore such a patient to health  provided
he avoids liquor and stays away from spiritualistic seances.

                        NO. 16B.--OBSESSION--TONSILS

   Female, born August 17, 1881, at 9 A.M.

   This horoscope is that of a woman who has the sign of Libra on the Ascen-
dant,  with cardinal signs on all four angles.   The sun in the positive and
fixed sign of Leo indicates that she will have determination well developed.
This determination,  however,  may be expressed in he form of  stubbornness,
for  Mercury is in Leo in the 10th house,  square Saturn and Neptune,  these
last  two  planets  being in the fixed and stubborn  sign  of  Taurus.   the
squares of the above three planets, Saturn, Neptune,  and Mercury,  are from
the natural Capricorn or Saturnian 10th house, which is a dominant position,
to the 8th house, which is the natural Scorpio or Mars house;  so we may ex-
pect  that this woman will be very fixed in nature and determined to  follow
her own inclinations.

   Her ideals or desires should have been expressed through Venus in Cancer,
conjunction the Midheaven.  Venus is sextile to Saturn, Neptune,  and Uranus
and parallel to the moon and Mars.  This gives talent for art or music, also
a  love for dress and display,  and Venus being ruler of the  Ascendant,  it
should also give a sweet personality coupled with beauty of face and figure.
According to the diagnosis of psycho-analysis this woman during the years of
adolescence, when the life forces  were  welling  up  and the latent talents


[PAGE 363]                                                    SPIRIT CONTROL

were seeking a means of expression, which would naturally be through art and
music, was not finding her field.  Her ideals were crushed as a result,  and
the spirit felt cramped and restrained.

   We may here see that Saturn,  the ruler of the 4th house,  indicating the
mother,  is restraining Neptune, the ruler of the 6th house, which indicates
the service to be rendered.   Mercury in the 10th,  the house of the profes-
sion,  is  squaring Saturn and Neptune.   We have here the  proof  that  the
mother was not in sympathy with this woman's choice  of  a  profession,  and


[PAGE 364]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

forced her to express herself through channels where the spirit felt cramped
and  the artistic instincts were held in check.   In the case of a weak  and
negative  personality this sometimes works to advantage and the person  does
not  feel the restraint.   But with a fixed and positive nature such  as  we
have in this horoscope,  with five planets in fixed signs and cardinal signs
on the four angles, the case is different; when a woman of this type has her
ideals shattered,  she finds it most difficult to adjust herself to the will
of others.   The impulses thus restrained most frequently find an expression
in some other direction.

   In  this case we find Neptune and Saturn trine Uranus;  the psychic  side
must then be the means of giving this soul relief from its pent-up feelings.
Uranus is square Mars, and the moon is conjunction and parallel Mars.  These
afflictions together with those of Saturn,  Neptune,  and Mercury gave  this
woman a negative development.  Mediumship was most attractive to her.  For a
short time she had the greatest joy for she developed very rapidly, which we
may see from Neptune trine Uranus, indicating psychism.   But had this  poor
soul had a knowledge of astrology and could she have seen the danger signals
in  the  planets  she  would not have meddled with  the  negative  phase  of
spiritual development.  She would not have forced her development as we have


[PAGE 365]                                                    SPIRIT CONTROL

found that she did.   Being a positive character the Invisible Helpers  were
able  with her assistance to relieve her in a short time of a very bad  case
of obsession, which she had developed through the practice of mediumship.

   The advice given to this woman through Headquarters was to eat lightly of
food consisting mainly of vegetables and fruits,  eliminating heavy proteins
and starches,  and to keep her mind and body active, not forgetting to pray,
for prayer is a wonderful help and a protection against adverse psychism.

   We also find in this horoscope a very helpful lesson relative to  trouble
with the throat.  We find Neptune and Saturn in conjunction in Taurus, which
rules the throat and larynx, square to Mercury in Leo;  also Jupiter in Tau-
rus  is  square to the sun in Leo,  indicating that the circulation  of  the
throat would be impaired at some time.   Whenever we find Saturn and Neptune
in  conjunction  there is some difficulty in the development of  the  corre-
sponding  organ.   This woman developed a very bad case of tonsillitis,  and
submitted herself to an operation in which the tonsils were removed.

but knowledge of the rising sign is necessary,  however,  in determining the

the exact time of birth in order to calculate the place of the moon and  its
relation to the transiting planets.  These planets act as the minute hand of
the  planetary clock.   They determine by their aspects to the  radical  and
progressed planets whether the disease has reached a critical point.   Espe-

atrophy or an undersized organ in whatever part of the body he may be  found
by sign.   If in Leo, he may cause one valve of the heart to be smaller than
the others, producing irregularity of circulation.  In this horoscope,  how-
ever, we find Neptune between  Venus and the sun, which gives bulk,  The sun

brings heat and a large supply of blood to that part of the body in which it
is placed by sign.  In this case the throat is the part receiving the great-
est flow of blood.   When Mars is square to the sun or Venus we may find the
corresponding organ enlarged abnormally.  Mercury, the plant which rules the
thyroid  gland,  is in Taurus,  square to Uranus in the fixed sign  of  Leo.
Uranus in this sign also has a tendency to enlarge the organ affected by it.
Jupiter, which rules the arterial circulation, is square to the moon.

   This woman suffered from an enlarged thyroid gland,  which reached such a
size that it interfered with the circulation and caused poor heart action.

configuration,  particularly the obstructing influence of Saturn,  caused  a
disturbance in the thyroid gland, which, however, was not enlarged as in the
previous case, but its functions and circulation were interfered with.  This
caused  the man to suffer from weakened memory,  deranged kidneys,  and  en-
largement of the prostate gland.

   What could be advised in order to help these patients?   might be  asked.
In the case of the woman of the first horoscope, where an excess of blood is
found in the throat and both Jupiter and Venus are afflicted,  causing  poor
arterial  and  venous circulation,  we would advise a brisk rubbing  of  the
lower  limbs with a pair of bath gloves,  also hot foot baths to  cause  the
blood to circulate more freely to the lower part of the body thereby  taking
the  pressure away from the throat.   We would also decrease the  amount  of
food which makes for flesh, such as white bread,  pastries,  sugar,  and the
like.   In the second horoscope we find the moon in Pisces,  a watery  sign,
which gives a craving for liquids.   It is square to Uranus.   This together
with the conjunction of Venus with Mars, sun,  and Saturn indicates that the
lower nature,  especially sex, has been the native's undoing.   We would ad-
vise elimination of highly seasoned foods, liquor,  tobacco,  and meat,  and
that he live a simple life with plenty of outdoor exercise.

   Male, born August 16, 1918, 1:45 A.M.

   This is the horoscope of a young boy who has the watery and cardinal sign
of Cancer on the Ascendant.  People with cardinal signs on the Ascendant are
more  tense,  or we may call it more high-strung and sensitive than  others.
They feel more keenly.  Not alone are their feelings more quickly hurt,  but
their bodies are more sensitive to pain, and heir suffering is more intense.

   This  boy has the magnanimous and jovial Jupiter in conjunction with  the
Ascendant.   Jupiter is parallel to the moon, which is the ruler of the  As-
cendant,  and Jupiter and the moon are in mutual exception.   The suave  and
loving  Venus is in the first house, which will give the native a  beautiful
form and face and a most lovable and attractive personality.

   At the age of about twenty months he was taken ill with meningitis, which
is  an inflammation of the membranes enveloping the brain and  spinal  cord.
He recovered from this illness,  but his head began to enlarge,  and he lost
his sense of hearing.  The enlargement of the head became so pronounced that
it necessitated operations.   At two periods a little past the age of  three
years  (we  judge  the first to have been about  when  the  progressed  moon
reached 27 degrees of Capricorn,  which brought it to the opposition of  Ve-
nus, or two months later when it reached the square of Mars)  two operations

relieve the back of the head by two operations just behind the ears,  one on
each side of the head.   We are unable to give the exact dates of these  op-

probably marked the time of the operation on the back of the head.

   The  parents  brought this boy from the middle West to  Los  Angeles  and
placed him in charge of a noted osteopathic physician, who superintended the
operations  and treated him with the scientific manipulations of the  modern
and excellent method of healing,  osteopathy.   The parents also placed  the
child  on our healing list with the hope that he might regain his  sense  of
hearing,  which  he lost at about the age of one and  one-half  years.   The
writer  was not made familiar with the past of the boy until after  she  had
diagnosed the case to a friend, so we will see how closely the planets tally
with the case.

   Venus, which has rule over the thymus gland, is strong in the first house
and  is afflicted by the square of Mars.  Mars is close to the cusp  of  its
own sign Scorpio.   Mars indicates injuries.  Scorpio is the sign which  has
rule over the physician.  The birth of this boy was a very labored one.  The
life  of  the  mother  as well as that of the boy  was  despaired  of.   The
present-day  physician  does not allow the birth to be a natural one  if  it
takes  too much of his time,  for he is too busy and must hurry back to  his
office to see his other patients.  Consequently a large proportion of births
are hurried through the use of instruments.   In this case the forced  birth
caused an injury to certain nerves and to the innominate blood vessels which
carry the blood through the thymus gland to the brain.   With Saturn in con-
junction with  the sun in Leo, which has rule over the spinal cord, and both


[PAGE 374]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

in  opposition  to  Uranus the spinal fluid  was  restricted  and  sluggish.
Uranus,  which is the higher octave of Venus,  has rule over  the  pituitary
body.   This body is connected directly with the outer sheath of the  spinal
cord, the dura mater Uranus being afflicted by the sun and Saturn has inter-
fered much with the functions of the spinal fluids.

   The  thymus gland in a small child regulates the blood flow to  and  from
the brain through the innominate artery and vein.  At birth the neck of this
child  was in some manner injured,  causing restriction of the flow  of  the
blood.   The circulation being restricted, the head consequently filled with
water.   The  most interesting proof of this is that at the removal  of  the
pieces of bone from the temples,  also from the back of the head,  there was
no red blood in the wounds, at which the doctors marveled.   The osteopathic
physician  had been very active in his manipulations and treatments  of  the
thymus gland and the spinal column, showing that his diagnosis tallied  with
ours.

   The boy is seemingly in good health but has lost his hearing.   There  is
some  hope that this may be regained.  When he reaches puberty and the  thy-
roid gland takes up the work of the thymus gland,  the nerves and the  blood
vessels  which serve the ear may be stimulated,  and through the aid of  the
Invisible Helpers the hearing may be regained.  There is, however, some dan-
ger  that  the operations which were performed on the back of the  head  may
have permanently injured the nerves, which would affect the hearing.

   Female, born November 27th, 1905, 1:15 P.M.

   This young woman has the watery and negative sign of Pisces on the Ascen-
dant, and Jupiter, the ruler, retrograde in Gemini in the third house in op-
position to the life-giving sun.   This to begin with is a much hampered and
restricted  ruler,  and is an indication that this soul has  in  its  former
lives contracted debts of destiny which have matured and await their payment
in  this  life;  for if the life ruler is afflicted  by  the  most  powerful
planet,  namely the sun, also the square of Saturn and the parallel of Mars,
and is receiving little help,  having only one helpful aspect,  the trine of
Mars from the twelfth house,  then we may take it that this person will have
her debts to pay in this life,  and there will be no freedom until they  are
liquidated.

   We  find a very well-aspected Mercury in the 10th house,  in  conjunction
with the moon, the Midheaven, and Uranus, and sextile to Saturn.   The moon,
which has partial rule over the mind,  is in conjunction with the Midheaven,
giving the native a quick,  keen mind.   From a mental standpoint this  girl
should be able to accomplish anything upon which she sets her mind,  and one
wonders  why such a mind is seemingly not accomplishing anything.   What  is
the cause?

   We find common signs on all the four angles; the life ruler, Jupiter,  is
retrograde in the common sign of Gemini, which is the sign of its fall,  and
the sun also is in a common sign.   These are indications that this soul  is
satisfied to drift with the tide.   Whatever headway she makes in this  life
will be through the prodding influence of the father, signified by the tenth

   Jupiter has rule over the arterial circulation.   His afflictions tend to
restrict the free flow of the blood stream.   Jupiter also has rule over the
adrenals, the  two  tiny  ductless glands which are over the kidneys.  These


[PAGE 377]                                               THE DUCTLESS GLANDS

two organs,  like the thyroid gland, help to take care of the blood.   As it
passes through them, it receives its supply of adrenal secretion.   This se-
cretion gives energy to the body and causes the fluids to flow more  freely.
The adrenals are the organs which stimulate the body.  When we find Jupiter,
which  has  rule over these organs,  as the life ruler and so  severely  af-
flicted,  we may expect the patient to be lacking in energy,  a negative and
ambitionless person.

   Neptune,  which is the higher octave of Mercury,  works upon the  nervous
system,  and rules the pineal gland and the spinal canal.   It is retrograde
and  in  opposition to the spasmodic and erratic Uranus,  the  planet  which
rules the pituitary body.   Therefore we may look for a general  derangement
of the ductless glands.   We find a disturbance of the adrenals,  which  are
excited  by  the  emotions,  causing an uneven  flow  of  their  secretions,
sometimes resulting in convulsions or the opposite,  coma,  according to the
character of the uncontrolled emotions of the patient.

   This girl is the daughter of a wealthy father and a most self-willed  and
selfish mother, who is addicted to the use of cigarettes and liquor.   While
the  mother was pregnant with this child, at times when she saw her  husband
coming from his place of business she would throw herself into a fit in  or-
der to work on his sympathy.   In this manner she would get all her  selfish
wants supplied.  We are told in he Rosicrucian teachings that the Ego is at-
tracted to a parent through whom it may receive its lessons, and it may well


[PAGE 378]                                                   ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS

be  said that this girl found in her mother one who could bring to her  many
sad lessons.

   If the girl is crossed she quickly flies into a rage which ends in a  fit
very similar to epilepsy.  However, she does not froth at the mouth, neither
do  her  jaws set,  as is sometimes the case in the above  disease.   Temper
causes the adrenal fluid to flow too rapidly into the blood.  Excess of this
fluid causes jealousy and envy.

   We find two different conditions expressed in the spells under which this
girl  labors.   Jupiter is in opposition to the sun,  and parallel to  Mars,
which causes at times an excess of secretions,  giving rise to the condition
already mentioned.  At other time she will swoon away, being perfectly life-
less  and rigid.   This last condition is brought on when the adrenals  stop
sending  their fluid into the blood, indicated by Saturn square to  Jupiter.
When  under the first mentioned condition she has all the appearance of  one
who  is obsessed and becomes very cruel to those about her.   This  is  also
shown in the horoscope by the opposition of Neptune to Uranus.

   The father has spent a fortune trying first one doctor and then  another,
but to no avail.   The girl is quite normal when not laboring under the  in-
fluence of these spells.   She,  like her mother,  also throws herself  into
them in order to work upon the sympathy of her mother, sisters, and father.

   The latest diagnosis of  the  doctors  is  that a tumor is growing in the


[PAGE 379]                                               THE DUCTLESS GLANDS

brain near the cerebellum, and both the girl and her mother wish her to have
an operation,  while the father is bitterly opposed to it.  What the outcome
will be remains to be seen.   Should she submit to the knife,  as she is de-
termined to do, she may spend the remainder of her life in an institution as
a mental patient.

   A CHILD is the subject of this reading,  who was about fifteen months old
at the time the reading was originally made.   Ordinarily it might seem  su-
perfluous  to judge the character and mentality of one so young.   Neverthe-
less, when we consider the body from a spiritual standpoint as the temple of
an indwelling divine spirit,  it will be seen that the builder and architect
of  that temple must be taken into consideration from the very first  breath
until the time when the silver cord snaps.

   The mercurial sign Gemini is rising, but there is not the ordinary Gemini
nature,  for Saturn in Gemini puts his obstructive hand upon this child  and
will give a tendency to melancholy and a retiring disposition,  a desire  to
get away from society.

   Mercury and Venus in Aries,  square to the moon and Neptune,  give a ten-
dency to secretiveness, but the sextile of Saturn to Mars and Saturn's trine
to  Uranus  make the mind idealistic and energetic.  Thus on the whole there

discourage the tendency to secretiveness, encourage idealism,  and make  the
youngster   play   with  his  companions.  It  looks  very  much  as  though

he might be too much taken with himself,  and from the very earliest  child-
hood he should be taught to go among people.   He should never be allowed to
go out by himself more than can possibly be helped.

   Usually  children of this age sleep largely from morning till  night  and
from night till morning; as soon as they have received food they go out into
dreamland that assimilation may be carried on better.   But this is not  the
case with our little subject; sleeplessness,  restlessness,  and nervousness
are the results of the opposition of the moon and Neptune to Jupiter and the
square  of  these three planets to Mercury and Venus posited in  Aries,  the
sign governing the head.  Thus the whole nature is aquiver, the child cannot
get the needed rest, hence it is sick.

   The  main trouble comes from the fact that the moon is conjunct  Neptune.
This  interferes  with the distribution of the fluid  indispensable  to  as-
similation,  the lymph.   Jupiter is afflicted by these two planets,  and he
governs assimilation.  On account of these two facts the child will not grow
as fast as he might other wise.  He has peculiar notions about his food, and
these ideas will grow as he grows.   This tendency is one of the things that
must be dealt with firmly,  for the square of the moon to Venus gives abnor-
mal  cravings,  the moon and Neptune in Cancer will cause the child to  long
for something that he never finds,  and this might lead to the formation  of
habits that would be extremely dangerous.   No matter how he may protest and
though it may seem that ordinary foods do not agree with him,  he should  be
taught  to eat everything of a good and healthful nature that comes  on  the
table, for the  formation  of a healthy appetite will counteract the strange


[PAGE 383]                                                SPECIAL CONDITIONS

tendency that is dormant in his nature.  Sweets in moderation will help.

   The  circulation is interfered with by the affliction of Neptune and  the
moon to Venus and Jupiter.   Saturn and Uranus are strongly configurated  by
trine and parallel from airy signs; this further reacts upon the circulation
and makes it spasmodic.   The heart has a tendency to flutter on account  of
the presence of Uranus in Aquarius.  Thus the poor little child is consider-
ably afflicted to start with.   Nevertheless there is no need of worry,  for
the sun is trine to Jupiter and sextile to the moon and Neptune.   The  fact
also that it is in the marvelously vital sign of Taurus will operate to pre-
serve life,  and even Saturn on the Ascendant gives persistence,  resistance
to disease, and tenacity of life.

   There will be crises in the life, however, which knowledge of the forego-
ing will make it more easy for the parents to prepare for.   The most severe
one  will  come at the time of puberty.   Then the progressed moon  will  be
working in the 8th house,  the house of death,  and in opposition to its own
place, configurated with Neptune and square to Mercury and Venus.  This is a
serious  position but not all to be feared on account of the fact  that  the
sun is so strong in the horoscope.  Moreover the trine of Saturn and  Uranus
and the sextile of Saturn and Mars give a wonderful elasticity and energy to
the  nature so that no matter though the boy be brought near the  grave,  he
will have the resilience to recuperate with astonishing rapidity.

   At the present time it should be investigated as to whether the mother is
nursing the child,  and whether she has felt nervous and run down.   If  so,
the child should at once be put upon a diet of goat's milk,  which will give
the needed ether to compensate for the lack of lymph,  and though the  child
may not like the diet, he will grow accustomed to it.

   WE have here the horoscope of a man with the fixed sign of Taurus on  the
Ascendant,  and the ruler, Venus, posited just above the Ascendant in Taurus
and in the 12th house.  Venus is making but two major aspects, a conjunction
with the Ascendant,  and a square to the inflammatory Mars,  which is in the
fixed sign of Leo and in the 4th house.

   The sign of Taurus rules the neck, throat,  lower jaw,  larynx,  and ton-
sils,  and its opposite signs, Scorpio, rules the rectum,  descending colon,
urethra, and also the nose.  These  signs of Scorpio and Taurus are the most

vital signs of the twelve.   Mark the strange coincidence which lies in  the
fact that Taurus rules the greater part of the lower head and neck,  and the
organs adjacent to the upper end of the spinal column,  while Scorpio  slips
in  with  its  influence  by  ruling  the  nose  in  addition  to the organs

near the lower end of the spinal column.  Leo, the sign which squares Taurus
and Scorpio,  rules THE RIVER OF LIFE, the spinal fluid,  which connects the
organs ruled by Taurus and Scorpio.


[PAGE 386]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

   Now in the horoscope under consideration we find the inflammatory Mars in
Leo,  square  to  Venus in Taurus.   Venus,  being at  home  in  this  sign,
naturally  attracts to herself the inflammatory influence of  Mars  whenever
Mars is found either in Taurus or afflicting her in that sign.   Then we may
look for inflammatory troubles in the nose,  generative organs,  or  rectum.
We may also look for the polypus which is a small growth peduncular in shape
that grows from the mucous membrane of the nose,  and which often closes the
nasal passages,  causing difficulty in breathing.   It sometimes also  grows
within the vagina or rectum.  The habit of mouth breathing in children often
lays the foundation for these growths in the nose when planetary afflictions
are present in the horoscope.   The mucous membrane of the nose is then  ab-
normally  sensitive  and subject to irritation,  which may result  in  these
polypi, frequently causing hay fever or asthma.

   The  patient  whose  horoscope we are  considering  suffered  with  these
growths in both nasal passages, making it necessary that he breathe entirely
through the mouth.   The moon is in 4 degrees and 19 minutes of Libra in the
6th house,  which is the house of health.   The moon is the natural ruler of
Cancer,  the sign ruling the stomach.  At the age of twenty-eight,  when the
moon  by progression had reached its place at birth,  this man became  seri-
ously ill with painter's colic,  which later resulted in permanent injury to
the kidneys.  The latter is due to the moon and Saturn in Libra,  which sign
has rule over the kidneys.  This general break in the health  increased  the

small growths in the nose, which resulted in an operation when the moon pro-
gressed into Scorpio and was in opposition to Venus.

   By eliminating meat,  tobacco,  liquor,  and all condiments and living as
near as possible to nature's laws, this man is again enjoying good health.

   LEO, a fiery sign, here in on the Ascendant with the life ruler, the sun,
in  the  21th  house in Cancer in conjunction with Mercury  and  Uranus  and
square  to Neptune.   We know from our reading of THE MESSAGE OF  THE  STARS
that Cancer rules the stomach,  in which the greater amount of food must  be
digested.   This organ is the central supply station through which the  body
receives its sustenance.  Cancer also rules the esophagus,  the tube between
the pharynx and the stomach, and the thoracic duct, the principal duct which
carries the lymph of the body.

   The  plants  in  the  12th  and  6th  houses  when afflicted are the most


[PAGE 389]                                                SPECIAL CONDITIONS

detrimental  to health,  and in this horoscope we may look to th stomach  as
being the seat of the trouble.   Let us find the reason for this  assertion:
The  moon which is the ruler of the 12th house is in the house  of  friends,
the 11th, and square to Venus in the 2nd in the 6th house sign, Virgo,  rul-
ing labor and sickness.  This plainly shows us that this woman was most hos-
pitable,  loved  to entertain her friends, was happy when she  could  regale
them,  and  as indicated went to extremes in this direction.   Venus  square
moon indicates an abnormal desire for pastry and sugar; it indicates one who
having  eaten  a heavy meal,  richly prepared,  would indulge  in  chocolate
creams and various other ash producing dainties.   This is one of the  types
of women whom we often meet,  whose greatest pride is in cooking and who are
never  so  happy  as when they are entertaining at  a  sumptuously  prepared
table.   Cancer people are good cooks and usually take great pride in cater-
ing to the needs of the stomach.

   In this horoscope we find Saturn,  the planet of obstruction,  in its own
sign Capricorn and in the 6th house, health.  Saturn is in opposition to ju-
piter in the sign of the stomach and in the 12th house.   Planets and  their
afflictions often show their effect in opposite signs, and when Saturn is in
Capricorn we usually expect some derangement of the stomach, for his effects
there  are very similar to those of Saturn in Cancer.   With Jupiter  ruling
the arterial circulation, afflicted by Saturn,  we  may  expect trouble with


[PAGE 390]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

the  circulatory  system of the stomach.  And with the spasmodic  Uranus  in
conjunction with mercury, the nerves are also sensitive and nervous indiges-
tion is indicated.

   Now,  when  Saturn afflicts the stomach,  there is a lack of  pepsin  and
stomach fluids wherewith to digest the food.   Saturn in Cancer or Capricorn
gives  abnormal  appetite and makes one very fond of pastry,  especially  of
sugar,  as does Venus square moon mentioned before.   As  vegetarians,  such
people  find it very hard to keep their bodies in good order for  they  will
usually refuse raw vegetables, preferring the starches and sugars.  As a re-
sult  the body does not receive the proper amount of mineral  elements,  and
the blood soon fills with ash.  When an overabundance of refuse is stored up
in  the blood,  the body must seek a means of eliminating the waste  matter.
If it is unable to find an outlet through which to throw off the impurities,
and if the bowels also refuse to do their part as is often the case when  an
overabundance of food is consumed,  then an illness is the result.   We fre-
quently find cases of catarrh, skin disease, ulcers, etc.,  which are merely
an avenue the body uses to dispose of an excess of ash.

   In  the case of this woman we find the gums eliminating pus and  receding
toward the roots of the teeth.   This disease is commonly called pyorrhea or
Riggs'  disease and is increasing to an alarming degree in America.   It was
rarely heart of fifty years ago, but since there has developed  such a craze


[PAGE 391]                                                SPECIAL CONDITIONS

for sugar and candy humanity is paying the price.

   To overcome this disease a well balanced, simple,  vegetarian diet,  free
from sugars and starches is advisable, and the careful cleansing of the gums
with lemon water each day.

   THIS horoscope is that of a man with the watery sign of Cancer on the As-
cendant.   In diagnosing it is customary to look to the sixth  house,  which
has rule over disease,  and its ruler for the key to the trouble.   In  this
horoscope we have the sign of Capricorn on the cusp of the sixth house, with
its ruler,  Saturn, in the 10th house in conjunction with the Dragon's Tail,
which is Saturnian in its influence.  Saturn is also conjunction Neptune  in
Taurus.   These  are all in opposition to the inflammatory  Mars,  which  is
strong in its home sign Scorpio,  having rule over the rectum and generative
organs.   This  is  a most dangerous and  subtle  affliction,  increased  by
Neptune parallel the sun in Scorpio, and indicates an unrestrained passional

nature which in childhood found its outlet through the secret habit of  mas-
turbation.  This in time depletes the vitality, stunting the mentality,  and
also the physical growth, and later in life causes much physical trouble.

   Scorpio rules both the rectum and the vital organs, and when excesses oc-
cur they often cause inflammation in the rectum resulting in intestinal hem-
orrhoids, interfering with elimination and causing a general sluggishness of
the excretory duet.

   We find the spasmodic Uranus in Virgo,  the  sign  ruling the intestines;


[PAGE 393]                                                SPECIAL CONDITIONS

it  is also the natural sixth house sign and the sign which rules  sickness.
Uranus is square to Venus, which rules the venous blood.  Here we have indi-
cation  of  restricted  circulation in the small  intestine.   Jupiter,  the
planet of opulence, the planet which wants things in large quantities, is in
Cancer,  the sign ruling the stomach, and in the twelfth house, the house of
self-undoing,  sextile to the ruler of the Ascendant,  the moon,  indicating
that this young man has been a very hearty eater, carrying eating to excess.

   He  dissipated the life forces during the period of life when he  was  in
greatest need of them, and has also consumed more food than the organs could
digest and distribute.  Naturally, when the organs of elimination refused to
work, as might be expected, the blood stream became charged with ash,  caus-
ing  granulation of the joints through the excessive clogging  generated  in
the body from too much protein.   This also burned up the natural body oils,
causing a granulation of the eyelids,  rheumatism,  and a generally weakened
condition of the entire system.

   Our advice to this patient would be to eliminate meats and starches, tak-
ing  very little of the proteins,  and to eat mostly fruits and  vegetables;
also to live a chaste,  clean life.   Care should be taken to have his  sur-
roundings clean and to sleep in a room with plenty of fresh air, for when we
find Saturn afflicted by the Dragon's Tail and Neptune in Taurus,  it  indi-
cates a tendency to neglect the sanitation of the body and surroundings.

   TAURUS,  a fixed and stubborn sign, is on the Ascendant,  with the ruler,
Venus, in the watery sign of Cancer, square to the fiery and impulsive Mars,
and parallel to the ruler of Cancer, and watery moon.   Venus is also  ruler
of the house of sickness,  the 6th house.  Mars is in the 12th house in  its
own sign of Aries.

   We may look for the key to the trouble in the configuration and the posi-
tions of the above three planets, Venus, Mars, and the moon.

   The planets that are in a location corresponding to that part of the body
in which the disease is found are not alone the cause of the disease.   If a
burglar has entered our home and carried away our jewels,  the first step to
be taken to find the culprit is to ascertain the place of his entrance.   So
also must we find the gateway or the cause of the disease.

   Venus,  we know, is the planet ruling sweets, sugars, etc.  Taurus is the
sign  ruling the throat,  the palate;  therefore Taurus has great  influence
over the appetites.  Venus is in Cancer, the sign ruling the stomach and the
thoracic duct, and is afflicted by a square to Mars.  Mars when afflicted by
Venus and when in its own sign of Aries causes  dissipation  and  desire for

Taurians  are  usually very fond of food things to eat and drink;  they  are
hearty  eaters  and  are  apt  to  gourmandize.  Therefore  with  the  above

afflictions this native would eat and drink to excess.

   Uranus  in Gemini is in a very nervous position.   This excitable,  rest-
less,  and nervous planet, especially as it is squared by Saturn and Jupiter
from  another  mercurial  sign,  Virgo,  will  have a strong effect upon the


[PAGE 396]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

nervous system.

   Now, with Venus, which has rule over the venous blood, afflicted by Mars,
and with Jupiter, ruling the arterial blood, afflicted by the conjunction of
Saturn and the square of Uranus,  this man has a very sluggish  circulation,
especially of the stomach and small intestines.   With both Jupiter and Sat-
urn  posited in Virgo,  what could be expected but that when  an  affliction
touches any of these planets sickness would result?

   At  the age of thirty-nine th native's progressed sun reached the  square
to  Uranus which brought on nervous trouble.  At the same time the  sun  was
within one degree of a conjunction of Saturn radical.   The sun takes  three
years to pass a conjunction; one year applying, one year in conjunction, and
another year separating.   Therefore,  this man passed through a double  af-
fliction at that time, and a severe spell of peritonitis was the result.  He
was  unable to recover readily from this sickness,  since through his  igno-
rance of the causes he did not stop his heavy indulgence in food and  drink.
In 1918,  when the progressed moon came to the square of Saturn and  Jupiter
and the opposition of Uranus, another illness occurred,  which left him with
a severe case of catarrh of the intestines.

   If  a patient of this type should call upon a probationer for advice  and
help,  what should he advise?  He should first find the cause,  and it is so
evident there that excess of food and drink were  responsible that he should


[PAGE 397]                                                SPECIAL CONDITIONS

advise abstinence from food for a short time, especially that ruled by Mars,
such as highly seasoned articles and condiments.   Liquor and tobacco should
be entirely avoided.  A strict vegetarian diet should be advised with plenty
of fresh air and sunshine to assist in relaxing the nerves.  Where the Venus
and Jupiter circulations are sluggish, a friction bath would be advisable.

   As  has been often stated in our astrological books and lessons,  man  is
master of this fate.  He has his whole life before him, either to make or to
mar.  Here we have a horoscope for diagnosis that speaks for itself, that of
a man who has had everything in his favor,  with but two evil aspects in the
entire horoscope;  everything else is good.   We find the sun and Venus con-
junction in the sign of the heart,  Leo,  one of the strongest signs of  the
entire twelve.   Both these planets are sextile to the moon and trine to Ju-
piter,  Jupiter being near the Midheaven.  The mentality is decidedly strong
and keen,  especially along metaphysical lines.  Neptune is in its own  home
(Pisces),  sextile to Uranus and trine to Mercury.   The moon is  also  well
aspected  and in a mental sign,  Gemini.  This man ha a wonderful  start  in
life, and brought over with him from a previous life many fine qualities.

   As is often stated in astrological books by old and reliable writers, Ju-
piter in the Midheaven brings much good to the native.   And surely this man
had many opportunities to succeed.  Now why did he fail?

   First,  we find Saturn in Cancer.  As stated in THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS,
page 257,  this "indicates that the stomach is weak and the gums subject  to
pyorrhea.  There is inability to properly digest  the food."  The stomach is


[PAGE 399]                                                SPECIAL CONDITIONS

lacking in the fluids necessary to aid digestion.   The native is also  very
peculiar  in  his likes and dislikes as to food.   This is the  key  to  his
bodily afflictions.  We find Saturn making a square to Jupiter,  which rules
the  arterial  blood, and as stated on page 299 of THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS,

under  this  aspect the native is "indolent and inclined to drift  with  the
tide;  often a ward of society either in the poorhouse or prison.   This as-
pect also gives a tendency to arterio-sclerosis."


[PAGE 400]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

   We find the coarse, combative, discordant,  passionate,  and hot-tempered
Mars in Libra, a Venus sign.  When afflicted it brings out its own lower na-
ture and that of Venus,  creating undue attraction to the opposite sex.   As
Mars  is co-ruler of the 5th house and is making a square to  the  impulsive
and egotistical Mercury, the native's in harmony and hot temper have led him
to excesses.  Instead of expressing the beautiful, artistic, and musical na-
ture of the sun and Venus conjunction on the Ascendant in Leo trine to Jupi-
ter,  this man has directed an excess of love and vitality in the wrong  di-
rection.   He has indulged too freely in rich food, and has expended much of
his energy through the 5th house,  pleasures.  He has had much in harmony in
the  home,  caused by himself and his temper.   As a result  the  blood  has
become   vitiated,   and   he  now  is  in  a   very   advanced   stage   of
arterio-sclerosis.

   In  order  to  find  out the time of the affliction we  will  go  to  his
forty-fourth year when the progressed moon had reached the 6th house in  the
first  degrees of Capricorn.   It there made an opposition to Saturn in  the
12th house in Cancer, the stomach, and a square to Jupiter in the Midheaven.
At the same time we find Mars progressed has reached 24-51 of Scorpio,  mak-
ing an opposition to Uranus in Taurus.   Impulse and excesses in fast living
at that time broke down his system,  and since then the man has been an  in-
valid, perfectly helpless, wheeled in a chair and confined in hospitals, due
to Saturn and  Mercury  in  the 12th house, self-undoing.  But he has always


[PAGE 401]                                                SPECIAL CONDITIONS


found some kind hearted woman friend to look after his wants.  He has been a
very difficult patient; his temper has been dreadful.  Through his suffering
he has allowed himself to drift into this state of irascibility.  Instead of
responding to the beautiful Venus influence he has given way to Mars  square
Mercury.

   In order to improve he should have a nurse with Saturn well aspected, one
of  an Aquarian nature,  cool,  calm, and collected,  who could soothe  him,
quiet his temper,  and with great diplomacy lead him into right living.   At
present he demands certain food and unless the nurse gives it to him he  has
a  dreadful  spell of temper.   This man would have to be loved  into  doing
things.   To make a demand upon him or to tell him he dare not do a  certain
thing would only awaken the spirit of opposition in him.  Brisk massage with
a pair of rough bath gloves to open the pores of the skin and start the cir-
culation  would be beneficial.   Proper food and assistance to  control  his
temper would in time help him to overcome his condition.

   Male, born December 29, 2900, 12:45 A.M.

   FOUR  cardinal  signs are on the angles, with Mars trine to the  sun  and
Saturn.   These testimonies show the person to be endowed with good vitality
and with an active and ambitious nature.   But the counteracting aspects are
also strong.   The moon is square to the sun and Saturn,  Mars is square  to
the ruler, Venus, and the majority of the planets are under the earth.  This
takes  away from the general resistance of the person.   The  opposition  of
Neptune to Jupiter and Mercury in mental signs, Gemini and Sagittarius shows
that the native is of a very nervous temperament.

   Neptune  in  the 9th house usually gives a tendency to be  a  dreamer  of
dreams,  a visionary who grasps at the illusory things in life  rather  than
those that are near by the tangible.   Neptune's opposition to Mercury,  the
planet of reason,  shows that this would be particularly accentuated in  the
present case.   The moon in Aries square to the sun and Saturn would further
make the mind flighty and unstable.

   Mars in Virgo configurated with uranus, whether by good or evil  aspects,
makes  a person liable to intestinal disorders.   Mars is the planet of  in-
flammation and fevers.  He causes operations and other violence.  Configura-
tions  of Mars with Uranus have been observed to result not only in  typhoid
and gastric fevers, but also  very  often  Mars  ruptures the peritoneum and

causes  the person to have a prominent abdomen.   The young man whose  horo-

house.  Later she came to the square of Neptune, Jupiter, and Mercury.  Then
the native's spine began to weaken.   You will notice that the opposition of
Neptune to Jupiter and Mercury is from Gemini to Sagittarius,  covering  the
region of the spine.  The moon later progressed to the opposition of her own


[PAGE 404]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

place  at birth,  and as the radical moon in Aries has  particular  dominion
over  the cerebellum,  which is the organ of coordination of  movement,  you
will  readily  understand that this makes it difficult for  the  patient  to
walk.

   This is a curious case of interlocking afflictions and good aspects,  for
you  will  observe that whenever the two principal afflicters Mars  and  the
moon,  are struck by an adverse aspect there is always a good set of aspects
to minimize the evil effects.  Were this not so the severe afflictions would
certainly have done away with this young man long ago.   The square  between
the moon and Saturn is particularly inimical.

   The moon progresses around the horoscope in twenty-eight years as we mea-
sure  a  day for a year.   Saturn in the heavens by transit  actually  moves
around the circle of the zodiac in about thirty years.   Thus the progressed
moon and the transiting Saturn are always bound to follow each other  pretty
closely.  When they are square at the birth of a person, they keep that same
relationship for a considerable number of years.   Thus good aspects in  the
horoscope  are offset by the fact that the progressed moon is square to  the
transiting Saturn, and evil aspects are similarly accentuated by this unfor-
tunate square.   Therefore anybody who has this unfortunate configuration is

which we note in this horoscope and  which  are certainly very strong are to

some degree nullified by the square of Saturn and the moon at birth.

   Saturn  always indicates that part of our destiny which has been  brought
over from previous lives, and is almost unalterable.  Therefore in this case
there  is  unfortunately not much to do.   Baths and massage  applied  by  a
healer  who has Aquarius rising and whose Saturn is not in Libra  or  Pisces
would be most helpful.

   WE have here a most interesting case, that of a woman with the fixed sign
of Taurus on the Ascendant, and with the ruler in the watery sign of Pisces,
intercepted  in  the 11th house,  in conjunction with the watery  moon,  and
square  to  the fiery and destructive Mars.  Mars is the ruler of  the  12th
house,  the house of confinement,  and Venus is the ruler of the  6th  house
governing sickness.

   About  1904 the patient was operated on and had one kidney removed.   She
could not give the exact year, but from planetary aspects we feel certain it
was in 1904,  when the progressed sun ha just passed a conjunction with  the
radical  Neptune near the Ascendant,  and the progressed moon was  making  a
square both to the radical Neptune and the progressed sun.   At the  present
writing this poor woman, who is forty-four years of age, expects to become a
mother  in three months,  and is struggling to overcome the  dread  narcotic
habit, which she has had about six years, also the cigarette habit.

   A  most interesting principle is brought out in this horoscope.   Neptune
in  Taurus near the Ascendant is trine to Uranus in Virgo in the 5th  house.
These planets are in signs of mutual reception;  that is,  Neptune being the
higher octave of Mercury is in a Venus sign,  Taurus,  and Uranus the higher

octave of Venus is in the mercurial sign of Virgo.   The trine of these  two
mystical  planets would indicate the development of the two ductless  glands
represented  by them,  namely the pineal gland by Neptune and the  pituitary
body by Uranus.  When these two glands are for any  reason  awakened and the

sual  and  worldly channels,  their awakening then frequently leads  to  the
grossest indulgence of the lower nature--sometimes to drink  or narcotics as

   Venus and the moon in conjunction in Pisces, Venus being the ruler of the
6th house, governing sickness, and Mars the ruler of the 12th house, govern-
ing hospitals,  indicate that some one in a hospital was responsible for her
forming  the habit of taking narcotics from which she is suffering and  this
person we believe to be a doctor friend who attended her.   At the time when
she claimed she acquired the habit of using narcotics we find the progressed
Mercury  trine  to  Uranus  and the progressed  Venus  in  conjunction  with
Neptune.   This would have a tendency to awaken the above  mentioned  glands
and cause a soul hunger,  which in this case the woman mistook for a  desire
to  indulge in soul flights through the use of narcotics instead of  through
living the Christ life.

   But the struggle now comes to get relief when she is in a most  weakened,
despondent,  and generally rundown condition from a spell of influenza  com-
plicated by pregnancy,  nerves,  and insomnia;  also the elimination through
the one remaining kidney is now being interfered with by Saturn  conjunction
sun in Aries, which is producing an effect in the opposite sign of Libra.

   The one gleam of hope held out through the planets is the progressed  sun
within orb of a sextile to the radical Jupiter and the progressed Mars trine
to  the radical moon.   These aspects are most favorable for the aid of  the
Invisible Helpers, who can accomplish much  more  under  favorable planetary

cause her spirit is most desirous of overcoming,  although she is lacking in
faith  regarding our method of healing.   She was persuaded to call upon  us
for help by her own doctor,  who had been healed through our Invisible help-

   Female, born June 12, 1897, 9:00 P.M.

   WE  have at all times tried to impress upon the minds of students of  the
Rosicrucian  Philosophy the great necessity of always looking at the  bright
side of life,  and ever to hold out hope to unhappy and afflicted ones.   If
we  aspire to be helpers of humanity,  workers in God's great  vineyard,  we
must always throw the life line to the drowning man, that is,  give him that
hope,  that help,  which means life to him.   The astrologer who voices  the
doom of his patient and takes the last ray of hope away when one who is suf-
fering  comes to him perhaps as the last resort is little less than  a  mur-
derer.  This may be putting it very strongly, but the writer feels that this
point cannot be emphasized too much.

   To illustrate the danger that lies in the prediction of death:   a  woman
wrote  to Headquarters stating that she had but two more years to live,  for
the astrologers had predicted this.  Would we advise her, she asked, to take

the school which she had started,  or would it be best to give everything up
and  prepare  herself  or  the coming event, her passing out of the physical

body?  We can assure you that this woman received a letter from Headquarters
that  as  surrounded by strong vibrations which  scattered  effectually  the
thoughts  of death.   As a result of the letter she became a student of  the
Philosophy and is today an  active  and  healthy  woman, destined to reach a


[PAGE 412]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

ripe  old age.   The astrologer who predicted this woman's death might  have
been  guilty of murder,  but fortunately through her coming in contact  with
one  of  our  pupils  who advised her to write  to  Headquarters,  this  was
averted.

   In 19A we have a patient who has so many weak and afflicted planets  that
the  astrologer must use the greatest diplomacy in order to  encourage  her.
On  the first house is the gloomy,  pessimistic Capricorn,  with the  ruler,
Saturn,  in the Midheaven afflicted by the conjunction of the negative,  vi-
sionary,  worrisome moon and the irresponsible and fanatical Uranus;  and to
make it even more unfortunate these three planets are in conjunction in  the
fixed and martial sign of Scorpio, the natural eighth house sign,  the house
of death.   Mercury,  the ruler of the mind,  is in the gloomy and  stubborn
sign of Taurus in opposition to the afflicted planets in Scorpio.   Could we
find anything more unfortunate for mental trouble?  When Taurus is afflicted
he assists Capricorn in magnifying the gloom side of life and increases  his
brooding  over imaginary ills,  so you can imagine the temperament  of  this
poor woman.  She was sadly in need of help.

   Her request for help came to us in November, 1916.   She was at that time
in such a mental state that she had threatened suicide, could do nothing but
weep,  and was surrounded by imaginary troubles.   But she was very faithful
in  writing  her weekly letters and did all possible to cooperate  with  the
healers.  When she requested healing her progressed  Mars  was square to the


[PAGE 413]                                                          INSANITY

radical moon, Uranus, and Saturn in Scorpio, which caused this  mental  dis-
turbance. But fortunately the progressed moon at that time was in 25 degrees
of  Cancer  trine and sextile to the afflicted planets in the 10th  and  5th
houses respectively.   This was the life line that was ready to be thrown to
help her.

   Note  that the artistic harmonious,  and musical radical Venus is in  her
own sign of Taurus,  trine to the reverent and optimistic Jupiter.   The one
window  of  light open to her was this good aspect--music and art.   It  was
necessary  to bring harmony into this poor inharmonious mind,  and  we  pre-
vailed upon her and her friends to provide her with music in the home and to
interest her in art.  At the time of her request for help her progressed sun
was  in  9 degrees and 50 minutes of Cancer,  making a good  aspect  to  the
radical  Venus.   This as the means of saving her reason.   In May 1917  she
wrote  us she was feeling so much better that she did not need the  help  of
the healers any longer.

   Here  we can see what a wonderful work can be done through a true  knowl-
edge of astrology.   Had an unscrupulous astrologer met this woman and  pre-
dicted  suicide,  the danger of which as shown so plainly in the figure,  he
might  have been her murderer.   Therefore, dear friends,  we hope you  will
take this as a lesson to use astrology to help and to heal and not to wound.

   Female, Born January 7, 1868.

   Although  we are unable to predict the dates of crises in her illness  on
account of the lack of the birth hour, still the aspects between the planets
in this woman's chart,  show sufficiently well the nature of the illness and
the yearly crises.  We find the erratic and eccentric Uranus in the psychic
sign of Cancer,  in opposition to Mars,  the planet of impulse and reckless-
ness.   Uranus is also in opposition to the life-given sun and  to  Mercury,
the planet of reason, both placed in the belligerent and violent sign Capri-
corn.   All four of these planets are square by Neptune in Aries,  the  sign
which rules the head and the brain.

   We  find that the benevolent ray of Jupiter is quenched by its  placement
in  the  twelfth  house  sign of Pisces,  indicating  sorrow,  trouble,  and
self-undoing.   There is is conjoined with the saturnine Dragon's  Tail  and
squared by the moon,  the giver of visions and imagination,  making the mind
morbid.   He is also squared by Saturn,  the planet of gloom and melancholy.
As a result of all these adverse,  perverse,  and perverting influences  the
poor woman has always been weakminded, impulsive, reckless, gloomy, erratic,
and visionary.  In the year 1915 matters cam to a crisis when the sun was in
the  twelfth  house  sign  of  Pisces,  ruling  hospitals  and asylums.  The

progressed moon also was there in conjunction with the sun and th  saturnine
Dragon's Tail, and all of them square Saturn, with the result that the woman
as taken violently insane and had to be confined in an asylum, where she has

been ever since.  There has been little or no improvement so far as the men-
tal  condition  is  concerned,  and the condition of physical health is also
delicate.

   It is not a hopeless case, however, for the principal inimical influences
are from cardinal signs, whose  force  is  comparatively soon spent, and the


[PAGE 416]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

remainder  are from common or flexible signs which are subject to  modifica-
tion.  Not that Neptune, the planet of the spiritual mind, is sextile to Ve-
nus,  the planet of music, and to the moon, the planet of impressionability.
Venus  and the moon are trine;  this shows that the native loves  music  and
that  she may be helped by it.   With respect to health we find the moon  in
Gemini,  the sign that rules the lungs, which gives a tendency to  colds  in
the lungs.  Uranus is in Cancer, squared by Neptune and in opposition to the
sun,  Mars,  and Mercury, which shows nervous indigestion,  for Cancer rules
the stomach.   This can be minimized by proper food, and if this can be pro-
vided it will help considerably to clear the mind.

   In dealing with the question of insanity students should remember that it
is a rupture, complete or partial, in the chain of bodies linking the spirit
to the physical vehicle.  When the rupture occurs between the dense body and
the vital body, or between the latter and the desire body, we have the harm-
less  idiot.   When the break is between the desire body and the  mind,  the
reckless, impulsive, and violent desire nature takes charge of the lower ve-
hicle,  and we have the violently raving maniac who must be restrained by  a
straight-jacket and padded cell.   But when the rupture takes place  between
the mind and the spirit,  the cunning and craftiness of the mind exert them-
selves to take charge of the lower personality; an insane person of this or-
der  may  go  about  among  us  for  years  plotting  and scheming with such

consummate cunning that we never suspect him of being abnormal until he car-
ries  out  some diabolical plot and then laughs and glouts  over  the  ruin,
sorrow, and suffering which he has brought upon his victims.

   THIS horoscope was sent us by the relatives of the native,  with  permis-
sion  to use it as a lesson.   We find some very interesting points  in  it,
which may be of interest in the study of the science of diagnosis.

   Two special points must be taken into consideration in the horoscope of a
patient:   the sign on the Ascendant and Mercury.   The Ascendant shows  the
strength of the personality.  If fixed signs are on the four angles, namely,
the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth cusps, then the patient will be apt to
help  the  healer with his will to overcome disease.   If,  however,  common
signs are on the angles, then the patient is apt to drift with the tide, and
is  prone to lean upon the Invisible Helpers,  expecting them to do all  the
work,  failing  usually  to  do  anything  for  himself.   To  get  the best

cooperation  from the patient it is most necessary that the mind be  willing
to help.   Where there is a weak or a stubborn mind, the patient can do much
to thwart the efforts made in his behalf, as we find in this horoscope.

   Mercury  being in a fixed sign in the tenth house and square  to  Neptune
here gives a most dominating and stubborn mentality.   This is a person  who
will bear no interference or domination from others.

   He has naturally a very devout and religious nature,  but instead of fol-
lowing  the  soul's  ideals,  which  are expressed by Jupiter in Sagittarius


[PAGE 419]                                                          INSANITY

sextile to Mercury in Aquarius,  his stubborn and ambitious mind led him  to
respond to the vibrations of Venus square Jupiter,  Mercury square  Neptune,
and moon square Uranus.

   Venus is exalted in Pisces, the sign of self-undoing, and in the eleventh
house,  square to Jupiter,  which is strong in its own sign of  Sagittarius,
the sign of religion.   This indicates that a woman friend with her flattery
and attention,  signified by Venus, was responsible for leading him from his
religious ideals into negative metaphysical speculation.   In addition,  the
versatile  and restless moon makes a trine to Neptune in the occult  twelfth
house,  which gave him the desire for occult knowledge, but the moon,  being
square to Uranus, led him to his undoing.  A person with the planetary posi-
tions and aspects which we find in this horoscope is not satisfied to follow
instruction or heed the warnings of those who know about occult matters, but
he must needs rush in and investigate for himself.  the sun in the Saturnian
sign of Aquarius in opposition to Saturn in the sign of Leo gives a vein  of
skepticism, a nature which demands evidence and which must prove all things.
This spirit was his undoing.   The sun and Saturn being in mutual  reception
in the tenth and fourth houses respectively, strengthened this tendency.

   With  the  moon  trine  Neptune and  square  Uranus  this  man  developed
mediumship  very quickly and was able to contact the invisible realms.   But
he heedlessly sought his knowledge  along  dangerous  paths.  While the yogi


[PAGE 420]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

teachings  may be safe for the Fourth Race people,  the orientals,  and  for
those  of the Western races who are still on the lower rounds of  evolution,
yet  to one of the sensitive Western type these oriental teachings are  most
dangerous.  This poor man became attached to a group of Hindus, from whom he
received instructions in breathing exercises and psychic development.  He as
also active in spiritualism wherein mediumship was encouraged.

   After  a  few  years the progressed moon reached the  opposition  to  the
radical  Saturn and later a conjunction with the radical Mercury.   Neptune,
being  the higher octave of Mercury, works largely upon the nervous  system,
and  any undue stimulation will sometimes cause mental unbalance if  Neptune
squares the mental planet Mercury, often expressing itself through religious
mania.   This poor man repeatedly claims that he is the reincarnated  Jesus.
Especially will Neptune give this tendency when in the twelfth house,  where
it often causes incarceration in an institution for the insane.  The moon in
the ninth house in Capricorn,  square to Uranus,  here increased the evil by
attracting  undesirable  entities to this already weakened mind,  which  was
easily driven out of the body, giving the obsessing entities freedom to take
possession of it.

   To top off this most unfortunate condition the poor man,  who has been in
an insane asylum for some years,  is slowly dying of that dread disease  tu-
berculosis.  This is shown by Jupiter in Sagittarius (Jupiter ruling the ar-
terial blood) square to Venus (which has rule over the venous blood) in  Pi-
sces, two common signs.

houses,  their influence is much more potent, much stronger for  either good
or  evil  than elsewhere,  and especially if they are in fixed signs  or  in
their own homes.  Jupiter is in its own home and in the 4th house, an angle,
and  rules the arterial blood.   It is in square aspect to the  fiery  Mars,
which is in the sign of the lungs,  Gemini.   Mercury,  the ruler of Gemini,
ruling  the air passing through the lungs,  is in conjunction with the  sun,
and  these two planets are in the fiery sign of Leo ruling the  heart.   Now
that would be the physical effect of the two afflictions noted above?

   It  is necessary that a certain amount of air be taken into the lungs  in
order  to supply the oxygen which is needed to give life to the blood  which
feeds the heart.   With the ruler of Gemini, Mercury,  burned up by the heat
of the sun and the capillaries of the lungs filled with the fire of the  fe-
verish and afflicted Mars, we have a congested and  feverish  chest, and the

through the aorta.  The lungs become feverish and breathing laborious, caus-

stomach, Cancer, and i the 8th house, indicating poor  assimilation  of  the

hot and fiery sign of Leo in opposition to the spasmodic retrograde  Uranus,
which is strong in its own sign Aquarius, giving uneven action to the heart.

   This boy will suffer more or less all through life with what is  commonly
termed by the doctors,  asthma.   The first few years he suffered very  much
from spasms.  He will also be subject to coughs and colds, which will,  how-
ever, never develop into consumption as is often the case.  With Mars ruling
the lungs there is frequently a congested,  feverish condition in the capil-
laries  which  burns  up the oxygen.   But here Mars is in  sextile  to  the
life-giving  sum in Leo,  hence this boy will recuperate very  rapidly.   He
will be above the average in health in spite of the many afflictions, and he
will reach a ripe old age.

   WE will judge first the character of this person and for this purchase we
note that there are four cardinal signs on the angles.  This is a great help
toward  making  people mentally alert and well balanced,  but  unfortunately
here we find that mercury, the significator of the mind is combust,  and the
moon is in conjunction with Saturn.   This renders the mind slow and  melan-
choly,  subject to fears, which of course never materialize.   Uranus is el-
evated and square to Neptune,  which gives a tendency toward spirit control,
but we have the trine of the sun to Neptune to minimize the danger.  The na-
tive  has a strong love nature as shown  by the trine of Venus and  Jupiter,
but  the conjunction of moon and Saturn shows that the marriage  partner  is
likely always to wet-blanket and resent advances.   Mars opposition  Neptune
from the first to the seventh house makes it plain that there will be  quar-
rels and trouble,  all of which have an important bearing upon the  sickness
and its cause.

   The  sun  in leo afflicted by Jupiter in Taurus shows that  the  arterial
circulation is poor, a condition which is somewhat minimized by the trine of
Jupiter and Venus,  the two planets which govern the circulation.   But  the
rhythmic  motion of respiration is seriously interfered with because  Uranus
is  in  Cancer  and  elevated.  This  planet  is spasmodic in its action and

affects the diaphragm when placed in Cancer.   Here it is,  as said,  highly
elevated  and square to Mars and Neptune,  both in angles,  a  configuration
that  is  very  strong.  The  rhythmic  rise  and  fall  of the diaphragm is

absolutely essential to proper and regular respiration, an as this action is
interfered with to a degree by the afflictions here shown,  we have the con-
dition known as asthma.

   It  is  well  known  that sufferers from this disease sometimes go a very


[PAGE 426]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

long time without sleep because of their inability to lie down.  Morphine is
often  given  to relieve their condition and give them the rest  they  crave
with  all their being.   The danger of this drug cannot be overestimated  in
any  case,  but it is greater for a patient who has Jupiter  in  Taurus  af-
flicted by the sun like this one, for this always gives an inherent abnormal
appetite,  a tendency to go to extremes in whatever is taken by way  of  the
mouth.   Hence it is no wonder that this person has become addicted  to  the
use of morphine.

   There is hope,  however,  as shown by the horoscope.   The moon rules the
alimentary canal and is responsible for the passage of the food through  the
digestive  tract.   She is conjunct Saturn, and naturally this results in  a
sluggish condition of the bowels.   Uranus in Cancer operates upon the stom-
ach in such a way as to distend it periodically.  With a full colon,  a dis-
tended  stomach,  and the diaphragm moving erratically what wonder that  the
heart refuses to force the vital fluid into the lungs and take it from them?
Heroic methods should be taken to clear the system and keep it clear.  While
this will not relieve the spasmodic action of the diaphragm,  it will at any
rate  take the pressure away from the apex of the heart and thus  materially
help to reduce the condition.   Mars is sextile to the sun,  therefore,  the
heart  can be strengthened.   He is also sextile to Saturn showing the  pos-
sibility of securing at least better action and circulation in the digestive
tract.

   The  worst condition in this horoscope, the one most difficult  to  over-
come,  is Jupiter in Taurus square to the sun.   It has been our  experience
that  even though it is pointed out to people that they have abnormal  appe-
tites and they acknowledge it,  they usually refuse to mend their ways.   As
the above affliction is in fixed signs, it is exceedingly difficult to over-
come.  The best assistance, however, would be from the trine of Venus to Ju-
piter,  which excites the love nature and makes the native amenable to kind-
liness.  The tender care of a woman would perhaps do more than anything else
to help him overcome the habit he has formed.  A healer with Aquarius rising
and whose Saturn is not in Pisces would very likely have a beneficial effect
in this case.

                           NO. 20C--D--E:  ASTHMA

   The disease designated by the name of asthma is one of the most difficult
to diagnose, for many are suffering from symptoms which are diagnosed by the
doctors as those of asthma because of the shortness of breath, wheezing, and
coughing when frequently the person does not in reality have asthma.   There
are various kinds of this disease.  For instance there is hay asthma,  which
comes in the fall of the year when the hay and grain are ripe.  Sometimes it
comes from the noxious pollen of poisonous flowers,  which causes a contrac-
tion  of  the passages to the lungs;  these when inactive fill  with  mucus,
causing labored breathing.  Then we have the heart or stomach asthma,  which
is often the result of irregularity of the blood flow through the valves  of
the heart,  resulting in labored breathing and contraction of the chest  and
lungs.  Therefore the astrologer may find the diagnosis difficult.

   We will in this lesson endeavor to give a few helps showing according  to
the  afflictions the differences in diseases which may have similar  outward
symptoms but the causes of which may be different.

   Case 20C is that of a man born March 6, 1831,  4 P.M.   The horoscope for
this case is 10A, page 263.  We find the disturbing Saturn in Leo,  the sign
ruling the heart,  square to Mars in Taurus, which has rule over the throat,
and opposition  to  Mercury, which is in the nervous sign of Aquarius.  Mars


[PAGE 429]                                                            ASTHMA

is  also square to Mercury and parallel to Neptune.   This configuration  of
planets in fixed signs,  would indicate spasmodic heart action,  for Mercury
opposition  Saturn  would  cause contraction of the  valves  of  the  heart,
thereby interfering with the excessive blood flow caused by Mars square Sat-
urn.   We also find the sun in Pisces, a common sign,  square to the moon in
Sagittarius.   Common signs when afflicted interfere with the organs of res-
piration,  given a tendency to trouble with the lungs.   This  man  suffered
greatly  with  what  some doctors diagnosed as asthma and  others  as  heart
trouble, and he also frequently suffered from severe colds.  Astrology shows
that  he  had  valvular heart trouble and that is was not  a  true  case  of
asthma.   He died from an abscess of the liver.   For details regarding this
condition see No. 10A.

   In the case of horoscope 20D, that of a man born August 25, 1867, we find
Saturn  in Scorpio,  a fixed sign,  square to Venus and Mercury in Leo,  the
sign ruling the heart.   We again find some trouble with poor heart  action;
but the most disturbing affliction is found in th stomach,  for the moon and
Uranus  are in conjunction in the sign of Cancer,  which has rule over  this
organ,  and  both  are square to the inflammatory Mars,  Uranus  also  being
square  to Neptune,  all in cardinal signs.   In this horoscope we find  the
seat of the trouble in the stomach,  showing impulsive and unnatural  habits
regarding food, with a tendency to bolt the food and also excessive drinking


[PAGE 430]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

with  meals,  which  would cause the stomach to  become  distended,  thereby
pressing upon the heart and interfering with respiration.

   In horoscope 20E,  that  of  a  woman  born June 23, 1898, we find a very

different  cause,  and we may diagnose this as a real case  of  hay  asthma.
Neptune  is conjunction Mercury in the sign of Gemini,  which has rule  over
the lungs.  From the indications of personal appearance we should think that
this young woman had Virgo rising with  Gemini  in Midheaven, giving Mercury

as the life ruler.   Neptune,  being the higher octave of Mercury,  has rule
over  the  nervous  system.   Neptune's influence  is  similar  to  that  of
Saturn--constricting,   astringent.    When  in  Gemini,  we  may  expect  a

disturbance in the bronchioles, especially during the summer months,  as was
the case with this young woman,  whose trouble was caused by the  inhalation
of the pollen of certain grasses and flowers.

   You will, however, find that in  most  cases  of asthma there is impaired


[PAGE 432]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

circulation.   The blood stream is sluggish,  showing an affliction to Venus
or Jupiter.  When the blood is impure, elimination will also be sluggish.

   Great care should be used in the selection of food.   The patient  should
eat  very lightly and only such foods as are easily digested but which  give
the proper nourishment.   Especially is this true of the evening meals,  for
attacks of asthma invariably follow a heavy meal at night.   Raw onion sand-
wiches  eaten the last thing at night and cut the phlegm and insure a  sound
sleep.

   Sagittarius, a common sign, is on the Ascendant, and the life ruler,  Ju-
piter  is in the 9th house in the sign of Virgo;  Jupiter is also square  to
the Ascendant.  People with common signs on the four angles rarely make suf-
ficient effort to surmount the obstacles of life,  and when we also find the
afflicting planets in these common signs,  and the sun in the watery sign of
Cancer  an in the 8th house,  we have as in the case of this woman  one  who
would rather be an invalid than make the effort to keep the body in  health,
and we can see how weak the effort will be to overcome.

   First,  people  with  the sun and moon in Cancer are very  fond  of  good
things to eat,  and when the moon is also trine to Venus this enhances their
love for food and there is a tendency to overeat.   Let us see what will  be
the result.

conjunction  of Mars,  hence the circulation is very much obstructed,  espe-
cially as Jupiter is in the sign of Virgo, which has rule over the small in-
testine.   When the patient eats very heartily (especially as Cancer  people
are  very fond  of  starches),  with  the  obstructed  circulation  and  the

disturbed assimilation of food in the small intestine what may we expect but
that the bowels are filled with putrid matter.  Fermentation set in, causing
derangement of the entire circulatory system.   Saturn,  the obstructor,  in
conjunctionn  with Uranus in the sign of Scorpio,  which has rule  over  the
rectum,  and in the 12th house, the house of self-undoing, also the house of
hidden things,  is an indication that the young woman had formed secret hab-
its which caused much irritation to the organs of elimination and which  had
their result in causing cancer of the rectum.

   She was ailing for a long time with dreadful pains across the lower  bow-
els and at the lower end of the spinal column.   The question may be  asked,
Is  there not a cure for this dread disease of cancer?   Yes,  when  in  its
first stages, it may be cured by eliminating all food for a few days, drink-
ing  only pure,  distilled water flavored with lemon juice,  and giving  the
bowels  a  thorough  cleansing  with  high  enemas.   Then  start  with  the
mono-diet,  continuing this for three weeks if the patient is able to  stand
it,  but not to exceed three weeks.  The patient should eat nothing but car-
rots.   This vegetable may be prepared in various ways to make it palatable,
grinding it and drinking the juice,  baking or steaming it or making it into
salads  flavored with a little olive oil and lemon.   The carrot has a  pro-
nounced  healing effect,  especially when used as a poultice,  and it has  a
wonderful healing power for ulcer and cancerous growths.

   THE doctors had told this man that he had cancer, and nothing could shake
his belief that he would some day pass out with the dread disease.   He kept
up  his letters to the Healing Department regularly for several months,  but
they were always filled with doubt of our methods and discouragement regard-
ing the future.  He also rebelled at the restrictions in diet, claiming that
he was too weak and sick to live without his daily beefsteak and fried pota-
toes.

   Later through the instrumentality of his son,  who was working in our of-
fice  as stenographer,  this man with his wife rented a cottage on  a  tract
which adjoined the Headquarters grounds.   In order to make it possible  for
his father to partake of the health diet served in our dining hall,  the son
applied for a job as gardener for his father.

   The first few weeks this poor man as a great trial to the cook.   When he
failed to get what he demanded, he left the table hungry.  This lasted for a
few days until hunger forced him to eat what was served.   His demands  were
for two eggs fried in butter, a large bowl of soft, boiled mush with several
teaspoons  of  sugar  and  plenty of cream, fried potatoes, white bread, and

supported  his father for a number of years was desperately anxious to  help
us to help the latter.  After a few weeks the patient adjusted himself,  and
immediately his health began to improve.   The eruptions on his face and his
breast began slowly to disappear, and his general health and strength  began

to return.

   During  the day it was observed that he was constantly eating candy;  his
pockets were filled with this sweet.  Before coming to Headquarters he would
eat one to two pounds of candy every day,  and thought it necessary to do so
to keep up his strength.

   We note the conjunction of the moon and Venus just above the Ascendant in
the negative sign of Sagittarius.   The moon and Venus conjoined,  no matter
where they may be in the horoscope, give a desire for sweets, pastry, etc.

   In  this case we find Saturn posited in the sign of the stomach,  Cancer,
and  retrograde  to a square aspect with Mars,  which is placed in  a  Venus
sign.  this man had for years filled his body with an excess of starch, pro-
tein,  and sugar.  With his afflicted progressed Saturn in Cancer he was not
able  to  extract the vitamines from his food,  and he was in the  habit  of
overeating and of bolting it.  Naturally the body stores up excess amount of
food  taken.   His  stomach refused to digest such quantities  of  food,  or
rather was too weak and lacking in the juices necessary in digestion.  There
was also a large amount of waste matter which the organs of elimination were
unable  to throw off.   Mars has rule over the rectum,  being the  ruler  of
Scorpio  which governs this organ.   With Mars afflicted by the  obstructive
progressed  Saturn we might expect that the man would suffer from  constipa-
tion.

   With  all  this  ash  stored up in the body can we wonder that the system


[PAGE 439]                                                            CANCER

has to find some means of throwing out this poison?  The result was that the
skin of the nose, throat, face and breast (Mars ruling Aries the face, Scor-
pio the bridge of the nose,  and Saturn in Cancer the breast) was used as  a
dumping ground for the body waste.  After eight months of Mt.  Ecclesia diet
this man moved back to the city with not a trace of cancer on his body;  all
sores had entirely healed.   Mars sextile to the life-giving sun brought vi-
tality.  Wherever a good aspect between these two planets is found, there is
great hope of overcoming disease.

   Saturn in Cancer in the eighth house, the house of death, will eventually
be  the case of the native's demise,  together with the moon and Venus in  a
common sign and in the house of self-undoing.  In time his desire for sweets
and rich food will probably lead to excesses which will be the cause of  his
death.

                               CHAPTER XXXIII

                             ROSICRUCIAN HEALING

                     HOW THE ROSICRUCIANS HEAL THE SICK

   THE  Rosicrucian work of healing is carried on by the Elder  Brothers  of
the Rosicrucian Order through a band of Invisible Helpers whom they are  in-
structing.

   The work is conducted according to the commands of Christ Jesus,  namely,
"Preach the gospel and heal the sick."

                             THE ELDER BROTHERS

   These are high spiritual beings through whom the Christ Spirit is working
for the benefit of humanity.

                            THE INVISIBLE HELPERS

   The  Invisible  Helpers are those who live a worthy life  of  helpfulness
during  the daytime while in their physical bodies,  and whose  evolutionary
development  is such as to EARN the privilege of being helpful  through  the
instrumentality of the  Elder  Brothers  at night while functioning in their


[PAGE 441]                                               ROSICRUCIAN HEALING

etheric  bodies,  as indicated in the words of the Rosicrucian Evening  Ser-
vice:   "Tonight while our physical bodies are peacefully resting in  sleep,
may  we as Invisible Helpers be found faithfully working in the vineyard  of
Christ."   These Invisible Helpers are gathered together in bands  according
to their temperaments and their abilities.   They are under the  instruction
of other Helpers WHO ARE PHYSICIANS, and all of them work under the guidance
of  the Elder Brothers,  who naturally are the moving spirits of  the  whole
work.

   Not  infrequently  patients are aware of the presence  of  the  Invisible
Helpers.

                      RIGHT LIVING NECESSARY FOR A CURE

   The Invisible Helpers never refuse to answer an appeal for help,  but  in
order to respond to the Divine Healing Force patients must adopt the  gospel
of right living;  they should observe a pure meatless diet;  they must  fill
their  living  and  sleeping  rooms with pure air,  their  minds  with  pure
thoughts and their daily lives with pure actions.   The Divine Healing Force
is  pure;  if you ask for it in order to be relieved of your  ailments,  you
must  be willing to conform to the natural laws of purity.   Pure air,  pure
food,  pure thinking and pure living!  If you ignore these great health giv-
ing factors you may have called in vain upon the Divine Healing Force.


[PAGE 442]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

                                HEALING FORCE

   The healing force comes from God, our Heavenly Father,  the Great  Physi-
cian of the universe;  it is latent everywhere;  by prayer and concentration
it is liberated and directed to the sufferer; it manifested through the Mas-
ter,  Christ Jesus;  it goes forth from the weekly healing meetings held  at
the Rosicrucian Fellowship Headquarters.   Through the workings of this  su-
preme  force the Invisible Helpers raise the vibrations of the patient to  a
higher rate,  thus enabling him, first, to eliminate the disease poison from
the system, and second, to rebuild every blood corpuscle, fibre, tissue, and
organ until the whole body is made new.   This is done,  not in a miraculous
manner  but in accordance with nature's laws.   If the patient continues  to
break these laws and by a wrong mode of living to accumulate poisonous  sub-
stances in the system, he frustrates the healing work.

                              CAUSE OF DISEASE

   The  wonderful  organism called the human body is governed  by  immutable
natural  laws.   All disease results from willful or ignorant  violation  of
nature's laws.   People are ill because in this earth life or in a  previous
one they have disregarded the fundamental principles on which the health  of
the body depends.   If they wish to regain and to retain their health,  they
must learn to understand these principles and to regulate their daily habits
in conformity with them.


[PAGE 443]                                               ROSICRUCIAN HEALING

   This is what the Master Healer,  Christ Jesus,  meant when he said to the
man who was a cripple:   "Thou art made whole:   sin no more,  lest a  worse
thing come unto thee."  (John 5-14.)  Even the Christ could not give lasting
health  unless the recipient of the healing force refrained  from  indulging
wrong  habits which cause disease,  and lived in obedience to the  God-given
laws that rule man's body as well as his relations to his fellow creatures.


                             THE RIGHT TO HEALTH

   Some  people "demand"  perfect health and claim they have a right to  it.
They  forget that either in this or a former life some have forfeited  their
God-given right through disobedience to nature's laws, which are God's laws.
Through  suffering they have to learn obedience.   When they  have  mastered
their lesson and are willing to "sin no more," their right to health will be
restored to them.

                      VIOLATIONS OF THE LAWS OF HEALTH

   The Divine Healing Force is constructive;  wrong methods of living  which
disregard the laws of nature are destructive.

   The omissions and transgressions responsible for wrong living and  conse-
quently  for disease are many;  the following are the principal  ones:   Un-
natural food;  too much food;  ill-proportioned food;  lack of fresh air and
sunshine;  lack of cleanliness;  lack of exercise;  lack of rest and  sleep;
lack of self-control; sleeping in unventilated  rooms; harboring thoughts of


[PAGE 444]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

anger,  hatred,  and resentment; yielding to a hasty temper;  gratifying low
desires;  harming fellow creatures whether human or animal;  abusing the sa-
cred generative function.

   Since  all the organs and functions of the body are  interdependent,  the
abuse  and consequent affliction of one part hurts all the others,  furthers
the accumulation of disease poison throughout the system, and lowers the vi-
tality of the whole.  The local symptoms are only evidence of the whole body
being at fault.   Therefore,  all true healing,  in order to achieve lasting
results,  is directed not to the suppression of symptoms but to the  removal
of the cause that made the symptoms appear.


                              SPIRITUAL HEALING

   Spiritual healing operates on the higher planes of being but is  effected
in  strict  adherence to natural laws which prevail below as  above;  conse-
quently all natural therapeutics applied on the physical plan are in harmony
with the work of the Invisible Helpers on the higher planes.

                       RIGHT FOOD IS NATURAL MEDICINE

   As  the body is built up of the physical substances introduced  into  the
blood  by the daily food,  right food is the NATURAL medicine which the  pa-
tient  must take in order to cooperate with the Invisible Helpers  in  their
task of reconstructing his system.


[PAGE 445]                                               ROSICRUCIAN HEALING

                    EFFLUVIA TRANSMITTED IN WEEKLY REPORT

   Before the Invisible Helpers can work with the patient they must have ef-
fluvia from his vital body, which is the etheric counterpart of the physical
body  and the operating sphere of the vital forces.   The effluvia  are  ob-
tained  by having the patient write every week a letter consisting of a  few
words or a few lines with PEN AND INK.   This is important as a pen  charged
with fluid is a greater conductor of magnetism than a dry pencil.  The ether
which thus impregnates the paper upon which the patient writes week by  week
gives  an indication of his condition at that particular time and  furnishes
an entrance key to his system.  IT IS SOMETHING WHICH HE HAS GIVEN VOLUNTAR-
ILY AND FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF FURNISHING ACCESS FOR THE INVISIBLE HELP-
ERS.   Unless the patient does his part to do anything for him; so it may be
seen  that it is of the utmost importance to keep up the weekly  letters  to
Headquarters.

                           TIME REQUIRED FOR CURE

   Instantaneous  cures are frequent where the Invisible Helpers are  called
upon to assist in cases of acute disease.   In the case of a chronic ailment
which is of long standing and has taken years to develop,  a certain  amount
of relief may be experienced immediately; complete recovery, however,  which
is equivalent to a renewal of the whole system, can usually be achieved only


[PAGE 446]                                ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS A GUIDE TO HEALING

in gradual stages.   As said before, the healing work of the Invisible Help-
ers  is not suppression of symptoms but reconstruction of the whole  system,
and  in order to be accomplished it requires time as well as  the  patient's
faithful and constant cooperation along the lines indicated above.

                      HEALING MEETINGS AT HEADQUARTERS

   Healing meetings are held at Rosicrucian Headquarters on the nights  when
the moon enters cardinal signs in the zodiac.   The hour of service is about
6:30  P.M.   The virtue of the cardinal signs is dynamic energy  which  they
infuse  into every enterprise started under their influence,  and  therefore
the  healing  thoughts of the helpers all over the world  are  endowed  with
added  power when launched upon their errands of mercy under  this  cardinal
influence.

   If you would like to join in this work,  sit down quiet when the clock IN
YOUR  PLACE OF RESIDENCE points to the given hour,  6:30 P.M.,  meditate  on
HEALTH,  and pray to the Great Physician, our Father in Heaven, for the res-
toration to health of all who suffer, particularly those who have applied to
Headquarters.

   At the same time visualize the Ecclesia,  the healing Temple at Headquar-
ters,  where the thoughts of all aspirants are finally gathered by the Elder
Brothers and used for the stated purpose.
