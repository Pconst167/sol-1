   Rush Rules
   Does anyone
   talk to Rush on Compuserve?


I talk to Rush spiritually and mentally. I talk to rush, through the TV
screen. I talk to Rush,when I am in a car, I do not go far, just to get
a jar.
 I talk to Rush, and I talk to Van Halen...I talk to The animals...
I do not wear a green Hat....

Those of you, who revere other faiths, who might be examineing this
document, (especially Jewish or Christians) might be calling it 
blashpemy. Remember the words of Job:

  Will you speak unjustly on Gods Behalf?
    Will you speak deceitfully for him?
    What will happen we he examines you?
    Will you fool him, as one fools men?
                     --Job 13:7-9.

    Essentially here The freinds have cautioned Job "your saying Terrible
    things about god, and hes going to be very angry at you."
     Job  replys "IF god is a god worth worshipping, I have to beleive
     that he respects my honesty more than your flattery. I may be
     theologically wrong in what I say about your god, but I am saying
     what I think and feel to be true, not what I think god wants to
     hear, and I have to beleive that God respects that."

     So just bear that in Mind When Viewing other Peoples viewpoints
     about Gods or Goddess.
