                   as before....Wich was more.
                    except for when more was
                  explained, but less was known,
                   but not as much when more was
                  beleived to be known, because
                         that was false.

    This Text File describes a Wayward sect of The Discordian Soceity.
The Froot Loops Cult as it is come to be called by some, is not as
religously devout as others of its kind, and Prefers to work in Mundane
guises. Essentially We are to Fido What Erisians are to Christianity.
 We have developed our Entire Culture around the Tellecomunications medium
of our Faith. We speak of BBS's as one might of their Temples. We speak
of Echos as one might of their Streets or Plazas or Stables. WE speak of
Cheese doodles and Chilled Toilet Seats as if it were Cheese doodles and 
Chilled Toilet Seats so as you can see, we are "tetched by the fever".
  
   ________     Introduction   _____________

 Much as Inspired by the Devout faith of Erisians,and the Principia 
Discordia, This book destined to be a (Literatus Immortalus) as great
as perhaps something written by wise old guys, who are long since dead.
 Perhaps even greater than the Principia Discordia, or the Farmers Almanac.
         One thing that Distresses me, is that the author of the PD,
 was so Vague about who created, as if anyone cared that an alien Inteligence
of Some magnitude had created this text file, in order to subvert human Kind
into its servitude...I mean this is immaterial.This is the Second book, 
if you do not have the Lost first book,then you will suffer until you
do.IF you do not have the books written after these, then either we have
not written them yet, or they do not yet exist, in this reality/form.

                     anything, especially that.

    to appreciate the full flavour; others again are
    subtly ironical or cynical.  At first sight the book is a
    jumble of nonsense intended to insult the reader.  It
    requires infinite study, sympathy, intuition and
    initiation.  Given these I do not hesitate to claim that
    in none other of my writings have I given so pro-
    found and comprehensive an exposition of my
    philosophy on every plane...."
