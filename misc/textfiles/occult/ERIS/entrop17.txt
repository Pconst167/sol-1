    Gods Will to Unmask Cosmic Moronism
    ______________________________________

 Morons are Tricky, You can spot him right away, but the Moron reasons almost
the way you do;The Gap is almost infintismal. A moron is a master of a
paralogism. For an editor, its bad news. It can take him an eternity to
identify a moron, plenty of morons books are published, because they are 
convincing at first glance. An editor is not required to weed out the morons,
if the Academy of Science doesn't, why should he?
 Philosophers, don't either. Saint Anselm's ontological Argument is 
moronic, for example." God must exist because I can conceive of him as a 
being perfect in all ways, including existance". The saint confuses existance
in thought, with existance in reality.
 Gaunilon's refutation is moronic, too. " I can think of an Island in the
sea even if the Island doesn't exist". He confuses thinking of the Possible
with the thinking of the neccesary. --Also known as The "Forbess's Car 
argument"
 A duel between Morons. And God loves every minute of it. He chooses to be
unthinkable only to prove that Anselm and Gaunilon were morons. What a 
sublime purpouse for creation, or rather the act by wich god willed himself
to be: To unmask Cosmic moronism.

 The Law of Syllogisms states that: universal conclusions cannot be drawn
from Two Paticulars.

        The Legend of Saint Paul, Epistle to Titus
        _____________________________

Epimedes the Cretin says all Cretans are Liars. It must be true, because
he is a Cretan himself, and knows his countrymen well.
 Fnord. On the other hand, Those who call Epimedes a liar have to think 
all Cretans aren't, but Cretans don't trust other Cretans, Therefore no
Cretan Calls Epimedes a liar.

  Is this an Example of Moronic Thinking>? Even Morons can win a nobel
Peace Prize. Moronism Is Wisdom!
  The Whole history of Logic consists of our attempts to define an acceptable
notion of Moronism. A Task too immense. Every Great thinker, is someone 
else's Moron.

    What is moronism to one, is inchoherant to another!

Tagname:      STARGOAT                    Area Key: STARGOAT
Title:        Mutant Cosmic Star Goat
Description:  The Restored Church of the Star Goat is pleased to provide a
              forum for the distribution of the Star Goat cults' dogma. As
              most intelligent life forms in the galaxy know, Star Goat is
              a mental construct of Douglass Adams' wholly remarkable
              four- part trilogy. (For the rest of you, the secret is,
              "bang your rocks together, guys!") What's not generally
              known, (since it's a secret cult) is that there is a secret
              cult which has followed Star Goat since the 'B' ark landed.
              The Moderator is an ordained and _legal_minister_ and
              publishes the wholly remarkable magazine "Green Pastures"
              generally on a monthly basis. (BATF officers are not
              encouraged to participate.)

      The Great StarGoat Faith, is considered to be Waywardly Erisian,
yet those of that Faith, would deny it. That is their way of admitting
that It is the Truth.
