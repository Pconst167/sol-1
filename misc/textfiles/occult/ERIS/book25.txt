Principia Entropius Book Two >>The Principia EntroHocusPocus
Part Twenty-Five of 15
----------------------------------

         The  Liber Legis
              Two
          "Two legis to quit"

 every number is infinite, and therefore there is no real difference.

          ---------------------------------


 Alleister Crowley was visited by a higher Intelligence Aiwaz, who in
 1904 dictated the Liber Al vel legis, however I was visited by TWO
 such intelligences: Hoor-Paar-Kraat and Ra-Hoor-Khuit, mystical twins.
 Either that, or I had drank too much tequila. Anyway, they told me
 this:
       Invoke the Forces of the Tablet of Union by means of supreme
 Ritual of Pentagram, with the active and Passive Spirit, with Eheieh
 and Agla. Return to the Altar, and recite the following Enochian
 Spirit Invocation: Ol Sonuf Vaorsag Rinki Dinki Doc, Goho Iad balt,
 Rickery Dickery Doc,Lonsh Calz Effeem Beefeem Stuhp ya mamma, Vonpho
 Sobra Z-ol Ror I ta Nazps Lozenge, od Graa Ta Malprg...Ds Hol-q
 Qaa Bar-B  Qaa Notha Zimz, Xima, Od Commah Ta Nopblah Zien...


 My Mystical source is more authentic than Crowleys, you see---I do not
 know how Crowly could have activated the Rituals of the Beast, without
 bearing in mind the liturgy of the Sword. Only by unleashing the Sword
 can the nature of Mahapralaya be understood. The Third Eye of Kundalini.
   in Arithomology: All based on the number of the beast, he failed to
   consider 93, 118, 444, 868 and 1001

   pineal gland, to discover the not so obvious anti-meaning.-----




        HEY!  IS THAT A LAMBCHOP ON YOUR SHOULDER, OR ARE YOU JUST

                        A *FOLLOWER OF SATAN*?????

 JK>     Let me know what you guys think of my first "book"



        PINK AS A NUCLEAR SUNSET!
        NO BULLDADA, NO SLACK!
        I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW LITTLE NOVELTY OR SYNTHESIS, THOUGHT OR
        TRUE CREATIVE POWERS OF "BOB" WENT INTO THAT LITTLE BOOK!

                (In this respect, it is much like popular culture.
                 You could sell that for heaps of cash, and gain back
                 the slack you lack.  More power to ya, I say.)

        PINK AS A FLAMINGO!                             (Flamingo!)
        PINK AS A BABY'S BUTT!
        THE LACK OF SLACK BLASTED ME THROUGH THE ROOF OF A TACO BELL!
        AND THERE AIN'T NO TACO-BELL IN OTTAWA!
        MAY NHGH AND HIS YACATISMA DEVOUR YOU WHOLE!
        MAY THE TRUE W.O.M.B.A.T. SMITE YOUR MIND FROM THE DEPTHS OF
         ITS HADEAN PIT, THE TRUE ABYSS, WYOMING!
        WHY, THAT'S NOT FOAM RUBBER!  IT'S THICK PINK PAINT!
        SO THICK, THE SLACK WITHIN WAS DROWNED IN PAINT!
        IT WAS SO PINK, I THOUGHT IT WAS A PINK CHAIR!
        ERIS SMILED ON YOU, BECAUSE YOUR MIND IS A SHAMBLES!
        "BOB" SMILED ON YOU BECAUSE *HE JUST CAN'T STOP*!
        THE GRATE MOO SMILED ON YOU BECAUSE SHE SMILES AT EVERYTHING!
        THAT BOOK WAS AS BULLDADALESS AS WOOD!

 That being said, I must reiterate that, stupid as it was, you could
 probably sell it to the American public for a whole passel o' money.
 This being mainly because the American public are morons.

 I mean, you know how dumb the average guy is?  By definition, half of
 'em are even dumber that dat.

 That's what it takes to make money off that book.

   ============================================================
  There has to be some Conspiracy Involving Yan, of Cooking with Yan,
  I mean, just consider the Relevance of Bok Choy, and the fact, that
  he always looked Stoned.

Subject: AIEE! AIEE! THE SQUID IS NO LONGER UNDER MIND CONTROL!

 >> would the phrase "I Stick to my beliefs" be written as:
 >> "B LATTTick to my beliefs"????
SNEBBIT!
        As pursuant to Docrtinal Reversal in the Aeon of the GNU MOO, the
potatoma of the BLATTs has been recanted.  In fact, it's been canted so far
back, so many times, that I dare say it's undergone a complete revolution,
much like our "Church", destroyed itself utterly, and ended up looking exactly
as it once did, only in disguise.
        That is to say, it's had plastic surgery, and now has a completely
different identity, and has subsequently made a lifelike mask of what it once
looked like, created fake ID, and is passing itself off as itself.
        Thus, we don't dare ask questions like that, or the squid might 
regain consciousne...
        I daren't speak it.  Just saying it may lend power to Chthulhu.
