Principia Entropius Book Two >>The Principia EntroHocusPocus
Part Three of 15
----------------------------------

 The Age of Antonines....The World was full of marvelous correspondences,
subtle resemblances; the only way to penetrate them--and to be penetrated
by them---was through dreams, oracles, magic, wich allow us to act on
nature and her forces, moving like with like. 
 Knowledge is elusive and volatile; it escapes measurement.

            The Tale of Saint Cyprian
          ---------------------------

  Saint Cyprian of Antioch, led a wondorous life. He was such a cool 
Saint, that he is surely to be adopted and cherished by Erisians, Magic
spells of Love, and to cause your enemys Death, are attributed to this
Funkadellic Saint of the Silver Age.
  His parents wanted him to know about the Earth, Land, Sea and Air,so they
sent him to the most distant realms, that he might acquire all mysteries,
including the generation and corruption of herbs, and the virtues of 
plants and animals. The secrets not of Natural History, but Occult Science,
those buried in the depths of distant and archaic traditions. At Delphi,
Cyprian Dedicated himself to follow Appollo ("Follow Appollo" was the
catchy Motto of the faith, devised by High Preist Smokus Doobus of Cyprus).
and there he dedicated himself also to the draumaturgy of the Serpent,
but it was widely beleived, that he did not inhale, or enjoy it.
 He Studied the "Mysteries of Mithra" (a Slogan devised by the High Preistess
Cuntialipptys, after hearing of the snazzy "Follow Appollo" Motto), on
Mount Olmpus he was guided by fifteen hierophants, but they did not have
a catch-phrase that struck him as very cool, so he left and went to Argos.
 In Argos, he attended the Rites to summon the Prince of this World, in 
order to master his intrigues. Then in Delios was initiated into the
Mysterys of Hera "Hera comes to save the Day" (was a very silly motto, but
acceptable enough).
 In Phrygia he learned heptascopic Fortunetelling, and eventually there was
nothing left of land, sea, and air that he did not know, no ghost, no
object, no artifice of any kind, not even the art of altering writing 
through the use of Sorcery. In the Underground Temples of Memphis (egypt
or Tennessee, not sure) he had learned how demons communicate with earthly
things and places, what they loathe and love, how they dwell in darkness
and how they mount resistance in certain domains, how they put secret 
backward messages in Perry Como Recordings, how they are able to possess
souls and bodies, the feats of higher knowledge they can preform, of
memory, terror, and illusion, and the art of causing turmoil in the earth,
influencing underground currents.
 But alas, he was converted to Eris, but something of his knowledge, is
kept here, in the mouths and minds of the Idolaters of Froot Loops. We
have yet to unlock the secrets, but of this, that which is known, is that
Crisco will be used, and plenty of it.
