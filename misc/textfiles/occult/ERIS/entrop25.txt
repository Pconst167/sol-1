 St Gulik, (also a Roach), God of Trickery, Crossroads and Theives. Messenger
of Eris. The Creator of Writing, which is the art of evasion and 
dissimulation and a naviagation that carrys us to the end of all boundarys,
says that WE should not step on him, unless he jumps on us, or on our food.
      he was also called St. Hermes...

Albert,

AK>      Hey Advice Guy, do you know much about computers?

I beleive it was Chaka Kahn, who wrote:
 "Tell me something good"

and by that I must tell you that I know something about computers
but not about using them. I know about breaking them, and urinating
on them at partys.

AK>      I have been calling bbs's for almost 2 years now, but
AK> I've decided I want to run my own board now.  I want to have

This is classic "Cosby Syndrome" you have been in the network for
awhile, and now you want to own the network. Clearly severe counsiling
is needed. Anyone who wants to run a bbs is clearly sick. Especially
a good bbs as you outlined. As you can see most sysops have not reached
that level of madness, they just run crappy bbs's, as they are "borderline
psychotics". You are truly too ill to be counselled in this text medium.
I think mass quanitys of lithium and caffeine are in order.

AK> and interesting door games, and I want to carry every
AK> fidonet echo in existence.

if Froot_loops is on the list, then you might have hope, for I beleive
it was Bob Hope, who said:
"What?, where the hell am I?"

Wich is a sign of the insanity going into remission state, as the minds
eye focuses and naturally wonders where it is, and what it has done.

AK>      One problem, I don't even know how to delete a file.

You need to read the dos manual cover to cover, its only 697 pages
of the dryest reading you might ever do. Its that or make freinds with
someone who will do it for you. A word of advice: don't let people with
handles like Immortus or Slayer have access to your dos, despite the
good intentions they may have...

AK>      Do you think my lack of DOS knowledge will provide an

not if you are running Os/2

Well I am sure I have solved your problem, feel free to ask
me about something else you may need proffesional guidence with.

   It is with this that we End this Book of the Principia Entropius,
atleast within the form That Is recognizable in this Reality. The alien
Entity, whose plan for Global Fnord Domination, has for some reason
chosen to end Book one here, except for the part wich is invisible.
You are left to ponder the mystery of that decision.
