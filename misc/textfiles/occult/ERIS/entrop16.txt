   Anonymoose Says:

   And it came to pass that Moses needed his socket set back. So he fell
   upon his knees, and prayed to the Lord, 'Oh, Lord, might thee return
   my socket set?' And verily, the Lord sent down an angel. And the
   angel made much fanfare and blowing of horns, and gave Moses back his
   socket set. And there was much rejoicing. And Moses was grateful unto
   the Lord, and he said to the angel, 'Tell my Lord He truly is mighty,
   and just, and great, and all that.' And the angel said unto Moses,
   'Well, actually, the Lord could really rather use your lawnmower.'
   And Moses, being a good man, said 'Oh, Ok.' And verily, the angel did
   take Moses lawnmower, and his gas can.

   From: Advice Guy
     To: Wilbur Gaglestein
Subject: Ask an Idiot

Yes,

 you came to the Right place. Whenever anyone has a question, adress it
to ADVICE GUY and the SUBJECT should be "ASK AN IDIOT".

Ok, I am sensing a lot of love coming from you, Wilbur. Lets examine what
you wrote, shall we?

WG>     I heard that you are both the moderator in this echo and
WG> also the source of excellent advice.  I thought I remember

 I beleive it was "Florida" on good times who once said:

" You got that right, honey child. "

WG>     My problem is with women!  I'm 21 years old, 5' 7",
WG> weigh 185 lbs, and I am a Computer Science major at Memphis
WG> State University.  You would think that would be enough to

I think it was Burl Ives who said:

"Grunt Big For Daddy"

and what he meant by that, is Obviously better left to the Rhetorical
conciousness of the sublimanal factors as illustrated in the book by
Salmon Rushdie and Howard Stern "Feel your Vein". However to Paraphrase:

Love is Ok, Sex is Ok,
     Sex with a partner, is much better.

I think you can see where I am going with that, can't you?
I am sure you can, and can summize your own fallacys with those
words of wisdom, so elequently written, by yours truly.


WG> little shy, however. For instance, I don't really want to
WG> TALK with them, or go on a DATE or anything.  I'm not sure I
WG> am ready for anything as deep as that.  I just want a

In the Words of K.C and the sunshine Band:

"Thats the way, uh-huh, uh-huh, I Like it."

Wich in this instance,is reffering to your innefectual Inner Child who
is in self-Riteous mode. I say don't edit yourself, and don't be afraid
to Experiment here.
  Perhaps, instead of People, Try dating Inanimate Objects for a While,
A desk or Chair. Establish a relationship with the Chair, take it on
little "Excursions" massage the chair.
 Work your way up to Small furry animals, and perhaps one day, primates.
Let the healing take its natural course.

WG> when I return to Little Rock, Arkansas (my home) this

This is your problem. Blow up the town you live in, and then you can
absolve yourself of emotional constrainsts.

WG> while she changes clothes.  I could call her and pretend I
WG> was somebody else.  I could drop little notes in her mailbox
WG> and in her car while she is not looking.  I could sacrifice

Very normal. I think it was Norman Fell who once wrote:

"Jack, You better Put mrs's Ropers Pantys back where you found them!"

Ofcouse, we all know that this is often mis-quoted,but if we look
at the Metaphysical realitys of a self-inherint Jack, one that is
metaphoric for our rapid decrease in abhoria, then the condition is
malevant and Obstentious. With increased dyscordian Dynamics the
effort is resolved and all Alterior Pyschotransitional Expereinces
with the Multiplex is going to increase with the Interjection of the
hoffman Principles. so You can see, that what you are feeling is
perfectly normal, and healthy for a boy your age.

WG> deep devotion.  I would rummage their her trash to find
WG> keepsakes.

This is another deep problem, instead of Rummaging her trash, say
"what is wrong with my own trash?" confront your garbage inadequacy
feelings, and take your trash and put on her lawn late an night, and
then light it on fire. This might eliminate the negative feelings you
are having.

Well I am sure I have solved your problem, Feel free to ask me about
another one at some time.

           as the alien in Muppet's bathtub once said to me:

              FNORD! 

The Cyber-Papacy of FROOT LOOPs, or its MODUS OPERANDI DIVINTIA,
shall be known as a "Moronacy" , as a form of government, likened
unto Utopia and New Atlantis. 
  Morons never do the Wrong thing. The get the reasoning wrong. Like the
fellow who says all dogs are pets and all dogs bark, and cats are pets too,
and therefore all cats bark. Or that all Athenians are mortal, and all 
citizens of Piraeus are mortal, so all the citizens of Piraeus are 
Athenians.
 Wich they are, but only accidentally. Morons will occaisonally say some
thing right, but they will say it for the wrong reason.

      ALL HAIL MORONS!

The great Copulation,is to Cop to the Opionion that if you admit, that you
are an Idiot, your life will be smoother, and you will have less Pressure
to acheive. You have to ofcourse, expect less. Then when you get more,
it will seem even cooler.
