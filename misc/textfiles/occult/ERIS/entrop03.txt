 PART Three OF 15 PRINCIPIA ENTROPIUS

The Yoga of Mediation:
 And the Krishna continued:
     He who does this task
     dictated by duty,
     caring nothing
     for fruit of the action,
     he is a yogi,
     a True Monk.

 and from the Atman Hannabrahman: 
   And Yogi said:
      Ah boo Boo,                                 
      I am much smarter, than the adverage Prayer.*


*1. Theologians and Butchers argue that Prayer, was infact a typo and 
that Sayer or Filet-are, might be what was intended.

 Ask yourself, what is the nature is Principia Entropius? What
reason Do we need for an Expounsian on The Principia Discordia?
Then slap yourself --Thwackly-- across the head, with any blunt
object at hand (preferably a can of Campbells semi-condensed chicken
broth). The expereince you will have, depending on the might used in
the strike, shall illuminate you as to the reason. This is known as
the WHOLLY PAIN OF THE SPIRIT.

FROOT LOOPS, an Entirely different Electro-cyber Cult/faith/club/nifty
breakfast cereal, is a branch of the Erisian Movement. This movement
is defined as the Sacred CHAO BOWEL MOVEMENT. The plan for Global
Domination, to wich it endeavors are entirely secret, and should not
be discussed with anyone who does not know the secret Handshake ala feif.
 Froot Loops, Is to the gargantuan Information Highway, of Computer 
Networks, what Eris is to Catholocism. Except Completely different.
 It is our goal to seek out those, with wich nothing is known of Froot
loops and barrage them with information about It, wich may or may not
even be true information, then To proselytyze them,in hopes of receiving
donation, or purchasing their offspring.

Subject: general disruption

Wellll,
        To start off with, I am a real discordian (as real as they get) and 
the basic text most of us get the idea from is "The Principia Discordia" 
published by Loompanics Unlimited from Port townsend WA. As for philosophy, I 
suppose All you could say is that each discordian has their own. I am 
basically a 25 year old Techno-Wiccan-Cyber-Cerimonial-Thelemic-Herbal-Chaos-
Magician with smatterings of just about everything else one can think of. The 
basic underlying tennant (for me) is that without chaos, order could not 
exist (and vice-versa). Irreverance also plays a great part in my philosophy. 
Coupled with irreverance is also a penchant for not taking anything too 
seriously. What most people don't realize is that I take not taking things 
too seriously very seriously. Also, many people tend to couple irreverance 
with disrespect, It aint so. True Irreverance contains a core of respect for 
everything I make fun of. It takes pretty deep knowledge of a subject to 
truly hit someone with biting sarcasm or a good parody. any more Questions 
about discordian philosophy, just ask and I can go on forever. As for thye 
navy spawning a discordian group, it's not illegal. My first wiccan friend 
was aboard the same sub as me. The Sophomoric Order Of the Discordian Abyss 
(S.O.D.A.) actually started as an idea for Samhain '89 for costuming 
 =purposes. I was dubbed with the title of "Grand High Grand Ghengis" due to 
the fact that I was the, well basically, wierdest of the group. From there it 
has blossomed into a small organization and my crowning achievment as GHGG 
....... Declaring the month of August to be sacred and holy and all who 
validate my divine (or at least demented) right to tower among them shall get 
that month off of work as a holy holiday. Unfortunatley, no employer has of 
yet acknowledged my divinely inspired word (it never hurts to try). I could 
go on forever but I will give your eyes a rest and give you a chance to think 
up some more questions. Oh yea, What are your personal beliefs, Religion, or 
Philosophy? I try to check my mail daily so reply at your lesiure.

 Endeavor to mispel and falsy punctuate and cApitalize. Just enough
 to where they can understand you. It drives them NUTS.
