 --The Draining of the Dragon, is the most holiest of Endeavors,
 and one of the most rewarding. It should be Done, by all that can,
 and in doing so, you are Paying homage to Froot Loops.
  When Flatulating, You are paying homage, to ST. Fergusin, and your
  thoughts should be towards him, especially if in a small, unventalated
  room, alone.
