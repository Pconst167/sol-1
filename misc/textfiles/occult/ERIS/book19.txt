 When it is recalled that Daath is situated at the Point of Where the
abyss bisects the Middle Pillar and that up the Middle Pillar Lies
the path of the Arrow, the Way by which consciousness goes when the
psychic arises on the planes, and that here also is Kundalini, we see that
in Daath is the secret of both generation and regeneration, the key to
the manifestation of all things through the differentiation into pairs
of Opposites and their union in a Third.

confused with the Traditions of Oral Roberts, or other Mystic Cosmologys)

 > Yes and I think it's about time someone else noticed, I think the
 > original discordian rock song was "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen. Is

Nope...try March Of The Black Queen...it was what Bohemian Rhapsody was 
fashioned after...and also by Freddie Mercury...on Queen II, Side Black. In 
fact, Queen II was truly a Discordian album...it had two sides, Black and 
White...

Of course, Matching Tie & Hankerchief was more Discordian...it had THREE 
sides, side 2A, 2B and 2C...by Monte Python...<grin>
