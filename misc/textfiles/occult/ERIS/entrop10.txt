  Begin by combining this name, YHWH, at the beginning alone,
  and examine all its combinations and move it and turn it about
  like a wheel, front and back, like a scroll, and do not let it
  rest, but when you see its matter strengthened because of the great
  motion, because of the fear of confusion of your imagination and the
  rolling about of your thoughts, and when you let it rest, return to
  it, until there shall come to your hand a word of wisdom from it,
  do not abandon it.
            ---Abulafia, 
             Medieval Jewish Cabalist

  ================================================

  Abraham Abulafias "Hokmath ha Zeruf" was at once the science of the
 combination of letters and the science of purification of the heart,
 Mytic Logic, letters whirling in infinite change. Many of Abulafias
 disciples were unable to walk the fine line between the search for
 the true torah or the Contemplation of the names of god, and the
 Practice of magic. It is with this in mind, that cryptographs and
 Coding devices in messages should be dedicated to the master.

you will have (X) amount of names of God. Sefir Yesirahs lost teachings
indicate beyond seven letters a man should stop Figuring. That god does
not have a middle initial, and that in the hebrew alphabet their are no 
vowels, only twenty-two consants and five variants--possible names would
have 29 digits.

This is a highly valuable study. Trying to learn the name of God.
