 He who attempts to Penetrate into the Rose Garden of the Philosophers
 without the key, resembles a man who would walk without feet.

 -------------Anno Dominus----non Erisian Year system.

 FROOT LOOPIAN, F.L, The year on the Calender of the Mundanes of
 the world, the ones who do not adhere to the teachings of Lopian
 is set to Anno Dominus, in the year of our lord, A.D. in this reality. 
 Lopians preffer to use a different, very, very secret dating system,
 we cannot tell anyone about.
  It is so secret, that we use the Dating system of others, to convince
  them, that we infact, don't really have a very elaborate dating system,
  based on the End of "all in the Family".

  ------------------All other Erisian Calender requirements of the
  Principia Discordia, are followed, except for the ones, wich are not.

A further method of defining what lopers believe, regarding the nature of
Mans need for Religion, as something to define values:

 While Humans differ widely in how they worship, but not as much as you
might think in how they should behave. They might differ in what their
Priests claim is divine, but not what their prophets describe as humane.
You can find Discrepancys of this opinion, but when you look at some of
the fundamental beleifs, you will find universal similaritys:

 The Golden Rule:

 Christianity: Mathew 7:12 All things whatsoever ye would that men should
do to you, do you even so to them: for this is the law of the prophets.

 Judaism: Talmud,Shabbat 31a What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow
man. That is the entire law, the rest is commentary,

 Islam: Sunnah: No one of you is a beleiver until he desires for his brother
that wich he desires for himself.

Eris: Principia Discordia: The bearer of this card is a pope, please
treat him good forever. (All those of erisian faith, may claim to be
a pope). 

 Brahmanism:Mahabharata 5,1517 This is the sum of duty: Do naught unto 
others wich would cause you pain if done to you.

 Buddhism:Udana Varga 5,18 Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would 
 find hurtful.

 Confucianism: Analects 15,23: IS there one maxim that ought to be acted 
 upon throughout ones whole life? surely it is the maxim of loving kindness:
 Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

 Taoism: T'ai Shang Kan Ying P'ien (as translated by Lewis Browne) :
Regard your neigbors gain as your own gain, and your neigbors loss, as your
own loss.

 Zoroasrianism: Dadistian-i-dinik: That nature alone is good wich refrains
from doing unto another whatsoever is not good for itself.

Froot Loops:This very part of the book: You should be nice to people who
are nice to you. You should beat the crap out of those, that are not,
if you can, unless they can be persuaded to do something of value for
you, without being beaten. You should run, from those that can beat
the crap out of you, unless you can convince them, that you can do something
for them, if they do not beat you.

There are distinctions in the wordings, but no difference in meaning. Though
diverse, they are not all completely different. While I do not beleive
all Religions follow this pattern, It would be safe to say, that Charity
Is a rather commen thread in the magor religions of the World.

     Isn't it true? Hey, welcome to the club, but don't loose your sense of 
humour as well as your money, or you'd be spiritually bankrupt.
