 Using the Froot Loops Donations I receive, and the money I collect 
standing on the side of the road, with my "Will moderate Stupid Echo
for Food". I decided to Visit Disneyworld in Orlando Florida, for your
benifit. I figured I would tell you if this area should be visited as
a vacation spot. Especially since there is alot of violence against 
Tourist down in sunny Florida. I risked my life to bring you this
reveiw, so you better enjoy it.
  Okay, First I got there on Thursday night, and I checked into my
room at a Howard Johnson. You know, I can't understand what they mean
by HOJO, There was no whores there named Jo- I looked for her. Anyway,
I was real excited and I wanted to get over to Disneyland right away.
I took a shower, put away all my stuff, got dressed and got ready to
get on down there. I also wanted to see Epcot center and all the fabulous
multicultural pavillions they are supposed to have. 
  On The way Out of the Hotel, I passed by someones room, who's television
was on real loud. The Jazzy theme music to "Newhart" was playing. Not
Newhart the next generation, but the Old series. So I went back to my room
to see if it was on my television. Sure enough, Nick at night was having
a Newhart Marathon. I love that show. I mean Howard is so stupid, 
especially that time he tried to put tile down in his kitchen, and he could
not get them to stick to the floor, until Suzzane Pleshette Pulled the 
Paper off the bottom, and said it seemed sticky to her. Howard realized he
hadn't even thought of taking off the paper on the bottom. Gee he is 
stupid.I think he should have got a spin-off called "Howard" instead of
going on to be in "I dream of Jeanie". 
 So the next day, I planned on heading down to Disneyworld, and riding
Space Mountain and visiting Those Animatronic puppets. So once I got 
dressed and ready to go, I started to lead the Howard Johnson's, however
once I got in the Elevator I saw one of those Security Camera's.
 So I started making funny faces and singing Showtunes into the camera.
My favorite song was "Love...Exciting and New, come aboard,We've been
expecting you...Set your sights for adventure, your mind on a new romance."
You know, the theme from the Love boat. Anyway, I figure there's probably
a security gaurd who has to sit there and watch you in the Camera, and that
probably Irritates him, alot. 
 So after a few hours of that, I was pretty Hungry, so I went down to
 Mcdonalds and got some Hamburgers. I was looking forward to getting on
the Monorail that takes you into DisneyWorld. However, I noticed Mcdonalds
had its Own Playground. It wasn't very big, but I couldn't resist going
out there and playing for awhile.
 There was this Slide, and although it was only about 6 feet long, it was
like 9 foot long, and you could do some really wild things, rolling down
into a big pool of Plastic Balls. I tried climbing up it with my socks
on, I couldn't get up to the top. I really couldn't it was amazing.
 Then, I sat on the Head of this big Mayor Mccheese, and wobbled around
 for a couple of hours. While I was on it, I imagined that I was Mayor
Mc cheese, and I decided that I would sentence Hamburgler to death. 
Imagine Hamburgler stealing Hamburgers from all of us who live in Ronald
Mcdonald land. The People who elected Me, Mayor Mccheese Trusted that
I would bring Hamburgler to Justice and Protect them. Then I started
to wonder How I would catch Hamburgler, he always gets away! Then I
started to think, If I were Mayor Mcheese I would be made from chopped
meat,and have a sesame seed bun for a head. That sort of freaked me out.
So as I left I contributed the rest of my Trip money to Ronald Mcdonald
House, I wonder how big of a damn house that stupid Clown needs?
 anyway, without any money they wouldn't let me in Disneyworld, so I
had to go away. I stole some Flyers that were in a rack however, so I got
something out of the deal. One was about Disneyworld, the other Two
were for Weekee Wachee underwater Gardens and the Everglades Alligator Zoo,
They have over 11,000 snakes there. Wow!

   The Principia is the wonder book of the ages. Within its pages is found a 
message for every seeking soul, regardless of where he may be on the path of 
spiritual attainment. There is hope, counsel and inspiration for the narrowest 
and most conservative of minds; while at the same time there are glorious 
words of light for the liberal and questing intellect. There is comfort and 
instruction for the simplest, and exalted cosmic doctrine for the highest 
Initiate this earth planet is able to produce.

   It is an error to say that the Principia is nothing more than an 
antiquated book belonging to a time two thousand years in the past. 
The Principia is a mystery book, a wisdom book of tremendous power, 
a continuous running cipher created by great Initiates and their helpers 
through millenia of effort. It belongs equally to the Past, the Present, 
and to the Future.

   So carefully have its secrets been inscribed in the Principia text, coil 
within coil, that the more spiritual man becomes the profounder are the 
meanings which this book reveals to him.

   As it is written in the Zohar, "Woe to the man who sees in the Thorah (the 
Law) only simple recitals and ordinary words!...Each word of the Thorah 
contains an elevated meaning and a sublime mystery...The simple take notice 
of the garments and recitals of the Thorah alone...The more instructed 
do not pay attention to the vestment, but to the body which it envelopes."


   Some Crazy People argue, the above could be applied to the bible,
    but anything could be applied here, if you wanted to make it fit.
