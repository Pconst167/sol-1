   Doctrine of The Holy Chapter of Froot Loops, and Useful Text file.

            Devised by his Assholiness S'wingitus Dickitomus
                and his Nunzio John Kanash Esq.

                 THE MAGNUM OPIATE OF Swinging Dick!

                             Wherein Is Explained
                     Absolutely Everything Worth Knowing
                          About Absolutely Anything
                            and then Some, but not as much
                            as before....Wich was more.



    This Text File describes a Wayward sect of The Discordian Soceity.
The Froot Loops Cult as it is come to be called by some, is not as
religously devout as others of its kind, and Prefers to work in Mundane
guises. Essentially We are to Fido What Erisians are to Christianity.
 We have developed our Entire Culture around the Tellecomunications medium
of our Faith. We speak of BBS's as one might of their Temples. We speak
of Echos as one might of their Streets or Plazas or Stables. WE speak of
Fresh meat and dirty linen as if it were Fresh meat and Dirty linen so
as you can see, we are "tetched by the fever".
  
   ________     Introduction   _____________

 Much as Inspired by the Devout faith of Erisians,and the Principia 
Discordia, This book destined to be a (Literatus Immortalus) as great
as perhaps something written by wise old guys, who are long since dead.
 Perhaps even greater than the Principia Discordia, or the Farmers Almanac.
         One thing that Distresses me, is that the author of the PD,
 was so Vague about who created, as if anyone cared that an alien Inteligence
of Some magnitude had created this text file, in order to subvert human Kind
into its servitude...I mean this is immaterial.

   Only for you, children of Doctrine and learning, have we written
   this work.Examine this Book, ponder the meaning we have dispersed
   in various places and gathered again; what we have concealed in
   one place we have disclosed in another, that it may be understood by
   your wisdom.
