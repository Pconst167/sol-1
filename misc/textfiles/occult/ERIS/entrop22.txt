To: Knightstalker
Re: Methinks, therefore Meam...
What Ho,....
       Knightstalker, Doth Thou Stalketh Knights? Well Stalketh no longer,
For Here I am, Sir Go-Awaine,  to clear up a few misconceptions, for instance,
 Old Aenglish mispellings and Misconceptions about the Aurthurian age.
Did Thou Knoweth:
      Camelot, as you call was actually called "Crapalot", for when making it
a Rookery of birds did roost and eat all the Bread set out to cool, they then
bombarded us for days with the nasty whitestuff. We thought it was sorcery and
we're forced to Rape and Burn a fair young Virgin to Ward them off.
 In Welsh legends, it was Called "smuckers, land of the Grape".
When Lady Gynevhyver and her Vixenous freind Lady Isolde first came to
Crapalot, the name of the Castle was temporarily changed to "Cumalot", wich
was soon changed back, after Aurthur married Gynevhyver....


  Sir Lancelot, was actually sir Dancealot, the Predecessor to the person
thou doth know as Danny Terrio of Dance Fever.....He was the greatest Dancer
in the land, not the greatest Jouster.


  Excrabitor, was not a sword. Aurthur got it from the lady of the lake, but
it was the name we gave to the disease wich you call "The Crabs"....In
Aurthurs time It marked you as a man of great power and Flatulencey.

It was Sir Ferguson of the Rusted Gate, That was known to All of the Britons
as the Greatest Knight, for he was feared near and wide, for his Flatulencey.
This was the mark of a True Knight....


 Sir GalIhad, Not Sir Galahad....He was always bragging about what Gal he had
had....He was not to bright, as many times mistaken a Horses Rear, for that
of a ladys Mouth.


  Sir Sherman of the Shelbyites, a Tribe in the far northern reaches of
Logres, Known as a gobbler of Goo, and a wobbler of Woo. None were sillier
than he.


Sir De Bovine, Was indeed a cow...who we thought would be funny to knight.
 It was always entertaining to read storys written later about him, as if he
had actually done them.


Sir Pumice, a Vile Saxon Knight, Known for claiming to have built Crapalot,
and to be the true king of The Britons, even though everyone knew he was
an idiot, he was allowed to sulk around Crapalot. A Truer Imbecile, there
never was.



     Well, Knightstalker I must ride, yonder calls the voice of Adventure
and I must meet it, and my Destiny...I shall stop to share with you some
more facts about The Aurthurian Legends one day, but let me also say-
 That Robin Hood did not exist at the time of King Aurthur, we never sang
and Danced as the Play Camelot would show us (except for Sir Dancealot),
and the Aurthurian Legends were all a myth, including myself, they never
existed.

                  Methanks you from the bottom of meheart,

                       Sir Go a waine,

 After Beaujeu, The Order hs never Ceased to Exist, not for a moment,
and after the Aumont We find an un-interuppted sequence of Grand Masters
of the Order down to Our own Time, and if the name and seat of the True
Grand Master and True Seneshchals who rule the Order and guide its sublime
Labors remain a mystery Today, an Imprenetrable Secret known only to the
truly enlightened, it is because the hourhas not struck and the time
is not ripe.............
