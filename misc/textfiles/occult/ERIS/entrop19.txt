subject: lunch meat
The most sacred text of all:
   It was written on a loaf of turkey baloney. Upon the 23 slices were put the
most inspired words of the gODDESS herselph. They exposed the universe to a
power unlike that of anything yet to be seen. All of the pages but one were
mistakenly made into a school lunch. The remaining page rests in the sacred
fantastic four lunchbox withe the Wholly Wrelic of the apple of yappledapple.
it is difficult to read after ten years but the words are still earth
shattering. I can furnish a transcription upon request if you would like or if
anyone reading this would like.
