                        "Break, break, break
                 At the foot of thy stones, O Sea!
                   And I would that I could utter
                   The thoughts that arise in me!"

  Nomic is a game where the basis of the game (and
  the rules of the game) is to change the rules and
  collect points.

 The initial rules set makes it so each turn you
 get 1-6 points, regardless of events. But that is
 usually the first thing to be changed.
        Nomic is a sacred game of MOO...  It first got published in
Scientific American (which we secretly own and control, being of the
progressive and scientifically minded type) in 1982...  Basically you
begin with a bureaucratic set of rules which allow you to proceed by
altering and adding rules each turn.  It therefore mutates into whatever
seems appropriate.
        You can check out a copy of the rules in the Book of MOO unless
it's been eaten by Woob the Magnificent, or in Douglas Hofstadter's book
"Metamagical Themas"...  Nomic is a substitute for Mao when nobody can
figure out how to play THAT.


* note: When the Author of this portion of the book said "We" he did not
mean, "You".

  It was widely beleived that Hari! Om, was translated as "let us meditate 
profoundly and in peace", but through careful examination of never before
seen Upanishads, it was discovered that it meant "hey, pull my finger.."

  When Writing a Book, I have to give you some guidelines, The first one
is to Read other books, and take the ideas from them, and change them
a bit, and claim they are your own. That is actually not good advice,
but it is still a guideline.
  Okay, Also a snappy name, something that grabs the reader, right by the
throat, like "De Amy Fisher Ala Potty Chunks and Buttafuckios Chrystal
Dream Analysys new Age Bullcrapioso", You can see how the Italianizeing
the name, lends a certain credibility to it.
 Then What you write, must be splendid, it must be genuine, it must be
a thing of beauty, constantly changing and in flux, (especially if
it were to be an Discordian Book). 
 Then you must understand the concept of the MAGDEBURG HEMISPHERES. Two
Hemispheres, which when put together and the air is pumped out, create
a pnuematic vaccuum inside. Teams of Draft Horses are hitched to them,
and they pull in oppissitte directions. The Horses cannot seperate the
Information---This is Scientific Information, but its special, picturesque.
 You must single it out, DRAMATIZE....
