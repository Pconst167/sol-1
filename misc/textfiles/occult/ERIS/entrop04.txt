Title  : Getting drunk and bugging the fuck out of you.

Now why the hell did I do that?

Alcohol claimed my soul.
Alcohol, takes its toll.
I am not a dwarf or troll,
I miss watching "Kids in the Hall",
I haven't got it on the ball,
and it's all the fault of alcohol!


Everybody sing!

Al-co-hol!
Al-co-hol!
Let's go get wasted at the mall!
Sing and get drunk and fall down in the hall,
Oh wonderous and joyous al-co-hol!

[The following is read in a soft, rough voice as people go "ooo-oooo" in the 
background...]

I was at Hellhound's party...  I got kinda fucked up.
And there was Half-Mad, his shaved head glistening in the moonlight.
And I don't know why, but like some kind of insect, I buzzed around him.
And he had the decency not to reach out and *swat* me.
Halfy, you're a gentleman and a scholar, and I dedicate this song to you.

Everybody sing!

Al-co-hol,
Al-co-hol!
We all have been in its enthrall!
We all get wasted,
We all have tasted,
the wonderous power of alcohol!

If I live to be 90, or perhaps 84,
And I learn to walk upright, 
And not crawl on the floor,
I'll dedicate my life to AA
and helping the mauled...

But I'll never...
No I'll never...
Give up......

(dramatic silence.  We're all waiting for a repeat of that word so common to 
this song.  Yet it seems the singer has passed out.  Oh well.)

------------Ancient Greeks beleived Jim Morrison Orignated this Hymm----

and are subject of great conjecture and discussion, by the holy and unholy
of frootLoopianism.
