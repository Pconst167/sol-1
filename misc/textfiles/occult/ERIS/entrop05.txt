
 PART Five OF 15 PRINCIPIA ENTROPIUS
 ____________________________________


Rules,Rules, Rule, Since the Code OF Hamurapi, the ancient Pre-cursors,
who envisioned the enlightened age of Frootlooptopia, Dreamed of many
many rules. These rules are for sale, and anyone with money, should see
brother Ramen, To purchase them.
 Actually, One should study, the many  many many Rules of FROOT LOOPS, but
not to closely, for the ancient curse of Eyecrossia or Boredomi may
vent its frustration on those seeking the wisdom of the sacred rules.
 Rules are neccesary, judged by another Faith, the faith of FIDO, it is
our firm beleif, that the only way to enjoy life is to have lots and
lots of rules, then change them.

It is my firm beleif, that it is not wise, to hold firm beleifs.

Belboian Printout:
   The Templars have something to do with everything,
   what follows is not true,
   Jesus was crucified under pontius pilate
   The sage Omus founded the Rosy cross in Egypt
   There are cabalists in provence
   Who was married at the feast of Cana?
   Minnie Mouse is Mickys Fiancee
   It logically follows that
   if 
   the druids venerated black virgins
   then
   Simon Magus identifies sophia as Prostitute of Tyre
   Who was married at the feast of Cana?
   The Merovvingians proclaim themselves king by divine Right
   The Templars have something to do with everything.

Froot Lopian Proverb:

  Those that Can, Do.
  Those that Do, Do.
  Those that Doo-Doo, can.
