  Who knows the Story of Prometheus bringing fire to mankind and consequently
destroying mankind? The Fire Theft is a universal mythic theme, a trickster
animal, but the Hittites had Beaveus, who would teach little children, to
burn down their homes, when their parents left them unattended.

               By the Esteemed Theologian Floyd Z Gecko


        Who're you callin' a cult?  Don't you recognize a bacon-and-tomato
mashed-waffle-salad-sandwich when you see one?  Our rules are of the type
which is transitory yet permanent.  By the Eternal Doctrine of the
Perpetual Reversability, we can retroactively institute a rule which has
been in effect as long as need be.  EVEN SINCE BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF
TIME ITSELF!

        Now that's a cult.

        Besides, we have lots of rules.  There's the Ten Commandments,
the Other Ten Commandments, the Ten Commandments We Forgot The Second
Time, the Twelve Commandments, the Fourteen (16) Commandments, the
One Commandment, the REAL One Commandment, and the Ten Commandments That
Someone Should Have Written Down When I Was Giving Dictation But Somehow
Managed To Lose In The Shuffle Somewhere On The Plane Trip To Buffalo.

        Now that's what I call rules.
