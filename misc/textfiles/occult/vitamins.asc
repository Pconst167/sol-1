              VITAMINS & THEIR USES
              ---------------------
The following list represents several months of reading and general research into the topic of improved health thru prevenative vitamin intake. The sources are numerous, but a large part comes from several books on Herbology, Medications & vitamins by Richard Alan Miller. I present this as a personal collection of notes and note as an authoratative medical paper.

A          : Proetctive against sterility. Works hand-in-hand with E. Also used
             to treat prostate and menstrual disorders.
B 1 (Thiamine) : deficiencies of this can result in nervous manifestations and
             mood swings, fatigue, depression, anxiety and apathy.
B 2 (Riboflavin) necessary for healthy skin, and avoiding depression.  Found in
             green vegetables, milk, eggs & wheat germ.
B 3 (Niacin) early signs of its depletion is the loss of a sense of humor. 
             cleans the bloodstream of poisons, carbohydrate buildup etc. Has
             been used to reduce the effects on the circulatory system from
             smoking. Note that for a day or two after taking this alchol
             tolerance level is reduced drastically so that very small 
             quantities can produce lightheadedness etc. Niacin can also produce
             shortly after taking a 'flush' effect on the skin and overheating
             so use in small doseages at a time only.
B 5 (Pantothenic Acid) Fortifies white blood cells and avoidence of hair 
             greying.
B 6 (Pyridoxine) promotes healthy teeth, gums & skin; assists in the manufacture
             of hemoglobin & certain hormones.  It also prevents excess fluid
             retention, especially in females.
B 12 (Cyanocobalamin) essential for formation of red blood cells. Found only in 
             eggs, liver, kidneys, beef, milk, spiraalina & brewers yeast.
B 17 (amygdalin or laetrile) may be effective against certain types of cancer;
             is an effective contraceptive for women. Papaya seeds and apricot
             kernels are the main sources for it. (To use as a contraceptive
             large quantities are needed).
C (Ascorbic Acid) besides that which is generally known, some recent studies
             published in medical journals have shown that maintaining high
             levels of vitamin C can reduce the possibility of contracting
             AIDS if exposed. (These studies are not yet confirmed by the FDA
             or AMA and are thus considered ongoing research).
Folic Acid (folacin) helps to produce antibodies vs infection and maintains the
             functions in the lower intestinal tract.
E  (Mixed Tocopherols) positively influences the production of male sex hormones
             and help breaks up arterial cholesterol. 400 to 1600 units daily
             is the safe doseage. women on oral contraceptives require high
             supplements of vitamin E and Folic acid.
Lecithin     : must be replaced after male orgasm; increases the quality &
             Quantity of sperm. Found in vegetable oil, unroasted nuts & eggs.
Zinc         : important for prostate gland health and the reproductive system.

I am not a medical professional, but all of the above was from original medical sources and studies. Use them as you will.
