
In the second rite, in addition to what you have setup, a mirror and two of
the following  color candles: violet, blue, green, yellow, red, and black.
This is not a group rite but for  you alone. Begin this rite the same way you
did the first rite, by clearing the four points of  the room. Setup the bowl
of water and a mirror directly behind it.  You will use four  candles placed
upon the Night Altar, one on each corner.  The two closest to you will be
black candles.  The other two candles' colors depend upon what you are trying
to  accomplish.  When this rite is properly setup and performed, you will be
able to see your  Guides and Teacher and to receive answers to questions you
put before them.  The color  combination of the candles is very important.

If you wish to have questions answered by no one in particular, then a blue
and red  candle are used.  Another strong color combination you can use is red
and violet.  To  contact your Night Teacher, the color combination must match
their personal harmony  and frequency.  There is a chart located in Appendix B
which will give you the proper  color combination for the various Night
Teachers I speak of in this work.  For those Night  Teachers not listed or if
you're not sure who yours is, then you can use the blue and red  candle
combination to find out and also their specific color combination to be used
in this  rite.  Here is how to use this rite.

Be sure you have cleared the four points in the room and have surrounded
yourself in the  Night Pillar.  Otherwise, you will attract the wrong force.
Setup the bowl of water with the  black candles in front and the other two in
the rear, (make sure that the four candles can  be seen in the mirror), and
the mirror directly behind the bowl.  Light the candles and your  ready to
begin.  Meditate upon your Teacher and Guides and upon the fixtures in front
of  you.  Be sure to get comfortable, surround yourself in the Pillar of
Protection, and relax  with Night Breathing. Sit directly in front of the
Night Altar, such that, you will see the top  and surface of the water in the
mirror.  The reflection you should see in the mirror, is the  surface of the
water and the candles. The candles will form a figure 8.  The faces of the
Teacher, or Guides, will appear in the reflection of the water in the mirror,
or just above  the actual bowl.  If at anytime you should start to lose the
vibration, stand up and again  clear the four points and begin at another
time. Not only will the faces appear in the  mirror but also images that will
answer your questions.  It is also possible that you will  hear the voice of
the Teacher from the image that appears.  This is very much akin to  picture
telephones.  Your mind should be free of mental garbage and worries.  You
should also be in good overall health.  If you seem to fail at first then you
know that you  are making true progress.  As with anything, you must practice
over and over again to achieve true results.  If you do so, then you'll
achieve the highest results.  You have  learned so much about the Astral
Realm.  But wouldn't it be great if you could go there  and see it for
yourself?   Well if your ready, just turn the page and you'll be on your way.

29.  Night Projection

Perhaps a more familiar term for what you are about to study is Astral
Projection or  traveling. The word "Astral" is derived from the Latin and
Greek language which means  "of the stars". You learned in the beginning of
this chapter on Water Magick, that the  Astral Body interpenetrates the
physical body.  Your consciousness resides in the  physical body during the
day and by night, when your physical body sleeps, your  consciousness resides
in the Astral Body.  People don't remember what takes place  during their
Astral sojourns because they believe that this physical world is the only true
reality, and so their mind rationalizes what they have seen in the Astral
Realm into a  distorted dream.  But if you truly believe that the Astral Realm
exists and that you can go  there then you will remember what you have seen
and done in the Astral Realm and  remember it upon awakening.  Yet, you can go
beyond dreaming and actually travel  there.  You can bring back your
experiences in the Astral Realm. You can do this by  learning, consciously, to
project yourself into the Astral Realm.  This is Astral or Night Projection.

To begin with, in learning to Night Project consciously, you must learn to
have no fear.   Fear is the greatest destroyer of good results in this work.
Fear will prevent you from  accomplishing anything in Night Magick.  So do not
be afraid to Night Project. You can  not get lost while you reside in the
Astral Realm.  The physical body is firmly attached to  the Astral Body by the
silver cord.  No matter where you travel in the Astral Realm,  whenever you
wish to return to the physical body, simply think of yourself there, and you
will do so.  Why would you want to travel in the Astral, in the first place?

To begin with you could see how well you're doing so far in your sojourn on
Earth.  You  can meet face-to-face with your Guides and Teacher and receive
first hand instruction on  how to solve certain problems.  You can receive
instruction on how to better your life and  access the lessons you have
learned so far.  You can also travel anywhere on the Earth  plane you wish to.
You can see great libraries and be able to read the books contained  therein.
You could see museums and other places of interest. There is no limit to the
things you can do while Night Projecting.  But be warned if you try to go
somewhere and  invade another's privacy.  You are liable to receive an "astral
shock" and get slammed  back into your body with a terrific headache. Although
the person you visited may not be  able to physically see you their
subconscious will be able to do so and send a strong  astral blow to your
Astral Body.  Its best if you don't go where you intuit you shouldn't go.
Without fear and listening to your Oversoul for guidance your ready to Night
Project.

First, you should watch your diet before Night Projecting.  Try to eat as
little fried food as possible.  Do not travel on a full stomach.  You won't
get anywhere if you are  uncomfortable because your stomach is full and in the
process of digestion.  For about a  week prior to actually projecting you
should prepare yourself mentally by repeating the  following invocation, four
times daily. Do it once in the morning, noon, evening, and  before going to
bed.  The invocation is, "On this day ___, I am going to Night Project.  I  am
going to travel in the Astral Realm and remember all that I see and do.  I
will recall all  of this after I have returned to my body.  This I will do and
won't fail."  On the day you  have selected to Night Project be sure and have
as peaceful and quiet a day as possible.   You must try and keep your mind on
the subject of Night Projecting all that day.  You  must look forward to going
to bed that night with the intentions of traveling in the Astral  Realm.  Now,
you need to learn to relax before projecting.

Many will say this is easy for them to do, but actually this is not true.
True relaxation is  an art and must be practiced to be mastered.  To begin
Night Projection, you must be fully  relaxed. There must not be a tense nerve
or muscle in your entire body. When you lay  down to project, the room must be
just right, being neither too cold, or hot, if you are to  achieve true
relaxation. To assist relaxing and projecting, darken the room and secure it
from entry by anyone else.  In no way should there be any way that you can be
disturbed.   If you are touched, while traveling, this could cause harm to
your physical body.  Further,  no one should attempt to try Night Projection
if they are prone to heart trouble.  This is not  to scare anyone, but the
body should be in good health.  You should not cover yourself  with heavy
bedding for this will interfere with relaxation and projecting.  If you're
ready to  relax, then let's begin.

Turn your consciousness upon your toes.  Concentrate mentally on them and see
them relaxing.  See all the tension leaving the toes.  Next, work on the foot
and see all tension leaving it.  Do this all the way up one leg and then do it
for the other leg.  Do not go on till  there is no tension or tightness in any
part of your lower extremities.  Then move on to the  pelvic region and do the
same relaxation technique.  Then do the arms and each finger,  individually,
till you feel calm and relaxed.  The stomach and chest region are next, then
on up the neck and finally, the head region.  Relax the jaw and forehead.
Relax each part  thoroughly before going to the next part.  Once you have
accomplished this, it is time to  relax the mind.

In order to relax your mind, allow your thoughts to dwell on a beautiful day
with billowy clouds in the sky.  Take your thoughts and place them on one of
those beautiful dark  clouds. Just relax and drift on the cloud and let your
mind forget all its worries. Think of  nothing else but the deep sensation of
peace and floating on the cloud.  At this point your  eyes should be closed.
Relax your thoughts and for a few moments try to think of nothing.   In Night
Projection, you are where your thoughts are.

The Astral Body looks somewhat like your own physical body so picture it
floating about  three feet above you.  You must know that you're actually
floating above your physical  body.  Relax, do not force the process, do not
strain or induce tenseness in the physical  body, and above all, do not jerk.
If your body jerks, then you will find that you will have to  wait till the
next night to try again.  You will feel a floating sensation and a gentle
sense  of rising.  This is great! If you don't jerk, then you will find that
you will continue to float  and rise, so carefully, open your eyes.  You will
have found that you have floated up and  away from your physical body.  If you
want to view your room then you can do so by just  thinking of doing so, but
be careful.  The experience is something akin to hearing your  voice for the
first time on the tape recorder.  It will be quite a shock and you'll hardly
believe it's your body.  Some have become so startled that they have returned
to their  bodies with a shock. Do not be startled or afraid.  Just relax as
you float there and get  used to the sensation of your new body.  You will
find that you are naked.  If you will think  of clothes, then you will be
dressed, but remember to put that thought away in a corner of  your mind in
order to remain dressed.  Slowly, "will" yourself to settle back to the floor.
What will you do next?

For the first night, it is best that you go straight to the Astral Realm.  All
you need do is  think of being there and you will do so.  Wherever you want to
be your thoughts will take  you. If you will go to the Astral Realm first, and
thereafter spend a little time in the Astral  before doing other things on the
Earth plane, you will never have trouble getting out of the  physical body
again.  You will also receive a tremendous magickal recharge by visiting  the
Astral Realm. When you want to return simply think of your physical body and
you  will be there.  Now, you must return slowly, and carefully, back into
your body.

It is essential that you do this slowly.  Have you ever had a dream where you
felt yourself suddenly falling and woke up with a start.  This is what happens
when you return too fast  into your physical body.  It is essential to align
the two bodies up correctly, or you will  suffer from a headache.  If this
happens, simply fall back to sleep and when you awaken  the alignment process
will have occurred naturally and the headache will be gone.  On  reentry, you
will feel as if you are returning to a very dense and cold body.  It won't be
the  most comfortable experience in your life.  But this shows you how much
more crude and  slower a rate of vibration the physical body really is. There,
you have Night Projected.   Let's examine another technique for projecting
yourself out of your physical body.

Again relax fully and make sure that there are no rough edges disturbing your
body and distracting you.  Have your eyes closed and roll them up so that, in
effect, you are looking somewhere up at the top of your forehead.  Do not
create eyestrain though. Breathe  regularly, rhythmically, and deeply then
forget all about your breathing.  Turn your  conscious awareness towards your
third Night Center which is located over the solar  plexus, or navel area.  It
is from this area that the Astral Body leaves the physical body.   Visualize
your Astral Body slowly starting to leave your physical body.  Picture the
third  Night Center like a window through which the Astral is going to leave.
See the Astral as a  cloud-like figure, shaped similarly to the physical body,
and slowly rising up and floating  about six feet above the physical form.  At
this point any one of the following might  happen: 1) again you might jerk and
return to your body and so on another night you'll  have to try again, 2)
you'll feel a tingling or numbness in your physical body which is a  good
sign, but which you should ignore.  From here, you will feel a rigidity or
stiffness  come over the body and you will not be able to move. DON'T PANIC!
This is an excellent  sign of progress.  You will be able to see as if through
your eyelids and the surroundings  will be bathed in a soft light, if you
remain calm, you will begin to feel a slight swaying  and out you'll move into
the Astral Realm. You will see things in very vivid colors and with
remarkable clarity, 3) you may feel a swaying motion and then experience the
feeling as if  going through a dark tunnel, at the end of which is a bright
light.  At the end of the tunnel  you will pass through a curtain of brilliant
colored drops and then, suddenly you will be in  the Astral World.  Night
Projection is a very beautiful experience.

Have no fear and you will have no problems.  Don't be discouraged if, at
first, you don't  succeed. Nothing ever comes too easy in life but must be
worked at with great patience  and diligence. Never talk about your travels
except to help others.  Use it to grow  magickally on the road of Night
Magick.  Remain always in the Shadow of your Night  Teacher as you travel in
the Greater Realms.  You have come to the end of another  chapter in Night
Magick.

It was a chapter filled with the wonders of Water Magick and the Astral Realm.
You have  come to know the Realm, intimately, and even how to travel in it
while still living in a  physical body. You have explored the secret uses of
water.  You have learned secrets  about your physical and Astral bodies and
the inner power contained within them.  You  can look at others now and know
their thoughts and emotions by the use of your Night  Eye.  You have met the
Goddess Diane and perhaps most importantly, you have come to  know that you
are never alone in this world.  That your love ones and friends are just in
the next Realm always waiting to help you if you will let them.  Yet, for the
moment, you  must leave the beauty of the Astral Realm and the lore of Water
Magick and enter into a  higher and even more exciting phase of Night Magick.
This is the Mental Realm and the  lore of Air Magick.

CHAPTER  VI


AIR  MAGICK 

30.  The Mental Realm 

As you travel on the road of Night Magick and endeavor to become a Night
Magician, you  first had to gain some mastery over your physical and emotional
selves.  This is a long  process and may take many lives to accomplish.  But
as you begin to achieve that  mastery, you will continue down the road towards
Night Consciousness.  Now you will  travel the third portion of the road
towards self-mastery.  You enter the Realm of Mind.

As you found with the Astral Realm, the Mental Realm is composed of varying
levels of vibration.  It would be wise to examine, in brief, these different
vibrations and their interrelationship. Let's begin with the highest realm and
work our way down to the lowest level.

The Void is the highest level that can be reached.  It is the level where we
are all united in  Mind as One.  Here, all are One.  This is the level of
knowing.  Here, you do not think for  all is known. Here all ideas exist, all
things are known, and you as the Spirit are the  Knower.  This is the level of
Pure Mind, the Void Mind, the sum of all.  This mind essence  interpenetrates
all and is accessible to all who are in vibration with it.  This is the
ultimate  level all must someday reach.  You must be the Knower.  The Godsoul
Mind is the next  level.

This is the level of original mind.  Here all minds are as one yet there is
individuality.   This is the level of highest individual mind.  Here is the
origin of the archetypes of mind. The Oversoul Mind is the next level.

This is the level of the Higher Mind.  From out of the Godsoul Mind, ideas
that exist  become manifest in this world.  Here, you find all joined in the
Oversoul Mind.  There is  Oneness in thought and consciousness.  The Oversoul
Thought first creates, using the  ideas drawn from the Godsoul Mind and the
mind substance of the Oversoul Realm.   Here, you are the Oversoul in Thought
and Action, the Creator.  Now you enter the  physical world of thought and
mind.

You may believe you know this world.  Actually, your thoughts and
consciousness are  much more then you realize.  You will remember that your
emotions were tied into your  emotional or Astral Body. Your thoughts and
consciousness are the same and make up  the Mental Body.  It is through your
Mental Body that you think and have consciousness  on the physical plane.  But
in order for the physical body to be tied into this Mental Body,  there must
be a physical link and this is the brain.  Many believe that it is the brain
that  actually does the thinking, but the brain is actually a receiving
station.  It takes the Mental  energies sent to it, by the Mental Body, and
translates it into action in the physical body.   Your brain is attuned to the
wavelength of your Mental Body.  Your brain and Mental  Body produces an
electromagnetic current through its activities, and thus, also produces  a
Mental Aura which is akin to your Astral Aura.  To see these energies, you
would have to  develop your Night Eye to a greater degree then you had when
you saw the Astral  energies.  I discussed earlier how the Oversoul is
directly linked to the physical body via  the silver cord into the heart
region.  The silver cord is also directly linked to the brain  region.  Thus
your thoughts are always monitored and acted upon by your Oversoul.  Your
Oversoul in order to experience the physical world must build-up physical
counterparts to  its Magickal Being.

So in the beginning of the Oversoul's physical sojourn, the mind substance of
the Mental  Body is undeveloped.  But as time in this world and the others
passes, the physical mind  develops and slowly becomes refined.  Life after
life, you come to this plane trying to  develop your physical consciousness
into one with your Oversoul consciousness.   Although the Oversoul can
influence the Mental Body if the Mental Body does not listen  then there is
little that the Oversoul can do.  The majority of the world does not listen to
the Oversoul.  Therefore the Oversoul withdraws into its own realm and remains
there  until the Lower Mind calls upon it for assistance and tries to listen
and follow its will. This  is what you are trying to do. So, as you move
farther into this chapter on Air Magick, you will encounter exercises,  rites,
and the use of your Night Magician's Tools and Weapons, in order to develop
your  mind.  You will take your mind through the tests of self-mastery in
order to become a  Night Magician. Your first rite in Air Magick will give you
the link between the air and  your mind.

31.  Air Rite 

The Ancient Ones compared the element of air to that of the mind. The Ancient
Mysteries, likewise, showed that the mental faculties could be compared to the
aerial regions.  It is  my intention to introduce a rite that will greatly
benefit the mind and its faculties.  The rite  puts together two elements:
your mind and the air.  I will show you how your mental  powers can be
enhanced through a special form of breathing.

You will remember in the topic on Night Breathing that it was through very
deep breathing that your health could be improved and for many, breathing is
very shallow.  In the Air  Rite, you are going to use deep breathing but it is
going to be based on a particular  breathing rate. Instead of just breathing
in and out rhythmically, you will breathe in and  hold the breath for so long,
and then breathe out and then, again, hold your breath. Great  benefit can be
derived by such.  Before you begin, I want to make it clear that this is
serious business and not a game. Please, DO NOT deviate from the set pattern
that is  about to be described.  To do so can be very hazardous to your
health.

To begin with, you must sit or lie down so that you are very comfortable.
Then, you want  to become very relaxed and reduce all the tenseness possible
in your body.  Then, you  will need to cross your ankles and wrists to
build-up the energy from your breathing.  If  you have done all of this, then
you are ready to begin with the breathing.  To start with,  you will do three
complete deep breathing exercises.  If you have forgotten how, then here  is a
quick review.

Inhale as deep a breath as possible pushing the diaphragm out as far as
possible.  When  you feel you have taken in all the air possible, take in just
a bit more air.  Then exhale the  air very steadily and completely bringing in
the diaphragm and abdomen as far as  possible.  You want to really empty your
lungs.  After you have done this, you are ready to  do the timed breathing.

Timed breathing means you are going to breathe in for so many seconds, then
hold your  breath for so many seconds, then exhale so many seconds, and again
hold your breath  for so many seconds. In the Air Rite, you are going to begin
by inhaling for five seconds,  hold your breath for ten seconds, exhale for
ten seconds, and hold your breath for seven  to ten seconds.  You are going to
repeat the entire process ten times.  There are certain  precautions you must
take in doing this rite.

You must not do it if you are in poor health.  You must stop doing it if for
any reason you  are feeling dizzy or light headed. If you persist in doing it
past these warning signals then  you are likely to pass out.  You must not
strain yourself in doing this rite.  There should be  absolutely no force on
your part to maintain the pattern of breathing.  If there is, then you  need
to reduce the number of seconds that you hold your breath.  If you do the rite
correctly then the benefits are tremendous.

You will find that your mental health will be tremendous.  You will feel
relieved of all  tension and mental strain.  You will feel extra charged with
new mental power.  This is an  excellent rite to use before and after any of
the mental exercises in Air Magick.  If you  need added mental power for long
periods of study or for increased memory then this rite  will greatly increase
both.  If your world is filled with mental demands, then this rite is  best
practiced several times a day.  It is especially good to use it when you feel
the least  mentally drained.  You can see that there is a very close
relationship to the air you  breathe and your mental faculties.  It is all
based on the right use of your breathing  patterns.  You should remember to be
relaxed and not to strain when you use the Air Rite.   Further, you must not
play around with different patterns of timed breathing if you don't  want to
hurt yourself.  You should always use this rite to the benefit of your good
health.   By now, you should be mentally charged up and ready to explore the
power of your mind.

32.  Power of Thought 

As the title suggests, there is power in your thoughts.  You probably have
never thought of  your thoughts as containing any kind of power but they do.
Much of Mental Magick  requires your understanding of the Mental Realm and how
to increase the powers of your  mind.   Here I will discuss briefly the Mental
Realm and begin your development of a  more powerful Mental Body.

When you die to the physical plane you move first to the Astral Realm.  After
reviewing  your past life and lives, you then receive guidance as to what to
do next.  If you are of a  higher vibration then that of the Astral Realm,
then you may leave, or die to, the Astral and  go on to the Mental Realm.  It
is here in the Mental Realm that all ideas are first brought  forth in created
form.  It is a world of thought and creation through thought.  The great
creations, inventions, social ideas, and art that are in the world today were
originally  created in this mind world and released into the physical world.
Here, in the physical  world, a receptive individual is able to tune into
these thought patterns and create from  them on the physical level. Thought
creation is the work of the Great Beings who live upon  this Mental World.
They create in thought great things that will enhance the physical  world.
This leads to your relationship with the Mental World.

There was some very significant information in that last paragraph that you
can carry over into your world here in the physical, in regards to thought
power.  The Beings who live in  the Mental Realm first perceive the idea, then
they picture the idea, and then they give the  idea form and send it into the
physical world.  You do the very same thing all the time, but  without very
much effort or concentration.  You often get an idea of something that you
want, but that's usually where it all ends. You may think about it once in a
while and hope  you will get it, but only sporadically.  If you look at the
Mental Realm around you and  examine its properties and how it works, then you
will see why thoughts can have power.

In this material world of ours, if you want to create something you must use
some physical means to do so.  This means is usually by way of your hands.  In
the Mental Realm, your material, so to speak, that you create with is the
etherial Mental energies.  The tool with  which you create with is your
thought.  By applying a strong, concentrated, and  continuous thought directed
at the Mental energies, you can create a Thought Form.  That  is, your
thoughts take on a form imbued with the qualities of your thoughts.  If you
continue to add more thought power to this form, it will eventually
materialize into your  material world. Whatever the thought is programmed to
do, it will happen here on Earth.   So if you wanted a forty foot yacht, then
that is what would eventually come into your  possession.  If the thought was
that of a specific healing for someone, then the thought  would go forth and
heal.  Now, before you go and rush off and start wishing for this and  that,
let's look at a few more facts.

You just can't sit down and start wishing.  You do that all the time.  There
is a certain way  that this must be done.  Next, you must build-up your powers
of observation,  concentration, memory, and visualization.  The meditation
that you have been doing,  hopefully all along, is important too.  In topic
forty, you will learn how to create through  thought.  It may seem that you
are a long way from getting to topic forty, but please don't  jump the topics
in between this one and forty.  You will, first, have to develop those  powers
of the mind, through the exercises that follow shortly.  The exercises must be
practiced faithfully, and for as long as it takes to master them.  Further,
each topic that  follows, up to number forty, will further enhance your mental
abilities and prepare you for  topic forty.  Now, let's get to those
exercises.

Exercise #1, Observation.  There aren't too many who can at the end of the day
recall  what they did step-by-step.  Yet, this is part of your observation
training.  In the evening,  sit down and recall the day the best that you can.
At first, this may not be as easy as it  sounds.  Then, take this one stage
further, and at the end of the week, say on Saturday,  again sit down and
recall the entire week in as much detail as possible.  Visualize, or  picture,
the people you met, things that you did, and things said.  Another observation
exercise you can do is to enter a room quickly and, for say thirty seconds,
look around the  room and then shut your eyes and recall as many objects as
possible.  You can do this in  the outdoors, too.  For example, while walking
down the sidewalk, or in the park, observe  what's around you and then stop
and close your eyes and recall all the details of your  surroundings that you
have just passed.  If you will study these examples, then perhaps  you can go
on to create more observation exercise for yourself.

Exercise #2, Concentration.  To begin with, do some mental arithmetic.  On
your mental blackboard, begin by adding a row of numbers.  Write down the
numbers on a sheet of  paper and then close your eyes and see those numbers on
your board.  Then, add them  mentally, and when you have the answer write it
down and then do it on paper.  Next,  multiply some numbers and, also, do some
division.  At first, you will be able to use only  simple numbers, but as your
concentration develops, you will be able to do more and  more complicated
problems.  Another concentration exercise you might use is to  concentrate on
NOT thinking.  That's right!  You are going to get very quiet in your
Magician's Study, with the curtains drawn, and you are going to picture your
mental  blackboard and you are going to keep it blank.  You are going to cease
thinking of  anything.  Concentrate on doing this.  It is not easy, for
thoughts will do their best to creep  in, but you must concentrate and not
permit them to do so.  Do this for about ten minutes  to begin with, and then
gradually lengthen the time per sitting. Exercise #3, Memory.   Begin by
picking your favorite passage from a book or poet and selecting five or six
lines from it. Then memorize them.  Constantly create new memory  games that
will exercise your power of memory.  Acquire a booklet that gives you some
material to study, and provides you with a test that will see just how much
you have been  able to retain of the material. Make a list of ten people,
places, or things and then recall  them forward and backward.  Gradually
increase the number of items on your list.

Exercise #4, Visualization.  A phrase that you might select to mean the same
as the word visualization is, "to picture with the mind's eye".  You are going
to create an image of  something in your mind.  Begin this exercise by
thinking of someone you know and then  picturing what that person looks like.
Get this image in your mind's eye so real, that it  seems to be right there in
front of you.  An aid that you might use is to get a photograph of  the person
and then study it for a minute and then do your visualization.  Next, you
might  try, while walking down the sidewalk and coming towards someone, to
study their face  carefully and after they have passed you, recall their face
in your mind's eye.  Don't just  use people as subjects.  If you can think of
objects, or animals, that will be great, too.  But  when you visualize these
people, or whatever you choose, see them in clear detail and  always in color.
These are the four exercises that will set your feet definitely on the path
of acquiring mastery over your mind.  In all these exercises do them no more
then about  fifteen minutes each.  You should do them all, at least, once a
day. You might want to  separate them, doing some exercises during the day and
others when you are at home at  night.  Continue to practice these exercises
for the rest of your sojourn here on Earth.

Practice these with patience and determination and you will gain mental
mastery.  You  will be on your way to being able to have great success with
creative visualization.  An  important part of the Mental Realm involves the
Silent Magician who you'll meet next.

33.  Your Silent Magician 

You have just come from looking at your Mental Body and knowing that it is
your physical consciousness.  But actually, your Mental Body is much, much
more.  Your Mental Body  also contains that part of your consciousness which
is called the Subconscious Mind.   How much of your consciousness is composed
of the Subconscious?   Would you believe,  almost all of it? That's right!
You actually use only a very small fraction of your total  mental capacity.
What about geniuses, you ask?  They only use a part of a fraction more  then
do the rest of us.  To get some idea of how small your mental capacity is, in
relation  to the whole, let's first imagine a fifty-five gallon drum.

It's empty right now, but if you were going to fill it with water,
representing your physical consciousness, how much water would it take?  Well,
believe it or not, it would take only  about five gallons.  The rest of the
space comprises your Subconscious Mind.  As you can  see, your Subconscious is
a mental giant.  Just imagine what would happen if you could  tap into this
great source of mental power.  You are going to learn to do this in just a
little  while.  But first, you must become more familiar with the Subconscious
Mind and the role  it plays in your life.

You could actually name the Subconscious Mind, your "Silent Witness".  For
indeed, that  is what your Subconscious does.  It witnesses all that you do.
It is able to remember all  that you have ever done in this lifetime and
what's more, it contains the memories from all  your lives here on Earth and
sojourns in the otherworlds.  Why can't you remember them  then?

This is because there is an energy screen between yourself and the
Subconscious.  This  screen is there for several reasons. First, this screen
prevents you from tampering with the Subconscious Mind.  For most people
memories of past lives should remain off limits. Therefore, you have this
screen which prevents you from directly learning what is stored  in your
Subconscious.  To know your past lives may seem, at first, important, but
really it's  not. What if in a past life you were a murderer or a robber?
Could you handle this  information? Some say, that they would like to search
into the Subconscious Mind and  know why they have returned to this world and
learn what it is they came here for.  But if  you find this out, and
concentrate so hard on accomplishing this one thing, that you might,
inadvertently, overlook something else which will cause you to have to come
back down  here.  Actually, knowing your past lives, and why you came down
here, is really  unnecessary.  What's really important is that you live this
life to your very best.  That  each, and every day, you do the very best that
you can and give life your very best effort.   If you do this, then when you
reach the other side you can say, you did your very best, and  that is all
anyone can ask.

Second, unlike your physical consciousness, your Subconscious hasn't the
ability to discriminate between Truth and untruth. The Subconscious simply
takes all information given to it by the physical consciousness and records
it.  The energy screen allows you  time to hash over a problem, discerning
what's right and what's wrong, and when you  have come up with the right
answer, or what seems right to you, your Subconscious then  incorporates that
into its storage banks.  The screen prevents data from leaving your  conscious
mind, too soon, and entering the Subconscious. So, you know that your
Subconscious Mind is the storage house for all that you have ever done.  You
also know  that it is not able to discern between Truth and untruth, but there
is more.  It will store  whatever you know to be Truth.  From this you can
determine that your Subconscious is  unable to reason, that is, unable to form
conclusions or make judgments.  The  Subconscious is not logical.  Yet, your
Subconscious Mind plays a big role in your life.   The biggest role it plays
is to function as a relay between you, the physical  consciousness, and your
Oversoul.

Your Oversoul receives information on your progress down here on Earth from
your Subconscious Mind and the Oversoul relays information and directives to
your  Subconscious, who then puts them into action in your life.  This is an
important aspect  which I will expand on a little later.  Your Subconscious
Mind is also in link with all other  Subconscious Minds. Your Subconscious
Mind is able to tap in with any other  Subconscious Mind, and they are able to
pool information.  So, if you were able to  communicate with your Subconscious
Mind directly, you would be able to find out from it  information about
anything that you needed to know.  Your Subconscious has direct links  with
both your Oversoul and with all other Subconscious Minds.  But communication
with  your Subconscious Mind is not an easy thing to do.

You can see by all the things your Subconscious Mind is involved in, that it
is a very busy entity.  Getting its attention is the task at hand.  What would
you do, if you were trying to  get the attention of your next-door neighbor
who is very busy in their house and who has  never been disturbed before?  You
would go next-door, and knock, and call out their  name, until someone
answered.  You are going to use a similar procedure with your  Subconscious
Mind.  First, before you start knocking on your Subconscious Mind's door,
your going to do a little visualization.

In your mind's eye, view a large room with storage files and computer data
banks and a  large control panel, and in charge of all this is your
Subconscious, your Silent Witness,  and who you will picture as your Silent
Night Magician.  You'll envision her/him dressed  as you are dressed during
your rituals in full Night Magick regalia.  It is here, in this room,  on the
Isle of your Silent Magician located in the Mental Realm, that you will go to
speak  with your Silent Magician.  Before you can communicate with Her or Him,
let's first look at  the language you must communicate in. There is a special
way that you must talk to your Silent Magician in order for Her/Him to
understand you correctly.  You know S/he can not reason nor is S/he able to be
logical.   S/he can not discern between Truth or untruth.  So the Silent
Magician takes everything  you say very literal.  So when you talk to your
Silent Magician, you must use the most  simple, direct, and plain language.
You do not want to say anything which has a double  meaning.  For example, if
you want to find out where your lost ring is, and you ask  Her/Him if S/he
knows if the ring is in the sink drain, the Silent Magician will answer, Yes!
Yes, S/he does know if it is there or not, but that doesn't mean it is there.
Ask Her/Him a  direct question, "Is the ring in the sink drain of the
kitchen?"  Now that you have the  preliminaries over with, its time for you to
get down to the actual business of communion  with your Silent Magician.

To begin with, go into your Magician's Study and lie down and relax.  Do some
Night  Breathing and get very comfortable.  Now, envision the control room in
your mind, where  your Silent Magician is located.  And once again, picture
your Silent Magician at work.   Now call out Her/His name.  What's Her/His
name?

You're going to have to give Her/Him a very personal name similar to the one
you  selected as your Night Name.  This is a name that only you will know.
You're not going to  tell anyone else the name of your Silent Magician.  Now,
picturing very strongly your  Magician at work, call out Her/His new name.  A
proper way of doing such would be to  say, "You who are my Subconscious Mind
and Silent Magician and Friend, I give you the  name of __________ ." Say this
at least three times.  Then go on to say to, "when I call  out your name you
will please listen to me.  I want you and me to be partners and friends  for
this will benefit both of us. I want you to help me in all that I do.  I want
this in all  sincerity and honesty." Say this also three times.  You must do
this three times a day.   You must grow use to saying and doing this and
thinking of your Subconscious as a friend  and ally. Know that when you have
the attention of your Subconscious Mind, that you are  without limitation.

The Silent Magician is all powerful and all knowing.  S/He can be a tremendous
ally.  For  now, this is all you should do.  Just get acquainted with your
Silent Magician and gain  Her/His trust.  You should always be truthful and
straightforward with your Silent Friend.   You, in your own right, are
mentally strong and you are only a small fraction of your full  potential.
Imagine what would be your mental ability and the power of your thoughts, if
you could increase them eleven fold.  This can be, if you will tie in with
your Silent  Magician.  Your ally on Earth.  As you have seen, your
Subconscious is unique.  Even  though S/he can not reason or be logical, S/he
can do all that you can do.  S/He can do all  you can do only eleven times
greater.  It is the seat of total memory.  By reaching  Her/Him, and
convincing Her/Him that you need Her/Him, S/he will release information to
you that you are unaware of, about yourself.  S/he can correct wrongs with you
such as,  habits that you would like to be rid of, and can increase such
things as your memory  retention if you will work with Her/Him.  You can also
go direct to your Oversoul by  gaining your Silent Magician's trust and aid.

The Subconscious will be glad to go direct to your Oversoul for you if S/he
truly sees the  need. You must convince Her/Him of your sincerity and
trustworthiness.  You will be  cooperating with your Silent Magician in the
use of self-hypnosis, the pendulum, crystal,  psychometry, and telepathy.  So
work hard on reaching your Silent Magician and  developing the close rapport
needed in your work as a Night Magician.  Your first joint  undertaking,
between you and your Silent Friend, is the practice of self- hypnosis.

34.  Hypnotism and Self 

In classical mythology, Hypnos was the god of sleep.  He was the brother of
Thanatos and  the son of Erebus and Nyx.  The word, hypnotism, is taken from
the greek word,  "hypnoein", which means, "to put to sleep".  So you can see
that hypnotism must have  something to do with sleep, right?  Actually, it
doesn't have anything to do with sleep,  except that when a person is in a
hypnotic state of consciousness, s/he may appear to be  sleeping. What then is
hypnosis?

In the state of hypnosis, you are extremely vulnerable to suggestions.  For
example, if you  are told that when you put your hand in a vat of water and
will feel a pleasant warmth,  then this will be so.  Even if the water in the
tub is very, very cold. That doesn't mean that  your hand won't be cold, but
as far as your physical consciousness is concerned, the  hand feels warmth
from the cold water.  How can this be?  You're going to examine that  very
question in-depth and go on to learn some good uses for hypnotism and also the
dangers of hypnotism.  Lastly, you are going to learn how to induce
self-hypnosis and the  reasons for doing so.  First though, let's see how
hypnosis works.

To begin your investigation, you're going to examine the technique of a
hypnotist at work.   For in studying how a hypnotist works, you will be able
to gain an insight into how  hypnosis works.  The hypnotist first needs a
subject and that is going to be you.  The  hypnotist will then stand in front
of you and s/he will suspend some shiny object and ask  you to concentrate on
the object.  As you continue to concentrate, the hypnotist will begin  the
first of her/his suggestions to you; you are starting to feel drowsy.  Next,
s/he will tell  you that your eyelids are starting to feel heavy.  You can see
already that from just trying  to concentrate on the object that you will
start to feel eye fatigue.  And because your eyes  are starting to feel tired,
you already are beginning to trust the suggestions of the  hypnotist.  As the
process continues, you will start to fall into an altered state of  awareness.
When the hypnotist has you deeply relaxed, s/he will continue with further
suggestions.  For example, s/he will then ask you to raise your right arm
straight out in  front of you.  Then s/he will tell you that your arm is
starting to feel very heavy and that  you can hardly hold it up. Well, it's
obvious that the hypnotist is requesting you to do  things and then makes
suggestions which corresponds with what you are feeling.  But in  all of this,
there is a very real purpose, and that is for you to believe in the hypnotist.
You  are starting to trust the hypnotist and believe that whatever s/he tells
you is going to  occur.  But actually, there is much more to it then just your
outer conscious belief in the  hypnotist.

Here, you rejoin your new friend, the Silent Magician, for the explanation.
What the  hypnotist has been doing is breaching the energy screen that is
between you and your  Silent Friend.  The hypnotist has actually been working
on the Subconscious Mind with  her/his suggestions and gaining Her/His trust.
When the hypnotist has convinced the  Silent Magician that whatever s/he says
is going to happen, then you are truly hypnotised.   You will remember from
the last topic, that your Subconscious is unable to discern  between the Truth
and untruth.  They are not able to reason.  So as you, the physical
consciousness, trusted the hypnotist and began to believe in her/him, so the
Subconscious Mind will too.  The hypnotist, in convincing you with her/his
simple  suggestions has caused you to lower the energy screen between you and
your Subconscious.  Once this screen was lowered, the hypnotist is directly
working with your Subconscious Mind. All that s/he now tells you, your Silent
Magician will believe and comply with.  If s/he tells you when you look at an
object, that you will not be able to see it, then to your physical
consciousness, the object will not be there.  This is hypnosis.   Hypnosis can
be a real benefit to humankind, but it can also be a real danger.  There  have
been some valuable uses for hypnosis in today's society.  Medically they have
used  hypnosis in some cases as a substitute for anesthetic.  Thereby
eliminating the dangers  of having to anesthetize someone.  The police have
used it to hypnotize a crime victim, or  witness, in order to draw out of the
Subconscious Mind greater details of a crime, and so,  possibly leading to the
capture of the criminals.  These are some very positive uses for  hypnosis.
Hypnosis can be a very dangerous subject.  You should under no circumstances
allow  yourself to be placed under hypnosis by someone you do not fully trust.
Nor should you  undergo hypnosis for fun and games.  Hypnosis is a serious
business.  When you  undergo hypnosis, you surrender your Subconscious Mind,
out of the Hands of your  Oversoul, and into the hands of the hypnotist. As
you can see, this can lead to some  serious consequences for you, if you are
in the wrong hands.  Let your imagination  conjure up the harm that can be
done to you by the hypnotist.  So let this be warning  enough, DO NOT BE
HYPNOTIZED, unless you are absolutely sure of the hypnotist and  why you are
being hypnotized.  How can you get around the hypnotist?

You can circumvent her/him by using self-hypnosis.  You are going to be the
hypnotist.   For sure, I can think of no better hypnotist then you, once you
are properly trained.  There  are many reasons why you might want to use
self-hypnosis.  If you have ever wanted to  stop smoking; to improve your
memory; to stop a bad habit; to develop particular traits  within yourself,
for example, patience and calmness; then you will want to try self-  hypnosis.
For some, a big reason would be to lose weight.  The possibilities are
endless.   When you tell your Silent Magician, in self-hypnosis, what you
want, then you will see it  occur in yourself.  But be sure, if you are trying
to give up something, that you truly want  to give it up.  Otherwise you won't
be able to do it.  As you begin to learn the techniques  for self-hypnosis,
you should be in reasonably good health.  If you are in good health,  then
let's begin. You will practice this in your Magician's Study insuring that the
room is free from  intrusion by others and without drafts.  The room should be
reasonably dark.  Once all  your room preparations have been made, then you
should lay down on something  comfortable.  Now you are going to practice the
complete body relaxation that you  practiced in preparation for Night
Projection.  If you go through the same motions that you  did in that topic,
then you will have achieved the proper state of relaxation.  To quickly
recount what you did; you began thinking of your toes and erasing all tension
in them.   Then you went up the leg and did this for both legs.  You worked on
every part of your  body achieving the fullest relaxation possible.  This is
what you want here.  Now, practice  some Night Breathing and deepen the
relaxation.  While you are breathing, just let your  thoughts float on your
breath.  The key is to relax deeply.  Now to contact your Silent  Magician.

Pull your thoughts together and concentrate your gaze upon a point somewhere
on the  ceiling above you.  This point should be at such an angle that it
causes slight eye strain.   Now, as you continue to stare, you will begin to
feel eye strain.  When you can feel this,  you should then tell yourself,
aloud, that when you count beginning from ten and reach  one, you are going to
close your eyes and be unable to open them.  So let's do it.

"I am going to count from ten to one and when I reach one my eyes will close
because  they have become very tired.  Ten, my eyes are starting to feel
tired; nine, my eyes are  becoming much more tired and I am beginning to feel
like closing them; eight, my eyes  are starting to become very tired;
seven-six, my eyelids are becoming very heavy; five-four, my eyes are so tired
that I have to close them; three, I can no longer keep my eyes  open and feel
a real need to close them; two, my eyes are so tired they will no longer stay
open; one, my eyes have shut."

Your eyes should shut automatically, even if your eyes should not close do not
worry.  Go  ahead and close them anyway for what you are doing is setting up
an automatic reaction,  within yourself, when you do this.  Now that you have
your eyes closed, let's continue with  self- hypnosis.

You are going to visualize your Silent Magician and you are going to say
outloud the  following:

"I am going to count from ten to one and when I reach one I'm going to be in a
deep state  of self- hypnosis.  I'm going to be alert and fully conscious and
my Friend is going to  respond to all I say to her/him and comply with my
desires.  Ten, I am becoming very  relaxed and my body is starting to feel
very heavy; nine, my body is feeling heavy and my  spirit is lightly floating
within my body; eight-seven, I am becoming deeply relaxed and  slowly entering
into trance; six-five, I am now in trance yet alert and fully conscious;
four-three, I am going deeper and deeper into trance; two, I am reaching the
deepest state of  trance every before achieved; one, I am completely in trance
yet fully alert and conscious.   State name of your Silent Magician please
listen to me and do what I ask for."

Now is the time to make known to your Silent Friend all that you want her/him
to do.  Let's give Her/Him, though, only one thing per session.  You are going
to practice the entire technique, as outlined previously, for the first few
times, until you can do it correctly and easily.  Then you will condense the
relaxation and self-hypnosis state into one happening.

You are going to say to yourself that when you count to one, you are going to
achieve a  complete state of relaxation and self-hypnosis.  That you are going
to be fully alert and  know what's going on and that you are going to be able
to direct your Silent Witness to do  as you ask.  The relaxation and
self-hypnosis state should come easily, for it should now  have become an
automatic reaction.  Do not have any fear of coming out of this state of
self-hypnosis for it will happen automatically. Through self-hypnosis you can
correct faults  within yourself, or implant qualities that you would like to
acquire.  Through regular  practice you can achieve this.  This is serious
business and should be approached as  such.  Self-hypnosis will achieve for
you all that you desire, and you know that you're in  safe hands, your own!
Your Silent Magician will also be your partner and friend in your  use of the
Night Magician's Pendulum.

35.  A Night Magician's Pendulum 

On a dark green hill, encircled by gardens of flowers, immense old trees,
fountains, and  set against a starlit night sky we find the cave entrance to
the cavern home of the Night  Magician. A home dedicated to the ancient
practice and knowledge of Night Magick.  A  home that is as ageless as the
stars that it is dedicated to.  As we enter this beautiful  home, through its
ancient portal, we can see into the Magician's Study and find the  Ancient
One, busy in observation of the stars through a cavern window.  We continue to
enter, very quietly so as not to disturb the Old One, when suddenly we are
startled by the  resounding chimes of a huge grandfather clock, in its act of
proclaiming the hour of the  night.  The most striking thing about the clock
is its beautiful, ornate brass pendulum.   The pendulum swings side-to-side
ticking away the hours. We all know that the pendulum  is set so that time is
measured out with the greatest of accuracy. But the pendulum is not  just for
telling time.  The pendulum is also a valuable tool for the Night Magician.
So let's  leave the Old One and move to your Magician's Study to take up the
study of the Night  Magician's Pendulum.

Your pendulum is not going to be as ornate and beautiful as the one you just
observed at  the Magician's home, but it is based upon the same principle.
The pendulum is made up  of a long arm with a weight suspended on the end.
The pendulum you will use is simple  to make.  You will want to construct at
least two pendulums.

One will require a string at least forty-eight inches long, and the other
about twelve inches long.  A strong sewing thread will serve very well as the
material from which to make the string. The weight you use can be made of a
variety of things.  The weight can be made of  a round ball, about one inch in
diameter, and constructed of wood, plastic, glass, or a  neutral metal.  You
should have pendulums on hand made up of a variety of the materials  just
listed. You can also use a simple ring as a weight.  Another very simple
weight you  can construct will require an unused pencil and sewing needle.
Put the point of the  needle through the top of the eraser, so that the needle
will remain attached to the pencil.   Then, put the thread through the eye of
the needle and tie it off, and so, you have the  complete pendulum.  Once you
have made, or acquired, your pendulums, what are you  going to use them for?

Your pendulum will answer questions that range across the entire spectrum of
your imagination.  Have you lost a ring and want to find it?  You could find
missing people or a  lost pet.  The pendulum can answer questions you have
concerning most any topic that  you wish to pursue.  But how can it do this?

For part of the answer you must look to your old friend, the Silent Magician.
The  pendulum is an instrument, used by the Silent Magician, to give you the
answers to the  questions that you put to Her/Him.  In review, you will
remember that your Silent Friend is  very brilliant and there is very little
that s/he does not know, or cannot find out, since They  are in direct contact
with all other Silent Magicians.  You will remember that your entire  body has
an electrical field which completely surrounds it.  When you have the pendulum
suspended from your hand and ask your Magician a question, s/he alters the
electrical  field of your body.  That field also surrounds the pendulum and
causes it to move.  The  pendulum's movement has been set in a certain pattern
to indicate Yes or No.  The Silent  Magician is not the only one who can alter
the movement of the pendulum.  Any resident  of the higher realms can also
alter your electrical field, and so the movement of the  pendulum, if they
know how.  As a rule, the entity working with you, and through the  pendulum,
requires some time before they really can manipulate the pendulum well.  So
not only can you receive information from your Silent Magician but also your
Guides and  Teacher.  Before studying the mechanics of how to use the
pendulum, you must prepare  yourself to use the pendulum.

The how-to of self-preparation is relatively simple to state, but often hard
to achieve.  You begin by being sure your hands and body are clean, otherwise
this will interfere with your  body electricity.  You must have a calm and
receptive mind.  Your mind must be in a  relaxed state and without nervous
tension and fears. Your mind must be prepared to  concentrate on only one
thing, and that is what you are trying to answer.  Your mental  attitude must
be a serious one when you approach this lore.  If you have achieved this
self-preparation in mind and body, then you're ready to begin learning how to
use your  Magician's Pendulum.

First, you will prepare your Magician's Study for the use of the pendulum.  Be
sure the  room will be free from interruptions. Then erect a table to work on
that is made up of only  a hard top surface and four legs.  Nothing should be
under the table for this will interfere  with the reception of the proper
answer.  In all cases, you will want to have blank, clean,  unused, white
sheets of paper.

The standard, eleven by eight white typing paper will be fine. This is the
paper over which  you are going to suspend your pendulum.  On the paper, you
are going to draw in the  center a large plus sign(+).  At the top and bottom
of the paper, you are going to write the  word, YES.  On the right and left
sides of the paper, you are going to write the word, NO.   You will use a new
sheet marked in this way for each set of questions asked pertaining to  a
certain area of examination.  Please be sure and use a fresh sheet for each
set of  questions asked, for when questions are asked, the paper becomes
saturated with the  impressions from those questions, and these impressions
will interfere with any other set  of questions asked.  To begin, you must
formulate the questions you are going to ask.

For example, where is my lost gold ring?  The question must be simple, clear,
concise,  and unambiguous.  Then you must invoke the Night Pillar around
yourself and your  Magician's Study or the place you're working in.  If you
don't do this, then any force may  use the pendulum and cause misleading
answers.  After this, you'll take the short stringed  pendulum, between your
hands, and concentrate on the Night Force around you.  Then  ask the question
three times.  Then, take the string of the pendulum and wrap it around  the
first or second finger of the right hand, if you are right handed; left hand
if you are left  handed, such that when you rest your elbow on the table, the
weight of the pendulum is  about an inch above the paper and suspended over
the plus sign. Then, begin asking if  the ring is in the kitchen sink, and so
on. You can tell when the pendulum is answering  you, because it will swing
with purpose.  Be sure and wait between each question, till the  pendulum
answers.  If the pendulum makes a circling motion, this indicates uncertainty.
Either the force guiding the pendulum doesn't know, the question is ambiguous,
or they  refuse to answer the question.  Try asking the question in a more
precise and clear way,  and if there is still uncertainty, go on to another
question.  If you ask a question that  involves a geographical answer, then
you will need a map.  If the search area involves a  large area, use a map of
small scale.  This is a map which covers a large area of land on  a small
amount of map area.  Then, when you have found a more precise location, use a
larger scale map to get a pinpoint location.  In order for you to use the map,
place it on  the left side, and the plus marked paper on the right.  Take the
pendulum over the map  area and ask it to reveal the location of what you're
looking for.  Then hold the pendulum  over the white sheet of paper as before,
and as you ask your question, you'll move your  left forefinger slowly over
the map area.  The pendulum will swing in the positive direction  when you
have reached the right area.  This completes the instruction on the use of the
pendulum, indoors.  It takes practice to gain mastery over the use of the
pendulum.  You  must be sure and use simple language and concentrate strongly
on the question you want  answered.  Perhaps you've seen, or even used, some
form of dowsing rod to locate water.

The dowsing rod works on the very same principles as the pendulum.  For
uniformity, and familiarity, you are going to use the pendulum outdoors in
locating not only water, if that  is what you want, but anything else you
desire.  For this method, you will now need your  longer stringed pendulum.
To start with, you must prepare the pendulum for your use.   Let's say you
want to find gold.  Then you will need to place in, or on the weight of the
pendulum, a sample of gold.  This can be as small as a flake, but it must be
pure gold.   Further, you must put under your feet another piece of gold.  The
gold must be pure, so  for example, if you use your wedding ring be sure it is
solid, pure gold.  Then, with your  pendulum in the correct hand, you will
again ask your Silent Magician or Guides to find  gold for you.  Then, loosely
holding the string in the proper hand, slowly lower the weight  towards the
ground until it swings in a definite circular motion. You will need to
experiment with the proper length of string, until you get just the right
length which gives  you the best circular motion.  At this point, you should
mark the string with a knot, and  color code it, and record it for future
reference. You can apply this same technique to  anything that you want to
find.  You should take the time to prepare your pendulum for all  the things
that you will want to find.  In all that you do with the Night Magician's
Pendulum, you should remember certain key things in its proper use.

You should remember that in talking with your Silent Friend, you want to use
the simplest  and most direct language, and to repeat it at least three times.
You should always  remind your Friend that you need Her/Him, because what you
ask Her/Him to do for you,  S/he does for Her/Himself, too; that you are One
in Thought and Purpose.  So be sure,  that whatever you decide to do, that it
is in agreement with your inner beliefs.  If you try to  use it for something
you know to be wrong, then your Silent Friend will stop working with  you and
that will be the end of your growth. At the end of each set of questions, be
sure  and thank your Silent Magician for the aid that S/he has provided.
Appreciation and  respect, go a long way in your successful use of the Night
Magician's Pendulum.   Remember, that the pendulum is for your use alone.
Never allow anyone else to use or  touch your personal pendulum.  You can use
the pendulum to help others find answers to  their questions but they should
never use your pendulum to do so, you will use it for them.   Most of all, you
should go into this practice with the most serious of attitudes towards it.
Your frame of mind can mean the difference between success and failure.
Everything you  do to get closer with your Silent Magician, Guides, and
Teacher, and to make them your  unfailing allies in all that you do, will
bring mastery into your life here, and hereafter.  The  pendulum is the first
of your new Magician's Tools to be acquired in Air Magick, and now  you are to
acquire your second tool, the Night Magician's Crystal Globe. 36.  A Night
Magician's Crystal Globe

You will remember that when you were in the Night Magician's cave last, you
found the  Old One busily engaged in the observation of the stars.  Let's
return to the Magician's  cavern home and see if the Ancient One has begun
some new practice from which you  can observe and learn.

As you quietly enter the home, you have the feeling that you must go to the
study.  As you  move into the study, you find the Ancient One sitting on the
floor in an apparent state of  deep meditation.  You find that the room is
very dark and that it is taking your eyes some  time to adjust to the
darkness.  As you continue to observe the Magician, you suddenly  become aware
that more then just meditation is taking place.  You can now see that the
Wise One is gazing into a sphere of apparent nothingness.  To your vision,
there appears  to be a hole of darkness into which the Magician seems to be
gazing.  You move closer to  get a better view of what this phenomena is.  You
can now see that this sphere of  emptiness is composed of what appears to be a
clear substance. Suddenly, it dawns upon  you that you are observing the
Magician in the act of Crystal Gazing.  Now you know this  is what you are
going to learn to do.  Let's begin your instruction then with an in-depth
examination of the Crystal the Ancient One was using.

The Crystal is spherical in shape and was so clear that there appeared to be
nothing there  in the darkness.  Due to the clarity of the Crystal Globe, no
reflection of light could be  observed to give it depth.  The Crystal Globe,
that the Magician is using, is without flaw.  If  there were flaws in the
Crystal then what light was available would cast reflections off  these flaws
and disturb the Magician's gazing.  When the Magician gazes into the Crystal
Globe it is like looking into a deep globe of nothingness.  If you were to
visit a store in  order to purchase a Crystal Globe or even one of glass, you
would find that a perfectly  flawless one is very expensive.  So for your
purposes, you are going to use a crystal  hollow globe with a hole in the top.

I indicated you should use crystal but glass will also do.  The hollow globe
should be as  round as possible.  The surface of the globe should be without
flaws or markings.  The  globe should be about six inches in diameter.  A
similar globe is often sold as a fish bowl.   It should be able to sit on a
flat surface.  If you have now purchased this Crystal Globe,  then let's go on
to prepare the gazing area.

Arrange your Magician's Study so that you can be seated comfortably on the
floor, and in  front of you, you should have your small Night Altar of about
eighteen inches in height.   There should be no strain on the back or shoulder
muscles.  If there is then adjust the  height of the table.  It is not
absolutely necessary that you sit on the floor, for you can sit  in a chair as
long as you can see directly into the globe and it is within easy reach.
Cover  the table with a dark blue or black cloth. You must insure that almost
all light has been  eliminated from the room.

Be sure you are clean and have washed your hands before ever touching the
globe.  You  must clean the globe, without soap, before filling it with water.
Clean the globe under  running water and hold the globe with a cloth and dry
it before filling it.  Never allow  direct light to fall on the globe.  Keep
the globe in a safe place and wrapped in a dark  cloth.  Never allow the
curious to touch the globe.  After you have placed the globe on the  table
then fill it with water.  Fill it all the way to the rim so that the globe
appears to be  solid.  This takes care of your study preparation but you
mustn't forget self-preparation.

Be sure you are in good health.  Before you begin this exercise, you must be
in a good  mental state.  Your mind should be calm and as free from worry as
possible.  Be sure that  you have been eating sensibly and don't eat a big
meal just before commencing to use  the globe.  Now you are ready to begin
using the Crystal Globe.

Be seated comfortably and place the Night Pillar around you.  You must
practice Night Breathing for a few minutes in order to become more relaxed.
Then place your hands on  the bottom sides of the globe.  Your hands should be
in direct contact with the glass.   Gaze lightly upon the globe.  Do not begin
with a fixed and concentrated gaze.  Look at a  point somewhere inside the
globe and relax.  Do not try to see anything.  As you continue  to gaze, you
will see the globe start to cloud up with a whitish appearance.  This is
excellent and exactly what you want. You should continue to gaze, and the
cloudiness  will disappear, and you will begin to see.  You may even feel a
slight falling sensation so  don't be startled, or you will have to try
another evening, which by the way is the best time  to practice this. There
are three types of seeing that may occur.

You may actually see as if you were watching television.  That is, you may see
pictures  and events occurring.  Next, you may only see symbols.  These are
pictures which  represent events or happenings.  Finally, you may only receive
impressions.  You may  only receive feelings and thoughts as to what is trying
to be communicated to you.   Whatever you receive, through the use of the
Crystal Globe is a true achievement.  You  are successful, whether you see
pictures, symbols, or impressions.  In the beginning, you  may encounter some
difficulty in achieving any results.

You should only begin by gazing for about fifteen minutes at the most.  By the
end of the  week, you should have extended that time to about thirty minutes.
This is all that is  recommended when you are first beginning.  In the
beginning, you will see only things  that pertain to you alone.  As you begin
to see more clearly and easily, you should begin  to direct the Crystal in
what you want to see.  As you first touch the globe and relax,  concentrate a
mental thought at the Crystal and tell it what it is you want to see.
Eventually, you will gain control over the Crystal and be able to direct it at
whatever it is  you are interested in knowing.  You can also use the Crystal
Globe to give others a  reading.

To do this, you will go through the very same setup procedures. Then before
you actually  touch the globe, direct the individual who desires the reading,
to touch the globe and  concentrate on what s/he wants to know about.  You
should also warn them, in advance,  not to say anything that will disturb you
while you are gazing and giving her/him their  reading.  Then, you will take
over control of the Crystal and gaze upon it as you would for  yourself, and
give what you see.

In all cases, when you are through using the Crystal Globe, you will again
rinse the globe  and dry it off before putting it away. The Crystal Globe
works by focusing and concentrating the clairvoyant energies from your Night
Eye Center.  The Crystal Globe is an extension of your Night Eye.  The globe,
as  with your own personal clairvoyance, is able to do many things.

The globe can help you look into the past, present, and future. It can help
you look into  any matter which concerns you and to see all sides of the
matter under discernment.  You  can go anywhere at anytime and see all that
you wish to see.

You must know that you are going to succeed each time you use the Crystal.
Even if you  don't succeed, you must not become discouraged.  Every attempt at
using the Crystal  Globe leads you one step closer to success.  You should
have the attitude of a very  personal commitment to the Crystal Globe.  Always
treat it with the utmost respect.  The  entire business of crystal gazing is
very serious business and should be treated as such if  you are going to
succeed at it.  Your next subject is also a form of seeing.  Only instead of
using the eyes to see with, you are going to use your hands.

37.  Psychometry 

Psychometry is the development of your clairaudient faculties in relation to
your sense of touch.  By psychometry, you are going to be able to pickup an
object and know its origin  and history. If the object ever belonged to
someone, then you will receive the thoughts  and feelings of that individual.
Psychometry is related to your clairaudient faculties.  Let's  see how?

As you will recall, clairaudience is related to your fifth Night Center which
is located at the throat level.  As your Night Center begins to grow and
develop, you develop the sense, in  part, of being able to perceive sound from
the Night Realm.  You can hear in a sense, the  voice of the Night Spirit and
even the so called "Music of the Night Spheres".  All of this is  the
attunement to, and perception of, higher vibration.  An extension of your
clairaudient  ability is the perception of an object's vibration through
touch.  Your left hand, if you are  right handed, is the sensitive hand to
magickal vibration.  All things, of all types of nature,  have a personal
vibration.  That vibration is composed of the entire history and nature
peculiar to that object. Your clairaudient faculty is able to attune to that
vibration and  translate it into pictures, sounds, and/or feelings that you
can perceive.

Psychometry has many practical applications.  You can see actual history
taking place by using objects that are related to a particular historical
event.  But remember, you will see history as it related to that particular
object and its part in that history.  You can view the origin of the planet
through very ancient objects.  In a more practical application, you  could
pickup a book and get the basic feeling of that book and what it is about, and
then  decide if you are going to like reading it or not.  You can learn about
the inner nature of  individuals of interest to you by examining an object
which belongs to them. For example,  this could help you understand your
employer better; why s/he expects certain things from  you, her/his reasoning
behind certain acts, and overall, help you to improve your working
relationship with her/him.  The possibilities are as endless as your
imagination is fertile.   How do you go about developing your clairaudient
faculties in relation to psychometry?

To begin, let's look at the area of self-preparation.  You are going to see a
trend  developing through self-preparation.  As in the use of the Night
Magician's Pendulum and  Crystal Globe, you again need a clean body and hands,
and a sound and tranquil state of  mind.  In review, I stated in topic
thirty-two, "Power of Thought", that in all the exercises  used to strengthen
and train the mind, meditation was very important.  Hopefully, you can  see
the reason for this and have been practicing it.  Meditation builds for you a
tranquil  mind.  If you have not been doing it, regularly, then get to it
without fail.  If you expect to  achieve anything in the Night Magick, it must
be done through a strong and tranquil mind.   So much for self-preparation,
now on to the mechanics of psychometry.

Hopefully, you have someone who is very sympathetic towards your magick and
wishes to  see you succeed in it.  If so, get this person to pickup a smooth
stone, and take that stone  and wash it thoroughly, along with their hands.
Then holding the stone in her/his left  hand, allowing it to rest in their
open palm, ask them to concentrate on a single thought.   This thought should
be simple.  For example, thinking of the color red.  Have them  concentrate
for several minutes on this thought.  Then, s/he should wrap the stone in a
clean cloth and give it to you.  Then take the stone with you and retire to
your Magician's  Study. Now lie down, relax, place the Night Pillar around
you, do some Night Breathing, and  place the stone in your clean, left hand.
Let the stone rest in the palm of your open hand.   Now you must allow your
mind to be without thought and tranquil.  Do not try to  concentrate on the
stone. Just relax and allow your mind to drift on nothingness.  You  may or
may not feel a tingling in the palm of your hand.  What you should receive is
a  feeling or impression, in this case, the color red.  If not, then try
moving the stone to your  left temple and again relax.  If you do not receive
an impression do not be discouraged.  It  takes practice and perseverance to
succeed.  If you do not have someone who can help  you, then you can try
something else.  The next time you receive a letter or bill, before  you open
it, retire to your room and go through the same procedures as just outlined
above with the stone.  As you receive the impressions, record them and then
open the bill  or letter and see if you're right.  Remember, that many people
will touch the letter or bill  before it gets to you, and so their impressions
will also be on it.  This is psychometry.

You will receive impressions, feelings, or pictures from objects you touch.
As your clairaudient faculties develop through practice, you will be able to
see easier and much  more extensively into the depths of an object's history.
Practice and perseverance is the  key to mastery.  Not only in psychometry,
but in all things as they relate to a Night  Magician's life. Your next
subject is something which has long been talked about, and  yet not
understood.  You are going to learn to bridge the gap between your mind and
another.

38.  Telepathy 

We have all heard the old phrase, "you must be reading my mind". The other
person  seemed to know your thoughts in some way.  This ability to know
another's thoughts is  telepathy. Telepathy is the ability to be able to
transmit and/or receive thoughts from one  person to another.  You are going
to learn how to do this and some of the possible uses,  but first, you should
learn how telepathy works.

In order to understand how telepathy works, you need to go back and re-examine
the  workings of the brain.  The brain is an extraordinarily complex organ,
and its physical  workings are little understood.  What is known about it, and
the key to understanding how  telepathy works, is that in the brain's
functioning it generates electricity.  This electricity is  very fine and can
be measured upon an electroencephalograph (EEG). Your brain emits  high
frequency waves upon which thought is carried.  Your brain operates upon a
certain  frequency which is unique for each individual.  When you can attune
yourself to that  frequency generated by the brain's electrical functioning
then you can intercept and  comprehend another's thought waves.  As a radio
can receive radio waves when tuned to  the proper frequency, so can your brain
receive thought waves from another person when  properly attuned to them.
Occasionally, a person is telepathic to another, unknowingly,  because each is
very close in frequency to the other.  They seem to be able to know what  the
other is thinking constantly, and this is because of the close harmony between
their  personal frequencies.  Couples who have been married for sometime grow
close in  harmony and each becomes attuned to the other's thoughts.   You are
not limited, though,  to accidental telepathic reception.

You can learn to consciously tune in to anyone you desire. Thought wave
attunement is achieved through the opening of your crown Night Center.  Not
only are you able to tune  into other peoples' thoughts, but you are able to
begin receiving direct communication  with your Oversoul.  To begin this
awakening of your Crown Center, you must have begun  to reach some mastery
over the mental exercise in topic thirty-two.  You must be  achieving a strong
and tranquil mind.  If you are to practice telepathy, you are going to  need
someone who you can send thoughts to, and who will, in turn, transmit to you.
If you  have such a person, then at a certain designated time each of you is
going to retire to  your Magician's Study, dim the lights, and try to
eliminate all possible distractions.

One of you will have agreed, in advance, to be the transmitter and the other
the receiver. People generate thoughts constantly, but they do this in such a
scattered manner that the thought goes in all direction and carries little
effect.  You, though, are going to  concentrate and direct your thought
specifically at the receiver.  As the transmitter, you  will have prepared, in
advance, a simple message or symbol to transmit.  So lie down and  become very
relaxed.  You must place the Night Pillar around you and practice Night
Breathing for a few minutes.  You should have in your hand a picture of the
person you  are going to transmit to.  Spend a few moments thinking of this
person and all the things  that bring you both together.  Then for about five
to ten minutes, you will transmit the  message.  This completes the portion
for the transmitter.

As the receiver, you also will lie or sit down and become very relaxed.  Place
the Night  Pillar into action and practice Night Breathing for a few moments.
You will need a picture  of your transmitter and will be thinking of those
things that draw you together in harmony.   The you will allow your mind to
become still and without thought.  Just let go for about five  to ten minutes
and receive.  Sound easy?

It will become so if you practice and do not become easily discouraged.  After
you have completed this exercise, you will certainly want to call each other
and check the results.   Don't become upset, though, if it did not work.  Be
positive, know it works, and in a short  time, you will be able to do it, not
only with your friend, but with anyone you meet.  The  uses for telepathy are
numberless and important.

It would be great if you could transact business with another and know whether
you were getting a good deal or not.  You would always be able to stay in
touch with your friends  and know if there are ever any problems.  If you had
a friend who was ever in trouble or  danger, they could beam a thought to you,
for help, and you could go to them.  The  possible uses for telepathy are
endless.  Make the most of them.  As you continue to  develop your telepathic
abilities, and thus your seventh Night Center, the closer you will  become to
your Oversoul.

You have learned to use your mind for communication with other minds.  Next,
you will  learn to use your mind to travel in the Mental Realm.

39.  Mental Projection 

You will recall, in Night Projection, you traveled in the Astral Realm in your
Astral Body.   So you can conclude, in Mental Projection, you will travel in
the Mental Realm in your  Mental Body.  You can look upon Mental Projection as
the "flight of the mind".  It is with  your mind that you will see and visit
places, and find a universe open to your mental  explorations.  So let's begin
this topic with a short flight, and view one of the many places  that are open
before you.

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one...  and you have
lift-off.  You begin to climb through the sky, leaving the Earth far, far
behind, and enter the darkness of deep  space. You continue to travel at the
speed of thought passing by planets and stars in the  twinkle of an eye.  In
moments, you find yourself approaching the first planet in your  journey.  The
planet's side you approach is enveloped in the darkness of night. As you
approach it closer, you see, outlined in the light of a setting sun, a vast
beach and cliffs  upon which a great ocean touches, and whose waves gently
caress it.  Set in the side of  the cliffs is a great door which you know
leads to a vast city below the surface.  You,  mentally, beam a message asking
to enter, where upon the great door opens and you find  yourself moving
rapidly through a long, lighted tunnel. Inside, you find a great city
shrouded in the twilight of an artificial night. There are beautiful fountains
and statues  inside and buildings resembling those of Ancient Greece.  By some
unknown force, you  are now led away from this city beneath the surface and
find yourself leaving the planet  far behind, and once again, traveling
through space.  You soon approach your next  destination, which is a planet
that, at first, appears similar to the one you just left. As you  grow closer,
though, you see a culture much different then the last one.  Here, the culture
is very mechanized, and the citizenry live upon the surface.  The dwellings
are very rustic  and blend naturally with the bareness of the planet.  You
continue to watch with  fascination at the unique machinery and lifestyle of
the people.  You find, though, that you  are starting to grow weary and feel a
need to return to your origin.  So you return to your  body which you left far
behind on the planet Earth.  You think of your body, and its place  on Earth,
and the sensation of rapid movement, of flight, is upon you again.  Pinpoints
of  light and matter, again, whisk past you with incredible speed.  Then, you
feel the slowing  in movement, and the heaviness of your body, and ...Ten,
nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,  three, two, one.., you have arrived.  So
ends your short flight of the mind through time and  space.  Were you really
there?  Did you see the planets, buildings, and people?

The answer is a definite, Yes!  There is no place or time period that you
cannot visit in  Mind. You can visit anyplace on your planet or see anyone.
You can travel back into  time or go forward into the realm of possibilities.
As you have seen, you can travel to any  planet, of any star system, of any
galaxy.  You can even travel into the various planes of  the Magickal Realm.
The only restraints to your traveling is your own magickal  development.

Your own magickal development is the only limiting factor as to where you can
travel.   This applies to Night, as well as Mental Projection.  You are
allowed to see and visit  those things which have an equal or lower vibration
to your own.  For example, each  planet, in the universe, has a unique
magickal vibration.  In order for you to see and visit a  planet, your own
vibration must be equal or higher to it.  Otherwise, you will be prevented
from going there. Similarly, for you to visit a magickal level or plane, you
must have an  equal or higher vibration in relation to it.  Of course, the
solution to unlimited travel is a  personal magickal vibration that allows you
to go anywhere.  Although there will always  be magickal plateaus that you
must strive for, you can develop magickally so that you are  relatively
unrestricted in your magickal travels.  How do you develop magickally?

The answer has been before you all along.  You must follow the instruction
outlined in  this book.  If you follow these instructions, live by the Will of
your Oversoul within you,  then your magickal growth will be both rapid and
unending.  Being Magickal is not being  able to read minds or see in the Night
Magician's Crystal Globe, but is based on living as  the Oversoul on Earth.
Telepathy, crystal gazing, and all that you are studying, is  developing
within you the necessary physical, emotional, mental, and magickal discipline
that will aid you in living as the Oversoul on Earth.  This, brings true
magickal growth that  will be with you forever and ever.

To practice Mental Projection, you must be physically fit and mentally sound.
Your mind must be in a state of peace and relaxation.  Your mind must be free
of tension and  worries and your body should be in good health, especially
your heart.  You do not have  to wait for truly advance magickal growth in
order to start traveling mentally.  The only  thing, as said before, is that
your magickal development will limit those places that you  can visit.  As you
continue to travel and grow magickally so will the places that you can  visit
grow in clarity, beauty, and magick.  The "how-to" of Mental Projection is not
that  difficult. You must enter your Magician's Study and extinguish all light
in the room.  The room  should be in almost total darkness.  Then, you should
be seated or lying down in a very  comfortable and relaxed manner.  You must
place the Magician's Night Pillar around  yourself and begin Night Breathing.
You must achieve a very relaxed and calm state of  body and mind.  Once you
have reached this state, you are ready to take flight with your  mind. In
Mental Projection, unlike Night Projection, you are not going to project a
body in  which your consciousness is going to travel. In Mental Projection,
only your  consciousness is going to be projected forth. Remember, your Mental
Body is your  consciousness.  In Night Projection, you projected forth your
Astral Body from your  physical body, and in that Astral Body you placed your
consciousness.  In Mental  Projection, all visual and emotional sensation will
center around the forehead of your  physical body.  It is from here, that you
will project your formless Mental energies or  consciousness.

To start with, you must visualize in your mind the place, person, and/or thing
you wish to visit.  Once you have in mind where you want to travel to, then
you should imagine your  mind doing the traveling and actually going there.
See your formless Mental energies  going forth to discover and see in the
Mental Realm. You will feel your consciousness  starting to travel forth into
the Mental Realm.  You will have visual impressions of your  surroundings
passing you by, just as if you were traveling in an airplane, only much
faster.  Then you'll begin to truly see your destination.

In the beginning, your visual images may be hazy and faint.  But as you
practice, the  images will become clearer and take on color.  While Mental
Projecting, if you want to go  somewhere else then where you're currently
visiting, all you have to do is concentrate on  the place you want to be, and
with the speed of thought you will be there.  Where your  thoughts are, there
you will be too.  In no way, should you force Mental Projection.   When you
project, it must be from the area of the forehead.  If you feel a swaying
sensation from your entire body, then you are starting to project the Astral
Body, rather  then the Mental Body. Your conscious projection of the Mental
Body must be from the  forehead.  You must center your conscious efforts to
project from the area of the head.   You should definitely know that it is
your mind body that you do travel and see through.   You are actually present
in your Mental Body and can send magickal healing and power  through it to any
person, place, or thing as you feel the need.  When you are ready to  return,
you should do so slowly and easily.  You should see yourself returning the
same way you went. As you begin to feel your physical body again, for while in
traveling you will forget it, move  the fingers and hands slowly. Next, you
will concentrate on your breathing, and you will  find the need to take a deep
breath, for while traveling, your breathing has become very  slow and shallow.
In all, return very slowly and you will prevent any harm to yourself, for
returning too quickly can cause headaches and an "out-of-sorts" feeling.
Mind Traveling is your key to unlimited new discoveries in life. You can visit
and stay in  touch with friends and love ones far away.  You can see cities,
great libraries, countries,  and places untold.  You can go into space and
discover new worlds and civilizations.   Your past and future are open to your
exploration. You can even explore the Magickal  Realms and see the Magickal
Leaders and Teachers of the world.  At first, go easy in  learning to use your
mind to travel with.  You must practice and be patient and the results  are
assured.  Remember, Mental Projection is your means to worlds untold; the
passport  is your own magickal development.  You have finally reached the
topic that you waited so  patiently for.  So without further delay, let's
learn how to create the world around and  within you that you desire to have.

40.  Creative Visualization 

The Magick of Creative Visualization is awesome.  There is absolutely nothing
you cannot create into your world through Creative Visualization.  There are
examples of people who  used the power of Creative Visualization throughout
history.  Look at the lives of Albert  Einstein, Thomas Edison, and Leonardo
Da Vinci.  Look at the lives of Mozart, Beethoven,  and Wagner. In all these
lives and thousands more like them, they used their minds and  a vision they
held in their minds and created and changed the world.  They created
intuitively.  You too can become like them by knowing how its done and then
using it.  The  whole process is known as Creative Visualization.

Through this process, you will be able to create for yourself and others
anything that you desire.  Remember always to create within the laws of the
Eternal Night Balance and the  Silver Rule. As long as you follow these two
principles there is absolutely nothing you  cannot create into your world
through Creative Visualization.  The process of Creative  Visualization is
broken down into two basic parts, a.) Imagination and b.) Invocation. The
process ends with the final results of c.) Materialization. So without further
delay, let's  begin with imagination.

a.  Imagination

Imagination is a product of your mind.  It is the ability of your mind to be
able to visualize, picture, envision, or imagine situations and things.  As a
kid, you used your imagination in playing house.  You imagined yourself as
either the father or mother and your toy dolls as  your children.  Your house
was a big box that you got from the local appliance dealer that  once
contained a refrigerator or stove.  Or remember the time you laid down on the
soft,  cool, green grass and looked up at the big, fluffy, white clouds on a
warm summer day  and imagined what this cloud or that looked like.  Some
looked like big elephants or dogs  and others looked like planes.  Remember?
This is your imagination at work.

As an adult, you constantly use your imagination to imagine what an interview
is going to  be like with the new boss, or what an appointment with the
dentist is going to feel like.  If  you have a birthday coming up, you try to
imagine what gifts are going to be given to you  and who will send cards.  You
constantly employ your imagination in your life.  Your  imagination is a very
powerful force in your life.  In fact, your imagination is the most  powerful
force in your life today.  Disagree?

Well if you do, then let's look at some examples.  Many will say that your
will is the  strongest force in your life but this can be easily disproved.
In any contest between the  will and the imagination, the imagination always
wins.  For example, let's take a catwalk  high above the factory floor.  The
catwalk is only two feet wide and there are guard rails at  waist height
running the fifty foot length.  Can you cross it in safety and ease? Sure, for
you have the added safety measure of the guard rails. Now, let's take away the
guard  rails.  Has your ease in crossing changed any?  The catwalk is still
quite wide enough to  cross with ease but when you take away the guard rails,
your imagination starts to go to  work.  You look at the long drop below and
without the rails, you start to imagine what  would happen if you slip.  It
will be hard to convince your imagination that you can cross  without any
danger.  You find that you are truly scared at walking on a two-foot wide
catwalk suspended one hundred feet in the air.  If you attempt to force your
will over your  self, this will only create more tension, and begin to cause
your body to shake and sweat  to appear on your forehead, and you will be
totally unable to cross.  Your imagination  wins.  Another example of how your
imagination has been used as a powerful force in  your life is the fear that
many people have of a place called Hell.

Churches have long used the idea of Hell to keep people in line. In your
imagination, you believe that if you are not good and do exactly what the
church says, you will pay for it by  going to a very, very hot, sulfurous,
brimstone place, and there suffer eternal torment.  If  you truly believe this
and have convinced your imagination of this, then you will not do  any wrong
if possible.  Your imagination is even stronger then the sexual forces in your
life.

It is in your imagination that a particular type of man or woman is attractive
to you. Imagination must come first before the sexual forces can be activated.
So, your  imagination is dominant even over your love life.  As you have just
seen in these  examples presented here, and many more that come to mind, the
imagination is a very  powerful force.  Whatever you imagine to be true in
your life, your imagination will insure  that it is so in your life.  If you
feel that an unsupported walk will be very dangerous, then  your imagination
will conjure up the most dismal of pictures in your mind's eye, of you  lying
broken up on the floor far, far below. The idea, then, is to learn to use your
imagination constructively.  You must learn how to manipulate your imagination
to  achieve materialization.  With your imagination, you are going to learn to
imagine  whatever it is that you desire to happen.

To begin with, you should have by this time become quite proficient at
visualization.  The hows of this was discussed in topic thirty-two, exercise
four.  If you haven't been doing  this exercise, then refer back to it and
begin doing so at once until proficiency is obtained. Whatever it is that you
want to happen, you must first be able to visualize it.  Once you  have
visualized it clearly in your mind's eye, then you must continue to add to the
visualization using your imagination and give it substance. Let's begin with
an easy  example.

You want to create an apple.  First, you would have already visualized the
apple itself.   You have pictured, in your mind, a bright, beautiful apple.
Then with your imagination,  you will continue to add substance to it by
adding the color to its skin. Now, you have a  bright, beautiful, red apple.
Then you will, in your imagination, see the insides of the  apple, and how
beautifully yellow they are.  Then, go on remembering how delicious and  sweet
they taste, and even how fragrant it smells. In your imagination, hold this
total  picture of a bright, red, yellowish insides, sweet tasting and smelling
apple.  This is how  you will use your imagination in Creative Visualization.
But you don't have the apple yet,  do you?  You need something more then just
your imagination alone.  You need the  added ingredient of Invocation.

b.  Invocation 

You are probably asking yourself what I mean by Invocation.  The very meaning
of the  word tells you what is required next. Invocation is the act of calling
upon a deity or higher  power for aid in accomplishing something.  In Night
Magick you are going to invoke the  aid of your Oversoul to complete the act
of Creative Visualization.  It is your Oversoul who  answers your invocation.
The Oversoul places into your world those things you desire to  see in it.
There are no limitations placed upon what invocation can do when combined
with visualization and imagination.  None! How do you invoke so that your
Oversoul will  answer with action? First, you must have the attention of your
Oversoul.  If you have been practicing meditation with dedication and
sincerity, then you will have been slowly opening the Crown Night  Center or
your Portal to your Oversoul.  In your practice of meditation and Night Magick
overall, you have been practicing a way of life that raises your magickal
vibration and that  of your Oversoul, too. When you dedicate yourself to this
magickal way of life, your  Oversoul then becomes directly involved in your
magickal growth. So, since you have  been practicing meditation all along, you
know that your Oversoul is listening.  To begin  your invocation then, you
must establish that communications link with your Oversoul.  You can do this
standing, sitting, or lying down, whichever you are most comfortable with.
Then, you will put the Night Pillar around yourself.  You will need to use
your imagination  and see yourself as the Living Oversoul.  Envision yourself
dressed in a seamless, black  garment glowing in intense magickal radiation.
You must see yourself as you would  imagine your Oversoul must seem in Its
Realm. That is, as an embodiment of Power and  Glory unknown on Earth.  You
must go beyond just imagining yourself as the Oversoul on  Earth.  You must
know that you are the Oversoul. That if you raise your vibration high  enough,
and know that you are the Oversoul, then your Oversoul will join you on Earth
and  will work with, and through you.  At this point, you will start to feel
an increase in heart  rate and exhilaration unknown to you before.  Through
this, you will know your Oversoul is  listening and is with you.  Even if you
don't feel this exhilaration, be assured, that your  Oversoul is with you.
Then you can say your invocation to your Oversoul. There is a  certain way
that the invocation should he said.  This is not like a typical prayer that
you  have been taught how to say.  Your invocation is more a command and
affirmation.  The invocation should be based on the following example:
"Darkest Oversoul which I AM, send your Yin Light and Energy through me.  For
I AM the Oversoul in Action here on Earth and  live by Your Will alone.  I AM
commanding as Oversoul in Action here on Earth that your  request be done.  By
the Oversoul's Will let it be done.  So be it."  You should repeat this
invocation three times.  If you do this with all sincerity and knowing that it
will be done,  then it will be done. The result of this invocation and your
use of imagination is defined as  Materialization.

c.  Materialization 

What is materialization?  Materialization is the bringing forth into material
or physical existence your desires.  This is the ultimate goal of Creative
Visualization.  You want to  bring into the material world your ideals.  Can
you achieve this materialization through  invocation alone?  No, you must have
the combination of imagination and invocation  together.  One question that
may come to your mind is where the apple, or anything that  you are trying to
create, materializing from?

When I speak of using your imagination to form the image of what it is you
want, you are  also using concentrated thought.  You are building this image
first on the Mental Realm.   As you continue the imaginative process, you
continue to fill the image with your emotions  or feelings about what it is
and like to have.  Thus, you continue to build it, and so, lower  it into the
Astral Realm. The object is actually materializing on both the Mental and
Astral  planes.  Then, you employ your power of invocation, building or
materializing it on both  the Magickal and the Etheric planes.  In the
materialization of objects, this form, made up  of condensed energy, will
create the necessary events in order to manifest into your or  another's
world, depending on what it is you are trying to achieve.  If you are of
advanced  magickal development, with a need of the object immediately, then
physical matter will  start to form around the energy form until you have the
final material product.  With your  imagination and invocation, you are
programming the energy form to materialize. The  energy form will do whatever
is necessary to bring about the creation.  Let's return beck to  the apple you
were trying to materialize, and see the whole process through.

Remember, you were imagining a bright, red, yellowish insides, sweet tasting
and  smelling apple.  You had used your imagination to such a point that you
could almost  smell and taste that apple. At that moment, you would go on to
use invocation.  You now  see yourself as the Oversoul on Earth.  You truly
feel Its Power and Energy descend upon  you and know that you are One.  Now,
you would insert in your invocation the image of  your apple.  From this, you
would have your apple.  Is the apple going to be right there in  front of you,
after you do all of this? That depends on you and your magickal development.
If you have reached the state of  Night Consciousness, then YES, the apple
will be there in front of you.  For in Night  Consciousness, you and the
Oversoul are One.  There is perfect communion and  cooperation in all things.
In lesser magickal development, the apple would have been  there, but only as
low as the etherial state.  But, what is in the etherial state of
materialization will eventually have its material existence fulfilled.
Somehow, and  eventually, that bright, red apple will come into your life.
Food is not the only thing that  you can materialize.

There is no limit on the physical objects that you can materialize into your
life, but more importantly, there is no limit to the physical happenings that
you can cause to exist.  By physical happenings, I am referring to events or
changes to occur in your or another's life.   For example, you may want to
become more like one of the Night Teachers.  You would,  then, first activate
your imagination and begin to build the image of the Teacher you  would like
to become more like.  Think of all the qualities and attributes held by that
Teacher.  What they look like? What mannerisms?  Build the image very strong
and then  you will slowly start to see yourself taking on these magickal
qualities.  You should then  bring in your invocation. You will ask your
Oversoul to build within you, the qualities  found in the Teacher.  You should
then continue this visualization over a long period of  time.  In other words,
you must practice this visualization process many times, over a long  period
of time, in order to become fully like the Teacher.  There is no way of
knowing how  long it will take to acquire these qualities.  But as each day
goes by, you will become  more and more like your Night Teacher.  The change
will hardly be perceptible to you, but  change you will.  You can help build
these qualities into other people.  You can  materialize in anyone, anything,
through your imagination and invocation. Through  Creative Visualization, you
could achieve unlimited supply of the things you need on Earth  and the Soul
qualities you need in life to reach Night Consciousness.  You have traveled to
the end of your journey in Air Magick.

You began it, by visiting the dimension where the Great Ones live and bring
into mental creation, what will soon thereafter become a physical discovery
and invention.  You have  long been convinced, by now, of the great power of
your thoughts, and the even greater  power of your Friend, the Silent
Magician.  You have learned to bring improvements into  your life through
self- hypnosis.  You have acquired new Night Magician Tools such as the
Pendulum and Crystal Globe.  You have learned to travel to anywhere, at
anytime,  through Mental Projection, and to invoke or communicate with your
Oversoul.  Best of all,  you have learned to control the world around you and
create as the Oversoul through  Creative Visualization.  You have come a long
way on the road of Night Magick, but the  road stretches out before you a bit
farther.  You find yourself journeying on the last part of  the Night Road and
entering the Night Realm.

CHAPTER  VII


Night (Fire) Magick

41.  The Night (Fire) Realm

Fire was the fourth element held sacred by the Ancient Magicians. Fire
represents a  Magickal Energy that transforms the lower nature into the
Magickal.  It was used in  Magickal Alchemy to represent the transmuting agent
necessary to change ordinary  metals or souls, into silver or the Oversoul.
It is symbolic of the Oversoul and the Night  Forces, pouring forth into the
life of the Night Magician, changing the base elements into  the Silver of the
Oversoul.  This is the final realm into which you will enter for exploration.
It is the Realm of Magickal and Celestial Energies.  In this topic, you will
explore the  Night Realm, as the Land of the Perfected Night Magician.  You
will learn of the different  vibrational levels of the Night Realm.  You will,
then, enter the Inner Night Realm found  within you; and the purpose of this
chapter on Night Magick.  If you are ready, let's  discover the Night Realm.

This is a realm, that for many, even a glimpse of it is still far down the
road.  It is a realm  of pure Night Power and Energy.  It is a Realm of Pure
Night.  The beauty of this realm,  words can not describe.  I made an attempt
earlier in the book to describe this realm, and  could not even come close in
describing the Power and Energy found in this world.  If, in  your highest
magickal imagination, you could envision a Magickal Realm of dazzling,
silver, violet, and dark light, that fills every part of your being with a
warmth and power  beyond description, then you would have some idea of the
Night Realm.  If you could  imagine a power that flows through you, giving to
you knowledge and wisdom beyond  anything you know; to know yourself as
timeless and eternal; then you would know the  Night Realm.  In the Night
Realm, you would see each other as radiating Spheres of  Eternal Night Energy,
outshining even your surroundings.  As has been said before, you  must strive
to reach this realm, for it is only then, when you see and experience it
yourself, will you truly know the Night Realm.  The Night Realm is divided
into numerous  vibrational levels.

Each level is the home for Beings of compatible harmony and vibration.  The
Night Realm  can be viewed as having basically two major levels.  The higher
region, I will refer to as  the Celestial Night, and the lower as the Magickal
Night.

The Celestial Night is the home, so to speak, of the Night Spirit.  It is the
region of the  Night Spirit Power and Energy. Beyond this, very little can be
said about this region.  The  concepts that make up this region go well beyond
your understanding.  Perhaps it is here,  that I should discuss the concept of
dimensions.

Referring back to the Astral Realm, you will remember that when you are in it,
that you  could do a great deal of things that you could not do on Earth.  You
could float in the air,  conjure up a four course meal, build a house by
thought, and could return to the lower  level of Earth.  In your Astral Body,
you could go through Earthly walls and not be seen by  people still in an
Earthly Body.  On Earth, you often refer to the physical plane as the third
dimension, and you could, therefore, refer to the Astral Realm as the fourth.
If you go to  the next dimension, that is the fifth, you would have an even
greater range of abilities and  be governed by totally different concepts then
those of the lower dimensions.  With each  higher dimension, the concepts that
apply become more abstract and less  understandable by those in lower
dimensions.  This is why the Celestial Region is far  beyond your
understanding.  This region could be viewed as the twentieth or fiftieth
dimension.  It is well beyond comprehension.  Then, there is the Magickal
Region.

You could view it as the ninth or tenth dimension.  So again, understanding of
its  composition and concepts is well beyond you. You do know that it is the
home of your  Oversoul.  It is the place you know as the Realm of the
Perfected Night Magician.  It is the  region of Magickal Wisdom.  It is here
that all ideas and prototypes are fixed and  released into the lower
dimensions below and become manifest on each level.  This is the  dimension
where you find the Causal Body.

The Magickal Region holds the vehicle through which you enter your Inner Night
Realm.   You enter the Inner Night Realm through your Causal Body.  Your
magickal nature is  found summed in the Causal Body.  All that you have ever
done has gone into molding the  Causal Body.  The Causal Body is as inert and
undeveloped as any other Body or vehicle  in which you have had to find
expression here on Earth.  All that you have ever done, has  gone towards
refining the Causal or Magickal Body.  You could liken the Causal Body to a
treasure chest.  It is here, that you store your Magickal Silver.  Your
Magickal Silver  consisting of all the accomplishments and growth you have
ever acquired while in  existence.  It is these things which activate and
quicken the Magickal Body.  It is through  this Magickal Vehicle, that you are
joined in Oneness with your Oversoul.  It is the  Oversoul's Magickal Body, as
well as yours. This is why I have stressed to give so much  energy to Night
Magick.  This is why I have stressed, so much, on the things that you must  do
to grow magickally.  When the Causal Body is perfected then you join the
Oversoul in  Perfection and Energy.  Then, you reach up and into the
Consciousness of your Night  Soul.  This is why I have presented this chapter
on Fire or Night Magick.

Through the practice of the information, exercises, and rites found in this
chapter, you will greatly enhance the development of your Causal Body.
Through hard effort, dedication, perseverance, and patience, you can achieve
perfection of the Magickal Body.  You will  expand, refine, and fully develop
your Magickal Body and the perfection of your Inner  Nature.  All that you
will do, in this chapter, will directly effect your Oversoul. S/He will be
your active Partner and Friend in your life.  You will learn to give and apply
magickal  healing direct from the Oversoul within.  You will learn the Night
Rites, which will directly  bring power and energy into your Inner Being and
the world around you.  You will learn  how to use the Night Powers and Flames,
and the great changes that you can bring into  the world through them.  There
are other subjects that you will explore, and that will bring  knowledge and
wisdom into your life from their study.  This is your final chapter and will,
perhaps, open up before you knowledge and power never before encountered.
Remember, that in all you learn and practice, you must remain in the Energy
and Will of  your Oversoul.

Even though this is the final chapter, and you may have been sailing along in
your  education in Night Magick, and passing all the tests, remember, that
your study and  progress goes on forever into eternity.  You will never stop
learning and growing in Night  Magick.  Beyond this Earthly life, there is so
much that awaits before you.  So, practice  Night Magick with dedication and
perseverance and remain victorious on the road of Night  Magick. Your first
subject for discussion, in Fire Magick, is the Great Magickal Beings  who are
the Citizenry of the Magickal and Material Universe.

42.  The Solar, Planetary, and Lunar Powers   

It may come as a shock to you, but the Stars, Planets, and Moons that you look
upon  every day and night are indeed Great Magickal Entities.  Descending from
out of the  Celestial Realm, they have chosen to incarnate into the Stars,
Planets and Moons.  Their  magickal path is one of many advanced magickal
paths, but it is a very important path.  It  is important, especially in
regards to you, for it provides places upon which lesser souls  may find
development and magickal advancement.  Humans are not, by any means, the  only
race in the universe.  The Stars, Planets and Moons are, indeed, Conscious,
Sentient  Beings, each with their own personal natures.  Under this topic, I
am going to discuss  each of these Inner Natures.  I will begin with a
discussion of the Solar Life.  I will then  discuss the Planetary and Lunar
God/Goddesses, in general, and then discuss,  specifically, the Inner Natures
of each.  Along with discussing their Inner Natures, I will  also talk about
the auric effect of each, upon you.  If you are ready, then let's proceed to
the Solar Force.

The visible Stars are inhabited by advanced beings following the Yang path of
development. There is no doubt that physically we need the Sun in order to
provide  physical heat and act as a physical source for the positive solar
energy needed by living  things on Earth.  As a Night Magician you will become
very sensitive to solar energy.  As  your depth in the Night proceeds you will
need less and less of the solar energy.  You  want to be very careful not to
receive too much sunlight and so become overcharged with  solar force.  This
will definitely harm your magickal workings.  I have been to places  where the
Night Force was so strong that it acted much like a polarized lens and
filtered  the harmful energy of the Sun from me.  But these places are few and
far between.  If you  wrap yourself tightly in your Night Pillar then you will
greatly minimize the harmful effects  of the Sun.

Within this system though because it is a Yin system there is also the Dark
Sun.  It is also called the Black Sun.  The Black Sun absorbs too much Yang
Energy and moves it to  another time and place that is a Yang system.  The
Black Sun is the source of all Yin  Energy in this Dark Solar System.  It is
the Parent Force to the Planetary and Lunar  Deities.  Let's examine this
parenthood some more.

You will remember that every human being receives its Oversoul and Godsoul
from a part  of the great whole which is the Earth Goddess/God's Oversoul and
Godsoul.  In similar  manner, the Planetary and Lunar Deities receive their
Oversoul and Godsoul from the  Dark Sun.  So we have the Dark Sun as the sum
of the whole, who then divides Its Eternal  Self into smaller pieces who are
the Planetary and Lunar Deities, and they in turn divide  their sum into
individual sparks which become encased in the material world.  The Ancients
knew, thou enshrouded in myth, that the Planets and Moons are the physical
vehicles of very advanced beings.  You are familiar with your own physical
body and the  other vehicles that make up your material being.  You also know
that you have an aura  that is charged with emotions and thoughts.  When you
meet someone in the office, for  example, and come within range of their aura,
you often sense things about that person.   If they are feeling uplifted, or
angry and depressed, you can sense that about the person.   You also have
found that if you permit it, their aura may induce these same feelings in
you.  This is somewhat similar when we speak about the Planetary and Moon
Spirits  having bodies.

They do have bodies, and along with that, they also have an aura that is
supercharged  with emotions and thoughts that reflect the Inner Nature of
their Being.  Their bodies are  enormous and so are their auras.  Thus, the
effect of these auras is far reaching.  Yet, I  want to say this: Humankind
are foolish creatures when they allow the Stars, Planets, or  Moons to rule
their destiny.  The effect of Their Auras may heighten the highest qualities
in humankind but they do not rule humankind's destiny.  Your destiny is in
your own  hands and the Hands of Your Oversoul.  Remember this.  Now what
effects do these Great  Ones have upon you.

When the Dark Sun runs strong through you, you find yourself filled with
vitality and  health. You are ambitious, proud, strong willed, and face life
with great courage.  You  have a very strong and stable personality.  You have
a great drive and zest for life.  You  are a very independent and confidant
soul.  You are generally quick witted, perceptive,  thoughtful, and
considerate.  These are the things that the Dark Sun can bring out in you.
You will soon learn how to increase the power of the Dark Sun that runs
through your  veins.  You will learn how to do this through the Night Rites.
The Dark Sun does run  through everyone, to some degree, but can be greatly
intensified by practicing the Night  Rites.
