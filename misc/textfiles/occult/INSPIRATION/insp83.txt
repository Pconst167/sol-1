WHEN THE MESSIAH COMES

    When things were bad, and we didn't have the things we needed or wanted,
the grandfathers would say, 'You'll get it, you'll have it... when the Messiah
comes!'

'Daddy can I have a bicycle?' - 'Sure, when the Messiah comes.'

Some began making excuses for his not coming: 

'He can only come when there's peace on earth.'

'He can only come when all Jews observe one Sabbath together.'

Others said, 'There's no coming of the Messiah.' Later,some said,'There
is no Messiah.' Some even said, 'THERE IS NO GOD.'

    Today Most say, 'Who cares? (The price of pickled herring in Paraguay
is more important, anyway.)'
    Some few, in a voice almost ashamed to ask, 'What is the Messiah, and can
he do anything for me?'
    Well, if you really want to know, the answer is this: The Messiah is the 
one who can set things straight... and the good news is that he has ALREADY 
come...and He is in Oakland, California...(and everywhere else), and he's 
brought a bicycle big enough for EVERYBODY!
    If you really want the right things to happen to you, ask HIM if HE would
come into YOUR LIFE.
    Ask for HIM by name. The only true MESSIAH is JESUS (Acts 4:12).
    He is the one whom the prophets spoke of, the one we all have been waiting
for... or SHOULD have.
    Jesus said 'had you believed Moses, you would have believed me, for he
wrote of me.' (John 5:46)
    Check Him out... HE'S waiting for YOU EVERYWHERE.
