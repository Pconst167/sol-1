
   This is the beginning
       of a New Day.
 God has given me this day
     to use as I will.
       I can waste it
    or grow in its light
 and be of service to others.
       But what I do
 with this day is important
  because I have exchanged
  a day of my life for it.
    When tomorrow comes,
 today will be gone forever.
  I hope I will not regret
  the price I paid for it.
