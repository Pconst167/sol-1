                       -----------------


Think how wonderful our nation
  And how peaceful it could be
If each prayed, and searched the Scriptures
  As much as they tuned in T V.
It's amazing and appalling,
  How the Lord is so denied.
Many people have exchanged their Bibles
  For that so-called T V Guide.
Murder pictures--children watching,
  Programs often base, obscene.
Many juvenile delinquents
  Can be traced back to the screen.
Pastors, many are bemoaning.
  Small attendance Sunday nights.
Careless members, home and watching
  Special programs or the fights.

Surely, this must grieve the Master:
  All this tendency to crime,
As He notes "the wasted hours",
  How and what we do with our time.
With this grip upon our nation,
  Midnight hour, so very nigh;
Yet we lull to sleep our conscience,
  Mid a "Rock-Roll" lullaby.

Spiritual suicide is certain
  If continued in this way
How we need to search the Scriptures:
  More and more we ought to pray.
There would be tremendous difference,
  (To this you may not agree)
But our GREATEST Spiritual ROBBER
Is none other than T V.
