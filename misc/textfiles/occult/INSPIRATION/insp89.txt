                            --------


What's happened to the cross that stood on the hill
    Have they torn it down, or is it standing there still?
Does the blood that flowed from Calvary's brow
    Still have the power to save us now?
Do you know what they've done to the virgin birth
    They laughed it to scorn, it's been drug through the dust;
What's happened to holiness we used to possess?
    When our church was on fire and people got blessed.

The world is so hungry to hear it again
    The spirit of God wants to live within men;
Is our heart turned to heaven or does pleasure intrude
    We get cold and indifferent without spiritual food.
Its got to start from the pulpit down
    Are we living for Jesus or just playing around?
The people must hear not watered down
    Then the love of our Savior on earth will abound.
