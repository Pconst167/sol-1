MY PERSONAL DEDICATION TO GOD

God means a lot to a lot of people, I am no exception.  I am 13 years old and 
God is very important in my life.  He helps me resist the many temptations to 
sin that every teen has.

God gives me the strength to do the things he wants me to do, and he can give 
you that strength also, all you have to do is accept Christ as your own 
personal savior.

Sin and temptation are everywhere in a teen's life, and it is hard for a 
Christian teen to ignore all this on his own, that is where God comes in for me.

I call on guidence from our Lord regularly, for things like tests or for 
things like forgiving my many sins.  God answers all prayers, he makes things 
easier for me and he can make them easier for you.

I find it hard to understand why everyone dosen't accept Jesus Christ.  He 
works miracles in my life and he will work them in yours, try it.
