Lessons in Faith - 2 ----------------

     "Mom, why do we have go to church?" 
     "We go to church to pray and worship God!" 
     "But we can do that at home. I say my prayers before I go to 
bed, and Dad thanks God for food before supper." 
     "At church we have fellowship with other people who ÿbelieve 
in God." 
     "What is 'fellowship'?" 
     "Fellowship is caring about other believers and sharing news 
about what God has done." 
     "Is that like when I told my friend about Jesus?" 
     "Not quite, ÿthat is called witnessing. ÿFellowship is ÿmore 
like ÿgoing to a party where everyone knows your name, ÿÿeveryone 
believes ÿin God and his son Jesus, ÿand everyone is always ready 
and ÿhappy to help you in any way. ÿEveryone cares about what ÿis 
happening ÿin your life, ÿand is ready to listen if you ÿneed ÿto 
talk, ÿÿand ready to pray with you about your or ÿsomeone ÿelse's 
needs." 
     "That ÿsounds like the Bible study you have here on Tuesdays 
with all those ladies!" 
     "That's right! ÿWe all share God in common, ÿand are ÿalways 
ready to share him and what he has done!" 
     "My teacher in Sunday School always asks 'What did God do in 
your ÿlife this past week?' ÿOnce Joey said that God gave him ÿan 
'A' on his math quiz!" 
     "Your Sunday School class is a fellowship!" 
     "Mom, is fellowshiping important?" 
     "Yes. ÿWithout fellowship, ÿa ÿbeliever might start to ÿfeel 
alone in the world. ÿBelievers need to share, to know that God is 
working in our, and other people's lives." 
     "Mom, ÿÿI ÿÿknow it's Friday, ÿbut could we go to church ÿto 
fellowship now?"
