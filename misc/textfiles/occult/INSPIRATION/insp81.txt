IN TIMES OF TROUBLE

        GOD'S TRUSTING CHILD MAY SAY:

FIRST   He brought me here. It is by His will I am in this difficult place:
        in that I will rest.

NEXT    He will keep me here in His Love and give me grace in this trial to 
        behave as His child.

THEN    He will make the testing a blessing, teaching me the lessons HE 
        intends for me to learn, and working in me the grace He intends
        to give.

LAST    In His good time He can bring me out again - how and when HE knows.


                             YOU SAY: I am here

                          1. By God's appointment

                          2. In His care

                          3. Under His training

                          4. For His time



        And call upon me in the day of trouble:

        I will deliver thee, 

        and thou shalt glorify me.

                        Psalm 50:15
