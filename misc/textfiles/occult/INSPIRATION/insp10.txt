
    If Jesus came to your house.

 If Jesus came to your house to spend a
    day or two
 If he came unexpectedly, I wonder what
    you'd do.
 Oh, I know you'd give your nicest room
    to such an honered Guest,
 And all the food you'd serve to Him
    would be the very best,
 And you keep assuring Him
    you're glad to have Him there
 That serving Him in your own home is
    joy beyond compare.

 But when you saw Him coming,
    would you meet Him at the door
 With arms outstreched in welcome to
    your heavenly Visitor?
 Or would you have to change your
    clothes before you let Him in?
 Or hide some magazines and put the
    Bible where they'd been?
 Would you turn off the radio and hope
    He hadn't heard?
 And wish you hadn't uttered that last,
    loud, hasty word?

 Would you hide your worldly music and
    put some hymn books out?
 Could you let Jesus walk right in, or
    would you rush about?
 And I wonder if the Savior spent
    a day or two with you,
 Would you go right on doing the things
    you always do?
 Would you go right on saying the things
    you always say?
 Would life for you continue as it does
    from day to day?

 Would your family conversation keep
    up its usual pace?
 And would you find it hard each meal
    to say a table grace?
 Would you sing the songs you always
    sing, and read the books you read,
 And let him know the things on which
    your mind and spirit feed?
 Would you take Jesus with you every-
    where you'd planned to go?
 Or would you, maybe, change your plans
    for just a day or so?

 Would you be glad to have Him meet
    your very closest friends?
 Or would you hope they'd stay away
    until His visit ends?
 Would you be glad to have Him stay
    forever on and on?
 Or would you sigh with great relief
    when He at last was gone?
 It might be interesting to know the
    things that you would do
 If Jesus Christ in person came to spend
    some time with you.
