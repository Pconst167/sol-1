                   23rd PSALM FOR BUSY PEOPLE


 The Lord is my Pacesetter, I will not rush.
 He makes me stop and rest for quiet intervals.
 He provides me with stillness, which restores my serenity.
 He leads me in ways of efficiency, through calmness of mind;
   and His guidance is peace.
 Even though I have a great many things to accomplish each day,
 I will not fret, for His presence is here.
 His timelessness, His all-importance will keep me in balance.
 He prepares refreshment and renewal in the midst of my activity
 By anointing my mind with His oils of tranquillity.
 My cup of joyous energy overflows.
 Surely harmony and effectiveness shall be the fruits of my hours,
 And I shall walk in the peace of the Lord for ever.
