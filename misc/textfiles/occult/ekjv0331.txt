Yes, and Gretchen (side note) is also one of our writing professors at
Concordia University in Irvine.  She's a pretty nice person, but a
harder
prof (so I hear (g)).  To your comment:  ROFL.

I might be interested, too.  Also, Jeff Spector might want to talk to
you
about the KJV and other, more reliable translations of the Bible.
Check
what I said in MORMONISM and see if you agree with what I wrote.

(Nodding head furiously in agreement.)  I have been wanting to make up a
list of timely tips for curious Christians, with statements such as the
following:

        * The words "HOLY BIBLE" on the front cover of a Bible will
          NOT make your Bible any holier.

        * Scofield Reference notes are NOT a part of the inspired text.

        * N.I.V. is a Bible translation;  H.I.V. is a virus.
          The King James Version is a Bible Translation; "James King"
          is not, neither is "St. James."

        * Christ did not speak in red letters.

        * There is no such thing as an "anointed" Bible; there IS such
          a thing as an "annotated" Bible.

        * The apostles did not write, nor use, the King James Version.

        * The only thing that Gayle Riplinger's book has in common with
          accepted scholarly works on Biblical translation is a cover,
          pages and ink.

Aye, I've seen Strong's used to grind "root" words to powder for
the sake of "argument". From what I can understand in my limited
knowledge of Koine Greek, and particularly Biblical Hebrew, the
exact definition of a number of the "root" words are sometimes
nebulous, leaving us to depend on context and the accumulative
evidences of Scripture for a proper understanding.

Ruckman is more SOLID than Riplinger, if THAT tells you anything.

Sadly, after more than 10 years of work in Mormonism, about six years
of
work in Roman Catholicism, numerous books, scholarly debates, etc., it
looks like I'm finally becoming nationally known: as the greatest
living
expert on Gayle Riplinger's _New Age Bible Versions_.  I've been
invited to
speak at a conference with folks like Norm Geisler, Craig Branch, and
Eric
Pement in September, and on what?  Yup, Gayle Riplinger.  < sigh >  God

Are you also getting Apologia? Lots of good discussion on Mormonism

Depends on which foxhole you're in I reckon ;). Brings back
memories of an earlier encounter with some Ruckermaniacs a while
back.

Funny, because I happen to study primarily, albeit it _not_
exclusively, out of the KJV, but for different reasons than the
usual so prevelant today. It's what we had to learn when I was in
boarding school during my "formative" years [have I just "dated" my
education? <laughter>] and I happen to have a penchant for
Elizabethan english.

Isn't that sort of behavior the norm in cyberspace? Of course the
government wants to take over the "Information Superhighway" (where
lies and misinformation in enormous quantity can and do travel at the
speed of light): megalomaniacs feel right at home here. The likes of
you and Richard Bacon over at the Blue Banner (in Rowlett, TX) are the
exceptions.

He is pretty calm, come to think of it. He's not one for long threads,
though. He presents his opinion, labels his opponents un-Christian,

Subj: RIPLINGER'S BOOK               Conf: (170) E-kjv Ccn
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, James!
    Books for the Greek class are selling pretty well.  Any chance I
might be
able to get back on Pros?
    As for the Riplinger book, a few things of interest:

    1. Gayle quotes Edwin Palmer, stating that "[his NIV] (her quotes)
       shows the great error that is so prevalent today in some orthodox
       circles, namely the error that regeneration depends upon faith
...
       (curious ellipses, Ms. Riplinger has deleted part of the quote)
and
       that in order to be born again man must first accept Jesus as
Savior."

       First off, Palmer was not referring to "his NIV" since the book
she
       is quoting from was written in *1958*, before the NIV was a
twinkle
       in anyone's eye.  Secondly, Palmer is making a statement
concerning
       the sovereignty of God the Holy Spirit, a statement which has
been
       tampered with by Ms. Riplinger... The quote (with the missing
words
       deleted) is: "...namely the error that regeneration depends upon
       faith AND NOT UPON GOD, and that in order to be born again man
must
       first accept Jesus as Savior."  Palmer is stating that
regeneration
       depends upon God, and without God, no man can accept Jesus as
Savior.
       Palmer's statement attacks Arminiamism/Decision Theology - which
       holds that man effects SOMETHING, contributes SOMETHING to his
       salvation...through the "Sinner's Prayer," "sincere repentance,"
       etc.

    2. The "New Age Bible" pictured on page 33...is a King James
Version!
       (I can prove it...I have a copy!)

    3. Patent dishonesty on page 57, in relation to the Lord's Prayer.
       "...which art in heaven..." does not occur at Luke 11 in *any*
       pre-5th century manuscript!  It was the SCRIBES that INSERTED the
       words from Matthew 6:9-13 in an attempt to "harmonize" the
accounts.
       Doesn't it seem strange that she would use the most UNFAMILIAR
       rendering of the Lord's Prayer?  Because if she used Matthew
6:9-13,
       it would destroy her entire argument.  (It does ANYWAY!)

 Of course, these are minor chinks into the paper wall which is
Riplinger's
book.  James, I'd be interested in assisting you in researching her
quotes, if
you ever plan on writing a large-scale refutation.  It really needs to
be
written.  (By the way, did you ever get the ad I sent you for the book,
"King
James Version - Spawn of Satan"?  Hee hee!)

     1. The NT text used by the KJV translators was not the Textus
Receptus,
        which was not published until over 10 years after the KJV was
        translated.

     2. The KJV translators used Stephen's edition of Erasmus' Greek NT
text.

     3. Erasmus' was Catholic, and was opposed to the Reformation.

     4. Erasmus dedicated his Greek NT to Pope Leo X, the Pope who
        condemned and excommunicated Martin Luther, the Reformer!

No WONDER the Catholic dictionaries speak of the King James Version in
such
glowing terms.  Hmmm...the KJV a CATHOLIC corruption?  And what about
old
Charles Taze Russell?  His foundational false doctrines were formulated
using
the KJV.  Not to mention that the KJV is the official translation of the
Mormon Church, Christian Science, the Branch Davidians, the United
Pentecostal
Church, the Way International and the Children of God?  And come to
think of
it, which translation is quoted more often by New Agers than any other
English
translation?  YOU GOT IT - the KJV!  Methinks I could write me OWN
conspiracy
theory!  Who knows, maybe I'll even find Jimmy Hoffa in the process!
Muahahahaaaaa...

All very true.  Riplinger tried to make Erasmus into a great textual

Luther's German Bible in creating his greek text!  (Woops!)

Of course, that was the same program in which she said I was "rude and

Well, the worst part is that Luther translated the NT portion of the
German
Bible *from* Erasmus' Greek text.  In other words, Riplinger, in her
frantic attempt to find *anything* in her support, turns history on its
head yet once again.

the
answer.)  Also, he said that the world will end in the year 2004, since
it
represents 2000 years since the Epistle to the Romans was written (A.D.
4?)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I switched some years ago from the KVJ to the NKJV.  There were a number
of reasons for the switch, which was made only after a great deal of
prayer and a reading of the NKJV to see 1) how it read (I'm an
inveterate reader and a writer and the quality of the English is
important to me), and 2) how God used it in speaking to me.  Briefly, I
found that,  1) while I have no trouble with 1611 English, the NKJV is
simply much more proper in terms of twentieth century vocabulary and
grammar; and 2) God used (and is using since the switch) the NKJV as
much as He had the KJV.

But what really broke this camel's back was the NKJV rendering of Isaiah
9:5.  In the KJV this verse reads:

          For every battle of the warrior [is] with confused
          noise, and garments rolled in blood; but [this]
          shall be with burning [and] fuel of fire.

In the NKJV, however, it is rendered:

          For every warrior's sandal
            from the noisy battle,
          And garments rolled in blood,
          Will be used for burning [and]
            fuel of fire.

This is clearly a significant different.  The KJV says "confused noise"
while the NKJV has it as "noisy battle."  I immediately thought that the
NKJV had made a translation error.  But when I consulted my Strong's
Hebrew dictionary, lo and behold! it was the KJV which had erred.

At this point I decided that I wouldn't be able to catch every
translation error - I simply didn't have the time.  It behooved me,
therefore, to switch to a version that was more accurate in its
renderings, and I did so.

This is not to say that the KJV's translators were malicious in their
erroneous renderings.  They did not, however, have the amount of
information that we do today, and they were moreover human and prone to
error.  And since there is not one Biblical verse that says any
translation, much less the KJV specifically, partakes of the exact same
kind and degree of inspiration that inhered in the original autographs,
it is foolish to think that in instances such as this the KJV is right,
and the original text and modern versions are wrong together.

Q: How did the term "textus receptus" originate?

A: It originated through a highly exaggerated statement - actually a
publisher's blurb - in the preface to the second edition of the Greek
New
Testament that was published in Holland in 1633 by the Elzevir
Brothers.
In this Latin preface they called their book "the text which is now
received by all, in which we give nothing changed or corrupted." This
is how this latin term textus receptus (text received) came to be
applied
to a particular text of the Greek New Testament. On the European
continent,
aside from Great Britain, the first Elzevir edition (published 1624)
was
for a long time the standard edition of the Greek New Testament.


Q: Did the King James translators use their "textus receptus" as the
basis
for their translation?

A: NO. Even the first Elzevir edition was not published until 13 years
after the date of the KJV.


Q: What was the Greek text on which the KJV New Testament was based?

A: It was based on the third edition of the Greek New Testament, issued
by
the Parisian publisher Stephanus (Latinized form of Estienne) in 1550.


Q: Was the text of Stephanus on which the King James Version was based
identical with the later "textus receptus"?

A: NO. The two differed in 287 places.


Q: How many Greek manuscripts agreed exactly with the edition published
by Stephanus, and how many agree exactly with the edition published by
Elzevir?

A: There is no Greek manuscript that agrees exactly with either of
these.
Both of them are conflate texts.


Q: Were the scholars who prepared the King James Version convinced that
their text was absolutely correct?

A: NO. They recognized the possibility of copyists' errors, and showed
this by making marginal notes to variant readings at 13 places. For
instance, in Luke 17:36 their marginal note reads: "This 36th verse is
wanting in most of the Greek copies." In Acts 25:6, where their text
reads:
"When he had tarried among them more than ten days," they inserted the
following marginal note: "Or, as some copies read, no more than eight
or
ten days."


Q: What was the source of most of the readings found both in the
edition
of Stephanus and in that of Elzevir?

A: Most of the readings in both of these follow the edition of the
Greek
New Testament prepared by Erasmus, the great enemy of Martin Luther,
and
published in 1516, the year before the Reformation began.


Q: How many manuscripts agree exactly with Erasmus' edition of the
Greek
New Testament?

A: There is no Greek manuscript that agrees exactly with it. Erasmus
made
it by combining the readings of several manuscripts, none of them
earlier
than the tenth century A.D., and most of them still later. In some
parts
of the New Testament he had no manuscript at all, but simply translated
from the Latin Bible.

Q: To whom was the Greek New Testament prepared by Erasmus dedicated?

A: It was dedicated to Pope Leo X, the Pope who later condemned Luther
and
the Reformation.  It is believed that this Pope gave Erasmus' publisher
the
exclusive right to publish the Greek New Testament for a period of time.


Q: Have better manuscripts been discovered than those on which the
textus
receptus was based?

A: During the three and one-half centuries since the King James Version
was
made dozens of manuscripts have been found that were copied many
centuries
earlier than any manuscript used by Erasmus. The manuscripts he used
were
copies of copies of copies of copies of copies of copies. When material
is
copied a number of times by hand, extra words and phrases generally
find
their way into the text in the course of copying and occasionally the
eye
of a copyist may jump from one word or phrase to a similar one, and
thus
omit something or perhaps copy it twice.


Q: Does this mean that the textus receptus is a harmful text?

A: The additions in the textus receptus do not contain any idea that is
not
taught elsewhere in the New Testament in parts that agree with the
earlier
manuscripts. The differences consist mainly of repetition or ideas
already
contained elsewhere in the Scripture.


Q: Then why bother to hunt for early manuscripts? Why not simply follow
the
textus receptus?

A: God inspired the manuscripts that came from the hands of the
original
writers. It is impossible to copy a book of any length without making
some
mistakes. In the case of the New Testament we have more evidence for
determining the text of the original writers than for any other book
from
ancient times. While there is rarely anything harmful in the textus
receptus, if we truly wish to know God's Word, to base our text, as far
as
possible, on early manuscripts.


Q: What IS the situation among early New Testament manuscripts?

A: 95% of the known Greek New Testament manuscripts were copied after
A.D.
700, more than six centuries after the New Testament was written. Among

It's Gayle Riplinger, a she, not a he (she has lots of degrees in home
economics and interior design).  She's the author of the single worst
book
published in 1993, _New Age Bible Versions_ (ultra KJV-Only).
