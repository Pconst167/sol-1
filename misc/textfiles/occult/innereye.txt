    Taking  your  time, translate each of the following descriptions into a
    mental image.  Go back and do it again in a few weeks and  then  a  few
    weeks  later,  and notice the difference.  Notice the difference, also,
    in the way you see things...inner as well as outer..after  you've  done
    these exercises.


    LETS START OK?

    Now  sense  (see, smell, taste, feel, or hear) with your mind's eye the
    following phrases:


    *  a familiar face

    *  a galloping horse

    *  a rosebud

    *  your bedroom

    *  a changing stoplight

    *  the sound of rain on the roof
          the voice of a friend
          children laughing at play

    *  the feel of soft fur
          an itch
          a gentle breeze on your face

    *  the muscular feeling of running
          of kicking a can
          of drawing a circle on paper

    *  the taste of a lemon
          of tooth paste
          of a potato chip

    *  the smell of bacon frying
          of a gardenia
          of perspiration

    *  the feeling of hunger
          of a cough
          of comming awake

    *  a stone dropped into a quite pond with concentric ripples
          forming and expanding outward...

    *  of this text or paper flying away, high into the blue sky
          and finally disappearing...

    *  your shoe coming apart in slow motion and each piece drifting
          away into space...

    *  an orange being cut into five equal pieces and the pieces
          being aranged in three different patterns...


    May you find the joy and peace that you  deserve,  and  may  this  text
    assist you in developing the inner eye...
