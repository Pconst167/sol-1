                            A  TRUE  STORY







                              Preface
                              -------








    I am typing this document because I feel that it is important to put the
    information that was only available on tape,  until the present time,
    in written form.  I feel this is important because the information
    contained in the tape is of the utmost value and more people will become
    informed of it's contents if it is in written form.

    The original tape recording of the Testimony of John Todd Collins was
    made by an EX Nun in a Baptist Church in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania
    during an evening service.  The tape is not available commercially and
    never will be.  It is available only through 'grass roots' methods.

    In the tape John Todd Collins stated that he had a $200,000.00 bounty
    on his head by the so called 'ELITE' organization he had belonged to
    and since then I have heard by some that he was dead and by others
    that he has gone 'underground' to a special retreat he started for those
    like him who 'defected'.  I have not had verification of either of those
    reports.



    Many people are 'MIS-INFORMED' about what is REALLY going on in the
    world.  The Mass Media controls the 'Trend of Opinion' in the
    United States and in most of the Civilized World.  Who knows who controls
    the Mass Media?  John Todd, and other informed Historians say that
    there exists a powerful group of people who control what the masses
    here and learn about what is going on.  They have this ability because
    they control the Money!  They are in essence the 'Money Barons' of the
    world.

    John Todd Collins reveals in the tape what these 'Money Barons' have in
    mind for you,  the United States and the World.  He claims to have been
    a part of it, a part of it near the TOP!  He warns ALL,  and I am
    going to assist him by typing this.  It is my hope that this document
    will find it's way across America and that thousands will read it.

    This is my hope because I believe, with all my heart that what John
    Todd Collins said in the tape is TRUE,  and I do not say this lightly!
    I have dedicated much time and effort investigating the things he said
    in the tape and so have others.



    I am sure that you will see exactly what I mean after you have read this
    transcript of the tape.  If you are interested on following up on the
    information contained within this document,  I strongly recommend the
    following books on the subject........

    Don't think to yourself as you are reading this,  "This Is NONSENSE"!

    You will NOT be reading about 'Spooky Ghosts',  or,  'Witches with Long
    Noses' on Broomsticks,  as you see on TV and Children read about in
    Public Schoolbooks and Many Churches teach about the OCCULT to
    their congregations to PURPOSELY Delude and deceive them.

    You will NOT be reading about a 'Fairy Tale' in some kind of 'Dreamland'.
    This is REALity, in HIStory.  The BLACK side of the WHITE,  the DARK
    side of the LIGHT.  The WRONG side of the RIGHT,  the DOWN side of the
    UP,  the LYING side of the TRUTH and YOU are in the midst of it in
    LIFE,  unless you are DEAD,  and then it does not matter.

    You are not dead,  you are ALIVE and expected to be AWARE of what is
    going on in the midst of this REALity.  If you fail to do this,  you
    will FALL into the midst of it and be CRUSHED in it, SMOTHERED under
    it,  and believe me,  for your well being,  you do not want that to
    happen!

                        Then Make Up Your Mind
                        ----------------------




     I was introduced to the tape recording while I was at work.  A friend
     of mine came up to my work station and said, "You gotta listen to
     this"!  So,  I did,  and I could not stop listening to it until it was
     over 45 minutes later.  I became 'glued' to the earphone.  The things
     John said were so rivetting that my nature told me to investigate more
     about it.

     I have found that there are one of two reactions from people who hear
     the tape.  They either dismiss it as 'Poppycock' and forget about it,
     or they accept it at face value and delve into a research of the facts
     concerning the subject.  I was overwhelmed by the fact that I had never
     heard of any of this information before.  I thought "Is the whole world
     deluded in a lie"?  "Why had no one ever told me about this before"?
     Surely this information could not be so suppressed that all of my past
     school teachers knew nothing about it!

     To this day,  I am not certain why no one I came in contact with during
     the course of my life ever shared any of this knowledge with me,  but
     I feel that it is because most people do not want to think about it
     for very long.  They willingly suppress it in their minds.  They hide
     it conveniently tucked away in some far recess in their brain.

     I will admit that it is not a pleasant subject to think about,  but one
     should not hide it away in their mind.  Instead,  they should share
     the information with others as I and others are doing.  I guess that
     most people are afraid of being labeled as a 'Fanatic',  because
     that is what unlearned and unstable people will call you if you tell
     them.  Most people when they 'Stumble' upon the TRUTH,  fall over it
     and bang their head.  Others pick themselves up and go back to inves-
     tigate that which they 'Stumbled Upon'!  The later is the more noble
     to be sure!

                    The Testimony of John Todd Collins
                 ________________________________________









   Introduction by the Preacher:

   John is from the family line of Collins that brought witchcraft to Salem
   Mass.  His occult name was Lance Collins.  John was initiated into a
   witch coven at thirteen years of age,  became a High Priest then at
   eighteen,  joined the Military and served in the Special Forces known as
   the Green Beret's.  His IQ tested at 175 and I could go on and on reading
   many things about him but I think the most Glorious event in his life
   and I am sure he would agree and I am thankful that this happened,  John
   was saved through the witness of a faithful Pastor,  Rev. Jack Tiller and
   the ministries of the Castle Hills Baptist Church in San Antonio,  Texas.
   I am so glad that he was saved and brought out of that which he was in,
   AMEN.....(response...AMEN),  and we thank the Lord especially for that
   tonight.

   It is a GREAT Honor and a GREAT Joy to introduce to our Congregation
   Bro. John Todd,  and I am sure what he is going to say tonight will be
   enlightening,  challenging and he is going to speak to all of our hearts.
   Let's give him a real good open door and a Chambersburg welcome,  shall
   we? (response.....Loud Applause 10 secs.)






   John Todd (Dialogue)
   -----------------

   One thing I would like to say before I get started.  It never seems to
   fail that when I am done a few of my brothers and sisters in the Lord
   have FEAR in their HEARTS!  There is NO reason to have FEAR in your
   HEART.  Seems like every time we talk about the ENEMY Christians become
   afraid rather than serve up fighting mad!  So I just ask that if you have
   this fear in your heart when this is over,  that you just simply get in
   your prayer chain or up front or someplace with the Lord and discuss the
   matter with Him.  There is NOTHING to be AFRAID of when it comes to the
   DEVIL!  He was DEFEATED 2000 years ago.  That's why I am here!  He was
   DEFEATED 2000 years ago!  I think the thing that made me the most mad
   when I got saved was that I served somebody since a child,  for over
   20 years,  that was DEFEATED 2000 years ago.  And I guess the only reason
   that I served him was I didn't realize who he was till I got saved.  It
   took that enlightenment.  Brother Barry preached this morning on the
   Devil blinding God's peoples eyes and just the worlds eyes. Take it for
   a FACT!  He can do it.  For 20 some years I served him as a PRIEST and
   a HIGH PRIEST and later as a GRAND DRUID and had many thousands of people
   serving him under me. And never ONCE did I even realize who I serving.

   There were many things that I learned in witchcraft,  I am not going to
   tell you what they were, but there were many things that I learned and
   many things that I taught as a standard teaching in witchcraft.  As you
   go through apprenticeship or as you go through what we call the 'Outer
   Court',  you are told to do things.  You DON'T ASK WHY you do them!  If
   you do ask why you do them they tell you that you are being naughty,
   that you shouldn't ask,  mainly because they don't know!

   I never did know why I was doing the things I was doing or why I was
   teaching the things that I was teaching.  They worked,  so we did them.

   After I got saved,  it took SALVATION for me to find out why they worked.
   And I guess after knowing that,  there is no way you can go back from
   what you came out of.

   Very quickly tonight.  Well it can't be very quickly,  but I'll try.  I
   want to give my testimony and then I want to turn it over for questions
   and answers. I've learned the hard way after 5 years it's normal for me to
   say the things that I say but it is ASTOUNDING for you to listen to them.
   And I realize that when the meeting is over that many things I say are
   strange to Christians.  Most of you grew up in Christian homes or even if
   you were in the world you were not very close to what I was into.  So when
   I say things,  to me,  they are everyday things. I guess that is why we
   have such a successful ministry with the people on drugs and the people
   in the occult because they have tried to tell Christians for years the
   things they have been into and the things they have experienced and they
   look at them like they are 'Crazy' and I come along and I say, 'Oh,  Oh
   sure I'll listen to ya'.  I've been there!  I know the same things.  And
   I will sit there and I will listen and they find it very outstanding that
   I believe them because I have experienced them too.  So I don't gasp at
   somebody when they tell me that they have seen demons or floated things
   through the air or received answers on Ouija Boards or made people do
   their own will by spells,  I was there,  I know it is so,  but at the same
   time I know how weak it is compared to what I have now.  I have told
   witches across the United States,  we went to St.Paul when they were going
   to have their convention this year,  which they called off, they are
   having it right now in Washington D.C...this is the last night of it. And
   it was in all the front pages of the newspapers down there.  Christians
   across the Unites States say, 'You don't really expect us to believe that
   witches are that organized',  NO!  They've just got Senators and Congress-
   men and top witches down there all in one convention. They are not that
   organized,  not at all!

   But anyway we were there and many witches came up to me and asked me why
   I would become a Christian.  See, witches have the opinion that either
   Christians are the most evil things that ever lived or they are the most
   foolish people that ever lived.  They wanted to know why I would become a
   Christian.  I said 'because I am more powerful now than I was when I was a
   witch',  that's not the reason,  but I said it in words that they would
   understand. They couldn't grasp that.  I know how they feel.  When I was
   in witchcraft I never considered Christianity until the night I got saved.

   I never once considered it was an answer.  I never considered that Jesus
   was an answer and that the things in the Christian Church were foolish
   at the least and dangerous at the most,  and I guess that they are
   dangerous to witchcraft. But to explain what I am talking about very
   quickly......

   I come from a family called the Collins' some of them ,  on this side of
   the Atlantic Ocean from England,  have changed their name to Todd, back
   prior to the Civil War.   But that doesn't say that all Collins' are
   Todds' or this family that I come from.  But this family brought witch-
   craft to the United States.  I was in Philadelphia the other night,  and
   I don't understand what it's all about,  but after I left there,  the new-
   spaper decided that their greatest campaign would be against me.  Many
   things that I said in my testimony they said that they checked out and
   were not so.  Funny we checked them out and they still were so!  Like many
   things that I will mention tonight.  We even went as far as to say that
   witchcraft started outside of Salem Mass. and even named the Bay that
   the witches landed,  after the Head Witch,  my ancestor Francis Collins,
   and the newspaper said that place didn't exist.  We looked at the map and
   it's still there. We don't understand quite what they were up to but I
   guess they confused enough people to disregard us.  We were wondering
   when people were going to get around to this,  but anyway......

   I come from the Collin's family.  And just because this is outside of
   Salem,  let me quickly remind you that no witches were executed in Salem!
   There will be a book coming out shortly on this from Chick Publications.

   Except for one prostitute,  everyone executed in Salem were Christians.
   And they were tried and convicted by a jury and by a Pastor who was not
   a Pastor he was a Slave Trader hired by the Collins',  the Church was
   built by the Collins' and the jury were all members of the Collins'
   Church.  Needless to say they weren't Christians. They were Witches!
