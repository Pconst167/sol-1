        Following the programming text are additional files from several
people on hacking the FOVC, the trik clip, and cable specs for all Motorola 
phones.  If you have any corrections or additional information to be added to

        ****** READ THIS ******   I will be going to my Motorola Technical 
school in a month or so for certification.  So if anybody has any questions
they'd like me to ask the "experts", drop me a line.  They say they will 
answer any valid questions...oh, goody!  I assume asking about the guy's sex
life or why they make it so hard to get in the fone is PROBABLY the types of
questions they are trying to avoid.  If it's perverted, don't reply...I take
it back.  If the guy is a loser, I'll ask him anyway.  If the question is a 
hack question, try to phrase it in a way that it could be for LEGITIMATE 
reasons.  They are kinda funny about ESN hacking questions...go figure.

        Added Note:  Motorola is trying like hell to get their blue books 
back.  If you have one, don't mention to any cellular providers you have one.
They are taking names and other personal info and who knows what they are
doing with it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Before going in to the programming of the cellular phone, it is
important for the user to know the normal things necessary for day to day
operation.  While the majority of the stuff in the users manual is intended
for people that have problems programming their VCR, their are a few things
that are very important and are only mentioned in the users manual.

                          Turn On: [Pwr]
                           Unlock: Three digit unlock code.  If you make an

                                   [4], [Sto].

        I would like to add that while I have extensively worked on finding
additional test mode commands, I (and anyone else) have never worked with the
normal operation commands as listed above.  For example, above you will  
notice sequences with [Fcn], [1] or [Fcn], [0], [7].  This is totally
unexplored teritory.  Happy hacking :) 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:  Some units have dual NAM's.
        The ESN prefix is 130 decimal, 82 hex.
        Motorola: 1-800-331-6456

There are MANY different models of Motorola phones sold under various
brand names, if you think it's a Motorola, it probably is.

Determine which access sequence to use:

HAND HELD PORTABLE MODELS

If the phone has a FCN button and no MENU button use sequence 1.
If the phone has no FCN button use sequence 2.
If the phone has a MENU button and a FCN button use sequence 4.

INSTALLED MOBILE PHONES AND TRANSPORTABLE MODELS

If the phone has no FCN button and no RCL button use sequence 3.
If the phone has a FCN button use sequence 4.
If the phone has a MEM button use sequence 5.
If the phone has a RCL button and no FCN button use sequence 6.


SEQUENCE#     ACCESS CODE

1             FCN   (SECURITY CODE TWICE) RCL
2             STO # (SECURITY CODE TWICE) RCL
3             CTL 0 (SECURITY CODE TWICE) *
4             FCN 0 (SECURITY CODE TWICE) RCL
5             FCN 0 (SECURITY CODE TWICE) MEM
6             CTL 0 (SECURITY CODE TWICE) RCL

The default security code is 000000.  The CTL (control) button is the
single black button on the side of the handset.


NAM programing:

1.  Turn the power on.

2.  Within ten seconds enter the access sequence as determined above.

3.  The phone should now show "01" in the left of the display, this is the
    first programing entry step number.  If it does not the security code
    is incorrect, or the programing lock-out counter has been exceeded.  In
    either case you can still program the unit by following the steps under
    TEST MODE PROGRAMING below.

4.  The * key is used to increment each step:

    Each time you press * the display will increment from the step number,
    displayed on the left, to the data stored in that step, displayed on
    the right.  When the data is displayed make any necessary changes and
    press * to increment to the next step number.

5.  The SND key is used to complete and exit programing when any STEP
    NUMBER is displayed.

    If you have enabled the second phone number bit in step 10 below then
    pressing SND will switch to NAM 2.  Steps 01 thru 06, 09 and 10 will
    repeat for NAM 2, the step number will be followed by a "2" to indicate
    NAM two.

5.  The CLR key will revert the display to the previously stored data.

6.  The # key will abort programing at any time.


PROGRAMING DATA:

STEP#    #OF DIGITS/RANGE    DESCRIPTION

01       00000 - 32767       SYSTEM ID
02       3 DIGITS            AREA CODE
03       7 DIGITS            TEL NUMBER
04       2 DIGITS            STATION CLASS MARK
05       2 DIGITS            ACCESS OVERLOAD CLASS
06       2 DIGITS            GROUP ID (10 IN USA)
07       6 DIGITS            SECURITY CODE
08       3 DIGITS            LOCK CODE
09       0333 OR 0334        INITIAL PAGING CHANNEL
10       6 DIGIT BINARY      OPTION PROGRAMING (SEE NOTE 1)
11       3 DIGIT BINARY      OPTION PROGRAMING (SEE NOTE 2)


NOTES:

Take care with Motorola's use of "0" and "1".  Some options use "0" to
enable, some use "1".

1.  This is a 6 digit binary field used to select the following options:

    Digit 1:  Internal handset speaker, 0 to enable.
    Digit 2:  Local Use Mark, 0 or 1.
    Digit 3:  MIN Mark, 0 or 1.
    Digit 4:  Auto Recall, always set to 1 (enabled).
    Digit 5:  Second phone number (not all phones), 1 to enable.
    Digit 6:  Diversity (Two antennas, not all phones), 1 to enable.

2.  This is a 3 digit binary field used to select the following options:

    Digit 1:  Continuous DTMF, 1 to enable.
    Digit 2:  Transportable Ringer/Speaker, 0=Transducer, 1=Handset.
    Digit 3:  8 hour time out in transportable mode, 0 to enable.


On newer models, they have added and changed some numbers.  The numbers
as of the 3/27/92 manual are as follows:

1.  The 6 digit binary field is still the same.  

2.  The 3 digit binary field has become a 5 digit binary field.
    
    Digit 1:  Failed Page Indicator                        1=Disabled;0=Enabled
    Digit 2:  Motorola Enhanced Scan                       1=Enabled; 0=Disabled
    Digit 3:  Long Tone DTMF                               1=Enabled; 0=Disabled
    Digit 4:  Transportable Internal Ringer Speaker        1=Handset; 0=Transdcr
    Digit 5:  Eight Hour Timeout                           1=Disabled;0=Enabled



                              TEST MODE ACCESS:



INSTALLED MOBILE PHONES AND TRANSPORTABLE MODELS

To enter test mode on units with software version 85 and higher you must
short pins 20 and 21 of the transceiver data connector.  An RS232 break out
box is useful for this, or construct a test mode adaptor from standard
Radio Shack parts.

For MINI TR or Silver Mini Tac transceivers (smaller data connector) you
can either short pins 9 and 14 or simply use a paper clip to short the
hands free microphone connector.

HAND HELD PORTABLE MODELS:

There are two basic types of Motorola portable phones, the Micro-Tac series
"Flip" phones, and the larger 8000 and Ultra Classic phones.  Certain newer
Motorola and Pioneer badged Micro-Tac phones do not have a "flip", but
follow the same procedure as the Micro-Tac.

8000 & ULTRA CLASSIC SERIES:

If you have an 8000 series phone determine the "type" before trying to
enter test mode.  On the back of the phone, or on the bottom in certain
older models, locate the F09... number this is the series number.  If the
FOURTH digit of this number is a "D" you CAN NOT program the unit through
test mode, a Motorola RTL4154/RTL4153 programer is required to make any
changes to this unit.

Having determined that you do not have a "D" series phone the following
procedure is used to access test mode:

Remove the battery from the phone and locate the 12 contacts at the top
near the antenna connector.  These contacts are numbered 1 through 12 from
top left through bottom right.  Pin 6, top right, is the Manual Test Mode
Pin. You must ground this pin while powering up the phone.  Pin 7 (lower
left) or the antenna connector should be used for ground.  Follow one of
these procedures to gain access to pin 6:

1.  The top section of the battery that covers the contacts contains
nothing but air.  By careful measuring you can drill a small hole in the
battery to gain access to pin 6, alternately simply cut the top off the
battery with a hack saw.  Having gained access use a paper clip to short
pin six to the antenna connector ground while powering up the phone.

2.  If you do not want to "destroy" a battery you can apply an external 7.5
volts to the + and - connectors at the bottom of the phone, ground pin 6
while powering up the phone as above.

3.  You can also try soldering or jamming a small jumper between pins 6 and
7 (top right to lower left), or between pin 6 and the antenna connector
housing ground.  Carefully replace the battery and power up the phone.  Use
caution with this method not to short out any other pin.

4.  A cigarette lighter adaptor, if you have one, also makes a great test
mode adaptor as it can be disassembled to give you easier access to pin 6.
Many are pre marked, or even have holes in the right location.  This is
because they are often stamped from the same mold that the manufacturer
uses for making hands free adaptor kits and these kits require access to
the phone's connectors.


MICRO-TAC "FLIP" SERIES:

This phone follows similar methods as outlined for the 8000 series above.

Remove the battery and locate the three contacts at the bottom of the
phone, the two outer contacts are raised and connect with the battery.  The
center contact is recessed, this is the Manual Test Mode connector.

Now look at the battery contacts, the two outer ones supply power to the
phone, the center contact is an "extra" ground.  This ground needs to be
shorted to the test mode connector on the phone.  The easiest way to do
this is to put a small piece of solder wick, wire, aluminum foil or any
other conductive material into the recess on the phone.  Having done this
carefully replace the battery and turn on the power, if you have been
successful the phone will wake up in test mode.

GENERAL NOTES:

HANDSETS:  Most Motorola handsets are interchangeable, when a handset is
used with a transceiver other than the one it was designed for the display
will show "LOANER".  Some features and buttons may not work, for instance
if the original handset did not have a RCL or STO button, and the
replacement does, you will have to use the control * or control # sequence
to access memory and A/B system select procedures.



LOCK/UNLOCK PROCEDURES:

     Phones with "LOCK" buttons:  Press lock for at least 1/2 a second.

     Phones with a "FCN" button:  Press FCN 5, note that 5 has the letter's
                                  "J,K, and L" for lock.

     Phones with no FCN or LOCK button:  Press Control 5, control is the black
                                         volume button on the side of the
                                         handset.


SYSTEM SELECT PROCEDURES:

     Phones with a RCL button:  Press RCL *, then * to select, STO to store.

     Phones with no RCL button: Press Control * then * to select, # to store.

     Options are:    CSCAn:    Preferred/Non preferred with system lockout.
                     Std A/b, or Std b/A:  Preferred/Non preferred.
                     SCAn Ab, or SCAn bA:  Non preferred/Preferred
                     SCAn A:  "A" ONLY
                     SCAn b:  "B" ONLY
                     HOME:     Home only

     (these are typical options, some phone's vary.  C-Scan is only available 
     on newer models and does not appear unless programed, see below.)




                                 TEST MODE
    
    
    Taken from the July 1993 Cellular Subscriber Technical Training Manual
    Item# 68P09300A60-C and the Curtis Namfax vol.4.  I believe this is a
    complete listing of all the commands that were ever possible.  This 
    includes old phones and the new ones.  If there are two entries for a
    particular number, the first one is the current command and the second
    is for older models.

NOTE: Not all commands work on all telephones.  If a command is not valid the
      display will show "ErrOr."  Not all numbers have been assigned.  Not all
      numbers have been listed here.  Some commands were intended only for
      Motorola factory applications.   (This is the disclaimer in the
      technical training manual.  I have included all of the other commands I 
      have discovered one way or another.  I do believe this is a complete list
      of the commands.)
    

Three test commands are significant for programming and registering the
the telephone for service:  see full descriptions under TEST MODE COMMANDS.

32#  Clears the telephone.  (Older Motorola allowed either three or fifteen 
changes in the MIN.  After that, the phone had to be sent to Motorola to reset 
the counter.  This is the command they use.) 

38#  Displays the ESN

55#  This is the TEST MODE PROGRAMMING (as described below).


                          TEST MODE COMMANDS:


#    Enter Test Command Mode

00#  no function

01#  Restart (Re-enter DC power start-up routine.)  On TDMA telephones, this
     command has the same effect as pressing the PWR button.

02#  Display Current Telephone Status (This is a non-altering version of the
     STATUS DISPLAY.  On a 14 character display, all the information is shown.
     On a 7 character display only the information on the second line of a 14
     character display is shown.  On a 10 character display, all the 
     information on the second line of a 14 charcter display plus the last 
     three characters of the first line are shown.)

     STATUS DISPLAY, ALTERNATES BETWEEN:
     
     AAA BBB   AAA = Channel Number (decimal)    BBB = RSSI reading for channel
     CDEFGHI   are as follows:

     C = SAT frequency (0=5970, 1=6000, 2=6030, 3=no channel lock)
     D = Carrier (0=off, 1=on)
     E = Signalling tone (0=off, 1=on)
     F = Power attenuation level (0 through 7)
     G = Channel mode (0=voice channel, 1=control channel)
     H = Receive audio mute (0=unmuted, 1=muted)
     I = Transmit audio mute (0=unmuted, 1=muted)

     Press * to hold display and # to end.

03#  Reset Autonomous Timer.   This command results in the reset of the 
     autonomous timer but does not provide any test function on these models.

04#  Initializes Telephone to Standard Default Conditions:
     Carrier Off, Power Level 0, Receiver Audio Muted, Transmit Audio Muted,
     Signalling Tone Off, SAT Off, Resetting of Watch-Dog Timer Enabled, 
     DTMF and Audio Tones Off, Audio Path Set to Speaker

05#  TX Carrier On (Key Transmitter)

06#  TX Carrier Off

07#  RX Audio Off (Mute Receiver Audio)

08#  RX Audio On (Unmute Receiver Audio)

09#  TX Audio Off

10#  TX Audio On

11(Ch.No.)# Set Tranceiver to Channel xxxx (Receive and Transmit in Decimal;
            accepts 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits)

            see end of file for more info on this command

12x# Set Power Step to x; (0,1-7) 0=Maximum Power (3 Watts) 7=Minimum Power Out

13#  Power Off (Shuts off the radio)

14#  10 kHz Signalling Tone On

15#  10 kHz Signalling Tone Off

16#  Setup  (Transmits a five word RECC message; each of the five words will 
     be "FF00AA55CC33."  Transmitter de-keys at the end of the message.)

17#  Voice  (Transmits a two word REVC message; each of the two words will be
     "FF00AA55CC33."  Transmitter de-keys at the end of the message.)

18#  C-Scan  (Allows for entry of as many as 5 negative SID's for each NAM.)

     Newer Motorola phones are equipped with a feature called C-Scan, this is 
     an option along with the standard A/B system selections.  C-Scan allows 
     the phone to be programed with up to five inhibited system ID's per NAM.  
     This is designed to prevent the phone from roaming onto specified non-home
     systems and therefore reduce "accidental" roaming fees.

     1.  C-Scan can only be programed from test mode, power phone up with the
         relevant test mode contact grounded (see above).

     2.  Press # to access test mode.

     3.  Press 18#, the phone will display "0    40000".

     4.  Enter the first inhibited system ID and press *.

     Continue to enter additional system ID's if required.  After the 5th entry

     TEST MODE PROGRAMING:

     Assuming you have completed one of the above steps correctly the phone
     will wake up in test mode when you turn the power on.  When you first
     access test mode the phone's display will alternate between various status
     information that includes the received signal strength and channel number.
     The phone will operate normally in this mode.  You can now access Service
     Mode by pressing the # key, the display will clear and a ' will appear.
     Use the following procedure to program the phone:

     1.  Enter 55# to access programing mode.

     2.  The * key advances to the next step.  (NOTE that test mode programing
         does NOT have step numbers, each time you press the * key the phone 
         will display the next data entry).

     3.  The CLR key will revert the display to the previously stored data.

     4.  The # key aborts programing at any time.

     5.  To complete programing you must scroll through ALL entries until a '
         appears in the display.

     6.  Note that some entries contain more digits than can be displayed by the
         phone, in this case only the last part of the data can be seen.

        of mine lives in Canada and has Motorola Canada fones.  He says he
        has found that 99# is a possible command.  So if everyone could check   
        the "no function" command numbers and give me some feedback I would
        REALLY appreciate it.  Despite popular belief, I still say you can
        change ESN from the keypad with NO modifications, software, or opening
        the phone.

                   HACKING THE FOVC
 

Problem:  When listening to something interesting (a conversation),
just when that sexy sounding horny broad begins to give her
phone number to some lucky guy, HANDOFF!!! then static... DAMN!
 
Trick:    Hack the FOVC.
 
    a quick definition:  FOVC  = FOward Voice Channel
                         FOCC  = FOward Control Channel
                         REVC  = REverse Voice Channel
                         RECC  = REverse Control Channel
 
As the phone travels through cells, the FOVC is where the tower tells
the phone to adjust power levels for the current cell or to change to
a new channel for use in the new cell. This info can be hacked apart.
So. When you've found a good conversation, don't be lazy! Enter 40#!
This makes the phone listen for commands on the voice channel
(embedded in the audio portion- you can hear it as a "bump" sound). It
will just sit there and the display will read '40' , but the
conversation will still be audible.  Now when the phone receives a
FOVC command (a 40 bit sequence) data will flow across the display, in
hex format, and stop. Listen to the phone, if the conversation is
still there, then the command was only to adjust power levels. If the
conversation is gone, then its a handoff. If you only got a power
adjustment command just press # or clr,  which ever gets you back to
the ' prompt. Enter 40# and keep listening. You can also use the # key
to cancel the 40# command, if you want to change channels or something.
 
If it was a handoff, its time for some quick math. You have to convert
some of the numbers to binary, and then to decimal. I don't know how
many characters your phone's display will show. Mine only shows the
last seven of the ten hex digits. Count left from the end 6 digits.
Write down that digit and the next two on a piece of paper, ie:
 
 
    ???j16djjj    j=junk numbers  (hex numbers range from 0-9,a-f)
       / \
      these are lost due to scrolling
 
       write down  16d then convert it to a binary string:
 
       1 = 0001
       6 = 0110
       d = 1101    (d=13)
 
       now you have a binary string like this:  000101101101
       throw away the first 2 bits and get:       0101101101
       convert this to decimal and get:                  365
 
 
365 is the new channel the conversation has moved to! Enter 110365#
and voila! You too, can hear the horny babe's phone number!
 
Don't forget to enter 40# again, as the call may be moving quickly
through cells ( small cells or freeway driving ) or the call can get
bounced around by the tower for cell traffic purposes.
 
Here's one more example of the hex>binary>decimal conversion.
 
        ???j5aejjj
 
        5  =  0101
        a  =  1010
        e  =  1110
 
        full string        = 010110101110
        truncate 2 msb     =   0110101110
        convert to decimal =          430

     Word.  It seems that alot of bad cables are being sold by some lame asses
here on the west coast.  The result, alot of _rare_ LO phonez are being fried.
Welp,  this  file should clear things up.   Even if you've never made anything
but clay pots this should be easy for ya.  Take your time and this, along with
your phone will last a lifetime...

                      Parts:  (1) 550 Battery Eliminator
                              (2) IN4001 Diodes
                              (1) Head pins(single row straight stick headers)
                              (1) DB25/RS232 Connector for connection to LPT1
                              (1) METAL DB25 cover/protector
                              (1) 1 1/2 foot of 5 line ribbon
                              (1) jumper wire (be creative)

                      Tools:  Sizzors (I like sizzors for splicing wires)
                              Soldering Iron
                              Hot glue gun (borrow mom's)
                              Exacto knife (optional)
                              DMM w/continuity

     I'll try and be as  verbose as possible.   All  references to the plastic
part that connects the phone  to the cable will be known here as the  ADAPTER.
The hardest  thing to  find, at  least in  where I am, is a battery eliminator
that has all  8 pins on the  ADAPTER.   So if ya do have a cable  with all the
pins you can  skip this  paragraph.    What I did was to go  ahead  and  shell
out the 35 duckets for a battery  eliminator that only had pin's 7 & 8 (power)
on the ADAPTER.   Go to you  local electronix  shop and pick up a pack of head
pins. These  puppies are the EXACT same thing as what's in the ADAPTER,  'cept
their nickel instead of copper.  Cut 4 of them off the plastic but be carefull
not to bend them when you do so.

     Carefully pry off the  cover of the  ADAPTER  and use the exacto knife to
get the pins  and attatched  wires out of the  cover.   Otherwise  you'll  end
up  melting the  cover,  and trashing  the project.  Now  de-solder the  wires
connected to pins 7 & 8, wrap then with 2 of the ribbon's leads then re-solder
them  back to the  same pins.   Once  again,  be  carefull  not to  bend them.
Now  solder the other  4  ribbon lead to the pins 1, 4-6.   Now  carefully put
each  pin  back into the  ADAPTER cover,  if some of the holes are filled with
resin (batt eliminator),  simply push an  _extra_  bridge pin thru to get that
shit out!  Make a note of their colors, then take the  DMM and and go over all
the connections, making sure that no pin one pin on  the  ADAPTER is _touching
another:  1-4, 2-8, 4-6 ect...   * note that  pins 7 & 8 will show values from
due to the voltage regulator inside the ciggy plug.

    Fire up that hot  glue gun and  place some on the cover to make sure those
pins/ wires / solder don't move around  when ya put the ADAPTER back together.
Don't put too much on or you wont be able to close it.   Wait a min or 2 until
that dries, then throw some glue into the ADAPTER and quickly close it up.

    As for the DB25 you shouldn't have any trouble.  Just make sure you solder
the Diode to the wire before soldering it the the port.  Remember parallel pin
specs are not the same as serial!!

    The  following is a diagram of a  DB25 connector (soldering side). The "*"
marks the plain  wires,  "@" marks placement of the diodes,  and the "+" marks
where the jumper connects to the anode side of diode one:

     This cable  will work with the 6.6, 9.11 & 9.9 software.  This means that
without  a) AMPS  or  b) The Trick Clip  you'll need to find a Flip that has a
firmware  revision  equal to or below 9122.   A good  sign  that the  phone is
indeed a LO, is to check the ESN located on the  back and  look for any prefix
below A2A.   If  you can't locate the  ESN sticker, usually cause it's stolen,
then look  for a MCsquared printed along with the menu sticker.   If the phone
has the MC2 don't buy it.   If the phone doesn't  have the menu  sticker don't
buy it!  Also before you fork over the $$$ make sure that all the ports on the
phone are in good condition.

     Some people may experience  problems with 486 machines.  I'm looking into
slowing the shit down in order for the phone to respond.  One way is to divide
your  BIOS bus clock by 6,  another is to load a  TSR that actually slows your
CPU,  although I haven't yet  found this to work for me.   286-386  processors
work fine.  Short cables are a must!

I just thought I would lend a little help to those of you that may try and 
actually USE this schematic.  While _close_ to the actual pinouts... this
diagram will not work.

I have included corrections for the FLIP and the BRICK below, with 
the word [LOCKE] next to my corrections.  Sorry if I confuse anyone.

Anyway, I hope this helps, you CANNOT program the phones without
twisting/connecting the additional 19 & 20 DB25 connections.

Final Note:  I HAVE NEVER TESTED ANY OF THESE CABLE SPECS!!!  I REPEAT.  
             I HAVE NEVER TRIED ANY OF THESE CABLE SPECS!  THE USE OF THESE
             CABLES COULD DESTROY YOUR PHONE IF THE CABLES ARE MADE 
             INCORRECTLY.  Whether these specs are good or bad is news to me.
             So if someone could e-mail me to let me know one way or another I
             would be REALLY obliged.  The reason I have never tried these is
             because I HAVE NO DAMN SOFTWARE to use them with.  Someone 
             UUENCODE a copy of the newest Motorola software to me (unless it 
             is that crap floating around that only changes shit you could do
             with the above commands.  ESN changing software is what I need.)
             Anyone with experience in disassembling Motorola's software
             should e-mail me.  We need to get together.

I got this from a bbs in the (708) are code.  It had no name associated
with it.  Since NOONE has mailed me any other info on it, I will keep this
in the bible until someone bitches or sends me something tangible.
                                                                -ML

                              MOTOROLA "TRIK-CLIP"


This is the plans I recieved for the Flip.  Supposedly if one knew the
pinouts on the other moto phones one could transpose. (maybe!)  I never
tested this so I don't know if it works.  The chip in the flip the text
is talking about is a 32 pin square plcc

After Phone Disassembly Locate 27c512 Eprom on phone board.  This is
On The Upper Right Side Of The Display Next To The Roam Indicator.
This Is a 32 pin Square device.  **Note the dot and beveled edge
for pin orientation (the dot is pin 1) Count to the left
counter clock wise 2 3 4 5 and so on.  To the Right or clockwise
of the dot is pin 32 Vcc.  This will aid you in your count to find
pin 25 which is the eprom output enable.  This pin is at ground or
Vss - Level.  **Note Pin 25 on Eprom in phone must be lifted from
the phone board ground or Vss state.  Use an X-acto Knife and or
soldering iron and tools to cut pin at board level where pin
narrows.  Do not bend wide part of pin up on eprom as this could
break off of Eprom.  Also Wide Part of pin Will be used to make
contact with eprom test clip adapter.  The eprom test clip adapter
will take pin 25 to logic high through an 8 to 10 thousand
resistor to pin 32 Vcc.  This will Gate off all data Commands from
the phone board eprom and allow the eprom test clip adaptor to
take over.  **Note test clip could touch narrow part of cut off
pin on board and cause phone not to power up please remove or fold
down as low as possible so test clip only touches side of eprom.

After programing is complete put pin 25 back together or find a
suitable ground or Vss - source.  The phone will power up and work
without pin 25 put back together but for long term precaution
put back to a logic zero or ground to enable the output enable.

To use the eprom test clip adapter pull the locking wedge on the
test clip into the upper postition.  Seat the eprom test clip adapter
onto the eprom in the phone.  Make sure to orient the dot and
beveled edge with each other.  Push the locking wedge down to lock
the the eprom test clip adapter onto the eprom in the phone.  Hook up
the programing cable to the computer and plug into the jack on the
base of the phone.  Also hook up the loose lead with a jumper to the
center terminal between the battery contacts.  Turn power on green
light on phone display should come on thgen a complete display test
will light up after that the no service will blink along with the
signal level mark in corner of display.  If the antenna is still on
the phone it could change to roam or something else.  I  suggest
remove the antenna so the cell sight will not see you.  If you do
not get a power on test with the display there are 3 possible
things (1) pin 25 on phone board is touching the test clip this
can be checked by looking with a volt meter at pin 25 where
resistor connects for 4 to 5 volts pos with reference to ground.
(2) Test clip is not sitting on chip good some times you have pull
the test clip up off of the eprom a 64th of an inch all the way
around.  (3) there is corrupt data, Pull the eprom test clip off
Phone check to see if power on display is there.

Computer see if data or phone number or cell sight code or data
whole is ok I've seen the cell sight ID corrrupt and the phone play
dead on  the power on test. The test clip sometimes needs
maintenance look at the gold pins.

Make sure all the pins are level with the edge of it.  If not take
an X-acto or pin and lightly bend them out so they are along the
edge of the plastic of the test clip.

Always check to see if eprom in phone contacts are clean before
putting test clip on.  **Note when test clip is on phone - only
change the ESN only. *The other data phone number lock and so on
can be changed without the test clip and and should be done so.

The software version in the test clip is 9148 you will see this in
the right corner of the computer.  Sometimes the program will crash
during the ESN wright this will put all zeros in the ESN field
check the test clip try again.  Sometimes I've had to do this 3 an 4
times.  Also watch the phone display for codes I've seen at the end
of a wright the code (FO8) just before power down I've had no
problem there but during the key wright (FO8) means i've crashed.

Also during the time when the program is counting back into the
phone i've had (F1O) show up in the display of the phone this
problem means the next time you may not get the power on display
test pull test clip read phone check data to see if cell sight
code is corrupt or some other data correct try again.  A word of
caution do not push on eprom on top of test clip as this could
seat eprom lower into adapter and cause bad contact.  To remove
test clip pull locking wedge up to unlock the eprom test clip
adapter from the eprom in the phone.  Continue pulling up to lift
the eprom test clip adapter from the eprom in the phone.

DISCLAIMER:  I, Mike Larsen, accept NO responsibility for people using any
info within this text for fraudulant purposes.  I did not intend for the info
to be used towards fraud or theft of services.  The main reason I spent 
hundreds of hours creating and compiling this information is because 
programming fees are BULLSHIT and they know it.  If you notice, the 37#
command is no longer a mystery and Motorola is quite pissed I found out.  I
"engineered" it from a floor manager or some other head at the Motorola 
cellular division.  "Big Deal" you say.  Well, Motorola shipped Many flip
fones with that command set for a different battery.  After 10 minutes of use
the phone would die.  The phone had to be sent to Motorola to be "fixed."
        If you found this text useful, please mail something interesting or
just let me know you appreciated my efforts.  You can't believe how pissed
I was when I found out some lamer is changing the name in the text to his
own so people will like him or something.  Have fun.

Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention in the above disclaimer that I do
nothing fraudulant with MY fone.  I pay a bill and everything and can prove 
it.  So will the "feds" or whoever the Internet gestapo is that's been sending
me mail about me being under thier "watchful eye", please go for someone else
that's dealing child pornography or asking for WaReZ?  Thanks.
