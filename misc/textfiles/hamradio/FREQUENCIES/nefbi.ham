The following is a list of FBI Frequencies confirmed to be active within the
last 6 months.  Rhode Island, Mass., New Hampshire, and Maine operate as one
system controlled by Boston, MA.  Connecticut operates as a seperate system
controlled by New Haven, CT. Both systems use a PL Tone of 167.9 Hz.

Channel designations, if given, are for that system.

Both systems are still in the process of being changed so there may be future
additions or changes to this list. Also, I monitor mostly in Eastern
Connecticut and Rhode Island so there are probably more Repeaters in use in
other areas which are not included here.   Almost all Frequencies used as
repeater outputs can also be used as car-car simplex.

As you can see this is a big change from the old system in that the Repeater
Outputs are now the higher frequencies and the Inputs are low.

All Repeaters are computer controlled and have been cross linked in various
combinations.

I would be interested in sharing information with anyone who is interested in
Federal Monitoring in New England.  Our little group here is interested in
PERSONALLY CONFIRMED information such as Transmitter Locations, Input
Frequencies, PL Codes, other access codes, etc. Some of the information we
have is sensitive so please respond by U.S. Mail.
