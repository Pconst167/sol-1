 These frequencies have been confirmed by various sources including Monitor
 ing Times, Popular Communications, and friends. Frequencies that are the 
 same yet have been heard in other states, cities will have the state or city
 listed with it, plus the identifier for that certain area. If you would like
 to see some of the other files that I have or would like to leave your files
 with us, call us at The Hotline BBS 304-736-9169. This is a new BBS which I
 am running I have put this BBS up strictly for Scanner & Radio enthusiasts
 and  also for informational purposes on UFO's. A quick note about my Files,
 in the past they were made on an Apple type computer which did not add the
 line feeds or returns, IBM persons had trouble viewing them, I have now
 switched over all my files to meet the IBM standard, you can simply view 
 them by using  the Type command. Call us down here we offer many online 
 SIGS, our storage capacity is right around 3 gigabytes...
 When logging on The Hotline and filling out your new user status, there will
 be a question asked what your interest is in calling the Hotline, Please
 mark Scanner here and you will be taken care of STAT....

 A COUPLE QUICK NOTES ABOUT SOME OF THE FREQUENCIES
 ==================================================

 The Scrambling method used by Federal Angencies is DES, Digital Encryption
 Standard, this type of scrambling is found on certain type of Motorola
 equipment. Digital Encryption sounds like a bunch of tones and beeps and is
 quiet nerve racking, this type of scrambling is very hard to crack unlike
 Phase Inversion. DES uses a preset code that can be anything of about 
 10,000 different combinations. These combinations are changed periodically,
 the field agents may not even know the combination... Even if you would 
 happen to find a code which is unlikely you probably wouldnt hear it for
 long. The only way I can think about cracking it would be to have a 
 computer program that could sample the combinations super fast, even then
 it would take a considerable time to find them. 

 Now Phase inversion types of Scrambling is pretty easy to crack, note that
 it is against the law to make or own any type of descrambler that will         intercept police frequencies that are scrambled. Some companies are now 
 offering kits that you can build that work on phase inversion...
 Ramsey electronics is one of the companies. For more information concerning
 this and other companies and these types of kits and laws about there use
 leave me E-Mail.....
