                          JAS-1 Operating Frequencies

Mode JA uplink:   145.900 to 146.000 MHz
Mode JA downlink: 435.900 to 435.800 MHz.  (Inverting transponder)

Operating frequencies for Mode JA, the Mode J analog mode for SSB and CW, may
be determined as follows.  The sum of the uplink and downlink frequencies
equals 581.800 MHz exclusive of Doppler shift.  For example, if the uplink is
145.920 MHz, the downlink will be 435.880 MHz. Conversely, if you want the
downlink to be 435.810 MHz, you should set your uplink for 145.990 MHz.  In
both these examples, the sum of the uplink and downlink equals 581.800 MHz.

See the frequency correlation table.

The beacon will be 435.795 MHz.  When first activated at separation the beacon
will be sending 20 wpm cw telemetry. (See related telemetry story)

Mode JD, the digital Mode J, will be activated later this autumn.

                       JAS-1 Telemetry Format DelK9eated

JAS-1 telemetry transmission will commence immediately upon separation about
one hour after launch.  The beacon will be heard on 435.795 MHz exclusive of
Doppler shift.  The telemetry will be sent on Mode JA using 20 wpm CW.

The format of the the telemetry will be as shown in Table 1.  The characters
will be sent as three digit numbers in standard Morse.  Telemetry sends two
types of information:Š
    1) Numerical data relating to operating conditions such as temperature
    2) Status points such as beacon in PSK or CW

There are 30 data items and 33 status points monitored.  However, the beacon
transmits only 12 of the data items while transmitting all 33 status points.

Data items are contained in cells 1A through 3D in Table 1.  In each of these
12 telemetry cells, each data word is a 3 digit number, e.g. 175, where 1 is
the row number and 75 is the data content.  To convert the telemetered value to
engineering units, first ignore the most significant (left-most) digit. Then
divide the remaining two-digit number by 50 to obtain "N".  Then plug "N" into
the equation shown in Table 2.  For example, if 175 was sent in the 1D cell,
the value is calculated as follows:  175 discarding the 1 (row number) becomes
75.  Then 75/50 = 1.5 = N.  And from Table 2, for 1D, N * 4.92 = 7.38 volts.

Status points are coded in telemetry cells 4A through 5D.  As before, each cell
is sent as a three character decimal number.  To convert to status point
information, discard the row number (first character in each trio sent) Then
take the remaining two digit number and convert it to a three bit binary number
as in Table 3.  For example, decimal 423 is sent as cell 4A. Discard the row
identifier "4" leaving 23.  Convert 2 and 3 to binary: 010 and 011. Then butt
these two strings together thus: 010011.  Next, discard the left-most bit to
yield 10011.  This five-bit number denotes the status of the first five status
points as shown in Table 4.  The left-most bit is status point 5; then next is
status point 4, etc.  Thus, for this example, 423 converts to 10011 which
means:

  Point 5    1 = PSK on             {Left-most bit}
  Point 4    0 = (not used)
  Point 3    0 = (not used)
  Point 2    1 = JTD on
  Point 1    1 = JTA on             {Right-most bit}

Similarly, cell 4B codes status points 6 through 10; 4C codes 11 through 15;
etc.

Order of transmission is a raster scan, i.e., row 1, A through D; then row 2,
row 3, row 4.  Except for the "HI HI" frame sync, the telemetry is formed in a
4 by 4 matrix comprising 16 cells.  For example, 3C is a cell.

I have been asked to prepare the following information for the widest
possible dissemination by colleagues in JA-land in anticipation of the 
August 12 launch of JAS-1. This JAS-1 information is in three parts:
 
         Part 1 = CW telemetry information
         Part 2 = PSK telemetry information
         Part 3 = Information on JAS-1's Packet Radio Bulletin Board

Therefore   CW  telemetry  has 20 channels of data  and  each channel is made 
up of three digits.  The numbers 1 to 5 shown above indicate channel numbers, 
and each letter (A, B, C and D) stands for two digits. 
 
Channels  through  1A to 3D show analog data,   while the  rest  (4A  to  5D) 
indicate status points to be described below.Š 
***  The Analog Telemetry Data ***
 
Number  in  each  channel represents a   two  digit  DECIMAL number (i.e. in
the range 00 to 99).
 
example: 123  --->  number is 23 (decimal)  --->  N = 23.

The number in each channel represents two digit OCTAL  number, whose range is 
between 00 and 37 ( 0 to 31 in decimal,  00 to 1F in hexadecimal).  Therefore 
only  five  lower bits are valid as data.  Each bit  represents  the  various 
status shown in the followng table.
 
note: bit 0 is LSB (Least Significant Bit)
      bit 4 is MSB (Most Significant Bit)

***  Mailbox Commands [ Basic users training]  ***
    {W0RLI/WA7MBL equivalences added by W3IWI}
 
1.      Summary
 
  1.1   Available commands
 
        F : List files addressed to ALL or to current user
        H : Help
        K : Kill file(s)
        M : List file(s) to/from current user 
        R : Read file(s) 
        W : Write file
 
                       - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
  1.2   Command syntax
 
The    general  format is:    <a command letter>  <space>  <argument>.   
At  least  one  blank  is required  between  <a  command  letter>  and 
<argument>.
 
                       - - - - - - - - - - - - Š 
2.      Command Prompt
 
JAS-1    Mailbox    supplies   a prompt "JAS>" with no CR  nor  LF  to 
indicate that the system is ready to accept a command from the user.
 
A  user  can "type ahead" commands while JAS-1 is sending messages  or 
data to the user. JAS-1 will execute the commands in the waiting queue 
later. 
 
                       - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
3.      Commands
 
  3.1   The "F" command
 
F  =  FILES.  Shows the latest 10 files the first time it  is  entered 
during a session. Subsequent 'F' commands will list the next 10 active 
files (messages).  A message posted to multiple users has "*"  in  its 
'To:'  destination  field.  See also the "M" command described  below. 

     { The W0RLI/WA7MBL equivalent command is LL 10 the first time you 
       send an "F" }

Subj:   Automatic tracking system                         
 
Dear Saya,
Thank   you   for the compliments on the manual you  received   from   G3AAJ.  
Two  computers   are  now used--one for control of antenna  system,   radios,  
and   so forth  and  another one is used for the actual  data  capture.   The  
system   now  allows  several  satellites  to be  selected  and  data  ports,  
tracking  priorities,  modulation  mode,   and other things to be  associated 
with each.    I have  been working on a couple of articles describing the new 
system and would be glad to send you copies when I am finished. 
73, Robert. J. Diersing, N5AHD

Subj:   RS-232c card for PC-1089
 
Saya,
I  need  one more RS-232c card for my old faithful  PC-1089.  Would  you  ask 
Kanawa  san if he could still get one in Akihabara ?

  3.3   W [call1, call2, call3, ......, call7, call8]
 
W  =  Write.   Send  a message (file) to others.   As  many  as  eight 
destination  addresses can be  specified.   The  part  of the  command 
line  in  brackets [call1,  call2,  call3...] is optional.  A  message 
without specific destination is "public", i.e. addressed to "ALL".
 
The  JAS-1  mailbox will then prompt you to send the subject field  by 
sending  "Subj:".    You  can  send a subject field with up  to  a  32 
character string.   After receiving the "Text:" prompt,  you enter the 
message  text,  ending  each line with  <cr>  (carriage  return).  You 
terminate with either a 
 
               <cr>.<cr>
            or <cr> <ctl-Z> <cr>Š 
(i.e.  a line containing only a period or a control-Z) to the indicate 
end of your text. 
 
     {The  W0RLI/WA7MBL equivalent command is "S" except that multiple 
     addressees can be used.  Entering only W is equivalent to S ALL }
 
example:
 
JAS>W N7FDA
Subj: Roger, wait for a while.
Text:    
Miki,
Roger,   I'll immediately call him up and get an info for your "Main  Frame".  
I am going to put that info during next orbit.

  3.4   K <file#1>, <file#2>, <file#3>, ....., <file#7>, <file#8>
 
K  = KILL!  Delete file(s) (messages) specified by file  numbers.  The 
<file#>  is the same one described in R  command.   Up to eight  files 
can  be  specified in a command line.   A user can only  delete  files 
addressed solely to himself (i.e.  not to multiple users) or  files he 
posted.
 
     {The  W0RLI/WA7MBL  equivalent command is also  "K",  except that 
      multiple files can be killed at one time }

  3.5   H
 
H = HELP!  Entering H <cmd> gives additional information on that command.
Entering only H will give a list of all available commands.
 
                       - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
  3.6   M 
 
M  = Mine.  List the latest 10 files (messages) that are either to  or 
from  the current user.  Additional M commands list additional  active 
messages.  This  command will be useful to save channel time when  the 
user only wants to see his messages.
