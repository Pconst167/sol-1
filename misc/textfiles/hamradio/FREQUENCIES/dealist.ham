Many of these frequencies are new to me. I have monitored activity on:

5571.0 8912.5 11076.0 11288.0 12222.0 14686.0 18666.0 and 23403.0

All of these can stay pretty active, lower frequencies at night and higher by 
day. Punch these into your rig's memories and keep this list handy in case the 
activity shifts to one of the lesser used frequencies.
