APCO states that the numbering, sequence, words or word phrasing of the
below-listed signals may not be altered nor may the reserved signals be otherwise
implemented except by APCO. Any user may employ signal numbers upward, beginning
with 10-40, as needed for local dispatching. RCMA publishes this listing in support
of APCO and their uniform dispatch code efforts. We will print other dispatch

Rescue squads are mentioned as 'pager numbers' when toned out.
Dispatch was recently moved from 155.43 (Sheriff) to 158.76 (Fire).
Each of the four squads also has a unique series of unit numbers.
Agency frequencies are generally for squad business, and calls are
not toned out here.

In lieu of no input, the following news item is offered for you cellular phone
listeners. As I write this column on June 19th, the FBI has advised a Virginia
Republican Party official that his presence may be required at a federal grand jury
hearing in Norfolk on the 21st. At issue is a taped cellular phone conversation of
Gov. Douglas Wilder, monitored in the Hampton Roads area in 1988 as the then-
Lieutanant Governor was riding in the back of a State Police car, gloating to a
crony about negative publicity surrounding US Senator Charles Robb.
Robb had admitted that his office was in posession of the tape for over two years,
but that he had neither listened to it nor divulged its contents. (a transcript had
been mysteriously leaked to and printed by the Washington Post) Robb insists that
the tape was made by a hobbyist and sent to him anonymously.
Not only is the Federal Government investigating, but the State Attorney General
has expressed an interest in prosecuting the tape's originator under Virginia's
wiretap law, which makes the interception of telephone calls a Class 6 Felony  i.e.
up to 5 years in prison.
Robb's staff destroyed the tape before he publicly admitted possessing it, and no
known copies exist. See you next month.

Hello, and welcome to PSNE for September. We once again are lucky enough to have
a whole pile of information this month and so I will not take up too much space
here. I would just like to say that I will be finishing up the member surveys over
the next couple of months since there are not too many left.

Keep those cards and letters coming. Come on gang, I know we have only 20 some odd
members in Delaware, but I'm sure people in Southeastern PA, South Jersey, and
Maryland listen to DE. We have friends in different fire companies and so on who
can give us information. Please, this is your column, send input. To date I have
only received information from a member in Wisconsin. I have a rather extensive DE
listing, but some of it is old or little used frequencies that I don't catch on my
travels. Therefore I am not sure that they are in use. I need your help.

As of July 1st Brewster Ambulance Service has taken over the dispatch of Boston Med
Flight. Although most dispatch is done by a combination of pager and telephone they
may be heard on the Brewster Ambulance Dispatch frequency of 155.175 tone 91.8.
Brewster has left the 800 Mhz trunked system that they had been using for the past
few years. Problems with coverage of the system reportedly lead to the change. The
new transmitter is reported to be located on a building in downtown Boston and has
a great signal well down into Rhode Island and up to parts of New Hampshire.
Brewster also provides the ground transport from landing sites to the hospitals for
Med Flight within the Boston area.

Twin State Fire Mutual Aid
Twin State Fire Mutual Aid consists of several towns in Grafton County N.H., and
a few towns in the Vermont counties of Calendonia and Orange. The dispatch
frequency is 154.400 with a P/L of 136.5. Littleton FD uses a repeater on 453.05
for operations after dispatch on high band. An unconfirmed and seldom referenced
fireground channel may exist on 154.295. 
The Twin State signal can be heard in deep southern N.H. more often than not on a
outside antenna. This allows for some home base info gathering. Certain details
were obtained while vacationing in the area. A scanner and a VOX recorder allowed
me to scan the area without annoying my wife Debbie. However, since I can't hear
everything from here, nor vacation as often as I please, I would greatly appreciate
updates, and corrections. Data from northern N.H., including Conway would be
appreciated.

NEW YORK STATE
AE: Joe Nooney

From Mark - NY ??, some information on the new Nassua County 800 MHZ Trunked
system. The system seems to have been paid for by the Federal Government under a
program to update county local government communications. The system is not fully
operational yet, but the current frequency plan appears to be as follows.

866.3375, 866.5875, 866.9125, 868.4250, 868.5625

Agencies that are now on the system include. County Executive, Board of
Supervisors, Department of Public Works, Department of General Services,
Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority, Fire Commission (Fire Marshal and HazMat),
Department of Health. The Sheriff's Department, Correctional Center, and County
Medical Center are on 866.8375 and 867.1625. Low powered repeaters are in use on
these two frequencies. Control channels are currently 866.1875 and 867.1125. It is
expected that other county agencies will join the system including Department of
Recreation and Parks. It is also probable that as more Departments join the system
more channels will be activated.
Also in Nassua County several of the volunteer fire departments have equipped their
Chief (00) and/or First Deputy Chief (01) vehicles with Cellular Phones, primarily
for Emergency Management Communications. Some departments have also equipped their
01 and 02 vehicles with 153.830 "fireground".

Welcome to this month's column. Labor Day weekend is at hand  time for those last
summer trips before Fall. Be sure to keep your scanner tuned to those state and
county PD frequencies. They will be busy! Now, on to this month's offerings.

Thanks to Jim, OH-237, who was the only Ohio member who had time to send us a scoop
this month.

INDIANA
AE: David Nugent
Input for the column has been as scarce as the raindrops. Indiana State Police's
800 trunked system should come on line next in the Terre Haute area. It was placed
up for bidding on May 3, 1991 and bidders have 30 days to reply. Word is that GE
and Motorola are submitting bids for the project. Part of the funding for this
system will be provided by Uncle Sam. The Newport Army facility located in the
district required some new communications equipment so it appears that ISP,
Vermillion County and Parke County will join the Army in this endeavor. 
Vigo County Sheriff's Department has installed 2 new Motorola Centra Comm II
consoles. Frequencies are 155.565 output and 158.910 input.
That's all for this month from Indiana.

ARKANSAS
AE: Peter Laws
EXTRA! EXTRA! NW Arkansas gets EMS Helicopter! Springdale Memorial Hospital is host
to a Medical helicopter owned by a Missouri firm. The company, Air Evac, of West
Plains, MO, plans to offer subscriptions to local area residents. Non-subscribers
would be billed for the service as with a ground Ambulance. The copter will be
staffed with a Paramedic and a Nurse, as well as a pilot. The company also has
aircraft in West Plains and Cape Girardeau, MO. Sorry, no freqs yet!
Back to school already!! Hope everybody had a good Summer. By the time you read
this I expect that ASP Troop L will be on the 800 MHz system. I can hear occasional
tests as I write this (June 30). Harrison's barracks seem to be using the system
all the time. Data is always on 860.xxxx, voice on 859.xxxx, and phone patch on
858.xxxx. I believe this is similar Statewide. 
The various transmitter sites are connected to Little Rock via microwave links in
the 1.8 to 2.2 GHz range. The same frequencies are being looked at by several large
electronics firms, Apple Computer among them, for use by a new generation of
cellular-type phones. The band is currently reserved for Public Safety use. The FCC
is studying the proposal, and our State Police, as well as Sen. Dale Bumpers
(D-Ark.), plan to oppose the reallocation. The state estimates added costs of up
to $100 million (!!) if the change goes through. 
This month's list has information from Larry AR-033, and a member who wished to
remain anonymous. J.B., AR-032's submission will be in next month's issue.

Public Safety and Special Emergency frequencies, radio system details & questions
for Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North and South Dakota to:


Greetings, folks  hope it's not too hot to monitor! Hope you have been taking that
scanner along on those weekend outings and trips and will let us know what you have
heard. 
The column originally intended for July appeared in August because of a mishap in
transmission on the California end of things.  My apologies for the absence of your
favorite (?) column a couple of months ago. We all enjoy the RCMA Journal but few
really know how much hard work, most without paid salary, goes into the best
monitor1ng publication there is. We're human, we make mlstakes, and we're sorry for
the inconvenience
As some of you go back to school, either as students, teachers, or other school
employees, remember that many school districts use radio to communicate from school
to school and between maintenance personnel. Most districts with school buses use
radio, and with a little in-vestigation, you can locate the frequencies in your
school district. They can make for some interesting listenlng and, of course, our
readers would like to know what you hear. Some of them use unique ten-codes 
and some sound very unconventional. Look in the business bands and on the VHF
"special emergency" channels between 155.160 and 155.400 Mhz. In the St. Louis
area, they are everywhere, from 31.00 Mhz. to UHF business band to 800 Mhz. Check
those PL tones, too!

Greetings and welcome to Missouri.
The St. Louis Major Case Squad is a highly elite team of police investigators who
respond from their multiple jurisdictions when a major crime occurs in a municipal
venue. The unit responds in a converted motor home stored at the Florissant Police
Departnent.  Communications are primarily done on cellular phones and notification
is by pager, but they do have some VHF high band radios on these frequencies:
154.725        Co-ide Emergency
155.730        State Sheriff's Net
155.475        Mutual Aid
155.055        Illinois I.R.E.A.C.H
The unit also responds in Illinois.

JAMES (MO-134) provides these frequencies for the St. Charles City trunked system
(somehow missed in Police Call): 856.2625, 857.2625, 858.2625, 859.2625, 860.2625
This covers all city operations including fire, and they are adding "talkaround"
in the near future.

Send in your verifications, comments, frequencies, observations, etc. Your comments
are always welcomed, and please send a S.A.S.E. for a reply. See you next month!

I hate to start the September column on such a sad note, but the day I was
preparing this a chopper that belonged to the LAPD was on routine patrol and at
around 11:22 in the morning went down due to engine failure.
There were three fatalities, two being officers, so I would like to dedicate this
column to all the officers who valiantly respond in the sky: the Air Support Units
of our nation's law enforcement agencies. (Just as a side-note: according to the
LAPD, a chopper can replace 200-300 officers on the ground.)

Usually I like to end the column on a funny note each month, but this month I will
diverge from that, We should be indebted to the people of the Police and Fire
Departments and Office of Emergency Services for their unfailing dedication to
their work so our lives can be a little safer in time of disaster. I think a real
word should be said about the Sierra Madre Fire Dept, they did just such a great
job and, if you can believe this, it is ALL-VOLUNTEER!!
Please keep monitoring and listening and send all Southern California contributions
to my address. Hopefully by the next column we will Have an Associate Editor For
Northern California.
So keep up the monitoring until our October column.

Last month we reported on the new road channels that Southern Pacific is planning
to implement. Now we've received an unconfirmed report that the changeover has been
put on hold until further notice. We'll keep you informed as more information
becomes available. In the meantime, it would be a good idea to monitor the new road
channel that is proposed for your area and let us know if it becomes active.
Mike (NC-120) wrote again about the Camp Lejeune (NC) RR. He was able to catch up 
with the train and noted that the locomotive was lettered "USMC 270092" so
apparently the trackage of the former Southern Railway subsidiary has been taken
over by the Marine Corps. Mike noted an 18-inch antenna but the crew didn't know
what frequency their radios operate on. In looking over maps of the area from
various years past, Mike noted different railroad names for the same stretches of
track at different times. The various names come about as a result of railroad
mergers, and we get questions about it from time to time, so let's go over the
histories of the two major systems in the southeast, starting with CSX
Transportation. CSX was formed by the merger of the Chessie System railroads
(Baltimore & Ohio and Chesapeake & Ohio) with Seaboard System Railroad. Earlier,
Seaboard System was formed by the merger of Seaboard Coast Line with Louisville &
Nasville, Georgia RR, Clinchfield RR, Atlanta & West Point, and Western Railway of
Alabama. Going back in time still further, to 1968, Seaboard Coast Line was formed
by the merger of Seaboard Air Line and Atlantic Coast Line railroads. The other
major system in the southeast is Norfolk Southern, which was formed by the merger
of Southern Railway with Norfolk & Western. Actually these two railroads still
exist as subsidiaries of Norfolk Southern Corp., but their locomotives are being
repainted and lettered Norfolk Southern.
In another followup to last month's column, John (nonmember) reports that Kansas
Southwestern was using 160.680 (a Union Pacific yard channel) in May but by June
had its own frequency, 160.995. Switching has been heard on the latter but no
dispatching; they may have another channel for that.
Adding to Gary's report last June on Ft. Wayne IN, Norfolk Southern uses 160.515/
161.235 for its PBX (they call it ARN). Indiana Hi-Rail uses 160.695 for dispatcher
and road, and just started using 160.590 for switching.
Kevin (CA-SF-016) sent a newspaper article telling of the planned construction of
a track connection to link NJ Transit's Morris and Essex lines to Amtrak's
northeast corridor line. The connecting track, in Kearny NJ, will allow commuter
trains from Morris, Essex, Union, and Somerset Counties in New Jersey to operate
directly into Amtrak's Penn Station in New York City, eliminating the need for
passengers to change trains at Hoboken. The project is to be completed in 1995.
An anonymous contributor sent an article from the Boston Herald telling of an
incident on Amtrak's Colonial in which the engines uncoupled from the train near
New London CT. The train and engines stopped without injury and the cause was under
investigation.

AMTRAK AND METRO-NORTH ROAD CHANNELS
by CARL (NY-117) and RICK (IL-496)
Amtrak now uses Metro-North's road frequency between Poughkeepsie NY and CP 12
which is the new Empire Connection. [Ed Note: beginning April 7 all Amtrak trains
that had been using Grand Central Terminal in New York City switched to Penn
Station. They run over a rebuilt freight line between Penn Station and CP 12 at
Spuyten-Duyvil, where they enter and leave Metro-North trackage.] This means that
between Albany and New York City Amtrak trains use four frequencies. Leaving Albany
they are on Conrail 1 (160.800), south of milepost 130 (near Selkirk branch jct.)
they use Conrail 2 (161.070), from Poughkeepsie to CP 12 (Empire Connection) they
use Metro-North 1 (161.280) and from CP 12 to New York Penn Station they use Amtrak
1 (160.920).
Metro-North Commuter RR is planning to implement new channel assignments. [When?
-ed.] Presently, all three branches (Harlem, Hudson, and New Haven) are dispatched
on the same channel [161.280]. Dispatching is done remotely through local
transmitters from 42nd Street in Manhattan (near but not in Grand Central
Terminal). The dispatchers are covering each other's transmissions, so multiple
channels will be used.

Police radios will have a different configuration. Metro-North does have other
channels that are used for power, the shops, and Grand Central Terminal. At this
point it is unknown if these will change.
[Obviously the road channel changes will affect Amtrak, whose trains operate over
Metro-North's Hudson and New Haven lines. In our June column we reported that
Amtrak had changed to 160.920 between Boston MA and Providence RI. Rick says that
as of April 7 the change had not yet occurred. -ed.]

LOS ANGELES METRO RAIL
by BILL FARMER (CA-VE-010)
In June we mentioned new UHF channels for the Blue Line light rail transit system.
With the help of a frequency counter we've determined that there is only one new
channel, 472.4875/475.4875. It is called "Yard Control" and is used for movement
of LRVs in the yard area. The road channel remains 471.3375/474.3375.
Some changes on the VHF radios have taken place since our report in June. The
channels are now arranged as follows:
160.425/160.635               Ch 1                Track, Power, & Signals

MONITORING WITH COMMERCIAL GRADE EQUIPMENT

Quite a few RCMA members have responded to my request for information on members
who monitor with used commercial communications radio gear as opposed to (or in
addition to) standard consumer monitoring equipment. While it seems that only a
small minority of RCMA members use commercial gear as part of their monitoring
shack, I am willing to bet that many more would use commercial gear if they were
aware that it offers a viable alternative or supplement to consumer "scanner-type"
equipment. 
The first question one might ask is what is "commercial equipment"? Commercial
equipment is simply radio communications gear designed for private business or
public uses, principally two-way communications. Occasionally commercial equipment
includes single or multiple frequency monitors (capable only of receiving). I am
unaware of any commercial "scanner" although they may exist.
The next question might well be, what's so special about commercial equipment? The
simple answer is that commercial equipment usually performs better and sounds
better than consumer grade equipment. Commercial equipment generally performs
better for a number of reasons. First, the equipment is generally manufactured with
higher quality components than consumer equipment. With commercial equipment,
manufacturers compete to offer state of the art components and performance. In
consumer equipment, there appears to be an unwritten conspiracy among manufacturers
to accept the lowest common denominator as the status quo. 
Second, commercial equipment is much more durable and ruggedly constructed. Just
compare the casing on the typical commercial mobile rig to that on your favorite
scanner. Rugged construction adds years of life to a radio, whereas cheap
construction exposes the internal components to a higher risk of damage.
Third (and most importantly), commercial equipment is designed to comply with much
more rigorous performance specifications than consumer equipment. The assumption,
probably a correct one, is that two-way communication is more critical than casual
monitoring. In fairness to some consumer equipment, it is difficult and expensive
to build a wide frequency range, multi-channel radio receiver that meets high
performance specifications over the entire range of frequencies; it is relatively
easier to build a high performance radio that simply is limited to a single band
and a limited number of channels.
RCMA members report using a variety of commercial equipment for monitoring
purposes. Many use old two way gear. Most use old mobile equipment. Some use old
transceivers. Some use handheld portable.
By far the most common manufacturer represented is Motorola. The next most common
is General Electric. Other names mentioned include Plectron, and Johnson.
By this point you are probably wondering whether there are any downsides to the use
of commercial equipment. The answer is "yes". New and even relatively new
commercial equipment is extremely expensive. Those state of the art components
don't come cheap! For the most part, the only used commercial gear that is within
the budget of most monitoring hobbyists is at least five years old. Moreover, these
units often represent discontinued lines or models.
Aside from expense, there are some other downsides to using commercial gear for
your monitoring. Commercial equipment is typically limited to a single or small
number of channels, and always to a single band. Commercial equipment looks like,
well . . . "commercial," "functional."
Don't expect a lot of bells and whistles with your commercial rig. You are likely
to get three controls: an on/off switch, a squelch control and a volume control.
The final drawback is the lack of widespread availability. Commercial equipment can
often be purchased at hamfests and conventions. Another good source is your local
commercial radio repair shop. Many of these shops will be happy to sell you used
equipment, and some will even sell you some new stuff off the shelves. Their
motivation is primarily public goodwill. Take heed of one piece of advice; remember
that a commercial radio shop that offers to sell you a piece of equipment is doing
you a tremendous favor; don't take them for granted, and don't act as if they have
to sell you some equipment, because they clearly don't.
I will describe two pieces of used commercial equipment that I own. One is a single
channel Motorola desk top monitor. It is about the size of a scanner and I have it
crystalled to receive the Georgia State Patrol base transmitting station on 154.680
MHz. This unit is probably at least ten years old, but it performs like a dream.
Its sensitivity is better than any other radio I own (including the ICOM). For such
a relatively small unit, it has loads of volume (about 5 watts). My other
commercial piece is a Motorola voice pager, which is about the size of a pack of
cigarettes. I have it crystalled to receive the Atlanta Fire Department Dispatch
on 154.190 MHz. This little unit is a dream. The volume is louder and less
distorted than any portable scanner that I have ever heard. Its sensitivity was
tested to be about a .25 uV for 20db SINAD. I also own several mobile speakers from
Motorola. These cost me a fraction of what a good external speaker designed for
amateur equipment would cost, and they sound just as good. These speakers are good
because they are designed to perform well in a noisy environment. Their speaker
configuration is such that the speaker rejects or attenuate frequencies well above
or below the range of the human voice, particularly higher frequencies (which have
been found to cause listener fatigue or stress). Because of the attenuation of high
frequencies, the background hiss (which is generally higher pitch than the typical
range of the human voice) that occurs with a weak radio signal is much less
apparent on one of these commercial grade external speakers. 
I will share some comments from Allan (RI-038) regarding his commercial equipment,
because I think that Allan's enthusiasm about sums up the great benefits of
searching long and hard for a good piece of commercial gear. Alan writes: 
"I recently purchased a used Motorola business dispatcher (CMT-3100) two way VHF
High Band radio for monitoring the Warrick, Rhode Island Fire Department on 154.310
MHz and the PL tone of 162.20. The transmitter was disabled by the out of state 2
way radio shop I purchased the set from. There is only one way to describe the
performance of this unit  "awesome." Since this radio is equipped with Motorola's
Private Line, I get no intermod or any other form of interference. The audio output
is extremely crisp and clear. I also own a Bearcat 760 XLT with a CTCSS tone board.
The Bearcat radio pales in comparison to my Motorola unit in regards to audio
quality and clarity. Even with the tone board on the Uniden radio, I still get some
intermod. The only drawback to the Motorola unit is that it is only a single
channel unit. In addition, I would say that my Motorola unit is about 20 years old,
but it still works extremely well. According to the shop where I purchased the
unit, the Motorola radios will almost last forever. In fact when Motorola installs
a new radio system they will take back the customer's old units which they destroy
since they do not want the old equipment on the market. . . . I also own a used
General Electric Master Pro External speaker which I purchased from a local 2 way
shop for only $12.50. I suspect that the speaker is worth over $50. This speaker
is hooked up to my Uniden 760 XLT and is a vast improvement over the built-in
speaker."
Thanks for the great letter Allan. Allan also expressed an interest in purchasing
additional commercial equipment through a buyer's network. If other members have
an interest in swapping information about sources of commercial equipment, please
let me know and I will informally circulate this information.
On a related matter, there is a limited amount of radio equipment that is available
to public consumers that is designed to meet professional specifications. This kind
of equipment is known as "commercial grade" equipment. The ICOM R-7000 is an
example. While anyone can walk into an ICOM retailer and buy an ICOM R-7000 (anyone
with $1,000 or so, that is), this unit is also frequently sold to commercial users
as well.
Speaking of commercial grade specifications, Allan (RI 038) also enclosed a spec
sheet for his Motorola CMT-3100. Consider some of the following specs: sensitivity 
.35 uv EI-SINAD, .5 uv for 20db quieting; spurious and image rejection  86 db;
squelch sensitivity  .25 uv; audio output  5 watts at less than 5% distortion;
selectivity more than -90 db at 15 kc (plus or minus)!
