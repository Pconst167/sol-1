                             BUGGING FREQUENCIES
                             -------------------

 There has been an increase in the use for using wireless transmitters not
 only by Law Enforcement Agencies but for private gain of information. Big
 companies bug there competition to find out about new products and such,
 husbands/wives bug each other to find out if the other is having an affair,
 and so on. Wireless transmitters are not only used for these purposes you 
 can find them in use by your local preacher at church, or entertainers while
 on stage and so forth. Put these freq's in your scanner and drive around and
 see what comes up.

 According to the Pop Com July 89 article, there has been an increase in the
 use of Cellular Phones for the purpose of surveillance, mostly by Federal
 Agencies and larger Police Depts.

 If you have any updates or comments on surveillance frequencies, call us
 down here at The Hotline MBBS, we have around 3 gigabytes of power with
 our two nodes combined, Special interest groups include Scanner & Radio Sig,
 a UFO SIG and plenty of others. Our Scanner SIG & File area has many Files
 pertaining to Scanner & Radio related topics..

 The Hotline BBS 304-736-9169 

 I would like to thank the Medic from Las Vegas and GEnieScan for there
 contributions to this file.  

 A few ideas: Drive around with these freqs in your scanner, bugs use low 
 wattage so you will have to be pretty close to monitor. Another idea is the
 next time a concert comes to town, get as close as you can to the arena and
 search through these bands, this could also be done at stage shows, etc. Let
 me know how ya do.
