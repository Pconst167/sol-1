A COUPLE QUICK NOTES ABOUT SOME OF THE FREQUENCIES
==================================================


WHEN IN THE SCAMBLED MODE , THEY USE DIGITAL ENCRYTION SYSTEM , WHICH ON THESE
MODELS ARE , MADE BY MOTOROLA. DIGITAL ENC. SOUNDS LIKE TONES OR BEEPS AND IS
NOT VERY EASY TO DESCRAMBLE , REASON BEING , IS THAT IT IS NOT PHASE INVERSION
THE SYSTEM USED BY SHERIFFS AND OTHERS , DIG. SCRAMBLING USES A PRESET CODE
ON EACH UNIT THIS NUMBER RANGES , SAY 10,000 DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS COULD BE
USED. SO THAT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD JUST SIMPLY HAVE TO TRY EACH AND EVERY POSS
IBLE COMBINATION. THIS WOULD TAKE CONSIDERABLE TIME. PLUS THE FACT THAT THEY 
ARE MORE OR LESS CHANGED PERIODICALLY. WHAT YOU WOULD NEED TO DO IS HAVE SOME
TYPE OF PROGRAM THAT COULD SAMPLE EACH COMBINATION AT VERY FAST RATES. IF YOU
ARE INTERESTED IN SCRAMBLING YOUR COMMUNICATIONS , BE IT THE PHONE LINES , TWO
WAY RADIO , ETC. PALOMAR MAKES A NICE PHASE INVERSION , CURRENTLY BEING DISCON
TINUED. OR THE DIGITAL ENCRYPTION SYSTEM ALSO MADE BY PALOMER THIS UNIT SELLS
FOR AROUND 400.00. NOTE THAT PHASE INVERSION IS PRETTY EASY TO CRACK , YOU 
COULD EVEN RECORD FULL SESSIONS OF A PHASE INVERTED CONVERSATION , AND THEN 
LATER DESCRAMBLE IT FROM YOUR RECORDER.
