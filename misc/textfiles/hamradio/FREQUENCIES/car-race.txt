
       Here's a list of frequencies compiled from several sources.  The ones
with "TRUE" at the end are the ones I've confirmed at a racetrack as "in use".
If you have any frequencies, send them to me so I can try to keep this list up
to date.  (If you know of any frequencies no longer in use, let me know of
those also.)  Send additions, corrections, comments, questions, sane or insane
remarks to: RIS-Keith Patti, 76347,3064.

       In general, track frequencies usually stay the same from year to
year.  Team frequencies seem to change almost every year.  This form of
"spectating" (using a scanner at a race) is becoming more popular so, look
for other spectators with scanners at the track and ask them for the
frequencies you need.  Don't bother officials or corner workers (unless you
know them personally) as their "two-way" radios don't usually have the
frequencies displayed, like most scanners do, and it's extremely unlikely
that these people would know the frequencies they're using.
       When using a scanner, one must always remember they're listening in
on _PRIVATE_ communications.  Although the FCC allows us to listen to these
transmissions, all we can do is listen.  It is _illegal_ to act on information
received in this manner.  This includes repeating, recording or reporting
anything you've heard.
       I use a scanner at almost every race I go to.  Many times I have to
"bite my tongue" because I've heard an interesting tidbit on the radio but,
I can't use it in my reports.  Although the communications are private, the
frequencies are public knowledge, so it's not illegal to give out frequencies.
       If you are planning to buy a scanner, be sure it has the capability to
search through a range of frequencies.  Most of the better scanners have this
capability.  With this feature, you'll be able to find new frequencies,
without having to rely on a list.
       The latest thing in racing radios is the 800 mHz band.  At this time,
only the more expensive scanners have this band.  You can usually determine
the frequency band the antenna.  The _shorter_ antennas are the _higher_
frequencies.  For example, an 800 mHz radio's antenna is usually only two or
three inches long.  A longer antenna (4-8 inches) would be for 400 mHz, which
most scanners can receive.  The longer (more than one foot) antennas would be
for either 150 mHz or CB (28 mHz).  All frequencies above 30 mHz are FM, below
30 mHz is usually AM.  Most scanners won't receive below 30 mHz.
       Some states have laws against using a scanner in a vehicle unless
you're a member of a police or fire department, or have a permit.  If you want
to use your scanner in your car, check on the local laws.
