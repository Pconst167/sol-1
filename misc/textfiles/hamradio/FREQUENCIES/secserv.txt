US Secret Service frequencies
-----------------------------

Routine transmissions will probably be in the clear.  If the President
is in town, expect transmissions to be DES encrypted (try the local
police departments and media in this event).

Chuck Gysi (scan911@aol.com) has suggested the following for CTCSS-
capable scanners, in order to eliminate receiving DES transmissions:
set the CTCSS tone to 103.5 Hz.  This only opens the receiver for
'in-the-clear' transmissions.
