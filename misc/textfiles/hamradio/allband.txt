                   ALL-BAND TRANSMIT MODIFICATIONS


   During a widespread emergency, it may become necessary to transmit on
specific frequencies to signal for help or to pass emergency radio
traffic.  These frequencies might be monitored by the Civil Air Patrol,
the National Guard, United States Coast Guard, the military, or other
public safety agencies.

   The well-equipped survival station should have complete access to
receive all frequencies on the shortwave band, as well as many
frequencies in the VHF and UHF spectrum.  Modern worldwide amateur radio
epuipment not only tunes in the ham bands, but also allows for general
coverage receive, and with modification, general coverage transmit.
Modern VHF and UHF ham radio walkie-talkies also allow for VHF and UHF
public safety band receive as well as public safety band transmit with
the proper modification.

   Before we get into modification details, let me first point out that
using frequencies without FCC authorization could result in stiff
penalties.  This could include imprisonment, a $10,000 fine for every
day you are transmitting on the air, and the confiscation of your
equipment.  The only time you are allowed to use frequencies that you
are not authorized is in a real emergency when safety of life or
protection of property is an immediate threat.  Possessing equipment
that has been modified and is capable of transmitting outside of normal
ham radio band limits is not necessarily illegal--but just as soon as
you press the microphone in a non-emergency situation outside of your
authorized frequencies, this indeed is not allowed.  Just remenber that
operating on frequencies without specific FCC authorization is simply
not legal except in an emergency.

   The popular Yaesu 757 high frequency transceiver is easily modified
for all-band transmit.  Simply locate the tiny white switch that is
hiding under a wire bundle inside the top front of the set near the
frequency selector mechanism.  Simply slide the switch in the opposite
direction, and your transmitter is now unlocked.

   Yaesu 2-meter hand-helds are not capable of going beyond their normal
2-meter range, well outside of normal ham or MARS limits.  You cannot
extend it into the 150MHz region.

   The ICOM 02-AT 2-meter hand-held and the Kenwood 2600 hand-held will
both go into the 150 MHz range if some modifications are made.

   On the Kenwood 2600, locate the two diodes standing on end with
Teflon covering the top part of their leads (which at one time were
soldered together, broken, and then resoldered).  Simply clip these two
leads to unlock the transmitter, but be sure to reset the microprocessor
by pushing the reset button before the set is capable of transmitting on
any frequency at 150 MHz.

   On the ICOM 02-AT, as well as on the ICOM 04-AT for VHF and/or UHF
work, both units require semi-major diode surgery for frequency
expansion.  For VHF, two diodes are removed and three are added for the
ICOM 02-AT to extend all the way up to 165 MHz.  For UHF work, two
diodes are added to extend the range of the ICOM 04-AT.  The
modification is tricky and a bit complicated.  (Ten dollars to Radio
School, 2414 College Drive, Costa Mesa, California 92626, brings you all
the instructions plus all the diodes needed for either the VHF or UHF
mod.)

   The popular Kenwood TS430S is modified for all-band high frequency
transceive operation by unplugging the 3-wire plug on the RF board that
mates with socket 10.  When looking at the front top of the radio, it's
to the left front side right beside a larger white plug.  You'll need to
carefully examine the circuit board and locate the number 10 witha
circle areound it to insure you have the right plug.

   On the brand new ICOM 735, to unlock the transmitter you simply cut
diodes D33 and D34 that are standing on end near the microprocessor
section toward the rear top of the radio.

   On the ICOM IC-745, locate the RF board on the side of the radio and
cut the light brown wire at jack 7, which is going to pin 1.  Your
transmitter is now unlocked.

   On the IC-751, locate the RF board on the side of the radio and cut
the black wire going to pin1 of jack 2.  Your transmitter is now
unlocked.

   On the big Kenwood 940 base station, locate IC number 109.  Now find
diode 130 and cut it for all-band transmit.  If you want just MARS
coverage, locate IC 111 and 112, and snip diode 135 beside it.

   On the Kenwood 930, the all-band transmit modification is a bit more
lengthy--several jumpers are required which is beyond the scope of this
article. Perhaps if response is good i'll prepare an article on that
specific radio.

   None of the 2-meter mobile sets are easily converted to 150 meg
frequencies.  Many people have tried all sorts of modifications, but
the best they can get is 149.99--and nothing higher.

   The ICOM thumbwheel VHF set, IC 2AT, can also be modified for 150
MHz transceive; but once you make the mod, you lose all of your 2-meter
frequencies.  You would be better to simply go out and buy a
type-accepted VHF transceiver as opposed to ruining your present 2-meter
ICOM IC 2AT set!

   The older high frequency radios with VFO tuning (as opposed to PLL
tuning) do not easily allow any type of modification for expanded
transmit or receive coverage.  It would require so much modification
that you would be ill-advised to try and step up any Yaesu FT101 series,
980, Kenwood 120, Kenwood 520, 820, or any of the old ICOM sets.

   For the old ICOM 720, the transmitter is unlocked by snipping the
blue wire that's at the very end of the top hatch cover to the left
middle side of the tranceiver.

   On the ICOM M-700 marine transceiver, the sets are already capable of
working on ham radio frequencies.  Despite what the literature says, no
lock-out is employed because the factory already did their diode trick.
Simply punch in the frequencies and you're on the air.  Remember, any
ham frequency on 40, 80, or 160 meters requires the mode switch to be
put to the hard left positions of "A3," which enables the lower sideband
filter.  All other frequencies to include all marine frequencies are
upper sideband--including those marine frequencies at 2, 4, 6, and 8
MHz.  All marine is upper sideband.

   The well-trained survivalist will know the radio frequency band well
to include radio operating procedures for different services.  This will
assist you if it becomes necessary to signal a radio call on these bands
in an emergency.

   Today's modern ham radio equipment gives us complete access to roam
the airwaves and eavesdrop on almost any type of radio communications
that are out there, on the air.  CRB Research, P.O.Box 56, Commack, NY
11725, offers numerous confidential frequency lists of those agencies
you may wish to tune into with your general coverage amateur radio
transceiver to gain more information about local emergencies and local
happenings.  Write for their big free catalog.

   While it's not illegal to modify amateur radio equipment for all-band
transmit, it is illegal to use it if it's not an emergency.  While you
may possess a valid citizen's band radio license, using non-type
accepted equipment on these bands is also not allowed, except in an
emergency.

   Although you may possess a marine radiotelephone license or an
aeronautical license, using non-type accepted epuipment is also not
allowed, except in an emergency.

   Take your time when modifying equipment, and use modified equipment
outside of your regular band limits only in an emergency situation.
