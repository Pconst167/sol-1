UNIDEN/BEARCAT 200/205XLT TEST MODE

by Bob Parnass, AJ9S

According to the Uniden/Bearcat 200/205XLT Service Information Manual, the
following procedure will load channels 1-25 with various test frequencies, and
zero the remaining 175 channels:

1. Press and hold three keys: 2, 9, and MAN simul-taneously and turn
the power switch on.

2. Set the power switch to the off position.

3. Repress and again hold three keys: 2, 9, and SCAN simultaneously and
turn the power switch on.

Note: It is unlawful to monitor cellular telephone conversations. It is
possible to monitor signals from the deleted ranges even without conversion.
Simply add 21.7 MHz to the deleted frequency and enter the higher (image)
frequency. Reception is virtually identical in strength to that which would be
heard on the deleted frequency.

The frequencies deleted at the factory may be restored, but the
procedure must not be attempted by anyone unfamiliar with electronic
circuitry. Grove Enterprises assumes no liability for damage caused by
this procedure. (I won't eighter! WA2ISE).  The modification will void
your warranty.

REASSEMBLY

        7. Insert the top of the front panel into the slot under the
           volume/squelch control panel and, noting carefully the alignment of
           the dual inline connector at the bottom of the board with the
           mating socket, press the front panel firmly into place. Be sure
           that the holes at the bottom of the circuit board line up with the
           holes in the plastic standoffs below them. Insert the two screws
           and gently tighten them.

        8. Replace the back cover by inserting the top of the cover into the
           slot under the volume/squelch control panel; press the cover into
           place, insert and tighten the screws.

        9. Reposition the battery retaining spring (slotted side toward
           notched hole), insert the two remaining screws and gently but
           securely tighten them.

BEARCAT BC200/205XLT SCANNER MODIFICATION

RESTORING THE DELETED 800MHZ BAND OF YOUR BC200/205XLT CAN BE
ACCOMPLISHED EASILY BY LOCATING THE MICROPROCESSOR LABELED,"UNIDEN UC-
1147". ONCE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THAT IC,LOCATE THE 10K OHM RESISTOR
(BROWN-BLACK-ORANGE) POSITIONED ABOVE THE LETTERS "DEN" ON THE IC. THE
RESISTOR IS LEADLESS,SO TO ACCOMPLISH THE MOD,SIMPLY CUT THE BODY OF
THE RESISTOR IN HALF. USE MINIATURE WIRE CUTTERS.

DO NOT DISTURB ANYTHING NEAR IT. IF THE LEFT SOLDER PAD COMES LOOSE,IT
MAY BE PEELED FROM THE BOARD.  BRUSH OR BLOW AWAY ANY RESIDUE.

NOTE*** IT IS UNLAWFUL TO MONITOR CELLULAR TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS

73 DENNIS WB2WPO @ KE2KQ HUNTINGTON NY (ZIP 11743bc200xlt.4

TOOLS REQUIRED: Small Phillips screwdriver, small wire cutters.

        1. Slide off the battery pack and remove the antenna from the scanner.
        2. Using a small Phillips screwdriver, remove the two screws from the
           back of the scanner, the two screws which hold the battery
           retaining spring at the base and the spring itself.
        3. Carefully pry the bottom of the rear cover from the radio and
           remove the cover.
        4. Locate the two small screws at the base of the circuit board and
           remove them. Gently pull the front panel from the mainframe at the
           base and separate them.
        5. Locate the (64 pin quad flatpack) microprocessor IC labelled
           "UNIDEN UC-1147" and the 10k ohm (brown-black-orange) leadless
           resistor positioned above the letters "DEN" on the IC.
        6. Using miniature wire cutters, cut the resistor body in two without
           disturbing anything else near it. If the left solder pad comes
           loose, it may be peeled from the board. Brush or blow away any
           residue. This completes the restoration.

        10. Slide the battery pack into place; switch the scanner on to make
            sure the display comes on. If not, the battery is discharged or
            the dual-inline connector was misaligned during assembly
            (see step 7).
            Assuming the display comes on, press: MANUAL, 845.0, E; within two

        Restore the Cellular Freqs. on Your BC200/205XLT!

        This is so simple that anyone can do it, and you have to be
REAL sloppy in order to damage your unit.

     There is no soldering involved, but if you do happen to mess your
unit up: YOU AND ONLY YOU ARE THE ONE THAT IS RESPONSIBLE.  We take no
responsiblity for any thing that might become of you or your radio!

     This mod. will also void your warranty, so open your radio and
check it out to make sure you can pull it off before you begin the real
work.

     Now that we are through with the usual backwash of "spooky"
information we can now begin.


     1.)  Take the antenna and battery pack off of the radio.

     2.)  With a Phillips-head screwdriver, remove the two screws at the
          back of the radio.  Then remove the two screws and the battery
          spring at the base of the radio.

     3.)  GENTLELY! pull off the back of the radio.

     4.)  Locate the two screws at the bottom of the board, and
          carefully remove them with a Phillips-head screwdriver.
          (Be carefull not to damage any of the surrounding components.
          This is not to tough to avoid, but warrants mentioning.)

     5.)  EVER-SO-GENTLELY! pull the front panel away from the scanner
          frame.

     6.)  On the front panel part of the radio, locate the microprocessor
          IC (labeled UNIDEN UC-1147, its the biggest black chip on the
          board) and the 10K ohm (brown-black-orange) resistor positioned
          right above the letters "DEN" in the word "UNIDEN" on the IC.

     *****  MAKE SURE YOU LOCATE THE RIGHT PART  *****

     7.)  With a small pair of clippers, clip the resistor right in two.
          Make sure not to disturb any components around the resistor.
          Leave the ends of the resistor on the board, all you need to
          do is just clip it enough so that there is a gap between the two
          ends.  Take care to clean the remiments, made by cutting the
          resistor, of the board.

     8.)  Check to see that there is no damage and everything is tidy.

     9.)  CAREFULLY reasemble the radio in exactly the reverse order of
          how you took it apart.  Be careful to line up the pins to their
          sockets in the lower, left-hand side of the radio.

     *****  FAILURE TO DO THIS CORRECTLY WILL RESULT IN A DISPLAY
     ERROR.  WHEN THE RADIO IS TURNED ON NOTHING WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.

     don't panic.
     I've done this before.  The malfunction can be fixed by taking
     the radio back apart, carefully, and making sure those pins are
     in the correct socket.  I almost gave birth to a small cow when this
     happened to me and I was very relived to find out that this was all
     that was wrong.

     10.) After you have tightened the screws, put the battery pack and
          the antenna back on the radio.  Then press "MANUAL, 845.0, E".
          Within two seconds the freq 845.000 should pop up on the display.


     Now you have completed the mod. for your scanner.  I would now like
     to welcome you to the world of the forrbiden freqs.!  You will now
     see the truth to the statement "Never say anything on a cellular
     phone that you do not want anyone else to hear."  Unfortunately
     (but fortunately for us!!) there is an incredible number of people
     that do not know this and you will be suprised at the information
     broadcast across the airwaves.

     Enjoy!

          The following was extracted, and partially edited, from literature
          received from:

          Brasstown, North Carolina  28902


     If the reader desires to obtain the original literature, which comes
     complete with an illustration of the circuit board and indication of
     the resistor to be cut, a check for $2.00 along with a stamped self-
     addressed envelope may be mailed to the above address.  The turn-
     around for my literature was very fast (Less than 1 week after
     mailing my check).  Although the directions presented here should be
     quite adequate, the quick turn-around on the mail order literature
     might provide the extra measure of visual security that some desire.
     The documentation also includes a review of the BC200/205XLT scanner.



                                    NOTES
                                    -----

     It is unlawful to monitor cellular telephone conversations.  It is
     possible to monitor signals from the deleted ranges even without
     conversion.  Simply add 21.7 MHZ to the deleted frequency and enter
     the higher (image) frequency.  Reception is virtually identical in
     strength to that which would be heard on the deleted frequency.

     The frequencies deleted at the factory may be restored, but the
     procedure should not be attempted by anyone unfamiliar with
     electronic circuitry.  No one anywhere, anytime, in anyway, etc...
     assumes any reponsibility for damage caused by this procedure.

                                  -----------

        1.  Slide off the battery pack and remove your antenna.
        2.   Remove the two screws from the back of the scanner, the two
             screws which hold the battery retaining spring at the base, and
             the battery retaining spring itself.
        3.  Carefully pry the bottom of the rear cover from the radio and
            remove the cover.
        4.   Locate the two small screws at the base of the circuit board and
             remove them.  Gently pull the front panel from the mainframe at
             the base and seperate them.


                                  MODIFICATION
                                  ------------

        5.   On the face of the circuit board that faces the front of the
             scanner when installed, locate the microprocessor IC labeled
            "UNIDEN UC-1147".  Locate the 10K ohm resistor (brown, black,
             orange), which is positioned approximately along the longitud
             inal centerline of the board, and next to the microprocessor.
             The resistor is of the leadless type and should be positioned
             directly next to the microprocessor and above the "DEN" on the
             IC label.
        6.  Using the small wire cutters, cut the resistor body in two with
            out disturbing anything next to it. If the left solder pad comes
            loose, it may be peeled from the board.  Brush or blow away any
            debris.  This completes the restoration.


                                   REASSEMBLY
                                   ----------

        7.   Insert the top of the front panel into the slot under the
             volume/squelch control panel and, noting carefully the align
             ment of the dual-inline connector at the bottom of the board,
             press the front panel firmly into place.  Be sure that the 
             holes at the bottom of the circuit board line up with the 
             holes in the plastic standoffs below them.  Insert the two

        8.  Replace the back cover by inserting the top of the cover into 
            the slot under the volume/squelch control panel; press the cover
            into place, insert and tighten the screws.

            securely tighten them.
       10  Slide the battery pack into place; switch the scanner on to make
           sure the display comes on.  If not, the battery is discharged or
           the dual-inline connector was misaligned during assembly (see 
           step 7).

The           turn-around for my literature was very fast (Less than 1 week after          mailing my check).  Although the directions presented here should be          quite adequate, the quick turn-around on the mail order literature          might provide the extra measure of visual security that some desire.          The documentation also includes a review of the BC200/205XLT scanner.NOTES-----          It is unlawful to monitor cellular telephone conversations.  It is          possible to monitor signals from the deleted ranges even without          conversion.  Simply add 21.7 MHZ to the deleted frequency and enter          the higher (image) frequency.  Reception is virtually identical in          strength to that which would be heard on the deleted frequency.          The frequencies deleted at the factory may be restored, but the          procedure should not be attempted by anyone unfamiliar with          electronic circuitry.  No one anywhere, anytime, in anyway, etc...          assumes any reponsibility for damage caused by this procedure.                            THIS MODIFICATION WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY!TOOLS-----          Small Philips Screwdriver          Small Wire CuttersDISASSEMBLY-----------1.   Slide off the battery pack and remove your antenna.2.   Remove the two screws from the back of the scanner, the two screws     which hold the battery retaining spring at the base, and the battery     retaining spring itself.3.   Carefully pry the bottom of the rear cover from the radio and remove the     cover.4.   Locate the two small screws at the base of the circuit board and remove     them.  Gently pull the front panel from the mainframe at the base and     seperate them.MODIFICATION------------5.   On the face of the circuit board that faces the front of the scanner when     installed, locate the microprocessor IC labeled "UNIDEN UC-1147". Locate     the 10K ohm resistor (brown, black, orange), which is positioned     approximately along the longitudinal centerline of the board, and next to     the microprocessor.  The resistor is of the leadless type and should be     positioned directly next to the microprocessor and above the "DEN" on the     IC label.6.   Using the small wire cutters, cut the resistor body in two without     disturbing anything next to it.  If the left solder pad comes loose, it     may be peeled from the board.  Brush or blow away any debris.  This     completes the restoration.REASSEMBLY----------7.   Insert the top of the front panel into the slot under the volume/squelch     control panel and, noting carefully the alignment of the dual-inline     connector at the bottom of the board, press the front panel firmly into     place.  Be sure that the holes at the bottom of the circuit board line     up with the holes in the plastic standoffs below them.  Insert the two     screws and gently tighten them.8.   Replace the back cover by inserting the top of the cover into the slot     under the volume/squelch control panel; press the cover into place,     insert and tighten the screws.9.   Reposition the battery retaining spring (slotted side toward notched hole),     insert the two remaining screws and gently but securely tighten them.10.  Slide the battery pack into place; switch the scanner on to make sure the     display comes on.  If not, the battery is discharged or the dual-inline     connector was misaligned during assembly (see step 7).CHECK OUT---------11.  Assuming the display comes on, press: MANUAL, 845.0, E; within two seconds     the frequency 845.000 should appear on the display.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         This file was downloaded from the HAM on Rye BBS  --  (814) 333-4111  --   2400-8-N-1 ****************    Specializing in    *******************Amateur radio, TVRO, scanning, shortwave and clandestine radio                                                                                             
