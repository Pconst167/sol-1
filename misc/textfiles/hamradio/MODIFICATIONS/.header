<H1>Ham Radio Textfiles: Modification Files</H1>
<P>
Ham Radio Modification files make up the most common collection of files
that show up in textfile collections, because they're the bits of 
information that sounded devious enough to sound like they belonged in
the file sections of a lot of BBSes people frequented.
<P>
The files were necessary because the Government decided that there were
certain ranges of frequencies that should not be listened to by anyone.
These included Cell Phone frequencies and the like. Instead of asking Cell
Phone manufacturers to improve the technology behind their transmissions
to protect the users of Cell Phones, they too a Typical Solution. They
said that no manufacturer of radio scanners could listen to those bands
anymore.
<P>
Naturally, this approach stunk on many levels, but one of the results of
this law was that scanner manufacturers would simply throw in an extra
chip or wire that would disallow the scanner to be used in the excluded 
frequencies. Suddenly, turning your scanner back into a full-featured
piece of equipment merely became a matter of removing that chip or clipping
that wire. So, files explaining how to do this for all the brands of
scanners became legion. Here are a good amount of them.
