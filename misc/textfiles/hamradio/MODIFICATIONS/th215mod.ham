DISCLAIMER:  I do not own a TH-215A and have not verified the above 
information.  Hopefully, the modified frequency range includes 162 MHz 
weather-broadcast freqs.  Remember, it is ILLEGAL to transmit outside 
the ham band with non-FCC-type-accepted equipment, even if you are 
licensed to use such frequencies.

THE ULTIMATE DISASTER:  Big tornado sucks-up Dayton Hamvention  
fleamarket, survivors try to save the day by using ham radio.  (All 
that Hewlett-Packard test equipment falling out of the sky would be 
the deadliest threat!)
