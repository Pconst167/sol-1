One can convert this scanner from a 10 channel machine to 16 channels.  
All one need do is rempve a diode.  
turn off the power and unplug the power source and remove whip antenna.
Turn the scanner over and remove 4 screws.
Carefully seperate the cabinet halves, carefully as the top and
bottom are wired together.
locate corner of the board where the connectors for the front panel
are. See the 30 pin IC that says "Uniden".  near this IC is a diode 
with insulating tubing on its leads.  One end of this diode is 
connected to the topside of the board, and the other goes over the 
edge of the board and is connected to the underside of the board.
Clip a lead or remove this diode.
You should have 16 channels now.  Program them as you would the others.
