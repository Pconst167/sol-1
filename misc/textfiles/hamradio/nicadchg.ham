   NOTES :-

   1. NICAD BATTERY CHARGER USES TWO LM317 ADJUSTABLE VOLTAGE
      REGULATORS , ONE AS A VOLTAGE REGULATOR , AND THE SECOND
      AS A CURRENT REGULATOR.

   2. RESISTOR R1 IS ADJUSTED TO GIVE THE DESIRED NICAD VOLTAGE.

   3. RESISTOR R2 IS OF A STT VLLUE , NAMELY 120 OHMS.

   4. RESISTOR R3 IS ADJUSTED TO GIVE THE DESIRED NICAD CHARGING
      CURRENT. THE VALUE OF THIS RESISTOR IS CALCULATED BY :-

                          1.25 Volts
       I ( CURRENT ) =  --------------  Amphere
                          RESISTOR 3

   5. THE VALUE OF 1.25 VOLTS IS PRESENT ON THE ADJUST PIN OF AN
      LM317 VOLTAGE REGULATOR.

   6. THE CHARGING RATE SHOULD BE CHOSEN AS TO GIVE A CHARGING RATE
      OF ABOUT 1/10 OF THE NICAD CURRENT CAPACITY.


      EG :-   TO CHARGE A 1000 mAH BATTEYY PCCK.


      CHARGE CURRENT REQUIRED IS :-  1000 / 10 = 100 mA


      TO CALCULATE THE VALUE OF R3, APPLY THE FORMULA.

                         1.25 Volts
      I ( CURRENT ) = ----------------
                         RESISTOR 3


                         1.25 Volts
      OR  RESISTOR 3 = ---------------
                           100 mA


      WHICH GIVES A VALUE OF 125 Ohms. ( CHOOSE NEAREST VALUE ).


   7. THE TIME FOR CHARGE IS ROUGHLY 14-16 HOURS AT THIS CHARGING
      RATE. A FASTER CHARGE WILL DECREASE TIME TAKEN.

   8. THE CURRENT STAYS CONSTANT, AND THE VOLTAGE RISES WITH TIME.

   9. TRICKLE CHARGE IS OFTEN 1/100 OF THE NICAD CAPABILITY.

      EG :-  1000 mAH  BATTERY , TRICKLE CHARGE = 10 mA.

  10. THE MM31  VOLTAG  REGULATOR IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

            GREATER THAN 5 mA CURRENT

            LESS THAN 500 mA CURRENT

      KEEP WITTHIN THESE DESIGN PARAMETERS !!!!

  11. THE PINOUTS FOR THE LM317T VOLTAGE REGULATOR IS AS FOLLOWS :-

      ---------                                ___________
      >   O   <                            3   [         ]  2
      ---------                         O------[  LM317  ]------O
      |       |    PIN 1 - ADJUST              [_________]
      | LM317 |                                     |
      |       |    PIN 2 - OUTPUT                   | 1
      ---------                                     |

     RESISTOR 3.
