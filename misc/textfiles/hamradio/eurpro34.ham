        The following Mod allows reception of both the 30mhz to 54mhz, and
the 68mhz to 88mhz range on the Pro-34. As you know the srandard Euro mod cuts
out the 30mhz to 54mhz range on the Pro-34. Now by adding a simple switch you
switch or rather alternate between the 30-54 and 68-88 ranges on the Pro-34.

PARTS LIST
 1 - RADIO SHACK SWITCH PART #275-624
 6 INCHES OF COMPUTER WIRE WRAP WIRE, ALSO OBTAINED AT RADIO SHACK.

TOOLS
  ELEC DRILL
  DRILL BIT SIZE FOR SWITCH
  3 SIZE LARGER DRILL BIT TO DRILL PLASTIC CASE FOR SWITCH ACCESS HOLE.

STEP 1
DISASSEMBLE THE PRO-34 IN THE NORMAL MANNER AS TO PREFORM THE EURO AND 800MHZ
MODS. (AS POINTED OUT IN THE PRO-34 MOD LISTING FILE FOUND ON THE RED ONION
BBS 914-342-4585)

STEP 2
WHEN THE METAL CHASSIS IS FREE, DRILL A HOLE IN THE CHASSIS TO
ALLOW INSTALLATION OF THE SWITCH. THE HOLE SHOULD BE LOCATED CENTERED BETWEEN
THE ANTENNA AND SQUELCH CONTROL. THIS WILL LOOK LIKE A TIGHT FIT BUT IT WILL
WORK. YOU WILL ALSO HAVE TO RE-ADJUST THE ANTENNA GROUND WITH NDLE NSE PLIERS
YOU ALLOW ROOM FOR THE SWITCH BASE.

STEP 3
BEND THE LEAD TABS ON THE SWITCH BASE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER SO NOT TO TOUCH
THE CIRCUT BOARD WHEN RE-ASSEMBLY IS PERFORMED.

STEP 4
INSTALL DIODE AT D9 LOCATION AS DIRECTED IN THE EURO-MOD EXCEPT !!! DO NOT !!!
SOLDER THE LONG LEAD TO THE CIRCUT BOARD AS THE NORMAL MOD STATES.
ONLY SOLDER THE SHORT LEAD OF THE DIODE TO THE CIRCUT BOARD IN IT'S NORMAL
POSITION AS DIRECTED IN THE EURO MOD.

STEP 5
AT THIS POINT TAKE SOME OF THE WIRE WRAP WIRE, AND SOLDER ONE END TO THE LONG
LEAD OF THE DIODE AT D9. MAKE THE SOLDER CONNECTION AS CLOSE TO THE DIODE
BODY AS POSS.. NOW CLIP THE EXTRA LEAD OF THE DIODE OFF SO IT WILL NOT
GROUND OUT OR TOUCH ANY OTHER COMPONETS.

STEP 6
NOW TAKE ANOTHER WIRE WRAP WIRE LEAD AND SOLDER THIS LEAD TO THE CIRCUT BOARD
WHERE THE LONG LEAD OF DIODE D9 WAS ORIGINALLY INTENTED TO BE INSTALLED.
NOTED: MAKE THE WIRE WRAP LEADS PLENTY LONG, TO BE TRIMED LATER AT THE SWITCH
       THIS WILL HELP KEEP TRAK OF THE LEADS DURING RE-ASSEMBLY.

STEP 7
NOW RE-ASSEMBLE THE UNIT TO THE POINT WHERE THE METAL CHASSIS IS BACK IN ITS
PROPER POSITION WITH THE TWO WIRE WRAP LEADS ROUTED BETWEEN THE METAL CHASSIS
AND TOP CIRCUT BOARD, AND BETWEEN THE ANTENNA AND SQUELCH CONTROL. IN OTHER
WORDS HAVE THE WIRE WRAP LEADS IN THE AREA WHERE THE SWITCH WILL BE INSTALLED.

STEP 8
WITH THE SWITCH OUT OF THE MOUNTING HOLE THAT WAS DRILLED BEFORE, CLIP THE TWO
WIRE WRAP LEADS AS SHORT AS POSS. AND SOLDER ONE ON EACH BENT OVER SWITCH POST.

STEP 9
NOW INSTALL THE SWITCH IN THE METAL CHASSIS MOUNTING HOLE.
NOTE: YOU SHOULD REMOVE ALL BACKUP WASHERS AND NUTS ON THE NEW SWITCH, AND
      INSTALL THE SWITCH WITH ONLY ONE WASHER AND NUT ON THE TOP SIDE.

STEP 10
NOW TAKE DRILL BIT 3 SIZES LARGER AND DRILL A HOLE IN THE PLASTIC CASE
BETWEEN THE ANTENNA HOLE AND THE SQUELCH CONTROL HOLE. THIS HOLE SHOULD BE
JUST LARGE ENOUGH TO ACCOMODATE THE SWITCH WHEN RE-INSTALLING THE CASE COVER.
IT SHOULD NOT BE LARGE ENOUGH WHERE IT WOULD CUT INTO EITHER FACTORY HOLES
ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS LOCATION.

STEP 11
NOW RE-ASSEMBLE THE UNIT. THE NEW SWITCH SHOULD SLIDE TRU THE PLASTIC
CASE JUST LIKE THE OTHER FACTORY SWITCHES AND ANTENNA BASE DO WHEN
RE-ASSEMBLING THE CASE HALF.

OPERATION

THE OPERATION IS QUIET SIMPLE SWITCH ONE WAY AND YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ONE BAND,
AT THE SECOND SWITCH POSITION YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE OTHER BAND. YOU WILL
HOWEVER HAVE TO TURN THE UNIT OFF THEN SWITCH BANDS THEN TURN THE UNIT BACK
ON. THIS ALLOWS THE UNIT TO RESET ITS SELF FOR PROPER OPERATIONS. I HAVE
ALSO NOTICED THE UNIT WILL NOT LET YOU PROGRAM 66.000, BUT WILL LET YOU START
AT 68.000. YOU WILL ALSO NOTE SOME DIF. ACTIONS IN SEARCH MODE IN RELATION TO
THE SEARCH PATTERNS OF 30-54 AND 68-88. IF YOU PREV. WERE SET SEARCH FROM
68.000 LOW AND 88.000 HIGH THEN SWITCH TO 30-54 BAND, AND RESET SEARCH MODE
LIMITS TO 30.000 LOW THEN PRESS TO PRGRAM THE HIGH LIMIT. YOU WILL NOTICE
THAT 88.000 IS SET FOR THE HIGH LIMIT. JUST PRESS ENTER AND THE UNIT WILL
SEARCH BOTH BANDS BOTH 30-54 AND THE 68-88. IT WILL ALSO LET YOU SAVE THE FREQ.
OF THE EURO BAND IF YOU DO THIS WHILE SWITCHED TO THE 68-88 MODE, AND RECALL
THEM WHEN SWICTHED TO THE 30-54 MODE AND VISA VERSA.

ANY QUESTIONS OR FURTHER COMMENTS PLEASE WRITE ME. I AM ALWAYS INTERASTED
IN OTHER MODS TO THE RADIO SHACK LINE OF SCANNERS, WITH PARTICULAR INTEREST
IN THE PRO-2005, PRO-2006, AND PRO-34 LINE.
