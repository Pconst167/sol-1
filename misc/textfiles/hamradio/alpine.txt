  INTRODUCTION

  The Alpine 1310 (if you can't already tell) is one  of  Alpine's  top-of-the
  line units. Although it is only a CD Shuttle Controller/Tuner it retails for
  about $650 dollars. You can see this unit profiled in Alpine's  Digital  Max
  pamphlet where they show the 1310 coupled to the Alpine 5957S Digital Max CD
  Shuttle and on of three Alpine Digital Max Signal  Processors.  Despite  its
  seemingly limited functionality its a very cool  unit  and  well  worth  the
  money if you have it.

  In any event this article is for people who  did  not  have  the  money  and
  obtained the 1310 by some other means. Keep in mind this article has nothing
  to do with obtaining one of these units, the scope is  no  broader  than  an
  instructional on how to defeat the CODE protection. But for those of you who
  have not yet obtained Alpine's Flagship Stereo, here are a few tips:

  TIPS ON OBTAINING THE 1310

  There are three primary parts of the complete Alpine 1310:

  New Unit (complete):

     1310 CD Shuttle Controller w/ID Logic Tuner.....Retail Price $650

  Parts:

     Face Plate......................................Replacement Price: $400
     Compact (under dash) Tuner Unit.................Replacement Price: $250
     Harnessing Sheath...............................Replacement Price: $200
     Connection Wire Kit.............................Replacement Price: $175
                                                                         ----
                                                                 Total: $1,025
  
  As you can see the 1310s parts are greater than the su, of  the  whole  damn
  thing. Anyway I would try to get as many of these parts of  the  unit  as  I
  can. 

  * TIP 1 * There is a flaw with the Harnessing Sheath (the part the faceplate
  goes into) because the teeth that are supposed to be bent back and hold  the
  harness into the dash were engineered too short and also theres no place  to
  put a screw in the  harness.  Summarily  1310  Harnessing  Sheaths  are  not
  secured very well into ANY dash board and are therefore relativley  easy  to
  pull out.

  * TIP 2 * There will be a thick  DIN  cable  connected  to  this  Harnessing
  Sheath. Whatever you do, DO NOT CUT THIS CABLE. This cable  (and  only  this
  cable) goes to the Tuner Unit which will be somewhere under the dash. If you
  cut this cable the Harnessing Sheath is pretty much  worthless no matter how
  much of a wiring genius you may think  you are. Try to tug at the  cable and
  unplug it from  the Tuner Unit. Granted,  you maybe in a bit of  rush in the
  process  of  obtaining your  unit, but theres always enough time to do a job
  right.

  * TIP 3 * The DIN cable is LESS than a meter long. Given this you  might  be
  able  to  determine about where the Tuner Unit is located in relation to the
  Harnessing Sheath it is connected to. Once you  have  determined  where  the
  Tuner Unit  is, try and yank that sucker out.  It will  be  secured  with NO
  MORE than four  screws, but usually only two, and  possibly  only  one. Why?
  Because car stereo installers are lazy, crooks, thats why!

  At this point it will be assumed that you have obtained all of the parts  of
  the stereo and you're ready to hook it up. The only problem is that the unit
  is CODE Protected (see FEATURES). To defeat the code protection  follow  the
  following cookbook instructions:

  DEFEATING THE CODE

   1. Most human beings are stupid and will not change the the 1310's code (or
      any other CODE protected devices) from  the  Factory  Preset  Code. This
      assumed go directly to step  four  (4)  and  ignore  * NOTE *. If  after
      following steps four and five you have not defeated the code  protection
      then you have obtained your stereo from a fairly smart  person  and  you
      must goto step two (2).

   2. Take the back off the Face Plate...you will see a small  memory  battery
      SOLDERED into place....DON'T TRY TO TAKE IT OUT...just short it  out  by
      crossing  the  positive  and  negative  sides  of  the  battery  with  a 
      wire....there will be no indication that you have done it  (no  puff  of
      smoke or electrical sound like in Hollywood movies)  but  its  not  that
      hard to do short. If you think you have done it you probably did...

      * NOTE * By completing this step you have erased all user definable
               memory including any user programmed code. The 1310 is now
               virgin (so to speak).

   3. Put the unit back together and hook it up...(a 12 volt battery charger
      works fine as a power source)

   4. Now turn the unit on....it may or may not  say flash the  word  CODE. In
      any event you will see a  small recessed  button  just  to the  right of
      the CLOCK Button.  This is the RESET Button.  Push that with a penciltip
      and the unit will reset itself and turn itself off...

      * NOTE * No dumbshit hitting the RESET Buttonalone  will  not  set  the
               1310 back to the factory code. YOU  HAVE  TO  SHORT  THE  UNIT 
               FIRST!

   5. Wait about 2 seconds (important) and turn the unit back on and it WILL
      be flashing CODE...do the following:

         a. Press the USER Button and the numbers '0000' will be
            displayed.
         b. Use the N - S - E - W directional  buttons to  enter the code
            '0100'...this is the New Product Code used for ALL  currently 
            produced CODE Protected Alpines.
         c. Press the TUNER/BAND Button to accept code. You are now done!
      
       * NOTE * This process  of CODE Entry  need only be  followed  when  the
                Tuner Unit (yes  the  Tuner Unit, not the Face Plate) has been
                COMPLETELY  deprived of power. In other  words, once  you have
                the 1310 installed in your car and everything is hooked up you
                will not have to do this again unless  your  battery  dies  or
                something. If so simply follow step five (5).

  FINAL NOTE: CHANGING THE CODE

  I'm kind of tired so  I'll run through this  quick. Once you have  your unit
  installed and you have  bypassed the CODE  Protection and the unit plays and
  works fine, you can follow the  following  procedure to  change  the code to
  whatever you like:

   * NOTE * In the following steps you will be entering the OLD code (probably 
            the factory preset) and then your own NEW code and  then  the  OLD
            code again to  register your  own NEW  code. Its kind of a pain in
            the ass but its  obvious why they did it (so noone who didn't know
            the code could  simply change it to something  they did know duh!)
               
   1. Turn on the unit and press the TUNER/BAND Button to switch the 1310 to
      TUNER mode.
   2. Press and hold the HOME/TITLE Button for more than 2 seconds until CODE
      is displayed.
   3. Press the USER/INTRO Button and the unit will display '0000' with the 
      first digit blinking.
   4. Input the previous code with the directional N - S - E - W buttons. If 
      you're doing this for the first time since Reset then enter the code
     '0100'.
   5. Press the TUNER/BAND Button to accept the code and the display will
      blink CODE.
   6. Press the USER/INTRO button again. The display will show '0000' with the 
      first digit blinking. This means it is ready to accept your code.
   7. Use the directional N - S - E - W buttons again to enter your code.
   8. Press the TUNER/BAND Button to enter each number respectivley and
      following the entry of your new code the display will blink your new
      code for 5-10 seconds and then CODE will be displayed.
   9. To register the new code you must repeat steps 3,4, and 5 entering 
      the OLD code number.
  10. Once step five is completed your unit will (hopefully) be on tuner and
      you will never have to do this shit again until next time.

  Thanx goto:  Nobody  (from oB's)  Disorder  (from Flatline), Alpine (for the
  great  products and documentation),  Mr. Schenck  (my 10th grade electronics
  teacher), and the poor SOB who had a nice stereo, no alarm, and  not  enough
  since to lock his fuckin door...Late oB (thats oleBuzzard)
