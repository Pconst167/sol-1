Notes from Eric Poole, Sysop of Leo Technology BBS:
---------------------------------------------------

     Over the last couple of weeks, I've been calling around to CompuServe, 
the Circuit Cellar INK BBS, and everywhere else I can think of, trying to 
find the full text of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986.
The best I've been able to come up with so far are some excerpts from the 
preliminary House of Representatives version.

     Last night, October 7, 1988, someone (whose name I would like to
include here but I haven't yet gotten his permission to do so) called the
Leo Technology BBS for the first time out of the clear blue sky, long
distance from Washington to New Hampshire on his own nickel, went through
all the new-user questionnaires and stuff, and uploaded the full text of the
act, all hundred-some-odd-thousand bytes of it.  So, here it is.  Thanks to
the provider, (I'm sure it'd be OK to put his name here, but like I said, I
didn't yet get his permission to do so); it's guys like you that make all
this BBS sysoping stuff worth while!

     I believe the contents of this file to be accurate, however, please,
before taking any action or making any decisions based upon what you read
in this file, CONFIRM THE LANGUAGE IN THIS FILE AGAINST AN OFFICIAL LEGAL
SOURCE, and if you aren't a lawyer, go get one.

          (b)  a full and complete statement of the facts and circumstances 
               relied upon by the applicant,  to justify his belief that an 
               order  should  be issued,  including (i) details as  to  the 
               particular offense that has been,  is being,  or is about to 
               be committed,  (ii) except as provided in subsection (11), a 
               particular  description  of the nature and location  of  the 
               facilities  from which or the place where the  communication 
               is to be intercepted,  (iii) a particular description of the 
               type  of communications sought to be intercepted,  (iv)  the 
               identity of the person, if known, committing the offense and 
               whose communications are to be intercepted;

          (c)  a  full  and complete statement as to whether or  not  other 
               investigative  procedures have been tried and failed or  why 
               they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or 
               to be too dangerous;

          (d)  a statement of the period of time for which the interception 
               is  required  to  be  maintained.   If  the  nature  of  the 
               investigation   is   such   that   the   authorization   for 
               interception  should  not automatically terminate  when  the 
               described type of communication has been first  obtained,  a 
               particular  description of facts establishing probable cause 
               to  believe that additional communications of the same  type 
               will occur thereafter;

          (e)  a  full and complete statement of the facts  concerning  all 
               previous  applications  known to the individual  authorizing 
               and   making  the  application,   made  to  any  judge   for 
               authorization to intercept, or for approval of interceptions 
               of,  wire,  oral, or electronic communications involving any 
               of the same persons,  facilities or places specified in  the 
               application,  and the action taken by the judge on each such 
               application; and

          (f)  where  the application is for the extension of an  order,  a 
               statement  setting forth the results thus far obtained  from 
               the interception, or a reasonable explanation of the failure 
               to obtain such results.

     (2)  The  judge  may  require  the  applicant  to  furnish  additional 
          testimony or documentary evidence in support of the application.

     (3)  Upon  such application the judge may enter an ex parte order,  as 
          requested or as modified,  authorizing or approving  interception 
          of   wire,   oral,   or  electronic  communications  within   the 
          territorial  jurisdiction  of  the court in which  the  judge  is 
          sitting  (and  outside  that jurisdiction but within  the  United 
          States in the case of a mobile interception device authorized  by 
          a   Federal  court  within  such  jurisdiction),   if  the  judge 
          determines  on the basis of the facts submitted by the  applicant 
          that --

          (a)  there  is  probable cause for belief that an  individual  is 
               committing,   has  committed,   or  is  about  to  commit  a 
               particular  offense  enumerated  in  section  2516  of  this 
               chapter;

          (b)  there   is   probable  cause  for  brief   that   particular 
               communications  concerning  that offense  will  be  obtained 
               through such interception;

          (c)  normal  investigative  procedures have been tried  and  have 
               failed  or  reasonably appear to be unlikely to  succeed  if 
               tried or to be too dangerous;

          (d)  except  as  provided in subsection (11),  there is  probable 
               cause  for  belief that the facilities from  which,  or  the 
               place where the wire, oral, or electronic communications are 
               to be intercepted are being used,  or are about to be  used, 
               in  connection with the commission of such offense,  or  are 
               leased to,  listed in the name of,  or commonly used by such 
               person.

     (4)  Each order authorizing or approving the interception of any wire, 
          oral,  or  electronic  communication  under  this  chpater  shall 
          specify --

          (a)  the identity of the person,  if known,  whose communications 
               are to be intercepted;

          (b)  the  nature and location of the communications facilities as 
               to  which,  or the place where,  authority to  intercept  is 
               granted;

          (c)  a particular description of the type of communication sought 
               to be intercepted, and a statement of the particular offense 
               to which it relates;

          (d)  the  identity  of  the agency authorized  to  intercept  the 
               communications,   and   of   the  person   authorizing   the 
               application; and

          (e)  the  period  of  time  during  which  such  interception  is 
               authorized,  including  a statement as to whether or not the 
               interception   shall   automatically  terminate   when   the 
               described communication has been first obtained.

          An  order  authorizing  the interception  of  a  wire,  oral,  or 
          electronic communication under this chapter shall,  upon  request 
          of  the applicant,  direct that a provider of wire or  electronic 
          communication service,  landlord, custodian or other person shall 
          furnish the applicant forthwith all information,  facilities, and 
          technical  assistance  necessary to accomplish  the  interception 
          unobtrusively  and  with  a  minimum  of  interference  with  the 
          services  that such service  provider,  landlord,  custodian,  or 
          person  is  according the person whose communications are  to  be 
          intercepted.   Any  provider of wire or electronic  communication 
          service,  landlord,  custodian  or  other person furnishing  such 
          facilities or technical assistance shall be compensated  therefor 
          by  the  applicant for reasonable expenses incurred in  providing 
          such facilities or assistance.

     (5)  No order entered under this section may authorize or approve  the 
          interception of any wire,  oral,  or electronic communication for 
          any  period longer than is necessary to achieve the objective  of 
          the authorization nor in any event longer than thirty days.  Such 
          thirty-day  period begins on the earlier of the day on which  the 
          investigative  or law enforcement officer first begins to conduct 
          an  interception under the order or ten days after the  order  is 
          entered.   Extensions  of an order may be granted,  but only upon 
          application  for an extension made in accordance with  subsection 
          (1) of this section and the court making the findings required by 
          subsection (3) of this section.  The period of extension shall be 
          no  longer than the authorizing judge deems necessary to  achieve 
          the purposes for which it was granted and in no event for  longer 
          than  thirty  days.   Every  order and  extension  thereof  shall 
          contain  a provision that the authorization to intercept shall be 
          executed as soon as practicable, shall be conducted in such a way 
          as  to minimize the interception of communications not  otherwise 
          subject  to interception under this chapter,  and must  terminate 
          upon attainment of the authorized objective,  or in any event  in 
          thirty days.   In the event the intercepted communication is in a 
          code or foreign language,  and an expert in that foreign language 
          or  code  is  not reasonably available  during  the  interception 
          period,  minimization  may be accomplished as soon as practicable 
          after such interception.   An interception under this chapter may 
          be conducted in whole or in part by Government personnel,  or  by 
          an  individual  operating under a contract with  the  Government, 
          acting   under  the  supervision  of  an  investigative  or   law 
          enforcement officer authorized to conduct the interception.

     (6)  Whenever an order authorizing interception is entered pursuant to 
          this  chapter,  the  order may require reports to be made to  the 
          judge  who issued the order showing what progress has  been  made 
          toward  achievement of the authorized objective and the need  for 
          continued  interception.   Such  reports  shall be made  at  such 
          intervals as the judge may require.

     (7)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this   chapter,   any 
          investigative or law enforcement officer, specially designated by 
          the Attorney General,  the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate 
          Attorney  General or by the principal prosecuting attorney of any 
          State or subdivision thereof acting pursuant to a statute of that 
          State, who reasonably determines that --

          (a)  an emergency situation exists that involves --

               (i)  immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to 
                    any person;

               (ii) conspiratorial  activities  threatening  the   national 
                    security interest; or

               (iii) conspiratorial  activities characteristic of organized 
                    crime,

               that requires a wire,  oral,  or electronic communication to 
               be intercepted before an order authorizing such interception 
               can, with due diligence, be obtained, and

          (b)  there are grounds upon which an order could be entered under 
               this chapter to authorize such interception,

          may intercept such wire,  oral, or electronic communication if an 
          application  for an order approving the interception is  made  in 
          accordance  with this section within forty-eight hours after  the 
          interception has occurred, or begins to occur.  In the absence of 
          an order,  such interception shall immediately terminate when the 
          communication  sought is obtained or when the application for the 
          order  is  denied,  whichever  is earlier.   In  the  event  such 
          application  for approval is denied,  or in any other case  where 
          the  interception  is  terminated without an  order  having  been 
          issued,   the  contents  of  any  wire,   oral,   or   electronic 
          communication   intercepted  shall  be  treated  as  having  been 
          obtained in violation of this chapter,  and an inventory shall be 
          served  as provided for in subsection (d) of this section on  the 
          person named in the application.

     (8)  (a)  The contents of any wire, oral, or  electronic communication 
               intercepted  by any means authorized by this chapter  shall, 
               if possible, be recorded on tape or wire or other comparable 
               device.  The recording of the contents of any wire, oral, or 
               electronic communication under this subsection shall be done 
               in  such way as will protect the recording from  editing  or 
               other  alterations.   Immediately upon the expiration of the 
               period of the order,  or extensions thereof, such recordings 
               shall be made available to the judge issuing such order  and 
               sealed  under  his directions.   Custody of  the  recordings 
               shall  be  wherever  the judge orders.   They shall  not  be 
               destroyed  except  upon an order of the issuing  or  denying 
               judge  and  in  any  event shall  be  kept  for  ten  years.  
               Duplicate  recordings  may  be made for  use  or  disclosure 
               pursuant  to  the provisions of subsections (1) and  (2)  of 
               section  2517  of  this  chapter  for  investigations.   The 
               presence  of the seal provided for by this subsection,  or a 
               satisfactory explanation for the absence thereof, shall be a 
               prerequisite  for the use or disclosure of the  contents  of 
               any  wire,  oral,  or  electronic communication or  evidence 
               derived therefrom under subsection (3) of section 2517.

          (b)  Applications  made  and orders granted  under  this  chapter 
               shall  be sealed by the judge.   Custody of the applications 
               and  orders  shall  be wherever  the  judge  directs.   Such 
               applications  and  orders  shall be disclosed  only  upon  a 
               showing   of  good  cause  before  a  judge   of   competent 
               jurisdiction  and shall not be destroyed except on order  of 
               the issuing or denying judge, and in any event shall be kept 
               for ten years.

          (c)  Any  violation  of the provisions of this subsection may  be 
               punished as contempt of the issuing or denying judge.

          (d)  Within  a  reasonable time but not later  than  ninety  days 
               after  the filing of an application for an order of approval 
               under section 2518(7)(b) which is denied or the  termination 
               of the period of an order or extensions thereof, the issuing 
               or  denying judge shall cause to be served,  on the  persons 
               named  in  the  order or the  application,  and  such  other 
               parties  to  intercepted  communications as  the  judge  may 
               determine  in  his  discretion that is in  the  interest  of 
               justice, and inventory which shall include notice of --

               (1)  the fact of the entry of the order or the application;

               (2)  the  date  of the entry and the period  of  authorized, 
                    approved or disapproved interception,  or the denial of 
                    the application; and

               (3)  the  fact  that  during  the  period  wire,   oral,  or 
                    electronic communications were or were not intercepted.

               The  judge,  upon  the  filing  of  a  motion,  may  in  his 
               discretion  make available to such person or his counsel for 
               inspection such portions of the intercepted  communications, 
               applications and orders as the judge determines to be in the 
               interest  of justice.   On an ex parte showing of good cause 
               to  a  judge of competent jurisdiction the  serving  of  the 
               inventory required by this subsection may be postponed.

     (9)  The  contents  of any wire,  oral,  or  electronic  communication 
          intercepted   pursuant  to  this  chapter  or  evidence   derived 
          therefrom   shall  not  be  received  in  evidence  or  otherwise 
          disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in a Federal 
          or State court unless each party,  not less then ten days  before 
          the trial, hearing, or proceeding, has been furnished with a copy 
          of the court order, and accompanying application, under which the 
          interception was authorized or approved.  This ten-day period may 
          be  waived  by the judge if he finds that it was not possible  to 
          furnish the party with the above information ten days before  the 
          trial,  hearing,  or  proceeding  and that the party will not  be 
          prejudiced by the delay in receiving such information.

     (10) (a)  Any aggrieved person in any trial, hearing, or proceeding in 
               or before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory 
               body, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a 
               political  subdivision  thereof,  may move to  suppress  the 
               contents  of any wire,  oral,  or  electronic  communication 
               intercepted  pursuant to this chapter,  or evidence  derived 
               therefrom, on the grounds that --

               (i)  the communication was unlawfully intercepted;

               (ii) the  order of authorization or approval under which  it 
                    was intercepted is insufficient on its face; or

               (iii) the  interception was not made in conformity with  the 
                    order of authorization or approval.

               Such  motion  shall be made before the  trial,  hearing,  or 
               proceeding  unless  there was no opportunity  to  make  such 
               motion  or  the person was not aware of the grounds  of  the 
               motion.   If  the  motion is granted,  the contents  of  the 
               intercepted  wire,  oral,  or electronic  communication,  or 
               evidence derived therefrom,  shall be treated as having been 
               obtained in violation of this chapter.   The judge, upon the 
               filing  of such motion by the aggrieved person,  may in  his 
               discretion  make  available to the aggrieved person  or  his 
               counsel  for  inspection  such portions of  the  intercepted 
               communication  or  evidence derived therefrom as  the  judge 
               determines to be in the interests of justice.

          (b)  In addition to any other right to appeal,  the United States 
               shall  have  the right to appeal from an  order  granting  a 
               motion   to  suppress  made  under  paragraph  (a)  of  this 
               subsection,  or the denial of an application for an order of 
               approval, if the United States attorney shall certify to the 
               judge or other official granting such motion or denying such 
               application  that  the appeal is not taken for  purposes  of 
               delay.   Such appeal shall be taken within thirty days after 
               the  date  the  order was entered and  shall  be  diligently 
               prosecuted.

          (c)  The  remedies and sanctions described in this  chapter  with 
               respect to the interception of electronic communications are 
               the    only    judicial   remedies   and    sanctions    for 
               nonconstitutional  violations of this chapter involving such 
               communications.

     (11) The  requirements  of subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (3)(d)  of  this 
          section  relating  to the specification of  the  facilities  from 
          which, or the place where, the communication is to be intercepted 
          do not apply if --

          (a)  in   the  case  of  an  application  with  respect  to   the 
               interception of an oral communication --

               (i)  the  application  is by a federal investigative or  law 
                    enforcement  officer  and is approved by  the  Attorney 
                    General,  the  Deputy Attorney General,  the  Associate 
                    Attorney General,  an Assistant Attorney General, or an 
                    acting Assistant Attorney General;

               (ii) the application contains a full and complete  statement 
                    as  to  why  such specification is  not  practical  and 
                    identifies  the person committing the offense and whose 
                    communications are to be intercepted; and

               (iii) the  judge  finds  that  such  specification  is   not 
                    practical; and

          (b)  in  the  case  of an application with respect to a  wire  or 
               electronic communication --

               (iv) the  application is by a Federal investigative  or  law 
                    enforcement  officer  and is approved by  the  Attorney 
                    General,  the  Deputy Attorney General,  the  Associate 
                    Attorney General,  an Assistant Attorney General, or an 
                    acting Assistant Attorney General;

               (v)  the  application identifies the person  believed to  be 
                    committing  the offense and whose communications are to 
                    be  intercepted and the applicant makes a showing of  a 
                    purpose,   on  the  part  of  that  person,  to  thwart 
                    interception by changing facilities; and

               (vi) the  judge finds that such purpose has been  adequately 
                    shown.

     (12) An interception of a communication under an order with respect to 
          which  the requirements of subsections (1)(b)(ii) and  (3)(d)  of 
          this  section do not apply by reason of subsection (11) shall not 
          begin until the facilities from which,  or the place  where,  the 
          communication  is to be intercepted is ascertained by the  person 
          implementing  the  interception  order.   A provider of  wire  or 
          electronic  communications service that has received an order  as 
          provided  for in subsection (11)(b) may move the court to  modify 
          or quash the order on the ground that its assistance with respect 
          to the interception cannot be performed in a timely or reasonable 
          fashion.   The court, upon notice to the government, shall decide 
          such a motion expeditiously.

     communications

     (1)  Within  thirty  days  after the expiration of an order  (or  each 
          extension thereof) entered under  section 2518,  or the denial of

          (g)  the  nature of the facilities from which or the place  where 
               communications were to be intercepted.

     (2)  In  January  of  each year the  Attorney  General,  an  Assistant

                    not  been  found liable in a prior civil  action  under 
                    this section, the court shall assess the greater of the

          (2)  In  any  other  action under this section,  the   court  may 
               assess as damages whichever is the greater of--

               (A)  the sum of the actual damages suffered by the plaintiff 
                    and any profits made by the violator as a result of the 
                    violation; or

               (B)  statutory damages of whichever is the greater of $100 a 
                    day for each day of violation or $10,000.

     (d)  DEFENSE.--A good faith reliance on--

               legislative authorization, or a statutory authorization;

          (2)  a  request  of an investigative or law  enforcement  officer 
               under section 2518(7) of this title; or

               title permitted the conduct complained of;

          is  a  complete  defense  against any civil  or  criminal  action

district  court of the United States to enjoin such violation.   The  court 
shall  proceed  as soon as practicable to the hearing and determination  of 
such an action, and may, at any time before final determination, enter such 
a  restraining  order or prohibition,  or take such  other  action,  as  is 
warranted  to  prevent  a continuing and substantial injury to  the  United 
States or to any person or class of persons for whose protection the action 
is  brought.   A proceeding under this section is governed by  the  Federal

     (b)  CONTENTS  OF  ELECTRONIC  COMMUNICATIONS IN  A  REMOTE  COMPUTING 
          SERVICE.--

          (1)  A  governmental  entity  may require a  provider  of  remote 
               computing service to disclose the contents of any electronic 
               communication  to which this paragraph is made applicable by

                    pertaining  to  a  subscriber to or  customer  of  such 
                    service  (not including the contents of  communications 
                    covered  by  subsection (a) or (b) of this section)  to 
                    any person other than a governmental entity.

               (B)  A  provider  of  electronic  communication  service  or 
                    remote  computing  service shall disclose a  record  or 
                    other  information  pertaining to a  subscriber  to  or 
                    customer of such service (not including the contents of 
                    communications covered by subsection (a) or (b) of this 
                    section)   to  a  governmental  entity  only  when  the 
                    governmental entity--

                    (i)  uses  an administrative subpoena authorized  by  a 
                         Federal  or State statute,  or a Federal or  State 
                         grand jury subpoena;

                    (ii) obtains  a warrant issued under the Federal  Rules 
                         of Criminal Procedure or equivalent State warrant;

                    (iii) obtains  a court order for such disclosure  under 
                         subsection (d) of this section; or

                    (iv) has  the consent of the subscriber or customer  to 
                         such disclosure.

          (2)  A governmental entity receiving records or information under 
               this  subsection  is  not required to provide  notice  to  a 
               subscriber or customer.

     (d)  REQUIREMENTS  FOR  COURT  ORDER.-- A court order  for  disclosure 
          under  subsection (b) or (c) of this section shall issue only  if 
          the governmental entity shows that there is reason to believe the 
          contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or 
          other  information  sought,  are  relevant to  a  legitimate  law 
          enforcement  inquiry.   In  the  case  of  a  State  governmental 
          authority,  such  a court order shall not issue if prohibited  by 
          the law of such State.  A court issuing an order pursuant to this 
          section,  on a motion made promptly by the service provider,  may 
          quash  or  modify  such order,  if  the  information  or  records 
          requested  are unusually voluminous in nature or compliance  with 
          such  order  otherwise  would  cause  an  undue  burden  on  such 
          provider.

     (e)  NO  CAUSE  OF  ACTION AGAINST A PROVIDER  DISCLOSING  INFORMATION 
          UNDER  THIS CHAPTER.-- No cause of action shall lie in any  court 
          against any provider of wire or electronic communication service, 
          its officers,  employees,  agents, or other specified persons for 
          providing information,  facilities,  or assistance in  accordance 
          with  the  terms  of  a  court  order,   warrant,   subpoena,  or 
          certification under this chapter.




_ 2704. Backup preservation

     (a)  BACKUP PRESERVATION.-- 

          (1)  A  governmental  entity acting under section 2703(b)(2)  may 
               include  in its subpoena or court order a  requirement  that 
               the  service provider to whom the request is directed create 
               a   backup   copy  of  the  contents   of   the   electronic 
               communications   sought   in   order   to   preserve   those 
               communications.    Without   notifying  the  subscriber   or 
               customer  of  such  subpoena or court  order,  such  service 
               provider   shall  create  such  backup  copy  as   soon   as 
               practicable  consistent with its regular business  practices 
               and  shall  confirm  to the governmental  entity  that  such 
               backup  copy  has  been made.   Such backup  copy  shall  be 
               created  within  two  business  days after  receipt  by  the 
               service provider of the subpoena or court order.

          (2)  Notice  to the subscriber or customer shall be made  by  the 
               governmental  entity within three days after receipt of such 
               confirmation,  unless  such  notice is delayed  pursuant  to 
               section 2705(a).

          (3)  The  service  provider shall not destroy  such  backup  copy 
               until the later of--

               (A)  the delivery of the information; or

               (B)  the resolution of any proceedings (including appeals of 
                    any proceeding) concerning the government's subpoena or 
                    court order.

          (4)  The  service provider shall release such backup copy to  the 
               requesting  governmental entity no sooner than fourteen days 
               after the governmental entity's notice to the subscriber  or 
               customer if such service provider--

               (A)  has not received notice from the subscriber or customer 
                    that  the  subscriber  or customer has  challenged  the 
                    governmental entity's request; and

               (B)  has not initiated proceedings to challenge the  request 
                    of the governmental entity.

          (5)  A  governmental entity may seek to require the creation of a 
               backup  copy under subsection (a)(1) of this section  if  in 
               its  sole  discretion such entity determines that  there  is 
               reason  to  believe that notification under section 2703  of 
               this  title of the existence of the subpoena or court  order 
               may  result  in destruction of or tampering  with  evidence.  
               This  determination  is  not subject  to  challenge  by  the 
               subscriber or customer or service provider.

     (b) CUSTOMER CHALLENGES.-- 

          (1)  Within fourteen days after notice by the governmental entity 
               to  the  subscriber or customer under subsection  (a)(2)  of 
               this section,  such subscriber or customer may file a motion 
               to  quash  such subpoena or vacate such  court  order,  with 
               copies  served upon the governmental entity and with written 
               notice of such challenge to the service provider.   A motion 
               to  vacate a court order shall be filed in the  court  which 
               issued  such order.   A motion to quash a subpoena shall  be 
               filed  in  the appropriate Unites States district  court  or 
               State  court.   Such motion or application shall contain  an 
               affidavit or sworn statement--

               (A)  stating  that the applicant is a customer or subscriber 
                    to  the service from which the contents  of  electronic 
                    communications maintained for him have been sought; and

               (B)  stating  the applicant's reasons for believing that the 
                    records  sought  are not relevant to a  legitimate  law 
                    enforcement   inquiry  or  that  there  has  not   been 
                    substantial  compliance  with the  provisions  of  this 
                    chapter in some other respect.

          (2)  Service shall be made under this section upon a governmental 
               entity  by delivering or mailing by registered or  certified 
               mail  a  copy  of  the papers  to  the  person,  office,  or 
               department  specified in the notice which the  customer  has 
               received pursuant to this chapter.  For the purposes of this 
               section, the term "delivery" has the meaning given that term 
               in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

          (3)  If  the  court  finds that the customer  has  complied  with 
               paragraphs  (1) an (2) of this subsection,  the court  shall 
               order  the  governmental  entity to file a  sworn  response, 
               which  may  be filed in camera if  the  governmental  entity 
               includes  in  its response the reasons which make in  camera 
               review approriate.   If the court is unable to determine the 
               motion  or application on the basis of the parties'  initial 
               allegations  and  response,   the  court  may  conduct  such 
               additional  proceedings as it deems appropriate.   All  such 
               proceedings shall be completed and the motion or application 
               decided  as  soon  as practicable after the  filing  of  the 
               governmental entity's response.

          (4)  If the court finds that the applicant is not the  subscriber 
               or  customer  for  whom  the communications  sought  by  the 
               governmental  entity  are maintained,  or that  there  is  a 
               reason  to  believe  that  the law  enforcement  inquiry  is 
               legitimate  and that the communications sought are  relevant 
               to that inquiry, it shall deny the motion or application and 
               order  such process enforced.   If the court finds that  the 
               applicant  is  the  subscriber  or  customer  for  whom  the 
               communications   sought  by  the  governmental  entity   are 
               maintained,  and that there is not a reason to believe  that 
               the  communications sought are relevant to a legitimate  law 
               enforcement inquiry,  or that there has not been substantial 
               compliance  with  the provisions of this chapter,  it  shall 
               order the process quashed.  

          (5)  A  court  order denying a motion or application  under  this 
               section   shall  not  be  deemed  a  final  order   and   no 
               interlocutory appeal may be taken therefrom by the customer.



_ 2705.  Delayed notice

     (a)  DELAY OF NOTIFICATION.-- 

          (1)  A  governmental entity acting under section 2703(b) of  this 
               title may--

               (A)  where   a  court  order  is  sought,   include  in  the 
                    application a request, which the court shall grant, for 
                    an  order  delaying  the  notification  required  under 
                    section  2703(b)  of  this title for a  period  not  to 
                    exceed ninety days,  if the court determines that there 
                    is reason to believe that notification of the existence 
                    of the court order may have an adverse result described 
                    in paragraph (2) of this subsection; or

               (B)  where  an  administrative  subpoena  authorized  by   a 
                    Federal  or  State statute or a Federal or State  grand 
                    jury  subpoena  is  obtained,  delay  the  notification 
                    required  under  section 2703(b) of this  title  for  a 
                    period  not to exceed ninety days upon the execution of 
                    a written certification of a supervisory official  that 
                    there  is  reason to believe that notification  of  the 
                    existence  of  the subpoena may have an adverse  result 
                    described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.

          (2)  An adverse result for the purposes of paragraph (1) of  this 
               subsection is--

               (A)  endangering   the   life  or  physical  safety  of   an 
                    individual;

               (B)  flight from prosecution;

               (C)  destruction of or tampering with evidence;

               (D)  intimidation of potential witnesses; or

               (E)  otherwise  seriously jeopardizing an  investigation  or 
                    unduly delaying a trial.

          (3)  The  governmental  entity  shall  maintain a  true  copy  of 
               certification under paragraph (1)(B).

          (4)  Extensions of the delay of notification provided in  section 
               2703  of up to ninety days each may be granted by the  court 
               upon  application,  or  by certification by  a  governmental 
               entity,  but  only in accordance with subsection (b) of this 
               section.

          (5)  Upon expiration of the period of delay of notification under 
               paragraph  (1) or (4) of this subsection,  the  governmental 
               entity shall serve upon,  or deliver by registered or first-
               class  mail  to,  the customer or subscriber a copy  of  the 
               process or request together with notice that--

               (A)  states  with reasonable specificity the nature  of  the 
                    law enforcement inquiry; and

               (B)  informs such customer or subscriber--

                    (i)  that  information maintained for such customer  or 
                         subscriber  by the service provider named in  such 
                         process or request was supplied to or requested by 
                         that  governmental authority and the date on which 
                         the supplying or request took place;

                    (ii) that  notification of such customer or  subscriber 
                         was delayed;

                    (iii) what  governmental  entity  or  court  made   the 
                         certification  or determination pursuant to  which 
                         that delay was made; and

                    (iv) which provision of this chapter allowed such delay.

          (6)  As used in this subsection,  the term "supervisory official" 
               means   the  investigative  agent  in  charge  or  assistant 
               investigative  agent  in  charge  or  an  equivalent  of  an 
               investigating agency's headquarters or regional  office,  or 
               the  chief  prosecuting  attorney  or  the  first  assistant 
               prosecuting  attorney  or  an equivalent  of  a  prosecuting 
               attorney's headquarters or regional office.

     (b)  PRECLUSION  OF  NOTICE  TO SUBJECT  OF  GOVERNMENTAL  ACCESS.-- A 
          governmental  entity  acting under section 2703,  when it is  not 
          required  to  notify  the subscriber or  customer  under  section 
          2703(b)(1),  or  to  the  extent that it may  delay  such  notice 
          pursuant to subsection (a) of this section,  may apply to a court 
          for  an order commanding a provider of electronic  communications 
          service or remote computing service to whom a warrant,  subpoena, 
          or  court order is directed,  for such period as the court  deems 
          appropriate,  not to notify any other person of the existence  of 
          the  warrant,  subpoena,  or court order.   The court shall enter 
          such  an order if it determines that there is reason  to  believe 
          that notification of the existence of the warrant,  subpoena,  or 
          court order will results in--

          (1)  endangering the life or physical safety of an individual;

          (2)  flight from prosecution;

          (3)  destruction of or tampering with evidence;

          (4)  intimidation of potential witnesses; or

          (5)  otherwise  seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly 
               delaying a trial.



_ 2706.  Cost reimbursement

     (a)  PAYMENT.-- Except  as  otherwise provided in  subsection  (c),  a 
          governmental  entity  obtaining the contents  of  communications, 
          records,  or other information under section 2702,  2703, or 2704 
          of  this  title shall pay to the person or entity  assembling  or 
          providing such information a fee for reimbursement for such costs 
          as are reasonably necessary and which have been directly incurred 
          in searching for, assembling, reproducing, or otherwise providing 
          such  information.   Such  reimbursable costs shall  include  any 
          costs  due  to necessary disruption of normal operations  of  any 
          electronic  communication service or remote computing service  in 
          which such information may be stored.

     (b)  AMOUNT.-- The  amount of the fee provided by subsection (a) shall 
          be  as mutually agreed by the governmental entity and the  person 
          or  entity  providing the information,  or,  in  the  absence  of 
          agreement,  shall  be as determined by the court which issued the 
          order  for  production of such information (or the  court  before 
          which  a criminal prosecution relating to such information  would 
          be  brought,  if no court order was issued for production of  the 
          information).

     (c)  The requirement of subsection (a) of this section does not  apply 
          with  respect  to  records or other information maintained  by  a 
          communications  common  carrier  that relate  to  telephone  toll 
          records  and  telephone listings obtained under section  2703  of 
          this title.  The court may, however, order a payment as described 
          in  subsection  (a)  if  the  court  determines  the  information 
          required is unusually voluminous in nature or otherwise caused an 
          undue burden on the provider.

     (a)  CAUSE  OF ACTION.-- Except as provided in  section  2703(e),  any 
          provider  of  electronic communication  service,  subscriber,  or 
          customer aggrieved by any violation of this chapter in which  the 
          conduct  constituting the violation is engaged in with a  knowing 
          or intentional state of mind may, in a civil action, recover from

               as may be appropriate;

          (3)  a  reasonable  attorney's  fee and  other  litigation  costs 
               reasonably incurred.

     (c)  DAMAGES.-- The  court  may  assess as damages in a  civil  action 
          under this section the sum of the actual damages suffered by  the 
          plaintiff and any profits made by the violator as a result of the 
          violation,  but  in  no case shall a person entitled  to  recover 
          receive less than the sum of $1,000.

     (d)  DEFENSE.-- A good faith reliance on--

               under section 2518(7) of this title; or

          (3)  a  good  faith determination that section  2511(3)  of  this 
               title permitted the conduct complained of;

          is  a  complete defense to any civil or criminal  action  brought 
          under this chapter or any other law.

     (e)  LIMITATION  -- A  civil  action  under this section  may  not  be 
          commenced  later  than two years after the date  upon  which  the 
          claimant  first  discovered  or had a reasonable  opportunity  to 
          discover the violation.
