al restrictions.  The highest point of your antenna must not exceed one meter
above the airport elevation for every hundred meters of distance from the near-
est point of the nearest runway.  Differences in ground elevation between your
antenna and the airport runway may complicate this formula.  If your CB station
is near an airport, you may contact the nearest FCC Field Office for a worksheet
to help you figure the maximum allowable height for your antenna.  Consult Part
17 of the FCC's Rules for more information.

95.409 (CB RULE 9)  WHAT EQUIPMENT MAY I USE AT MY CB STATION?
     (a)  You must use an FCC type-accepted transmitter at your CB station.
You can identify an FCC type-accepted transmitter by the type-acceptance label
placed on it by the manufacturer.  You may examine a list of type-accepted
equipment at any FCC Field Office or at FCC Headquarters.  Use of a transmitter
which is not type-accepted voids your authority to operate the station.
     (b)  You must not make, or have made, any internal modification to a type-
accepted CB transmitter (see CB Rule 25).  Any internal modification to a type-
accepted transmitter voids your authority to operate the station.

95.410 (CB RULE 10)  HOW MUCH POWER MAY I USE?
     (a)  Your CB station transmitter power output must not exceed the following
values under any conditions:
     AM (Amplitude Modulation) - 4 watts (carrier power).
     SSB (Single-sideband) - 12 watts (peak envelope power).
     (b)  If you need more information about the power rule, see the technical
rules in Subpart E of Part 95.
     (c)  Use of a transmitter which has carrier or peak envelope power in
excess of that authorized voids your authority to operate the station.

95.411 (CB RULE 11)  MAY I USE POWER AMPLIFIERS?
     (a)  You must not attach the following items (power amplifiers) to your
type-accepted CB transmitter in any way:
     (1)  External radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (sometimes called
linear amplifiers or linears); OR
     (2)  Any other devices which, when used with a radio transmitter as a sig-
nal source, are capable of amplifying the signal.
     (b)  There are no exceptions to this rule, and use of a power amplifier
voids your authority to operate the CB station.

									  Page 8


CB Rules (continued)

     (c)  The FCC will presume you have used a linear or other external RF power
amplifier if --
     (1)  It is in your possession or on your premises; AND
     (2)  There is other evidence that you have operated your CB station with
more power than allowed by CB Rule 10.
     (d)  Paragraph (c) of this section does not apply if you hold a license in
another radio service which allows you to operate an external RF power ampli-
fier.

95.412 (CB RULE 12)  WHAT COMMUNICATIONS MAY BE TRANSMITTED?
     (a)  You may use your CB station to transmit two-way plain-language com-
munications.  Two-way plain language communications are communications without
codes or coded messages.  Operating signals such as "Ten Codes" [see pages 1 and
2 of this booklet] are not considered codes or coded messages.  You may transmit
two-way plain-language communications only to other CB stations, to units of
your own CB station, or to authorized government stations on CB frequencies
about --
     (1)  Your personal or business activities or those of members of your
immediate family living in your household;

				 Author's Notes:

Part 1 - Legal mumbo-jumbo.

The FCC rules contained in this booklet were current as of 1987.  They may have
been altered as of this writing; if so, any updates will supersede the text con-
tained in this booklet.  Text of FCC laws was entered verbatim from an official
FCC publication, and no alteration has been made by the author to the text or
intent of these rules.	Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the
codes listed in this booklet; however, a few may be incorrect or have non-
standard definitions.

Text of the FCC laws contained may be copyrighted material, property of the
United States Government or the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  Author
of this booklet claims no right or ownership over any material contained herein.

This booklet must be distributed absolutely without charge.  Any persons asking
any price for the distribution of this file may be guilty of illegal sale of
copyrighted material.  I have composed this booklet strictly for the information
of any persons operating in the Citizens Band, or those interested in doing so.
No other purpose is intended or implied.

Part 2 - The other stuff.

This file was originally composed in January 1988.  Minor revisions to the
format of the file were made in December 1990.	I do not have a current copy of
the rules, so I was forced to stay with the 1987 version.  Sorry!

I am not a lawyer, nor am I training to be one.  (The legalese was necessary to
cover my backside. . .)  I am, however, a CB operator who takes an active
interest in his hobby and enjoys talking with others who feel the same.  If
anybody receiving this file knows of any updates or changes which have been made
to any of the FCC rules in this book, please update the text from the OFFICIAL
FCC TEXT and recirculate the file.  Append your name and location to the end of
this page (to cover YOUR backside!).  Please do not substitute bogus text for
the real stuff, as this can get us all into big trouble!  Let it be known here
and now that all text is valid at the origin of this file.  73, all.  905 Live
on the side!
