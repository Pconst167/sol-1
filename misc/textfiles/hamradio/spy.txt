The "spy" numbers decoded....
by
Peter Febbroriello

Those number stations have been driving
a large number of people nutty for a
while now...I believe the mystery is
over, at least part of it anyway.
If the data is copied exactly as
broadcast, it forms a series of number
groups. Preceding these groups is a
count. There is one full count worth of
number groups. the first half of each
group is a three digit number which is
always padded out with zeros. The
second half is a two digit number which
is also padded. If one were to plot these
numbers as separate graphs of data
starting with the first half, and then
the second half, one does not see much
of interest, although the data does seem
to have a periodicity, which would
never appear in a coded message which
used a random code key. If the first
group is plotted against the second
group, a lattice-like pattern is
observed, which resembles the images I
have seen of nuclear particle
disintigration patterns...but i dont
think this is what it is either!
The mystery dissolves when the x axis
goes from 1 to count, the first group
is used for the Y axis and the third
group is used for the Z axis. The
darned thing is an image of some sort!
It's quite obvious, and was probably
originally intended to be a
transmission of vital scientific
importance to a large body of
scientists using a very wide variety of
data crunching programs and methods.
The form of transmission is the most
basic possible to get the job done,
being quite universal, simple, and easy
to decipher without confusion!!!
Below, I have reproduced my first and only
intercepted transmission of "spy" data.
The first file is the raw data. The
second file is an X,Y,Z format file for
use with most good 3d graphics packages.
I would love to get a program that can
translate the Z value to a grey scale
or false color value for CGA or EGA...

X,Y,Z version
If the image is too narrow, I would suggest
expanding the X value by multiplying by a
convenient factor. If you know what the data
really pertains to, you might be able to
incorporate the proper scale into this axis!
