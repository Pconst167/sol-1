                    Original posting 04/01/87

     Does  any  one  have  any  ideas one how  to  make  a  omni-
directional longitudinal scalar wave Receiver & Transmitter?

     In contrast to the common Hertzian transverse vector  waves,
scalar waves travel,  or rather materialize at the receiving end,
at superluminal velocities.   Scalar waves also quite effectively
penetrate trough objects,  such as a Faraday Shield,  which would
stop a ordinary electromagnetic (Hertzian type) wave.

     Shown  below  is a simple directional,  (If there is such  a
thing as being 'to' directional, this system is it!), scalar wave
generator/detector.

     What  I'am  looking  for is a system  that  doesn't  require
LASER like beam alignment.   Any one have any ideas?

Pulse-Frequency-(De)Modulation

     See   Popular Electronics  August  1980,  PG 94 & 95,  for a
simple PFM  Modulator/Demodulator.   Tune the carrier   frequency
so   that  it  falls  in  the "Experimenters band" of 160 to  180
Kilo-Cycles.   [Note:   By  definition  Hertzian type  waves  are
transverse  vector  waves.   So the units used when referring  to
scalar waves should be given in the old form of Cycles-Per-Second
(Kilocycles, KC or Mega-Cycles, MC), to prevent confusion.]

     Just  for the fun of it,  try to measure the impedance,  and
inductance,  of the Caduceus coil, and find its natural  resonate
frequencies.
