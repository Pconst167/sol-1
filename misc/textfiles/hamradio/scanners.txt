          Public Service bands, and some general tips for beginners to
                                   the hobby.

                    This guide is broken down into 3 parts:

                                   Equipment
                               -----------------

                 SCANNER TYPES: tunable, crystal, programmable

  Tunable: Many types of tunable receivers are available to the scanner user.
  most of these have poor image rejection and were low-end units or multiband
  type radios. These were subject to intermod and are only good for a few very
  strong signals and local coverage. Poor choice.

  Crystal: Crystal-controlled scanners have been around since the 60's. These
  radios very from 1 channel to as many as 16 and are very good performers.
  They allow a set, 1 frequency-1 channel capability, and have good image
  rejection and filtering. These radios allow the first time user to sample
  frequencies at relatively low cost per channel, about 5 dollars per crystal.

  Crystal controlled receivers are also good for professional users as the
  cost is low and most Public Service users only need to monitor a few set
  interim channels.

  Programmable: These are by far the best for the serious scanner enthusiast.
  Programmable receivers have good S/N figures, good image rejection, and for
  the most part very little intermodulation. They also allow greater
  flexibility by allowing the user to change channels without spending money
  for crystals. Most all of the programmable radios have LED or LCD readouts
  that give frequency, channel number, and other user information. All have
  memory backup to retain the contents of what has been programed.
  Programmable receivers are by far the best cost per dollar units.

  These radios use to cost 300 to 700 dollars a few years ago but with
  computer technology, low IC cost , they now can be had for a little over
  100.00. The main compromise in price these days for a programmable scanner,
  is channels, frequency coverage, and special features.

  A minimum setup would be 20 channels, and the 118-136 Mhz aircraft band.
  150.00 for this setup.

  Now that the radio is sitting there, how  do you know what frequencies to






  enter ? Most manuals that come with scanners have a spectrum breakdown to
  help new users find a ballpark area of interest.

                                   Antennas:

  Most of the antennas that come with these radios are sufficient for local
  area coverage up to 75 mile radius from the listening post. If you can put
  up and external antenna, your range can be up to 200 miles or more depending
  on the antenna type.







                               External antennas:

       Omni:  omnidirectional, 360 degree radius signal pickup.

       Yagi:  directional, high gain

       beam:  high gain, highly directional

       discone: high gain, wide bandwidth, omnidirectional


  Your choice of external antennas depends on what services you are looking to
  hear most. Beam antennas are good for long range, single frequency coverage.

  Omni's pull in many signals, where discone and yagi's tend to have higher
  gain and wider bandwidths. A good compromise to all these antennas is the
  Discone, with wide coverage and good signal pulling power.


  Once you have your radio and antenna set up, keep in mind these tips: keep
  your squelch control at a low threshold level, you will hear more. Weak
  stations can sometimes be improved by re-orienting your antenna. Use NOAA
  Wx. stations for your area, when aligning your antenna or testing. These
  stations are continuous broadcast and can gauge receiver/antenna
  performance.

  Strong carriers can either be real signals or harmonics caused by other
  equipment, computers, printers, clocks, TV's, etc. Reorienting the scanner
  antenna sometimes will keep these signal from locking up the scanner. If the
  area you are in is really bad, you can buy filters that lock out these
  adjacent signals. Some phantom signals are caused by the radio itself.
  These are called "intermod" and "birdies", Intermod is caused by two
  internally generated signals causing a third order harmonic that locks up
  the scanner. "Birdies are caused by clock and timing signals in
  microprocessor controlled radio's, most of these occur at only a few
  frequencies over the entire range of the radio and can not be locked out.
  Most makers of scanners have installed filters to keep this from happening.

                                Search Scanning:

  Searching for new frequencies with a programmable scanner is accomplished by
  entering "upper and lower" frequency limits. A word of note, only enter a 1
  megahertz search area.  The reason for this is, the smaller the search area
  the more likelihood of finding new frequencies .I.E  155-156 mhz. Another
  tip is to put the delay function on during search mode. This allows you to
  note the frequency and also allows for a reply. When monitoring a
  transmission, take notes as to ID codes and or FCC call letters. Most public
  service users are required to ID their station at least once every 5
  minutes.

                                  Other Tips:

  Inclement weather, storms, major events etc. have a tendency to increase
  radio traffic. During storms, monitor local road crews, rescue services,
  and other public service bands. The local officials generally are the people
  " out in the thick of it", and you can glean much info on area road
  conditions or detours etc. from this monitoring.

                             Mobile Installations:







  Check first your local laws covering radios capable of monitoring police
  frequencies in a vehicle, before installing a scanner in your car. The city
  of Philadelphia at one time had a law making it illegal and a 1st offense
  punishable by a 500.00 dollar fine and confiscation of the equipment.  Most
  radios today have a 12 volt DC negative ground option or jack for mobile
  use. Once a suitable location and power requirements are met, all that is
  left is mounting the unit and running the antenna. These instructions are
  generally included in the owners manual.


                **** Section 605, ECPA, and Responsibility ****

  As a hobbiest, it is important to observe a few rules pertaining to the
  scanner hobby. First use of information overheard via a scanner for personal
  gain, criminal purposes, or interference  with public safety, is not only
  illegal but strongly enforced. Chasing ambulances, fire trucks etc. will
  cause you to quickly loose your licence and may get you arrested. Other
  responsibility falls into one important category:  Restraint. If you happen
  to stumble across a set of frequencies used by local or federal law
  enforcement officials, keep in mind that disclosure of any information you
  may hear could interfere with a drug stake-out, hostage situation, or other
  life threatening scenario.  There are situations where news media people, in
  their zeal to cover a story have caused the deaths of hostages after showing
  up on a scene after overhearing the operation on their scanners. Police,
  Fire and Government officials have jobs to do, and don't need interference
  from the public. Keep what you hear to yourself.


               The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986


  This bill which is currently pass the senate and in the house of
  representatives, is a bill designed by the cellular lobby to restrict what
  you can and cannot listen to. In it's present form it makes it illegal to
  "willfully" monitor any two-way communication primarily seen as closed to
  the public.  This includes mobile phone, remote broadcast pickup, and
  certain other services, this law is seen by the FCC and the Justice Dept.
  as being unenforceable, but as with any bad law it will no doubt have to be
  tested in court before it is reformed or rewritten.

  Footnote: Scanning can be and enjoyable hobby and give the listener a better
  insight into where his/her tax dollars are being spent. Public servants are
  there for helping the people and enforcing the laws. The United States is
  the only country in the world where monitoring is allowed, It is a privilege
  that few other countries show their citizens. Be responsible and enjoy!
