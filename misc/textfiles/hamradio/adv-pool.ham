                     QUESTION POOL SUPPLEMENT
 
                            ELEMENT 4A     
 
4AA-2.03
    B.  Only if the station is a repeater or space station
 
4AA-3.02
What is a closed repeater?
    A.  A repeater containing control circuitry that limits      
  repeater access to certain users
 
4AA-4.01
    D.  Transmission of communications point-to-point within a   
     system of cooperating amateur stations.
 
4AA-4.02
    C  Passing of international third-party communications
 
4AA-5.01
    D.  The use of a control operator who indirectly manipulates
        the operating adjustments in the station through a control
        link
4AA-5.03
{97.213 says "An amateur station may be remotely controlled where:
  (B)  Provisions are incorporated to limit transmission by the 
       station to a period of no more than 3 minutes in the event
       of malfunction in the control link."
 
We would have the same meaning if it had said "Capability is
provided to limit the transmission by the station. . .  . . . "  -
there is no need to shut down the repeater (ever) just because the
control link goes on the blink.  The only requirement is that we
be able to do so - and the three-minute timer provides this
capability.  My desk-top dictionary at the office defines
"incorporate" as "1. to combine or join with something already
formed; make part of another thing; include; embody  2.  to bring
together into a single whole; merge"   I consider this question to
have been quite poorly written in the original pool, and it is that
defect I am trying to correct}
