                     REGISTRATION OF DOMAIN NAMES
                      FOR BITNET, CSNET AND UUCP

UUCP, BITNET, or CSNET members who wish to join existing domains or
establish new domains should do this through the appropriate
administrative channels for those organizations.  The contacts
for UUCP, BITNET and CSNET are listed below.

CSNET -  CSNET Coordination and Information Center
         (617) 873-2777
         Netmail: CIC@SH.CS.NET

UUCP -   UUNET Communications
         (703) 876-5050
         Netmail: POSTMASTER@UUNET.UU.NET, postmaster!uunet

BITNET - BITNET Network Information Center
         (609) 520-3340
         Netmail: info%bitnic@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU


                          GENERAL PROCEDURE

-  The administrator of each of these organization will process domain
   applications from his/her members and forward them to the NIC
   (HOSTMASTER@NIC.DDN.MIL) in groups.  The NIC will provide a
   special form for this process online in
   NETINFO:ALTERNATE-DOMAIN-TEMPLATE.TXT.  This template can be FTPed
   by the administrator, or Hostmaster can send it via electronic
   mail.  The application form in the online file
   NETINFO:BITNET-DOMAIN-TEMPLATE.TXT is available for BITNET users.

-  The NIC will check for domain name conflicts and notify the
   administrators in case of conflicts.

-  If the names are valid, the NIC will generate name server records
   for each of the new domains.

-  The administrators of each organization agree to provide a contact for
   the domains in their networks. 

-  Hostmaster will notify administrators of acceptance or rejection
   of applications.


                  MAINTENANCE OF DOMAIN INFORMATION

Periodically, each organization should review the information on file
at the NIC.  The most simple way to do this is by using the NIC WHOIS
server and typing "whois domain <domain name> <Return>" at the prompt.
If any changes are required, the administrator should contact the NIC
Hostmaster.
