Note: My UWFGAMER account is dead, please do not mail that account.


FLAME WARNING:

    Tired of seeing the SAME old sorry FTP FAQ running around?  Well I am!
This article is for everyone to enjoy, and this site list HAS been checked.
It is accurate up to May 30, 1994 (I checked them all).  
    I also grew weary of reading those tired old listserv/discussion list
FAQs.  My version (with TONS of discussions included) will be posted in a
week or so (as soon as all my inquiry e-mails are returned).
    I hope after I am gone somebody will keep these files clear of old
information and update it to reflect our Net gaming choices!

===========================================================================
DISCLAIMER:
    If you don't see an active site listed, or you are the admin of one
of the below-mentioned sites (and you want your site removed) contact me.
I searched for "RPG-like" keywords in Archie and only found these, plus
some others I know about that are not listed with Archie.

    Also, if a site name or IP number is incorrect please contact me at:
tverity@castaway.cc.uwf.edu.  I'll be here for a couple more months, there-
after I might have another person who you can contact (I may be going
off to the U.S. Navy) to keep this list TRUELY up-to-date.  Also, if you
decide to keep vigilant and update this list, PLEASE keep my name on this
file and change the date on it (feel free to place you name on the file
as an updater).

    First I would like to inform you about the closing of a few sites, 
just in case you used to be connected to the Net.  Please do not FTP
to the following sites, they are confirmed as dead:

polyslo.csc.colpoly.edu			snow.white.toronto.edu
piggy.ucsb.edu				ucbvax.berkeley.edu
quayle.mu.wvnet.edu			rainbow (134.114.64.24)
