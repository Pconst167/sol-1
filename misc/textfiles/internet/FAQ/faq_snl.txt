Q:  What is SNL?
A:  SNL is Saturday Night Live.  It is a comedy/music
    television show on the NBC television network.  It
    is usually broadcast on Saturday nights at 11:30pm
    ET.  The show was originally called NBC's Saturday
    Night because there was a show on ABC starring Howard
    Cosell at the same time called Saturday Night Live.
    The producers later gained permission to rename the
    show.  The "Not Ready For Prime Time Players" moniker
    also came from ABC's Saturday Night Live actors who
    called themselves the "Prime Time Players".


Q:  Is it really live?
A:  Yes, it is broadcast live (except for a few taped
    segments such as the fake commercials).  There were
    also three occasions when it was broadcast on a delay
    because of the reputations of the hosts.  These were:

    Dec 13, 1975:  Richard Pryor      (5 second delay)
    Nov 15, 1986:  Sam Kinison        (7 second delay?)
    May 12, 1990:  Andrew Dice Clay   (7 second delay?)


Q:  Is there an episode guide?
A:  There will be one someday.  I've been working on an
    episode guide since early 1990, but my time gets more
    and more scarce.  I might be posting finished excerpts
    from it in the near future.  Please stay tuned.


Q:  Where is the show broadcast from?
A:  Studio 8-H in 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City.  There
    have been a couple of exceptions to this.  During the 1976
    presidential campaigns Studio 8-H was taken over for poli-
    tical coverage and the shows of 23 Oct 1976, 30 Oct 1976,
    and 13 Nov 1976 were broadcast from NBC's Studio One in
    Brooklyn.  There was also a special Mardi Gras show that
    was done live during primetime from New Orleans on 20 Feb
    1977 (which was a Sunday).


Q:  Wasn't Steve Martin a player?
A:  One word:  No.  Steve Martin has hosted the most times,
    but he was never a regular player.  While we're at
    it, neither was Buck Henry, although he has hosted
    second most often.  If you have seen a "Best of Sat-
    urday Night" broadcast when Steve was hosting you
    would have seen him listed alphabetically with the
    players.  This has led to some confusion on the topic.


Q:  What is a "Five Timer"?
A:  People who have hosted the show five times or more.
    This was given heavy coverage in a sketch on 8 Dec
    1990 when Tom Hanks hosted his 5th show.  Five-Timers
    Paul Simon, Steve Martin, and Elliott Gould showed
    up and inducted Tom into the "Five Timers Club."  The
    other people who have hosted five times or more are
    Candice Bergen, Buck Henry, and Chevy Chase.


Q:  How do I get tickets for SNL?
A:  You can write to:

    Saturday Night Live
    c/o NBC
    30 Rockefeller Plaza
    New York City, NY  10112

    Their selection process is rather strange.  According to Bill
    Dennen, your request must be postmarked in August.  All other
    requests are thrown away.  Also, the numbers of requests is
    high, so you will be very lucky to receive tickets.


Q:  How can I contact Lorne Michaels?
A:  Write to:

    Lorne Michaels
    c/o Broadway Video
    1619 Broadway
    New York City, NY  10019


Q:  Gilda married *who*?
A:  GE Smith.  Yes, before Gilda Radner married Gene Wilder
    she was married to GE (George Edward) Smith.


Q:  Which star has been on the show the longest?
A:  Phil Hartman started his 8th season of SNL on 25 Sep 1993.  Kevin
    Nealon has also been around since 1986, but he started as a featured
    player.  Also, writers and featured players Al Franken and Tom Davis
    have been with the show for most of its run.


Q:  Who were the youngest and oldest hosts?
A:  Technically, George Carlin was the youngest *and* oldest
    host on the first show, but let's not get silly.  As of
    this writing, Drew Barrymore is the youngest host in SNL
    history.  Here are the ages of the hosts under 18:

    Date              Host            Age
    ----              ----            ---
    27 Nov 1976       Jodie Foster    14y  0m  8d
    20 Nov 1982       Drew Barrymore   7y  8m 29d
    24 Feb 1990       Fred Savage     13y  7m 15d
    23 Nov 1991       Macaulay Culkin 11y  2m 28d

    The oldest host was a lady named Miskel Spillman.  She was
    an 80+ year old grandmother that won the "Anyone Can Host"
    contest held in 1977.  She and four other finalists (Richard
    Canipe, Connie Crawford, David Lewis, and Deb Blair) appeared
    on the 19 Nov 1977 show.  Viewers were asked to write in and
    vote for their favorite.  Miskel won and hosted the Christ-
    mas show on 17 Dec.  The second oldest host was Ruth Gordon
    who was 80 when she hosted on 22 Jan 1977.


Q:  Weren't The Beatles on the show?
A:  Sort of yes and no.  On either 17 or 24 Apr 1976, Lorne
    Michaels offered The Beatles $3000 to appear on SNL and
    sing three songs.  On 20 Nov, George Harrison showed up
    and tried to claim all the money himself.  Lorne said
    that if it was up to him, George could have the money,
    but NBC wouldn't agree.  When Paul McCartney appeared on
    the show on 13 Feb 1993 he and Lorne were seen talking
    about the offer during the monologue.  Paul also appered
    on 17 May 1980.  Ringo Starr hosted on 08 Dec 1984.  John
    Lennon never appeared.


Q:  It's only x weeks into the season.  Why are they showing reruns?
A:  SNL usually broadcasts three live shows in a row and then
    takes a week off.  Once in Jan 1976 four shows where done
    in a row and it was so stressful they vowed never to do it
    again.  Sometimes it seems we're lucky to get two new shows
    in a row.


Q:  Didn't somebody get fired for saying "fuck" on the air?
A:  Depends on how you look at it.  On 21 Feb 1981 (when the
    show was doing very poorly) there was a running "who shot
    J.R. Ewing" gag.  At the end of the show Charlene Tilton
    was on stage with Charles Rocket (who was playing J.R.)
    and she asked how he felt.  Charles responded:  "Oh man,
    it's the first time I've been shot in my life.  I'd like
    to know who the fuck did it."  Needless to say, NBC offi-
    cials were not happy.  On Monday 10 Mar 1981, Jean Doumanian
    (the post-Lorne Michaels producer), and most of the play-
    ers were fired.  Only Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo sur-
    vived.  There was also a featured player who accidently
    mumbled "fuckin'" instead of "friggin'" during a sketch.
    It was none other than our good friend Mr. Paul Shaffer on
    15 Mar 1980.  You can hear a couple of people in the
    audience gasp after the mistake, but nothing much else
    came of it. 


Q:  Has anybody else said "fuck" on the show?
A:  Yes, according to Jarret Cooper <jcooper@uicslsw.csl.uiuc.edu>:

    To the list of people who have said "fuck" on SNL, add Morris Day
    (of The Time).  The Time appeared on the 1990 show featuring host
    George Steinbrenner (20 Oct 1990 -ed.), and performed "Jerk Out"
    and "Chocolate".  During the second song, there is a pantomime
    about Morris going to a restaurant for dinner.  At the end of the
    song, after "dinner" arrives, the music stops, and in the few
    seconds of silence before the "finale", Morris quite clearly looks
    at Jerome and says:

    "Where the fuck this chicken come from -- I thought I ordered ribs!"


    Oh, and also (as detailed in the "SNL:  Backstage History" book,
    Prince did NOT refrain from using the lyric "Fightin' war is such
    a fuckin' bore" during his performance of "Partyup" on the same
    night as Rocket's "who the fuck did it" line.


    And Eddie Tillis <tillis@icpsr.umich.edu>:

    I remember a show where Tony Danza guest hosted (19 Aug 1986 or
    28 Jan 1989 -ed.), and they did a sketch on stereotypical Italians
    (or "Tonys," I'm not sure ).  The last line in the sketch was
    Tony's and he said "Fuckin' A!"


Q:  Who is the voice at the beginning of the show?
A:  None other than veteran NBC announcer Don Pardo.


Q:  Didn't somebody else announce in the early 80's?
A:  Yes.  Mel Brandt announced the 1981-1982 season with
    the exception of 5 and 12 Dec 1981 which were done by
    Bill Hanrahan.


Q:  Who's in the cast?
A:  Please see the posting "Saturday Night Live FAQ:  Quick Bios".


Q:  What else have they been in?
A:  Please see the posting "Saturday Night Live FAQ:  Other Credits".


Q:  How can I learn more about SNL?
A:  See the posting "Saturday Night Live FAQ:  References".  It contains
    a (currently short) list of books and articles about the show.

Saturday Night Live FAQ:  Recurring Characters
==============================================
Saturday Night Recurring Characters is a list of recurring characters
from NBC's Saturday Night.  I have tried to limit the list to recurring
characters, but some of the single appearance characters have been
memorable enough to list them anyway.  I'm also listing anytime a
player has done a celebrity.  There have also been hosts that have
played recurring characters.  A few of them have been added at the
end of the list.

   Hardwick have spent fourteen seasons in the band, though Cheryl took
   five years off to do other things. 

   The band has released two albums: "The Saturday Night Live Band" on
   ProJazz records, featuring the Tom Malone-led group of the early 80's,
   and "G.E. Smith And The Saturday Night Live Band: Get A Little" on
   Liberty records featuring the entire current lineup with the exception
   of Chris Parker, who returned to the band for the album.

you'll be entertained and a little moved."

[singing]

Love to eat turkey
Love to eat turkey
Love to eat turkey cause it's good
Love to eat turkey like a good boy should
Cause it's turkey to eat,
So good

A turkey for me, turkey for you,
Let's eat turkey in a big brown shoe.

Love to eat turkey at the table,
I once saw a movie with Betty Grable.
Eat that turkey all night long,
50 million Elvis fans can't be wrong.
 
Turkey turkey dee, turkey turkey dap,
I eat the turkey and I take a nap
 
[melody changes]
 
Thanksgiving is a special night
Jimmie Walker used to say "Dynomite"
That's right!

[melody changes back]

Turkey with the gravy and the cranberry
Can't believe the Mets traded Darryl Strawberry
 
Turkey for you, turkey for me,
Can't believe Tyson gave the girl V.D.
 
Gobble gobble dee, gobble gobble dawkie,
I used to go to camp at Lake Winnepesaukee
 
[spoken] Adam: "Come on, Kevin."
Kevin: "No, that's okay."
Adam: "Oh, it'll be funnn."
Kevin: "Okay."
 
[Kevin and Adam singing in (somewhat) unison]
Turkey turkey dee, turkey turkey duffin,
Love to eat turkey with a lot of stuffin'
Turkey for me, turkey for you,
Let's eat turkey in a big brown shoe.
 
Turkey and sweet potato pie,
Sammy Davis Jr. only had one eye
Turkey with the girls, turkey with the boys,
My favorite kind of pants are corduoroys
 
Gobble gobble gee, gobble gobble gickle
I wish turkeys only cost a nickel.
 
[song slows]
Oh, I love turkey .. on Thanksgivingggggg

[spoken]
Adam: "Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!"

Red Hooded Sweatshirt
by Adam Sandler
performed on 1993.02.13

My mom bought you when I was just 13,
 the brightest red sweatshirt I ever seen.
She got an extra large so I wouldn't grow out,
 "That's too big for you!" the other kids would shout.
But we stuck together, we didn't quit,
 and now the children say, "What a perfect fit."

I love you sweeeeatshirt

I like to rest my hands in your kangaroo pouch,
 it makes them feel comfy like a big soft couch.
And I don't care if the weather's no good,
 I say "See you later rain" as I pull up my hood.
Remember that long bus trip when I needed a nap?,
 I used you as a pillow on that Spanish lady's lap.

I love you sweeeeatshirt
red hooded

Oh what is it about you that makes me so jolly?,

Oh red hooded sweatshirt we been through a lot together
like that time I played in that shirts and skins basketball game
and I had to take you off and throw you in the corner of the gym.
I was midway through the game and then I saw you looking at me.
You were staring as if to say "Adam, you suck at basketball,
you dribble like a damn woman."  I was so mad I challenged you
to a game of one on one and you know sweatshirt, even though I
beat you 11 to 9, deep in my soul I know you missed those lay-ups
on purpose.  You let me win and that why (Kevin, please help

Mother's Day Song
by Adam Sandler
performed 1993.05.08

Mama was the one who reached down and tied my shoelace.
Mama spit on her fingers and used it to clean dirt off my face.

Brush your teeth, Q-tip your ear,
 take off your sister's new brassiere.
Watch PBS, not Deputy Dawg,
 don't you eat that Lincoln Log.

Oh mama I still don't believe
it's true:  The tooth fairy was you.
No Way!

I love you maaaaaama,
more than than paaaastrama,
way more than Jeffrey Daaaahma,
even more than my NFL paaaaajamas.

Mama always calmed down dad when he got too mean.
Like the time he almost hit me for stealing his Juggs magazine.

Stop your jumping,
 you'll break the bed.
Don't you fill up
 on the bread.
Take those
Take those
(trying to read cue card)
Take ... carrots out of your nose,
 that's not a hat that's pantyhose.
Don't play baseball in your suit,
 that Magnum PI's very cute.
Don't forget Vick's Vapor-rub,
 stop masturbating in the tub.
Thanks for making corn beef hash,
 and putting powder on my rash.
(So much better.)

I love you maaaaaama,
more than golf with Arnold Paaaaalmaaaa,
more than yellow moons in Lucky Chaaaaamaaaas,
Def Leppard's drummer only had one aaaaaaamaaa.

Oh, Mrs. Nealon, yes it's true,
Kevin's gonna sing to you.

Come on Kevin.

I love you maaaaaama (kevin)

Come on, keep goin'.

More than films by Brian DePaaaaalmaaaa.  (kevin)

Thanks for being my date to the praaaaamaaaa.

Thanks for writing that note to the draft
board that said I was gay so I got out
of Vietnaaaamaaa.  (kevin)

Mom your way better than the World Trade Center baaaaamaaaa.

Who's name by the way is Mohamed Salaaaamaaa.  (kevin)

I love you even more than Richard Gere loves the Dali Laaaaahmaaa.

And Richard Gere was also good in "Sommersby",
which was a melodraaaamaa.  (kevin)

Oh, all you moms out there oughta know,
we kids love you so.

Have a Happy Mother's Day.
Thank you very much!
Thank you!

Adam Saaaandlaaa.  (kevin)

Santa Song
by Adam Sandler
performed on 1993.12.11

So many presents, 
so little time,
Santa won't be coming around my house this year,
'cos I tried to drown my sister and I pierced my ear,
Oh mama made it perfectly clear,
Santa don't like bad boys...especially Jewish ones.

Gnip-gnop and lego blocks are all that I desire,
so why did I have to set the pizza guy's hair on fire,
I told him I was sorry,
I'm a liar, 
so no toys for me...I don't deserve them.

I couldn't wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared,
but then I told my grandma that she had a beard.


Dear Santa,

I know what my problem is, why I can't be good, it's a fear of intimacy.
You see my whole life whenever I've met someone really great like you and
I keep feeling like I'm getting close to them, something inside me makes
me want to screw it up. So in a weird way the reason I'm so bad is because
I love you santa.


Rock-em Sock-em Robots is what I was hoping for,
but then I made a death threat to vice president Gore,
oh santa won't be knocking on my door,
'cos he's a big fat whore...what made me say that?

Chutes and ladders would be so good indeed,
so why'd I have to sell that cop a bag of weed,
so Santa please give me that easy bake oven,
I swear I thought billy goats we're made for lovin'.

So Santa won't you accept my apologies,
Santa can't you see I'm begging you please,
oh Santa next year I'll do you right,
Live from New York it's Saturday night...

Saturday Night Live FAQ:  Wayne's World Guide
=============================================
Note:  I (dkrause@uci.edu) did not write this.  I have only
added it to my SNL Archives.  If you know how to contact the
original author (wurtz@cvedc.Prime.COM), please let me know.


            The Peristaltic Waynes World Compendium
                    By wurtz@cvedc.Prime.COM

I am actually not sure of the definite date of the first Waynes World,
but sources in Aurora, Illinois place it around October of 1988.
Previous sightings of the Wayne character are reported to have been
seen at the Toronto Second City Club (Classic Quote: "She puked on your
stereo? She loves you, man"), and later on CBC television show It's
only Rock and Roll. The latter being a clip called Waynes Power Minute
in which he covered such pertinent subjects as an ambulance service
for rock concert injuries (like burning your thumb with the lighter),
and Wayne receiving an air guitar for Christmas. He finally hit the
big time on SNL.  I'll just briefly summarize each episode and leave
it open for questions if anyone wants to know more about a particular
episode.

Feb 18, 1989??
Episode One: Kind of an introduction episode where we meet Garth's
Dad, the Beav, owner of the Wishing Well convenience store. They
do Waynes Top Ten things that Beav says. The number one thing is
"Hi, I'm Beav and I'm a Big Fag." Beav storms out and bans Wayne
from the store. Next guest, Nancy, an excellent babe. Last segment,
they take a phone call, in which the guy on the other end says that
his girlfriend blew chunks on him while necking.

Mar 25, 1989
Episode Two: Wayne makes it up to the Beav by letting Beav do a 
plug for the Wishing Well convenience store on WW, during which
Wayne holds up a big sign saying Big Fag with an arrow pointing
to Beav. Next guest: Miss Simpson (Mary Tyler Moore), the math 
teacher, who asked to be on the show.

May 13, 1989
Episode Three: First segment, Movie World. Then it's an interview
with the Great One, Wayne Gretzky. Wayne has a dream sequence where
he beats Gretzky one on one in hockey and gets Janet Jones, Gretzky's
wife.

Sep 30, 1989
Episode Four: The coolest guy in the senior class, Rick (Bruce Willis),
unveils the new cool word for the school year, sphincter. They make a
crank call upstairs, where Wayne's parentals are having a party, asking
for Wayne to speak to a Mr. Sphincter. After Rick leaves Nancy comes
running down "like a nympho." Wayne fishes in Nancy telling her that Rick
has the hots for her.

Dec 2, 1989
Episode Five: Guest, Police Chief Wilson. Wayne and Garth serve penance
for hurling snowballs at traffic, by helping Police Chief Wilson (John
Goodman) re-enact a crime on Aurora's Most Wanted. The crime is trivial so
Wayne and Garth embellish it a little.

Jan 13, 1990
Episode Six: Guest, Mr. Hemple (Ed O'Neill), the Drivers Ed instructor.
Wayne and Garth serve penance for bringing drinks into the drivers ed
room, when there's a humongoid sign telling you not to. They do a
Public Service Announcement illustrating the evils of drinking and
driving.

Feb 17, 1990
Episode Seven: Guests, Garths Cousin Barry and Aerosmith. Garth gets his
cousin Barry (Tom Hanks), a roady for Aerosmith, to get the band on the
show to help publicize their upcoming show.  In return they have to put
Barry on the air. Aerosmith appears and Wayne and Garth play the Wayne's
World Theme Song with them (**).

Mar 24, 1990
Episode Eight: Guest, Lisa. Wayne and Garth give their own academy awards
in which Batman wins every catagory except Best Foreign Film. Lisa (Debra
Winger) comes on and Wayne holds Chick Court to clear her name after Nancy
has spread rumors about her.

May 19, 1990
Episode Nine: Guest, Garth's Mom, Mrs. Algar. Wayne has a "Summer
of 42," fantasy, in which he makes it with Garth's Mom (Candice Bergen),
which is interrupted by Garth, who shoots Wayne.

Dec 1, 1990
Episode Ten: Wayne's World After Hours. Wayne and Garth have to 
move to Garth's house to show the new Madonna video and then they
are busted by Police Chief Wilson for showing pornography.

Jan 19, 1991
Episode Eleven: Excellent Report. Wayne and Garth critique the Gulf
War and network coverage thereof after watching 72 straight hours
of news surviving on nothing but Pizza Hut Pizza and Jolt Cola.

*****

** Waynes World Theme Song

Waynes World, Waynes World
It's Party Time, It's Excellent
Waynes World, Waynes World
It's Party Time, It's Excellent

Chicks Go mental when they walk down the street
Cause it's Wayne and Garth they want to meet.
We're down in the basement playing with our toys,
and if you do not like it you're a sphincter boy.

Waynes World, Waynes World
It's Party Time, It's Excellent
Waynes World, Waynes World
It's Party Time, It's Excellent

Saturday Night Live FAQ:  References
====================================
This is a list of written references for Saturday Night Live.  It
is intended as a pointer for those who want to learn more about the
show.


-1-
Saturday night: a backstage history of Saturday night live (1986)
by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad

I highly recommend this book.  It gives a detailed, in-depth
analysis of the show from its beginning to 1984 or so.  Most
of the information comes from interviews and the authors view-
ing old episodes on videotape.


-2-
SNL!  The world of saturday night live
by Hal Schuster

I don't not recommend this book on the whole.  It has some
interesting information and pictures, but it is poorly written
and has many errors (including at least three different spellings
of Aykroyd).  Another glaring error is in the biography section.
The page devoted to John Belushi has a picture of his brother,
Jim.  If you can check this book out from a library, go ahead and
get it.  But be sure to take all the information in it with a
shaker of salt.


Please send any corrections or new information to dkrause@uci.edu.
