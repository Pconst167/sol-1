Introduction
------------
The Usenet software allows the support and transport of hierarchies of
newsgroups not part of the "traditional" Usenet through use of the
distribution mechanism. These hierarchies of groups are available to
sites wishing to support them and finding a feed.  In general, these
groups are not carried by the entire network due to their volume, a
restricted sphere of interest, or a different set of administrative
rules and concerns.

In general it is a bad idea to forward these newsgroups to your
neighbors without asking them first; they should only be received at a
site by choice.  Not only is this generally-accepted net etiquette, it
helps to preserve the freedom to do and say as the posters please in
these newsgroups, since the only people who get them are those who
asked to get them.  This freedom is more restricted in the Usenet as a
whole, since every mainstream posting and every mainstream newsgroup
name must be acceptable to a much wider audience than is present in
these hierarchies.   Due to the sheer size of the mainstream Usenet,
extra-long or controversial postings are more likely to cause problems
when posted to the Usenet; however, these alternative hierarchies exist
precisely to support those kinds of postings (if germane to the
hierarchy).

Usually, there is is no restriction on getting these groups as long
as you have the capacity to receive, store, and forward the groups;
2.10.3 or 2.11 news is required to make the distribution mechanism
work properly for these groups.  How to join each distribution is
described below.

Note that the "uunet" service carries all of these hierarchies.
Contact uunet!uunet-request for subscription details.

Also note -- the lists in this article are totally unofficial and
possibly incomplete or inaccurate.  I try to keep the lists up-to-date,
but make no guarantee that any of the information contained corresponds
with the named groups in any significant way.  Corrections and comments
should be mailed directly to me.

GNU
---
gnUSENET (gnUSENET is Not USENET) is a set of newsgroups that are
gated bi-directionally with the Internet mailing lists of the GNU
Project of the Free Software Foundation.  GNU (GNU's Not Unix) will be
a complete operating system, including application programs, with
freely redistributable source code.  Please use ONLY gnu.misc.discuss
for discussion of topics considered contrary to GNU aims and political
philosophy (e.g., porting of GNU code to Apple machines, usefulness of
intellectual property laws, etc.).

The GNU mailing lists and newsgroups, like the GNU project itself,
exist to promote the freedom to share software.  So please don't use
these newsgroups (or the other GNU lists) to promote or recommend
non-free software.  (Using them to post ordering information is the
ultimate faux pas.)  If there is no free program to do a certain task,
then somebody should write one!

Current groups include:

Newsgroup		Description
---------		-----------

gnu.bash.bug	Bourne Again SHell bug reports and suggested fixes. (Moderated)

Use gnu.emacs.help to discuss software on gnu.emacs.sources and to ask
for sources.  gnu.emacs.sources is archived by many sites and they
want sources ONLY!

The gnu.*.bug groups are pseudo-moderated (that is, the group is
marked moderated so that postings are mailed to prep.ai.mit.edu and
then redistributed to the both the mailing list and newsgroup from
there).  The gnu.*announce groups all fully moderated.

If one of your USENET feeds, can't provide you with a feed of the
gnUSENET newsgroups, send mail to gnu.gnusenet.config@prep.ai.mit.edu
to ask a feed.

Questions about GNU can be directed to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu or:

We are willing to distribute these newsgroups via NNTP to any site
that desires to carry them.  If you would like a feed of these
newsgroups, have the newsadmin for your site contact 'usenet@ieee.org'
for a feed.

These newsgroups are not available for UUCP feeds at this time.
However, an intermediate site getting this feed from us is free to
distribute them via UUCP to other sites.

Inet/DDN
--------
Another alternative hierarchy is the "inet/ddn" distribution.  This
consists of many newsgroups bearing names similar to traditional Usenet
groups and corresponding to Internet discussion lists.  These groups are
circulated using the NNTP transport mechanism amongst sites on the
Internet in an attempt to reduce the number of copies of these groups
flowing through the mail (some sites get these groups via UUCP and
other tranpost mechanisms, but the volume can be substantial and load
may be significant without a high-speed link).  Further details may be
obtained by writing to Erik Fair (fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu).

Pubnet
------
The "pubnet" distribution is for public-access systems and was originated
by Bill Wisner.  Current groups include:

pubnet.config	 Pubnet connectivity discussions.
pubnet.nixpub	 The "nixpub" list of public access UNIXes.
pubnet.sources	 Software of interest to BBS users and sysops.
pubnet.talk	 Miscellaneous BBS talk.
pubnet.test	 Pubnet subnet testing.
pubnet.wanted	 "Wanted" messages with a limited audience.
pubnet.sysops	 Discussions between sysops of BBS systems.

Currently, the following sites receive the group, and the system admins
there can be contacted for more info or to establish a feed:  chinet,
dasys1, ddsw1, icus, igloo, ncoast, qetzal, rpi.edu,
telly, mit-eddie and tapa.

Unix-PC
-------
Another such hierarchy is the "unix-pc" distribution.  This consists of
groups devoted to users of the AT&T Unix-PC.  These groups were
originated as a mailing list started by three owners of AT&T Unix PCs:
Gary Smith, David Dalton and Kathy Vincent.  As the list expanded, it
turned into a newsgroup hierarchy, and more and more sites began to
carry the groups; hundreds of sites now carry these groups.  To receive
them, you need to contact a site already getting them; att, gatech,
mit-eddie, psuvax1, ucsd and ukma are well-known sites getting these
groups and the admins there may be willing to help find a feed should
you desire (and ask nicely); uunet also carries these groups. The
unix-pc groups circulated include:

unix-pc.bugs		Bug reports, fixes & workarounds.
unix-pc.general 	General information and discussion.
unix-pc.sources 	Source code to various programs.
unix-pc.uucp 		Configuration and management of uucp on Unix-PCs.
unix-pc.test 		Test group.

U3B
---
Groups dealing with AT&T 3B{2,5,15,20,4000} computers -- everything
except for the UNIX PC/3B1.  Both uunet and ames carry these groups.

u3b.config     3B Distribution configuration.
u3b.misc       3B Miscellaneous Discussions.
u3b.sources    Sources for AT&T 3B systems.
u3b.tech       3B Technical Discussions.
u3b.test       3B Distribution Testing.

Len Rose (len@netsys.netsys.com) oversees these groups.


VMSnet
------

This hierarchy is for topics of interest to VAX/VMS sites. This hierarchy
is still relatively new. uunet.uu.net and many (if not most) major usenet
sites carry these groups. If you have trouble finding a feed, contact
tp@mccall.com, or send mail to vmsnet@drycas.club.cc.cmu.edu, which is a
mailing list gatewayed to vmsnet.uucp.

vmsnet.admin             Administration of the VMSnet newsgroups.
