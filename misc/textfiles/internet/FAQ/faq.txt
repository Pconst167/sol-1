Subject: 1) What is Islam?	

    The word "Islam"  in  Arabic  Language  means  "submission"  & "peace" A
    Muslim is a person who submits to  the  will  of Allah and finds therein
    peace. Islam is derived from the Arabic word "salaam" meaning peace. 

    Who are the  Muslims?  The  common  answer  is  "the  Arabs."  This is a
    mistaken impression that is true  only  insofar as Islam arose among the
    Arabs, its Prophet and many of its adherents were and are Arabs, and its
    scripture, the Holy Quran, must be recited  in original Arabic form. The
    Arabs comprise only 25 % of the  present  population of Islam. They form
    majority of the population  in  roughly  thirty-six  (36)  countries and
    nearly half of the population in five  others. The estimated strength of
    Islam is estimated to be one  billion people,  almost one fifth of world
    population.  Islam  is  the  world's   third   largest religion,  behind
    Christianity and Buddhism,and its  present  rate  of growth and vitality
    rivals both traditions. 

    Muslims represent many races and socioeconomic settings. There have been
    however significant divisions of opinion  within the umma  (commonwealth 
    of Islam or  Islamic Community). Despite these differences, Islam brings 
    unity by incorporating divergent interpretations of basic beliefs. 

    SUNNI: The recorded practice  and  teachings  of  Prophet  Mohammad were
    early regarded as his Sunnah,  meaning  'path' or 'way.' These traditions
    became powerful symbols for the Islamic religion, models of right belief
    and practice. The collection of  Prophet  Mohammad's  sayings are called
    "Hadith" comprising Sunnah or  "authoritative  examples."  These required
    further interpretations  and application  to  a variety of situations of
    everyday life. 

    Majority of  Muslims  following  Sunnah  of  Prophet  Mohammad are termed
    "Sunnis." Islam developed  four schools of jurisprudence  whose functions
    were to decide upon the proper  application  of  Holy Quran and Sunnah to
    virtually all aspects of life of the community. Each of the four schools
    takes its name from early jurist  to  whom later followers trace many of
    the school's distinctive opinions. The four schools are: 

			1. Hanifi's    (after Abu Hanifa,         d.767)
			2. Maliki's    (after Malik ibn Anas,     d.795)
			3. Shafi'is    (after Muhammad al-Shafi'i d.819)
		      & 4. Hanbali's   (after Ahmad ibn Hanbal    d.855)


    Acceptable differences of  interpretation  exist among the four schools,
    and a Sunni may seek to conform  his  or her pratice of Islam to any one
    of them. Matters  pertaining  to  marriage,  divorce,  inheritance,  and
    proper government come under the jurisdiction of Islamic Law. 

    The learned scholars of law are called "Ulema."They are highly respected
    for their learning in  the  religious  sciences.  Islam has no clergy or
    priesthood as such. The basic principles  of Islamic Law are established
    by the following: 

			i)	The Holy Quran
			ii)	The Prophet's Sunnah
			iii)	The learned consensus of Ulema
			iv)	Reasoning by analogy from accepted 
			        interpretations of i) & ii) to new 
				problems not directly addressed therein.

    All of the four above form a concept  of revelation of God's will to the
    community of Islam. This  concept  is  called,  Shari'a, it is more than
    scripture, it implies  a  composite  source  of  teaching  and  practice
    involving the  Holy  Quran,  the  Sunnah  of  the  Prophet  Muhammad  and
    authoritative human interpretation and application. 

    SHI'IA: A significant minority of  Muslims,  10-15  %, differ on certain
    religious and political  matters  almost  since  the beginning of Islam.
    They are known as Shi'ia 's. The historical and religious differences do
    not obscure the broad lines of agreement between Shi'ias and Sunnis. 

    Shi'ias differ  little  from  Sunnis   in  belief  and  practice.  Their
    differences lie mainly in the  modes  of  leadership and piety. Although
    Islam united the Arabs of North and  South under the same banner but the
    cultural and traditional differences remained strong and surfaced at the
    time of choosing the successors of Prophet Muhammad after His death. The
    majority believed in choosing  from  the  closest  companions of Prophet
    Muhammad while others sought guidance  in political and religous matters
    from Hazart Ali, Prophet  Muhammad's  cousin  and son-in-law. Hazart Ali
    was chosen as the fourth Caliph  (leader  of  Islamic community) but was
    assassinated in 661. The civil  strife  that resulted left and indelible
    mark upon Islamic Umma (community). 

    Shi'ias believe Prophet  Muhammad  passed  on  a significant part of his
    teachings directly to  Hazart  Ali,  and  hence  to  subsequent  Imams (
    sprititual leaders). Although the twelfth and last Imam disappeared late
    in the ninth century, expected to  return  before the Judgement Day. The
    Shia Ulema carry on the  distinctive  teachings and interpretations they
    trace back through the Imams to  Prophet  Muhammad. The teachings of the
    sixth Imam, Jafar al-Sadiq (d.765)  became  the  basis of Jafari schools
    among Sunnis. 

    The emotional intensity that characterizes  Shi'ia beliefs culminates on
    the tenth day of Muharram (the first month of Islamic calendar). On this
    date in Karbala, Iraj, in  680,  Hazart  Husayn,  son  of Hazart Ali and
    grandson of  Prophet  Muhammad,  was  brutally  murdered  by  troops  of
    Ummayyad Caliph,Yazid. For nine days,  Yazid's troops besieged the camps
    and deprived Hazart Husayn and his followers  (72 of them) of any water.
    Remembering the tragedy  of  Hazart  Husayn  on  every  year  on 10th of
    Muharram is done by Sunnis as well as Shi'ias. 





    FIVE PILLARS OF ISLAM 

    The pillars of Islam are considered  obligatory for all Muslims although
    Sunni and Shia schools of law have slight variations. 

    The pillars of Islam  play  important  roles  in intellectual and social
    dimensions of Islamic life. The five pillars of faith and practice are: 

		1. The Shahada (Witness)
		2. The Salat   (Prayer)
		3. The Zakat   (Alms)
		4. The Sawm or Siyam (Fasting)
		5. The Hajj    (Pilgrimage)


    SHAHADA: (Witness) The  Shahada  is:  

    In Arabic "La ilah ha il Allah, Muhammadan Rasul-Allah"
    Translation: "(There is) No diety but Allah (and) Muhammad is His Messenger"
				or 
    	         "There  is  no  God but Allah" and "Muhammad is His Apostle" 

    Islam is one of the three monotheistic  religions to arise in the Middle
    East; along with the other two -  Judaism  and Christianity- it stresses
    the oneness and uniqueness of God. The world 'Allah' means 'The God.' 

    The second phrase  of  the  Shahada  declares  that  Muhammad  is  God's
    messenger  to  humankind.  Accepting  the   Judaeo-Christian   Biblical
    tradition in large part, Muslims believe  that God had sent prophets and
    messengers to other nations in the  past  with the same revealed message
    Muhammad was to recite to  the  Arabs.  Muhammad's  mission  brought the
    final positing of divine  Truth,  and  thus  Muhammad is regarded as the
    "Seal of the Prophets." 


    SALAT: (Payer)  Performing  daily  prayers  is  an  act of communication
    between humans and God. Five daily  prayers  are  considered  a duty for
    all Muslims,and on  these  occasions  preparations  in ritual purity are
    required. The prayers are Fajr (early morning before the sun rise), Zuhr
    (afternoon), Asr  (later  afternoon),  Maghrib  (after  sunset) and Isha
    (evening). The prayers must  be  said  while  facing in the direction of
    Mecca. The congregational prayer  of  Friday afternoon is compulsory and
    must be said in a Mosque, Muslim's  place  of worship. There is a sermom
    and then the prayers in uniform rows. 

    ZAKAT: (Alms) The Zakat is  a  form  of  giving  to  those  who are less
    fortunate. It is obligatory upon all Muslims to give 2.5 % of wealth and
    assets each year (in excess of  what  is  required) to the poor. This is
    done before the beginning of  the  month  of  Muharram, the first of new
    year. Giving the Zakat is  considered  an act of worship because it is a
    form of offering thanks to God for the  means of material well-being one
    has acquired. 

    SAWM or SIYAM:  (FASTING)  Another  form  of  offering  thanks to God is
    fasting. It is duty to all  Muslims  to  fast  during the ninth month of
    Islamic calendar, Ramadan. During this month, Muslims refrain from food,
    drink during daylight. Excepts are  those  ill  health, pregnant women &
    travelers. One is to make up lost  days  of fasting at a later time. The
    time of fasting is from just  before  sunrise  to just after sunset. The
    breaking of fast is joyous occasion.  Sawm during Ramadan or any time is
    recognized as physically demanding but spiritually rewarding. 

    HAJJ: (Pilgrimage) The pilgrimage  season begins in the tenth month, the
    month following Ramadan, and lasts  through the middle of twelveth month,
    Dhu al-Hijja. This fifth pillar requires  all Muslims who are physically
    and financially capable to make  Hajj  to Mecca once during their lives.
    The actual rites and prayers take place  at the scred Ka'ba in Mecca and
    at nearby locations. Muslims  associate  the  origin of the Hajj and the
    founding of the Ka'ba  with  the  prophet  Abraham.  Nearly  two million
    Muslims perform Hajj each year. 



    JIHAD: (Striving) Although it is not  a pillar of Islam but is a duty in
    one form or another. The most  common  media misconception is of calling
    Jihad a 'Holy War.' The  general  meaning  of  the term is "striving for
    moral and  religious  perfection."  The  broader  meaning  of  this term
    encompasses one's life and community.  The constant struggle of striving
    to remain on the path of Islam by  observing  the  above five pillars of
    Islam is Jihad. One who strives is Mujahid.

    Being a Mujahid, a striver for moral and religious perfection,  involves
    numerous forms of public  and  private  devotion  that  charaterizes the
    'practice' of islam. This includes  respecting  the  dietry laws against
    eating pork and drinking alcohol, respecting parents and elders, helping
    to provide for  close  relatives  and  kins,  giving  to  the  poor  and
    disadvantaged. On the other side, theft,  murder, fornication, adultery,
    lying, cheating, wrongly accusing  or  testifying are strictly forbidden
    by Shari'a (Islamic Law). 

    In technical sense, Islam means 'the pratice of the religious and social
    duties' outlined above. 

    IMAN: (Faith) The faith, like Five Pillars, can be divided in six parts.
    It means belief in the following: 

	1. God and His Attributes
	2. Prophets
	3. Angles
	4. Sacred Books
	5. The Judgement Day        
	6. Predestination

Subject: 9) Administrative Setup of Soc.Religion.Islam


Date: 15 Nov 91 02:45:12 GMT
(Greg Woods)

As you may or may not know, this group is multiply moderated. This means
that all postings are mailed to a program here which randomly selects
a moderator from a fixed list and forwards the posting on. I do not
read this group and have no connection with it other than maintaining
the multiple moderator software and making temporary adjustments to the
list of moderators (for example, when a moderator goes on vacation s/he
asks me to remove him/her from the moderator list while gone).

Subject: 10) Procedure for Selection of New Moderators


  The current moderators post an announcement for new moderators on S.R.I.
All interested applicants are sent a copy of guidelines and a list of questions.
References from others are appreciated. Each new moderator has unanimous vote
of current moderators. The new moderators must:

1. Have some understanding of Islam (not necessarily a Muslim). 
2. Agree with guidelines of Soc.Religion.Islam.
3. Be able to recognize flames/insults.
4. Have experience with USENET, preferrably a reader of SRI and have taken
   some participation in discussions.
5. Be willing to volunteer at least 2-4 hrs of time for S.R.I. per week.
6. Secure unanimous vote from all current moderators.
   
	As an additional step, the incoming moderators will be requested to
	sign an affidavit, declaring their intent to abide by the guidelines
	of Soc.Religion.Islam, Guidelines & Rules for the SRI moderators & 
	acceptance to a unanimous no-confidence motion.

Subject: 12) Policies on Direct Submissions, resubmissions & format.


 	Please be reminded, in order to make this group efficient and 
     to fairly distribute the load on the moderators your cooperation
     is needed.  We would like to request the following.

     1. Please do NOT send direct submissions to the moderators' accounts.
         [Routing software distributes more or less equal number of articles
         to each of the moderator.Sending direct upsets this balance unfairly]

     2. Please do not re-submit articles again and again. Just ONCE is 
        sufficient. [This leads to duplication and waste of time & energy]

     3. Please keep your column length less than 80.

     4. Please 'Spell-check' your articles.
     	[Moderators are for reviewing the contents of the submission, NOT to
         format it or spell check it]

     5. Please Keep them within the guidelines 1) Relevance to Islam 
     					2) Academic/prof. language
     


************************************************************************
************************************************************************

Subject: 13) Acknowledgment Process


 	It has always been our best effort to make this newsgroup run
 	smoothly & efficiently. In spite of it, there have been cases 
 	where readers feel their articles were lost or never posted. 
 
 	Effective *immediately* we have decided to send acknowledgment 
 	to each & every message we receive in our mailboxes.  

 	We ask for your cooperation in implementing the logistics. 
 
 	Once your message is received by the moderator of SRI, you will be
 	sent a copy of your message back with the statement.

 	"Your posting for Soc.Religion.Islam appended below has been 
 	 received in the mailbox of moderator ____ ______"
 
 	o This will let you know 1. Your posting has been received.
 				 2. Which moderator is reviewing it.
 	o If you don't get an acknowledgment back within 48 hrs. Please
 	  send it again with a header "Second Attempt." Acknowledgment of
	  "Second Attempt" will be circulated to co-moderators as well.
	o In an unfortunate case of "Third Attempt." It should be sent
	  directly to the email address of Coordinator SRI*
 	o Your article will be posted on Soc.Religion.Islam from anywhere 
 	  between 1 hrs to 48 hrs. 
 	o If you don't see your posting on Soc.Religion.Islam within 72 hrs
    	  of receiving a return receipt - send a copy of your article with 
 	  time stamped headers to the Coordinator SRI*

          *At present, the Coordinator SRI is Asim Mughal.  He can be reached 
	  at mughal@alumni.caltech.edu. 

 WE REQUEST YOU TO COOPERATE BY:
 
 	o Not posting to Soc.Religion.Islam's email address unless you have
 	  absolutely no way of posting thru USENET. 
 	o Not posting your same article again & again. Just ONCE is enough.
 	o Not inquiring every day about your articles or your friends'.
 
 	Lets try to make this new system a success. 
 
 
  	P.S. The present guidelines do not require the moderators of SRI
 	     to send acknowledgments or handle the cases of lost articles.

Subject: 14) Grievance Process
 

This is an effort to establish a procedure for handling grievances. The 
purpose is to make sure due attention is paid to concerns, objections & 
criticism from the readers while at the same time it prevents unncessary
hassling of moderator(s). The final decision rests on majority voting 
among the moderators.  

SUMMARY  

o If your article is rejected, you may ask the same moderator for  a review.
o If still unsatisfied, request a peer review.
o The moderator in question must decide whether to hold a peer review.
o Majority voting among moderators decides the outcome. 


************************************************************************
************************************************************************
-------
Subject: 15) Email submissions

 	Please post your articles to USENET group soc.religion.islam.

	The address : religion-islam-request@ncar.ucar.edu is only to
	be used in extreme case. Any email sent to this address goes
	to ALL moderators. This may lead to:

		1. No moderator posting the article (thinking others
                   may be doing so)
	
		2. All moderators posting the article.

	The usual case is (2) which causes duplication and waste of 
	time translating into one less article from other readers
	posted on S.R.I. Hence, we discourge sending articles to this
	address. 


************************************************************************
************************************************************************
-------
Subject: 16) Proper USENET format for submissions.


C O L U M N    W I D T H: 

	The submissions  must be trimmed to 79 characters in width. 
	Without it, the posting software does NOT post the article.
	

<------------- This makes 79 characters in width ----------------------------->
1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789


        Additional time it takes to format postings translates into unfair 
	advantage against other readers, whose article face delays.  



Q U O T E D   T E X T: 

	The current NetNews software will not post an article if the  quoted 
	text is more than the response. Please trim the quoted text from your 
	submissions for Soc.Religion.Islam.

Again, please submit your articles in proper USENET format. Thanks.  

************************************************************************
************************************************************************
-------
Subject: 17) Test Messages 

	o "Test Message" will be acknowledged but not posted. 

		This will ensure the sender knows his/her article
		made it to the moderators. It is assumed their 
		article or submission will follow.

	o Repeated Test Messages: Will be acknowledged only once.

		- Please don't abuse the system -

************************************************************************
************************************************************************

Subject: 18) Anonymous Submissions 

	o  Submission from anonymous servers  and personal requests from 
	   readers to remain anonymous are acceptable.
