  Michael L. Kaufman <kaufman@eecs.nwu.edu>:
  
  > Ah, but that is not what Mr. Depew was advocating.  Mr Depew wants

_____
<6.2> Was R. Depew's first ARMM `automated censorship'?


  <Ray.Lampman@FullFeed.Com>:
 
  > RICHARD DEPEW imposes automated CENSORSHIP on the Net.
  >  
  > For the past few weeks, there has  been  an  on-going  debate  in

  > automatically cancels or deletes postings which it "judges" to be
  > in-appropriate or un-acceptable.

  Catherine Anne Foulston <cathyf@is.rice.edu>:

  > It is NOT censorship, any more than a private individual sneaking
  > into the library and cutting objectionable (to him) articles out
  > of all the magazines is censorship.  It's a form of vandalism,

  David Condon <dxc4@po.CWRU.Edu>:
  
  > The person who proposed forging cancels, and who actually did

  > M. Depew seems to believe this to be his responsibility,

  John Stanley <stanley@skyking.OCE.ORST.EDU>:

<6.3> Was anon8785's posting of Depew's address cowardly/justifiable?

<6.4> How should the first Depew ARMM incident be remembered?

  Mark Brader <msb@sq.sq.com>:
