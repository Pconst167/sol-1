While no article that attempts to document an entire emerging
subculture can be complete, I will do my best to give you enough
complete and accurate information to get you on your way to the future.   

This article will focus mainly on cyberpunk culture, rave culture,
industrial, po-mo, virtual reality, drugs, computer underground,
etc. Basically, the elements that make up the developing
techno-underground, the new edge, the technoculture.

Included in this article will be: suggested readings -- books,
magazines, zines, requisite authors, etc., BBSes devoted to relevant
topics, corporations and merchandise geared toward the techno-aware,
Internet e-mail addresses for relevant figure-heads in this area,
suggested music and movies/videos, FTP sites, etc. 

I will do my best to update this article every so often, as the
techno-underground is not stagnant and is always shifting and changing
and moving forward.  If you have any complaints/comments/suggestions/
errors or just want to send someone mail, write to me on the Internet
at ahawks@nyx.cs.du.edu.  I also welcome addition requests and such -
feel free to say "hey man, add blah-blah to the list!"

pieces of what was actually coming true, and fed it back to the
readers who were already living in Gibson's Sprawl, whether they knew

Agrippa: A Book of the Dead - A collaboration between author [William 
        Gibson], publisher Kevin Begos Jr, and artist Dennis Ashbaugh.  
        This art-work contains engravings by Ashbaugh which appear or 
        disappear in light and an on-disk semi-autobiographical poem
        by [William Gibson] which is unreadable after having been read
        once.  Agrippa is notable because in many respects it blurs
        the lines about what art is, and adds fuel to the fire on
        issues of property rights and intellectual property.  A 
        highlight of 1992 was the release of Gibson's poem on to the
        [net]. 

Artificial Life - man-made systems that exhibit characteristics
        associated with the concept of "life".

Artificial Reality - similar to [virtual reality], but more
        interactive, with the participant being part of, not just
        experiencing, the artificial environment.

BBSes - electronic Bulletin Board Systems.  Begun in the late 70's, a
        form of [virtual community] existing in [cyberspace] where
        participants (usually using aliases) may send and receive
        public and private messages to each other on any topic
        imaginable, transfer software (copyrighted and/or public
        domain), play on-line games, etc.  There is the "over-ground"
        BBS world where aliases are less common and illegal activities
        are avoided in discussion, and the [{computer} underground]
        where illegal activities and discussions are very common,
        members use aliases, and illegal information and/or software
        is exchanged.
 
Boxing - A variety of electronic devices used to aid in [phreaking].
        The original was the blue box, used from the mid 60's to the
        mid 80's, which allowed long distance phone calls to be made
        for free.  A variety of other similar instruments
        accomplishing different tasks have been developed, some
        purely comical, some quite practical.
 
CC fraud - Credit Card or Calling Card fraud.  common in the
        [computer underground] community.
 
Chaos - Chaos is a state which garners a lot of respect in
        [cyberculture], to the point of being a [techno-pagan]
	religion.  Many people are self-described Chaoticians.

Chaos Theory - science revolving around simplistic equations
        involving a large number of variables.  Gave rise to
        [fractals], a form of [cyberdelic] art.  For further info on
        the subject, James Gleick's "Chaos: Making a New Science" is
        suggested.
 
C0dez Doodz - Essentialy a [phreaker]'s version of [pirates].  People
        who seek out telco codes to be used to gain long distance (ld) 
        telephone calls without paying for them.  Scurge of the
        [computer underground]. 

Communitek - an informational technology that allows for a community
       to potentially develop in cyberspace.  For example, within the
       [net], [IRC] and e-mail are two communiteks.  

Computer Underground - "A group organized in secrecy, hidden behind
        aliases, to promote the free exchange of information
        regarding anything and everything including, but not limited
        to: computers, telephones, radios, chemicals, and ideas."
        (thanx to The Butler for this definition)
        The mainstay of communication for the computer underground is
        [cyberspace], more specifically [BBSes].  The computer
        underground is comprised of [hackers], [phreakers],
        [piraters], anarchists, and other [cyberpunks].
 
CP - see [cyberpunk].
 
Cryonics - The fringe science of freezing a person's head or whole
        body after death, in the hopes that in the future they may be
        revived and brought back to life.
 
Cyber- - A prefix taken from [cybernetics] generally used in popular
        culture to mean anything that is technologically oriented.
 
Cyberculture - Often used by media to denote aspects of "life as a
        [cyberpunk]".   Yet if we are to follow strict meaning,
	cyberculture is more accurately defined as an
	information-based culture.  

Cyberdeck - Term originated by [William Gibson] to refer to a
        computer used by [deck cowboys] that can connect to the
        [matrix].
 
Cyberdelic - "Cyber-art".  Examples include [fractals],
        computer-generated pictures and/or music, [virtual worlds],
        etc.
 
Cybernetics - The study of communication systems in living organisms
        and machines, the mathematical analysis of the flow of
        information.
 
Cyberpunk - Begun as a literary movement in the 80's, an off-shoot of
        normal science fiction.  Unique in that it generally occurs
        in the present or not so distant future, the characters are
        often considered "punks" (social deviants) and technology,
        (the cyber aspect), is prominent.  "Neuromancer" by [William
        Gibson], published in 1984, is considered by most to be the
        "bible" of cyberpunk.  Another prominent author is [Bruce
        Sterling], editor of another worthy cyberpunk collection,
        "Mirrorshades".  Other examples  of cyberpunk include Max
        Headroom (tv show) and Blade Runner (movie).  Cyberpunk is 
        special in that it has evolved from a purely literary movement
        to a realistic subculture.  Many "techno-punks" (ie:
        [hackers]) are considered cyberpunks.  Other contributing
        factors to the cyberpunk subculture include:  virtual reality,
        hallucinogenic and [nootropic] drugs, and industrial and punk
        music.  For an in-depth, detailed look at cyberpunk fiction
        and cyberpunk culture, "Storming the Reality Studio", ed. by
        Larry McCaffery is suggested.
 
Cyberspace - "The electronic frontier." A completely virtual
        environment: the sum total of all [BBSes], computer networks,
        and other [virtual communities].  Unique in that it is
        constantly being changed, exists only virtually, can be
        practically infinite in "size", communication occurs
        instantaneously world-wide - physical location is completely
        irrelevant most of the time.  Some include video and telephone
        transmissions as part of cyberspace.
 
Deck Cowboys - Futuristic version of a computer [hacker] or a
        modern-day [cyberpunk].
 
Electronic Frontier Foundation - (EFF).  Organization founded by
        Mitch Kapor (of Lotus fame) and John Perry Barlow (writer and
        Grateful Dead songwriter) to establish laws for [cyberspace]
        and apply the constitution to [virtual communities].
 
Flame - disagreement occuring in [cyberspace].  Common on [Usenet].

Fractals - Images created using [chaos theory].  A mish-mash of
        colors presented in a pattern that repeats itself many times
        over.  A popular type of fractal image is one created using
        the "Mandlebrot set".  Fractals are considered [cyberdelic]
        art.
 
Gibson, William - Considered by most to be the "father" of
        [cyberpunk], along with [Bruce Sterling].  His works include
        the infamous "Neuromancer", "Count Zero", "Mona Lisa
        Overdrive" (these 3 works are known as the [sprawl] series),
        "The Difference Engine" with which he was co-author with [Bruce
        Sterling], and "Burning Chrome" a collection of short
        stories.  Hist latest work is a poem in "[Agrippa: A Book of the
        Dead]".  Gibson says he will no longer be writing the "classic"
        [cyberpunk] novels he is famous for.  His next work is entitled
        "Virtual Light" and is futuristic fiction.
 
Global Village - Famous phrase coined by Marshall McLuhan,
        exemplifiede by the [net].

Gnow - To really know something, word should probably not be used
        lightly.  E.g.:  I quickly knew how to use the [net], now I am
	trying to *gnow* the [net].  

Grep - search, or scan.

Grok - Word with roots in [Shaman]ism that is akin to [gnow], and
        implies a thurough and complete holistic understanding.  

Hacker - 60's (1st) generation (orig. MIT):  one who tinkers with
        software, electronics, computer hardware, etc.  80's (2nd)
        [WarGames] generation:  one who enters computer systems
        without permission with either malicious or non-malicious
        intent, to gain, alter, or destroy information (labelled as
        [crackers] by the 60's generation).  90's (3rd) generation:
        often called [cyberpunks], mostly non-malicious [crackers]
        interested in information for the sake of information, and
        not hacking for the sake of the hack - sometimes calling
        themselves "information liberators", they have re-adopted
        more of the original hacker ethic of the 60's which states
        mainly "all information should be free", "access to computers
        should be unlimited and total" and "promote decentralization".
        This new, 3rd generation is commonly associated with the
        computer underground, despite its mostly non-malicious intent. 
 
Industrial - A subculture revolving around industrial music, a
        collection of mostly electronically created sounds and
        samples that results in a fierce explosion of sound labelled
        by many as "the new punk".  This subculture is generally
        anti-political, anti-aesthetic in nature.
 
Infonomics - The idea of an econmoy based on information, which
        obviously holds many different properties from our current
	state of the world.

Internet - A large and very popular world-wide computer network
        begun by the Defense Department in the 60's that connects
        educational institutions, corporations, organizations, and
        military and government installations around the globe. 
        Some organizations exist that offer access to the Internet to
        the general public for an hourly/monthly/yearly fee.  See the
        "BBSes" section of this article for more info, particularly
        those BBSes listed with "public access unix" next to them.  
        Suggested are places like the [WELL], [MindVox], Nyx (which is 
        free of cost), NetCom, etc.  Many Internet users partake in
        reading and contributing to [Usenet], playing [MUD]s, FTPing
        text files and programs free of charge at the various FTP 
        sites, and 'telnet'ing to other Internet sites.  Because of
        its accessibility at a relatively low cost, size (the largest
        computer network in the world), connectivity, and infinite
        amounts of information, many network users prefer the Internet
        to such services as CompuServe (often called Compu$erve on 
        the Internet) or Prodigy (which is more restricting in its
        content).  The Internet has something to offer for everyone.  
        Other portions of this file such as the suggested newsgroups
        list, list of FTP sites, and list of 'telnet'able services and
        sites, should be very helpful to the new Internet user.  Once
        you gain access to the Internet, it is suggested that you read
        the 'news.announce.newusers' and 'news.newusers.questions'
        and 'news.answers' newsgroups on [Usenet].  You might also want 
        to read the file 'NixPub: Listing of Public Access Unix sites' 
        to find an Internet dial-up (BBS/Service) in your area.

IRC - [Internet] Relay Chat.  Realtime communication forums between
        [Internet] users all over the world.

ISDN - Integrated Services Digital Network.  A [communitek] hopefully
        coming soon to a house near you, basically it will greatly
	expand the potential for information comming into your house,
	such as having 700 cable TV channels, interactive realtime
	video-phones, and far off in the future possible even realtime
	networked interactive 3d [virtual reality]. 

Legion of Doom - (LoD).  A legendary group of [hackers] from the
        [computer underground].  When they disbanded, some members
        went on to form a computer security firm (ComSec), Loyd
        Blankenship wrote GURPS Cyberpunk for [Steve Jackson Games]
        and some ended up in jail from [Operation Sundevil].
 
Matrix - Term coined by William Gibson which refers to the consensual
        hallucination of [cyberspace].
 
Meme - An "agent of communicative resonance", or mroe simply, "an info
        virus".  Memetics is the study and theories behind the root
	structures of information itself.  

MindVox - A [virtual community] in [cyberspace], also a [BBS]
        connected to the [Internet].  A nexus of the [computer
        underground] and [cyberpunk] and [virtual reality] begun by
        Phantom Access Technologies, former members of the [Legion of
        Doom].  See also the [WELL]
 
Mirrorshades - A very important collection of [cyberpunk] fiction by 
        various authors, most of whom are labelled as the [mirrorshades
        group].  This book is edited by [Bruce Sterling] and should be
        available in most bookstores.

Mirrorshades Group - Original collection of [cp] authors which
        includes William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Tom Maddox, Lewis
        Shiner, John Shirley, SF Eye magazine editor Steve Brown,
        Rudy Rucker, Pat Cadigan, and others.
 
Mondo 2000 - Very popular [cyberpunk] and [new edge] magazine.
        Subscription information is available elsewhere in this file. 
 
MUD - Multi-User Domain, Multi-User Dungeon, or Multi-User Dimension.
        MUDs are multi-user role-playing-games of sorts that exist on 
        the [Internet] for entertainment purposes.  MUDs are
        essentially text-based [virtual worlds] which players
        (participants) may explore, change, or add on to.  In some
        cases, the MUD is not actually a "game" with scores, player
        attributes, levels, etc., but some MUDs are set up this way.
        MUDs tend to be based around different science fiction genres
        such as fantasy, space, or even [cyberpunk].  Some MUD
        environments have no defining characteristics.

Nanotechnology - the science of "micro-machines".  Small gears or
        other machines seen only by a microscope, that can be used in
        areas such as medicine and health, art, and other
        technologies.
 
Net - A computer network.  Often used to mean the [Internet] when
        referred to as "the net".
 
Netrip - Many similarities exist in some people's minds between
        psychedelic drugs and the [net], and a netrip is the state of 
	litterally getting "high" off the net, accompanied by
	distortions in space and time, a [gnow]ledge of the net
	itself, an intense desire to communicate your subconcious to
	the rest of the [net], etc.  

Netrunner - see [hacker].
 
New Edge - Fringe culture and fringe science, mostly techno-oriented,
        and very popular in Southern California.  [Mondo 2000] is a
        magazine devoted to the new edge.
 
Nootropics - A new science revolving around drugs used to increase
        intelligence, aid in memory, enhance brain activity, etc.
        Touted as a fad by some, others claim that use of nootropics
        actually work.  See also [SmartDrinks]. 
 
Operation Sundevil - Secret Service operation begun in 1990 intended 
        to destroy the [computer underground] by confiscating [BBSes] 
        and detaining [hackers].
 
Phrack - An important magazine existing only in [cyberspace], of
        interest to the [computer underground].  It's founder, Craig
        Neidorf, now works for the [Electronic Frontier Foundation].
 
Phreaker - [Hacking] the phone system.  Usually meaning to get phone
        calls for free, whether by [boxing] or [cc fraud].  Individual
        phreakers are called phreaks.
 
Pirate - One who copies software illegally.  Commonly associated with 
        the [computer underground].  Although commonplace, pirates
        are looked down upon as with [codez d00dz].

Post-industrial - The state of the world, including megacorp
        [zaibatsu]s, an evolving [infonomics], etc.

Post-modern - Literary, artistic, cultural, and philosophical
        movement revolving around the [post-industrial] world in which
        we live, and the unique aspects of the trends of modern
        society.
 
Raves - A subculture revolving around all-night dance parties.
        Typically, the parties are generally illegal and thus a
        complex process is involved to find out where they are
        located.  Rave music is generally [techno], the parties
        usually include 1 or more DJs.  Also present in many cases are
        "chill out rooms" which feature more ambient music.  Lasers,
        blaring music, [cyberdelic] images, [SmartDrinks] and drugs
        (most often MDMA {X, XTC, Ecstacy, E}, LSD {acid}, ketamine,
        or nootropics) are all general contributors to the rave
        experience.  Raves are usually held in warehouses, and last
        until the next morning.  Another large part of rave culture is
        the flyers - used to find out where your next  party will be.
        Raves are meant to be very happy events, everyone ideally
        should be open and free, laying aggressions and inhibitions
        aside for the night.  Some have likened the rave experience
        to "a weekly roving [techno-]woodstock for the 90's."  Rave
        fashion includes over-sized baggy t-shirts and pants, hooded
        sweat-shirts, ski caps, and usually bright colors, as well as 
        accessories such as whistles, Cat In The Hat hats, "doctor"
        masks, VapoRub, etc.
 
Shaman - An overused word that in ancient and modern cultures implies
        one who is a wise medicine man or healer, with a keen
	understanding of the ways of things.  Used increasingly in
	modern culture, especialy in conjunction with
	[techno-paganism].  

Slipstream - Term used to denote cyberpunk fiction, particularly
        pre-1984 fictional works that have been influential to the
        [mirrorshades group] or that closely resemble cyberpunk, but
        are sometimes outside of the sf genre.  An example would be
        William S. Burroughs. 
 
SmartDrugs - [nootropics].
 
SmartDrinks - Similar to SmartDrugs, or [nootropics], the intent of
        these substances, loaded with vitamins, minerals, amino
        acids, and other healthy substances, is to aid in brain
        functioning.  Smart Drinks are most often consumed at
        [raves], thus, the purpose of some smart drinks is to
        "energize" the drinker, not to make them smarter.
 
Sprawl - Word used by [William Gibson] to mean large mega-cities, and

        "Islands in the Net", "Schismatrix", "Involution
        Ocean", "The Artificial Kid", "The Difference Engine" which
        he co-authored with [Gibson] and "The Hacker Crackdown" a
        non-fiction account of the [computer underground] and
        [Operation Sundevil], including the [Electronic Frontier
        Foundation], [Phrack], the [Legion of Doom], [Steve Jackson
        Games], etc.

Usenet - A collection of "newsgroups" on the [Internet], in which  
        [Internet] users may post or read messages on almost any

        average.  Usenet is divided into various large sections,
        including the 'alt'ernative newsgroups, the 'comp'uter
        newsgroups, the 'sci'ence newsgroups and the 'talk'

        The goal of virtual reality is to generate a completely
        alternate reality.  Research in vr includes networking

        -eat on empty stomach after removing coating
        -nausea likely
        -similar to LSD with less visual effects, 6-8 hrs.

LSD
        -lysergic acid diethylamide-25, acid, cid, sid, lucy in the
         sky, sugarcubes, blotter, tabs, microdots, windowpaine, etc. 
        -causes hallucinations, altering/distortion of vision,
         auditory, time, enhancement of sensations, motor
         difficulties, loss of concentration or consistent thought,
         pupil dilation (or opposite)  
        -not physically addictive, can be psychologically, though
        -trip usually averages around 8-12 hours
        -post-usage effects may include insomnia, jitters,
         temporary/permanent psychosis, flashbacks, permanent trails, nausea
        -usage: taken orally or licked, usually on blotter paper, sugarcubes,
         jello, dropper, also eyeballs
        -strychnine rumors/myths persist 
        -dosage is usually unknown
        -150-200 mics usually induces heavy trip
        -those with heart/physical problems, low tolerance should avoid
        -set (your idea of what the drug will do / mood) and setting
         (where you are and who you're with) have a _lot_ to do with
         the outcome of what LSD  does.  First time trippers should
         trip only with people they trust that  have tripped before,
         and in a place where unexpected "bad" things will not  happen
         (police come in, parents, etc).  Tim Leary has lots of info
         on  what could be done.  Reading his books can only help. 

Marijuana
        -cannabis, pot, weed, mj, mary jane, etc. etc.
        -consumption:  joints, bongs, pipes, hash brownies, tea, etc.
        -produces some distortions, feeling of happiness

         soaking 
        -most are chemically treated - can induce nausea, vomiting,
         diarrhea  
        -effects: trip-like but less hallucinogenic than lsd, 6 hours, 
         less intense

MDMA
        -ecstacy, X, E, XTC
        -empathenogen
        -like a combo of LSD and Speed (the 'MA' is methamphetamine)
        -effects similar to LSD, little or no visual hallucinations
         auditory/visual/time perception altered, sensations increased,
         extreme emotional awareness, trips average around 6 hours
        -XTC many times cause the user to "love" everything.  Beware
         of taking X with  people you know little about.  (You may end
         up giving your car keys to your worst enemy).  Any touch to
         your skin (in a sexual sense) feels like  heaven, even though
         sex may be impossible.   
        -usage:  pills, caplets, in water
        -street stuff may contain many different varieties of different 
         substances
        -much debate over toxicity and neuro-toxicity
        -set and setting are extremely important, as with LSD
        -long-term use can result in liver damage

Mushrooms (Psilocybin)
        -Baeocystis (potent), caerulipes (blue foot), coprophila
         (dung-loving) cubensis (common large), cyanescens (bluing),

         (stunz's blue legs), amanita muscaria (fly agaric), conocybe
         smithii (bog conocybe), gymopilus spectabilis (big laughing
         gym)     
        -never ingest unless positively identified by a mycologist to be
         non-poisonous
        -effective dose of dried mushrooms: 1 gram (one or two whole
         mushrooms) 
        -best taken on an empty stomach
        -consumption: orally, smoked, tea (water + dried fragments)
        -effects:  trip lasting 6 hours or so, more visual & less

         radically as LSD 
        -physical effects: liquid breathing, headache
        -effects occur quicker, generally, than with LSD

Nutmeg
        -usage: 5-20 grams of freshly ground
        -effects: heavy buzz, promotes lethargy, sleep, nausea, dry mouth,
         pupil dilation

         lasts 2-4 hours, insomnia, nausea possible
        -rumored to cause longer-term erections in men.  cool.

well as Anne Balsamo for providing a very useful, wonderful
bibliography. 

Final Hellos to:  the nameless masses. (yes, you!).  And all those
living on the edge of the future, and to all those working to protect
cyberspace from the fascism that now threatens it.  And everyone else.

Again, if you have any questions/comments/concerns/criticisms/corrections 
or any additional info, please contact me at ahawks@nyx.cs.du.edu.
