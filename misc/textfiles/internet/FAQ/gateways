This list is current as of 04 April 1991, I think (but then,
one never knows: things change so rapidly).

Would someone like to "officially" maintain this list?  
I'll strapped for time in the coming months...

Ajay.

INTRODUCTION

This file documents methods of sending mail from one network to another.
It represents the aggregate knowledge of the readers of comp.mail.misc
and many contributors elsewhere.  If you know of any corrections or
additions to this file, please read the file format documentation below
and then mail to me: John J. Chew <poslfit@gpu.utcs.utoronto.ca>.  If
you do not have access to electronic mail (which makes me wonder about
the nature of your interest in the subject, but there does seem to be
a small such population out there) you can call me during the month of
July at +1 416 979 7166 between 11:00 and 24:00 EDT (UTC-4h) and most
likely talk to my answering machine (:-).

DISTRIBUTION

(news) This list is posted monthly to Usenet newsgroups comp.mail.misc and
  news.newusers.questions.  
(mail) I maintain a growing list of subscribers who receive each monthly 
  issue by electronic mail, and recommend this to anyone planning to 
  redistribute the list on a regular basis.  
(FTP) Internet users can fetch this guide by anonymous FTP as ~ftp/pub/docs/
  internetwork-mail-guide on Ra.MsState.Edu (130.18.80.10 or 130.18.96.37)
  [Courtesy of Frank W. Peters]
(Listserv) Bitnet users can fetch this guide from the Listserv at UNMVM.
  Send mail to LISTSERV@UNMVM with blank subject and body consisting of
  the line "GET NETWORK GUIDE".  [Courtesy of Art St. George]

HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

Each entry in this file describes how to get from one network to another.
To keep this file at a reasonable size, methods that can be generated by
transitivity (A->B and B->C gives A->B->C) are omitted.  Entries are sorted
first by source network and then by destination network.  This is what a
typical entry looks like:

  #F mynet
  #T yournet
  #R youraddress
  #C contact address if any
  #I send to "youraddress@thegateway"

For parsing purposes, entries are separated by at least one blank line,
and each line of an entry begins with a `#' followed by a letter.  Lines
beginning with `# ' are comments and need not be parsed.  Lines which do
not start with a `#' at all should be ignored as they are probably mail
or news headers.

#F (from) and #T (to) lines specify source and destination networks.
If you're sending me information about a new network, please give me
a brief description of the network so that I can add it to the list
below.  The abbreviated network names used in #F and #T lines should
consist only of the characters a-z, 0-9 and `-' unless someone can
make a very convincing case for their favourite pi character.

These are the currently known networks with abbreviated names:

  applelink     AppleLink (Apple Computer, Inc.'s in-house network)
  attmail	AT&T Mail,AT&T's commercial e-mail service.
  bitnet        international academic network
  bix           Byte Information eXchange: Byte magazine's commercial BBS
  bmug          Berkeley Macintosh Users Group
  compuserve    commercial time-sharing service
  connect       Connect Professional Information Network (commercial)
  easynet       Easynet (DEC's in-house mail system)
  envoy	  	Envoy-100 (Canadian commercial mail service)
  fax           Facsimile document transmission
  fidonet       PC-based BBS network
  geonet        GeoNet Mailbox Systems (commercial)
  internet      the Internet
  mci           MCI's commercial electronic mail service
  mfenet        Magnetic Fusion Energy Network
  nasamail      NASA internal electronic mail
  peacenet      non-profit mail service
  sinet         Schlumberger Information NETwork
  span          Space Physics Analysis Network (includes HEPnet)
  sprintmail    Sprint's commercial mail service (formerly Telemail)
  thenet        Texas Higher Education Network

#R (recipient) gives an example of an address on the destination network, 
to make it clear in subsequent lines what text requires subsitution.

#C (contact) gives an address for inquiries concerning the gateway,
expressed as an address reachable from the source (#F) network.
Presumably, if you can't get the gateway to work at all, then knowing
an unreachable address on another network will not be of great help.

#I (instructions) lines, of which there may be several, give verbal
instructions to a user of the source network to let them send mail
to a user on the destination network.  Text that needs to be typed
will appear in double quotes, with C-style escapes if necessary.

NETWORKS KNOWN *NOT* TO HAVE ACCESS FROM INTERNET

Compiled by Raymond Chen <raymond@math.berkeley.edu> . 

Network             Comments (and userids of people who asked about it
                              and didn't post summaries)
-------             ---------------------------------------------------
American Online     Masato Ogawa (ogawa@sm.sony.co.jp) confirms
                    that there is no gateway.

British Telecom     rbatt@adam.adelaide.edu.au (R Batt) reports that
Gold                BT is a member of DialCom (qv).

DialCom             The gateway was shut down in March 1990 for financial
                    reasons.  Individual customers may have established
                    private relays through the Commercial Mail Relay (CMR).
                    Information available on the CMR is available from
                        Intermail-Request@Intermail.ISI.EDU

Dialog              mcmahan@netcom.UUCP (Dave Mc Mahan) reports that
                    nobody responded to his query in October 1990.

Easylink            a Western Union service
                    bruceh@CV.HP.COM (Bruce Hauge) reports that as of March
                    1991 there is no gateway yet, but they're working on it.

Eurokom             christ@issun3.stc.nl (Brian Christiansen) reports that
                    nobody responded to his query in February 1991.

Fidelity Investments ea47916@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Eric Adams) reports that
(Dallas)            nobody responded to his query in February 1991.

GEnie               No gateway yet, but Bill Louden, the General Manager of
                    GEnie, has stated publically that they are currently doing
                    research into the feasibility of a gateway.  Trust me,
                    if such a gateway is set up, you'll hear about it.

                    By the way, the machine genie.com is a red herring.

GoldNet             chaim@eniac.seas.upenn.edu (Chaim Dworkin) reports that
                    GoldNet is part of DialCom (qv).

HandsNet            oze3@quads.uchicago.edu (J. Daniel Ozeran) reports
                    that nobody responded to his query in January 1991.

Midas Internation headquarters in Chicago
                    IO00393@MAINE.BITNET (Pete) reports that nobody
                    responded to his querh in January 1991.

Nifty-Serve         a Japanese BBS
                    suzuki@sai.vtt.fi (Makoto Suzuki) contacted the
                    system operators and confirmed that there is no gateway.

OMNET               Craig E. Ward (cew@isi.edu) explains:

Go either through Sprint Internet relay, Sprint.COM, or through the Commercial
Mail Relay (CMR) at Intermail.ISI.EDU.

Through the CMR, you can send mail to OMNET users with this format:

           "[omnet.user/OMNET]MAIL/USA%TELEMAIL"@Intermail.ISI.EDU

Users on OMNET will need to use an embedded header, i.e. in the body of the
message text (almost as ugly as X.400, but not quite) in a message to
"[INTERMAIL/USCISI]SM66/USA" to get mail back to you:

        Forward: Internet
        To: Gumley_LE@cc.curtin.edu.au
        <Blank-Line>

You can get more information about the Commercial Mail Relay from:
