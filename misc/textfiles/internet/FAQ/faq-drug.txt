Subject:  00-Introduction to alt.drugs and the Monthly List
Last Update: 1-18-91 

     Welcome to alt.drugs.  This is a forum for the discussion generally
of recreational drugs.  To a large extent the traffic on this group deals
with both currently legal and illegal recreational drugs.  Discussions
commonly are concerned with both the psychological and chemical effects of
drugs, along with the social aspects of drug use.  Discussions about
prescription medications would probably be best posted to sci.med. 
Likewise, discussions about legal psychoactive drugs (nootropic drugs,
amino acids, etc) might better be posted in alt.psychoactives. 
talk.politics.drugs is yet another related newsgroup which is for the
discussion of the political and legal ramifications of recreational drug
use.  Generally, however, people on alt.drugs aren't too tense if you post
something which really should belong in another newsgroup.  In particular,
cross-posting between alt.drugs and talk.politics.drugs is fairly common. 
     The discussion about illegal drug use is frequently very
controversial. One item should be immediately cleared up:  It is *NOT* a
commonly espoused theme that irresponsible illegal drug use should be
*ENCOURAGED*, and the purpose of this list is not to encourage
irresponsible illegal (or legal) drug use.  The majority of people who
read alt.drugs, however, do generally condone legal or illegal drug use
provided it is done *RESPONSIBLY* and that means knowledgably. 
     Part of the purpose of this list is to provide accurate information
about drugs.  In particular there are many myths about legal and illegal
drug use, and there is quite a large amount of disinformation also.  For
the most part I have tried to insure that this list contains accurate
information.  If you think something is in error, please e-mail me.  This
list is not, however, meant to be all-encompassing (that would make for an
incredibly large list and I don't have *THAT* much free time).  There are
also FAQ lists on the following topics, all of which are available at
several FTP sites (Directions for uucp users to acquire copies of the FAQs
are included in the FTP list).

FAQ-Bibliography     : Extensive references to books and articles about drugs 
FAQ-Ecstasy          : Information about Ecstasy (aka MDMA, MDM, Adam)
FAQ-Everclear        : The Everclear list from rec.food.drink
FAQ-LSD              : Information about LSD 
FAQ-Misc             : YOU'RE READING IT!  
FAQ-MJ-Consumption   : Information on methods of social marijuana consumption 
FAQ-Natural-High     : Info on legal means of altering your consciousness 

             THE IMPORTANT BIT:  Frequently Asked Questions

     Also, this list was created with another purpose in mind.  alt.drugs
tends to get bogged down in traffic that is continuously repeated.  In
particular threads on the FTP sites, how to beat drug testing, and the
infamous LSD and strychnine thread have been hashed and rehashed :) more
times than many people can remember.  Before posting something to the net,
net.etiquette requires you to read this list first.  If you don't find an
answer in here, and you cannot find an answer in any of the single-topic
FAQs listed above then a posting to alt.drugs is welcomed. 
     The following topics are covered in *THIS* FAQ:

Introduction       : YOU'RE READING IT!
FTP sites, etc     : Information on alt.drugs related net issues like FTP sites
Common FAQs        : Short and blunt answers to most FAQs (Please READ THIS!)
Drug Myths         : Common misconceptions about drugs (READ THIS TOO!)
Drug Testing       : A quick section on how to beat drug tests
Organizations      : A list of Anti-War on Drugs organizations
 
If you are reading this list with rn, then it is laid out in such a way so
that you can easily skip to the next subject by hitting a ^G (<control>-G).
If you're using nn, then you can hit "G%" to break this article up into a

If you don't have access to FTP because you are on a uucp/Fidonet/etc network
there is an e-mail gateway at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com that can retrieve the files
for you.  To get instrutions on how to use the FTP gateway send a blank message
to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with one line containing the work 'help'.

This is a sample message of how to retrieve some files from the alt.drugs
archives at milton:

% mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
Subject:  <ignored>
reply <yourname>@<yoursite>
connect milton.u.washington.edu anonymous
dir /public/alt.drugs
get /public/alt.drugs/000-readme
get /public/alt.drugs/000-index
uuencode    /* note: this command is optional and the default is btoa */
binary
get /public/alt.drugs/marijuana-myths.Z
quit

That would retrieve a directory of the archive, then the two printable
ascii files 000-readme and 000-index.  To recieve the rest of the files
you must set the server to "binary" mode because all the files are
compressed.  Those compressed files are then either sent out uuencoded or
btoa'd.  So, you must obtain copies of the programs 'uudecode' (or 'atob') and
'uncompress' to unpack the files that you will recieve.

Subject:  Common Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and answers
Last Updated: 2-7-91 

1)    HEY D00DZ, WHERE CAN I GET SOME KILLER WEED (or LSD, MDMA, etc)?!?!?
2)    Do banana peels have hallucinogenic substances in them? [etc...]
3)    Does LSD commonly have strychnine in it? [etc...]
4)    How can I make LSD? [inc.  warnings about The Anarchist Cookbook]
5)    What is Ecstasy/MDMA/Adam? [and all kinds of related info on MDMA]
6)    What does the acronym PDFA, DPA, etc mean?

You can skip to a specific FAQ by searching for the regular expression '^x' 
where x is the number of the question you want to read.

1)    HEY D00DZ, WHERE CAN I GET SOME KILLER WEED (or LSD, MDMA, etc)?!?!?

           Grow up, and get a life.  Anyone stupid enough to setup a
      transaction over a public network (that could very easily be monitored
      by the FBI) deserves to get caught.  Likewise, please don't send e-mail
      to the frequent posters (especially me), asking to purchase drugs. 

2)    Do banana peels have hallucinogenic substances in them?  Can you get
      high by smoking banana peels?       

           No.  This is an urban legend which was started by the Berkeley 
      _Barb_ in the late 60's.  Sidney Cohen analyzed bananas and found that
      they contained no hallucinogenic substances.  Also, rumors that you can 
      smoke peanut shells to get high, are most likely a spin-off of the
      banana peel legend.  Instructions in The Anarchist Cookbook on how to
      get high from banana peels are bogus (and if you do get some effect, 
      then congratulations, you're a placebo responder). 

3)    Does LSD commonly have strychnine in it?  It strychnine the cause of
      cramps/nausea on an LSD trip?  Does strychnine cause the "tracers" 
      from an LSD trip?  etc...

           Your chances of getting strychnine contaminated _blotter_ LSD,
      are probably about the same as your chances of getting hit by a piece
      of the wing sheared off of a passing 747.  Strychnine is not the
      cause of tracers, cramps, nausea, or amphetamine-like LSD-effects.
           Strychnine is not needed to bond the LSD to blotter paper.  Pure
      LSD tartrate/maleate gets absorbed on blotter quite efficiently all by
      itself.  Any chemist competent enough to manufacture LSD would know
      that Strychnine is not needed to produce LSD, therefore there is no
      Strychnine "added" in the process of manufacture.
           "Cutting" LSD with Strychnine would be utterly ludicrous due to
      the expense of Strychnine, and the ease of "cutting" LSD with the
      solvent of your choice, before depositing it on the paper.  Its much
      more likely that if someone is going to try and rip someone off, that
      they'll just pass off blank blotter paper -- its *so* much easier than
      trying to lace LSD with strychnine.
           There have been several other theories to explain the existance
      of Strychnine in LSD.  They all, however, fall short in one very
      critical test.  There are no reports that can be found of Strychnine
      poisoning due to the ingestion of laced LSD.  If Strychnine was 
      on LSD, and given Strychnine's high toxicity, and given the number of 
      people who take rather insane (>100 hits) of LSD, there should be
      acid-heads dropping like flies from strychnine poisoning.  This has
      not been reported, therefore the likelyhood of strychnine laced LSD
      being sold on the illegal market is small.
           And, finally, there have been analysis of street drugs samples
      which have never turned up a sample of strychnine laced LSD.  The
      only reports are a few anecdotal ones, and the report in _LSD:
      My Problem Child_.  It should be noted that in _LSD:MPC_ the "LSD"
      was being sold as a "white powder".  The lesson is to only buy 
      blotter LSD -- its very, very hard to fit enough adulterants onto a
      small square of blotter to effect a person.  LSD can only be 
      distributed in this manner because its effective dose is in the 
      50-200 microgram range.
           Its possible that poorly synthesized LSD might have other ergot
      derivatives in it.  This *MAY* be the cause of the various adverse
      effects that people report on LSD.  Its also entirely likely that
      the adverse effects to LSD are simply due to the psychological 
      stress of taking LSD.
           Also, advice would be to avoid methylxanthines (caffiene,
      theophylline in chocolate, etc) prior to dosing.  There may be a
      synergistic effect between them and LSD causing, or contributing, to
      the "strychnine effect".  And prior use of dramamine may alleviate
      the nausea sometimes associated with LSD.

4)    How can I make LSD?  And what about the instructions in The Anarchist
      Cookbook for making LSD?

           LSD is not easy to make.  If you're seriously interested the
      various methods of synthesis can be found in chemistry journals (see
      the Merck Index for a list of references).  Also, the book _Psychedelic
      Chemistry_ (available from Loompanics, Unld. -- see end of FAQ list)
      has some rather good, referenced info on how to synthesize LSD.  
      However, do expect to be in *way* over your head unless you've had
      at least a few years of college chemistry.
           Please don't post asking for "simple" instructions on how to make
      LSD.  There aren't.  And if you *needed* "simple" instructions to make
      LSD, you're probably not a good chemist and shouldn't be attempting
      to synthesize it.  
           Also, the synthesis instructions in The Anarchist Cookbook are
      about 90% bullshit.  The "synthesis" given is at best a recipe for the
      extraction of Lysergic Acid Amides (which is not LSD), and some have
      commented that the instructions are still flawed and dangerous.  Also,
      the reproduction of the patent on how to make LSD has reported to be
      flawed -- please don't trust the A.C and order the patent for yourself.
      The A.C. in general is something which is best to avoid.

5)    What is Ecstasy?  What is MDMA?  What is Adam?  What are the 
      effects?  Is it an aphrodisiac?  Is it a designer drug?  Does it
      cause Parkinson's disease?  And does it dry up your spinal fluid?

           Ecstasy chemically is 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA.
      Its also known as:  MDM, M&M, Adam, XTC, X, M or E.  Its is *NOT* the
      same as MDA, MDE ('Eve'), MMDA or MPTP (Although MDA, MDE and MMDA have
      effects that are similar to MDMA).  It is chemically similar to 
      methamphetamine but has a much different method of action.
           In large doses Ecstasy can cause hallucinations (and a chemical
      relative, MDA, causes hallucinations at lower doses), however it
      is not accurate to call it a hallucinogen.  Since it tends to increase
      empathy and communication with no ego-disrupting effects, it has been
      labeled as either an "entactogen" or "empathogen".  Based on its 
      effects, there was some speculation that its was a chemical involved
      in the process of falling in love.  This is incorrect, but its 
      indicative of what the MDMA high feels like.
           MDMA is not chemically related to LSD, and really cannot be
      compared to LSD.  "Bad Trips" on MDMA are extremely rare, and 
      there is no ego disruption associated with an MDMA trip like there
      is in an LSD trip. 

           From Ralph Metzner, presented in an address at a 1983 conference  
           at the University of California, Santa Barbara on "Psychedelics 
           and Spirituality":
 
             Another group of drugs are the phenethylamines, of which
           MDA [and MDMA] is an example.  Instead of calling these 
           "psychedelic drugs," I'd like to suggest the name "empathogenic."
           Empathogenic means "empathy generating."  Everyone I've mentioned
           this name to thinks it is a good one.  These drugs don't produce
           visions as LSD does.  They don't produce multileveled thinking
           or objectivity toward your mind as LSD and the psychedelics do.
           They generate a profound state of empathy for self and other in
           the most general and profound terms.  A state of empathy where the
           feeling is that the self, the other, and the world is basically 
           good, is all right.  This state can be referred to as the ground
           of being, the core of our being, a still point of our being.
             Then individuals using these substances in therapy can look
           at their own problems from the standpoint of stillness and
           empathy.  They are able to do changework on themselves very
           rapidly, compared to ordinary therapy.

           MDMA also is not technically an aphrodisiac.  It does not directly
      stimulate sexual desire, however its empathogenic effect does tend to
      lead to intimacy.  It has been described as a "hug drug".

           From Buffman-J, Moser-C, "MDMA and Human Sexual Function" Journal
           of Psychoactive Drugs, Oct 1985:

             It appears that MDMA does not increase sexual excitation 
           or sexual desire in a majority of individuals.  For both males
           and females, MDMA enhances the sensual aspects of sex.  This may
           be due to the increased feelings of emotional closeness.
             Almost half of the males and a third of the females indicated
           that they felt more receptive to being sexual while under the
           influence of MDMA, but this effect was not paralleled by an
           increased interest in initiating sexual activity in either the
           men or the women.  While a majority indicated that they would use
           MDMA as a sexual enhancer, most of the subjects who had used MDMA
           during sex reported increased emotional closeness.  It is 
           curious that a drug, which can increase emotional closeness, 
           enhance receptivity to being sexual and would be chosen as a 
           sexual enhancer, does not increase the desire to have sex.
             The subjects who were surveyed found that MDMA makes orgasm
           more difficult to achieve, especially for males.  Erectile
           ability was decreased in almost half the males.  No other
           sexual effects occurred in a majority of subjects.
 
           It is not a "Designer Drug" created during the 80's by underground
      chemists.  It was first synthesized in 1914, and was used 
      recreationally prior to the 1980's.
           MDMA does *NOT* cause Parkinson's disease.  This rumor was caused
      by an error by Shari Roan in the July 2, 1985 issue of the Dallas
      "Sun Sentinel".  She incorrectly attributed this effect to MDMA, when
      in fact it is caused by MPTP, which is a by-product of the incorrect
      synthesis of an synthetic opiate.  MPTP shares nothing in common with
      MDMA other than having an chemical abbreviation which begins with an
      'M' and has four letters in it.  
           Likewise, rumors that MDMA "dries up your spinal fluid" and
      similar rumors with respect to spinal fluid are incorrect.  There have
      been studies which linked MDMA use to lower levels of 5-HIAA in
      cerebrospinal fluid, which is probably where this rumor originated.  
      This is not as dramatic as it may sound and may be a spurious 
      relationship, such that people with lower levels of 5-HIAA in their
      CSF are the ones more likely to use MDMA in the first place.  But, it
      may be an indication of some neurotoxic effect of MDMA.  However, the
      neurotoxic effect of MDMA disappears in laboratory animals at doses
      equivalent to human dose levels.  Also, there are no known behavioral
      correlates to this hypothesized neurotoxicity, and an FDA-approved
      drug (fenfluramine) continues to be used chronicly with no reported
      adverse side effects, even though its causes similar types of 
      neurotoxicity as MDMA.  It should also be noted that alcohol is a
      drug which is also slightly neurotoxic, but that typically isn't
      a strong consideration of users while consuming it.  Users, however, 
      should be cautioned that MDMA may be neurotoxic and you're taking 
      your own risks by injesting it.
           For more information on MDMA see the specific FAQ on Ecstasy
      (available via FTP -- see above).

Subject:  Drug Myths
Last Updated: 12-30-91 

These are all a variety of things which commonly get passed off as "truth" by
anti-drug groups, such as the PDFA, DEA, DARE, etc.  I have included references
for those interested in more information.

MYTH:  Marijuana causes brain damage or Marijuana gets between nerve 
       synapses and "widens them up".  

     This myth is based upon a study done by Robert G. Heath in the middle to
late 1970's.  Heath claimed to have found brain damage in the deep brain
sites of three monkeys exposed to marijuana smoke and i.v. delta-9-THC (the
active ingredient in marijuana).  This study, however, has severe flaws in
it.  Most importantly is that Heath did not find any dead brain cells.  He
found "damage" such as a change in synaptic cleft width, and clumping of the
synaptic vesicles.  These changes are not well regarded as being indications
of brain damage, and the methods used to determine that these changes took
place were highly subject to bias--which Dr. Health did not control for.
In fact the clumping of the synaptic vesicles, which Health claimed as being
"brain damage", is a normal variant in the mammalian brain.  Also, two studies 
published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1977, found
no evidence of brain damage in the brains of heavy smokers using computerized
tomography methods.

Beating Drug Metabolite tests (for informational purposes *only* of course).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     There are several commonly used drug metabolite tests:  EMIT, RIA,
Abuscreen, etc.  All of these tests are reasonably easy to beat, given a
little advance planning.  First of all, the drug which is most easily
tested for is marijuana -- its claimed that drug tests can detect
marijuana use up to two months previous.  By following the following
guidelines, its frequently reported that non-chronic marijuana smoking two
weeks prior to the test still resulted in a negative test result.  Two
weeks, however, is probably the minimum safety allowance. 
     In order to prepare for a drug metabolite test, make sure that you
flush your system adequately.  Every day prior to the test, drink at least
eight glasses of liquid (preferably water).  Do *NOT*, however, do this
to excess -- you can end up with water intoxication, and people have
actually overdosed and died off of water.  On the day of the test, you
likewise need to dilute your urine by drinking water -- drink 4-6 glasses
or so, and piss until your urine turns clear.  When its clear that means
that the concentration of all the solutes in the urine is lower
*including* the drug metabolites. This process can be aided by taking some
caffiene, or the prescription diuretic Lasix (again, don't overdo anything
-- there is nothing to be gained by drinking more water/taking more
diuretics -- 80mg Lasix should be quite sufficient).  The clear dilute
urine can also be masked by taking Vitamin B-2 which will color it and
make it less suspicious (use 50-100mg). 
     Should you fail the initial test you will most likely be required to
have a confirmatory GC/MS test.  For this test, the best precautions are
abstinence and prayer.  You should not smoke between the time you get
tested for the first time and the results come back -- if they're positive
and you have to take a GC/MS test, you will be screwed.  GC/MS tests are
much more sensitive than the preliminary immunoassays. 
     There are several substances, some marketed commercially, which are
reported to interfere with the immunoassays to give a negative test
result. Generally, these are treated with some skepticism (but if you
really feel like trying them...).  In particular, vinegar and
phenylpropanolamine (Dexatrim) do not work.  Zinc Sulfate is reported to
work -- take 250mg the night before, and a few hours before the test -- DO
NOT TAKE ANY MORE OF THIS CHEMICAL.  Also the following two products claim
to be effective screens:

     Naturally Klean -- Houston Enterprises
                        PO Box 27776

                        (602) 968-0773

     As a last resort, piss tests can be doped with chemicals.  Bleach
detergent, blood, Draino crystals are reported to work at least on the
EMIT test (I would not expect them to interfere at all on the GC/MS
tests). Its apparently not necessary to spike it with a large quantity,
and the chemicals will noticably effect the urine and could be detected. 
     For more information see Abbie Hoffman's book "Steal this Urine Test".
