These comments are not mine (mostly) but of some of the readers of
alt.cult-movies.rocky-horror


The Loft Cinema - Tucson, AZ
 Sat, Midnight, $5.00
 Comments: Huge theater, big screen, new film. Audience mostly high
  school and college students. Some cast members have an awful sense of
  timing. Virgins are married before sacrificed. (We have morals... NOT
  :)
 Comments:  By the way, thanks to whomever had that constructive
  criticism of the cast.  It's true, and a lot nicer than it could have
  been.  The Loft has temporarily closed RHPS due to problems with
  teenage drinking outside.  The owner has tentatively agreed to re-open
  the film in August, taking care of the security problems and some
  advertising. Price, however, is tenatively to go up to $5.00.

Art Theatre - Long Beach, CA
 2025 E. 4th Street at Cherry Ave.
 (310) 438-5435
 Sat. show $6.00
 Comments: The cast here is VERY good.	Their props & costumes are some
  of the best anywere.	The show is very fun but if you get sick of it
  their are always cool people in the forier to hang out with.	This is
  a very modifyed version of the old "Sat. Balboa" cast. (only a handful
  of the Balboa people are still left...)   You can throw almost
  everything.  Thay even let you use lighters! A word of advice if you
  go... Don't join cast if you like your sanity... Good show but... Thay
  also have a very nice "uncut", Super Heros print! All in all this is
  truly a cast worth seeing...	  -Zenin (aka Byron)

Nuart - Los Angeles, CA
 Comments: Took over about 8 years ago when the Tiffany closed its
  long-time Los Angeles run.  Cast of Sins of the Flesh has gone through
  many changes over the years, but the big fixture is Dennis Miller (not
  the TV Dennis, the Rocky Dennis) who stands out front of the theatre
  and collects fan club memberships every weekend.  Dennis is an
  original, who used to (and occasionally still does) play Riff.  (He is
  noted in Creatures of the Night, Sal's book).  The BEST virgin
  sacrifices on the West Coast (sorry Berkeley :-)  The ultimate virgin
  sacrifice: two rows of virgins, guys in one aisle and girls in the
  other, with their legs spread while a selected guy and girl virgin had
  to crawl on their backs all the way up the aisle and then come back to
  the front of the theatre on their stomachs, between the legs of the
  other virgins (opposite sexes, of course :-)	Nuart played
  Rock-bye-Bear (by Fred Quimby) for a long long time until it broke.
  Several other cartoons have been aired over the years, plus the
  ultimate rock-video, The Wall, as trailers (why do they call them
  trailers when they come at the BEGINNING of the show? :-)

Rialto - So. Pasadena, CA
 Sat, Midnight, runs about 8 months per year
 Comments: This place is in the National Registry of Historical
  Landmarks.  It is one of the few remaining original vaudville
  theatres, complete with orchestra pit, bizarre pseudo-Egyptian decore,
  and gaudy paint.  The balcony is usually closed.  You might recognize
  it, because it has been used in _many_ motion pictures.  I recall at
  least Kentucky Fried Movie being filmed there.  It has been several
  years since I saw Rocky Horror there, but they still line up every
  Saturday.
 Comments: "The Player" is the best known most recent film which takes
  place at the Rialto.
  
UC Berkeley - Berkeley, CA
 Sat, Midnight, $6.00
 Cast Name: Indecent Exposure
 Comments: It's about 5 blocks below UCB.  The cast is excellent and it
  is considered the best cast in the country (so say the fan club in
  NY).	We have official virgin hunters outside the theater before the
  show.  The virgins are marked with "V" or "Fuck Me" in lipstick on
  their faces so that they can be easily identified by those with rice
  and other projectiles.  We also have Super Heroes in the uncut version
  of the film. We also show shorts or music videos before the main
  feature.  Sometimes the cast isn't there, but we have a good time
  anyway.  About four times a year we have lengerie night complete with
  a competition for the best outfit.  Other goofy things are known to
  happen, like last night when the entire cast was dressed as Star Trek
  characters who had been forced to play out the roles of RH. Our next
  lengerie night is tentatively scheduled for early July.
 Comments: Berkeley has been running the longest of them all..
 Comments: Call Becky Milanio at (510) 236-5491 for more info.
  (The Indecent Exposure Entertainment line)

Camera One - San Jose, CA
 Sat, Midnight
 Phone: 408-294-3800
 Comments: Camera One's cast is Velvet Darkness, and no matter what the
  Berkeley cast says, Sal Piro designated VD the "best cast in the
  country" for 1993.  VD started playing at Fremont's UA which is now a
  foreign language theatre (no, they don't show a subtitled version of
  RHPS :-) many years ago and switched to the Camera One in early 1993.
  They recently celebrated their first anniversary at Camera One.  There
  is a weekly virgin sacrifice in which one virgin is forced to strip
  and don a wedding dress and then is placed in the opening wedding
  photograph scene with the cast.  Excellent cast, costumes and props
  (full lighting equipment, a castle, a casket, red and blue sheets, a
  candelabra, etc., etc.)  Audience props are only minimally supervised.
  Best line heard first at Camera One: "..called the human race (that's
  why your phone bill is so high!)"

Montclair GCC - Montclair, CA
 Monta Vista exit off the 10 fwy.
 Turn north, 1 blk, turn right in to the mall.
   - Their are 2 theatres in the mall...
     you want the one next to 31 flavors.
 Fri./Sat. Show  $5.00 or $3.50 if you have a "Fan Club" card!
 Comments: Friday night: This is a fun theatre! The cast is Ok.  But the
  aud. is great. (VERY friendly :) It's the way Rocky used to be...:)
  Just a bunch of friends, having a good time.	...I like it. -Zenin
  (aka Byron)

Canyon Theatre - San Dimas, CA
 Fri. show  $3.00? ...it keeps changing.
 Comments: Not bad for a new cast.  Good cast, good tech, nice people.
  All in all a rather good show. :) ...but I still want to know what
  that cat piss smell was in some of the side seats? ...just keep to the
  center section and you'll be fine. :) -Zenin (aka Byron)

Mayfair Theatre - Ottawa, CAN
 Show RHPS two or three times a month

Uptown - Toronto, CAN
 Price: $7-8 (Canadian)
 Comments: I think the cast was just starting out, the props and
  performances were both rather limited. Shows seem to be every other
  saturday night, price I racall as being about 7-8$, audience seemed to
  be mostly high school & university students.Nearly everyonr went as
  conventionists. Rocky looked a bit ?very waifish & wore a cassock
  instead if bandages, later a gold speedo. Narrator was rather
  annoying, led the audience in monty python singalongs instead of doing
  lines. No virgin sacrifice but their names were entered in a book.
  Audience was requested to throw props onto stage rather than at screen
  or cast, lighters and water were allowed (but my squirtgun
  leaked).Superheroes was included. They showed a Woody Woodpecker
  cartoon (R.I.P. Walter Lance) beforehand where at one point he dresses
  up as a mermaid , and someone yelled "Do't fuck ck with the Hair".
  2Policemen were in attendance but quite friendly & posed with us for
  photos. It's a couple of blocks from the Victoria College campus you
  can look it up if you're in T.O.  P.S. I'm not sure if the Bloor is
  still showing RHPS.

Flatiron - Boulder, CO
 Every other week (?)
 Phone:  303-442-1944.
 Comments: The theater is at the corner of 13th Street and College, just
  one block from the CU-Boulder campus.  It seems to show only every two
  weeks.  The cast is called Deep Throat Nine, and they are a crazy
  bunch:  they yell backa t the audience and throw things at them,
  including a two-quart pitcher of water in the water-cooler scene in
  Sweet Transvestite. Before the show are cast-lead cheers and songs and
  jokes.  No Super Heroes. A lot less structure than the show at
  Berkeley CA.
 Comments: Rocky does play at the FlatIrons in Boulder, CO, everyother
  weekend, unless the manager decides he doesn't want a bunch of happy
  transvestites in his theater that weekend and says the projector or
  broken.

Esquire - Denver, CO
 6th and Downing street.
 addmission : $6.00
 time	 : 11:45 theatre lets in
	  12:00 virgin stuff and rules
	  12:15 Show starts
 Every saterday night
 Comments: Not the best show in the world, but has been improving
  steadily Only cast and crew is allowed on stage. Our theatre is dry
  and no open flames (flamming ok) allowed. all other props OK. we
  distribute "Official Certificates of Non-Virginity" to those recently
  popped. Audience participation scripts with OUR lines also available
  for the cost of copies. We have also been running a small spotlight
  for 6 months with limited success. Our film has superheros intact,
  high quality print (no glitches). try outs are held regulary for new
  players, If coming into town with some notice, drop me a line, we may
  be able to arrange something. our theatre seats 200, we have 25-75 on
  average. Contact: Leo Lionetti   lionetti@beethoven.cs.colostate.edu

Aggie Theater - Ft. Collins, CO
 Price:  $4.00
 Comments: Rocky Horror has returned to the Aggie Theatre in Fort
  Collins Colorado. The theatre is located at 204 S. College. The show
  is organized by the Rocky Horror Society at Colorado State University.
  The show is $4.00.  The cast The Rocky Whores is well rehearsed and
  features the best frank in the state. Preshow festivities include the
  S&M Man and "Let's fake an orgasm." Due to the addition of new seats
  to the theatre, it is a no fire or water allowed show. All other props
  are allowed, and flashlights are encouraged during "There's a Light."
  The show most recently played the weekend of April Fool's with great
  success. RHPS should return for Halloween and April Fool's from now on.

York Square - New Haven, CT
 Fri & Sat, 11:30, $5.50
 Comments: Brand new print with Super Heroes.

Southport - Ft. Lauderdale, FL
 Saturdays at midnight, $6
 Comments:  Tremendous dinner-theater type place.  Audience actually
  sits at tables, and there are waiters who actually bring food and
  drink (even beer!) during the performance.  Upon entry, you receive a
  bag containing toast and rice.  Audience is rather unruly (due to
  being somewhat drunk), but the cast is usually very good.  (Note I
  said usually.)  The pre-show is interesting... sometimes the actor
  playing Brad will play "Great Balls of Fire" on the actress playing
  Magenta, sometimes Brad will lip synch "The Masochism Tango" with
  Frank.  They used to have a Friday show, but I hear tell that they've
  cancelled it.

Northlake 8 - Atlanta, GA
 Comments: If you are looking for a really professional cast, might I
  suggest the Northlake 8 in Atlanta. The cast really does a good job
  (and, I played Brad/Riff/Magenta there for a year prior to moving to
  Gainesville).   The Northlake 8 is a great theater! For directions,
  just take I-75 to Northlake Drive and head east.   You cannot miss the
  Mall, it is on the right side of Northlake Drive, and the AMC is near
  Toys-R-Us.  Tell them Tom Servo sent ya!   Ask for Kim McFarland, she
  is the area Rep of the Nat'l Fan Club, as well as a teriffic Frank!
 Comments: I've been preforming at the Northlake AMC 8 theatre in
  Atlanta GA for the last 4 years  now, mostly as Brad Majors, but have
  played every part at least 2 times. We have a VERY good, and you could
  say a more 'professional' cast than most places (id assume). We
  preform every friday and Saturday night at approx 12:30 p.m. at the
  Northalke Festival AMC 8 theatre off of LaVista Rd near I-285 in
  Atlanta, GA. We welcome all types and persuasions, and are always
  looking for fresh flesh... erm.. new cast members. :>
 Comments: The cast at Northlake is cool.  However, I would reccomed
  that you live in the Atlanta area to join.  I live in Athens, and the
  commute got to me after a year.

The Georgia Theater - Athens, GA
 Comments: It used to be a regular movie house but now it is a
  bar...which still occasionally shows movies.	There is a big stage and
  the balcony is, so far as I've seen, always open.  They put on RHPS
  once per academic quarter and I believe the admission is $2.	A group
  of RHPS players just recently formed and performed for the first time
  at the winter quarter show. Because the theater is generally a club,
  there is a wet bar and smoking is allowed during the show.  If you
  don't want to sit in the regular (well worn) seats, there are tables
  and standing room in the back by the bar.  The management is very cool
  about all the stuff fans like to do and ask only that you do not touch
  the screen. The crowd tends to be almost exclusively college students,
  since Athens is a college town.  It's a great time for $2.

Henenway Theater - University of Hawaii Manoa campus, HI
 Saturday at midnight, $4.00

Varsity Theatre - Ames, IA
 Shown Halloween, the day before Halloween, and during our Spring
 Celebration, called Veishea. That usually the third week in April.

Greenbriar Theater - Indianapolis, IN
 Sat. Midnight $4.00
 Comments:  We are an up-and-comming cast that has been around for a
  while but is just now getting up on our feet.  If you have just come
  to Indiana for college or whatever and are looking for a regular
  Rocky, we can use some dedicated cast members.  We get wild and out of
  control, but hey, it's Rocky Horror and it is a hell of a time.  To
  get to Greenbriar, take the northern leg of I465, take the Meridian
  street exit and go south and then turn right onto 86th street and go
  for several blocks until you get to 86th and Ditch.

Harvard Square - Cambridge, MA
 Midnight on Fri and Sat, $6.75
 Comments: Across the street from Harvard.
 Comments: Cambridge,Mass' "Full Body Cast" puts on the RHPS with a real
  flair for perfection and, er, eagerness to please. With two full
  multi- talented companies, plus understudies, many of whom can play
  more than one role, and whose onstage appearances, costumes, and
  personas greatly resemble those of their characters, as well as full
  costumes, lights, props, and security tech crews, this exciting bunch
  has won popularity among Boston area audiences, and has earned many
  awards and much acclaim nationwide at RHPS conventions/competitions.
  The film itself is the original version (with "Super Heroes", and
  "Science Fiction - Reprise"), and has no breaks or skips. Viewers can
  exoect a great-looking performance and show, and maybe a few
  surprises, such as a special visit from "Animal", or "Barney", from
  Alex/655321, from a member of "the Clown family, or from Ed Norton or
  Phyllis Diller, or, if they're lucky, a gender-switched role or two,
  such as a male Columbia, a female Scotty, a male Trixie, or a
  Criminologist in drag!
  Show rituals include:
  1.) Full musical pre-show, with one or two pre-rehearsed numbers,
  (e.g. "Y.M.C.A.", "Dude (Looks Like A Lady)", "Hot For Teacher") along
  with one or two RH faves (stage versions), usually "Time Warp", and
  either "Sweet T", "Dammit Janet", or "Hot Patootie", also
  pre-rehearsed. Numbers change monthly.
  2.) Warm-up audience welcome/greeting speech; during which the whole
  house gets to warm up its wit and wisecracks, due to the "pun-tiful"
  words of either the (very!) Good Doctor or Commander Riff-Raff. Rules
  are laid out (LAID??) herein, that is: Rule #1 - "NO PUFTAS" (python),
  Rule #2 - No burning lighters, matches, flammable hairdos, etc (no
  "open flames") during "Frankenstein Place", and Rule #3 - No props! No
  tossing any rice, toast, etc, or using squirt guns (except tossing
  "off"/ using your "Love Gun" in the bathroom).
  3.) One or two virgins get their symoblic "cherries" popped (by way of
  a nice big shiny red balloon between the legs), and as an extra treat,
  get to play Betty Hapschatt in the wedding scene. If two picked,
  either the "lame-ometer" is used to judge who needs it more, or if
  they're both dead fucks, one pops the other!

Laurel Lakes Center - Laurel, MD
 Sat, Midnight,  $6.75
 Comments: While the show is new, the cast is experienced (many from the
  now-closed Marley Station Mall cast), and very good.	Management has
  agreed to keep it around as long as an it pulls a decent audience.  If
  audience grows sufficiently, management will consider a lower price.
  Water and TP are not permitted, but the rest is cool.

Towson Commons General Cinema - Towson, MD
 Address: 435 York Road
	  Towson Maryland, 21204
 Phone: (410) 825-5233
 Directions: I95 to 695 towards Towson (not Essex) to Dulaney Valley Rd
  exit south. Stay on Dulaney Valley Rd as it changes names to York Rd
  (at Joppa)  Theater is on the left at the corner of York Rd and
  Pennsylvania Ave.
 Comments: Our first night was April 8th.  There were over 100 people
  that night.  On our second night we had over 200 people!  The theater
  manager is completly behind the cast.  He let's the cast in for free,
  even though the ticket price is $1 for students and $2.50 for all
  others.  He gives us time to do introductions, virgin hunts, and
  general info before the show.  The theater holds about 300 people and
  has a changing area behind the screen.  Our cast "Castle
  Transylvanians" performs Friday and Saturday.  Our official opening
  show will be May 6.  We are on a probationary period.  That means that
  after the four weeks, the theater has a right to close.We don't think
  that will happen!  The audiences are very enthused about Rocky comming
  back to Maryland!

University of Southern Maine - Portland, ME
 [ed: shows moved to unspecified date]
 Contact Pete <PARAS@MAINE.MAINE.EDU> for more info.

Capitol - Flint, MI
 Comments: Does it once a year

Briarwood - Ann Arbor,	MI
 Sat. Midnight

Uptown - Minneapolis, MN
 Sat, Midnight
 Comments: I saw the RHPS there many times growing up: The Uptown is a
  relatively small theatre with great atmo.  Don't try to sneak in
  alcohol or too much rice, they frisk you at the door. Their motto:
  "Drink it before you get here."  The cast is good, the crowd is odd,
  as usual, and the people are relatively friendly, if messed up.
 Comments: They have a fairly new print with "Superheroes" & "SFDF -
  reprise" at the end.

Deville Cinema - Jackson, MS
 Comments: I was told that they haven't shown the movie regularly since
  the 15th anniversary. They only show it *very* occasionally, on
  "special occasions" (whatever THAT means), so anyone wanting to see
  the show there would be wise to call first and see if it's a "special
  occasion."

Silver Screen - Biloxi, MS
 Fri & Sat, Midnight, $4.50
 Comments: As I said, they show it every Fri. and Sat. at 12:00.  Entry
  is $4.50, but that includes pizza and beer (if you're of age.)  Great
  theater, primo sound system, HUGE screen...all in all, a great place
  to see RHPS.

Rialto - Raleigh, NC
 Friday, 11:30 pm
 The Wild and Untamed Players
 Comments: Rialto theatre is located at Five points on glenwood Ave in
  downtown Raleigh.  This is one of the best Rocky shows around.  I've
  been to shows in Pittsburgh-Dormont theatre, other NC shows, and even
  at Prince Charles theatre in London.	This show is awesome because of
  its dynamic nature and its liberal management.  All Rocky props are
  allowed including lighters and water throwing devices.  Want to stand
  up and move around wherever you want, no problem, anything goes!  This
  Rocky features an underwear run, wherin the audience strips and runs
  around after guess who Rocky!  Cool Virgin ritual!  Original lines!
  If you are a visitor from far away, ask someone for a place to stay
  for the night and go to the party after each show!

Cinema 35 - Paramus, NJ
 Fri & Sat, Midnight, $5.00
 Comments: Our cast went to the Rocky Horror mini convention in
  Washington DC on April 24th. Out of the six of us who went, three of
  us pulled first places in the costume contest. Out of all the other
  theatres represented there we were told by all of them that we had the
  loudest most enthusiastic Rocky crew any of them had ever seen. Even
  Sal heard some lines he never heard before. Our lines are always up to
  date. On that weekend we had some David Koresh lines strewn about by
  us. Our theatre allows most things except it only allows cast members
  and the five transylvanians we haqve to go up to the first few rows of
  the theatre and up to the screen. THere are no open flames permited in
  our theatre (well except for mike but hes okay) so the lighter scene
  is done with flashlights. We are allowed to throw just about anything.
  New lines are always welcome. The only problem with our theatre is
  that our film is falling apart. The entire dinner scene is cut from
  when Frank turns off the magnet until Eddies Teddy begins. During the
  wedding scene a huge blue line runs accross the screen back an forth.
  Its cool sometimes because every so often our film's mess ups lead to
  new lines. We are currently in the process of getting a new film fron
  TC Fox.

Harwan - Mt. Ephraim, NJ
 Saturday, midnight, $5.00
 Comments: One of the oldest casts in the country (15 years old), and
  the only cast in South Jersey and surrounding Philadelphia area. The
  Transducer Players are pictured on pages 120-121 of Sal's 15th
  anniversary book, as well as pictured on the back cover with the
  eastside cinema cast.  (That was just after they lost the 8th street
  playhouse in the village.)  Shows EVERY saturday night at midnight,
  admition is still only $5.00.  The theater itself is a single screen,
  600 seat vaudville theater complete with stage.  An average show is
  150-250 people.  Virgin of the week every week.  Theme nights and
  prizes all the time.	Origonal pre-shows.  Professional cast.  Highest
  recomendations. Phone:  609-931-8869

Brook Theatre - Bound Brook, NJ
 Comments: The Brook Theatre on Hamiltong Street in Bound Brook, NJ
  shows Rocky Horror on Friday and Saturday nights.  [ed: They have a
  cast, I met some of them at Age of Consent :) ]
  
? - Rutgers University, Trenton, NJ
 Fridays.
 Comments: My name is Jeff Mach and I'm the director of the cast
  commonly known as Midnight Decadence, the Decadent Midnights, or The
  Decadent MidKnights In Their Scarlet Tights (a play on our school's
  colors and sports teams).  We run the show at Rutgers University.
  We're fighting the administration, but we've managed to have some
  regular shows..Friday nights, so far, although we'll be doing some
  Saturdays to let Orthodox Jewish people come (no, really!  Honest!  My
  Janet here (her name's Nancy Martin, just thought I'd mention it
  because I'm babbling anyway) thinks the Orthodox Jewish thing is a
  joke, but it's not...[end digression]  Anyway, we have a perfect 16mm
  film with Superheroes and a particularly..um...innovative show, even
  by Rocky standards..(we'll probably be posting soon on the net about
  our proposed de-virginization game, Full-Body Twister)...not that
  that's necessarily a good thing ;) ....um...well, if you have any
  questions, or even if you don't, just e-mail me... Jeff Mach

  other midnight-type movies on the same schedule. (93 May 14)

Amherst - Buffalo, NY

 Comments: If you're in Buffalo, stop in and visit the cast of "Crazed
 Imagination" sometime....:)

Lockport Mall - Buffalo, NY

 Comments: The crowds are small and the cast is sporadic..but it's fun!!
  It is off of Transit Rd.,FYI

Movieland 8th Street - New York, NY
 Price - $7.50  (Just like most New York City movies...Yuck)
 Every Friday and Saturday night
 Comments: Rocky is still going in New York City at Movieland, on
  8th St. (Just 1 block from the, now closed, 8th St. Playhouse). While
  the cast is constantly changing, there are a few regulars, including
  several people who date back to the Playhouse, and even the Waverly,
  before that.  Rice isn't allowed, but lighters, and noisemakers are.
  In fact, they are sold by the cast for people who forgot to bring
  props.

Cinema East - Nyack, NY
 Comments: I enjoyed this theater.  went there twice.  they have a pink
  panther short at the beginning, and (when i was there) a good cast.
  mostly the same lines as 8th street playhouse.
 Comments: This theater has been playing the RHPS on & off since it it
  came out! Collectively about 15 yrs.	It's even in the RHPS Book!
    Cinema East had been a legend for a while, but now it is hopping once
  again! Early October '92, it had an audiance of 5 and no cast. On
  Halloween '92, there was a cast and an attendence of 316!! That cast
  (The "Inside Insanity" Cast) is still there over a year and a half
  later and is working like hell to regain Cinema East the rep. it once
  had! But it's hard, because people just don't seem as interested
  anymore.
    But if you are interested, It's a great place to see it!  The
  theater is a 750 seat auditorium with with a stage and a GREAT
  atmosphere!!	The cast is very friendly & enthusiastic and it's
  members are ages 14-25!  They have a pre-show crowd booster and
  'Virgin Sacrifices' before the show as well as a Pink Panther
  'Inspector' cartoon which is also acted out on stage!  Their costumes
  are great, including a Rocky costume that falls apart like the one in
  the movie! They also have a lot of props (i.e.-coffin, elevator, tank,
  juke box, weight set, etc.) and a whole Crim. set!!
    They encourage field trips, as for there have been a few to the
  theater already.  Once three bus loads of people showed up for a show.
    Admision is $6.50 and when the cast can afford it, they
  make up 'Virgin Kits' full of props & goodies! They have a
  weekly newsletter called "The Insanity Insider" and are
  working on putting out a Fanzine!
    They enjoy theme nights and special shows every once in a while to
  keep it fun and interesting for the audiance as well as themselves!
    Their achievments are an audiance of 406 on Halloween '93, & 350 on
  a 'normal' night once!  They have performed at Ramapo College (and
  look forward to performing there again) and also at Movie City in
  Edison, NJ.  They look forward to possible shows at Drew University,
  St. Thomas Aquintas, and a possible production of "The Rocky Horror
  Show!"  They can occasionally be found in local Nyack and Nanuet
  newspapers, and were once in "The Asbury Park Press!"
    If you want to see the show, the Theater's # is +1-914-358-
  6631 for rec. or +1-914-358-6632 for directions.
    Any donations to the cast are very much apprieciated. Even scrap
  matieral or ideas and comments/criticizims are welcome! They are used
  to keep up our costumes and props and do fun things for the audiance!!
    DON'T LET NYACK DIE OUT AGAIN!!!  SEE THE RHPS EVERY SAT. @
  MIDNITE!!"Stay Sane 'INSIDE INSANITY'"!!!!!! :*

Jo-Mor's Stoneridge Theater - Rochester, NY
 Fri & Sat, midnight, $5.00
 Comments:  I am a former member of the cast that performs here, "Sweet
  Temptations".  When I left, the show had deteriorated to the point of
  being just not fun anymore--obnoxious management, random horsing
  around while in costume, etc.  However, the cast finally saw the low
  attendance which resulted from this, and is now trying to get serious
  and rebuild itself.  I'm always willing to give second chances when
  they're due...so go check 'em out, and give them some well-needed
  encouragement.
 Comments: I'm a current member of the cast.  It's fairly open, and
  we're always trying to recruit new cast members.  We enjoy good
  relations with management, the cast and regulars regularly hang out
  together (after the show, and otherwise), and we interact strongly
  with our audiences.

Hoyts' Cinema - Carousel Center, Syracuse, NY
 Comments: Carousel is a large, semi-expensive mall and the cinemas are
  appropriate to that setting. Amazingly enough, they will let you bring
  pretty much everything, including water, toast, rice, etc... Rocky
  fans in the area have been quoted as saying "We're not sure if the
  management is naive or just plain nuts." One other note: the cinemas
  are very centrally located in the mall, so if you go in costume, you
  get to parade through past everyone. Ah well. 'Tis the price we must
  pay. :)

 Comments: There is a good show here. People that saw it in other
  theaters say that this is very good. There is a fine cast and good
  managment. This is where the editor of this list goes.

Graceland - Columbus, OH
 Fri & Sat, Midnight, $4.00
 (614) 888-3523
 Comments: The Rocky Horror Picture Show is playing at the Graceland
  Twin Cinema in Columbus, Ohio at the Graceland shopping Center off of
  High Street.	It plays both Friday and Saturday nights at midnight (of
  course) with a live cast both nights (two members of which are writing
  this message). Price of admission is $4.00, though the cast does get
  in for free.	If you have any questions, call the theatre at (614)
  888-3523 and ask for Brian, Mae, or Wendy.  If you have any virgins
  amongst you, ask for Brian, he'll take care of them. P.S. only rice is
  allowed for audience props! and no fucking rice at the cast!!!

Real Movies - Cincinnati, OH
 Every other weekend

Maumee theater - Maumee, OH
 Every now and then

Cla-Zel - Bowling Green, OH
 Every now and then

Clinton Street - Portland, OR
 Sat, $4.00 with cast, $3.50 without
 Comments: Shows run every Saterday night with the Caberiet performing
  about every other weekend. It has been showing RHPS for almost 17
  years which I believe makes it the longest running show in the US.
  Audience varies, tends to be louder on cast nights, but good. There
  are often theme nights, last night, for example was "Fuck with your
  character night" The one con is that you are considered a virgin if
  you have never seen RHPS at Clinton Street. Overall it's lots of fun.

Lehigh - Allentown, PA
 Fri & Sat, Midnight, $5.50
 Comments: Name of the cast is "Sins of the Flesh" out of Bethlehem, PA.
  Excellent cast, all ages and skill levels.  Has been known to perform
  RHPS at more than one location at the same night.  (ie  enuff talented
  cast for two complete performances.)
 Comments: All props are allowed except open flames and water.	They
  have Superheroes.

The Hollywood Theater - Pittsburgh, PA
 Sat, 10pm, $3.00
 Comments: They have a performance cast. They also show TWO Tim Curry
  Videos before Rocky starts, Paradice Garage and I do the Rock. They
  are the only place in the Pittsburgh area that has the current rights.
  You are allowed all standard props except WATER. we also have a brand
  new Print of it and it looks GREAT!
 Comments: Not only that, but it *does* contain the entire "Super
  Heroes"--only time in 10+ years of viewing in both SoCal and
  Pittsburgh I have ever seen that scene.

Roxy - Philadelphia, PA
 Midnight, $5.50
 Comments: "The cast is compleatly crazy."  They're good, but sometimes
  get carried away.  The theater is small, but large enough to do a good
  show. You are not allowed to throw anything or have open flames
  either.

State Theater - State College, PA
 Comments: I just saw the May Rocky listings and thought you might want
  to know about Vanilla Challice.  We are State College's RHPS cast.
  The State theater (usually where we perform) currently doesn't have
  Rocky but if CinemaWorld (the owners of the State) believes in
  consistancy Rocky will be back to Central Pennsylvania in mid-October.
  The price of admission is roughly $6 and the theater is located on
  College Ave. (Rt. 26) in State College, PA.
    The cast is a motley crue of old actors and new virgins out for a
  good time.  Warn the prudes though.  One of our most popular Janets is
  male and we have two women who play Rocky him/her/itself.  New people
  are welcome and travelling members of other casts frequently guest
  star. The show is (as always) at midnight Fridays and Saturdays.  We
  expect it to start in mid-Octoberand last until (cross the fingers)
  late January.
    That's really it but in case you're wondering about our name.  A
  Vanilla Challice is two shots of Fruit Punch, Pink Lemonade, Pepsi,
  Diet Pepsi, Mugs rootbeer, and Mountain Dew.	Mix well.  The
  concoction tastes like vanilla and comes from the cast hanging out at
  Taco Ball after the show.  Guess which drinksthe place has.

Meadowbrook - Warwick, RI
 Comments: (This show has suffered greatly due to a pissing contest
  between the former cast and the current cast, when it should have been
  between the former cast and the management. Since the last review was
  written by a disgruntled former cast member, I will give you a more
  fair picture.)
    The film is a mono print with Science Fiction reprise (no Superhero's)
  and has some skips (one of them cuts out most of 'I'm going home').
  The audience has to sign a waver to enter (it just releases the
  theater from people claiming whiplash when hit with rice or toilet
  paper) but you are free to throw props and dance in the isles.
  Although the cast suffers from what seems to be lackluster support
  from management, they perform with much enthusiasm, despite the fact
  that they are sometimes undermanned. And the ongoing cast war between
  them and the former cast, who feel any cast currently here should
  suffer due to their poor relationship with the theater management, has
  not detered them from putting on the best show they can.


Powell Cinemas - Knoxville, TN
 Friday, Midnight, $3.00
 Comments:
  Most of the cast members are really good, though sometimes one member
  wil not show up and hapless friends of the cast get pressed into
  service, sometimes with hilarious results.  Audience members can bring
  props with the only two rules being that you're not allowed to throw
  liquids, or those industrial-size rolls ot toilet paper.  This seemed
  to be a common sense thing, but some dolt brought them and someone got
  nailed, so it's now an "official" rule.
    --
  Oh yeah, this cast will also be doing the show at the Bijou in
  Downtown Knox-Vegas the first two weekends in August, admission is
  still unknown at this time though last year it was a suggested
  donation of $3, but if you were broke, or just plain cheap, you could
  get in free. :)  From what I heard, the rules at the Bijou are a bit
  stricter, and you can only throw popcorn.  I'll update you on the
  admission and other things if you want me to.. David Gridley

 Address:
  Varsity Theater
  4329 University Way NE  (Right across from the University Bookstore)
  Seattle, Washington
  (206) 632-3131
 Comments: Since November 26, 1993.  Moved around the corner from the
  Neptune where it ran for over 15 years. Virgin games before the show.
  Live cast.
 Comments: There are still virgin games before the show (although they
  open the doors at 11:45, leaving us precious little time to get
  anything done before the show).
  The theater is open on Christmas and New Year's, so if they fall on a
  Saturday (as they did this year), we'll be there.
  
Oriental - Milwaukee, WI
 Saturdays at Midnight, Admission $6
 Comments: Located on the corner of Farwell and North on the fashionable
  east side of Milwaukee.  A Landmark theatre which seats about 500,
  1000 with balcony (only open for huge crowds, such as Halloween [775
  people this year])--and and all important center isle to do the Time
  Warp in!  Performing cast is "Sensual Daydreams", which performs every
  Saturday except holidays and a limited schedule in the summer.  The
  cast is big on timing and performance. They also have some excellent
  large props (tank, control panel, weight set, etc).  Weekly virgin
  contest (randomly selected on the Virgin Wheel).  Props such and rice
  and toast are allowed.  Masterbation is allowed in the back row. [ed:!!]

Hoyts Centre - Sydney, Australia
 Fri, 11:30pm, AUS$11.50 Concession AUS$8
 Comments: Cast usually hang out in the bar at Hoyts, so come by and say
  hello! Hoyts is a 'family' cinema, so no fucking swearing, alright? We
  have been running in this incarnation for four years (Anniversary show
  is Fri May 28, 1993). The cinema is quite good, and we have a great
  print, *including* the SuperHeroes ending! Props are mostly cool, just
  no fried rice or anything squishy :( As always, we need fresh lines,
  so feel free to bring your along!
 Comments: Good cast, some innovative callbacks, and a good quality film
  (with Super Heroes at the end, incidently). Movie doesn't start until
  around 12:00, with the cast building the atmosphere with audience
  participation prior to the screening by sing-a-longs and virgin
  introductions etc. All props are permitted and encouraged (with the
  exception of naked flames). Sheets of newspaper handed out at the
  door, to bewilder the virgins who don't know what to expect.

Cinema Mondo - Helsinki, Finland
 Sat, 11:00 - Used to be every Sat at 11:00, but it has been on a break
	      for few months now, though they promised that it'll get
	      back to programme.
 Was 40 FIM, what is about $8.00
 Comments: A small one, but shows used to be good. And as I said: RHPS
  hasn't been on the programme for some months, but it might come back
  next autumn or later on the summer.

Museums Lichtspiele - Munich, Germany
 Every day, early evening, on weekends late night, ca. DM 10 
 Location: Near the ``Deutsches Museum'' in Munich, Germany
 Comments: This theatre is extra-ordinary one. They play every day the
  RHPS (since 15 or so years) and the ``Blues Brothers'' (since 8 years).
  ``The Big Blue'' is shown at least weekly in the long, english version
  (with french subtitles). Other cult movies are shown reguarly as well.
  There is a special RHPS packet available at the cash bar, containing 
  rice, a (loaded :-) water pistole and some other stuff you need 
  for *really* enjoying the show. 

The Classic - Harold's Cross, Dublin, Ireland.
 Fri & Sat 11:00 pm
 Comments: As far as I know, it's the longest running RHPS in the world
  at over 11 years... and it's still going strong. [ed: not the longest]
 Comments: I've just read the list, and I'd just like to give you some
  info on the Harolds X cinema. There are about 30 regulars who dress up
  for the show, some of whom have been attending for 11 years. The rest
  of the cinema is filled with virgins and occasional attenders. The
  cinema is quite large (in Irish Terms) and there has never been a case
  when the film hasn't gone out on the Saturday or Friday or both. The
  during film shouts and chants are totally different from those on the
  soundtrack, but this ain't a crime.

X-Ta - Tel-Aviv, Israel
 Comments: There's one theatre in the Tel-Aviv area that about once or
  twice a month screens RHPS, it is called X-Ta and is VERY small.. The
  next show there will be on the 26.2.94. From time to time there is at
  least a partial cast, depending on whoever arrives.

Cinema Mexico - Milan, Italy
 Fri 8:00pm & 10:00pm
 Comments: water is not allowed.

Paramount Theatre - Wellington, New Zealand
 Either Fri or Sat at 11:15pm, $8.00 or $6.50
 Comments: Either Friday or Saturday nite at 11:15pm.	Generally best
  to watch the papers to see if it's on.   Admission is $8, or $6.50 if
  you have a Radio Active Sub Card. The theatre is pretty small, but any
  props are allowed except water.   There's a fairly large hardcore
  cast, but the average age of them is pretty low (~17- 19).   We're
  loud, and we're rowdy, but it's good fun and we love to come up with
  new AP.   The film is somewhat cut, missing the entire reprise of 'I
  can Make you a Man' to halfway through the Narrator's speech, and it
  jumps in a few places.   We've moved from 3 other theatres; we're
  running out of options, but we stillknow how to party.

Hollywood Theatre - Avondale, Auckland, New Zealand

  Tel: ++64-9-8289285 for manager
 Comments: Yes you can bring your rice (I checked) or confetti and your
  toast, and your water pistols, and your newspapers.  Naked flames not
  allowed (I suggest you bring a flash light)!	Currently (25Feb94)
  showing every Saturday at 10:00.  The first Saturday of each month is
  regarded as particularly dangerous for virgins. Seats 320 people
  downstairs, and 180 upstairs. (500 total)  Has run RHPS every Saturday
  (almost) from 1979 to 1989 and has ran RHPS intermittently ever since.
  Also, the Holly Wood is one of the last remaining Theatre to still have
  an original German "Wurlitzer" Organ from the days when Pictures were
  silent.  They operate an active "Wurlitzer" appreciation society of
  sorts.  However I am not sure of the exact details, ring the Manager to
  check this out.

  BTW: you can get a souvenir RHPS bic-ball-point-pen for only 0.50c
  complete with the jaws/lips printed on it! [ed: write to

Prince Charles Cinema - London, UK
 Fridays
 Comments: off Leicester Square, and they are still performing there,
  every Friday.  Their Space Riff & Magenta are a couple called
  Stephanie and David who run the British RHPS Fan Club. Their address
  is:
       Time Warp Fan Club
       1 Elm Grove
       Hildenborough
       Tonbridge
       Kent TN11 9HE, ENGLAND
  If you write to them and enclose an international reply coupon, they
  can send details of how to join, and they have loads of info on casts
  around the UK. (And there are some!)
 Comments: There seems to be some confusion about whether Rocky still
  plays at the Prince Charles cinema in London - well, it definately
  does. Every Friday at midnight, usually to a packed (but rather
  virginal) audience. Stephanie & David are still in charge, although
  many of the cast members have left over the last year - they were
  advertising for new members last time I heard from them.  I'm not
  involved personally, as I can't get there regularly, but quite a few
  of the cast are friends of mine. The virgin sacrifice is a bit tame,
  but it's funny, and they're fairly lenient about props - no naked
  flames, and no pissing off the balcony is all they ask.  They really
  are excellent - great costumes, good timing with the film etc, and if
  there were a few more regulars, (preferably in costume) it would be
  near-perfect. Most of the fans are more involved in going to see the
  stage show version at the moment though - it's been VERY sucessful,
  and will be in the West End over summer.  Jonathon Morris was born to
  play Frank, and seeing Patricia back on stage as Magenta is amazing.
