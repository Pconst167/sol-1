2.  A Biography of Billy Joel's Early Years
-------------------------------------------
	Billy Joel
	Before the Piano Man
	A look into Billy Joel's early recordings
	by Paul Maclauchlan (paul@moore.com)
	Copyright 1991 by Paul Maclaughlan

	William Joseph Martin (Billy) Joel, born May 9, 1949, in Levitown
	Long Island, New York.  He began piano lessons at age 4.  As a young
	teenager, Joel discovered the joys of reading books and decided to
	become a history teacher.  Billy divided his time between music,
	street gangs and boxing.  After 22 bouts he gave up the ring for
	piano.  "...when I came to a difficult passage I'd start knuckling
	the keyboards."  "I idolized The Beatles, especially Paul - nobody
	could come up with the melodies he could".

	His first band was a four piece beat band called "The Echoes".  The
	Echoes played cover versions of popular hits, including songs by The
	Rolling Stones, The Kinks, The Zombies and, of course, The Beatles.
	In late 1964, Billy was pressed into service by producer Shadow
	Morton, who was recording The Shangri-Las in a Levitown basement
	studio.  Billy played on "Leader Of The Pack", but was never paid,
	since he wasn't a union member.
	
	The Echoes became "The Lost Souls" in 1965, "The Emerald Lords" in
	1966 and "The Hassles" in 1967.  The Hassles were signed to United
	Artists (UA) Records in 1968.  The Hassles featured: John Dizek
	(vocals), Billy Joel (Keyboards), Jon Small (drums), Howie Blauvelt
	(bass) and Richard McKenner (guitar).  He occasionally billed himself
	as: Billy Joe Joel!

	The Hassles self-titled debut album contained original songs (by W.
	Joel) and covers.  Produced by Tony Michael and Vinnie Gorman. 
	United Artists 6631.  [see discography below for track listings]
	Two singles from the album flopped: Every Step I Take, Every Move I
	Make b/w I Hear Voices and You've Got Me Hummin' b/w I'm Thinking.

	Later the same year, 1968, The Hassles recorded and released their
	second, and final, album: Hour Of The Wolf.  Produced by Thomas Kay.
	United Artists 6699.  This album's songs were all originals by the
	band.  [see discography below for track listings]  Singles from the
	album were: 4 O'Clock In The Morning b/w Let Me Bring You To The
	Sunshine and Night After Day b/w Country Boy.

	The album was followed by a non-LP single, Great Balls Of Fire (Jack
	Hammer-Otis Blackwell) [the Jerry Lee Lewis song] b/w Travellin' Band
	(W.Joel) [not the CCR song].  Produced by The Hassles, that release
	sunk without a trace, and The Hassles were disbanded.

	Billy and Jon Small (The Hassles drummer) then formed Atilla, and
	recorded an album Billy later described as "psychedelic bullshit". 
	The album was released on Epic (E 30030) and produced by Irwin Mazur,
	William Joel and Jonathan Small.  All music and lyrics by William
	Joel and Jonathan Small.  [see discography below for track listings]
	Billy eventually married Jon Small's wife, Elizabeth.

	Billy reportedly still loves Jimi Hendrix, but hates the album that
	was influenced by him.  After Atilla, Billy worked as a rock
	journalist for Changes magazine and recorded a commercial for
	Bachmann's Pretzels with Chubby Checker.

	In 1971, he recorded his first "solo" album, "Cold Spring Harbor",
	for Family Records.  Billy was embarrassed by the record, which had
	been mastered at the wrong speed.  It was produced by Artie Ripp. 
	All songs were composed by Billy Joel.  [see discography below for
	track listings]  Singles: Everybody Loves You Now b/w She's Got A
	Way and Tomorrow Is Today b/w Everybody Loves You Now.

	Discouraged by touring for six months to support the album, opening
	for acts like J. Geils Band and Badfinger, Billy moved to California.
	There he performed as Bill Martin at Corky's on Van Nuys Blvd and at
	the Executive Lounge piano bar on Wilshire Blvd.  The experience is
	related in his first Columbia single: Piano Man.

	Information from this article is from liner notes by Glenn A. Baker
	and articles and books by Jeff Tamarkin and Peter Gabaccini.  Also
	from the records themselves.

V. Origins/Meanings of Songs, plus Other Misc. Questions
========================================================
Bear in mind that many of these songs can have other meanings.  These
are just Billy's intended meanings.  Feel free to interpret any of these
songs any way you like.

1.  Who/What is Captain Jack?
-----------------------------
	According to Billy Joel, Captain Jack was the neighborhood 
	drug dealer in his neighborhood when he was growing up.

2.  Who is Rosalinda in "Rosalinda's Eyes"?
-------------------------------------------
	Billy's Mom.

3.  Who is the "Famous Violinist Incognito" who plays on "Downeaster Alexa"?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Itzhak Perlman.  They couldn't use his real name due to legal 
	complications about Perlman appearing on a different record label.

4.  What is the significance of the record title "The Bridge"?
--------------------------------------------------------------
	[From an interview in the back of the piano sheet music book for
	The Bridge]

	"I came up with the title THE BRIDGE about two-thirds of the way
	through the album ... I I didn't really know why when I first said
	it. Then when I thought about it, I realized there's been a lot of
	connections made on this record. There's a duet with Ray Charles,
	and Ray Charles is somebody I admired for years and years. That was
	a connection made, so there's a bridge. There's a song that was done
	with Steve Winwood playing the Hammond organ, and I've always
	admired Steve--for years and years. So there's another bridge. The
	album is probably more like an older Billy Joel album, harkening
	back to 52ND STREET and THE STRANGER, in that it's not a concept
	album. The songs are not necessarily related to one another, but
	they were written in the same [time] period. And for that reason,
	because there's a connection to the older stuff, there's another
	bridge. I also see it as a direction into a future type of writing."

5.  What's the significance behind "Vienna"?
--------------------------------------------
	Billy's Dad lives in Vienna.  He wrote the song after going there
	to visit him once.

6.  What (or who) was the inspiration for "Big Shot"?
-----------------------------------------------------
	A very bad date with Bianca Jagger.

7.  What ever happened to the "Root Beer Rag" newsletter?
---------------------------------------------------------
	This newsletter was produced by Billy's former management
	agency.  When Billy broke up with his former manager, Frank
	Weber, the newsletter ceased to be published.
	
8.  Which of Billy's songs have other artists covered?
------------------------------------------------------
	"Miami 2017" -- Richard Marx (_Now and Forever_)
	"New York State of Mind" -- Susannah McCorkle
	"New York State of Mind" -- Oleta Adams (_Evolution_)
	"New York State of Mind" -- Rolf from the Muppets (_Old Brown Ears
		is Back_)

	"Say Goodbye to Hollywood" -- Nigel Olson
	"Shameless" -- Garth Brooks (_Ropin' the Wind_)
	"You May Be Right" -- Southside Johnny (Theme Music for CBS's
		"Dave's World")
