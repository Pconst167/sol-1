Subject: 2.1: Introduction

In response to all of those ``Isn't ska some dance form of reggae?''
questions, I present the following historical background to the music we
call ska, gleaned from liner notes I have lying about the place, various
postings to (news:alt.music.ska), and sundry emailings with helpful ska
fans.

This is part 2, $Revision: 3.36 $, posted to (news:alt.music.ska),
(news:rec.music.info), (news:alt.skinheads), (news:alt.answers),
(news:rec.answers), and (news:news.answers).  This FAQ is posted twice
a month, whether it needs to be or not.

This FAQ file is also available for anonymous ftp on the archive site
rtfm.mit.edu as the file `pub/usenet/news.answers/music/ska-faq/part2'.

Disclaimer:  I am not a musician, nor do I play one on TV.
Neither am I a musical historian.  I do love ska music, so I offer this
material unto the public domain.

Acks:
       Michael Cancilla (mailto:mcancill@polyslo.calpoly.edu) posted a long list
of ska bands that I have incorporated into this FAQ.  That list has grown
to list over 500 bands!  Mike Fragassi (mailto:mfragass@ucs.indiana.edu) emailed
me about 10k in response to my request for more info and is still at it.
Thanks Mikes!  Thanks also to everyone else in a.m.s and other reaches of
netspace who sent me info.

       Dance harder!

Subject: 2.6: Are there any feature-length ska movies?

Yes.  There is a great concert film by Joe Massot about ska in 1980
Britain called `Dance Craze.' It features live footage of Bad Manners, The
(English) Beak, The Bodysnatchers, Madness, The Specials, The Selecter.
Rico Rodriques, trombonist from the Skatalites, plays horns with The
Specials.  You can order the video from Beat Hotel Records,
3022 W.  12 Mile Rd., Berkely, MI, 48072 USA, (313) 544-2485 (and probably
other places, too).

   In the beach-blanket revival film with Annette Funicello, ``Back to the
Beach,'' Fishbone backs Annette singing ``Jamaican Ska (Do the Ska)'' and
the beach crowd skanks away (sort of).

    For real rude boy action, check out ``The Harder They Come,'' starring
Jimmy Cliff.

Subject: 2.8: What are some ska-related 'zines (fan-created magazines)?

   Here is the info I have:

   Mike Fragassi, mfragass@ucs.indiana.edu, who supplied much of this
info advises:
         I have personally not yet tried any of these, except for the
     WNUR newsletter, from which I have gotten the addresses of all of
     the rest. Some of these seem to be info-sheets for a given band.
     Others are more comprehensive ("Rude" and "F.B.I.", for instance,
     are highly recommended).  All zines should be assumed to be written
     in the language of the country they come from.  Prices are the most
     recent info, again obtained from Chuck Wren's newsletter; neither
     me nor he nor anyone who handed you a copy of this FAQ are
     responsible for mail screw-ups or unreturned money; if in doubt,
     send a SASE first.

     You see, me and R.S. (resident skinhead) have begun a scooter zine
     that is chalk full of ska stuff like interviews with the
     skatterbrains and King Apparatus.  Our main focus is on scooters;
     however, ska is an essential component of the Carla Ronci Scooter
     Zine (who's Carla Ronci? she may become the patron saint of the

     The Model Citizen is Milwaukee's fine cold-filtered Ska-zine.

     It is 20+ full pages dedicated to Ska music in 7"x8.5" format.  We
     do news, reviews, interviews and whatever we think will interest
     you.  Our first issue is already out and includes an interview
     with the Invaders.  The next issue is due for mid-March and will
     contain an interview with Hi Ball Holiday, a whole bunch of stuff
     on the American Ska-thic 2 party, the incredible true life story
     of what happened to Mista Mina, and lot's of other cool things.
     We clearly recommend that you order your copy today ... you will
     not be dissapointed.

     The cost is one dollar or 3 stamps.  Always looking to print
     interviews, news, opinions and whatnot!

     Also, we have come for your advertising!  Anyone looking to put an
     ad in our zine is welcome to.  Our policy is as follows; ads
     directly relating to Ska get it free.  Otherwise:  full page =
     $25, half page =$10, and quarter page = $5.  Wouldn't you like to
     expose other people to something you're selling?!

     Please make checks and money orders to Joel Kuester ...  NOT The
     Model Citizen!

   Now in its 5th issue, The Model Citizen will be renamed
"SKALEIDOSCOPE" as of issue six. See , for more information.

Subject: 2.9: How do I get a ska email-based mailing list?  What are other
ska resources on the Internet?

There are a few options.

* ``Monkey Man,'' The EMail Ska Distribution list, is available from
Joel Eisner.  Joel's hopes for ``Monkey Man'' are:
        The sole purpose of the newsletter is to unite people interested
        in SKA and the SKA culture, past and present, since the popular
        media time and time again over looks this important musical
        form.
        Finally, I only ask three things:
                1. Send me your e-mail address (if I don't have it)
                2. Send some e-mail  (I am not going to write this whole thing alone)
                3. Spread the word
        Thank you,
        Joel Eisner  (eisner@primate.wisc.edu)
        1223 Capitol Ct
        Madison, WI  53715

Already hundreds of people are signed up.  Contact Joel and get involved today.
Tell your Usenet-less friends!

* There is also a ska confer group that runs like a listserv (all posts are
automagically mailed to all members of the list).  To subscribe, just send
email to tanner@umich.edu or bobafett@umich.edu.  ``Moneky Man'' is also posted
to this confer service.

* Also, you can send email to Andre Prochaska (djdre@aol.com) to get onto
the ``SkaBeat'' mailing list, as described in section 2.8 (Ska-related
'zines).

THE SHACK
Compiled by Sean Flowerdew, released in America 1993 on Bib Records

This is definitely my favorite "modern" ska comp. Virtually every song is
great, and there's a great cross-section of ska, from the more traditional
Hepcat through the "freestyle" hip-hop influenced ska of See No Evil, Maroon
Town and Messer Banzani (It's interesting that the hip-hop ska thing never
caught on in America).

Nutty Boys: "People"
Hepcat: "Dance Wid Me"
See No Evil: "Ghetto Charged"
Laurel Aitken: "Rude Boy Dream"
The Toasters: "Social Security"
Lynval Golding & Neville Staples (featuring Finny): "Wear You To The Ball"
The Bakesys: "Animated Violence"
Bim Skala Bim: "Wandering Soul"
Loonie Tunes: "I Don't Think So"
Maroon Town: "Nostalgia"
Lynval Golding & Neville Staples: "Why?"
Bim Skala Bim: "Golden Arm"
The Club: "But Not You"
Special Beat: "Hypocrite"
The Hotknives: "Dave and Mary"
Maroon Town: "Pound To The Dollar"
International Beat: "Magical Feeling"
Ruder Than You: "Get Some Peace"
Nutty Boys: "Magic Carpet"
Messer Banzani: "Peace is Wonder"
Neville Staples aka Judge Roughneck: "Rude Boy De Ponporbation (007)"

***

Distributed by Semaphore Productions (Holland)

Skeletones: "Jill Victoria"
Hoodlum Empire: "C. Johnson's Clothes"

like  they're singing "Hide and Seek". Oh well.)
Six Feet Deep: "Smoking Barrel"
Skaface: "No Idea"
Bim Skala Bim: "Paraguyan Sun" (NOT live, although it says so on the album --
this one's Bim's fuckup!)
