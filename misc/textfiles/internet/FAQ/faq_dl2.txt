The David Letterman Theme Song (as sung by Bill Murray)
-------------------------------------------------------

      It's a late night show starring Dave,
      Dave Letterman, Indianapolis' own,
      Silly skits, music and guests,
      Is Bud Melman for real, hey man I don't know
      It's news and it's sports, It's weather reports,
      Tryin so hard to please you,
      It's good for the farmers, milkmen and snake charmers,
      There's even a chuckle or two,
      It's The Dave Letterman show,
      TV's crazy funny man,
      Where is that Marvin Albert with his bloopers,
      Your gonna love, love that Dave, love is Dave,  Here comes Dave!


The David Letterman Theme Song (as sung by Paul Shaffer)
--------------------------------------------------------

Gerson Koenig explains:
There was a viewer mail letter once from a guy who had a public access
show and had his own lyrics for the song, which he used on said show.
I can't remember any of his lyrics, but Paul came back with his own
set of lyrics that went something like this:

      Down in Melbourne, F-L-A,
      Some guy named Bill(?) is ripping me off.
      And don't you know now, my lawyers say legally
      That Bill's house and car belong to me.


Late Night World of Love
------------------------

      There's a cool breeze blowin'.
      You can feel it 'cross the land.
      It's surfin' fun,
      A dad and son,
      A place where you can stand.

      And Late Night is the reason
      Our forefathers fought with pride.
      It's clear blue skies,
      Grandma's eyes,
      A feeling that's deep inside.

      [chorus]
      It's a Late Night world.
      It's a world that we can share.
      So turn on your TV
      And watch it with me.
      It's a Late Night world of love.

      There's a whole new generation
      Who are willing to say "yes."
      It's soups and stews,
      A wall of shoes,
      A thing called "happiness."

      So change the channel, change your life.
      It doesn't cost a thing.
      We're talking loud,
      We're standing proud,
      Now join us as we sing.

      [repeat chorus]


The Viewer Mail Theme
---------------------

      Viewer Mail, Viewer Mail,
      Friday is the day we read viewer mail.
      First we read them, Then we answer them, 
      That's the little thing we call Viewer Mail


Lettermania (by Carl Reiner)
----------------------------

      Lettermania,
      Lettermania,
      (repeat 100 times)
      Let your Lettermania go!
 


Car and Truck Rental Song
-------------------------

      Driving the road, rent a car.
      Carrying a load, rent a truck.
      We have the latest models.
      Rent a car or truck from us.


Yeah!
-----

      Yeah! (repeat as desired)


Bermuda
-------

      Bermuda!
      It's a cuckoo kind of place,
      A nutty, nutty kind of space.
      Bermuda!

Up With Hal Gurnee
------------------

      What's up with Hal Gurnee?
      He is our kind of guy.
      So what's up with Hal Gurnee?
      The best friend that money can buy!

GE Theme Song
-------------

      You can put your confidence
      In the brand of excellence,
      The household appliances
      That bear the name GE!

The CBS Mailbag Song
--------------------

      Letters
      We get letters
      We get stacks and stacks of letters


 The Strong Guy, The Fat Guy, The Genius 
 ---------------------------------------

 The Strong Guy, the Fat Guy, the Genius
 God gave them each a special gift at birth
 They break it, they eat it, they solve it
 That's the reason they were put upon this Earth

 A Lobster...he'll punch it!
 Some Corn...he'll munch it!
 The Genius...man that guy is really smart
 Mr. Strong Guy, Mr. Fat Guy, Mr. Genius
 We thank you from the bottom of our heart

 The Strong Guy, the Fat Guy, the Genius
 God gave them each a special gift at birth
 They break it, they eat it, they solve it
 That's the reason they were put upon this Earth

 One's strong, one's fat, one's a genius
 There's nothing they don't break or eat or know
 Nobody's sure where they came from
 Nobody's sure where they might go

 A Drum...he'll break it!
 A Plum...he'll eat it!
 A Sum...he'll add it in his head
 Mr. Strong Guy, Mr. Fat Guy, Mr. Genius
 You walk where weak thin  dumb guys  fear to tread

 The Strong Guy, the Fat Guy, the Genius
 God gave them each a special gift at birth
 They break it, they eat it, they solve it
 That's the reason they were put upon this Earth

 The Strong Guy, the Fat Guy, the Genius
 God gave them each a special gift at birth
 They break it, they eat it, they solve it
 That's the reason they were put upon this Earth

 He'll break...any item!
 Raw eggs...he'll bite 'em!
 No question...can stump his mighty brain
 Mr. Strong Guy, Mr. Fat Guy, Mr. Genius
 Three rays of hope in a world thats gone insane

 He'll bust it...first try!
 Hey bunny...good bye!
 Reindeer?  His face shows no concern
 Mr. Strong Guy, Mr. Fat Guy, Mr. Genius
 You help expectin' nothing in return

 The Strong Guy, the Fat Guy, the Genius
 God gave them each a special gift at birth
 They break it, they eat it, they solve it
 That's the reason they were put upon this Earth
 That's the reason they were put upon this Earth
 That's the reason they were put upon this Earth!
 Hhhaaaaa!

The Turban Is Not For Sale
--------------------------

"The Turban is not for sale" refers to a sketch on Late Show with David 
Letterman about a month ago.  Our TV Pal was doing a quiz in which one of 
the answers was "the turban is not for sale."  It wasn't particularly funny 
in and of itself, but Dave remarked (as I recall) that that phrase sounds 
like it might have come from a song somewhere.  Paul chipped in, and over 
the next few seconds they put together the following, sung (approximately) 
to the tune of "Three Blind Mice":

     The turban is not for sale
     The turban is not for sale
     How many times have I told you guys
     The turban is not for sale!

...and they were so excited by this that they did it numerous times 
throughout the show.

Pea-Boy Theme Song - Copyright (c) 1994 by Marvin Hamlisch
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
(Spoken)
 
A year ago, you asked me to write a song for a special friend, who 
ran onto your show, and stole the hearts of people everywhere.  His 
name...Pea-Boy, and this is his song.
 
Gimme an A!
Gimme a B!
Gimme a... <whistle>

(Sung)
 
Pea-Boy, can't you see, boy,
All the great news that you spread,
Everyone waits, so don't hesitate,
We love it when you aim right at our head!
 
Some think you look funny,
But sonny, that's simply not true!
So if someone's gotta grow up, and be a pea,
 
I don't care as long as it's,
I don't care as long as it's,
I'm glad that it's <oh> that it's you!

	(Thanks John Neuharth)
