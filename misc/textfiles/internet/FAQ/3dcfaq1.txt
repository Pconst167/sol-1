==================================================================
Introduction

    The original motivation for compiling this list was to compare 
    the features of various 3D graphics accelerators becoming available
    for microcomputers.  In particular, I am interested in PCI-based 
    cards which support OpenGL under Windows NT, Linux, Solaris x86
    (none yet!), etc.  and support stereo head mounted displays.
    (In fact, of the currently available boards, only one qualifies.  
     See if you can figure out which one.)

    Information which falls in that category will obviously be more
    complete.  Other information will be included if someone sends it
    to me, but I won't be actively researching it myself.  As such, 
    there is little or no information right now about 3D accelerators for 
    high-end machines such as those produced by SGI, Sun, HP, DEC,
    etc, except as the ones listed may also work in those machines.

==================================================================
Disclaimer
    
    I haven't seen or used many of these cards, and all figures are the
    manufacturers own, as near as I can verify.  I am not promoting
    any one card or company over any other.   Any anecdotes, speed 
    comparisons, etc., that I collect will be included on a purely
    informational level.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Of course, 
    I will not include anything I do not believe or know to be false.
    
    No representation is made as to the accuracy of these
    figures/technical specs.  If you are going to buy/bet the
    farm/otherwise invest in one of these products, CONTACT THE
    MANUFACTURER first and make sure that what you want is what you'll
    get!!!
    
    CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!
    
    All trademarks etc are copyright of their respective owners etc. etc.

    Furthermore, many of these boards are not yet available, so
    you should find out delivery dates before getting your heart set on
    any given one.


====================================================================
Section I: Frequently Asked Questions 
====================================================================

Q01) Are there any 3D graphics accelerators for PCs?

I'm glad you asked.  There are quite a few, with more coming out all
the time.  See the rest of this document for more information.

(Ok, it's a stupid question, but I needed _something_ in the FAQ
section)

Q02) How does the performance of these cards compare to graphics
     workstations such as those produced by SGI, Sun, DEC, etc?

This question is difficult to answer because there are so many factors
affecting the overall 3D performance on a PC.  Most importantly, while
many of the boards listed below have impressive numbers in terms of
maximum number of polygons/second, most only accelerate rendering.
What this means is that you are still bounded by the speed at which
your processor can transform a 3D data stream to a 2D perspective with
lighting and material effects and then ship these numbers over the bus
to the graphics card.  So, the processor, processor speed, bus type
and speed, software design, etc., all effect the final throughput.
Thus, a board may perform differently on two different machines that
have the same "specs" (ie. 90Mhz Pentium, PCI bus) if the bus was
designed differently, or if there are other cards on the bus taking up
bandwidth.  

What is really needed is a set of comprehensive benchmarks that give
some more realistic numbers about the various combinations of
hardware.  The NCGA (National Computer Graphics Association) GPC
(Graphics Performance Committee) (comprised of the major vendors along
with UNC and SDSC) is an organization primarily concerned with
developing benchmark standards and performance characterizations for
graphics hardware.

	Check out:
		http://sunsite.unc.edu/gpc/gpc.html
	for information about the GPC activities.  

Unfortunately, the GPC Quarterly is about $200/year, which is beyond
my budget.  Thus, to get their benchmark results, you'll have to talk
to them.  However, the benchmarking tool they use to measure OpenGL
performance, called Viewperf, is available for free.  From the README
that comes with Viewperf:

    What is this Thing Called 'Viewperf'
    -----------------------------------
    Rob Putney, OPC Vice Chairman
    4/21/95
    
    Viewperf is a portable OpenGL performance benchmark program 
    written in C. It was developed by IBM.  Viewperf provides a vast amount of 
    flexibility in benchmarking OpenGL performance.  At the current time, 
    the program runs on most implementations of UNIX, Windows NT, and OS/2.
    The OpenGL Performance Characterization (OPC) Committee has endorsed 
    Viewperf as its first OpenGL benchmark and results 
    were first published using it in 4Q94 version of The GPC Quarterly.
    
    OPC member companies have ported the Viewperf code to their operating
    system and window environments.  The OPC Committee maintains a single
    source code version of the Viewperf code that is available to the 
    public.

In future versions of this FAQ, performance measurements will be added
in another section at the end.  Stay tuned.  If you have any
measurements using Viewperf, please send them to me (bm@cs.columbia.edu)

Viewperf can currently be obtained from 
	ftp://net1.uspro.fairfax.va.us/pub/gpc/opc/viewperf/
If that directory does not work, try looking on the OpenGL home page at
	http://www.sgi.com/Technology/openGL/opengl.html
which should contain a pointer to ViewPerf.

====================================================================
Section II: 3D Chipsets available now or in the near future.

There are numerous 3D chipsets being worked on, but these 2 happen to
be the ones I have detailed information both on the chips and on
boards built using them.  If I get more information on other chips,
I will include them here.

====================================================================
CS01) 3DLabs GLINT 300SX

First, a comment about the GLINT 300SX chip, which I will make because
it was not clear to me when I first read their specs.  They mention
texture mapping acceleration, but on the 300SX texture maps are held
in host memory and per pixel information is sent to the chip which
performs the necessary interpolations and applications. For the
upcoming 300TX, the texture maps are held in local memory on the
graphics card (the "localbuffer") and the host just sends per vertex
information to the chip which performs all the texture mapping
calculations.

Information on the 300SX can be obtained from the 3DLabs home page at 
	http://www.3Dlabs.com/3Dlabs/
or by sending email to info@3Dlabs.com.

The technical specs below were copied directly from the page
	http://www.3Dlabs.com/3Dlabs/300SXinf.html

GLINT 300SX Overview

The GLINT 300SX high performance graphics processor combines workstation
class 3D graphics acceleration and state-of-the-art 2D performance
in a single chip.

GLINT is capable of processing 300,000 shaded, depth buffered
and anti-aliased polygons/second. The chip provides complete 32-bit
color, 2D and 3D acceleration, an on-chip PCI-compliant local
bus interface and integrated LUT-DAC control, making a complete
graphics subsystem possible with minimal chip count.

All the rendering operations of OpenGL are accelerated by the
GLINT 300SX, including Gouraud shading, depth buffering, anti-aliasing,
alpha blending, and texture mapping.

3D ACCELERATION

	o 100% OpenGL compliant rendering operations in hardware
	o Point, line, rectangle and polygon primitives
	o Gouraud shading, depth buffering, anti-aliasing, dithering,
	  depth cueing, texture map filtering and alpha blending
	o 2.5 Giga operations per second
	o 300K Gouraud shaded, depth buffered triangles/sec

2D AND GUI ACCELERATION

	o True color acceleration of window systems such as Win32 and
	  X11
	o Accelerated bitBLT, line drawing, fills, text and window clipping

SPECIAL FEATURES

	o 64-bit hyper-pipelined architecture
	o Vertex level interface
	o 112-bit pixel datapath to memory
	o High quality 16 and 8-bpp dithering of 24-bit graphics images
	o Fast frame and depth buffer clears
	o Shared framebuffer interface for easy multimedia integration
	o VRAM block fill and bit masking
	o Anti-aliasing for high quality images at 4x4 and 8x8 sub-pixel
	  resolution

DISPLAY MODES

	o Resolutions up to 2560x2048
	o 8, 16 or 32-bits per pixel RGBA and 4 or 8-bit color indexed
	o Packed 8, 16 and 32-bit pixels
	o Supports advanced modes: double buffering, stereo and overlays

GLINT 300SX Graphics Architecture

The GLINT 300SX delivers 3D and GUI rendering functionality to
improve the performance and quality of graphics applications and
APIs.

	o Gouraud shading
	o Depth buffering
	o Anti-aliasing
	o Dithering
	o Depth cueing and fog
	o Texture mapping
	o Scissor and stipple masking
	o Alpha blending
	o Logical Operations (e.g. XOR)

The unique hyper-pipelined architecture and 112-bit memory datapath
ensure that multiple rendering operations can be combined with
no performance penalty - allowing a Gouraud shaded polygon to
be processed just as fast when depth buffering, dithering and
anti-aliasing are enabled.

FRAMEBUFFER CONTROLLER

The 64/32-bit framebuffer controller directly interfaces to VRAM
or DRAM framebuffers and supports a wide range of pixel depths,
resolutions and memory sizes - enabling systems to be tuned to
meet specific price/performance targets.

	O 1-32 MBytes VRAM or DRAM
	O 8,16 or 32-bit RGBA color
	O 4 or 8-bit color indexed
	O 2, 4, 8 pixels per 64-bit word
	O 640x480 to 2560x2048
	O VRAM arbitrary shape block fill
	O VRAM bit masking
	O Framebuffer bypass mode

LOCALBUFFER CONTROLLER

The localbuffer holds optional off-screen information for
each pixel including; depth (Z) values, stencil data, arbitrary
window clip planes, plus a control field for fast window clearing.
The format for each field is user defined, up to a maximum of
48 bits. 

	O 0-48 MBytes DRAM
	O 0-48-bits wide
		Depth: 0, 16, 24, 32-bit
		Stencil: 0, 4, 8-bit
		Window clipping: 0, 4-bit
		Fast depth clear: 4, 8-bit
	O Localbuffer bypass mode for direct access by external devices

INTEGRATED VIDEO TIMING

An internal timing generator and VRAM transfer controller
are incorporated into the GLINT 300SX processor. Advanced systems
requiring overlays, stereo, interlace or very large framebuffers
can be supported using an external timing generator.

SHARED FRAMEBUFFER

The GLINT 300SX's on-chip shared framebuffer interface is
a fully integrated implementation of S3's interface, allowing
GLINT to use video and multimedia co-processors, or for the GLINT
to be used as a 3D coprocessor to an S3 device.

UPGRADE PATH

The GLINT 300SX is the first of a family of GLINT graphics
processors that are designed to meet the demands of the graphics
designer. The GLINT300TX, is a second generation pin compatible
processor that enhances the SX's texture capabilities - supporting
local texture storage and pixel address generation for all OpenGL
texturing modes.

NOTICE: 3Dlabs reserves the right to change the above specifications
	without notice.

From looking at the various boards, it appears that typical
performance quotes are in the following range:

	3D Gouraud shaded, depth buffered, window clipped, stippled,
		dithered, and alpha tested rendering performance with
		24-bit RGB color depth is the following:
		300K 25 pixel triangles/sec
		500K 10 pixel vectors/sec
		8M independent points/second
		500K 9x13 pixels characters/second
	2D Graphics performance
		1M 10 pixel vectors/sec
		500K 10x10 pixel, flat shaded rectangles/sec
		500K 9x13 pixels characters/second
		Scroll Rate 48M pixels/second - 8 bits/pixel

CS02) Lockheed Martin Real3D

Information on the Lockheed Martin Read3D chipset was obtained from
their WWW server at the following URL:
	http://www.mmc.com/real3d/
Check there for more information, or call 1-800-393-7730, or send
email to real3d@mmc.com

The following is taken from a press release found at that site:

The REAL3D(tm) chipset is based on real-time computer image generation
technology that gives a combination of dynamic response and realism
previously available only on dedicated graphics workstations and high
end custom image generators.

The first product will be the R3D/100 graphics accelerator.  Key
performance attributes of the new chip set include an embedded 100
MFLOPS geometry processor, pixel write rates of up to 33 million
pixels per second, up to 750,000 polygons per second, line processing
up to 1.5 million per second, and provides up to 192 color texture
maps (128 x 128 mipmapped) in real-time.

The new product is an outgrowth of Lockheed Martin's proprietary
computer graphics technology previously used in high performance
military simulation, engineering research and training applications
first developed for astronaut training and military flight
simulators. 

The chip set provides faster processing through its patented hardware
design which incorporates geometry processing, rasterization and
texture mapping. The R3D/100 embedded floating point geometry
processor removes significant processing burden from the host CPU. The
patented texture processor applies color mipmapped texture to polygons
in true 3D corrected perspective.

Designed as a true polygon processor with texture processing and
scaleable texture memory from the outset, the R3D/100 chip set
includes dedicated hardware acceleration of mipmapped texturing that
provides continuous high fidelity image quality. This chip set
simulates spotlights, fog and realistic curved surfaces. Additionally,
improved image quality is provided with multi-pass anti-aliasing.

The R3D/100 chip set directly interfaces with Microsoft 3D/DDI and
supports all 3D/DDI-compliant APIs, such as OpenGL(tm) and comes with
device driver software and a device driver kit.

====================================================================
CS03) S-MOS SPC1500 3D Graphics Geometry Processor

S-MOS Systems is offering the industry's first commercially
available single chip 3D geometry accelerator for the PC marketplace.

The SPC1500 will work together with any 3D rendering processors to
accelerate 3D graphics up to 300K+ lighted triangles per second.

Why is geometry processing acceleration important?

Rendering processors alone, even on Pentium class machines, can not
deliver true workstation class performance. This is because even the
fastest CPUs today are quickly overcome by the amount of algorithmic
processing necessary to transform a 3D data stream to a 2D perspective
with lighting and material effects.

The SPC1500 integrates a 150Mflop dual floating point engine, an
on-chip DMA processor, on-chip ROM to store the algorithm instruction
set, and an on-chip RAM cache to store customer instructions in a
single 223 pin PGA package.

Easy integration

S-MOS Systems provides a complete design package for the system
integrator and board vendor.....

PCI Reference Designs

S-MOS Systems provides reference designs and evaluation kits showing
the capabilities of the SPC1500 running OpenGL on the WindowsNT
platform. Full technical manuals, electronic gerber files, and
applications notes are available.

Full Software Support

WindowsNT and OS/2 Support

S-MOS Systems provides OpenGL compliant software and system utilities
for the WindowsNT platform. This software supports any rendering board
(2D or 3D) that supports 3D DDI. It will also supports direct data
transfer to the leading 3D rendering board vendors.

MacOS Support

S-MOS Systems will will support software drivers and system utilities
for Quickdraw3D.

An Acrobat version of the SPC1500 Datasheet is available via their page at
	http://www.smos.com/standard/spc1500.htm

COMMENTS:
From Blair MacIntyre:

"Looks pretty good.  I'd choose this over a GLINT based board that
doesn't have the S3 chip on it.   It will be out in late June, early
July: they say are redesigning it to increase the performance (both they
and someone at 3DLabs said they are hoping to increase performance by
30%)."

The 3DMedia SR is a true high performance 3D accelerator based on the
3DLabs GLINT 300SX chip.  

The 3DMedia SX provides the same features as the SR, plus additional
features such as genlocking to eliminate annoying scrolling bars due
to magnetic interference between two monitors in a dual-headed
configuration.  Furthermore, in provides an on-board studio quality
encoder which outputs video in NTSC, PAL or S-Video formats.

From Chris Hinch (chris@dcc.govt.nz):

"Contact these people and ask for the glossy brochure - WOW!!!!  (ok,
 so I'm not being objective...I like poring over glossy brochures as
 much as the next person...*grin*)

 Their staff were also really helpful and responsive.

 Apparently, application notes will be available in August of this
 year, with sample chipsets and reference boards available in November.
 Production quantities will be available in the first quarter of 1996.
 Price for the reference board is in the US$2,800 area."
