         The Rolling Stones, unlike the Beatles, seem to have had few
         even half-decent authors or publishers produce books about
         them.  The majority of the books on this list are, frankly,
         not too good.  A few (Stone Alone, etc) are imperative!

         Read this list, and the books, with low expectations!

         Part one of the FAQ list has recommendations on the five best
         books (in print and out).

                      -------/////00000\\\\\------

         This list has been constructed with help from many people, to
         whom many thanks.

         Among them are : D.H., Tony Rzepela, Bruce Dumes, and
         several others who, if they email me will be duly credited!
         Whoops, lost my earlier list!

         I am happy to receive email comments about errors in this
         list, and information about books that are not on it.

         Like the Stones, I'm a Brit, so are most of the ISBN's.             

         Citations list author, title, year, and finally, ISBN.

         Granta is a quarterly book/magazine of 'New English Writing'
         Issue 12 consists largely of an extensive extract from      
         Stanley Booth's "True Adventures of the Rolling Stones"

 64                                          
         Date unclear, but precedes the Rolling Stones Monthly from  
         the same publishers.  Nice photos - a real period piece.    
         Even has a bit about 'The Official Rolling Stones Fan Club' 
         93/97 Regent St.  Now, whatever became of that!?

         Monthly magazine from the original publishers of both the   
         Beatles and Rolling Stones Monthly Magazines.  The issues   
         that have special features on the Stones are worth getting.

         Inevitably the Stones and their circle appear.

         Wonderful period piece that asserts it is 'as we told it to 
         Pete Goodman'.                                              
                                                                     
         Written for mass consumption at the start of the band's     
         career.

 64                                          
         A very early period piece - 12 small photo's of the band    
         in a concertina fold out style.  The text is superbly dated,
         and very wrong in places.  "The lads got their name for the 
         group from a Chuck Berry song 'The Rolling Stones'".

 64                                          
         Short lived (30 issues) monthly 'Official Rolling Stones    
         Book edited by the Stones for their Fans' from the same     
         stable as the still running Beatles Monthly.                
                                                                     
         Despite the fact that it is mostly the product of the       
         imagination of a press/publicity crew it is worth getting   
         if you ever (unlikely) see it.  Re-issue long overdue.

         A 64 page rush through the music of the turbulent 60's.     
         Produced by Marks & Spencer, so quality is good.  Nothing   
         profound, only a bit on the Stones.

         Well indexed and and as thoroughly researched as a book     
         without 'official' backing could be.  Although it is        
         extensive and thorough, sources close to the band dismiss   
         this book as dreadfully inaccurate.                         
                                                                     
         An obvious need exists for an authorized version.

         Reasonably good biography of the life and death of Brian.   
         Good photo's, and research are spoiled by the author's      
         uncritical approach to Brian.

         Excellent book.  Despite being so big that it is hernia     
         inducing.  Superb photo selection, reproduced with great    
         clarity.  The text (not matching the photo's) should be     
         read as a series of essays (with flaws).  Photo's arranged  
         (seemingly) randomly - but some great ones!                 
                                                                     
         Grab this book!

 Keith Richards : The Biography                              
 92 0091743974                               

         In a field where few serious biographies exist, any gallant 
         attempt should be welcomed. But..                           
                                                                     
         This book suffers from poor editing, from the (bizarre IMHO)
         view that much of the success of the Stones stems from the  
         homo-erotic relationship of Jagger/Richards/Jones.  Later   
         parts read as slick cuttings jobs.  I'm glad my copy was a  
         half price remainder!

         Chronologically arranged list of hi-lights and low spots    
         from the first 30 years.                                    
                                                                     
         Nice photo's, but the number of entries ensures a generally 
         shallow approach.  The early years (62/3) are better than   
         most books - but still flawed.

         In 1969 Stanley Booth was granted the rights to put together
         a book about the Stones.  16 years later it came out.  An   
         entertaining read, full of racy tales and the like - both   
         from the Stone and from the author.

         A book of Michael Cooper's photo's, with a foreword (and    
         comments by Keef) could hardly fail.  This one nearly does. 
                                                                     
         Illegible text, poor printing of ace photo's, and even some

         about The Stones.  Extremely difficult to find.

         Long account of Chet's years on the road thru 75, 78 and 79 
         with the Stones.  Worthwhile thoughts on the Stones - at    
         times thought-provoking, at times funny, as well as accurate
         reportage of life in the big league.

         This book, an essential part of any book collection, charts 
         the evolution of various groups.                            
                                                                     
         The Stones are shown linked to the Pretty Things (by Dick   
         Taylor) and tenuously to The Kinks.

         Essential reading for any serious student of UK rock music, 
         which of course dominates the world.  Lots of short (often  
         witty) paragraphs about rock's famous places the length and 
         breadth of the land.

 90 1852830816                               

         This 'official' photographic record of the tour is very     
         disappointing.  The unique access by chosen photographers   
         could have and should have produced a better (in every way) 
         book.                                                       
                                                                     
         The photos should all have been dated and the location      
         noted.

         A slim book of photo's of..um... the 1968 One Plus One      
         sessions.                                                   
                                                                     
         Overpriced, but still nice as the photos seem to capture

         Less than readable account that draws upon interviews with

         together out of context results in a book with little value.

         This book details the Stage Set designs of Fisher Park - the

         No original text, but a book of lists  of books, newspaper  
         articles, magazines, and file reviews. Ambitious but flawed 
         by the fact that the earliest reference is May 1963 - almost
         a year after the first one.  Dreadful typeface makes this   
         book very hard to use.                                      
                                                                     
         An honorable attempt at an impossible task.  A must for all

         A less than useful bio of Mick.  Everone has a different

         Text tells you nothing new, but the photos are good - often

         Linda got her Big Career Break by taking photo's of the     
         Stones in New York in 1966.  Nice photo's, nicely printed   
         and presented.  Overpriced book.

         An ESSENTIAL book for all Stones fans.  An excellent listing
         of the band's records up to 1980 (and thus in need of a new 
         edition).                                                   
                                                                     
         Few books on this list are mandatory, this is one!

         Even if it is a pretty obvious cash-in on the Voodoo Lounge 
         tour hype, it is an excellent book of well printed and      
         presented photo's and 'diary' entries.                      
                                                                     
         What I'd expect from Miles.

         A large format photo book, short on text.  Given that Norman
         has written first class books about both the Stones and the 
         Fabs, one has to wonder what the point is.

         Pete Townshend writes "It's a good thing that a writer of   
         Philip Norman's class has finally produced a book on The    
         Stones".                                                    
                                                                     
         Agreed.  Even if this is flawed, and I don't know if it     
         really is, too many of the Stones books are very lightweight
         and it is a pleasant change to have one that is actually    
         serious and thorough.

         The re-issued boxed set of Singles (CD et.al.) has an OK    
         book of notes.  Useful notes, more useful for all of the    
         words of the songs and the notes about the singles.

         A book of fantasy drawings of The Great Stars in likely and 
         unlikely situations.  The Stones are (rather strangely)     
         illustrated.                                                
                                                                     
         It is said that Jagger was so impressed that this was the   
         reason why Peellaert was commissioned to do the cover for

         A book of very good photo's from the Legendary show.  Sadly 
         and avoidably flawed by presenting many of the photos as    
         double page spreads, and then needing to break the book to  
         see them.

         Any history of any group can only be helped by a study of   
         their Concert Programmes.  As the years have passed these   
         have progressed from small quick throw-away jobs, to lavish 
         well produced (and expensive) souvenirs.

         A distressingly beautiful book, full of upsettingly unique  
         photos at a heart-stopping price.                           
                                                                     
         Cooper was the 'court' photographer to the Beatles (he did  
         the Sgt. Pepper cover photo) and the Stones (Satanic        
         Majesties) and others.  As such these photos are unique.

         Many good photo's of the Stones and other bands,

         'Spanish' Tony's account of several years wheeling and      
         dealing with the Stones (mainly Keith).  An interesting read
         because even if 99% is grossly inflated it gives a flavour  
         of what life was like with the band during the late 60's to 
         early 70's.

         was written by The Man himself and was reportedly cut down  
         from 300,000 words.

This discography 


1) lists the Rolling Stones' original long-play and EP releases issued 
   in the UK or United States, sorted by release date.   

2) discusses the Rolling Stones on Compact Disc (search forward
   for the text "CDs, CDs, CDs").

3) lists songs that were officially sanctioned and available at 
   some point, but never made it to any EP or LP in the States or UK 
   (search forward for "Flipsides and Oddities"). 


Concerning Part one: 

  Those DECCA LP releases of the 60s which were unique to the UK, 
  in either title or configuration, are underlined in Eastward-pointing 
  arrows: ">>>>>>>>>>>>>>>"

  Those London LP releases which were unique to the US, in either 
  title or configuration, use Westward-pointing arrows: "<<<<<<<<<<<<<"

  From "Their Satanic Majesties' Request" on, the British and American 
  releases of previously unreleased material on LPs were congruent, with 
  the exception of "Metamorphosis" (1975). 

  We have declined to catalogue out-of-print compilations that began 
  appearing in Europe in the seventies.  While they filled important 
  gaps in European collections at the time they were released, the fact 
  is that with only a few exceptions, any track that was on those records 
  is now available somewhere on Compact Disc, small variations of 
  individual song versions notwithstanding. 

  (
  Exceptions: 
  * 2 tracks (plus an intro) from the 1965 UK EP "Got LIVE if you want it!"   
  * 6 tracks released on "Rest of the Best", a 1984 German box set
  )

  We have also declined, at this point in time, to catalogue those small 
  variations on the same track between different LP releases. While some 
  variations are indeed significant, and some versions still have not 
  appeared on a legitimate Compact Disc in any country, we feel the following 
  document, correct if not comprehensive, is still a useful resource. 
                                             
  Compilations stay on the list as long as they either stay in print, or 
  offer something found on no other EP or LP.

         Rocks"); but correct, long version of "Out of Time" (5:36) is not
         a US release at all. Both versions of this release are on CD.

      ========================     CDs, CDs, CDs    =========================

    Who issues them? 

      At any one time, legitimate CDs from the Rolling Stones (i.e., CDs
      the Rolling Stones WANT to release, and not the "Official
      Unauthorized" variety of CDs widely issued in Europe over the last
      several years, often including live concerts and out takes) are
      issued by only two companies:  

          ABKCO (owned by Allen Klein, who has rights to all Rolling Stones  
                 recordings originally issued up to and including 1970, and 
                 the rights to all Rolling Stones compositions up to and 
                 including 1971's "Sticky Fingers") and its subcontractors 
                 (typically, "London" records, which is the label on which 
                 American versions of Stones recordings were issued in the 
                 1960s).
        or
          "The Rolling Stones" (which owns all of the band's post-1970  
                 recordings) and its subcontractors. (As of this writing, 
                 this would be Virgin Records, which was sold to EMI after 
                 the Rolling Stones signed with Virgin in 1992.) 

      Since "The Rolling Stones" own all of their post-1970 "recordings",
      what they can do is license them for release on their current label,
      whatever it may be, and take the recordings with them when the
      record company contract expires.  This would explain the variety of
      companies you may see issuing post-1970 CDs by the Rolling Stones in
      your local used CD store (although American Stones CDs from this era
      were, up until 1993, and with only one WEA exception, issued only by
      Sony/CBS, who signed the Rolling Stones worldwide in 1984. One may
      also see European or Japanese CDs from this era issued by EMI, the
      Rolling Stones' label in much of the  world from 1977 to 1984.)

      *Whew!*


    When did they come out? 

      The first Rolling Stones CD ever issued was 'Undercover', in Europe 
      by EMI in 1983.  In the States, it is "Still Life", mistakenly
      released in 1984 by WEA, the Stones' American label at the time. 
      American CDs did not officially appear until 1986, when Sony/CBS
      started issuing them, and ABKCO began unleashing its cache in the 
      States as it had been doing since 1984 in Europe.
                                                        
    What are they like? 
             
      The release of CDs did not freeze in stone (heh heh) any particular
      version of a song, or album, or Stones recording career overview. 

      Indeed, it exacerbated a long-standing problem where different
      issues of a Stones album have literally different tracks on them, as
      was the case in the early 60s, or where discernibly different
      versions of a single song may be on different issues of an album, a
      situation which went on for close to 20 years, happening as late as
      1983 with the release of 'Undercover', and its two distinct versions
      of "Wanna Hold You".  Even when a CD has two different versions (as
      in the interesting case of "More Hot Rocks"), it may still mean that
      a particular version of a song can only be found on old vinyl. 

      (some examples include: 

      * a version of "Poison Ivy" found only on the
        vinyl release of "More Hot Rocks", 
      * a version of "Tell Me" found only on the earliest pressings of 
        the first Rolling Stones album, 
      * a version of "2120 South Michigan Avenue" found only on the 
        compilation _Around and Around_, 
      * the "original" live recording of "Under My Thumb" which did not 
        make it to the CD remaster of the "Got LIVE if you Want it!" album, 
      
      and on and on......)


      Other, more esoteric issues also exist: true (i.e., channel-separated)  
      stereo vs. electronically processed stereo versions of songs; and  
      multiple (as many as four) distinct versions of a single song existing  
      officially with absolute changes, such as a missing guitar solo, organ,
      percussion track, or verse. Many of the American ABKCO CDs 
      are considered inferior to their European counterparts due to a lack of  
      careful mastering. Many of the tracks which people find preferable on  
      European ABKCO CDs were remastered by Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs for a
      1984 box set. This box reissued the Stones' London Records catalogue on 
      vinyl in the States in 1984, the same year the ABKCO CDs began 
      appearing in Europe.

   What do I need minimally for a "complete" Rolling Stones collection 
   on CD?

      As it stands now, there is no way to have a complete Rolling
      Stones' collection without having at least some old vinyl records.
      
      As this applies to ABKCO, there are 22 song _titles_ never 
      issued on CD at all, and several previously released and available 
      _versions_ of other titles yet to see the light of laser.

      As it applies to Rolling Stones Records, there are three or
      four (depending on your attitude towards flexi-discs) _titles_
      still not released on CD.  In addition, there are more than a 
      dozen promo/mono edits and dance remixes which are not on CD.

      The ABKCO years:

      When wondering "which version" of an ABKCO CD to buy, consider 
      recommendations on sound quality from friends, and remember, 
      if you are trying to get a "complete" (i.e. as complete as it 
      can be on CD) collection of CD _versions_, no collection which 
      does not mix CDs of "UK" and "US" versions will do it for you, 
      as a five-minute-plus version of "Out of Time" is only on the 
      UK-format "Aftermath", and true stereo versions of several
      early tracks never came out in the States on disc. 

      Buying "all American" on ABKCO CDs will give you a complete 
      collection of CD-available _titles_, but you have to buy 
      them _all_ (including the 3-disc "London Years" box), and can only 
      leave out "Hot Rocks (1964-1971)" and the two single-disc 
      "Big Hits" compilations. 

      After all this, you still will not have the six vinyl-only tracks 
      which were released in Germany ("I've been Loving You Too Long 
      (studio)", "Con le Mie Lacrime", "Tell Me Baby, How Many More 
      Times", "Memphis Tennessee", "Da Doo Ron Ron" or "Cocksucker
      Blues"), the first three tracks from the 1965 EP "Got Live if 
      You Want it!" (although one of them is just a chant called 
      "We Want the Stones.") or the 12 tracks from the UK version 
      of the 1975 compilation _Metamorphosis_ which never made it 
      to the _London Years_ box, the only CD source of ANY tracks from 
      _Metamorphosis_.


      A CD collector trying to get a complete set of CD-available _titles_ 
      _must_ include some discs whose track listings are based on American 
      LP track listings, as several US titles (esp. "December's Children") 
      have tracks which never appeared in a DECCA/UK-format LP except on 
      long-out-of-print vinyl compilations.

      The post-ABKCO years: 

      Certain later (post-1970) albums were notoriously mistreated in their 
      switch to digital, and with the advent of 20-bit mastering
      technology, Virgin Records reissued 20-bit remasters of the
      Rolling Stones' studio output from "Sticky Fingers" (1971) to
      "Steel Wheels" (1989), with eight of these titles available in 
      limited edition commemmorative packaging, in June 1994.

      Some people report (trivially) longer fades on some of the tracks 
      on these Virgin remasters, raising the spectre of "different versions" 
      all over again, and forcing one to track down CBS-issue CDs in 
      order to have a complete set of CD _versions_. 

      At this point, the future on CD of compilations and live albums 
      originally issued by "Rolling Stones Records" from 1975 to 1991 (all
      of which were reissued on CD after 1984) is up in the air.  This is 
      six titles in all, four of which have material which can't be culled 
      from other currently available CD sources. 
   
      About two dozen post-ABKCO tracks have never been issued on CD, 
      although only four of them ("Let it Rock", "Exile on Main Street
      Blues", "Through the Lonely Nights", and "Think I'm Going Mad") 
      are actual separate performances. For the most part, these 
      non-Digitized tracks are 12" "dance" remixes, or mono/promo edits, 
      and are of varying value.

    Rolling Stones for public consumption, but have yet to appear on any
    LP or compilation released in the States or the UK.

1971   "Let It Rock"    - third track on UK "Brown Sugar" single
                        - Spanish version of "Sticky Fingers" LP, replacing

                        flipside to "She Was Hot" 45

1990  The "Flashpoint" sides. A number of live performances
      recorded on the 1989-1990 tours were used as flipsides
      to singles pulled off "Flashpoint". These include:

      "2000 Light Years from Home"      (Highwire   US7", UK CD single "A")
      "Undercover of the Night"         (Sexdrive   US7",

      "Harlem Shuffle"                  (Ruby Tuesday     UK CD single "B")

      This list does not pretend to exhaust your methods of getting
      the tracks, it just offers suggestions for finding them.
     
1993  "Gimme Shelter (live)" - (cassette only, UK only) - 
             issued as part of a benefit project for the homeless in 
             1993, in which various artists cover the song, the Stones' 
             contribution was a live, "Urban Wheels" version. This
             version does appear on a CD, but it is the Promo. 

1994  "The Storm" (Flipside of "Love Is Strong" - found on US 
             cassette and CD single, and European CD VSCDT1503)

1994  "So Young" (Found on European CD listed immediately above.)

1980-1994  The "remixes".  While the Collectibles CD includes
      one remix each of several popular songs, some persist that
      have never been released on any collection:

      "Undercover (Extended)"            (Undercover     12")
      "Feel On Baby (Instrumental)"      (""             " ")

           Michael Brauer Mix)
      "Terrifying (remix)"               (Terrifying     12")
      "Sexdrive" (Club Mix,Dirty Hands Mix)

      "Love Is Strong" (Bob Clearmountain Mix)
                                         (4th track on European

      "Love Is Strong" (Joe the Butcher club mix, plus 
                        5 Teddy Riley mixes - radio, extended,
                        extended rock, dub, & instrumental)
                                         (UK CD VSCDX1503)


1971-1990  The "promos".  Released to radio stations and DJ pools, 
      promotional singles will often include a version of a record that
      is more amenable to commercial airplay or dance club use, by virtue 
      of cleaned-up language, a different running time, or a hotter mix 
      more friendly to the intended arena (radio play or dance clubs).

      Many promos exist for the Rolling Stones where one side is "Mono"
      and the other is "Stereo", but here we catalogue records that 
      were more substantially altered:  

      "Wild Horses"  (shorter version)               (Promo           7")
      "It's Only Rock 'n' Roll"  (shorter)           (Promo           7")
      "Before They make Me Run"                      (Promo           7")
      "Shattered" (clocks in under 3 minutes!!)      (Promo           7")
      "Emotional Rescue"                             (Promo           7")
      "She's So Cold" ('clean' - no 'God damn cold') (Promo           7")
      "If I was a Dancer (Instrumental)"             (Promo          12")
      "Waiting On a Friend" (more than a minute off) (Promo           7")
      "Undercover"                                   (Promo           7")
      "Sexdrive" (edited Club version)               (US Promo       12")
