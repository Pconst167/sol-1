1. WHAT IS "BOTTOM"?

    _______________________
    1.1 General Description

"Bottom" is a half-hour British comedy program staring Adrian Edmondson (as
Eddie Hitler) and Rik Mayall (as Richard Richard). It's also written by
Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall. It's centered on the lives of two
down-and-out ne'er-do-wells who are on the dole. In other words, two people
who are at the bottom of the social scale, financially, socially, and
otherwise.

Bottom primarily depends on, but is not limited to, slap-stick humor. The
violence is of the "Tom-and-Jerry" variety, with little or no consequences
in terms of harm to the characters.  Most of the violence doesn't have much
of an effect on the character's well-being, but if there are any
consequences, they are greatly exaggerated for comic effect. The sound
effects are also exaggerated, and add to the "cartoonish" style of the
show.

Surprisingly, one can relate to alot of the scenarios its one-diminsional
characters go through. For instance, Eddie and Richie are 1) poor, 2)
socially inept, 3) drifting along with no job prospects, 4) bachelors who
will probably never have a long-term (or short-term) intimate relationship.
Who has not experienced at least one of these at some point in their lives?
I myself qualify for three...but watching Bottom somehow always cheers me
up. :)

Most of the scenes take place in their filthy low-rent apartment. The
kitchen is completely foul. Kitsch articles (like a framed picture of Elvis
Presley) adorn the apartment. Occasionally, the plot will take the
characters outside their flat, into the English "country," for instance, to
the local pub, or to a pawn-broker's.

    ________________________________
    1.2 How many episodes were made?

There are 2 seasons of 6 episodes each. The names and order of the episodes
are as follows:

       ______________
Smells               |
Gas                  |
Contest               ----> 1st Season   
Apocalypse           |
'S Up                |
Accident ____________|
       ______________
Digger               |
Culture              |
Burglary             |
Parade                ----> 2nd Season
Holy                 |
'S Out ______________|

Jon Morris <jdm93ma@soton.ac.uk> informs me:

"...'s Out' has never been shown on British TV. It has, however, been
released on video, as have all the other episodes...At the time (it was
about November) there was some murder or attack on Wimbledon Common. This
episode was set on the same heath so the BBC thought it would be in bad
taste to show it. However, they didn't show it when they repeated the
second season either."

On the back of a poster for the Bottom Live! stageshow, a full transcript
is written with the acknowledgement that the murder, which took place the
week before the scheduled transmission, was indeed why 'S Out was never
broadcast.

    ______________________
    1.3 Who's in the cast?

2.0 A LITTLE HISTORY...

    _________________
    2.1 Press Release

The following is a press release for the stage show.

Press release for BOTTOM - the Stage show
=========================================

RIK MAYALL and ADRIAN EDMONDSON star in a full stage play based on the award
winning BBC2 TV series. With their own inimitable wit, style and sense of
the ridiculous they transport you to the explosively insane world of two of
society's most catastrophic no-hopers...

RICHIE and EDDIE are two of life's losers; two pimples on life's bottom.
Surviving on a diet of vitriol, mutually inflicted wounds and pornographic
magazines, they belch, curse and smash their way through the boredom of
life. The effects are disastrous!

EDDIE
=====
He's the sort of person you cross the road to avoid. He likes life's simple
pleasures: a visit to the bookies, cheating Richie out of anything he can
(including the rent) and then breaking his legs on his birthday. If there's
any way he can score, whether it s money, girls or an advantage over
Richie, he'll do it.

RICHIE
======
He seems nice, well in a smarmy, oozing and oily-tongued way that you
realize isn't really nice at all. His problem is sex: he thinks the "Karma
Sutra" is an Indian restaurant. Sex is something which happens to other
people and they won't even let him watch.

Tickets cost 8.50-13.50/Promoted by Phil Mclntyre Promotions.

(NOTE: Bottom, the Stage Show, was filmed at Southampton Mayflower Theatre
in 1993)

Adam Davies also was kind enough to furnish the following:

-Born: January 24, 1957
-Father taught abroad for the Forces
-Lived abroad until age 12, then went to a British boarding school
-Attended Manchester University in the same year as Rik Mayall, got a 2-1
 degree in drama

Adrian Edmondson trained in studio drama at Manchester Univeristy, where he
met Rik Mayall and formed the partnership that was to become Twentieth
Century Coyote. In 1977 he took a one-man show to the National Student
Drama Festival, and Twentieth Century Coyote appeared at the Edinburgh
Festival to great critical acclaim and media interest; the show was
recorded for Radio 4.

After Edinburgh came a period of touring with various two-man shows
throughout Britain, until Adrian joined the number of talented artists then
appearing at London's comedy Store. Throughout 1970 and 1980, Adrian made
numberous appearances on the growing comedy circuit before going on to
co-found The Comic Strip at the Boulevard Theatre in late 1980.

After their hugely successful premiere at the Boulevard, The Comic Strip
made an album and a short film in the summer of 1981 and set out on a
national tour in September. In 1982 they toured Australia, including a
two-week season at the Adelaide Festival of the Arts.

Adrian co-starred with Alison Steadman in News Hounds, directed by Les
Blair for Working Title and BBC TV. This won the British Academy of Film
and Television Arts Award for Best Single Television Drama of 1990. Later
that year, Adrian starred as Brad in Robin Lefevre's West End revival of
the cult movie The Rocky Horror Picture Show at the Piccadilly Theatre.

Adrian wrote Consuela and Mr. Jolly Lives Next Door (the latter with Rik
Mayall and Rowland Rivron), both of which were directed by Stephen Frears.

He has also directed several successful pop videos including a
controversial "Prime Mover" for Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction;
"Hourglass" "Trust Me to Open My Mouth" and "853-5937" for Squeeze; The
Pogue's "Fiesta"; and 10,000 Maniac's "Like the Weather."

    2.4 The Comic Strip Presents

The Comic Strip gets its name from a revue of the same name. It ran from
October 1980 to July 1981 and starred the regulars that appear in the TV
Comic Strip films: Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Miranda Richardson,
Nigel Planer, Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson, and Alexei Sayle.

There is a newly revamped episode guide compiled by Michael Shephard
<michaels@jake.chem.unsw.EDU.AU>. It can be obtained via ftp:

dir:/media/tv/collections/tardis/uk/comedy/

    _________________
    2.5 Private Life?

I have it on good authority that that's strictly private. However, it seems
this FAQ wouldn't be complete if it wasn't mentioned that Adrian Edmondson
is married to comedian/writer Jennifer Saunders, who was also in the Comic
Strip ensemble, is 1/2 of the 'French and Saunders' comedy team, co-stars
and writes the t.v. show 'Absolutely Fabulous,' and probably deserves an
FAQ herself!

Rik Mayall was once involved with Lise Meyer around the time of 'The Young
Ones.' Meyer wrote the show with Rik and Ben Elton, and is a force on the
comedy scene in England in her own right.

Michelle T. Street <mtstreet@firefly.prairienet.org> tells me:

"If I remember correctly...Rik's wife is named Barbara - both she and Lise
Mayer were pregnant with Rik's child at the same time! Lise ended up
miscarrying and Rik now has two or three kids...Lise...has had affairs with
Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Laurie, and a slew of other comics."

3. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

    ___________________________
    3.1 What is Emmerdale Farm?

"MAD Mosher" <I.R.Purdie@bradford.ac.uk> described this Brit TV show to me:

"'Emmerdale Farm" is a weekday soap opera about life in the Yorkshire
Moors. Its based around the aforementioned farm, some village, and a pub
called the Woolpack. Typical UK cr*p, to be honest...I think that's why
it's parodied in 'Bottom'!"

Jerry Kohl <pnm@u.washington.edu> writes:

"Known since 1990 simply as 'Emmerdale.' It's a twice-a-week evening soap,
generally ranking third among soaps in the UK, after 'Coronation Street'
and 'East Enders.' Whether it's 'typical UK cr*p' or not is a matter of
opinion..."

    _________________________
    3.2 Who is Sue Carpenter?

James Kew <j.kew@ic.ac.uk> comments "She's a rather second-rate newsreader;
the joke is that R & E are infatuated by these kind of 'fantasy' characters
because...they're too sad to meet women in real life."

Thanks James. I can't relate to that _at all_. :D

    ___________________________
    3.3 Who is Felicity Kendal?

Jerry Kohl <pnm@u.washington.edu> writes "She's well known for her stage
work, but has done a fair amount of television as well...(The Good Life) is
generally regarded as one of the three or four all-time best comedies ever
made for British TV. Kendal and Briers played Barbara and Tom Good (hence
the title), who decide to drop out of the rat-race and try self-sufficiency
farming in the London suburb of Surbiton."

James Kew adds: "Felicity had (and still has) a sort of 'thinking-man's
crumpet' appeal."

Adrian Myers <adrian@isltd.insignia.com> notes: "To help understand Ms.
Kendal's significance to Bottom, it's worth noting that [she] was once
well-renowned for her sexy posterior. So much so, that she is a former
winner of the Jeans Industry's Rear Of the Year award."

There is in fact an FAQ on "The Good Life," maintained by Tony Velasquez,
posted regularly on rec.arts.tv.uk.

NOTE: "The Good Life" is known in the U.S. as "Good Neighbors."

    ___________________________________________________
    3.4 Is Eddie Hitler really related to Adolf Hitler?

No. Eddie is asked in two separate episodes if he's "any relation". The
episodes are "'S UP" and "Digger." Eddie takes this to mean, "Do you have
any relations?", but what the characters are asking is "Are you related to
Adolf Hitler?" They're trying to joke with him, and it goes right over his
head.

4. TRIVIA AND NEWS

    __________________________
    4.1 Series 3 Gets Underway
    
David Owen <dro@dsbc.icl.co.uk> informs me that the third series of Bottom
is currently in production. He notes, "Tickets have been available for the
studio recordings from the BBC ticket unit for about 2 months now. I
believe several of the shows are in the can already." He spoke to a BBC
employee who confirmed that series three was indeed in production.

    __________________
    4.2 General Trivia

Eddie Monsoon seems to be a name Adrian Edmondson and wife like: Jennifer
Saunders named her character in Absolutely Fabulous "Edwina Monsoon," but
she is constantly called "Eddie" in the series. Additionally, Adrian
used this name in the movie: "Eddie Monsoon - A Life".
 
Jan Staff makes the observation: "When Eddie goes back to sleep after the
visit from 'Santa Claus' (Richie), he imitates the Edward Munch painting
'The Scream'." There have been alot of strong reactions to this assertion
by Bottom fans: some agree, others disagree vehemently. You make the call.

Also in "Holy", Eddie decorates the flat by spraying "QPR" (see dictionary)
in white snow-flocky stuff on the wall; he also sprays "edIe Is grate".
    
    ____________________________
    4.3 The Red Dwarf Connection
   
Robert Llewellyn, who plays "Kryten" on the cult sci-fi comedy show Red
Dwarf, had a cameo in 'Parade' as a one-legged Falklands war veteran.

Peter Wragg handled the special effects on both Bottom and Red Dwarf.

Does the landlord in the pub look familiar to you? He's Lee Cornes,
probably better known as Dave Lister's Paranoia in "Red Dwarf".

The actor at the end of "Accident" who gets his arm pinched at the "birthday
party" by Richie is Mark Williams. He was also in Red Dwarf as "Olaf
Peterson" (series 1, episodes 1 and 3, and series 2, episode 4). (He's also
been in Alexei Sayle's STUFF.)

Interestingly, Ed Bye directed all of the episodes of Bottom. Red Dwarf
fans know him for his direction of the first three seasons of that show.

(Trivia not related to Bottom: "Rocket" was the cameraman for both The
Young Ones and Red Dwarf.)
