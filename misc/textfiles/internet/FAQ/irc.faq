A note on NickServ replies:
  ASCII based clients will see replies from NickServ as -service.de-.
  Zircon based clients will see replies from NickServ in the info window.
  Anything else may indicate a fake NickServ

01) What is NickServ ?

    NickServ (or NickServ@Service.de as the correct name is) is a service
    where you can register your nick for your and others convenience.
    BEWARE: Registering your nick does NOT indicate that you OWN your nick.
            Nicks are not owned on IRC.
            This is an established FACT.
    Registering your nick is done to avoid confusion if someone else should
    unfortunately out of ignorance use your nick.
    Register your nick and make it a "established" one. A bot using your
    nick may or may not be killed depending on the IRC-operator you ask.
    BUT, a human using your nick will never ever be killed by a IRC-Op.
    Think of registering your nick as getting a "brith certificate" for your
    nick, with your email and your name or cute saying.

02) How to correctly address NickServ ?

    To adress NickServ, the command is:
        /msg NickServ@service.de <command> <parameters>
    Anything else may be a faulty NickServ, unless you get the following
    mesage:
      -service.de- NickServ has changed. For security purposes,
      -service.de- you will have to send your service queries via
      -service.de-              /msg NickServ@service.de <command>
      -service.de- If you use an IRC client with ALIAS capability,
      -service.de- you may simply define an appropriate command.
    A lot of silly users have faked NickServ in the past, and thus
    be able to get their hands on login-passwords. To fake NickServ
    should be very difficult these days.
    One appropriate alias for ircII (which I use myself) is:
      /alias NS /msg NickServ@service.de $*

03) On-line help

    You may get on-line help two ways:
      /msg NickServ@service.de help <command> <subcommand>
    or messaging a NickServ operator and ask him or her politely for help.
    BUT, you should read the current HELP entry first. Remember that NickServ
    operators are humans with things to do besides being a NickServ oper :-)
    Be patient.

04) Query NickServ about a nick

    Send /msg NickServ@service.de whois <nickname>
    You may then get a entry telling you the following info:
      - Nickname and supplied additional information
      - Email address
      - When Nickname registred, and what user and host.domain it use
      - Signon and off times
      - Status (matching user/host, Authentication info)

05) How do I register my nick ?

    The correct syntax is:
      /msg NickServ@service.de register <password> <email> <additional info>
    NOTE: the <password> is NOT YOUR LOGIN PASSWORD. Find a new and fresh
          password to use with nickserv. The password is there for your
          security so that no-one than you can alter or remove your nickserv
          entry.
    The password is case sensitive.
    For instance, a user nicked "gnarfer" wants to register his nickname
    he then issues the following:
      /msg NickServ@service.de register LSD-Rules ruben@uib.no Ruben Olsen
    NickServ will then reply with:
      -service.de- *** You have been registered.

06) How do I change my email adress and/or info

    First identify yourself to the NickServ with the identify command,
    then issue a register command.

07) How to drop a registred nick

    First identify yourself to NickServ with the identify command, then issue
    a /msg NickServ@service.de UNREG
    NickServ will then reply with
      -service.de- *** '<YourNick>' is unregistered.
    For instance if a user name "gnarfer" does unregister his nick, NickServ
    replies with
      -service.de- *** 'gnarfer' is unregistered.

08) Nicks will expire after 10 weeks of non-use.

    A nick will be removed after aproximately 10 weeks of non-use. Things
    are a bit lax during summer vacation, so your nick will usualy survive
    during this.

09) Changing my password

    You must identify yourself (if not done) before you can issue the
    passwd command, the correct syntax is:
      /msg NickServ@service.de passwd <newpassword>
    If everything goes OK, NickServ will reply with:
      -service.de- *** Password has been changed.
    NOTE: the <password> is NOT YOUR LOGIN PASSWORD. Find a new and fresh
          password to use with nickserv. The password is there for your
          security so that no-one than you can alter or remove your nickserv
          entry. The password is case sensitive.

10) How to identify yourself to NickServ

    The correct syntax is:
      /msg NickServ@service.de identify <password>
    where <password> is your NickServ password.
    NOTE: If there is a link-break (which happens from time to time), you
          must re-identify yourself to the NickServ.

11) Using the same nick from several hosts

    To be able to do this, you must add other hosts in the access list.
    To be able to alter the access list, you must first identify yourself
    (if not done). Then issue the command:
      /msg NickServ@service.cd access add <user>@<host>.<domain>
    wildcarding is allowed.
    For instance if the user nicked "gnarfer" wants to add some of the
    other hosts he is using, he will then issue
      /msg NickServ@service.de access add rubenro@*.blh.no
    NickServ will the reply with:
      -service.de- *** ACCESS: Site entry 'rubenro@*.bih.no' added -
                   delayed until next synch operation
      -service.de- *** NickServ register entry updated (added 1 site).

12) Listing the access list

    Syntax is
      /msg NickServ@service.de access list
    You must identify yourself first if you have not done this before you
    can issue an access command.
    
13) Removing access list entries

    Syntax is
      /msg NickServ@service.de access delete <number>
    where <number> is a number given in a access list
    You must identify yourself first if you have not done this before you
    can issue a access delete command.
    For instance if the user nicked "gnarfer" wants to delte the entry named
    rubenro@*.blh.no, he will first issue the access list command and
    NickServ responds with
      -> *NickServ@service.de* access list
      -service.de- Site entry #1: rubenro@*.bih.no
      -service.de- Site entry #2: rubenro@*.blh.no
      -service.de- *** ACCESS DELETE <number> to delete a site entry.
    He then does the
      /msg NickServ@service.de delete 2
    and NickServ responds with
      -service.de- *** ACCESS: Site entry 2 deleted.

14) I have forgot my password, what do I do now...

    This is a frequent problem; the solution is as follows:
    1) Logon to IRC with the matching NickServ host and user entry. That is
       the host and user you registred your nicks by. NickServ operators
       issuing a whois command to the NickServ should then see:
         -service.de- * Status: Matching host entries
       If this message does not appear, the NickServ operator may refuse
       to change your NickServ password.
    2) type
         /msg NickServ@service.de operwho
       You will then get a list of NickServ operators, send one of the nicks
       that has a asterix ('*') in front of their nick a message politely
       asking if they can set a new password for you.
       Remember that NickServ operators are humans with things to do beside
       beeing a NickServ oper :-), please be patient.
    3) Remember to change your passwd again. REMEMBER to change it to
       something that is not your login password.
       This is done with /msg NickServ@service.de passwd <newpasswd>

   Sending mail to the NickServ email adress, or to me, will only get you
   the above as an answer ;-)
   You can't ask what your current password is since it is not possible to
   "see" a NickServ password. They are all encrypted in the database.

15) Reporting bugs

    To report a NickServ bug, either do it ON-line with the BUG command,
    or send a mail to IRC@Informatik.TU-Muenchen.DE with Subject: NickServ.
    On-line bug reporting is done with /msg NickServ@service.de BUG <bug
    report>.
    If you want to report a bug by email, issue a
      /msg NickServ@service.de help bug
    to get the current version and compile, please include this in your
    email. When mailing, rember to include as much information as possible
    on the problem as you see or experience it.
    Forgeting your NickServ password is NOT a bug ;-), nor a email issue.
    If you email NickServ about forgotten passwords, you will surely get
    a reply with the answer of question 14 :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-1)  What is IRC?
      IRC stands for the Internet Relay Chat. It is a much better, multi
      user implementation of the rudimentary 'talk' program. On IRC,
      several persons can simultaneously participate in a discussion
      over a particular 'channel', or even multiple channels. There is
      no restriction to the number of people that can participate in a
      given discussion, or the number of channels that can be formed
      over IRC.
      All conversations take place in *real time*. That's one of the fortes
      of IRC, and IRC has been used extensively for live coverage of
      world events, news, sports commentary, etc. It also serves as an
      *extremely* inexpensive substitute for long distance calling. People
      from all corners of the world can be found over IRC.
      IRC was developed by Jarkko Oikarinen in Finland in the late
      eighties, and was originally intended to work as a better
      substitute for 'talk' on his bulletin board. Of course, since
      then, it attracted overwhelming popularity, especially after
      the Gulf war when IRC was used to carry live coverage of events,
      and its growth has been exponential after that. Since then, reports
      of the Russian coup, and the California earthquake have been
      carried *live* over IRC, with people located in Russia and California
      bringing in the eyewitness reports.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-2)  Alright, now how do I get onto IRC?
      The irc program that you need to get onto irc is called an 'irc
      client'. First, check if your system already has an irc client
      installed by entering "irc" at your system prompt. If you're
      lucky, it could have been installed already on your system, and
      you may skip the remainder of this answer. If you do not have
      an irc client installed on your system, then you need to install
      one.
      Irc clients have been developed for a variety of platforms, and
      the Unix ircII client is by far the most popular one. There are
      also several emacs and x11 clients that run under Unix. Irc
      clients have been developed for MS-DOS / MSWindows, Macintoshes,
      (assuming that the PC/Macintosh that you use is connected to the
      network, i.e. you can't use a MS-Windows client if you dial in via a
      modem to a Unix system, although you may be on a PC - unless your PC
      is on the network with its own ip address (e.g. runs slip/ppp)) VMS
      systems and  VM/CMS systems as well. A major repository for IRC clients
      of all kinds is the site cs-ftp.bu.edu. Another site that you may want
      to try is ftp.undernet.org. You will need to FTP the code for the
      clients (or binaries as may be the case) from these anonymous ftp
      sites. A popular VMS client is the dough 'ircII-for-vms' client which
      has a lot of good features. WSirc is a good MS-Windows irc client.

      ircII on Unix
      --------------
      If you're on a Unix system, and aren't familiar with the nuances
      of ftp, uncompress, untar, the concept of Makefiles, etc. you may
      wish to try the auto-magic install which will do it for you. The
      foll. command at your Unix prompt will auto install an ircII client:
                   telnet sci.dixie.edu 1 | sh
      The unix ircII client takes up about 1.5Megs of disk space (including
      the help files). If you do not have enough diskspace, you may try
      a precompiled client for your system, which is usually just 400K
      or so. To find out what Unix system you're on, use the command
      'uname -a'. Once you do that, ftp the appropriate precompiled client
      from
                  ftp.undernet.org        /irc/clients/compiled.

      If you cannot spare even 400K for an irc binary, you may want to
      try the smallirc client which can be found at ftp.undernet.org
      under /irc/clients. This takes about 100-150K.

      ircII under VMS
      ---------------
      Here are the sequence of steps I took to install the ircII for vms
      client:

      $ create/dir [.ircii]
      $ set def [.ircii]
      $ ftp ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu
      UBVMSA.CC.BUFFALO.EDU>user
          Foreign username: anonymous
      <anonymous user ok. Send real ident as password.
      Password:
      <Guest User MEMS@ logged into DISK$ACSDISK2:[VMSSERV] at Thu 30-Jun-94
      <Directory and access restrictions apply
      UBVMSA.CC.BUFFALO.EDU>cd [.maslib.utilities.irc]
      <Connected to DISK$ACSDISK2:[VMSSERV.MASLIB.UTILITIES.IRC].
      UBVMSA.CC.BUFFALO.EDU>confirm off
      [All transactions are implicitly confirmed]
      UBVMSA.CC.BUFFALO.EDU>mget *.*;*
      [...  multiple file gets deleted...]
      UBVMSA.CC.BUFFALO.EDU>quit
      FTP>quit
      $
      $@install

      This will put you onto the main installation menu.
      You may exit this menu by holding the "Ctrl" key down and pressing "Z".
      Installation is very simple, just start with the first option 'P' and
      set the installation directory.  Also use 'S' to select the default
      server. Next select option 'C' and begin compiling
      the program.  If that completes successfully you can then try and run
      the irc program with the next option to see if it compiled correctly.
      If it has then you can go to the next option and edit your login.com
      to have  $irc :== $disk:[username.ircii]irc.exe  For example:
      $IRC :== $COUGAR:[SMIM.IRCII]IRC.EXE
      You can then proceed to the next step and delete all the non-essential
      files to conserve your disk quota.

      WSIRC under DOS/MS-WINDOWS
      --------------------------
      (this section assembled from responses by Caesar Samsi,csamsi@clark.net,
        - the author of wsirc, on alt.irc  )
      First, you must be running MS-Windows. WSIRC and WINSOCK.DLL are
      MS-Windows based software.
      Second, you must use an implementation of tcp/ip for MS-Windows which
      is called WINSOCK.DLL (it is actually the name of the file, but we refer
      to the protocol by the same name).
      Third, you must either be connected to a TCP/IP LAN or a modem. When
      you use a modem, you must subscribe to a SLIP/PPP account with your
      Internet Service Provider. You must ask them: your username, your
      pchostname, your permanent ip address , their DNS ip address. These will
      be required for WINSOCK.DLL configuration setup.
      Fourth, there is a configuration setup you need to do with WINSOCK.DLL,
      the specifics are covered by each vendor's documentation. Commercial
      WINSOCK software costs US$ 199.- to US$ 299.-. Shareware WINSOCK
      software costs US$ 20.- to US$ 40.- (Peter Tattam's WINSOCK.DLL is US
      $ 20.- has an internal SLIP driver and works very well). FTP sites
      for the complete WINSOCK distribution are:

           winftp.cica.indiana.edu     File:  twsk10a.zip
           ftp.cica.indiana.edu        File: /pub/pc/win3/winsock/winsock.zip

      Fifth, assuming all of the configuration works. Dial up your internet
      service provider to your SLIP or PPP account (a script file can automate
      this process) if you're on a modem.
      Sixth, once connected, start up WSIRC. Open up the Options | Server
      dialog box and enter all information in the boxes provided. For server
      names, browse the list of servers in the appendix of this FAQ. Do not
      use the actual ip address (e.g 123.222.222.222), use the human text name
      (us.undernet.org). Use port 6667. Use the username and pcname provided
      by your SLIP provider. Use nicknames that are NO LONGER than 9
      characters. Use no spaces in between for anything (except for the email
      info, but that's optional).
      Seventh, click on the connect button (or use File | Connect). If it
      doesn't connect, try another server. If 11004 error occurs, either your
      DNS ip address is wrong or you entered an invalid server name, enter a
      valid server name. If 10060 or 10061 occurs, either the server is down,
      busy or otherwise not responding, try another server. If the server
      says "Nickname in use", change your nickname on the fly with /NICK
      mynick. The server should then display its MOTD (message of the day)
      file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-3)  Are there any IRC telnet sites?

      This question pops up with frightening regularity on the irc
      newsgroups. IRC telnet sites are absolutely not recommended except
      as a *last ditch* effort when compiling a client doesn't work for
      you, or if you are simply unable to use a client for lack of an
      account/diskspace/etc. Before answering this question, you should
      consider the following *disadvantages* of using a telnet client site
      for IRC:
      * It is much much slower than using your own client. In cases, you
        may be connecting all across a continent to use IRC.
      * It is usually limited by a maximum number of users allowed on it.
      * It is not possible to send or receive files over irc when using
        a telnet client.
      * It is not possible to customise and tailor the client to suit your
        needs.
      * And finally, a telnet client site may simply stop providing service
        due to the huge abuse that often results from the client. This is
        more often the case than the exception. So, you are left stranded
        and have to hunt for new telnet sites.
      In short, GET YOUR OWN CLIENT. Under Unix, a client can be installed in
      as little as 150-200K of free diskspace. At best, telnet client sites
      should be used as a temporary solution until you are able to get your
      own client. It is with this goal in mind that the foll. list is

1-4) Hmm..I'm confused. What does a client do?  What's a server?

     An irc client reads in the commands that you give it, and parses
     them. It filters them and performs the appropriate actions, and if
     necessary, passes them on to a 'server'. An IRC server can serve
     many other clients. The server holds information about the channels
     and people on IRC, amongst other pieces of information. It is also
     responsible for routing your messages to other people on IRC. The
     IRC network itself consists of multiple servers which connect to
     one another in a 'tree'-like fashion (as an undirected acyclic
     graph to be precise).
     It is usually best if you select a server close to the site that
     you irc from. Here's a partial list of servers to try:
                   us.undernet.org - Central USA
       pasadena.ca.us.undernet.org - West coast USA
         boston.ma.us.undernet.org - East coast USA
                   eu.undernet.org - Europe
                   ca.undernet.org - Canada
                   au.undernet.org - Australia
      Usually, a  countrycode.undernet.org  should get you to one of the
      servers in your region. If not, you can try one of the servers listed
      above. To find out which server is closest to you once you're on
      IRC, use the /links command to get a list of servers. To switch to
      the closest server, try  /server servername.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-5)  What do I do next, once I'm connected to IRC? Is there a way to get
      online help? Why won't /help work for me?
      Thumb rule: All ircII commands must be preceded by a /
      Thus, typing /help gives you a list of available ircII commands.
      [If you're using ircII, and /help won't work for you, it's quite
       possible that your local help files have not been set up right.
       Try   /set help_path <path-to-helpfiles>
       and if that won't fix it, try

3) More Informations About IRC ( MIT.Edu )
------------------------------------------
Document : irc-faq

Last-modified: 1994/08/31
Version: 1.39

(1) What is IRC?

        IRC stands for "Internet Relay Chat". It was originally
written by Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi) in 1988. Since starting
in Finland, it has been used in over 60 countries around the world.  It
was designed as a replacement for the "talk" program but has become much
much more than that. IRC is a multi-user chat system, where people convene
on "channels" (a virtual place, usually with a topic of conversation) to
talk in groups, or privately. IRC is constantly evolving, so the way
things to work one week may not be the way they work the next. Read the
MOTD (message of the day) every time you use IRC to keep up on any new
happenings or server updates.
        IRC gained international fame during the 1991 Persian Gulf War,
where updates from around the world came accross the wire, and most irc
users who were online at the time gathered on a single channel to hear
these reports. IRC had similar uses during the coup against Boris Yeltsin
in September 1993, where IRC users from Moscow were giving live reports
about the unstable situation there.

(2) How is IRC set up?

        The user runs a "client" program (usually called 'irc') which
connects to the IRC network via another program called a "server".
Servers exist to pass messages from user to user over the IRC network.

(3) How do I use a client?

        First, check to see if irc is installed on your system. Type
"irc" from your prompt. If this doesn't work, ask your local systems
people if irc is already installed. This will save you the work of
installing it yourself.

        If an IRC client isn't already on your system, you either
compile the source yourself, have someone else on your machine compile
the source for you, or use the TELNET client.

"telnet ircclient.itc.univie.ac.at 6668". Please only use the latter when
you have no other way of reaching IRC, as this resource is quite
limited, slow, and *very* unreliable.

(4) Where can I get source for an IRC client?

        You can anonymous ftp to any of the following sites (use the
one closest to you):  *** If you don't know what anonymous ftp is, ask
your local systems people to show you ***

UNIX client-> cs-ftp.bu.edu /irc/clients
              ftp.acsu.buffalo.edu /pub/irc

                ftp.ira.uka.de /pub/systems/mac

(5) Which server do I connect to?

        It's usually best to try and connect to one geographically
close, even though that may not be the best. You can always ask when you
get on IRC. Here's a list of servers avaliable for connection:

USA:
                irc.bu.edu
                irc.colorado.edu
                irc.uiuc.edu
Canada:
                sol.csd.unb.ca
Europe:
                irc.funet.fi
                cismhp.univ-lyon1.fr
                disuns2.epfl.ch
                irc.nada.kth.se
                sokrates.informatik.uni-kl.de
                bim.itc.univie.ac.at
Australia:
                jello.qabc.uq.oz.au
This is, by no means, a comprehensive list, but merely a start. Connect
to the closest of these servers and join the channel #Twilight_Zone
When you get there, immediately ask what you want. Don't say "I have a
question" because then hardly anyone will talk.

(6) OK, I've got a client and I'm connected to a server, now what?

        It's probably best to take a look around and see what you want
to do first. All IRC commands start with a "/", and most are one word.
Typing /help will get you help information. /names will get you a list
of names, etc.
The output of /names is typically something like this->
Pub: #hack      zorgo eiji Patrick fup htoaster
Pub: #Nippon    @jircc @miyu_d
Pub: #nicole    MountainD
(Note there are LOTS more channels than this, this is just sample
output -- one way to stop /names from being too large is doing /names
-min 20 which will only list channels with 20 or more people on it,
but you can only do this with the ircII client).
"Pub" means public (or "visible") channel. "hack" is the channel name.
"#" is the prefix. A "@" before someone's nickname indicates he/she is the
"Channel operator" (see #7) of that channel. A Channel Operator is someone
who has control over a specific channel. It can be shared or not as the
first Channel Operator sees fit. The first person to join the channel
automatically receives Channel Operator status, and can share it with
anyone he/she chooses (or not).  Another thing you might see is "Prv"
which means private. You will only see this if you are on that private
channel. No one can see Private channels except those who are on that
particular private channel.

(7) What is a channel operator? What is an IRC operator?

        A channel operator is someone with a "@" by their nickname in
a /names list, or a "@" by the channel name in /whois output. Channel
operators are kings/queens of their channel. This means they can kick
you out of their channel for no reason. If you don't like this, you
can start your own channel and become a channel operator there.
        An IRC operator is someone who maintains the IRC network. They
cannot fix channel problems. They cannot kick someone out of a channel
for you. They cannot /kill (kick someone out of IRC temporarily)
someone just because you gave the offender channel operator privileges
and said offender kicked *you* off.

(8) What is a "bot"?

        "bot" is short for "robot". It is a script run from an ircII
client or a separate program (in perl, C, and sometimes more obscure
languages). StarOwl@uiuc.edu (Michael Adams) defined bots very well: "A
bot is a vile creation of /lusers to make up for lack of penis length".
IRC bots are generally not needed. See (10) below about "ownership" of
nicknames and channels.
        It should be noted that many servers (especially in the USA) have
started to ban ALL bots. Some ban bots so much that if you run a bot on
their server, you will be banned from using that server (see segment below
on K: lines).

(9) What are good channels to try while using IRC?

        #hottub and #initgame are almost always teeming with people.
#hottub is meant to simulate a hot tub, and #initgame is a non-stop game
of "inits" (initials). Just join and find out!
        To get a list of channels with their names and topics, do
/list -min 20 (on ircII) which will show you channels with 20 or more
members. You can also do this for smaller numbers.
        Many IRC operators are in #Twilight_Zone ... so if you join
that channel and don't hear much talking, don't worry, it's not because
you joined, operators don't talk much on that channel anyways!

(10) Someone is using my nickname, can anyone do anything about it?

    Someone is using my channel, can anyone do anything about it?
        Even while NickServ (see (13) below) registered nicknames, there
are not enough nicknames to have nickname ownership. If someone takes
your nickname while you are not on IRC, you can ask for them to give it
back, but you can not *demand* it, nor will IRC operators /kill for
nickname ownership.

        There are, literally, millions of possible channel names, so if
someone is on your usual channel, just go to another. You can /msg them
and ask for them to leave, but you can't *force* them to leave.

(11) There aren't any channel operators on my channel, now what?

        Channel operators are the owner(s) of their respective channels.
Keep this in mind when giving out channel operator powers (make sure to
give them to enough people so that all of the channel operators don't
unexpectedly leave and the channel is stuck without a channel operator).
        On the other hand, do not give out channel operator to
*everyone*. This causes the possibility of mass-kicking, where the
channel would be stuck without any channel operators.
        You have one option. You can ask everyone to leave and rejoin
the channel. This is a good way to get channel operator back. It
doesn't work on large channels or ones with bots, for obvious reasons.

(12) What if someone tells me to type something cryptic?

        Never type anything anyone tells you to without knowing what it
is. There is a problem with typing certain commands with the ircII
client that give anyone immediate control of your client (and thus can
gain access to your account).

(13) What was NickServ?  Is NickServ ever coming back?

        NickServ was a nickname registration service run in Germany. It
was a bot that told people who used a registered nickname to stop using
that nickname. NickServ has been down since the Spring of 1994.
        It is not likely that NickServ will be back.
        Remember, nicknames aren't owned.

(14) What does "*** Ghosts are not allowed on IRC." mean?

      What does "*** You are not welcome on this server." mean?
        On IRC, you cannot be banned from every single server.
Server-banning exists only on a per-server basis (being banned on one
server does not mean you are automatically banned from another). "Ghosts
are not allowed on IRC" means that you are banned from using that server.
The banning is in one of three forms:
 * You are banned specifically, you yourself.  Only you can be responsible
   for this (if you are using a shared account, this obviously does not
   apply). Thus the responsibility lies completely with you and you have
   noone to complain to.
 * Your machine is banned. Chances are it wasn't you who committed the
   wrongdoing. Try using another machine on campus and seeing if you can
   use that particular irc server then.
 * Your whole site is banned (where "site" == "school", "company",
   "country"). This almost certainly wasn't your fault. And chances are
   you won't be able to get the server-ban lifted. Try using another
   server.
        The most general answer is "use another server", but if it bothers
you, try writing to the irc administrator of that site -->
/admin server.name.here  -- plead your case. It might even get somewhere!

(15) What does "You have new email." mean? What does it mean when I see

     "[Mail: 5]" in my status bar?
        IRC does not have its own mail. However, if your client tells you
that you have new email, it simply means that you have received mail in
your account. Leave irc (either by suspending it or quitting it), and read
the mail.
        You might also see "You have new email." when you start irc. IRC
does not keep track of email between sessions, so when you start irc and
have something in your mailbox, irc will tell you you have new email.
        The "[Mail: 5]" in your status bar tells you how many email
messages you have in your mailbox. Again, to access them, leave irc and
read them using your normal mail reader.

(16) Where can I find GIF archives of IRC people?

        GIF archives of IRC people are available:
     ftp.funet.fi:/pub/pics/people/misc/irc (NORDUnet only)
     ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de /pub/comp/networking/irc/RP

(17) Where can I learn more?

        The best, basic, IRC user's manual is the IRC Primer,
available in plain text, PostScript, and LaTeX from
cs-ftp.bu.edu:/irc/support ... Another good place to start might be
downloading the IRC tutorials.  They're avaliable via anonymous ftp
from cs-ftp.bu.edu in /irc/support/tutorial.*
        You can also join various IRC related mailing lists:
 * "operlist" is a list that discusses current (and past) server code,
   routing, and protocol. You can join by mailing
   operlist-request@kei.com.
 * "ircd-three" is a list that exists to discuss protocol revisions
   for the 3.0 release of the ircd (irc server), currently in
   planning.  Mail ircd-three-request@kei.com to be added.
NOTE! These are not "Help me, where can I get started?" lists. For
that information, read the IRCprimer noted above.
        Those looking for more technical information can get the IRC
RFC (rfc1459) available at all RFC ftp sites, as well as
cs-ftp.bu.edu:/irc/support/rfc1459.txt
(18) Where can I get an updated copy of this FAQ?
this FAQ is available from several sources:
        cs-ftp.bu.edu:/irc/support/alt-irc-faq
        ftp.kei.com:/pub/irc/alt-irc-faq
The latest copy will always be posted to these two ftp sites.

(18) What do I do if I'm still confused or have additions to this posting?

        email hrose@kei.com or ask for help (in #Twilight_Zone) on IRC.

4) More & More Informations About IRC, MUDs
-------------------------------------------

Chapter Eleven: IRC, MUDs and other things that are more fun than t...
Chapter 11: IRC, MUDs AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MORE FUN THAN THEY SOUND

     Many Net systems provide access to a series of interactive
services that let you hold live "chats" or play online games with
people around the world.  To find out if your host system offers
these, you can ask your system administrator or just try them -- if
nothing happens, then your system does not provide them.  In general,
if you can use telnet and ftp, chances are good you can use these
services as well.


11.1  TALK

     This is the Net equivalent of a telephone conversation and
requires that both you and the person you want to talk to have access
to this function and are online at the same time.  To use it, type

                talk user@site.name

where user@site.name is the e-mail address of the other person.  She will
see something like this on her screen:

                talk: connection requested by yourname@site.name
                talk: respond with:  talk yourname@site.name

To start the conversation, she should then type (at her host system's
command line):

                talk yourname@site.name

where that is your e-mail address.  Both of you will then get a top
and bottom window on your screen.  She will see everything you type in
one window; you'll see everything she types in the other.  To
disconnect, hit control-C.
     One note: Public-access sites that use Sun computers sometimes have
trouble with the talk program.  If talk does not work, try typing

     otalk

or

     ntalk

instead.  However, the party at the other end will have to have the same
program online for the connection to work.


11.2  INTERNET RELAY CHAT


     IRC is a program that lets you hold live keyboard conversations
with people around the world.  It's a lot like an international CB
radio  - it even uses "channels."  Type something on your computer and
it's instantly echoed around the world to whoever happens to be on the
same channel with you.  You can join in existing public group chats or
set up your own.  You can even create a private channel for yourself
and as few as one or two other people.  And just like on a CB radio,
you can give yourself a unique "handle" or nickname.
     IRC currently links host systems in 20 different countries, from
Australia to Hong Kong to Israel.  Unfortunately, it's like telnet --
either your site has it or it doesn't.  If your host system does have it,
Just type

               irc

and hit enter.  You'll get something like this:


*** Connecting to port 6667 of server world.std.com
*** Welcome to the Internet Relay Network, adamg
*** Your host is world.std.com, running version 2.7.1e+4
*** You have new mail.
*** If you have not already done so, please read the new user information with
+/HELP NEWUSER
*** This server was created Sat Apr 18 1992 at 16:27:02 EDT
*** There are 364 users on 140 servers
*** 45 users have connection to the twilight zone
*** There are 124 channels.
*** I have 1 clients and 3 servers
MOTD - world.std.com Message of the Day -
MOTD - Be careful out there...
MOTD -
MOTD - ->Spike
* End of /MOTD command.

 23:13 [1] adamg [Mail: 32] * type /help for help

----------------------------------------------------------------------
_________________________________________________________________________

     You are now in channel 0, the "null" channel, in which you can look
up various help files, but not much else. As you can see, IRC takes over
your entire screen.  The top of the screen is where messages will
appear.  The last line is where you type IRC commands and messages.  All
IRC commands begin with a /.  The slash tells the computer you are about
to enter a command, rather than a message. To see what channels are
available, type

                /list

and hit enter.  You'll get something like this:

*** Channel    Users  Topic
*** #Money     1      School CA$H (/msg SOS_AID help)
*** #Gone      1      ----->> Gone with the wind!!!  ------>>>>>
*** #mee       1
*** #eclipse   1
*** #hiya      2
*** #saigon    4
*** #screwed   3
*** #z         2
*** #comix     1      LET'S TALK 'BOUT COMIX!!!!!
*** #Drama     1
*** #RayTrace  1      Rendering to Reality and Back
*** #NeXT      1
*** #wicca     4      Mr. Potato Head, R. I. P.
*** #dde^mhe`  1      no'ng chay? mo*? ...ba` con o*iiii
*** #jgm       1
*** #ucd       1
*** #Maine     2
*** #Snuffland 1
*** #p/g!      4
*** #DragonSrv 1

     Because IRC allows for a large number of channels, the list might
scroll off your screen, so you might want to turn on your computer's
screen capture to capture the entire list.  Note that the channels
always have names, instead of numbers.  Each line in the listing tells
you the channel name, the number of people currently in it, and whether
there's a specific topic for it.  To switch to a particular channel,
type

                /join #channel

where "#channel" is the channel name and hit enter.  Some "public"
channels actually require an invitation from somebody already on it.  To
request an invitation, type

                /who #channel-name

where channel-name is the name of the channel, and hit enter.  Then ask
someone with an @ next to their name if you can join in.  Note that
whenever you enter a channel, you have to include the #.  Choose one
with a number of users, so you can see IRC in action.
     If it's a busy channel, as soon as you join it, the top of your
screen will quickly be filled with messages.  Each will start with a
person's IRC nickname, followed by his message.
     It may seem awfully confusing at first.  There could be two or
three conversations going on at the same time and sometimes the

three conversations going on at the same time and sometimes the
messages will come in so fast you'll wonder how you can read them all.
     Eventually, though, you'll get into the rhythm of the channel and
things will begin to make more sense.  You might even want to add your
two cents (in fact, don't be surprised if a message to you shows up on
your screen right away; on some channels, newcomers are welcomed
immediately).  To enter a public message, simply type it on that bottom
line (the computer knows it's a message because you haven't started the
line with a slash) and hit enter.
     Public messages have a user's nickname in brackets, like this:

                <tomg>

     If you receive a private message from somebody, his name will be
between asterisks, like this:

                *tomg*

11.3  IRC COMMANDS


Note: Hit enter after each command.


/away         When you're called away to put out a grease fire
              in the kitchen, issue this command to let others know
              you're still connected but just away from your terminal
              or computer for awhile.


/help         Brings up a list of commands for which there is a help
              file. You will get a "topic:" prompt.  Type in the

              file. You will get a "topic:" prompt.  Type in the
              subject for which you want information and hit enter.
              Hit enter by itself to exit help.

/invite       Asks another IRC to join you in a conversation.

                        /invite fleepo #hottub

              would send a message to fleepo asking him to join you on
              the #hottub channel.  The channel name is optional.



/join         Use this to switch to or create a particular channel,
              like this:

                        /join #hottub

>
                        /join #hottub

              If one of these channels exists and is not a private
              one, you will enter it.  Otherwise, you have just
              created it. Note you have to use a # as the first
              character.


/list         This will give you a list of all available public
              channels, their topics (if any) and the number of users
              currently on them.  Hidden and private channels are not
              shown.

/m name       Send a private message to that user.

/mode         This lets you determine who can join a channel you've
              created.

                        /mode #channel +p

              makes the channel private

/nick         This lets you change the name by which others see you.

                        /nick fleepo

              would change your name for the present session to
              fleepo. People can still use /whois to find your e-mail

              address.  If you try to enter a channel where somebody
              else is already using that nickname, IRC will ask you to
              select another name.

/query        This sets up a private conversation between you and
              another IRC user.  To do this, type

                        /query nickname

              Every message you type after that will go only to that
              person.  If she then types

                        /query nickname

              where nickname is yours, then you have established a
              private conversation.  To exit this mode, type

              by itself.  While in query mode, you and the other
              person can continue to "listen" to the discussion on
              whatever public channels you were on, although neither
              of you will be able to respond to any of the messages
              there.

/quit         Exit IRC.

/signoff      Exit IRC.

/summon       Asks somebody connected to a host system with IRC to
              join you on IRC. You must use the person's entire e-mail
              address.

                        /summon fleepo@foo.bar.com

              would send a message to fleepo asking him to start IRC.
              Usually not a good idea to just summon people unless you
              know they're already amenable to the idea; otherwise you
              may wind up annoying them no end. This command does not
              work on all sites.

/topic        When you've started a new channel, use this command to let
              others know what it's about.

                        /topic #Amiga

11.4  IRC IN TIMES OF CRISIS
_________________________________________________________________________

>
     IRC has become a new medium for staying on top of really big
breaking news.  In 1993, when Russian lawmakers barricaded themselves
inside the parliament building, some enterprising Muscovites and a couple
of Americans set up a "news channel" on IRC to relay first-person
accounts direct from Moscow. The channel was set up to provide a
continuous loop of information, much like all-news radio stations that
cycle through the day's news every 20 minutes.  In 1994, Los Angeles
residents set up a similar channel to relay information related to the
Northridge earthquake.  In both cases, logs of the channels were archived
somewhere on the Net, for those unable to "tune in" live.
     How would you find such channels in the future?  Use the /list
command to scroll through the available channels.  If one has been set up
to discuss a particular breaking event, chances are you'll see a brief
description next to the channel name that will tell you that's the place
to tune.

to tune.
11.5  MUDs


     Multiple-User Dimensions or Dungeons (MUDs) take IRC into the
realm of fantasy.  MUDs are live, role-playing games in which you
enter assume a new identity and enter an alternate reality through
your keyboard.  As you explore this other world, through a series of
simple commands (such as "look," "go" and "take"), you'll run across
other users, who may engage you in a friendly discussion, enlist your
aid in some quest or try to kill you for no apparent reason.
     Each MUD has its own personality and creator (or God) who was
willing to put in the long hours required to establish the particular
MUD's rules, laws of nature and information databases.  Some MUDs
stress the social aspects of online communications -- users frequently

stress the social aspects of online communications -- users frequently
gather online to chat and join together to build new structures or
even entire realms.  Others are closer to "Dungeons and Dragons" and
are filled with sorcerers, dragons and evil people out to keep you
from completing your quest -- through murder if necessary.
     Many MUDs (there are also related games known as MUCKs and MUSEs)
require you to apply in advance, through e-mail, for a character name
and password.  One that lets you look around first, though, is
HoloMuck at McGill University in Montreal.  The premise of this game
is that you arrive in the middle of Tanstaafl, a city on the planet
Holo.  You have to find a place to live (else you get thrown into the
homeless shelter) and then you can begin exploring.  Magic is allowed
on this world, but only outside the city limits.  Get bored with the
city and you can roam the rest of the world or even take a trip into
orbit (of course, all this takes money; you can either wait for your
weekly salary or take a trip to the city casino).  Once you become
familiar with the city and get your own character, you can even begin

     When you connect, type

has a password of "guest."

you have to claim an apartment (you may have to look around; many will
already) be occupied.  And now it's off to explore Holo!  One command
you'll want to keep in mind is "take." Periodically, you'll come

powers on you.  If you type

the MUD's commands.
     The "say" command lets you talk to other players publicly. For
example,

                say Hey, I'm here!

would be broadcast to everybody else in the room with you.  If you

want to talk to just one particular person, use "whisper" instead of
"say."
        whisper agora=Hey, I'm here!

would be heard only by agora.  Another way to communicate with
somebody regardless of where on the world they are is through your
pager.  If you suddenly see yours go off while visiting, chances are
it's a wizard checking to see if you need any help.  To read his
message, type

                page

To send him a message, type

                page name=message

where name is the wizard's name (it'll be in the original message).
      Other MUDs and MUCKs may have different commands, but generally
use the same basic idea of letting you navigate through relatively
simple English commands.
     When you connect to a MUD, choose your password as carefully as
you would one for your host system; alas, there are MUD crackers who
enjoy trying to break into other people's MUD accounts.  And never,
never use the same password as the one you use on your host system!
     MUDs can prove highly addicting.  "The jury is still out on
whether MUDding is 'just a game'  or 'an extension of real life with
gamelike qualities'," says Jennifer Smith, an active MUD player who
wrote an FAQ on the subject.
     She adds one caution: "You shouldn't do anything that you
wouldn't do in real life, even if the world is a fantasy world.  The
important thing to remember is that it's the fantasy world of possibly

important thing to remember is that it's the fantasy world of possibly
hundreds of people, and not just yours in  particular.  There's a
human being on the other side of each and every wire!  Always remember
that you may meet these other people some day,  and they may break
your nose.  People who treat others badly gradually build up bad
reputations and eventually receive the NO FUN Stamp of Disapproval."

     All is not fun and games on the Net.  Like any community, the Net
has its share of obnoxious characters who seem to exist only to make
your life miserable (you've already met some of them in chapter 4).
There are people who seem to spend a bit more time on the Net than many
would find healthy.  It also has its criminals.  Clifford Stoll writes in
"The Cuckoo's Egg" how he tracked a team of German hackers who were
breaking into U.S. computers and selling the information they found to
the Soviets.  Robert Morris, a Cornell University student, was convicted
of unleashing a "worm" program that effectively disabled several thousand
computers connected to the Internet.
     Of more immediate concern to the average Net user are crackers
who seek to find other's passwords to break into Net systems and people
who infect programs on ftp sites with viruses.
    There is a widely available program known as "Crack" that can
decipher user passwords composed of words that might be found in a

decipher user passwords composed of words that might be found in a
dictionary (this is why you shouldn't use such passwords).  Short of
that, there are the annoying types who take a special thrill in trying to
make you miserable.  The best advice in dealing with them is to count to
10 and then ignore them -- like juveniles everywhere, most of their fun
comes in seeing how upset you can get.
    Meanwhile, two Cornell University students pleaded guilty in 1992 to
uploading virus-infected Macintosh programs to ftp sites.  If you plan
to try out large amounts of software from ftp sites, it might be wise to
download or buy a good anti-viral program.
    But can law enforcement go too far in seeking out the criminals?
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded in large part in
response to a series of government raids against an alleged gang of
hackers.  The raids resulted in the near bankruptcy of one game
company never alleged to have had anything to do with the hackers,
when the government seized its computers and refused to give them
back.  The case against another alleged participant collapsed in court

back.  The case against another alleged participant collapsed in court
when his attorney showed the "proprietary" and supposedly hacked
information he printed in an electronic newsletter was actually
available via an 800 number for about $13 -- from the phone company
from which that data was taken.
11.8  FYI

     You can find discussions about IRC in the alt.irc newsgroup.
     "A Discussion on Computer Network Conferencing," by Darren Reed
(May, 1992), provides a theoretical background on why conferencing
systems such as IRC are a Good Thing.  It's available through ftp at
nic.ddn.mil in the rfc directory as rfc1324.txt.
     Every Friday, Scott Goehring posts a new list of  MUDs and related
games and their telnet addresses in the newsgroup rec.games.mud.announce.
