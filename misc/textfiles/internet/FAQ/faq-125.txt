	GRAVIS ULTRASOUND ("GUS") FAQ VERSION 1.25 [04/09/93]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Certain  questions concerning  the Gravis  UltraSound  ("GUS")
sound card are asked  over and over on  the UltraSound Daily Digest (a
mailing list for GUS  users) and  on comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcard.  In an
attempt to alleviate some redundancy from the lives of USENET/Internet
folk, this FAQ  (Frequently  Asked Questions, with answers)  list  has
been  created.  It's  maintained by  Dave   DeBry  (ddebry@dsd.es.com,
debry@peruvian.cs.utah.edu).   If you  have any questions,   comments,
complaints,  or extra cash, please  feel  free to  send   them to him.
Don't expect a reply very quickly, as Dave does have a life outside of
this FAQ (contrary to the belief of his friends).

	If you would like to join the mailing list and be privy to the
latest and greatest information, banter, and  poor spelling concerning
the   GUS, mail  to <ultrasound-request@dsd.es.com>.   The   automated
server  will tell you  how to sign  up for the  mailing list, tell you
where the FTP   sites associated with  the Digest    are (they recieve
software updates directly     from   Gravis often),  and  other   such
information that will eventually lead  you down  the trail to Nirvana,
Valhalla, Heaven, or whatever Land O' Happiness your religion wants to
get to.

	BTW:  All  FAQs,  including  this one,   are  available on the
archive  site  rtfm.mit.edu in  the directory pub/usenet/news.answers.
The name under which a FAQ  is archived appears in the "Archive-Name:"
line   at  the  top of   the    article.  This   FAQ  is archived   as
PCsoundcards/gravis-ultrasound/faq.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

1] What is the GUS?

	The Gravis UltraSound (generall referred to as the "GUS") is a
sound card built by Advanced Gravis Technologies (GRVSF on  the Nasdaq
exchange).  It is  a stereo card  that can play 32 synthesized  voices
and 32 sampled voices simultaneously.  It is also MIDI compatible.

	The synthesizer  on the GUS   is based on a  technology called
Wavetable Synthesis (WS)  instead of FM synthesis  (like the Adlib and
Soundblaster series).  WS is flexible enough to emulate  FM synthesis,
and so an emulator has been created so SoundBlaster and Adlib programs
can use the GUS (see question #2).

	The GUS, in its basic state, can sample 8 bit stereo at 44kHz.
It  can  playback  16  bit  stereo  samples  at  44kHz.    There is  a
daughterboard that you can buy  and plug on to  the GUS  that makes it
possible to sample at 16 bit stereo 44kHz.

	The GUS has the following "external" ports:
	o Stereo line in
	o Stereo line out
	o Stereo amplified out
	o Stereo microphone in
	o Game port / MIDI port

	The GUS has several "internal" ports, including:
	o CD Audio IN
	o Expansion ports for daughtercards (see question #15).
	o Other as of yet unexplained pins/ports.

	The game port can be changed to  MIDI in/out/through  ports by
means of an adapter available from  Gravis.  Alternatively  (and for a
LOT less money) you can build your own (see question #17).
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2] How does the GUS emulate the SoundBlaster and Adlib cards?

	Currently, the emulation  is done in  a TSR/device driver that
comes with  the card, called  SBOS.    It's pretty small, and  doesn't
conflict with too many programs.

	SBOS has several command line options available (if run in the
TSR version; the device driver version requires a reboot to change the
setup) for compatibility with various different programs.  To find out
what switches to  use for which programs, there  is a  list of options
being maintained (see question #13).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

3] Where can I get a GUS, and how much will it cost?

	The "suggested  retail" for the  card is $200  (U.S. dollars),
but if you  pay that much, you haven't  done your  homework.  However,
homework on this card isn't  easy because Gravis still hasn't actually
advertised (they have a weird policy concerning advertising).

	If you call around, you should have no trouble getting the GUS
for  less than  $150.   Suggested  places  are Babbages,  Bizmart, and
Telemart.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

4] What version of the GUS hardware is the latest?

	This is a question that is  actually  pretty irrelevant.  Yes,
there have been  different "releases" of the  GUS card (the number  is
etched into the  board),  but  there  really  aren't any  differences.
Evidently,  some of  the newer cards  have been redesigned  to require
less hardware (and less cost to Gravis), but no  functionality changes
have been made.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

5] What version of the GUS software is the latest?

	SBOS:		2.04
	Playmidi:	3.50
	GUSMOD:		2.11
	
	All updates are available on the GUS FTP sites.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

6] Where can I get the latest GUS software?
   (AKA: Where is the GUS FTP site and/or Gravis BBS?)

GUS FTP sites:
	archive.epas.utoronto.ca         pub/pc/ultrasound
	wuarchive.wustl.edu       systems/msdos/ultrasound

	BTW: You  can get a LOT  more than just GUS  software releases
from Gravis on the  FTP  sites.  There's lots of  PD  software written
specifically  for the GUS, music  (midi music, midi patches, mods, 669
music, samples, etc., etc), tech info on the card,  back issues of the
UltraSound Daily Digest, etc., etc... check it out!

Gravis BBS:
	(604) 431-5927

6a] What if I don't have FTP access?

	For those of you who don't have FTP access, find out about the
email  request servers that   do remote FTP   for  you.  (I don't have
enough space to let all the files be  requested by  the Digest Request
Server,  and it's  useless to duplicate  that info anyway.)  There are
several mail-FTP servers out there; ask around on the net if you can't
find them.

	Alternatively, you can call the Gravis BBS.  There are several
major disadvantages with this, though:

	1] Long distance to Canada (no offense to you Canadians :).
	2] 2400 baud.
	3] The BBS doesn't have all the public domain stuff that
		the FTP sites do.
	4] It's almost *always* busy.

	Please  *DO   NOT*     ask  people    to    post binaries   to
comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcard.  It's not a binary newsgroup, and  that's a
lot of wasted bandwidth to people who  don't  want the programs.   Use
email.  It saves bandwidth, fights cavities, and builds character.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

7] Is the GUS still in beta-test phase?

	Absolutely NOT.  It doesn't matter where  you hear this rumor,
it's false.  The rumor  stemmed from the idea that  you could get  the
very  latest GUS  driver  software, SBOS, etc.,  from the  Gravis BBS.
These programs aren't beta test stuff.  They  are concrete examples of
Gravis listening to bug reports from  GUS users  and turning out fixes
as fast as they can.

	That's commitment to customers on Gravis' part, NOT  a lack of
a quality assurance department.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

8] What machines will the GUS work with?

	You need  an IBM compatible computer   with   at   least a 286
processor.  It needs to be at least a  386 if you want to  use the GUS
with Windows.

8a] I've heard about problems with the OPTi chipset...

	There have been   troubles  with the GUS   if your  computer's
chipset is made by OPTI.  Not all OPTI chipsets are bad,  but  some of
them have  a faulty DMA controller.   We're still  trying  to pin down
which chipsets are flawed; when we have a better idea of exactly which
ones are bad  they'll be added here.   Until then, be careful if  your
computer has an OPTI set, and try reading the UltraSound Daily Digest,
or comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcard on USENET.

]
]	  Actually, it's not just OPTi chipsets, UMC has been implicated
] as well  (Gravis first noticed  the  problem  with  UMC chipsets)  and
] according to Digital Audio Labs (who told  Gravis what was  going on),
] the bad datacode is 9149 and the bad chip is  the 82C206.  This is all
] explained in the docs  for GUS0013.ZIP (I  think), the OPTi fix posted
] to the GUS FTP sites.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

9] Why should I upgrade the memory onboard my GUS?

	For starters, the announcement has already come  out of Gravis
that the standard GUS will come with 512k instead of 256k.  This means
that software companies will write   their programs to use *at  least*
512k onboard the GUS.  And with all the  users  going to 1meg, chances
are that things will be written for that limit.

	It's a cheap upgrade.  If  your board came  with 256k, it will
only cost you about $30 to go up to 1meg (see question #10).

	There's already a lot of MIDI files out there that require the
full 1meg to play them, because they use lots of  different instrument
patches.

	If you plan on doing any sampling, you'll need the space.  You
can do direct-to-disk  sampling, but it  can cause "skips" to go  into
the sample each time the sample goes down the bus to  the drive.  In a
worst case situation,  you could  be   sampling 16 bits in  stereo  at
44kHz.  So, you're doing 88000 samples  (stereo,  remember) of 16 bits
each every  second.  That's 171k (176000   bytes) every  second, which
means the  full 1meg memory will fill  up in  5 seconds at  that rate.
With only 256k, you can get about 1.5 seconds.

	Of course, only people doing very serious  stuff with the card
need to sample at that high of a rate in 16 bits.  MOD files generally
do 16kHz 8 bit mono samples.  But upgrading  the  card is still pretty
important in that case... do the math, and you'll see.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

10] Where can I get memory for the GUS, and how much will it cost?

	You need six 256x4 DRAM  chips,  with speeds of 80ns or better
(in other words, 80ns OR LESS).  They tend to run about $4 a piece, so
the total price will be $24 + shipping.

	To find  a  place with them, just  look through  the  Computer
Shopper magazine.  Check the index for  'memory' and call a few places
for prices.  (After a little calling, I found a place selling them for
$3.45 apiece.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

11] I'm having trouble installing the GUS software...

	One of the earlier  versions of the  GUS software disks (1.21)
had a problem with  the install program.   Check out the GUS FTP sites
or the Gravis BBS for the latest stuff (see question #6).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

12] I'm having trouble getting the GUS to work with Windows...

	There  in one possibility  that  accounts for about 50% of the
problems  people have with the  GUS and Windows:  you  can't have SBOS
loaded before going to Windows.  (You don't  need it... if the Windows
program was written right, Windows will  handle the link to  the card;
the program shouldn't care.)  Try running ULTRINIT (it clears the GUS'
program memory), or rebooting.

	Other problems:

(a) No sound at all in Windows...

]	  Even if you have an  ULTRASND.INI in your  ULTRADIR directory,

] "0=acpiano".  If it is only a few lines long, get another copy and put
] it into the ULTRADIR directory.  Reboot  Windows and  you will soon be

]	  (The purpose of  the ULTRASND.INI file is  to  let the Windows
] driver know  what patch file  goes with  what   patch number.   If the
] driver doesn't find the .INI file in the ULTRADIR directory it creates
] a truncated version with no patch names in it.)

	Manager.

16] What new software is coming out for the GUS?

	Gravis has signed contracts with several companies to release
and/or support software for the GUS:

a) Gravis Ultrasound 3D

	[ SEE ALSO -- Question #19 ]

	"Advanced  Gravis  announced a  development that  will forever
change the way  PC game   players, business, and  multimedia  software
users perceive sound from their computer software.   Gravis UltraSound
3D  for the PC, the next  step for the  Gravis UltraSound card, places
the computer user in the middle of an  audio environment for immersive
virtual reality audio. For the first time outside virtual reality labs
and at  an affordable consumer pricepoint, sound  effects, music, even
simple clicks of  a  mouse can  be  placed  in  an audio    space that
surrounds the user like a sphere.

	"Utilizing Focal Point technology, UltraSound 3D processes the
audio signal through a technique  called "convolution,"  new right and
left binaural audio  signals are generated that  create  a  wraparound
sound effect to the human ear.  The sound signal is actually  a stereo
signal shaped electronically  to make the listener  hear the sound  as
three-dimensional and  in the   correct location --   a psychoacoustic
effect  that  can be manipulated  in real time.   When  compared to an
equalizer,  binaural processing adjusts  the gain   and  phase  of the
frequency band.  But  it would take  two hundred  sliders for gain and
another two hundred sliders for phase shift per ear and the ability to
change  all of  them  in  real time  to  achieve the immersive virtual
reality audio effect of Gravis UltraSound 3D."

b) Midisoft Recording Session

	"Advanced  Gravis   Computer   Technology Ltd.   and  Midisoft
Corporation have signed an agreement whereby Midisoft  music authoring
software will be bundled together with Advanced  Gravis UltraSound(tm)
multimedia PC   hardware.    The  world-wide, non-exclusive  licensing
agreement extends to the end of 1993.

	"Under   the  terms  of  the  agreement,  Gravis  will license
Midisoft Recording Session for Windows and  a collection of MIDI songs
for  inclusion in the retail  versions of the  Gravis UltraSound sound
card.  The bundle will give users the ability to easily play, compose,
record, and edit MIDI music  for  personal, business,  or  educational
purposes."

c) Power Chords for Windows

	"Advanced  Gravis Computer  Technology   Ltd. and  Howling Dog
Systems have signed an agreement whereby Howling Dog's  music software
will   be    bundled together    with  Advanced Gravis  UltraSound(tm)
multimedia  PC hardware.   The  world-wide,  non-exclusive   licensing
agreement extends to the end of 1993.

	"Under the terms of the agreement, Gravis  will  license Power
Chords for Windows and a collection of MIDI songs for inclusion in the
retail versions of the Gravis UltraSound sound  card.  The bundle will
give users the ability to easily play, edit and compose MIDI music for
personal,  business, or  educational purposes using a familiar  guitar
interface and powerful drum kit."

17] How do I build the MIDI interface for the GUS?

Written by: pcunnell@micrognosis.co.uk (Paul Cunnell)
] 
] > Has anyone made the midi interface for the GUS that is in the FAQ?
] > If so, were did you find the part# 6N138?  I cant seem to locate
] > this anywhere.  Also, (excuse my ingorance i'm not an EE) but
] > what exactly is that part and its purpose? Thanks...
] 
] 	  The 6N138 is a high sensitivity opto-isolator, manufactured by
] Hewlett Packard (and I  believe, a company  called Quality Technology)
] The main  point in using this  part  as opposed  to  other more common
] opto-isolators is the low LED ON current spec. (1.6mA)
] 
] 	  A midi out circuit is basically a LED in series with 600 ohms,
] and a 5V supply. Taking into account the 1.7V forward drop  across the
] LED, you get  about 5mA in  the on state.  Other optos  generally need
] more current to turn them  on (say 15-60mA,  but this varies a lot). A
] 'high speed' 6N137 opto will also work, I believe, but that would be a
] bit marginal on the input current (spec. is min 5mA).
] 
] 	  Since a number of people have been asking, I'll add  below the
] midi circuit  that I'm using,  plus a bit  of general explanation I've
] culled from other peoples' postings on the subject.

] 	  Note that when the UART TXD  is high, no current flows through
] the resistors   and  optoisolator's LED,   causing the  optoisolator's
] phototransistor to remain off, allowing the UART RXD to be pulled high
] by the  270  ohm resistor.   When the UART  TXD is  low, current flows
] through  the   resistors    and  optoisolator's   LED,    turning   on
] optoisolator's  phototransistor, grounding the UART RXD.   The voltage
] drop across the optoisolator's LED is typically 1.5 volts, leaving 3.5
] volts to be dropped across (3 times 220) 660  ohms, which allows about
] 5 ma to flow.
]  
] 	  The reason a current loop is used is that it  allows an ground
] isolated interconnection.  Note   that the ground  from the  MIDI  OUT
] port's device  is not connected  to the  ground of  the MIDI IN port's
] device.    This prevents  ground  loops  in  systems where appropriate
] attention has not  been paid to grounding issues,  such as the case of
] typical musicians in a typical club!

] Some hints for testing your circuit
] ===================================
] 
] 1]	Check  *all* connections (use a   continuity  tester, and tick
] 	them off on a printout of the circuit).
] 
] 2]	Check them again ;-)
] 
] 3]	Make sure you   have  the   latest (GUS0012.zip) windows  midi
] 	driver, and make sure it is installed properly.
] 
] 4]	Make sure  your  midi sequencer package is  set  up to use the
] 	Ultrasound Midi In/Out  ports. (As  opposed to the  Ultrasound
] 	Synth)
] 
] 5]	If you still have no joy,
] 
] 	a] 	Just  connect  the +5V and GND  to your midi  circuit,
] 		(leave  the d-connector  pins  12 and 15 unconnected),
] 		and then connect pin  13 of the  7404 to +5V check you
] 		have  (about) +5V  appearing on   pin 10.  This checks
] 		midi out.
]     
] 	b]	Connect pin  4 of the midi-in  DIN  socket via 2 extra
] 		220R resistors  to +5V.  Check pin 4  of the 7404.  It
] 		should be low (about 0V).  Then connect pin  4 of  the
] 		midi-in DIN socket to 0V. Pin 4  of the 7404 should go
] 		high.  This checks midi in.
]     
] 	c]	Reconnect the d-type  pins  12 and  15, and connect  a
] 		midi cable  between midi-out  on the circuit  and  and
] 		midi-in on your synth.   Set up your sequencer  to use
] 		the Ultrasound MIDI port as an output, and ensure that
] 		one of the tracks is set to use this port.  Check your
] 		synth  is expecting MIDI data  on the same channel  as
] 		sequencer is transmitting.   Start sequencer  playing.
] 		Check that midi data is being transmitted at pin 12 of
] 		the   d-type (look at   it  with  an  oscilloscope, if
] 		possible).

18] What are *.PAT *.VOC *.WAV *.SND *.MOD *.669, and *.MID files, and
	how do I use them?

Written by: Matthew E. Bernold <MEB117@PSUVM.PSU.EDU>
] 
] 	These are all different types of sound files.
] 
] 	  *.PAT files  are GUS instrument files, or  PATCH files.  These
] files are what your GUS uses to recreate the various instruments it is
] capable of playing.  Your .PAT files should be in  your /ULTRASND/MIDI
] and /ULTRASND/SBOS directories.
] 
] 	  *.VOC  and *.WAV  files  are  basic digital sound   files with
] headers.  The *.VOC files are used on the soundblaster,  and the *.WAV
] files are  used by Microsoft Windows.  Players  capable of using these
] formats  can read  information on  sampling rate,  8 or   16 bit,  and
] mono/stereo from the header of these files.  *.WAV files can be played
] in MS Windows by many programs.  *.VOC files can be converted to *.WAV
] by many different programs, including SOX which is  available via FTP.
] The latest version (7.0) has been ported to PC clones and can be found
] on the GUS FTP sites.
] 
] 	  *.SND files  are  raw sound  files with no header information.
] This is  the format currently used  by the GUS.   This means  that you
] have to    tell the  player  program about  the   sample,  because the
] information on how to play it is NOT in  the file, like with the *.VOC
] or *.WAV files.  You can  play these files using  PLAYFILE  which came
] with the GUS.
] 
] 	  *.MOD files are 4-voice 15  or 31 instrument music files which
] originated on the Amiga.  They use 8-bit, 16kHz samples to produce the
] instruments, and note information to play the songs.  *.MOD  files are
] similar to MIDI files,  but  they are a bit  more flexible because you
] can use  any   sample  as an instrument   (including  voices and sound
] effects) instead  of  relying  on  the  MIDI  synth's  own  built   in
] instruments.  You can play these files using GUSMOD which can be found
] on epas.
] 
] 	  *.669 files are 8-voice music files.  I  don't know much about
] them, so maybe Tran  (author of the  GUS 669 player)  can fill in this
] area.  You can play these files  using P669GU0  which can  be found on
] epas.
] 
] 	  *.MID files are MIDI  files.  You can  play these  files  with
] PLAYMIDI that came with the Ultrasound package, or with MediaPlayer in
] MS Windows.  You might have to  create a *.cfg file for  the MIDI file
] if it was originally created for a synth that does  not conform to the
] GM Midi standard.

19] What exactly is GUS 3D?

	First and foremost: YES, this is SOFTWARE.   You will NOT need
to upgrade your GUS to be able to do the GUS-3D stuff.

Written By: dionf@ERE.UMontreal.CA (Francois Dion)
] 
] 	  There are several systems that are in  use to get 3D sounds on
] recordings and some have been around since the 50s. Now i wont go into
] the "how  it works" of  the more recent ones,  but i  think this  will
] clear up some confusion.  The first  part is  a "hands-on" experiment,
] the second is informations,  including  the  address and  phone of the
] owner of the technology that is used with the Gravis Ultrasound.
] 
] 	  Let's get back to the early days of stereo. One record company
] (i cant seem to remember) was pushing it, while another (again, blank.
] anyone?)   competed.   Interestingly enough, technological development
] was put on stereo,  and not on  the first  3D system which was  called
] "binaural recording" and it simply consisted of two microphones placed
] like the ears. You can try it this way:
] 
] 	  Go  to a hat  store and  buy an extruded  foam mannequin head.
] You'll then need two microphones. Condenser will do, but you will need
] to power them if you  want to use  them with the GUS,  since it take a
] dynamic microphone because it does not supply phantom  power like some
] mixer with  XLR plugs. I  will post a  circuit   later for Radio-shack
] condenser mike unit (a small element  that cost  about 2$) if there is
] some interest. If you dont  want to mess with  that, go with a cardiod
] dynamic element.  Note that sensitive  enough cardiod will cost  you a
] lot, so think about that.  You cut holes in the  ears of the head,  to
] insert the microphone  units (dont forget   to make the   wires of the
] elements go inside the head and out the  rear  (or wherever). Use glue
] to fill the crack  around the mic.  Also,  the more the ears look like
] real ears, the better it will work. If  you trim the foam, dont forget
] to use an hairdryer to soften it (it will be more uniform). That's it.
] Try recording  sounds, and  you'll  be surprised.  I  was! I  did  the
] experiment  with a  polystyrene head  on   which  i incrusted  two PZM
] microphones.
] 
] 	  Now that you  understand how  3D   recording  is nothing  like
] stereo recording, we'll see what is accesible presently.
] 
] 	  First, the gadget we just built in  the previous section exist
] commercially,  and is called "Mikey" and   is made by Spherical Sound.
] It's the only  system commercialised where the microphones  are placed
] in a head.
] 
] 	  Another system is made by Virtual Audio  and claims to enhance
] stereo depth, but is not labeled 3D audio. I dont  have much more info
] on it, but  from the description  it looks like the  same thing as the
] "mikey".
] 
] 	  Two other systems use  less restraining  microphones situation
] and can also be used on any signal because a DSP  simulate a 3D signal
] from  parameters  entered  on  the   machine.  QSound (no hyphen)  was
] developped in  Quebec, and the  inventor sold  the concept to  another
] company (Archer it seems). It is not that good even with electrostatic
] headphones, and is pretty bad if you are listening to it thru speakers
] and you  are not in the soft   spot. And  for trivia: Madonna,  Sting,
] Wilson Phillips and Paula Abdul to name a few  have used the QSound on
] their latest recordings. Another trivia: The Q logo is very very close
] to  Hydro-Quebec  logo... QSound   cost around  18K$   and is not midi
] controllable.
] 
] 	  The other  variant with a  DSP  is  Roland  RSS (Roland  Sound
] Space). It is a bit better (depending on how it  is  used) than QSound
] with  headphones, but suffers the  same faith as  QSound  when you are
] listening  with speakers. Just  move  a  bit  from the soft  spot, and
] suddenly what was  in front left is now  back  left. RSS was  used  on
] Suzanne Cianni _Hotel Luna_ album.  RSS  cost around 40K$  and is midi
] controllable.
] 
] 	  Another  system on which  i have  zero  information is  called
] Audio Cybernetics.
] 
] 	  The  last technology  is  called Focal Point  3D Audio. It was
] developped  by Bo Gehring  and first used  on the  Macintosh computers
] with a modified Audiomedia (Digidesign). It cost around 1400$  in this
] configuration. But, Gravis saw that (Focal Point  is from Seattle) and
] it is the system that we will be getting. At a  much better price. The
] system produce the sounds  with these parameters: direction, elevation
] and distance.  I  am pretty sure that  Gravis will have  to  develop a
] SYSEX command set. We already need it badly, but with 3D, i will shoot
] myself if i cant control it thru sysex.
] 
] 	  By the way, here's how  to  get in touch  with Focal Point  3D
] Audio, if you're interested.
] 
] 	Focal Point(tm) 3D audio
] 	1402 Pine av., #127
] 	Niagara Falls, NY 14301
] 	Voice/fax: 1-416-963-9188
] 
] 	  Ok,  you have read the 3D  thing, and you  cant wait. You want
] big sound. The only possibility for now is surround. Now surround cost
] a lot of money, and it will not be useable anymore once you get the 3D
] driver. Wrong.
] 
] 	 Now, i hope you have an amplifier, cause if you dont, you can't
] use  this little hack  to  get  surrounding  sound. WARNING: i  am not
] responsible  for  any  damage  resulting  from  the  use or  misuse or
] anything else  related to this circuit.  Check that your  - posts  are
] connected  to ground and   not  the +. If it's  the   case reverse the
] connections to the amplifier.

20] What exactly is Wavetable Synthesis?

Written By: dionf@ERE.UMontreal.CA (Francois Dion)
] 
] 	  It  is easier to find   the Holy Grail  than  to  find a  text
] describing precisely what synthesis method the GUS uses,  so it's time
] i take a shot at it. For this text  i  have searched thru ftp archives
] troughout   the   world, have asked    info  from   Ensoniq,   Roland,
] TurtleBeach, Advanced Gravis, Forte Creative Labs and i also took into
] account the numerous comments, praise and flames  i received  to model
] the text. Since  this text is a result  of  a collective internet  and
] industry wisdom, flames will go the way of /dev/nul.  And please, read
] the text carefully, because i  have received some comments from people
] who were thinking i wrote something when in fact i wrote  the opposite
] (particularly from non anglophones).
] 
] 	  You  probably  have heard about  the   GUS beeing a  wavetable
] soundcard.  I have  received some comments that the  GUS is not such a
] thing,  but since the  industry uses  this term  (i.e. CL waveblaster,
] GUS, TB multisound etc...), i am not in a position to create confusion
] by renaming the technology.  Wavetable explains perfectly  what it is.
] A table containing a waveform.
] 
] 	  The  GUS uses the third  generation of wavetable synthesis, so
] before   i  start  explaining  it,  i'll  talk   about   the first two
] generations first.
] 
] 	  The first   generation of wavetable  synthesis was  actually a
] _digitally_ controlled    _analog_ oscillator(s)     where  parameters
] controlling the waveform were kept in memory. The curtis  based synths
] and some others are directly derived from this concept.
] 
] 	  The second  generation of  wavetable synthesis uses  a digital
] oscillator, with the  waveform held in memory in  it's basic form (one
] period usually).    Parameters to alter   the oscillator behaviour are
] also in memory.  I  use  the general   term "memory"  instead of  RAM,
] because in  some  case   it's  actually ROM,  FlashROM,  PROM,  EPROM,
] switches, buffers etc... The Ensoniq chip found  in the Macintosh Plus
] is an example (8 bit, 4 oscillators, 4096 byte wavetable).
] 
] 	  The third generation of wavetable synthesis which can be found
] in two  flavors (RAM or ROM) is  based on the  second generation,  but
] uses bigger wavetables  to hold the  waveform (either in single period
] or multi period format) including this time the attack and release. In
] this  section, i will   focus only on   the  GUS implementation, which
] basically  encompass all other  implementations.  Basically, what  you
] have  are 32 oscillators  which can do the  exact  same  thing, and be
] programmed separately and/or simultaneously. What  the hardware can do
] without the  operating system is not  too important here since  we are
] looking at what the GUS _can_presently_do_ (with modifications  to the
] OS,  the GUS could do pretty  much any synthesis  method one can dream
] up),  not what it  would  have done  if  the OS wasn't  available.  Of
] course, more  processing done in  hardware means  more CPU cycles left
] for other things.
] 
] 	  So in the GUS, you have some RAM (up to 1Mb)  that holds 1, 2,
] 3, etc,  wavetables which consist  of a sampled  (or soft-synthesised)
] waveform, some parameters and optionally a sampled attack and release.
] Vhe GF1 ahip  (an asic based  on  the Ensoniq DOC-II chip)   will then
] playback a waveform  when triggered based  on   some parameters  it is
] given, and on others it will fetch from the wavetable. I  dont know if
] all parameters can be fetched from RAM by the GF1, nor  if the GF1 can
] fetch some instructions from RAM, but by using the current OS built in
] the windows  drivers or  in  the  DOS library,  this is  what  the GUS
] _can_presently_use_ to synthesise music:
] 
] 	- sampled or envelopped attack in 8/16 bit, signed/unsigned
] 		format *

] 	  Also,   reverb,   flanger, phasing  etc...   could  be  easily
] implemente within the drivers. Presently it can be done with  a little
] work  on the patches and/or   midi timestamp (i have succesfully  made
] flanger and phasing).   Another thing  that  could  be  implemented is
] dynamic patch loading since the card supports it (i have done it). You
] can even get a distorted sound (ideal for guitars, vox, analog synths)
] by  simply  changing    the  2's complement    flag (work   best  with
] soft-synthesised patches).
] 
] 	  Last, it is far  better to have  a RAM wavetable synth  than a
] ROM one, since  you can upload your samples.  Even sound canvas owners
] (and other synths too)  complain that their  ROM based  GS synth lacks
] interesting drum and bass  sounds,  cannot play sound  effects, and is
] not usable  for dance and techno.  Also  you can  have more  space for
] each samples,  because you always  have only the  samples you  need in
] memory, so you can have better sampling rates and better waveforms.

21] Is there a GUS device driver for Linux/BSD386/*IX?

	There is a group of people working on device drivers and C
libraries for Linux, BSD386, 386bsd, Minix, SysVR3/386, and whatever
other PC/UNIX flavors there are out there.

	If you'd like to be on the mailing list with this group, mail
to this address:

	pugd-request%itchy@dsd.es.com

	(PUGD stands for PC/UNIX GUS Driver.  It's silly, but I was
pressed for time. :)

22] I'm having trouble joining the Ultrasound Daily Digest...

	If you've  mailed to ultrasound-request@dsd.es.com and haven't
received a    reply     within  48  hours,    then    send   mail   to
ultrasound-owner@dsd.es.com.  The mailer at  dsd.es.com sometimes  has
trouble  understanding some of  the more  relatively remote systems on
the net, so I have to kludge it by hand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

23] How do I get the GUS to work with OS/2?

	As  of now, there is no  OS/2  specific  device driver for the
GUS.  However, there is a mailing list  specifically for GUS  and OS/2
users.  The list discusses how  to use the  two together, and  there's
also a group  of people on the  list working on a  device driver.   If
you'd like to join the list, mail to:

	gus-os2-request%itchy@dsd.es.com

	There are a few simple tricks to get the GUS to work with OS/2
to a small degree right now:

Written by: Thomas Wong <twong@civil.ubc.ca>
]
]	  As it is right now, what you'll have to do is use a 8  bit DMA
] channel in your setup  of  the GUS to make it  work under a DOS window
] under OS/2.  If you have already  installed/setup your  GUS card, just
] go  into the c:\autoexec.bat file under  OS/2  and manually change the
] number in the environment variable.   So, for example, use DMA channel
] #1.  By doing this, you can now  use playmidi, 669 player, gusmod... a
] number of GUS programs. But  you still can't run playfile  or SBOS (it
] may crash).  In other words, you can  use a play  a list of midi, 669,
] mod...etc files in a DOS window, but can't play games.  Gravis did say
] they will come out with an OS/2 driver but no date is set.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

24] How do I go about programming the GUS?

	First off, go to the FTP sites and get the two UltraDox files
written by Phat Tran.  Read them carefully, learn to love them.

	There have been  folks who have written MSDOS  C libraries for
GUS work... they may have actually uploaded the code to one of the FTP
sites by now.

	(If you want to use the GUS with another OS besides MSDOS,
read questions #21 and #23.)

	That's the   best  place  to  start.    There's rumors about a
development kit   from  Gravis  that    you  don't  have   to   sign a
non-disclosure agreement to use... we'll keep you posted.

25] What are the pinouts for the CD Audio IN on the GUS?

Written by: <grtorlba@seattleu.edu>
]
] 	  About two days   ago  I  posted requested  some  info  on  the  
] 4-pin CD audio pin on the GUS.  I never got a reply but I got the info
] by downloading volume 1 of  the  digest.   I looked at  the FAQ and it
] wasn't there.  Would you add  that bit in the  GUS  FAQ so that others
] should not have to go through what I had to?
] 
] 	The pin info was:
] 
]   left ground ground right
] 
] 	  I've    tried this pin   assignment  and    it  seems to work.
] The articles  in the digest  pointed out that  they weren't certain of
] the left-right  assignment  but   the   two pins  in  the  middle  are
] definitely the grounds.

26] I'm having trouble with... GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS

Written by: john.smith@gravis.com (John Smith)
]
] 	It looks like a lot of the problems are incorrect
] installations.
]  
] 	  Make  sure  that  you   put  ALL  the  correct   files in  the
] /ultrasnd/sbos  directory  and  remove   any  old   ones. Sbosdrv.exe,
] Loadsbos.exe and Sboslib.sbs  MUST    all  be from the  same   release
] revision. They are NOT mixable. A  lot of the  problems you are seeing
] could happen if the wrong driver is used with the new loader and patch
] library.  To make  sure you are  using  the correct files,  delete ALL
] files  from  /ultrasnd/sbos. Then unzip  the new release into the sbos
] directory. Then COPY sbosdrv.exe up to  the /ultrasnd directory.  Then
] COPY loadsbos.exe up to the /ultrasnd directory also.  Now pick either
] sboslo.bat or  sboshi.bat up to  /ultrasnd/sbos.bat.   These two batch
] files assume you  are  using emm386. If  you are using  another memory
] manager (like qemm, 386max  etc), use the appropriate command  to load
] it into  high memory.  (NOTE: If you  installed  your software in some
] other directory, substitute it in place of /ultrasnd).
]
]	Not all of the  tips below apply to  all programs. This is  just
] a brief summary of some of the things we had to  do  to get some games
] running properly.
] 
]	  1)  Make  sure the  BLASTER  environment  string  tracks   our
] ULTRASND string. Many  games look at BLASTER  to  set  up their stuff.
] SBOS  needs ULTRASND. If they  are  not the  same,   the  game will be
] looking one place and SBOS will  using another. This is another reason
] NOT to have an SB and GUS in the same system. Presumably, the SB would
] want BLASTER set up for it and any game  looking at  it would not work
] with SBOS. BLASTER is set up like this:
] 
]     BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T1
]               |    |  |  |
]               |    |  |  -  Type of SB (1 = regular SB)
]               |    |  ----- DMA channel (MUST be 1)
]               |    -------- IRQ used.     (same as GUS midi irq)
]               ------------- I/O base address
] 
] 	  This variable is set up by the GUS setup  program.  It should
] never need to be modified unless you modify ULTRASND by hand.
] 
]	  For example, wolf3d  looks at BLASTER to  get its  parameters.
] Sound will NOT function if the IRQs are different,  but it will detect
] an Adlib.
] 
]	  2) Make sure  that SBOS is  up and running  BEFORE you install
] your  game. Some games configure  themselves during their installation
] procedure. If SBOS is  not  running, it will  assume there is no sound
] board present.
] 
]	  3)  Some  games have  a  separate setup/configuration section.
] Make  sure  you  run  this  after you install   the game OR change the
] ULTRASND variable. They  are usually called setup, install  or config.
] Look around for it. Some games also save the last configuration to use
] the next time the game is run. This means that if it didn't detect the
] card (because  SBOS wasn't loaded),  it will save  that info  and will
] start up the NEXT time with sound disabled. You will  have to manually
] turn sound  back on somehow.    See your games  manual. For   example,
] Wolf-3d will do this.
] 
]	  4) Some    games need all  available  RAM  to run.  Since SBOS
] currently takes approximately 19K, it may not have enough to run. Some
] games will shut off  some of the  sounds if  RAM is short.  Check your
] manual. It may also be necessary to load SBOS high  to reclaim some of
] the RAM.
] 
]	  5) If you have poor performance with SBOS loaded,  see  if you
] have an expanded memory manager  running.   (qemm, 386max, emm386 etc)
] There is  a SEVERE  performance penalty  to  be  paid if you  run with
] these. Its  a byproduct  of  your machine  running in  protected mode.
] Usually, only games that use direct I/O (mod players  for example) are
] seriously effected by this. If  you must have  SBOS loaded  high, then
] you will have to live with this. It is possible to disable the virtual
] DMA if you are using qemm. (NOVDS) Doing  so should speed  things up a
] bit.
] 
]	  6) It is possible for an  application to detect the Adlib side
] of the GUS without SBOS being loaded. It depends on the method it uses
] to detect it. Obviously if that happens, the application will think it
] has an Adlib, but nothing is going to work.
] 
]	  7) Many games need to  detect (and use)  extended/expanded RAM
] before some sounds will be  activated  (usually digitized stuff) Refer
] to  your manual for  these  kind of  problems.  An SB will not operate
] properly under these conditions either.  For  example, Falcon III will
] not play digitized  sounds  until EMS is  set  up properly.  SBOS  has
] nothing to do with this problem.
] 
] 	  8)   Some   games hard  code   their  I/O  address  and/or irq
] selections. Refer  to your  manual.  You will have to   make the  GUS'
] selections  match these. I believe  some Sierra games  do this.   Wing
] Commander requires a base port of address of 220 for digital speech to
] work.
] 
]	  9)  Unless you are POSITIVE  that a   particular game needs an
] option, (-o1 -o2 etc) DON'T specify one, 99%  of the games do NOT need
] one. You may  screw up the  driver  by  specifying one that you  don't
] need.   You should unload and  reload  the driver before specifying an
] option. Since it is possible to  use more  than one option, you may be
] telling it conflicting things if you don't unload it.
]
]	  10) There are several new features in SBOS  that you should be
] aware of:
] 
]		1) SBOS reloads  its  patches  before  an  application
]	runs.   This should eliminate   having to reload   it  between
]	running windows or a  native  GUS application (GUSMOD Star Con
]	II, playmidi etc) and a game that uses SBOS.
] 
]		2)  You  can change  the  vector   that it  uses   for
]	communicating  between  sbosdrv.exe and   loadsbos.exe.    The
]	option is  -Cxx,  where xx is the  new software vector to use.
]	This is specified to sbosdrv.   Currently,  only 1 application
]	is known to need  this.  Netroom uses  the default vector (7E)
]	so  sbosdrv  thinks it is already  loaded.   If you  are using
]	netroom, you MUST  change the vector #.   Netroom is  the only
]	application that we know of that has  this problem.  There may
]	be others.  We don't know of ANY games that do.
] 
]		3) You can   tell  SBOS to  leave line-in  enabled  by
]	specifying a -L when SBOS is loaded. This can be useful if you
]	want to monitor some other audio output source thru the GUS.
] 
]	  11) The volume up and down keys (defaults are [  and ]) do not
] work in all games. Any game that takes  over the keyboard vectors will
] disable this feature. You must use the -V option when loading  sbos to
] alter the volume  for these games.  This  option works like this: -vxx
] where  xx ranges from   0 to 31 (31   being max volume) Note: in  SOME
] versions  prior to 1.4B2,   hitting the volume   keys would hang  your
] system. This has been fixed.
]
]	  12) Some games grab all possible SB irqs (2,5 and 7) when they
] initialize to find what IRQ the SB is on.   If they  do this with SBOS
] and SBOS happens to have the UltraSound IRQ on one of  the SB irqs, it
] will not let SBOS  get its irq. Make sure  that you set the UltraSound
] irq to one of the upper ones (11,12 or 15). Jill  of  the Jungle is an
] example of a game that exhibits this problem.
] 
]	  13) Now for some simple things to look for.
] 
]	a) Is board seated properly?
]	b) Is DRAM in sockets correctly (bent pins etc)?
]	c) Are stereo/speakers hooked up properly?
]	d) Are you connected to the right outputs on GUS?
]		(Some Ultrasound boxes are labeled wrong ...)

] 
]		BOTTOM OF ULTRASOUND
]		====================
]
]	e) Do you have enough environment space for ULTRASND
]		and BLASTER variables?
]	f) Did you set the volume too low?
]	g) Is \ultrasnd in your path?
]	h) Could you have gotten a bad download of new SBOS?
]
]	  14) Several  people  have  complained  about sbos loading VERY
] slowly.  Is your  joystick or MIDI plugged in?  Try unplugging it.  As
] of  now, we  haven't been able to reproduce   this problem.  It may be
] related to installing the software incorrectly or a DMA conflict.
] 
]	  15) If your joystick doesn't  operate properly in a game, look
] for these things.
] 
]	a) Has it been calibrated (see manual)
]	b) Do you have 2 games ports in your system? (GUS and another
]		game port). If so, one MUST be disabled.
]	c) DO you have a line like the following in your autoexec
] 
] joycomp 20
] 
]		where 20 is the compensation factor determined thru the
]		calibration utility, ultrajoy.
] 
]	  16) There are several things  people have noticed that seem to
] effect  SBOS that need to be   investigated. None of these  have  been
] verified, but   you should  be   aware  of  them  and  you  might  try
] eliminating them as possible sources of your problem.
] 
]	1) Loading SBOS hi can cause some FM stuff to sound 'weird'.
]	2) Using  'Stealth' mode on QEMM  seems  to have a detrimental
]		effect.
]	3) Change sbos.bat file to  use  loadhi instead of lh if using
]		QEMM.
]	4) Stacker seems  to cause some  people problems.  It works OK
]		for others.
]	5) Order that TSR's are loaded may have an effect. Try loading
]		SBOS first, last etc.
]	6) When using XWing make sure that  you have at  least 896K of
]		EMS  (not XMS) and 563K  of  conventional.  If you are
]		having problems with  slowdowns  try  turning off  the
]		music.
]
]	  17) The only other thing we can think of is a hardware problem
] on your card. The diagnostics in the  new setup program should be able
] to isolate it.
] 
]	  Granted, we are  a bit biased, but  we believe that you should
] get SUPERB  sound  out of your  GUS.  If  you are  getting   less than
] satisfactory results, there can only be a few explanations.
] 
]	1) in windows, make sure its in 'high fidelity' mode.
]	2) Incorrect software installation.
]	3) Incorrect hardware installation (IRQ,DMA etc) (probably)
]	4) Bad hardware.(PC or GUS)

27] I can't seem to fit the new disks onto a floppy.

	First of all, the files need to go on to a HD 3.5" disk.

	Next, some of the disks were zip'ed a second time to include a
small README  file  (in other words,  the   .zip   file you downloaded
contains two files: a README file, and another .zip file).  This would
have been a good idea, except the .zip file got bigger;  too big for a
HD 3.5" disk.  So, you'll need to unzip the file, read the README, and
copy the new .zip file to a floppy.
