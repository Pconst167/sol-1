Intro
-----
This is a list of mailing lists available primarily on the UUCP
network. A mailing list is different from a newsgroup because you do
not receive anything unless you specifically request it. To be added to
a mailing list, please mail a note to the contact for that list, listed
below.

Some of the lists mentioned may be available as limited-distribution
newsgroups.  Contact the administrator for exact details.

Please note the following caveats: publication of a list here does not
guarantee that you will be allowed to join as a member.  That is up to
the moderator and readers, and they have the right to restrict access
to their list as they see fit. Mailing lists use MUCH less system
overhead on a world-wide basis but do tend to increase loading on the
moderators' machines so the number of people that can be added to a list
may be limited by machine resources as well.

The Network Information Systems Center maintains a list of mailing
lists that exist primarily on the Internet.  That list overlaps this
one in a few places, but the lists are largely distinct.  A copy of
that list may be obtained by anonymous ftp from the site
ftp.nisc.sri.com (192.33.33.53) in the file "netinfo/interest-groups".
To add or delete an entry to that list, mail to
interest-group-request@nisc.sri.com.  If you cannot ftp a copy of the
list, and you are a CSnet subscriber, you can get a copy from the
CSnet info-server; mail to cic@sh.cs.net for instructions.

If you have a list that you want added to this posting or are interested in
starting a list but don't know how, drop me a note at spaf@purdue.edu

    artificial life, a formative interdisciplinary field involving

    others.  The recent book _Artificial Life_, Christopher Langton, ed.,
    Addison Wesley, 1989 introduces the scope of artificial life as a field
    of study.  Alife was chartered in February 1990 at the Second Artificial
    Life Workshop, held in Santa Fe & organized by the Center for Nonlinear
    Studies at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Santa Fe
    Institute.  The list is intended primarily for low-volume, high-content

    contents exhibit "legs." The depth of insight possible using the
    information mosaic method can be staggering. A form of electronic
    magazine, NewsCommando can serve as a reference tool, offer unique
    jump-off points for Medline, PaperChase, or other searches, and,
    in many ways, is the "poor-man's IdeaFisher/IdeaBank."  Vol. 1

       EarthWatch1: Defining the Scope of Environmental Destruction
       Why Euthanasia Must Never Be Legalized
