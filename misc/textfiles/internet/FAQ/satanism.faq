     This file is for all new readers of alt.satanism.

     Many groups of a `controversial' nature have noticed that new
     readers often come up with the same questions, misstatements or
     misconceptions and post them to the net.  The purpose of this
     file is to prevent continual restatement of previously debated--
     often several times debated--topics.

     This isn't to say that these things are not subject to further
     debate.  It is to say that these things *have* been considered by
     the readers here.  If you have something significant to add to
     the debate on a particular topic then please do post.

     Contributors to date are:

1.   What is Satanism?
     At first glance this may look like a simple question to answer:  "Go
     look it up in the dictionary." would seem to be straightforward
     enough.  In fact, I'll do it for you:

          Satanism, n.  1.  the worship of Satan or the powers of
          evil.  2.  a travesty of Christian rites in which Satan
          is worshipped.  3.  diabolical or satanic disposition,
          behavior, or actions.

     [from _Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English
     Language_, (c) 1989]

     Unfortunately it's not that easy.  There is no one set of beliefs that
     comprise Satanism.  Because there is no set of doctrines or scriptures
     agreed upon by a majority of Satanists, would-be practitioners must
     define their beliefs for themselves, based upon a minimum of shared
     information.  The issue is further confused by the fact that,
     historically, most records of real or imagined Satanism have been made
     by Satanists' traditional enemies, Christians.  However a few
     generalizations can be made:  the average Satanist disagrees with much
     of Christianity, believes in no absolute moral code, and places
     emphasis on the individual and personal rights.  If you think this
     sounds like Libertarianism, you're right; many Satanists consider
     themselves Libertarians or feel close to the party on social issues.

     There are several divisions one could make as to the belief systems of
     various "Satanic" groups. This (arbitrary) division is made more to 
     outline some belief systems than to categorize groups. Most defy 
     categorization. The Process Church, for example, is surely a gnostic 
     group, but neither of the two listed fit the Process very well.
     Actually, looking these categories over yet again, I realize that
     most groups fall into several of the categories, so perhaps the only
     utility of this categorization is to show some of the main influences
     or "currents" in modern-day Satanism.
     
          1.  The Dabblers:  adopt Satanic trappings for a brief
          period of time, usually for entertainment rather than
          serious purposes. Many modern youths fall into this category.
          2. Churches of Satan: are patterned after the teachings of
          Anton LaVey. These groups believe in individualism, gratification
          of the ego, self-reliance and the ideal of the Nietzchean Superman.
          These groups use Magick as a tool for earthly power. They see
          Satan as the driving force behind achievment in mankind. 
          The two main organizations in this category are the Church of 
          Satan and the Temple of Set. The two groups differ philosophically 
          and organizationally. 

          3. Gnostics: can be divided into two major categories 
          3a. Promethian Gnostics: Believe in a literal "Satan", but believe 
          that the creator of the world (Jehovah) is the evil deity. Satan is
          seen as the "bringer of light"; a beneficient god. This is an old
          "heresy" seen in groups such as the Yezidis.
          3b.  Dark Gnostics:  Worship the dark force in nature. These groups
          follow the whims of a capricious god, which most westerners would
          see as being "evil." There are a few historical christian heresies
          which would fall into this category. Kali worshippers could also
          be categorized here.

          4.  Secondary Satanists:  follow a faith outside the Christian
          mainstream. Most would not consider themselves as being "Satanic"
          and strictly speaking should not be defined as satanists (as per se
          with some of the Gnostic groups), but the ignorant often categorize
          them as Satanists. Voodoun and Santiera could be grouped here, as
          could medeaval wicca (if it actually existed).
          
          5. Hellfire Clubs: Were a phenomenon of the 18th century. The
          first of these was founded by the Duke of Wharton in the early
          1700's. Most infamous was sir Francis Dashwood's Medmenham club
          (Often incorrectly called the hellfire club). Dashwood was a
          close freind of Benjamin Franklin, who may have been a member of
          this group. Franklin's description of the Medmeham club's
          secret chambers is one of the few we have, so his membership seems
          likely. In any case, Dashwood and Franklin co-authored the "Franklin
          Prayer Book" (often called the Book of Common Prayer) which is 
          commonly used in america. Another famous member of the Medmanham club
          was the Earl of Sandwich, inventor of (guess what) the Sandwich.
          Hellfire clubs were exclusive groups dedicated to much political
          intrigue, partying, and some occasional occult activities.

          6. Left-Hand Path Pagans
          There are several European groups, most of them consisting of small
          "covens" of several people, that are or could be considered
          Satanists. Two of the larger of these groups are Balder and the
          Order of Nine Angles (ONA). These groups allegedly have longer
          traditions, and "more authentic" origins (whatever that might mean).
          ONA is especially fond of calling itself the "traditional Satanists."
          These groups tend to have more "extreme" views than the others 
          mentioned, and have little, if any authoritarian structure. Some
          allege these groups do not exist, but they answer my mail.          

2.   What is _The Satanic Bible_?

     _The Satanic Bible_ is a book describing the philosophy of Anton
     LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan.  This organization holds the
     view that there is no higher god than oneself, and that one should
     worship accordingly.  Life is the Great Indulgence and Death is the
     Great Abstinence, as there is no afterlife.  The basic ideas of _The
     Satanic Bible_ are laid out in the Nine Satanic Statements:

          1.  Satan represents indulgence, instead of abstinence!
          2.  Satan represents vital existence, instead of
          spiritual pipe dreams!

          3.  Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of
          hypocritical self-deceit!

          4.  Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it,
          instead of love wasted on ingrates!

          5.  Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the
          other cheek!

          6.  Satan represents responsibility to the responsible,
          instead of concern for psychic vampires!

          7.  Satan represents man as just another animal,
          sometimes better than, more often worse than those that
          walk on all fours, who, because of his "divine
          spiritual and intellectual development," has become the
          most vicious animal of all!

          8.  Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they
          all lead to physical, mental, or emotional
          gratification!

          9.  Satan has been the best friend the church has ever
          had, as he has kept it in business all these years!

     _The Satanic Bible_ can be found (in America) in most chain bookstores
     in the New Age, Philosophy, or Religion sections.
     
     Many non-U.S. readers have written that _The Satanic Bible_ is not
     available in their country for various reasons. I suggest dealing with
     The Abyss bookstore (Address & phone# listed at the end of the FAQ) or
     writing/phoning the publisher directly. (Special thanx to the Italian
     fellow who came up with these addresses & phonenumbers)

3.   What about the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set?

     The Church of Satan can be contacted at:

          Church of Satan
          P.O. Box 210082
          San Francisco, CA 94121

     $100 will get you a lifetime membership.  Contrary to popular opinion,
     the Church is not tax-exempt.  It turned down tax-exemption (despite
     being eligible) on the grounds that a church is a business and should
     not receive preferential treatment.

     Some people question whether the term "Satanism" is appropriate for
     the Church's beliefs, due to its atheistic stance.  Since the Church
     has been in existence for over 20 years its definition is probably
     here to stay, although it isn't the only definition.

     Are there other USA-based Satanic organizations?

     Yes.  The best-known and longest-lasting is the Temple of Set, founded
     by former Church of Satan members, especially Michael Aquino.  The Temple
     encourages members to apply Setian philosophy to their soul or psyche
     in the process of Xeper, which could be defined as "coming into being". 
     The goal is for the individual to achieve self-actualization and divinity.
     atmosphere than the Church of Satan. There is material on the Temple of
     Set archived in slopoke.mlb.semi.harris.com (as well as other files of
     interest to the occultist) and quartz.rutgers.edu (pub/magick/set)

     The Temple of Set can be contacted at:

          Temple of Set
          P.O. Box 470307
          San Francisco, CA 94147

      Recently, the Temple of Set has taken the stance that they are "not
      a Satanist organization" -other groups, such as the CoS and the ONA 
      have said this about the ToS for years, but because of their historical 
      association with the CoS I will continue to include them in the FAQ 
      (barring any future ToS objections to their inclusion herin).

4.   Satan is a Christian God!
     You aren't Satanists, just nasty atheists!

     Most (probably all) religions have gods or demons that represent the
     principle of adversity:  that which is forbidden by society.  Satan is
     one among these, originally conceived by the Hebrews long before the
     birth of Jesus.  The name first appears (in _The Bible_, at any rate)
     in the book of Job.  Satan was a fallen angel, not a god, in the
     monotheistic religions of Christianity and Islam.


     "Satan" is understood by most Satanists in a context different than
     that of Christian theology.  Satan is a powerful archetype, to the
     Euro-American Usenet majority at least, bringing to mind such things
     as sexuality, power, individualism and control over one's destiny. 
     The Satanist can choose what s/he likes from the varied portrayals of
     Satan, and may add principles of adversity from other cultures as
     well.

5.   Aren't Satanists ritualistic baby murderers?

     Some misleading reports exist about Satanists:  they are organized
     into nationwide cults; they commit ritual murders on a grand scale;
     they raise their children with psychological disorders; they kidnap
     people for blood sacrifice; they organize day-care centers and abuse
     the children placed in their care.  A whole class of books exists
     detailing the exploits of these Satanic groups.

     The problem with all these works is that they are fictional rather
     than truthful accounts.  Much is claimed based on scanty evidence that
     would be better explained by another scenario.  Claims of involvement
     with Satanism are made by patients under hypnosis (hypnotized subjects
     are notorious for their suggestibility and tendency to produce
     fictions).  Other "former Satanists" distort the truth in search of
     attention and money.  These sensationalists never go to the police
     regarding the criminal activities they allegedly took part in, which
     calls the veracity of their claims and the sincerity of their remorse
     into question.

     Evidence does not exist to support what is said to occur.  If the
     number of murders said to be committed by Satanists was accurate, some
     bodies should have been found by now.  While means have been suggested
     by which bodies could be concealed, it stretches the imagination to
     believe that every body has been successfully hidden thus.  Evidence
     in other areas is similarly lacking.

     Individuals investigating suspected Satanic crimes misinterpret what
     they find to fit their expectations.  The _Necronomicon_, published by
     Avon Books, is used as an authoritative guide to Satanic practices. 
     Yet few Satanists take the book seriously in any way, and none follow
     it to the letter.  This and other things lead some non-Satanists to
     see what simply is not there.

     The observant reader may note that there have been a few crimes linked
     to Satanism.  In all cases the criminal(s) worked alone with no
     connections to other groups.  Some cases have been publicized by the
     media as being related to Satanism when in fact they involve another
     religion, as in the Matamoros case, which involved some elements of
     Palo Mayombe (an African religion), and some rituals taken from popular
     motion pictures.

     The lesson to be learned is that although a book may appear in the
     "Non-fiction" section of a bookstore, that doesn't make it so.

     There is a copy of an FBI report on "occult crime" archived
     at slopoke.mlb.semi.harris.com   pub/magick/INCOMING/SATANISM/lanning.txt
     which shows what the FBI thinks of the claims of fundamentalists.

     The most definative book to date on the topic of rumors of Satanic
     cults involved in ritual murder/abuse is
     _Satanic Panic; the Creation of a Contemporary Legend_ by Jeffry
     S. Victor. Open Court Press, 1992

6.   Do Satanists have orgies?  If so, where do I sign up?

     Hmmm...I trust that some do, but I have been unable to locate any as
     of yet.

7.   What is Xian?  COS?  TOS?  TSB?
     Do you say "Xian" rather than "Christian" in order to insult
     Christianity?

     Some users in this and other newsgroups find themselves discussing
     Christianity frequently.  In order to cut down on keystrokes they type
     "Xian" and "Xianity" rather than the longer versions.  A few users may
     intend it partly as a slur, but most do it only for convenience.  The
     abbreviation itself is far from insulting; it is accepted and used by
     many Christians including (I am told) the Pope.

     A few other abbreviations occur frequently in this newsgroup.  They
     are normally defined in a conversation, but here they are for your
     convenience:

          CoS = Church of Satan
          ToS = Temple of Set
          TSB = _The Satanic Bible_
          OT  = Old Testament
          NT  = New Testament
          OLHP = Order of the Left Hand Path
          ONA = Order of the Nine Angles

8.   Have you considered the message of _The Bible_?

     Yes.  Most Satanists, along with most other members of Western
     cultures, are familiar with the teachings of Christianity and many
     have read _The Bible_ or part of it.  They simply consider _The Bible_
     to be false and disregard it much like Christians would disregard
     books which represent the foundation of another religion.  Attempting
     to discuss Christianity will, in most cases, only get you flamed and
     not inform the Satanist of "something they didn't know".  If you are
     still tempted to post about _The Bible_ because you feel that we may
     have missed an important point, I suggest you seek out and read the
     alt.atheism FAQ before proceeding.  Many of its points are applicable
     to alt.satanism.

9.   For the Christians among us:  should you feel inclined to preach.
     You are all going to hell.
     Jesus saves!

     Quite often, members of fundamentalist Christian groups see fit to
     post various evangelical messages in alt.satanism.  The reason for
     this is not clear.  It has been suggested by various members of this
     net, who I shall lump under the convenient category of "Satanist,"
     that the reason for this posturing is that many (perhaps most)
     Born-Again Christian types are closet masochists.  It has also been
     suggested that Christians need to save a certain number of souls to
     get a good seat in paradise, similar in spirit to selling candy-bars
     or magazines to fund various extra-curricular activities in school. 
     Presumably Satanist souls, being sold to the devil already, are worth
     more points.
          While these theories have some merit, considering the teachings
     of their (allegedly) chosen religion, an attempt should be made to be
     open-minded enough to see their side of things.
          Many Christians, when asked why they do this, respond something
     to the effect that it is charity, something they do out of the
     goodness of their hearts, out of concern for people etc. etc.  Well,
     if the Christian is really concerned with people, why not preach to
     those who have not heard the message?  Most "Satanists" are well
     acquainted with the messages of Christianity.  They have been preached
     to ad infinitum, and are fed up with it.  That is part of the reason
     they are Satanists instead of plain old agnostics.  Many Satanists are
     angered by such posts, and justifiably so.

     Now consider this:
          You will never convert a Satanist over USENET.  You either
               1) are too infuriating;
               2) look like a fool.

          There is NO logical reason to convert to Christianity.  The only
     appeals are to the emotions, and as stated before they either look
     foolish or infuriating.  Things like, "But Jesus LOVES you; he died
     for your sins!" or "Your soul is in danger!" are appeals to guilt and
     fear respectively; not reason.  As most Satanists have chosen this
     path out of reason, these appeals will never work.  As for those
     Satanists who are so for emotional reasons, their minds are as closed
     as that of the Born-again Christian.  Perhaps, if indeed preaching is
     done for humanitarian, and not egotistical or masochistic reasons,
     your energies are better spent educating those who know little of your
     faith: those born atheistic, communists, buddhists etc.  If, as
     suspected, your purposes are more egotistical (look reverend; I
     converted a Satanist!) forget it.  There are no "lost souls," waiting
     to be found in this community.
          For the masochistically inclined, we suggest self-flagellation. 
     It costs less disk space, is probably more satisfying, and is
     certainly less offensive to the general public.

     Otherwise; GROWL!  BOOGA BOOGA!  HASTUR, ASTAROTH, LEVIATHAN
     ISHTAR!!!!!!!!!  XILKA XILKA!  BESA BESA!  go away already...

          views of Satanism.

     _The Necronomicon_ [by the Mad Arab], Avon Books, 1977.
          Purported ritual book of great efficacy.  Generally regarded as
          fiction interspersed with translations of Mesopotamian texts. 
          Mileage may vary, depending on how seriously you take babble.
          This is included mainly because of its availablity and 
          popularity; I actually strongly recommend that you do _not_
          buy this.

     _The Necronomicon_ edited by George Hay 1978.
          This is a more "Lovecraftian" Necronomicon which closely follows
          what Lovecraft said was contained in the famous book of the Mad
          Arab. It is, of course, fiction, but much more fun than the Avon
          book in that it does not take itself so seriously. Scoob publishing
          is supposed to have a R'lyeh text in the works as a sequel to this.

(on and pertaining to Xtian fictions of Satanism)
     _Satanic Panic; the Creation of a Contemporary Legend_ by Jeffry
     S. Victor. Open Court Press, 1992
          This book is an excellent debunking of the many "evil satanist"
          rumors and legends that abound in rural and mainstream america.
          It shows the similarities between these rumors, and those of
          the inquisition, European anti-semetism, and the McCarthy red-scares.

     _The Satan Seller_, Mike Warnke's imagination, Logos International,
     1972.
          A Christian presents his alleged experiences in a Satanic cult
          before his conversion to Christianity. Has been exposed by
          fundamentalist journalists as a fraud. 

     _Cornerstone_, Volume 21, number 98, "Selling Satan," Jon Trott & Mike
     Hertenstein, 1992.
          This gets *highest* recommendation.  From a Christian magazine
          which does a great job of discrediting Mike Warnke's accounts
          mentioned in _The Satan Seller_ and elsewhere
     
     _Satanism: The Seduction of America's Youth_, Bob Larson, Thomas
     Nelson Publishers, 1989.
          The facts on the *conspiracy* now coming to a lonely town near
          you!!! (You're reading the FAQ, so it's already here!)
          [Lupo note: Apparently Bob Larson is going down the tubes faster
           than Warnke. See relevant files from Scott Minkuso]

     Following are a number of works recommended dealing with Satanism's
     links with crime, multiple personality disorder, etc.

     _The Satanism Scare_, ed. James T. Richardson, Joel Best, and David G.
     Bromley (NY: Aldine, 1991): 145-172.
     [Lupo note; though I have not yet read this book, the authors of the
      essays herin are enough to recommend this book]

     _Battle for the Mind_, by William Sargent, Harper & Row, 1957.

     _In Pursuit Of Satan_, by Robert D. Hicks (Prometheus Books),

     _Satanism In America_, issued by the Committee for the Scientific
     Examination of Religion.

          beforehand.]

     _Snapping; America's Epidemic of Sudden Personality Change_ by Flo
     Conway & Jim Siegelman.
          An interesting work utilizing information theory in the study of
          sudden personality change as occurs in religious cults, and the
          "Born-Again" phenomenon.

(Satan in art and Philosophy)
     _Paradise Lost_ by John Milton.
          An epic poem telling the tale of Lucifer from when he is thrown
          out of heaven, to the Fall of Adam and Eve. It makes Lucifer
          into a heroic figure, whilst God is made out to be a little vague
          and weak. 

     _The Divine Comedy_ by Dante.
          Another epic poem in three parts (Inferno, Purgatorio and
          Paradisio) covering the author's pilgrimage through them.

     _La-Bas (Down There)_ by J. K. Huysmans (1891?) translated by
     Keene Wallace.
          Fiction novel of the occult and the black mass in late
          nineteenth century Paris.

     H. P. Lovecraft, collected works.
          Classic horror fiction that has served as inspiration for many
          Satanists.

     Frederick Nietzsche, various works
     Nietzschean philosophies form the core of Satanism. Much of the _Satanic
     Bible_ owes its  philosophical and literary roots to works such as
     _Thus Spoke Zarastrutha_  and  _The Anti-Christ_ by  Nietzsche.


(weird stuff of interest to the Satanist)
     _Cosmic Trigger_ by Robert A. Wilson
          This book describes various initiations and occult phenomena
          experienced by Mr. Wilson. Good for promoting open-mindedness.
          Wilson writes some great fiction as well in his "Illuminatus"
          books. 
      
     _Apocalypse Culture_ collected by Adam Parfey.
          A shocking work, depicting the worldviews of various "fringe"
          sects and individuals, ranging from necrophiliacs to ultra-right
          wing Christians. Has an article by LaVey.

(Biblical debunking)
     _Who Wrote the Bible?_, by Richard Elliott Friedman, Harper & Row,
     1987.
          A biblical scholar attempts to answer the question of the title,
          and in the process comes up with some interesting reasons for
          events in _The Bible_ (why does Moses have horns? Why the scene
          with the golden calf?). An interesting read, and possibly 
          amusing for the cynic.

     _The Dead Sea Scrolls_
          There are many good books on this subject for those who need to
          debunk Christianity historically as well as philosophically. 
          Among them:

          _Dead Sea Scrolls & the Bible_ by Roland E. Murphy (a Roman
          Catholic at that) 1968

          _A Crack in the Jar; What ancient Jewish Documents tell
          us about the New Testament_ by Niel Fujita (also a
          Christian scholar) 1986

          _The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth_ by John
          Allegro (one of the original Dead Sea Scholars) 1984

          Note than all of the above scholars are of the old school of
          scroll study.  While all do a good job of debunking Christianity,
          the latest generation of scholarly works is even more damning.

11. Where can I get supplies?
    
    There are several "occult bookstores" who do mail order. Some
    are listed below;

    The Abyss  
    RR1 Box 213
    Chester MA 01011-9735
    413-623-2155  (FAX 413-623-2156)
    [comment by Lupo; This is where _I_ obtained most of my books. They have
     much that is of interest to the occultist. The catalogue is outstanding
     and much of the merchandise is underpriced. Excellent section of Crowley
     material, a decent LHP section, good selection of various occult 
     merchendise & books of all kinds. Highly recommended]
    
'Zines: (note; the Watcher is archived at slopoke and quartz ftp sites)
Also, I have not included prices of these 'zines for various reasons (mostly
greed on my part)- they usually run around $5 per issue. A later edition of
the FAQ will include price listings & self-descriptions of these groups
will be archived.

    _ABRASAX #4_ A magazine published by the American Gnostic Church.
    Issue #4 is dedicated to Satan & satanic matters generally.  They
    can be reached at:

               American Gnostic Church
               PO BOX 1219
               Corpus Christi, TX, 78403-1219

    Their next issue (Summer 93) is supposed to contain an objective comparison
    of the Temple of Set and the Church of Satan.

    Balder [Name of group, not 'zine]
    c/o Stephen Cox
    60 Elmhurst Road
    Reading, Berks
    RG15HY
    England, UK
    [Lupo note; Also advertised in various journals. My knowledge of them
     does not extend beyond their advert. They seem to be concerned with
     various Teutonic paths, sports magick, art & etc. YMMV] 

    The Black Flame (Journal of the Church of Satan)
    P.O. Box 499
    Radio City Station
    N.Y., N.Y. 10101
    [Lupo comments; I like the 'Zine, but it tends to suffer from typical
     Church of Satan dogmatism. It also seems quite expensive for its size.]

    Black Jackal (Embassat of Lucifer)
    P.O. Box 998
    Stewart, British Columbia
    VOT 1WO Canada
    [Lupo Comments; I know little of this 'zine; the _Black Flame_ gives
     it good reviews. YMMV]

    Dark Cycle; Australian Journal of Occultism
    P.O. Box 1639
    Chatswood NSW 2057 Australia
    [I have no idea]

    The Heretic (Formerly the Watcher and the Realist)
    P.O. Box 38-262
    Petone, Wellington, New Zealand
    [Lupo comments; This 'Zine gets highest praise from me as being the
     most eclectic of the 'Zines I have yet seen (which is really not
     saying much, I suppose). It is fairly long-lasted, has seen contributions
     from members of Balder, the CoS, independant Satanists, the OLHP 
     (which is the publisher), the ONA, and even the usually secretive ToS.
     The OLHP also carries several interesting books.]

    Onslaught
    Luciferian Light Group
    P.O. Box 7207
    Tampa, FL 33673
    [Lupo comments; Though they have advertised in various Satanic journals
     for some years now, I know nothing about this group, so YMMV. They have
     not answered any of my inquiries.]

    Order of Nine Angles
    Box 109
    Newport, Gwent, Wales, UK
    [Several pricey books, a "sinister" tarot deck, and a journal. The ONA
    was gracious enough to send me a microfilm containing all of their major
    works; I found them very impressive. I am in the midst of trying to obtain
    permission to copy and distribute this information, probably in the form
    of microfilm at first, hopefully in the form of LaTEX files at some
    later date.]
