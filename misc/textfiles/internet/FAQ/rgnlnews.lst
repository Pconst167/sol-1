Introduction
------------
There are a large number of regional hierarchies of newsgroups.
Most are very low volume.  The only high volume hierarchy is fj.*.

Where known, I have tried to list someone who *may* know more about the
hierarchy than I do.

Note that the "uunet" service carries most of these hierarchies.
Contact uunet!uunet-request for subscription details.

Also note -- the lists in this article are totally unofficial and
possibly incomplete or inaccurate.  I try to keep the lists up-to-date,
but make no guarantee that any of the information contained corresponds
with the named groups in any significant way.  Corrections and comments
should be mailed directly to me (asp@uunet.uu.net, uunet!asp).

This list is not for internal newsgroups that should not been seen
outside of your organization or university.  If any newsgroups are
listed here that should not be, please let me know & they will be
removed from the next posting of this list.

The following newsgroups have either changed or been added since the
last posting:

atl		dnet		gbg		nz		swnet
capdist		dtek		math		pnw		tor
chi		essug		mtl		rpi		triangle
cth		eunet		nordunet	scruz		utc
dk		fl		ny		sdnet		york

The following newsgroups have been deleted since the last posting:
