This is the second third of the summary of how to find email addresses
for undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff at various
colleges and universities. 

;;; ********************************
;;; Email Database: N-T, U to Univ of 
;;; ********************************

	
New Jersey Institute of Technology:
	Newark NJ 07021
	CS PhD Studs: user@newark.njit.edu
	Grad Studs:   user@hertz.njit.edu (ultrix), user@tesla.njit.edu (vms)

New Mexico Institute Of Mining And Technology:
	Try finger name@nmt.edu or finger name@jupiter.nmt.edu.  Jupiter is
	the main server;  CS students generally have accounts on
	minos.nmt.edu.  Accounts generally seem to be of the form FLLLLLLL.

New Mexico State Univ.:
	Virtually all email addresses are of the form fllllll@nmsu.edu. Finger
	is not well supported. Mail to postmaster should help. (Also, if you
	have an account, there is a postmaster program.)

New York University (NYU)
	Addresses for students at NYU are fml####@acfcluster.nyu.edu, where f,
	m, l are first, middle, last initials and #### are the last four
	digits of the social security number.  All students and staff can get
	limited mail accounts by requesting them.  Some users have nicknames:
	lastname, or lllllf, or lllllff.

North Carolina State University (Raleigh, NC)	Changed: Mon Jul  5 1993
	Whois server on gyro.cc.ncsu.edu also accepts requests via finger.
	  All whois entries have Snail addresses, some have e-mail.
	Faculty/Staff: accounts on adm.csc.ncsu.edu. No specific naming
	  convention for faculty accounts.
	Graduate Students: accounts on druid.csc.ncsu.edu. login names are
	  gr-xxx where xxx are the initials of the person. However, using the
	  person first or last name will also work.
	All engineers have accounts on eos.ncsu.edu
	Most undergraduate id's are fmllllll@eos.ncsu.edu
	College of textiles comp. center: fmllllll@unity.ncsu.edu

North Dakota Network
	This section describes how to find email addresses for students who
	attend Public Colleges and Universities in North Dakota.

	ND HECN PLAINS  (@plains.bitnet) -or- (@plains.nodak.edu)
	This is a Unix system.  All userids are given out according to last
	name or possibly a first initial added in front.  You are able to
	finger these accounts.

	ND HECN CMS  (@ndsuvm1.bitnet) -or- (@vm1.nodak.edu)
	This is a VM/SP (CMS) system. Userids are a bit more complicated here...
	The ND HECN (No-Dak Higher Education Computer Network) consists of the
	following schools..  Their 2-letter school code follows.
	   Bismarck State College (BJ)      North Dakota State University (NU)
	   University of North Dakota (UD)  Dickinson State College (DS)
	   Williston State College (WS)     Bottineau State College (BT)
	   Lake Region Community College (LR)  Valley City State College (VC)
	   Mayville State College (MV)      Minot State College (MN)
	   State School of Science (SS)
	Userids given out prior to (approximately) August 1991 are assigned a
	userid according to the following:  Userids are in the form of
	LL######.  LL is the "School Code" (see above).  The #'s are the first
	6 digits of the user's NAID number.

	Userids given out after August 1991 are assigned according to last
	name, or with part of their first name in front if the account is
	already taken.  They are trying to give you the same userid as your
	plain's id (if you have one). Also, people with the 'old id' can
	request to have their account renamed to the new format.  You are able
	to finger accounts on ndsuvm1, but as of 02-26-92 student names are
	not yet available to finger. (It will tell you if the account at least
	exists tho).  Faculty/Staff names are available to finger.  Each
	college has an 'administrative' account with the form LL0ADMIN.  (LL =
	School Code).  I don't know if they will give out userids, but it's
	worth a try.

	UND School of Medicine: try First.Last@medicine.und.nodak.edu for
	staff and faculty;  no student accounts as of Fall 1992.  For help
	finding someone, try 'finger' or contact
	postmaster@medicine.und.nodak.edu

Northeastern:					Changed: Mon Jul  5 1993
	Finger name@lynx.dac.northeastern.edu where <name> is a first-name,
	  last-name, or username.  All students, faculty, staff, and alumni
	  can have accounts, but they have to be requested.
	Student usernames are usually flllllll, but many students pick there
	  own variations.  Many students never log in again once their class
	  is through.

Northern Arizona University (Flagstaff, Arizona, USA)
	You can use any of the following ways to locate people at Northern
	Arizona University.  If one doesn't work, try the next.  NOTE: not
	everyone at NAU has an electronic mailbox.
	1. finger PERSON@info.nau.edu
	   where PERSON is any part of a person's name that you know.  You may
	   have to use quotes, as in: finger "Jane Doe"@info.nau.edu. This is a
	   "white pages" style database.  For more help on this system: finger
	   @info.nau.edu
	2. mail FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME@nau.edu
	   where FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME are the person you're trying to reach.
	   You may need to specify FIRSTNAME.MIDDLEINITIAL.LASTNAME
	3. send mail to the site postmaster:  mail postmaster@nau.edu
	   Some subdomains have postmasters e.g. postmaster@cse.nau.edu for
	   the Computer Science and Engineering department.  

Northern Illinois University (DeKalb, IL)	Created: Mon Jul 5 1993
	Encore MultiMax (mp.cs.niu.edu).  CSCI students may have accounts on
	  this UNIX-based machine if their classes require it.  Class accounts
	  are of the form 'T90nnnn' where 'nnnn' is a randomly-assigned
	  four-digit number.  Undergraduate and graduate TA's may have
	  accounts of the form 'T90fml1', where f=first initial, m=middle
	  initial, and l=last initial.  Substitute the letter 'X' for a
	  missing middle initial.  Older TA's may have an '8' or '9'
	  substituted for the '1'.  Students who work for Academic Computing
	  Services, or are of a major other than CSCI, may also have accounts.
	  Use 'finger' for more info.
	CSCI LAN (csci.niu.edu) All CSCI faculty members and some graduate
	  students have accounts on this Novell LAN of the form 'T90fml1',
	  same as above.
	Amdahl 5890 (vm.cso.niu.edu) CSCI students may have accounts on this
	  mainframe running MVS and VM if their classes require it.  Class
	  accounts are of the form 'T90nnnn', same as above.  All TA's have an
	  account of the form 'T90fml1'.

Northwestern:					Changed: Tue Feb 23 1993
	General e-mail services are shared by casbah.acns.nwu.edu
	  (129.105.113.52) and merle.acns.nwu.edu (129.105.113.57).  Merle is
	  in full production as of the beginning of 1993, although there are
	  not yet that many accounts on it.  This will change.  Both Casbah
	  and Merle support finger requests.
	If you have access to a PH electronic database client, you can use
	  ns.nwu.edu for a ph-nameserver.  Users must personally register an
	  e-mail address in this database for a query to provide one -- it is
	  not done automatically.  If you do not have access to a PH client,
	  the default PH-based address is <alias@nwu.edu> where the default
	  alias is f-lastname (first initial-last name).  Many people choose
	  to remove the hyphen or replace the default alias with their
	  initials, or just about anything else.  The default is a good thing
or any reason, PH responds with fairly
	  complete information, in plain english, including other possible
	  aliases, if there is a conflict.

Norwegian Institute of Technology: see University of Trondheim

Novosibirsk State Technical Univ.:		Created: Mon Sep  6 1993
	Russia, Novosibirsk 630092, K. Marx Prospekt 20
	Usernames can be hard to discover; postmaster@nstu.nsk.su is willing
	  to be helpful in tracking usernames. 

Oakland University (Rochester, MI)		Changed: Thu Mar 25 1993
	Hosts: vela.acs.oakland.edu, argo.acs.oakland.edu
	Many departments maintain their own systems but their users usually
	  have accounts on either vela or argo as well.
	Userids: Students: FMlastname   Faculty: Lastname
	Finger: on vela, use any portion of the name.  On argo, you can only
	  finger the userid.


Oberlin (Oberlin, Ohio):			Changed: Tue Mar 30 1993
	Many students and faculty have accounts on ocvaxa, which can be
	  reached as ocvaxa.cc.oberlin.edu. Administrative staff members have
	  accounts on ocvaxc, which can be reached as ocvaxc.cc.oberlin.edu.
	  This is an internet-only site.
	Student User IDs are of the form: S+first & last initials + last 4
	  digits of the student ID (e.g. SDG1234)
	Faculty IDs are of the form: F + lastname.
	Best bet is to send mail to postmaster@ocvaxa.cc.oberlin.edu
	CS students/faculty: occs.cs.oberlin.edu (student usernames are mostly
	  last names, occasionally with a first initial to disambiguate;
	  faculty and staff are generally 3 initials).
	You can also send mail to postmaster.

Ohio State University: 
	Faculty, Staff, Graduate students: flllllll@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
	CS Students, Faculty and Staff: cis.ohio-state.edu, with
	username lastname, fllllll, llllll-f, fml, firstname or lllll-fm.
	Faculty and staff are mostly first or last name.

	Also, some students have their accounts aliased so that
	you can send mail/finger to lastname.#@osu.edu
	where # is required and is anything from 1 on up to infinity
	(these numbers can get very large for names like Smith, i.e. in
	the thousands). "whois -h osu.edu" and telneting to osu.edu should
        also work.

Ohio University (Athens OH):
	CS (UNIX): fllll@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu
	CS (VMS): oucsduce.cs.ohiou.edu
	EE (grad students): fllll@bobcat.ent.ohiou.edu, @redskins.ent.ohiou.edu
	Undergrads (class accounts): OUACCVMB.BITNET    
	Faculty: OUACCVMA.BITNET

Oklahoma State/Stillwater:
	userid@rsc.ceat.okstate.edu

Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology:
	Only Graduate Students. Their host, ogccse, is @cse.ogc.edu.
	This recently changed to cse.ogi.edu.

Oregon State: 
	CS: mist.cs.orst.edu, prism.cs.orst.edu

Oxford University (Oxford, England):		Changed: Sat Mar 27 1993
	Telnet to info.ox.ac.uk, which presents you with an online information
	  system, one of whose subsystems is an electronic mail directory
	  showing all authorized users who are willing to be so listed.
	Host: vax.ox.ac.uk

Penn State Univ.:				Changed: Wed Mar 24 1993
	Domain: psu.edu
	The Electronic Bulletin Board contains, among many other things, the
	  entire student, staff, and faculty directory.  To use EBB, connect
	  to psuvm.psu.edu from an Internet-connected site using tn3270 (You
	  can also telnet to cac3270.psu.edu if you do not have a 3270
	  emulator, but will have to supply a terminal type).  After the
	  initial logon screen appears, type the RETURN key and the screen
	  will clear.  Type "ebb" and hit RETURN, and you will get the
	  top-level EBB menu, one item of which is "DIRECTORY".  Typing "dir"
	  and RETURN will select the university directory.  The rest should be
	  obvious, but for a couple of other points: EBB assumes you're using
	  an IBM terminal, and displays help in the form of PF keys to move
	  around, etc.  A simple "+" serves to scroll ahead, and "-" moves
	  backward. Typing the RETURN key alone will back up one level of
	  menus, so typing RETURN repeatedly will ultimately close the
	  connection.
	Computer Science: cs.psu.edu (UNIX), crayola.cs.psu.edu (Ultrix)
	Math: math.psu.edu

Pitzer College:					Created: Sat Jul  3 1993
	finger flllllll@pitvax.claremont.edu

Plymouth State College (Plymouth NH)		Created: Mon Sep  6 1993
	Faculty & staff: firstname.lastname@plymouth.edu
	   or flllllll@psc.plymouth.edu or fffffffffl@psc.plymouth.edu
	Students: finger firstname@oz.plymouth.edu or finger
	  lastname@oz.plymouth.edu

Polytechnic University (New York)
	This is a listing for Brooklyn and Farmingdale Campuses
	Code    System Name             Comments

	Legend: F = Fingerable          X = Nonfingerable
		W = At login: prompt typing in 'who' will list parties logged on
	All system names end with ".poly.edu", e.g.  'finger @Poly-TS.poly.edu'
	Most login names begin with first initial then first seven character
	  of last name.  Most undergrad users would be on george, gracie,
	  ishara, tasha and worf systems.

Pomona College (Claremont, CA):
	Internet: fllllll@pomona.claremont.edu (bitnet flllll@pomona.bitnet)

        Usernames are the first character of the first name, followed
	by the full last name (John Doe would be JDOE).  In case of conflicts, 
	the middle initial is used between first and last name. (If JDOE 
	already has an account, James A. Doe would be JADOE).  Finger works.

Portland State University (Portland, Oregon): 
	Students: odin.cc.pdx.edu

Princeton:					Changed: Tue Jun 29 1993
	Undergrads: phoenix.princeton.edu, pucc.princeton.edu (VM)
	pucc.bitnet. (Both phoenix and pucc are now fingerable.)
	CS Grad Studs/Faculty: cs.princeton.edu
	CogSci Lab: clarity.princeton.edu
	Math Dept: math.princeton.edu

	You can also try fingering at princeton.edu.

	Usernames are usually FMLLLLLL, sometimes LLLLLLLL or FFFFFFFL

Purdue:						Changed: Tue Jun 29 1993
	At Purdue, engineering students (undergrad/grad) have accounts on
	machines on the Engineering Computer Network (ECN).  There are
	hundreds of machines, but the main ones are named according to a
	fairly discernible system, i.e.

	e?.ecn.purdue.edu = Electrical	c?.ecn.purdue.edu = Civil
	k?.ecn.purdue.edu = Chemical	g?.ecn.purdue.edu = Nuclear/Aero
	m?.ecn.purdue.edu = Mechanical	p?.ecn.purdue.edu = Potter Library

	In each case, "?" is one of 'a', 'b', 'c', etc..check your local host
	tables or nameserver for a current list.  Undergrads usually end up on
	the 'n' series of machines... en, mn, cn, and gn.

	Effective 10/16/90, mail to ecn hosts need only be labeled with the
	local domain. For example, user@ecn.purdue.edu. Mail sent there will
	automatically be forwarded to the users mailbox.

	Usernames on ecn machines are assigned according to user preferences.
	Try the usual (initials, fllllll, first name, last name, etc.). You
	can send mail to ecn.purdue.edu (which will forward it to the
	appropriate machine). Also, if your finger supports arguments, doing a
	'finger -l lastname' will find people by name regardless of account.

	Other students (CS, math/stat, and science majors) usually have
	accounts on machines operated by the Purdue University Computing
	Center (PUCC).  These machines are all in the ".cc.purdue.edu"
	subdomain.  Many usernames are based on the user's last name and
	initials, but many still use three letter/number combinations which
	have nothing to do with the user's name.  Computing center staff
	usernames are either a name chosen by the user, or a three-letter
	combination beginning with "a".  Additionally, "finger" with a name
	argument will find all people with that name, so try "finger -l
	lastname".

	Students are found on the 'instructional' machines; the
	dipproximately like this:

	expert  = low-level courses for non CS or EE majors, some CS courses
	sage    = more low-level courses, first semester CS
	feserve = freshman engineering courses and some CS courses
	sonata  = some Math and CS courses
	mentor  = most other CS courses

	Students not in one of these courses may still have an account on
	expert or sage, since there are many smaller groups to which accounts
	are issued.  Also, any Purdue student may obtain a student personal
	account on one of these machines.

	Research users are found scattered around all the PUCC machines, but
	speedy, rapid, and swift are the most likely places to find them.
	Staff can always be reached through 'staff' regardless of where they
	have their accounts.

	In addition to those, there is an IBM mainframe which is found on the
	Internet as vm.cc.purdue.edu or on BITNET as PURCCVM.  It is used
	primarily by research users and Computer Technology majors, and
	students taking statistics courses.  Some student personal accounts
	are also on this machine Usernames are either based on the person's
	real name or Xyyy where yyy is a 3-character PUCC ID.

	Graduate CS students are found on machines in the ".cs.purdue.edu"
	subdomain, including "arthur", "mordred", "merlin", and other machines
	named after characters from the Arthurian legends.  Mail to
	cs.purdue.edu usually works.

	Veterinary students are found on machines in the ".vet.purdue.edu"
	subdomain; these machines are named after animals or other vet terms
	e.g. "dog", "goat", "pharm"...Agricultural/Agronomy Engineering
	students are found on machines in the ".acn.purdue.edu" subdomain;
	these include "harvest", "barn", etc...Some folks in chemistry can be
	found on machines in the ".chem.purdue.edu" subdomain; many of these
	are named after items from the Dr. Who series, e.g. "doctor",
	"tardis", "k9"...Some folks in psychology can be found on machines in
	the ".psych.purdue.edu" subdomain; these machines are named after
	Latin/South American countries, e.g. "peru", "brazil", "mexico",
	"panama"...Some folks in biology can be found on machines in the
	".bio.purdue.edu" subdomain; some of these machines are named after
	Tolkien characters, e.g. "bilbo", "gollum"...Some folks in physics can
	be found on machines in the ".physics.purdue.edu" subdomain; these
	machines are named after physicists, e.g. "maxwell", "newton"... The
	Krannert School of Management is in the .mgmt subdomain, with hosts
	zeus and hera. Most management students will be found on a PUCC
	machine.

Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada
	Faculty and staff: firstname.initial.lastname@queensu.ca.
	  Unfortunately you have to spell the name exactly as in the Personnel
	  records.  This is an IBM mainframe machine with no Finger server.
	Computing and Information Science: finger x@qucis.queensu.ca, where x
	  is lastname or firstname.

Reed College:
	username@reed.edu, where username is of the form flllllll

Rice University (Houston, TX)			Changed: Sat Jul  3 1993
	Finger username@rice.edu, where name is firstname or lastname.  This
	  is an online copy of the campus directory, giving surface address
	  and phone number (not e-mail address).  Telephoning people is an
	  excellent and efficient way to find their e-mail addresses.
	Owlnet accounts are provided for undergraduate and graduate engineers
	  and natural science students.  Others are given accounts when needed
	  for a class, and then the accounts are deleted after the class is
	  over.  Try finger name@owlnet.rice.edu (GNU finger daemon).
	All students are given accounts on the rice mainframe computer, though
	  off-campus access is still restricted for these accounts unless given
	  permission.  The address is @ricevm1.rice.edu and userid's are of the
	  form fllllnn, so John Smith is JSMIT00@ricevm1.rice.edu.  Finger
	  name@ricevm1 works for some accounts but a negative response from it
	  is not definitive
	Here's a small list of machines to try when searching for a user.
	  Try department machines frst for faculty, staff, and grad students,
	  and Owlnet first for undergrads.  Append ".rice.edu" to these names.

Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology: Terre Haute, IN
        There are three major systems on which students are given accounts:
          - Academic VAXcluster: rosevc.rose-hulman.edu
                All students have accounts.
          - NeXT workstation network: nextwork.rose-hulman.edu
                All students have accounts.
          - CS department network: cs.rose-hulman.edu
                Any student can get an account upon request.
        Student usernames are consistent across the systems, in the form
        llllllfm.  Mail addresses of the form: first.m.last@rose-hulman.edu
        are also accepted; mail is directed to a preferred address.


Rowan College of New Jersey:			Changed: Mon Sep  6 1993
        (formerly Glassboro State College, renamed in 1993)
 
	Below is a list of computers and who uses them. For help, send mail to
	postmaster on whichever one seems the most appropriate. If you're not
	sure, send it to postmaster@rowan.edu. For those with access to gopher
	you can find current email info on our server. It includes most of the

Rutgers:					Changed: Mon Jul  5 1993
	Rutgers has a whitepages server, so you can do:
		whois -h whitepages.rutgers.edu "fname lname" 
	  to find email addresses.  If the user has an email address it will
	  explicitly indicate "Email:".  The "Userid" field is *NOT* an email
n email address has put it in the
	  directory.
	Other ways to find email addresses at Rutgers: There are many
	  departmental machines, but these are a few common ones.  Usernames
	  are usually "llllllll" but some are "fllllll" etc.

Simon Fraser University:			Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	All students, staff and faculty have accounts on the campus computing
	  network (CCN).  The domain name is @sfu.ca.  User information is
	  available through an X.500 directory service, which can be accessed
	  via the finger program: finger f_l@whistler.sfu.ca, where f is the
	  first name and l is the last name.
	Computing Science and allied units also maintain a separate subdomain
	  cs.sfu.ca (Centre for Systems Science).  Users generally have the
	  same accounts on this domain as they do on the CCN. 
	
Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, NY, 12866   (518) 584-5000
  Internet domain name:      skidmore.edu
  Bitnet node name:          skidmore

  All e-mail is collected by  scott.skidmore.edu (141.222.1.4)

  Usernames normally take the form  first initial and first seven 
  characters of the last name.  You can also employ "fname.lname",
  giving the complete first and last names separated by a dot.

  Contact LDG@SCOTT.SKIDMORE.EDU for any delivery problems or other

Sonoma State University: fname.lname@sonoma.edu

Southwest Texas State University:

	cs and math faculty or grad students: @swtexas.bitnet
		(most user IDs are cs_lastname or ma_lastname)

Stanford:					Changed: Wed Mar 24 1993
	Stanford has implemented a finger service for its whois database.  Try
	"finger name@stanford.edu" first -- most students and lots of staff
	and faculty now have their e-mail addresses registered with this
	service.  Name can be lastname, or for better results flllll or
	fmllllll.

	Alternatively, this service can be accessed via whois:

	whois -h stanford.edu name

	If that doesn't work, most students (and lots of staff and faculty)
	have accounts on leland.stanford.edu.  The finger daemon on leland
	was turned off by December 1992;  try its various clients: elaine0
	through elaine53(.stanford.edu)

	A couple of other machines to try:

	CS (Grad and undergrad): xenon.stanford.edu
	Geology/Earth sciences: pangea.stanford.edu
	EE: sierra.stanford.edu
	Psychology: psych.stanford.edu

St. John's University (Collegeville, MN):	Changed: Tue Jan  4 1994

St. Olaf College (Northfield, MN):

     UNIX accounts are created for all students upon their admission to the
     College.  Not all faculty and staff have accounts yet, but we're
     working on that.

	General address form:	lname@stolaf.edu
	Last name conflicts are usually resolved by adding first
	and/or middle initials to the end of the last name.

	Try fingering Lname@stolaf.edu (note the capital letter).

	Try using the St. Olaf Gopher information server at gopher.stolaf.edu.
	Phonebook information can be found under "St. Olaf Information".

	Try sending email to postmaster@stolaf.edu describing the
	person you're trying to contact.

	CSO phone book server at cso.stolaf.edu.

Stevens Institute of Technology (Hoboken, NJ, USA) Created: Mon Jul  5 1993
	Send mail to username@SITVAX.STEVENS-TECH.EDU, where username is of
	the form "first initial lastname" truncated to 8 characters, with a
	uniqueness number.  For example, John Smith would have the username
	JSMITH, but Jane Smith (who's account was added after John's) would
	have JSMITH1.
	
	We hope to add a Campus Information Server in Fall'93 to make it
	easier to find people.  This record will be updated when that occurs.

SUNY/Albany:					Created: Mon Aug 23 1993
	Students: flnnnn@albnyvms.bitnet (VAX cluster) or @albnyvm1 (IBM
	  system) where nnnn is last 4 digits of social security number.

SUNY/Alfred (Alfred, NY)
	(SUNY College of Technology at Alfred)
	Students and faculty: llllllfm@snyalfva.cc.alfredtech.edu
	   (lastname, firstname, middlename, though middle name sometimes
	    isn't used.

SUNY/Binghamton: (Binghamton, NY)		Changed: Sat Mar 27 1993
	In order to contact someone at SUNY-Binghamton you'll have to give
	  them a call; there is no way of figuring out a student's address
	  given their name, as the mapping is random (sequential in the order
	  people apply for accounts).
	Undergrads: bXNNNNN@HOSTNAME.cc.binghamton.edu where X is a letter
	hat year they got their account: 91/92: A 92/93: B(?);
	  NNNNN are random digits, almost always starting with 0; HOSTNAME is
	  either bingvaxa (VMS), bingsuns (SunOS), bingvmb (IBM), or bingtjw
	  (IBM).  Older userids are of the form vyNNNN@bingvaxa, and
	  bgNNNN@bingvmb.
	Interested undergrads tend to have accounts on bingvaxa, though those
	  in Math/CS classes will have accounts on bingsuns.
	An e-mail directory for some faculty and staff is available;
		telnet to bingvmb.cc.binghamton.edu
		DIAL VTAM
		ELIXIR
		Choose from menu.

SUNY/Buffalo:
	Grads, Undergrads: username@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu [finger not possible]
		Userids of the form VNNNXXXX where NNN are the first
		3 digits of one's social security number, and XXXX are
		4 alphanumerics representing the rest of the social
		security number. 
	General Computing Center (students): username@acsu.buffalo.edu

	ubvms is a VAX, and most students had accounts there.
	Recently, however, more people are getting accounts on acsu,
	the Unix system.	

	Engineering Students: username@eng.buffalo.edu
	EE Students: username@beatrix.eng.buffalo.edu
	CS Dept: username@cs.buffalo.edu (username@sunybcs.bitnet)
	
	The usernames for the acsu, cs (and possibly eng) seems to be formed
	by something appoximating the following rules: 
	  1) If lastname is <=8 character, 
		  1.1) if it does not already exist as a username, 
			  then username=lastname. (eg. smith)
		  1.2) else 
			  username is first initial + lastname (eg. jsmith)
	  2) If lastname is too long, and a middle initial exists, 
		  then username is initials (eg. jcs)
	  3) If lastname is too long but no middle initial exists, 
		  then username is the first 5 chars of the last name, a -, and
		  then the initial. (eg. James Smithenson would be smith-j).

	The cs and acsu domains share mail alias files, so mail to a username
	at either cs.buffalo.edu or acsu.buffalo.edu will arrive at the user
	in the same mailbox.

	There are also geog (Geography), arch (Architecture) and med
	(Medicine) domains.

SUNY/Canton

	CS Folks: cs.sunysb.edu (cs is an alias to the host sbcs)
	You can also use the campus "white pages", whois -h sunysb.edu ...
	or try fingering at fllll@sunysb.edu

Syracuse Univ.:
	CompSci Grads/Faculty: top.cis.syr.edu
	   Many CompSci graduates and faculty have accounts on this
	   machine; the usual username pattern is "lastname@top.cis.syr.edu"
	Some faculty and staff:
	   SUADMIN.bitnet (suadmin.syr.edu)
	Other students and faculty:
	    mailbox.syr.edu
            sunrise.syr.edu (VAX 8820/VMS)
            suvm.acs.syr.edu    (IBM 3090/CMS)
	suvm.acs.syr.edu and sunrise.syr.edu are run by the SU Computing
	  Services. Undergrads usually have accounts on sunrise (which is a
	  VAX VMS cluster). Both hosts are on bitnet as suvm and sunrise.
	The pattern for all these hosts is: first-initial + middle-initial +
	  as much of the last name as possible. 

	White-Pages: "finger name@syr.edu" will search the online catalog
	  white pages for a registered user that has his/her information public.
	  Mutliple matches produces multiple output.  "finger @syr.edu" for more
	  details.  The same information is available via a BITNET directory
	  server (NSERVE@SUVM.BITNET), through PSI's X.500 project, and through
	  whois -h syr.edu
	Phone Book: The Syracuse Phone book has the same e-mail addresses as
	  are available in the White pages, but as it's only printed once a
	  year they are usually out of date.  Dialing (315) 443-1870 is campus
	  information;  if the userid exists in the phonebook, the people
	  there will be happy to give it out.
	consult@mailbox.syr.edu  -- If the username exists, and that person
	  doesn't mind having it handed out, this userid will check into it
	  beforehand and reply via mail.

Swarthmore:					Changed: Tue Aug  3 1993
        Most Students/Faculty/Staff: FLLLLLLN@cc.swarthmore.edu, where F is
	  the user's first initial, and LLLLLL is the first six letters of
	  their last name.  A '1' (one) is appended in most cases, though for
	  duplicates the number is incremented. To find people, send mail to
	  postmaster. You can also finger people by their last name.
	As of fall 1993: some students may be reached at
	  lastname@sccs.swarthmore.edu
	Computing Centre staff: usually lastname@cc.swarthmore.edu
        CS: Usually, lastname@cs.swarthmore.edu
	Engineering: usually lastname@engin.swarthmore.edu

Tampere Univ. of Technology (Tampere, Finland):	Created: Mon Sep  6 1993
	Host: tut.fi.  Finger available.

Texas A&M University:

	All students can have an account on a VAX cluster, a heterogeneous
	set of UNIX boxes, or a VM/CMS machine. Probably less than
	30% of the student body (40K students) takes advantage of this. The
	format of the usernames is FML#### where fml are the initials and ####
	is the last four digits of the SSN.  If a student has no middle
	initial then '0' (Zero) is used.  These domain is "tamu.edu" and the
	machine could be any of several choices like venus, rigel, summa,
	sigma, etc.
		General Unix: 		tamuts.tamu.edu, tamaix.tamu.edu,
					tamsun.tamu.edu
		General VAX/VMS: 	zeus.tamu.edu, venus.tamu.edu, 
					summa.tamu.edu, sigma.tamu.edu,
					rigel.tamu.edu
                General VM/CMS:         tamvm1.tamu.edu

	Finding addresses:
		Try fingering lastname@tamsun.tamu.edu or lastname@tamu.edu.
		(tamu.edu uses ph, the CSO Nameserver)

	The computer science department's domain is "cs.tamu.edu".  The
	statistics dept is "stat.tamu.edu".  The username format on these
	machines is usually fffffffl or flllllll.  Some old accounts may have
	first names or last names only.
	The math department's domain is math.tamu.edu.

	There are about a million other departmental machines with varying
	names but I believe they are all in the form "xxx.tamu.edu".

Trinity College (Hartford CT):
	Students, staff, and faculty: firstname.lastname@mail.trincoll.edu

		vax1.cc.uakron.edu (vax, so finger works)
		vm1.cc.uakron.edu (vms, so finger doesn't work) 
		vm1 is also known as akronvm.bitnet
	Most students and faculty have accounts on either of these machines.
	Usernames are usually r1 for faculty, r2 for graduate
	students, and r3 for undergrads, followed by first, middle,
	and last initials. (If the student doesn't have a middle
	initial it is omitted.) Naming conflicts are resolved by
	adding a digit to the end of the userid (e.g., 1, 2, ... 9).

	for example: mine is r2sk9@vax1.cc.uakron.edu...

	Engineering Machines: Grad, undergrad
		file01.ecgf.uakron.edu (unix, but no fingering)
		file02.ecgf.uakron.edu (unix, but no fingering)
	Userid's normally begin with the first two letters of the
	person's major (el = electrical, me = mechanical) followed by
	4 digits to make 6 digit userid. Undergrads are given id's of
	form bsxxxx. 

	Math Department machines: Faculty, Grad, Undergrad
		vonneuman.cs.uakron.edu (unix and fingering works)
	Only math students or students enrolled in courses offered by

            Y is for administration and organizations.
	    H is for temporary guest accounts
	    R is for research
	FML is the initials of first, middle, and last names, respectively.
	N is a number, and is only given (and then it starts from one) if

	O is the computer that the person is on.
	  1 is Southeast and affiliated schools 
	  2 is Anchorage and its affiliates (Kodiak, Kenai, Mat-Su, and Prince
	    William Sound)
	  3 is Fairbanks and affiliates
	However, a person with enough access can use other campus' computers.

	acad2 and acad3 (.alaska.edu) can be fingered (usernames only - VMS
	  finger).  Fingering these computers will not tell you the person's
	  name.
	There are also other computers in the alaska.edu domain.  SX accounts
	  (computer system administrators and testing accounts) usually are on
	  orca.alaska.edu and also on at least one of the acadO's. orca cannot
	  be fingered.
	A student, faculty, or staff member can request an account on
	  camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu, also. This computer can also be fingered.
	Other computers in alaska.edu may not use this username assignment,
	  but orca.alaska.edu and camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu do.

Univ. of Arizona:
	Historically computer access at the UA had been limited to students,
	faculty and staff who had either a job, or a class which required a
	computer. Recently the Unix Users Group at the University of Arizona
	began providing General Access Systems for no charge to UA students.

	The machines are configured from donated, loaned and retired equipment
	and managed by volunteer effort. As a volunteer effort, there is not
	time to respond to postmaster requests for usernames so please do not
	send address requests to the postmaster. Use the finger utility
	instead; it will respond to "real name" requests (in the following
	"gas" means "gas.uug.arizona.edu"):

	finger -l kennedy@gas gotobed@gas |grep "Login name:"
	Login name: bjk       			In real life: Brian J. Kennedy
	Login name: kennedys  			In real life: Steven A Kennedy 
	Login name: jgotobed  			In real life: Joe Gotobed

	While we are attempting to support a rational username policy, it is
	not foolproof as this example shows. If the finger info returns
	nothing, the person has no account on these systems.

	Due to limited disk capacity, ( < 1Mb per account) the usage is
	limited primarily to internet news, telnet, ftp and email.  There are
	currently about 500 students and a capacity of about 3,000 accounts.
	While accounts are currently limited to students, we expect to provide
	access to the general staff & faculty sometime in the spring of 1993.

	There are nearly a hundred subdomains at the University, each with
	their own access policies, username assignments and email schemes. If
	the finger utility does not reveal the address of a friend, a phone
	call to them asking for their address is probably the most efficient
	way to discover it.

	Many faculty and staff are on ccit.arizona.edu.  If someone tells you
	they are on "cosy" or "icosy," forget it; you can't send mail to them
	(although they can send mail to you).

	Undergrads in Computer Science are on caslon.cs.arizona.edu.
	Undergrads in Engineering are on a cluster of Suns; try
	evax2.engr.arizona.edu.

	Grad students and Faculty are usually given accounts on their
	department/college systems.  Try math.arizona.edu;
	physics.arizona.edu; mis.arizona.edu; cs.arizona.edu, etc.

	In the School of Business, you can try FirstinitialLastname (e.g.
	RReagan) @bpa.arizona.edu with very good success.  If
	FirstinitialLastname is ambiguous, a username might be
	LastnameFirstinitial instead. (Main site was mis.arizona.edu until
	late 1992).  On BITNET send mail to username@arizbpa.bitnet

	Arizona.EDU is the campus mail gateway, but only those who ask get
	aliases on Arizona.EDU.  You could try last-name@Arizona.EDU if you
	suspect the person you want uses EMAIL a lot.

Univ. of California/Berkeley:			Changed: Mon Aug 23 1993
	Undergraduates in General: uclink.berkeley.edu or ocf.berkeley.edu
	Faculty, staff, and graduate students can also get accounts on
	  ocf.berkeley.edu.
	Undergrad CS/EE, 1st Year Grad: cory.berkeley.edu (This is for
	  undergrad juniors and seniors and first year graduate students. Most
	  other graduate students have their own workstations. For freshmen
	  and sophomores, one must look for a class account or ocf public
	  cluster. Undergrads now have to pay for accounts on cory, so fewer
	  people will be using it.)  soda and ucsee are run by students (CS
	  Undergrad Association and UC Society of EEs, respectively).
	First Year Graduate CS students: try cory.berkeley.edu or
	  xcssun.berkeley.edu. antipodes.berkeley.edu
	CS Faculty, Grads, Staff: cs.berkeley.edu (aliases mail address)
	CS Grad Students: snake.cs.berkeley.edu.  Good systems to try are (all
	  .cs.berkeley.edu or .berkeley.edu) sprite, harmony, sequoia, larch,
	  robotics, postgres, and ginger. tenet.icsi.berkeley.edu also has
	  some CS grad students on it.  Many machines in the department are
	  now foo.cs.berkeley.edu, but not all are.
	EE Faculty: esvax, ic, cad, or a workstation
	Janus will be going away soon, as will ucbarpa.  Many csgrads will
	  have mail aliases on cs.berkeley.edu, which will eventually support
	  finger.  Systems to try for grad students are (all .berkeley.edu):
	  sprite, harmony, sequoia, yew, larch, robotics, postgres, and ginger.
	  Soon, these will be moved into the cs.berkeley.edu subdomain instead
	  of berkeley.edu subdomain (ie, you'd finger @sprite.cs.berkeley.edu).
	  This will happen soon, but hasn't happened yet.
	Names for the above accounts are usually, but not always, combinations
	  of the user's real first, middle and last names and/or initials.
	  However, finger will search the "real name" field as well as the
	  account name.
which all students get). These are
	  found on web.berkeley.edu,bard.berkeley.edu, and
	  xcssun.berkeley.edu. zooey, buddy, franny, and seymour too, except
	  they're being retired. Danube, amazon, congo, po, and volga and a
	  cluster of stars (named after stars) are supposed to be the
	  replacements. web and buddy hold classes that freshmen and
	  sophomores often take. seymour and franny are often used for classes
	  for business majors.
	Class account usernames are typically cnnn-mxx or ennn-mxx, where 'c'
	  or 'e' denotes CS or EE, nnn is the course number, m is the section
	  number (not always used), and xx are two letters.
	Statistics class accounts are of the form s#xxxx, where # is the class
	  number and xxxx is some string of alphabetic characters. These
	  accounts live on gandalf.berkeley.edu. Statistics cluster computers
	  are named after Tolkien characters.
	qal.berkeley.edu is used for courses in "practical computer use"
	  (taught by the anthropology department).  Account names are 193xxx,
	  where xxx is the last name of the user.
	Math (Graduate and Faculty): math.berkeley.edu 
	Stat Department: stat.berkeley.edu
	Physics Grads and Undergrads: physics.berkeley.edu
	Mech. E Profs & Grads: euler.berkeley.edu, tycho.berkeley.edu
	Public Cluster (some undergrads): ocf.berkeley.edu
	School of Education:  soe.berkeley.edu
	Other machines to try: ucbvax.berkeley.edu  
	garnet.berkeley.edu and violet.berkeley.edu are the most likely place
	  for a pay-for-use account. Some departments maintain accounts on
	  these machines for faculty and staff, though, so these machines are
	  the place to try for faculty affiliated with departments that have
	  no real computing facilities. Almost anyone on campus can pay for an
	  account on these machines.
	Some of the class accounts are also on congo. Generally addresses for
	  the first semester classes are:
	  CS 60A - c60a-__@danube
	  CS 3 - c3-1a__@amazon or c3-1b__@congo
	School administration has set up the computer uclink.berkeley.edu, for
	  staff or students who want an account (they can keep it for the time
	  that they are there).  It's supposedly on a pilot program, but many
	  students are getting accounts there.  As of summer 1993 it is
	  expanding rapidly to cover all faculty, staff, and students.
	Also, people can look for staff people on whois.berkeley.edu.
	postmaster@nettlesome.berkeley.edu should be considered as a last
	  choice when looking from someone electronically. 

Univ. of California/Davis: 
	@ucdavis.edu -- works if you know their account name
	   userids are of the form fmlllll.
	@clover.ucdavis.edu -- works for anyone in the CS department
		whois -h ucdavis.edu <name>
	CS: First.Last@cs.ucdavis.edu
	Engineering/CS: First.Last@ee.ucdavis.edu 
			or First.Last@eecs.ucdavis.edu

Univ. of California/Irvine:
	CS Undergrads: bonnie.ics.uci.edu
	    Mail sometimes restricted; policy has changed several times.
	    Userid usually FLLLLLLL (8 char max); sometimes FFFFFFFL.
	CS Grads/Staff/Faculty: ics.uci.edu
	    Faculty userids are usually their last names, sometimes
	    initials, a few firstname only.  Grads usually FLLLLLLL,
	    some lastname only.  Staff sometimes firstname, sometimes lastname.
	Other departments: mostly grads; userids usually lastname.
	   Biology dept: sanger.bio.uci.edu
	   EE: balboa.eng.uci.edu
	   Physics dept: skid.ps.uci.edu
	   Social sciences: ss.uci.edu
	Try fingering fname-lname@XX.uci.edu (for XX=ics,sanger.bio, etc.)

	There are two types of accunts on orion.oac.uci.edu:
	(1) Staff in the Office of Academic Computing
	(2) Students
	Staff userids on orion are usually FLLLLLLL, 8 char max.  The student
	accounts on orion are different, though.  Any student can get an orion
	account, but not a lot do.  The userids for these accounts are seven
	characters as follows: first "ea", then two characters representing
        major and grad vs. undergrad status, respectively, 
	(e.g., i = information & computer science, u = undergrad),
	then three random digits.  Non-staff orion users tend to use
	their accounts infrequently because of usage limits.

Univ. of California/Los Angeles (UCLA):
	CS: @cs.ucla.edu @oahu.cs.ucla.edu
      MATH: @math.ucla.edu, @sonia.math.ucla.edu, @oak.math.ucla.edu
		(graduate students, staff, faculty)
	EE grads & faculty: ee.ucla.edu (network of RTs and SUNs
	   running unix. Each machine has the name of a famous
	   engineer:  watt.ee.ucla.edu, joule.ee.ucla.edu, etc)
	   Usernames vary; try fname, lastname,...
	AGSM: @agsm.ucla.edu  @uclagsm
	      (Anderson Graduate School of Management)
	      All of students , staffs and faculty have their user ID.
	      User ID: FLLLLLLL (max 8 characters)
	Class Accounts: pic.ucla.edu (PIC = program in computing)
	   These get cleared every quarter. Account names are usually
	   the course number followed by three letters chosen by the student.
	   If you finger @laguna.pic.ucla.edu, you get more detailed
	   info, such as when the user last logged on, etc.
	Engineering: seas.ucla.edu  This is a server for a network for
	   the school of engineering and applied sciences. Any engineering
	   graduate student can get an account on it, and many undergrads
	   have accounts on it for classes. This machine has access to
	   USENET.
	Anybody: oac.ucla.edu  An IBM 3090.  Anyone in UCLA can get an
	   open access account on this to send mail, etc.  Account
	   names on this machine are terribly cryptic (such as IZZYR33). 

Univ. of California/Santa Cruz:
	Undergrads: ucscb.ucsc.edu
	Other hosts include ucsc{c-e,o}.ucsc.edu, ucscvm.ucsc.edu, etc.  All
	these hosts (except for ucscb) are on bitnet as the first part of
	their domain name.
	A new host, cats.ucsc.edu, has been added as the mail address for
	UCSC's version of Athena. Users can be fingered by username, first
	name, or last name. Undergrads, grads, faculty, and some staff may
	have accounts on cats.  Users choose their own IDs, so you must use
	finger to get an account name.
	As of late fall 1992, the name space of cats and ucscb have been
	merged, so that almost all students have the same userid on both
	systems.  However, there are (and will likely always be) separate
	accounts on the 2 systmes that use the same name - so there will
	remain differences between mailing to SomeAddress@cats and
	SomeAddress@ucscb.

Univ. of California/San Diego (UCSD):
	The primary mail gateway is ucsd.edu. This machine also has a
	smart finger program, which will look up names that sound similar
	to the one you fingered. Just "finger name@ucsd.edu".

	Most usernames are the initial of the first name followed by the
	last name, truncated to 8 characters, ie. "jfowler@ucsd.edu", but
	this is not always the case (because most people don't like their
	names truncated).

	Machine sdcc13 houses the student personal accounts at present, but
	mail to ucsd.edu will reach (almost) everyone on sdcc13.ucsd.edu.

	If the person is a graduate student, faculty member, or staff
	member try: weber (social sciences), cogsci (guess), bend
	(linguistics), crl (some developmental psychology people).

	Many, many other machines house course, faculty, staff, and research
	accounts.  Your best bet is to look the name up at ucsd.edu.

Univ. of Central Florida (Orlando)
	CS dept: only grad students are given accounts. finger
	  lastname@eola.cs.ucf.edu
	Engineering: finger initials@apocalypse.engr.ucf.edu
	General: ucf1vm.cc.ucf.edu.  (A bitnet node, so you cannot finger)

Univ. of Chicago:				Changed: Thu Jul  1 1993
	Undergraduates: midway.uchicago.edu (formerly tank.uchicago.edu)
	  (midway.uchicago.edu serves as a mail server for machines
	  named quads, ellis, and kimbark (.uchicago.edu). When midway
	  refuses connections, finger at one of the others.)
	Grads and faculty may also be on quads, ellis, or kimbark.
	CS Grads: gargoyle.uchicago.edu
	Math: zaphod.uchicago.edu
	Education: paideia.uchicago.edu
	Chemistry: pico.uchicago.edu
	Astronomy: oddjob.uchicago.edu (finger lastname)
	Social sciences (Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science):
	  cicero.spc.uchicago.edu [also accepts 'finger']
	Also Try: uchep.uchicago.edu

	Mhave accounts on rainbow.uchicago.edu, in
	  addition to having accounts on their own workstations.
	The University of Chicago now (fall91) runs the ph mail
	  system, so sending mail to finitial-lastname@uchicago.edu will
	  work if they've entered a real mailbox into their ph entry. 
	  In case of name conflict, add additional initials beyond the
	  first. Questions should be directed to advisor@midway.uchicago.edu.
	  Unfortunately few people bother to input their e-mail addresses.

Univ. of Chile (Universidad de Chile) (in Santiago, Chile, South America):
	Mathematics and Physical Sciences Campus (includes engineering)	
	  All students that ask for an account can get one on araucaria:
	    araucaria.cec.uchile.cl (Sun 690MP), uchcecvm.bitnet (IBM 390)
	  All students that have a class involving computers get an account on:
	    cipres.cec.uchile.cl    (Sun 690MP)
	  Professors, researchers, and research assistents:
	    tamarugo.cec.uchile.cl  (Sun 690MP)
	Computer Science (Departamento Ciencia de la Computacion)
	  All Computer Science students and professors have an account on:
	    dcc.uchile.cl           (Sun 4/470)
	  Professors, researchers, and grad students of Computer Science
	    tortel.dcc.uchile.cl    (Sun SS II)
	  For more information access the gopher server (using normal gopher
	  access or telnet/rlogin with login name "gopher") on tortel.

Univ. of Colorado/Boulder:			Changed: Tue Feb 23 1993
	Finger name@colorado.edu, where name is lastname, firstname, or
	  firstname-lastname.  At the upper right of the directory information
	  is a username and machine; their address is then
	  username@machine.colorado.edu
	Telnet to directory.colorado.edu, using username "directory".
	This lets you access the online phonebook/email address book.

Univ. of Connecticut:
	uconn.edu
	userid@nicky.uconn.edu
	CS Undergrads: ug1.eng1.uconn.edu
	CS Grads and Faculty: cse1.cse.uconn.edu 
	CS Research and Grads: sparc0.brc.uconn.edu

Univ. of Copenhagen (Dennmark):			Created: Wed Mar 24 1993
