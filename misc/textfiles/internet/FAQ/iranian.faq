    ===================================================================

And here are the answers:

    ===================================================================

    1q. Where is the Anonymous FTP site for soc.culture.iranian?
        How do I access it? What's available there?

    1a. Tehran.Stanford.EDU [36.28.0.189] is the main ftp site
        for soc.culture.iranian. A lot of useful information can be
        found by browsing through it. Whenver anonymous ftp is
        mentioned in this file, it is implied anonymous ftp to
        tehran.Stanford.EDU. Please use the following guidelines when
        using the ftp service:

            o use login name anonymous
            o enter your e-mail address as password
            o in order not to increase the load on tehran, try to use
              this service after business hours, Pacific Standard Time

        If you don't have access to ftp, you can get all the above via
        e-mail. Here's how it works:

            o send mail to sci-ftp@tehran.stanford.edu and in the
              Subject line write: "send info" (without the quotes).
              You will receive a mail from Mr. Background (daemon) at
              tehran with all the information and list of the files.
              (but PLEASE do not reply to daemon@tehran)
            o After you choose the file you want, e.g. gerdsooz.c just
              send mail to sci-ftp with subject line: "send gerdsooz.c" 
              and Tehran will send you a uuencoded file, gerdsooz.c
              All you need to do is, save your mail in a file and then
              run uudecode filename.
            o There is another feature that may be helpful. The list
              of files are too long and annoying, so Farhad has
              created a catalog of lists, to get the catalog menu,
              you use: "send info catalog"
              then you can choose from the menu of catalogs.
              i.e.  if you want a list of Noor publications then you
              use: "send list Noor"
            o remember capitalization is very important and All
              catalogs start with a capital letter (but there can be
              more than one capital letter, except pub).
            o Here is the list of catalogs:

                Archive             Recipes             Farrokhzad
                Calendar            Yellow_Pages        Kadkani
                Conferences         Shariati            Mazaheri
                Converters          Biographies         Moshiri
                Editors             Book_Reviews        Naderpoor
                Gerdsooz            Hafez               Sayeh
                Misc                Khayyam             Sepehri
                Schools             Molavi              Shamloo

                Poetry              Etesami             GIF

            o Currently all files greater that 150K are under
              construction and you can not retrieve them via email but
              they all are available through the normal anonymous ftp
              to Tehran.
            o Please if you find any problems or have better ideas
              then let me know (farhad@tehran.stanford.edu).
            o Also if you want to put new files into anonymous ftp
              then send mail to sci-ftp-request@tehran.stanford.edu
              and it will be put there.

        A partial list of what's available on Tehran follows [this
        list will continue to expand on a daily basis --mack].

        ===============================================================

        - Gerdsooz
                Path: Iran_Lib/Gerdsooz/

                o get and read the files sci_announce.gerdsooz and
                  README.gerdsooz in the above directory.

        ===============================================================

        - dispISCII
                Path: Iran_Lib/Dispiscii/
                Keeper/Maintainer: anoosh@sgi.com

                  display Persian text on workstations which support
                  the X11 Graphical User Interface. As stated by its
                  name, dispISCII displays bilingual text encoded with
                  the Iranian National Standard, ISCII.
                o get, uncompress, extract (tar) the file that suits
                  your hardware from the above directory.

        ===============================================================

        - khayyam
                Path: Iran_Lib/Calendar/
                Keeper/Maintainer: ali@mti.sgi.com

                o The 'khayam' program allows you to convert the
                  Jalaali and Gregorian calendars into each other.
                  The first is official in Iran (and surrounding areas
                  like Afghanistan, Central Asian Republics and
                  Kurdish Mesopotamia) and the second in the west. The
                  Jalaali calendar is named after Jalaal-ol-Din
                  Malek-shaah-e Saljuqi by the great Iranian
                  poet/mathematician Omar Khayyam who re-worked it in
                  late fifth century hejri.  The Gregorian calendar is
                  named after Pope Gregory XIII who introduced the
                  latest changes in the calendar in 1582 AD. The two
                  have more or less the same year-length, but are
                  based on completely different systems. They differ
                  in both structures and in the way they deal with
                  leap years.
                o get and read the file README.khayyam in the above
                  directory.

            => that sent me the forms I requested (via the touch-tone
            => interface). I was both surprised and delighted with the

            => This service is available even outside the regular

    3q. What are the Persian word processors? What are some of their
        features? Where can I get them? How much do they cost?

    3a. We have a fairly comprehensive input from:

        Good idea!!!
        
        I have been away quite a while myself, but I am back again, so
        I'll post my list about word-processing which could be
        included in such a FAQ-list.

        Latest change: Prof. Lagally's LaTeX macro's latest release
        (2), incompatible with previous releases.

        The list that hopefully says it all about farsi word-processing.

        Please feel free to make (or mail me) any corrections and/or
        additions to the list.

            AlKaatib:
                Is a right-to-left editor and comes with an Arabic
                font, in any case bitmaps. Is supposed to run under
                MultiFinder. You type your text in AlKaatib, and then
                copy and paste it into your favorite application
                (MacWrite, MS-Word, Excel etc.)
                Personally, I've used version 1.0 from an illegal copy
                back in 1986 for a while, but did not really like the
                concept, so I never bought it.

                According to recent news, the Mac line is no longer
                supported, but just the MS-DOS line.

            WinText:
                Is a mixed left-to-right, right-to-left wordprocessor.
                It uses AIS (Arabic Interface System) or PIS (Persian
                InterfaceSystem), the Apple systems for use with the
                Arabic script (see below). 
                I have been playing around with a demo-version and was
                quite impressed. However, I have heard rumours that it
                does not like large documents, but never seen real
                proof of this.
                The price was too steep for my intentional use (just
                personal correspondence).

            shareware one (posted by Ala), and an announcement I saved

            NEGAR-AFZAR
                This package which will be marketed by Negar-Afzar is
                a "Complete", "Fast" and highly "Integrated"
                implementation of TeX and LaTeX in Farsi. The user
                interface is completely in Farsi; hence the user
                actually sees the Farsi text as he/she types it on
                screen. This is accomplished by an advanced bilingual
                text editor that has a complete on-line help and is
                included in the package.

                The implementation is "complete" in the sense that all
                standard LaTeX style files which are
                    a) book
                    b) report
                    c) article
                    d) letter
                have been converted to Farsi.  "Any" LaTeX command
                that can be used in English version in these different
                styles can also be used in the Farsi version.  This
                means that the handling of footnotes, equations,
                section titles, table of contents, captions, automatic
                numbering, and anything else available in English
                LaTex is now available in the Farsi version.  The math
                mode handles Farsi digits and automatic size changing
                for these digits when they appear in sub or
                superscripts. You can also include any bitmap (.pcx
                format) picture (or EPS graphic file if using a
                postscript printer) in your document or use the
                LaTeX's picture environment for producing simple graphics.
                You can even type the LaTeX commands in Farsi. The
                implementation is extremely fast since the optimal
                line breaking is determined by TeX. The implementation
                has a simple Farsi GUI (graphical user interface) that
                leads the user through the 4 steps of preparing a
                LaTeX document  There is also a complete on-line help
                that can be called in case of having a question.

                The package comes with Farsi Naskh font, Farsi Slanted
                Naskh font, and Farsi Bold Naskh font at point sizes
                from 5pt to 25pt at LaTeX standard size increments.

            ARABTEX:

                package, the MetaFont package (for those interested), and
                the style files used by Arabtex. Most recent version: 2
                (spring 1992). The latest version has better support for
                Farsi. It worked wonderfully for me, both on my
                Sparcstation and on my Mac (with OzTeX, also a free
                package).

                A package also known as ATEX, as far as I know by Terry
                Regier (regier@cogsci.berkeley.edu). The drawback is that
                it needs a filter before you call LaTeX, but the filter is
                relatively simple and easily adjustable. Also it uses
                Yannis Haralambous (France) fonts, and I don't know
                whether these are still available in the public domain. He
                used to mail them to interested people, and I have a copy,
                but I don't know whether I have any rights to distribute
                them (see below).
                It worked fine for me however.

    4q. What are the radio frequencies and broadcast times of Farsi
        speaking radio programs and/or programs originating from Iran?

    4a. Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting

            Frequencies below 3000 kHz are medium wave broadcasts and
            can only be heard in areas in the immediate vicinity of
            Iran (unless you have an exceptional receiver and a
            special type of antenna). Receiving FM broadcasts abroad,
            on the other hand, is virtually impossible.

        the funds from any bank in the US to Bank Melli in New York
        along with the receiving party's name and address (or account
        number) in Iran. For a nominal fee, Bank Melli will transfer
        the funds to Iran within a few days.

    6q. What is the latest on military service/exemption?

    6a. From: bamini@athena.mit.edu

	I have some info on one of the unanswered questions in the FAQ,
	namely "What's the latest on millitary exemption/service?'

	From what I've been told by relatives in Iran, for a nominal
	fee of 8 to 10 *thousand* dollars, one can 'purchase' their
	exemption from millitary service.

	Also note that millitary service is mandatory for all Iranian
	men above a certian age (17?), and that the government has
	a rather loose interpretation of the definition of Iranian
	citizenship.  If your parents are Iranian, you are considered
	an Iranian citizen and eligible for service ***even if you were
	born in some other contry***  Even if you've lived in that other 
	country all your life.

   16a. Mr. Shahrokh Mortazavi has been kind enough to set up a
        posting service that can be used via e-mail. Here's what you
        need to do:

        E-mail regular posts to     : sci-poster@handel.sun.com
        E-mail problems to          : smortaz@handel.sun.com

    ===================================================================

   17q: I have heard one can send/receive e-mail to/from Iran. Is this
        correct?

   17a. Yes, it is correct that one can send/receive e-mail to/from
        Iran. The connection is made possible through a bitnet site in
        Europe. However due to very limited resources, few people
        (mostly universities and research institutions) get the
        priviledge of having e-mail access in Iran. Therefore,
        ordinary people can not get accounts on the machines that are
        connected to the network.

    ===================================================================

   18q. Can people in Iran read/post to SCI?

   18a. Yes! Currently SCI articles are being forwarded to a few
        individuals in iran via the SCI-by-email facility outlined in
        16a, and sometimes one can see articles posted by an
        individuals from Iran.
