==========================================================================
0. What is a CD-ROM?

   CD-ROM means "Compact Disc Read Only Memory".  A CD-ROM is physically
   identical to a Digital Audio Compact Disc used in a CD player, but the
   bits recorded on it are interpreted as computer data instead of music.
   You need to buy a "CD-ROM Drive" and attach it to your computer in
   order to use CD-ROMs.

   A CD-ROM has several advantages over other forms of data storage, and
   a few disadvantages.  A CD-ROM can hold about 650 megabytes of data,
   the equivalent of thousands of floppy discs.  CD-ROMs are not damaged
   by magnetic fields or the xrays in airport scanners.  The data on
   a CD-ROM can be accessed much faster than a tape, but CD-ROMs are
   10 to 20 times slower than hard discs.

   You cannot write to a CD-ROM.  You buy a disc with the data already
   recorded on it.  There are thousands of titles available.
==========================================================================
1. What are some good sources of CD-ROM discs?

  Jim Raehl has compiled an excellent list of sources for inexpensive
  CD-ROMs.  His list is periodically posted to alt.cd-rom, and is available
  via anonymous ftp from ftp.cdrom.com:/cdrom/faq_disc.

  You can get a list of about 85 CD-ROM titles by sending a blank message
  to CD-ROM@micromed.net.netcom.com  [ Several people have had trouble
  getting the list, so I have made it available for anonymous ftp from
  ftp.cdrom.com:/cdrom/micro.med ]

2. Can you recommend a good CD-ROM drive?
  ------------------------------------
  The most highly recommended drive is the Toshiba TXM-3401.  It is a very
  fast and very reliable drive.  It is reasonably priced, but you will also
  need to buy a SCSI controller card if you don't already have one.  This
  drive will work with MSDOS, Windows, OS/2, Windows-NT, Linux, Unix,
  Macintosh, and Amiga.
  ------------------------------------
  The NEC CD-ROM drives 336,37,73,74,83, etc. have received many favorable
  recommendations.  NEC CD-ROM drive information can be FAX'ed to you.  Call
  NEC Fastfacts at 800-366-0476, and then follow the directions.  You will
  be prompted for a Catalog or Product Number.  Catalog Number 2 is for

  For those who are contemplating buying a CD-ROM drive or just getting
  your feet wet, Tony Thomas wrote a pamphlet on the subject which he will
  be glad to send you FREE OF CHARGE while supplies last.

  To receive "GETTING STARTED WITH CD-ROM", send a self-addressed, stamped
  #10 envelope with 29 cents US postage to:

  Tony Thomas
  4421 Granada Blvd. #415
  Warrensville Heights, OH  44128

  Topics covered include:

  How to Buy a CD-ROM Drive
  Different Types of Drives
  What You Need
  Setup

  A list of suppliers of CD-ROM hardware and software is also included.

==========================================================================
5. Why are CD-ROM drives so slow?

   Compact discs were originally designed for music.  When you are
   listening to "Willie Nelson's Greatest Hits", you are accessing the
   data sequentially and at a very regular speed.  The only time you need
   to seek is when you decide to skip over a song, or back up and listen
   to "Always on my Mind" one more time.

   In order to fit as much music as possible onto the disc, the data
   is recorded at the same linear density near the outer edge of the disc
   as it is near the center, so there is more information in the outside
   tracks than in the inside tracks.  In order to deliver a steady rate
   of data, the linear velocity of the disc moving under the head is
   constant, so the angular velocity of the disc changes when the head
   moves from the center toward the outside tracks.  This is no big deal
   when you are playing music, but when you are trying to do random access
   to a CD-ROM, the need to accelerate and decelerate the disc is the biggest
   obstacle to making it faster.  Most magnetic discs spin at a constant
   angular velocity, so the data density decreases toward the outside of the
   disk, but seeks are faster.

   A few other reasons that CD-ROMs are slow:  Optical disc heads tend to be
   heavier than magnetic disk heads, so they have more inertia, and take
   longer to stablize onto a new track.  Many CD-ROMs contain too much data
   to make effective use of RAM caches.

   As time goes by, CD-ROM drives will get a little faster, but don't expect
   any miracles.

==========================================================================
6. Is it important to have a fast CD-ROM?  Does 300ms vs 700ms really matter?

   It depends on what applications you will be using.  Many CD-ROMs
   are just big archives of stuff, and you can copy individual programs
   to your hard disk before using them so speed is not really very
   important.  But if you are going to be using large ramdom-access
   databases, or any kind of interactive multi-media applications, then
   the speed difference is very noticeable.

==========================================================================
7. Is it important to buy a fully SCSI compatible drive?

   Several CD-ROM drives only support a sub-set of SCSI, and usually
   come with their own semi-SCSI controller card.  Full SCSI compatible
   drives usually cost more, but are better if you already have a SCSI
   controller and want to daisy chain several devices, or if you want to
   be able to use the drive on different machine types.

==========================================================================
8. Where can I get information on SCSI controllers for CD-ROM drives?
 
  Many SCSI drive vendors recommend the Adaptec 1542-B SCSI Card.
  The phone number for Adaptec is 800-959-7274 or 408-945-2550.

  BusLogic (formerly BusTek) makes a very extensive line of SCSI cards for
  ISA, EISA, MCA, and VL bus systems.  Their ISA, EISA, and MCA cards are
  register compatible with Adaptec's boards and hence have excellent driver
  support.  Their number is (408)492-9090.

  All modern Macintosh computers have SCSI built-in. Macintosh users should
  insure that the CD-ROM drive they intend to buy is supported on Macintosh
  machines by the vendor; many vendors recommend "FWB CD-ROM Toolkit", which
  can generate high-performance drivers that include cacheing (see [50]) for 
  a modest price.

  Trantor has a BBS at 510-656-5159.   Set modem to 8 bits data, 1 stop
  bit and no parity.  You can get product information, and their latest
  drivers there.

  [ If anyone sends me info on other scsi controllers, I will include
    the info here. ]

==========================================================================
9. How much does it cost to make a CD-ROM?

  You can get a master made for about $1000, and then about $1 per disc
  for duplication.  So to make 1000 discs, it will cost you about
  ($1000 + (1000 * $1)) = $2000.  Publishers often have `first-timer'
  specials with steep discounts off the list price.  For instance, DMI
  recently had a special of mastering, 50 discs, and two hours of tech
  support for $750.

  If you only want a few discs, you can have single ISO-9660 `one-offs'
  made for about $200 for the first disc, and $100 for additional copies.
==========================================================================
10. I have a great idea for a CD-ROM but no money.  What can I do?

  You can author a CD-ROM, and have someone else publish it and pay you
  royalties.  One company that does this is Walnut Creek CDROM.  Their
  author guidelines are available by anonymous ftp from ftp.cdrom.com in the
  file /pub/cdrom/author.txt.

==========================================================================
11. Where can I get a CD-ROM published?

  I have used both of these companies, and highly recommend either:

  There are several usenet groups dedicated to CDROM publishing:
  comp.publish.cdrom.hardware
  comp.publish.cdrom.software
  comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia

  The November issue (I think) of New Media magazine is their 1994 Tool Guide.
  One section is devoted to cd-rom recording systems, and has information on
  about 20 systems covering the Mac, PC, and Unix platforms.

  The October issue of the New Media had an article about recordable CD
  technology. The February 1993 issue of Byte magazine also had an article
  on that subject. That might be easier to find at your local library.

  "The CD-Recordable Bible: An Essential Guide for Any Business" is available
  for $24.95 plus $3 postage and handling (US/Canada) from Eight Bit Books,
  462 Danbury Rd., Wilton, CT 06897-2126.You can call in your order to
  (800) 248-8466 or FAX it to (203) 761-1444.

13.  Where can I get blank media for my CD-ROM recorder?

  The blank discs for CD Recorders are not the same as a normal CD.  The
  metal data surface is gold instead of aluminum.  The recorder uses a high
  powered laser to modify a dye layer which is between the gold and the
  plastic.  This dye is somewhat photo sensitive so write once CDs should be
  stored in a dark place.  They should be stored in an area that does not
  rise above 40 Celsius (104 F).  It takes about half an hour to burn each
  disc.

  The blanks come in two sizes.  63 minute, and 74 minute.  The time refers
  to the amount of digital audio that can be recorded.  Since DA is read
  from the discs at a constant rate of 150 kb/sec, it is easy to calculate
  the amount of data they will hold.  The 63' discs will hold about 580 meg,
  and the 74' discs will hold about 660 meg.

  Here are several sources for blank discs:

15. Are there any organizations of CD-ROM Publishers?

  The Optical Publishing Association is a non-profit trade and professional 
  organization for CDROM and other digital media publishers.  They have been 
  around since 1988, publishing newsletters and backgrounders for publishers, 
  and promoting profitable practices for the business.

  OPA, PO Box 21268, Columbus OH 43221 USA, 614/442-8805, 614/442-8815 (fax)
  CIS address 71333,1114, 71333.1114@compuserve.com, AppleLink r.bowers.

==========================================================================
16. Where can I get more information about CD-ROM publishing?

  Subscribe to CD-ROM Professional Magazine, 1 800 248-8466, $39.95/year

  There is a mailing list devoted to CD-ROM publishing.  For more information
  send a message to Mail-Server@knex.via.mind.org with the word "HELP" in
  the body of the email text.  The cdpub digest archives are available by
  anonymous ftp from ftp.cdrom.com:/pub/cdrom/cdpub.

  There are several files pertaining to CD-ROM publishing available for
  anonymous ftp from ftp.cdrom.com.

  There is a book called "PUBLISH YOURSELF ON CD-ROM" by Fabrizio Caffarelli
  and Dierdre Straughan.  It includes a cd-rom with a copy of EasyCD, a
  cd-rom formatter that runs under Windows.

  For Macintosh, read  "The Apple CD-ROM Handbook", Addison-Wesley, 92,
  (144 pages).  A guide to planning, creating, and producing a CD-ROM.
==========================================================================
17. How much information will fit on a CD-ROM?

  It depends on the drive.  Almost all CD-ROM drives will handle up to
  620 megabytes with no problems.  Many newer drives can read discs with
  over 700 megs.  

  The CD-ROM Users Group (see above) has a diagnostic CD-ROM that
  will tell you how much information your drive can handle.

==========================================================================
18. Why doesn't MSCDEX work with DOS 5.0?

  You must use SETVER with MS-DOS 5.0, to make MSCDEX 2.20 work properly.
  Otherwise you will get an incorrect DOS version message.  See the MS-DOS
  5.0 documentation on how to use SETVER.  MSCDEX 2.21 works with MS-DOS 5.0
  without SETVER.
==========================================================================
19. Where can I get the latest version of MSCDEX?

  Call MS BBS at 206-936-4082.  Choose F for file library, S UPDATES, F to
  list files, then D MSCDEX.ZIP to download the file.  (Microsoft may have
  deleted this file.)

  You can get the latest version of MSCDEX (2.21) in a self-extracting zip
  archive via anonymous ftp from ftp.cdrom.com:/cdrom/cdext.exe.

  It is also available in the MSL library on CompuServe, as CDEXT.EXE.
==========================================================================
20. I bought a used drive at a garage sale.  Where can I find a driver for it?

  Many CD-ROM manufacturers maintain BBS's where you might be able to find
  drivers for their drives:

  NEC BBS:      +1 508 635-6328
  Philips BBS:  +1 719-593-4081
  Sony BBS:     +1 408 955-5107
  Pioneer:      +1 408 748 2105 (9600/HST/8N1)
==========================================================================
21. What is the difference between `High Sierra' and ISO-9660?

  Not much.  When the standard was first proposed, it was given the name
  "High Sierra'.   Later it was adopted as an offical standard, with a few
  minor modifications, and was designated ISO-9660.  Usually when someone
  says "High Sierra", they really mean ISO-9660.

  You can get a copy of the High Sierra Spec from the author for $30.

22. Where can I get a copy of the ISO-9660 standard?

  You can order a copy of the ISO-9660 standard from 

  ANSI
  Attn: Sales
  11 West 42nd Street
  New York, NY 10036 
  212-642-4900

  Cost to US destinations is $50, plus $6 shipping.  They now accept Visa/MC
  orders over the phone.

  Another source of a wide variety of standards documents is Global
  Engineering.  Their service is often faster than ANSI, but they charge
  more ($104 for ISO-9660).  They also have offices in Europe and Asia.

  ISO standards may be purchased from a country's national standards
  body. In the USA, this is ANSI, in the UK it is BSI (British Standards
  Institute in London), in Switzerland, SNV (in Zurich), DIN in Germany,
  AFNOR in France, JSA in Japan, etc.

23. What is an HFS disc?

  HFS is the Macintosh's Hierarchical Filing System.  It is unrelated
  to High Sierra and ISO-9660 formats.  Most CD-ROMs intended for the
  Macintosh are created in the HFS format, since HFS supports the Mac's
  resource and data forks and file information.

  The freely distributable filing system AmiCDROM is able to read HFS
  disks on an Amiga.  AmiCDROM is freeware, and is available by anonymous
  FTP from any Aminet site, including ftp.cdrom.com in the directory
  /pub/aminet/disk/cdrom.  The Aminet archive is also available on CDROM
  for $29.95 from Walnut Creek CDROM, 1-800-786-9907, info@cdrom.com.

  There are drivers made by AsimWare (AsimCDFS) and Xetec that allows HFS
  discs to be read on an Amiga.  There is a list of differences that the
  drivers contends with, such as non-standard characters and 32 character
  filenames (Amiga supports only 30).

24. Can you give a short explaination of ISO-9660?

  ISO-9660 is an international standard that defines a filesystem for
  CD-ROMs.  Almost all systems support ISO-9660.  

  Level one ISO-9660 is similar to an MS-DOS filesystem.  Filenames are
  limited to eight single-case characters, a dot, and a three character
  extension.  Filenames cannot contain special characters, (no hyphens,
  tildes, equals, or pluses).  Only single case letters, numbers, and
  underscores.  Directory names cannot have the three digit extension,
  just eight single-case characters.

  All alphabetics are in UPPER case; some software maps this to lower case.
  Either the file name or the extension may be empty, but not both ("F."
  and ".E" are both legal file names).

  There is a "File Version Number" which can range from 1-32767, and is
  separated from the extension by a semi-colon.  The file version number
  is ignored on many systems.

  Here are some examples of legal and illegal filenames:

         Legal                   Illegal                 Why
        TEST_1C.TXT             TEST-1C.TXT             hyphen
        TEST1C.TXT              TEST 1C.TXT             space
        TEST.1C                 TEST.1C.TXT             more than 1 period
        README                  Readme                  not single case

  Subdirectories are allowed to nest up to eight levels deep.

  Level two ISO-9660 allows longer filenames, up to 32 characters.
  But many of the other restrictions still apply.  Level two discs
  are not usable on some systems, particularly MS-DOS.

==========================================================================
25. What the heck does `Red Book', `Yellow Book', etc. mean?

  "Red Book" is the common name of the "Compact Disc Digital Audio
  Standard".  When a disc conforms to the red book standard, it will
  usually have "digital audio" printed below the "disc" logo.  Most music
  CDs conform to this standard.

  "Yellow Book" is the standard for CD-ROM.  When a disc conforms to the
  yellow book, it will usually say "data storage" beneath the "disc" logo.

  "Green Book" is the CD-I (compact disc interactive) standard.

  "Orange Book" is the standard for write-once compact discs.

  "Blue Book" is the standard for LaserDisc. **

   The Orange Book is still proprietary to Philips and Sony, and available
   only to their licensees.

  [If anyone can tell me where the other standards are available, I will
  include that information here.]

  ** [ "Blue Book" may be apochryphal.  Pioneer reportly has a pre-mastering
       guide that may or may not have a blue cover, but it is not a statement
       of the LD standard.

       The only standards found so far are IEC-857 (NTSC) or IEC-856 (PAL).
       In the US, the only reliable source for these is Global Engr Documents.
       They aren't cheap.

       '857 only covers the analog portions of LD.  It does not include
       digital audio, TOC, LD-ROM, LD+G, CDV-5 or anything peculiar to
       Laser Karaoke. ]

==========================================================================
26. What is CD-I?

  CD-I means "Compact Disc Interactive".  It is meant to provide a standard
  platform for mass consumer interactive multimedia applications.  So it is
  more akin to CD-DA, in that it is a full specification for both the
  data/code _and_ standalone playback hardware:  a CD-I player has a CPU,
  RAM, ROM, OS, and audio/video/(MPEG) decoders built into it.  Portable
  players add an LCD screen and speakers/phonejacks.

==========================================================================
27. What is CD-ROM/XA?

  CD-ROM/XA is an extension to the Yellow Book Standard.  A track on
  a CD-ROM/XA disc can contain computer data, compressed audio data,
  and video/picture data.  Many CD-ROM drives do not support CD-ROM/XA.

  CD-ROM/XA extends CD-ROM by adding some of the CD-I disc features (such
  as using Mode 2 tracks with interleaved compressed-audio and other data).
  Thus CD-ROM/XA (eXtended Architecture) is often called the "Bridge" format
  between CD-ROM and CD-I... though the relationship is mostly the sector
  types.  CD-ROM/XA applications still require specific code for each target
  platform.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CDROM-XA specifies a `bridge format' so that a CDROM-XA disc can be read
  on a CD-I player as well as on a PC under MSCDEX (provided that you use
  a conforming (.SYS) driver. On a normal yellow-book CDROM, a data track
  contains only mode-1 data sectors. On a CDROM-XA, a (the) data track
  contains only mode-2 data sectors. A mode-2 sector can be of two formats,
  form-1 and form-2. A form-1 sector contains 2048 bytes of user data,
  together with EDC and ECC bytes. A form-2 sector contains 2324 bytes of
  raw data (e.g. ADPCM audio or video data). If the device driver delivers
  2048 bytes of data when MSCDEX asks for it, regardless whether the sector
  is mode-1 or mode-2/form-1, the PC is CDROM-XA compatible.

==========================================================================
28. What are the Rock Ridge extensions?

  The Rock Ridge extensions use some undefined fields in the ISO-9660 standard
  to allow full Unix-like filenames, symbolic links, and deep directories.

  "Rock Ridge" is named after the town in the movie "Blazing Saddles" for no
  particular reason.

  The latest revision of the RRIP/SUSP is 1.10; the draft version of these
  documents is available by e-mail from cdfsf@ymi.com or ftp at
  ftp.cdrom.com (/pub/rockridge/new).

  Any comments regarding the Rock Ridge or System Use Sharing Protocol
  documents should be addressed to cdfsf@ymi.com.

  For information on Rock Ridge at Sun, try rrinfo@Eng.Sun.COM or 
  cdgroup@fantasy.eng.sun.com.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Eric Youngdale has written a Gnu-ware ISO-9660+Rockridge formatter.
  It has been tested on both Linux and SunOS 4.1.3.  You can ftp it
  from ftp.cdrom.com:/pub/cdrom/mkisofs-1.00.tar.gz. 
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Kodak's Build-It product, which is basically a system for authoring Portfolio
  Photo CDs, can also author non-Photo-CD ISO 9660 discs, with or without the
  Rock Ridge extensions. It runs on SunOS 4.1.3, and requires a SPARCStation 2
  or SPARCStation 10 with at least 64 megs of RAM. It requires the Kodak
  PCD Writer 200, and a second SCSI port for the writer.

  Information about Build-It can be obtained by anonymous FTP from the Kodak
  FTP server, ftp.kodak.com, in the directory photo-cd/portfolio.

28b. Which systems support Rock Ridge

  OS                        Version
  ===                       ==== 
  Linux                     0.98
  FreeBSD                   1.0
  386BSD                    ???
  BSDI BSD/386              V0.9.3
  SunOS                     4.1.2
  Solaris                   1.0
  NeXT                      3.1
  SVR4.2
  DG/UX                     3.00

  The "Version" is the first version that included official support for R.R.
  Please let me know any other systems that include R.R. support.  I am
  also interested in any plans to support R.R. in the near future.

  ------

  Under Novell NetWare 3.11, Micro Design's SCSI Express (Version 1.3.0)
  supports mounting Rock Ridge CD-ROMs as standard NetWare mountable
  volumes.  Then through NetWare NFS, any UNIX client can access the
  CD-ROMs (including access to the RockRidge attributes).  Also DOS, OS/2,
  and MAC clients can access the same CD-ROMs.

==========================================================================
29. What is ECMA 168?

  ECMA 168 is a volume and file format standard for write-once CD and CD-ROM.
  It was approved as a European standard by the ECMA General Assembly in June
  of 1992. It provides for full Orange Book functionality, including
  multisession recording, track-at-once recording, and packet recording.
  When used with an Orange Book writer, this will allow write-once CD to
  be used more like a general-purpose storage peripheral than is possible
  using ISO 9660. ECMA 168 also incorporates the functionality of Rock Ridge:
  the ability to use Unix-style filenames, Unix permissions, and deep directory
  hierarchies. Much thought was put into character set issues, and ECMA 168
  accommodates multiple-byte character sets such as ISO 10646. Although
  ECMA 168 is not upward-compatible with ISO 9660, it is possible to write
  a "conformant disc" containing both sets of volume and file structures.
  If such a disc is Yellow Book compatible (a CD-ROM or a CD-WO written 
  disc-at-once), it could be read on either an ISO 9660 system or an ECMA
  168 system. There are many common elements between ECMA 168 and ECMA
  167, which is a new standard intended primarily for WORM and erasable
  optical disks. Hopefully this will encourage developers to support both
  standards.

  The title of the standard is "Volume and File Structure of Read-Only and
  Write-Once Compact Disc Media for Information Interchange".  This standard
  expands upon the ISO-9660 CD-ROM standard.

  At the current time, I do not know of any companies which support ECMA 168
  in their products.

  A new draft international standard on CD-ROM/CD-WO format:

        ISO/IEC DIS 13490 Volume and File Structure of Read-only
        and Write-once Compact Disc Media for Information Interchange

  is currently undergoing letter ballot process and voting may
  end at end of August, 1993.

  DIS 13490 is also the ECMA Standard 168, which is derived from
  the Frankfurt Group proposal. Copies of this draft standard
  should be available at the ANSI or ECMA office.

  DIS 13490 is designed to support both the CD-ROM (yellow book) and
  CD-WO (orange book) conforming media.  In addition,  DIS 13490 removed
  many unnecessary restrictions of ISO 9660, and is compatible
  with ISO 9660 at the directory and file structures level.
  DIS 13490 conforming discs can also be made to be read
  by both ISO 9660 and DIS 13490 conforming receiving systems.

  The ECMA 168 specification is available by anonymous ftp from
  ftp.cdrom.com in the directory pub/cdrom/ecma168.

==========================================================================
30. Is a short technical introduction to these standards available?

  The file ftp.apple.com(130.43.2.3): /pub/cd-rom/cd-rom.summary gives
  a short techie introduction to compact disc technology.

  There is a good short general article on CD-Rom and its's many
  variations (CD-XA, CD-I, CDTV, PhotoCD) called MULTIMEDIA IN A MUDDLE
  by Barry Fox in the New Scientist (London, ISSN# 0262-4079) vol. 131
  no. 1787 (Sep 21, 1991) pp.35-38

  ----

  There is a very good article by Bill and Lynne Jolitz "Inside the
  ISO-9660 Filesystem Format" in the December 1992 Dr. Dobbs Journal.
  Detailed source code examples are provided.  They are planning followup
  articles covering Rock Ridge, CDI and CDROM-XA.

  ----

  The SAMS book "Principles of Digital Audio" by Ken C. Pohlmann (ISBN
  0-672-22634-0) deals primarily with audio CDs but there are sections
  dealing with CD-ROM, CD-I, DVI, CD-V, CD-WO, Erasable CD, CD + G and
  CD + MIDI.

  ----
  There is a good brief explaination of all these standards in the paper

      "Compact Disc Terminology"
      Nancy Klocko
      Disc Manufacturing Inc.
      1409 Foulk Road, Suite 202
      Wilmington, DE  19803
      1-800-433-DISC

  Here is some information from the paper:

  Standards:

  Red Book == CD-Audio

  Yellow Book == CD-ROM
    Mode-1 is for computer data
    Mode-2 is for compressed audio data and video/picture data

  CD-ROM/XA == an EXTENSION to Yellow Book and defines a new type of track. 

    CD-ROM Mode 2, XA Format, is used for computer data, compressed audio
    data, and video/picture data.  A CD-ROM / XA track may interleave Mode 2
    compressed audio and Mode 2 data sectors.  Additional hardware is needed
    to separate these when playing the disc.  The hardware is programmed to
    separate the audio from the data, decompress the audio and play it out
    through the audio jacks.  At the same time, the hardware passes the data
    to the computer.

    NOTE:  Additional hardware is needed to play a CD-ROM / XA disc.  Several
    vendors offer an XA interface board that will allow an existing CD-ROM
    drive to play CD-ROM / XA discs.

  Green Book == Compact Disc Interactive (CD-I)

  Orange Book == Recordable Compact disc Standard
    Part I - CD-MO (Magneto Optical)
      Consists of optional Pre-Mastered (READ-ONLY) area and a Recordable
      (re-writable) user area.
    Part II - CD-WO (Write Once)
      Orange Book Part II also defines a second type of CD-WO disk called
      a "Hybrid Disc".  This disc consists of a Pre-recorded Area and a
      Recordable Area.  The Pre-recorded area is a READ ONLY area where
      the information is manufactured into the disc.  (This area is written
      per the Red, Yellow, and Green Book specifications, and can be played
      on any CD-Player.)  The Recordable areas are where additional
      recordings can be made in one or more sessions.  Only the first
      session on the disc is readable by todays CD-Players; additional
      software will be needed to read the additional sessions.

      A TOC (Table of Contents) is written during each recording session.
      Disc will have multiple TOCs, one for each recording session.

      Photo-CD is an example of a "Hybrid Disc".

   CD-Bridge Disc

      The CD-Bridge Disc defines a way to add additional information in
      a CD-ROM / XA track in order to allow the track to be played on a
      CD-I player.  the result is a disc that can be played on both a
      CD-I player connected to a TV set and on a CD-ROM / XA player
      connected to a computer.

      An example of a CD-Bridge Disc is the new Photo-CD disc.  The
      Photo-CD disc will be playable in CD-I players, Kodak's Photo CD
      players and in computers using CD-ROM/XA drives.

   Photo-CD
      The Photo CDs will be Mode 2 Form 1 sectors per the CD-ROM / XA
      specifications.  The disc will be written per the Orange Book Part
      II "Hybrid Disc" specifications.  This will allow photographs to be
      written to the disc in several different sessions.  Additionally,
      the disc will use the CD-Bridge disc format to allow the disc to be
      readable by both CD-I and CD-ROM / XA players.

      The photographs written to the disc in the first session will use
      the ISO 9660 format.  These photographs will be readable with the
      existing CD-ROM / XA players connected to a computer running new
      software written for the Photo CD picture structure.  Additionally,
      the photographs will be displayable on CD-I Players and Photo CD
      Players connected to a TV set.

      Photographs written to disc after the first session will be
      displayable on CD-I Players and Photo CD players.  New software
      and/or firmware will be needed to read these additional photographs
      with existing CD-ROM/XA players.

==========================================================================
31. Who comes up with these standards?  Can I have any input to the process?

  In the case of the colored books, they have been developed by engineers
  within Philips and Sony. Few people outside these companies have input into
  the process.

  The file format standards (ISO 9660, Rock Ridge, and ECMA 168) have all
  been developed originally by ad-hoc groups of interested people from
  various companies in the industry, then have been submitted to established
  standards organizations (ECMA, ANSI, ISO) for further work there.

  The CD-ROM Architecture Working Group is an official Standards working 
  Group under the auspices of the IEEE Computer Society by way of the
  Standards Committee for Optical Disks and Multimedia Platforms (SCODMP)
  chaired and sponsored by Dr. Lawrence Welsch, PhD.  Mike Rubinfeld is
  presently the Chair of the working group.  They are working in accordance
  with a Project Authorization Request (PAR) for the development of a CD-ROM
  architecture profile that hopefully will be made into an international
  standard.  The PAR was approved by the Standards Activity Board (SAB) of
  the IEEE/CS last June and the Architecture Profile will probably be ready
  for balloting by August, 1993.

33. How do I write an MSDOS program that can access a cdrom using MSCDEX?

  The MSCDEX interface documentation is available on the Microsoft Programmer's
  Library CD-ROM.  This also has detailed specifications for drivers that talk
  to MSCDEX.  It even provides solutions to a number of sticky problems.

  The file mscdex21.zip contains Microsoft's info on how to talk to the
  CD-ROM extensions (MSCDEX.EXE) and a sample DOS application which is crude
  but effective in playing audio tracks.  This file is available via
  anonymous ftp from ftp.cica.indiana.edu:/pub/pc/win3/uploads/mscdex21.zip
  or cdrom.com:/cdrom/mscdex21.zip.

  MSCDEX programming information can be found in INTER31?.ZIP.  Ralf Brown's 
  interrupt bible.  The information is very complete.  The interrupt list

34. How do I mount an ISO-9660 disc on a Sun?

 a. SunOS 4.1.x:

    Su to root and run this command,
      # mount -r -t hsfs /dev/sr0 /cdrom
    or even better, put the following line in your /etc/fstab
      /dev/sr0   /cdrom hsfs ro 0 0
    and then run
      # mount /cdrom

    Don Trimmer, of Delta Microsystems, has written a program that allows
    safe mount/umount operations without requiring super user permissions.
    You can get his program by anonymous ftp from cdrom.com:/cdrom/mount.c

 b. Sun Solaris 2.2 and later

    Just insert the CD-ROM in the drive. If it's a HSFS format disk, it
    will get mounted automatically (under /cdrom). If it's a UNIX fileystem
    format, it will also get mounted automatically.  It it's an audio disk,
    nothing will happen UNLESS you have enabled audio CD's, by uncommenting
    or adding this line to the end of /etc/rmmount.conf and restarted "vold":
          action cdrom action_workman.so /bin/workman
    (changing /bin/workman to wherever workman or some other Audio CD player 
    program is located). Actions are being developed for other types of CD's.

37. How do I read an audio cd track as digital data?

  Most CD-ROM drives cannot decode audio information.  There are
  firmware and data path reasons why it doesn't work.

  The following drives have can do digital audio extraction over the SCSI bus:

  Apple 300, 300i (Sony CDU-8003, CDU-8003A)
  Apple's "New" CD (Matsushita CR-8004)
  Chinon CDS-535 (note: needs v2.0 firmware "Q20" or "R20")
  NEC CDR 500, CDR 510, CDR 600 (MultiSpin 3x series)
  NEC CDR 400 (MultiSpin 3xp portable)
  NEC CDR 900 (MultiSpin 4x Pro quadruple speed)
  NEC CDR 84-1 (74-1) only with special new firmware upgrade from NEC
  Sony CDU-561
  Toshiba XM 3301TE (Silicon Graphics version)
  Toshiba XM 3401TA, XM 3401B
  Toshiba XM 3401TE (Silicon Graphics, and Sun versions)
  Toshiba XM 4101TA

  The Hitachi 6750S might, if the rumors prove true

  On an Amiga, you may use the program 'cddarip' to extract audio
  data from a Toshiba TXM-3401 drive. The program 'PlayCDDA' reads any
  audio track from an audio disk in a Toshiba TXM-3401 drive and
  reproduces the digitized sound on the Amiga's internal loudspeaker.
  Both programs are freely distributable, and can are available via
  anonymous FTP from any Aminet site, e.g. ftp.cdrom.com in the
  directory /pub/aminet/disk/cdrom.

  On a Macintosh you can put the CD into an Apple 300 CD-ROM, and using
  QuickTime 1.6, record the music (at 44KHz) to your (hopefully very large)
  hard drive as a QT soundtrack. At that point there are a number of tools
  available to edit and massage the sound, and change the file format into
  something else.

  For the Toshiba drives, you issue a MODE SELECT command with density
  code 0x82 and then all read's with an lba inside a digital audio track
  will return 2352 bytes audio samples / block.

  There are several ways to read digital audio from Sony CDU 561
  and Sony CDU 8003 mechanisms. Note that the technique of merely
  setting the density (0x82) using MODE SELECT SCSI command as on
  Toshiba TXM-3401s will not work.
 
  Here are three ways to read digital audio Red Book standard
  audio track data across the SCSI bus into your computer complete
  with all sound processing already performed (For example the
  CIRC routine already run and the output is LRLRLR pairs of 16
  bit digital audio samples 2352 bytes per CD-ROM block.
 
  Method 1 : READ CD-DA scsi command 0xD8

  Byte 0: D8
  1: <LUN stuff> 0
  2: <4th most significant byte of logical block address>
  3: <3rd byte>
  4: <2nd>
  5: <1st, lowest of the address>
  6: <4th most significant byte of transfer length
  7: <3rd byte>
  8: <2nd>
  9: <1st, lowest of the number of contiguos blocks to transfer>
  10: <special sub code selector> (0 == normal 2352, other values
      are 01, 02, 03)
  11: <control>
   
  Method 2 : READ CD-DA MSF scsi command 0xD9
   
  byte 0: D9
  1: <LUN stuff> 0
  2: 0
  3: <starting minute in binary not BCD>
  4: <starting second in binary not BCD>
  5: <starting frame (75th of a second) in binary not BCD>
  6: 0
  7: <ending minute in binary not BCD>
  8: <ending second in binary not BCD>
  9: <ending frame (75th of a second) in binary not BCD>
  10: <special sub code selector> (0 == normal 2352 each, other
      values are 01, 02, 03)
  11: <control>
   
  For this one you will need to remember how to convert MSF to
  logical (LBA) address to set the SCSI transfer length correctly
  to avoid the Mac SCSI manager reporting a phase error. to
  calculate the number of bytes total you will get use the formula:

  ((Me-Ms)*60*75 + (Se-Ss) * 75 + (Fe-Fs)) * (2352)
   
  Method 3 : MODE SELECT (6) 0x15
   
  This is a very complex topic to discuss, but if you know how to
  use the SCSI mode select page commands the third more direct
  (and jitter filled) method to get digital audio across the SCSI
  bus on the new SONY devices is to set the block length of the
  volatile settings in the 6th 7th and 8th bytes of the Block
  descriptor section of a MODE select list with 0 or more pages
  (12 bytes for none) to a setting of either 2352, 2368, or 2448.
  You want 2352, but I have not tried this technique and Sony
  recommends the special streaming commands.
   
  WARNING: for high quality use large transfers but QUICKLY
  reissue another command as soon as a command is completed. The
  head must never come to a rest for 100% pure results.

  -------

  The format of a CD-DA sector, that the Toshiba TXM-3401 returns, is not
  too complicated: each sector contains 2352 bytes, these are devided
  into 588 16-bit signed stereo samples of 4 bytes each. The 16-bit
  samples are returned in 'low byte first' (i386, ...) byte order. The
  16-bit samples in the sector are intended alternating for the left and
  right channel, starting with the left channel.

    struct cdda_sector {
      struct cdda_sample {
        char left_channel_lsb;
        char left_channel_msb;
        char right_channel_lsb;
        char right_channel_msb;
      } samples[588];
    };

  Specifications, Ver. 6.0, Issued Jul., 1992".  The cost is $7.64 + $4
  shipping.  Note that this is extremely technical material, and won't be
  useful to the average user.

==========================================================================
39. Why do all the bundle deals require me to buy a drive?  What if I
    already have a drive?

   Many disc producers sell outdated or surplus discs at steep discounts
   to be bundled with new drives.  The theory is that the new drive owner
   will find the discs useful, and order the latest version at full price.

   There are some bundle deals that do not require you to buy a new drive.
   For instance, the CD-ROM User's Group (see above) has a bundle of ten
   discs for $99.
   
==========================================================================
40. Are alt.cd-rom archives available anywhere?

   Starting in January 1994, the archives for the following newsgroups
   are available via anonymous ftp from ftp.cdrom.com in the directory
   /pub/cdrom/usenet:

       alt.cd-rom
       aus.cdrom
       aus.computers.cdrom

       comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.cd-rom
       de.alt.cdrom
       unibase.bitnet.cdromlan

   You can retrieve old alt.cd-rom articles via email:

     For a list of files available, send the message
       INDEX CDROM-L
     as the first line of your e-mail message to:
       LISTSERV@UCCVMA.BITNET
     or the Internet form of address:
       LISTSERV@UCCVMA.UCOP.EDU

    To retrieve an archived message, send the e-mail message
      GET CDROM-L LOGyymm
    or  SENDME CDROM-L LOGyymm      as above
    where yymm is the year and month of the archive wanted.
    e.g. LOG9110 = Log of October 91 messages.

==========================================================================
41. What is the shelf-life of a CD-ROM?

  If a CD-ROM is not manufactured properly, the lifetime can be very
  short, perhaps only a few years.  This can happen if the edge of the
  disc is not properly sealed, and oxygen reaches the metal surface.

  If the disc is manufactured properly, it will last a very long time.
  Most CD-ROMs should last for more than a human lifetime.

  Philips has proposed new standards for testing CD-ROMs that are expected
  to result in discs that will enjoy a life span of more than a thousand
  years.  For more information see Fox, Barry "CD Makers Perform in Unison
  to Stop the Rot" New Scientist 134(1815) (April 4, 1992):19.

  The laser used in a CD-ROM drive is very low power, and does not
  harm the disc in any way.  Reading the disc will not shorten
  the lifetime.

==========================================================================
42. How should I handle my CD-ROMs?  How do I clean them?

  The following guidelines represent the current thinking for the care
  and handling of CD-ROM discs, by a number of CD-ROM disc and drive
  manufacturers.  The validity and usefulness of most of these
  guidelines have not been substantiated by government testing and
  therefore are presented for information only.

  Wash your hands before contact with the disc.  If available, wear
  lint-free cloth gloves, finger cots, or talc-free latex gloves.

  If you must wipe the disc, do so with a soft, dry, lint-free cloth in
  a radial motion- that is from the inner to the outer hub- not in a
  circular motion around the disc like you might do for a phonograph
  record.  The most devastating scratches are those which occur along a
  circular arc of the disc which can obscure a long stream of pits.

  Certain cleaning agents and solvents can damage the discs.  Some of
  these include: gasoline, paint thinners, benzine, acetone, carbon
  tetrachloride, chlorinated cleaning solvents, ammonia, and household
  detergents which contain ammonia.  Do not clean with a water soaked
  cloth.  The use of Isopropyl alcohol, the ingredient in many
  commercial CD cleaning products, as well as certain waxes and acrylic
  liquids, is still questionable.

  Do not clean the label side of the disc.

  Use of a CD-ROM caddy is highly recommended during transport and
  operation.  Limit the amount of physical contact with the disc.

  Always handle the disc by the outer edge and/or the inner (hole) edge.
  Never touch the data surface.

  Discs like to "live" in the same conditions that people do; that is:
  They don't like to be manhandled
  They don't like exposure to temperature extremes
  They don't like exposure to excess humidity
  They don't like exposure to high intensity UV light

43. Which drives will work with Kodak Photo CD?

  The following drives offer full Multisession Photo CD Support:
  ----------------------------
  Apple 300, 300i (Sony CDU-8003, CDU-8003A)
  Apple PowerCD (Philips CDF080)
  Chinon CDS-535
  MDI LaserBank 600CDX
  NEC CDR-38
  NEC CDR-84-1 (CDR-74-1)
  NEC CDR 400 (MultiSpin 3xp portable)
  NEC CDR 500, CDR 510, CDR 600 (MultiSpin 3x series)
  NEC CDR 900 (MultiSpin 4x Pro quadruple speed)
  Philips/LMS CM 215
  Philips CM 4xx
  Philips CM 44x
  Sony CDU-561
  TEAC CD-50
  Texel DM-5024 (DM-3024)
  Texel DM-5028 (DM-3028)
  Toshiba XM 3401TA (XM 3401B)
  Toshiba XM 3401TE (Silicon Graphics version, Sun version)
  Toshiba XM 4101TA

  The NEC CDR-74/84 works fine with PhotoCD. Older models that have a
  firmware revision of 1.0 should be sent back to NEC for a FREE refit,
  that upgrades the firmware to 1.0a, and may update some other components.
  NEC should be called at 1-(800)-388-8888 follow the recorded messages to
  get them to sent the info required for the refit (or hit 6 then 1 to get
  there instantly).  You will get your drive back in 3-4 business days.

  The Kodak Information Center is maintaining a file on the compuserve CDROM
  forum of compatible drives, and it has become quite extensive.  They also 
  specify compatible SCSI boards, drivers, and cable configurations.  There
  are also a couple of subtle issues in compatibility that are still being
  worked out.  For example, the NEC drives are single session compatible, but
  not multi.  There are also drives which have been certified as compatible
  which are not XA, and there is some indication that this makes them useful
  for pictures alone, but not for mixed media Photo-CD productions in the
  future.
==========================================================================
44. What is a multisession CD drive?

  A CD has an "index" area which contains track details; this is what is
  read when you first stick an audio CD into a player.  Photo-CDs have a
  separate index area each time they are written (because it is impossible
  to "update" the index area). A multisession drive is one that knows to
  look for multiple index areas. The full details are contained in the
  Philips/Sony/Kodak "Orange Book" standard for writable CDs.

==========================================================================
45. How does Photo CD work?

  In a nut shell, 35mm film (negative, slide, B&W, internegative) is scanned
  by an image scanner and transfered to XA-formatted CD-ROM discs.  These
  discs are manufactured by burning (writing) -- not by pressing.

  Each scanned image on the disc is kept in five resolutions.  These five
  resolutions are called: Base/16, Base/4, Base, 4Base, and 16Base.  As
  examples, Base/16 is one sixteenth the resolution of the "Base" image, and
  16Base is sixteen times the resolution of "Base".  (These are not simply
  larger picture elements.  There are in increased number of scan lines.)

  The 4Base and 16Base images are are compressed using Huffman encoding.  You
  need the decompression software to pull the higher resolutions out of the
  image.  You would typically need these higher resolutions if you want
  enlargements or if you intend to use an HDTV as a display device.

==========================================================================
46. Where can I get some information about the Kodak Photo CD?

  To learn more about Photo CD products or other KODAK desktop color
  imaging products, contact Eastman Kodak Company at 1-800-242-2424 Ext 51

  Information about PhotoCD is available by anonymous ftp from
  ftp.cdrom.com:/cdrom/photo_cd, and from ftp.kodak.com:/pub/photo-cd.

  There is an excellent article on PhotoCD in the Sept 92 issue of
  Photographic Magazine.

  Eastman Kodak Co recently released Photo CD Access, which is designed
  to allow users to integrate CD images into any Windows or Macintosh
  Application.  Requires a CD ROM XA (Extended Architecture) drive.
  Most popular image formats are supported, including TIFF, GIF, TARGA
  and PICT.  Kodak sells the software directly.  $39.95, 1-800-242-2424.

  A developer's kit is available for $695 and includes source code as well
  as object for PC/MAC.

  --------------------

  Dick Phillip's Photo-CD application for NeXTs is now loaded in the  
  pub/next/submissions directory at sonata.cc.purdue.edu. The following  
  files are available:

  pCD0.3.4..README
  pCD0.3.4.tar.compressed         application

47. What are the lowest prices for getting my photo's put on Photo CD?

  In the U.S. you can put photos on Photo CD for $0.59 per image from
  "LazerQuick" in Beaverton, OR.  1-800-937-9196, 1-503-644-9196.

  Fedco stores (LA area) charges $14.99 to develop a 24 exp and create a
  new photo CD. To add developed negatives to an exsisting CD it's
  $0.56 each negative. Ritz Camera is slighty higher.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  In Germany:

        Photo Porst
        Falbenholzweg 1
        91126 Schwabach
        Germany

        phone: [+49](9122)793-1
        fax:   [+49](9122)793-259

        DM 16,-         for the CD
        DM  4,95        for the production

        DM  1,39        for  < 49 photos
        DM  1,29        for 50-74 photos
        DM  1,19        for  > 75 photos

  For a complete Photo CD with 100 photos this gives a price of DM 139,95
  which would be about US $ 84.

==========================================================================
47. Where can I get maps of the US on CD-ROM?

  The USGS is producing a series of cds that contain 1:100,000 scale
  digital line graph (DLG) data. Presently, only Florida is available.
  Also, 1:2,000,000 DLG cd is available for the US.  Call 1-800-USA-MAPS
  for more info.

  You can also get topo data (with AVHRR coverage) on CD-ROM for $32. This
  is DEM (30" elevation data) for the whole US.  Contact: EROS Data Center,
  Sioux Falls, SD  605-594-6507, or 6511

  The Digital Chart of the World (DCW), produced by your Defense Mapping
  Agency, is generally acknowledged to be the best data set providing
  world-wide coverage. It is at a scale of about 1:1 000 000, and it is
  unlikely that you will find data at a larger scale for much of the world.
  At $200.00 for the set of 4 CD-ROMs and viewing data, it is considered to
  be a steal by most professional users, though it might be a bit of an
  overkill for domestic use.  You can obtain it from:

    U S Geological Survey
    Distribution Center
    Building 810
    Box 25286
    Denver, CO 80225

==========================================================================
50. Can I speed up my CD-ROM by using a cache?

  There are several programs that cache information from the CD-ROM onto
  your hard disk.  Since magnetic discs are often more than 10 times faster
  than a CD-ROM, this can result in dramatic improvements under some
  circumstances.

  Most of the programs cache the directory information, so you can traverse
  subdirectories quickly.  They also cache the most recently accessed blocks
  of data.  So if you use the same files over and over, or access the same
  records in a database, your CD-ROM will seem much faster.  But when you
  access the information for the first time, it will be just as slow as
  ever.

  SpeedCache+ from Future Systems has been recommended as a pretty good
  caching program.

   Future Systems, Inc
   0420 South 500 East
   Bluffton, IN 46714
   (219) 824-4963

  ------
  On the Macintosh a prescanning (Directory, file atrributes, icons, etc)
  cache to accelerate the Mac with CD-ROMs exists from two companies
  SpeedyCD 1.22 and FWB CD-ROM ToolKit 1.0.  FWB seems much faster than
  SpeedyCD and can prescan any type of CD-ROM volumes (ProDos, Mac HFS,
  MS DOS, ISO9660, PhotoCD etc.) It prescans in the background.
==========================================================================
51. Do you have any info about the CD-ROM filesystems for Amigas?

54. How do I put a CD-ROM Drive on a Ethernet by using a unix system
    (e.g. a SUN ) as a server and PCs as clients.

  Edmund J. Sutcliffe <edmund@york.ac.uk> writes:
  If you mount an ISO format CD-ROM on you sun using the commands previously
  mentioned in Question 34 and export it to the network using 
     # exportfs /cdrom
  It is then made available for mounting using NFS to other devices.

  The PC can mount the CD-ROM using any NFS Client including Sun's PC-NFS.
  (This is the product we use) Most PC search software requires the presence
  of MSCDEX to work with the CD-ROM. Daniel Churchman of Digital Solutions
  Pty Ltd, of Queensland Australia wrote a simplistic MSCDEX faker called
  MXSUB in May 1990 which they release under GNU Public License in January '92.
  This work well with early versions of the search software.Colin Ian King
  <cik@ukc.ac.uk> wrote a small quantitiy of C code which fakes the MSCDEX
  extensions required by many PC packages. He also produced a list of which
  search software used which MSCDEX functions. This code is released under
  GNU Public license and is available from ftp.york.ac.uk in /pub/cd-rom,
  via anonymous FTP. This faker can work with an Microsoft Compatible Network
  which can see CD-ROMs.

  It is also necessary sometimes to set the volume label of the NFS mounted
  drive. "Malcolm E. Sherrington" <msherri@rpms.ac.uk> in an article in the
  proceeding of the UKUUG confernce of January '93 talks about the problems
  in doing this. He wrote a program call NFSLABEL to label PC-NFS mounted
  Network Drives. However, this code was slow to be release and Robert
  Turner <Robert.Turner@brunel.ac.uk> wrote similar code called LABELNFS
  which is available in source form. All this code is available from
  ftp.york.ac.uk in /pub/pc-nfs. This code has been sucessfully used with
  BRS/Search SilverPlatter and WilsonDisk search software.
  The only CD-ROM search software which has been made available to me for
  testing purpose, on the Macintosh is SilverPlatters SPIRS. We have a
  GatorCS/Rack running GatorShare, an Apple Filing Protocol to NFS convert.
  (For more info mail support@cayman.com) This allows the Macs to see NFS
  file store as Appleshare Volumes. To mount CD-ROM to the Mac you must do
  the following:
     1) mount the CD-ROM on a Mac using a local CD-ROM. This
      will give you the Volume Name of the CD-ROM as seen to the Mac. 
     2) mount the CD-ROM on the NFS server.
     3) Using GatorKeeper, the management software for GatorShare create a
      new  AppleShare Volume called the same name as the volume when the
      CD-ROM was mounted locally. 
       This volume should mount the CD-ROM exported from the NFS server but the
     DESKTOP file should be create on some other section of NFS disk as it
     cannot be created on the CD-ROM. GatorKeeper will confirm the volume
     creation and then uses can mount the Volumes using the Chooser as usual.
  The user community can now mount the CD-ROM over the network to their Mac
  just like any other network volume and the SPIRS search software can us it.
  It is possible to Automate this mount and search software to make it
  transparent to the user and so limit usuage.

     It should be noted that it is important to license approriately copies
  of the CD-ROMs before exporting them generally over the network. You might
  also want to restrict access to appropriate netgroups. Also license
  locking the search software satisfies certain companies, but not all.

==========================================================================
54. How do I read the UPC (universal product code?) from a CDROM?

  The precense of the UPC on a CD is optional, although all the audio
  CDs have one. CDROMs might not have a UPC, however.

  There's an MSCDEX function to get the UPC (int 2F, AX=0x1510,
  CX=<CDROM drive letter>, ES:BX=<Addr Request Header> with the
  request header filled with the IOCTL INPUT command 14 (get UPC)).
  The MSCDEX documentation (chapters 10 and 11) will give you more
  information.

  I hope the above is of use to you. I have been working on this problem
  for 18 months on and off and finally I have got round to documenting it as

  please feel free as we only have limited Internet access. New updates
  appear about every 2 or 3 months.

57. Is there any *FREE* CD-ROM mastering software, with full source code?

  Eric Youngdale has written a Gnu-ware ISO-9660+Rockridge formatter.
  It has been tested on both Linux and SunOS 4.1.3.  You can ftp it
  from ftp.cdrom.com:/pub/cdrom/mkisofs-1.00.tar.gz. 

  It is also on the Yggdrasil Linux CDROM, which sells for $49.  You can
  call Yggdrasil at +1 (510) 526-7531.
