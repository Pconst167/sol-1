Version: 3.33

This is a summary of how to find email addresses for undergraduate and
graduate students, faculty and staff at various colleges and universities. If
your university is not listed, send me a detailed description of how to find
email addresses there, in a format similar to what I have here, and I'll add
it to this list. Please mail ADDITIONS, CORRECTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, and OTHER
INFORMATION to me at
	dalamb@qucis.queensu.ca.
I will *not* answer requests for help finding a specific address; if the
school is not listed in this posting, I do not have any information about the
site.

An updated version of this list is posted every once in a while to the
newsgroups soc.college, soc.net-people and news.answers.  The version date for
this list is located at the top of the file. The list is also available via
anonymous ftp from ftp.qucis.queensu.ca in directory pub/dalamb/college-email
as the files faq1.text, faq2.text, and faq3.text.  You can also get the file
by anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the file
/pub/usenet/soc.college/Student_Email_Addresses, or by sending a mail message
to "archive-server@qucis.queensu.ca" with the subject
	send dalamb/college-email
or by sending a message to "mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu" whose body contains
	send usenet/soc.college/Student_Email_Addresses

After a discussion of general facilities for locating email addresses,
we present detailed information on locating the email addresses of
students, faculty and staff at various universities.  As of Feb 1993 I've
started to tag entries with the date I last changed them, so you have some
clue as to how stale the information might be.

Disclaimer: Most universities have restrictions on the uses of
directory information. So don't use this info for commercial purposes
or whatnot without securing permission from the individual colleges
and universities.

*************************************************************************
*			SPECIAL NOTE:					*
*         Avoid public distribution of individuals' addresses		*
*************************************************************************

It is considered rude to widely distribute (e.g., in a Usenet posting)
anyone's E-mail address without prior consent, even if the address is publicly
available using one of the techniques described below or some other technique.

It might seem that having one's E-mail address listed in a publicly accessible
database is equivalent to distributing it, but this is not the case in
practice, for three primary reasons:

* Some people may not be aware that their addresses are available for others
  to locate.  For example, the majority of Usenet posters are unaware of the
  database of Usenet E-mail mentioned in the "finding addresses" FAQ.

* When some effort is required to locate a person's address (e.g., using the
  techniques described below), only people who have a specific reason to send
  mail will go to the trouble.  However, if the address is mentioned in a
  Usenet posting read by thousands of people, no effort is required to obtain
  it, and many more people will send mail.  Most people with E-mail addresses
  are not accustomed to receiving E-mail from strangers or large amounts of
  E-mail, and they may not be happy if they do.

* As unwanted E-mail becomes more common, people will start to remove their
  addresses from public databases, which means that it will become more
  difficult to find people's addresses for legitimate reasons.

In summary, if you want to advertise someone's E-mail address, get his or her
permission before you do it.  Besides, if you're going to advertise an
address, it's a good idea to make sure it works first, and writing to it for
permission is a good way to do that.

;;; ********************************
;;; General Facilities *************
;;; ********************************

There are several general facilities for locating an email address.
We concentrate on those usable from the internet.

o  finger					Changed: Thu Jul  1 1993

   Finger is a user information lookup program that lists the login name,
   full name, office location and phone number (if known), login time,
   idle time, time mail was last read, and the contents of the .plan and
   .project files from the home directory of current UNIX users. The 
   information listed varies from site to site, and not all sites allow 
   remote fingering. [Plan files are "sys$login:plan" on VMS systems.]

   To use finger, simply call finger as follows
	finger <username>@<machinename>
   replacing <machinename> with the name of the appropriate machine, and
   <username> with the name of the person or the person's login ID.
   For example,
	
	% finger mkant@cs.cmu.edu
	[CS.CMU.EDU]

	[ Forwarding mkant as "mkant+@a.gp.cs.cmu.edu" ]

	[A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU]
	Login name: mkant                       In real life: Mark Kantrowitz
	Directory: /usr2/mkant                  Shell: /usr/cs/bin/csh
	Last login Tue Apr  2 15:21 on ttyQ7 from LION.OZ.CS.CMU.EDU
	No new mail, last read on Thu Apr 11 16:27

   Notice how fingering my userid at the generic address forwarded the
   request to the correct machine. Many universities are set up to do
   forwarding in this manner, so that mail may be sent to the generic
   address and is automatically forwarded to the maildrop on the machine
   where the user receives his or her mail.

   Fingering using last names or full names may work, depending on the
   site:
	% finger Mark.Kantrowitz@cs.cmu.edu
	[CS.CMU.EDU]
	[ Forwarding Mark.Kantrowitz as "mkant+@a.gp.cs.cmu.edu" ]

	% finger kantrowitz@cs.cmu.edu
	[CS.CMU.EDU]
	[ Forwarding kantrowitz as "mkant+@a.gp.cs.cmu.edu" ]
   Some sites with use an underscore (_) instead of a period (.) in the
   full name (e.g., Mark_Kantrowitz), or require an extra period to
   specify middle initials (Mark.X.Kantrowitz).

   If fingering using the last name doesn't work, you can try sampling
   various possibilities for userids. The following are some
   possibilities. After the description of each possibility, I give
   an example in square brackets with either the previous maintainer's name
   (Mark Kantrowitz, no middle initial - his was longer than mine!) or "John C
   Smith", and a generic acronym for the method, with f's for characters from
   the firstname, m for the middle initial, and l's for characters from the
   lastname; these acronyms will be used in the detailed listings section of
   this file.
	-  Many UNIX sites limit userids to 8 characters, so try the
           first 8 characters of the last name. [smith or kantrowi] llllllll
	-  If there are two people with the same last name, the first
           initial (and possibly the middle initial as well) are appended
	   at the front of the name. [jsmith or jcsmith] flllllll fmllllll
	-  Try appending the initials at the end of the name. [smithj
 	   or smithjc] lllllllf llllllfm
	-  Try the initials of the users name. [jcs] fml
   Unfortunately, you cannot finger to bitnet addresses (unless they are also
   on the internet).

o  whois/nicname				Changed: Tue Jun 29 1993
   
   Whois is the internet user name directory service. Do 
	whois help
   or
	nicname -h
   to get a help message. The whois and nicname programs will check
   the database maintained at rs.internic.net (or nic.ddn.mil for U.S.
   military sites) for the given names. For example,
	nicname <name>
   or
	whois <name>
   or
	whois -h <host> <names>
   where <host> is some site with a whois server.  This is only useful for
   people listed in the database. Many regional networks and some universities
   maintain their own NICs.

   You can also get some of this information by telneting to rs.internic.net
   and running whois and host there.

o  Merit Network NetMail database
 
   Allows one to find the appropriate bitnet, internet or uucp address
   for a site given part of the address.
	telnet hermes.merit.edu
	At the "Which Host?" prompt, type netmailsites
	then enter any part of the address you want.

o  nslook/nslookup and hostq programs
   
   Some sites have programs which will give you information about a host
   given its name or IP address. Some such programs include nslook,
   nslookup, and hostq.

o  Netfind

   Use a netfind client or server program to search for
	name domain
   where name is the last name of the individual and domain is the
   domain name. You can use Netfind by telnet/rlogin to
   bruno.cs.colorado.edu (use userid "netfind" with no password).

o  gopher					Changed: Wed Mar 24 1993

   Gopher is an Internet-wide distributed document retrieval service.  If your
   site has a gopher client program, you can use it to access gopher servers
   at other sites; domain X.edu might have a gopher server gopher.X.edu, but
   there's no guarantee.  One kind of document sites often place under gopher
   is their phonebook.  Most Gopher servers have pointers to a complete list
   of ph servers used by all sorts of organizations.  You can enter various
   criteria, in an easy-to-use manner, and it will return the info that you
   didn't give (if, of course, there are no more than 20 entries that match.
   This is to prevent people getting mailing lists via the ph servers.)

o  help/gripe/olc

   If your site has consultants or facilities staff responsible for helping
   users/fixing bugs/maintaining software, try sending them mail. Often
   they will be able to help you. If you don't know how to contact these
   people, ask someone in your department, or try sending mail to the
   userid 'help'.

o  postmaster					Changed: Thu Jul  1 1993

   Most sites have an individual responsible for network and mail operations
   at the site, usually with the userid of 'postmaster'.  These people are
   usually very busy, so before bothering one of them, try telephoning the
   person you are trying to reach.  Long distance is expensive for you, but
   less expensive, globally, than the postmaster's time.  The one reasonable
   exception is if you're sending mail and getting messages in response that
   suggest some sort of mail system problem; you might report the problem
   to postmaster at your own site, who may in turn contact postmaster at the
   destination site.

   Many postmasters will refuse to answer questions about user identification,
   for reasons of privacy, though they may be willing to forward *your*
   address so your intended recipient can write to you.

o  /etc/hosts					Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993

   Mail routing on UNIX machines on the internet use to use a large file
   called /etc/hosts to validate host names.  We used to advise you to examine
   this file to guess host names when all else fails - but that really isn't
   useful anymore.  Use one of the above methods instead.

o  LISTSERV

   If the person is subscribed to a mailing list through a LISTSERV server,
   sending mail to the server with the line
	WHOIS <name>
   may catch the person. For example, listserv@buacca.bu.edu. This is an
   unlikely option. It also does not work with all listserv implementations.

o  Internet to America Online

   Creating the Internet version of an America Online address requires that
   you know the conversion rule. You ignore the case, remove the spaces, and
   add "@aol.com" to the end of the address.  Thus, an America Online address
   "Jane Doe" becomes "janedoe@aol.com" (without the quotes, of course).
   Internet mail incoming to America Online is trucated at 27 kilobytes.

o  Internet to Prodigy				Created: Mon Sep  6 1993

   Around July 1993 there were rumours that Prodigy was beta-testing an
   Internet gateway. We don't know if there would be any cost to Prodigy
   users, but they need new software, called Mail Manager, and can sign up for
   Internet access at JUMP INTERNET. Prodigy users would receive Internet mail
   via the address format 
	abcd12a@prodigy.com
    where "abcd12a" is the recipient's Prodigy user ID.


;;; ********************************
;;; Miscellaneous Notes ************
;;; ********************************

Addresses on the United Kingdon academic network (JANET) have their components
reversed. For example, @uk.ac.dund.mcs works on JANET, but in the rest of the
world use @mcs.dund.ac.uk instead.

;;; ********************************
;;; Email Database *****************
;;; ********************************

Abo Akademi University (Turku, Finland):	Created: Mon Sep  6 1993
	Host: finabo.abo.fi.  Finger available.

Alfred University				Created: Mon Sep  6 1993
	(New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred)
	Internet: bigvax.alfred.edu
	Bitnet:   ALFREDU or CERAMICS
	Almost all students and faculty have email adresses in the form
	lastnamefm, but exceptions abound.  Connecting via telnet to
	bigvax.alfred.edu and logging on as GENERAL will connect to the
	GENERAL account, which supports username searches. Outside finger is
	not supported.

Amherst College:
	Students, Faculty, Staff: userid@amherst.edu	
	Usernames are of the form fmllllll (e.g., jqstudent), but
	truncated to 12 letters instead of 8.

	Amherst.edu has a finger daemon running, but it requires an exact
	username match (i.e. finger lastname@amherst.edu) doesn't work, as a
	rule.  It's also worth trying usernames like flllllll in case the
	person in question didn't register their middle initial with the
	College.


Antioch College (Yellow Springs, OH):

	Flastname@Antioc.Antioch.Edu

	All students, faculty, administrators, staff, and alum who request
	accounts can get them.  Almost all follow First Initial lastname
	setup.  Offices, such as ADMISSIONS, COOP etc have alias accounts.
	Best bet is to send mail to Postmaster or Laslow.

Arizona State University:			Changed: Mon Sep  6 1993
	Finger firstname.lastname@asu.edu;  all persons (students or staff)
	registered in ASU can be "finger"ed.  Email addresses are unreliable
	though since not everyone has started using accounts yet. But most
	grads and computer/usenet literate undergrads do.

	The engineering grads/ugrads are on enuxsa.eas.asu.edu.  Most other
	machine info should be available from netfind's seed database search.

Arizona State University:
	Academic Machines: Grad, Undergrad
	The phone book for ASU's Faculty/Students is available online
	by telnetting (using the IBM's fullscreen interface using
	tn3270) to asuvm.inre.asu.edu and logging on as HELLOASU. The
	phone book has both email addresses for academic machines as
	well as the phone nos. (602 is the area code for all of Arizona)

	Engineering machines: Grad, Undergrad
	enuxha.eas.asu.edu   -- Unix -- can finger first/last names or userids
	enuxva.eas.asu.edu   -- Unix -- same as above 
	envmsa.eas.asu.edu   -- VMS  -- Only userid fingering works. 

	Usually csc and eee undergrads who use comps get accts on
	enuxha and almost all grads have accts on enuxha which is the
	most popular machine due to USENET. 

Auburn University: (Auburn, AL)
	Engineering: eng.auburn.edu
	Other departments: ducvax.auburn.edu
	Try fingering at waterman.eng.auburn.edu, lab1.eng.auburn.edu,
	newton.eng.auburn.edu or netman.eng.auburn.edu.

Augustana College (Sioux Falls, SD)			Created: Fri Oct  8 1993
	user@inst.augie.edu
	Student usernames are fmlastname
	Faculty usernames are lastname

Australian Defence Force Academy (Canberra, Australia) Created: Thu Jul  1 1993
	Faculty and staff: F.Lastname@ADFA.oz.au

Australian National University (ANU):		Created: Mon Mar 22 1993
	Canberra, Australia (Domain: anu.edu.au)
	netfind:  rlogin anu.anu.edu.au -l netfind
	Academic Machines:
	  Grad, Staff userids fml### where ### is a group identifier.
	    huxley.anu.edu.au  -- Unix -- finger on usernames only
	    coombs.anu.edu.au  -- Unix -- GNU finger, allows first/last names
	  Undergrad: userds lllfxxxx, where xxxx is course name/unit number.
	    e.g. stuaca11 is A.Student doing Computer Science unit A11.
	    fac3.anu.edu.au    -- Unix -- finger on usernames only
	    fac4.anu.edu.au    -- Unix -- finger on usernames only
	Computer Science:
	  boris.anu.edu.au   -- Unix -- finger on usernames only

Ball State University:
	University Computing Services: username@bsuvax1.bitnet
	Some faculty and grad students have accounts on this machine.
	CS: username@bsu-cs.bsu.edu

Barnard:					Changed: Mon Sep  6 1993
	Barnard College, affiliated with Columbia.
	Students and staff get free accounts on a PC-based system running
	  cc:mail (no finger, gopher, etc.)  There is no known way of looking
	  up addresses.  They can also request accounts on Columbia's systems.
	Students: LLLLLFFM@@barnard.columbia.edu (or
	    @smtplink.barnard.columbia.edu)
	As of October 1993, Columbia will list Barnard directory information,
	so mail to firstname.lastname@columbia.edu will probably reach Barnard
	recipients.

Bates College (Lewiston, Maine):
 	Students and Faculty: userid@abacus.bates.edu
	Userids are of the form flllllll.  Numbers are added to the end
	of the userid in case of name conflicts, e.g. asmith, asmith2, asmith3
	If the name is unique you can use firstname.lastname@bates.edu

Baylor College of Medicine:

	The central mail server is bcm.tmc.edu and finger user@bcm.tmc.edu will
	get you any faculty or staff user that makes use of the central mail 
	facility. finger user@express.bcm.tmc.edu will get you any student that
	makes use of the student email facility.

	whois -h whois.bcm.tmc.edu gets you the on-line phone/address book.
	This is directly tied to the BCM personnel database, so the information
	is as accurate as possible.

	Questions about these facilities should be directed to
	postmaster@bcm.tmc.edu

Baylor University (Waco, TX):			Changed: Mon Sep  6 1993
	Computer Science and Engineering students: userid@bilbo.baylor.edu
	Computer Science: gandalf.baylor.edu
	Work-study students and journalism staff: baylor.edu

Bethune-Cookman College (Daytona Beach, FL):	Created: Mon Sep  6 1993
	Faculty, staff, students: username@cookman.edu
	To learn a particular email name at the college, it is best to send to: 
	postmaster@cookman.edu

Birmingham-Southern College (Birmingham, AL):
	bsc835!userid@uunet.uu.net where userid are of the form
	flllllll. Postmaster is bsc835!jbaxter@uunet.uu.net.

Boston Univ.:					Changed: Tue Jan  4 1994
	Main campus system: acs.bu.edu.  Everyone can get accounts on this
	machine, but not everyone does. Call the person and ask (they may
	never log on even if they have an account). Student Directory
	617-353-3700, Faculty 617-353-2000.  Usernames are any "socially
	acceptable" 8-character name.
        Unix accounts: Mail or finger user@bu.edu or first.last@bu.edu.
	There is a ph name server at bu.edu; replace spaces in names with
	dashes.

        CS: cs.bu.edu
	Undergrad CS: csa.bu.edu.
	Engineering: buenga.bu.edu (faculty/admin)

Bowdoin:					Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	Studnets: fl*@polar.bowdoin.edu, where f is the first initial, l* is
	  the lastname up to 7 characters.
	Administrative staff: @henry.bowdoin.edu.  Mailboxes are fl* as above,
	  or last_first
	Faculty: either of the above depending on personal preference.

Bradley University:
	Faculty: bradley.bradley.edu
	Students: buhub.bradley.edu, camelot.bradley.edu.  Usernames are
	  chosen by the user and may be from three to eight characters long. 
	Heartland Freenet: heartland.bradley.edu  Free use to the public, used
	  mostly by the Peoria public. Use login 'bbguest'. login names are
	  usually flllllll or fmllllll.
	Chemistry: chem1.bradley.edu
	CS: bucs1.bradley.edu, cssun1, cssun2
	Physics: truth.bradley.edu
	Physics: beauty.bradley.edu

Brandeis:
	Undergraduates: pip.cc.brandeis.edu
		Usernames on pip are of the form STXXYYYY where XX is
		the year the student entered Brandeis and YYYY is the
		student's campus mailbox number. Not all students use
		their accounts, so check with the student before emailing.
		US mail can be sent to 
			<Student Name>
			MB <YYYY>, Brandeis University
			PO Box 9110
			Waltham, MA 02254-9110

	For phone information: On-campus students can be reached by dialing an
	automated "spell-the-name" server at +1 617 736 3000 , 24 hours a day,
	or during business hours through the Brandeis operator at +1 617 736
	2000.  Off-campus students' numbers can be obtained through the campus
	information booth at +1 617 736 4770 during business hours.

	Some undergrads have accounts on a more advanced unix machine,
	chaos.cs.brandeis.edu.  Userids are chosen by the student; finger
	{lastname}@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu or mail to
	postmaster@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu for info.

	Graduate Students: binah.cc.brandeis.edu (brandeis.bitnet).
	Not all use them; write to postmaster@binah.cc.brandeis.edu
	for information. Userid is chosen by the student.  A few
	undergrads have binah accounts.  

	DIRECTIONS to Brandeis can be had 24 hours at +1 617 736 4660.

Bridgewater State College (Bridgewater, MA)	Created: Wed Mar 24 1993
	Host: bsc.mass.edu

Brown:
        You can send mail to Firstname_Lastname@Brown.Edu if the user
  	uses email and it will forward the mail to him or her. To find
	out whether the user has an email address, finger their name
	at brown.edu. This will return their preferred phone number,
	address, and email address if they use it.
        
	You can also try looking for undergrads on: brownvm.brown.edu
	(brownvm.bitnet) Username is some random alphanumerics.	
	CS: cs.brown.edu (userids are usually initials)

Bryn Mawr College:
	F_LLLLLLLLLL@cc.brynmawr.edu (F_LLLLLLLLLL@BRYNMAWR.BITNET)
	The former is fingerable, unlike the .bitnet address. This
	machine is mostly used by undergrads.

Bucknell University:
	general: username@bucknell.edu
	cs: username@pollux.bucknell.edu
	usernames are typically last names, but if the last name is
	4 letters or shorter, the first and middle initials are
	tacked onto the front.

	First initials are frequently used in usernames.  The
	first user with any given last name who gets an account gets just
	his last name as the username.  Every subsequent person with that name
	gets a first initial and then middle initials are used.

	Example:
			username	person
			--------	------
			murray		Betty Murray, switchboard operator
			dmurray		David Murray, senior
			jmurray		Jeff Murray, senior
			jemurray	Jonathan Murray, freshman


California Inst. of Tech:			Changed: Thu Jul  1 1993
	CCO MACHINES (undergrad/grad/general) CCO means campus computing org.
	  Unix: mail to username@cco.caltech.edu
	  VMS: Juliet.caltech.edu.  Also romeo,hamlet,iago,portia.
	    These are all the same vax cluster. 
	Try "whois -h finger.caltech.edu name" to find user names, or telnet
	  to info.caltech.edu
	Undergrad Computer Science (also used by a lot of people who don't fit
	  this discription. a fairly well used cluster. HP Bobcats running
	  Unix).  through.ugcs.caltech.edu (aka through.caltech.edu) is the
	  server.  Also, with the same endings: within, above, from, toward,
	  around, beyond, over, betwixt, inside, near, besides, beneath,
	  opposite, behind, amongst, atop, astride, against.....,
	  vex,heckle,irk,harry,grate,bullyrag,plague,torment, molest, and
	  badger (the irc server).
	CS department (grad/undergrad/fac...not that well used).
	  csvax.cs.caltech.edu (runs unix).

California Polytechnic State Univ./San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly, SLO):
	polyslo.CalPoly.edu

California State University/Chico: 	csuchico.edu
California State University/Sacramento: csus.edu

Calvin College: calvin.edu
	Use 'finger name@calvin.edu' (eg firstname or lastname) to find
	  addresses, since userids include parts of student numbers, so are
	  hard to guess.
	Students:  flllllnn (first intitial, first 5 of last name,
	  last 2 digits of student number; except lastnames starting with
	  Dutch prefixes Van Vander Vande etc., where just the v and first 4
	  letters of second part of lastname.  Thus Henk Vander Bos, #123456,
	  becomes hvbos56, Al Shoemaker, #987654, becomes ashoem54)
	(formerly s0###### where ###### is the student id number)
	Faculty/staff:	xxxx@calvin.edu where "xxxx" is the standard
                        faculty abbrevation, often lastname

Cambridge University (Cambridge, England):	Created: Sat Mar 27 1993
	Telnet to info.cam.ac.uk and log in as "info"; you then get an online
	  information system about Cambridge, which according to rumour can
	  help you find people (though I got lost in a maze of twisty
	  hypertext when I tried it).

Carnegie Mellon University:			Changed: Mon Aug 23 1993

Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland:	Changed: Wed Mar 24 1993
	Use 'whois -h whois.cwru.edu' to find usernames.  It supports
	  substring and soundex searches.  If there is a * beside an address,
	  it has not been activated.
	po.cwru.edu is the post office. Every student, professor, and staff
	  member has access to email through this machine, as do alumni who
	  activated their accounts while students. (Not everybody activates
	  their account, however.) User ids are of the form fml##, where ## is
	  a number, probably less than 30. The number is omitted if equal to
	  1. If there's no middle initial, m is an 'x'.
	skybridge.scl.cwru.edu is the server for the undergraduate Unix lab.
	  The user ids on that machine are the full last name, for the most
	  part. (Mainly Computer Engineering and EE's on this machine.)
	You can also search the Cleveland Freenet user list for CWRU people
	  by any part of the name; telnet to freenet-in-a.cwru.edu, choose
	  "Visitor", "Explore the system" and at the prompt, "go directory"
	CS/computer engineering majors may have accounts on the CS cluster;
	  finger any part of the name @alpha.ces.cwru.edu.  Userids are
	  usually full last name.
	EE majors and those in related courses may have accounts on the EE
	  HP/UX cluster; finger @snowhite.eeap.cwru.edu.  Userids are usually
	  the first six letters of the last name.

Catholic University of America
	username@cua.edu (Internet)

Kansas State Univ.:				Changed: Mon Feb 15 1993
	VM/XA: ksuvm.ksu.edu.  All students, faculty, and staff.  This is by
	  far the most popular machine.
	KSUVM has a homebrewed finger server that allows you to search
	  for KSU students, faculty, and staff.  Usage is 
		"finger	lastname,firstname@ksuvm.ksu.edu"
	  This does a fuzzy lookup so you don't have to get the spelling exact
	  and returns the KSUVM userid (if any) plus name, address, phone
	  number, major (if student), and classification.  If you know the
	  KSUVM userid you can look that up with
		"finger userid-xxx@ksuvm.ksu.edu"
	  (where "xxx" is the userid you want to find). 
	Unix:
	  matt.ksu.ksu.edu      All students, faculty, and staff.

	address. This is the same info that's used to create the
	MIT phonebook, so it is as accurate. (One can finger
	help@mit.edu for instructions in using this service.)

	All students and faculty may get an account from Project
	Athena. Their mail address will be @athena.mit.edu, even
	though athena is a distributed workstation environment.

	       and also serves as the domain name server for memst.edu
	       While it does support Finger, it only reports users
	       currently logged on.
	   All instructional account usernames are dependent on the
	       course title  (e.g. MATH1234567 would be an account
	       for a Math class)
	   Grads and Staff accounts are usually First_InitialLastname
	       e.g. JSMITH for John Smith (but there are exceptions)

	Some departments have their own machines, but the majority of
	accounts are on the VAX.

Merrimack College: (inquiries to postmaster@merrimack.edu welcome)
	Faculty: except in extraordinary circumstances lastname@merrimack.edu
	Undergrads: Aliases exist for most students as

        nothing is used.  In case of name conflicts, numbers are added to 
        the end to produce unique userid's.

Michigan State Univ.:

	@cpsin.cps.msu.edu @cpsvax.cps.msu.edu  
	All college of Engineering students and faculty (includes CPS
	students) that have requested an account will have the address:
		user@egr.msu.edu (user@msuegr.bitnet)
	where "user" is usually the last name, but is often some other
	combination of first name, initials, etc to provide uniqueness
	throughout the college.

	In Addition, CPS students and faculty can receive mail at
		user@cps.msu.edu
	with the rules for "user" being the same as above.  As far as I know,
	the same user-id is used on both "egr.msu.edu" and "cps.msu.edu".

	General EMAIL accounts are available on Computer Center machines,
	usually the IBM3090.
	   user@ibm.cl.msu.edu user@msu.bitnet
	and also the Convex
	   user@convex.cl.msu.edu
	I don't know what the rules are for determining user IDs for Computer
