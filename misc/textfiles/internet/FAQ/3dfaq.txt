This document provides a partial--and not comprehensive--list 
of 3D graphics accelerators for PCs. In particular, I am interested 
in PCI-based accelerators. You can help make it more comprehensive 
by sending me additional information and/or updates. This information 
is abstracted and condensed from the posts of many different contributors. 
No guarantees are made regarding its accuracy. 

The original motivation for this document came from a list of accelerators 
compiled by Chris Hinch, Management Information Systems, Dunedin

Introduction


The original motivation for compiling this list was to compare 
the features of various 3D graphics accelerators becoming available 
for microcomputers. In particular, I am interested in PCI-based 
cards which support OpenGL under Windows NT, Linux, Solaris x86 
(none yet!), etc. and support stereo head mounted displays. 
(In fact, of the currently available boards, only one qualifies. 
See if you can figure out which one.) 

Information which falls in that category will obviously be more 
complete. Other information will be included if someone sends it 
to me, but I won't be actively researching it myself. As such, 
there is little or no information right now about 3D accelerators 
for high-end machines such as those produced by SGI, Sun, HP,
DEC, etc, except as the ones listed may also work in those machines. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disclaimer


I haven't seen or used many of these cards, and all figures are the 
manufacturers own, as near as I can verify. I am not promoting 
any one card or company over any other. Any anecdotes, speed 
comparisons, etc., that I collect will be included on a purely 
informational level. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. Of course, I will 
not include anything I do not believe or know to be false. 

No representation is made as to the accuracy of these figures/technical 
specs. If you are going to buy/bet the farm/otherwise invest 
in one of these products, CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER first and 
make sure that what you want is what you'll get!!! 

CAVEAT EMPTOR!!! 

All trademarks etc are copyright of their respective owners etc. 
etc. 

Furthermore, many of these boards are not yet available, so you 
should find out delivery dates before getting your heart set on 
any given one.

Section I: Frequently Asked Questions

[[*]return to index] 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q01) Are there any 3D graphics accelerators for PCs?


I'm glad you asked. There are quite a few, with more coming out 
all the time. See the rest of this document for more information. 


(Ok, it's a stupid question, but I needed something in the FAQ section) 


Q02) How does the performance of these cards compare to graphics 
workstations such as those produced by SGI, Sun, DEC, etc?


This question is difficult to answer because there are so many factors 
affecting the overall 3D performance on a PC. Most importantly, 
while many of the boards listed below have impressive numbers in 
terms of maximum number of polygons/second, most only accelerate 
rendering. What this means is that you are still bounded by the speed 
at which your processor can transform a 3D data stream to a 2D perspective 
with lighting and material effects and then ship these numbers over 
the bus to the graphics card. So, the processor, processor speed,
bus type and speed, software design, etc., all effect the final throughput. 
Thus, a board may perform differently on two different machines that 
have the same "specs" (ie. 90Mhz Pentium, PCI bus) if the bus was 
designed differently, or if there are other cards on the bus taking 
up bandwidth. 

What is really needed is a set of comprehensive benchmarks that give 
some more realistic numbers about the various combinations of hardware. 
The NCGA (National Computer Graphics Association) GPC (Graphics Performance 
Committee) (comprised of the major vendors along with UNC and SDSC) 
is an organization primarily concerned with developing benchmark 
standards and performance characterizations for graphics hardware. 


Check out
[*]http://sunsite.unc.edu/gpc/gpc.html
for information about the GPC activities. 

Unfortunately, the GPC Quarterly is about US$200/year, which is beyond 
my budget. Thus, to get their benchmark results, you'll have to 
talk to them. However, the benchmarking tool they use to measure 
OpenGL performance, called Viewperf, is available for free. From 
the README that comes with Viewperf:

What is this Thing Called 'Viewperf'
-----------------------------------
Rob Putney, OPC Vice Chairman
4/21/95

Viewperf is a portable OpenGL performance benchmark program 
written in C. It was developed by IBM. Viewperf provides a vast amount of 
flexibility in benchmarking OpenGL performance. At the current time, 
the program runs on most implementations of UNIX, Windows NT, and OS/2.
The OpenGL Performance Characterization (OPC) Committee has endorsed 
Viewperf as its first OpenGL benchmark and results 
were first published using it in 4Q94 version of The GPC Quarterly.

OPC member companies have ported the Viewperf code to their operating
system and window environments. The OPC Committee maintains a single
source code version of the Viewperf code that is available to the 
public.


-=- [PREFORMATTED] =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


In future versions of this FAQ, performance measurements will be 
added in another section at the end. Stay tuned. If you have any 
measurements using Viewperf, please send them to me ([*]bm@cs.columbia.edu) 


Viewperf can currently be obtained from 
[*]ftp://net1.uspro.fairfax.va.us/pub/gpc/opc/viewperf/
If that directory does not work, try looking on the OpenGL home page 
at
[*]http://www.sgi.com/Technology/openGL/opengl.html which should 
contain a pointer to ViewPerf. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section II: 3D Chipsets available now or in the near future.

There are numerous 3D chipsets being worked on, but these 2 happen 
to be the ones I have detailed information both on the chips and 
on boards built using them. If I get more information on other chips,
I will include them here.

CS01) 3DLabs GLINT 300SX


First, a comment about the GLINT 300SX chip, which I will make because 
it was not clear to me when I first read their specs. They mention 
texture mapping acceleration, but on the 300SX texture maps are held 
in host memory and per pixel information is sent to the chip which 
performs the necessary interpolations and applications. For the upcoming 
300TX, the texture maps are held in local memory on the graphics 
card (the "localbuffer") and the host just sends per vertex information 
to the chip which performs all the texture mapping calculations. 


Information on the 300SX can be obtained from the 3DLabs home page 
at 
[*]http://www.3Dlabs.com/3Dlabs/ or by sending email to [*]info@3Dlabs.com. 


The technical specs below were copied directly from the page [*]http://www.3Dlabs.com/3Dlabs/300SXinf.html 


GLINT 300SX Overview


The GLINT 300SX high performance graphics processor combines workstation 
class 3D graphics acceleration and state-of-the-art 2D performance 
in a single chip. 

GLINT is capable of processing 300,000 shaded, depth buffered and 
anti-aliased polygons/second. The chip provides complete 32-bit color,
2D and 3D acceleration, an on-chip PCI-compliant local bus interface 
and integrated LUT-DAC control, making a complete graphics subsystem 
possible with minimal chip count. 

All the rendering operations of OpenGL are accelerated by the GLINT 
300SX, including Gouraud shading, depth buffering, anti-aliasing,
alpha blending, and texture mapping. 


3D ACCELERATION 
ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿ100% OpenGL compliant rendering operations in hardware 
ÿÿÿPoint, line, rectangle and polygon primitives 
ÿÿÿGouraud shading, depth buffering, anti-aliasing, dithering, depth 
ÿÿÿcueing, texture map filtering and alpha blending 
ÿÿÿ2.5 Giga operations per second 
ÿÿÿ300K Gouraud shaded, depth buffered triangles/sec 


2D AND GUI ACCELERATION 
ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿTrue color acceleration of window systems such as Win32 and X11 
ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿAccelerated bitBLT, line drawing, fills, text and window clipping 
ÿÿÿ

SPECIAL FEATURES 
ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿ64-bit hyper-pipelined architecture 
ÿÿÿVertex level interface 
ÿÿÿ112-bit pixel datapath to memory 
ÿÿÿHigh quality 16 and 8-bpp dithering of 24-bit graphics images

ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿResolutions up to 2560x2048 
ÿÿÿ8, 16 or 32-bits per pixel RGBA and 4 or 8-bit color indexed 
ÿÿÿPacked 8, 16 and 32-bit pixels 
ÿÿÿSupports advanced modes: double buffering, stereo and overlays 
ÿÿÿ

GLINT 300SX Graphics Architecture


The GLINT 300SX delivers 3D and GUI rendering functionality to improve 
the performance and quality of graphics applications and APIs.

ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿGouraud shading 
ÿÿÿDepth buffering 
ÿÿÿAnti-aliasing 
ÿÿÿDithering 
ÿÿÿDepth cueing and fog 
ÿÿÿTexture mapping 
ÿÿÿScissor and stipple masking 
ÿÿÿAlpha blending 
ÿÿÿLogical Operations (e.g. XOR) 


The unique hyper-pipelined architecture and 112-bit memory datapath 
ensure that multiple rendering operations can be combined with no 
performance penalty - allowing a Gouraud shaded polygon to be processed 
just as fast when depth buffering, dithering and anti-aliasing are 
enabled. 

FRAMEBUFFER CONTROLLER 

The 64/32-bit framebuffer controller directly interfaces to VRAM 
or DRAM framebuffers and supports a wide range of pixel depths, resolutions 
and memory sizes - enabling systems to be tuned to meet specific 
price/performance targets. 
ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿ1-32 MBytes VRAM or DRAM 
ÿÿÿ8,16 or 32-bit RGBA color 
ÿÿÿ4 or 8-bit color indexed 
ÿÿÿ2, 4, 8 pixels per 64-bit word 
ÿÿÿ640x480 to 2560x2048 
ÿÿÿVRAM arbitrary shape block fill 
ÿÿÿVRAM bit masking 
ÿÿÿFramebuffer bypass mode 


LOCALBUFFER CONTROLLER 

The localbuffer holds optional off-screen information for each pixel 
including; depth (Z) values, stencil data, arbitrary window clip 
planes, plus a control field for fast window clearing. The format 
for each field is user defined, up to a maximum of 48 bits. 
ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿ0-48 MBytes DRAM 
ÿÿÿ0-48-bits wide
Depth: 0, 16, 24, 32-bit
Stencil: 0, 4, 8-bit
Window clipping: 0, 4-bit
Fast depth clear: 4, 8-bit 
ÿÿÿLocalbuffer bypass mode 


INTEGRATED VIDEO TIMING 

An internal timing generator and VRAM transfer controller are incorporated 
into the GLINT 300SX processor. Advanced systems requiring overlays,
stereo, interlace or very large framebuffers can be supported using 
an external timing generator. 

SHARED FRAMEBUFFER 

The GLINT 300SX's on-chip shared framebuffer interface is a fully 
integrated implementation of S3's interface, allowing GLINT to use 
video and multimedia co-processors, or for the GLINT to be used as 
a 3D coprocessor to an S3 device. 

UPGRADE PATH 

The GLINT 300SX is the first of a family of GLINT graphics processors 
that are designed to meet the demands of the graphics designer. The 
GLINT300TX, is a second generation pin compatible processor that 
enhances the SX's texture capabilities - supporting local texture 
storage and pixel address generation for all OpenGL texturing modes. 


NOTICE: 3Dlabs reserves the right to change the above specifications 
without notice. 

From looking at the various boards, it appears that typical performance 
quotes are in the following range: 


ÿÿÿ3D Gouraud shaded, depth buffered, window clipped, stippled, dithered,
ÿÿÿand alpha tested rendering performance with 24-bit RGB color 
ÿÿÿdepth is the following: 
ÿÿÿ

ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿ1M 10 pixel vectors/sec 
ÿÿÿ500K 10x10 pixel, flat shaded rectangles/sec 
ÿÿÿ500K 9x13 pixels characters/second 
ÿÿÿScroll Rate 48M pixels/second - 8 bits/pixel

CS02) Lockheed Martin Real3D


Information on the Lockheed Martin Read3D chipset was obtained from 
their WWW server at the following URL:
[*]http://www.mmc.com/real3d/
Check there for more information, or call 1-800-393-7730, or send 
email to [*]real3d@mmc.com. 

The following is taken from a press release found at that site: 

The REAL3D(tm) chipset is based on real-time computer image generation 
technology that gives a combination of dynamic response and realism 
previously available only on dedicated graphics workstations and 
high end custom image generators. 

The first product will be the R3D/100 graphics accelerator. Key 
performance attributes of the new chip set include an embedded 100 
MFLOPS geometry processor, pixel write rates of up to 33 million 
pixels per second, up to 750,000 polygons per second, line processing 
up to 1.5 million per second, and provides up to 192 color texture 
maps (128 x 128 mipmapped) in real-time. 

The new product is an outgrowth of Lockheed Martin's proprietary 
computer graphics technology previously used in high performance 
military simulation, engineering research and training applications 
first developed for astronaut training and military flight simulators. 


The chip set provides faster processing through its patented hardware 
design which incorporates geometry processing, rasterization and 
texture mapping. The R3D/100 embedded floating point geometry processor 
removes significant processing burden from the host CPU. The patented 
texture processor applies color mipmapped texture to polygons in 
true 3D corrected perspective. 

Designed as a true polygon processor with texture processing and 
scaleable texture memory from the outset, the R3D/100 chip set includes 
dedicated hardware acceleration of mipmapped texturing that provides 
continuous high fidelity image quality. This chip set simulates spotlights,
fog and realistic curved surfaces. Additionally, improved image quality 
is provided with multi-pass anti-aliasing. 

The R3D/100 chip set directly interfaces with Microsoft 3D/DDI and 
supports all 3D/DDI-compliant APIs, such as OpenGL(tm) and comes 
with device driver software and a device driver kit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CS03) S-MOS SPC1500 3D Graphics Geometry Processor


S-MOS Systems is offering the industry's first commercially available 
single chip 3D geometry accelerator for the PC marketplace. 

The SPC1500 will work together with any 3D rendering processors to 
accelerate 3D graphics up to 300K+ lighted triangles per second. 


Why is geometry processing acceleration important?
Rendering processors alone, even on Pentium class machines, can not 
deliver true workstation class performance. This is because even 
the fastest CPUs today are quickly overcome by the amount of algorithmic 
processing necessary to transform a 3D data stream to a 2D perspective 
with lighting and material effects. 

The SPC1500 integrates a 150Mflop dual floating point engine, an 
on-chip DMA processor, on-chip ROM to store the algorithm instruction 
set, and an on-chip RAM cache to store customer instructions in a 
single 223 pin PGA package. 

Easy integration 
S-MOS Systems provides a complete design package for the system integrator 
and board vendor..... 

PCI Reference Designs
S-MOS Systems provides reference designs and evaluation kits showing 
the capabilities of the SPC1500 running OpenGL on the WindowsNT platform. 
Full technical manuals, electronic gerber files, and applications 
notes are available. 

WindowsNT and OS/2 Support
S-MOS Systems provides OpenGL compliant software and system utilities 
for the WindowsNT platform. This software supports any rendering 
board (2D or 3D) that supports 3D DDI. It will also supports direct 
data transfer to the leading 3D rendering board vendors. 

MacOS Support
S-MOS Systems will will support software drivers and system utilities 
for Quickdraw3D. 

An Acrobat version of the SPC1500 Datasheet is available via their 
page at
[*]http://www.smos.com/standard/spc1500.htm 

For more information contact Giri Venkat, Product Marketing Engineer,
S-MOS Systems (E-Mail: [*]venkat@smos.com). 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CS04) ARTIST Graphics 3GA Graphics Processor


The 3GA is a 2D and 3D graphics coprocessor with a fast VGA core 
which means that boards designed around the 3GA will not only run 
the next generation of software, but will run the software programs 
of today faster than ever before. Bus support for PCI, ISA, and MicroChannel 
means that the 3GA is one of the most flexible graphics chips available,
as well as the most powerful. 

The 3GA's features include built-in Windows acceleration, 2D and 
3D lines, flat-shading, Gouraud-shading, and texture-mapping. Initial 
benchmarks show that the 3GA is significantly faster than the S3 
968 Windows accelerator. 

Technical information about the [*]chip design is also available,
and if you have Acrobat, you can view the full [*]24 page datasheet. 


Information on the 3GA can be obtained from the ARTIST Graphics home 
page at 
[*]http://artgraphics.com/ 

The technical specs below were copied directly from that page.

CS05) NVidia/SGS-THOMSON NV1/STG-2000 Multimedia Accelerators

The information I currently have is from the press releases on the 
NVIDEA Home page at
[*]http://www.nvidea.com/ 

NVIDIA Corporation and SGS-THOMSON, today announced the introduction 
of the NV1 and STG2000 Multimedia Accelerators. The first complete 
multimedia accelerators, the NV1 and STG2000 represent the culmination 
of a strategic partnership that began over a year ago. The technology 
will deliver powerful multimedia capabilities exceeding that of next 
generation game consoles, while preserving the versatility of the 
personal computer. Available now, they are single-chip Multimedia 
Accelerators that delivers the power of real-time photorealistic 
3D graphics, full-motion video and special effects, and concurrent 
high-fidelity audio for interactive multimedia. 

They feature stunning 3D graphics capabilities with texture-mapping,
lighting effects, and a special feature called video texturing. This 
unique feature allows developers to texture a 3D object with full-
motion video, creating new levels of realism never before possible 
in a PC application. In addition, they deliver concurrent high-fidelity 
wave-table audio, full-motion video acceleration, world-class GUI 
acceleration, enhanced digital game port, and an internal synchronization 
timer for multimedia. 

Market coverage will be provided by two versions of the multimedia 
accelerator. NVIDIA will market and sell the NV1 (VRAM version) while 
SGS-THOMSON will market and sell the STG2000 (DRAM version). Both 
products are available with PCI and VL bus interfaces. The NV1 or 
STG2000 allow leading-edge adapter card and PC OEMs to offer a multimedia 
sub-system with dazzling 3D, wave-table audio, GUI acceleration, 
enhanced game port performance, and video acceleration--on a single-
card with a street price of around $200.

COMMENTS:
There are no current plans to do an NT driver, or OpenGL, although 
some third parties have expressed interest. They don't think consumers 
will be running applications on OpenGL or NT. The chips does not 
support texture memory. They do forward texture mapping: specify 
the control points (4 for bilinear, 9 for quadratic surface), specify 
the subdivision of the texture, then write texels. As you write each 
texel the chip computes its location on-screen, optionally computes 
a blend value for it, and it shows up on-screen. 

I'm not sure, but it doesn't not appear to have a Z-buffer, either.

NVIDEA01) Diamond Edge 3D Accelerators

The information on these boards were obtained from Diamond Multimedia 
Systems home page at
[*]http://www.diamondmm.com/ 

They contain the [*]NVidia/SGS-THOMSON NV1/STG-2000 chipset. 

The boards are PCI-based and sport a digital gameport for precise 
joystick control, as well as two video gameports that allow specialized,
multi-player versions of Sega Saturn titles, such as the arcade hit 
Virtua Fighter Remix, to be played on Windows 95 PCs. It is expected 
to be initially shipped in late October at consumer prices starting 
from $249 - $299. 

With Diamond Edge 3D accelerators, game developers can support resolutions 
as high as 1024x768 with 65,000 colors while still achieving fast,
realistic action. In the past, this type of technology was available 
only to engineers and designers with prices topping $2,000. 

The 3D functions of the Diamond Edge 3D were designed specifically 
for the consumer multimedia market where the primary application 
is interactive entertainment. Traditionally, 3D graphics were created 
by drawing large numbers of successive polygons using the CPU, which 
resulted in a tradeoff between detailed graphics and speed of interactivity. 
With the Diamond Edge 3D, the hardware engine accelerates polygon 
rendering of real-time, texture-mapped 3D images at the highest possible 
frame rates without unduly slowing the CPU. In addition, the Diamond 
Edge 3D can create realistic 3D graphics by using nine control points 
to create a curved surface, called quadratic texture mapping (QTM). 


Features of the Diamond Edge 3D engine include fast polygon rendering,
texture-mapping for photo-realism, quadratic texture-mapping for 
perspective correction and rendering of curved surfaces, as well 
as special effects including diffused lighting, specular highlights,
reflection mapping and alpha blending for fog, smoke and transparency. 

High Performance 2D Acceleration 


The Diamond Edge 3D delivers fast 2D Windows acceleration at resolutions 
as high as 1280x1024, color depths to 1 billion and refresh rates 
of up to 120Hz. 

The DRAM version of the Diamond Edge 3D, based on SGS Thomson's STG2000 
multimedia accelerator chip, is available for PCI-bus in 1MB upgradable 
to 2MB (the Diamond Edge 3D 2120XL) or 2MB standard (the Diamond 
Edge 3D 2200XL.) The VRAM configuration, based on NVIDIA Corp.'s 
NV1 multimedia accelerator chip, is available for PCI in 2MB upgradable 
to 4MB (the Diamond Edge 3D 3240XL) or 4MB standard (the Diamond 
Edge 3D 3400XL.) Both chips are based on NVIDIA's NV1 technology. 
Diamond estimates pricing for the 2000 series to start at $249 to 
$299 and for the 3000 series to start at $399 to $449.

B03) Evans &amp Sutherland Freedom


PRESS RELEASE:


-=- [PREFORMATTED] =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
EVANS &amp SUTHERLAND BRINGS 3D GRAPHICS EXPERTISE TO THE PERSONAL 
COMPUTER 

SALT LAKE CITY, March 2, 1995 Evans &amp Sutherland Computer Corporation 
(NASDAQ: ESCC) today announced Freedom Graphics(tm) for the Personal 
Computer. Freedom Graphics is the first product to bring the 3D 
graphics technology of E&ampS to the personal computing environment. 


Freedom Graphics is an implementation of the specialized features 
that 3D graphics applications require for smooth, fast execution. 
Users can produce impressive realistic images with the product's 
rich feature set and high-performance graphics for Windows/NT(r) 
applications. 

The graphics card supports the OpenGL(r) software application programming 
interface and is designed to accelerate OpenGL in the PC environment. 
Freedom Graphics is a PCI bus-based card that incorporates the same 
technology as the Freedom Series graphics accelerators which supply 
high-end graphics for the world's largest workstation vendors. Ideal 
markets to take advantage of the extensive feature set of Freedom 
Graphics are CAD, Industrial Design, Simulation, Visualization, Animation,
Entertainment and Game Development. Supported PC processors include 
MIPS(tm), Pentium(r) and Power PC(tm). 

"The interest being generated by Freedom Graphics is extraordinary,
" said Jim Oyler, President and CEO of Evans &amp Sutherland. "Freedom 
Graphics allows a low-cost PC-based system to achieve the performance 
of a much more expensive workstation. This is going to be an explosive 
market in the very near future." 

Evans &amp Sutherland is the only 3D graphics vendor with a product 
line that spans the entire computing industry from the personal computer 
up to multi-million dollar flight simulators and location-based entertainment 
systems. 

"We are pleased that Evans &amp Sutherland has applied their knowledge 
and experience in high-performance real-time 3D graphics to the PC 
marketplace," said Tom Coull, President of Sense8 Corporation. "WorldToolKit 
and Freedom Graphics will offer a definitive hardware-accelerated 
solution for texture-mapped virtual reality applications." 

Freedom Graphics' feature set includes real-time 3D graphics rendering 
and animation, hardware based 24-bit texture acceleration, scalable 
texture memory up to 16 MBytes, bi-linear and tri-linear MIP-mapping,
specular highlights, fast set-up calculations, full scene antialiasing,
transparency and depth cueing. The additional experience of E&ampS 
with OpenGL will also result in significant performance advantages 
for applications using the OpenGL library from E&ampS. 

According to Ian Reid, Vice-President of Marketing at Advanced Visual 
Systems, "Freedom Graphics offers a new level of capability for the 
PC user and AVS/Express allows any PC developer to take immediate 
advantage of features such as hardware texture-mapping and transparency. 
It's the ideal combination." 

Freedom Graphics performance under Windows/NT and OpenGL is 300,000 
triangles/second. The card will list price at US$2450 with second 
quarter availability through OEMs and VARs. Freedom Graphics was 
first shown at Fall Comdex '94 in Las Vegas. 

The significance of Freedom Graphics lies in its delivery of a graphics 
feature set at unsurpassed performance levels. Advanced features 
such as texture mapping are still unavailable from any other vendor 
for under US$10,000. Freedom Graphics also provides performance 
not yet seen in the 3D PC graphics market. Nearest competitors for 
performance provide minimal feature sets and are only available at 
much higher prices. 

Evans &amp Sutherland is a leader in advanced 3D graphics and visualization 
systems for science, industry, education, and entertainment. The 
Graphics Systems Division provides graphics hardware and software 
solutions that are sold and supported by DEC, HP, IBM, and Sun Microsystems.

COMMENT: From Chris Hinch ([*]chris@dcc.govt.nz): 
-=- [PREFORMATTED] =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
I heard comments on comp.sys.opengl that, at the moment, the Impression 
Plus doesn't have "true" OpenGL support under Windows NT. I don't 
know if this is correct or not. 

-=- [PREFORMATTED] =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
From Blair MacIntyre: 
-=- [PREFORMATTED] =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This is partially true. Someone from Microsoft posted saying that 
NT 3.51 will include the appropriate driver for OpenGL for this card.

B05) Oki TrianGL


More information on Oki and their products can be found on their 
web page ([*]www.oki.com) or by sending email to [*]triangl@oki.com 


The information here was extracted from the page
[*]http://www.oki.com/products/TrianGL.html 

Oki's TrianGL is aimed at 3D applications using the OpenGL graphics 
API. 

At the heart of the TrianGL is a custom, high-performance rendering 
ASIC--a drawing engine which provides both 2D and 3D acceleration. 
The chip interfaces directly to multiple banks of video RAM via a 
80-bit data bus, boosting overall drawing performance. 

The four banks of VRAM, 10 MBytes in all, each operate independently 
to maximize the performance efficiency of the rendering ASIC. For 
many drawing primitives, all the banks can operate in parallel. 
However, for certain primitives, such as vector drawing or triangle 
drawing, address and color values are sent from the ASIC to the appropriate 
memory banks in a pipelined, serial fashion. TrianGL's use of triangle 
drawing primitives gives the board a major performance advantage 
over other products which use simpler span primitives. 

Two separate RGB buffers allow true hardware double buffering for 
smooth, artifact-free animation. An independent 24-bit Z buffer is 
dedicated for hidden surface removal during 3D object rendering. 
And finally, eight utility planes support board-specific video options 
such as overlays, window types and RGB double buffering. In order 
to support VGA compatibility, a VESA standard VGA passthrough interface 
is included on the board.

Software Support 

Oki supports TrianGL on PC and RISC PC platforms with host software 
drivers for Windows NT 3.5. OpenGL and DDI support are available 
for Intel and Mips platforms. Other popular APIs, including AutoCAD,
will be supported in future software releases. 

Look for future TrianGL versions with higher resolution, and a PCI 
bus interface.

B06) Intergraph GLZ Series 


The GLZ series accelerates OpenGL[tm] graphics on Intergraph Computer 
Systems' TDZ workstations. GLZs let you manipulate Gouraud-shaded 
3D models by adding realistic effects such as lighting, translucency,
and textured surfaces; and performing spectacular flythroughs, walkthroughs,
and animations--all in real time, at high resolutions, and in true 
color. 

By performing shading and geometry operations in dedicated hardware,
GLZs ease the load on the TDZ's Pentium[tm] processor(s) and cut 
down traffic on the PCI bus, which results in dramatic improvements 
in graphics performance. 

The GLZ family supports Intergraph's 17- and 21-inch multi-sync monitors 
and 21- and 27-inch InterVue monitors at resolutions up to 1,600 
x 1,280 pixels. The GLZs support dual screens and are ready for stereoscopic 
display on any stereo-ready monitor. (LCD shutter glasses and emitter 
modules are required and are available from Intergraph Computer Systems.) 


The GLZ family offers a selection of 34, 24, or 12 megabytes of VRAM. 
24 megabytes of VRAM supports resolutions up to 1,600 x 1,280 with 
16.8 million colors (true color). 12 megabytes of VRAM suppots true 
color at a maximum resolution of 1,152 x 854. 34 megabytes of VRAM 
supports a 32-bit Z buffer, double-buffered true color, and display 
capabilities such as translucency and overlay at resolutions up to 
1,600 x 1,280. 

Intergraph Computer Systems offers six different GLZ configurations. 


GLZ6--photorealism in real time

The top of our 3D graphics accelerator line--offers shading acceleration,
geometry acceleration, and texture-processing for fast, real-time 
rendering of complex and detailed designs.

ÿÿÿcolor refinement in demanding imaging applications (see 
ÿÿÿp.11) 
ÿÿÿ10-bit gamma correction using state-of-the-art, 10-bit digital-
ÿÿÿto-analog converters, enabling user control of gamma values 
ÿÿÿwith no loss of color resolution 


GLZ5--cost-effective photorealism

Our GLZ5 offers the same high-performance shading and geometry acceleration 
as does GLZ6. With 12 MB of VRAM, GLZ5 supports resolutions up to 
1,152 x 864. Two megatexels (8 megabytes of texture memory) provide 
more than enough texture storage for adding patterns to furniture,
waves to water, or trees to parks and forests. 

GLZ5's low price may even tempt you to invest in dual screens and 
LCD shutter glasses for a stereoscopic adventure into virtual reality! 


Product highlights (same as the GLZ6, except where noted) 
ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿ12 MB of high-speed VRAM for 92 bit planes of video memory at 
ÿÿÿresolutions up to 1,152 x 864, providing:

ÿÿÿfrom 640 x 480 pixels to 1,152 x 864 


GLZ4 and GLZ3--accelerated geometry and shading

GLZ4 and GLZ3 support both shading and geometry acceleration. If 
you need fast, accurate rendering of complex solid models but don't 
normally require realtime texture processing for photorealism, GLZ4 
(24 MB of VRAM) or GLZ3 (12 MB of VRAM) will give you performance 
that more than meets your expectations. Don't worry if you occasionally 
need to render a textured image. Thanks to OpenGL, texture processing 
is fully supported in software.
