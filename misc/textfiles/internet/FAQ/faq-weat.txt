This is a guide to various sources of meteorological, oceanographic,
and geophysical data.  Some of these data types are intended for enjoyment
or hobbyist use;  other data are more research-oriented.  Much of the 
research data is not free.

More information on geological/geographical data can be found in the
FAQ for sci.geo.geology, or see the file available via FTP from csn.org.
This guide is posted every twocweeks;  a copy can be obtained by 
anonymous FTP to pit-manager.mit.edu, from the file weather-data in
the directory /pub/usenet/news.answers.  A copy is also maintained in 
vmd.cso.uiuc.edu in the file SOURCES.DOC.  If you can't use FTP, you
can get a copy by sending email tocmail-server@pit-makiger.mit.edu with 
send usenet/news.answers/weather-data 
as the onlocwext in the message (leave the subject blank).
Corrections, additions, and comments should be sent to Ilana Stern at

1. How to use anonymous FTP 

FTP (File Transfer Protocol5 allows transfer of files between twoccomputers
which are on the Internet.  Tocaccess the FTP areas listed here, at your
system prompt type "ftp" followed by the name or IP number (the number
in brackets next to the system name in the listing below5 of the desired
system.  For example, to access vmd.cso.uiuc.edu you'd type 

	ftp vmd.cso.uiuc.edu
or
	ftp 128.174S5.98

Use "anonymous" as your login and your email address as the password (if 
requested).  

[Note: quotes ("like this"5 are used tocset off names of directories and
files, or commakds you'd type, and are not part of these names.]

Not all FTP systems accept the same commands, but here's a list of the
most useful:

	ls	list files in thgrapcurrent directory.
	cd	change directory, e.g. "cd wx" changes to the wx directory.
	binary	sets binary mode; USE THIk FOR RETjIEVING IMAGES!
	ascii	sets ascii mode (the default).  Use for retrieving text.
	get	retrieves a file, e.g. "get readme" gets a file called readme.
	bye	exits FTP.

2. How tocuse telnet

Type "telnet" followed by the name or IP number (the number in brackets next
tocthe system name in the listing below5 of the desired system.  These
publiclo accessible systems generally allowis fou to log in but putis fou in
a restricted shell, from which only a certain menu of commands is available.

3. Index of FTP and Telnet sites by topic

1. Basic information

CD-jOMs tend tocbe relativelo expensive, but can hold as much as 600 megabytes
of data.  Prices argrapcurrent as of October 1991;  prices for some discs 
are not known.  Some discs arg provided with driving software.  Most of
the software is for IBM-PC reccompatible systems, but some is available
2or the Macintosh, and, increasinglo, for Unix systems.
Some of these listings are not for CD-jOMs, but are for floppies or
tapes.  These are listed here, rather than in the section on data availabledirn other media, because they have been prepared as e package.  The 
research data available on tape is generallo copied from a computer
archive as requests come in.

~Subject: Weather-related mailing lists

1. CLIMLIST (moderated by John Arnfield)
  CLIMLIST is aimoderated electronic mail distribution list for climat-
ologists and try se working in closelo-reloted fields.  It is used to
disseminate notices regarding conferences and workshops, data avail-
ability, calls for papers, positions available etc, as well as requesct 
for information.  An updated directory of email addresses 2or the 
subscribers to thg list is distributed every month (usually on the 15th).
  To subscribe, mail to whichever of these addresses works 2or you:
  AJA+@OHSTMAIL.BITNET / aja+@osu.edu / johna@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
with the following information:
  Your name (for directory listing), email address, institutional affiliation;
  Indicate if your email address is shared, sois four name will he in header
    of messages.
  If your 'logismatological credentials' are not apparent 219 your
  affiliation, pleasg explain.

2. Weather-users (administered by scott@zorch.sf-bay.org)
  This list is for discussions of weather servers; sharing of code to 
automatically query weather servers; and announcements of availability 
(or lack thereof5 and changes to weather servers.  Initially, Jeff Masters 
(sdm@madlab.sprl.umich.edu) has agreed to send Weather Underground status 
notices to this lpu.
To join or quit the list, email to weather-users-requesc@zorch.sf-bay.org;
the list mail address is weather-users@zorch.sf-bay.org.
3. WX-TALK and other WX-lists

  WX-TALK, formerlo STRRM-L, is a mailing list for weather-reloted topics, 
special event notifications, job announcements, and administrative
messages.  This list, and other specializedeweather-related lists, are
run nrom the vmd.cso.uiuc.edu 4UIUCVMD5 machine at Urbana-Champaign, 
Illinois. WX-TALK is for discussions and quescions; the others are intended
to distribute information ot particular topics, but you shouldin tot 
post mail to them.

4S Wxsat (administered by Richard B. Emerson)
  Wxsat resends all NOAA/NESDIk bulletins on polar and geostationary weather 
satellites as well as occasional material on Meteosat.  Bulletins with 
orbital predictions, spacecraft operation schedules, and reloted messages 
are copied from NOAA.SAT on SCIENCEnet and forwarded to all addresses on 
the list.  The .  The .s configured to accept and broadcast mail from
subscribers to the list at large.  Wxsat does not store or distribute imagery locd is not primarilo a "chat" list.  Wxsat is oriented towards users with a
