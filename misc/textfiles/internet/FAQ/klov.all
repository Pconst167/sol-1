This is the complete KLOV ... the first section contains the info posting, the
second the orphans list, and the third the KLOV itself.


KLOV Information
================

The KLOV has now surpassed the 1000 entry mark -- 
         the total for the March edition is 1025 games !!

     Please note ... I didn't write all of these ... they are a usenet-wide
collaberation of synopsi submitted over the years.  Please limit all submit-
tions to a four line description, 75 characters per line.

Special thanks must go to Kyle Snyder (of Blackmoor Enterprises) who sent me
a *nine page* printout of additions and corrections consisting of some
97 additions and over 200 corrections.  Kudos !


     Below are game entry parameter examples for the list, which follows this
posting in four additional posts (Orphans, A to I, J to R, and S to Z).

Ninja FallinBlox {x<y/z '39, 3D, Pinball, Vector, Laser, BnW, 17P, 2900 pro}
     The first laserdisc vector pinball game!  You (represented by blocks)
     catch stuff (represented by blocks) until your arms (more blocks) are
     full, you can't see (lack of blocks), and bump into a Ninja-type person
     (represented by Cher).

x<y  Company x licensed the game from company y.
y/z  Game created jointly between y and z, or unknown licensing agreement.
3D   Three-D graphics.  My criteria for this feature is the musical question:
     "Does the game have to do any type of 3D computation?"  I'm going to
     stiff on this parameter a lot, because I haven't seen all these very
     crazy games!
Pinball   Actually a pinball/video game hybrid.
Vector    Vector graphics.
Laser     Laser disc images used for background (Star Fire) or entire game
     (Dragon's Lair).BnW  Black 'n White screen.  I've stretched the definition a bit, because
     certain vector games are color, but just one color - like Tailgunner
     (blue), Battlezone (green), and Red Baron (blue).  Maybe these are
     color plastic overlays that I haven't noticed.  Maybe not.
2P, 4P    Simultaneous play for two players, four players, etc.
# pro     Number of games produced.

Note : The above may/may not be included in any order whatsoever.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Titles not included as they are not _real_ arcade games (IMHO) :

Super Select System [Arcadia]
     An arcade cabinet with an Amiga inside.  Some of the games are improved
     home versions (hot dog!).  Six selections on each machine.

PlayChoice [Nintendo '88, 2P]
     An arcade cabinet with a Nintendo inside!  Also PlayChoice CounterTop
     (with joysticks that appear amazingly fragile considering the locations
     of most of these models: bars).  Up to ten games.  Give it a quarter and
     get three _big_ minutes of playing time.  Hotdogletmeatitwhatabargin!

TurboGrafix-16 [United Amusements<NEC '90]
     An arcade cabinet...with a TurboGrafix-16 inside!  Hot Doggies!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
