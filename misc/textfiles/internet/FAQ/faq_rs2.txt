              The Rolling Stones--Live and Unreleased Audio
              (Version 1.31 of *this* document)

    This is an introduction and guide to the live concert and studio
    outtake recordings of the Rolling Stones.  This information is for
    educational purposes only.

    The Rolling Stones have been around for 30 years and have released
    many albums.  However, for some fans, they haven't released enough.
    This is a guide for those fans who want to know what the Stones were
    doing on their many unrecorded tours, or are curious to hear the
    various working stages of a classic song.  The only way to hear
    this is from unauthorized recordings.

    Unauthorized recordings may be either live concerts or studio
    outtakes.  Live concerts may be recorded in several ways:  In the
    audience using a hand held tape recorder, by a sound man from the
    soundboard, or from a radio broadcast.  Audience recordings will
    generally sound the worst, but modern technology makes it possible
    to have very good audience recordings.  Studio outtakes are
    generally of good quality as the recording is usually professionally
    done.  In all cases, sound quality will deteriorate as analog copies
    are made from one generation to the next.

    Here is a partial list of unauthorized recordings by the Rolling
    Stones.  Some of these are easy to find, others are out of print.
    Most but not all are available on CD.  Listings are by location,
    date, length, quality, and source. Quality ratings are from 1 to 10
    and are REALISTIC, with 1 being unlistenable and 10 being perfect
    release quality. 'm' indicates mono, 's' stereo, and 'es' electronic
    stereo.  Also included are typical sets for live concerts.

    This list is not complete.  I have omitted many obscure LPs, CDs,
    and tape only performances.  Many of the best recorded performances
    have been released by as many as 10 different companies; I have
    listed only the best or one of the best versions.


Part 1:  The Early Years with Brian Jones

    Most of the recordings from this period are either from media
    appearances such as the BBC and TV shows, or studio outtakes.
    Although the band toured constantly, there are few unauthorized
    concert recordings.  This was the time of Beatlemania, and screaming
    girls and often riots at concerts.  With the extremely primitive PA
    systems of the era, the Stones were frequently drowned out by the
    screaming audience.

Part 1a:  Brian is phased out

    The Stones did their last tour with Brian in the spring of 1967.
    They were unable to tour after that due to Brian's legal and health
    problems.  The Rock and Roll Circus was to be a way around this,
    bringing the performance to the audience instead of the other way
    around.

"Sympathy..." rehearsals 5-6/68;  20 min;  7.0 m;  "Angie"
Outtakes                '68-'72;  70 min;  8.0 s;  "On the Rocks"

Rock & Roll Circus     12/12/68;  18 min;  8.0 m;  "R&R Circus"


Part 2:  The middle period with Mick Taylor

    After the forced exit of Brian, the Stones hired Mick Taylor as new
    lead guitarist.  His excellent playing made this lineup arguably the
    best for live performances.

    His first gig with them, Hyde Park, became a tribute to Brian.  It
    took place only 2 days after his death and featured several songs
    which would not be played live again.

Hyde Park, 7/5/69; 85 min; 8.0 m; "Stones in the Park"/others

    The first actual tour with Mick Taylor was the fall/winter 1969 US
    Tour.  "Let It Bleed" was released at the end of the tour.  Toward
    the end of the tour the band did some recordings at Muscle Shoals,
    Alabama (partly documented on "Time Trip" above).  New York, Muscle
    Shoals, and Altamont are documented in the movie "Gimme Shelter."
    The official live album from this tour is the excellent "Get Yer
    Ya-Yas Out."  Of possible interest to trivia freaks is the fact that
    Love in Vain was actually recorded in Baltimore, not NYC as claimed
    on the sleeve.

    Typical set for 1969 US tour:  Jumping Jack Flash, Carol, Sympathy
    for the Devil, Stray Cat Blues, Love in Vain, Prodigal Son (not at
    all shows), You Gotta Move (not at all shows), Under My Thumb,
    Midnight Rambler, Live with Me, Little Queenie, Satisfaction, Honky
    Tonk Woman, Street Fighting Man.  Played infrequently:  I'm Free,
    Gimme Shelter.  Played only at Altamont:  The Sun is Shining (by
    Jimmy Reed), Brown Sugar.

    The 1969 US tour established a pattern which would continue until
    1982:  US tour every 3 years, with a European tour the following
    year.  There was no 1979 European tour, but the New Barbarians
    toured that year.

Other recordings are available, but these are the best/most common:

Oakland     11/9/69 1st show;  70 min;  8.0 m;  "Bring It Back Aliver"
Oakland     11/9/69 2nd show;  70 min;  8.0 m;  "Liver Than You'll Ever Be"/
                                                 many others
San Diego   11/10/69;          45 min;  8.0 m;  "Stoneaged"
Outtakes '69-'74, studio&live; 30 min;  8.5 s;  "A Shot of Salvation"
Altamont Speedway 12/6/69;     82 min;  5.5 es; "Altamont"

    In early 1970, the first Stones bootleg record came out, called
    "Liver Than You'll Ever Be."  It was the second bootleg of a major
    rock band, after Dylan's "Great White Wonder."  At that time, being
    bootlegged was almost prestigious, a far cry from the way things are
    today.  "Liver Than" was even reviewed in "Rolling Stone" magazine
    in the February 7, 1970 issue.

    There are no really excellent recordings from the next tour, Europe
    1970.  However, as of late 1993, more of these recordings are
    becoming available, including the first ever soundboard tape.
    Unfortunately, they are mostly on hard to get Japanese CDs.
    Musically, this tour was similar to the 1969 US tour except that a
    horn section was used for the first time.

    Typical set for 1970 European tour:  Jumping Jack Flash, Roll Over
    Beethoven, Sympathy for the Devil, Stray Cat Blues, Love in Vain,
    Prodigal Son, Dead Flowers, Midnight Rambler, Live with Me, Little
    Queenie, Let it Rock, Brown Sugar, Honky Tonk Woman, Street Fighting
    Man.  Played infrequently:  Gimme Shelter.

Berlin  9/16/70; 45 min; 7.0 m; "CS Roll Over Berlin"
Paris   9/23/70; 70 min; 5.5 m; "Paris 1970" (FM w/commentary)
Paris   9/24/70; 60 min; 7.5 m; "Paris 1970" (soundboard)
Essen  10/07/70; 50 min; 7.0 m; "European Tour 1970"

    Before their contract with Decca expired, The Stones were required
    to record one more song.  Fed up with Decca, they recored Cocksucker
    Blues.  Its unauthorized releases are frequently paired with a
    studio outtake of Brown Sugar featuring Eric Clapton on third
    guitar.

"CS Blues"/"Brown Sugar" w/Clapton; 10 min; 10.0 s; "CS Blues"

    The band did a farewell tour of England in 1971 before leaving as
    tax exiles.  "Sticky Fingers" was released after this tour.  Let
    It Rock from Leeds 3/13 has been legally released.

    Me, Dead Flowers, Stray Cat Blues, Love in Vain, Midnight Rambler,
    Bitch, Honky Tonk Woman, Satisfaction, Little Queenie, Brown Sugar,
    Street Fighting Man.  Played infrequently:  I Got the Blues, Let It
    Rock (encore).

    in France.  Outtakes are available.

Rehearsing for their 1972 US tour, the Stones were filmed by the BBC.

Montreux rehearsals 5/21/72; 25 min; 9.0 m; "Time Trip"

    The 1972 US tour in support of "Exile on Main Street" was sucessful
    both musically and financially.  Not one but two movies were made,
    the unreleased behind-the-scenes "Cocksucker Blues" and the concert
    documentary "Ladies and Gentlemen the Rolling Stones."  There was to
    be a double LP live album but it remains unreleased due to Decca
    withholding the rights to several songs.

    Typical set for 1972 US tour:  Brown Sugar, Bitch, Rocks Off, Gimme
    Shelter, Happy, Tumbling Dice, Love in Vain, Sweet Virginia, You

Part 3:  The Ron Wood era:

    Just before the Stones were to go into the studio and record "Black
    and Blue," Mick Taylor abruptly quit.  Three different guest
    guitarists ended up on the album, and the band also jammed with Jeff
    Beck, but when they toured the US in 1975, Ronnie Wood was the
    "guest" lead guitarist.

Due to tensions within the band, there was no touring again until 1989.

Outtakes are available for "Dirty Work."

"Dirty Work" outtakes 7-11/85; 69 min; (Ex-); "Dirtiest Work"

    After much speculation if there would ever be another tour, the
    Stones finally toured the US in 1989 in support of "Steel Wheels."
    For the first time, most of the live material was not from the new
    album.  Each concert was a look back on their long career, and they
    performed songs that had never been attempted live.  The band also
    used a much larger cast of supporting musicians than in the past.
    The Stones "toured" Japan in February by playing in Tokyo for about
    10 days.

    Typical set for 1989 Steel Wheels US tour:  Start Me Up, Bitch, Sad
    Sad Sad, Undercover of the Night, Harlem Shuffle, Tumbling Dice,
    Miss You, Ruby Tuesday, Play with Fire, Rock and a Hard Place, Mixed
    Emotions, Honky Tonk Woman, Midnight Rambler, You Can't Always Get
    What You Want, Little Red Rooster (not at all shows), Before They
    Make Me Run or Can't Be Seen, Happy, Paint It Black, 2000 Light
    Years from Home, Sympathy for the Devil, Gimme Shelter, It's Only
    Rock and Roll, Brown Sugar, Satisfaction, Jumping Jack Flash.
    Played infrequently:  Shattered, Salt of the Earth, Dead Flowers,
    One Hit to the Body, Angie, Almost Hear You Sigh, Terrifying.

The author acknowledges that every living member and ex member of the
band has done some sort of solo project.  Keith's solo tours of 1988
and 1992-93 have been heavily bootlegged, and Mick's tour of 1988 is
also fairly well represented.  However, cataloging those releases is
beyond the scope of this guide.  Plus, I don't collect that material.


Notes on collecting CDs:

    As far as I know, European copyright laws have now changed so that
    CDs which used to be unauthorized but legal in some countries are
    now illegal in all countries.  Apparently Phil Collins won a lawsuit
    in Germany on October 20, 1993, which means that European artists
    such as the Stones can prevent the manufacture and sale of
    unauthorized CDs, at least in Europe.  Of course there are plenty of
    "underground" companies to fill the vacuum.  Apparently formerly
    legal companies such as The Swingin' Pig, Oh Boy, Living Legend,
    Great Dane, Bulldog, WPOCM, The Genuine Pig, and others are now out
    of business.

    The best of these was the Swingin' Pig.  Most of their CDs were
    mastered from tapes, unlike some companies which used old records,
    and they generally used the best available tape for a particular
    show.  On the downside, they sometimes overdid the noise
    reduction, which made the music sound bassy and compressed.

    Apparently Australia is now the way Europe used to be:  Unauthorized
    recordings may be released legally, provided royalties are paid.
    I am unclear on the details of this.

    Other companies don't bother with details like royalties; these
    bootlegs are illegal in all countries.  One of the best of these
    labels is Scorpio, which seems to go by several different names.
    Unlike most labels, they concentrate on studio outtakes, and have
    actually put out "new" material.  They still aren't above
    dubbing some tracks off old records here and there, however.

    The Vigatone label has produced only a few Stones CDs but they are
    all excellent, from tapes.  The Chameleon or "Chamelion" label is
    also excellent.

    "Terappin" or Terrapin label CDs are very hard to come by but are
    mostly rare material in decent to good quality.

    Japanese CDs on labels such as Digger Productions, Hot Lips Records,
    Golden Hits Records, Alley Cat, and Idol Mind are generally hard to
    come by in the US but often have rare material. The quality of these
    varies widely.  As of late 1993 onward, the Japanese have been the
    only labels putting out previously unreleased material, even material
    which was not in tape trading circles.
