Subject: FAQ
The following is a list of video game recorders and their capabilities.
They are compiled for your information.  I also put in some info
that I think might be of interests to you.

New info in this FAQ:
==============
New Mega Disk can read other formatted game files.
SuperMarioCart and Pilotwing cannot be backed-up because of special
chip/programming routine in the game cart.
Hey, instead of calling these game copiers, let's call it VGR, as in
Video Game Recorder.
MGH now can copy RAMA 1/2 part II and all other copy  protect games
excepte pilot wing and mario kart.
New copier information:  Super wild card, super pro fighter, Doctor SF
(game boxer).
SFX chip, DSP chip information.
Using the golden finger on the MGH.

What is a video game copier or the so-called "Game Doctor"?
=======================================================
	Video game copier is a device that can read the ROM on the
video game cartridges and transfer them onto regular floppy disks.
After you have the game's ROM data on the floppy, you can play
that particular game from the floppy without the original
cartridge.  Most of the available devices now has at least 8
MEGABits of memory build in; thus, allow you to load the
game data from the floppy to the build-in memory and play
games.  The game data will remain in the game copier's memory
until you turn off the game copier.  Hitting the reset button on the
game console will reset your game and you don't have to reload.
	"Game Doctor" is the name given to the first generation of
such device. (I first saw one about five years ago in Hong Kong)
Originally, it was made for the Nintendo Famicom which has the
largest market share.  But now, as the popularity of video game
machines shift from the old Nintendo 8 bit to SNES, SEGA and
NEC, the newest generation of the "Game Doctor" allows you to
buy different interfaces for different game consoles. IMO,
the "Multi Game Doctor 2" can let you buy different interfaces
for all the game consoles in the market, but it's more expensive.
The other game copiers are specifically designed for one or two
game systems only, but are less expensive.  Since there are more
companies making these devices now, I think the prices are
dropping due to competition.  One thing that will happen
eventually is that the Japanese company will do the best they can
to crackdown these video game copier makers (I read somewhere
that Japanese companies went to the Korean mafia in order to
shut down similar illegal operations in Korea), and it will
be harder to get these devices when they do.  One more thing,
these game copiers are not perfect in copying all the games in
the market.  If there are special save or graphical feature in the
game, they might not be able to copy these games (like some of
the earlier EA games for the Genesis).

The following is a list of all the video game copier currently available
that I know.  I got the information from game magazines published in
Taiwan and Hong Kong, and from a dealer in Taiwan..  I have tried to
translate them as accurate as I can, but I take no responsibilities for
mistakes.  But, I welcome anyone sees any mistakes and points them
out for me so I can make corrections.  Also, If you have any info or
questions, please let me know, I will update this FAQ periodically.
This is for your info only.

============================================
Name:	Mega Disk (Interceptor)
For: 	Can directly be used on Sega Mega Drive or Sega Genesis.
With a special interface, it can be used with SFC/SNES.  Also, a new
Mega Disk designed specifically for SNES/SFC is out.
Description:	A 3.5" HD drive sits on top of the Sega Mega
Drive or Genesis.  The MD version has 8 Megabits of memory (can
be upgraded to 16 M), the SFC version comes with 16M.  There is a
slot on the top right corner for plugging in a cartridge (A save
cartridge can be plugged in here to save game in progress).  The
company is working on a software upgrade that allows game
to be saved on disks other than the save cart.  It takes less than
40 seconds to load an 8 M game.  No LCD needed, but it needs a
special formatted 3.5" disk to back up games.  However, people from
the Usenet has found that CopyIIpc can copy these special formatted
disks provided you have an IBM available.  The Super Famicom
interface is a rectangular box sitting between the Mega Disk and
the Super Famicom, it also has a slot on the interface to plug in a
cartridge.  The new Mega Disk for SFC/SNES can format it's own
disk and can read MGDII and Super Magic formatted disks.
Pro & Con:  The good thing about Mega Disk is simplicity of operation,
it works perfectly on the MD/Genesis (except copying old EA games),
no external power supply needed.  The old version needs specially
formatted disks, but by using CopyIIpc, you can make your own disks.
The new Mega Disk can format it's own disks. I would recommend
Mega Disk over Super Magicom or drive because there is no need for
external power supply, easy to use and the company is much more
friendlier when you got problems.
NEW information on the mega disk:
	The old version of mega disk is now not forsale in Taiwan or HK.
	Only 16M version are forsale on the market.  The mega disk can
	read all other copiers files.  No need for extra memorie pack to
	keep your RPG games data.  Now has built in battery memorie.
This company also makes a different copier for the SNES/SFC only.  Its
call the super disk.  This super disk copier will play all copy
protected games, include RAMA 1/2 II and Final Fantasy V.  No exteranl
power supply needed.  Easy to function and can read all other SNES/SFC
copiers files.  One thing that is bad about this copier is that its own
file can not be use on any other copiers.

Products:	Mega Disk for Genesis/MD.
		Mega Disk for SFC/SNES.
		Save cartridge
		Super Famicom interface
		8M to 16M upgrade
		Super disk intercepter (SNES/SFC only)

Name:	Super Magic Drive, Super Magicom, Super Com Pro (HK)
For:		Super Magic Drive is for Sega Mega Drive or
Genesis only, and Super Magicom is for SFC/SNES.  Each
version can only be used with the designated system.  The
company also makes other versions for NEC PC-Engine.
Description:   SMD works much the same way as the 'Mega Disk',
it also sits on top of the Mega Drive, but has a built in 256K (SRAM)
save cart, and can have unlimited saves by writing it to disk. It
can have a maximum of 16 Megabits of memory.  The main unit is
separated from the disk drive, connected by a cable.  The games
are written in DOS format, so games can be stored into your IBM
hard drive.  If you know how to crack a program, you can
construct your own game like making a super invincible character
or unlimited lives, etc.  The new Super Magic Drive according to
Lawrence Kwan, does not need specially formatted disks.  Also, the
new version of Super Magicom will format it's own disk.  Furthermore,
there is a new version of Super Magicom out in Hong Kong only (this
info is from lawrence.kwan@canrem.com) which is called Super Com
Pro #.  This Super Com is a little bit smaller than SMC and it does not
require specially formatted disks, you can use DOS formatted 720K,
1.44M and 1.6M disks (like the MGH).
Pro & Con:  You have the option to buy an interface for SMD that will
work for the SNES.  Disk drive and the main unit is separated from each
other, and the disk drive needs an external power supply.  Bulky if you
use the interface.  It has a computer port so you can use a parallel cable
to connect it to an IBM computer to modify data. Old Super
Magic Drive needs special disks for back-up.  To make your own
special formatted disk, you need an IBM copy program that will copy
up to track 81 on a HD disk (VGAcopy will do it).  My friend who has
the 16M SMD with the SMC interface reported that it won't save
SFII on disk, maybe a new ROM is needed.  Over all, a pretty good
game copier.
NEW information:
	The super magic drive 16M older version will need a new DOS to
	copy 16M games.  Same thing with the 16M super magicom.  You
	will need to load up the new DOS first and then load the 16M
	games.  Else your 16M copier will not run the 16M games.
	Super magicom is now out of the market.  DO NOT BUY THEM
	ANYMORE.  If you can buy one cheap, that means the person is
	just trying to get rid of there stock.  The second generation of
	Super magicom is out, its call the super wild card.  The super
	wild card has a built in internal disk drive.  It does not need
	a exteranl power supply.  The new opion of this copier, its that
	it has a Golden finger burn in, which it doesn't do anything.
	Bewere of the power problem.  It may frie your game system.  It
	has already happen before.  If you want to plug the Super wild
	card to the computer, you must modify the cable first.  Because
	if you don't it will frie your serial port on the computer.  I
	do not recommend anyone buying this copier.  Its too risky.
	Plus Front Far East (the company makes them) is very unreliable.
	They do not take responsibility on any damage that you may done
	to your machine.

Name:	Super Gun
Use:		Special game console for playing Arcade games.
Description:	A box that has a slot for plugging in the video
arcade game board.  It can use different arcade style joysticks
that either has six buttons or has a special panel for playing
Mahjong type games.  It's basically a home system which plays an
arcade board.  Games costs as much as the arcade game, but you
get the real thing.
Pro & Con:  So you can play arcade games (the real thing), but it's
very expensive (of course, you can argue that it's cheaper than
buying the stand up Arcade and I would agree with you).  What I
mean by expensive is the game board itself, the price of Super Gun
itself is pretty reasonable.  It's all up to you and how rich or additive
you are.  Someone advertised that you can get a Super Gun with SFII
for less than a thousand dollars, but why bother?  SFII on the SNES
is the same thing and it's cheaper, but if you are getting a SFII-CE, then
that's a whole different story (IMHO).

Name:	Multi Game Doctor 2
Use:		Can be used on every system that is available as
long as you buy the correct interface.
Description:	Two piece type.  The main unit includes a disk drive
and is connected to your game system by a cable or stand-along. There
is a special cable with software that you can buy that allows you to
use the MGD2 unit on you IBM.  The main unit has a LCD display.

The SRAM cart uses a lithium battery and it will last 2-6 months
depended on the size of the RAM.  Also, it advertises that MGD2
uses SONY's 1M SRAM, so it's more reliable.  It has interfaces for
Super Famicom, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Game Gear, NEO GEO, PC-
Engine, NEC Super Grafx, and Game Boy.  Also, it might be coming
out with an interface for Lynx (a rumor so far).  The new NEO GEO
interface will use two 32 DRAM pack (I heard it's the size of a
credit card) to load games.  I also assume that you can use an IBM
hard drive to save these huge NEO GEO games; otherwise, you might
need 7 to 8 HD disk to save one game (BTW, this is pretty expensive,
all I can say is you can spend the cost of an IBM computer for the
whole setup).  I just confirmed recently that the DRAM 16M pack
does work for the SNES.  On the SFC interface for MGD2, there is a
power cord that connects to the SFC.  Since the power supply connector
is different between SFC and SNES, this power cord doesn't work for
SNES; however, using the SNES power supply, this Rampack works.
So now with this Rampack, users can save two 8M games or one 16M
game on the single rampck.
P.S.  There are now two different memory cart for MGD2: SRAM
and DRAM.  Here is how they were used.
SRAM (1M, 2M, 4M and 8M) pack:  copy games from disk to SRAM
pack.  SRAM pack will hold games until the battery dies.  Very
portable with different game console interfaces.  Interfaces available
for SNES/SFC, MD/Genesis, PC-Engine, Game Boy and Game Gear.
DRAM (8M, 16M & 32M) pack:  plug into DRAM interface, it hold
the game until you turn off the game console with the interface
plug in.  There are interfaces for SFC, MD/Genesis, PC-Engine & NEO GEO.
Pro & Con:  The most flexible game copier in the market.  It has
the most incredible support from the manufacturer to produce
interfaces for every game systems that is and will be available.
More procedure involved to play a game, but it works perfectly
without a single problem.  More expensive if you only want to use
it for one game system.  However, the more game system you have,
the better the price.  It has the programs and interfaces for linking
into an IBM computer.  It even has a computer board that you can
put into the computer slot that will do the same thing as MGD 2.
A very nice and versatile game copier for the dedicated video game
player.
NEW information:
	The multi game doctor 2 NEO-GEO interface is out, but its also
	out of production.  The interface and the DRAM (Total of 132M)
	will run up to $1300.  Sure, its nice to copy a $200 game, but I
	am not willing to spend $1300 for a stupid interface.  Also, I
	have seen this thing, it takes 4-6 minutes to load up one game.
	That is too long for me to wait.  They lynx interface is just a
	rumor, ignore it.  The new MGD II interface will play all copy
	protect games.  The DRAM is a very nice thing to have.

Name:	Multi Game Hunter
Use:		MD/Genesis AND SNES/Super Famicom
Description:	A game copier that can be used on both
the Genesis/MD and SNES/SFC.  It has a detachable HD disk drive
on the right of the main unit and has slots on the left for the
MD and SFC cartridge.  MGH boots from ROM like the Super Magic
Com/Drive, and it has a graphical menu displayed on TV.  Its disk
format is IBM compatible: 720K, 1.4M and 1.6M.  It has a built in
memory of 16 M.  You can get a memory upgrade up to 24M.
A 256K Save RAM is build in.  One of the special surprise of MGH is
that it can read all MGDII and Super Magic formatted disks.
This gives MGH a big advantage to new buyers, since they can use
competitor's disks.  It could be linked up to an IBM computer for game
modifications, but the cable for doing this is not out yet.
Pro & Con:  MGH needs a SFC/SNES convertor in order to play American
games, it needs an external power supply of 7.8V-10V, 1A. Just one MGH,
(no need for a big interface) you can play games on SNES or Genesis,
it's simple to use and it allows users to copy SAVED game from cart
to it's memory or to disk. Without the need of special formatted disks
it's one of the best game copiers around.  Also, IMO, the MGH is better
constructed than SMC.  The new NEO GEO interface that they
are working on will use the Genesis cart slot.  There will be two lines
coming out from the interface, one goes to a DRAM of at least 45M and
the other line will connect to the NEO GEO itself.  Price unknown for this
interface.  When using the MGH on the Genesis, there are more options
to choose from, but many of the options (like toolbox) are not available
yet.   However, it still does all the things you basically need.
Company:  The maker of MGH.is Venus Computer Co. Ltd.  But it's
being distributed/co-developed with Makko Toys Co. the MGDII
maker.
NEW information:
	MGH NEO-GEO interface is not in production.  Cost too much and
	the market is too small.  MGH now has a new interface to allow
	people to play copy protected games.  The interface will only
	work on copy protected games only.  If you want to run some old
	games, you must put the old interface back on.  The MGH golden
	finger will increase your DOS version upto 2.0, but that is all.
	It will not allow you to copy mario kart or pilot wing.  There
	is a lot of bad copy of Golden finger out there, if you install
	yours and it doesn't work.  Then hold L & down on your control
	pad to eerase the golded finger.  The real time save care is
	also avaible now.

Product:  Multi-Game Hunter

NEW copiers:
Doctor SF (Game boxer) 16M, SNES/SFC only

The best single copier on the market now.  It has all the function a
play need.  The real time save feture is a big plus.  A cheap and
reliable copier.  Will need a exteranl power supply.  The disk drive is
built in.  Usese DRAM, that means if you load the game up once, you can
keep the game in the copier as long as you want.  The real time save
allows you to save right at that spot and recall it later any time you
want.  Golden finger also included.   Slow motion.  And it will show the
name of the game in English after load up.  A neat little copier.
Can be upgrade to 32M, that means you can keep 4 8M games at once and
choese to play anyone of them as you wish.
Maker: MAKKO Co.



=========================
Frequent asked questions:
=========================
Where are these game copiers made?
	All of these devices are made from either Hong Kong or
Taiwan.  And most likely, they are the only place that you can get
these devices.  If you have friends going to Asia, maybe you can
ask them to got one for you.  These copiers are sold at many video
game stores in Taiwan and Hong Kong.  Except now Taiwan is enforcing
the 301 Copyright law, many video game stores stopped selling these
copiers, you might have to look pretty hard to find what you want.
Also, SMC/SMD is under investigation in UK, it's harder to export
them now.

Which copier is more popular?
	This question is very important.  If these copiers are
popular, buyers are more likely to get support from the
manufacturers in the future.  A few years back, Game Doctor is
very popular.  Now with all the new devices out, Super
Magicom/Super MagicDrive are popular, following by Mega
Disk due to its simplest operation.  Of course, MGD2 is still
popular because it can be used with all the game systems that is
and will be available.  As long you are playing the MGDII with more
than one game system, the high price is off set by how many
game systems that you own.  Finally, with the introduction of MGH,
it is taking a large share of the market away from the other copiers
(especially the market of Super Magicom/Super Magic Drive).  Starting
this month, September, Nintendo is helping the UK coustoms cracking
down SMC/SMD imports into the United Kingdom, if all the operation
is successful (meaning Nintendo gets to go to court with sellers), they
might expand it to Canada and U.S.

Can these game copiers copy 16 M games or CD games?
	Well, these game copiers CANNOT copy CD games due to the
large amount of audio/video info on them.  However, 16 meg
games like SF II for SNES can be copied as long as you have the
memory upgrade on the copier you own.  Currently, Mega Disk,
Super Magicom/Super MagicDrive, MGD2 all have the option to do
so.  MGH is equipped with 16M.  BTW, just to remind the readers
that copying copyrighted work is illegal anywhere in this world.

How much do these copiers cost?
	If you want prices, please email me. If the price you find
are higher than the prices I found, you are being rip-off.  And of
course you will find a cheaper price if you look very hard
or get a friend to buy them for you directly from Taiwan or Hong
Kong.  Remember, it would cost you about US$1000 to fly round trip
to these two countries.

Where can I buy these copiers?
	There might be game stores that sell these devices in
New York or LA, but in the Usenet world there are some people
who are willing to help people get stuff from Hong Kong or Taiwan.
I know a dealer who can get stuff for people directly from Taiwan
After receiving your payment, it will take less than 1 week to mail
stuff to you depends on availability.  If you want more information,
please email me.

DSP chip, SFX chip???????
	The DSP chip is in the mario kart and pilot wing.  And these two
	game are not that populer in the overseas.  So the companys are
	not even thinking about hacking it.  The SFX chip is not even
	out yet, people should stop whining about it.  Because there is
	no information about the SFX chip will affect the copiers.  It
	took the company 2 days to hack RAMA 1/2 II and Final Fantasy V,
	how hard could it be to hack others.  I think people is just
	worry about it toooooooooo much.  Your dealers should stand
	behind there product 100%, they should help you to upgrade or
	answer any question you have.  If they are not, you are risking
	your own money.

SFC is Super Famicom, the Japanese SNES.
MD is Mega Drive, the Japanese Genesis.

=======================END OF FILE=====================
	
	Well, that's all I have for now.  I know these devices might not
be legal in the United States, but I think people has the right to
know about them.  I  buy cartridge game that I think the
game play, game quality and the over-all package are excellent,
for example, the Japanese version of Sonic.  I rent games to see if the
games are worth my money (Fantasia is so bad, I am still angry), and
some of them I just want to keep forever.  I won't trust the unreliable
media of floppy disks.  I think the above information is all you
need to know about these devices, but if I miss anything that you
want to know, email me.  I will get back to you ASAP.

This is a first really protected cart. There is the DSP chip, like
in Pilotwings, but that could be worked around by plugging a pilotwings
cart on the top of the Magicom/MGH. There is also another protection:
ROM is differently configured than in ANY other SNES game - usually
the game ROM is in blocks (32K empty, 32K rom) but this is in 64K rom,
64K rom, 64K rom etc.etc... and no known copier can copy this kind
of game. There is also a little code protection - It just verifies
that you have 4K of battery backed ram(as in the orig.cart) and not
32K as in all copier systems. This can be hacked away.

Conclusion:You can't copy Mario Kart on current copiers. It might
be possible if copier manufacturers make an update to their systems
to allow you to copy this game, but I doubt that this happens until
there is multiple carts with similar 'copy protection'
