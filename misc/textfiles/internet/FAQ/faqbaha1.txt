INTRODUCTORY BOOKS
==================
 
Titles within this section are arranged alphabetically.
 
 
All Things Made New
John Ferraby
Baha'i Publishing Trust (United Kingdom), 338 pp
ISBN 0-900125-24-1
 
Offers the reader a comprehensive introduction to the Baha'i Faith.
The author's inclusion of many quotations from the Baha'i sacred
Writings complements an overview of the Faith as complete as to be
found anywhere.  Its first section, "The Teachings of the Faith,"
discusses the oneness of God and of religion, the oneness of mankind,
social and economic teachings, personal conduct, science and the
knowledge of God, the relation of the Baha'i Faith to other religions.
Part Two concerns the Central Figures of the Faith; and Part Three,
"The Baha'i Community," looks at the Covenant of Baha'u'llah, the
Baha'i Administrative Order and laws, obligations and teaching the
Faith.
 
 
The Baha'i Faith
Mary Perkins
Baha'i Publishing Trust (United Kingdom), 96pp
ISBN 0-7062-39393
 
A short, basic introduction to the Baha'i Faith, covering the history,
teachings and way of life of the Baha'i community.  One of the most
popular, easy to read introductions to the Baha'i Faith.  Fully
illustrated.
 
 
The Baha'i Faith: The Emerging Global Religion
William S. Hatcher & J. Douglas Martin
Harper & Row, 248 pp
ISBN 0-06065-441-4 (cloth)
ISBN 0-06312-078-X (paper)
 
As the publishers describe it, "Here is the first definitive
introduction -- sure to become a standard reference work -- of the
history, teaching, administrative structure and community life of the
Baha'i Faith, the youngest and one of the fastest growing of the
world's independent religions."  Martin, an historian, and Hatcher, a
professor of mathematics, have produced a survey of the Baha'i Faith
especially strong in its examination of the turbulent early history of
the Faith and its relationship to Islam.  The authors stress the
pivotal concept of the Baha'i Faith: the oneness of the human race and
an emerging global order.  As well, they examine a wide range of
Baha'i teachings, such as the oneness and progressive character of
religion, the unity of science and religion, the equality of woman and
man, economic justice, the spiritual foundation of life, the
institutions of the Baha'i Faith and disciplines for daily living.
 
 
Baha'u'llah and the New Era
John Esslemont
Baha'i Publishing Trust (United Kingdom), 318pp
ISBN 0-87743-160-4
 
The best known introductory book, translated into 30 languages, and in
continuous print since 1923.  Written by a distinguished early British
Baha'i, this book presents a thorough outline of the history,
principal figures, spiritual and social teachings, and administrative
organization of the Faith.  An especially interesting section examines
the relationship of Baha'u'llah to the expectations and prophecies,
such as the coming of the Kingdom of God in Christianity, that are to
be found in all faiths.
 
 
The Earth is But One Country
John Huddleston
Baha'i Publishing Trust (United Kingdom), 320pp
ISBN 0-900125-91-8
 
"Many, concerned about the condition of society and about the sense of
unfulfillment in their personal lives," says the author,
"automatically assume that they will not find an answer in religion.
Past experience has left a negative impression of superstition and
escapism.  This Book is primarily addressed to those who have this
point of view."  It presents the needs of humanity today, emphasizing
the practical means for building a new civilization where all peoples
can live together in justice, harmony, and peace.
 
 
The Imperishable Dominion
Udo Schaefer
George Ronald Publisher, 320pp
ISBN 0-85398-142-6
 
An analysis of modern thought since the 1700's showing how it has
contributed to society's current crises, and presenting the Baha'i
answers to today's dilemmas.
 
 
Preparing for a Baha'i/Christian Dialogue:  Understanding Biblical Evidence
Michael Sours
Oneworld Publications Ltd
Vol 1  ISBN 1-85168-018-7
Vol 2  ISBN 1-85168-032-2
 
A multi-volume study program designed to help Baha'is familiarize
themselves with the Bible and Christian theology.  Well written and
not cumbersome.  Among the features one finds practical advice on how
to study the Bible; methods of interpreting the Bible; answers to the
most common Christian questions concerning proofs and progressive
revelation; and answers to Christian questions about Baha'i teachings,
the Bible, and Christ.
 
 
The Prophecies of Jesus
Michael Sours
Oneworld Publications Ltd, 223pp
ISBN 1-85168-025-X
 
In the nineteenth century, many Christians throughout the Western
world expected the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecies.  Some even
ventured to conclude from the Scriptures that Jesus would return in
1844.  This widespread expectation is well known to historians and
culminated in what has been referred to as 'the Great Disappointment.'
Yet in the very same year, a dynamic religious movement swept across
Persia which heralded the advent and swift emergence of the Baha'i
Faith, the only religion born during that time to become a global
faith.  Its founder, Baha'u'llah, claimed to be no less than the
fulfillment of the very biblical prophecies that had so inspired the
hopes of the Christian adventists.  _Prophecies of Jesus_ offers a
thoughtful, verse by verse exploration of Jesus's greatest prophetic
sermon in the light of Baha'u'llah's extraordinary ministry and
teachings and of nineteenth century Christian beliefs and current
Christian interpretations.
 
Briefly, the book is almost 500 pages in length, and goes into great
detail about Biblical prophecies--especially time prophecies--and their
fulfillment by the Baha'i Faith (it's sort of a _Thief in the Night_,
revised and greatly expanded.  It contains numerous citations--many of
them quoting Christian scholars and authorities--, and is completely
footnoted. 


I Shall Come Again
Hudishar Motlagh
Global Perspective, ~500pp
ISBN 0-937661-00-7 (cloth); 0-937661-01-5 (paper)

Briefly, this book goes into great detail about Biblical prophecies --
especially time prophecies -- and their fulfillment by the Baha'i Faith.
It contains numerous citations -- many of them quoting Christian scholars 
and authorities.  It is the first in a (projected) 5 volume series.

Examination of religion as the creative force behind the rise and
reformation of civilization.
 
 
To a Seeker
Nathan Rutstein
George Ronald Publisher, 121pp
ISBN 0-85398-239-2
 
The need for spiritual development as a pathway to happiness is
frequently overlooked.  The author describes how the Baha'i Faith can
show us the way to that elusive happiness.  A dramatic vision of the
future, and the steps now being taken by Baha'is to attain it, is
offered to the seeker who searches for a "new day."
 
 
A Thief in the Night: The Case of the Missing Millennium
William Sears
George Ronald, Publisher, 304pp
ISBN 85398-008-X
 
The author describes how, having once discovered a problem -- the
belief among many Christians of that time that Christ's return would
take place in the 1840's -- he set out to unearth the clues leading to
its solution.  The Baha'i Faith is presented as that solution.
