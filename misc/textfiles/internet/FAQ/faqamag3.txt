VI-A. MAGAZINES ON MAGIC

The following list of magic magazines is from contributions from the
following people:
    barnett@grymoire.crd.ge.com (Bruce Barnett)
    nielsen@eecs.umich.edu  (Paul Nielsen)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	General Magic

Genii
PO Box 36068
Los Angeles, CA 90036
$30 a year for 12 issues.

Color cover, 80 pages an issue. The largest circulation of any magazine.
Everyone should get this just for the ads, as most items are advertized
here.  Some columns are useless. I currently enjoy "The Giorgio Letters"
which describes how the Erdnase book is a lot of bull. I also enjoy the T.
A. Waters book reviews and Harkey's column.

MAGIC - an Independent Magazine for Magicians. 
Circulation Department
13337 E. South St. #310
Cerritos, CA 90701

$30 a year/ 12 issues.

Similar to Genii (actually - they are competitors) Color cover and color
inside. Columns by Paul Gertner (performance tips), Richard Kaufman (editor
of the magic section), and reviews by Mike Weber.

In my (st922964@pip.cc.brandeis) opinion, is certainly the BEST magic
magazine out there.  It is where I learn about 90% of my magic news and
features very interesting articles by the likes of Stan Allen and Michael
Caveney.

VI-B. VIDEOS ON MAGIC

The following is a list of video tapes on magic.  The intent is to list
tapes which instruct rather than tapes of magic performances.  If you are
interested in the later, Jeff Isozaki (jti01@duts.ccc.amdahl.com) posts a
monthly list of "Magic in Movies" indicating movies, actors, and scenes in
which magic appears.

    nigel@ietech.demon.co.uk ("Nigel G. Backhurst")
    
Advanced Card Work - all of the Tannen's Stars of Magic-Paul Harris series.
  Paul is good, funny, and weird.  The tapes are extremely well done, and
  the selection of magic is commercial (i.e. not just finger flinging to
  impress other magicians, its finger flinging to impress _everybody_!)
  Definitely not for beginners!

Animation and Levitation - Kevin James' Floating Rose
  This tape is phenomenal!  You might never do the floating rose, but you
  learn everything you need to do levitiation and animation (close up and
  stage).  It is difficult, but Kevin takes you step by step and leaves
  nothing out.

Basic Card and Coin Sleights - Brad Burt series
  Brad is the best teacher of effects around. He has beginners' tapes on
  cards, coins, flourishes and sponge balls. They are self-produced so they
  are more reasonably priced than Tannen tapes. Brad "guarantees" you can
  learn the stuff from the tapes. I don't know if that means refunding the
  price of the tape if you can't, but it seems worth a try. For more info,
  call (619) 571-4749, Fax: (619) 571-7943.
From Jay Malone (malone@crash.cts.com)

I know Brad and I 
have four of his videos (both coin videos, the sponge and the chop cup).
Brad has been teaching many years and was, until he opened his shop, an 
active performer.
He studies each effect that he sells and I feel that his "rating system" 
is fair.  I've never been disapointed in my dealings with him.  


Basic Card Slights - Bill Tarr
  90min tape packed with, as Bill Tarr says, "everything you need to know
  to be a dynamite card magician." The video has fairly poor production
  quality, and the backdrop is quite confusing.  This aside, the
  instruction is excellent;  Bill Tarr is a very good teacher.  The topics
  include: The Slip Shuffle, Jog Shuffle, Hindu Shuffle, Slip Cut, False
  Triple Cut, Double Cut Classic Pass, Invisible Pass, Say When Pass,
  Classic Force, Riffle Force, Top- Palm, Double Lift, Top Change, Glide,
  Buckle, Elmsley Count, Card Weaving, and Key Cards.  It includes good
  bits of card business and a few good card tricks.  Recommend to any
  beginning magician as a good way to start with almost all basic card
  slights.  Also pretty good for those more experienced that need to work
  on old skills.

Brad Burt Video Tapes - Brad Burt series
  Are excellent for instructional purposes.  They are not fancy studio
  productions but are easy to follow. One includes the Zarrow shuffle and
  appears excellent. The tapes are advertised in Genii from Brad Burt's
  Magic Shop in San Diego.

Card Manipulation and Flourishes
  "Card Flourishes" - Lou Lancaster
  "The Major Card Flourishes" - Brad Burt
  "Fedko - Card Illusions" - John Fedko
  "Card and Ball Manipulation" - Peki
  "Steven's Vol 3" - Shimada

Chop Cup, The - Brad Burt
  Everything to do the Chop cup, complete with the double large load
  endings standing up and surrounded.

Eugene Goes Bizarre - Eugene Burger - STEVEN'S VOL 4"
  I'm very impressed with Burger's Videos. The number of tricks is pretty
  low but the production values are the highest I've seen in any of the 8
  videos I own. I do a modified version of his "Retribution" (aka the
  burned card) and just left people with jaws on the floor.  His Gypsy
  thread routine in "..Bizzare" is REALLY nice. I have several of his books
  and attended a small seminar that he gave in St. Paul last year. A
  thoroughly enjoyable person, he really puts a lot of work into his
  routines, books and videos.

Gambling Protection Series - Steve Forte
  Mail order from RGE - 414 Santa Clara Av; Oakland, CA 94610
      Phone: (510)465-6452; Fax:(510)652-4330 Mail:
      RGE is a publisher and distributor of gambling related literature,
      software and videos. (Visa and MC only for phone orders)
  Tape #1: EXCELLENT examples of the pass. These videos are NOT DESIGNED
      FOR MAGICIANS OR THE GENERAL PUBLIC. They target pro gamblers and
      expose gambling sleights from many angles and in slow motion, etc.
      Forte's execution of the two handed pass is flawless. Steve makes a
      living doing "cheating at gambling" demos, writing, etc. HE USED TO
      BE A FULL TIME CASINO DEALER. He also discusses stacking decks, etc.
      A great video.

Greatest Hits - Randy Wakeman
  C&S Enterprises - 1116 Brookview - Brentwood, TN  USA    37027
  90 minutes.  13 effects all taught. All Card routines.
  Great quality, post production editing by pro magician (Jim Suprise).
  Three good routines are Overclock, Card under glass, and Spectator on
  stage. I have included Spectator on stage in my own performance it is a
  great ace cutting effect. Harry Loryane Linking Ring "Fine Selections,
  fine quality, fine teaching tape"

David Harkey Lecture - David Harkey
  Top notch! His routines are simple, visual, and strong. It requires
  some good misdirection, but its not overly finger flinging. Here are
  some of the routines he performed:
  1- He takes out a clean purse filled with black balloons. He blows one
     up and pulls off the round part. It becomes a billiard ball.
  2- He took a glass marble (it's like, man, a new age crystal, you know)
     and softened it with a lighter. He then held it to his lips and blew
     into it. It expanded from his mouth like a balloon and you realize
     it's a test tube. He fills the tube with sugar from a packet, and
     then turns the tube into an hour glass - filled with sugar. He uses
     this hour glass to turn time back to the beginning, where the tube
     becomes a marble and the sugar is back in the unopened packet.
     (PERFORMANCE ONLY)
  3- "No Return" - A safety pin is placed in a business card, and the
      hole is dragged around. (steel pin = $12)
  4-  A bill and pencil are borrowed. the pencil penetrates the middle
      of the bill, which remains untorn.
  5-  Four coins are visibly produced and appear at the ends of his
      fingers as he touched the table.
  6-  A ring penetrates his ring finger visibly. A spectator can place
      her hand on his and FEEL the ring travel up and thru his finger.
  7-  4 coins travel into a glass - You can visibly see the coins arrive
      in the glass.
  Most (all) of the material is in his book. His lecture consists of 10
  items. His book has 60 items. All of the material is similar in
  style/strength. He is very innovative. His routines have been used to
  win awards. He spent "10 years of his life" working on this book and
  it shows. He is a nice guy and quite funny. He is easy to talk to and
  not egotistical. He has a knack of ribbing people in the audience w/out
  insulting them. This is a rare talent. Strongly recommend the lecture
  and the book.

Illusion Video, The
  A cheaply made, cheaply bought video teaching you how to make and
  perform some standard stage illusions.  Included are producing an
  assistant, a dove production and vanish, various producing tubes and
  boxes, and the flying carpet levitation (you could use an audience
  member for this one without tipping the method).

Impossibilia - The John Bannon Video.
  It demonstrates and explains 13 tricks, and it runs 90 minutes. It's
  excellent.

Linking Rings -  Here is a partial list of tapes with instructions on the
  linking rings:
  1) Fedko - John Fedko has a series of 6 tapes numbered 1 thru 6. One
     of the tapes has linking rings as well as other platform effects. I
     believe the linking rings are on the "Classic Magic" volume.
  2) Marc DeSousa - "Prize Winning Magic"
  3) Richard Ross - Stevens' "Greater Magic" series
     The most beautiful version of rings I have ever seen.  I watched it
     many times and was always impressed.  He's great.

Negotiating Higher Performance Fees audio tape - Michael Ammar
  Recommended regarding fees earned by magicians.

On the Pass - Richard Kaufman
  I just bought the video "On the Pass" by Richard Kaufman last weekend. It
  is a good presentation of the classic pass, riffle pass and Herrmann pass
  along with several variations and tricks based on them.  He first
  demonstrates the pass as the spectator would see it. Then carefully shows
  finger positions and moves very slowly. This is shown from the
  performer's point of view.  Then he speeds things up.  Awesome!
 
  My first time through the tape, I just sat there with my mouth hanging
  open. Do I ever have a lot of practicing to do.  One comment he makes
  near the end of the 40 minute video is, "Practice the classic pass 100
  times a day for a year and you'll really have something special."

Penn and Teller -
1: Cruel Tricks for Dear Friends, The video version of their book of the
    same name.  The Tricks are different than those in the book.  You 
    actually use portions of the video to play the pranks. Hilarious.
2: Penn and Teller Go Public: A 30 minute video which I believe was
    originally a PBS special.  They do some of their classic bits like
    the handstab and Teller's Straight-jacket escape. A mini-concert if
    you will.
3: Penn and Teller Get Killed:  An actual movie about Penn and Teller.
    Penn and Teller guest star on a talk show.  Penn mentions how 
    exciting he thinks life would be if someone were trying to kill him.
    You guessed it.  Someone takes him seriously!!  Some good magic and
    lots of humor.

Restaurant Magic Business - Charles Green
  Tape that is VERY helpful for the restaurant performer.

Routine Closeup - John Mendoza's
  C&S Enterprises - 1116 Brookview - Brentwood, TN  USA    37027
  1 hr 40 min tape. Mendoza performs 10 effects and teaches 6 of them.
  Great quality, post production editing by pro magician (Jim Suprise).
  Particularly well explained are Mendoza's Cups and Balls and Dice
  Stacking. The Dice stacking are done in slow motion with a clear glass.
  Phil Willmarth in Linking Ring said, ".. it is far and away the finest
  instructional video I have ever seen"

Simply Magic - Bill Thompson - from The House of Secrets,
  12 Caunce Street, Blackpool tel 0253 20902

Thumb Tips - Patrick Page - from the Trik-A-Tape Company,
  45-47 Clerkenwell Road, London, EC1M 5RS tel 71 253 9693
  Having watched perhaps a dozen instructional VHS tapes on magic, this one
  has to be my favorite.  It gives an incredible amount of detail for the
  endless variety of tricks you can do using a thumb tip.  I see beginners
  frequently posting inquiries about how to get started in magic.  Buying a
  copy of this tape is my advice. 

Topit Secrets - Patrick Page - from the Trik-A-Tape Company,
  45-47 Clerkenwell Road, London, EC1M 5RS tel 71 253 9693

Zarrow Shuffle, The - Brad Burt
  This man has to be one of the best teachers I've ever seen. Here, he
  teaches both the Zarrow and Faro shuffles as well as tricks. The
  Zarrow is the best looking table false shuffle I've ever seen. Unless
  you are specifically looking for it, you can't tell the difference
  between a Zarrow shuffle and a tabled riffle shuffle - even then you
  might not do it.
