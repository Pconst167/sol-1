Abbotts Magic Company
(Catalog is pretty good.  Definitely of the thick variety. (about 500 large
pages)  It's got a heck of a lot of stuff in just about every area.  The
pricing seems fair to good, but probably not excellent in terms of good
deals.)

Collector's Workshop
(Most all of their stuff is very expensive, catalog is $5.00.  For folks
who don't know, CW is one of the few shops to take a less draconian stance
on returns. Ever since a shop refused to accept a strait-jacket after the
T-bar tore out the first time I tried it on, despite a history of business
with them and full knowledge of the methods before I got the jacket, I've
started to appreciate CW's policy more and more.)

Four Jokers Magic Shop
(Visa/Mastercard orders accepted)
(There are larger stores, but its hard to beat these guys.  If they know
you are a magician and are interested in a trick they will let you in on
the secret.  After all, to be honest, if you are in the comunity (magic)
you are bound to eventually find someone who has purchased the same thing
and will eventually find out the inner workings.  BUT, you might see
something that just blows your socks off, go and buy it THEN find out it is
beyond your abilities.  At least this way, you have the chance to 'test
drive' it to see if it is something you really want.)

House of Magic, The
(Carries both old and new stuff, and specializes in antiques, imported, and
limited edition stuff.  The primary drawback with this place is that it's
full of rubber doggy-do, inflatable women, rubber snakes, etc., and seeing
into the over-stuffed counters is sometimes tough.  You have to become sort
of known face to get the most value out of this store.  It does have the
largest local book section.)

Jeff Busby
(Carries mostly books, but also carrys some magic equipment.  He uses a
tremendous amount of hyperbola in his advertising, and makes it sound like
he's the only guy who carrys the stuff that he carrys, which isn't true.
But he does make unexcelled machined and spun copper, brass, and stainless
steel cups for cups and balls (I'm not sure if he's doing this right now),
and he also has some beautiful turned wood wands & cups.)
