<4.2> What kind of rules should the server operator maintain?

  Karl Kleinpaste <anonymus+0@charcoal.com>:

  > 7. Thou shalt not cause the anonymous server to come under fire.

<4.3> Should the anonymous server operator maintain high `visibility'?

<4.4> Should the anonymous server operator ever reveal identities?

  Brad Templeton <brad@clarinet.com>:

  Dave Kirsch <zoid@deep.rsoft.bc.ca>:
