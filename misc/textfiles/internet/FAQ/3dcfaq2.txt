B03) Evans & Sutherland Freedom

PRESS RELEASE:

"EVANS & SUTHERLAND BRINGS 3D GRAPHICS EXPERTISE
 TO THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

SALT LAKE CITY, March 2, 1995
Evans & Sutherland Computer Corporation (NASDAQ: ESCC) today announced
Freedom Graphics(tm) for the Personal Computer.  Freedom Graphics is
the first product to bring the 3D graphics technology of E&S to the
personal computing environment.

Freedom Graphics is an implementation of the specialized features that
3D graphics applications require for smooth, fast execution.  Users
can produce impressive realistic images with the product's rich
feature set and high-performance graphics for Windows/NT(r)
applications.

The graphics card supports the OpenGL(r) software application
programming interface and is designed to accelerate OpenGL in the PC
environment.  Freedom Graphics is a PCI bus-based card that
incorporates the same technology as the Freedom Series graphics
accelerators which supply high-end graphics for the world's largest
workstation vendors.  Ideal markets to take advantage of the extensive
feature set of Freedom Graphics are CAD, Industrial Design,
Simulation, Visualization, Animation, Entertainment and Game
Development.  Supported PC processors include MIPS(tm), Pentium(r) and
Power PC(tm).

"The interest being generated by Freedom Graphics is extraordinary,"
said Jim Oyler, President and CEO of Evans & Sutherland.  "Freedom
Graphics allows a low-cost PC-based system to achieve the performance
of a much more expensive workstation.  This is going to be an
explosive market in the very near future."

Evans & Sutherland is the only 3D graphics vendor with a product line
that spans the entire computing industry from the personal computer up
to multi-million dollar flight simulators and location-based
entertainment systems.

"We are pleased that Evans & Sutherland has applied their knowledge
and experience in high-performance real-time 3D graphics to the PC
marketplace," said Tom Coull, President of Sense8 Corporation.
"WorldToolKit and Freedom Graphics will offer a definitive
hardware-accelerated solution for texture-mapped virtual reality
applications."

Freedom Graphics' feature set includes real-time 3D graphics rendering
and animation, hardware based 24-bit texture acceleration, scalable
texture memory up to 16 MBytes, bi-linear and tri-linear MIP-mapping,
specular highlights, fast set-up calculations, full scene
antialiasing, transparency and depth cueing.  The additional
experience of E&S with OpenGL will also result in significant
performance advantages for applications using the OpenGL library from
E&S.

According to Ian Reid, Vice-President of Marketing at Advanced Visual
Systems, "Freedom Graphics offers a new level of capability for the PC
user and AVS/Express allows any PC developer to take immediate
advantage of features such as hardware texture-mapping and
transparency.  It's the ideal combination."

Freedom Graphics performance under Windows/NT and OpenGL is 300,000
triangles/second.  The card will list price at $2450 with second
quarter availability through OEMs and VARs.  Freedom Graphics was
first shown at Fall Comdex '94 in Las Vegas.

The significance of Freedom Graphics lies in its delivery of a
graphics feature set at unsurpassed performance levels.  Advanced
features such as texture mapping are still unavailable from any other
vendor for under $10,000.  Freedom Graphics also provides performance
not yet seen in the 3D PC graphics market.  Nearest competitors for
performance provide minimal feature sets and are only available at
much higher prices.

Evans & Sutherland is a leader in advanced 3D graphics and
visualization systems for science, industry, education, and
entertainment.  The Graphics Systems Division provides graphics
hardware and software solutions that are sold and supported by DEC,
HP, IBM, and Sun Microsystems.  Evans & Sutherland was founded in 1968
and is based in Salt Lake City, Utah.

COMMENT:
From Chris Hinch (chris@dcc.govt.nz):

"I heard comments on comp.sys.opengl that, at the moment, the
Impression Plus doesn't have "true" OpenGL support under Windows NT.
I don't know if this is correct or not."

From Blair MacIntyre:

This is partially true.  Someone from Microsoft posted saying that NT
3.51 will include the appropriate driver for OpenGL for this card.

B05) Oki TrianGL

More information on Oki and their products can be found on their web
page (www.oki.com) or by sending email to triangl@oki.com.

The information here was extracted from the page
	http://www.oki.com/products/TrianGL.html

Oki's TrianGL is aimed at 3D applications using the OpenGL graphics API. 

At the heart of the TrianGL is a custom, high-performance rendering
ASIC--a drawing engine which provides both 2D and 3D acceleration. The
chip interfaces directly to multiple banks of video RAM via a
80-bit data bus, boosting overall drawing performance.

The four banks of VRAM, 10 MBytes in all, each operate independently
to maximize the performance efficiency of the rendering ASIC. For many
drawing primitives, all the banks can operate in parallel.  However,
for certain primitives, such as vector drawing or triangle drawing,
address and color values are sent from the ASIC to the appropriate
memory banks in a pipelined, serial fashion. TrianGL's use of triangle
drawing primitives gives the board a major performance advantage over
other products which use simpler span primitives.

Two separate RGB buffers allow true hardware double buffering for
smooth, artifact-free animation. An independent 24-bit Z buffer is
dedicated for hidden surface removal during 3D object rendering. And
finally, eight utility planes support board-specific video options
such as overlays, window types and RGB double buffering. In order to
support VGA compatibility, a VESA standard VGA passthrough interface
is included on the board.

Accelerated Drawing Operations

        Solid Rectangle Fill - 266 M pixels/second 
        Pattern Rectangle Fill - 66 M pixels/second (8-bit), 
		33 M pixels/second (24-bit)

====================================================================
B06) Intergraph GLZ Series 

The GLZ series accelerates OpenGL[tm] graphics on Intergraph Computer
Systems' TDZ workstations. GLZs let you manipulate Gouraud-shaded 3D
models by adding realistic effects such as lighting, translucency, and
textured surfaces; and performing spectacular flythroughs,
walkthroughs, and animations -- all in real time, at high resolutions,
and in true color.

By performing shading and geometry operations in dedicated hardware,
GLZs ease the load on the TDZ's Pentium[tm] processor(s) and cut down
traffic on the PCI bus, which results in dramatic improvements in
graphics performance.

The GLZ family supports Intergraph's 17- and 21-inch multi-sync
monitors and 21- and 27-inch InterVue monitors at resolutions up to
1,600 x 1,280 pixels. The GLZs support dual screens and are ready for
stereoscopic display on any stereo-ready monitor. (LCD shutter glasses
and emitter modules are required and are available from Intergraph
Computer Systems.)

The GLZ family offers a selection of 34, 24, or 12 megabytes of
VRAM. 24 megabytes of VRAM supports resolutions up to 1,600 x 1,280
with 16.8 million colors (true color).  12 megabytes of VRAM suppots
true color at a maximum resolution of 1,152 x 854.  34 megabytes of
VRAM supports a 32-bit Z buffer, double-buffered true color, and
display capabilities such as translucency and overlay at resolutions
up to 1,600 x 1,280.

Intergraph Computer Systems offers six different GLZ
configurations. 

GLZ6 -- photorealism in real time
---------------------------------

The top of our 3D graphics accelerator line -- offers shading
acceleration, geometry acceleration, and texture-processing for fast,
real-time rendering of complex and detailed designs.

Product highlights

	o 34 MB of high-speed VRAM for 126 bit planes of video memory at 
	  all display resolutions, providing: 
	  - 24-bit, double-buffered image planes 
	  - 32-bit Z buffer
	  - 8-bit, double-buffered overlay 
	  - 8-bit alpha buffer
	  - Other planes for additional features and further acceleration 
	o Texture processing fully supported in hardware with 8
	  megatextels of texture memory (32 MB of DRAM) for full
	  trilinear interpolation of mip-mapped images
	o Geometry acceleration to speed up lighting and transforms 
	o Support for the OpenGL industry-standard graphics library 
	o Full hardware support for Gouraud and flat shading of 3D
	  triangle meshes  
	o Anti-aliased vector support to eliminate anomalies of
	  standard raster displays  
	o Industry-standard PCI bus interface with high-speed DMA engine 
	o Genlock support for dual screens, eliminating the visual
	  beat frequency effect that can occur when two monitors are
	  placed close together  
	o Support for Intergraph Computer Systems' 21- and 27-inch
	  InterVue monitors and 17- and 21-inch multi-sync monitors 
	o Stereo-ready display for 3D viewing, which enhances
	  cartographic applications and design visualization 
	o Multiple video resolution support for resolutions ranging
	  from 640 x 480 pixels to 1,600 x 1,280 pixels 
	o Eight hardware color tables, allowing multiple windows to
	  simultaneously display using independent color palettes
	o 10-bit gamma correction using state-of-the-art, 10-bit
	  digital-to-analog converters, enabling user control of gamma
	  values with no loss of color resolution  

GLZ5 -- cost-effective photorealism
-----------------------------------

Our GLZ5 offers the same high-performance shading and geometry
acceleration as does GLZ6. With 12 MB of VRAM, GLZ5 supports
resolutions up to 1,152 x 864. Two megatexels (8 megabytes of texture
memory) provide more than enough texture storage for adding patterns
to furniture, waves to water, or trees to parks and forests.

GLZ5's low price may even tempt you to invest in dual screens and LCD
shutter glasses for a stereoscopic adventure into virtual reality!

Product highlights (same as the GLZ6, except where noted)

	o 12 MB of high-speed VRAM for 92 bit planes of video memory at  
	  resolutions up to 1,152 x 864, providing: 
	  - 24-bit, double-buffered image planes 
	  - 24-bit Z buffer
	  - 1-bit, double-buffered overlay 
	  - Other planes for additional features and further acceleration 
	o Texture processing fully supported in hardware with 2
	  megatextels of texture memory (8 MB of DRAM) for full
	  trilinear interpolation of mip-mapped images
	o Support for Intergraph Computer Systems' 17- and 21-inch
	  multi-sync monitors  
	o Multiple video resolution support for resolutions ranging
	  from 640 x 480 pixels to 1,152 x 864

GLZ4 and GLZ3 -- accelerated geometry and shading
-------------------------------------------------

GLZ4 and GLZ3 support both shading and geometry acceleration.  If you
need fast, accurate rendering of complex solid models but don't
normally require realtime texture processing for photorealism, GLZ4
(24 MB of VRAM) or GLZ3 (12 MB of VRAM) will give you performance that
more than meets your expectations. Don't worry if you occasionally
need to render a textured image. Thanks to OpenGL, texture processing
is fully supported in software.
