<3.1> What is the value or use of anonymity?
<3.2> Does anonymity uphold or violate the Usenet status quo?
<3.3> Is anonymity conducive or neutral to `abuse'?
<3.4> Does anonymity require courage or cowardice?
<3.5> Is anonymity associated with free speech?
<3.6> Should anonymous postings be censored?
<3.7> Can restrictions on anonymity be enforced? (How?)

<3.1> What is the value or use of anonymity?

  Bill Bohrer <bohrer@maui.mcc.com>:

  Evan Leibovitch <evan@telly.on.ca>:

<3.8> What are the effects of anonymity?


  <an8729@anon.penet.fi>:
  
  > Since I began posting anonymously (to show support for general
  > principles of personal privacy) I have been subject to far more
  > abuse and attack than I ever received before. People seem to
  > find it easier to flame and insult someone whose name they don't
  > know. Perhaps it's easier to pretend that there is no person
  > behind the email address who feels the sting of abusive comments.

  Tarl Neustaedter <tarl@sw.stratus.com>:
  
  > Anonimity leads to fun psych experiments; the literature is filled
  > with all the various things that people will do anonymously that
  > they won't otherwise. Including one notorious study involving
  > torture that would not have passed today's ethical standards. Fun
  > stuff, in any case.
  > 
  > FINE. LEAVE US OUT OF IT.
  
  Brian W. Ogilvie <ogil@quads.uchicago.edu>:

  > The service provides a mechanism for forwarding mail to the
  > original poster. Since most Usenet readers don't know John Smith
  > from Jane Doe except by their opinions and their address, the
  > effect of having an anonymous posting to which mail replies can
  > be directed is minimal, except for those who personally know the
  > poster--and ... the lack of anonymity could be serious. Any
  > mechanism like this is liable to abuse, but the benefits as well
  > as the costs must be weighed. 

  Perry E. Metzger <pmetzger@snark.shearson.com>:
  
  > The tragedy of pseudonymous posting is that, once used, it must
  > always be used.  ...  This is going to be a problem for
  > pseudonymous posters; we'll start recognizing them by their
  > grammatical habits or choice of words, and they'll wind up using
  > pseudonyms all the time, in *everything* they post.
  > 
  > I had thought of pseudonymity as a cloak, to be used at will; now,
  > it's starting to look like a deadman switch that has to be used
  > at all times.
  >  
  > People speak of the 'freedom' of pseudonymity; here's an example
  > of its restrictions. 

  Melinda Shore <shore@dinah.tc.cornell.edu>:

  > The problem ... is less one of authority than it is
  > responsibility.  People who dissasociate their identities from
  > their postings no longer need to be as responsible, and the
  > results of that are the kinds of content-free flamers that show
  > up, for example, in the gay-related newsgroups.  

  Dave Hayes <dave@elxr.jpl.nasa.gov>:
  
  > What a primal example of human nature. I have three questions for
  > you folks. 
  > 
  > Do people really say different things to each other based upon
  > whether their identity is or isn't known?
  > 
  > Are people really so affected by what other people say that the
  > verbage is labeled "abuse"?
  > 
  > Most importantly, on a forum that prizes itself on the freedom of
  > communication that it enjoys, is there really such a thing as
  > freedom of communication?
  
  Karl Kleinpaste <Karl_Kleinpaste@cs.cmu.edu>:

  > Weak reasoning.
  > With freedom comes responsibility.

  Dave Hayes <dave@elxr.jpl.nasa.gov>:
  
  > Responsibility isn't real if it is enforced. True responsibilty
  > comes with no coercion.

  Fred McCall <mccall@mksol.dseg.ti.com>:
  
  > It seems to me that one of the big 'needs' of anonymous servers on

  > anonymous servers.

  > using it...

  Chris Walsh <mack23@avalon.eecs.nwu.edu>:
  
  > The S/N ratio on usenet is, IMHO, so low that complaints about
  > posts from  anon servers are basically using the anon-servers as
  > a whipping boy.  Clearly, any mechanism which decreases the
  > difficulty of posting in an "untraceable" way will increase the
  > quantity of drivel made available, but it will also increase the
  > quantity of useful-but-sensitive material as well.  Perhaps the
  > net effect (pardon the pun) will be a slight decrease in the S/N
  > ratio, but unless an appreciable proportion of posts use the
  > anon-servers, I fail to see how this is so much more dreadful
  > than what we already have that anyone would get their shorts
  > twisted over it.  I can see how it might produce momentary
  > flurries of drivel in certain groups, but these groups already
  > have such flurries regularly.

  <C445585@mizzou1.missouri.edu>:

  > In the larger context, it seems like, as USENET/internet grows,
  > we're going to continue to have problems with abuse AND with the
  > need for anonymity.  I say this because as we expand, we get more

  > also because as we grow we start having more important things go

  > In the future, more personal and more important discussions

  > journals) will crop up.

  Chris Walsh <mack23@avalon.eecs.nwu.edu>:

  > Can anyone email me an example of a newsgroup whose traffic was
  > noticeably worsened, S/N ratio wise, by the anon-servers?

  Ron Dippold <rdippold@qualcomm.com>:
  
  > Are you including Depew as an effect of the anon-servers?
  
  Wes Groleau <groleau@e7sa.crd.ge.com>

  > Several newsgroups were noticeably worsened by ARMM-5b ("b" for
  > boo-boo) which--as everybody knows--was caused by anon-servers 
  > :-)

  Richard E. Depew <red@redpoll.neoucom.edu>:

  > The consensus seems to be that a general anonymous posting service
  > such as that at anon.penet.fi seems sufficiently corrosive of the
  > trust and civility of the net that this particular experiment
