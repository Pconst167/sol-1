This is just one of many access points to the web, the universe of
information available over networks. To follow references, just type the
number then hit the return (enter) key.

The features you have by connecting to this telnet server are very
primitive compared to the features you have when you run a W3 "client"
program on your own computer. If you possibly can, please pick up a client
for your platform to reduce the load on this service and  experience the
web in its full splendor.

WWW LOGOWORLD WIDE WEB INITIATIVE

The WorldWideWeb (W3) is the universe of network-accessible information, an
embodiment of human knowledge. It is an initiative started at CERN[1], now
with many participants. It has a body of software, and a set of protocols
and conventions. W3 uses hypertext and multimedia techniques to make the
web easy for anyone to roam, browse, and contribute to.  Future evolution
of W3 is coordinated by the W3 Organization[2].

Everything there is to know about W3 is linked directly or indirectly to
this document.

There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many
points of view. Here are some places to start.

Virtual Libraryby Subject[1]
       The Virtual Library organises information by subject matter.

List of servers[2]
      All registered HTTP servers by country

by Service Type[3]
       The Web includes data accessible by many other protocols. The lists
      by access protocol may help if you know what kind of service you are
      looking for.

If you find a useful starting point for you personally, you can configure
your WWW browser to start there by default.

statistics program allows you to insert html documents of your choice into
the output, adds support for VMS systems, the Plexus server and various
other configurations, improves CERN server support, and corrects many small
problems with 3.1. (nwn[17])
