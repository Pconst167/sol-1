Divination Web Building Policy
 
0.0 Introduction

In order to maintain the quality and focus of Divination Web, a policy
for Builder-bit (B-bit) dispensation and project construction has been
instituted.  This includes specific quotas and processes of proposal
and review.
 
 
1.0 Quotas
So as to minimize impact upon the DWII database and preserve prompt
response-time, a quota system has been installed with the following
limitations:
 
General Players: 0 objects
Muckers and Builders without a project: 5 objects
Default builders with projects: 150 objects
 
'Coins', the currency whereby building may proceed, are effectively
useless and we may find some way of allowing people to increase their
own cache.
 
Type 'news bpolicy2' for more.

1.1 Quota Increase Request
If a Builder desires a greater quota, they can contact a B-manager 
familiar with their project.  At that time they should provide an
explanation for their request.  Generally the 150 object maximum
will remain firm except under unusual circumstances.
 
 
2.0 Proposal Process (Getting B-bits)
In order to be able to build on DivWeb one must first procure a B-bit,
and these are dispensed by the B-managers:
 
Hsi.Wang.Mu (tyagi@houseofkaos.abyss.com)
Shawn (knightster+@cmu.edu)
 
Email a proposal to one of the B-managers and await a response.
 
Type 'news bpolicy3' for more.

2.1 Proposal Contents
This Muck has very specific goals and purposes which include
networking and experimentation within the subject fields of occultism
and spirituality.  In order to serve these, a loose restraint has been
placed upon building projects.
 
In general, a proposal should contain thematic orientation and at
least a vague concept of structure.  Estimates on the number of
objects to be used and a building schedule are also valuable.
Ultimately it is up to the B-managers whether or not they wish to
sponsor a proposed project, for to do so indicates their assumed
responsibility for the review and expedition.
 
2.3 Proposal Review
Each proposal will be reviewed by B-managers and should any of them
desire to sponsor the project, they will coordinate with the new
Builder on a quota and review schedule.
 
Should such sponsorship not be forthcoming, then suggestions for
revision or a request for additional information will be returned.

3.0 Review Process
In order to facilitate efficient use of database resources and to
preserve the enjoyment of players, periodic reviews will be scheduled
on all building projects currently underway.
 
3.1 General Review Guideline
The following is intended as a guideline rather than a strict
standard, and a review schedule may be conducted differently by a
B-manager based on specific project complexity and/or character.
 
3.2 Suggested Timing
Suggested Initial Review: 2 weeks
Periodic Update Reviews: every 2 months
 
3.3 Review Criteria
B-managers will be looking at internal consistency (where
appropriate), in comparison with the projected construction schedule.
 
Type 'news bpolicy5' for more.

It is suggested that projects be broken into sectors, with regular
completion of a specified sector prior to each review.  The size of 
each sector is left to the discretion of the Builder to be based upon
available time and expertise.
 
3.4 Review Results
A B-manager sponsor or another B-manager who is familiar with the
proposal, quota and schedule for the project will review the whole
with careful scrutiny of any sector designated as 'completed'.
Results from this review will be sent to the Builder and to other
interested B-managers.
 
Exits to reviewed and completed sectors will be made visible to the
public.  In this way the projects will emerge gradually and the
review process will be kept to a minimum of effort.
 
Type 'news bpolicy6' for more.

3.5 Corrections
If there are problems within a sector which was planned to have been
'completed', then the Builder and their sponsor B-manager can work
together to resolve these problems and get the sector open to the
public.  An acceptable means of dealing with these problems would
be to revise the time-schedule and set a new review date.
 
3.6 Warnings
Given severe delays and the lack of logging in (e.g. 180+ days),
Builders may receive a warning that their project and properties
are to be recycled unless management is contacted within one
week.  If no such communication is received within that week,
then their unfinished project is subject to recycling by the
management.
~~~
management
Divination Web is operated and managed by:
 
Caledhaearn (hoffman@curly.red-cross.org)
- Responsible for managing Mucker bits and projects.
 
Hsi.Wang.Mu (tyagi@houseofkaos.abyss.com)
- Responsible for managing Builder bits and projects.
 
Shawn (knightster+@cmu.edu)
- Responsible for maintaining the MUCK server.
 
All managers are able to assist the others with their work, so if you
can't find the manager you're looking for, contact the others.
