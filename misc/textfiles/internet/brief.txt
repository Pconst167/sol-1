        Hi!

        I Was Quite Surprised That Many People Than Have Access To iNET
        Didn't Know *ANYTHiNG* About IRC .... Here iS Some infos To
        Clean This Mess....

        I Included Some Infos About Muds ( Multi-User Dungeons )

        If Ya Want To Reach Me In The IRC, My Nick is : Access
        I'm Usualy There Around 2H00AM =)

        For Modem User ( Internet Througt Dial-Up ), It's Quite
        Difficult To Install A IRC Client If You Don't Have A
        Slip/PPP Connection To Your Host. In This Case, Do The Following :

        OPEN ircclient.itc.univie.ac.at PORT 6668

        If It Doens't Work Anymore, Take a Look In The IRC.FAQ. You Will Find
        More Telnet IRC Access Point.

        Ok, That's All for This time... If Ya Want To Contact Me, Call
