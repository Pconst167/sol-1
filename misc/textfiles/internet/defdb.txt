EICS identifies the consequences of changes in activities occurring in a
region and guides the discussion of these consequences in an environmental
assessment and impact statement.  Using data supplied by the planner, EICS
builds a "need to consider" matrix of likely environmental problems
associated with the proposed activity.  The matrix highlights those areas
which require special attention.  Information provided by EICS includes: 
identification of potential environmental impacts; ramification remarks,
which elaborate on each of the impacts of an activity or attribute; and
mitigation statements, which provide techniques for minimization,
abatement, or avoidance of significant environmental areas such as ecology,
health science, air quality, and energy and resource conservation; and 806
basic human activities grouped into nine broad areas such as construction,
training and research, development testing and evaluation.  The data base
does not contain records but does contain 776 attributes and 800 activities
that can be combined in a matrix to provide more than 500,000 potential
impacts.  Direct access via a remote terminal is available to ETIS
subscribers for $200.00 a year.  Anyone can become an ETIS subscriber and
thereby also obtain direct access to three other data bases maintained by

contains numerous experimental systems under development by CERL.  The
systems are all interactive and can be directly accessed by remote
terminals.  Direct access to all ETIS systems is available to the general
public for an annual subscription fee of $200.00 a year.  Subscribers
receive a users manual and can access the system via a terminal in their
home or office at their convenience.  A free guest account can be

* AMRL Anthropometric Data Bank Library, Volume 1, 1968 Survey of USAF
Women (AD-A056 154/8/XDD) (See NTIS above)
The survey of women of the Air Force was made in the Spring of 1968 by the
Anthropology Branch, Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory,
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio and the Anthropology Research Project (then at
Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio).  A description of the survey and
the results are published in Anthropometry of Air Force Women (AD-743-113),
1972.  Data for age (variable 1), 123 body size measurements (variables
2-214), and grip strength (variable 125) were obtained from a sample of
1905 women.  13 measurements were repeated on 1513 subjects with the
subjects wearing foundation garments (variables 126-138).  The contents of
this tape are also described along with Volumes II-V of The AMRL
Anthropometric Data Bank Library in the report The AMRL Anthropometric Data

country.  Summary statistics and a description of measuring techniques for
most variables are reported in a review of anthropometric data of German
Air Force and United Air Force Personnel 1967-68, published as
AGARD-AG-205, 1975.  The contents of this tape are also described along
with Volume 1 and Volumes III-V of the AMRL Anthropometric Data Bank

of 1965.  In the first portion of the survey 549 officers (396 pilots and
navigators; 153 non-flyers), 4 Warrant Officers and 683 Enlisted men were
measured.  In the second half, 2632 men (2203 white, 412 black, 17 other)
undergoing basic training and one Sergeant were measured at Lackland AFB. 
Of this Lackland group 106 men had ranks other than basic trainee.  The
contents of this tape are also described along with Volumes 1, II, IV, and
V of the AMRL Anthropometric Data Bank Library in the report The AMRL
Anthropometric Data Bank Library: Volume 1-V, AMRL-TR-77-1, October 1977.

* AMRL Anthropometric Data Bank Library, Volume IV, 1950 Survey of USAF
Flying Personnel (AD-A056 157/1/XDD) (See NTIS above)
An anthropometric study of flying personnel was conducted in 1950 at 14 Air
Force bases in MA, MI, CO, WA, CA, TX, and LA.  The original statistical
analyses were the initial activity of the Anthropology Research Project. 
The results, reported in TR-52-321, were carried out prior to the
availability of modern computer facilities; since publication of that
report, the data have been modernized.  Millimeter figures for most
variables originally recorded but not punched were incorporated into the
data.  This tape includes data for 4000 subjects and 161 variables,
variables 1-132 are body size values, 133 is age, 134-146 are somatotype
ratings (those listed as somatotype are ratings done by Dupertuis using
Sheldons method).  A statistical comparison of the body typing methods of
Hooton and Sheldon is provided in SADC TR 56-366 (AD-097 205).  The
contents of this tape are also described along with Volumes I-III and
Volume V of the AMRL Anthropometric Data Bank Library in the report The
AMRL Anthropometric Data Bank Library: Volume 1-V, AMRL-TR-77-1, October
1977.  This contains the complete survey in the fully edited form.

* AMRL Anthropometric Data Bank Library, Volume V. US Correlations (AD-A063
682/9/XDD) (See NTIS above)
Correlation matrices based on data from USAF Anthropometric surveys of
women (1968, 127 variables), flying personnel (1950, 128 variables; 1967,
190 variables), and basic trainees (1965, 161 variables); a US Army survey
of women separatees (1946, 60 variables); the Health Examination Survey of
civilian adults (1960-1972, 18 variables); and a survey of law enforcement
officers (1974, 23 measurements) are presented for use by engineers who
need them in solving design problems and for anthropologists and
statisticians whose analyses and understanding of the interrelationships of
body size data depend significantly on these coefficients.  Sample sizes in
these surveys ranged from almost 2000 upward.  Sample means and standard
deviations are presented for all variables involved.  The contents of this
tape are also described in the report, Intercorrelations of Anthropometric
Measurements:  A Source Book for USA Data, Churchill, E., P. Kikta, and T.
Churchill, AMRL-TR-77-2 (AD-A058 616), Aerospace Medical Research
Laboratories, WPAFB OH, May 1978.  Complete data from the four USAF surveys
are described in the AMRL Anthropometric Data Bank Library, Volumes I-V,
Churchill, E., P. Kikta, and T. Churchill, AMRL-TR-77-1 (AD-A047 314),
Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories, WPAFB OH, October 1977, and on

atmospheric density and a drag coefficient equal to .0013.  The delivered
data set consists of 17 files (blocksize 2400 and record length 80) on 3
tapes.  The first file on the first tape contains an internally documented
Fortran 77 program for reading any of the other 16 files.  All other files
