John Labovitz's e-zine-list

_Last updated: 3 April 1994 by John Labovitz <johnl@ora.com>_

This is a summary of electronically-accessible zines -- what they are,
who puts them out, and where you can find them. In most cases,
descriptions are excerpted from the masthead of the zine listed.

RECENT CHANGES TO THIS LIST

Please note that I am (slowly) changing my email address from
johnl@netcom.com to johnl@ora.com. Eventually, the e-zine-list will move
off netcom's ftp site, since the load is way too high. More when that
happens.

ADMINISTRIVIA

If you have any additions, deletions, or changes to this list, please
email them to johnl@ora.com.

A notice about new editions of this list is posted to the following
mailing lists:

  WRITERS@VM1.NODAK.EDU

The full ASCII text version is automatically posted every 3 weeks
(thanks to Larry Detweiler) to the following USENET newsgroups:

and etext.archive.umich.edu , via the World Wide Web at "
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/johnl/zines/e-zine-list.html ", and via email
from me (johnl@ora.com).

If you publish an e-zine, or know someone who does, send a copy to me
and I'll add the relevant info to this database. Please include as
much of the information below as appropriate:

WHAT IS A "ZINE"?

For those of you not acquainted with the zine world, "zine" is short
for either "fanzine" or "magazine," depending on your point of view.
Zines are generally produced by one person or a small group of people,
done often for fun or personal reasons, and tend to be irreverent,
bizarre, and/or esoteric. Zines are not "mainstream" publications --
they generally do not contain advertisements (except, sometimes,
advertisements for other zines), do not have a large subscriber base,
and are generally not produced to make a profit.

FORMATS

Most e-zines listed here are in standard ASCII text format, which you
can read on just about any computer or terminal, and print on any
printer. A few are available in PostScript for printing on a laser
printer (or viewing on-screen if you have a PostScript interpreter in
your window system). A small number are available in some
system-specific format (i.e., Macintosh HyperCard). More and more are
becoming available in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) on the World
Wide Web.

HOW DO I GET THE E-ZINES?

I have listed the various methods of access for each particular
e-zine. Briefly, I use the following:

FTP -- File Transfer Protocol
  The host/pathname is given in the form "host:path" that certain FTP
  clients (such as NCFTP) can use directly; otherwise, you'd probably
  type "ftp host" and then "cd path" or some such. All FTP sites
  listed accept anonymous logins (use "ftp" as username and your email
  address as password).

  If you are not directly on the Internet, you can use an FTP-mail
  server to get files. Perhaps the most widely known public FTP-mail
  server is located at decwrl.dec.com (send the message "help" to
  ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com for more information). (Thanks to John Reeves
  for supplying this missing information.)

Gopher
  Only accessible if your site is directly on the Internet. Try typing
  "gopher". If it works, you have a gopher client, and can usually
  type "gopher host".

WWW -- World Wide Web
  Only accessible if your site is directly on the Internet, and
  supports a WWW-compatible hypertext browser. Current browsers
  include www (ASCII line mode), lynx (ASCII full-screen mode),
  xmosaic (X Windows), tkWWW (X Windows), Mac Mosaic (Macintosh), PC
  Mosaic (PC), Cello (PC), and probably a few others.

Usenet -- Usenet News
  Only accessible if your site carries the specific Usenet group.

E-Mail -- Electronic Mail
  You can usually request current or back issues via this address.
  Sometimes a site will run a mail server that automates some of this
  work. Instructions are listed, if applicable.

Postal
  Last resort, or point of contact for zines that have paper editions.

Phone/Fax
  Why? I dunno; because it was there.

CompuServe
  You know, that out-dated system that charges ridiculous rates.

Other
  BBSes and other on-line systems the zine resides on.

  marxist theory and it's consequences as well as publish works of
  fiction falling into the bag of 'proletarian literature.' We greatly

Cropduster

 "Cropduster revolves, as perhaps everything does, around the
  substance that one calls pop-culture. With various jargon thrown
  around including: post-modernism, nihilism, etc. in an attempt for
  one generation to understand the next, people forget what the
  essence of pop-culture really is -- a collection of somewhat useless
  artifacts which are given exceptional value by groups of people.
  What we hope to show is not the trends but rather the idols of
  pop-culture. We hope to convey the simplicity of everyday life
  through the icons which lead generation upon generation onwards."

DargonZine -- The Magazine of the Dargon Project

 "DargonZine is an electronic magazine printing stories written for
  the Dargon Project, a shared-world anthology similar to (and
  inspired by) Robert Asprin's Thieves' World anthologies, created by

  Project centers around a medieval-style duchy called Dargon in the
  far reaches of the Kingdom of Baranur on the world named Makdiar,
  and as such contains stories with a fantasy fiction/sword and
  sorcery flavor."

FUNHOUSE! -- The cyberzine of degenerate pop culture

 "Dedicated to whatever happens to be on my mind at the time I'm
  writing. The focus will tend to be on those aspects of our
  fun-filled world which aren't given the attention of the bland
  traditional media, or which have been woefully misinterpreted or
  misdiagnosed by the same. FUNHOUSE! is basically a happy place, and
  thus the only real criteria I will try to meet is to refrain from
  rants, personal attacks, and flames -- and thus FUNHOUSE! is an
  apolitical place. Offbeat films, music, literature, and experiences
  are largely covered, with the one stipulation that articles are
  attempted to be detailed and well documented, although this is no
  guarantee of completeness or correctness, so that the interested
  reader may further pursue something which may spark her interest."

DISTRIBUTION: How to obtain this document

This document has been brought to you in part by CRAM, involved in the
redistribution of valuable information to a wider USENET audience (see
below). The most recent version of this document can be obtained via
the author's instructions above. The following directions apply to 
retrieve the possibly less-current USENET FAQ version.

  FTP
  ---
    This FAQ is available from the standard FAQ server rtfm.mit.edu via
    FTP in the file /pub/usenet/news.answers/writing/zines

  Email
  -----
    Email requests for FAQs go to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with commands
    on lines in the message body, e.g. `help' and `index'.

CRAM: the Cyberspatial Reality Advancement Movement

In an effort to bring valuable information to the masses, and
as a service to motivated information compilers, I 
(L. Detweiler) will help others unfamiliar with Usenet 
`publish' their documents for widespread dissemination via the 
FAQ structure, and act as a `sponsor' knowledgable in the 
submissions process. This document is being distributed under
this arrangement.

I have found these compilations tend to appear on various 
mailing lists and are valuable enough to deserve wider 
distribution. If you know of an existing compilation of 
Internet information that is not currently a FAQ, please 
contact me and I may `sponsor' it. The benefits to the author 
include:

- use of the existing FAQ infrastructure for distribution:
  - automated mail server service
  - FTP archival
  - automated posting

- a far wider audience that can improve the quality, accuracy,
  and coverage of the document enormously through email 
  feedback

- potential professional inquiries for the use of your 
  document in other settings, such as newsletters, books, 
  etc.

- with me as your sponsor, I will also take care of the 
  technicalities in the proper format of the posted version 
  and updating procedures, leaving you free of the `overhead' 
  to focus on the basic updates alone

Send comments relating to the *distribution* of this document
(particularly relevant newsgroups not currently covered in
its current distribution) or inquiries on other documents to
<tmp@netcom.com>. 

The choice of who I `sponsor' is entirely arbitrary. You always
have the option of handling the submission process yourself. 
See the FAQ submission guidlines FAQ in news.answers.

Voices from the Net

 "There are a lot of folks with at least one foot in this complex
  region we call (much too simply) 'the net.' There are a lot of
  voices on these wires. From IRC to listservs, MUDspace to e-mail,
  Usenet group to commercial bbs -- all kinds of voices -- loud and
  quiet, anonymous and well-known. And yet, it's far from clear what
  it might mean to be a 'voice' from, or on, the net. Enter Voices
  from the Net: one attempt to sample, explore, the possibilities (or
  perils) of net.voices. Worrying away at the question. Running down
  the meme. Looking/listening, and reporting back to you."

DISTRIBUTION: How to obtain this document

This document has been brought to you in part by CRAM, involved in the
redistribution of valuable information to a wider USENET audience (see
below). The most recent version of this document can be obtained via
the author's instructions above. The following directions apply to 
retrieve the possibly less-current USENET FAQ version.

  FTP
  ---
    This FAQ is available from the standard FAQ server rtfm.mit.edu via
    FTP in the file /pub/usenet/news.answers/writing/zines

CRAM: the Cyberspatial Reality Advancement Movement

In an effort to bring valuable information to the masses, and
as a service to motivated information compilers, I 
(L. Detweiler) will help others unfamiliar with Usenet 
`publish' their documents for widespread dissemination via the 
FAQ structure, and act as a `sponsor' knowledgable in the 
submissions process. This document is being distributed under
this arrangement.

I have found these compilations tend to appear on various 
mailing lists and are valuable enough to deserve wider 
distribution. If you know of an existing compilation of 
Internet information that is not currently a FAQ, please 
contact me and I may `sponsor' it. The benefits to the author 
include:

- use of the existing FAQ infrastructure for distribution:
  - automated mail server service
  - FTP archival
  - automated posting

- a far wider audience that can improve the quality, accuracy,
  and coverage of the document enormously through email 
  feedback

- potential professional inquiries for the use of your 
  document in other settings, such as newsletters, books, 
  etc.

- with me as your sponsor, I will also take care of the 
  technicalities in the proper format of the posted version 
  and updating procedures, leaving you free of the `overhead' 
  to focus on the basic updates alone

Send comments relating to the *distribution* of this document
(particularly relevant newsgroups not currently covered in
its current distribution) or inquiries on other documents to
<tmp@netcom.com>. 

The choice of who I `sponsor' is entirely arbitrary. You always
have the option of handling the submission process yourself. 
See the FAQ submission guidlines FAQ in news.answers.
