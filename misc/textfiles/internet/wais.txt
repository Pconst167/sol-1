Subject: WAIS, A Sketch of an Overview

The following is something I threw together, in the time it took to type
it, for some friends that had shown an interest in WAIS at one time or
another.  It may be of interest, for those that are curious about WAIS.

                 WAIS, A Sketch Of An Overview
                 =============================
               Jeff Kellem, Beyond Dreams
                    23 September 1991


So, what is WAIS?
-----------------

    First off, WAIS stands for Wide Area Information Server.  And, just
what the heck is a "Wide Area Information Server"?  It's a set of programs
(or, more specifically, a protocol) that allows users to search and access
different types of information from a single interface.  This information
can be practically anything, from text to sound to images to whatever you
can think up.  The information can reside anywhere and on many different
computer systems.  The WAIS protocol is an extension of the ANSI Z39.50
information retrieval protocol.  (WAIS is pronounced "ways", BTW.)

How does one access info from a WAIS server?
--------------------------------------------

     You'll need a WAIS client.  There are a few sample clients (user
interfaces) provided with the WAIS distribution available from Thinking
Machines (TMC) [see below, "How do I get the WAIS distribution?"]: a GNU
Emacs, a shell, and an X Windows interface.  A Mac interface is also
available from TMC.  Other interfaces are currently "in the works", such as
a Motif interface, one for the NeXT, a dumb terminal interface, among
others.  Once you start up the WAIS client, you specify what's called a
source to search upon.  [A `source' specifies a server of information and
how the client can contact it, along with some other information.]  You can
ask multiple sources for information.  Then, you ask the source(s) a
question/query.  A question consists of a phrase.  With the current sample
server/client implementations, this phrase is basically considered a set of
keywords to search for, based on weights/percentages of each word in the
documents (you're searching upon).  But, since WAIS really just specifies
the protocol for the client and server to use for communication, the
underlying search on the server could just as well use various natural
language queries upon its information.  The information on the server could
also easily be some arbitrary database, as long as the server knows how to
understand a WAIS question and send back a response.  The user never has to
see this part of WAIS.  All s/he see is the client side of things, the
choice of a source(s) and the posing of a question.  Once the user has found
some relevant documents, s/he can ask the source(s) for other documents
"similar" to the ones found.

Well, what type of information is available?
--------------------------------------------

    All kinds and more are being added all the time.  Here's a list of the
current server names (taken from the release announcement of version 8 beta
3.1), organized by topic:

How do I find out about these and other WAIS servers?
-----------------------------------------------------

    Thinking Machines runs a WAIS server, directory-of-servers.src, which
is a "white pages" of other WAIS servers.  You can query this WAIS server
to find other servers and new ones that pop up.  When someone creates a
server that they want others to know about, s/he registers that server
with the directory-of-servers.  Directions on how to do this are given
in the WAIS distribution from think.com.

Okay, so how do I obtain the WAIS distribution?
-----------------------------------------------

    The WAIS distribution, currently at version 8 beta 3.1 is available
via anonymous ftp from the:

     think.com:/public/wais

directory.  The filename for WAIS version 8 beta 3.1 is:

     wais-8-b3.1.tar.Z

and, for the Mac client/interface:

     WAIStation-0-62.sit.hqx

A bibliography of WAIS related articles is included below.  If additions
are made to this bibliography, you can obtain a fresh copy via anonymous
ftp from:

     quake.think.com:/pub/wais/wais-discussion/bibliography.txt

If you have further questions about WAIS, feel free to send me a note.

What about mailing lists or newsgroups related to WAIS?
-------------------------------------------------------

    There are three mailing lists, maintained at think.com, regarding
WAIS.  They are:

    wais-interest@think.com   announcements of new releases for the
                    Internet environment.  One message a
                    month or so.
    wais-interest-request@think.com     To join, send mail here.


    wais-discussion@think.com Moderated digest of mail from users and
                    developers on Electronic Publishing
                    and other WAIS related topics.  Includes
                    all from wais-interest.
    wais-discussion-request@think.com   To join, send mail here.

    wais-talk@think.com       unmoderated list for implementors and
                    interactive discussions.  A couple notes
                    a week, depending on activity, of course.
    wais-talk-request@think.com         To join, send mail here.


As a reminder, requests for additions/deletions/etc. should go to

     wais-<foo>-request@think.com

where `<foo>' is one of `interest, `discussion', or `talk'.  Archives are
available from WAIS server, wais-discussion, or anonymous ftp from

     quake.think.com:/pub/wais/wais-discussion

The USENET newsgroup, alt.wais, is also devoted to discussing WAIS and
related items of interest.  It is disjoint from the above mailing lists.

If you have any further questions regarding WAIS, feel free to send me a
note.  I can be reached via e-mail at:

     composer@Beyond.Dreams.ORG

Hope this was of some help.  This document is an extreme rough draft,
typing from a stream of consciousness.
