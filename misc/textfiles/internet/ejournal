INTRODUCTION

The Directory of Electronic Journals and Newsletters is intended to provide
a comprehensive listing of all electronic journals and newsletters which are
of academic interest and available through Bitnet, Internet and any
affiliated networks.  This Directory is part of an ongoing project and is
updated as new electronic journals and newsletters come into existence and as
existing entries are changed.  Every effort has been made to provide the user
with up-to-date information.  Most entries have been either provided from or
scrutinized by the journal and newsletter editors themselves to assure
accuracy.

The primary intent of this Directory is to catalog all existing electronic
journals and newsletters that are available over the various academic
networks.  A secondary intention is to catalog all e-serials that are being
produced over the commercial networks.  Thus, over time this Directory will
provide an entirely comprehensive listing of all e-serials.  As the
traditional taxonomy of "journal" and "newsletter" is ill-suited to the
diversity of formats found within the networks, a third category of
"Hypercard Stacks, Digest-Newsletters and Others" (Section 4) is here
included.  This section catalogs hypercard stacks and other formats that
represent significant sources of information that are similar in nature to
journals and newsletters.  It should be noted that digests which are
straightforward collections of conversational questions and answers are
considered to be a type of list, but any digests which mix a simple list
format with the newsletter format are here included.

Ordinary (conversational) digests and lists are covered in Diane Kovacs'
compilation, Academic Lists.  Thus, no attempt has been made to provide a
comprehensive listing of the hundreds of existing digests in this Directory.
For a complete catalog of digests and lists the reader is encourage to
retrieve the Global List with the command:

TELL LISTSERV AT NDSUVM1 GET INTEREST PACKAGE

Or through FTP to 192.33.33.22 (NISC.SRI.COM)
GET /netinfo/interest-groups

Warning - this file will be sent to you in twelve or more sections and is
over 500K in size.

The philosophy behind the presentation of the information within this
Directory is based on the intention of providing the reader with the most
up-to-date information that is possible and in the most comprehensive
fashion.  Thus, I have avoided editing descriptions as size is not a factor
for an e-text.  I have also listed partial entries in the interest of
providing the reader with the maximum of available information (these
incomplete entries will be marked as such).  This makes it possible for the
reader to follow leads I have not yet completed and, in turn, to provide me
with information not yet represented in the latest edition of the Directory.
Users of this document are encouraged to sent me notices of defunct entries,
new entries and related information and suggestions.  By this means I hope to
utilize fully the best features of the Net and to make information available
in a fashion that draws upon and promotes the unique strength of the virtual
community.

I hope to be able to provide a Wordperfect version of this low ascii file on
a FTP server in the Fall of 1992.

I am indeted to the countless individuals who have contributed to this
project and helped create the first and only comprehensive Directory of
Electronic Journals and Newsletters.

>>> Getting an ISSN for an Electronic Journal <<<

by
Charles W. Bailey, Jr.
University of Houston
LIB3@UHUPVM1

>From NetMonth:  The Independent Guide to BITNET 4, no. 5 (September 1990):
5-6.

The International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is a unique eight-digit
number that identifies a particular serial.  For serials published in the
U.S., ISSN numbers are assigned by the National Serials Data Program (NSDP)
of the Library of Congress.  Recently, NSDP assigned an ISSN to The
Public-Access Computer Systems Review, an electronic journal that complements
the Public-Access Computer Systems Forum (PACS-L@UHUPVM1).  The PACS Forum is
a moderated Bitnet list that deals with all computer systems that libraries
make available to their users, and it currently has over 1,100 subscribers in
25 countries.  The PACS Review, which is published two times a year, deals
with the same subject matter as the PACS Forum.  When an issue is published,
PACS Forum users are notified by a table of contents message, which describes
that issue's article files and provides instructions for retrieving the
files.

NSDP also created a bibliographic record for the PACS Review in the OCLC
Online Union Catalog, a twenty-million-record database that is widely used by
libraries for cataloging, interlibrary loan, reference, and other purposes.
(A more powerful, user-friendly version of the OCLC Online Union Catalog
called EPIC has just been made available for fee-based searching.) A
bibliographic record describes a serial (or other work) in a standard
machine-readable format according to established cataloging rules.

It is noteworthy and commendable that NSDP took the initiative to assign the
PACS Review an ISSN number and to catalog it; I never contacted them
requesting that they do so.  NSDP staff learned of the PACS Review as the
result of two speeches I made about the publication at a recent national
library conference.

The assignment of an ISSN number and the creation of a bibliographic record
on OCLC makes an electronic journal more accessible to libraries and their
users.  Electronic publishers are fortunate that NSDP has taken a
progressive, proactive stand on electronic journals, and it is treating them
seriously.  I would urge other electronic publishers to contact NSDP and
obtain ISSN numbers for their electronic journals.  The appropriate
application form is contained in a brochure called "ISSN is for Serials,"

>>> PACS Review Special Issue on Networked Based E-Serials <<<


A SPECIAL SECTION OF THE PACS REVIEW ON NETWORK-BASED ELECTRONIC SERIALS

By Charles W. Bailey, Jr.

Network-based electronic serials are serials that are primarily "published"
on computer networks like BITNET and Internet.  Little has been written about
these innovative publications; however, the first issue of volume two of The
Public-Access Computer Systems Review provides a rare inside look at them in
a "Special Section on Network-Based Electronic Serials." All of the authors
in this special section have played an important role in fostering this new
communication medium, and most are the editors and/or publishers of
e-serials.

The Public-Access Computer Systems Review is an electronic journal that is
published by the University of Houston Libraries. You can retrieve an article
by sending one of the commands listed after the article's description in an
e-mail message to LISTSERV@UHUPVM1 (BITNET) or LISTSERV@UHUPVM1.UH.EDU
(Internet). The first command retrieves the article as a file.  The second
command retrieves the article as an e-mail message.  If you are not an
experienced network user or you are not on BITNET, it is recommended that you
retrieve articles as e-mail messages.


ARTICLES IN THE SPECIAL SECTION ON NETWORK-BASED ELECTRONIC
SERIALS

In "The Electronic Journal: What, Whence, and When?," Ann Okerson surveys
current and future e-journal publication activities.  She discusses
publishers' visions of e-journals, and she identifies four major groups of
potential e-journal publishers: existing publishers, intermediary
organizations (e.g., ISI and CARL), researchers and scholars, and
universities.  She concludes by forecasting how e-journals may evolve during
the next 9 years. (GET OKERSON PRV2N1 or GET OKERSON PRV2N1 F=MAIL)

In "Online Journals: Disciplinary Designs for Electronic Scholarship," Teresa
Harrison et al. examine and critique the e- journal concept, then describe
the Electronic Journal of Communication/La Revue Electronique de
Communication (EJC/REC). EJC/REC is a referred, bilingual journal dealing
with communication.  It is part of the innovate Comserve service, which
provides communication scholars with a variety of electronic information
services (e.g., directory information, journal indexes, access to over 1,000
files, and 20 computer conferences).  (GET HARRISON PRV2N1 or GET HARRISON
PRV2N1 F=MAIL)

In "Post-Gutenburg Galaxy: The Fourth Revolution in the Means of Production
of Knowledge," Stevan Harnad discusses the three historical revolutions in
knowledge production (speech, writing, and print) and the emerging fourth
revolution--electronic "skywriting" on the Net.  He examines the limitations
of our print-based scholarly communication system, and describes how
electronic communication can support scholarly skywriting, a process that
allows scholars to get rapid feedback about promising ideas and theories from
colleagues worldwide.  He then describes Psycoloquy, a referred psychology
e-journal that embodies the scholarly skywriting process.  (GET HARNAD PRV2N1
or GET HARNAD PRV2N1 F=MAIL)

In "The Journal of the International Academy of Hospitality Research," Lon
Savage describes a referred e-journal for researchers in hotel, restaurant,
and institutional management and tourism.  JIAHR is sponsored by the
International Academy of Hospitality Research and published by Virginia
Tech's Scholarly Communications Project.  JIAHR issues are composed of single
articles, and a related computer conference complements the journal.  Savage
discusses how individual subscribers and libraries have dealt with receiving
an e-journal.  JIAHR is an interesting example of how the Net can be used to
publish a fee-based journal for a small, specialized audience.  (GET SAVAGE
PRV2N1 or GET SAVAGE PRV2N1 F=MAIL)

In "Postmodern Culture: Publishing in the Electronic Medium," Eyal Amiran and
John Unsworth describe the refereed journal Postmodern Culture, which deals
with contemporary literature, theory, and culture.   Postmodern Culture is
free on the Net, and a subscription fee is charged for disk or microfiche
versions of the journal.  A computer conference, PMC-Talk, complements the
journal.  The authors also discuss the future of e-journals. (GET AMIRAN
PRV2N1 or GET AMIRAN PRV2N1 F=MAIL)

In "New Horizons in Adult Education: The First Five Years (1987- 1991)," Jane
Hugo and Linda Newell describe the evolution of one of the first (if not the
first) refereed e-journals on the Net. This unique adult education journal is
edited by graduate students. (GET HUGO PRV2N1 or GET HUGO PRV2N1 F=MAIL)

In "EJournal: An Account of the First Two Years," Edward Jennings provides a
personal look at his efforts to establish and publish a refereed e-journal on
electronic networks and texts.  This behind-the-scenes narrative reveals some
of the trials and tribulations that may face the prospective e-journal
publisher. (GET JENNINGS PRV2N1 or GET JENNINGS PRV2N1 F=MAIL)

In "The Newsletter on Serials Pricing Issues," Marcia Tuttle describes the
evolution and publishing practices of this e- newsletter, which deals with
serials concerns.  In addition to BITNET and Internet, the newsletter is also
published on ALANET, DataLinx, and EBSCONET.  She also discusses a variety of
electronic publishing issues.  (GET TUTTLE PRV2N1 or GET TUTTLE PRV2N1
F=MAIL)

ANOTHER ARTICLE OF INTEREST FROM THE SAME ISSUE

In "How to Start and Manage a BITNET LISTSERV Discussion Group: A Beginner's
Guide,"  Diane Kovacs et al. discuss the steps to set up and run a computer
conference using the Revised LISTSERV software.  LISTSERV is a very widely
used software package that supports both computer conferences and e-serial
publication on BITNET (many existing e-serials are distributed with this
software).  It runs on IBM mainframes under the VM/CMS operating system.

>>> CATALYST: The Community Services Catalyst <<<

The Community Services Catalyst, a refereed print journal that has been
serving community college educators for more than twenty years, is now
distributed as an electronic journal in addition to its print version.

The quarterly journal is published by the National Council on Community
Services and Continuing Education, an affiliate council of the American
Association of Community, Junior and Technical Colleges.  The journal is
being made available in its electronic form by the Scholarly Communications
Project of Virginia Tech, which is seeking to explore some of the new
frontiers in electronic communication of scholarly work.

CATALYST currently is distributed in its print form to dues-paying members of
the Council, as a benefit of their membership, and to libraries and other
non-members at subscription prices of $20 per year in the U.S., $25 outside
the U.S.  The journal has a paid circulation (including members) of
approximately 1200.

Electronic subscribers, in addition to having access to past issues of the
journal, will be sent the Tables of Contents of future issues as those issues
are published; the subscribers then may order full texts by electronic mail
from their own computers of any and all articles they wish to read.
Currently, all articles from Issues Number 3 and 4 of Volume 21 (1991) are
available on line.

CATALYST is reviewed and indexed in the CURRENT INDEX TO JOURNALS IN
EDUCATION and in ERIC and is available in microfilm and microfiche from
University Microfilms International. Articles submitted for publication are
reviewed by the editorial staff and editorial board.  Initiated in 1971,
CATALYST is the second oldest continuously published journal in the community
college field. It publishes practictioner-oriented articles on practices in
continuing /community education as delivered by community colleges, including
papers on research in the field.  The journal is printed at Virginia Tech, a
fact that makes it easier to coordinate the printed and electronic versions.

To Subscribe:

To subscribe to the electronic journal, one need send only the command
"SUBSCRIBE CATALYST Firstname Lastname" [where Firstname Lastname are the
first and last names of the individual subscriber] by electronic mail to the
address: LISTSERV@VTVM1 on Bitnet and LISTSERV@VTVM1.CC.VT.EDU on the
Internet.  John Doe, for example, would send the command SUBSCRIBE CATALYST
JOHN DOE.  Electronic subscribers will receive instructions on how to order
a list of available articles, how to retrieve full texts of those articles,
and how to cancel their subscriptions.

To make access to the journal more manageable, access is provided to
individual articles, rather than to entire issues.  Interested readers, of
course, may order all articles from an issue, on an individual basis.

>>> Dargonzine - The Magazine of the Dargon Project <<<

DargonZine is an electronic magazine printing stories written for the Dargon
Project, a shared-world anthology similar to (and inspired by) Robert
Asprin's Thieves' World anthologies, created by David "Orny" Liscomb in his
now retired magazine, FSFNet.  The Dargon Project centers around a
medieval-style duchy called Dargon in the far reaches of the Kingdom of
Baranur on the world named Makdiar, and as such contains stories with a
fantasy fiction/sword and sorcery flavor.  At this time, DargonZine has no
plans to publish anything other than Dargon Project stories, but there are
several other magazines out there to satisfy this need.

To Subscribe:

Subscribers to DargonZine will have each new issue sent to their userid as it
comes out.  A subscription may be obtained by sending a request via MAIL to
the editor, Dafydd, at the userid WHITE@DUVM.Bitnet.  This request should
contain your full userid (logonid and node, or a valid Internet address) as
well as your full name and the file transfer format you prefer (either DISK
DUMP, PUNCH/MAIL, or SENDFILE/NETDATA (non-Bitnet subscribers only have one
option - Mail)).  After that, you will receive all issues as they are sent
out.

Submissions:

As mentioned above, the Dargon Project is a shared-world 'anthology', and as
such it requires a great deal of commitment from its writers.  Readers
wishing to write for the Project should contact the editor for more detailed
instructions about the background of the Project as well as plotlines
currently in development.  Of course, the first requirement for joining the
project is to read all of the Project's output to date to get to know the
characters and world being written about.  Back issues of FSFNet, the
Project's first home, are available from the Listserv@TCSVM (and FTPable from
vm.tcs.tulane.edu (in numbers, 129.81.128.1)).  See above for back issue
information about DargonZine.

Back Issues:

Back issues have been moved to the FTPable archive machine
eklektik.cs.pitt.edu (130.49.2.135).  They are stored there in  compressed
format under the directory rpg/fiction/dargon in the form of dzv.n, where
v=volume and n=number. They should be retrieved in binary format and must be
uncompressed via the standard unix uncompress command. NOTE: it is possible
for BitNet users without a direct internet connection to do FTP - try sending
a 'help' to BitFTP or send me mail asking how to use it.

>>> New Horizons in Adult Education <<<

NEW HORIZONS IN ADULT EDUCATION, founded in 1987, is a refereed electronic
journal managed by graduate students.  Using the speed of electronic
transmission, NEW HORIZONS  gives all types of adult educators a means to
publish their most current thinking and research within adult education and
related fields.   The editorial staff, comprised of graduate students, sends
submissions out for blind review, relays the reviewers' comments to authors,
and finally, formats and distributes the revised articles in the form of NEW
HORIZONS IN ADULT EDUCATION  -- all this is done using the medium of
mainframe computer telecommunications.

NEW HORIZONS IN ADULT EDUCATION is transmitted to adult educators around the
world via The Adult Education Network (AEDNET), an electronic network.
AEDNET and the journal are sponsored by Syracuse University, through funding
from the Kellogg Foundation.  Access to NEW HORIZONS IN ADULT EDUCATION is
facilitated in two ways. First the journal is free. Second, the contents of
the journal are indexed in ERIC, Educational Resources Information Center.
Syracuse University's Adult Education Program hopes the journal and AEDNET
will be catalysts in connecting adult educators throughout the world and in
promoting the exchange of ideas and research.

Articles can be submitted to NEW HORIZONS in a variety of disk formats
through regular land mail or electronically over AEDNET.  If an individual
author does not have access to mainframe computer technology, the editorial
staff will work with conventional paper copies and postal systems to publish
important contributions to adult education.

To Subscribe:

If you would like to subscribe to NEW HORIZONS IN ADULT EDUCATION, enroll in
the Adult Education Network by sending an email note to aednet@suvm (for
BITNET) or aednet.suvm.acs.syr.edu (for Internet) which contains your USERID

Robert Kraft's OFFLINE column has appeared in printed form since 1984 in the
Bulletin of the Council of Societies for the Study of Religion and in the
Religious Studies News.  Despite its name, it also now appears in
prepublication electronic form on the HUMANIST discussion list at the node
BROWNVM and on the IOUDAIOS list at YORKVM1.  OFFLINE began as a service of
the Computer Assisted Research Group of the Society of Biblical Literature,
but it attempts to cover more widely the actual and potential use of
computers in religious studies in general.  Currently, an editorial team
often contributes items for inclusion in the column.

There is no subscription list but if one is a member of either
HUMANIST@BROWNMVM or IOUDAIOS@YORKVM1 then it will be sent to you as it is
issued to these lists.

Back Issues:

You may obtain a copy by issuing the command -- GET filename filetype
HUMANIST -- either interactively or as a batch-job, addressed to
ListServ@Brownvm.  Thus on a VM/CMS system, you say interactively:  TELL

>>> Online Journal of Distance Education and Communication <<<

In the industrial age, we go to school.  In the information age, school can
come to us.  This is the message implicit in the media and movement of
distance education.  The issues that the Journal is concerned with fall into
four basic content areas:

The Journal is interested in distance education as the organized method of
reaching geographically disadvantaged learners, whether K-12, post secondary,
or general enrichment students.

The Journal recognizes that education encompasses a broad area of experience
and that distance education includes distance communications that fall
outside the domain of formal learning.  The Journal welcomes contributions
that deal with serving people at a distance who aren't necessarily associated
with a learning institution.

Once the distance education infrastructure is solidly in place, local
learners will want to tap into it, because they simply prefer learning in a
decentralized setting or because they want to expand their learning
opportunities and resources beyond those immediately available to them.  This
phenomenon, which we call 'bringing distance education home,' will grow in
the coming years and we look forward to hearing from people about
telecommunications in education, as a tool or a content area.

The Journal is interested in projects concerned with overcoming cultural
barriers through the use of electronic communication.

A Word About Approach:

Electronic journals are different from their paper-based counterparts in two
significant ways.  The first is the uncompromising sequentiality of online
media- readers can not skip past online articles that don't interest them the
way they can in a conventional magazine.  And second, generally anyone who
writes for an online publication is on the same network as those who read it.
Therefore, it is much easier for writers and readers to contact each other.
These two aspects fit together nicely.  I ask writers to contribute short
(1-2 page) summary articles.  Readers interested in specific articles can
then ask writers directly for more detail.  This approach cuts down on the
network resources needed to distribute the Online Journal and allows for
greater reader interactivity, while reducing the amount of unwanted
information readers are forced to scroll through.

rev psyc

If you do not want your email address to be retrievable that way, send to
listserv@pucc.bitnet the command:

set psyc conceal

(This command will only work after you are already signed on.)

The archive of PSYCOLOQUY back-issues is currently retrievable both by
anonymous ftp on the Internet and by the standard listserv file retrieval
commands on Bitnet:

(1) Bitnet/Listserv Retrieval of PSYCOLOQUY Archive:

Bitnet users can either send the commands shown below as a TELL message to
Listserv (TELL LISTSERV AT PUCC) or as email to LISTSERV@PUCC.bitnet. If you
use email, your commands should appear in the body of the message and not in
the subject line. Remember to send your mail requests to
LISTSERV@PUCC.bitnet, not to PSYC@PUCC.bitnet

To get a list of all PSYC files:

GET PSYC FILELIST

This will send you a file containing the names of all the available files.
Issuing the command INDEX PSYC will produce the same results. The file sent
by this command is not the same as the PSYC INDEX file, so it might be less
confusing to use the GET command rather than the INDEX command.

Then, to order an individual file:

GET fname ftype

fname and ftype are the CMS Filename and Filetype as listed in the PSYC
FILELIST file.

Listserv does limit the amount of data that a user can order in a single day.
Currently the limit is 3 Meg, so this will not affect PSYC users.

(2) Internet/Unix/ftp Retrieval of PSYCOLOQUY Archive

The PSYCOLOQUY archives are temporarily available by anonymous ftp, if you
have it. To retrieve a file by ftp from a Unix/Internet site, type either:

ftp princeton.edu
or
ftp 128.112.128.1

When you are asked for your login, type: anonymous

For your password, type: your-own-login-name@your-system-name

then change directories with: cd pub/harnad

To list the available files, type: ls

The archive files look like this: psyc.arch...

Next, retrieve the file you want with (for example): get psyc.arch.1.9

When you have the file(s) you want, type: quit

JANET users can use the Internet file transfer utility at JANET node
UK.AC.FT-RELAY to get BBS files. Use standard file transfer, setting the site
to be UK.AC.FT-RELAY, the userid as anonymous@edu.princeton, the password as
your own userid, and the remote filename to be the filename according to Unix
conventions (i.e. something like pub/harnad/psyc.arch.1.9). Lower case should
be used where indicated, using quotes if necessary to avoid automatic
translation into upper case.

------------------------
The above cannot be done form Bitnet directly, but there is a fileserver
called bitftp@pucc.bitnet that will do it for you. Send it the one line
message

help

for instructions (which will be similar to the above, but will be in the form
of a series of lines in an email message that bitftp will then execute for
you).
-------------------------
PSYCOLOQUY can also be accessed on Usenet as the moderated newsgroup
sci.psychology.digest but then you will regularly have to check Usenet for
new issues, because they are not automatically emailed to you as they are in
the Bitnet version.

>>> QUANTA - Science, Fact, and Fiction <<<

Quanta is the elctronic magazine of Science Fiction and Fantasy. Quanta has
been around since October of 1989, and publishes fiction by amateur and
professional authors from all corners of the net.  Quanta is published in two
formats, ascii text for reading on-line and PostScript for dumping to
PostScript laser-printers.

ISSN: 1053-8496

To Subscribe:

To receive more info on Quanta, or to be added to the distribution list, send
mail to one of the following addresses, depending on which version of the
magazine you'd like to receive.

quanta+requests-postscript@andrew.cmu.edu
quanta+requests-ascii@andrew.cmu.edu
or
quanta+requests-postscript@andrew.BITNET
quanta+requests-ascii@andrew.BITNET

Send mail only- no interactive messages or files please.  Note that if you
subscribe with a letter sent over BITNET, you will have the magazine sent to
you as a file over BITNET, whereas if you subscribe with a letter sent over
the Internet, the magazine will be sent to you as a series of mail messages.

Also, if you request it, I will put you on the "FTP" list which means you
will get a notice when a new issue comes out, directing you how to pick it up
from one of the servers.  This is to save wear and tear on mailer machines
and to generally spread the load of distribution over a wider area.

Back Issues:

There are three FTP archives for Quanta issues and back issues:

Host:                   IP#:                    Directory:
______________________________________________________________________
export.acs.cmu.edu      (128.2.35.66)           /pub/quanta
eff.org                 (192.88.144.3)          /journals/Quanta
lth.se*                 (130.235.16.3)          /documents/Quanta

European service only

In all cases, use login name of "anonymous" and send your mailing address as
the password. When FTPing these files, make sure to select BINARY transfer
mode.

Back issues may also be obtained over AFS from the directory:
/afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr5/da1n/Quanta/Archive

If you have any questions or problems concerning FTP sites, or the AFS
directory, please mail them to quanta@andrew.cmu.edu so I can check up on
them.

Submissions:

Quanta needs stories.  What's in it for you, you ask?  True, Quanta can't pay
you for your submissions (yet), but getting fiction into Quanta means
distribution and recognition.  Quanta also publishes reviews, articles and
editorials.

Submitting material to Quanta is as easy as sending it to
quanta+@andrew.cmu.edu.  If your submission is already in LaTeX format, send
it in that format (RTF is also acceptable). Otherwise, send in straight ASCII
text.

>>> Religious Studies Publications Journal - CONTENTS <<<

- An all electronic, network distributed serial for Religious Studies

ISSN: 1188-5734

Purpose:

     To disseminate via the global computer networks;

     1) The table of contents, standard bibliographic information, abstracts
      and reviews of new and recent publications in Religious Studies

     2) Thesis and dissertations, subject bibliographies, glossaries, course
      syllabi and other pedagogical material.

     3) Software reviews of computer programs relevant to Religious Studies
      research

     4) Prepublication papers, dissertation abstracts, solicitations for
      manuscripts, and provide a central source of information on all
      networked documents of interest to Religious Studies and related
      fields.

Goal:

      To provide a comprehensive network distributed source of information on
      Religious Studies publications, pedagogical and research resources and
      software tools.


Overview:

      The Religious Studies Publications Journal - CONTENTS, subtitled the
CONTENTS Project, is a networked electronic journal that brings together
academic publishers and online scholars in Religious Studies and related
fields. This journal provides an information service to academic publishers
and the more than one thousand scholars in Religious Studies and related
fields who are online with BITNET, Internet, and other international computer
networks.  CONTENTS' primary function is the posting of table of contents,
standard bibliographic, pricing and ordering information, abstracts and
reviews of new books and journal issues of relevance to academics in the
broad field of Religious Studies.  This electronic journal also publishes
software reviews of programs essential to computer assisted research.
CONTENTS extends the scope of electronic publication by combining reviews and
abstracts with table of contents and ordering information of new books and
journals in print.  Publishers are encouraged to provide an electronic mail
contact address so as to enable CONTENTS' subscribers to order texts via the
network.  This electronic journal is designed in anticipation of the
developing commercialization of the academic networks and anticipates the
growing trend within publishing houses of accommodating individual chapter
and single article purchases.

      The CONTENTS Project operates by obtaining permission from participating
publishers to scan the table of contents from new and recent books and
journals and disseminates this information in electronic text to its
subscribers.  To the table of contents is added information on the publisher,
number of pages, price, abstracts and, if available, online ordering contact.
Publishers also are encourage to submit abstracts, book notes and reviews for
electronic republication.

      CONTENTS will also disseminate and archive information on works in
progress, conference announcements, solicitations for manuscripts, complete
dissertations, bibliographies, networked documents and audio-visual resources
of relevance to Religious Studies. All publication records posted by the
CONTENTS Project are archived via LISTSERV at Listserv@Uottawa or
Listserv@Acadvm1.Uottawa.Ca and may be searched or downloaded by the network
community.  Eventually, all CONTENTS records will be fully searchable as an
online public access database via TELNET.

      A supplement to CONTENTS, Lists in Review, provides an overview of many
of the Listserv lists (online academic conferences) of relevance to Religious
Studies.  A team of editors surveys individual lists and records lists of
subject keywords that will serve to indicate what has been discussed on any
given online conference.  These list summaries are compiled by the supplement
editor and posted as a short file to CONTENTS and archived on
a fileserver.  This collection will allow networked researchers to quickly
survey what has been discussed on dozens of lists and then retrieve past
conversations from a list's logbook.

The list will not be conversational.  Frequency of postings will depend on
the number of cooperating publishers.

      At present, the Religious Studies Publications Journal - CONTENTS, has
over five hundred subscribers in more than twenty four countries.

The Religious Studies Publications Journal - CONTENTS, team consists of:

>>> SOLSTICE: An Electronic Journal of Geography and Mathematics <<<

Solstice first appeared in the summer of 1990.  Solstice is an online,
refereed journal published by the Institute of Mathematical Geography
(IMaGe). It is transmitted, free of charge, to a distribution list of
subscribers twice yearly, on the astronomical solstices, over
bitnet/internet. The journal is typeset using TeX so that mathematical
notation may be sent as an ASCII file and downloaded as typeset notation by
the receiver (at receiver cost).  This procedure enables users to have
high-quality typeset copy using a program acceptable to conventional
publishers should they wish; hard copy is available from the Institute of
Mathematical Geography (currently at a cost of $15.95 U.S. (soft cover) per
year plus shipping). This is a cheap way, in terms of fiscal and
environmental costs, to create, typeset, and distribute a journal. Solstice
is copyrighted; typically, it includes original, refereed articles as well as
other material such as reprints and various features.

ISSN: 1059-5325

To Subscribe:

Write via electronic mail to Bitnet: Solstice@UMICHUM  Internet:
Sandy.Arlinghaus@um.cc.umich.edu or directly to Dr. Sandy Arlinghaus at the
address below.  Ask, in either case, to have your bitnet or internet address
added to the distribution list for Solstice and a free subscription will be
entered beginning with the next issue. Requests for hard copy should also be
sent to the same address. Hard copy is produced as needed directly from the
transmitted electronic file, with photos and difficult-to-transmit figures
scanned into the hard copy on a scanning digital copying machine. Hard copy
may be purchased in a soft-binding or in a hard-binding.

Submissions:

The purpose of Solstice is to promote interaction between geography and
mathematics. Articles in which elements of one discipline are used to shed
light on the other are particularly sought. Also welcome, are original
contributions that are purely geographical or purely mathematical. All
original articles are refereed. Invited articles and reprints are screened by
suitable members of the Editorial Board. IMaGe is open to having authors
suggest, and furnish material for, new regular features.  Authors should
submit manuscripts to the Editor-in-Chief. Manuscripts may be submitted as an
ASCII file, via bitnet or internet, or on a 5.25 inch high density diskette.
They may also be submitted as hard copy (in triplicate). Upon final
acceptance, figures in refereed papers must be drawn in Indian ink on
high-quality paper (or in some other acceptable manner negotiated on an
individual basis).  There are no page charges; authors will be given
permission to make reprints from the electronic file. The suggested format
for referencing an article is to cite the hard copy with page numbers in the
customary manner AND to cite the electronic copy as transmitted, complete
with facts of the transmission as they appear on the received header, as to
date and time of transmission. Cite field character count (to replace
pagination) of the article in accordance with specific instructions from
IMaGe.

Back Issues:

Back issues are available in hard copy from IMaGe---within the Monograph
Series of the Institute of Mathematical Geography; because they are produced
in an on-demand fashion, they do not go out of print. Warehousing is not a
significant issue in this mode of journal production. Current prices are
$15.95 for soft binding and $23.95 for hard binding. Shipping and handling
charges will be added. Back electronic files can be made available, but at a
cost; individual requests will be negotiated separately.

>>> TeX Publication Distribution List <<<

TeX-Pubs@SHSU.BITNET (TeX-Pubs@SHSU.edu) TeX-Pubs is a redistribution list
for TeX-related electronic form periodicals whch is being made available in
addition to INFO-TeX for your convenience.  The distribution of TeX-Pubs
includes TeXhax Digest, UKTeX, TeXMaG, the TeX Users Group's "TeX and TUG
News", and the "Frequently Asked Questions" and "Supplementary TeX
Information" posts from the comp.text.tex newsgroup.

The intent of TeX-Pubs is to allow users a single site for delivery of these
electronic form periodicals, as well as any others which may be brought to my
attention.  This list is offered in lieu of directly posting these documents
to INFO-TeX.  The decision to create a support list is in an effort to
provide this information to interested readers, but not replicate it for
those who wish to retain their current subscription(s) and not be bothered by
extraneous material on INFO-TeX.

There will be no direct archives for TeX-Pubs.  Instead, each of the included
periodicals will have its own directory available for retrieval from
FILESERV@SHSU.BITNET (FILESERV@SHSU.edu).

To Subscribe:

If you would like to subscribe to TeX-Pubs, please include the command:
SUBSCRIBE TeX-Pubs in the body of a mail message to LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET

>>> ALCTS Network News (AN2) <<<

AN2 aims to provide timely and comprehensive coverage of items of concern to
librarians engaged in collection management, acquisitions, cataloging,
serials, preservation, and the reproduction of library materials.  AN2 will
contain advance copy of articles and features that will appear later in the
print publication of the division, the ALCTS NEWSLETTER.  AN2 will also
feature late-breaking news such as ALA Annual and Midwinter conference
schedules (including meeting room locations) and reports shortly after the
conference of major actions and developments.  AN2 will also feature current
legislative news, news from the publishing world, and ALCTS candidates for
office and election results.  Although AN2 will duplicate some of the content
of the ALCTS NEWSLETTER, those columns that are not as time-dependent (such
as lists of new publications) will appear only in the print publication.

ISSN: 1056-6694

To Subscribe:

It is simple to subscribe to AN2, and it is NOT necessary to be a current
member of ALCTS nor a subscriber to any ALCTS publication.  On the Internet,

COSMIC's COSLINE:  About COSLINE

COSLINE is a 24 hour electronic information service to COSMIC's customers.
You can access COSLINE via telnet to cosline.cosmic.uga.edu or by setting
your modem to (1200/2400, 8,N, 1) and dialing either  (404) 542-7354 or (404)
542-7355. Although several terminal types are supported, you are encouraged
to use the DEC VT-100 driver which is provided by default.

Questions on using COSLINE or suggestions for improvement may be directed to
us in various ways:

COSLINE   use the "Comments to SYSOP" option under the "Utilities" selection
on the main menu

EMAIL     send an email message to us at service@cossack.cosmic.uga.edu

VOICE     call us at (404) 542-3265 and ask for COSLINE Support

FAX       send it to COSLINE Support at (404) 542-4807

U.S. MAIL COSLINE Support

Using COSLINE

Connect to COSLINE using either the telnet or dialup method as described
above.  When you have become connected you will be prompted for your name and
a password.  If you have not previously used COSLINE, you may simply press
your ENTER key to proceed to the next prompt which allows you to identify the
type of terminal you are using.

COSLINE is a full screen application and although the use of special keys is
kept to a minimum, we do require that your terminal or emulator understand a
minimal number of screen control escape sequences for the terminal type you
select. Experience suggests that the DEC VT100 driver (vt100) so we have
made that the default.

The main COSLINE menu is oriented horizontally and the user may highlight a
particular selection using the left and right cursor keys.  Certain main menu
options entail submenus and the user may select from these vertical submenus
by using the up and down cursor keys.  Once the desired selection has been
highlighted, simply press the key marked ENTER or RETURN and located near the
alphabetic character keys.

Beyond the catalog Search option most of the screens are informational in
nature and are therefore implemented as text file browsers.  Browsing is
facilitated by the use of the (F)orward and (B)ack alphabetic keys.  To
return to the menu you may always select (Q)uit.  Certain browsers also allow
you to (L)ocate a particular string and a number may allow you to (S)ave
to buffer.

By default, new users are provided with a "buffer" of  approximately ten
thousand characters.  The COSLINE user may elect to write certain pieces of
information into this buffer during his current session.  The DOWNLOAD option
on the main menu provides the user with two ways of placing the contents of
this file on his/her local machine or printer.  One may elect to send the
file to  oneself as email or to collect it as a straight ASCII text stream.
The email option prompts for an address and then sends the text almost
immediately.  No checking is done on the address provided by the user and we
assume that your host is reachable by the internet.  The text stream option
was designed primarily for dialup users whose communications package supports
a text capture or log file feature wherein any text sent to the screen is
also placed in a file.  Any requisite flow control is assumed to be provided
by the communications link and is not moderated by COSLINE itself.

Catalog Search

The principle feature of COSLINE is the catalog Search facility. There is a
separate help file available for browsing from the Search main menu option.
Please feel free to experiment to isolate particular program of interest to
you.  Program information is savable to your buffer and downloadable as
described above.

Disconnecting from COSLINE

Please be certain to disconnect using the Exit option from the main menu.
This allows house cleaning to be executed in an orderly manner and also
returns control to the communications program on your end.

>>> Electronic Hebrew Users Newsletter (E-Hug) <<<

The newsletter is the successor to the print publication Hebrew Users Group
Newsletter which was edited by Jack Love, and emanated from the Berkeley
Hillel Foundation through 1989.  This incarnation is electronic-only, and is
mandated, like the original, to cover all things relating to use of Hebrew,
Yiddish, Judesmo, and Aramaic on computers.  It is released as time permits
and information demands, currently every 1-2 weeks.  This newsletter is
dedicated to the proposition that computers, to be useful, must be usable to
people working in all languages, at the convenience of those users.  In that
spirit, we print all questions pertaining to use of the Hebrew alphabet on
computers and answer all those that we can.  We encourage discussion on all
levels of computer facility--from new users considering looking for software
or Hebrew-related resources (educational, graphic, or otherwise), to
developer discussions on how the software should work (when it works :-)).
We also do our best to report on new software (or updates) of interest and to
serve as a general news source to the field.

>>> GNU's Bulletin:  Newsletter of the Free Software Foundation <<<

The GNU's Bulletin is the semi-annual newsletter of the Free Software
Foundation, bringing you news about the GNU Project.

The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions on
copying, redistribution, understanding, and modification of computer
programs.  We do this by promoting the development and use of free software
in all areas of computer use.  Specifically, we are putting together a
complete integrated software system named "GNU" (GNU's Not Unix) that will be
upwardly compatible with Unix.  Some large parts of this system are already
working, and we are distributing them now.

The word "free" in our name refers to two specific freedoms:  first, the
freedom to copy a program and give it away to your friends and co-workers;
second, the freedom to change a program as you wish, by having full access to
source code.  Furthermore, you can study the source and learn how such
programs are written.  You may then be able to port it, improve it, and share
your changes with others.

Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be
available.  By contrast, FSF concentrates on development of new free
software, working towards a GNU system complete enough to eliminate the need
to purchase a proprietary system.

Besides developing GNU, the Foundation has secondary functions:  producing
tapes and printed manuals of GNU software, carrying out distribution, and
accepting gifts to support GNU development.  We are tax exempt; you can
deduct donations to us on your tax returns.  Our development effort is funded
partly from donations and partly from distribution fees.  Note that the
distribution fees purchase just the service of distribution:  you never have
to pay anyone license fees to use GNU software, and you always have the
freedom to make your copy from a friend's computer at no charge (provided
your friend is willing).
To Subscribe:

For a paper GNUs Bulletin, send a self-addressed stamped envelope (US Postage
only) to:

Free Software Foundation

gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu

Including a small donation in U.S. funds would be appreciated.

We do not maintain a subscription list for the Bulletin.  It's too much
overhead.  Instead, read it in the gnUSENET newsgroup gnu.announce.  If you
don't have access to USENET news, then subscribe to the electronic mailing
list info-gnu (which is equivalent).  (Make your request of

>>> Hot off the Tree (HOTT) <<<

HOTT is an electronic newsletter from the UCSD Library's Technology Watch
Information Group (TWIG).  HOTT contains excerpts and abstracts of articles
from trade journals, popular periodicals, online news services and electronic
bulletin boards.  The featured articles cover topics relating to developments
and issues in computer technology, networking, information transfer and
retrieval and issues surrounding the providing of those services.

To Subscribe:

HOTT is available on MELVYL, the University of California online catalog.
Anyone with access to telnet, can telnet MELVYL (31.0.0.13) and "show hott".
E-mail subscriptions currently only available to UCSD staff.  USCD library
staff contact Walt Thompson, all other UCSD staff should contact Jim Madden.

(note:  the real reason for this is that our e-mail system can't create
distribution lists with external addresses.  It's not that I don't want to
send it off campus, it's just too much trouble to address it to each person
individually.)

>>> Laboratory Primate Newsletter <<<

The Newsletter provides a central source of information about nonhuman
primates and related matters to scientists who use these animals in their
research and those whose work supports such research.  The Newsletter (1)
provides information on care and breeding of nonhuman primates for laboratory
research, (2) disseminates general information and news about the world of
primate research (such as announcements of meetings, research projects,
sources of information, nomenclature changes), (3) helps meet the special
research needs of individual investigators by publishing requests for
research material or for information related to specific research problems,
and (4) serves the cause of conservation of nonhuman primates by publishing
information on that topic.  As a rule, research articles or summaries
accepted for the Newsletter have some practical implications or provide
general information likely to be of interest to investigators in a variety of
areas of primate research.  However, special consideration will be given to
articles containing data on primates not conveniently publishable elsewhere.
General descriptions of current research projects on primates will also be
welcome.

ISSN:  0023-6861

To Subscribe:

The Newsletter appears quarterly and is intended primarily for persons doing
research with nonhuman primates.  Students should ask their department or
library to subscribe to the paper version.  Back issues may be purchased for
$2.00 each.  Subscribers outside the United States are asked to pay US$6.00
per year mailing charges (US$12 for air mail).  (Please make checks payable
to Brown University.) Readers with access to electronic mail may receive the
non-graphics contents of each issue by sending the message subscribe LPN-L
your-own-name  to  listserv@brownvm.brown.edu

Submissions:

The publication lag is typically no longer than the 3 months between issues
and can be as short as a few weeks.  The deadline for inclusion of a note or
article in any given issue of the Newsletter has in practice been somewhat
flexible, but is technically the tenth of December, March, June, or
September, depending on which issue is scheduled to appear next.  Reprints
will not be supplied under any circumstances.

Articles, notes, and announcements should be submitted in duplicate and all
copy should be double spaced.  Articles in the References section should be
referred to in the text by author(s) and date of publication, as for example:
Smith (1960) or (Smith and Jones, 1962).  Names of journals should be spelled
out completely in the References section.  Technical names of monkeys should
be indicated at least once in each note and article.  In general, to avoid
inconsistencies within the Newsletter, the scientific names used will be
those in Mammal Species of The World:  A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference,
J. H. Honacki, K. E. Kinman, and J. W. Koeppl (Eds.). Lawrence, KA: Allen
Press and the Association of Systematics Collections, 1982.  For an
introduction to and review of primate nomenclature see the chapter by Maryeva

>>> Law and Politics Book Review <<<

We seek to comprehensively review books of interest to political scientists
studying law, the courts, and the judicial process.  Reviews are commissioned
by the editor; they are published within a week of receipt.  However, the
Review is organized into 12 monthly issues for each annual volume.  The first
issue was March, 1991.  We try to review books within six months of their
publication (although we are still catching up from the backlog of unreviewed
books existing when we began operation).  Length of reviews varies from 750
to 2500 words.

Related List:

PSRT-L is a moderated discussion list on Bitnet which deals with issues of
interest to professional political scientists, both researchers and teachers.
Submissions from all sub-fields of political science as well as related
disciplines are encouraged.  The list is not intended to serve as a public
forum for debate over current issues in politics, as other lists already fill
that niche.  Rather it is intended to provide an opportunity for political
scientists to present their ideas and ongoing research for discussion, to
consider the directions in which the discipline is advancing, and to
encourage the dissemination of new concepts in research and teaching.  In
addition to ongoing discussions, the list editors would like to post
announcements of job openings and upcoming conferences.  PSRT-L also
publishes The Law and Politics Book Review.  Finally, a series of files are
available though listserv.

>>> List Review Service <<<

The LIST REVIEW SERVICE quantitatively and qualitatively explores e-mail
distribution lists (primarily BITNET LISTSERV Lists). The cataract of
information available to those with network access make all but the most
cursory examinations of lists possible.  Akin to book and restaurant reviews,
each issue begins with a narrative description of usually one week's worth of
monitoring, then presents simple statistical data such as the number of
messages and lines, number of queries and non-queries, number of subscribers
and countries represented, list owner, location, and how to subscribe.

The editor sees the publication as a means to cross-fertilize user
perceptions of network resources (i.e., active proselytization for
cyberspace). The service attempts to explore as wide a range of lists as
possible, from the hard sciences to the fuzziest of the humanities.

>>> Machine Readable Texts News <<<

The purpose of Project Gutenberg is to encourage the creation and
distribution of English language electronic texts.  We prefer the texts to be
made available in pure ASCII formats so they would be most easily converted
to use in various hardware and software.  A file of this nature will also be
made available in various markup formats as it is used in various
environments.  However we accept files in ANY format, and will do our best to
provide them in all.

We assist in the selection of hardware and software as well as in their
installation and use.  We also assist in scanning, spelling checkers,
proofreading, etc.  Our goal is to provide a collection of 10,000 of the most
used books by the year 2001, and to reduce, and we do mean reduce, the
effective costs to the user to a price of approximately one cent per book,
plus the cost of media and of shipping and handling.  Thus we hope the entire
cost of libraries of this nature will be about $100 plus the price of the
disks and CDROMS and mailing.  Currently the price of making CDROMS is said
to be about $500 for mastering and then $5 per copy.  I have it on fairly
good authority that these prices are negotiable, and as actual cost, the
price per CDROM is about $1.80.

Therefore, we call on all interested parties to get involved with the
creation and distribution of electronic texts, whether it's a commitment to
typing, scanning, proofreading, collecting, or what ever your pleasure might
be.

Please do not hesitate to send any e-texts you might find to this address.
If you prefer sending disks, a mailing address follows.  We hope to be
thanking you soon for your participation.

>>> Network Audio Bits and Audio Software Review <<<

Network Audio  Bits and  Audio Software Review is an electronic audio
magazine devoted primarily to Compact Disc and Vinyl LP Record reviews.  I've
also recently begun covering some 'underground'/independent types of
material. Issues feature both above and below ground reviews, news and
information.  Many forms of music are represented in the 'pages' of Network
Audio Bits.  So far reviews have covered Rock and Roll, Folk, R&B, Pop, Funk,
World music, Jazz and some underground music.

To Subscribe:

Subscriptions to Network Audio Bits and Audio Software Review are available
by sending your name and network address to MURPH@MAINE.BITNET.  Upon receipt
of your mail, you will be added to the subscription list and will have
N-Audio Bits sent to you starting with the next issue.  I've gotten fairly
comfortable with putting out an issue every two months.  I've considered
trying to do this monthly, but the amount of time and work involved (in
addition to a real job and family life) make monthly publication unlikely in
the near future.  Should you lose your network access or have a change of
network address, please send mail to have your subscription address changed
or deleted.

Back Issues:

Back issues are currently available via anonymous FTP at dg-rtp.dg.com
(128.222.1.2).  The back issues are in the "pub/AudioBits" directory when
they login as "anonymous" and their "username@system" for password.  If
Internet access is not available, e-mail can be sent to me at
MURPH@MAINE.BITNET and I will e-mail back issues.

Submissions:

If you are interested in reviewing either audio hardware or software, feel
free to discuss the details of reviews with the editor.  It would be best to
query the editor to make sure that the item you wish to review is acceptable.
Reviewers are encouraged to cover any and all types of music.  Completed
reviews should be sent to the editor MURPH@MAINE.BITNET.  I would like to
keep hardware reviews to a minimum, perhaps one or two reviews per issue, as
I would like to focus on audio software and especially Compact Discs.

Album/CD Review Guidelines:

What I look for in a review is writing that shows that you have not only
heard the album, Compact Disc or cassette which you are reviewing, but that
you have also listened to it.  The manufacturing of CDs has caught up enough
so that I'd like to feature new releases.Or, in the case of a title which is
finally being released on CD, new reissues.  Heck, I guess there are a number
of LPs that might be worthy of mention if they are being reissued as well.
Unfortunately, the LP is becoming scarce in the world of hi-tech digital
wizardry.  I would also prefer that cassettes be reviewed only when a
cassette is the only medium that the title has been released on.

Here's what I'd like as a general format for reviews.  All of the information
concerning the Disc or LP should be able to be found on the album where all
credits are given.  The performance and sound quality scales are your
opinions.

Title
Artist
Producer(s)
Engineer(s)
Label/Catalog #
Playing Time
Song Titles
Rating (between 1 and 5 stars ) optional
What format was reviewed (CD, LP, Cassette)
Release date
SPARS code (For CDs - will explain below)
----------
And review text, of course...

The SPARS code represents a standard proposed by the Society of Professional
Audio Recording Studios (SPARS).  Many CDs have this three letter code
printed somewhere on their information booklets.  The three letters
correspond to the type of recorder used for recording, mixing and mastering
of the disc (analog or digital).  For example, a disc with the code "ADD"
would show that the disc was an analog recording, mixed and mastered
digitally.

>>> Principia Cybernetica Newsletter <<<

Newsletter for the participants and people interested in keeping informed
about the Principia Cybernetica Project (PCP). PCP is a computer-supported
collaborative attempt to develop an integrated evolutionary-systemic
philosophy or world view. Its contributors are distributed over several
continents and they keep contact mainly by electronic mail (mailing list
PRNCYB-L), also by annual meetings, the printed (and electronic) Newsletter,
and postal mail. PCP focuses on the clear formulation of basic concepts and
principles of the cybernetic approach. This should lead to a semantic network
of concepts and links, implemented as a hypertext. The PCP philosophy starts
from the self-organization of multi-level systems through blind variation and
natural selection. This leads to a process metaphysics, a
constructive-selectionist epistemology, and an evolutionary ethics.

To Subscribe:

Send a 1 to 2 page letter, giving your address and affiliations and
motivating your interest in the Project to the Newsletter editor (F.
Heylighen). For the electronic mailing list: send a similar message to the
List owner (C. Joslyn). The subscription is free.

repair, delivery functions and others -- to central computer systems with
handheld terminals and wireless data networks. The Teleputing Hotline has
covered this trend since its inception, and will expand its coverage. We're
also increasing our depth in 1992, with more commentary, and more long
stories where industry leaders can give their views in their own words.

>>> TitNeT --  Titnews --  Titnotes <<<

TitNet is the electronic mail network of the International Tit Society
(TITS), currently having about 150 members world-wide.  Titnet posts three
formal series:

1) TITNET is the listing of electronic mail subscribers, their email
addresses, their institutional affiliations, and their research interests (in
terms of species of birds studied and biological topics of study).  TITNET is
cumulative, each posting repeating information of previous posting that is
still current.

2) TITNEWS is the forum for exchange concerning academic activities.  It
consists of two types of postings: single-topic issues and multiple
announcements.

3) TITNOTES is the forum for exchange of information about tits (and other
hole-nesting birds).

TITNET, TITNEWS AND TITNOTES are numbered serially with Arabic numerals and
posting date.  Followups on single-topic TITNEWS and TITNOTES postings are
given a letter designation following the Arabic numeral of the original
posting.

TitNet and its postings TITNET, TITNEWS and TITNOTES is less than a year old,
having been created by the International Tit Society at its meeting in
December 1990 in conjunction with the International Ornithological Congress
in Christchurch, New Zealand.  Because Titnet and expected to grow only
moderately, it is not handled by a listserver and does not expect to create
archives accessible by anonymous ftp.  However, these and other options will
continue to be reviewed as Titnet develops.

>>> Instant Math Preprints (IMP) <<<

The IMP network has two parts.  One part is the IMP database of abstracts of
math preprints which can be easily searched by author, title words, abstract
words and other words.  This database is mounted on a computer at Yale
University.  The second part of the network consists of the full text of
preprints, in electronic form, accessible via anonymous ftp from computers at
the universities from which the preprints originated.  A complete description
of the network can be obtained from katherine_branch@yccatsmtp.ycc.yale.edu.

To Subscribe:

To use IMP via Internet, you need a copy of a communications program called
TN3270.  Using TN3270, connect to this  Internet address:
yalevm.ycc.yale.edu.
After the connection is made, you will be prompted:  USERID: Math1 (or Math2,
3, 4 or 5); PASSWORD: Math1 (or Math2, 3, 4 or 5); OPERATOR ID: Math1 (or
Math2, 3, 4 or 5)

You can obtain TN3270 via ftp, if not already available in your institution.
More detailed instructions are available from the email address given above.
For the SUN3 or SUN4, ftp noc.net.yale.edu, directory pub/sunn4-binary (or cd
pub/sun3-binary), filename tn3270.tar.z.  For the Macintosh, send an email
message to listerv@brownvm with the message "get tn3270 package" or ftp
brownvm.brown.edu, filenames tn3270.read-me and tn3d7.sithqx.  For Ultrix,
ftp uunet.uu.net, filename bds-sources/src/ucb/tn3270.tar.z.

Submissions:

Abstracts must be submitted according to certain conventions so that all
records in the IMP database are consistent.  Do not submit abstracts for
preprints until the preprint is available on your institution's "ftp"able
computer and instructions for downloading the preprint are included in a
README file on that computer.  The conventions for submissions of abstracts
and loading of preprints, the formats to be used, and a description of each
field in the record for the abstract are available from the email contact
address below.  Each abstract must be sent in a separate electronic email
message in the required format.
