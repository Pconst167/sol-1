This file is a description of the files contained in the directory
/misc/fun/urban.legends that relate to urban legends, the newsgroup 
alt.folklore.urban, and similar material.  What is an urban legend?  
Stealing Terry Chan's definition from the alt.folklore.urban FAQ list:

"An urban legend:
    * appears mysteriously and spreads spontaneously in varying forms
    * contains elements of humor or horror (the horror often "punishes"
      someone who flouts society's conventions).
    * makes good storytelling.
    * does NOT have to be false, although most are.  ULs often have a basis
      in fact, but it's their life after-the-fact (particularly in reference
      to the second and third points) that gives them particular interest."

My thanks to Terry Chan (twchan@lbl.gov) for providing most of the information 
provided here.

Note:  YuNoHoo (styri@hal.nat.no) maintains a semi-mirror of these files at 
       balder.nta.no in the /pub/alt.folklore.urban directory for those of you 
       on the other side of the Atlantic.

My thanks to Lance Moxley for originally giving me space for my archives.

Any complaints should be sent straight to hell along with the complainee.
Any questions, suggestions, or compliments should be sent to
Jason R. Heimbaugh (jrh@uiuc.edu).
