Here's my promised posting of internetwork mailing..  There was a
HUGE amount of mail in response to the original posting.. ppl are
really interested in this...  It took me 3 days to sort out all
the mail... 8-)
___________________________________________________________________________
Here is a summary of the current information at NETSERV about some
of the networks that are connected to the ARPA Internet (CSNET X25Net,
Arpanet, Mailnet, etc.) and to CSNET PhoneNet.
 
Please note that the use of the ARPA Internet is restricted to authorized
individuals and is regulated by the Defense Communications Agency.
==========================================================================
 
Internet ==> Internet  user@host.ARPA
 
Internet ==> PhoneNet  user%host@csnet-relay.ARPA
PhoneNet ==> Internet  user@host
                         Note: CSNET-RELAY rewrites the address and
                         appends ".ARPA" to the host name.
 
Internet ==> BITNET    user%host.BITNET@wiscvm.ARPA
BITNET   ==> Internet  BSMTP with "user@host.ARPA"
                         NOTE: SEE GATEWAY BSMTP FOR DETAILS OF BSMTP.
 
Internet ==> DEC ENET  user%host.DEC@decwrl.ARPA
DEC ENET ==> Internet  RHEA::DECWRL::"user@host.ARPA"
 
Internet ==> JANET     user%host.JANET@ucl-cs.ARPA
JANET    ==> Internet  user%host.ARPA@ucl-cs
 
Internet ==> MAILNET   user%host.MAILNET@mit-multics.ARPA
MAILNET  ==> Internet  user%host.ARPA@mit-multics
 
Internet ==> UUCP      user%host.UUCP@seismo.ARPA  or
                       user%host.UUCP@harvard.ARPA
                         Note: The seismo and harvard hosts use the
                         "pathalias" software to find the correct UUCP
                         routing address.
UUCP     ==> Internet  hosta!...!hostz!seismo!user@host.ARPA  or
                       hosta!...!hostz!harvard!user@host.ARPA
                         Note: "hosta" is the sender's nearest neighbor.
                         The sender must specify a UUCP routing path to
                         "hostz", a host with a direct connection to some
                         UUCP->Internet gateway, such as "seismo" or
                         "harvard".
 
Internet ==> XEROX     user.registry@XEROX.ARPA
                         Note: Do NOT use "%" between "user" and "registry".
                         Some Xerox registries are "pa" and "wbst".
XEROX    ==> Internet  user@host.ARPA
 
PhoneNet ==> PhoneNet  user@host
                         Note: CSNET-RELAY rewrites the address and
                         appends ".CSNET" to the host name.
 
PhoneNet ==> Internet  user@host
                         Note: CSNET-RELAY rewrites the address and
                         appends ".ARPA" to the host name.
Internet ==> PhoneNet  user%host@csnet-relay.ARPA
 
PhoneNet ==> BITNET    user%host.BITNET@csnet-relay
                         Note: Some PhoneNet hosts have software that
                         allows "user@host.BITNET".  Ask your CSNET liaison.
BITNET   ==> PhoneNet  BSMTP with "user%host@csnet-relay.ARPA"

BITNET   ==> Usenet       MAILER@PSUVAX1 using BSMTP

Lots of ppl inquired about this one...

To send from BITNET to Usenet, construct a file as follows...
