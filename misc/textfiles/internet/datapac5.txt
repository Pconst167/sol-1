                        terminal.  The "address" displayed is your
                        Datapac network address.  This message
                        indicates that you are connected to the
                        Datapac network.  Proceed with the call
                        request command.

(b)  {P,R} TERMINAL     This is a Datapac herald message for a PVC
                        terminal.  It indicates that you are
     (DESTINATION       connected to the network (address and
     ADDRESS LOGICAL    destination address)
     CHANNEL)

(c)  CLOSED USER GROUP  These messages indicate an error in the call
     ERROR INVALID      request command--correct and re-enter the
     ADDRESS, MORE      command.

                        syntax error in the command.  Correct it
                        and re-enter the command.

(n)  COMMAND            This message indicates that the command
     NOT ALLOWED        which was entered, although syntactically
                        correct, cannot be implemented either due
                        to the NIM state, or because it violates
                        and/or conflicts with the service options
                        selected --e.g., a call request command,
                        when an SVC is already established.

(o)  CALL CLEARED--     This message indicates that the destination
     DESTINATION BUSY   computer cannot accept another call.  Try

DATAPAC NETWORK MESSAGES
Service     - INTERNATIONAL SERVICE

DATAPAC INTERNATIONAL
=====================

There are several messages which may appear when you are accessing
foreign packet switching networks through the Datapac X.75 gateways.
All of these network-generated messages which are sent to a terminal,
are written as "DATAPAC:TEXT".  The TEXT will be one of the following
messages.  These messages may originate from within DATAPAC or from
within any foreign network that is involved in the call or call
attempt.

(a)  CALL CLEARED --     A network problem within a Datapac
     TEMPORARY NETWORK   or foreign network prevents either
     PROBLEM (XXY)       the requested call from being established
                         or the established call from being
                         continued.  Try again later.

(b)  CALL CLEARED --     Either the foreign network requested is not
     ADDRESS NOT IN      accessible from Datapac, or the foreign
     SERVICE (XXY)       network address specified identifies a non-
                         existent destination, i.e., the address is
                         not yet assigned or no longer assigned.
                         Verify with destination that the foreign
                         network is accessable from Datapac and that
                         the foreign network address is assigned.

(c)  CALL CLEARED --     The calling terminal is not permitted to
     ACCESS BARRED       establish an international call to the
     (XXY)               called destination address because of a
                         closed user group violation.  Verify
                         network address with destination.

(d)  CALL CLEARED --     Either the foreign network or the desti-
     COLLECT CALL        nation address is not willing to accept
     REFUSED (XXY)       the collect calls.  Verify the call
                         establishment procedures with destination.

(e)  CALL CLEARED --     The Call Request is considered invalid
     INCOMPATIBLE        by the foreign network mainly because of
     CALL OPTIONS        the incorrect number of digits in the
     (XXY)               foreign network address.  Verify foreign
                         network address with destination.

(f)  CALL CLEARED --     The destination is out of order, possibly
     DESTINATION NOT     because the destination's network access
     RESPONDING (XXY)    link is inoperative.  Try again later
                         and verify with destination.

(g)  CALL CLEARED --     The destination address called is fully
     DESTINATION BUSY    engaged (no logical channels available)
     (XXY)               and cannot accept another call at this
                         time.  Try again later.

(h)  CALL CLEARED --     This message indicates a protocol error at
     REMOTE PROCEDURE    the remote DTE interface.  Check with remote
     ERROR (XXY)         DTE  (destination).


Gateway Identification
----------------------

The network generated messages sent to Datapac ITI terminals include
a 3-digit field to identify the gateway involved.  This field is
shown as (XXY) for the network messages listed in above.

If the call has not been established, the XXY = 000.  If the call has
been established, then

XX = 2-digit Datapac Service Exchange (DSE) of the gateway node used
     for the call

Y = Gateway ID of the gateway used for the call.
