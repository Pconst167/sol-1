CRAM: the Cyberspatial Reality Advancement Movement

In an effort to bring valuable information to the masses, and
as a service to motivated information compilers, I
(L. Detweiler) will help others unfamiliar with Usenet
`publish' their documents for widespread dissemination via the
FAQ structure, and act as a `sponsor' knowledgable in the
submissions process. This document is being distributed under
this arrangement.

I have found these compilations tend to appear on various
mailing lists and are valuable enough to deserve wider
distribution. If you know of an existing compilation of
Internet information that is not currently a FAQ, please
contact me and I may `sponsor' it. The benefits to the author
include:

- use of the existing FAQ infrastructure for distribution:
  - automated mail server service
  - FTP archival
  - automated posting

- a far wider audience that can improve the quality, accuracy,
  and coverage of the document enormously through email
  feedback

- potential professional inquiries for the use of your
  document in other settings, such as newsletters, books,
  etc.

- with me as your sponsor, I will also take care of the
  technicalities in the proper format of the posted version
  and updating procedures, leaving you free of the `overhead'
  to focus on the basic updates alone

Send comments relating to the *distribution* of this document
(particularly relevant newsgroups not currently covered in
its current distribution) or inquiries on other documents to
me, L.Detweiler, <tmp@lamar.acns.colostate.edu>.

The choice of who I `sponsor' is entirely arbitrary. You always
have the option of handling the submission process yourself.
See the FAQ submission guidlines FAQ in news.answers.
