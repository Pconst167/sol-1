-2- Where can I find WIRED in the U.S.?
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The premiere issue of WIRED (1.1) hit the newsstands on Tuesday the 26th 
of January, 1993.

Our main distributor is ICD (a subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation) - so 
you should be able to find it at Waldenbooks, B.Dalton, Tower Records and 
Books, Brentano's, Scribner's, Barnes and Noble, Safeway, Albertsons, 
Software Etc., and selected computer bookstores and software stores that 
carry computer books and magazines. Other U.S. distributors include Ingram 
Periodicals and IPD. The first issue is absolutely sold out. To get a 
complete listing of which back-issues are available and how much they cost, 
send mail to subscriptions@wired.com


-3- How much does WIRED cost on the newsstand?
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Newsstand cover price in the U.S. is $4.95 and $5.95  in Canada. See below 
for subscription rates.


-4- How can I subscribe to WIRED?
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that WIRED is monthly, as a general rule in North America - from the 
date you subscribe, you should expect your subscription to start with the 
NEXT issue and not the currently available issue on the newsstands.

Following are WIRED's Monthly Individual Subscription Rates 
(effective Oct 18th, 1993):

(corporate/institutional rates are higher - please send mail to: 
subscriptions@wired.com for information on corporate/institutional pricing)

12 issues/one year:

           $39.95    (33% off the single copy price of $59.40)
                     (US$64 in Canada/Mexico - US$79 other countries)
                    
Two years (24 issues):

           $71      (40% off the single copy price of $118.80)
                    (US$119 in Canada/Mexico - US$149 other countries)

To subscribe to WIRED magazine (print version) over the phone (in the U.S.) 
via credit card, call 1-800 SO WIRED. Outside the U.S. - call 
+1 (415) 904 0660 or send a fax to +1 (415) 904 0669. 

Or send a check or money order (in U.S. dollars) to:

WIRED
P.O. Box 191826

-5- What services does WIRED Online offer?
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The WIRED Info-rama
------------------
The COMPLETE text (except advertisements) of all WIRED back-issues 
(*including additional text that is NOT in the magazine*) is available (for 
free) via our automated mailserver using basic Internet e-mail.
Check it out!

Send e-mail to: 

     info-rama@wired.com 

with no subject and with the words:

     get help

in the body of the message. This will return a message explaining how to 
use the Info-rama for retrieving WIRED files. Note, messages to the Info-rama
can have multiple requests, so long as each request appears on a separate 
line. Hence, to get both the help file and a complete listing of all the 
files available through the Info-rama, include another line in your message 
saying, "get master.index" such that your request appears as follows:

     get help
     get master.index

If your e-mail program automatically appends a signature to your e-mail 
messages you should designate the end of your request by inserting the word 
"end" on a line by itself immediately following the request and preceeding 
the signature. In this case your message to the Info-rama will look as 
follows:

     get <file>
     end

Back-issues of WIRED e-text are available on the Info-rama around the last 
week of the month of the issue date. 

WIRED "Hotwired" Mailing List
----------------------------- 
If you would like to receive future WIRED-related bulletins, you can
subscribe to our new Hotwired mailing list. To do so, just send e-mail
to info-rama@wired.com with the following line contained in the
message body:

   subscribe hotwired

This low-volume moderated list is a great way to keep abreast of important 
issues on the Digital Frontier and to find out about new services offered 
through WIRED Online.

WIRED Gopher
------------
Gopher is a menu-driven, cross-platform Internet text retrieval system. 
Developed at the University of Minnesota, Gopher is used at thousands of 
sites all around the world. The WIRED Gopher has a keyword search engine 
for all the articles in previous issues so you can easily search
for specific information.

To reach WIRED's Gopher, gopher to:

     gopher.wired.com <port 70>

Gopher is available for a number of computer platforms via anonymous FTP 
(file transfer protocol) from:
    
     boombox.micro.umn.edu  

Directory path:

     /pub/gopher/

WIRED on WWW (World Wide Web)
-----------------------------
World Wide Web is a cross-platform system of Internet networks for 
retrieving text, images, sound and video. WIRED's WWW site provides the 
text from the magazine as well as a variety of features found only through 
WIRED Online, such as a keyword search; an archive of information 
concerning the Clinton administration's attempts to institute the Clipper 
encryption scheme; a photo and text essay on a recent WIRED visit to Microsoft; original digital travelogs from the authors of "Roadside America" and the "Friendship Flight"- Siberian Biplane Adventure; as well as article text not appearing in print due to space considerations. Connected to the Net via a T1 line, it's in a continuous state of evolution and improvement.

To reach WIRED's WWW site point your WWW browser at:

     http://www.wired.com/ <port 80>

Currently, a public-domain browsing tool called Mosaic, from NCSA
(National Center for Supercomputing Applications) in Urbana-Champaign,
IL, is the most popular client interface for accessing the WWW. In
terms of Internet traffic and use, it is one of the fastest growing
applications in the world -- and has great potential for innovative
uses in the future. You must have access to a live Internet connection
to use Mosaic, however. Mosaic, for use on the Macintosh, Microsoft
Windows, or X-Windows system, can be obtained via anonymous FTP. The
host address is:

     ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu

Directory path:

     /Mosaic/

If you do not have a live Internet connection but do have dialup ASCII 
access (if you are uncertain as to what this means consult your Internet 
service provider), WWW can be accessed via a software client called Lynx. 
For an explanation of features and a demo, telnet to:

     www.cc.ukans.edu

and login as:

     www

Lynx Version 2.2 is now available for anonymous ftp from:

     FTP2.cc.ukans.edu    

Directory path:

     /pub/lynx/lynx2-2.tar.Z and/or
     /pub/lynx/lynx2-2.zip

WIRED on Various BBS'es and Online Services
-------------------------------------------
WIRED maintains a presence on America Online, and The WELL, as
well as the Usenet newsgroup alt.wired.

(NOTE: For some of our overseas subscribers, the only cost-effective
way to access some of these systems is via telnet over the Internet).


-6- How do I participate in WIRED electronic discussions?
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WIRED on the WELL
-----------------
The WIRED conference on the WELL (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) was the 
first place that WIRED Online opened a public forum back in 1992. The 
WELL's headquarters are in Sausalito, CA. Conversationally, there's always 
something interesting happening here. You can download bonus WIRED text 
from this forum as well. The WELL offers online conferencing capabilities, 
as well as access to USENET news and other Internet tools. As it is on the 
Internet, it is accessible internationally. 

 Connecting:
   Modem:         dial +1.415.332.6106, 2400, N, 8 1
                    "  +1.415.332.8410, 9600, N, 8 1
   Telnet:        telnet well.sf.ca.us 
   Guest account: Type "guest" at the login prompt
   More info:     telephone +1.415.332-4335
   Status line:   1-800-326-8354 (from U.S. phones, a 24 hr. recorded message)
   Finding WIRED: type "g wired" from any "OK" prompt


WIRED on America Online
-----------------------
WIRED has been on America Online (AOL) since June 1993. Currently
WIRED's area on AOL offers the ability to discuss WIRED with both AOL
members and WIRED workers, the ability to browse or download the plain
text contents of WIRED back-issues, as well as a chat area. AOL
headquarters are in Vienna, VA. Not accessible via the Internet
(except through e-mail), membership to AOL is limited to people living
in the U.S. Once connected to AOL go to:

     keyword: wired

 Software:

  Most major computer (and several consumer) magazines have either
  tear-out cards or floppy disks that offer a route to subscribe 
  to America Online. By using one of those business reply cards, 
  you'll get client software (DOS, Mac or Windows) and five 
  free hours of access time. 

 Connecting:

  The complete instructions for getting connected to AOL come with
  the free floppy disk.
 
America Online (U.S. offices): +1 (800) 827 6364


ALT.WIRED (on Usenet)
---------------------
WIRED does not officially support alt.wired on Usenet -- the world's 
largest free-wheeling and anarchic electronic conferencing system. However, 
occasionally we do post items of general interest to the Usenet community. 
The volume of traffic on alt.wired is high and new participants can easily 
be overwhelmed by the intensity of conversation there. It is perhaps best 
compared to a fire-hydrant of commentary and passionate opinions, both 
positive and negative.

 Connecting:

  Contact your local Netnews provider to get a Usenet feed that subscribes
  to alt.wired.

Best,
