~Subject: Summary: Providers With Wide Area Access

       PDN holonet, michnet, portal, psi-gds, psilink, well, world
       800 class, dial-n-cerf-usa, jvnc, OARnet

"PDN" means the provider is accessible through a public data network
(check the listings below for which network); note that many PDNs
listed offer access outside North America as well as within North
America.  Check with the provider or the PDN for more details.

"800" means the provider is accessible via a "toll-free" US phone
number.  The phone company will not charge for the call, but the
service provider will add a relatively large surcharge to cover the
high cost of the 800 service.  Other long-distance options are
generally cheaper.

If you are not local to any of these providers, it's still likely you
are able to access those providers available through a public data
network (PDN).  Check the section above for providers with wide area
access.

phone book or with your phone company.

Most providers listed here are also accessible by packet-switched data
services such as PC Pursuit ($30/month for 30 hours off-peak 2400 bps
access -- call 800-736-1130 for more information), traditional long
distance services, and of course telnet.

~Subject: What *Is* The Internet?

The Internet is a global cooperative network of university, corporate,
government, and private computers, all communicating with each other by
means of something called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol).  Computers directly on the Internet can exchange data quickly
and easily with any other computer on the Internet to download files, send
email, provide remote logins, etc.

Users can download files from publicly accessible archive sites ("anonymous
FTP"); login into remote computers (telnet or rlogin); chat in real-time
with other users around the world (Internet Relay Chat); or use the newest
information retrieval tools to find a staggering variety of information
(Wide Area Information Servers, Gopher, World Wide Web).

Computers directly on the Internet also exchange email directly and very
quickly; email is usually delivered in seconds between Internet sites.

Sometimes the Internet is confused with other related networks or types of
networking.

First, there are other ways to be "connected to the Internet" without being
directly connected as a TCP/IP node.  Some computers connect via UUCP or
other means at regular intervals to an Internet site to exchange email and
USENET newsgroups, for instance.  Such a site can provide email (though not
as quickly as a directly connected systems) and USENET access, but not
Internet downloads, remote logins, etc.

"email" (or "Internet email", "netmail") can be exchanged with a wide
variety of systems connected directly and indirectly to the Internet.  The
email may travel solely over the Internet, or it may traverse other
networks and systems.

"USENET" is the collection of computers all over the world that exchange
USENET news -- thousands of "newsgroups" (like forums, or echos) on a wide
range of topics.  The newsgroup articles are distributed all over the world
to USENET sites that wish to carry them (sometimes over the Internet,
sometimes not), where people read and respond to them.

The "NSFNET" is one of the backbones of the Internet in the US.  It is
funded by the NSF, which restricts traffic over the NSFNET to "open
research and education in and among US research and instructional
institutions, plus research arms of for-profit firms when engaged in
open scholarly communication and research."  Your Internet provider
can give you more details about acceptable use, and alternatives
should you need to use the Internet in other ways.

~Subject: What The PDIAL Is

This is a list of Internet service providers offering public access
dialins and outgoing Internet access (ftp, telnet, etc.).  Most of
them provide email and USENET news and other services as well.

If one of these systems is not accessible to you and you need email or
USENET access, but *don't* need ftp or telnet, you have many more
public access systems from which to choose.  Public access systems
without ftp or telnet are *not* listed in this list, however.  See the
nixpub (alt.bbs, comp.misc) list and other BBS lists.

Some of these providers offer time-shared access to a shell or BBS
program on a computer connected directly to the Internet, through
which you can FTP or telnet to other systems on the Internet.  Usually
other services are provided as well.  Generally, you need only a modem
and terminal or terminal emulator to access these systems.  Check for
"shell", "bbs", or "menu" on the "services" line.

Other providers connect you directly to the Internet via SLIP or PPP
when you dial in.  For these you need a computer system capable of
running the software to interface with the Internet, e.g., a Unix
machine, PC, or Mac.  Check for "SLIP", or "PPP" on the services
line.

While I have included all sites for which I have complete information,
this list is surely incomplete.  Please send any additions or
corrections to "kaminski@netcom.com".

Fees are for personal dialup accounts with outgoing Internet access;
most sites have other classes of service with other rate structures as
well.  Most support email and netnews along with the listed services.

"Long distance: provided by user" means you need to use services such
as PC Pursuit or other long distance services.

by modem as instructed below.
