     the Ada Repository on SIMTEL20; it serves two purposes: to provide an
     information exchange medium between the repository users and to mail

     files named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one
     into another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve
     disk space, all the mail files in the archive, except for the current
     year, are individually compressed.  The compressed files have the
     suffix -Z as part of the filetype field; they should be renamed to
     have the suffix .Z (uppercase Z) when transferred to a Unix system so
     the uncompress program will find them.  The current month's mail is
     still kept in ADA-SW-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in
     directory:  PD2:<ARCHIVES.ADA-SW> Archive files are available via
     ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL for those with TCP/IP access
     to the Internet.

     directories are organized by topic, and their names and a brief
     overview of their topics are contained in file

     from this list, problems, questions, etc., should be sent to

     everyone can put the network to the best possible use.

     Alternate paths/addresses: The list is served by 5 servers
     (ADVISE-L@UTORONTO, ADVISE-L@CANADA01, ADVISE-L@NCSUVM, ADVISE-L@UGA,
     and MD4F@CMUCCVMA) which are peer linked so that anything sent to one
     will be sent to the other two automatically.  ADVISE-L@NCSUVM is
     probably the closest server to the CUNYVM Internet gateway.

     To subscribe to the list:

     From a VM site on BITNET do:  TELL LISTSERV at CANADA01 SUBSCRIBE
     ADVISE-L Your_Full_Name where Your_Full_Name is your real name (not
     your userid).

     From a VMS BITNET site use the SEND/REMOTE command.

     If you are at a site not on bitnet or where you cannot send
     interactive messages you can send a message to
     LISTSERV%CANADA01.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU where the first non-header
     line consists of:  SUBSCRIBE ADVISE-L Your_Full_Name

AI-MEDICINE@MED.STANFORD.EDU

     ai-medicine is an unmoderated mailing list serving internet and bitnet
     domains since Sept. 1990. Current readership consists mainly of
     computer scientists and engineers with interest in biomedical and
     clinical research, and of physicians with interest in medical
     informatics.

     AI in Medicine is a broad subject area which encompasses almost all
     research areas in artificial intelligence. For the purposes of this
     mailing list, AI in Medicine may be defined as "computed-based medical
     decision support" (or "computer-assisted medical decision making").
     This definition may be expanded to include AI-based approaches to
     computer-assisted medical instruction. According to this definition,
     topics such as billing systems and hospital/medical office information
     retrieval systems clearly remain outside the scope of this forum.

     There are some borderline topics which cannot readily be classified
     under AI in Medicine, yet have clear connections to both artificial
     intelligence and medical practice. Processing and interpretation of
     medical images and signals are among those subject areas, and the
     current readership of this list contains a substantial number of
     researchers working in these fields. These borderline subject areas
     will remain within the scope of the list, as long as the focus lies on
     the artificial intelligence aspects, and not the detailed engineering
     principles.

     Who may join: any individual or organization with internet or bitnet
     mailing addresses may join.

     Requests for subscription may be sent to:
     ai-medicine-request@med.stanford.edu

     List address for unmoderated distribution of messages:
     ai-medicine@med.stanford.edu

     from medical journals, and from interviews with scientists, physicians
     and other health practitioners, and persons with AIDS or ARC; it does
     not recommend particular therapies, but seeks to increase the options
     available.  The ethical and public-policy issues around AIDS treatment
     research will also be examined.  AIDS Treatment News, Northern Lights
     Alternatives, and many other publications are also distributed to this
     list.

     Users outside Bitnet should use the appropriate gateway to send mail
     to LISTSERV@RUTVM1.BITNET.  The text of the message should be the
     single line:  SUBSCRIBE AIDSNEWS Your_Full_Name

     To protect privacy the subscriber list is kept confidential.  If you
     have any problems subscribing to the list send mail to the
     Coordinator.

AJBS-L on LISTSERV@PUCC.BITNET                           [Last Update 4/93]
     or LISTSERV@PUCC.PRINCETON.EDU

     AJBS-L is the electronic communications network for the Association of
     Japanese Business Studies. Subscription is free and open to anyone who
     can access a BITNET or INTERNET electronic address.

     A. Policy Statement: AJBS-L Activities AJBS-L is a "business and
     economics" communications network for the Association of Japanese
     Business Studies. Any activity by AJBS-L subscribers which would
     normally be conducted between business and economics faculty,
     students, and business practictioners is allowed and encouraged, and
     definitely not restricted in any manner. The faculty and students of
     colleges of business at the university level are expected and required
     to closely interact and assist the business community. Therefore, as
     AJBS-L editor and as a full-time business faculty member, I welcome
     and encourage full AJBS-L participation from the business community.

     B. Present Activities of AJBS-L

     1. E-mail Once a user subscribes to AJBS-L, (s)he may send mail to the
     list for distribution to all its members. All members of the mailing
     list will receive a copy of each piece of mail sent to the list.  All
     of the mail that is received and redistributed by the list is
     cataloged and stored in a database that can be searched or retrieved
     by individuals with access to AJBS-L.

     In order to prevent "rapid-fire" random e-mail transmissions, all
     messages are relayed to the AJBS-L editor for a weekly (normally every
     Monday) batch mail release. In addition, each subscriber may disable
     the automatic AJBS-L e-mail transmission to their site and download
     logfiles of each month's traffic.

     2. AJBS-L Filelist Datafiles are available for downloading. The
     objective is to develop a clearinghouse of information on the business
     and economic systems of Eastern European countries.

     To receive the current listing of files, send the following to the
     LISTSERV (not to AJBS-L), with the following:  GET AJBS-L FILELIST

     a) File Downloads GET filename filetype AJBS-L

     For example, GET AJBS-L INDEX

     b) File subscriptions Specialized information or information which is
     too large for normal e-mail is placed in AJBS-L datafiles for
     downloading by subscribers. Details of the current datafiles are found
     in AJBS-L INDEX.

     You may "subscribe" to a datafile in one of two ways: 1) automatic
     downloading of the entire file to your address with each update; 2)
     automatic notification that the file has been updated. You may
     terminate this file subscription upon demand.

     Send the following to the LISTSERV (not to AJBS-L) at PUCC:  1) To
     download one file, one time, without subscribing:  GET filename
     filetype AJBS-L

     Example, GET AJBS-L INDEX 2) To receive automatic file downloads
     (AFD=automatic file distribution) upon file updates:  AFD ADD filename
     filetype

                    Example:
                    AFD ADD AJBS-L INDEX

ALLMUSIC%AUVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

     Mailing list is dedicated to the discussion of all forms of music, in
     all its aspects.  It's founding is based on the understanding that
     most people who listen to and enjoy music do so from a variety of
     standpoints, and that a general, unlimited forum is desirable for both
     the integration and expansion of musical ideas, techniques, and
     understanding.  Therefore, all topics having to do with music are
     welcome, including but not limited to:  composition, performance,
     recording; research, critique, inquiry, advocacy, instrument design,
     ethnomusicology, psychacoustics, orchestration, jazz, classical, funk,
     plainchant, and anything else you can think of.  If a topic is running
     that you have something to say about, or to question, jump in.  If you
     have something entirely different in mind, start up another thread.
     Music is universal.  With the advent of electronic communication, so
     are we.

     To be added to or deleted from the list, send mail to the Coordinator.

     files named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one
     into another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve
     disk space, all the mail files in the archive, except for the current
     year, are individually compressed.  The compressed files have the
     suffix -Z as part of the filetype field; they should be renamed to
     have the suffix .Z (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so
     the uncompress program will find them.  The current month's mail is
     still kept in AMETHYST-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in
     directory:  PD2:<ARCHIVES.AMETHYST-USERS> Archive files are available
     via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL for those with TCP/IP

     willing to share information are more welcome than people with
     questions.  Netters who know of good guides not listed here are

     telecommunications, and a monthly electronic report to which they are
     encouraged to contribute announcements and information.  This report
     often provides members with new information about the use of computers
     in some aspect of their disciplines, as well as news of more
     conventional developments in the field.  We also have projects
     underway to encode databases which members may use in their own work.
     To this end, we are now working on the details of distributing to the
     membership a database of all manuscripts written or owned in England
     before 1100.  We would be glad to add your name to our directory and
     thus to make you a member of ANSAXNET.  Membership is free to everyone
     with access to a BITNET node.

     Anyone who wants to be a member of ANSAXNET should send e-mail to the
     Coordinator, including a conventional mailing address and some
     information about your particular interests in early medieval cultural
     studies.

     The Animal Rights Alerts mailing list has been set up to facilitate
     communication among Animal Rights groups, activists, and other
     interested individuals.  Its primary purpose is to enable rapid
     dissemination of important information about Animal Rights issues.
     This venue, it is hoped, will serve as an important adjunct to
     periodicals such as Animals Agenda and Animals Voice.

     The list will be unmoderated and will not be available in a digest
     format at present.  Any information pertaining to Animal Rights or to
     issues that relate to Animal Rights, such as habitat destruction, are
     welcome.

     Please realize that this list is a public forum and as such it may not
     be the appropriate place to discuss your group's strategic plans.

     To join the Animal Rights Alerts mailing list, send the command

     subscribe ar-alerts

     in the body of a message to "majordomo@ny.neavs.com".  Please note
     that this format is different from a normal listserv subscribe request
     since it does not include your name.  If you want to subscribe
     something other than the account the mail is coming from, such as a
     local redistribution list, then append that address to the "subscribe"
     command; for example, to subscribe "program-staff":

     assortment of editors (editorial board, consulting editors, special
     issue editors, and associate editors/jurors/referees/readers)
     columnists, and correspondents.

     The journal will be distributed in collaboration with existing
     discussion groups, networked archival systems, and libraries.  The
     journal will be issued monthly commencing with the first issue on
     March 15, 1993.

     Deadlines for the submission of manuscripts will be the first of the
     month preceding the next issue.  Articles will be 5-20 type-written
     pages in APA form and style and in ASCII format.  All manuscripts will
     be given at least two blind reviews by a jury of referees.  Authors
     will be notified within twenty days after receiving their manuscript
     of the disposition of the manuscript.

     When appointments are made announcements will be widely distributed to
     the chief executive officers of the appointees' institutions,
     professional organizations and media, and computer teleconferences.
     All submissions and communication about manuscripts will be by

ARACHNET@acadvm1.uottawa.CA                  [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     A Loose Association of Electronic Discussion Groups and Electronic
     Journals of Interest to Scholars.

     There are more than 600 discussion groups, newsletters, digests and
     electronic journals devoted to topics of scholarly interest.  As more
     scholars come on-line, the size of these groups, the diversity of
     material they have to offer, and their total number are all bound to
     increase.  These groups could benefit from a loose confederation that
     would allow them to share resources easily without imposing any kind
     of restrictions on their manner of operation.  Arachnet is such a
     confederation.

     Arachnet is a ListServ list, Arachnet@Uottawa.BITNET or
     ARACHNET@ACADVM1.  Uottawa.CA if you are on the Internet.  All editors
     of discussion groups, newsletters, digests and electronic journals are
     invited to be members.  On its file-server, Arachnet will contain a
     current list of its member groups, descriptions of each group, and
     lists of files they hold.  As well as the current Directory of E-mail
     Based Conferences and Electronic Journals.  Arachnet's fileserver will
     also hold various information files pertaining to the creation of
     e-serials.

     The conversational component will be a means by which editors of new
     groups can receive help from their colleagues on questions of
     editorial policy and the social/ethical aspects of electronic
     conferencing.  Arachnet is not intended to replace Lstown-L@INDYCMS
     which is a discussion list for listowners to discuss technical aspects
     of Listserv based discussion group management.

     Arachnet will be an unedited list but will accept postings only from
     Arachnet subscribers.  If you are an editor or owner of an existing or
     future e-mail based forum, you are cordially invited to join.

     Please fill out the attached e-form and return it to one of the
     Editors listed below.  Please follow the format below as closely as

ARPANET-BBOARDS@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU
     ARPANET-BBOARDS@LCS.MIT.EDU

     Redistribution address for all known BBoards on the ARPANET.  The
     guidelines for postings are somewhat loose.  The ostensible purpose of
     the list is to distribute: (a) emergency notices ("Southern California
     just slid into the Pacific, machines at ISI and UCSD will be down for
     a few days"), and (b) notices of "academic interest", such as seminar
     and symposium announcements.  Advertisements and for-profit notices
     are not appropriate (the DoD would get upset, among other
     considerations).  A touchy borderline case is job offerings.  The
     practice has been to accept postings from universities (the research
     community) and the research oriented military installations (the
     people paying for our hardware) but to refuse postings from private
     companies.  The (shaky) rationale behind this is that university and
     military job offerings are "research opportunities" as opposed to
     for-profit advertisements (ie, joining the army or a university is not
     the way to get rich).

     Anyone is welcome to redistribute Arpanet-BBoards; it takes some of
     the (considerable) load off of MC's mailer.  But please don't do it
     without sending a message to the -Request address first.

     There are Archive copies of every message ever sent to the list but no
     guarantee is made that they will be online or available at any
     particular time.  The current archive file, such as it is, can be
     found as "COMAIL;BBOARD ARCHIV" on MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to the Coordinators.  Bitnet users may
     subscribe to the list by doing:  TELL LISTSERV at RUTVM1 SUBSCRIBE
     ARPABBS Your_Full_Name where Your_Full_Name is your real name (not
     your userid).  From a VMS BITNET site use the SEND/REMOTE command.

ARTNET@UK.AC.NEWCASTLE                       [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     The list is for anyone who has or who may have an interest in network;
     installation; project; communication; temporary; ad-hoc; transient;
     mobile; time-based; formless; de-centred art.  Potential members
     include artists, art-administrators, writers, theorists, students,
     teachers.  The aim of the list is to encourage contributions from all
     who have dipped a toe into these waters and found them congenial, but
     who know not where to turn next.  The idea is that alliances will be
     formed, projects launched, funding gained, technology utilised, ideas
     launched and wild speculation indulged in.  I hope that art projects
     will be instigated via this list.  It is within my desire for the list
     that it evolves.

     The list encompasses:

        *Projects            *New work               *Events
        *Collaborations      *Funding                *Technology
        *Shows               *Jobs                   *Conferences
        *Proposals           *Organisations          *Information
        *Publications        *Education              *Wild speculation


     ARTNET provides a forum for the discussion of ART that is concerned
     with: network; installation; project; communication; temporary;
     ad-hoc; transient; mobile; time-based; formless; de- centred.  I call
     this PERIPATETIC art.

     I define peripatetic art thus:  The art or action of creative
     endeavour with lack of fixed base.  There is no fixed centre which
     claims to have 'the knowledge'.  All projects involve some aspect of
     lack of enclosure; the promotion of action without centre.
     Peripatetic art tends towards the transient, the time based, the
     mobile.  Peripatetology is as much about receiving the action, the
     project, as it is about initiating it.

     I am concerned with improving communication amongst those working in
     these and related areas.  By its nature this kind of work often does
     not lend itself to easy documentation or definition.  The concept
     mooted here, and encapsulated in the term 'peripatetic', has by its
     very nature a changeable agenda.  I hope that in action we will create
     new ways of working alongside some very old human desires.

ART-SUPPORT@NEWCASTLE.AC.UK                  [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     Art-Support exists as a forum for the discussion of ART related
     matters.  Potential members include artists, art-administrators,
     writers, theorists, students, teachers and others with an interest in
     art.

     This list provides a general magazine type information exchange and
     discussion area.  As in any specialist magazine there will be much of
     interest to subscribers and also some irrelevance.

     Although not in any way subscription/geographically limited, the focus
     of the list is intended to be the UK art community.  It is hoped that
     the list will stimulate the use of network resources.  The idea is
     that alliances will be formed; projects launched; funding gained;
     technology utilised; ideas launched and wild speculation indulged in.

     ART-SUPPORT is about ART, not technology.  Any art or art related
     subject is acceptable.

     The list encompasses:

        *Projects            *New work               *Events
        *Collaborations      *Funding                *Technology
        *Shows               *Jobs                   *Conferences
        *Proposals           *Organisations          *Information

AVIATION@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU

     Aviation discusses topics of interest to pilots, including training
     systems, laws affecting availability or usability of airports, planes,
     and procedures, characteristics of aircraft and avionic products,
     comments on commercial aviation, such as safety and convenience
     issues, occasional advertisements for fly-ins or similar private pilot
     activities, historical notes, whatever else the readership wants.
     Aviation serves as an Internet gateway for the rec.aviation discussion
     on usenet.  It is distributed in the form of a daily digest.

     Due to disk space limitations, archives are only maintained for the
     previous few weeks of digests.  They are maintained on the host
     MC.LCS.MIT.EDU in files named:  AVIATN;DIGEST <number> Where <number>
     is the issue number of the digest.

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to AVIATION-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

     technology; also calls for papers, anouncements for seminars, etc.,
     can be sent to the list.  Although the list has its origin in the
     AVIATION digest, subjects related to aviation theory, like spaceflight
     technology, may be discussed as well.  Topics open for discussion are:

     Calls for papers Aerodynamics Aircraft structures Seminar anouncements
     Flight mechanics Aircraft materials Books to be published Stability
     and Control and others...

     A mailing list for INTERNET and BITNET has been created already and we
     are looking for someone who would like to create the USENET group, so
     we can create digests from those messages.

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to
     aviation-theory-request@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

     Baltic Republics news and development list

     BALT-L is an online forum devoted to communications to, and about, the
     Baltic Republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. It aims to further
     networking with those countries, in two senses of that word:  the
     technical one of establishing the basic links to permit electronic
     communications; and the softer definition of a network of people
     building up people-to-people contacts and working together on matters
     of common interest. A core aim of this list is to foster practical
     projects.

     Subscription to this list is welcomed from anyone with skills or
     interests relevant to the Baltics, or who just wants to know whats
     going on.

     We hope in particular to bring together

     Participants living in the Baltic Republics.  People around the world
     with origins in the Baltic Republics, or who have connections with
     those countries.  Anyone with technical skills in electronic
     networking who may want to contribute to developing electronic links
     to the Baltic Republics.  Anyone needing to research on developments
     in the Baltics.  Anyone around the world with a need to contact, visit
     and/or work with College staff or students living and working in
     Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia.

     Although English is likely to be the lingua franca, ALL languages of
     communication are WELCOME: but especially in Lithuanian, Latvian or
     Estonian.

BELIEF-L on LISTSERV@BROWNVM

     Personal Ideologies Discussion List

     This list is designed to be a forum where personal ideologies can be
     discussed, examined, and analyzed.  Topics for the list can range from
     "what is good" to "what happens after death" to "is there a god".

     This list is designed to be open to members of ALL religious and
     political faiths or non-faiths; we do not discriminate based on
     religion, race, gender, sexual preference, handicap, et cetera.

     The list is open for all discussion pertaining to ideological,
     religious, moral, and ethical topics.  There are only four general
     rules:

        1. Treat everyone's faith as if it were as sacred as your own.
           In fact, to be safe, treat their faiths BETTER than your
           own.
        2. Excessively rude, obnoxious, or abusive posting will not be
           tolerated.
        3. Personal attacks will NOT be tolerated.  Take your fights
           to e-mail where they belong, NOT in public.
        4. Due to the varied nature of computer systems, please take
           into account that not everyone has the time or disk space
           to read several thousand lines of BELIEF-L mail per day.
           If you have a large amount of material to send to the list,
           please do one or more of the following:
           [a] Announce that you have something you'd like to discuss,
           and solicit opinions from from the list as to whether it
           would be o.k.  to bring it up.
           [b] Post in reasonably-sized "chunks" -- by my definition,
           in the range of 200 lines, once or twice a day at the most.
           [c] If you will be reposting or crossposting material from
           another source, announce that you have it, and offer to
           send copies to interested parties.

     The first "rule" is really a guideline.  Proselytizing is OK, so long
     as you remember that you get what you dish out.  With respect to the
     second rule, please remember that you are a professional, and
     professionals don't get abusive to others.  If you violate the other
     rules, in the opinion of the List Owners, more than twice, you will be
     asked to stop.  If you continue to be abusive, you will be removed
     from the list.

     By signing on to this list, you acknowledge your right to critically
     respond to other's ideologies; you also acknowledge that your own
     ideologies can be critically responded to.  You agree to abide by the
     rules of the list, insofar as they are listed above, and may be added
     to in the future as need be.  You acknowledge the right of the list
     owners to have you removed from the list if you fail to abide by the
     rules.  Further, you agree that this list and all material herein is
     PRIVATE PROPERTY, and will not engage in cross-list or cross-person
     posting without prior permission, which will only be obtained publicly
     on the list.

     The opinions expressed on this list do not, unless explicitly stated,
     reflect the opinions of the United States, the universities or
     organizations of the members of this list, and are only the personal
     opinions of the list members.  Any liability, expressed or implied,
     rests with the individual list members.

     To subscribe to this list, send the command:

     SUBSCRIBE BELIEF-L your_name

     to LISTSERV@BROWNVM, where "your_name" is your full name (not your
     login Id).  Non-BitNet users can subscribe by sending the above

     The National Birding Hotline Cooperative

     We are pleased to announce that the National Birding Hotline
     Cooperative list on LISTSERV@ARIZVM1 has gone to a regional format.
     The three lists, which replace the former BIRD_RBA@ARIZVM1, provide a
     clearing-house for transcribed birding hotlines for three major areas
     of the country--East, West, and Central.  The new lists are BIRDEAST,
     BIRDCNTR, and BIRDWEST.

     Current subscribers to BIRD_RBA will be automatically shifted to all
     three of the new lists.  New subscribers must choose which of the
     three regional lists best answers their needs.  Of course, new
     subscribers may still subscribe to all three lists for full coverage.

     Subscribers are invited to submit transcripts from their area of the
     country if it is not already represented.  A current list of hotlines
     available from the National Birding Hotline Cooperative is appended.

     Contributions to the lists are always welcome and should be sent in
     MAIL format to BIRDEAST, or BIRDWEST, or BIRDCNTR, all at ARIZVM1.
     Please note that these are not intended to be general chat lists.
     Contributions should either be transcripts of birding hotlines or, if
     a local hotline recording is not available to you, concise statements
     of species seen and the location of the sighting, along with any
     relevant information such as 'out of range,' 'out of normal time
     frame,' etc.  If you are confused about which of the three lists to
     send your material to, contact either of the list owners first.  Their
     Bitnet/Internet addresses are listed below.

     You may subscribe to The National Birding Hotline Cooperative by
     sending an interactive SUBSCRIBE command or by including a SUBSCRIBE
     command as the ONLY line of a MAIL message to LISTSERV@ARIZVM1, as
     follows:

     Interactive example from CMS:

     TELL LISTSERV AT ARIZVM1 SUB BIRDEAST <Your full name>

     or BIRDCNTR or BIRDWEST

     MAIL example:

     SUB BIRDEAST <Your full name> or BIRDCNTR or BIRDWEST

     To cancel your subscription, issue the SIGNOFF command to
     LISTSERV@ARIZVM1:

     SIGNOFF BIRDEAST or BIRDCNTR or BIRDWEST

     Do NOT send SIGNOFF or other LISTSERV commands to BIRDEAST, BIRDCNTR,
     or BIRDWEST.

     If you are on the Internet network, subscription messages should be
     sent to LISTSERV@ARIZVM1.BITNET and hotline transcripts should be
     mailed to BIRDEAST@ARIZVM1.BITNET (or CNTR or WEST, as the case may
     be).  In some cases, Internet mailer programs will not know how to get
     to a local Internet/Bitnet gateway.  If this appears to be a problem
     for you, send subscription messages to:

     LISTSERV%ARIZVM1.BITNET@CORNELLC.CIT.CORNELL.EDU

     and hotline transcripts to:

     BIRDEAST%ARIZVM1.BITNET@CORNELLC.CIT.CORNELL.EDU or BIRDCNTR or
     BIRDWEST

     The following states are currently represented with transcribed
     hotlines on the three regional lists:

     BIRDEAST        Maine, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,
                     District of Columbia, Virginia

     BIRDCNTR        Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Texas

     BI-L on LISTSERV@BINGVMB

     BI-L is a computer conference dedicated to discussing ways of
     assisting library users in effectively and efficiently exploiting the
     resources available in and through the libraries of the 1990s.

     Contributors to the forum deal with the practical, theoretical, and
     technical aspects of what has been called Bibliographic Instruction,
     Library Use Instruction, Library Orientation, and several other names.
     We examine, explore, critique, appraise, and evaluate strategies,
     programs, and equipment that we have found to be valuable (or not) in
     working toward the goal of the self-sufficient library user.

     To join BI-L, send the following e-mail message to LISTSERV@BINGVMB:
     SUBSCRIBE BI-L Your Name.  (Put your first and last name where it says
     "Your Name.")

     To contribute to BI-L, send your e-mail message to BI-L@BINGVMB.
     ****NOTE that you send your message to the *list*, not to the list

BIO-NAUT%IRLEARN.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU
     BIO-NAUT on LISTSERV@IRLEARN.BITNET

     A mailing list for BIONAUTS has been established at IRLEARN The main
     purpose of the list is to facilitate communications between life
     scientists. This list will have three main functions.

        1. It can be used to ask questions about networking addresses
           of scientists in the biological life sciences.  e.g. I need
           to get in contact with some one at EMBL who should I send
           mail to.
        2. If you have small databases of E-mail addresses related to
           your particular field of interest they can be uploaded onto
           BIO-NAUT for the benefit of others. Special interst groups
           welcome.  e.g. Numerical taxonomists, Culture Collections,
           etc.
        3. If you subscribe you will be asked to send one message to
           BIO-NAUT which gives a brief outline of who you are and
           your main interests. Instructions on the format of this
           MESSAGE will be sent to all subscribers individually.

     To subscribe to the BIOSCI Bionauts distribution service at IRLEARN,
     send the following command as one line in the body of a mail message
     to LISTSERV@IRLEARN.BITNET saying just

     SUBSCRIBE BIO-NAUT forename surname

     Those of you who are directly on EARN or BITNET can also subscribe
     with an interactive message, e.g.

     TELL LISTSERV AT IRLEARN SUB BIO-NAUT forename surname (on an IBM
     running VM/CMS) or SEND LISTSERV@IRLEARN SUB BIO-NAUT forename surname
     (on a VAX running VMS)

     When you have done that, you will get an acknowledgement that you now
     belong to the distribution list. Once subscribed, you can send mail
     messages to

     BIO-NAUT@IRLEARN.BITNET

     and they will be AUTOMATICALLY redistributed to all the other
     subscribers. They (and you) can then reply to that address and
     everyone will see the answers.

     Remember

     The SUB command for subscribing goes to LISTSERV@IRLEARN.BITNET
     (LISTSERV%IRLEARN.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU for Internet users) Your mail
     messages for others to see go to BIO-NAUT@IRLEARN.BITNET

BIOMED-L%NDSUVM1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

     Mailing list for discussion on the topic of Biomedical Ethics.  Since
     the field of medicine and medical technology are rapidly changing and
     the field is so broad, it is difficult to have clearly delineated
     rules as to what should and should not be discussed, but possible
     topics might include:  Paternalism, Fetal Cell Transplant, The Right
     to Die, AIDS, Suicide, Patient Autonomy, Abortion, Drug Legalization,
     Euthanasia, Respirator Withdrawal, Transplants, Allocation of scarce
     resources and many others too numerous to list here.  The discussions
     may be ethical, philosophical, religious, political, social or even,
     in some cases, personal.  Open discussion, disagreement, and dissent
     is encouraged.  Open flames are most certainly *not*.

     To subscribe to BIOMED-L send the following command to
     LISTSERV@NDSUVM1:  SUBSCRIBE BIOMED-L your_full_name where
     your_full_name is your real name, not your userid.  Non-BitNet users

BIOSPH-L%UBVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

     This list replaces the now defunct list OZONE@ICNUCEVM.  The new name
     reflects better the topics discussed.  Anything relating to the
     biosphere, pollution, CO-2 effect, ecology, habitats, climate, etc.,
     can be discussed.  Basically anything that exerts an influence of some
     kind or another on the BioSphere.

     New archives will be stored in a monthly notebook.  Archives from the
     old Ozone List will eventually be transferred to the BIOSPH-L site.
     Even though there is no longer a connection to the owners of the old
     list, the idea is to continue on from the topics that were being
     discussed up to when it went dead.

     To subscribe send the following command to LISTSERV@UBVM.BITNET:
     SUBSCRIBE BIOSPH-L Your_full_name To leave or signoff the list send:
     SIGNOFF BIOSPH-L Non-BitNet users can [un]subscribe by sending the

BNFNET-Lon LISTSERV@FINHUTC.BITNET

     "BNFNET-MIRCEN" was established in 1990 by UNESCO's MIRCEN
     (Microbiological Resource Center) Network for Environmental, Applied
     Microbiological and Biotechnological Research for people who have a
     professional interest in biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). Members
     of BNFNET-MIRCEN primarily use computers to communicate with each
     other by electronic mail ("e-mail").

     The aims of the Network are the following :

        - to provide a forum for the exchange of information,
          experiences and scientific results on BNF
        - to foster better communication and cooperation among MIRCENs
          and between MIRCENs and other organizations
        - to encourage and help individuals to use e-mail for
          communications in BNF research

     BNFNET-L is the name of the electronic mail distribution list for
     BNFNET-MIRCEN. Membership in BNFNET-L is open to any individual who
     have a professional interest in BNF. To become a member of
     BNFNET-MIRCEN and thereby be included in its mailing list BNFNET-L,
     send the following message.

     SUBSCRIBE BNFNET-L <YOUR PERSONAL NAME> (e.g. SUBSCRIBE BNFNET-L Akiro
     Suzuki)

BUDDHA-L on LISTSERV@ULKYVM.LOUISVILLE.EDU   [Last Updated 28-January-1992]
     or LISTSERV@ULKYVM.BITNET

     BUDDHA-L provides a means for those interested in Buddhist Studies to
     exchange information and views.  It is hoped that the group will
     function as an open forum for scholarly discussion of topics relating
     to the history, literature and languages, fine arts, philosophy, and
     institutions of all forms of Buddhism.  It may also serve as a forum
     for discussion of issues connected to the teaching of Buddhist studies
     at the university level, and as a place for posting notices of
     employment opportunities.

     The primary purpose of this list is to provide a forum for serious
     academic discussion.  It is open to all persons inside and outside the
     academic context who wish to engage in substantial discussion of
     topics relating to Buddhism and Buddhist studies.  BUDDHA-L is not to
     be used for proselytizing for or against Buddhism in general, any
     particular form of Buddhism, or any other religion or philosophy, nor
     is it to be used as a forum for making unsubstantiable confessions of
     personal conviction.

     The discussion on the list is to be moderated, not in order to
     suppress or censor controversies on any topic, but rather to limit
     irrelevant discussions and idle chatter, and to redirect or return
     messages sent to the list by accident.  Content or style will never be
     altered by the moderator, whose only responsibility will be to forward
     all appropriate postings to the list.

     If you wish to subscribe to BUDDHA-L, send an e-mail message to
     LISTSERV@ULKYVM.LOUISVILLE.EDU, or BITNET nodes can send to
     LISTSERV@ULKYVM.  The message should contain only the following
     command (ie. in the body of the mail):

C+Health on LISTSERV@IUBVM                   [Last Updated 12-October-1991]
     or LISTSERV@IUBVM.UCS.INDIANA.EDU

     C+Health is intended to promote sharing of information, experiences,
     concerns, and advice about computers and health.  Anecdotal evidence,
     media reports, and some formal studies suggest that computer users are
     at risk from misuse and overuse of computers.  Eyestrain, headache,
     carpal tunnel syndrome, and other apparently computer-related maladies
     are increasing.  And, it would appear that colleges, universities, and
     other institutions have been slow to respond with education, training,
     office and lab design, furniture purchasing, and other programs that
     could make computing more healthful -- and productive.

     We welcome questions and answers; article and book reviews; hardware,
     software, and furniture evaluations; approaches to influencing
     institutional policy; speculation; and humor.  Medical, legal,
     technical, financial, aesthetic, and administrative viewpoints are
     encouraged.  We hope that this forum will be of interest to end users,
     computing managers, epidemiologists, and policymakers.

     Subscribers to this list may also wish to participate in EDUCOM's
     Project EASI: Equal Access to Software for Instruction, "dedicated to
     assisting higher education in developing computer support services for
     people with disabilities." EASI provides information and guidance on
     campus applications of adaptive computer technology.  For information
     on EASI, contact Carmela Castorina, CSMICLC@UCLAMVS.BITNET.

     In general, C+Health will focus on individual and institutional
     measures for "keeping healthy people healthy" as well as remedies for
     restoring temporarily disabled people to health.  We suggest that
     computing issues related to those with permanent disabilities be
     referred to our dedicated colleagues at EASI.  Although this
     distinction will not always be "easy," one goal of C+Health is to
     minimize the number of casualties in our increasingly
     computer-intensive campuses, offices, and homes.

     This list will not be moderated, at least initially, so we encourage
     contributors to be succinct, to include relevant parts of messages to
     which they are responding, and to append their names, titles, and
     institutions to contributions.  New users are welcome to send to the
     list a brief statement of their experiences and interests in this
     topic.  Unless stated otherwise, it will be assumed that contributions
     represent individual opinion rather than institutional policy.

     To subscribe to C+Health send mail with the following command to
     LISTSERV@IUBVM (from BITNET sites) or LISTSERV@IUBVM.UCS.INDIANA.EDU

     or LISTSERV@UAFSYSB.UARK.EDU

     The CAMPCLIM list was created to provide a forum for discussions
     pertaining to college campuses' personal, educational, and physical
     environments.  Possible subjects would include but are not limited to:
     campus race relations, sexual harassment, exterior lighting, fire
     regulations, handicap access.  It is hoped that subscribers would be
     able to specify how these issues are 'handled' at their campus.  For
     example, is there an ombudsman position?  How do campus committees
     with overlapping responsibilities communicate with each other?  What
     are the grievance procedures?  Is there a 'hate speech' policy?  Are
     athletes treated differently from the rest of the student body?  Yes,
     it's a broad area.  The list was started to assist a campus committee
     charged with looking into all these areas.

     To subscribe to CAMPCLIM, send the following command to

     with an interest in engineering and the sciences are invited to join
     in.  CCES-L presently has a large Canadian following, but there are
     also subscribers from the USA, Turkey, Saudia Arabia, Brazil, Taiwan,

CCNET-L%UGA.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

     Chinese Computing is a discussion group on technology relating to the
     use of Chinese on computers.  It is intended to be a forum for both
     experts and regular users and to reach wherever computer networks can
     reach, from North America to the Far East.  Although different people
     may have different definitions for Chinese computing, at it's current
     stage, the technology for Chinese word processing and desktop
     publishing software is in the greatest demand.  Discussions will
     concentrate on this technology as implemented in both software and
     hardware.

     The focus of the mailing list may change when other technologies
     become more important.  There have been suggestions that Chinese
     programming languages may be a requirement when Chinese data base
     software gets more popular.  The postings to this group may include:
     news of new software, hardware and technology, product reviews,
     comments, questions and answers.

     The list is unmoderated, and archives are available from LISTSERV@UGA.

     Additional Information

     2.  About messages posted in Chinese.

     A number of coding schemes have been developed for using Chinese on
     computers.  The two most common are GuoBiao (developed in mainland
     China) and Big5 (developed in Taiwan).  Complicating matters further,
     there are different varieties of Big5 codes, the most common being ET
     Big5 (the code used by the Taiwanese program ETen, pronounced
     Yi3tian1) and HKU Big5 (the code used for programs developed at Hong
     Kong University).

     There is a preference for GuoBiao (often abbreviated to GB) among
     CHPOEM-L subscribers, though files using other codes are welcome.
     Utilities are available for converting between GuoBiao and Big5, and
     between ET Big5 and HKU Big5; see below.

     Chinese files sent to the list should be uuencoded.  The uuencode
     command is included on most Unix-based systems; type "man uuencode"
     for instructions on its use, or ask your system administrator.  PC
     versions of uuencode and uudecode are available via anonymous ftp from
     ahkcus.org [192.55.187.25] as uuduue20.zip in the src/pc directory.
     (Ask your system administrator for help using FTP.)  For information
     about uuencode and the Mac, see the Mac help file mentioned below.

     Note:  Sometimes you may get an error message when uudecoding a file,
     indicating some kind of "short file" problem; garbage may then show up
     at the end of the decoded file.  This is be- cause the mail system
     removes blank spaces from otherwise blank lines.  When you uuencode a
     file, the next to last line is often just one blank space, which then
     disappears when you mail the file.  When you try to uudecode the file,
     uudecode detects the missing space and announces the "short file"
     error. There are two ways to avoid this problem:

     (1) Before mailing a uuencoded file, replace all spaces with an
     open-single-quote (`) mark.  (As far as uudecode is concerned, the `
     mark and space are exactly equivalent.)  If you receive a uuencoded
     file in the mail, but the sender neglected this step, simply type the
     ` mark in on the blank line above the "end" line, then uudecode the
     file.

     (2) Ask your system administrator to install a more recent version of
     uuencode that uses ` instead of space. Source code for this is
     available via anonymous ftp from ahkcus.org in the src/unix directory.

     To read a file written in Chinese, you will need a program that can
     interpret the Chinese code used in that file.  Different programs are
     available for different hardware platforms.

     PC users can get information about GuoBiao editors by sending email to
     LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with the message GET PC HELP.  HKU Big5 files can
     be viewed with shownews.exe or readnews.exe, available via anonymous
     ftp at ahkcus.org [192.55.187.25] in the src/pc/hku directory.  (You
     will also need the chinese.16 font file from the same directory.)  ET
     Big5 files must be read with the ETen operating system, which is
     commercial software selling for about US$80.  However there is a
     utility, et2hku, to convert ET Big5 files to HKU Big5 files, which can
     then be read with shownews.  (See below.)

     Mac users can get information about both GuoBiao and Big5 software by
     sending email to LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with the message GET MAC HELP.

     X Windows users can use either cxterm or xhzview for both GuoBiao or
     Big5 files.  For information about cxterm, send email to
     LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with the message GET CXTERM HELP.  For infor-
     mation about xhzview, send email to LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with the
     message GET XHZVIEW HELP.

     Note: Users may run into problems because different systems indicate
     line endings differently.  Unix-based systems use linefeed (ASCII 10,
     ^J) to end a line, the Mac uses carriage return (ASCII 13, ^M), and PC
     systems use carriage-return/linefeed.

     This usually can be solved by using an editor or automatically fixed
     though transferring process. If NOT, you can use the following
     methods:

     + MAC to UNIX convertion:

     At unix prompt type, tr '\015' '\012' < Mac_file > Unix_file

     + MSDOS to UNIX conversion:

     FTP folding.c from ahkcus.org:./src/unix.  Folding removes
     carriage-returns and, if desired, adds linefeeds according to a
     specified linewidth. Simply compile the source code and excute it for
     `how to use' message.

     [ ...... this section is not complete ]

     3.  Conversion Utilities.

     To convert between GuoBiao and Big5 (et or hku) files, use hc ("Hanzi
     Converter"), available via anonymous ftp from ahkcus.org
     [192.55.187.25] in the src/unix directory.  (There is another
     conversion utility available called b2g, but it seems to miss a large
     number of characters.)  Since Big5 covers about 5,000 more characters
     than GuoBiao, it's likely there will be a few missing characters in
     Big5 to GuoBiao conversions.

     To convert between ET Big5 and HKU Big5, use et2hku, available via
     anonymous ftp from cs.purdue.edu [128.10.2.1] in the pub/ygz/utils
     directory.

     4.  File naming conventions.

     The names of files containing poems should indicate the poet and, if a
     non-GuoBiao Chinese file, the coding standard used (et, hku, etc.).

     Since one goal of the list is to assemble a database of Chinese poems,
     there is a preference for using one uuencoded file per poem, and to
     number a poet's poems sequentially as they are posted to the list.
     For example, the first person to post a poem by Li Bai might name the
     file libai.001 (or, if an ET Big5 file, libai.001.et).  The next
     person would call his or her file libai.002, and so forth.

     Of course latecomers or those with short memories will not know how
     many poems by a given poet have already been posted to the list.  In
     that case, add your name or id after the poet's name and start your
     own numbering system.  For example, if your computer id were nw1, and
     you wanted to post a Li Bai poem but didn't know the number of the
     last Li Bai poem posted, you should name yours libai_nw1.001.

     Indexes of poems previously sent to the list will be distributed
     periodically.

     If you want to post a large number of files at once (say, more than
     three or four poems), we suggest you use the tar file archiving
     program.  Unix users can get instructions for tar by typing "man tar"
     at their system prompt, or by consulting their system administrators.
     There is a PC version of tar available via anonymous ftp at
     procyon.cis.ksu.edu [129.130.10.80] in the pub/PC/UnixLike directory.

     Try to use as reliable a source as possible when typing poems, and
     identify it in your message.  As a general rule, try to use the
     following format:

     line 1:  AUTHOR TITLE   ; (Poet's name, a space, then title of poem)
     line 2:  <blank line>   ; (Leave a blank line before starting text)
     line 3:  ...text...     ; (Text of poem)
       ...        ....

     Add your name and/or email id at the end, if you wish.

     5.  Still confused?

     If you have any questions, can't get software working, or whatever,
     try sending mail to the list.  Someone is likely to know the answer,
     or at least offer sympathy.

clay=xldev@cs.cmu.edu

     There is now an Excel Developers Mailing List on the internet.  Our
     reason for existence is to serve as a forum on the internet for people
     who are doing, or want to do, sophisticated things with Microsoft
     Excel, such as executive informations systems, numerical simulations,
     financial forecasts, or stock analysis programs.  We want to encourage
     exploration of Excel's nooks and crannies (Hey!  Undocumented: FOO.BAR
     macro works on arrays!), and as much as possible, avoid the well-worn
     paths (How do I insert rows?).  While we do expect some degree of
     sophistication from our posters, new or casual Excel users are welcome
     to read the list.

     For those with netnews access, one way to look at the list is as a
     sort of high-S/N, Excel-directed complement to comp.apps.spreadsheets.
     Some cross-posting is likely.  Traffic to date has been light.

     To subscribe, you *must* send mail to <clay=xldev-add@cs.cmu.edu>.
     Non-internet (e.g.  uucp, BITNET) subscribers should make sure that
     the "From:" field of their subscription message has an internet form.
     CompuServe users needn't bother, since CIS automatically converts
     their addresses.  Feel free to forward this announcement to interested
     parties or groups.

     CLOCKS is owned and coordinated by a computing professional who is
     greatly interested in clock and watch collecting and repair, with a
     greater emphasis on repair.

     Computers and Academic Freedom Mailing Lists

     Purpose: To discuss questions such as: How should general principles
     of academic freedom (such as freedom of expression, freedom to read,
     due process, and privacy) be applied to university computers and
     networks?  How are these principles actually being applied?  How can
     the principles of academic freedom as applied to computers and
     networks be defended?

     There are three versions of the mailing list.

     comp-academic-freedom-talk - you'll received dozens of e-mail notes
                     every day.

     comp-academic-freedom-batch - about once a day, you'll receive a
                     compilation of the day's notes.

     comp-academic-freedom-news - about once a week you'll receive a
                     compilation of the best notes of the week.

     To join a version of the list, send mail to listserv@eff.org.  Include
     the line "add <name-of-version>".  (Other commands are "delete
     <name-of-version>" and "help").  NOTE: This is NOT the same LISTSERV
     that is being used on BITNET sites.

     In any case, after you join the list you can send e-mail to the list
     by addressing it to caf-talk@eff.org.

     Alternatively, if you may be able to read the mailing lists as
     newsgroups.  Look for alt.comp.acad-freedom.talk and
     alt.comp.acad-freedom.news.

     The best notes from each month are available via anonymous ftp from
     eff.org as files "pub/academic/news/July", etc.  Also, see file
     "pub/academic/README".

     privacy.

     This list is gatewayed into the moderated USENET newsgroup
     comp.society.privacy.  In lot of ways it is a subsection of the risks
     digest concentrating on the risks of technology on privacy.

     This List is a forum for the discussion of software, hardware, LAN/WAN
     attachments, workstations, problems, etc.  In short, anything at all
     to do with networking.  It's called COMTEN-L because I'd like to see
     if there's enough interest in NCR boxes for us to do a little of our
     own self-help and design.  NCR has their so-called value added
     products, which make the network generations quite interesting
     compared to a vanilla NCP.  For now, just about any communications
     topic is fair game.

     To subscribe, send the following command to LISTSERV@UCSBVM.BITNET via

CONSBIO on LISTSERV@UWAVM.U.WASHINGTON.EDU               [Last Update 4/93]
     or LISTSERV@UWAVM.BITNET

     The Conservation Biology List (CONSBIO) is for members of the Society
     for Conservation Biology (SCB) and others interested in the goal and
     objectives of the Society:

     Our goal is to help develop the scientific and technical means for the
     protection, maintenance, and restoration of life on this planet - its
     species, its ecological and evolutionary processes, and its particular
     total environment.

     In the service of this goal, our objectives include: (1) the promotion
     of research and the maintenance of the highest standards of quality
     and ethics in this activity; (2) the publication and dissemination of
     scientific, technical, and management information; (3) the
     encouragement of communication and collaboration between conservation
     biology and other disciplines (including other biological and physical
     sciences, the behavioral and social sciences,economics, law and
     philosophy) that study and advise on conservation and natural resource
     issues; (4) the education, at all levels, preparatory and continuing,
     of the public, of biologists, and of managers, in the principles of
     conservation biology; (5) the promotion of all of the above through
     the provision of adequate funding; and (6) the recognition of
     outstanding contributions made to the field by individuals and
     organizations.

     The CONSBIO list is maintained by the University of Washington Chapter
     of the Society for Conservation Biology.  The list will serve to
     exchange information on SCB activities, job opportunities, education
     programs, and scholarly research.  The list will also serve as a forum
     for discussion of the multidisciplinary aspects of conservation
     biology, the interaction of science and society in conservation policy
     and action, and the relationship between maintaining biodiversity and
     sustainable development.

CONSIM-L on LISTSERV@UALTAVM (LISTSERV@VM.UCS.UALBERTA.CA)

     CONSIM-L provides an unmoderated environment for discussion of
     historical conflict simulation games, particularly the games published
     in Strategy and Tactics and Command magazines, but also including
     boxed games from such publishers as The Avalon Hill Game Company,
     Victory Games, and Game Designers Workshop.

     The explicit purpose of CONSIM-L is to provide a platform for
     discussion of recently published games, but discussion can range over
     the general topics of conflict simulation design, military history,
     tactics and strategy, game collecting, convention and club
     announcements, or any other topic related to conflict simulation
     games. As is the case on all unmoderated lists, the discussion and
     topics are only limited by the participation and interest of its
     subscribers.  Subscribers are welcome to take an active role by
     posting and/or an inactive role by monitoring the list.  Although not
     necessary for participation, it shall be assumed that all subscribers
     are basically familiar with board wargames.

     To subscribe to CONSIM-L, please send mail or file to LISTSERV@UALTAVM
     or listserv@vm.ucs.ualberta.ca and place in the body of the text the
     line

     SUB CONSIM-L <your name>.

     This list does not support any archive functions.

Contents on LISTSERV@Uottawa (BITNET)
     or LISTSERV@Acadvm1.Uottawa.Ca (Internet)

     This list will simply announce new and recent publications of
     relevance to Religious Studies and related disciplines.  It will post
     the table of contents, prices, and when available, abstracts of both
     books and journals.  These postings will be logged in notebooks for
     searching and, in future, made available as a TELNET accessable and
     searchable database.

     The Wilfrid Laurier University Press is the first to make this
     information available to the CONTENTS list.  I hope to soon convince
     the AAR and SBL presses to join in asap.  The rest should come running
     soon enough.

     The list will not be conversational.  Frequency of postings will
     depend on the number of cooperating publishers.  If the load gets
     heavy postings will be grouped together accounding to some extremely
     esoteric classification system.  There is the possibility that down
     the road, CONTENTS will also serve to distribute reviews from
     IOUDAIOS, RELIGION and other lists, if such a service is deemed
     useful.

     To subscribe to CONTENTS send the following email message to
     Listserv@Uottawa or Listserv@Acadvm1.Uottawa.Ca

     SUB CONTENTS your name

     Contact the list coordinator, Michael Strangelove, for more

     Any discussion which involves cross (inter/multi) disciplinary
     modeling and analysis and attempts to move beyond *intuitive*
     historical criticism is considered valid.  Such methodologies include
     and encompass social-scientific criticism, feminist hermeneutics,
     sociological exegesis, social history, political science,
     psychohistory, and anthropology (social, cultural, symbolic
     linguistic...).

CORROS-L on LISTRAL@IB.RL.AC.UK                          [Last Update 3/93]

     In order to provide a focus for corrosion discussions, and to
     encourage this form of communication, a Corrosion Interest List has
     been established.  The objective of the list is to provide a facility
     akin to a noticeboard, on which messages can be seen by all members of
     the list.  Currently the list is running on a computer at the
     Rutherford Laboratory of SERC in the UK, although the list is managed
     by Bob Cottis at the Corrosion and Protection Centre, UMIST.

     Joining the List

     There are two addresses associated with the list.  The first of these
     is a general address for all lists running on the computer in
     question, and is used for commands, such as requests to join or leave
     the list.  From the JANET network in the UK this address is LISTRAL
      UK.AC.RL.IB From outside the UK the components of the site address
     are reversed to give LISTRAL  IB.RL.AC.UK Commands consist of
     electronic mail messages containing one or more lines of instructions
     for the 'Listserver' program which manages the lists.  Some of the
     common commands are:

           SUBscribe CORROS-L <name>       ;join CORROS-L
           UNSUBscribe CORROS-L            ;leave CORROS-L
           HELP                            ;get a brief list of commands

     In the above description only the upper case letters need to be typed,
     and <name> means your name in the form in you wish to be known to the
     list (the Listserver works out your username and address for itself
     from the Return Address in your message).  The semicolon and the
     subsequent phrase are a descrition of the command, and should not be
     typed.

     Thus to join the Corrosion Interest List Jane Smith would send the
     message

     SUB CORROS-L Jane Smith to LISTRAL.

     Once you have subscribed to CORROS-L you will automatically be sent
     all correspondence which is sent to the list.  You can send your own
     messages for the list to CORROS-L  UK.AC.RL.IB (or CORROS-L
      IB.RL.AC.UK from outside the UK) (you can actually do this without
     subscribing to the list, but you won't be able to see any replies!),
     or in many mail systems you can simply Reply to messages from the
     list.

     The list is unmoderated (i.e. everything that is sent to the list is
     distributed automatically without any editorial control), please use
     it responsibly.  In particular do not use it for excessively
     commercial purposes, and do not send messages which are liable to
     offend.  You should assume that messages which are sent to the list
     become Public Domain unless there are clear indications in respect of
     copyright.

     list, contact:

COUNCIL on LISTSERV@SJSUVM1.BITNET                       [Last Update 5/93]
     or LISTSERV@SJSUVM1.SJSU.EDU

     Global Council Forum -- Moving Beyond the Nation-State

     COUNCIL has been created to provide an international computer forum
     for the discussion of the creation of a global council.  Its premise
     is that the world reality has moved beyond the nation-state, yet the
     world order still relies on this fragmentary concept and structure.
     The proposal is for the creation of a small, non-power-holding,
     non-bureaucratic council in East Africa, the birthplace of humanity,
     in the foreseeable future.  Seeking voices from outside North America
     for discussion.  To spur exploration of this issue, the list owner
     will post a short essay at least once a week, by 0900 GMT Wednesdays.

     To subscribe to this list, send the following note to LISTSERV@SJSUVM1

     or LISTSERV@nic.surfnet.nl

     CPS-L is an unmoderated discussion list for interdisciplinary studies
     of the Pacific regions. The list was created as a facility of the
     Centre for Pacific Studies at the University of Nijmegen, the
     Netherlands. The list is useful as a discussion forum for researchers
     (anthropology, history, linguistics, law ...). The list also serves as
     a mailing list of the Centre's activities concerning Pacific studies.

     Archives of CPS-L mail items are kept in monthly files. Archives of
     related files are available as a service to the subscribers. Related
     files are a researcher's name-directory and the electronic publication

CPSR on LISTSERV@GWUVM.GWU.EDU                          [Last Updated 9/92]
     or LISTSERV@GWUVM.BITNET

     Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) has set up a
     list server to (1) archive CPSR-related materials and make them
     available on request, and (2) disseminate relatively official, short,
     CPSR-related announcements (e.g., press releases, conference
     announcements, and project updates).  It is accessible via Internet
     and Bitnet e-mail.  Mail traffic will be light; the list is set up so
     that only the CPSR Board and staff can post to it.  Because it is
     self-subscribing, it easily makes material available to a wide
     audience.

     We encourage you to subscribe to the list server and publicize it
     widely, to anyone interested in CPSR's areas of work.

     To subscribe, send mail to:

     listserv@gwuvm.gwu.edu (Internet) OR listserv@gwuvm (Bitnet)

     With the following command in the BODY of the mail:

     SUBSCRIBE CPSR yourfirstname yourlastname

     You will get a message that confirms your subscription.  The message
     also explains how to use the list server to request archived materials
     (including an index of everything in CPSR's archive), and how to
     request more information about the list server.

     Please continue to send any CPSR queries to cpsr@csli.stanford.edu.

     If you have a problem with the list server, please contact the
     administrator, Paul Hyland (phyland@gwuvm.gwu.edu or phyland@gwuvm).

CREWRT-L@UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU                 [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     This list was created as a place to discuss how and why creative
     writing is being taught at colleges and universities, including the
     role it plays in the curriculum, the history of creative writing
     programs, the shape and flavor of creative writing courses, and the
     influence it has or should have on students' lives.  Any teacher who
     has ever taught a creative writing course (poetry or fiction) and any
     student who has ever taken such a course should feel welcome to
     participate.

     The list is open and unmoderated, so discussion can range as far and
     wide as members want, from ethereal theory to classroom strategies and
     anything remotely tangential to either.  However, this list is not
     intended to be a place for sharing creative work.  Not that such
     sharing is in any way forbidden, but there are other lists designed
     for that purpose.

ctt-Digest on LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET or LISTSERV@SHSU.edu

     ctt-Digest is a (most probably) multi-part daily digest of activity on
     the comp.text.tex newsgroup.  ctt-Digest is *not* intended to include:

        1. posts to comp.text.tex originating on INFO-TeX, nor
        2. those periodicals included on TeX-Pubs (i.e, Texhax Digest,
           UKTeX Digest, TeXMaG, the "Frequently Asked Questions" and
           "FAQ Supplement" posts from comp.text.tex, and TUG's "TeX
           and TUG News").  When these periodicals are removed, it is
           noted at the end of that issue.

     Daily digests are designed to keep distribution parts under 42k in
     size to accommodate as many mailers as possible.  Efforts are made to
     keep each comp.text.tex post in whole between parts (although certain
     size constraints may preclude this as a universal rule).  In general,
     each day's distribution has been between 1 and 3 parts, but the number
     of parts will vary directly with comp.text.tex activity, as well as
     how spontaneously our news feed keeps up with traffic to SHSU.  The
     ctt-Digest distribution is automatically processed and forwarded to
     subscribers at approximately 0200 Central Standard/ Daylight Time
     (US).

     The address <ctt-Digest@SHSU.edu> is restricted with respect to
     posting as it is purely a redistribution list.  The posting address
     via mail to access comp.text.tex remains INFO-TeX@SHSU.BITNET
     (INFO-TeX@SHSU.edu), although posts to INFO-TeX will not appear in
     ctt-Digest.

     If you would like to subscribe to ctt-Digest, please include the
     command:  SUBSCRIBE ctt-Digest "Your Real Name in Quotes" in the body
     of a mail message to LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET (LISTSERV@SHSU.edu).  Please
     note that this LISTSERV does *not* support interactive messages.

     If you have any questions or comments about this new service (or any
     of our TeX-related services), please contact me directly.

CUBE-LOVERS@AI.AI.MIT.EDU

     The Rubik's Cube mailing-list.  Much of the information in the
     Scientific American article was presented in Cube-Lovers first; also
     many mathematical discussions have taken place as well as the
     development of a cube notation and various transformations used to
     solve it.  Recently this list has been very quiet.

     Messages are archived in the MIT-AI files ALAN;CUBE MAIL(0 1 2 ...)
     with the most recent messages in ALAN;CUBE MAIL

     CUNYMUS@CUNYVMS1.CC.CUNY.EDU

     CUNYMUS is the list for students of the music programs of Graduate
     Center of the City University of New York.  The purposes of this list
     are:

     1) to provide students with discussions of music on a scholarly level,
     as befits students in a doctoral program (those who prefer more
     trivial discussions are directed to CLASSM-L@BROWNVM or
     rec.music.classical on USENET);

     2) to provide a forum for communication, since we have no campus on
     which we can regularly congregate and exchange ideas; and

     3) a means of keeping informed of activities taking place in the music
     programs.

     Though intended for students at the Graduate Center, students in music
     programs at other CUNY colleges are welcome as well.

     Students not from a CUNY school are encouraged to subscribe for the
     purpose of seeking the views of the students of CUNY.

CUMREC-L%NDSUVM1.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU                  [Last Update 4/93]

     The list is intended for anyone involved with computer use in college
     and university administration, especially for non-technical
     administrators; it is named after the annual conference.  Topics
     include, but are not limited to:

        - Purchase of administrative software from vendors--advice
          from some campuses that may not be on a vendors list of
          *showcases*
        - General purpose software and hardware purchase--not nuts and
          bolts, but some general sharing of ideas
        - You've decided to write a major administrative system from
          scratch-- will someone share something with you so you don't
          need to re-invent the wheel?
        - The CUMREC conference itself--sharing information, keeping
          in touch with people we've met at past conferences.
        - Just about anything that a CUMREC paper could be written on.

     To subscribe to the list, send mail to the Coordinator if you can't
     use LISTSERV commands or do:  TELL LISTSERV at NDSUVM1 SUB CUMREC-L
     your_full_name from any system that will let you use TELL or send the
     command::  SUB CUMREC-L your name as the only text in a message to
     LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.

     Note:  this list has the option SEND=PRIVATE which means that only
     people who are current subscribers can send to the list.  This is not
     intended to discourage participation, but to encourage subscription
     and to help avoid some types of mailer loops.  If you want to send
     something to the list, simply subscribe to the list first by following
     the above instructions.

CW-MAIL%TECMTYVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

     Mailing list for discussion of campus-wide electronic mail systems.
     The recent developments in computer networking have created the need
     for unified E-mail systems, capable of handling mail-type
     communications among users on many different kinds of computers
     (mainframes, superminis, minis, personal computers), working for the
     same organization.  This communication can be within the organization
     or directed to other users on the different networks (BitNet,
     Internet, etc.).  This list strives to provide a forum for developers
     of such systems.  Topics to be discussed are how to carry out such an
     effort, experiences in the implementation, recommended policies,
     hardware issues, etc.  It is aimed primarily (but not limited to)
     developers of university campus-wide e-mail systems.

     In an effort to assure a productive environment, subscription will be
     filtered by the list Coordinators, who may require additional
     information before a subscription request is accepted (curious
     bystanders clogging up the network are not desired).  The list itself
     is unmoderated.  Monthly notebooks are kept.

     BitNet users may subscribe by sending the following command to
     LISTSERV@TECMTYVM via interactive message or mail:  SUBSCRIBE CW-EMAIL
     Your full name where "Your full name" is your real name, not your
     login Id.  Non-BitNet users can join the list by sending the above
     command as the only line in the text/body of a message to

     the DDTs defect tracking sofware from QualTrak, including (but not
     limited to) software, methods, mechanisms, techniques, general usage
     tips, policies, bugs, and bug workarounds.  It is intended primarily
     for DDTs administrators, but that does not necessarily preclude other
     topics.

     To join the DDTs-Users mailing list, send the command

     subscribe ddts-users

     in the body of a message to "Majordomo@BigBird.BU.EDU".  If you want
     to subscribe something other than the account the mail is coming from,
     then append that address to the "subscribe" command; for example, to
     subscribe "my-other-address":

     subscribe ddts-users my-other-address@your.domain.net

     The list is an open list; anyone may subscribe.  I would like to
     discourage subscribing subsidiary redistribution points, because that
     makes administering the mailing list harder, but I do not forbid it.
     There is not yet either an FAQ list or a "digestified" version of the
     mailing list.

     Submissions should be sent to "DDTs-Users@BigBird.BU.EDU".  That
     address is a direct mail reflector; all messages sent to that address
     are immediately forwarded to every member of the mailing list,
     including the submitter.  The mailing list is unmoderated.

     All messages to the list are being archived, but no method has yet
     been provided for retrieving these archives.

     If you encounter a problem subscribing or submitting messages to the
     mailing list, you may send e-mail to the mailing list manager.
     Include detailed information on what the problem is.  If you get an
     error message, include that.

     members who don't like getting a lot of mail can receive it in a daily
     dose. If you want the digest version then send a note to the list
     owner once you are added to the list.

     DECNEWS is a new list for people interested in receiving a monthly
     electronic newsletter from Digital Equipment Corporation's
     Education/Science Business Unit.  The newsletter's purpose is to
     provide a single, compact source of information about Digital to users
     in educational institutions and research organizations.  Content
     includes brief announcements of new products, new third-party
     applications available on Digital platforms, special programs and
     services for education users (e.g.  TEI), resources, and new
     installations or innovations from Digital's education/science
     customers.

     Items will be brief, and pointers will be given on how to obtain more
     background information over the network if interested.  The conference
     is a moderated list, and only the monthly newsletter will be posted,
     plus an occasional special announcement.  Readers' responses will be
     directed to the newsletter's editor.

     Archives of DECNEWS and related files are stored in the DECNEWS
     FILELIST.  To receive a list of files send the command INDEX DECNEWS
     to LISTSERV@UBVM or LISTSERV@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU as the first line in

     LISTSERV@UBVM or LISTSERV@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU via a mail message
     (again, as the first line in the body of the mail, NOT the Subject).

     DECNEWS is also gatewayed into the bit.listserv.decnews news group of
     USENET News so if you have access to news reading software, you should
     read this list there to reduce unnecessary network traffic.

     American, Alaskan Native/American Indian...Caucasian American, Foreign
     (nonimigrant), including genders.  In terms of particular academic
     needs, we would like to have representative ethnic inputs into various
     academic programs.

     While the founders of the list are in the architectural area, they
     intend the list to be general.  Specific uses could be in terms of
     studio design problems, lecturers, exhibits, etc.  We would hope that
     we could enrich our studies in this way rather than focusing on any
     particular group.  We believe that every culture in America has
     something of value to contribute to the whole of American culture.

DOROTHYL on LISTSERV@KENTVM                  [Last Updated 12-October-1991]
     or LISTSERV@KENTVM.KENT.EDU

     DOROTHYL is a discussion and idea list for lovers of the mystery
     genre.  It was concocted by a group of women librarians at a July 1991
     Washington, D.C.  meeting of the Association of Research Libraries and
     named in in honor of one of the great women mystery writers of the
     century.  Agatha Christie and Josephine Tey were strong contenders,
     but Dorothy L. Sayers had a LISTSERV-blessed middle initial.  Although
     there was serious discussion about limiting DOROTHY to women
     particpants and it would be entertaining to identify impostors (no
     doubt men would sneak on with anonymous ID@node, to join in DOROTHY's
     energizing discussion), the organizers opted for the widest possible
     number of serious participants.

     Tenets of DOROTHYL:

        -Everyone is welcome.
        -Those who wish to adopt the name of a mystery character, may use
         that name in postings.
        -The participants WILL have fun.

     Some suitable subjects for posting are:

        - Announcements of forthcoming books and previews.
        - Reviews, criticisms, comments, and appreciations of
          mysteries (books, plays, films).
        - Great mystery bookshops.
        - Awards.  It can take a long time to learn which are the
          annual prizewinners.  DOROTHYL may consider posting these as
          files.
        - Mysterious events.  Mystery travels, mystery walks in
          cities, mysteries of life.
        - Ideas for happenings, perhaps an evening of mystery readings
          at ALA or ARL or MLA?
        - An electronic mystery, with clues (apples, perhaps red ones
          of the Macintosh variety?), villains (the mailer-Daemon?),
          red herrings (byte-marks?), heroines, detectives -- the
          potential is as unlimited as the world of networking.

     At the outset, the list will be un-moderated (self-monitored).

     Everyone who joins ought to consider contacting her (his) favorite
     mystery author and inviting her (him) to join this list.  Since many
     mystery writers are academics, this could be a very fruitful and
     exciting chase.

DTP-L on LISTSERV@YALEVM.BITNET

     Many users throughout internet, bitnet & elsewhere have expressed an
     interest in starting a digest to exchange information on desktop
     publishing in general, and on the subtleties and complexities of
     specific programs, including, but not limited to, Quark Xpress, Aldus
     PageMaker and FreeHand, Adobe Illustrator, Ventura Publisher,
     Framemaker, Interleaf, and Fontographer.  Please note that these would
     not be system level discussions; they would deal more at the
     user-level.  Also, technical discussions of PostScript for its own
     sake (and not how it related to these programs) would be covered in
     the PostScript forums and digests.

     Caveats aside, every user of these and other programs has discovered
     some excellent work-arounds, irritating problems, or elegant
     solutions.  These could be shared for the benefit of all.  I have also
     set up contacts with Quark, and I'm receiving quick shipment of
     Zappers and other software to be available to list members and the
     net_community at large.  Hopefully similiar agreements can be made
     with other publishers.

     Some emphasis will be placed on use of service bureaus and medium- to
     high-resolution output devices (Linotronics, Agfas, Varitypers, etc.)
     without becoming overly technical.

     The list organizers (myself and Jeff Wasilko of RIT) also have
     conventional typesetting backgrounds, and we manage service bureaus at
     our schools.

     The list is called DTP-L. To subscribe, execute the CMS command:  tell
     listserv@yalevm subscribe DTP-L firstname middleinit lastname

     Or send a mail to listserv@yalevm (or listserv@yalevm.ycc.yale.edu)
     which contains as its first & only line (substitute your name for
     firstname, etc.):

     subscribe dtp-l firstname middleinit lastname

     Because this is a digest, items of interest should NOT be sent to the
     listserver for efficiency's sake.  Send submissions to:

     glenn_fleishman@yccatsmtp.ycc.yale.edu or to jjwcmp@ultb.isc.rit.edu

     These submissions will be edited & compiled.  When collected items
     reach 30K they will be distributed through the listserver mechanism to
     all subscribers.

     If you cannot subscribe through conventional means, please contact
     Glenn Fleishman at the above address.  Put "subscription" in the
     subject field of the memo.

     SEND NEWSERV@UNCVM1 ADD DYNSYS-L username

     BitNet users with other environments can contact their local user
     services group for assistance.  Users without interactive messaging
     capability, or non-BitNet users can send a request to ULTIMA@UNCVM1
     (ULTIMA%UNC.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU) or to one of the list Coordinators
     to have their names added to the list.

     The DROP command is used to remove a name from a list:

     For remote IBM/VM sites, the DROP command is used like this:  TELL
     NEWSERV AT UNCVM1 DROP DYNSYS-L

     At UTSO use the VMSG command send to userid NEWSERV, node UNCVM1, and

     In order to prevent "rapid-fire" random e-mail transmissions, all
     messages are relayed to the E-EUROPE editor for a once-daily (maximum)
     batch mail release. In addition, each subscriber may disable the
     automatic E-EUROPE e-mail transmission to their site and download
     logfiles of each month's traffic.

     2. E-EUROPE Filelist Datafiles are available for downloading. The
     objective is to develop a clearinghouse of information on the business
     and economic systems of Eastern European countries.

     To receive the current listing of files, send the following to the
     LISTSERV (not to E-EUROPE), with the following:  GET E-EUROPE FILELIST

     a) File Downloads GET filename filetype E-EUROPE

     For example, GET E-EUROPE INTRO E-EUROPE

     b) File subscriptions Specialized information or information which is
     too large for normal e-mail is placed in E-EUROPE datafiles for
     downloading by subscribers. The file E-EUROPE INDEX contains a listing
     of the current datafiles.

     You may "subscribe" to a datafile in one of two ways: 1) automatic
     downloading of the entire file to your address with each update; 2)
     automatic notification that the file has been updated. You may
     terminate this file subscription upon demand.

     Send the following to the LISTSERV (not to E-EUROPE) at PUCC:

     1) To download one file, one time, without subscribing:  GET filename
     filetype E-EUROPE

     Example, GET E-EUROPE INDEX E-EUROPE

     2) To receive automatic file downloads (AFD=automatic file
     distribution) upon file updates:  AFD ADD filename filetype E-EUROPE

     Example:  AFD ADD E-EUROPE INDEX E-EUROPE

     3) To cancel automatic file downloads:  AFD DEL filename filetype
     E-EUROPE

     4) To receive automatic file update information (FUI):  FUI ADD
     filename filetype E-EUROPE

     5) To cancel automatic file update information:  FUI DEL filename
     filetype E-EUROPE

     6) To receive a list of files to which you are subscribed:  AFD LIST
     or FUI LIST

     C. Subscription to E-EUROPE

     Send E-mail to LISTSERV@PUCC or LISTSERV@PUCC.PRINCETON.EDU (not to
     E-EUROPE) with the body containing the appropriate command:

     1. To add yourself SUB E-EUROPE yourfirstname yourlastname

     2. To remove yourself SIGNOFF E-EUROPE

         D. Direct any questions to the list editor:

E-HUG on LISTSERV@DARTCMS1.BITNET

     The list E-HUG@DARTCMS1 provides for distribution of the Electronic
     Hebrew Users Newsletter.  The newsletter is the successor to the print
     publication, "Hebrew Users Group Newsletter" which was edited by Jack
     Love, and emanated from the Berkeley Hillel Foundation through 1989.

     This incarnation is electronic-only, and is mandated, like the
     original, to cover all things relating to use of Hebrew, Yiddish,
     Judesmo, and Aramaic on computers.  It is released as time permits and
     information demands, currently every 1-2 weeks.  This newsletter is
     dedicated to the proposition that computers, to be useful, must be
     usable to people working in all languages, at the convenience of those
     users.  In that spirit, we print all questions pertaining to use of
     the Hebrew alphabet on computers and answer all those that we can.  We
     encourage discussion on all levels of computer facility--from new
     users looking for software or Hebrew-related resources (educational,
     graphic, or otherwise), to discussions by developers on how the
     software should work (when it works :-)).  We also do our best to
     report on new software (or updates) of interest and to serve as a
     general news source to the field.

     The list is maintained via LISTSERV and subscription may be obtained
     by the usual mechanism of sending the command SUB E-HUG yourfirstname
     yourlastname to LISTSERV@DARTCMS1.

     Questions may be directed to the list owner, Ari Davidow
     <well!ari@apple.com>.  Archives may be obtained from LISTSERV@DARTCMS1
     using the SEND command and currently consist of E-HUG 91-00001 to
     E-HUG 91-00011.

     or LISTSERV@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU

     This list was formed to serve as a vehicle for the distribution of an
     interactive literary journal: RIF/T and related exchange collection of
     any information related to contemporary poetics.  RIF/T provides a
     forum for poets that are conversant with the media to explore the full
     potential of a true electronic journal.  Dynamic--not static.  RIF/T
     shifts and riffs with the diction of "trad" poetry investigating a
     new, flexible, fluid poetry of exchange.

     Archives of e-poetry and related files are stored in the e-poetry
     FILELIST.

     To receive a list of files send the command INDEX e-poetry to
     LISTSERV@UBVM or LISTSERV@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU as the first line in the
     body of a mail message (not the Subject: line).

     To subscribe to e-poetry, send the command SUB e-poetry your name to
     LISTSERV@UBVM or LISTSERV@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU via a mail message
     (again, as the first line in the body of the mail, not the Subject:
     line).

           culture, its researchers, performers, instruments,
           instrument-makers, festivals, concerts and societies,
           records, song texts and translations, machine-readable
           notations of (early) music;
        2. Authenticity in music of (these and) later periods, e.g.
           classical and romantic.

     To subscribe to EARLYM-L, send the command:  SUB EARLYM-L
     your_full_name to LISTSERV@AEARN e.g.  SUB EARLYM-L "Tylman Susato" To

EBCBBUL%HDETUD1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

     EBCBBUL is short for EBCB BULletin board, a facet of the European Bank
     of Computer Programs in Biotechnology (EBCB).  EBCB is a non-profit
     making organization mainly funded by the European Community (EC).  The
     main goal of EBCB is to stimulate and facilitate the use of computers
     in biotechnological training and research in Europe. EBCBBUL will not
     only promote user/user communication, but will also provide users with
     up to date information (e.g. about courses/congresses).

     Items accepted for the bulletin board will be distributed via
     electronic mail (e-mail) to all participants and will also be retained
     for future reference.

     EBCBBUL is public, and anyone with access to EARN can participate.
     Before you gain access to EBCBBUL through EARN or a related system,
     however, you must issue one of the following commands:

     For EARN nodes operating with VM/CMS systems type the following:  TELL
     LISTSERV AT HDETUD1 SUBSCRIBE EBCBBUL (followed by your name)

     For EARN nodes operating with VAX/VMS systems type the following:
     SEND LISTSERV @ HDETUD1 SUBSCRIBE EBCBBUL (followed by your name)

     On other systems send mail to LISTSERV@HDETUD1 (or
     LISTSERV@HDETUD1.TUDELFT.NL, or for Internet users
     LISTSERV%HDETUD1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU) with the body/text of the mail
     containing the command:  SUB EBCBBUL yourfirstname yourlastname

     As soon as your request for access has been accepted, you will
     receive, by e-mail, confirmation of this fact.  Because of limitations
     imposed by e-mail (traffic volume etc.) this may take several hours.
     After that you will be able to search EBCBBUL using LDBASE or LSVTALK
     (these are programmes, available within the EARN node, that make
     interactive searching possible).

     The Energy and Climate Information Exchange File Distribution Service

     The Energy and Climate Information Exchange (ECIX) is a project of
     EcoNet aimed at educating the environmental community and the general
     public on the potential of energy efficiency and renewable energy to
     reduce the use of fossil fuels and their contribution to climate
     change.

     ECIX now offers as a public service the distribution of files
     pertaining to energy and climate change. We accept files
     electronically submitted by those who wish to share information,
     advertise the existence of the files, and electronically mail files to
     those who request them.

     As an information provider, your shared files will reach a large
     audience. We advertise our list of available files on EcoNet, several
     Internet newsgroups, and several LISTSERV distribution lists. EcoNet
     is a member of an international association of networks, so your
     information will potentially reach people in over 90 countries. In
     addition, we maintain a list of those requesting your files so that
     you can determine what type of demand there is for your information.

     As an information subscriber, you will regularly receive an updated
     list of available files. Each list contains a brief description of the
     files, enabling you to select those of interest to you. You send us a
     list of your choices; we send you the files. It's that simple.

     To submit files:  Send us your file (of publishable quality please)
     electronically.  Please include with your submission:  * your name *
     the organization, if any, with which you are affiliated * a title for
     your file, indicating it's content * how long you wish us to advertise
     the file

     To subscribe: Please send us an electronic message indicating:  * your
     name * the organization, if any, with which you are affiliated * your
     reason for interest * whether you wish to be a regular subscriber, or
     would like to receive the most recent file list only.

     Note to Internet-users: Files are also available in the ftp directory
     at igc.org, internet address 192.82.108.1. Use standard anonymous ftp
     login.

        Submissions and request for subscriptions should be sent to:

     The purpose of this list is to share information and network with
     professionals either in economic development or who are pursuing some
     of the same informational goals.

     We here at the economic development department in Littleton, Colorado,
     use information as the cornerstone of our program.  Littleton's New
     Economy Project works primarily with small, innovative companies
     trying to give them the sophisticated tools they need to compete in
     the new global environment.  Instead of "hunting" for far away
     companies and offering incentives to try to get them to locate in
     Littleton, we concentrate on adding value to existing local companies,
     or "gardening".  Services include using commercial databases to
     provide a variety of strategic information.

     We are also actively interested in systems thinking, chaos, and
     complexity as they apply to economics.  We look forward to hearing
     from those of you out there who use information, and who are involved
     with businesses.

     as the contents of the major policy analysis journals, abstracts of
     particularly important papers and studies, job announcements, meeting
     announcements, and the like.  We also intend to place papers -
     completed or in draft form - in an archive that will be readily
     available to all members of the list.  If you have a paper to
     contribute, write to either of the Coordinators, and they will provide

     or LISTSERV@ncsuvm.cc.ncsu.edu

     The purpose of this list is to provide a forum for comments,
     techniques and philosophies of teaching statistics.  The primary focus
     is that of college level statistics education, both undergraduate and
     graduate studies.

     Statistical literacy has become a social imperative if we are to share
     a responsible, thoughtful citizenry.  As people involved or interested
     in the instruction of statistics, we have a precious asset in our
     collective knowledge.

     This list exists because WE CAN LEARN FROM EACH OTHER:

        - What techniques are we using in statistical instruction?
        - What strategies should we use to prepare our students for
          the future?
        - What part do/should computers play in instruction?  (are
          computers a new tool or a new subject for students?)
        - What assets can we share among ourselves?  (public-domain
          software programs, datasets, etc.)

     There are many individuals working in these areas, each with knowledge
     valuable to the others.  This list attempts to bring together every
     teacher, student, researcher, and specialist interested in improving
     statistical instruction.

     You are encouraged to:

        - Submit summaries of or commentary on published articles and
          books which address problems or solutions in teaching
          statistics
        - Share the results of your experiments with teaching
          statistics
        - Ask thought-provoking questions about the future of
          statistics education and the environments in which it takes
          place.
        - Recruit interested parties to this list, regardless of their
          status in education, industry or government.

EDSTYLE on LISTSERV@SJUVM.BITNET                         [Last Update 5/93]
     or LISTSERV@SJUVM.STJOHNS.EDU

     Edstyle is a list that will deal with the Learning Style movement.
     That is people have preferred ways of learning and we can maximize
     teaching effectivenes by taking these styles into account.  There are
     many flavors of learning styles and all are welcome on this Edstyle.
     The orientation, however, is toward the Learning Styles model of Dunn
     and Dunn and it is expected that Rita Dunn will make personal
     contributions.  The list will be unmoderated and open to all.

     In addition to the ususal conference messages, the list will be the
     center for research projects involving the evaluation of learning
     style procedures and testing instruments.  It is expected that
     Innotech in the Phillippines and the Center for Success in Learning
     will be participating in the initial research effort, but other
     investigators will be welcome.

     Finally, the Edstyle List will be intimately connected with the
     Unibase system of Leigh Calnek in Canada.  By connecting to the
     unibase system via telnet, real-time conferences on learning styles
     will be available and it is expected that leaders in the Learning
     Styles movement will be on hand for these conferences.

     The list is open to anyone interested in education including classroom
     teachers, administrators, parents, and academics.  Discussions on the
     value of Learning Styles, the comparative effective of the various
     programs, as well as reports on successful or unsuccessful application
     are welcome.

     To subscribe to EDSTYLE send e-mail to LISTSERV@SJUVM on BITNET or to

EEJOBS via ST6267@AIX370.SIU.EDU                         [Last Update 3/93]

     The EEJOBS discussion has been created for employers and prospective
     employees with E-mail access to advertise positions available and
     positions desired in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering fields.
     Discussion and tips on how to find jobs are also welcome here on the
     EEJOBS discussion.

     Many users of BITnet are familiar with the LISTSERV style of lists.
     The server that the EEJOBS list operates on is *NOT* a LISTSERV.  It
     is based on the UMNEWS software developed at the University of Maine.
     The server requires special subject lines in order for the mail to be
     processed properly.

     Commands to the server located at ST6267@AIX370.SIU.EDU should have a
     subject line containing only "SERVER.COMMANDS" (without the quotes, of
     course).  To subscribe to the EEJOBS list, send mail with a subject of
     "SERVER.COMMANDS" to ST6267@AIX370.SIU.EDU.  In the body of the mail,
     put on the first line, "/BBOARD SUB EEJOBS" (no quotes) or "/BBOARD
     SIGNON EEJOBS" (no quotes) and you will be added to the EEJOBS list.
     You may leave any time by sending the command "/BBOARD UNSUB EEJOBS"
     or "BBOARD SIGNOFF EEJOBS" to the server, again with a subject of
     "SERVER.COMMANDS".

     Postings to the EEJOBS list located at ST6267@AIX370.SIU.EDU should
     have a subject line of the following format: "POSTING.EEJOBS topic"
     where "topic" is the subject line you want sent on the post.  The
     "POSTING." part of the subject line tells the server that this is a
     POSTING and not commands to be processed.  The "EEJOBS" tells the
     server which discussion this post is to be distributed to.  The
     "topic" part is the ONLY part of the subject that will actually be
     distributed to the subscribers of the EEJOBS list.  For example, if a
     user sends mail to ST6267@AIX370.SIU.EDU with a Subject: of
     "POSTING.EEJOBS Position available at Intel" the only part of the
     subject that subscribers to EEJOBS will see is "Position available at
     Intel".  The rest of the subject is for the server's use only so that
     it knows what to do with the mail.

     Currently digests are not kept of the postings to any of the topics
     served by the server located at ST6267@AIX370.SIU.EDU, this will
     change in the future as time allows the author, Jerome Grimmer, to
     write the code and clear the disk space.

     the users of this package.  It is especially de desirable that EGRET-L
     be used as a resource for new and experienced users to turn to for
     help when problems are encountered or when they come up with novel
     applications of the software.

     Egret-l will not be a medium for flame wars, or for non-Egret related
     topics.

     Archives of EGRET-L can be listed by sending the command:

     INDEX EGRET-L to LISTSERV@DARTCMS1.DARTMOUTH.EDU or

ELLHNIKA on LISTSERV@DHDURZ1.BITNET

     Thanks to the friendly support of DANTE and especially of Joachim
     Lammarsch a discussion list on Greek TeX (cf.  "CALL FOR
     STANDARDIZATION OF GREEK TeX AND CREATION OF A GREEK TeX GROUP") has
     been opened, at

     ELLHNIKA@DHDURZ1

     You can subscribe by sending the usual

     SUBSCRIBE ELLHNIKA yourfirstname yourlastname

     to LISTSERV@DHDURZ1.  Please note that messages to the list should be
     send to the list adress ELLHNIKA@DHDURZ1 and not to the LISTSERV.

     Languages of the list are English and Greek (Modern please!!)  It
     would be appreciated if you use Silvio Levy's transliteration for
     Greek, as long as no other transliteration has been fixed.  If you
     have to use a different one, please precise the corres- pondences at
     top of the message.

     The list is intended for linguists of any origin having to typeset
     ancient Greek, as well as for people using Greek as their everyday's
     language. It is quite a dilemma for me to encourage

        - the former to participate in English and discuss the
          TeXnical problems of ancient Greek
        - the latter to participate in Greek and in this way get used
          to the transliterated expression of the language; as I said
          in the "CALL", a certain effort must be taken to bypass the
          handicap of having a different alphabet, this list should
          serve as a starting point inside the TeX world.

     So there are two languages and two directions to take. Let's find a
     compromise based on the spirit of cooperation! (and if a scholar
     decides to learn Modern Greek for breaking this Gordian knot, I
     guarantee him that he won't be dissapointed!).

ETHCSE-L@UTKVM1.UTK.EDU                      [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     ETHCSE-L is an unmoderated, unarchived list which deals with ethical
     issues of interest to professional software engineers.  The list is
     intended to provide the opportunity for software engineers and those
     interested in software engineering to discuss ethical concerns of the
     discipline.  As the discipline is rapidly advancing new ethical issues
     arise in the practice of software engineering.

     The group might be expected to discuss things like the move by some
     state governments toward licensing software engineers, establishing a
     code of ethics, or articulating a set of principles which guide
     professional practice.  The list can also be used as a place to
     announce conferences, and publications and issue call for papers.

     To subscribe, send an interactive message or mail to LISTSERV@UTKVM1
     or mail to LISTSERV@UTKVM1.UTK.EDU with the body containing the
     command

     SUBscribe ETHCSE-L First_name Last_name

ETHICS-L%MARIST.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

     Discussions of ethics in computing usually generate more heat than
     light.  This list could do a lot toward generating more light if we do
     more than trade war stories and opinions of the "I'm right and you're
     NOT" variety.  Of course we can't get any work done without some war
     stories, since they furnish food for thought.  But we shouldn't stop
     there.  Given our experiences, we ought to be able to delineate the
     basic issues and hot areas in computer ethics.  Some current ones have
     to do with:

        - ownership of information (both data and program files)
        - what happens when systems programs fail? Is anyone
          responsible for damage done?  Or is the responsibility only
          for the necessary fix?
        - responsibility for program failures (Is the company
          responsible?  the programmer? the lead programmer? the
          project manager?) Who's responsible for the "fix"?
        - how much privacy is reasonable (there are all kinds of
          levels here; data bases, systems, LANs, networks, etc.)

     BitNet users can add themselves to the list by issuing the following
     command to LISTSERV@MARIST.BITNET:  SUBSCRIBE ETHICS-L your_full_name
     where your_full_name is your real name (not your userid).  BitNet
     users can unsubscribe with the command:  UNSUBSCRIBE ETHICS-L

     All other requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to the Moderators.

     EUEARN-L is a list devoted to discussion of computers, computer
     communications and electronic developments in Eastern Europe.  It is
     an attempt to help the new networks in these areas with technical and
     social advice, and to foster their development.

     It hopes to smooth the integration of computer networks in Eastern
     Europe into the world networking system.  Eastern Europe is defined
     roughtly as that area between the Baltic and Adriatic/Mediterranean
     sees, and between the borders of Byelorussia/Ukraine and France/
     Switzerland.

     It is a counterpart to such lists as PLEARN (Polish computing)and
     SUEARN (Soviet).  Earn is the European Academic Research Network.  The
     list is to be a mixture of technical and conversational.  The
     principal language will be English but there will be no objection to
     the use of languages native to the countries concerned.  Where
     possible, and if the messages are of general rather than individual
     interest, English summaries should be provided.

     The list is unmoderated for the time being.  The list manager is as
     below.  EUEARN-L is is based at University of Buffalo.  Subscriptions
     should be send to LISTSERV@UBVM.BITNET with the following command in

EV on LISTSERV@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu

     The EV Electric Vehicle Discussion Mailing List is intended to provide
     a forum to discuss the current state of the art and future direction
     of electric vehicles.  It is not intended to discuss either EV
     appropriateness or comparisons with other transportation primary drive
     modes such as the venerable internal combustion engine.  Those
     "discussions" are best relegated to the appropriate usenet newsgroup.

     An electric vehicle is any vehicle which uses an electric motor as the
     primary or sole motive force.  The energy storage device used to drive
     said motor can use any technology including, but not limited to, solar
     electric, electric battery, internal combustion engine coupled with a
     electric generator, or any combination of these.  Production electric
     vehicles are currently available.  Internal combustion engine vehicles
     can be converted to electric.  There exist a number of companies who
     perform this conversion.  There is also a number of manufacturers of
     equipment allowing you to do-it-yourself.

     To subscribe, send the following command to LISTSERV@SJSUVM1 (bitnet)

express-users@cme.nist.gov

     The purpose of the "express-users" mailing list is to facilitate the
     sharing of information among users of the EXPRESS information modeling
     language.

     Sample subjects include:

        1. EXPRESS information sources (where to find things, how to
           download information, etc.)  We hope eventually to include
           some such information in this introductory posting.
        2. Information modeling techniques and sample models built in
           EXPRESS.
        3. Sample applications of EXPRESS (we need as many as
           possible!).
        4. The EXPRESS-I instantiation language, and the EXPRESS-G
           graphical form of EXPRESS.
        5. EXPRESS tools, both those that exist and requirements for
           new tools (translators, editors, validation tools,
           EXPRESS-G editors, database implementations, etc.)
        6. Discussions of the EXPRESS metamodel, for example: The STEP
           Semantic Unification Metamodel (SUMM), Dr. Stanley Su's
           work at the University of Florida, and Michael Yinger's
           EXPRESSWARE work at TSC.
        7. The relationship of EXPRESS to other modeling languages and
           methodologies (IDEF1X, NIAM, OSAM*, ERM, etc.)
        8. We hope that the Users' Group will be able to contribute to
           the development of EXPRESS, both by contributing actual
           effort and by bringing relevant work to the attention of
           the community.
        9. How to organize/mobilize the EXPRESS User Group activities;
           how to spread the word about EXPRESS to the rest of the
           world.

     The mailing list is a simple mail exploder, which means that mail sent

FedTax-L@SHSU.BITNET                         [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     FedTax-L is a list supported by Sam Houston State University of
     Huntsville, Texas, to provide a generally unmoderated environment for
     the discussion of federal taxation issues from both a practical and
     academic viewpoint.  The discussions are intended to include latest
     trends, regulatory actions, and, of course, a lively exchange of ideas
     and concerns.

     The explicit purpose of FedTax-L is to provide quick and timely
     interchange between subscribers, to provide a forum where support may
     be available for interesting questions which may not be addressed
     locally (or may desire a "second opinion"), and to discuss current and
     potential taxation issues.  It is also the hope of the owner of the
     list to develop databases of at least late breaking tax matters for
     access to all subscribers.  Archives of FedTax-L postings will be
     available for reference.  As is the case on all unmoderated lists, the
     discussion and topics are only limited by the participation and
     interest of its subscribers.  Subscribers are welcome to take an
     active role by posting to FedTax-L or an inactive role by monitoring
     the list.

     This group is now gatewayed to the usenet group misc.taxes.

     To subscribe to FedTax-L, please send a MAIL message to:
     LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET.  The body of this MAIL message should be one
     line and contain the words:  SUBSCRIBE FedTax-L

     Please note that LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET is MAIL-oriented only --
     interactive commands send to this address will not be recognized.

     FEMISA is conceived as a list where those who work on or think about
     feminism, gender, women and international relations, world politics,
     international political economy, or global politics, can communicate.
     Formally, FEMISA was established to help those members of the Feminist
     Theory and Gender Studies Section of the International Studies
     Association keep in touch.

     More generally, I hope that FEMISA can be a network where we share
     information in the area of feminism or gender and international
     studies about publications or articles, course outlines, questions
     about sources or job opportunities, information about conferences or
     upcoming events, or proposed panels and information related to the
     International Studies Association.

     A list for discussion of Traditional and Contemporary Folk Music.  You
     can subscribe to this list by sending mail to LISTSERV@WMVM1 or
     LISTSERV@WMVM1.CC.WM.EDU.  No particular subject line is necessary,
     but the body of the message must be:

     SUBSCRIBE FOLKTALK Your full name

     The participants in this list will, of course, determine what topics
     are discussed, but I hope that we can discuss Folk Music defined
     broadly, what Page Wilson, a Richmond, VA folkie, calls "purebred
     American mongrel music.  Discussion of English, Celtic, and other
     varieties of folk music will, of course, be welcome as well.

     I'd like to be able for us to talk about everything from the edges of
     bluegrass to the borders of rock 'n' roll, and from nearly new age to
     almost jazz.  I would hope we could talk about everyone from Phil Ochs
     to Boiled in Lead, and from Bela Fleck to De Dannan.

FORSUM-L on LISTSERV@BROWNVM.BROWN.EDU                   [Last Update 4/93]
     or LISTSERV@BROWNVM.BITNET

     The Alliance for Environmental Education is working with the U.S.
     Department of Education and the White House to extend President
     Clinton's April 2 Northwest Forest Summit in Portland, Oregon, to the
     K-12 and university communities via computer networks.

     A group of environmental educators will review White House briefings,
     summit transcripts and post-summit follow-up materials which will be
     made available electronically by the Administration.  Drawing from
     existing curriculum materials, this group of educators will produce
     brief teacher guides for various grade levels.  This will be
     supplemented with guides to available educational resources on
     forest-related subjects.  The entire package will be distributed to
     computer networks serving education.  On each of these networks,
     interactive discussion of the material by students and teachers will
     be encouraged by volunteer online teacher/mentors.

     There is no budget associated with this project, only the tremendous
     "capital" it could generate by showing how online networking can
     benefit education.

     Teachers and students involved in the "Forest Summit Online" project
     will experience an interactive, dynamic forum that is the result of
     their cumulative activity.  Each forum (the interactive part may vary
     depending on the network accessed) will focus on common, unaltered
     text materials coming from three sources:

     -- The U.S.  Department of Education will provide introductory
     material.

     -- The White House.  Complete transcripts of Forest Summit-related
     briefings, press conferences, announcements and the complete
     transcripts of summit speakers will be posted online by the White
     House Communications Office.

     -- Supplemental materials developed by the project steering committee.

     The project can be accessed in a number of ways, by users of many
     computer networks.

     -- FORSUM-L@BROWNVM.BROWN.EDU -- A public automated mailing list at
     Brown University, devoted to this project.  This list will be linked
     to the <list.forsum> conference at EcoNet.  It will be accessible to
     the more than 1 million users on the Internet and Bitnet computer
     networks, though it will be selectively advertised only within online
     forums focusing on CLASSROOM EDUCATION.  Subscribe by sending a
     message to LISTSERV@BROWNVM.brown.edu (or LISTSERV@BROWNVM.bitnet),
     with only the following text in the message body:

     SUBSCRIBE FORSUM-L Your Name

     -- list.forsum -- The mailing list will be linked to the <list.forsum>
     conference at EcoNet, and from there to Association for Progressive
     Communications networks in other countries.  For details on EcoNet
     access, send e-mail to <send-info@igc.apc.org>.

     -- schl.proj.forest and schl.proj.general -- SchlNet conferences
     accessible via FrEdMail and on state educational computing networks
     subscribing to the SchlNet service, run by the FrEdMail Foundation,
     which reaches more than 10,000 schools nation-wide.  For details on
     SchlNet and FrEdMail, send e-mail to fred@acme.fred.org.

     -- Learning Link -- PBS Learning Link also will carry the list.forsum
     discussion, offering it to some 24,000 teachers at schools in the
     areas served by 22 Public Broadcasting System affiliate stations.

     VOLUNTEER TEACHER/MENTOR/MONITORS will review the online discussion
     and post questions in the online forums, guiding discussion toward
     informed, fair, critical analysis of the issues.  They will endeavor
     to assist teachers and students with finding information or academic
     resources that support their study of the issues.  They also will
     attempt to elicit feedback from teachers and students about how the
     information presented by this project is being used in their
     classrooms and studies.

     LISTS OF AVAILABLE EDUCATION RESOURCES that focus on forest issues
     will be posted online by the project steering committee to help
     teachers integrate the Forest Summit into their existing curriculum.
     These will include the results of an ERIC search by the AskERIC
     Information Resource service at Syracuse University.  It could also
     include a list of environmental education concepts related to forests,
     extracted from NAAEE's "Essential Learnings In Environmental
     Education" database.

     CURRICULUM UNITS focusing on forests could be included, if
     appropriate.

     REFERRALS to other online forums where forest issues are being
     discussed will be made.

     EXPERTS could be connected online to answer questions from students
     and teachers.  Here again, achieving balance and fairness in
     representing all views is probably tricky, but this could be useful to
     make sure that a wide range of views is guaranteed.

     GUIDED ACTIVITIES, such as role-playing in online discussion, may be
     useful techniques to introduce to help focus dialog.

     Volunteers are needed, especially teachers experienced in online
     facilitation.  Contact <forsum@igc.apc.org> to offer assistance.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------- The
     online conferences/mailing lists receiving and participating in this

     or LISTSERV@URIACC.URI.EDU

     In light of the rapidly globalizing daily life and the world economy,
     American higher education must find ways to accelerate the
     internationalization of the curriculum.  This project at the College
     of Business Administration of the University of Rhode Island uses
     E-mail as a mechanism for promoting faculty and curricular
     development, and as an avenue for students to familiarize themselves
     with future global partners.

     In this project, pairs of faculty from different nations are linked by
     discipline to (1) jointly develop curricula for emphasizing global
     perspectives, and (2) jointly teach students, here and abroad, by
     engaging them in debates via E-mail across borders about critical
     issues of their fields.  Faculty around the world who are interested
     in internationalizing their own business or managment curricula are
     invited to this list.

     To subscribe to GC-L send e-mail to LISTSERV@URIACC on BITNET or to
     LISTSERV@URIACC.URI.EDU with the BODY of the mail containing:

GEODESIC%UBVM.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU

     This list is for the discussion of Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller, his
     works and his philosophies on Life, the Universe, and Everything (NOT
     The Douglas Adams book!).  For those of you who don't know, Bucky is
     the person who invented the Geodesic Dome, which is what we all played
     on as children in the playground (the domes with all the triangles,
     remember?).  Another example of geodesic architecture is the giant
     white sphere at Disney World's "Epcot Center".  Of course, Bucky did a
     LOT more than just invent the Geodesic Dome! He invented other means
     of housing people cheaply, efficiently, COMFORTABLY, and basically
     anywhere in the world! (Yes, even ON the oceans!) So if you're
     interested in discussing Bucky, learning more about him, or finding
     out about 8500 ft. high pyramidal cities that float in the ocean and
     house 1,000,000 people comfortably (2000 sq ft. apartments with 1000
     sq ft. extra patio/garden space), or 1+ mile diameter spherical cities
     that FLOAT IN THE AIR *WITHOUT POWER*, then sign up on the list!

     GLB-NEWS exists as a read-only repository of information for gay,
     lesbian, bisexual, transsexual, transgender and sympathetic persons.
     It is designed to present informational articles from a variety of
     source mailing lists in a single forum for quick and compact delivery.

     As they are received by the Editor-at-large, articles which would
     classify as information will be posted to this list. Headers will be
     stripped and (as much as is possible) articles will be edited to
     remove personal references. This will be done in order to preserve the
     anonymity and safety of the authors. Only at the *EXPLICIT* request of
     an *ORIGINAL AUTHOR* will this guideline be relaxed. An Author may
     request their name to remain on articles by sending mail to the
     Editor-at-large. All articles posted to GBL-NEWS will have a Reply-To:
     header tag which will point to their list of origin. If you are unable
     to post a reply to the origin list, you will have to contact that
     list's moderator and request that special action be taken.

GLEList on listserver@tbone.biol.scarolina.edu           [Last Update 4/93]

     This mailing list supports users of the GLE Graphics Package.  It
     serves as a forum for users to ask questions about using the software,
     to post interesting or useful pieces of GLE code that they have
     developed, to get news about new versions of the program, and for any
     other communication that seems relevant.  Chris Pugmire, the author of
     GLE, is a member of the mailing list, so it can also serve as a
     conduit for bug reports or requests for new features.

     GLE is a high quality graphics package for scientists.  It runs on a
     variety of platforms (PCs, VAXes, and Unix) with drivers for XWindows,
     REGIS, TEK4010, PC graphics cards, VT100s, HP plotters, Postscript
     printers, Epson-compatible printers and Laserjet/Paintjet printers.
     It provides LaTEX quality fonts, as well as full support for
     Postscript fonts.  The graphing module provides full control over all
     features of graphs.  The graphics primitives include user-defined
     subroutines for complex pictures and diagrams.  Accompanying utilities
     include Surface (for hidden line surface plotting), Contour (for
     contour plots), Manip (for manipulation of columnar data files), and
     Fitls (for fitting arbitrary equations to data).

     Archives of the GLEList group are stored on the server machine.  To
     get a list of all GLEList-related files, send the following command in
     the body of an email message to listserver@tbone.biol.scarolina.edu:
     index glelist -all

     The archives can be searched by the listserver software.  For
     instructions on searching, send the following command to

     gnet@dhvx20.csudh.edu                              [Last Update 4/93]

     GNET is an archive/journal for documents pertaining to the effort to
     bring the net to lesser-developed nations and the poorer parts of
     developed nations.  (Net access is better in many "third world"
     schools than in South-Central Los Angeles).  GNET consists of two
     parts, an archive directory and a moderated discussion.

     Archived documents are available by anonymous ftp from the directory
     global_net at dhvx20.csudh.edu (155.135.1.1).  To conserve bandwidth,
     the archive contains an abstract of each document, as well as the full
     document.  (Those without ftp access can contact me for instructions
     on mail-based retrieval).

     In addition to the archive, there is a moderated GNET discussion list.
     The list is limited to discussion of the documents in the archive.  It
     is hoped that document authors will follow this discussion, and update
     their documents accordingly.  If this happens, the archive will become
     a dynamic journal.  Monthly mailings will list new papers added to the
     archive.

     We wish broad participation, with papers from nuts-and-bolts to
     visionary.  Suitable topics include, but are not restricted to:

           descriptions of networks and projects
           host and user hardware and software
           connection options and protocols
           current and proposed applications
           education using the global net
           user and system administrator training
           social, political or spriritual impact
           economic and environmental impact
           politics and funding
           free speech, security and privacy
           directories of people and resources

     To submit a document to the archive or subscribe to the moderated
     discussion list, use the address gnet_request@dhvx20.csudh.edu.

GO-L%SMCVAX.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU (Internet)
     GO-L on MAILSERV@SMCVAX (BITNET)

     GO-L, a list for game players interested in the game of GO is now
     available for public use. The list is sponsored by Saint Michael's
     College in Winooski, Vermont.  The list is intended to serve as a
     discussion point for GO-related topics, and as a meeting place for
     EMAIL games between list members.

     In contrast to the majority of BITNET lists, this one is supported by
     a DEC uVAX 3400 running the MAILSERV program for VAX/VMS.
     Consequently, commands used to access the list are slightly different
     than those used by LISTSERV. MAILSERV supports the following commands,
     among others:

          HELP      -  Ask for the HELP file.
          SUBSCRIBE -  Subscribe to a list.
          LISTS     -  List all mailing lists for a MAILSERVer.

     MAILSERV accepts only mail messages; not interactive SENDs or TELLs.
     Be sure to send only a mail message with your commands in the body of
     the message. Don't type any other text into the message; it won't
     work!

     As an example, to subscribe to the GO-L list, send a mail message to

     MAILSERV%SMCVAX.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

     and in the body of the message just put the command

     SUBSCRIBE GO-L

grad-adv@listserv.acs.unc.edu

     This list has three major goals at the onset:

        1. to put folks who advise undergraduates about graduate
           school in touch with their peers and with graduate schools.
           Being on the list will provide this service.
        2. to create of a catalog of accessable catalogs (using Art
           St.  George's Library catalog catalog as a model) to
           facilitate electronic access to graduate school
           information. I will gather information here unless there is
           another volunteer out there.
        3. to identify useful and/or neccessary information that would
           be used in a graduate school information database with an
           eye toward network standard tags and a single engine
           queriable distributed database of graduate school
           information (probably SQL for example) that would allow
           students and advisors to search several catalogs maintained
           at different universities.

     Point three is very blue sky for the moment, but if we keep it in
     mind, the technology exists and the end is actually achievable.  Other
     points will, I'm sure, arise.

     To add yourself to grad-adv, send a MAIL message of:  subscribe

        1. Actual practice problems and/or solutions, (eg. "I have a
           patient with XX disease, what experiences does anyone else
           have with this situation?")
        2. Nursing law in one's state.
        3. Nursing ethics situations.
        4. Nursing policies/politics.
        5. Staff development or patient education.
        6. Short summaries and or reactions to news articles affecting
           nursing.

     Naturally, it is not limited to the above topics, these are just
     suggestions.  In short, anything that would be of interest to
     practicing nurses, is great!  To subscribe send an e-mail message to:

Green on ListServ@IndyCMS (BITNET/CREN)
     or ListServ@IndyCMS.IUPUI.Edu (Internet)

     Green is dedicated to the study of Green movements worldwide and their
     influence on public opinion and public policy.  The scope of the
     list's discussion is global: all Green movements, at every level, are
     of interest to this list.

     Of special interest to the list is the emerging Green movement in the
     US -- how it is being organized by various competing elements, how it
     is being influenced by other Green movements worldwide (especially
     European), how it is interacting with those movements, and how it is
     influencing American public opinion and public policy on the local,
     state, regional and national level.

     It is emphasized that the purpose of Green is the *study* of Green
     movements.  Green is *not* a tool for organizing or promoting those
     movements.  In keeping with policies defining the appropriate use of
     academic networks (which often include prohibitions on explicit
     political activism), adherence to the stated purpose of this list is
     strictly monitored and enforced.

     Green is open to all persons interested in the study of Green
     movements worldwide.  To subscribe send mail to LISTSERV@IndyCMS on
     BITNET or LISTSERV@IndyCMS.IUPUI.EDU with the body containing SUB

GSDSP@OCF.Berkeley.edu                       [Last Updated 28-January-1992]

     The GS/DSP Discussion List serves as an unmoderated forum for
     discussion of GS/DSP co-processor board for the Apple II family of
     computers currently being developed by Pete Snowberg.  This list is
     for the discemination of information about the GS/DSP and the
     discussion of possible applications for the GS/DSP.

     Messages sent to this list are not reviewed by the list owner and are
     automatically forwarded to everyone on the list.  If you want to send
     private messages to each other or to Pete this is not the way to do
     it.  If you would like to send a private message to Pete Snowberg you
     can reach him at:

     pets@abacus.com

     Messages are not verified and the authors of the messages are solely
     responsible for their content.

     List coordinator:

     If you want to unsubscribe, change address, contact me at the
     following address:

     gsdsp-request@ocf.berkeley.edu

     To post submissions to everyone on the mailing list you can send it
     to:

     GSDSP@OCF.Berkeley.edu

     When you send your message to the above address, everybody on the list
     gets it!  This is where you send your submissions to the mailing list.
     If you want to be removed from the mailing list do not send it here
     but send it to the list coordinator address
     (gsdsp-request@ocf.berkeley.edu).

     One more note on this mailing list.  This list is being run out of the
     Open Computing Facility at UC Berkeley.  This is a cluster of 18
     Apollo Domain DN3500 workstations run by a completely student staff.
     This cluster is not the most stable one in the world but mail here
     generally is.  (Note: I said GENERALLY.) From time to time this
     cluster might disappear off of the net and your submission might not
     make it through.  But these occurrences should be even less frequent
     now with the addition of another network gateway.  So if your
     submission to the list bounce, try again later and the list should be
     back up.

     Archives:

     From time to time there will be informational postings from Pete or
     other developers about their products related to the GS/DSP, these
     messages will be archived and if you want send a message to the list
     coordinator and he will forward to you the requested file.

     Archive Listing:

     This will be listing which files are availble.  Currently we only have
     two files, the GS/DSP Preliminary Press Info that was posted to
     comp.sys.apple2, this one and a long question and answer post by Pete
     Snowberg about the DSP board.

H-Urban on LISTSERV@UICVM.BITNET                         [Last Update 3/93]
     or LISTSERV@UICVM.UIC.EDU

     H-Urban (URBAN HISTORY) has been set up at the University of Illinois
     at Chicago (UIC) in order to provide a forum for scholars of urban
     history.  The UIC history department has a long-standing interest in
     the history of Chicago and other U.S.  cities, ethnicity and
     immigration, and of European and Russian urban development.

     The primary purpose of H-Urban is to enable urban historians to easily
     communicate current research and research interests; to discuss new
     approaches, methods and tools of analysis; to share reviews of useful
     resources including monographs, journals, articles, and primary source
     materials such as papers, maps, records, and databases; and to
     announce calls for papers, conferences, museum and society shows,
     exhibitions, job opportunities, grants and fellowships.

     H-Urban is also a forum for exploring the approaches, methods and
     tools used in teaching history to graduate and undergraduate students.
     As described below, UIC is establishing an electronic archive easily
     accessible to historians.  Syllabi, reading lists, and examinations
     would all be valuable additions to the archive.

     Discussion of cities throughout human history, and in all geographic
     areas is welcome.

     To subscribe to H-Urban, send a note to Listserv@UICVM or
     Listserv@uicvm.uic.edu with the following command in the BODY:

     Subscribe H-Urban Your Full Name

     H-Urban Fileserver

     Documents of interest to urban historians -- bibliographies, book and
     article reviews, announcements, teaching materials, and descriptions
     of tools, techniques, and computer software and hardware -- will be
     made available from the H-Urban fileserver.  In addition, an archive
     of all discussion on H-Urban will be available from the fileserver.

     To obtain a list of available documents, send a note to LISTSERV@uicvm
     (or LISTSERV@uicvm.uic.edu) with the following command in the BODY:

     Index H-Urban

     To obtain a specific document, send LISTSERV the command

     GET filename filetype

     Thus, to obtain a document entitled "H-Urban Welcome" from the
     fileserver, send a note to Listserv with the command

     GET H-Urban Welcome

     Contributions to the archive are welcome, and should be sent to Wendy
     Plotkin at U20566@UICVM or U20566@uicvm.uic.edu.

     Jackson, Co-Moderator of the FidoNet International SHAREWRE echo and
     Moderator of the FidoNet WARNINGS echo which warns of hacked, hoax,
     Trojan Hourse, and pirated files that have been seen posted on BBS

     have a few notes on programs for other computer platforms.  It is a
     great aid for anyone who downloads files from a public access system.

     There are many people who do not get quick, or any, access to the
     latest version of the essential report.  This mailing list has been
     created to allow fast efficient distribution of The Hack Report to
     people with an Internet mail address who do not have easy access to it
     via other means such as anonymous FTP or through FidoNet.  This is a
     one-directional list soley for the distribution of The Hack Report

HELPNET%NDSUVM1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

     HELPNET is intended as a working list for those interested in the
     roles global computer networks might play in times of disasters such
     as earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.

     Archives are kept for this list.  Send LISTSERV the commands INDEX
     HELPNET and INFO DATABASE for more information (Note: The commands are
     sent to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 (BitNet) or LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU and NOT to
     the list).  They are also available via ANONYMOUS FTP to VM1.NODAK.EDU
     (134.129.111.1).  Enter CD HELPNET after connecting.

     sending mail to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 (BitNet) or LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU
     with the body/text of the message containing the command:  SUB HELPNET
     your_full_name where "your_full_name" is your real name, not your

     but read it through some other means (eg. GRAND), then ALSO include
     the command:  SET HELPNET NOMAIL which will allow you to contribute
     but not send you redundant mail.

HELP-NET on LISTSERV@TEMPLEVM.Bitnet

     HELPSERV has evolved.  Helpserv and all its component files have been
     integrated (finally!) into LISTSERV at TEMPLEVM.  In addition, there
     has been the addition of a mailing list, and a NAME CHANGE.

     Help-Net is a discussion list for the purposes of solving user
     problems with utilities and software related to the Internet and
     Bitnet networks.  In addition, LISTSERV at TEMPLEVM maintains a set of
     low-level help files intended to help the beginning user acclimatize
     himself to the network systems.

     Both novice and experienced users are encouraged to join the
     discussion list, either to ask questions, or to answer them.
     Questions on almost any network topic are encouraged, however there
     are a few ground rules we ask that you observe.

        1. Please do not post where can I find this game, or that
           specific gif file, etc.  There are several lists that deal
           specifically with those topics.  The question, Where would
           I find a list that could tell me where to get ???  on the
           other hand is quite acceptable.
        2. Please do not post any messages that relate to the illegal
           traffic of copyrighted material.
        3. Feel free to redistribute the help files freely.  We do ask
           that you identify the source of any materials.
        4. We gratefully accept both topics for additional Help
           sheets, and submissions to be placed on the server.  For
           more information about submitting, get the file SUBMIT INFO
           from the server.  See below for instructions.

     Below are some brief instructions on how to access the HELP-NET list.

     1. Signing on to the list.  Send the following command to LISTSERV at
     TEMPLEVM, as either an interactive message or the body of a mail
     message:

     SUB HELP-NET (Your Name)

     2. Getting a file from the list.  Send the following command to
     LISTSERV at TEMPLEVM:

     GET HELP-NET FILELIST

     Choose which files you want and send a get command for each of those
     files.  If you have a problem, ask the list.  It's what we are here
     for.  Please note that you must be a list subscriber to access files.

     3. Posting a message on the list.  - Send your mail message to
     HELP-NET at TEMPLEVM.  Your mail will be forwarded to all list
     members, and you will be replied to.

     I thank everyone for their support and interest and hope that I and
     the HELP-NET will continue to be of service to everyone in the network
     community.  If you have any questions regarding Help-Net, please
     direct them to V4078 at TEMPLEVM.  Again, thank you for your support.

HESSE-L on LISTSERV@UCSBVM.BITNET

     This international discussion group is devoted to the study of the
     life and literary works of Hermann Hesse, the Swiss- German
     Nobel-Prize winner of 1946.

     The List is edited and published electronically by Gunther Gottschalk
     of the University of California at Santa Barbara and will include
     discussion items, pre-publication announcements, texts,
     interpretations, analyses, critiques, reviews, bibliographies on Hesse
     and his contemporaries.  The principal languages of the list will be
     English and German, but contributions in other languages are welcome.
     The list is intended to establish better contacts among readers of
     Hesse and related authors and to contribute to the discussion of his
     life and his works.

     In the near future, archives of HESSE-L and related files will be
     stored in the HESSE-L filelist.  It is hoped to attract a number of
     prepublication manuscripts and other materials released by their
     authors, by journals, or by the holder of the rights to Hesse's works,
     Suhrkamp Verlag.  Part of the year the List will be run by its owner
     through the facilities of the J.W.  Goethe University in Frankfurt.
     To receive a list of files send the command INDEX HESSE-L in the BODY
     of mail or a message to LISTSERV@UCSBVM on BITNET.

     To subscribe to HESSE-L, send the following command to LISTSERV@UCSBVM
     via mail text (in the body) or interactive message:  SUBSCRIBE HESSE-L
     your full name

     For example: SUBSCRIBE HESSE-L Plinio Designori

HL-7@VIRGINIA.EDU                            [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     HL-7 is an electronic conference designed to foster communication
     concerning technical, operational, and business issues involved in the
     use of the HL-7 interface protocol.  It is also intended as a forum
     for the HL-7 Working Group members who are participating in the
     specification of the interface protocol.

     Health Level Seven is an application protocol for electronic data
     exchange in health care environments.  It is called level seven
     because the protocol assumes the underlying network support of levels
     one through six of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network
     model of the International Standards Organization (ISO).  The HL-7
     standard is specified at the seventh level, which is the application
     level.

     This HL-7 (Health Level Seven) Conference is *not* an offical part of
     the HL-7 Working Group and Executive Committee.  Official inquiries
     concerning HL-7 (Health Level Seven) should be sent directly to:
     Health Level Seven, P.O.  Box 66111, Chicago, IL 60666-9998, fax:
     (708) 616-9099.  In accordance with current CREN regulations,
     commercial activity (such as the selling of software) will be
     prohibited.  Subscription to this conference is open to *anyone*
     interested.

     You may subscribe by sending an e-mail message to:

     HL-7-REQUEST@VIRGINIA.EDU

     if your account is on the internet, with the following request as the
     text of the message.

     SUB HL-7 YourFirstname YourLastname

     This, the 'SUB ...,' must be part of the message; the subject line
     will be ignored.

     Remember two simple rules-of-thumb:

     If it's a request (SUBscribe, UNSUBscribe), send it to the list
     requester (HL-7-REQUEST@VIRGINIA.EDU).

     If it's a message for general distribution to the members of the list,
     send it to the list (HL-7@VIRGINIA.EDU).

     This list is a mechanism for periodically distributing a compendium of
     postings made to HOCKEY-L for those folks interested in the
     information on HOCKEY-L, but wish to limit the number of arriving
     E-Mail files, and do not wish to participate in the discussions.

     The HOCKEY-L list is for the discussion of collegiate ice hockey,
     including scores, team info, schedules, etc.  allowing fans to become
     more involved and knowledgeable about the game.

     The list resides at the University of Maine System MAINE.MAINE.EDU
     cpu.  When the owner posts a digest to the list, LISTSERV distributes
     a copy to everyone subscribed.  An archive of the digest is also
     created on a disk of LISTSERV.  Each digest posting is a separate file
     on that disk.

     HOCKEY-D does not accept postings; it merely distributes a periodic
     collection of postings from another list, HOCKEY-L.  Subscription
     information for HOCKEY-D or HOCKEY-L may be requested from Wayne Smith
     at WTS@MAINE.MAINE.EDU.

     Send a request to sign off the list or ask for an archived file to
     LISTSERV@MAINE.MAINE.EDU as described below.

     Questions, comments and problems may be sent to the HOCKEY-D list
     owner Wayne Smith at WTS@MAINE.MAINE.EDU.

     The opinions expressed on HOCKEY-D are those of the posters and not of
     the University of Maine System nor of the list owner.

HOLOCAUS on LISTSERV@UICVM.BITNET                        [Last Update 4/93]
     or LISTSERV@UICVM.UIC.EDU

     The coverage of the list will include the Holocaust itself, and
     closely related topics like anti-semitism, and Jewish history in the
     1930s and 1940s, as well as closely related themes in the history of
     WW2, Germany, and international diplomacy.

     We are especially interested in reaching college teachers of history
     who already have, or plan to teach courses on the Holocaust.  HOLOCAUS
     will therefore actively solicit syllabi, reading lists, termpaper
     guides, ideas on films and slides, and tips and comments that will be
     of use to the teacher who wants to add a single lecture, or an entire
     course.

     The tone and target audience will be scholarly, and academic standards
     and styles will prevail.  HOLOCAUS is affiliated

     . HOLOCAUS is moderated by Jim Mott (JimMott@spss.com), a PhD in
     History. The moderator will solicit postings (by email, phone and even
     by US mail), will assist people in subscribing and setting up options,
     will handle routine inquiries, and will consolidate some postings. The
     moderator will also solicit and post newsletter type information
     (calls for conferences, for example, or listings of sessions at
     conventions.) It may prove feasible to commission book and article
     reviews, and to post book announcements from publishers.  Anyone with
     suggestions about what HOLOCAUS can and might do is invited to send in
     the ideas.

     To subscribe to HOLOCAUS, you need an Internet or Bitnet computer
     account.  From that account send this message to LISTSERV@uicvm on

HOPOS-L on LISTSERV@UKCC.Bitnet or LISTSERV@UKCC.UKY.EDU  HOPOS-L, the

     all periods in the history of the philosophy of science, from
     antiquity to the twentieth century, extending to related areas of
     investigation in the history of logic, mathematics, and the natural
     and social sciences, and including, as well, diverse methodologies,
     ranging from more internalist, history of ideas approaches to more
     externalist, social and institutional history.

HOSPEX@PLEARN.BITNET

     HOSPEX@PLEARN was created to provide those interested in being a host
     to foreign visitors a way to satisfy their interests.  For those
     interested in finding a host when they are traveling in difference
     countries, this new database will satisfy this interest.

     To subscribe just send mail stating that you want to join to
     HOSPEX@PLEARN. This will be automatically forwarded to one of the
     owners. Of course issuing standard 'SUB HOSPEX your full name' to
     LISTSERV@PLEARN will do as well. You'll be sent a form to be filled
     and returned. This subsribtion procedure is manual, so it may take few
     days sometimes.

     We are looking for lots of users outside the U.S. to subscribe (and
     U.S. users too, but now there are many more U.S. users than an other
     nation).

     Eventually, those who subscribe will be asked to send us a form which
     describes something about yourself, the type of accommodations you
     have, languages you speak, restrictions you want, etc.  When a file
     exists with this information on you, those traveling can look through
     all the files for the countries in which they will be traveling to
     find a host that seems interesting them.  So, this information you
     must eventually send to one of HOSPEX owners is important.

HOSPEX-L on LISTSERV@PLEARN.BITNET                      [Last Update 11/92]

HSPNET-L on LISTSERV@ALBNYDH2

     HSPNET-L provides consultation, a monthly digest, and a data base of
     hospital networks.  It emphasizes restoration and extension of
     consulting for rural hospitals by connection to major medical centers.
     All aspects (hardware, software, staff training, confidentiality of
     patient data, etc) will be covered.  Particular attention will be paid
     to existing networks both in USA and abroad.

     Transmission of both text and medical image data will be considered
     via both land- lines and satellite.  The cost-effectiveness of such
     distance-consulting will be reviewed in the light of declining rural
     hospital acute-care capabilities, and the economic benefits of keeping
     the patient in the rural area.

     Information on how to subscribe follows.

     The HUMAN-GENOME-PROGRAM newsgroup can be received anywhere in the
     world via USENET under the USENET name bionet.molbio.genome-program.

     For those who need to receive messages by regular electronic mail
     instead of through USENET news software, there are four distribution
     points for the HUMAN-GENOME-PROGRAM newsgroup depending upon your
     geographical and network locations:

        1. If you reside in the Americas, to subscribe to the
           HUMAN-GENOME-PROGRAM bulletin board, please send a message
           to the Internet address
           biosci@genbank.bio.net
           This address also serves American BITNET users.
        2. If you use the European Academic Research Network (EARN)
           and live in Continental Europe or Ireland, you can
           subscribe automatically to the newsgroup by sending a
           message containing the line

HUMAN-NETS@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

     Mailing list originally consisting of the combined memberships of
     INFO-PCNET, HOME-SAT, and TELETEXT mailing lists.  Human-Nets has
     discussed many topics, all of them related in some way to the theme of
     a world-wide computer and telecommunications network usually called
     WorldNet.  The topics have ranged very widely, from something like
     tutorials, to state of the art discussions, to rampant speculation
     about technology and its impact.  The list is extremely large, making
     it necessary to batch messages sent to the list and distributing them
     once each day during off peak periods to avoid overloading the system.

     The permanent archives contain all of the material distributed to the
     list.  Due to size, this archive is broken down into several different
     files, stored in reverse temporal order.  The files are currently
     stored on Internet host RU-BLUE in files
     RHYTHM:<PLEASANT.HUMAN-NETS>HUMNET.* (where "*" is a wild-card).

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to
     HUMAN-NETS-REQUEST@ARAMIS.RUTGERS.EDU.

     Moderator: Charles McGrew <MCGREW@RED.RUTGERS.EDU>

HUMANIST%UTOREPAS.BITNET@CORNELLC.CCS.CORNELL.EDU

     HUMANIST is an international electronic discussion group for computing
     Humanists and for those who support the application of computers to
     scholarship in the humanities.  It currently consists of nearly 300
     members in 13 countries in North America, Europe, and the Near East.
     Relevant topics are technical questions about hardware and software,
     specific problems in humanistic scholarship, and both the
     administrative difficulties and philosophical issues arising from the
     application of computing to the humanities; calls for papers,
     bibliographies, and reports of lasting interest are also welcome.

     Interested individuals should send a note together with a brief
     biography to the Coordinator in the following format:

     *Family-name, Given-names <e-mail address>

     Title, mailing address(es), telephone number(s).

     Body of biography.  This should not be a c.v. and need not be very
     detailed but should cover the full range of your professional
     activities and interests, both present and past.  Mention other things
     at your discretion.  Biographies vary considerably in length, though
     few are less than 100 words or more than 500.

HUNGARY on LISTSERV@UCSBVM

     An electronic discussion group on Hungarian issues is now open to
     scholars and students from all disciplines.  Although the working
     language of the group is English, contributions in other languages
     will be accepted and posted.  However, they may not be understood by a
     significant proportion of the membership.

     Electronic mail connections have already been established with three
     Hungarian universities: Budapest Technical University, Budapest
     University of Economic Sciences, and Eotvos Lorand University.

     The group and list server addresses of the new group, based at the
     University of California, Santa Barbara, are:

           hungary@ucsbvm.bitnet    For mail to broadcast to the list ONLY
           listserv@ucsbvm.bitnet   For commands or to subscribe

     To subscribe to the discussion group, send an e-mail message, without
     any subject, to the list server address, listserv@ucsbvm.bitnet,
     containing the single line:

     subscribe hungary "your name"

     with your own name, not your e-mail address, inserted in place of the
     phrase "your name," without quotes.

     Once you have subscribed, any messages which you want to circulate to
     the group should be sent to the group address, hungary@ucsbvm.bitnet.

     The list is moderated, and will be edited by:

     HUNTING on LISTSERV@TAMVM1.TAMU.EDU

     This is a reflection of the moderated Usenet group 'rec.hunting' for
     those folks that prefer to read this group via mail instead of a
     newsreader.

     Rec.hunting (and the LISTSERV list hunting) is a moderated group for
     the discussion of hunting related issues.  These include, but are not
     limited to, methods, locations, seasons, laws, and hunting ethics.
     Posts about the morality of hunting will be rejected (this is, in
     fact, the reason this group is moderated).

     To subscribe to the LISTSERV portion of this group, send a mail
     message to either LISTSERV@TAMVM1 (bitnet) or LISTSERV@TAMVM1.TAMU.EDU
     (internet) with no subject.  Include as the *only* text in the body of
     the message:

     SUBSCRIBE HUNTING your-first-name your-last-name

     HYPBAR-L provides an unmoderated environment where issues, questions,
     comments, ideas, and procedures can be discussed.  In a broad sense,
     this includes virtually anything dealing with medicine in relation to
     diving and HyperBaric Medicine.

     The explicit purpose of HYPBAR-L is to provide timely interchange
     between subscribers, to provide a forum where interesting questions
     can be addressed within the context of interactive exchange between
     many individuals, to discuss the evolution and application of
     HyperBaric and Diving Medicine, to announce professional meetings,
     calls for papers, and any additional information that would be of
     interest.

     As is the case on all unmoderated lists, the discussion and topics are
     only limited by the participation and interest of its subscribers.
     Subscribers are welcome to take an active role by posting and/or an
     inactive role by monitoring the list.  Although not necessary for
     participation, it shall be assumed that all subscribers are basically
     familiar with the medical jargon that is used on this list.

     To subscribe to HYPBAR-L, please send mail or file to
     LISTSERV@TECHNION or listserv@technion.technion.ac.il and place in the
     body of the text the line

     SUB HYPBAR-L <your name>.

     This list does not support nor is supported by any medical group or
     medical installation.  This list was created due to requests by
     several individuals within the medical community located in different
     countries.

     that only one user (BBOARD) is subscribed.  The messages from each
     mailing list will then be posted in a separate Notes conference.

     There is no automated archive retrieval facility.  However, requests
     for archived material may be sent to the I-BBReq address below.

     This will be done in the following way:

        1) Answering questions (doubts about a topic from a class, project,etc)
        2) Presenting and discussion of interviews from experts
        3) Presenting and discussion projects around the world
        4) Sending out a periodical general information about a topic
        5) Sending out information about simposiums, meetings, bibliography, etc.

IBM-SRD on LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 or
     LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu

     IBM-SRD is a discussion list for things relating to the IBM Screen
     Reader Product.

     The IBM Screen reader is a hardware/software combination that enables
     a blind user to navigate around the screen when a speech synthesizer
     is attatched to the computer.  What I hope to establish is a user's
     forum to discuss aspects of the use and programming of Screen Reader.

     The list can be subscribed to by sending mail to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 on
     BITNET (or LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu) with the TEXT of the mail saying:
     SUB IBM-SRD yourfirstname yourlastname

     There will also be an archive site at ndsuvm1 of Screen Reader
     materials - essentially source code in Screen Reader's Profile Access
     Language which is the mechanism one uses to teach Screen Reader about
     different application programs.  For e-mail access send mail to
     LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 (or LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu) with the commands

           INDEX IBM-SRD
           GET SRD-0001 README

     in the text (body) of the message.  (Be sure to send these to LISTSERV
     and NOT to the list).

     You may also use FTP to connect to vm1.nodak.edu (134.129.111.1) using
     userid anonymous and any password.  Enter CD IBM-SRD and DIR to see
     what files are available.

IFIP-DIALUP@ics.uci.edu                                 [Last Updated 1/92]

     The <ifip-dialup@ics.uci.edu> mailing list was set up to support an ad
     hoc open task group of volunteers to work under the aegis of IFIP
     Working Group 6.5 in the Pre-Standards Development Mode, rather than
     in the Post-Standards Profiling or Implementation Agreements Mode, or
     in the IETF/IAB Standards Development Mode.  It does however draw on
     the concepts, traditions and expertise of all of these other standards
     activities.

     The purpose of this list is to discuss the issues related to provision
     of "local loop" PSTN dialup service for mail transfers between
     X.400/X.500 service host systems (MTA, MS, UA) and to develop draft
     specifications for experimental implementation of such a service.

     It is intended and expected that one or more openly available
     experimental implementations will be forthcoming after specifications
     are completed, and before any formal standards work is initiated.

     Although the ad hoc DIALUP Task Group is open to anyone, it is not
     intended to be a news group with a broad mission to educate.  The list
     was established to foster serious work by experts in the field.  New
     members are expected to do their homework before entering the
     discussion.

     IFIP-DIALUP is not distributed to any USENET newsgroup.  It is only
     served by an INTERNET mailing list exploder at ICS.UCI.EDU.

     Archives of ifip-dialup are available from an automatic server at
     ICS.UCI.EDU.  For more information, send a request for archive
     information to ifip-dialup-request@ics.uci.edu.

     IFIP-DIALUP is NOT a LISTSERV mailing list.  Administration is manual.
     To subscribe, send your request to <ifip-dialup-request@ics.uci.edu>.
     DO NOT SEND subscription requests to the main discussion list.

     Include your Full Name and be sure that your subscription netmail
     address is in a CC of your request message.  This CC address will help

india-in-languages@ee.rochester.edu                      [Last Update 5/93]

     This list will provide an online insight into languages of the Indian
     subcontinent.  There are at least twenty major languages in the area;
     a diversity unequalled by a continent like Europe.  Participating
     members include speakers of various languages.  As a lot of similarity
     exists between the languages we shortly expect to evolve a common
     code, that would act as a standard for future such efforts. There are
     almost a million Indians living in the USA and countless others have
     email access alll over the world. There are also numerous scholars of
     Indian languages who would benefit from this effort.

INFO-1100@TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU

     This discussion list focuses on the Xerox/Envos Lisp environment and
     the associated protocols.  Its purpose is to stimulate communication
     and sharing between computer science research groups that use or are
     interested in the environment.  The list may be used for messages such
     as announcements of available lispusers packages or for queries such
     as "Does anybody know of a PUP file server implementation for the
     Sinclair ZX-80?"  or to warn others of Interlisp-D and Medley bugs
     and/or suggest workarounds or to solicit help or discussion.

     Xerox PARC, SIS, and Envos people are included in the distribution to
     facilitate communication about new developments, bugs, performance
     issues, etc..  Additionally, Info-1100 is automatically forwarded to
     AISupport.pasa@Xerox.com, where bugs are noted and acted upon if
     appropriate.  Xerox AIS and Envos employees will not respond in
     Info-1100 unless the reply is of general interest or silence would
     mislead the readership.  This mailing list is also distributed as the
     usenet newsgroup comp.sys.xerox.

     A historical note describing the name:  The Lisp environment was
     originally implemented on Xerox' 1100-series workstations, and the
     user base is primarily still on 1108's, 1109's, and 1186's.

     Requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc. should be sent to

Info-Andrew@ANDREW.CMU.EDU

     An informal mailing list intended for general discussion by recipients
     of the Andrew distribution (and implementors of Andrew).  Andrew, a
     joint project of Carnegie Mellon University & IBM, is a prototype
     computing environment for academic and research use under the UNIX
     operating system.  There are four main parts to Andrew:

        - The Andrew File System (AFS), a large-scale distributed
          central file system.
        - The Andrew Toolkit (ATK), a toolkit for building complex
          graphical user interface programs in a window-manager
          independent way (currently runs on X11 and the old Andrew
          window manager)
        - The Andrew Message System (AMS), a multi-media mail and
          bulletin board system compatible with non-multi-media
          systems
        - The Andrew application programs, a suite of programs that
          use the ATK to provide various useful features.

     Topics can include (but are not limited to):

           - hints about using/building Andrew
           - discussions about desired features, changes, etc.
           - comments about the Andrew distribution (e.g., "it stinks", "it's
             great")
           - questions about the availability/existence of other parts of Andrew

     The mailing list is available in both Andrew multi-media format (if
     you have the AMS up and running) and plain-text format.  By default
     you will be sent plain-text versions of the posts, but you can request
     a change in which version you receive by sending mail to the -Request
     address.  When sending a message to this list, you should feel free to
     include any multi-media images (rasters, animations, etc.) which might
     help to express you question, comment, etc.  Such images will
     automatically be stripped out and replaced by "A picture appeared
     here" before being redistributed to the plain-text recipients.

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to Info-Andrew-Request@ANDREW.CMU.EDU.
     NOTE: All subscription requests will also be added to the
     Info-Andrew-Bugs distribution list unless specifically requested not
     to.

     Coordinator: Adam Stoller <ghoti+@ANDREW.CMU.EDU>

Info-Andrew-Bugs@ANDREW.CMU.EDU

     Mailing list for reporting bugs/problems with the Andrew distribution.
     (See Info-Andrew entry for more detailed description on what "Andrew"
     is).  Official responses to queries and bug reports will be posted to
     this mailing list.  Topics include:

           - problems discovered in building the distribution
           - problems discovered in running parts of the distribution
           - questions about difficulties encountered (even if you're not sure
             they're bugs)

     When sending a message to this list, you should feel free to include
     any multi-media images (rasters, animations, etc.), that might help to
     clarify a bug report.  Such images will automatically be stripped out
     and replaced by "A picture appeared here" before being redistributed
     to the plain-text recipients.

     The list will be moderated, so that all bugs can be tracked and
     referenced with patch files.  We expect that posts will go out to the
     subscribers about once a week, summarizing those reports which have
     been fixed and those still being looked into.

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to
     Info-Andrew-Bugs-Request@ANDREW.CMU.EDU.  NOTE: All subscription
     requests will also be added to the Info-Andrew distribution list
     unless specifically requested not to.

Info-AS400@Joiner.BITNET
     or Info-AS400@Joiner.COM

     This is a "how-to" discussion on IBM AS/400 architecture, systems, and
     software.  It is for the discussion of most topics, including
     hardware, systems and applications programming, networking, and
     connectivity.  IBM and third-party solutions may be discussed.

     The list is primarily aimed at system administrators, managers, and
     programmers.  Because this is an Internet/BITNET list, the use of
     AS/400 systems in research and education, and in the context of
     cooperative interational networks, is certain to be of interest.

     It is hoped that beginners will turn to the list for answers to their
     questions, and that more experienced participants will provide gentle
     answers.

     These topics should be avoided, as they will get in the way of our
     discussions of how to solve real problems with the systems we have:
     (1) the merits of IBM AS/400 products relative to their competitors,
     (2) product announcements, and (3) IBM bashing.  (Other topics may be
     added to this list in the future.)

        Owner:   Info-AS400-Request@Joiner.COM (IBM AS/400 Discussion Coordinator)
                 Arnold@Joiner.COM (Stephen L. Arnold)

     Notes:

        1. This list is unmoderated.  Submissions to Info-AS400@Joiner
           (Info-AS400@Joiner.COM) are immediately forwarded to the
           list.
        2. This is not a LISTSERV list and requests for list changes
           are handled manually by the coordinator.  Send requests to
           update the list to Info-AS400-Request@Joiner.COM.  The list
           is a PMDF distribution list hosted on a VAX system running
           VMS.
        3. Contributions sent to this list are manually archived.
           Requests for old postings will be answered by the
           coordinator.  Send such requests to
           Info-AS400-Request@Joiner.COM.  If there is sufficient
           demand for automatic subscription and archive service, I'll
           explore ways to provide it.

     LISTSERV provides access to files for everyone who can send mail,
     independent of their location.  On Bitnet messages should be sent to
     your nearest LISTSERV (the one from which you receive the info-atari
     digests); if your address is not on Bitnet, an address for file
     servers is given below.  All mail sent to LISTSERV contains command
     lines.  LISTSERV will respond by return mail.  No subject is necessary
     in such mail.  For more information send the command INFO

     The list_name for 16-bit Ataris is INFO-A16.  The list_name for 8-bit
     Ataris is INFO-A8.  These list names are used by Bitnet addressees for
     subscribing and unsubscribing and by everyone for obtaining back
     copies of news digests.  The list_names for programs stored in the
     archives are PROG-A16 and PROG-A8.

     You can obtain copies of files from LISTSERV by sending a message in
     the specified format.  To obtain a list of files in the file server,
     the command is INDEX list_name The command to obtain a specific file
     is GET list_name file_name for example, GET INFO-A16 87-00076 If you
     want to learn more, send the message HELP

     If you are on Bitnet you may add or remove yourself from the
     distribution list.  The command to join the list is SUBSCRIBE

     DSEE elegantly and efficiently solves many common problems -- how to
     work on multiple versions of a program at a time, how to tell when
     someone has made a change you need to know about, how to develop
     software for multiple target machines, how to KNOW the right version
     of each source file was used, etc.

     If all this sounds like hype, join the mailing list, and listen to
     users.

     At least initially, the list will not be moderated or digested; if the
     volume is sufficient, this may change.  Mail to the list will be
     archived in some public place that will be announced at a later date.

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,

info-frame@AEROSPACE.AERO.ORG

     Mailing list for System Frameworks.  This group is designed to provide
     information for software tool developers that are responsible for
     integrating heterogenous software products.  This can include in-house
     and vendor supplied.  Usually, the integration of the products is
     designed to provide an environment that makes using the tools easier.
     The basic issue is to build a `framework' around the tools that
     provides a common and consistent view of the system.  The framework is
     not limited to homogeneous environments, but also can span
     heterogeneous systems.  Companies like EDA and government sponsored
     projects like EIS are trying to tackle this problem.  This group can
     be viewed as a forum for users and developers to voice their opinions
     on this subject.  Frameworks are common in the area of CAD/CAE, CASE
     and office automation; but they are not limited to only these areas.
     Topics open for discussion are:

           Process Control/Flow   Data Transfer Languages     Tool Portability
           Tool encapsulation     Data Management                          Network Computing
           User Interface         Object Programming                       Anything Else

INFO-FUTURES@World.STD.COM

     Digest to provide a speculative forum for analyzing current and likely
     events in technology as they will affect our near future in computing
     and related areas.  In broad terms, topics of interest include
     developments in both computing research and industry which are likely
     to affect our decision making, particularly decisions we are probably
     grappling with right this minute.  Technologies can change so rapidly
     that simply forecasting for needs within any organization one or two
     years in advance can be extremely difficult, frequently we are forced
     to provide foundations that effectively lock us into a technology for
     longer periods of time. It is hoped the information this list provides
     can help both the practitioner and researcher determine where best to
     expend resources.

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,

     Mailing list covering topics in computer aided molecular biology and
     of particular interest to users and managers of the "Genetics Computer
     Group" software from the University of Wisconsin.

     BitNet users can subscribe by sending the following command to
     LISTSERV@ UTORONTO:  SUBscribe INFO-GCG your_full_name where
     your_full_name is your real name, not your loginid. Non-BitNet users

info-gnu-msdos@wugate.wustl.edu

     The GNUISH MsDos Development Group

     The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is not directly interested in
     integrating or maintaining ports of GNU software to MS-DOS, because of
     limited resources.  These activities take time away from finishing a
     complete standalone GNU, which FSF and many in the GNU Project
     considers much more important.

     There is a mailing list to discuss these MsDos ports of GNU software.
     It is called info-gnu-msdos@wugate.wustl.edu.  It is managed by an
     experimental Unix-based listserv program.  Send the command:

     add info-gnu-msdos to:  listserv@wugate.wustl.edu

     to become subscribed to the list.  Send a message containing only
     'help' to get more information about the listserv.  Do not send these
     commands to info-gnu-msdos.  They should go to the listserv address.

     The list is not moderated, not digestified, and open to subscription
     by anyone.  Problems with the mailing list should be directed to:

     info-gnu-msdos-request@wugate.wustl.edu

     To get more information about the GNUISH project, look at the file on
     wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4) in the mirrors/msdos/gnuish
     directory called '00msdos.gnu'.

INFO-HAMS@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

     A mailing list for Amateur Radio (not CB) operators.  INFO-HAMS is
     gatewayed to/from Usenet's rec.ham-radio so Usenet people will get it
     there.

     Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail
     files named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one
     into another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve
     disk space, all the mail files in the archive, except for the current
     year, are individually compressed.  The compressed files have the
     suffix -Z as part of the filetype field; they should be renamed to
     have the suffix .Z (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so
     the uncompress program will find them.  The current month's mail is
     still kept in HAMS-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
     PD2:<ARCHIVES.HAMS> Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP for
     those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

     Phil Howard KA9WGN <PHIL%UIUCVMD.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU> also archives
     the INFO-HAMS mailing list on BITNET node UIUCVMD using the LISTSERV
     mailing list server (subscriptions disabled for this).  Users on
     BITNET may request files to be sent to them by sending commands,
     either by interactive message or in the message body by mail, to the
     address LISTSERV@UIUCVMD.  The command to see the current online list
     of files is:  INDEX INFOHAMS (Note there is no dash "-").  To obtain
     volume 88 issue 73, send the command:  GET INFOHAMS 88-00073 INFO-HAMS
     is a digested mailing list, and each digest is available separately
     from LISTSERV@UIUCVMD.

     All Internet requests to be added to or deleted from this list,
     problems, questions, etc., should be sent to

Info-IBMPC@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

     Info-IBMPC is a forum for technical discussion of the IBM Personal
     Computer and compatible micro-computers, providing a way for
     interested members of the Internet community to compare notes, ask
     questions, and share insights of a technical nature about these
     machines.  While it is not primarily a consumer's guide to the IBM PC,
     the digest may also be useful for that purpose.

     Messages are collected, edited into digests and distributed as the
     volume of mail dictates (generally twice a week).  All messages
     regarding hardware for IBM PCs, PC and compatibles and software are
     welcomed; messages on other topics will not be run.  In addition, two
     topics are taboo and are routinely edited out: (1) self promotion of
     products for sale, and (2) anything about copy protection.

     An archive of back issues and a program library are available to those
     with FTP access (essentially anyone on the Internet).  Digests are
     archived at WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL in PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC> in
     <YYMM.1-TXT> format.  Digests from September 1982 through the current
     issue are available by ANONYMOUS FTP login.

     A library of free software in binary and source code form is
     maintained at SIMTEL20 in directory PD1:<MSDOS> and PD2:<MSDOS2>.  A
     list of all MS-DOS programs available from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL is
     contained in PD1:<MSDOS>FILES.IDX.  Donations of source code are
     welcomed.  Donated programs must be truly free and public domain, with
     no fee or contribution required or requested, and no license
     agreement.  To donate a program to the library, send a description of
     the program along with a copy of the source code to
     INFO-IBMPC-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

     Files may be FTP'ed by logging in to the SIMTEL20 FTP server with
     username ANONYMOUS, password GUEST.  (Although GUEST is a perfectly
     good password, a password of <YOUR-NAME@YOUR-HOST> is preferred.)  For
     those subscribers without Internet FTP access, a file transfer
     mechanism has been set up with RPIECS.bitnet.  For more details, send
     a message to <LISTSERV@RPIECS.bitnet> with the first line of 'HELP' or
     ask the editor for the Simtel-Bitnet FTP help file.  Requested files
     are mailed to those users with a VALID Internet return address.

     WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL can be accessed using LISTSERV commands from
     BITNET and those users without Internet FTP access via
     LISTSERV@NDSUVM1, LISTSERV@RPIECS, LISTSERV@FINTUVM and in Europe from
     EARN TRICKLE servers.  Send commands to LISTSERV or
     TRICKLE@<host-name> (example: TRICKLE@TREARN).  The following TRICKLE
     servers are presently available: AWIWUW11 (Austria), BANUFS11
     (Belgium), DKTC11 (Denmark), DB0FUB11 (Germany), IMIPOLI (Italy),
     EB0UB011 (Spain) TAUNIVM (Israel) and TREARN (Turkey).

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to
     INFO-IBMPC-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

     BITNET users must join the INFO-IBMPC distribution list through the
     BITNET LISTSERV mechanism.  There are IBMPC-L BITNET sub-distribution
     lists at the following BITNET hosts: BNANDP11, UTORONTO, CEARN, DEARN,
     EB0UB011, FINHUTC, HEARN, VTVM1, POLYGRAF, $$INFOPC@RICEVM1, TAMVM1,
     TAUNIVM, UBVM, UGA, and VTVM2.  BitNet subscribers can join by sending
     a SUB command to the nearest LISTSERV node or to
     <LISTSERV@POLYGRAF.bitnet>.  For example:  SEND LISTSERV@CEARN SUB
     IBMPC-L Jon Doe To be removed from the list substitute the keyword
     "SIGNOFF" for "SUB".  To make contributions to the list, BITNET
     subscribers should send mail to <INFO-IBMPC@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL>
     and NOT to the BITNET list name.

     For those users on USENET, the Digest is available from newsfeed
     comp.sys.ibm.pc.digest.  Since the current editor does not have a
     USENET feed, please include <INFO-IBMPC@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL> as a
     CC: address on all messages sent to USENET.

     On BITNET, the archives can be obtained from DATABASE@BITNIC.BITNET
     and the program library can be obtained from CCUC@UMCVMB.BITNET.  The
     WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL FTP server may also be reached via

INFO-KERMIT@WATSUN.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU

     Kermit is a file transfer protocol developed at Columbia University in
     New York City, USA, for use primarily between micros and mainframes
     over asynchronous serial connections, dialed or direct, over public
     data networks, etc.  Kermit programs that implement this protocol can
     transfer textual as well as binary files over both 7-bit and 8-bit
     communication links, singly or in groups.  As of this writing (May
     1989), Kermit programs are available for nearly 350 different
     computers and operating systems.  The Info-Kermit mailing list is a
     digest intended for people who maintain or install Kermit at their
     sites, or who are (thinking about) working on a new implementation, or
     who have bugs and/or fixes to report, or who are interested in
     discussing the protocol, and also for Kermit users.  The digest is
     available on Internet, CSNET, MAILNET, BITNET, EARN, USENET, CCNET,
     DEC EASYNET, and any other network gatewayed to the Internet.

     Info-Kermit archives are collected in kermit/e/imail.*, one file
     (paginaged and indexed) per volume, generally 2 volumes per year.
     Other Kermit files are also available via both Internet and
     BitNet/EARN and by mail order.

info-labview@pica.army.mil

     Info-LabVIEW is an internet mailing list for the discussion of the use
     of National Instruments' LabVIEW package for the Apple Macintosh.

     LabVIEW is a graphical software system for developing high-performance
     scientific and engineering applications. LabVIEW acquires data from
     IEEE-488 (GPIB), RS-232/422 and modular (VXI or CAMAC) instruments and
     plug-in data acquisition boards.

     LabVIEW programs, called "virtual instruments" (VIs), are created
     using icons, instead of conventional, text-based code. A VI consists
     of a front panel and a block diagram. The front panel (with knobs,
     switches, graphs, and so on) is the user interface. The block diagram,
     which is the executable code, consists of icons that operate on data
     connected by wires that pass data between them.  [I swiped this
     description from National Instruments' promotional blurbs]

     The list is being run as a simple redistribution of all submitted
     messages.

     To post to the list, send your mail to <info-labview@pica.army.mil>.
     All administrative issues should go to

INFO-M2@UCF1VM.CC.UCF.EDU

     A discussion list for the Modula-2 programming language.  Modula-2 is
     a language by Niklaus Wirth which extends the Pascal foundation by
     providing an updated statement syntax (generalized LOOP, EXIT, RETURN,
     no GOTO), separate compilation with a module (compilation unit) broken
     into specification and implementation parts with importing and
     exporting of objects, controlled machine level access, and concurrent
     programming and coroutines.  Modula-2 has most of the power of Ada but
     is small enough that excellent full implementations exist for CP/M 80.

     Contributions may be sent to INFO-M2@ucf1vm.Bitnet (from the US) or to
     INFO-M2@db0tui11.Bitnet (from Europe); these are both entry points for
     the same list.

     Currrent messages are archived on host WSMR.SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL in file

INFO-MAC@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU

     Network interest group for the Apple Macintosh computer. This list is
     SUMEX's contribution to the community of research and instructional
     developers and users of the Macintosh; all submissions of messages and
     programs in this spirit are welcome.

     For those sites with FTP access to SUMEX-AIM, archives for INFO-MAC
     are kept under {SUMEX-AIM}/info-mac/digest/infomacvM-NNN, where M is
     the volume number and NNN is the digest number.  These numbers have
     little to no bearing on reality.

     Programs submitted to the bulletin board, along with documentation
     files and other references are also stored in the info-mac directory.
     With FTP access as user "anonymous" and any password, you can bring
     these files over to your host and download them to your Macintosh.
     "Usenet" and some of the other networks that copy info-mac will see
     sources redistributed at the time they are mentioned in the digest
     distributions.

     Messages to INFO-MAC@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU are scanned to filter out
     any list requests, questions previously answered, pure speculation or
     opinion, or message obviously not in line with the stated purpose of
     the list.

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to
     INFO-MAC-REQUEST@SUMEX-AIM.STANFORD.EDU.  Due to the size of this
     list, INFO-MAC only sends to relays, i.e. addresses such as

INFO-MICRO@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

     Information/discussion list on the general interest topic of
     microcomputers.

     Questions/discussions on a particular Operating System, such as CP/M,
     should be addressed to the specific list if one already exists (such
     as INFO-CPM@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL for this example).

     Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail
     files named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one
     into another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve
     disk space, all the mail files in the archive, except for the current
     year, are individually compressed.  The compressed files have the
     suffix -Z as part of the filetype field; they should be renamed to
     have the suffix .Z (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so
     the uncompress program will find them.  The current month's mail is
     still kept in INFO-MICRO-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in
     directory:  PD2:<ARCHIVES.INFO-MICRO> Archive files are available via
     ANONYMOUS FTP for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

     Many megabytes of public domain software are kept in the program
     archives.  For a description of these archives, request a copy of the
     "archive blurb" from INFO-MICRO-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL. All
     correspondence and program archives described here are available to
     Internet users via FTP with user-name ANONYMOUS.

     Archives are kept on VM1.NODAK.EDU in the directory "listserv" in
     files:  MINIX-L.LOGyymmw where "yy" is the year, "mm" is the numeric
     month and "w" is an alphabetic character from A to E indicating what
     week of the month.  Several months of log files are kept online, the
     number depending on available disk space.  Archives are also available
     from a number of other sources, including a mail server.  You can
     obtain information on these sites by sending mail to
     LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU with text/body:  GET MINIX INFO MINIX and you
     will be sent the "Minix Information Sheet", which also contains other
     general information on MINIX, such as what versions exist and how to

Info-MM@COLUMBIA.EDU BUG-MM@COLUMBIA.EDU

     The Info-MM/Bug-MM mailing lists are a way for Columbia-MM maintainers
     and sites running MM to communicate, distribute patches, get bug
     reports, send comments, suggestions, enhancements, etc.

     Columbia-MM is a UNIX mail manager program based on the TOPS-20 MM
     program running on Digital Equipment Corporation DEC20 systems.
     Columbia-MM is written in C using the CCMD (TOPS-20 COMND Jsys in C)
     package developed at Columbia University, and thus has
     command/keyword/filename completion (on ESC or TAB), context sensitive
     help on "?", command history and command line editing.

     MM is compatible with various other mail programs, and has hooks for
     adding more in the future.  MM has support for several mail file
     formats: "mtxt" which is the MM-20 format on DEC20's, "mbox" used by
     UNIX mail(1), and "babyl" the format of Gnuemacs rmail mode.  Support
     for mh(1), pop (post office protocol), and usenet news are planned for
     the future.

     Sources are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from CUNIXF.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU

     but they are available on BITNIC for Bitnet users.  Old archives are
     not currently available, but if demand warrants it may be possible to
     retrieve them.

     All non-BitNet requests to be added to or deleted from this list,
     problems, questions, etc., should be sent to
     INFO-NETS-REQUEST@THINK.COM.  Multiple users at a given site should
     create a local distribution list and request that the local alias be

     mailer.

     There is a BitNet sub-distribution list, INFONETS@BITNIC; BitNet
     subscribers can join by sending the SUB command with your name. For
     example, SEND LISTSERV@BITNIC SUB INFONETS Jon Doe To be removed from
     the list, SEND LISTSERV@BITNIC SIGNOFF To make contributions to the

info-prograph@grove.iup.edu                  [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     Users of the Macintosh programming language Prograph now have their
     own Internet list! To subscribe to this list, send an Email message to
     info-prograph-request@grove.iup.edu

     We aren't using any automated subscription process, so no special
     syntax is required.  Just say you want to subscribe, and I'll add your
     name to the list.  Prograph, for those who have not seen it before, is
     an icon-based object-oriented programming language, published by TGS
     Systems, Halifax, Nova Scotia.  My only connection with TGS is that I
     own Prograph, and am beta-testing the 2.5 version, and that they have
     subscribed to the list.  Prograph includes an application "shell",
     which makes it easy to quickly generate prototypes of your
     application.  Unlike other application generators, such as Serius
     Developer or AppMaker, Prograph is a complete and self-contained
     programming language, with full access to the Mac Toolbox (including
     System 7 calls).  The versatile Interpreter lets you quickly test and
     debug your code, actually allowing you to add new code *while your app
     is running*!  Once you have your application debugged, the Compiler
     lets you turn it into a standalone, double-clickable Mac application,
     which you are free to distribute as you see fit (no licensing fees are
     required).

INFO-TMODEM@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL
     BUG-TMODEM@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

     The INFO-TMODEM list is a means for the maintainer of the TMODEM
     program to send notices to users of TMODEM.  Users of TMODEM send bug
     reports and feature requests to BUG-TMODEM@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

     TMODEM is a new TOPS-20 implementation of the Christensen Protocol,
     with all the latest features, such as:

           o  wildcard file transfers in the style of MODEM7 (YMODEM batch is coming)
           o  the YMODEM implementation of the K option with a new algorithm
              to return to K mode after falling back to "normal" mode
           o  extensive built-in HELP for all commands and options.

     TMODEM is an amalgamation of the old TOPS-20 MODEM program, originally
     written by Bill Westfield while he was at SRI and now at Stanford,
     major pieces of the TOPS-20 TELNET program, currently maintained by
     Mark Crispin, and some pieces of code stolen from TTLINK and KERMIT-20
     by Frank da Cruz at Columbia University.

     The archives for replaced mailing list INFO-MODEMXX are frozen on host
     WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files named yymm.n-TXT, where n
     starts with one and increments by one into another file as each file
     reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, all the mail files in
     the archive, except for the current year, are individually compressed.
     The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part of the filetype field;
     they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z (uppercase Z) when
     transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program will find them.
     The current month's mail is still kept in MODEMXX-ARCHIV.TXT.  The
     archives are stored in directory:  PD2:<ARCHIVES.MODEMXX> Archive
     files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL for
     those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

INFO-TPU@SHSU.BITNET

     INFO-TPU is a list to provide an unmoderated environment where issues,
     questions, comments, ideas, and uses of Digital's TPU (Text Processing
     Utility) language can be discussed.

     The explicit purpose of INFO-TPU is to provide timely interchange
     between subscribers, to provide a forum where interesting questions
     can be addressed within the context of interactive exchange between
     many individuals, to discuss the evolution and application of TPU.
     The discussions of INFO-TPU will be archived and available for
     reference.  Additionally, it is hoped that INFO-TPU will be able to
     serve as a repository for interesting TPU applications placed in the
     public domain.  As is the case on all unmoderated lists, the
     discussion and topics are only limited by the participation and
     interest of its subscribers.  Subscribers are welcome to take an
     active role by posting to INFO-TPU or an inactive role by monitoring
     the list.

     To subscribe to INFO-TPU, please send a MAIL message to:
     LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET The body of this MAIL message should be one line
     and contain the words:  SUBSCRIBE INFO-TPU

INGRES-L%HDETUD1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

     Mailing list for discussion of all relevant aspects of the INGRES
     RDBMS. A secondary purpose is to function as a medium for
     communication between the users of Ingres at the universities of Delft
     and Rotterdam; such messages may be in Dutch, but should begin with a
     warning that they are intended for these users only.

     Discussion may include any topic related to the subject, such as
     problems in implementing, tuning or using the product in any
     environment (MS/DOS, UNIX, VMS, CMS, MVS or a combination of any of
     these), conversion to new versions (such as from Version-5 to
     Version-6), announcements of conferences, etc.

     BitNet users may subscribe by sending the following command:  TELL

INGRAFX on LISTSERV@PSUVM

     INGRAFX is a listserv devoted to the interdisciplinary areas of
     cartography, information graphics and scientific visualization.  As
     owner of the list, I would like to invite all those who have an
     interest in the broad range of images known as "graphics" (maps,
     photographs, drawings and information or quantitative graphics) to
     consider signing up.

     Please do not take these requirements too formally!  Ideally, the
     discussion will be uninhibited and free-flowing.

     Candidate topics for discussion might be; the relation of maps to
     graphics as a whole (are they different kinds of representation?); the
     philosophy of graphic representation (what theories are there of
     graphic representations, and how does a graphic "represent" segments
     of the world); how can we use graphics in education; to what extent
     does "graphicacy" matter in today's world; what is the relationship
     between academic or scientific graphics, and graphics in the popular
     media; can we or should we accrue rules for "good" graphics; are there
     graphic variables or elements that are basic to all graphics, and can
     these be used in animation?

     In general our aim is for an informal discussion which is
     cross-disciplinary, and about graphics.

     ***How to Join in***

     Curious to see what's going on so far?  Why not sign up now?

     Sign up in the usual way for LISTSERVs, i.e., send mail to
     LISTSERV@PSUVM on BITNET or LISTSERV@PSUVM.PSU.EDU on Internet with
     the following command in the TEXT:  SUB INGRAFX your firstname and
     last name

     Once you are a subscriber you can retrieve any files that have been
     archived on the listserv, including the monthly discussion logs, and
     other files of interest.  To see what is there, either TELL or send a
     email note to LISTSERV AT PSUVM or LISTSERV AT PSUVM.PSU.EDU with the
     command INDEX INGRAFX .  Once you have decided on a file you can
     retrieve it by using the GET command.  E.g., TELL LISTSERV AT PSUVM
     GET 'File name', or GET 'Another file'.

     Post by sending email to ingrafx@psuvm.

     Owner:  "Jeremy Crampton" <ELE@PSUVM> or <ele@psuvm.psu.edu>

     ***Future Discussions on the List***

     As a geographer/cartographer, I am particularly interested in getting
     fellow cartographers to join in the debate.  Especially students.
     However, one of the goals of the list is to broaden cartographic
     debate to include consideration of the many forms and roles of
     graphics in today's highly visual world.

     To this end, the list will be interdisciplinary.  It will seek to
     include people from the worlds of information graphics (see the work
     by Edward Tufte for one position on this), scientific visualization,
     and the media (_USA Today_ style graphics?...)

     To my knowledge there does not yet exist such an interdisciplinary
     forum for the discussion of graphics as a whole.

     I would also like to have people share their graphics.  This can be
     done by compressing and converting a file to binary form.  I do not
     encourage posting of these files to the list, but those people
     interested in swapping graphics should describe what they have, and
     what they'd like to see, on the INGRAFX list.

     Transactions could then take place over private email, with a list of
     available graphics being held in our archives.

     Reviews, either of software, books or articles on graphics, are also
     especially encouraged.  If you have been asked to write one and can't
     wait to see it in "print," send it to INGRAFX (retaining your
     copyright).

     We aim to create an informal environment for the discussion of all
     issues related to graphics.  This might also include discussion of
     ideas you are working on for future articles, or research projects
     announcements of job openings, interesting graphics you have
     discovered, or just general commentary with a graphic flavor.

     IOUDAIOS on LISTSERV@YORKVM1

     IOUDAIOS (Greek for "Jew") is an electronic seminar devoted to the
     exploration of first-century Judaism; its special interest is in the
     writings of Philo of Alexandria and Flavius Josephus.  The list began
     as an informal discussion of two papers by Robert A. Kraft
     (Pennsylvania) but quickly blossomed into an international forum, with
     participants in North America, Europe, Australia, and The Middle East.

     The Philonic and Josephan corpora are extensive enough that they
     invite all sorts of analysis -- from literary, historical, and
     philosophical perspectives, to name a few.  There is also considerable
     interest, among participants, in the social realities that lie behind
     these texts.  Prospective members are warmly welcomed.  (The
     discussion assumes a significant background in first-century Judaism
     and also the ability to read Greek.)

     To subscribe to this list send a mail/note message to LISTSERV@YORKVM1
     (LISTSERV%YORKVM1.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU for Internet users) with the

IPCT-L on LISTSERV@GUVM or LISTSERV@GUVM.GEORGETOWN.EDU

     The Interpersonal Computing and Technology List (IPCT-L) was created
     by the Center for Teaching and Technology (CTT) at the Academic
     Computer Center, Georgetown University.  A special effort will be made
     to promote an international forum for pedagogical issues important to
     higher education involving teaching with technology, and especially
     with connectivity and networking.

     A goal is to create a forum for the discussion of computing and other
     technology that can be used to promote learning.  Topics for
     discussion may involve teaching and training; collaboration;
     partnerships among learners, faculty or teachers, and other interested
     persons in the educational community; and research that reflect these
     interests.  The decade of the 1980s was characterized by the
     _personal_ computer, and development of individual product- ivity.
     The focus of the IPCT-L, as we move toward the 21st century, is that
     _interpersonal_ computing and technology will tie persons together
     throughout the world -- to share ideas and solve problems.

     Besides creating a forum for the topics of interest noted above,
     another interest of the CTT is to publish a scholarly, refereed
     international journal.  To that end, the IPCT-L will develop a
     subscription list and act as a resource to develop the community
     necessary to review articles and recommend editorial policies as these
     publishing goals move forward.

     To subscribe send the following in an interactive command (TELL or
     SEND) or in the BODY of mail (NOT the Subject:) to LISTSERV@GUVM on
     Bitnet, or LISTSERV@GUVM.GEORGETOWN.EDU on Internet:

iPSC <ipsclist@TCGOULD.TN.CORNELL.EDU>

     Mailing list to allow iPSC/1 and iPSC/2 users and systems
     administrators from different installations to communicate easily and
     directly.

     Local aliases for this mailing list are to be handled by the local
     systems administrators, since most sites already have local user
     mailing lists.  What is desired to accomplish is to link all these
     iPSC user lists together.  The first thing needed is an administrator
     list and the user list will hopefully follow.  If you are a system
     administrator for Intel Hypercube(s) you are invited to send the
     following information to ipsclist@TCGOULD.TN.CORNELL.EDU:

           - systems, iPSC/1's or iPSC/2's
           - administrator's e-mail address OR alias
           - institution
           - user alias list (might want this separate from existing
                              user list, a good idea)
           - suggestions, opinions, ideas....

     PLEASE! Systems Administrators Only.

     The only real boundaries to the discussion are defined by the topics
     of other mailing lists.  Please do not send communications to both
     this list and AIList or the Prolog list, except in special cases.  The
     Moderator tries not to overlap much with NL-KR, except when both lists
     receive materials from contributors or from some bulletin board or
     researchers.

     There is no objection to distributing material that is destined for
     conference proceedings or any other publication.  The Coordinator is
     involved in SIGIR Forum and, unless submittors request otherwise, may
     include submissions in whole or in part in future paper versions of
     the FORUM.  Indeed, this is one form of solicitation for FORUM
     contributions!  Both IRList and the FORUM are unrefereed, and opinions
     are always those of the author and not of any organization unless
     there are other indications.  Copies of list items should credit the
     original author, not necessarily the IRList.

     The IRLIST Archives will be set up for anonymous FTP, and the address
     will be announced in future issues.

     To subscribe send the following command to LISTSERV@UCCVMA.BITNET:
     SUB IR-L your_full_name where "your_full_name" is your real name, not

ISO10646%JHUVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU
     ISO10646 on LISTSERV@JHUVM

     Purpose:

     To serve as a clearing house for information on and discussion of
     multi-byte coded-character-set issues.

     The ISO 10646 draft and Unicode draft standards represent two
     different approaches to encoding the world's characters into a
     multi-byte code.

     Background:

     People are looking at multi-byte codes as a way to solve many of the
     problems we are experiencing with single-byte, 7-bit and 8-bit codes.
     Although most of us do not need all 191 of the characters in the ISO
     8859-1 character set (repertoire), we frequently need characters
     outside of this set; for example, bullets or nice quotation marks for
     professional looking documents, symbols for mathematics and science,
     etc.  The reason for developing multi-byte codes is that processing
     ONE multi-byte code appears easier than several single-byte codes.

     As of March, 1990, two coding schemes have emerged.  The International
     Organization for Standardization (ISO) Subcommittee 2, Working Group 2
     (SC2/WG2) has developed the ISO 10646 Multi-Octet Code.  It is now a
     "draft proposed" standard (two levels removed from being an
     international standard).  The ISO working group has been working on
     this project for the last 6 years and it has been subject to unusually
     wide review for a proposed standard.  The other draft standard is the
     result of the work of a consortium of U.S. companies, mostly from the
     west coast.  It is called Unicode.  Both of these draft standards
     enable the worlds communication (newspapers and magazines) and
     business characters, ideographs, and symbols to be encoded for storage
     and communication between computers.  However, each uses a different
     approach to making the inevitable tradeoffs.

     Mechanics:

ISODE@NIC.DDN.MIL

     Discussion group focusing on the ISO Development Environment, an
     openly available implementation of some of the higher-level protocols
     adopted by international organizations (ISO, CCITT, ECMA).  These
     implementations are hosted on top of TCP/IP using the method discussed
     in RFC983.  Appropriate topics are:

        - Questions about how to use ISODE (and announcements of ports
          to other target environments)
        - Discussion of ISODE as a part of a TCP/IP to ISO migration
          strategy
        - Exchange of ideas regarding ISO-based applications running
          in a native TCP/IP environment
        - Debate regarding where ISODE should go next

     The list naturally has some overlap with the TCP-IP list, the ISO
     list, and so on; contributors are urged to use the appropriate list
     based on their topic of discussion.

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to ISODE-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.

     International Student Space Simulations is an exciting, dynamic
     teaching method that challenges students to design, construct, and
     live in a self-contained habitat for an extended period of time.  It
     is a multilevel, interdisciplinary, action-based program that enables
     students to apply what they have learned towards the successful
     "launch," "orbit," and "splashdown" of an extended space simulation.

     Throughout the simulation, student astronauts communicate with Mission
     Control technicians (also students) via 2-way radio, modem-equipped
     computers, and/or VCR cameras and monitors.  Inside the habitat,
     astronauts perform experiments, work on previously recorded lessons,
     engage in simulated docking maneuvers, retrieve and repair satellites,
     prepare meals.

     If you would like to join the ISSS discussion list, please send an
     e-mail message to either Chris Rowan (chris@tenet.edu) or Penny Bond
     (pennyb@tenet.edu) with your name, institution, grade level (if
     applicable) and reason why you would like to be added to the list.
     Please indicate whether you are a current ISSS member.

LATINO-L@AMHERST.EDU                                     [Last Update 4/93]

     Me llamo Gilberto y soy el co-chair de La Causa, el grupo Latino de
     Amherst College. This list's purpose is to foster communication
     between Latino students (as well as other interested people) across
     the country.

     People have used it to share information about social/academic events
     held on college campuses, scholarship and research opportunities for
     Latino / Hispanic students, and current events connected to Latinos,
     both in the United States and in Latin America.

     The intended focus is on issues of concern to Latino students, but
     anyone's input or participation is welcome.  The membership is diverse
     and includes people of many different nationalities and occupations.
     Several members have connections with other Latino organizations and
     computer networks and so this list can give its membership access to a
     wide range of quick, reliable information.

     If you are interested in becoming a subscriber to this e-mailing list,
     or if you have comments for thelist administrator, all you have to do
     is send a note to the following address:

     LATINO-L-REQUEST@AMHERST.EDU and say that you want to join.

     While you are subscribed, if you want to send a message to the entire
     membership of the list (like a piece of interesting news, a question
     you might have, an announcement that might benefit Latino students
     etc.) then write to:

Learning@sea.east.sun.com                               [Last Update 11/92]

     The Learning List:  A Resource for Helping our Children Learn

     Purpose:  The Learning List was founded on Friday, 13 November 1992,
     as an electronic forum for discussing child-centered learning. It is
     intended to provide a meeting place in cyberspace in which to advance
     our understanding of the processes of learning, and to share personal
     experiences and practical suggestions to help in the great adventure
     we share with our children.

     Philosophy:  Our philosophy is that humans as a species have an innate
     ability to learn, and that current methods of "teaching", "education"
     and "schooling" serve primarily to thwart or diminish that ability. We
     seek to learn how we can best reaffirm and enhance that ability in
     ourselves and, above all else, in our children.

     As our spiritual and religious backgrounds are varied, we affirm that
     we will agree to disagree on these issues. In particular, we will not
     attempt to convince others of the rightness of our particular ethical
     or moral stand, whether it is motivated by religion, personal belief
     or societal standards. Such discussions should be conducted elsewhere.

     We find inspiration in the writings of such people as John Holt, and
     in the ongoing dialogue in such periodicals as Growing Without
     Schooling.

     Submissions and Subscriptions:  Members of the list are considered
     subscribers of a service that is currently offered free of charge. All
     subscribers are urged to submit articles and letters, and to join in
     ongoing discussion.

     Although individual submissions will NOT be censored for content by
     the moderator, all subscribers are requested to observe the statements
     of purpose and philoshophy in their writing. Anyone who regularly
     flouts these standards will be asked to leave the List.

LN on LISTSERV@FRMOP11.Bitnet

     Bulletin Electronique LN

     Le bulletin electronique LN a pour but de favoriser la circulation
     d'informations a travers la communaute "Informatique Linguistique":
     appels a communication, annonces de conferences ou seminaires,
     requetes specifiques concernant logiciels, corpus et donnees diverses,
     descriptions d'activites et de projets, discussions sur des sujets
     techniques, etc. Le bulletin est principalement francophone, mais de
     nombreuses informations sont retransmises sous leur forme originale en
     anglais. Il constitue un forum pour les chercheurs travaillant sur le
     Francais mais n'est en aucun cas restreint a ce seul champ d'etude.

     Le bulletin est parraine par l'Association for Computational
     Linguistics (ACL) et l'Association for Computers and the Humanities
     (ACH). Ce double parrainage reflete l'interet croissant des linguistes
     informaticiens pour, a cote de domaines plus traditionnels, des
     domaines tels que la lexicographie informatique, l'etude et
     l'utilisation de corpus, les modeles statistiques, etc., qui sont
     depuis longtemps centraux dans l'ACH.

     Le bulletin comporte a l'heure actuelle pres de 400 abonnes dans 25
     pays. Il est edite par Jean Veronis (GRTC-CNRS, France) et Pierre
     Zweigenbaum (DIAM-INSERM, France).

     Vous pouvez vous abonner au bulletin en envoyant un message compose de

     LN Electronic List

     LN is an international electronic distribution list for computational
     linguists. Its goal is to disseminate calls for papers, conference and
     seminar announcements, requests for software, corpora, and various
     data, project descriptions, discussions on technical topics, etc. The
     list is primarily French-speaking, but many items are circulated in
     English. It provides a forum for scholars working on French, but it is
     by no means restricted to this field.

     The list is sponsored by the Association for Computational Linguistics
     (ACL) and the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH). This
     joint sponsorship reflects the fact that in addition to more
     traditional concerns, computational linguists have a growing interest
     in areas such as computational lexicography, study and use of corpora,
     statistical models, etc., which have been traditionally central to
     ACH.

     Currently the list consists of about 400 members in 25 countries. It
     is moderated by Jean Veronis (GRTC-CNRS, France) and Pierre
     Zweigenbaum (DIAM-INSERM, France).

     To join LN, send a message to LISTSERV@FRMOP11.BITNET, containing only
     the following line:

lojban-list@snark.thyrsus.com

     This list is for exchange of information, ideas, comments, and text
     about the artificial language Lojban (also called Loglan) - reference
     Scientific American, June 1960.  This language has been recently
     completed after 35 years work, and is spoken by a few people, and
     growing steadily.  Its original purpose was as a tool in testing the
     Sapir-Whorf hypothesis of linguistics.  Other applications, including
     language education, machine translation, artificial intelligence, an
     international language, etc. have surfaced and gained adherents.

     For information about Lojban, send a snail address to:  -- lojbab =

LymeNet-L@Lehigh.EDU                                     [Last Update 3/93]

     Lyme Disease is now the fastest growing infectious disease in the
     United States.  In 10 short years, this little known bacterial
     infection has claimed half a million victims and the number of new
     patients continues to spiral upward with no relief in sight.  It is
     estimated that in 1991, 100,000 Americans contracted this dangerous
     disease.  If left untreated, LD can cause permanent nerve,
     musculoskeletal and cardiac damage.

     Unfortunately, many in the medical and political arenas have not given
     this epidemic much thought.  Self appointed experts in the academic
     community have declared that LD can always be cured with short courses
     of simple antibiotics.  However, as the number of cases rise, doctors
     on the front lines are discovering that LD is more serious that
     previously suspected, requiring longer treatment therapies and more
     complex combinations of medicines.  The battle lines have been drawn.

     And the battles continue at LD conferences, and in the various State
     legislatures where insurance companies, terrified at the high cost of
     LD, are attempting to short change patients.  Estimates show that the
     average cost of treatment for chronic LD patients ranges from $60,000
     to $100,000 per patient.

     MAILING LIST:  To keep up with the latest developments, including new
     treatment protocols, research news and political events, we introduce
     the Lyme Disease Electronic Mail Network.  LymeNet, in association
     with the Lyme Disease Network of New Jersey, Inc., with provide you
     with a periodic newsletter with the latest information.  All you need
     is an Internet-accessible e-mail address.

     INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS INCLUDE:

           * LD patients
           * Friends or family of LD patients, who may wish to forward the
             newsletter to an LD patient
           * Interested members of the medical community
           * Interested members of the press

MACPROG@WUVMD.WUSTL.EDU                     [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     Hosted by Washington University, the MACPROG list is the Internet
     answer to the excellent Usenet programming forum.  Hopefully the
     easier access of an Internet-based list will promote even better
     communication between Macintosh developers of commercial, in-house,
     and shareware software.  In addition, this list will move some of the
     more technical topics out from lists devoted to user-oriented issues.

     I will be moderating the list remotely from Wayne State University.
     I'm not a Mac programming expert per se.  But I am one of those
     sadistic indiviuals who, convinced life alone wasn't handing me enough
     problems, decided to take up Mac programming for the sheer fun of it.
     Luckily I found a job where they'd pay me to have fun (actually I'm a
     System's Analyst but they give me in-house programming time for good
     behavior).

     The list will be moderated in a digest format (Info-mac style).  I'll
     collect submissions into one digest and crank one out every day or two
     as traffic dictates.  If the initial membership is any indication,
     this list should have heavy traffic.  30 people have subscribed
     already, with 40 more inquiries, without even having officially
     announced the list.

     The focus of MacProg will be to discuss mainstream language coding
     techniques.  What's a mainstream language?  C & Pascal principally,
     although other languages like LISP, Prologue, Fortran, Basic,
     HyperTalk, and application scripting are certainly welcome.  Besides
     Q&A, I'd like to have other features running.  For example, I'd like
     participants to report errors in documentation from Apple or other
     sources.  There's been times when I've felt like terminating execution
     of my program with a 16lb., chrome-plated sledge hammer, simply
     because of an error I was getting caused by errant specifications from
     Apple.  Also I'd like participants to offer quick reviews on books
     they've read, seminars they've attended, or interactive courses
     they've used which have been particularly good or bad.  Since no one
     can ever know everything about Mac programming, and since system
     compatibility is a constantly moving target, sources of programming
     information are important for beginners and experts alike.

     So, if you think you'd like to use this informative service for
     Macintosh developers send mail to LISTSERV@WUVMD.WUSTL.EDU or
     LISTSERV@WUVMD.BITNET with the following command in the BODY of the
     mail:  SUBSCRIBE MACPROG your name

     Special thanks to Eric Oberle of Washington University for setting
     this all up on his mainframe.  But what do you mean when you say I
     have to pay the electric bill?

mac-security@eclectic.com

     A mailing list for people interested in Macintosh security.  This can
     be used to:

        - Discuss existing security problems in various Macintosh
          applications.
        - Discuss security applications, hardware, and solutions.
        - Discuss potential problems and their solutions.
        - Announcements of new Macintosh viruses and virus control
          software.  (Discussion of viruses in depth should be carried
          out on virus specific mailing lists.)
        - Just about anything else related to Macintosh security and
          access control.

     With the arrival of System 7.0 and its wealth of information sharing
     facilities, Macintosh security has entered a new era.  Originally you
     only had to worry about someone getting into your Macintosh via the
     keyboard, or stealing it outright.  Now it's much easier to browse
     through information on someone else's Macintosh over the network.

     If you're interested in joining the list, please send a message to:

     mac-security-request@eclectic.com

     Contributions to the list should go to:

     mac-security@eclectic.com

     At present, the list is unmoderated and will immediately distribute
     any incoming messages to the list.  If conditions change, the list
     will change to a moderated list, a digest, or some other form.  Also,
     we can look into making it a newsgroup at some point but I'd like to
     start it in this form and see what develops.

     Purpose: This list is primarily a forum where people interested in
     bands representative of the "Manchester" sound can get together for
     discussion.  Examples of bands being discussed here include the Stone
     Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, the Charlatans, 808 State,
     Northside, etc.  The definition of the Manchester sound is vague at
     best: use your best judgement when trying to determine if a group
     falls under the aegis of Manchester.

     Both list and weekly digest formats are available.

     MARINE-L is an open Forum for the discussion and development of
     Marine-related Studies, and Semester-at-Sea/Education-at-Sea programs,
     including the development of e-mail connectivity at sea.  Interest
     areas include:

           Marine electronic communications/networking/maintenance;
           Coastal/Marine Database;
           Marine Parks and Coastal National Parks;
           General coastal and marine ecosystems;
           Marine zoology and biology;
           Aquaculture;
           Ocean environmental sciences;
           Ocean and atmospheric sciences;
           Marine sciences research stations and marine museums;
           Maritime academies and sail-training;
           Marine engineering and ship design, shipbuilding, and shipyard management;
           Fisheries science;
           Stellar navigation;
           Satellite oceanography;
           Blue-water sailing and ship maintenance;
           History of Sea Education;
           Traditional navigation methods around the world;
           Co-operative links between Sea-Education programs;
           Ocean racing;
           Marine/maritime publishing and publications;
           Submersible design;
           Shipping movements;
           Ocean research, funding, grants and awards;
           Oceania and maritime anthropology;
           International shipboard/port relations;

           Ocean resources management and ocean industries;
           Weather information transmission and information storage/retrieval;
           Ham and marine radio communications.

     Within this broadbased Marine Studies format, it is the direction of
     the Forum to co-develop a multi-campus international program and to
     charter/purchase a large oceangoing vessel (tall-ship) to sail the
     Oceans, offering academics, researchers and students a diverse program
     of ongoing Marine Studies, together with the opportunity to visit
     international ports, attend foreign campus programs, both in
     conjunction with brief visits to ports, and full-credit courses during
     prolonged visits/full semester programs etc.

     Further, through the Marine-L format, we will discuss the needs for
     shipboard LAN communications, plus ship-to-MARINE-L e-mail
     connectivity, general ship-to-mainland and international
     communications services, and the development of video telecourses for
     presentation via satellite, around the planet.  It is hoped that broad
     cooperation will enable this program to be able to offer a truly
     international selection of credit courses for a wide group of
     campuses, academics, researchers and students.

     To join in the Marine Studies List send an E-mail message to:

     LISTSERV@UOGUELPH.CA (or LISTSERV@UOGUELPH.BITNET)

MEDSTU-L on LISTSERV@UNMVM

     The University of New Mexico is pleased to announce that effective
     immediately, we are hosting a new Listserv discussion list for medical
     students worldwide.  The name of the new list is MEDSTU-L and
     initially, the list will be unmoderated with subscriptions open.  Due
     to a present limitation on disk storage, notebooks will be kept for a
     period of 30 days.

     The impetus for this list was mail I sent out several weeks ago
     soliciting medical students with e-mail accounts to exchange mail with
     medical students here.  As a result of that solicitation, I found that
     while there are many medical students with e-mail accounts, most of
     them are unaware of others with e-mail accounts.  Thus, this list.
     While it is an open list and therefore there is no way of verifying
     the subscription request, the two list owners respectfully request
     that the list be limited to students in medical schools.

     To subscribe to the list send e-mail to LISTSERV@UNMVM and in the body
     of the message say SUB MEDSTU-L your_first_name your_last_name

     If you have any questions, please let us know.

     An unmoderated list concerning the history, culture, politics and

     their possible union or disunion, and their place in a united Europe.
     Cross-posting with lists concerning West Europe/ Germany and the USSR

     are not ruled out.

     ModBrits, is the international computer discussion group for scholars,
     teachers, and students of Modern British and Irish literature
     (1895-1955) and those who share their interests.

     ModBrits offers a medium for announcements and bulletins, notes and
     queries, scholarly papers.  But ModBrits also offers spontaneous and
     informal conversation on its subject(s).

     Members can submit formal newsletters and announcements, calls for
     papers, employment announcements, and notices of work in progress and
     of public events for electronic distribution.  They can also send
     short reviews of scholarly books, remarks about videotape and film
     resources, abstracts of news reports, and even draft articles for
     comment by other members.  Reports from Britain and Ireland about
     developments related to the subject matter of ModBrits are welcome.
     Queries and notes about fine or grand points are expected to generate
     some of the conversation on ModBrits.

     Lengthier electronic texts such as conference papers, articles, or
     theses submitted by ModBrits members may be made available for on-line
     retrieval on an individual basis.  Quite possibly, computerized
     (electronic) texts of works by Conrad, Joyce, Lawrence, Woolf, and
     others will also be archived.  Other forms of electronic information
     may also become available, such as concordances, sample journals,
     publishers' catalogues, and bibliographical resources.  An e-mail
     directory of ModBritians will be accessible to all members, to
     facilitate the electronic distribution of seminar papers prior to a
     conference (for example) and to encourage private correspondence and
     collaboration.

     E-mail inquiries about the discussion group should be sent directly to
     ModBrits@KentVM.Kent.Edu.  (The appended `.Kent.Edu' is necessary only

     "undocumented features", and other user concerns with ModelShop.  I
     (listowner) frequently call MM-P's customer support line with bug
     reports and questions, and they have expressed some interest in
     monitoring and possibly contributing to this list in the future.

     The list was created in January 1992.

     LISTSERV@IRISHVMA via mail or interactive message:

     SUB MODLSHOP your_full_name

     A new discussion list, MOPOLY-L has been established at UMCVMB for the
     topic of Missouri Political Issues.

     The discussion on this list will be pretty much up to those who
     participate.  Topics I can think of include any Missouri state-wide
     issue, whether candidates for office or other issues.  With the
     current revenue shortage and it's effect on education, that may well
     be a popular topic.

     Also, there may be some local issues that have wide interest, again,
     it's up to the participants.

     This is a LISTSERV managed list, so normal subscription requests
     apply.  To subscribe send mail to LISTSERV@UMCVMB.BITNET or on the

Multicast@Arizona.EDU                                   [Last Update 9/92]

     The multicast mailing list has been set up for discussion of multicast
     and broadcast issues in an OSI network environment.  In the current
     CCITT recommendations and ISO standards, there is little or no mention
     of multicast capability.  However, there is work in this area in other
     environments.

     The goal of this mailing list is to facilitate discussion on the
     following topics:

     - what can we learn from existing multicast and broadcast work in
     other environments (local area networks, TCP/IP Internets, XTP, ST-II,
     etc.)

     - what can we do to facilitate quality international standards (ISO
     and CCITT, especially) for multicast data transmission

     To subscribe to the multicast mailing list, send a message to
     Multicast-Request@Arizona.EDU with your full name and preferred
     electronic mail address.  Archives of the list and a database of
     contributed documents are also available on Arizona.EDU.

MUSEUM-L on LISTSERV@UNMVM.BITNET            [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     Museum-L is a general interest dicussion list for museum professionals
     and others interested in museum related issues.

     It is hoped that an open discussion by those who work in exhibits,
     education, collection, or curatorial positions can foster an
     understanding among those who work in museums.  It is also hoped that
     the discussion can share ideas and information regarding new methods
     of interpreting information for visitors, both high tech and low tech.

     To subscribe, send a one line message to LISTSERV@UNMVM.BITNET:

     subscribe MUSEUM-L Your_Full_Name

     If I can be of further assistance, please feel free to contact me.

music-research%prg.oxford.ac.uk@NSS.CS.UCL.AC.UK

     The Music-Research electronic mail redistribution list was established
     after a suggestion made at a meeting in Oxford in July 1986, to
     provide an effective and fast means of bringing together
     musicologists, music analysts, computer scientists, and others working
     on applications of computers in music research.  Initially, the list
     was established for people whose chief interests concern computers and
     their applications to

           - music representation systems
           - information retrieval systems for musical scores
           - music printing
           - music analysis
           - musicology and ethnomusicology
           - tertiary music education
           - databases of musical information

     The following areas are NOT the principal concern of this list,
     although overlapping subjects may well be interesting:

           - primary and secondary education
           - sound generation techniques
           - composition

     This group is gatewayed to the USENET group "comp.music", but postings
     to comp.music are not included in the digest.

     On-line archives are not yet available, but copies will be mailed on
     request by Brad Rubenstein <bradr@INGRES.BERKELEY.EDU>.

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to
     music-research-request%prg.oxford.ac.uk@NSS.CS.UCL.AC.UK or UUCP

NA-NET <na.join@na-net.ornl.gov>                         [Last Update 4/93]

     This mail facility was created to allow numerical analysts (na) an
     easy method of communicating with one another.  The main advantage of
     the NA-NET is uniformity of addressing.  All mail is addressed to the
     Internet host "na-net.ornl.gov" at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
     Hence, members of the NA-NET do not need to remember complicated
     addresses or even where a member is currently located.  As long as
     moving members change their e-mail address in the NA-NET (see feature
     5 below) everything works smoothly.

     The NA-NET is running on the same machine that serves netlib@ornl.gov.
     Netlib is a separate facility that distributes mathematical software
     via electronic mail.  For more information on netlib send the one-line
     message "send index" to netlib@ornl.gov

     NA-NET includes features, such as auto-joining and auto-address
     changes.  We have also added a whitepages directory service to the
     NA-NET.  It allows users to find out more information about other
     members.

     The NA-NET originated at Stanford University by Gene Golub.  Much of
     the software we've used up to now was written by Mark Kent.  The Oak
     Ridge NA-NET operation will be under the direction of Jack Dongarra.
     Bill Rosener of the University of Tennessee has rewritten the
     software.  Cleve Moler will continue to edit the NA-NET News Digest.

     NA-NET News Digest

     Any mail sent to "na.digest@na-net.ornl.gov" will be considered for
     distribution to all members of the NA-NET.  About once a week the
     Editor of the NA-NET News Digest will go over the messages which have
     queued up, pick out the ones that are thought to be of general
     interest to the numerical analysis and mathematical software
     community, combine them in a News Digest format, and mail the Digest
     to everyone on the mailing list.

     Joining the NA-NET

     To join the NA-NET send mail to "na.join@na-net.ornl.gov".  In the
     message body specify the following three fields.

            Lastname:
            Firstname:
            E-mail:

     The values can be specified in any order.  The subject line of your
     message is ignored.  If there is a member of NA-NET with the same
     lastname, then a message will be sent back to you.  If this happens
     try prepending your first initial to your last name.  In this case the
     "key" which identifies you will not be your lastname.  See Appendix A
     for an example on how to join the na-net.

     Removing membership

     To remove your membership from the NA-NET send mail to
     "na.remove@na-net.ornl.gov".  In the message body specify the
     following two fields.

            Lastname:
            Firstname:

     The values can be specified in any order.  Again the subject line of
     your message is ignored.  A message will be sent to both the deleted
     address and the address making the request informing you that your
     name has been removed.

NAC@VM1.NODAK.EDU
     NAC@NDSUVM1.BITNET

     The "NAC" list is a BITNET/NetNorth/EARN Redistribution list for
     Usenet Newsgroup news.announce.conferences.
     "news.announce.conferences" is used to post calls for papers and
     conference announcements.  Contributions should be submitted to
     mcmi!news-announce-conferences@uunet.uu.net,
     news-announce-conferences@mcmi.uucp, NAC@VM1.NODAK.EDU.,or
     NAC@NDSUVM1.BITNET (the list is MODERATED.  Submissions to NAC@NDSUVM1
     (NAC@VM1.NODAK.EDU) will be forwarded to the Moderator).

     Contributions sent to the list are automatically archived.  You can
     obtain a list of the available archive files by sending an "INDEX NAC"
     command to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 or LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU.  These files
     can then be retrieved by means of a "GET NAC filetype" command, or
     using the database search facilities of LISTSERV.  Send an "INFO
     DATABASE" command for more information on the latter.  The command may
     be in the BODY or TEXT of the mail, NOT the subject, or may be sent
     interactively via TELL or SEND on BitNet/EARN/NetNorth.

     You may also obtain copies of the list notebooks via anonymous FTP to
     VM1.NODAK.EDU (192.33.18.30), userid ANONYMOUS, any password.  Once
     validated do a CD LISTARCH and DIR NAC.* to see the notebooks
     available.  The file system is NOT hierarchical so you must do a CD
     ANONYMOUS if you want to return to the "root".

     You may subscribe to NAC by sending the command:  SUB NAC
     Your_full_name (eg. SUB NAC Jane Doe) to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 or
     LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU.

NetMonth

     NetMonth is a network service publication distributed free of charge
     to students and professionals in BITNET and other networks.  This
     magazine and it's companion file, BITNET SERVERS, are the work of the
     Yale Computer Center BITNET Services Library (BITLIB) staff.  The
     BITLIB is a local online help facility designed to inform Yale network
     users about what services are available to them through BITNET, and
     provide instructions and utilities for their proper use.  In
     publishing NetMonth the BITLIB staff members hope to share the fruits
     of their labor with institutions outside of Yale in order to promote a
     productive and enjoyable networking environment for everyone.  The
     BITLIB system is now distributed to more than thirty educational
     institutions worldwide.

     BITNET SERVERS is BITNET's most complete and up-to-date list of
     servers and services.  It is sent to NetMonth subscribers at the same
     time as the magazine.

     Subscribing to NetMonth and BITNET SERVERS:

     VM users in BITNET may add themselves to the mailing list with this
     command:  TELL LISTSERV AT MARIST SUBSCRIBE NETMONTH Your_full_name
     VAX/VMS users in BITNET can subscribe in a similar way:  SEND
     LISTSERV@MARIST SUBSCRIBE NETMONTH Your_full_name If you cannot send
     messages in this way, you can send the following command as the first
     line of a mail file to LISTSERV@MARIST:  SUBSCRIBE NETMONTH
     Your_full_name

     Internet users may use this method, but must address the mail to:
     LISTSERV%MARIST.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

     A subscriber can delete him/herself from the mailing list by sending
     LISTSERV@MARIST the command UNSUBSCRIBE NETMONTH.

     Electronic Forum On Networking Emergency Management

     The California Office of Emergency Services invites practitioners and
     students of emergency management to take part in a new electronic-
     mail forum (which we hope will be a worthy complement to "ADMIN".)

     "Networks In Emergency Management" is a moderated forum on the uses of
     networks and networked computers in the practice of emergency

NETSCOUT%VMTECMEX.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

     A forum for the general user of the BitNet and/or the Internet to
     discuss and exchange information about Servers, FTP sites, Filelists,
     lists, tools and any related aspects:

     Are you trying to find that WIZMO EXEC on a forgotten Listserv? Where
     were those great utilities to transfer files from PC to Mac? Do you
     want to know the latest FTP directories? Where is the NutWorks list?

     This is the place to ask.

     To subscribe to the list send the following command in the text/body
     of mail to LISTSERV@VMTECMEX (BitNet) or

NEWEDU-L on LISTSERV@USCVM.BITNET            [Last Updated 12-October-1991]
     or LISTSERV@VM.USC.EDU

     This list is dedicated to experimenting with and exploring the way we
     educate.  We ask: what are the new paradigms in education and how can
     they be implemented.

     For instance:

        - How is technology changing the way we view education?
        - What effects will cooperative/collaborative strategies have
          on teaching and learning?
        - Does the so-called "information age" change the way we view
          our responsibilities as educators?
        - Artificial intelligence research is changing our view of how
          we know things.  How does this affect education?
        - How can we reduce dependency in education and foster
          independent learning?

     There are many individuals working in these areas, each with a
     conviction that education will change.  This list attempts to bring
     together every teacher, student, researcher, librarian, multimedia
     expert and information specialist interested in educational change --
     Kindergarten through post-graduate.

     You are encouraged to:

        - Submit summaries of or commentary on published articles and
          books which explore the frontiers of teaching and learning.
        - Submit in-progress papers or abstracts of those papers for
          comment.
        - Share the results of your experiments with teaching and
          learning.
        - Ask thought-provoking questions about the future of
          education and the environments in which it takes place.
        - Recruit interested parties to this listserv, regardless of
          their status in education, industry or government.

     Subscribing to NEWEDU-L:

     IBM VM users in BITNET may add themselves to the mailing list with
     this command:  TELL LISTSERV AT USCVM SUBSCRIBE NEWEDU-L
     Your_full_name

     VAX/VMS users in BITNET can subscribe in a similar way:  SEND
     LISTSERV@USCVM SUBSCRIBE NEWEDU-L Your_full_name

     If you cannot send messages in this way, you can send the following
     command as the first line of text in a mail item to LISTSERV@USCVM:
     SUBSCRIBE NEWEDU-L Your_full_name

     Internet users may use this method, but must address the mail to:
     LISTSERV@vm.usc.edu

     A subscriber can delete him/herself from the mailing list by sending
     LISTSERV@USCVM (or listserv@vm.usc.edu) the command:  SIGNOFF NEWEDU-L

NEW-LIST@VM1.NODAK.EDU
     NEW-LIST@NDSUVM1.BITNET

     The "NEW-LIST" list has been established as a central address to post
     announcements of new public mailing lists.  In addition, "NEW-LIST"
     might be used as a final verification before establishing a list (to
     check for existing lists on the same topic, etc.).  However, be sure
     to check sources such as the Internet List-of-Lists (SIGLIST or
     INTEREST-GROUPS list), LISTSERV GROUPS, Usenet News newusers lists,
     and the LISTS database on the major LISTSERVs (we have the LISTS
     database on NDSUVM1).

     It is not our intent to replace the various lists of lists that are
     available.  We want to provide a clearinghouse to feed list
     announcements to all those maintaining the lists and others who are
     interested.

     You may subscribe to the NEW-LIST list by sending RFC822 Mail to
     LISTSERV@VM1.NoDak.EDU on Internet or LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 on BitNet.  In
     the BODY (text) of your mail include the command:  SUB NEW-LIST
     firstname lastname eg.  sub new-list Jane Doe The LISTSERV server will
     take your address from the "From:" address of your mail.  If you are
     on BITNET/EARN/NetNorth and can send interactive messages (eg.  TELL
     on CMS or SEND on VMS with JNET) then you can send the SUB command as
     shown to LISTSERV at NDSUVM1 interactively.

     If you prefer, you may send mail to the Coordinator to be asked to be
     added to the list.  However you subscribe, you should receive return
     mail with a confirmation and additional information.

NeWS-makers@BRILLIG.UMD.EDU
     ...!mimsy!NeWS-makers (uucp)

     Mailing list for the discussion of NeWS: the Network/extensible Window
     System.  NeWS, originally called SunDew, was written primarily by
     James Gosling, at Sun Microsystems, who is well known for his Unix
     Emacs.  NeWS is an extensible multitasking window system environment,
     consisting of a network based display server that is controlled and
     programmed in PostScript, Adobe's page description language.  NeWS was
     designed to be a portable, device independent window system
     development platform that runs on a wide range of hardware, in a
     distributed heterogeneous environment.

     The archives are available via anonymous FTP from BRILLIG.UMD.EDU, in
     the file "news-makers.archive".

next-managers@stolaf.edu                     [Last Updated 28-January-1992]

     This list is intended to be a quick-turnaround trouble shooting aid
     for those who administer and manage NeXT systems.  Its primary purpose
     is to provide the NeXT manager with a quick source of information for
     system management problems that are of a time-critical nature.  Its
     secondary purpose is to disseminate time-critical or security- related
     information.

     To be added to the list send mail to the owner (below).

     Owner:  next-managers-request@stolaf.edu

     NEXT-MANAGERS POLICY

     This is a summary of the next-managers charter and rules.  Failure to
     adhere to these guidelines may result in severe chastisement by the
     list maintainer and other list participants or your being removed from
     the next-managers mailing list.

     1:  This list is NOT moderated!  Every message that is sent to the
     list next-managers@stolaf.edu will be passed on to every member of the
     list

     2:  Requests to have addresses added or removed from the list should
     NOT be sent to the entire list.  Instead, they should be mailed to:
     next-managers-request@stolaf.edu

     3:  This list is intended to be a quick-turnaround trouble shooting
     aid for those who administer and manage NeXT systems.  Its primary
     purpose is to provide the NeXT manager with a quick source of
     information for system management problems that are of a time-critical
     nature.  Its secondary purpose is to disseminate time-critical or
     security- related information.

     4:  Answers to questions are to be mailed back to the questioner and
     are NOT to be sent to the entire list.  The person who originally
     asked the question has the responsibility of summarizing the answers
     and sending the entire summary back to the list.  If everyone follows
     this, one problem will only generate two or possibly three messages on
     the list.  The summary message should contain the keyword "SUMMARY" in
     the subject line.

     5:  Corrections to compiled answers should be addressed only to the
     person who first asked the question; this person (the writer of the
     original question) is then responsible for distributing the corrected
     information to the list.

     6:  Discussions on ANY topic are very strongly discouraged.

     7:  If it is not specifically related to NeXT system management, then
     it does NOT belong on this list.

     8:  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE...Think before you send a message!  Ask
     yourself is this really appropriate?  have you checked in the
     reference manuals?  have you checked NextAnswers?  have you checked
     the Digital Librarian?  have you checked in the online man pages?
     have you checked the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list?  have you
     checked the next-managers archive?  before mailing to the
     next-managers list. There are enough other newsgroups, mailing lists
     and other resources around to cover the marginal topics.

     9:  Do NOT send message from "root" or from "me"; send them from your
     own personal account.

     10: Do not send messages with NeXT attachments; please use
     straight-text only.

     11: next-managers is currently archived on "ftp.stolaf.edu" in
     ~ftp/pub/next-managers.

nis@cerf.net                                            [Last Update 11/92]

     Network Information Services Announcements List

     CERFnet has established a mailing list to serve network information
     service providers and end users.  In a nutshell, the nis@cerf.net list
     will be a group effort (in true Internet style) to concentrate network
     information services (nis) announcements onto one list for everyone's
     use.  A few dozen individuals around the Internet will each be
     monitoring a specific source (mailing list, news group, list serve)
     and sending the information to CERFnet.  We will serve as the
     moderator, forwarding pertinent submissions to the entire readership
     of the list, omitting duplicates.

     In this way, individuals can receive regular nis information even if
     they choose not to read discussion lists.  This should prove
     especially valuable for end users in specific disciplines who are not
     in the networking business, but are using the network as tool and a
     resource.

     Advantages:

           * everyone doesn't have to read every mailing list to stay current
           * volume will stay low (it won't be a discussion list)
           * pointers will be provided for more info and discussion

     What you can do:

     * To subscribe: send mail to listserv@cerf.net with the following
     command in the body of message:  subscribe <your mailing address> nis
     (Note the difference in format from other LISTSERV servers)

     * to volunteer to monitor a source: send mail to nis@cerf.net

     * to submit an item of interest for the list to the moderator,
     comments, suggestions, helpful hints, etc.  send mail to nis@cerf.net

nl-kr@cs.rpi.edu

     NL-KR is open to discussion of any topic related to the natural
     language (both understanding and generation) and knowledge
     representation, both as subfields of AI.  The Moderator's interests
     are primarily in:

           Knowledge Representation    Natural Language Understanding
           Discourse Understanding     Philosophy of Language
           Plan Recognition            Computational Linguistics

     Contributions are also welcome on topics such as:

           Cognitive Psychology (as related to NL/KR)
           Human Perception (same)
           Linguistics
           Machine Translation
           Computer and Information Science (as may be used to implement various
           Logic Programming (same)                                   NL systems)

     Contributions may be anything from tutorials to speculation. In
     particular, the following are sought:

           Puzzles and Unsolved Problems         Anecdotes, Jokes, and Poems
           Abstracts                             Reviews
           Lab Descriptions                      Research Overviews
           Work Planned or in Progress           Half-Baked Ideas
           Conference Announcements              Conference Reports
           Bibliographies                        History of NL/KR
           Queries and Requests                  Address Changes (Bindings)

     This list is in some sense a spin-off of the AIList, and as such, a
     certain amount of overlap is expected.  The primary concentration of
     this list should be NL and KR, that is, natural language (be it
     understanding, generation, recognition, parsing, semantics,
     pragmatics, etc.) and how we should represent knowledge (aquisition,
     access, completeness, etc. are all valid issues).  Topics deemed to be
     outside the general scope of this list will be forwarded to AIList (or
     other more appropriate list) or rejected.  Readers are warned not to
     submit any information that is export-controlled or classified.

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to NL-KR-REQUEST@cs.rpi.edu.

NODEINFO on LISTSERV@CUNYVM.BITNET                       [Last Update 4/93]
     or LISTSERV@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

     The NODEINFO list has been established so that interested parties may
     receive and exchange information regarding problems and/or questions
     about nodes, particularly mail delivery problems.  This list is not
     restricted to BITNet (CREN) nodes only, and is intended to cover all
     of the various networks.

     The audience of the NODEINFO list is expected to include people from
     many backgrounds - from node administrators and postmasters to list
     owners (LISTSERV or otherwise) - and anyone else interested in
     appropriate NODEINFO issues.  As such, people need no longer subscribe
     to other lists to discuss a topic which only sometimes appears, and so
     they not only now have a list that is more on topic, but they also
     have one place to receive such information from, which eliminates the
     "sifting" through postings that some people must now do with the other
     lists.

     Issues of a technical nature (other than those contained in an
     explanation of a problem) are probably best discussed on the various
     lists that exist for the specific software involved.

NORTHSTAR-USERS@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

     Discussion group for Northstar microcomputer users.

     Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail
     files named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one
     into another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve
     disk space, all the mail files in the archive, except for the current
     year, are individually compressed.  The compressed files have the
     suffix -Z as part of the filetype field; they should be renamed to
     have the suffix .Z (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so
     the uncompress program will find them.  The current month's mail is
     still kept in NORTHSTAR-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in
     directory:  PD2:<ARCHIVES.NORTHSTAR> Archive files are available via

OBJ-REL on LISTSERV@EMUVM1.CC.EMORY.EDU                  [Last Update 1/93]
     or LISTSERV@EMUVM1.BITNET

     Once one leaves the college dorm, those late night discussions about
     religion and the nature of the universe are rather difficult to come
     by.  Many people settle on a set of beliefs and do not wish have any
     further discussions, but some of us hunger for more information and
     discussion.

     OBJ-REL is intended to fill this need.  Discussion on OBJ-REL is
     intended to be centered around such topics as:

                   Existence of God or gods
                   Creationism versus Evolution
                   Reasons for the Existence of Religions
                   Epistimology
                   Religion and Government
                   Religious Behavioral Norms
                   Effects of Religion on Society
                   Any Discussion related to Religion that offers to
                       to Broaden our Scope of Understanding

     This discussion is NOT intended to be forum for emotional appeals to
     convert others to your "faith", but discussions about the content of
     your beliefs AND THE REASONS FOR THOSE BELIEFS are encouraged.  In
     short OBJ-REL is intended to be a Scientific discussion of Religion
     and Religious beliefs for the layman.

     To join OBJ-REL, send a note to LISTSERV@EMUVM1 or
     LISTSERV@emuvm1.cc.emory.edu

     The note should contain the single line:

     SUBSCRIBE OBJ-REL your name

     where "your name" is your name as you wish it to be displayed on
     messages sent to you.

     If you need assistance or would like further information, please

     This is a discussion group about MAINFRAME Computer Operations for
     computer operators, lead operators and supervisors, etc.  Some of the
     possible topics (but not limited to):

        - Operator Training (or lack of - as is too often the case in
          some installations).
        - Tips on operating the various computer systems and I/O gear.
          Those helps and hints that could be shared by veteran
          operators to aid new operators in their learning process.
          Those hints that are not in the documentation to make an
          operators job a little easier!
        - Software packages available to help day to day computer
          operations such as job scheduling, disk and tape management
          etc.
        - Problems caused by working night shift, weekends and
          holidays.
        - Education and career advancement issues.
        - Overcoming boredom - many operators get locked in to the
          same old same old day after day.
        - War stories about hardware and software problems.  What
          products to avoid under certain conditions.
        - Health concerns - Eye strain and related VDT concerns.
          Carpel tunnel problems.
        - Pros and cons on shift rotation vs. permanent shifts.
        - An 'I told you so' column - how many times does management
          say how to operations staff is going to do something and the
          operators try to give their input (which is rarely heard!).
        - Humor - Funny stories about those instances where you just
          gotta laugh.  You got to have a sense of humor to be in our
          line of work!

Pol-Econ@SHSU.BITNET

     Pol-Econ is a list to provide an unmoderated environment where issues,
     questions, comments, ideas, and uses of Political Economy as a logical
     framework can be discussed.  In a broad sense, this includes virtually
     anything dealing with economics.

     The explicit purpose of Pol-Econ is to provide timely interchange
     between subscribers, to provide a forum where interesting questions
     can be addressed within the context of interactive exchange between
     many individuals, to discuss the evolution and application of
     Political Economy, to announce professional meetings, calls for
     papers, etc., and to provide partial tables of contents for current
     periodicals.  As is the case on all unmoderated lists, the discussion
     and topics are only limited by the participation and interest of its
     subscribers.  Subscribers are welcome to take an active role by
     posting to Pol-Econ or an inactive role by monitoring the list.
     Although not necessary for participation, it shall be assumed that
     subscribers are basically familiar with technical economic jargon.

     To subscribe to Pol-Econ, please send a MAIL message to:
     LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET

     The body of this MAIL message should be one line and contain the
     words:  SUBSCRIBE Pol-Econ

     LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET is not supported by the conventional interactive
     VM-based LISTSERV, but is instead entirely MAIL oriented.

POLI-SCI@RUTGERS.EDU

     POLI-SCI is a spinoff from the HUMAN-NETS discussion list.  Shortly
     after the November 1980 election, HUMAN-NETS began to discuss the
     impact that electronic communications had on the election.  As this
     discussion continued, it lost its narrow focus on electronic
     communications and began to consider the election in general, how
     elections are won and lost, and the nature of the electoral college.
     The growth of these discussions, and their spawning of related
     discussions, indicated that a separate discussion list was merited and
     POLI-SCI was installed.  Since then POLI-SCI has begun to consider
     other topics including the history of the Carter and Nixon
     presidencies, the Iranian hostage crisis, etc. (with a little less
     dignity, the list might be characterized as a permanent distributed
     political bull session).

     Archived digest messages are stored on RUTGERS in:  <poli-sci>mail.txt
     and other files in the <poli-sci> directory

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to POLI-SCI-REQUEST@RUTGERS.EDU.

POPULATION-BIOLOGY <biosci%NET.BIO.NET@VM1.NODAK.EDU>

     Population Biology is a synthesis of population ecology and population
     genetics, pursuing a unified theory to explain the structure,
     functioning and evolution of populations of living beings.  Such
     populations are very complex systems, exhibiting a variety of
     phenomena that we stil do not master.  Just to quote a famous example,
     multiannual density cycles (e.g.  in lemmings) have not received a
     satisfactory expalnation, despite of decades of debated studies and
     speculations.  Population Biology is a very active field, encompassing
     such diverse approaches as tenacious, harsh field work to track long
     term demographic and genetic fluctuations, or sophisticated
     conversations with a computer about strange attractors possibly
     causing chaos in the density fluctuations.

     Topics that can be discussed include: ecology, population genetics,
     systematics, evolution, morphometry, interspecific competition,
     sociobiology, mathematical modelling, population regulation, pest
     control, speciation, chromosomal evolution, social behaviour,
     statistical methodology in population study, population management of
     endangered species, applications of molecular biology techniques,
     etc., and, last but not least, your own topic.  There is no
     restriction on the species:  viruses, protokaryotes, plants, animals
     (including man), mythic or extinct species, computer- simulated
     species...  Technical problems, book reviews, meeting annoucements and
     so on are also welcome.

     The BITNET and USENET names of the new group are:

     announce:

     Precalc/Development Math Curriculum Teaching Methods, Research

     The Precalc/Developmental Math list was created to establish
     communications among faculty involved with problems inherent in the
     teaching of precalculus/developmental mathematics students.  An
     incomplete list of these problems might include the placement of
     students, curriculum choices, and modes of teaching/delivery.

     The intent of the list is to encourage the sharing of curriculum,
     teaching strategies, materials, and research in this area.  In
     addition it is hoped it will generate cooperative scholarly activity
     in the teaching of precalculus/developmental mathematics among the
     users of the PRECALC Listserv.

     The list is public and you are invited to receive and contribute to
     the contents of the list.  Relevant topics for discussion include

PSRT-L on LISTSERV@UMCVMB

     PSRT-L@UMCVMB is a moderated discussion list on Bitnet which deals
     with issues of interest to professional political scientists, both
     researchers and teachers.  Submissions from all sub-fields of
     political science as well as related disciplines are encouraged.

     The list is not intended to serve as a public forum for debate over
     current issues in politics, as other lists already fill that niche.
     Rather it is intended to provide an opportunity for political
     scientists to present their ideas and ongoing research for discussion,
     to consider the directions in which the discipline is advancing, and
     to encourage the dissemination of new concepts in research and
     teaching.  In addition to ongoing discussions, the list editors would
     like to post announcements of job openings and upcoming conferences.

     To subscribe to PSRT-L send mail to LISTSERV@UMCVMB on BITNET with the
     TEXT or BODY of the mail containing the one line:

PSYCGRAD@ACADVM1.UOTTAWA.CA                  [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     Psychology Graduate Students Discussion Group List

     Now graduate students of psychology can communicate among each other
     efficiently and free of charge because, there is a list on the
     Listserv called PSYCGRAD (Psychology Graduate Students Discussion
     Group List).  Its main purpose is to provide a medium through which
     graduate students in the field of psychology can communicate.

     If you are a student studying in a graduate-level psychology program,
     you are invited to join this list.  It is asked that conversation
     topics be relevant to being a graduate student in psychology.  As you
     probably can see, this is a very open category and not too rigorously
     defined.  Virtually, anything goes except junk-mail advertisements.
     The list will not be moderated and subscriptions are open.  (Junk mail
     has been a terrible problem for many users in the past).
     Corporations, businesses, agencies, publishers, etc.  are not invited
     to the list.

     There are a few ways to subscribe to this list.

     1. If your system is part of Bitnet and a VM system, you may do this
     by using the interactive command by typing at the R; (prompt)- TELL
     LISTSERV AT UOTTAWA SUB PSYCGRAD Yourfirstname Yourlastname (Don't
     forget to capitalize and lower case Yourfirstname and Yourlastname).

     2. If your system is part of Bitnet and a VAX system, you may do this
     by using the interactive command by typing this comand.  SEND
     LISTSERV@ACADVM1.UOTTAWA.CA SUB PSYCGRAD Yourfirstname Yourlastname
     (Don't forget to capitalize and lower case Yourfirstname and
     Yourlastname).

     3. Or, you may mail one single solitary command to Listserv by mailing
     to LISTSERV AT UOTTAWA, and then make your only line read as
     follows...  SUB PSYCGRAD Yourfirstname Yourlastname.

     4. If your system is part of Internet you may mail the same command,
     as outlined in #3, to LISTSERV@ACADVM1.UOTTAWA.CA

PURTOPOI on LISTSERV@PURCCVM

     Purdue Rhetoric, Professional Writing, and Language Discussion Group

     The PURTOPOI list is a scholarly forum for the discussion of current
     issues or "topoi" in the fields of rhetoric and composition,
     professional writing, and language research.  While the list began as
     a list for Purdue only, it became so popular that it has been opened
     up for general subscriptions.

     Previous topics taken up by the group have included:

        - the relationship between social construction and
          ethnographic research in composition.
        - the disciplinary relationships between rhetoric, literary
          criticism, and linguistics.
        - the debate between agonistic and rogerian approaches to
          composition.
        - the impact of cultural studies on composition pedagogy and
          research.
        - and the antagonism between post-structuralist and
          cognitivist approaches to historical, theoretical, and
          empirical research methods.

     Members are encouraged to submit works in progress, reviews of recent
     publications, reports or announcements of conferences, bibliographies,
     or questions for group discussion.

     Subscription to the list is by listowners.  Messages sent to the list
     are archived and may be retrieved by list members.  Also, a filelist
     containing help files, bibliographies, and papers of interest is
     available to list members.

Q-METHOD on LISTSERV@KENTVM.BITNET                [Last Updated March 1992]
     or LISTSERV@KENTVM.KENT.EDU

     Q-Method is an unmoderated list for the discussion of all aspects of Q
     methodology as innovated and developed by the late William Stephenson
     (1902-1989).  Q methodology is a broad approach to the study of
     subjectivity, and includes issues of theory, conceptualization,
     measurement, and analysis.  Topics for discussion may therefore range
     from the Q-sort technique to Q factor analysis to broader concerns
     about the nature of subjectivity.  Q methodology has been applied in
     psychology, communication, political science, advertising, education,
     law, health and medicine, and many others fields.  Discussion may
     therefore be expected to be diverse with respect to illustration while
     unified with respect to methodological principles.  (Q-Method began
     March 1, 1992 and succeeds QTemp@KentVM, which was established as a
     temporary list on January 14, 1991.)

     Archives of Q-Method back issues (including those previously stored
     under QTemp) can be listed by sending the command INDEX Q-METHOD to
     LISTSERV@KENTVM or LISTSERV@KENTVM.KENT.EDU in the BODY of e-mail.

     To subscribe, send the following command to LISTSERV@KENTVM or
     LISTSERV@KENTVM.KENT.EDU in the BODY of mail or in an interactive
     message:

     SUB Q-METHOD your full name

     where "your full name" is your name.  For example:

QMList on listserver@tbone.biol.scarolina.edu            [Last Update 4/93]

     This is an open, unmoderated mailing list to support researchers and
     clinicians in the field of quantitative morphology.  This can include
     (but is not limited to): queries for help with technical or
     professional problems; pointers to interesting recent publications;
     summaries and abstracts of your own recent work; news of upcoming
     meetings; news about job openings or other professional opportunities;
     and news about granting agencies or programs.

     We would like to encourage a broad interpretation of "quantitative
     morphology".  We encourage interaction between people working in two-
     or three-dimensional quantitative analysis of both organic and
     inorganic structures.  Relevant methods include, but are not limited
     to: serial reconstruction, stereology, geometric modeling, computer
     graphics, geometric probability, mathematical morphology, pattern
     analysis, etc.  We encourage people from (at least) the following
     fields to participate:  anatomy, biophysics, botany, cell biology,
     computer vision, forestry, geology, materials sciences, microbiology,
     pathology, radiology, and zoology.

QUALITY on LISTSERV@PUCC.PRINCETON.EDU                   [Last Update 4/93]
     or QUALITY@PUCC (Bitnet)

     Total Quality Management (TQM) in Manufacturing & Service Industries

     A. QUALITY@PUCC.PRINCETON.EDU is the electronic communications network
     for discussing TQM in the manufacturing and service industries. TQM
     refers to an organization-wide effort to achieve quality. It can be
     described as a philosophy that is intended to involve everyone in the
     organization in a quest for quality, with customer satisfaction as the
     driving force.

     The topics for discussion on QUALITY are grouped into three areas:  1.
     Quality Systems: quality control; quality assurance; statistical
     process control; employee involvement; JIT; & others.  2. Quality
     Standards: ISO 9000 (European & International); Baldrige (USA); Deming
     (Japanese); and JIS (Japanese).  3. Case Studies and Research Papers

     C. Present Activities of QUALITY 1. E-mail Once a user subscribes to
     QUALITY, (s)he may send mail to the list for distribution to all its
     members. All members of the mailing list will receive a copy of each
     piece of mail sent to the list.  All of the mail that is received and
     redistributed by the list is cataloged and stored in a logfile (for
     example, QUALITY LOG9303) that can be searched or retrieved by
     individuals with access to QUALITY.

     In order to prevent "rapid-fire" random e-mail transmissions, all
     messages are relayed to the QUALITY editor for a once or twice weekly
     batch mail release in digest form. In addition, each subscriber may
     disable the automatic QUALITY e-mail transmission to their site and
     download logfiles of each month's e-mail traffic.  2. QUALITY Filelist
     Datafiles are available for downloading. The objective is to develop a
     clearinghouse of information on TQM.

     To receive the current listing of files, send the following to the
     LISTSERV (not to QUALITY), with the following:  GET QUALITY FILELIST
     a) File Downloads GET filename filetype

     For example, GET QUALITY INTRO b) File subscriptions Specialized
     information or information which is too large for normal e-mail is
     placed in QUALITY datafiles for downloading by subscribers. A more
     complete description of the files are contained in the file QUALITY
     INDEX.

     You may "subscribe" to a datafile (such as QUALITY INDEX) in one of
     two ways: 1) automatic downloading of the entire file to your address
     with each update; 2) automatic notification that the file has been
     updated. You may terminate this file subscription upon demand.

     Send the following to the LISTSERV (not to QUALITY) at PUCC:  1) To
     download one file, one time, without subscribing:  GET filename
     filetype

     Example, GET QUALITY INDEX 2) To receive automatic file downloads
     (AFD=automatic file distribution) upon file updates:  AFD ADD filename
     filetype

     Example:  AFD ADD QUALITY INDEX 3) To cancel automatic file downloads:
     AFD DEL filename filetype 4) To receive automatic file update
     information (FUI):  FUI ADD filename filetype 5) To cancel automatic
     file update information:  FUI DEL filename filetype 6) To receive a
     list of files to which you are subscribed:  AFD LIST or FUI LIST 3.
     Potential/Future Activities a) electronic business newsletter b)
     electronic user directories c) bibliographies of current business
     research d) job bank

     D. Subscription to QUALITY Send E-mail to LISTSERV@PUCC or
     LISTSERV@PUCC.PRINCETON.EDU (not to QUALITY) with the body containing
     the appropriate command:  1. To add yourself SUB QUALITY yourfirstname
     yourlastname 2. To remove yourself SIGNOFF QUALITY

     E. Direct any questions to the list editor:

QUILT on listserv@cornell.edu -

     The QUILT maillist was formed to discuss quilting: questions, answers,
     book reports, tips, mail order sources, patterns and favorite stores.
     This maillist is a general quilting support group.  Many of the
     mailfiles contain questions and answers about quilting; many of the
     mailfiles are friendly, chatty discussions about quilting, sewing or
     life in general.  The volume of mailfiles ranges from 3-40 per week.
     Our group includes a mailing list and two quilt block exchanges.

     A list of archived files for this mailing list, including archives of
     the discussion on the list, can be found by sending the command INDEX
     QUILT in mail to listserv@cornell.edu.

     To subscribe to QUILT, send the following command to
     listserv@cornell.edu via mail text (NB--this server cannot accept
     interactive messages):

racefab@pms076.pms.ford.com                             [Last Update 11/92]

     "Racing fabrication and Engineering" list

     Purpose: Discussions about material strength, bearing fatigue, brake
     ducting, fuel cell installations, composites, molding fiberglass,
     special tools, suspension geometry and configurations, anti-dive,
     anti-squat, control arm placement, shock and strut valving, spindle
     design, floating rear ends, pan-hard bars and watts linkages, cage
     construction, chassis reinforcement, bearing specs, sources for
     information and materials and related topics.

     This is *Not* the place to ask "How can I make my stock Pinto with
     200K miles handle better?"

     I do see it as a place to ask how can I improve my braking geometry?
     Or how much anti-squat should I run?  Or what is the best way to
     attach control arms with spherical bearings to my chassis?  Before
     posting, I feel you should make an attempt to understand what Carroll
     Smith says about the subject in his _XXX to Win_ series.  If you don't
     understand what he says or disagree, this may be the best place to
     discuss it.

     Subscriptions, drops, changes and other admin requests should be sent
     to:

                    racefab-request@pms076.pms.ford.com

     Please include the type of racing you're involved in (autox, circle
     track, road race) and the type of race cars/bikes you work on/race.
     This information will be included in a monthly Whos-Who.  If you don't
     want to be in the whos-who, please let me know.

     rec.arts.startrek.info, a newsgroup dedicated to the dissemination of
     information about Star Trek.

     This is a one-way gateway, from news to mail.  Postings sent to the
     list RASI-L will NOT be gatewayed into the usenet newsgroup
     rec.arts.startrek.info, but will instead be redistributed to the list,
     and never make the newsgroup.  It is also imperative that you not
     reply to this list.  If you reply to the list, the reply will go to
     the root account.

     There are two addresses that are available for the
     rec.arts.startrek.info newsgroup, one is trek-info@scam.berkeley.edu,
     the other is trek-info-request@scam.berkeley.edu.  These addresses

     You may leave the list RASI-L at any time by sending a "SIGNOFF
     rasi-l" command to ncc1701!listserv@uunet.uu.net.  Please note that
     this command must NOT be sent to the list address nor moderator's
     addresses (trek-info@scam.berkeley.edu nor
     trek-info-request@scam.berkeley.edu), but it MUST be sent to the mail
     server which handles this mailing list.

     Please note that it is presently possible for anybody to determine
     that you are signed up to the list through the use of the "REVIEW
     RASI-L" command, which returns the network address of all subscribers.

ripe-map@nic.eu.net                          [Last Updated 28-January-1992]

     This is a mailing list for discussing the issues involved in mapping
     and visualising computer networks.  With the growth in complexity of
     computer networks, mapping is becoming more important as a
     visualisation technique and for finding anomalies.  There are numerous
     commericial and public domain tools available but many have serious
     limitations and are often specific to a single group of protocols.
     RIPE (Reseau IP Europeen) has set up a working group for studying the
     problem, this mailing list is intended as a forum for wider
     discussions.

     Some of the issues for discussion are listed here,

        - Auto-discovery, automatically discovering the topology of
          computer networks.  How can this be done, what standards
          need changing to do this efficiently.
        - Automatic Layout, Automatically laying out (or untangling)
          maps so that they look good on in a window or on a piece of
          paper.
        - Features, which feaures of existing tools are the best what
          else is wanted.
        - Formats, in what format should maps be stored and how should
          they be distributed.
        - Model, What database model should be used.  Should it be
          concerned purely with the graphic represention or should it
          try to model the underlying networks. Different types of map
          suitable for different purposes, what are the catagories.
        - Other Tools and Standards, how can existing tools and
          protocols be tied in with a mapping database.
        - Symbols, Standard symbols for representing network entities.
          How should the status of such entities be drawn.

Right_Use_of_Will@kether.webo.dg.com         [Last Updated 12-October-1991]
     or will@kether.webo.dg.com

     This mailing list is for people interested in discussing topics
     related to the series of books by Ceanne DeRohan, the first of which
     is called The Right Use of Will, Healing and Evolving the Emotional
     Body.

     These are not ordinary self-help books that show you how to change
     your life; these books can help you save it.

     The understandings given in these four books were received from God in
     the first person.  They are are first so startling, so unlike anything
     you would expect to hear, that you are apt to become very angry, or
     flatly incredulous.  These understandings have to do with the split
     that has occurred in each of us between Spirit (male intellect), and
     Will (female feelings): how this split occurred, and why it has to be
     healed now, and to go about it.  These are not easy books to read, or
     to fully understand at first reading.  But they are very worth your
     while.

     When you have completed the series, you will have some understanding
     of how the Cosmos came into being, who the four parts of the One God
     are, who Lucifer is, who the created spirits are and how, why, and
     when they emerged, where you emerged, what went wrong from the very
     beginning, the roles played by denial, blame, and guilt, why we and
     the entire creation, including God, are in peril, and whether you want
     to heal and remain within God, or not.

     Individuals interested in the concepts of Will, emotional healing,
     Earth's and Creation's current evolutionary track, and the healing of
     the Divine Feminine and Masculine (within and without) are encouraged
     to read the books and join in on the discussion.

     The service address, to which questions about the list itself and
     requests to be added to or deleted from it should be directed, are as
     follows:

     Will-Request@kether.webo.dg.com

SBN on LISTSERV@IndyCMS                                 [Last Updated 9/92]
     or LISTSERV@IndyCMS.IUPUI.EDU

     SBNnet is an experiment in human networking for computer users in
     north central Indiana and southwest lower Michigan USA.  (SBN is the
     standard, three character aviation designation for South Bend, Indiana
     USA, the area's approximate geographic center.)

     The South Bend area community possesses a significant pool of talent
     in a wide variety of fields and academic disciplines.  SBNnet is an
     attempt to link that talent pool (making it more accessible to the
     area's computer-using community at large) and to foster a sense of
     community as electronic neighbors.  It is hoped SBNnet will include
     participants from area business and industry, higher education, non-
     profit organizations, and private individuals, joining in from home
     and work, to help their electronically connected neighbors.

     SBNnet is a network without dedicated hardware.  It uses electronic
     mail lists to disseminate information of local interest and to
     facilitate voluntary communication, assistance and cooperation between
     its participants.  Its only requirement for participation is some form
     of access to e-mail -- connection to academic / research networks such
     as BITNET / CREN / EARN / NetNorth et al, commercial services such as
     CompuServe and MCI Mail, uucp mail, etc -- in order to receive and
     reply to messages from other participants.  There is absolutely no
     cost for participating in SBNnet.  The only potential cost is that of
     an individual's access to electronic mail itself, since that is the
     medium through which SBNnet operates.

     SBNnet presently consists of eight distinct components, each a
     separate e-mail list available by free subscription from
     ListServ@IndyCMS / ListServ@IndyCMS.IUPUI.Edu:

        - SBNbirds South Bend area birds.  SBNbirds is for news and
          discussion of birds living in and/or flying through our
          community.
        - SBNchat South Bend area conversation.  SBNchat is for
          neighborly conversation about news, sports, weather, etc.,
          of interest in our community.
        - SBNevent South Bend area events.  SBNevent is for listings
          and notices of events of interest in our community.
        - SBNhelp South Bend area help.  SBNhelp is an electronic
          cross between a library reference desk, a community
          information and referral center, and a computing center help
          desk -- with the twist that all SBNnet participants are
          potential service providers as well as service users (i.e.,
          "from each according to his abilities, to each according to
          his needs").  SBNhelp is intended to provide a forum for
          informal information and referral, and reference; it is not
          limited in subject matter (except that its use for any type
          of commercial promotion or transaction is strictly
          prohibited).  The modus operandi for the help component is
          that a participant with a question or need posts an e-mail
          message to the SBNhelp list (address:
          SBNhelp@IndyCMS.IUPUI.Edu), which is then automatically
          redistributed to all other participants.  Any participant
          who has an idea to help answer the question or address the
          need (or even suggest another possible resource for doing
          same) then posts an e-mail message back to the SBNhelp list
          in reply, and that reply is automatically redistributed to
          the list.  In order to succeed and provide a valuable
          service to our community's computer users, the help
          component only needs its participants to read SBNhelp e-mail
          traffic and to respond to those messages with which they may
          be able to help.
        - SBNjobs South Bend area jobs.  SBNjobs is for announcements
          of positions available in the South Bend area, and for
          statements of qualifications and interests of those persons
          seeking employment in our community.
        - SBNnews South Bend area news.  SBNnews is for the
          distribution of local and regional news of interest in our
          community.
        - SBNsport South Bend area sports.  SBNsport is for the
          distribution of sports information and scores of interest in
          our community.
        - SBNwx South Bend area weather.  SBNwx is for the
          distribution of weather information of interest in our
          community.

     A ninth list, SBN, is a superlist which automatically adds the
     subscriber to seven of the eight separate components described above.
     SBNwx is available only by separate subscription.

     A tenth list, SBNnet-L, is used to discuss the design, implementation
     and management of SBNnet, South Bend's human/e computing network.

     SBNnet is a network of good will and neighborliness, a dedicated
     service for the computer users of our community, computer users from
     all walks of life, at home and at work.  Having dealt with ListServ
     lists extensively over the past two to three years, I know personally
     the impact this technology can have on communication on a national and
     international scale; I believe it can also be applied closer to home
     to facilitate the dissemination and exchange of information locally.

     If you are interested in participating in or observing this project,
     please contact me at the e-mail address or telephone number below.  I
     hope you will choose to be a part of SBNnet, South Bend's human/e
     computing network.

     SCUG-G on LISTSERV@IBM.GWDG.DE (Internet)

     Since foundation of list L-VMCTR@AKRONVM we revealed some problems
     that could not be discussed in this list, because they are specially
     related to our situation in the middle of Europe.  Therefore we set up
     a list, called SCUG-G (Systems Center User Group - German), which is
     located at Goettingen (DGOGWDG1.BITNET), Germany.

     This new list is concerned to all software components of VMCENTER,
     VMCENTER II and to VMSPOOL of Systems Center, Inc., Reston.  Topics we
     want to discuss are:

           legal aspects of Systems Center software
           COCOM restrictions
           difficulties caused by the technical support in Frankfurt/Main et al.
           price policy problems (which usually occur 1 year later than in USA)
           announcements of the german Systems Center User Group

     There is no intention to compete with L-VMCTR.  Discussion language
     should be German.

SF-LOVERS@RUTGERS.EDU

     SF-LOVERS has discussed many topics, all of them related in some way
     to the theme of science fiction or fantasy.  The topics have ranged
     very widely from rewritten stories, SF and fantasy books, SF movies,
     and SF conventions to reviews of books, movies and television shows.
     The range of topics is quite wide and anyone is welcome to submit
     material on these or other topics of interest in this general area.

     The digest has a very large number of readers, and trivial messages
     are strongly discouraged due to the heavy load SF-LOVERS puts on the
     hosts CPU and disk space.  Messages to SF-LOVERS@RUTGERS.EDU are
     batched and broadcast periodically.

     The SF-LOVERS archives are available via anonymous ftp on
     ELBERETH.RUTGERS.EDU, a unix machine running BSD 4.3.  Each volume is
     contained in its own file, with the contents ordered chronologically.
     The first archive includes a number of messages from the early days
     before digests and there is much of "historical" interest.

     /u2/ftp/pub/sfl:

        2128 sf-lovers.v1      1648 sf-lovers.v8      7568 sf-lovers.v14b

         592 sf-lovers.v7      6000 sf-lovers.v13

     For those unfamiliar with unix, the number to the left of the file
     name is the size of the file in kilobytes.  Volume 16 is the current
     volume.  Old issues for the current volume are also available from the
     archives in the files sf-lovers.xxxyy where "xxx" is the month of
     publication and "yy" is the current year.  BITNET subscribers who
     currently do not have access to anonymous ftp may send mail to
     BITFTP@PUCC.BITNET with ftp commands as text of the mail message.
     Further instructions are available on request.

     Also in the archives are some files that may be of interest including
     episode guides for popular television shows.  A partial list as of
     (May 1 1991) is:

     For INTERNET subscribers, all requests to be added to or deleted from
     this list should be sent to SF-LOVERS-REQUEST@RUTGERS.EDU.  BITNET
     subscribers may issue the following command:

     TELL LISTSERV at RUTVM1 command SFLOVERS "name"

     where "command" is either SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE as appropriate.
     Problems and administrative questions should always be sent to
     SF-LOVERS-REQUEST@RUTGERS.EDU.  Submissions for the digest are to be
     sent to SF-LOVERS@RUTGERS.EDU only.  Unfortunately, due to the large
     volume of mail that I receive every day, messages sent to the wrong
     address are very likely to be unprocessed.

SFS-L on LISTSERV@SEARN.BITNET or LISTSERV@SEARN.SUNET.SE

     SFS-L, has been opened on SEARN to discuss the VM shared file system.
     The reason for creating a new list is that the SFS was previously
     discussed on several lists with a rather small intersection (VMESA-L,
     VMREL6-L, and occasionally some apparently unrelated lists such as
     LSTSRV-L or VM-UTIL).  In addition, it seems unlikely that a majority
     of the readers of these lists are interested in long debates about the
     SFS, which is after all only an optional component of VM.  The goal is
     thus to keep the "mainstream" VM lists for the more general CP and CMS
     issues, and gather interested parties from all related mailing lists
     into a new "specialized" list.

     The scope of the list is not restricted to any particular version of
     the SFS (VM/SP 6 vs VM/ESA), nor to any particular topic.  We will try
     to answer technical questions, will debate usability issues, and will
     gladly welcome installation/configuration hints or even software
     contributions.  Non-technical discussions (company policies, how to
     deal with workstation users, etc) are welcome, as long as they do not
     degenerate into pointless religious arguments.  In particular,
     "flames" about the CMS file system will not be tolerated.  Intelligent
     criticism is, of course, allowed.

     Subscribing to SFS-L

     You will have to send the following command to LISTSERV:

     SUBSCRIBE SFS-L My Name

     BITNET users can send the command via an interactive message to
     LISTSERV AT SEARN:

     TELL LISTSERV AT SEARN SUB SFS-L John A. Doe

     Internet users should send mail to LISTSERV@SEARN.SUNET.SE with the
     SUBSCRIBE command in the mail BODY.

     SGANET on LISTSERV@VTVM1

     SGANet: An International Mailing Network for Student Government
     Associations

     SGANet, developed and implemented at Virginia Polytechnic Institute
     and State University, is an international mailing network for Student
     Government Associations, student representative councils, student
     parliaments, etc.  to use in discussing issues faced by such
     organizations worldwide.

     SGANet can be reached through InterNet, an international electronic
     mail network which links universities and corporations throughout the
     world.  Internet is easy to use and in many cases free of cost. Our
     operating costs for this network are minimal as should be yours.

     SGANet is easy to use and will be the host of many interesting
     discussions which will be of great interest to your organization.
     SGANet is open to any student government association at any university
     worldwide.

     SGANet is an automated mailing list located at Virginia Tech. Let's
     say, for example, that a student government association from a
     university in Australia wants to share some of the issues it is
     working on. They would simply write their article and send it via mail
     to one of the addresses above SGANet then receives their mail and
     sends copies of it to every organization on the list. There is no
     limit to mail usage, and any one on the list can submit an article for
     distribution. It's that simple and it's very low in cost, in many
     cases FREE.

     To become a member of SGANet:

     Send the following message to LISTSERV%VTMV1.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU:

     subscribe SGANet (Your organization's full name)

     {You will receive acknolwedgement and instructions upon receipt of
     your subscription}

     Send articles, comments, anecdotes, etc. to SGANet@VTVM1.BITNET They
     will be automatically sent to everyone on the list. This allows for
     really good interactive discussions.

SHAKSPER on LISTSERV@UTORONTO

     SHAKSPER is a scholarly BITNET seminar modelled on HUMANIST, currently
     involving more than ninety Shakespearean researchers, instructors,
     students, and interested amateurs from seven countries.  A number of
     national and international Shakespeare organizations have expressed an
     interest in formal involvement, and a number of traditional journals
     have announced it to their readership.

     The SHAKSPER Fileserver offers conference papers and abstracts, an
     Index to Scholarly Works in Progress, an International Directory of
     Shakespeare Institutes, a Directory of Shakespearean Conferences and
     Calls for Papers, biographies of conference members, and reference
     files on a wide variety of subjects.  Members of a number of seminars
     at the upcoming SAA Conference in Vancouver will find their colleagues
     ready to share papers, comments, and strategies in advance.
     SHAKSPEReans also gain indirect access to the SHAKSPER Quarto/Folio
     Textbase, a 17-megabyte textbase of all 55 authoritative quarto and
     folio texts of the 38 plays.

     The daily SHAKSPER digests offer an opportunity for informal
     discussion, eavesdropping, peer review, and a fresh sense of worldwide
     community.  Conference announcements, Shakespeare Association
     bulletins, member notes and queries, book and theatre reviews, textual
     debate, discussion of lecture strategies -- SHAKSPER has already
     logged all this and much more.

     No academic qualifications are required for membership in SHAKSPER,
     and anyone interested in English Literature, the Renaissance, or Drama
     is welcome to join us.  Write to the editor, Ken Steele
     <KSTEELE@vm.epas.utoronto.ca>, or send the command SUB SHAKSPER
     firstname lastname to LISTSERV@UTORONTO in the body of mail or via an
     interactive message such as TELL LISTSERV AT UTORONTO SUB SHAKSPER

SHARP-L on LISTSERV@IUBVM.BITNET or LISTSERV@IUBVM.UCS.INDIANA.EDU

     SHARP-L is a new list devoted to the history of the printed word.  In
     affiliation with the newly-founded Society for the History of
     Authorship, Reading, and Publishing, SHARP-L means to give all of us
     who take an interest in this burgeoning field a way of exchanging
     ideas, information, and inquiries with other scholars in all
     disciplines all over the world.  Whether your interest is incunabula
     or 20th-century American periodicals, literacy studies or the
     economics of the book trade, library history or literary theory, this
     is a list, and an organization, that hopes to bring us all together
     and get us acquainted.  SHARP-L can be a way of bridging the
     occupational, disciplinary, and geographical differences among
     students of print culture that have tended to keep us isolated and
     all-too-ignorant of one another's work and interests.

     Subscribing to SHARP-L is easy.  Just send an e-mail message to
     LISTSERV@IUBVM on BITNET or LISTSERV@IUBVM.UCS.INDIANA.EDU and include
     in the BODY of the message (NOT the subject) the line:

     SUBSCRIBE SHARP-L your full name

     To post a message to the list, simply address it to either
     "SHARP-L@IUBVM" (the Binet address) or "SHARP-L@IUBVM.UCS.INDIANA.EDU"

SHOGI-L%TECHNION.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
     SHOGI-L on LISTSERV@TECHNION

     SHOGI-L, the Shogi Discussion List, is a new mailing list started on
     May 6, 1990 about the strategic board game of Shogi. The list is
     intended to serve as a discussion point for Shogi-related topics and
     as a source of information about Shogi tactics and Shogi events. It
     also offers to Shogi players the possibility to engage in e-mail games
     in a friendly ladder competition.

     Shogi is much like 'western' chess, but has some very interesting
     differences.  One is that almost all pieces can promote to stronger
     pieces once they reach the opposite side of the board. The second very
     important difference is that when a piece is captured, it becomes a
     piece for the capturing side, and can be dropped back onto the board !
     This makes for a very exciting game, with an extremely low percentage
     of draws. Many strong Chess players, such as International Master
     Larry Kaufman in the US (who is the strongest non-Japanese player
     outside Japan), have found Shogi to be a great game to play.

     Although played by millions in Japan, so far it isn't well known
     outside Japan. But surely, there are some net-people out there who
     would like to play or get to know more about it. For Apple Macintosh
     owners we also have a Hypercard Shogi Stack available, which contains
     valuable information for every Shogi novice. We would also like to get
     source or executable code for a program that plays Shogi.

     How to subscribe:

     Anyone who has direct access to Bitnet can sign on to the list by
     sending a mail (preferrably), a file or an interactive message to

     Forum for the Discussion of Small Computer Systems Software Reviews
     and Related Issues

     STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:  SOFTREVU will provide a forum where users of
     personal computers and other small computing systems can review,
     discuss, and examine software products.  Cross-platform compatibility
     issues related to software and hardware, with an emphasis placed on
     software, are also included in this forum.  The relevance, intentions,
     and uses of various software product categories, such as

      * Personal Information Managers (PIMs)                               * Connectivity (communications)
      * Utilities                                                          * Shells and "Front Ends"
      * Graphics (formats, design packages)                                * Object-oriented Software
      * Optical Character Recognition (OCR)                                * Programming Language Environments
      * Multimedia products                                                * Integrated Packages
      * Desktop Publishing (DTP)


     The three "basics"--Databases, Spreadsheets and Text Managers are also
     included.  Multimedia-based integration of various application
     categories, discussed from a software perspective, is also encouraged.
     Software Products include new software packages as well as the latest
     upgrades/updates to existing software products/packages.  Members are
     encouraged to share knowledge of existing software packages in
     addition to that of new features being incorporated into upgrades of
     these products.  Members are also encouraged to share knowledge (such
     as the uses, applications, and features) of recently introduced
     software products.  Therefore, members of the list are encouraged to
     act as "consultants" and "enquirers" where appropriate.

     In accordance with current CREN regulations, commercial activity (such
     as the selling of software) will be prohibited.

     SCOPE:  SOFTREVU is intended to cover all microcomputer platforms;
     such as the Apple Macintosh line, Amigas, IBM PS/2 line, PC
     compatibles, the NeXT machines, Sun and SPARC workstations, and the
     like.  Within the scope of these computing platforms, a wide range of
     software products exist.  Any and all of these products are viable
     discussion topics.  SOFTREVU does not exist as a topic for issues of
     ethics in computing - see the ETHICS-L list.  However, the merits of
     software packages, such as their user interface, compatibility across
     disparate computing platforms, and the like, are acceptable topics.
     List subscribers are encouraged to ask questions about software, and
     to offer up their opinions.  In keeping with current CREN (Corporation
     for Research and Educational Networking) and InterNET policies,
     subscribers are prohibited from attempting to sell software over the
     network.  However, the list moderators cannot be held responsible for
     the actions of list subscribers.

     SOFTREVU does not exist as a forum for the discussion of hardware or
     programming issues except where the relevance to existing or
     forthcoming software is explicit.  Hardware issues should be directed
     to the PCTECH-L and PCSUPT-L lists, which are geared toward
     discussions of that nature.  Programming and/or technical issues
     should be brought up in any of the various lists and special interest
     groups which are designed for this purpose.  Only extremely limited
     concerns in customization of existing software are included, such as
     writing simple macros, scripts, and other modest routines.  With
     respect to programming languages, the merits of the environment
     package - not the actual language - are appropriate for discussion.

     MEMBERSHIP:  Any person who wishes to share knowledge, answer
     questions and/or desires to learn and ask questions is welcome.
     Potential members include users, consultants, programmers, managers,
     and the like.  This list is intended to bring together people from all
     backgrounds to share information.

     GUIDELINES:  SOFTREVU is a moderated list.  The atmosphere of this
     list is one of mutual support to all members and advocates
     cooperation.  Members are expected to engage in constructive criticism
     only.  Subscribers are requested to keep personal vendettas off the
     list.  This is not a forum for political or ethical discussions in any
     capacity; it is a forum for the discussion of software.  Problems or
     complaints should be addressed to the list moderators.  Anyone who
     does not maintain this policy, or is generally disruptive to the
     harmony of this list, will be removed.

     MODERATORS:

             Jamie Donnelly IV,   ENCSADM1@UCONNVM.BITNET
             Elaine Brennan,      ELAINE@BrownVM.Brown.EDU
             David B. O'Donnell,  EL406006@BrownVM.Brown.EDU

     ARCHIVING:  The list will maintain monthly archives of discussions.
     These archives will be purged periodically, removing outdated
     material, and to save system space and overhead.  Announcements will
     be made prior to major purges, but subscribers should expect purges
     every few months.  If necessary, either local or remote filespace may
     be set aside for the storage of documents of relevance to the list.

     ACCESSING THE LIST:  To subscribe to SOFTREVU send the command,

     SUBSCRIBE SOFTREVU <yourname>

     to LISTSERV@BROWNVM (LISTSERV@BrownVM.Brown.EDU).  DO NOT SEND LIST

STAC-WG on LISTSERV@SEARN.SUNET.SE                    [Last Update 3/93] or
     LISTSERV@SEARN.BITNET

     STAC (Science & Technology Advisory Council) composes of expatriate
     Filipino scientists, professionals and their colleagues and is
     organized by the Dept of Foreign Affairs, Republic of the Philippines.
     STAC-WG is a mailing list for the working group to prepare the project
     proposal for the establishment of STACnet.  The working group will,
     among others things:

        1. develop STACnet objectives
        2. propose a network structure
        3. outline the status of email facilities and services in the
           Philippines
        4. provide an initial list of cooperating partners and
           participants
        5. identify key partners
        6. make a proposal of selected activities, which may range
           from network support (installation of computer facilities
           for communication, access and use of existing facilities)
           to ideas on how to use STACnet to support existing
           development programs of the Philippines.

     Dr. Federico M Macaranas coordinates this programme which has a
     central focus is to use expatriate resources in key development
     programs of the country.  STACs members thus monitor scientific and
     technological developments abroad, facilitate technology transfer and
     may perform consultancies or provide assistance to public and private
     sectors in the Philippines.  Several STACs have been established
     abroad.  The proposed STACnet would serve as the electronic arm of the
     STAC network.  It will be a network of people who can communicate by
     email and its primary goal would be to fortify the existing
     organizational structure of STAC and its activities.

     MEMBERSHIP:  To become a member of the list, please send your request
     to the list owner and kindly include information on your interests and
     how you may contribute to the establishment of STACnet.

     Audience: Administrators, operators, and/or users of StarServer
     systems

     This list is envisioned as a resource for administrators and
     operators, as they confront the peculiarities of the StarServer family
     and its opera- ting system (System V Release 4).

     While this list is open to all, it is NOT envisioned as a "Unix
     Questions and Answers" list; that audience is already served by
     several mailing lists and Usenet newsgroups.

     The list operates through the standard rebroadcast mechanism; any
     messages sent to the list address are immediately rebroadcast to the
     list's members.  If the list's traffic grows significantly, I will
     consider moving the list to a digest format.

     The list is archived, but the archives are not currently available to
     the general public.  Anonymous FTP of the archives will become
     available during the summer of 1992.

     To subscribe, send an electronic mail message to:
     starserver-request@engr.uky.edu Postings intended for the distribution
     list should be sent to:  starserver@engr.uky.edu Comments, questions,
     or suggestions about the list should be directed to:

STATLG-L%SBCCVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

     The Neon-Sign Baseball Statistics League is a BITNET rotisserie league
     for the ultimate baseball fans.  The Neon Sign Stat League (NSSL) is a
     head-to-head rotisserie league which pits fan against fan in the goal
     of assembling the best baseball team from among ML players.  Weekly
     performance is determined based upon player performance and
     wins-losses are determined by comparing two teams which 'play' each
     other each week.  Two or three NSSL seasons are played during each ML
     season.  Choosing lineups and trading players requires strategy and a
     lot of luck.  Users interested in Rotisserie League Baseball are
     invited to subscribe.

STUT-HLP@BGU.EDU                                         [Last Update 6/93]
     STUT-HLP@ECNUXA.BITNET

     STUT-HLP is intended to be a support list for people who stutter and
     their families.  It is not intended to be an academic discussion list,
     since other lists (stutt-l stutt-x) currently exist to serve that
     purpose.

     The idea for STUT-HLP grew from my observation that the current lists
     that are available for stuttering seem to serve the needs of academics
     rather than people who stutter.  I don't feel that this is
     intentional, but it happens nonetheless.  STUT-HLP will be for
     individuals who stutter, and the observations of these individuals
     will not be inhibited by theoretical discussions of stuttering.  I
     think we all can agree that the way that stuttering is approached by
     the person who stutters is often different from that of the person who
     *treats* stutterers.  SLPs and other professionals are welcome to join
     the list and to "listen to" and consider what is said by the
     participants.  However, I will discourage anyone who uses the list as
     a forum to promote a particular approach to therapy, or who attempts
     to diminish the seriousness or importance of what any list participant
     has to say.

     You can join STUT-HLP by sending a "subscribe" message to
     listserv@bgu.edu (internet) or listserv@ecnuxa.bitnet in the following
     form:

     subscribe stut-hlp 'your full name'

     Let me reiterate that *in no way* is this list intended to be a
     replacement for, or a competitor to, either stutt-l or stutt-x.  I
     think all three lists can coexist peacefully.

     If you have comments, contact me at mfrwq@bgu.edu or
     mfrwq@ecnuxa.bitnet.

     Thanks for your consideration.  Let me know if you need additional
     information.

STUTT-L%TEMPLEVM.BITNET@VM!.NODAK.EDU

     Mailing list to facilitate the exchange of information among
     researchers and clinicians working on the problem of stuttering.
     Researchers are encouraged to submit descriptions of current projects
     (purpose, procedures, results if any, current status) and to raise
     questions that may be of interest to other researchers.  Clinicians
     are encouraged to describe unusual, interesting, or provocative cases
     and to ask for consultation on particularly difficult cases.
     Individuals who stutter may also want to get information about
     therapy, recent research results, etc.

     BitNet users may subscribe by sending the following command by
     interactive message or e-mail to LISTSERV@TEMPLEVM:  SUBSCRIBE STUTT-L
     Your_full_name Where "Your_full_name" is your real name, not your

STUXCH-L@PSUVM.PSU.EDU                       [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     STUXCH-L@PSUVM is a list for students in art, architecture, and both

SUEARN-L on LISTSERV@UBVM (aka LISTSERV@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU)

     The SUEARN-L consists of news items, articles, and how-to questions
     about the ongoing work on connecting the U.S.S.R.  to international
     computer networks (the internet) contributed by its readers,
     cross-posted from other mailing lists, and retyped (usually without
     permission) from the "real" press.

     Topics often discussed include directions on reaching Soviet sites by
     e-mail, discussions of how modems and other equipment work over Soviet
     phone lines, technology export restrictions, and prospects for
     connecting more sites to the net.

     Submissions for the digest should be mailed to
     SUEARN-L@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU.  They will be automatically forwarded by
     the LISTSERV to the editor, who puts together the digest and mails one
     out every week or so.  Questions of the type "Is Soviet site S
     reachable by e-mail?" may be answered by private e-mail if the editor
     knows the answer.

     The digest is distributed by a LISTSERV mailing list.  As with other
     such lists, one subscribes by sending a NJE interactive message or
     mail saying in its body

     SUB SUEARN-L Your name

     to LISTSERV@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU (or any other LISTSERV).  If you try
     this and fail, ask one of the list owners to help you with your
     subscription.  Many sites channel SUEARN-L digests into NOTES, NEWS,
     RN, or similar systems that let many users read a single copy of the
     digest.  If you're at such a site, you can save some network bandwidth
     by reading such a "public" copy, instead of having your personal copy
     e-mailed to you.

        List Editor/Owner: Mike Meystel MEYSTMA@DUVM.BITNET
        List Owner:        Dimitri Vulis DLV@CUNYVMS1.BITNET

     Additional Information:

     Like most good things on Internet, SUEARN-L free, unless you use a
     commercial e-mail system, gatewayed to Internet, that charges you for
     incoming mail.  The digest is sent out about once a week, and is
     typically several hundred lines long.

     Please note that the Baltic states aren't considered to be part of
     USSR by the editors of this digest, and the discussion of e-mail
     connection to these countires should be sent to BALT-L, not to
     SUEARN-L; but the discussion of computer network situation in Eastern
     and Central Europe as a whole (including, but not limited to the USSR)
     have been posted in the past.

     HISTORY: SUEARN-L was split off RusTeX-L in the summer of 1990.
     (RusTeX-L dealt originally with both quietions of Cyrillic (Russian
     and other) text processing and Soviet e-mail (the people interested in
     one are usually interested in the other)).  By that time, RusTeX-L
     traffic dealing with e-mail increased sufficiently to annoy those
     RusTeX-L readers not interested in the technical aspects of exchanging
     e-mail with the USSR, so SUEARN-L was born (leaving RusTeX-L for
     Cyrillic text processing discussions only), and reached its present
     form (a moderated weekly digest) after months of trial and error.

T-ASSIST on LISTSERV@UNMVMA.UNM.EDU or LISTSERV@UNMVMA.BITNET

     A list for college and university teaching assistants around the
     world.  This list is for those students who help or assist the
     professor or lecturer in their classroom duties.

     University teaching assistants have a variety of responsibilities.
     The purpose of this discussion group is to give teaching assistants
     the opportunity to discuss the roles of being a teacher and a student.
     Some questions to stimulate our conversation include:

        - What kinds of teaching techniques do you use?
        - How can you motivate students and stimulate discussion?
        - How can you promote a supportive classroom climate?
        - How can you set expectations for students that are high
          enough to challenge but not to overwhelm?
        - How can you review for tests, write examinations and
          assignments and grade?
        - How can you balance being a teacher and student?

     These and many more issues can be discussed in this teaching assistant
     discussion group.  Your ideas are encouraged.

     To subscribe to the list, send e-mail to:

     listserv@unmvma.unm.edu (or listserv@unmvma for Bitnet)

     and in the body of the message put the line:

tadream@vacs.uwp.wisc.edu

     Purpose: Tadream is a forum for discussions about Tangerine Dream and
     related artists. The discussions are not moderated, but discussions
     should have some small relation to Tangerine Dream (solo works and
     instrumentation discussions are welcome). The list is set up both as a
     mail relay and a daily digest. (alternate mail-paths:

tandem@hobbes.ucsd.edu                                   [Last Update 9/92]

     A mailing list for tandem bicycle enthusiasts.  Suitable topics
     include questions and answers related to tandem componentry, riding
     technique, brands and equipment selection, prices, clubs, rides and
     other activities, cooperating on a section on tandems for the
     rec.bicycles.* FAQ, etc.

     This list is not intended to subvert the various rec.bicycles
     newsgroups, rather to supplement them - items of general interest
     should be posted to the newsgroups.  Faster response to specific
     questions, a slightly more private forum in which opinions can be
     expressed with reduced fear of repercussion, and a place to carry on
     about tandems far beyond what might be considered "polite" in the
     general purpose newsgroups are some of the anticipated benefits.

     To subscribe, send a message to "listserv@hobbes.ucsd.edu" with the
     line "subscribe tandem firstname lastname" in the message body, where
     <firstname lastname> is your own name.  The list server will deduce
     your email address.  Once subscribed, send messages to the list at
     "tandem@hobbes.ucsd.edu", and send administrative requests to the
     listserver "listserv@hobbes.ucsd.edu" or to
     "tandem-request@hobbes.ucsd.edu"

tbi-sprt on listserv@moria.nfbcal.org                    [Last Update 5/93]

     tbi-sprt is a list created for the exchange of information by
     survivors, supporters, and professionals concerned with traumatic
     brain injury and other neurological impairments which currently lack a
     forum.  We know from our own experience that one of the main
     difficulties people dealing with tbi face is that their time is mostly
     dominated by the survivor's recovery process.  Accessing support
     groups or networking of any kind can seem like one more thing to add
     to an already packed schedule.  A forum such as this is available at
     all hours of the day or night and does not need to become one more
     event that must be scheduled.

     An additional service we plan to provide is gathering and making
     available resource files that can be retrieved from the listserv.  We
     encourage submissions and suggestions.

     To subscribe send mail to listserv@moria.nfbcal.org.  Leave the
     subject line blank and in the body of the message put subscribe
     tbi-sprt your name (where "your name" is as you want it to appear in
     the list).

     Contact:  For more information send email to: tbisupt@moria.nfbcal.org
     (Note the difference between the LIST name, tbi-sprt, and the SUPPORT
     userid, tbisupt).

TCP-IP@NIC.DDN.MIL

     An unmoderated list for the discussion of topics related to the TCP/IP
     protocols.  It is hoped that this distribution list can aid in the
     following areas:

        - To act as an on-line exchange among TCP developers and
          maintainers.
        - To announce new and expanded services in a timely manner.

     All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
     questions, etc., should be sent to TCP-IP-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.  Please
     do not send such requests to TCP-IP@NIC.DDN.MIL, as this address is
     self forwarding to the entire list membership.

     Archives for messages to the list starting in 1991 are available on
     nicfs.nic.ddn.mil in a Unix compressed format.  A full set of archives
     is available on the Internet CD from SRI International.

TECHWR-L on LISTSERV@OSUVM1.BITNET                       [Last Update 3/93]
     or listserv@vm1.ucc.okstate.edu

     Techwr-l is a new list for technical communicators and related issues.
     Anything related to any facet of technical communication (practice,
     research, teaching) is appropriate for this list.

     Some possible topics or questions could include:

        - How do you handle uncooperative engineers or programmers?
        - What do others do about making technical writing a priority
          in their companies?
        - I am researching user documentation (vendor-ware) and would
          like to contact anyone who has written after-market
          documentation for any platform.
        - I still cannot decide how to include commands in sentences
          without either confusing readers, ignoring rules of English
          use, or both.  Help!
        - What is vendor-ware?
        - I cannot seem to convince my students of the importance of
          audience analysis when writing proposals. Does anyone have
          exercises or real-life examples which might help?
        - I am a new technical writer at a company manufacturing heavy
          equipment. My employer insists on using terminology which is
          not consistent with industry standards. Users have said is
          confusing. How might I persuade this company to change the
          policy?
        - I just spent three months working on a new user's manual for
          ULTRIX. If anyone would like a copy for reference, or to
          adapt with attribution, please contact me at
          generous@very.very.nice
        - Does anyone have any experience using the new tech writing
          textbook by anonymous? I couldn't find a review in Tech
          Comm.
        - I am trying to decide if my company should use Framemaker or
          PageMaker for medium-length manuals. Has anyone had
          particularly good or bad experiences with doing manuals on
          either one?

TeX-Pubs@SHSU.BITNET

     A new distribution list for TeX-related electronic form periodicals --
     TeX-Pubs -- is being made available in addition to INFO-TeX for your
     convenience.  Initially, the distribution will include TeXhax Digest,
     UKTeX, and TeXMaG.

     The intent of TeX-Pubs is to allow users a single site for delivery of
     electronic form periodicals, such as TeXhax, UKTeX, and TeXMaG, as
     well as any others which may be brought to my attention (possibly also
     including the periodic "frequently asked questions" posts from
     USENET's comp.text.tex).  This list is offerred in lieu of directly
     posting these documents to INFO-TeX.  The decision to create a support
     list is in an effort to provide this information to interested
     readers, but not replicate it for those who wish to retain their
     current subscription(s) and not be bothered by extraneous material on
     INFO-TeX.

     There will be no direct archives for TeX-Pubs.  Instead, each of the
     included periodicals will have its own directory available for
     retrieval at FILESERV@SHSU.BITNET.

     If you would like to subscribe to TeX-Pubs, please MAIL the command:
     SUBSCRIBE TeX-Pubs in the body of a message to LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET.
     This LISTSERV is MAIL-oriented only; interactive messages sent to
     LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET will be ignored.

     Any questions regarding TeX-Pubs or INFO-TeX should be directed to
     their owner:

THEOLOGY <U16481%UICVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU> [Last Updated 12-October-1991]

     Mailing list dedicated to the intellectual discussion of religion.
     Intellectual is stressed as opposed to the "personal", the
     inspirational, or evangelistic.  This does not mean one cannot
     evangelize, but rather that participants should persuade rather than
     brow-beat or attack those they disagree with.  Arguments are
     inevitable, but they ultimately should resolve into mutual
     understanding or at least a truce.

     What are the fit subjects? - the Cosmos is the limit; some might be:

        - World Religions - Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam,
          Judaism especially inter-religious dialogue.
        - Apologetics - How should a religious perspective operate in
          relation to critical questioning?  For example, can you
          prove God exists if evil also does?
        - Conversion - By what means or methods should one faith seek
          to increase its members?  Or is this out-of-bounds in a
          pluralistic society?
        - Dogma - What are the basic tenets of a world religion?  Are
          they coherent?  Should they be?  What do they derive from,
          revelation or something else?
        - Ethics - Should religious beliefs and values seek to get
          involved in politics?  Should an individual religious person
          seek to promote their morals apart from their own religious
          communities?

     TOOLB-L@UAFSYSB.BITNET

     This list provides a discussion of Asymetrix ToolBook software,
     application development, and it's integration into a multimedia
     environment.  University of Arkansas serves as host to the listserver.

     TOOLB-L is a list to provide an unmoderated environment where issues,
     questions, comments, ideas, and uses of Asymetrix's ToolBook and it's
     OpenScript language can be freely discussed.

     The explicit purpose of TOOLB-L is to provide timely interchange
     between subscribers, to provide a forum where interesting questions
     can be addressed within the context of interactive exchange between
     many individuals, and to discuss the evolution of ToolBook
     applications.  The discussions of TOOLB-L will be archived and
     available for reference.  In the future it is hoped this list will
     lead to the establishment of public domain toolbook archives.  These
     archives would be very similar to the currently existing archives of
     hypercard stacks.  As is the case on all unmoderated lists, the
     discussion and topics are only limited by the participation and
     interest of its subscribers.  Subscribers are welcome to take an
     active role by posting to TOOLB-L or an inactive role by monitoring
     the list.

     To subscribe to TOOLB-L, please send a MAIL message to:
     LISTSERV@UAFSYSB.UARK.EDU or LISTSERV@UAFSYSB.BITNET

     The body of this MAIL message should be one line and contain the
     words:  SUBSCRIBE TOOLB-L your name

     Correspondence to the list should be addressed to TOOLB-L@UAFSYSB.

     TOUCHTON has been created to promote the discussion of the
     specification, installation and maintenance of 'touch-tone' or voice
     response technology.  While the discussions will likely concentrate on
     the application of these systems to campus automated registration
     (Periphonics et al), other uses for these systems are emerging and
     their discussion is certainly encouraged.

     To subscribe to this list, send the following note to LISTSERV@SJSUVM1

THPHYSIO%FRMOP11.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

     Mailing list for accelerating exchanges of information between
     scientists working in the field of thermal physiology, such as
     relevant advices, queries, and ideas.  The list is also a good place
     to ask questions of general interest; stimulating discussion on recent
     results or publications; and to provide an easy and cheap way to
     forward general announcements, such as congresses, new journals,
     administration, relevant news, etc.  This is the job of the list
     moderators.  However, anyone who wishes to use the list for announcing
     interesting scientific events or meetings is invited to do so, or to
     send the information to the moderators, allowing calls for papers,
     bibliographies, and reports of lasting interest; obtaining, if
     possible, the contents pages in electronic format of relevant journals
     (such as J Thermal Biol, Am J Physiol, J Appl Physiol, Eur J Appl
     Physiol, etc.) for publication in THPHYSIO.

     A side-effect of the list will be that any user can easily access the
     E-Mail address of colleagues.  This may be useful for organizing joint
     research projects, or for asking advice concerning specific technical
     problems.

     BitNet users may subscribe by sending the following command to
     LISTSERV@FRMOP11 via interactive message or mail:  SUBscribe THPHYSIO
     Your full name where "Your full name" is your real name, not your

TRDEV-L on LISTSERV@PSUVM.BITNET or LISTSERV@PSUVM.PSU.EDU

     TRDEV-L provides a forum for the exchange of information on the
     training and the development of human resources.  Training is designed
     to improved human work performance on the job, and development
     prepares employees to adjust and grow with the organization.  Training
     and development plays a strategic role in organization performance,
     and human resource professionals have a responsibility to explore
     their field and to expand their knowledge base.  Participation in
     activities such as TRDEV-L assist in accomplishing this task.

     The primary focus of this list is to stimulate research collaboration
     and assistance in training and development for the academic and
     professional communities.  We invite the discussion of policy and
     practice issues, the posting of position announcements,
     pre-publication drafts of manuscripts, and news and reports of
     conferences.

     Because of rapid changes in technology, traditional sources of this
     type of information are no longer adequate.  With this in mind, the
     Institute for Research in Training and Development at Penn State
     University in cooperation with The University Research Council in
     Human Resource Development initiated this network for the ongoing and
     timely exchange of information in this field.  This discussion group,
     managed by the Training and Development Society Graduate Student
     Organization at Penn State, was developed and field-tested through a
     grant from the Technical Foundation of America.

     We hope that you will actively participate in this network.

     You may join the list at any time by sending e-mail to LISTSERV@PSUVM
     or LISTSERV@PSUVM.PSU.EDU and including the following in the BODY of
     the mail (NOT the subject):

     SUBSCRIBE TRDEV-L yourfirstname yourlastname

     Please note that this command must NOT be sent to the list address
     (TRDEV-L@PSUVM) but to the LISTSERV address (LISTSERV@PSUVM).

     Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived.  You can
     obtain a list of the available archive files by sending an "INDEX
     TRDEV-L" command to LISTSERV@PSUVM.  These files can then be retrieved
     by means of a "GET TRDEV-L filetype" command, or using the database
     search facilities of LISTSERV.  Send an "INFO DATABASE" command for
     more information on the latter.

TREK-REVIEW-L on LISTSERV@cornell.edu                    [Last Update 3/93]

     TREK-REVIEW-L exists as a noise-free forum for reviews of Star Trek
     material. This category includes but is not limited to television
     programs, feature films, novels and novelizations, comic books, games
     and parodies of Star Trek.  The list is not rooted in any specific
     generation of Trek.  Original Series, Animated Series, Movie Era, Next
     Generation and Deep Space Nine materials are all valid.

     One way to perceive this list is as a kind of edited electronic
     fanzine.  Where 'rec.arts.startrek.info' is a kind of Trek newspaper,
     containing only hard news and plot summaries, this mailing list exists
     for critical opinion features written by and for the electronic mail
     audience.

     There are three categories of acceptable submission: review, rating,
     and comment.

     'REVIEW' is defined as a CRITICAL essay about either a specific work
     or Star Trek in general.  Posts of the form, 'I thought that TNG's
     latest episode, "Foo on Picard" was the awesomest episode ever' or,
     similarly, 'I thought that DSN's latest episode, "O'Brien Gets Drunk"
     sucked backwards' are not acceptable.

     'RATING' is defined as a graded or numeric rating. If you wish to
     merely register your opinion without critical comment, then you may
     send such a rating to the list address. Ratings collected in this
     manner, as well as copied from reviews, will be posted periodically on
     a per-episode basis.

     'COMMENT' is defined as a CRITICAL response to a review. This is not a
     discussion list; however, CRITICAL responses to reviews sent to the
     list address which the moderator believes to be of general interest
     will be bundled together and published in digest format as a 'letter
     column'.

     SUBMISSIONS should be sent to 'TREK-REVIEW-L@cornell.edu'.  Accepted
     submissions are acknowledged by publication. Rejected submissions will
     be acknowledged by a return letter, explaining why the submission was
     rejected.

     What the list isn't for

     The list is not a discussion list. Neither, however, is it intended to
     displace 'rec.arts.startrek.current' as another home for reviews.
     Rather, it is intended as an alternative access point to critical
     opinion about Star Trek for people who find
     'rec.arts.startrek.current' overwhelming or cannot access it for some
     reason. It is expected that many of the reviews posted to the list
     will also find their way (assumedly at their author's hands) onto
     'r.a.s.current'. That, therefore, is where discussion should take
     place.

     The list is not for press releases or plot summaries without
     commentary. That's why we have 'rec.arts.startrek.info' (thank you,
     Jim!)

     The list is not for the redistribution of commercially published
     reviews, with or without permission. It is for the posting of comments
     for and by members of the various electronic networks that make up or
     exchange mail with The Internet.

     The list is not intended as a replacement for proposals to create a
     'rec.arts.startrek.reviews' newsgroup. Rather, it exists to fill the
     gap some feel such a group would also fill until efforts to create
     such a newsgroup are successful. Neither, however, will that newsgroup
     necessarily mean the end of this list.

UNIX-SW@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

     UNIX-SW is a vehicle for announcing the availablity of new major
     packages of UNIX/'C' language software on the WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL
     repository.  This list will also be used to mail periodic updates of
     the list of all UNIX software held at WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL (probably
     monthly).

     UNIX-SW is not a forum for discussion of this software.  Such
     discussions are more appropriately held with the authors, or in other
     groups.  Rather, we are attempting to make known to the widest
     possible audience the contents of this large repository of
     public-domain software.

     SIMTEL20 is a DEC-20 machine running the TOPS20 operating system,
     located at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.  The machine is a
     host on the Defense Data Network (DDN), and as such, gives users
     located on other hosts the capability of directly transferring this
     software via the FTP (file transfer process) command.

     or LISTSERV@VM.MARIST.EDU

     "Update-Electronic-Music-News" highlights "underground" music,
     independent and major label artists and companies, contains record
     reviews, interviews, perspectives, and a host of other topics that
     differ from issue to issue.  Update is also attempting to close the
     popular music gap, or mass music gap, by bringing to the forefront
     those artists and aspects of the music industry that are struggling to
     make their voice heard.  Update is providing artists and other areas
     of the music industry with an opportunity to have recordings, music
     products, and/or music services presented directly to a large music
     audience.

URBAN-L%TREARN.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

     Mailing list for information exchange, ideas, etc. on the science of
     Urban Planning.

     Yearly archives of the list will be maintained.

     BitNet users may join the list by sending the following command to
     LISTSERV@TREARN via interactive message or e-mail:  SUB urban-l Your
     full name where "Your full name" is your real name, not your login Id.

URBANITES@PSYCHE.MIT.EDU

     The purpose of this mailing list is to discuss and promote
     self-sufficiency in everyday life in many forms.  This includes but is
     not limited to basic needs such as food, shelter, health, and safety.
     A unique aspect of this list, however, unlike many others, is that we
     will concentrate on the city and urban/semi-urbs applications of
     traditional self-sufficiency technology.  Thus, discussions on raising
     fish in a small backyard pool or in a large aquarium instead of in
     cage-culture rafts on a farm pond; raising veggies and some small-tree
     fruits in containers on the patio or under grow-lights at work (a
     ready source of fluorescent fixtures for most of us!) instead of in a
     20 x 40 garden plot "out back".

     Certainly folks in a more suburban setting (lucky them!) will find
     much of the "urbanites" content useful, but the list is here first and
     foremost for those of us out here in the Concrete Jungle, for whatever
     reason.  Some of us, like myself, are here using the city's resources
     to learn before setting off for the country or the 'burbs, some are
     stuck in pay-our-debts jobs here, and some just like the active city
     environment of places like Harvard Square or Pike's Place.  But even
     though we rent our dwellings and have a postage-stamp size yard, or
     none at all, we can still get into doing for ourselves in some of the
     ways our bucolic buddies do.

     Send requests to be added directly to urbanites-request@psyche.mit.edu
     and include "urbanites-request" in your subject line.

UTS-L@YSUB.YSU.EDU
     UTS-L@YSUB (BitNet)

     Mailing list for discussion of Amdahl's UTS/580 implementation of Unix
     and for software running in the UTS environment.  Some potential
     topics for discussion: porting software, integrating with bitnet,
     internet, and servers, requests for help, using UTS-specific features,
     hardware issues, and anything else that's UTS-related.  Discussion
     should be limited to the UTS environment (under VM or native),pso this
     list does not replace info-unix, unix-wiz, aix-l, or any otherpmailing
     list.  Postings not specific to UTS should be posted to one of those
     lists, instead.

     The discussion is not presently moderated, although if message traffic
     warrants, it may be in the future.  All are free to post to the list,
     with the condition that you must be subscribed to the list to post
     anything.  To help keep the noise down to a reasonable level, we would
     appreciate if you would contact your site's UTS system administrator
     (aka "unix guru") for help on your question, before you send it out to
     everyone.

     A monthly notebook of all discussions will be kept online, in files
     named UTS-L LOGYYMM (UTS-L LOG9001, for example) on the Listserv.  To
     retrieve a notebook, send e-mail or an interactive message to Listserv
     with a message text/body of GET UTS-L LOGYYMM.  Listserv database
     services are also available - send INFO DATABASE to the list-server
     for more information.  Notebooks will also be available via anonymous
     FTP to YSUB.YSU.EDU after 1/31/90.  More on this later.  Sorry, we
     don't have news (yet, anyway).

     BitNet users can subscribe by sending the following command to
     LISTSERV@YSUB via interactive message or e-mail:  SUB UTS-L Your full
     name where "Your full name" is your real name, not your login Id.
     Not-BitNet users can join the list by sending the above command as the
     only line in the text/body of an e-mail message to

URANTIAL on LISTSERV%UAFSYSB.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu

     'URANTIAL' is a forum for the discussion of ideas presented in The
     URANTIA Book.  The perspective of the list is holistic.  Contributions
     are welcomed from the full scope of scientific and theological
     perspectives as long as they serve to enhance our understanding of
     ourselves and pertain constructively to the conceptual framework of
     the URANTIA material.  The goal of this list is to utilize The URANTIA
     Book to gain integration of knowledge and consolidation of worldviews
     toward an improved life for all on Earth.

     Please send subscription requests to LISTSERV@UAFSYSB on BITNET, *not*

UUs-L on LISTSERV@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu              [Last Updated June 1992]

     UUs-L is a global meeting place for Unitarian Universalists and anyone
     going our way.  The list's intent is to provide a forum for sharing of
     UU-related information across district and regional boundaries; to
     bring into contact people and ideas who normally would never have met;
     and to foster discussion of functional and structural innovations we
     can make in our organizations and world.

     Electronic conferencing, mail, and the paradigms they encourage are
     something that most members of this list have a growing familiarity
     with.  These are tools which are already having an impact more
     profound than the other major influence on human religion and
     politics; the printing press.  The effects these tools can have on an
     organization are manyfold; better, cheaper, more effective
     communications; improved dynamics for far-flung groups; and insight
     into the processes that make up even non-electronic communications.

     Subscriptions to UUs-L are obtained by sending the following in the
     body of a message to LISTSERV@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu:

     VICTORIA is an electronic conference devoted to the interdisciplinary
     field of Victorian Studies and dedicated to the sharing of information

     and society.  Covering a period even longer than the reign of its
     namesake (say, 1790 to 1914), VICTORIA equally welcomes the
     contributions of students of literature, art, social history, gender
     studies, politics, publishing, intellectual history, or what-have-you.

     For the most passionate devotee of literary theory as well as the most
     hardheaded empiricist, VICTORIA provides that beloved Victorian thing,
     a "cheap luxury," in the shape of a free electronic forum for the
     exchange of research ideas and queries, notices of recent books and
     articles, conference listings, and job announcements, and for lively
     discussion of any issues, large or small, that bear on the study of
     19th-century Britain.

     To subscribe to VICTORIA, simply send an e-mail message to
     LISTSERV@IUBVM (the BITNET address) or LISTSERV@IUBVM.UCS.INDIANA.EDU

VIRUS-L%LEHIIBM1.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

     Virus-L is a forum specifically for the discussion of computer virus
     experiences, protection software, and other virus related topics.  The
     list is currently open to the public and is a non-digest format list.
     Readers who prefer digest format lists should periodically read the
     public back logs of submissions, available from the LEHIIBM1 LISTSERV
     via a GET command (e.g., GET VIRUS-L LOG8806A for the first week of
     activity during June, 1988).  Mail sent to to Virus-L@LEHIIBM1.BITNET
     will automatically be redistributed to everyone on the mailing list.
     By default, you will NOT receive a copy of your own letters.  If you
     wish to, send mail to the LISTSERV saying SET VIRUS-L REPRO

     Archives are available, as is a file called DIRTY DOZEN which lists a
     number of viruses, trojan horses, and pirated programs for the IBM PC.
     All submissions to VIRUS-L are stored in weekly log files which can be
     downloaded by any user on (or off) the mailing list.  There is also a
     small archive of some of the public anti-virus programs which are
     currently available.  This archive, too, can be accessed by any user.
     All of this is handled automatically by the LISTSERV.

     To find out what files are available on the LISTSERV, send mail to
     LISTSERV%LEHIIBM1.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU saying INDEX VIRUS-L Note that
     filenames/extensions are separated by a space, and not by a period.
     Once you've decided which file(s) you want, send mail to LISTSERV
     saying GET filename filetype For example, GET VIRUS-L LOG8804 would
     get the file called VIRUS-L LOG8804 (which happens to be the monthly
     log of all messages sent to VIRUS-L during April, 1988).  Note that,
     starting June 6, 1988, the logs are weekly.  The new file format is
     VIRUS-L LOGyymmx where yy is the year (88, 89, etc.), mm is the month,
     and x is the week (A, B, etc.).  Readers who prefer digest format
     lists should read the weekly logs and sign off of the list itself.

     To subscribe send the following command to LISTSERV@LEHIIBM1
     (non-BitNet users send mail to LISTSERV%LEHIIBM1.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU
     with the command in the message body):  SUB VIRUS-L Your_Full_Name
     where Your_Full_Name is your real name, not your userid.  To
     unsubscribe, send:  SIGNOFF VIRUS-L

     All other requests, problems, questions, etc., should be sent to the
     Coordinator.

VM-UTIL <DYOUNG%TRINITY.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU>

     A list for the discussion and redistribution of useful and interesting
     utilities for use by the VM/SP and CMS operating systems.  There is
     also a FILELIST by the same name which will be used to store some of
     the utilities collected.

     The list is hosted at DEARN, MARIST, TECMTYVM, TREARN, UBVM, UCF1VM,
     and UTARLVM1.  There is also a companion FILELIST available from the
     LISTSERV's at DEARN, MARIST, UBVM, UCF1VM, and UTARLVM1 which contains
     a lot of useful VM- and CMS-related utilities that people have
     contributed.  If anyone is interested in contributing a utility to be
     stored in the FILELIST, they can send a note telling what they wish to
     contribute along with a description of each utility.  Source code is
     prefered.

     To subscribe send the following command to LISTSERV@[one of the above

VMVIRUS on LISTSERV@PCCVM

     After consulting with the folks 'attached' to VIRUS-L and seeing a
     void in the area of centralized information about VM, MVS, and VSE
     viri and worms, I have established a list VMVIRUS at my node.  This
     list is open and public, but as the following text will describe, some
     files will be restricted.  Be aware that a posting to this list will
     automatically be forwarded to VIRUS-L.

     This list has been established to act as a clearing house / archival
     location for comments and information concerning VM viruses and worms.
     The logs are public and your comments well be freely available to the
     network community.  I intend to also store samples of source, object,
     and executable code for examination by selected persons.  Commonly
     these files will only be available to NADs and other selected
     interested parties.  Application may be made for code samples.  Userid
     authenticity WILL BE verified prior to dispersal of infectious
     programs.

     So far the VM community has been spared many of the problems that
     currently plague the PC, MAC and Unix worlds.  Let us hope that it
     remains that way.  This archive is intended as a step in the direction
     to halt the spread of such malicious programming.

     While the name VMVIRUS implies a limitation to the VM environment,
     this list is open to comments by MVS and VSE users also.  I would urge
     VM, MVS, and VSE sites to send samples of infectious code for storage.
     The following rules MUST be adhered to in the transmission of
     potentially harmful programs.

        1. Send notification to myself (SYSMAINT@PCCVM) prior to
           transmission.
        2. De-activate the code if possible
        3. Transmit the code to SECURE@PCCVM
        4. Do not include code in a 'mail-gram'

     This site maintains a 'filter' for known infectious materials, hence
     the required pre-transmission notification.  Let all work together to
     restore the 'clean' computing environment that we used to have and to
     assist in the eradication / prosecution of offenders.

     To subscribe to VMVIRUS send mail or interactive message to
     LISTSERV@PCCVM on BITNET with the TEXT or BODY of the message
     containing the command:  SUB VMVIRUS yourfirstname yourlastname

VPIEJ-L@VTVM1.BITNET VPIEJ-L@VTVM1.CC.VT.EDU

     VPIEJ-L is a discussion list for electronic publishing issues,
     especially those related to Scholarly Electronic Journals.  Topics for
     discussion include SGML, PostScript, and other e-journal formats; as
     well as software and hardware considerations for creation of, storage,
     and access to e-journals.  Publishers, editors, technical staff,
     programmers, librarians, and end-users are welcome to join.

     One goal of the list is to provide better feedback from users to
     creators, so we are very interested in receiving and archival issues.
     This should give those of us involved in publishing an idea as to what
     distribution methods work and how end-users are accessing and using
     these publications.  Current readers of and contributors to VPIEJ-L
     have discussed readability and screen display, copyright, and
     advertising (noncommercial).

     Archives of VPIEJ-L are available.  A listing may be retrieved by
     sending a command INDEX VPIEJ-L in the BODY of e-mail or a message to

WELSH-L on LISTSERV@IRLEARN                              [Last Update 1/93]
     or LISTSERV@IRLEARN.UCD.IE

     The WELSH-L bulletin board aims to foster the amicable discussion of
     questions of the Welsh language, Welsh culture, history, and politics,
     and to offer a forum for speakers and learners of the Welsh language.
     Both Welsh and English may be used.

     Users are encouraged to exchange their opinions in Welsh, if they can,
     and special consideration may be given to Welsh learners expressing
     themselves in Welsh.

     The emphasis will be on Welsh as a living language, and Welsh culture
     as actually lived out in Wales at the present day.  Discussions of
     Celtic myth in general, the relationship between Celtic paganism and
     Anglo-Saxon Wicca, etc.  will probably find a more ready audience on
     the CELTIC-L bulletin board at IRLEARN.UCD.IE.

     If there is an interest in expanding the range of topics to include
     discussion in and about the language and culture of Welsh's close
     sister languages, Breton and Cornish, WELSH-L will be able to serve as
     a forum for that as well.

     Archives of WELSH-L and related files are stored in the WELSH-L
     FILELIST To receive a list of files send the command INDEX WELSH-L to
     LISTSERV@IRLEARN

Y-RIGHTS@SJUVM.BITNET                        [Last Updated 28-January-1992]

     As the title suggests, this list is on the discussion of the rights of
     kids and teenagers (called Y-Rights for "Youth Rights", or
     "Youngster's Rights" or "Why Rights?" -- whichever strikes your
     fancy).  It's a very open list, and everyone is welcome to participate
     on it, whether you are a teacher, a professional, a student, or a kid
     or teenager yourself.

     What do I mean when I say "Children's Rights"?  Well, I don't
     necessarily mean the rights for adults to "protect" children, because
     that "right" seems to be misused and misguided to ends that are,
     oftentimes, tragic, even with the 'best' intentions.  That, of course,
     is open for discussion on this list, and I'm certain that it will come
     up at some point.

     In my ever changing view of rights for those under the `age of
     majority' (which is 18 or 21 in the United States, depending on how
     you view it, and different in other countries), I am looking more for
     changes in our judicial system, educational system, and our society,
     as a whole, to view youth as Human Beings first and foremost, before
     concerning themselves with the `correct manners to treat, mold and
     shape a child', as if s/he is just a ball of clay, and not a human
     being.

     So, with that, I welcome you.  Come to talk, or come to listen.  Speak
     up anytime, even if just to say "Hi, I'm still here...."

     To add yourself to the list, send an Interactive Message (BITNET) or a
     Mail message (any system) to LISTSERV@SJUVM with a single line:

     SUB Y-RIGHTS Firstname Lastname

     This particular LISTSERV takes a minimum of two names, but it can take
     three, four or more (for example, "J.  P. Zelder Hoghorn III" is
     acceptable.  "John" will not work).
