9NOV89-L%UTDALLAS.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list for whoever may attach a meaning to the date of 9.11.1989 (or 
   89-11-09, or 11/9/89).  Unfortunately the people living in the German 
   Democratic Republic will not be able to participate in this discussion, 
   because they are not (yet?) on this network.  The list name reflects the 
   most important event in the recent German history, but it can't and 
   shouldn't be seen isolated from what happened, and is now happening, in 
   Poland, the USSR, and Hungary before.  And yes, dear Joe Techno, all this 
   will influence even such important things as our networks.

   To subscribe, send a message to LISTSERV@UTDALLAS (BitNet) or 
   LISTSERV%UTDALLAS.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU (Internet) with the following 
   command in the body (text) of the message:
      SUB 9NOV89-L your_full_name
   where "your_full_name" is your real name, not your login Id.

ADA-SW@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   A mailing list for those who in accessing and contributing software to the 
   Ada Repository on SIMTEL20; it serves two purposes: to provide an 
   information exchange medium between the repository users and to mail 
   repository submissions to the Coordinator for inclusion in the archives.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   ADA-SW-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.ADA-SW>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   The Ada Repository is divided into several subdirectories.  These 
   directories are organized by topic, and their names and a brief overview of
   their topics are contained in file PD:<ADA.GENERAL>DIRLIST.DOC.

ADVISE-L%CANADA01.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   Unmoderated mailing list intended for discussion among students who work 
   part-time at the various university computer centers.  It is particularly 
   intended for people who work as student advisors or consultants, although 
   others are welcome.  Another use of the list is to get help from others on 
   problems that might be encountered, or to let everyone know about new 
   things such as new file servers, so that everyone can put the network to 
   the best possible use.

   Alternate paths/addresses: The list is served by 5 servers 
   (ADVISE-L@UTORONTO, ADVISE-L@CANADA01, ADVISE-L@NCSUVM, ADVISE-L@UGA, and 
   MD4F@CMUCCVMA) which are peer linked so that anything sent to one will be 
   sent to the other two automatically.  ADVISE-L@NCSUVM is probably the 
   closest server to the CUNYVM ARPANet gateway.

   To subscribe to the list:

      From a VM site on BITNET do:
         TELL LISTSERV at CANADA01 SUBSCRIBE ADVISE-L Your_Full_Name
      where Your_Full_Name is your real name (not your userid).

      From a VMS BITNET site use the SEND/REMOTE command.

      If you are at a site not on bitnet or where you cannot send interactive 
      messages you can send a message to 
      LISTSERV%CANADA01.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU where the first non-header line
      consists of:
         SUBSCRIBE ADVISE-L Your_Full_Name

   Please refer any questions to the Coordinator.

AGNOSTICA@PROOF.ERGO.CS.CMU.EDU

   Mailing list for doubters.  Has a novel ground rule to try to encourage 
   intelligent discussion:

   Messages should be about "useful" things, not Truth.  A statement is useful
   if it is about something that a person or group of people could at least 
   hypothetically do and get some effect (whether subjective or objective), 
   and then post a description of the effect back to this mailing list.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to agnostica-request@PROOF.ERGO.CS.CMU.EDU.

ALLMUSIC%AUVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list is dedicated to the discussion of all forms of music, in all 
   its aspects.  It's founding is based on the understanding that most people 
   who listen to and enjoy music do so from a variety of standpoints, and that
   a general, unlimited forum is desirable for both the integration and 
   expansion of musical ideas, techniques, and understanding.  Therefore, all 
   topics having to do with music are welcome, including but not limited to: 
   composition, performance, recording; research, critique, inquiry, advocacy,
   instrument design, ethnomusicology, psychacoustics, orchestration, jazz, 
   classical, funk, plainchant, and anything else you can think of.  If a 
   topic is running that you have something to say about, or to question, jump
   in.  If you have something entirely different in mind, start up another 
   thread.  Music is universal.  With the advent of electronic communication, 
   so are we.

   To be added to or deleted from the list, send mail to the Coordinator.

AMETHYST-USERS@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   This list is intended for people who use Amethyst, a software package of 
   CP/M-80 programs: MINCE (an ersatz EMACS) and SCRIBBLE (an ersatz SCRIBE).

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   AMETHYST-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.AMETHYST-USERS>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to AMETHYST-USERS-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

amnesty@VMS.CIS.PITT.EDU
AMNESTY%JHUVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list to distribute Amnesty International's urgent action appeals, 
   usually one per month.  They are 1 or 2-page summaries of a specific case 
   of human rights abuse, such as a small group of people who have been 
   arrested without reason, or are being held secretly, or tortured, etc. They
   give the prisoners' names, why they were arrested, who to write to, and 
   what they suggest you say.  Amnesty International is concerned with human 
   rights, not just amnesty.  Sometimes they ask members to write letters 
   requesting not freedom, but better or more just treatment.  You don't have 
   to be a member of, or endorse, Amnesty International to receive this list. 
   Additional discussion or information from other organizations may be 
   distributed.

   movement".  Consumers and researches alike are facing new questions 
   concerning the human animals' treatment of the rest of the animal kingdom. 
   The purpose of this list is to provide students, researchers, and 
   activists, a forum for discussing issues like:

      Animal Rights                   Animal Liberation
      Consumer Product Testing        Cruelty-free products
      Vivasection/Dissection          Medical Testing

ANSAXNET <U47C2@WVNVM.WVNET.EDU>

   ANSAXNET is a SIG (Special Interest Group) for scholars of the culture and 
   history of England before 1100 C.E.   Scholars interested in the later 
   English Middle Ages and those interested in the early Medieval period 
   throughout Europe are also encouraged to join the list.  Members receive a 
   directory of all our members in order to facilitate telecommunications, and
   a monthly electronic report to which they are encouraged to contribute 
   announcements and information.  This report often provides members with new
   information about the use of computers in some aspect of their disciplines,
   as well as news of more conventional developments in the field.  We also 
   have projects underway to encode databases which members may use in their 
   own work.  To this end, we are now working on the details of distributing 
   to the membership a database of all manuscripts written or owned in England
   before 1100.  We would be glad to add your name to our directory and thus 
   to make you a member of ANSAXNET.  Membership is free to everyone with 
   access to a BITNET node.

   Anyone who wants to be a member of ANSAXNET should send e-mail to the 
   Coordinator, including a conventional mailing address and some information 
   about your particular interests in early medieval cultural studies.

ARPANET-BBOARDS@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU
ARPANET-BBOARDS@LCS.MIT.EDU

   Redistribution address for all known BBoards on the ARPANET.  The 
   guidelines for postings are somewhat loose.  The ostensible purpose of the 
   list is to distribute: (a) emergency notices ("Southern California just 
   slid into the Pacific, machines at ISI and UCSD will be down for a few 
   days"), and (b) notices of "academic interest", such as seminar and 
   symposium announcements.  Advertisements and for-profit notices are not 
   appropriate (the DoD would get upset, among other considerations).  A 
   touchy borderline case is job offerings.  The practice has been to accept 
   postings from universities (the research community) and the research 
   oriented military installations (the people paying for our hardware) but to
   refuse postings from private companies.  The (shaky) rationale behind this 
   is that university and military job offerings are "research opportunities" 
   as opposed to for-profit advertisements (ie, joining the army or a 
   university is not the way to get rich).

   Anyone is welcome to redistribute Arpanet-BBoards; it takes some of the 
   (considerable) load off of MC's mailer.  But please don't do it without 
   sending a message to the -Request address first.

   There are Archive copies of every message ever sent to the list but no 
   guarantee is made that they will be online or available at any particular 
   time.  The current archive file, such as it is, can be found as 
   "COMAIL;BBOARD ARCHIV" on MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

ASSMPC-L%USACHVM1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list for issues related to the PC Assembly languages (Intel 
   8086/88/286/386/...).  There is an initial programming goal that the 
   managers of this list wish to accomplish:

      We are inviting all users to assist in the coding of projects.  For 
      instance, our first task will be a Resident Program Manager.  We will 
      use Turbo Assembler or MacroAssembler to develop the applications.

      A second project will be an AV package to viruses, we already have 
      programs for Jerusalem and Brain, these could be help for it.

   The users of this list will receive mail with code contributions and 
   discussions, and eventually the program source listing finished with the 
   help of the participants.  Then, the list will propose a new project to 
   work on.  Any and all code contributions, ideas, and anything else that 
   will help in achieving this opening goal will be appreciated, discussed, 
   reported and acknowledged for the list.

   BitNet users can subscribe non-interactively by sending a message or mail 
   to LISTSERV@USACHVM1.BITNET with the text/body of the message being:
      SUB ASSMPC-L your_full_name

AVIATION@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU

   Aviation discusses topics of interest to pilots, including training 
   systems, laws affecting availability or usability  of airports, planes, and
   procedures, characteristics of aircraft and avionic products, comments on 
   commercial aviation, such as safety and convenience issues, occasional 
   advertisements for fly-ins or similar private pilot activities, historical 
   notes, whatever else the readership wants.  Aviation serves as an Internet 
   gateway for the rec.aviation discussion on usenet.  It is distributed in 
   the form of a daily digest.

   Due to disk space limitations, archives are only maintained for the 
   previous few weeks of digests.  They are maintained on the host 
   MC.LCS.MIT.EDU in files named:
      AVIATN;DIGEST <number>
   Where <number> is the issue number of the digest.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to AVIATION-REQUEST@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

AVIATION-THEORY@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU
aviation-theory-in@mc.lcs.mit.edu  (USENET)

   Mailing list dedicated to the more theoretical side of aerospace 
   engineering.  The intent is to conduct discussions on aerospace technology;
   also calls for papers, anouncements for seminars, etc., can be sent to the 
   list.  Although the list has its origin in the AVIATION digest, subjects 
   related to aviation theory, like spaceflight technology, may be discussed 
   as well.  Topics open for discussion are:

      Calls for papers         Aerodynamics            Aircraft structures
      Seminar anouncements     Flight mechanics        Aircraft materials
      Books to be published    Stability and Control   and others...

   A mailing list for INTERNET and BITNET has been created already and we are 
   looking for someone who would like to create the USENET group, so we can 
   create digests from those messages.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to aviation-theory-request@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.

        Baltic Republics news and development list

   BALT-L is an online forum devoted to communications to, and about,
   the Baltic Republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. It aims to
   further networking with those countries, in two senses of that word:
   the technical one of establishing the basic links to permit electronic
   communications; and the softer definition of a network of people
   building up people-to-people contacts and working together on matters
   of common interest. A core aim of this list is to foster practical
   projects.

   Subscription to this list is welcomed from anyone with skills or interests
   relevant to the Baltics, or who just wants to know whats going on.

    We hope in particular to bring together

   Participants living in the Baltic Republics.
   People around the world with origins in the Baltic Republics,
   or who have connections with those countries.  Anyone with
   technical skills in electronic networking who may want to contribute
   to developing electronic links to the Baltic Republics.  Anyone
   needing to research on developments in the Baltics.  Anyone around
   the world with a need to contact, visit and/or work with College staff
   or students living and working in Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia.

   Although English is likely to be the lingua franca, ALL languages of
   communication are WELCOME: but especially in Lithuanian, Latvian or
   Estonian.


   To subscribe, send the following command to
   LISTSERV@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU via mail or interactive message:

           SUB BALT-L your full name

BIO-NAUT%IRLEARN.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU
BIO-NAUT on LISTSERV@IRLEARN.BITNET

   A mailing list for BIONAUTS has been established at IRLEARN
   The main purpose of the list is to facilitate communications
   between life scientists. This list will have three main functions.

   1) It can be used to ask questions about networking addresses
      of scientists in the biological life sciences.
      e.g. I need to get in contact with some one at EMBL
           who should I send mail to.

       **** SOMEONE OUT THERE KNOWS THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION ***

   2) If you have small databases of E-mail addresses related to your
      particular field of interest they can be uploaded onto BIO-NAUT
      for the benefit of others. Special interst groups welcome.
      e.g. Numerical taxonomists, Culture Collections, etc.

       ****  INSTANT HIGH PROFILE FOR YOUR GROUP  ****

   3) If you subscribe you will be asked to send ONE MESSAGE to
      BIO-NAUT which gives a brief outline of who you are and your
      main interests. Instructions on the format of this MESSAGE
      will be sent to all subscribers individually.

      **** ADD YOUR NAME TO WHO'S WHO OF BIOLOGICAL NETWORKING ****

   To subscribe to the BIOSCI Bionauts distribution service
   at IRLEARN, send the following command as one line in the body
   of a mail message to, LISTSERV@IRLEARN.BITNET
                         ========
   saying just

   SUBSCRIBE BIO-NAUT forename surname

   Those of you who are directly on EARN or BITNET can also subscribe
   with an interactive message, e.g.

     TELL LISTSERV AT IRLEARN SUB BIO-NAUT forename surname
     (on an IBM running VM/CMS)
   or
     SEND LISTSERV@IRLEARN SUB BIO-NAUT forename surname
     (on a VAX running VMS)

   When you have done that, you will get an acknowledgement that  you
   now belong to the distribution list. Once subscribed, you can send
   mail messages to

     BIO-NAUT@IRLEARN.BITNET

   and they will be AUTOMATICALLY redistributed to all the other
   subscribers. They (and you) can then reply to that address and
   everyone will see the answers.

    Remember

     The SUB command for subscribing goes to LISTSERV@IRLEARN.BITNET
     (LISTSERV%IRLEARN.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU for Internet users)

   (or even about problems with other software that scientists might use in 
   the course of their work such as word processors or communications 
   software).

   To subscribe to this newsgroup, please send your subscription request to

BIOMED-L%NDSUVM1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   Mailing list for discussion on the topic of Biomedical Ethics.  Since the 
   field of medicine and medical technology are rapidly changing and the field
   is so broad, it is difficult to have clearly delineated rules as to what 
   should and should not be discussed, but possible topics might include:
      Paternalism             Fetal Cell Transplant
      The Right to Die        AIDS
      Suicide                 Patient Autonomy
      Abortion                Drug Legalization
      Euthanasia              Respirator Withdrawal
      Transplants             Allocation of scarce resources
   and many others too numerous to list here.  The discussions may be ethical,
   philosophical, religious, political, social or even, in some cases, 
   personal.  Open discussion, disagreement, and dissent is encouraged.  Open 
   flames are most certainly *not*.

   To subscribe to BIOMED-L send the following command to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1:

BIOSPH-L%UBVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   This list replaces the now defunct list OZONE@ICNUCEVM.  The new name 
   reflects better the topics discussed.  Anything relating to the biosphere, 
   pollution, CO-2 effect, ecology, habitats, climate, etc., can be discussed.
    Basically anything that exerts an influence of some kind or another on the
   BioSphere.

   New archives will be stored in a monthly notebook.  Archives from the old 
   Ozone List will eventually be transferred to the BIOSPH-L site.  Even 
   though there is no longer a connection to the owners of the old list, the 
   idea is to continue on from the topics that were being discussed up to when
   it went dead.

   To subscribe send the following command to LISTSERV@UBVM.BITNET:
      SUBSCRIBE BIOSPH-L Your_full_name
   To leave or signoff the list send:

   languages may be a requirement when Chinese data base software gets more 
   popular.  The postings to this group may include:

   societies to own (and to be responsible for) files which would be 
   maintained by the SBCCVM file server.  Any CLASS-L subscriber can retrieve 
   these files by issuing appropriate LISTSERV commands.  Alternatively, a 
   CLASS-L subscriber can arrange to receive automatically copies (or 
   announcements) of files updated by particular societies.  We hope officials
   of the Member Societies of the International Federation of Classification 
   Societies will eventually participate in this project as file owners.  
   Officials from other societies (e.g. Psychometric Society, Willi Hennig 
   Society, International Association of Pattern Recognition Societies) may 
   also be interested in participating.

   To subscribe to CLASS-L, send the command:
      SUB CLASS-L your_full_name
   to LISTSERV@SBCCVM  e.g.  SUB CLASS-L "William H. E. Day"

    Description of List


                          PURPOSE

   DANCE-L was initiated by Leo van der Heijden in May 1990 to
   motivate all the peoples of the world to get to know and to
   appreciate each other's dances and to stimulate the use of
   computers in this field of human activities.

   Dance should unite!

                        GROUPS AIMED AT

   This list hopes to contribute to a better contact between
  dancers, dancing masters, choreographers, dance documentalists,
  choreologists, organizers of folkloristic festivals and
  performances, dance and folklore organizations, publishers of
  dance books, records, videotapes.

  The information in this list should concentrate on: addresses
  of the above-mentioned groups, terminology, bibliographies,
  discographies, facts on historic and social backgrounds of
  folkdance, dance and choreography descriptions, costumes,
  announcements and reports of performances and festivals.

                        SPECIAL PROJECTS

   The list participants will be stimulated to actively engage and
   share responsibility in a number of projects:

   * to establish an INTERNATIONAL FOLKDANCE DATABASE, by using a
   standard exchange record format, with the dance name as the
   main entry.

   * to establish a FOLKDANCE DOCUMENTATION DATABASE, also by
   using a standard exchange record format, with book or article
   title as the main entry.

   * to establish a MULTILINGUAL FOLKDANCE TERMINOLOGY DATABASE,also
   by using a standard exchange record format, with the
   English term as the main entry.

   on topics such as:  transaction processing, system implementation on 
   networks, concurrency, library construction, modular design, function 
   design, etc.  All the above topics will be treated under the light of the 
   dBase language, so the focus will be on implementing algorithms using this 
   language.

EBCBBUL%HDETUD1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

   EBCBBUL is short for EBCB BULletin board, a facet of the European Bank of 
   Computer Programs in Biotechnology (EBCB).  EBCB is a non-profit making 
   organization mainly funded by the European Community (EC).  The main goal 
   of EBCB is to stimulate and facilitate the use of computers in 
   biotechnological training and research in Europe. EBCBBUL will not only 
   promote user/user communication, but will also provide users with up to 
   date information (e.g. about courses/congresses).

   Items accepted for the bulletin board will be distributed via electronic 
   mail (e-mail) to all participants and will also be retained for future 
   reference.

   EBCBBUL is public, and anyone with access to EARN can participate.  Before 
   you gain access to EBCBBUL through EARN or a related system, however, you 
   must issue one of the following commands:

      For EARN nodes operating with VM/CMS systems type the following:
         TELL LISTSERV AT HDETUD1 SUBSCRIBE EBCBBUL (followed by your name)

      For EARN nodes operating with VAX/VMS systems type the following:
         SEND LISTSERV @ HDETUD1 SUBSCRIBE EBCBBUL (followed by your name)

      On other systems send mail to LISTSERV@HDETUD1 (or 
      LISTSERV@HDETUD1.TUDELFT.NL, or for Internet users 
      LISTSERV%HDETUD1.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU) with the body/text of the mail 
      containing the command:
         SUB EBCBBUL yourfirstname yourlastname

      As soon as your request for access has been accepted, you will receive, 
      by e-mail, confirmation of this fact.  Because of limitations imposed by
      e-mail (traffic volume etc.) this may take several hours.  After that 
      you will be able to search EBCBBUL using LDBASE or LSVTALK (these are 
      programmes, available within the EARN node, that make interactive 
      searching possible).

   Esperanto.  Discussions about the language itself, the Esperanto movement, 
   publications, and news are encouraged.  Of course, discussion *in* 
   Esperanto is especially encouraged, although English translations may be 
   advisable when the material is of interest to beginners or 
   non-Esperantists.

   This list is identical to the USENET mailing list `mail.esperanto'.  The 
   forwarding addresses were installed on LLL-CRG by Andy Beals; ESPERANTO 
   forwards to the "real" mail.esperanto address trwrb!trwspp!spp2!esperanto

ETHICS-L%MARIST.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   Discussions of ethics in computing usually generate more heat than light.  
   This list could do a lot toward generating more light if we do more than 
   trade war stories and opinions of the "I'm right and you're NOT" variety.  
   Of course we can't get any work done without some war stories, since they 
   furnish food for thought.  But we shouldn't stop there.  Given our 
   experiences, we ought to be able to delineate the basic issues and hot 
   areas in computer ethics.  Some current ones have to do with:

      - ownership of information (both data and program files)
      - what happens when systems programs fail? Is anyone responsible for
        damage done?  Or is the responsibility only for the necessary fix?
      - responsibility for program failures (Is the company responsible?
        the programmer? the lead programmer? the project manager?) Who's
        responsible for the "fix"?
      - how much privacy is reasonable (there are all kinds of levels here;
        data bases, systems, LANs, networks, etc.)

   BitNet users can add themselves to the list by issuing the following 
   command to LISTSERV@MARIST.BITNET:
      SUBSCRIBE ETHICS-L your_full_name
   where your_full_name is your real name (not your userid).
   BitNet users can unsubscribe with the command:
      UNSUBSCRIBE ETHICS-L

   All other requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, 
   questions, etc., should be sent to the Moderators.

EVOLUTION@KESTREL.ARPA

   This direct-distribution mailing list is organized to discuss consequences 
   of the theory of evolution, with emphasis on mathematics, on computer 
   simulations, and on literature.  While creationists in this group are 
   expected to be few in number, and while they may not reasonably expect to 
   be taken seriously unless they can introduce radically better evidence than
   creationists have in the past, we have no agreement to limit discussion of 
   contraversal topics.  The coordinator assumes no responsibility for 
   opinions expressed in the group or for misuse.

   Archives are available only upon request to EVOLUTION-REQUEST@KESTREL.ARPA.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

FWAKE-L%IRLEARN.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   A forum for a broad discussion about James Joyce's FINNEGANS WAKE.  The 
   James Joyce Institute of Ireland's Finnegans Wake Study Group has been 
   doing their best to get the jokes in Finnegans Wake for the past decade or 
   so.  The Study Group thinks it is time for such groups to pool their 
   findings.

   There are plans to start a second associated service to share page-by-page,
   line-by-line notes to the text of FINNEGANS WAKE in a fixed format 
   analogous to that of Roland McHugh's ANNOTATIONS.  The Coordinator is 
   working on a program to vet the mail from such a service.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from the mailing list, or to have

game-design@cs.odu.edu

   The game-design mailing list is an unmoderated, but administrated
   mailing list for the discussion of most topics related to creating and
   playing games with primary emphasis on the design of games.  This is
   not a list for learning how to play arcade games or to duplicate the
   discussions of usenet news groups, but rather, this is a list to learn
   and discuss some methods on how to design games.

   This list is being provided as an alternative source of discussion
   to the news group rec.games.* and others like it.  A parallel facet of
   this is that this list is available for those who do not have access
   to usenet news or those who use compuserve, genie, mci mail, bitnet,
   etc.  If you can get mail to xanth.cs.odu.edu and xanth.cs.odu.edu can
   get mail back to you, then if this subject interests you and you are
   willing to receive lots of mail :) please feel free to subscribe as
   described below.

   There are no restrictions on subject material other than it should
   connected with games in some manner with stress on designing games.
   The mail should also be in accordance with the general atmosphere of
   the Internet (No flame wars, no advertising, no source code... etc)

   Topics likely to be discussed in the mailing list are:

        RPG
	Dice
        FRPG
        Rules
        Shareware
        Strategies
        Philosophy
        Board Games
        Artificial Intelligence
        General Game Design Techniques
        Random Numbers and their creation.
        Basic Creator and Game Player Psychology.
        Creating new games from ``materials'' provided.
        Computer Games, Methods, Styles and Programming.
        

   The list is administrated by: Scott D. Yelich <scott@cs.odu.edu>.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list should be sent to:
	game-design-request@[xanth.]cs.odu.edu          (Internet)
	game-design-request@cs.odu.edu                  (Bitnet)

	>INTERNET:game-design-request@cs.odu.edu        (CompuServe)

   Once added to the list, mail can be sent to all recipients at once by
   sending mail addressed the same as above, except without the ``-request''.

   The current mail system is a type of ``exploding'' where there mail
   addressed to <game-design@cs.odu.edu> is simply re-addressed and then
   resent to all of the current recipients.

   Archives of messages posted to this list are available via anonymous
   ftp from xanth.cs.odu.edu in the directory game-design.  Further materials

GEODESIC%UBVM.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU

   This list is for the discussion of Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller, his works 
   and his philosophies on Life, the Universe, and Everything (NOT The Douglas
   Adams book!).  For those of you who don't know, Bucky is the person who 
   invented the Geodesic Dome, which is what we all played on as children in 
   the playground (the domes with all the triangles, remember?).  Another 
   example of geodesic architecture is the giant white sphere at Disney 
   World's "Epcot Center".  Of course, Bucky did a LOT more than just invent 
   the Geodesic Dome! He invented other means of housing people cheaply, 
   efficiently, COMFORTABLY, and basically anywhere in the world! (Yes, even 
   ON the oceans!) So if you're interested in discussing Bucky, learning more 
   about him, or finding out about 8500 ft. high pyramidal cities that float 
   in the ocean and house 1,000,000 people comfortably (2000 sq ft. apartments
   with 1000 sq ft. extra patio/garden space), or 1+ mile diameter spherical 
   cities that FLOAT IN THE AIR *WITHOUT POWER*, then sign up on the list!

   To sign up, send a mail message to LISTSERV%UBVM.BITNET@MITVMA.MIT.EDU with
   the line
      SUBSCRIBE GEODESIC Your Real Name
   as the body of the letter.

GO-L%SMCVAX.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU
GO-L on MAILSERV@SMCVAX


    GO-L, a new list for game players interested in the game of GO is now
    available for public use. The list is sponsored by Saint Michael's College
    in Winooski, Vermont.  The list is intended to serve as a discussion point
    for GO-related topics, and as a meeting place for EMAIL games between
    list members.

    In contrast to the majority of BITNET lists, this one is supported by a 
    DEC uVAX 3400 running the MAILSERV program for VAX/VMS.  Consequently, 
    commands used to access the list are slightly different than those used 
    by LISTSERV. MAILSERV supports the following commands, among others:

     HELP      -  Ask for the HELP file.
     SUBSCRIBE -  Subscribe to a list.
     LISTS     -  List all mailing lists for a MAILSERVer.

     MAILSERV accepts only mail messages; not interactive SENDs or TELLs.  
     Be sure to send only a mail message with your commands in the body of 
     the message. Don't type any other text into the message; it won't work!

      As an example, to subscribe to the GO-L list, send a mail message to

      MAILSERV%SMCVAX.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU

      and in the body of the message just put the command

      SUBSCRIBE GO-L

      Notice that you don't need to give a subscription name; MAILSERV gets it
      From your address.
List owner: <GOODWIN%SMCVAX.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU>

   can join by sending the SUB command with your name.
      For example, SEND LISTSERV@CLVM SUB GOULDBUG Jon Doe
   To be removed from the list, SEND LISTSERV@CLVM SIGNOFF.
   To make contributions to the list, BitNet subscribers should send mail to 
   the ARPANet list name, NOT to the BITNET list name.

HUMAN-NETS@RED.RUTGERS.EDU

   Mailing list originally consisting of the combined memberships of 
   INFO-PCNET, HOME-SAT, and TELETEXT mailing lists.  Human-Nets has discussed
   many topics, all of them related in some way to the theme of a world-wide 
   computer and telecommunications network usually called WorldNet.  The 
   topics have ranged very widely, from something like tutorials, to state of 
   the art discussions, to rampant speculation about technology and its 
   impact.  The list is extremely large, making it necessary to batch messages
   sent to the list and distributing them once each day during off peak 
   periods to avoid overloading the system.

   The permanent archives contain all of the material distributed to the list.
   Due to size, this archive is broken down into several different files, 
   stored in reverse temporal order.  The files are currently stored on 
   ARPANet host RU-BLUE in files RHYTHM:<PLEASANT.HUMAN-NETS>HUMNET.* (where 
   "*" is a wild-card).

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to HUMAN-NETS-REQUEST@ARAMIS.RUTGERS.EDU.

   Moderator: Charles McGrew <MCGREW@RED.RUTGERS.EDU>

HUMANIST%UTOREPAS.BITNET@CORNELLC.CCS.CORNELL.EDU

   Discussion of the BBoard package.  BBoard is a VMS utility to link mail, 
   delivered by Jnet, and VAX Notes, an electronic conferencing system from 
   Digital Equipment Corp.  BBoard's primary purpose is to reduce the number 
   of LISTSERV or mailing list subscribers at a node so that only one user 
   (BBOARD) is subscribed.  The messages from each mailing list will then be 
   posted in a separate Notes conference.

   There is no automated archive retrieval facility.  However, requests for 
   archived material may be sent to the I-BBReq address below.

   Requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

INFO-1100@TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU

   This discussion list focuses on the Xerox/Envos Lisp environment and the 
   associated protocols.  Its purpose is to stimulate communication and 
   sharing between computer science research groups that use or are interested
   in the environment.  The list may be used for messages such as 
   announcements of available lispusers packages or for queries such as "Does 
   anybody know of a PUP file server implementation for the Sinclair ZX-80?" 
   or to warn others of Interlisp-D and Medley bugs and/or suggest workarounds
   or to solicit help or discussion.

   Xerox PARC, SIS, and Envos people are included in the distribution to 
   facilitate communication about new developments, bugs, performance issues, 
   etc..  Additionally, Info-1100 is automatically forwarded to 
   AISupport.pasa@Xerox.com, where bugs are noted and acted upon if 
   appropriate.  Xerox AIS and Envos employees will not respond in Info-1100 
   unless the reply is of general interest or silence would mislead the 
   readership.  This mailing list is also distributed as the usenet newsgroup 
   comp.sys.xerox.

   A historical note describing the name:  The Lisp environment was originally
   implemented on Xerox' 1100-series workstations, and the user base is 
   primarily still on 1108's, 1109's, and 1186's.

   Archives of messages are kept on SUMEX-AIM in directory <BBOARD> in files:

INFO-68K@BERKELEY.EDU

   Mailing list for users of OS's capable of running on small 68000 systems, 
   primarly CP/M-68K.  Related systems (OS/9-68K, etc.) and topics welcome.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 68K-ARCHIV.TXT. 
   The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.68K>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,

Info-Andrew@ANDREW.CMU.EDU

   An informal mailing list intended for general discussion by recipients of 
   the Andrew distribution (and implementors of Andrew).  Andrew, a joint 
   project of Carnegie Mellon University & IBM, is a prototype computing 
   environment for academic and research use under the UNIX operating system. 
   There are four main parts to Andrew:

      - The Andrew File System (AFS), a large-scale distributed central
        file system.
      - The Andrew Toolkit (ATK), a toolkit for building complex graphical
        user interface programs in a window-manager independent way
        (currently runs on X11 and the old Andrew window manager)
      - The Andrew Message System (AMS), a multi-media mail and bulletin
        board system compatible with non-multi-media systems
      - The Andrew application programs, a suite of programs that use the
        ATK to provide various useful features.

   Topics can include (but are not limited to):

      - hints about using/building Andrew
      - discussions about desired features, changes, etc.
      - comments about the Andrew distribution (e.g., "it stinks", "it's
        great")
      - questions about the availability/existence of other parts of Andrew

   The mailing list is available in both Andrew multi-media format (if you 
   have the AMS up and running) and plain-text format.  By default you will be
   sent plain-text versions of the posts, but you can request a change in 
   which version you receive by sending mail to the -Request address.  When 
   sending a message to this list, you should feel free to include any 
   multi-media images (rasters, animations, etc.) which might help to express 
   you question, comment, etc.  Such images will automatically be stripped out
   and replaced by "A picture appeared here" before being redistributed to the
   plain-text recipients.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to Info-Andrew-Request@ANDREW.CMU.EDU.  NOTE: All 
   subscription requests will also be added to the Info-Andrew-Bugs 
   distribution list unless specifically requested not to.

   Coordinator: Adam Stoller <ghoti+@ANDREW.CMU.EDU>

Info-Andrew-Bugs@ANDREW.CMU.EDU

   Mailing list for reporting bugs/problems with the Andrew distribution.  
   (See Info-Andrew entry for more detailed description on what "Andrew" is). 
   Official responses to queries and bug reports will be posted to this 
   mailing list.  Topics include:

      - problems discovered in building the distribution
      - problems discovered in running parts of the distribution
      - questions about difficulties encountered (even if you're not sure
        they're bugs)

   When sending a message to this list, you should feel free to include any 
   multi-media images (rasters, animations, etc.), that might help to clarify 
   a bug report.  Such images will automatically be stripped out and replaced 
   by "A picture appeared here" before being redistributed to the plain-text 
   recipients.

   The list will be moderated, so that all bugs can be tracked and referenced 
   with patch files.  We expect that posts will go out to the subscribers 
   about once a week, summarizing those reports which have been fixed and 
   those still being looked into.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to Info-Andrew-Bugs-Request@ANDREW.CMU.EDU.  NOTE: All
   subscription requests will also be added to the Info-Andrew distribution 
   list unless specifically requested not to.

INFO-APPLE@BRL.MIL

   APPLE II series user's mailing list.

   Mail archives are kept on host WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL as TOPS20 mail files 
   named yymm.n-TXT, where n starts with one and increments by one into 
   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   APPLE-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.APPLE>
   Archive files are available via ANONYMOUS FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL 
   for those with TCP/IP access to the Internet.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to Info-Apple-Request@BRL.MIL.

   INFO-APP@NDSUVM1 is the BITNET/NetNorth/EARN Redistribution for the ARPANET
   list.  BITNET, EARN, or NetNorth subscribers can join by sending the SUB 
   command with your name; for example:
       SEND LISTSERV@NDSUVM1    SUB INFO-APP Jon Doe

   To be removed from the list,
       SEND LISTSERV@NDSUVM1    SIGNOFF INFO-APP
   or  TELL LISTSERV AT NDSUVM1 SIGNOFF INFO-APP
   To MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS to the list, BitNet, EARN, and Netnorth users should

INFO-ATARI <INFO-ATARI8@NAUCSE.CSE.NAU.EDU>
           <INFO-ATARI16@NAUCSE.CSE.NAU.EDU>

   Discussions of 8- and 16-bit Atari computers and related topics.  
   Commercial messages and advertisements are not permitted.

      LISTSERV provides access to files for everyone who can send mail, 
      independent of their location.  On Bitnet messages should be sent to 
      your nearest LISTSERV (the one from which you receive the info-atari 
      digests); if your address is not on Bitnet, an address for file servers 
      is given below.  All mail sent to LISTSERV contains command lines.  
      LISTSERV will respond by return mail.  No subject is necessary in such 
      mail.  For more information send the command
         INFO

         The list_name for 16-bit Ataris is INFO-A16.  The list_name for 8-bit
         Ataris is INFO-A8.  These list names are used by Bitnet addressees 
         for subscribing and unsubscribing and by everyone for obtaining back 
         copies of news digests.  The list_names for programs stored in the 
         archives are PROG-A16 and PROG-A8.

         You can obtain copies of files from LISTSERV by sending a message in 
         the specified format.  To obtain a list of files in the file server, 
         the command is
            INDEX list_name
         The command to obtain a specific file is
            GET list_name file_name
         for example, GET INFO-A16 87-00076
         If you want to learn more, send the message
           HELP

         If you are on Bitnet you may add or remove yourself from the 
         distribution list.  The command to join the list is
            SUBSCRIBE list_name User_name
         The command to remove yourself from the list is
            UNSUBSCRIBE list_name

         If you are on ARPAnet (or gatewayed to it), your mail concerning 
         16-bit Atari information should be addressed to 
         LISTSERV%CANADA01.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU.  Mail concerning 8-bit 
         Atari information should be addressed to 
         LISTSERV%TCSVM.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU.

   Administrative messages should be sent to 
   info-atari8-request@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU or 
   info-atari16-request@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU.

INFO-DSEE@APOLLO.COM

   Discussion of DSEE, a software engineering environment from Apollo in 
   wide-spread use by tens of thousands of programmers, on projects up to 
   5,000,000 lines of code.

   DSEE elegantly and efficiently solves many common problems -- how to work 
   on multiple versions of a program at a time, how to tell when someone has 
   made a change you need to know about, how to develop software for multiple 
   target machines, how to KNOW the right version of each source file was 
   used, etc.

   If all this sounds like hype, join the mailing list, and listen to users.

   At least initially, the list will not be moderated or digested; if the 
   volume is sufficient, this may change.  Mail to the list will be archived 
   in some public place that will be announced at a later date.

info-frame@AEROSPACE.AERO.ORG

   Mailing list for System Frameworks.  This group is designed to provide 
   information for software tool developers that are responsible for 
   integrating heterogenous software products.  This can include in-house and 
   vendor supplied.  Usually, the integration of the products is designed to 
   provide an environment that makes using the tools easier.  The basic issue 
   is to build a `framework' around the tools that provides a common and 
   consistent view of the system.  The framework is not limited to homogeneous
   environments, but also can span heterogeneous systems.  Companies like EDA 
   and government sponsored projects like EIS are trying to tackle this 
   problem.  This group can be viewed as a forum for users and developers to 
   voice their opinions on this subject.  Frameworks are common in the area of
   CAD/CAE, CASE and office automation; but they are not limited to only these
   areas.  Topics open for discussion are:

      Tool encapsulation    Data Management             Network Computing
      User Interface        Data Transfer Languages     Tool Portability
      Process Control/Flow  Object Programming          Anything Else

INFO-FUTURES@ENCORE.COM
...{bu-cs,decvax,necntc,talcott}!encore!info-futures (UUCP)

   Digest to provide a speculative forum for analyzing current and likely 
   events in technology as they will affect our near future in computing and 
   related areas.  In broad terms, topics of interest include developments in 
   both computing research and industry which are likely to affect our 
   decision making, particularly decisions we are probably grappling with 
   right this minute.  Technologies can change so rapidly that simply 
   forecasting for needs within any organization one or two years in advance 
   can be extremely difficult, frequently we are forced to provide foundations
   that effectively lock us into a technology for longer periods of time. It 
   is hoped the information this list provides can help both the practitioner 
   and researcher determine where best to expend resources.

Info-IBMPC@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

   Info-IBMPC is a forum for technical discussion of the IBM Personal Computer
   and compatible micro-computers, providing a way for interested members of 
   the Internet community to compare notes, ask questions, and share insights 
   of a technical nature about these machines.  While it is not primarily a 
   consumer's guide to the IBM PC, the digest may also be useful for that 
   purpose.

   Messages are collected, edited into digests and distributed as the volume 
   of mail dictates (generally twice a week).  All messages regarding hardware
   for IBM PCs, PC and compatibles and software are welcomed; messages on 
   other topics will not be run.  In addition, two topics are taboo and are 
   routinely edited out: (1) self promotion of products for sale, and (2) 
   anything about copy protection.

   An archive of back issues and a program library are available to those with
   FTP access (essentially anyone on the Internet).  Digests are archived at 
   WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL in PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC> in <YYMM.1-TXT> format. 
   Digests from September 1982 through the current issue are available by 
   ANONYMOUS FTP login.

   A library of free software in binary and source code form is maintained at 
   SIMTEL20 in directory PD1:<MSDOS> and PD2:<MSDOS2>.  A list of all MS-DOS 
   programs available from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL is contained in 
   PD1:<MSDOS>FILES.IDX.  Donations of source code are welcomed.  Donated 
   programs must be truly free and public domain, with no fee or contribution 
   required or requested, and no license agreement.  To donate a program to 
   the library, send a description of the program along with a copy of the 
   source code to INFO-IBMPC-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

   Files may be FTP'ed by logging in to the SIMTEL20 FTP server with username 
   ANONYMOUS, password GUEST.  (Although GUEST is a perfectly good password, a
   password of <YOUR-NAME@YOUR-HOST> is preferred.)  For those subscribers 
   without Internet FTP access, a file transfer mechanism has been set up with
   RPIECS.bitnet.  For more details, send a message to 
   <LISTSERV@RPIECS.bitnet> with the first line of 'HELP' or ask the editor 
   for the Simtel-Bitnet FTP help file.  Requested files are mailed to those 
   users with a VALID Internet return address.

   WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL can be accessed using LISTSERV commands from BITNET 
   and those users without Internet FTP access via LISTSERV@NDSUVM1, 
   LISTSERV@RPIECS, LISTSERV@FINTUVM and in Europe from EARN TRICKLE servers. 
   Send commands to LISTSERV or TRICKLE@<host-name> (example: TRICKLE@TREARN).
   The following TRICKLE servers are presently available: AWIWUW11 (Austria), 
   BANUFS11 (Belgium), DKTC11 (Denmark), DB0FUB11 (Germany), IMIPOLI (Italy), 
   EB0UB011 (Spain) TAUNIVM (Israel) and TREARN (Turkey).

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to INFO-IBMPC-REQUEST@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL.

   BITNET users must join the INFO-IBMPC distribution list through the BITNET 
   LISTSERV mechanism.  There are IBMPC-L BITNET sub-distribution lists at the
   following BITNET hosts: BNANDP11, UTORONTO, CEARN, DEARN, EB0UB011, 
   FINHUTC, HEARN, VTVM1, POLYGRAF, $$INFOPC@RICEVM1, TAMVM1, TAUNIVM, UBVM, 
   UGA, and VTVM2.  BitNet subscribers can join by sending a SUB command to 
   the nearest LISTSERV node or to <LISTSERV@POLYGRAF.bitnet>.  For example:
      SEND LISTSERV@CEARN SUB IBMPC-L Jon Doe
   To be removed from the list substitute the keyword "SIGNOFF" for "SUB".  To
   make contributions to the list, BITNET subscribers should send mail to 
   <INFO-IBMPC@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL> and NOT to the BITNET list name.

   For those users on USENET, the Digest is available from newsfeed 
   comp.sys.ibm.pc.digest.  Since the current editor does not have a USENET 
   feed, please include <INFO-IBMPC@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL> as a CC: address 
   on all messages sent to USENET.

   On BITNET, the archives can be obtained from DATABASE@BITNIC.BITNET and the
   program library can be obtained from CCUC@UMCVMB.BITNET.  The 
   WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL FTP server may also be reached via 
   <LISTSERV%RPICICGE.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU>. For more details, send a

INFO-KERMIT@WATSUN.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU

   Kermit is a file transfer protocol developed at Columbia University in New 
   York City, USA, for use primarily between micros and mainframes over 
   asynchronous serial connections, dialed or direct, over public data 
   networks, etc.  Kermit programs that implement this protocol can transfer 
   textual as well as binary files over both 7-bit and 8-bit communication 
   links, singly or in groups.  As of this writing (May 1989), Kermit programs
   are available for nearly 350 different computers and operating systems.  
   The Info-Kermit mailing list is a digest intended for people who maintain 
   or install Kermit at their sites, or who are (thinking about) working on a 
   new implementation, or who have bugs and/or fixes to report, or who are 
   interested in discussing the protocol, and also for Kermit users.  The 
   digest is available on Internet, CSNET, MAILNET, BITNET, EARN, USENET, 
   CCNET, DEC EASYNET, and any other network gatewayed to the Internet.

   Info-Kermit archives are collected in kermit/e/imail.*, one file (paginaged
   and indexed) per volume, generally 2 volumes per year.  Other Kermit files 
   are also available via both Internet and BitNet/EARN and by mail order.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems, questions,
   etc., should be sent to Info-Kermit-Request@WATSON.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU or to 
   KERMIT@CUVMA.BITNET. You may also subscribe to Info-Kermit automatically 
   via LISTSERV.  To do this, send e-mail to LISTSERV@CUVMB.BITNET, containing
   the message text:
      SUBSCRIBE I-KERMIT your name
   To remove yourself from the Info-Kermit LISTSERV distribution list, send a 
   message to LISTSERV@CUVMA.BITNET with the message text:
      UNSUBSCRIBE I-KERMIT

INFO-M2%DB0TUI11.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
INFO-M2%UCF1VM.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

   A discussion list for the Modula-2 programming language.  Modula-2 is a 
   language by Niklaus Wirth which extends the Pascal foundation by providing 
   an updated statement syntax (generalized LOOP, EXIT, RETURN, no GOTO), 
   separate compilation with a module (compilation unit) broken into 
   specification and implementation parts with importing and exporting of 
   objects, controlled machine level access, and concurrent programming and 
   coroutines.  Modula-2 has most of the power of Ada but is small enough that
   excellent full implementations exist for CP/M 80.

   Contributions may be sent to INFO-M2@ucf1vm.Bitnet (from the US) or to 
   INFO-M2@db0tui11.Bitnet (from Europe); these are both entry points for the 
   same list.

   another file as each file reached 150 disk pages.  To conserve disk space, 
   all the mail files in the archive, except for the current year, are 
   individually compressed.  The compressed files have the suffix -Z as part 
   of the filetype field; they should be renamed to have the suffix .Z 
   (uppercase Z) when transfered to a Unix system so the uncompress program 
   will find them.  The current month's mail is still kept in 
   INFO-MICRO-ARCHIV.TXT.  The archives are stored in directory:
      PD2:<ARCHIVES.INFO-MICRO>
