    INTERNET RESOURCES:  U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INFORMATION

Release 0.5, October 1993

Compiled/copyright by Maggie Parhamovich (magoo@nevada.edu),
Government Documents, Dickinson Library, University of Nevada Las
Vegas.

This document is available via anonymous ftp at the University of
Nevada (ftp nevada.edu  directory /liaison).

This guide was compiled primarily for librarians who provide
reference assistance for U.S. Government Documents and contains
telnet, gopher and ftp sites which may assist in providing
reference service for library patrons who need government
information.   It is impossible to fully index Internet sites and
I recommend utilizing Veronica, Archie and gopher servers to locate
more information.  FreeNets also provide easy access to government
information especially for local and state information.  A new
feature on the gopher at the University of Syracuse is Oliver which
provides easy access to many U.S. government sites and gophers.
Also, check out the NST and USDA Gophers which provide easy access
to many U.S. government databases.  Government information,
especially electronic is constantly changing and I welcome any
corrections and suggestions.

A word about gophers; if I know the telnet address and password for
a gopher I have included login instructions.  However, I recommend
you "point your gopher client" to other gophers instead of using
telnet.  This not only facilitates login but may also be easier to
use.  Your computing services can provide you with information on
your institution's gopher capabilities.

Original funding and research was conducted with the support of
ALA/USIA Fellows Program.  As a Fellow to Dalhousie University,
Halifax, Nova Scotia and the University of New Brunswick, Canada I
conducted a number of workshops on U.S. government information.  I
appreciate the support of the ALA/USIA Fellows Program which
provided the opportunity and time necessary to investigate
electronic government information.

Reproduction/distribution without my permission is allowable for
nonprofit educational purposes so long as this document is left

Author's note


I am sending out the 5th edition Internet Resources: U.S. Federal
Government Information.  New on this edition:  the list moves from
Dalhousie University to UNLV and will be placed on a ftp site.  Also,
I have added some discussion lists and am particulary interested in
local government documents discussion lists.  I hope to add to the
Library Catalogs section in the next edition with more catalogs which
maintain a separate documents catalog.

This list has grown almost beyond what is reasonable and I am seeing
increases in the number and availablity of government gophers.  I
see this as a positive development as more information becomes accessible
on the net and easier to find.

Please forward any changes and corrections to me directly.

DISTRIBUTION: How to obtain this document


This document has been brought to you in part by CRAM, involved in the
redistribution of valuable information to a wider USENET audience (see
below). The most recent version of this document can be obtained via
the author's instructions at the beginning. The following directions
apply to retrieve the possibly less-current USENET FAQ version.

  FTP
  ---
    This FAQ is available from the standard FAQ server rtfm.mit.edu via
    FTP in the file /pub/usenet/news.answers/us-govt-net-pointers/part3

  Email
  -----
    Email requests for FAQs go to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with commands
    on lines in the message body, e.g. `help' and `index'.

  Usenet
  ------
    This FAQ is posted every 21 days to the groups
      alt.politics.economics,
      alt.politics.usa.misc,
      soc.politics,
      soc.answers
      alt.answers,
      news.answers

CRAM: the Cyberspatial Reality Advancement Movement

In an effort to bring valuable information to the masses, and
as a service to motivated information compilers, I
(L. Detweiler) will help others unfamiliar with Usenet
`publish' their documents for widespread dissemination via the
FAQ structure, and act as a `sponsor' knowledgable in the
submissions process. This document is being distributed under
this arrangement.

I have found these compilations tend to appear on various
mailing lists and are valuable enough to deserve wider
distribution. If you know of an existing compilation of
Internet information that is not currently a FAQ, please
contact me and I may `sponsor' it. The benefits to the author
include:

- use of the existing FAQ infrastructure for distribution:
  - automated mail server service
  - FTP archival
  - automated posting

- a far wider audience that can improve the quality, accuracy,
  and coverage of the document enormously through email
  feedback

- potential professional inquiries for the use of your
  document in other settings, such as newsletters, books,
  etc.

- with me as your sponsor, I will also take care of the
  technicalities in the proper format of the posted version
  and updating procedures, leaving you free of the `overhead'
  to focus on the basic updates alone

Send comments relating to the *distribution* of this document
(particularly relevant newsgroups not currently covered in
its current distribution) or inquiries on other documents to
<tmp@lamar.acns.colostate.edu>.

The choice of who I `sponsor' is entirely arbitrary. You always
have the option of handling the submission process yourself.
See the FAQ submission guidlines FAQ in news.answers.
