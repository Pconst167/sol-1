INFORMATION RESOURCES:
The secret to the wide range of information available on HFN
is the time and expertise contributed by the community.
Organizations all over Illinois contribute information which
is difficult or impossible to obtain from any other resources.
Information on the network covers a large variety of topics;
the listing of the complete menu is in the Administration
Building area of the network and is 25 typed pages long.
Topics covered include 108 areas of social services; a
complete year long community calendar; the American Red Cross;
the Boy Scouts; business help resources and statistical
information; extensive Senior information and resources; local
government information, including addresses of all elected
officials; legal data; medicine including chemical dependency,
mental, and hospital health services; tax; primary, secondary,
and post secondary educational opportunities; home and garden
subjects; historical documents and a library supported
reference desk; aviation; environment and recycling; personal
computer, religion and ethics; and travel information.  Users
also have access to personal electronic mail and editorial
areas.

One of the most popular areas of the Free-net is presented by
Illinois Job Service which provides current listings of about
100 jobs.  In addition, experts in all fields from law to
chemical dependency to the Red Cross to gardening contribute
their time and expertise to respond to questions asked
anonymously by the public.  Specifically, the following
organizations are currently contributing information and

The amount and type of information available through HFN is
limited only by the imagination.  The skill of HFN lies in its
ability to seek out pertinent information from credible
resources and to present that information in such a way as to
not inconvenience or burden the Information Provider while
making information easy to find and comprehend for the user.
All data is kept updated by the combined resources of the
Information Provider and Free-net staff.
