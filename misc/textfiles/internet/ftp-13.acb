Welcome, and Introducing The AWE Virtual Site!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here's a February list!  Don't worry, you haven't missed out on any AWE lists,
it's been a couple weeks since we've sent out one.  Partially because we have
been quite busy with non-Internet related activities, and also because we have
been working on our latest idea -- The AWE Virtual Site, or "AWE V.S.", which
will debut within a week or two.  This is the latest and greatest method of
warez exchange to hit the scene.  Here are some key features:

    1) The membership system will be fair and responsibility 
       equally distributed.
    2) This "virtual site" will continue to grow, whereas traditional sites
       only last between a few days to a couple of weeks maximum.
    3) All popular software, not just 0-day warez, will be available.
    4) Data transfers by design of the Virtual Site will be much faster AND
       safer in terms of anonomity.

We are very excited about this, and will present all the details shortly!
Stay tuned...


PGP Notice
~~~~~~~~~~
Our previous PGP secret ring got destroyed (it was transfered to floppy and
that floppy went bad).  We should've made several copies -- anyways, if you've
sent a PGP message but haven't gotten a response this is why.  Please 
record our new PGP public key below and resend any messages!


Wanted
~~~~~~
Still looking for Omega Tradestation (financial charting software)...
very hard to find I'm sure, but would be forever indebted.  Also need
Macromind Director.

Notes on * Rating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following is our new rating system.  Basically, for each decent program
that a site has, we give it one star.  So a site with 6* means it has six stars,
or six decent programs.  Sometimes we'll add an extra star or two for big programs
like Win'95, Corel Draw, ACAD13, etc.  Blanks means we couldn't connect, too many
FTP users, or just didn't get a chance to rate that site.  Please use this 
format when sending in sites if possible!


Good Luck,
