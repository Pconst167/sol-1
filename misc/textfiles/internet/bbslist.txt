FOREWORD:
^^^^^^^^^
        The following list has been compiled with the help of the
        wonderfully generous who associate with InterNet or UseNet.
        I owe them many thanks and please continue to send information.
        The amount of mail I recieve is enormous, and I appreciate the
        responses.

        I have a few things to say about these BBS's in general.  So bear
        with me, or skip ahead, but do take the time to read this.

        1.      These BBS's are provided as a service to anyone
                on Internet.  Not just you.  This means that you should
                try not to dominate these sites
                by staying logged in continuously or repeatedly trying to
                gain access.
        2.      While you may not directly pay for these services
                someone does.  These bbs's are run on someone else's
                computer, which means that someone else pays to keep it
                running, provide space and access, and fix problems.
        3.      You are a guest, and please keep that in mind while
                using these BBS's

        Okay, that wasn't so bad after all.

        Most of these BBS`s offer services unique to BBS'ing. Some offer
        small scale versions of standard Internet sevices.  Keep in mind
        that mail or articles posted on BBS's does not reach everyone in
        the world, and if you can get to UseNet, you will problably find
        better responses.  Most of the files on these BBS`s can be found
        by anonymous FTP, so don't tie up the system downloading files if
        you have FTP.  Do be considerate on these BBS`s, some people aren't
        using Telnet or Rlogin to get to these, some people still dial
        numbers with modems at there homes.

        I'm not going to say anymore, because you can figure most of
        this out for yourselves.  Enjoy the list and write back to tell
        me about these BBS`s.  I want to add as much info to these as
        possible.   A little abstract, such as services, will be
        great.

        For users of JANET (UK), you may access these bbs's through
        first connecting to UK.AC.NFSNET-RELAY.TELNET or
        PAD.UK.AC.NFSNET-RELAY.TELNET.  Likewise, users of internet can
        get to JANET by telnet SUN.NFS.AC.UK, login as janet.

        Something New!!!!!

        all sites that are prefixed with ===========
        and sufixed with the same thing are sites that are
        down and will probably be removed from this list.

SERVICES
^^^^^^^^
        The following is a list of useful services that most
        BBS'ers are interested in.  I have not checked any of
        these except Archie.  If you have more info about
        these or if you know of other to add, please mail
        me: Zamfield@Dune.EE.MsState.Edu.  I will make the
        changes and post the list again.  Enjoy. :-)

        --              Internet Relay Chat access.  Not all IRC commands are
        --              supported.  IRC is similar to the chat system on
        --              Pirate BBS's but much more powerful. IRC has channels,
        --              which you join to join a discussion, or you can create
        --              your own to discuss whatever you like.  These sessions
        --              are very informal, and topics can stay quickly.
