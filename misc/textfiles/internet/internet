Sometime ago I posted a query asking for the "Internetworking Guide".
Someone sent me a copy, and I'm posting it here.

Methinks I'll make it a fortnightly/monthly posting, and if you
have any updates, etc., send them over to me or the author.

Enjoy..

Ajay..

Inter-Network Mail Guide - Copyright 1990 by John J. Chew
  $Header: netmail,v 1.12 90/07/06 20:38:28 john Exp $

For those of you who were wondering what happened to the June 1990 issue,
there wasn't one, because of a lack of important changes to the data,
and because I've been busy with other things.  Even worse (:-), there
will not be an August 1990 issue as I will be temporarily between net
addresses as I take a nice long holiday between jobs on different
continents.  If you have information to add or requests for subscriptions,
send them as usual to me at <poslfit@gpu.UTCS.UToronto.CA> and they should
catch up to me with some delay wherever I end up.  I'm off to enjoy
my summer now, bye!  -- John

INTRODUCTION

This file documents methods of sending mail from one network to another.
It represents the aggregate knowledge of the readers of comp.mail.misc
and many contributors elsewhere.  If you know of any corrections or
additions to this file, please read the file format documentation below
and then mail to me: John J. Chew <poslfit@gpu.utcs.utoronto.ca>.  If
you do not have access to electronic mail (which makes me wonder about
the nature of your interest in the subject, but there does seem to be
a small such population out there) you can call me during the month of
July at +1 416 979 7166 between 11:00 and 24:00 EDT (UTC-4h) and most
likely talk to my answering machine (:-).

DISTRIBUTION

(news) This list is posted monthly to Usenet newsgroups comp.mail.misc and
  news.newusers.questions.
(mail) I maintain a growing list of subscribers who receive each monthly
  issue by electronic mail, and recommend this to anyone planning to
  redistribute the list on a regular basis.
(FTP) Internet users can fetch this guide by anonymous FTP as ~ftp/pub/docs/
  internetwork-mail-guide on Ra.MsState.Edu (130.18.80.10 or 130.18.96.37)
  [Courtesy of Frank W. Peters]
(Listserv) Bitnet users can fetch this guide from the Listserv at UNMVM.
  Send mail to LISTSERV@UNMVM with blank subject and body consisting of
  the line "GET NETWORK GUIDE".  [Courtesy of Art St. George]

HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

Each entry in this file describes how to get from one network to another.
To keep this file at a reasonable size, methods that can be generated by
transitivity (A->B and B->C gives A->B->C) are omitted.  Entries are sorted
first by source network and then by destination network.  This is what a
typical entry looks like:

  #F mynet
  #T yournet
  #R youraddress
  #C contact address if any
  #I send to "youraddress@thegateway"

For parsing purposes, entries are separated by at least one blank line,
and each line of an entry begins with a `#' followed by a letter.  Lines
beginning with `# ' are comments and need not be parsed.  Lines which do
not start with a `#' at all should be ignored as they are probably mail
or news headers.

#F (from) and #T (to) lines specify source and destination networks.
If you're sending me information about a new network, please give me
a brief description of the network so that I can add it to the list
below.  The abbreviated network names used in #F and #T lines should
consist only of the characters a-z, 0-9 and `-' unless someone can
make a very convincing case for their favourite pi character.

These are the currently known networks with abbreviated names:

  applelink     AppleLink (Apple Computer, Inc.'s in-house network)
  bitnet        international academic network
  bix           Byte Information eXchange: Byte magazine's commercial BBS
  bmug          Berkeley Macintosh Users Group
  compuserve    commercial time-sharing service
  connect       Connect Professional Information Network (commercial)
  easynet       Easynet (DEC's in-house mail system)
  envoy   Envoy-100 (Canadian commercial mail service)
  fax           Facsimile document transmission
  fidonet       PC-based BBS network
  geonet        GeoNet Mailbox Systems (commercial)
  internet      the Internet
  mci           MCI's commercial electronic mail service
  mfenet        Magnetic Fusion Energy Network
  nasamail      NASA internal electronic mail
  peacenet      non-profit mail service
  sinet         Schlumberger Information NETwork
  span          Space Physics Analysis Network (includes HEPnet)
  sprintmail    Sprint's commercial mail service (formerly Telemail)
  thenet        Texas Higher Education Network

#R (recipient) gives an example of an address on the destination network,
to make it clear in subsequent lines what text requires subsitution.

#C (contact) gives an address for inquiries concerning the gateway,
expressed as an address reachable from the source (#F) network.
Presumably, if you can't get the gateway to work at all, then knowing
an unreachable address on another network will not be of great help.

#I (instructions) lines, of which there may be several, give verbal
instructions to a user of the source network to let them send mail
to a user on the destination network.  Text that needs to be typed
will appear in double quotes, with C-style escapes if necessary.

#F applelink
#T internet
#R user@domain
#I send to "user@domain@internet#"
#I   domain can be be of the form "site.bitnet", address must be <35 characters

#F bitnet
#T internet
#R user@domain
#I Methods for sending mail from Bitnet to the Internet vary depending on
#I what mail software is running at the Bitnet site in question.  In the
#I best case, users should simply be able to send mail to "user@domain".
#I If this doesn't work, try "user%domain@gateway" where "gateway" is a
#I regional Bitnet-Internet gateway site.  Finally, if neither of these
#I works, you may have to try hand-coding an SMTP envelope for your mail.
#I If you have questions concerning this rather terse note, please try
#I contacting your local postmaster or system administrator first before
#I you send me mail -- John Chew <poslfit@gpu.utcs.utoronto.ca>
