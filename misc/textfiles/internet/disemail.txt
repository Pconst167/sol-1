How To Send Disguised (forged) E-Mail....

The Normal Disclaimer..


To begin with I would like to say that I do not condone any type of illegal 
activity that can be done with the knowledge you will get from this file.  
I will not be held responsible if you get booted of the net. Now that thats 
done with on to the file.


There is nothing special about this text file..There are a few already 
written on the same subject but I Figuered I would give a detailed example 
of how to execute this hack perfectly, give out the ability to find your 
own servers, show the many options you have with this hack, and I will also 
provide a list of servers that can be used to execute this hack.

Section I - Server list.

To begin with I will list some servers that can be used..Take your pick..

tomahawk.gate.net
ns.web2010.com
ns2.web2010.com
strech.cyber-naut.com
itis.easilink.com
ns.valueweb.net 

These are just a few that I have. I am going to explain how to find your own 
later in the text so dont worry about the short list.

Section II - Exectuion through your telnet client.

O.K. Now that you have decided what server you want to use you will have to 
open your telnet client (I reccomend CRT, I personally use this one).
Once your client is open (again this file assumes you are using CRT) you will
 type in the server address and in the port section replace port 23 with 25 
(once in a great while its port 19).
Press enter to connect.
Once connected you should see a message similar to this,

220 io. Sendmail SMI-8.6/SMI-SVR4 ready at Wed, 6 Aug 1997 17:17:20 -0400

the next line is optional although for some servers it is required or some 
may not allow it

helo somebody@nobody.com <enter>

the computer responds with,

250 io. Hello  [Your IP addess], pleased to meet you

This next line is to identify who the mail is from so you type,

mail from:whoever@whatever.com <enter>

the computer responds with,

250 whoever@whatever.com... Sender is valid.

this next line will identify who this letter is to be sent to so you type,

rcpt to:whoever@whatever.com <enter>

the computer responds with,

250 whoever@whatever.com... Recipient is valid.

next line marks the begining of your message so type

data <enter>

the computer will respond with,

354 Enter mail. End with the . character on a line by itself.

this part is optional (I recomned using them),

from:whoever@whatever.com <enter>
to:whoever@whatever.com <enter>
Subject:letter subject <enter>

next you will type in your message..if you do not wish to use the commands 
above just start typing your message.

"this is a test message"
.  <enter>

NOTE: The period must be on a line by itself!

the computer responds,

250 Ok

your done just type in,

quit <enter>

Section II - A.

Here is the overview of what just happened,

220 io. Sendmail SMI-8.6/SMI-SVR4 ready at Wed, 6 Aug 1997 17:17:20 -0400

Section III - Execution through your shell account (recomended)


So you have a shell account..Good! Shell accounts are very useful to the 
internet hacker..
Lets get started.. This assumes that you will use ns.web2010.com as you 
selected server and the user jeff@jeff.com (if there is even such a domain)..
Why do I recomend using a shell account? Because of the extra power it gives 
you. Extra power means more advantage. And that is its own explination!

Dial in or telnet to your shell account and login.
usually you will get the "$" prompt.
at this promp you will type,

telnet ns.web2010.com 25 <enter>

computer responds,

Trying 207.124.96.253...
Connected to ns.web2010.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
220  ESMTP ns.web2010.com Sendmail 8.8.5/8.6.9 ready at Wed, 6 Aug 1997 
17:49:37 -0400 (EDT)

again this command is usually optional but some systems may require it or 
some may not allow it,

helo jeff@jeff.com <enter>

the computer responds,

250 io. Hello  [Your IP addess], pleased to meet you

this command lets the computer know who the message is from so you type,

mail from:jeff@jeff.com <enter>

the computer responds,

250 jeff@jeff.com... Sender ok

this command lets the computer know who the message is to so you type,

rcpt to:jeff@jeff.com <enter>

the computer responds,

250 jeff@jeff.com... Recipient ok

this next command is required so type,

data <enter>

the next few lines are optional ( I recomend using them)

from:jeff@jeff.com <enter>
to:jeff@jeff.com <enter>
Subject:your subject <enter>
type your message here
.  <enter>

NOTE: period must be on line by itself!

the computer responds,

250 XAA06854 Message accepted for delivery

your done! now just type,

quit <enter>

Section III - A.

Not very hard is it ? Now for the overview..this is what the completed 
process shoud look like,

telnet ns.web2010.com 25
Trying 207.124.96.253...
Connected to ns.web2010.com.
Escape character is '^]'.

Section IV - How to find your own servers.

This is very easy,easy,easy hacking. I wouldnt even call it hacking cause 
anyone who can type can find this information. Here is how its done.

There are 2 options to do this..
One is with a shell account.
The other is with the interNIC website.

IV - A.

Finding mail servers through interNIC..Well this is the long and boring way..
I am not going to go into great detail for this option cause I think its 
pretty self explanitory.

Go the interNIC website (http://www.internic.com)
Search for a taken domain.
it should come up with the info on the search..see below (assuming you looked
 up hackers.com)

you will first get a message saying "Domain name used". and there will be a 
button which reads"Show me whois output" click this button and this is what 
you get..

Here is the raw whois output for hackers.com:

                NS2.SECURE.NET              192.41.2.10
             
             
             The InterNIC Registration Services Host contains ONLY Internet Information
             (Networks, ASN's, Domains, and POC's).
             Please use the whois server at nic.ddn.mil for MILNET Information.

O.K. now that all this juicy info. is up for us its time to get the server. 
See the server called "NS1.SECURE.NET" well this can (most likely) be used as
 a mail server as well as the second server can be used (once again most 
likely) 
Thats it..Now you have yourself a mail server to have fun with..
Remember the port to be used is 25 (hardly ever but possibly port 19)




Section IV - B.

Finding mail servers through your shell account..This is the easiest way to 
do this..This is how its done.

Login to your shell.

from there use this comand (assuming you are looking up hackers.com)

whois hackers.com
