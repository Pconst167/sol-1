                       ABOUT MONITORING CENTERS
                       ------------------------

The Monitoring Center (MC) hardware and software consists of the C/70 mini-
computer with peripheral components and the Network Utilities (NU) software
that runs on the C/70.  The NU software sets up the processes for
monitoring and metering, manipulating a data base of network entities
(components), displaying status, processing control commands, and
generating reports.  Each MC monitors and controls a designated collection
of Packet Switch Nodes (PSNs), Terminal Access Controllers (TACs),
Interswitch Trunks (ISTs), and host connections.  A CRT (light box)
displays network fault events (e.g., failed PSN, TAC, and IST) that are
actively monitored by the controller.  Access lines are not actively
monitored and require trouble reports from the Host Administrator or
responsible person for active intervention by the MC controller for problem
correction.  The network MCs are inherent elements of the Defense
Communications Agency Operations Center (DCAOC) and respective DCA Area
Communications Operations Center (ACOC).

Functionally the monitoring center staff monitors, controls and performs
remote troubleshooting, fault isolation and maintenance assistance
direction.

Controllers accomplish 55-1 outage reporting on PSNs, TACs, and ISTs.  
Subsequent to receipt of trouble reports for host systems, these 
controllers also prepare the 55-1 outage reports on access circuits.


                             HOST SYSTEMS
                             ------------

Host Administrators or responsible host system operations centers/personnel
must report problems to the MC for correction.  When reporting trouble, obtain 
a trouble ticket number, which will be used for reference purposes during
any follow-up inquiries.   


                              TERMINALS
                              ---------

Users local to a host computer must report problems to their Host
Administrator.

Users accessing a remote host computer via a Terminal Access
Controller (either direct connection or dial-up) should do the following:

    a.  Login Problems - See TAC banner.  In the event the TAC banner is 
        not reached, call the DDN Network Information Center (NIC)
        (CONUS only) telephone 1-800-235-3155.  Europe and Pacific areas,
        contact the appropriate monitoring center.  

    b.  Access Circuit Problems - Call the appropriate monitoring center.

    c.  Host Application Problems - Contact applicable Host Administrator 
        or host system operations center.
