      joking statement since we can't hear voice inflection over Unix.
;-)   Winky smiley. User just made a flirtatious and/or sarcastic remark.

:-(   Frowning smiley. User did not like that last statement or is upset
      or depressed about something.
:-I   Indifferent smiley. Better than a Frowning smilie but not quite as 
      good as a happy smiley
:->   User just made a really biting sarcastic remark. Worse than a :-).
