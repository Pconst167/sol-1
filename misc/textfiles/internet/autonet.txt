                                    FIDONET FREQ: 1:124/7017

                                    cd /pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/utils
                                    get autont30.zip







         NOTE:  This program has been thoroughly tested with NETCOM
                            and UNICOMP providers.

               I highly recommend using /SLOW at all times you won't
               be around... This ensures AutoNet the time to recover
               from any Internet hickups.




=================  WHY REGISTER???  =============================================



Registration entitles you to:


!   That noisy beginning screen goes away!

1.  Tagging files using AUTOFILE's FILE menu option.

2.  Deleting files!  The unregistered version does NOT delete the files
    at your home space on the Net.  That means you will probably be 
    charged for every megabyte you use.

3.  Mass mailing.  Registering entitles you to send mail, up
    to 1,000 letters.

4.  Get updates automatically - you'll get the NEW Auto-Net within
    hours after being released!

5.  Unlimited free upgrades.

    





=================  QUICK START!  =============================================

1. Unzip the files into their own directory.

2. Edit AUTONET.CFG with a text editor to reflect your Internet
   settings (see section below for detailed descriptions of each item)

3. Edit AGENDA.1 and include all the agenda items you want AutoNet to
   perform for you  (IE: ftp a site, change directory, get new files,
   send/receive mail, etc)
  
   See the AGENDA ITEMS section below for detailed descriptions of each item

4. Run AUTONET.EXE

5. Choose RUN AGENDA from the menu

6. NOTE: If you use a port other than COM1, you need to specify that
         on the command line.  See AUTONET-USAGE section below for a 
         complete list of command-line arguments

7. Autonet expects "login:" and "Password:" when it connects with your
   provider.  If you have any menus, or weird setups OTHER THAN this,
   you'll need to write a login script (see the SCRIPTING) section
   below for using those commands.

8. New files are stored in NEWFILES.1, everything is logged in AUTONET.LOG
   and you can edit many of the sample agendas to suit your needs

=================  FILE MANAGER  ==========================================

The FULL release of my file manager is out!


          AUTOFILE.EXE does a TON of things:


AGENDA          - You can edit/change/view your agenda, or create a new one

  NEW   - Creates a new agenda, from scratch.  Pick through an assortment
          of sites/directories and leech or download files, get NEW files,
          obtain great newsletters, who-is lists, sports schedules,
          perform archie searches for files, goto terminal mode plus tons
          more.
          Each item is added to your file: AGENDA.1 as you choose it.
          To see the results of your new agenda creation, choose AGENDA/VIEW
          and press enter above the AGENDA.1 file.

  DELETE  Lets you delete old agenda files you don't use anymore.  Simply
          highlight the old agenda file, then press ENTER to erase it.

  VIEW    Views agenda files using LIST.COM (if you don't have list.com,
          it's available at most local bbs's)

  QUIT    Aborts AUTOFILE


CONFIG          - Edit your current AUTONET.CFG, create a new one, or
                  create your own personal signature file (AUTONET.SIG)

  MAKE NEW  Creates a brand new config file.  If a current AUTONET.CFG exists,
            the information is imported to the editor.

  EDIT CFG  Edit a current config file.  Just fill out your information, then
            scroll down to the bottom of the screen.  Your file will be saved
            into AUTONET.CFG

  VIEW CFG  View a current config file using LIST.COM

  EDIT SIGNATURE   Create or edit your current AUTONET.SIG file.  Just scroll
                   down past the bottom to save the information.


FILE            - This is the fantastic NEW FILES manager.  When autonet calls
                  the Net, it stores any new files into NEWFILES.1   Then, later,
                  run AUTOFILE and pick out the new files that interest you.
                  Tag files with the [SPACEBAR], and press [ENTER] to save
                  your tagged files into a fresh AGENDA.1 file.
                  Now you're all set!  Just run AUTONET again to go obtain
                  those files you want...

   AVAILABLE IN REGISTERED VERSION ONLY

Example:  We run autonet, and go to several different sites.  Autonet finds
          a ton of new files that look pretty interesting.
          So we run AUTOFILE and choose FILE, then tag several dozen files,
          then press ENTER to save and quit.

          Wala, our agenda file is now ready to go get the files we want.
          Just run Autonet again, and he downloads them for us!


TOOLS           - Various useful tools for use with Autonet

  VIEW ZIP FILE   Views the contents of any zip file.  I invented my own
                  archie-processing engine that allows viewing the files
                  inside .ZIP/LHA/ARJ/PAK/ZOO..etc.
                  Just press ENTER or ESC to finish viewing.
                  NOTE: If you do not have any .ZIP files in the current
                        directory, no files will appear in your menu.

  VIEW LZH FILE   See above

  VIEW ARC FILE   See above

  CHECKSUM A FILE Allows picking a file from a menu, then calculates the
                  checksum (total of all bytes added together)

  SHOW SECRETS    Show all "undocumented keys" in Autonet

  VIEW ANY FILE   Just pick a file from the menu, and LIST.COM will view it!


HELP            - Primitive help.  Since AutoFile is menu-driven, I did not
                  over-document the features.  Most are self-explanatory

QUIT            - Quits AUTOFILE












=================  AGENDA ITEMS  ============================================

AutoNet does several types of tasks:



 ў      ftp     - an ftp site.  This command heads off to an FTP site,
                  in order to get some files, or find new files.

Example:        ftp oak.oakland.edu
                ftp ftp.spies.com
                ftp ftp.ncs.com


 ў      NCFTP   - This is NOT SUPPORTED, and if your Internet Provider
                  uses NCFTP, please ask that an alias be made, or something
                  else to let you use ACTUAL FTP commands.  NCFTP is a 
                  cutesy way of doing ftp, and allows command line history,
                  etc... all of which are not needed when using AutoNet

Example:        no examples, make sure you have ftp and NOT ncftp!


 ў      cd      - change a directory on the current site.

Example:        cd /pub/games
                cd /Library
                cd /pub/popular/DOOM



 ў      get     - retrieve a file to your local work space.  Hash marks
                  are turned on, and the file is determined by AUTONET to
                  be binary or ascii.

Example:        get SIMINDEX.ZIP
                get NEW.FILES
                get PARADOX.ZIP



 ў      new     - find XX # of new files.  The files will scroll by, and
                  AutoNet will find the first XX files you want.

Example:        new 20               - gets 20 newest files
                new 300              - gets newest 300 files
                new 5                - gets newest 5 files



 ў      wait    - waits for a specified period of time (in seconds)

Example:        wait 2               - pauses two seconds
                wait 14              - pauses fourteen seconds



 ў      delete  - erases a file on your Internet workspace (same as the RM command)

Example:        delete *.zip         - deletes all .ZIP files in your workspace.  This command
                                       works ONLY from your workspace, since most sites won't
                                       allow deleting files...

                delete DOWNLOADED    - a special command that will delete all files you have
                                       downloaded in this agenda from your Internet workspace.



 ў      send    - sends a string or character to the Internet

Some keywords are:      ENTER           : Sends a carriage return
                        |               : Also sends a carriage return
                        ESC             : Sends an escape character
                        CONTROL-Z       : Sends the Control-Z

Example:        send wais wais@server.net  - does a database wais connection
                send ENTER
                
                send telnet archie@oak.oakland.edu  - telnets to an archie server
                send ENTER

                send mypassword|     - sends your password to the Internet, then presses
                                       [Enter] for you.

                send dir|            - sends a directory command to the Internet, then presses
                                       [Enter] for you.

                send CONTROL-Z       - sends a Control-Z to the Internet, then logs you off
                send logout            your provider.
                send ENTER

NOTE:  ENTER, CONTROL-Z, SPACE, and ESC must be in upper case!



 ў     waitfor  - waits for a specified word to appear before continuing.
                  NOTE: Only accepts ONE WORD, not 400 words, or a whole
                  line of stuff.  Make sure to not include spaces, quotation
                  marks, etc...

Example:        waitfor login:       - waits for the login prompt
                send drnb
                send ENTER
                
                waitfor {netcom      - waits for Netcom's main prompt
                send telnet archie@oak.oakland.edu  - telnets to an archie server
                send ENTER

                waitfor Password:    - sends your password to the Internet at
                send ENTER             the correct time, then presses [ENTER]



 ў     DOWNLOAD - downloads a file from the Internet using DSZ.EXE Zmodem.
                  NOTE: Sends a "sz [file]" command to the Internet for downloading.

Example:        DOWNLOAD *.zip       - downloads all .ZIP files from your Internet work area




 ў     UPLOAD   - downloads a file from the Internet using DSZ.EXE Zmodem.
                  NOTE: Uses the enclosed DSZ.EXE.  Custom Zmodem won't work
                        when uploading

Example:        UPLOAD file.zip      - uploads the file file.zip onto the Internet using
                                       dsz.exe.




 ў      run     - runs a script file.  These are plain text files that contain script
                  commands.  Each line is run consecutively.

Example:        run myscrip.scr      - runs a script file: MYSCRIP.SCR.  Script files contain
                                       plain text with commands EXACTLY like these.  This
                                       allows you to not manually type in a long series of
                                       commands into EACH agenda.. you can just spawn off a
                                       script file.



 ў      goto terminal   - drops to Terminal mode, and pages you.  This allows you to perform
                          tasks while AutoNet is online.

Example:        goto terminal        - drops into Terminal mode, and pages you.



 ў      login           - uses an external script file to log you into the Internet.  This is
                          good for people that have weird login sequences, like menus, etc.
                          before they can access the Unix Shell

Example:        login myscrip.scr    - logs into the Internet using the script file: MYSCRIP.SCR



 ў      MANUAL LOGIN    - Allows you to manually log into your Internet provider.
                          Include this as the first line in your AGENDA file, and
                          Autonet will prompt you to log in, and press ALT-Q
                          when done.
                          This is great for people having problems logging in,
                          or getting around an ugly menu interface when you
                          first call in.
                          AUTO-NET works from a unix shell, and cannot operate
                          in menus!

Example:        MANUAL LOGIN
                ftp oak.oakland.edu
                cd /pub



 ў      DIRECT CONNECT  - Allows you to begin AutoNet without dialing in, logging
                          on, etc.  This is mainly designed for people with direct
                          TCPIP accounts, that don't need to physically dial into
                          a provider.  This should always be the FIRST LINE of your
                          AGENDA file, and some scripting may be necessary to get
                          into your account.  Trial and error is the best way to 
                          get in.
                          AUTO-NET works from a unix shell, and cannot operate
                          in menus!

Example:        DIRECT CONNECT
                ftp oak.oakland.edu
                cd /pub



 ў      ARCHIE          - Does an archie search (see ARCHIE SEARCHES section below)

Example:        ARCHIE archie.cfg

NOTE: The word ARCHIE must be in all capital letters!



 ў      MAIL             - Sends mail to anyone you choose, automatically
                           (see MAILING PEOPLE below)

Example:        MAIL mail.cfg

NOTE: The word MAIL must be in all capital letters!



 ў      UQWK             - compresses your mail or UseNet messages into a .QWK packet for download.  
                           Once compressed, you can read your mail offline using any of the 
                           OFFLINE MAIL READERS available (Blue Wave, Offline, RoboMail, etc)
                           NOTE: Whatever is on your UQWK line (in your AGENDA file) is sent to 
                                 the Internet directly
                           You must follow this command usually with a SEND zip -m inet.qwk *.ndx *.dat
                           which packs the dat files and index files into a qwk packet, ready to read.

                           Talk to your Internet provider for more info on the UQWK program, and
                           look at the UQWK.1, SENDMAIL.1 and GETMAIL.1 agendas.

Example:         uqwk +n -h -B9000




 ў     finger              fingers a site, and captures the output to a file you specify
                           in your FINGER.CFG.  See the TOO MANY CONFIG FILES section below
                           for more details.  A finger will wait your default TIMEOUT period
                           before proceeding.  This is to ensure the data gets through okay.

Example:        finger yanoff@info.com
                finger oak.oakland.edu



 ў     put               - puts a file onto an Internet site.  This does the opposite of 'get',
                           and allows you to upload files to various sites.  NOTE: Most sites
                           have strict rules about uploading.. so read before you try this.
                           The PUT feature is fantastic for shareware authors, because it allows
                           you to mass distribute files without being home!

Example:         put myprog.zip
                 put autont14.zip





 ў     questsite [site]  - Goes to the site and "quests" information from it
                           automatically!  See the QUEST SITE section below
                           for more information....

Example:         questsite ftp.uu.net
                 questsite ftp.uni-koeln.de

 ў     hammer sites      - tells AutoNet to keep trying sites that are "not available"
                           up to 30 times, until it gets through.  This is good for
                           sites like wuarchive.wustl.edu, that are ALWAYS busy.

Example:        hammer sites
                ftp wuarchive.wustl.edu
                cd /pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS
                   .....


 ў     kill area         - tells AutoNet to completely wipe out your user area before
                           it logs off.  A person reported problems with DELETE DOWNLOADED
                           so I decided to include this.  This line can be included anywhere
                           in your agenda file!   And it sends a "rm *.*" to the Net
                           before logging off.


 ў     leech all         - leeches all files in a directory.  If you know of a favorite site,
                           and want to get all files in a directory, use this.  It sends 
                           a "mget *.*" to the ftp site, and then answers 'Y' to all prompts.
                           CAREFUL: Don't fill up your user area too much.

Example:        ftp wuarchive.wustl.edu
                cd /pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/utils
                leech all
                ftp oak.oakland.edu
                   .....


 ў       STOP    - Download workspace files, log off and hang up - Quit AutoNet

NOTE: The word STOP must be in all capital letters!


The usual order is:     ftp a site
                        change to a directory
                        get new files / or get a particular file
                          .. repeat above...
                        STOP











When AutoNet is finished, it downloads the files from your workspace AUTOMATICALLY
(please don't download them twice by using DOWNLOAD [filename]) using
DSZ.EXE (enclosed Texas Zmodem Protocol), logs off the Internet, hangs
up and quits.

AutoNet reads in a file called AGENDA.1 by default.  You can change
your agenda file by specifying it on the command line.  NOTE:  All agenda
files must have an extension:  .1  An agenda file is a plain text file
detailing what you want AutoNet to do.

Sample command line agenda change:      autonet myagenda.1
                                        autonet /COM2 bigagend.1

NOTE: Agenda files must have a ".1" in their name!!


Sample AGENDA.1:                ftp NCTUCCCA.edu.tw
                                cd /PC/wuarchive/games
                                new 30
                                get Doom2.zip
                                STOP

Another Sample AGENDA.1:        ftp oak.oakland.edu
                                cd /pub
                                get SIMINDEX.ZIP
                                get last100uploads
                                ftp ftp.spies.com
                                cd /Library
                                new 100
                                STOP

Merely create an AGENDA.1 with your needed tasks, make sure DSZ.EXE is
in your PATH, then type: AUTONET.EXE

   [ read below for command line options ]

When done, AutoNet closes up, and leaves behind a logfile: AUTONET.LOG
and your new files list:  NEWFILES.1   If a NEWFILES.1 already exists, it will
be added to.  Please ensure your newfiles lists do not get too large.. I recommend
backing them up after each agenda has been completed.

The new files list contains:

        1.      Which Internet site these files are from
        2.      The directory
        3.      A complete, detailed listing of the files it found.














=============   AUTO-NET   The first and foremost automated  ================
                           Internet communication program



    Welcome to the most powerful communications package you'll ever find.
    AutoNet has been called "a batch file language for the Internet", but
    it's actually MUCH MORE.  AutoNet is semi-intelligent.

    If he doesn't find a ftp site, then he doesn't try downloading files,
    changing directories, etc. at that site...  If he cannot find ONE
    particular prompt, he looks for others.  This super-advanced program
    is the only one of its type.  Fast, efficient, and worthwhile to try out.

    I use AutoNet every single day to find new files on the Internet for
    my bulletin board.  I get the LATEST Scan, F-PROT, Tbav, and all the
    games FOR FREE!  No long distance charges.

    If you are an Internet "dummy", don't use this program!  This is for
    the average user of the Net that loves to wander around and find new
    cool files, but HATE spending hours at a time sitting in front of the
    computer.  Here is your answer.


    AutoNet allows you to:

        Use the enhanced file manager, complete with PKZIP/LHA/ARC file
        viewing, editing config/signature files, agenda creation, editing,
        tag new files for download and MORE!

        Gives you unlimited access to TERABYTES of Internet files without
        forcing you to sit in front of your computer for hours.

        Perform ARCHIE searches for files, at a variety of archie sites.
        And when one archie site is busy, AutoNet will keep trying others
        until it gets through.  Allows using "custom" archie commands.
        You control it all...

        Mail your letters automatically, even to hundreds of recipients
        at one time.  Great for announcements, personal letters or
        business purposes.

        Allows super-advanced Internet access using the basic service.
        NO SLIP/PPP accounts required.

        Does FINGER searches quick and easy, and captures them into a
        file of your choice.

        Uploads files to Internet sites.

        Leeches files from anywhere, take them all without hesitation.

        Full mouse support

        Hammers at Internet sites that are busy, and require hours of
        frustration to get on.  AutoNet will get on, guaranteed.  Even
        if it has to try for hours (optional - you can turn off if you
        want...)

        Obtain the latest sports, weather, and daily info.
                
        Uses personal "signature file" that password protects your Internet
        sessions, and ensures no unauthorized people snooping into your
        AutoNet information.

        Download Usenet BINARY files - AutoNet combines the necessary
        messages together, UUdecodes them and downloads the resulting
        binary file.  All automatically!

        Post Usenet messages - up to 1,000 of them without touching
        your keyboard.

        Fax people from the Internet.  No long distance charges.

        Has an "enhanced" terminal mode, complete with hotkeys and menus.

        Find the latest new files and games.. WHILE YOU'RE NOT HOME!

        Learn how to navigate the Internet with AutoNet's TEACH mode.

        Use an advanced scripting language to complete all your tasks.

        Stop at any time during your agenda to perform your OWN things.
        When AutoNet reaches your destination, he will page you!

        Pick out great files from the SIMINDEX.ZIP index file located on most
        sites, and download them automatically.

        Download more files than your hard disk can hold.... without any
        long distance charges.

        Get updates to your favorite programs automatically - direct
        from their support Internet site.

        Access the Internet with super-speed.  You cannot type as fast
        as AutoNet can stuff the keys for you!

        If you're calling long distance to access the Internet, AutoNet
        cuts your phone bill in HALF by whizzing through your tasks
        faster than you could do them yourSELF.

        Drop to Terminal mode while AutoNet is working.







==  ATTENTION WINDOWS USER:   ===============================================

        Do you have one of those cutsie Windows interfaces (like Mosaic,
        Hooked, Cameleon) ??
        Those are fantastic for getting/sending mail, but for files...
        they just won't cut it.  You STILL have to sit at your computer
        and click on the files you want, get them to your local computer,
        then hunt down any new files that might interest you at different
        sites on the Net.

        What a pain!

        Your time is valuable... use AutoNet to retrieve any new files
        and then download them while you do something YOU want to do.
        Go jog, workout, shop, sleep, go out with your wife/girlfriend,
        do the things you REALLY want to rather than getting new files
        for hours at a time.

        Also:  Are you paying extra for a SLIP account, or a PPP account?
               You can use Auto-Net on your REGULAR account, and save you
               money!

        Coming (moderately :-) ) soon:  AutoNet for Windows!







==  AUTO-NET USAGE:   =======================================================

                       AUTONET [switch]

        AutoNet's defaults are:  FAST mode, use COM 1, and use N81
                                 for the connection.

        Whereas switch might be:

        /AUTO   Runs AutoNet without using the beginning menu.

        /UNICOMP   Uses UniComp prompts and commands.  If your provider
                   is UNICOMP, then please use this switch for maximum
                   compatibility with Auto-Net.

        /?      A brief HELP screen, then AutoNet exits.

        /COM2   Use COM 2 for the modem.  AutoNet defaults to COM1

        /COM3   Use COM 3 for the modem.  AutoNet defaults to COM1

        /COM4   Use COM 4 for the modem.  AutoNet defaults to COM1

        /TEACH  Learn how to navigate the Internet with AutoNet's TEACH
                mode.  In this option, AutoNet pauses before performing
                every action, and shows a screen telling exactly what
                its about to do.  This is fantastic for learning the
                basic Internet commands, and how to move around in
                'CyberSpace'.

        /TERM   Start off in Terminal mode.  AutoNet's terminal is very nice,
                and includes a menu.  Just press the UP ARROW to access it.
                The menu actually comes from the file COMMANDS.ANT, which you
                can edit with any text editor.  Make sure the commands are
                shorter than 50 characters.

    If you know the Net is slow and sluggish at around 3:00pm, and you will
    be running AutoNet then, use one of the following 'slow down' commands:

        /MED    Turns on MEDIUM SPEED mode.  This basically waits for a
                response from the Internet a little longer, and gives
                the "long version" of all the Internet commands.  Use this
                if you KNOW the Internet will be sluggish during the time
                you are running AutoNet.  If the Net is REAL sluggish and
                takes forever to run, use /SLOW instead.

        /SLOW   Turns on SLOW mode.  This basically waits for a response
                from the Internet a little longer, and gives the "long version"
                of all the Internet commands.
                Don't sit around and watch this... because it gets REAL
                boring.

        /SNAIL  Turns on VERY SLOW mode.  Five minutes to be exact.  This is
                for people with SERIOUS Internet problems, that get timeouts
                too often for the other speeds.  Do not use this unless
                absolutely necessary.  And don't sit around and watch this... 
                because you'll fall asleep!

        /E71    This sets the modem to E71 parameters, instead of N81.
                If you do not know what that means, consult your modem's
                manual for additional help.

        /INCDIR Include directory names when searching for new files.  This is
                great if you want to see any subdirectories that have new files
                also!

        /PULSE  Use pulse dialing instead of tone.         

        file.1    Runs an alternate agenda file (instead of the default AGENDA.1)
                  NOTE: Must have the ".1" extension!

        file.CFG  Tells Auto-Net to use a different config file.  The default
                  is AUTONET.CFG, but sometimes, you may have a new account, etc...

        file.LOG  Tells Auto-Net to use a different log file.  The default
                  is AUTONET.LOG, but sometimes you may not want to over-write
                  the old one.



Examples:       autonet  mainrun.1  /COM2           Runs the agenda MAINRUN.1 using com 2

                autonet  /INCDIR    /COM2  /MED     Runs the the default agenda (AGENDA.1)

==============  QUESTING SITES  ============================================

Is your time valuable?  If so, you don't have time to hunt through the
one MILLION different Internet sites out there!

Are you missing out?

PROBABLY, since most of those sites you haven't visited have some great
stuff.  But looking through them even with a pretty WINDOWS interface
will take decades.

Solution:  QUESTSITE [site]

This tells Auto-net to go visit a new site: [site], then open AN_QUEST.CAP
and get any msdos directories, README files, messages to ftp users,
windows files, unix files, and anything else of interest.  Auto-Net stores
all this info into AN_QUEST.CAP in the following format:

and then view AN_QUEST.CAP to see what goodies are out there waiting
for you to download!















=========   WHILE AUTONET IS RUNNING...  ====================================

    Autonet is 100% stand-alone when operating.  It has a thick bed
of logic that usually works very well.  

The acceptable keystrokes while it's running are:

        LEFT ARROW      Activates the menu while in Terminal mode.  Just 
                        highlight an item, and press ENTER to send that 
                        string to the terminal.  To include your own custom
                        commands, just edit the file COMMANDS.ANT with any
                        text editor.

        TAB             Moves the bottom info screen down, and increases
                        the size of the terminal screen.  You can move it
                        while the program is running, but it takes a second
                        for the screens to use their new sizes.

        SHIFT-TAB       Moves the bottom screen back up.  NOTE: The bottom 
                        blue window will NOT go farther up than 13 rows.

        F1              Help screen.

        F2              Pause.  This will completely stop AutoNet's processing
                        until you press a key.

        F3              Screen blanker.  The screen will go completely
                        blank and wait for you to press F3 again.  A little
                        black box will appear on the upper left corner.
                        This allows you to still see the cursor move, and
                        to make sure that AUTONET is still receiving info
                        from the modem.

        F4              Remain at the current site.  When AutoNet is done
                        at the current site (ie: ftp.mcs.com, oak.oakland.edu)
                        It will sound a quick alarm that sounds like a phone
                        ringing, to alert you that you're UP!  Then it drops
                        to terminal mode and allows you to edit/do things/
                        perform tasks that you need to at this particular
                        site.

        F5              Remain online after all processing is done.  Once
                        AutoNet is completely through with the agenda, it
                        will stop and alert you (a cute alarm sound) that
                        you're UP!  You can then visit a site, get SOUP
                        packets, or whatever else you needed to perform
                        before AutoNet logged you off.
                        Press ALT-Q stops the terminal mode, then logs you
                        out correctly.

        F6              Immediate Timeout.  If something goes wrong, and you
                        are tired of AutoNet just sitting there, waiting for
                        a timeout, you can press F6 and immediately time
                        him out.  This is good for those FEW TIMES AutoNet
                        may run into something weird, and not know what to
                        do (The Internet IS unpredictable, ya know!)

        F7              Change your TIMEOUT value.  This toggles timeout
                        speed between Fast/Medium/Slow.  Your info is updated
                        on the bottom status line.

        F8              Immediately logs Auto-Net off the current FTP site,
                        and goes to the next one.  NOTE: It will skip any
                        other commands between FTP sites (ie: newsletters,
                        downloads, etc...)

        ALT - X         Exits AutoNet immediately, and shuts down the modem.
                        This is a very quick, but rude method of shutting
                        the system down.  It is preferable to use ALT-Q

        ALT - T         Terminal mode.  The screen will burst into a full
                        terminal screen, and a little status line will appear
                        at the bottom.  To exit Terminal mode, press ALT-Q

        ALT - H         Hang up the modem.

        ALT - L         Toggles the current Open/Closed state of the current
                        log file: AUTONET.LOG

        ALT - C         Clears the current terminal screen.

        ALT - Q         Exit Terminal mode.

        During TEACH mode, press the '=' key to stop all teaching
        prompts and windows.










==================   USING THE AUTONET.CFG FILE   ===========================

    AutoNet.Cfg file tells AutoNet your basic preferences for running it.

        These include:

        THE PHONE NUMBER/NAME/ADDRESS of your Internet provider
        YOUR NAME/PASSWORD
        THE MODEM'S INTIALIZATION STRING and more...


Optionally, you can create your own "personal signature file" which contains
all this information, and your password is encrypted.  This locks your
Internet information from prying eyes, and ensures no unauthorized access
to your account.

If the file:  AUTONET.SIG exists, AutoNet reads in your info, then prompts
for your AutoNet password.  NOTE: This is NOT your Internet password, but
rather one you will use to lock up AutoNet from other people.

Example:        My Internet account is: autonet@unicomp.net and my
                password to log onto the Internet is: FRED

                When I first start up AutoNet, it will prompt me for a
                password.  I enter: STARTUP, which is my AutoNet
                startup-password.

                AutoNet then says ok, and logs onto the site for me.

You can create your AUTONET.SIG by running AUTOFILE.EXE.
Just choose CONFIG and SIGNATURE from the main menu.



NOTE: If AUTONET.SIG exists, AutoNet will use it, and ask you for a password
      before starting.  Otherwise, AutoNet uses the regular AUTONET.CFG file.

If you do NOT want a signature file, do not create one.




The enclosed AUTONET.CFG should serve as an example.  Please remember that
EVERYTHING is case sensitive.  If you type in your name in UPPERCASE, then
it probably won't work.  The Internet is very picky.

    The possible lines are:

        autonet = user name

                        No big explanation here.  This is your user name
                        according to your Internet provider.  This is
                        used to both log in the Net, and log onto various
                        ftp sites.

        netcom.com = internet location

                        This is the second-half of your Internet address.
                        It's your actual provider's location.  This is
                        used for logging into the Net, and onto various
                        ftp sites.

        autonet@netcom.com = full address

                        Your FULL ADDRESS goes here (that's your user name + @ + location)

        FRED = password

                        This is your password you use to log onto the
                        Internet provider.

        ATZMS0=0 = modem init

                        Whatever your favorite modem initialization string
                        is, place it here.  These can include things like
                        turning off Auto-Answer, turning down/up modem's
                        volume, or retrieving a setting from the modem's
                        memory.  Consult your modem's manual for more
                        information.

        753-0015 = provider's phone number

                        Whatever the number is to your local provider.

        30 = timeout value

                        This allows you to set up how long you want AutoNet
                        to wait when waiting for a prompt to answer its
                        last command.  The default is 30 seconds, and
                        /MED will increase it to 60, and /SLOW will increase
                        it even more: to 90 seconds.
                        If Autonet does not get the default answer from the
                        Internet in the TIMEOUT time, it then looks for
                        alternate answers.  If not found, it processes the
                        error.
                        Be careful!  REAL long timeout values will hang up
                        AutoNet for long periods of time doing nothing!

        20 = max retries

                        The maximum number of retries you want AutoNet to
                        perform before giving up.  Many times, if your
                        Internet carrier is busy, AutoNet will call
                        hundreds of times without stopping until it gets
                        through.  This tells AutoNet how many times to
                        try your Internet carrier before giving up.

        C:\RECEIVE = download directory

                        Many people have requested I include a "download directory"
                        so you can specify where you want downloaded files
                        to go.  This line directs AutoNet to put received files
                        into C:\RECEIVE.     NOTE: No trailing backslash!

        GSZ.EXE port 2 rz = custom zmodem

                        Since some people have their own Zmodem program they like
                        better, AutoNet supports a "custom zmodem" string.  This
                        is whatever you want typed on the command line when
                        a Zmodem download is started.  The above example uses
                        Omen's Graphical Zmodem to download on COM2.


        PORT = COM2                       

                        You can specify which com port you want to use inside your
                        agenda file.  Valid ports are: COM1, COM2, COM3 and COM4


        SPEED = SLOW

                        This tells AutoNet what speed you want to run at.  Valid
                        speeds are: SLOW, MEDIUM, FAST, SNAIL


        PROVIDER = NETCOM

                        This tells what provider you are using (so AutoNet knows what
                        to expect when loggin in).  Currently, only two providers
                        can be specified: UNICOMP, NETCOM.  All others will default
                        to logging on, waiting for a "login:" prompt, then a "Password:"
                        prompt.  If your provider has a weird menu when you login, or
                        something other than those two prompts, you probably have to
                        write a short script.











=========  SIM2AUTO.EXE  ====================================================

The enclosed program SIM2AUTO converts SIMDIR.EXE output into AutoNet
readable, agenda format.

SimDir.exe is a program that takes the popular file: SIMINDEX.ZIP and
allows reading it, tagging files, and printing output to a file with
your requests.

In case you're not familiar with it, SIMINDEX.ZIP is available on most
large Internet sites.  It's basically an ALLFILES list, that shows what
files the site has available for download.  This is great, because instead
of wandering around the site, looking for decent files, you can download
this MONSTER file, and view it using SIMDIR

Variations include: FILES.IDX, SIMIDX.IDX, SIMIBM.IDX GAMES.IDX and so forth.

They are ALL comma-deliminated files that contain a pathname, another pathname,
a file, size, date/time, and occasionally a description (if you're lucky :-) )

SIMDIR is a viewing utility for SIMINDEX files.  It's available at most
big sites currently as 'SIMDIR22.ZIP'.  Just download that file when you
find it, then wala... you're ready to view SIMINDEX files.

If you're using Windows, you can import SIMINDEX into a spreadsheet, like
MicroSoft excel or lotus.

To use SIMAUTO.EXE, just crank out SIMDIR, and view the latest SIMINDEX
from your favorite Internet site.  Then write your favorite files to
disk using the [F7] option of SIMDIR.

SimDir will spit out a filename (that you chose) listing which files
you want, and what directory they are in.

Now use:
                 SIM2AUTO  [filename] [location]

whereas filename is the file containing your [F7]'d written files from
SIMDIR.  And location is the actual Internet site these files will be
located at.

NOTE:   ALL SIMINDEX files do NOT have the correct path names inside them!
        Most have something like: "/pub" for their first pathname, when actually,
        the files are located in: /msdos/simtel/  or something similar.



Examples:

        Break out SIMDIR, and view the latest SIMINDEX from oak.oakland.edu
        Now when the highlite bar is over a cool file, press [F7] and
        specify MYFILE.1 as the file you want this listing written to.

        Now tag some more files, and they are added to MYFILE.1 !

Exit, then use:          SIM2AUTO  myfile.1  oak.oakland.edu

        Wala.. a new AGENDA.1 file is created that will:
        Go to the Internet site  oak.oakland.edu  and get
        the files you want.

        Doesn't get any easier than that!









=======  SCRIPT COMMANDS   ==================================================

Most script commands are exactly like the regular commands used in
an agenda file.  The commands are:

        wait            see above explanation

        send            see above explanation

        download        see above explanation

        delete          see above explanation

        goto terminal   see above explanation

        RETURN    returns to the original agenda.  (similar to STOP,
                  but merely stops the script file)


See the enclosed FREDLOG.SCR and MYLOGIN.SCR for examples of scripts.








=======  ADVANCED CONFIG  ==================================================

The file ADVANCED.CFG contains all advanced features of Auto-Net that
can be turned on/off.  Do *NOT* use this file unless you are comfortable
and familiar with Auto-Net.  If in doubt, delete the file completely.


ADVANCED.CFG is a simple text file that lets you customize Auto-Net.
The character ';' on the line means it's a comment, and will be ignored.
Also, make sure the first word is LEFT JUSTIFIED on the line.
IE:

YES = BACK UP FILES            is ok
  YES = BACK UP FILES          is not okay



     The format is:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Should Auto-Net use the advanced configuration?

        NO = USE ADVANCED CONFIG
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Do you want to create backup files?

        YES = BACK UP FILES
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Toggle DTR on hangup?

        YES = TOGGLE DTR
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Number of seconds between dial attempts?
        How many seconds should Auto-Net wait
        before it tries to redial?

        2 = SECONDS BETWEEN DIAL ATTEMPTS
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Auto-Net can keep two types of log files:
                VERBOSE  and   SHORT

        VERBOSE = LOG FILE TYPE
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Should we overwrite or append your log files?
          OVERWRITE  and  APPEND  are valid values...

        OVERWRITE = OVER/APP LOG FILES
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Use sound effects when paging you?
        NOTE: If you say 'no', then you will never hear
              if Auto-Net pages you...

        YES = USE SOUNDS
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        What do you want Auto-Net to do if the phone rings?
                HANGUP,   NONE,  or  PAGE ME

        NONE = ACTION ON RING
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Use the status window at the bottom?

        YES = STATUS WINDOW
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        When done, Auto-Net displays final information about the agenda
        that it ran.  Do you want this extra info displayed?

        YES = ADDITIONAL INFO
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        What method do you want Auto-Net to perform for handshaking with
        the Internet provider's modem?  Options are:
                RTS   DTR   CD
        NOTE: Be careful when changing this value

        RTS = HANDSHAKE METHOD
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Check receive errors?

        YES = CHECK RECEIVE ERRORS
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Use defined sites?
        Auto-Net allows you to define your login name, password, timeout
        value, hammering times, and more when FTP'ing to other sites.
        If you want "customized logins" for your favorite sites, then
        answer YES, otherwise, leave it at NO
        READ MORE ABOUT DEFINED SITES AFTER THIS SECTION...

        NO = USE DEFINED SITES
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Hang up string to use?

        +++ATH0 = HANG UP STRING
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        When Auto-Net hammers a site, it will normally try 30 times
        before giving up.  You can adjust that value here.

        30 = HAMMER RETRIES
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Auto-Net hammers a site only if it gets a "login failed"
        message after doing a "anonymous".  Sometimes the site
        may give a "unreachable" or "timed out" message if doing
        maintenance.  If set to YES, Auto-Net will retry when it
        gets those messages.

        NO = HAMMER IF UNREACHABLE/TIMED OUT
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        When starting up, AutoNet checks the specified COM port
        to ensure it's valid.  If you do NOT want it to check the
        port, set this value to NO

        YES = CHECK COM PORTS
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        When AutoNet is getting a file from a site, and the transfer
        times out, AutoNet assumes that the site is REALLY running
        slow, and logs off.  By doing that, AutoNet ensures it won't
        be downloading files for hours and hours from a site who is
        running too slow for comfort.

        YES = BAD TRANSFER KILLS SITE
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        AutoNet sends a "bye" command before an FTP if this is
        set to yes.  Usually, AutoNet sends a bye command only
        to log you off a site.  However, if you're having problems
        with this, turn this to YES.
        NOTE: If your provider uses "bye" as a logoff command,
              do NOT turn this on.

        NO = FORCE BYE COMMAND
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------











    What are pre-defined sites??

By default, Auto-Net logs into FTP sites as 'ANONYMOUS' using your user
id as the password.  If you already have an account with the site,
you probably want to use your OWN name and OWN password.

Also, pre-defined sites let you SCHEDULE the days of the week/days
of the month to log into different sites.  (IE: If you are looking
for the new version of F-PROT virus scanner, you definately don't
want to call EVERY DAY and look for it.  With pre-defined sites,
you can schedule Auto-Net to call F-PROT's site on the FIFTH
of every month, or only on Wednesdays!)


Included in your package is SITEINFO.ANT, which holds your id's
and schedules for different sites.  The format is:

1.      The site's name
2.      your login name
3.      your password
4.      timeout value to use at this site
         (this resets your current TIMEOUT value
          if '0' then the current Timeout value is not changed)
5.      weekday to call the site (1=Sunday, 2=Monday, 3=Tuesday.....7=Saturday)
         (use '0' if you don't want weekdays)
6.      day of the month to call (2, 6, 18, 25)
         (use '0' if you don't want days of the month)



For example:    oak.oakland.edu,dave@freds.net,password,60,3,0
                                                        
   Site name ФФФФФФФФФй            Г              Г     Г  Г Г
             My login nameФФФФФФФФФй              Г     Г  Г Г
                            My passwordФФФФФФФФФФФй     Г  Г Г
                                         Timeout valueФФй  Г Г
                                                           Г Г
      A '3' means I want to call here only on Thursdays ФФФй Г
                                                             Г
      A '0' tells Auto-Net not to use "days of the month"ФФФФй

More examples:


        ftp.funet.fi,john@mynet,password,100,0,0

When Auto-Net logs into ftp.funet.fi, use john@mynet as the login name,
password as the password, and the TIMEOUT value for here is 100 (this
site is kinda slow...).  Do NOT use Weekdays or days of the month.

        ftp.NCTUCCA.edu.tw,drnb@netcom.com,cool,30,0,21

When Auto-Net logs into ftp.NCTUCCA.edu.tw, use drnb@netcom.com
as the login name, cool as the password, use 30 seconds as the
new TIMEOUT value, do NOT use weekdays, and only call if it's
the 21st of the month.

NOTE: If Months and Weekdays are both '0', then Auto-Net will ALWAYS
      call the site (no matter what weekday or month day it is)
      If TIMEOUT = 0 then the current timeout value will be used...










=======  ARCHIE SEARCHES   ==================================================

AutoNet allows doing archie searches via any archie site you want.
To perform a search, use the following line in your AGENDA file:

    ARCHIE [filename]

Whereas filename is the file containing your archie sites, and what
you want to send to the archie server.  All output is captured into
the file:  ARCHIE.CAP 

Here is the format of the archie file:

1.  Archie sites you want searched
2.  A line containing "COMMANDS:"
3.  All the commands you want sent to the archie server
4.  A line containing "RETURN", which instructs AutoNet to return
    to its regular agenda.

Example:         

				archie.funet.fi
				archie.sura.net
				archie.unl.edu
				archie.rutgers.edu
				archie.ans.net
				COMMANDS:
				type sub
				find clinton
				RETURN

This tells AutoNet to telnet archie.funet.fi, and then send
"type sub" and then "find clinton" to the archie server it can
get onto.  If AutoNet cannot log on archie.funet.fi, it goes
to archie.sura.net, etc... until it gets through.

Please see the enclosed ARCHIE.CFG file for a good example.
Also, the enclosed agenda file  ARCHMAIL.1  will show you how to
integrate mailing and archie into your regular agendas. 








=======  MAILING PEOPLE  ====================================================

If you have mail to send, do it automatically!  AutoNet allows mailing letters
without any user input.  And you can mail letters to hundreds of people at a 
time.. ideal for announcements, software releases, etc.

Use the following line in your AGENDA file:

MAIL [filename]

Whereas filename contains your recipients, the subject of the message,
and the actual text you want sent.

Here is the format of a mail file:

1.  The word SUBJECT: following by a space, and the subject of your message
2.  All your recipients
    Each one should have a "TO:", a space, and their mailing address.  The SHAREWARE
    version of AutoNet only allows a maximum of three recipients, so that abuse
    does not occur.  I can see some kid mailing the same hate letter 5,000 times
    to one person.. yuk!  Only three people for now...
3.  A line containing the word "TEXT:"
4.  The actual text you want sent to each person.  You can type up to 120 lines of text.
5.  The word RETURN on the last line, which instructs AutoNet to return to the regular
    AGENDA file.

Example:

			SUBJECT: Testing123
      TO: autonet@unicomp.net
      TO: thedude@autonet.com
			TEXT:
			Hey dude.. what's up?
			I'll be out of town for the weekend with Sarah.
			Give me a call Monday when I get back.
			AutoNet's new MAIL feature is great!			
			RETURN

This sends the lines under TEXT: to drnb@netcom.com and thedude@autonet.com.
The subject of the message is Testing123.

AutoNet uses the VI editor on most Unix systems by sending:  mail [address]
Then ending the message with a '.' 
This may not work on all systems (but should be compatible with most).

Also, the enclosed agenda file  ARCHMAIL.1  will show you how to
integrate mailing and archie into your regular agendas. 




You can send files to any FAX machine by using the following format:

  remote.printer.FIRSTLINE/SECONDLINE@[phone number, backward].tpc.int

The first and second line are the header that will appear on the fax,
and the phone number backward looks like:  5.8.4.1.6.0.6.4.1.2.1
(that's my BBS number 1-214-606-1485)

So to fax my bbs: 
  remote.printer.DAVESMITH/HI_THERE_DAVE@5.8.4.1.6.0.6.4.1.2.1.tpc.int

That huge address would go in the TO: section of your MAIL.CFG, and you
can put anything you want in the SUBJECT section.  Whatever is in your
TEXT: section will appear in the fax.





You can also post to USENET groups by sending the following format:

  groupname@cs.utexas.edu        - use dashes instead of dots in
                                   groupname: alt-binaries-pictures
  groupname@pwd.bull.com

So if I wanted to post a great message to the group: alt.bbs.ads,
I would have a MAIL.CFG like this:

			SUBJECT: AutoNet 
			TO: alt-bbs-ads@cs.utexas.edu
			TEXT:
      Autonet has a new support board:
      The AntiVirus ROCK: 214-606-1485
			RETURN











=======  TOO MANY CONFIG FILES!  ============================================

FINGER allows you to obtain quick information from special fingering
sites, like weather, sports updates, database info, help screens plus
more.


To FINGER in AutoNet, you must first create a FINGER.CFG file that
contains:

        filename.ext = file name


This is what file name you want your finger information captured to.
To finger in a agenda file, it looks like:

        ftp oak.oakland.edu
        cd /pub
        new 10
        finger yanoff@theother.com
        ftp wuarchive.wustl.edu
        cd /pub
          ......

Notice the finger line is exactly like you would normally type it in
on the Internet.  Now the output is captured to your file specified
in FINGER.CFG

Example:  In finger.cfg, you have:

        fing12.cap = file name

Then fing12.cap will contain your information.  Be sure to save it later,
so you don't lose the info.







=======  USENET BINARY FILES  ============================================

Usage:   usenetdl [conference] [filename]

The Usenet messages offer a wealth of binary files free for download.
The BIG pain is combining the 10-15 messages into one main file, 
then UUDECODing the humongous thing, and downloading it to your
computer.

AutoNet simplifies this by doing all that for you!

To begin with, let's go get some pornographic files (yea, yea..
I know.  But there's some good looking women out there)

A sample Usenet conference listing from alt.binaries.pictures.erotica
would look like this:

Philip M. Herman  6  Love them women!
Artrocity!       34  - nikki01.jpg (1/2) {both} "NikkiDial"
Artrocity!       43  - nikki01.jpg (2/2) {both} "NikkiDial"
otariidae         4  Bingo067.jpg {male,black,average}
Philip M. Herman  1  Somebody please post oz-idx02

Ok.. you heard that NikkiDial is a very nice looking woman,
and of course, you gotta see if she looks that hot.
Your AGENDA line should look like:

  usenetdl alt.binaries.pictures.erotica nikki01.jpg

NOTE: The file name is case sensitive.  If NIKKI01.JPG was capitalized,
then you would use: usenetdl alt..... NIKKI01.JPG

That tells AutoNet to get nikki01.jpg from that conference...


To get the file, AutoNet uses the NN newsreader, and marks all
files with the string "nikki01.jpg" in them.  We then UUdecode
the file, and mark it for later download.

There are several problems with this.  If another message contains
that text, it could screw the filesave up (But usually doesn't...
NN newsreader is moderately intelligent in its decoding process)

And.. if the resulting file is NOT named nikki01.jpg then it won't 
be downloaded properly.
I use the BINARY DOWNLOAD almost every day, and have had about a 90%
success rate (which is pretty good!)


Sample Usenet binary conferences are:

alt.binaries.pictures
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.blondes








=======  SOME FANTASTIC INTERNET SITES FOR MSDOS FILES  =====================

My favorite are:

        wuarchive.wustl.edu     - One of the absolute best.  Good luck
                                  in getting on however, since its so
                                  popular
                                  This site has several "mirrors", which
                                  means that all the good files you'll find
                                  here are carried elsewhere, too


        ftp.funet.fi            - My personal favorite.  Plenty of things
                                  to see and directories to wander around
                                  inside!  Lots of games:
        cd /pub/msdos/games/arcade

        oak.oakland.edu         - Very large site, plenty of new files
                                  to choose from.  You can spend a good
                                  hour here just writing down good
                                  directories!
        cd /simtel/msdos/filedocs
        get SIMLIST.ZIP



        NCTUCCCA.edu.tw         - Mirrors a TON of other popular sites,
                                  including wuarchive.wustl.edu and
                                  garbo.

        cd /win3
        get last100uploads


        ftp.uml.edu             - Good games.  Known as one of the
                                  best sites for games, other than
                                  wuarchive.wustl.edu
        cd /msdos/Games
        get games.idx    (GAMES LISTING)


        ftp.orst.edu        - A billion DOOMII files.  If
                              you like the game DOOMII, hang
                              out here.









==============  AUTO-NET AND OS/2  =========================================

To run AutoNet under OS/2, ensure the following settings:


PAREMETERS = /SLOW

WORKING DIRECTORY = (whatever dir you have it in)

Make sure it's a DOS full screen session

COM_DIRECT_ACCESS = ON
COM_SELECT = (whatever com port it's on)
DOS_UMB = OFF
IDLE_SENSITIVITY = 100
INT_DURING_IO = ON


I personally run my AutoNet sessions under OS/2 Warp (3.0) every day,
and it works fantastic.  But since OS/2 is such a moody beast, you
might have to tweak it a little to get the optimum performance.

OS/2 especially has problems receiving characters over the modem
if your DOS session is in a box.  That's why I recommend full
screen for DOS sessions.











==============  THE INTERNET IS BUGGY!  =====================================

If you use the Internet recently, you'll notice its buggy and highly
unreliable.  Unlike most bulletin boards, it WILL lock up, not respond,
time itself out, sit there for no apparent reason, take forever to
sometimes transfer a file, etc.

Do NOT blame this program for things it obviously cannot account for,
like unexpected prompts, weird error codes, and other maladies.







========   WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS   ==========================================

In the future, AutoNet will be able to:

        Process duplicate files, so you don't look through the same
        file list over and over and over.

        Plus MORE!  Give me your suggestions:

1. Overview of AUTO-NET Internet Automation

        What is AUTO-NET?

        Welcome to the world of automation!  For years, people have
        been calling the Internet with elaborate Windows interfaces,
        FTP'ing around, looking at files, and spending needless hours
        staring at the computer.

        People sit at the gopher sites, blind as a bat, not realizing
        that MILLIONS of files await them via the FTP.

        One problem however:  IT TAKES TIME!

        In fact, it takes forever...  let's face it, the Internet is
        by far not a fast and efficient interface.  No pretty menus,
        no reliable data transfer, no immediate access to files, and
        by far not predictable.

        Here comes Auto-Net: reliable automated file transfers, new
        file searches, file retrieval, download, ftp and MORE.
        Don't sit in front of the computer for HOURS looking for new
        files, or that special file somewhere.. Let AUTO-NET do the
        work for you!


2. How it works

        Auto-Net calls your Internet host, logs in, then heads
        out and does your requested agendas.

        Agendas include:


                ftp [site]

                        Go to a FTP site on the Internet.  Once there,
                        you can obtain new files, download a file, and
                        change directories.
                        The logic involved here is:

        SEND A 'FTP [site]' AND WAIT.  If we timeout, send a CONTROL-Z
        and log out with the "ugly method".  A simple 'BYE' will not work
        here, because most times, the site has completely lost track of
        what its doing.  It just sits and does nothing, and will eventually
        timeout itself.. but we won't wait for that long process.
        If we get a 'NAME?' prompt, or a 'PASSWORD', we will answer of
        course.  But another time out, and we will definately send a
        CONTROL-Z.


                cd /[directory]

                        Change to a directory on the Internet site.

        If we cannot change to the directory, then obviously, we cannot
        process a 'new' or 'GET' command.  Therefore, we skip those
        following commands, and go to the next directory or FTP.


                get [filename]

                        Transfers a file to your local work area.  Auto-Net
                        later downloads the file to your computer via DSZ.COM

        We should immedately get some hash marks '#'.  If we get one, then
        the timeout value is reset.
        THE TIMEOUT VALUE IS VERY LARGE HERE, since most files are
        moderately large, also.
        A timeout during the file transfer will usually botch up a session,
        since, if you send a CONTROL-C, most sites will log you out.  And
        of course a CONTROL-Z will knock you off the site.
        Any suggestions will be appreciated about how to get around this
        problem.


                new [number of new files]

                        Gets a list of the last # of files in a directory
                        on a FTP site.  This is fantastic for getting the
                        latest game files, .GIFs, etc from good sites on
                        the Internet.

        To obtain the list, Auto-Net uses the Internet command 'LS -LT'
        then reads in the first XXX number of files.








===========  SOME SUGGESTIONS  ==============================================

Here are the ways I personally use AutoNet:

        Since I run a bulletin board, I want some great new files, every
day.  Right now, the game DOOM is very popular, so search for the newest
DOOM files from infant2.... site (listed above) on Monday and Friday.
I search for utility files on Tuesday and Thursday, and i check for new
games every other day.

My AGENDA.1 files look like:

        ftp NCTUCCCA.edu.tw
        cd /PC/wuarchive/gameutil
        new 10
        cd /PC/wuarchive/sounds
        new 20
        cd /PC/wuarchive/cdrom
        new 6
                         .. etc etc etc...
        STOP

When I find a file that looks interesting, I stick it in my TO DOWNLOAD
section the following day:

        ftp NCTUCCCA.edu.tw
        cd /PC/wuarchive/gameutil
        get cheat75.zip
        get bust11b.zip
        get game_demo.exe
        cd /PC/wuarchive/sounds
        get OUCH.wav
        get toobad.wav
        cd /PC/wuarchive/cdrom
        get SIMLIST.ZIP
        STOP

If the file contains a FILE_ID.DIZ or DESC.SDI, I immediately virus
scan it, then import it into my board.  The other files, I trash.
I can usually average 20-60 new files every day, but my AGENDA.1
file becomes HUMONGOUS sometimes  :-)

A great thing to do is have several files: MON.1 TUE.1 WED.1, etc...
then use:  COPY MON.1 AGENDA.1  or COPY TUE.1 AGENDA.1 depending on
which day it is.  That way, you can do a new file scan every day,
and search for different stuff every single day of the week.

If I KNOW the Internet will be slow and sluggish during the time
I will run my agenda, I use:  AUTONET /SLOW  to ensure the damn thing
doesn't time out every five seconds.

But if it's early in the morning, and the Internet is running real
good, I use:  AUTONET.EXE   with no arguments.  That sticks it in
FAST mode, and it really hauls butt!








=============  KNOWN BUGS  ==================================================



REMEMBER:  The Internet (and AutoNet) is CASE SENSITIVE.  You cannot
           convert something to lower/upper case.. leave it the way
           you found it!

           Print out the examples, and follow them closely.
