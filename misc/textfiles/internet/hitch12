                     Hitch Hikers Guide To The Net
           Episode 12 - Life, The Net, and Everything Part 2

(Ralph, the 'Video Testament' is just about to explain Life, the Net,
and Everything to the crew of the Infinity)

Gillian:    Tell us, what does all this neo-Nazi stuff have to do with
            the Net.

Arnold Lint:I don't think I want to know.

Martin:     Me neither.

Rod:        Quiet.

Xaphod:     Go on . . .

Ralph:      Anyway, Kubla Konthemasus' followers were doing great.
            Anything they showed on TV was immediately accepted as
            truth. Disco became an overnight sensation, and then was
            phased out when the profit wasn't great enough. It was soon
            realized that there was a significant group of people in
            computer related fields who possessed considerable wealth.
            It was also realized that these people were not being taken
            in by the video blitz.

Arnold Lint:Good for us!

Martin:     Not really, I'm afraid.

Ralph:      Very perceptive, robot. Konthemasus' research showed that
            hackers do not believe what they see or hear, unless it
            comes across a computer terminal. It was fast becoming
            apparent that computers would be vital to the power of the
            new regime, so it was vital that anyone who worked with
            computers could be controlled.

Gillian:    Yes, but what does that have to do with the Net? The Net is
            an exchange of ideas and ideals between computer
            professionals!

(Martin starts coughing sarcastically)

Ralph:      Kubla Konthemasus, in a brilliant stroke, figured out a way
            to not only carry out an experiment in behavioral psychology
            on the computing professionals, but also to put into action
            all his findings. He created the Net. You see, there are a
            few key links in the Net controlled by his men. At first
            they tried a variety of topics and tested reactions. Then
            they started trying to bend the opinion of Net-landers.
            First by trying to get everyone to like current trends in
            music, then by trying to create the impression that North
            Dakota does not exist. Anyone who rejected the ideas they
            tried to push, and was fool enough to say so, was put onto a
            list. This list will be used to purge the society of all
            those who would corrupt the purity of essence of
            Konthemasus' new order of conformity and religious
            fulfillment.

Xaphod:     Wow, that's unbelievable.

Rod:        Yah, I don't think I do believe it.

Arnold Lint:Me neither . . . An actor in the white house? . . .  No
            North Dakota? . . . Couldn't happen!

Gillian:   I don't know, maybe . . .

Ralph:      Well, that's about it. I've got to go, lots to do.

Rod:        What could a book have to do?

Ralph:      About an ounce of cocaine!

(With that, Ralph vanishes into thin air. The crew of the Infinity is
left standing, dumb founded by what they have heard. They start to leave
and come to the door. There is a moment of hesitation.)

Gillian:    If anyone of you open the door for me, I'll put the boot in.

Arnold Lint:What's with her.

Rod:        She's an ERA.

Arnold Lint:A what?

Xaphod:     ERA - An Extra Rights Activist.

According to "The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Net", the Extra Rights
Activists group was started by a group of women who were quite upset by
their station in life. They didn't just want equality, they wanted
superiority. They figured they could get all the privileges of equality
with men, and yet retain all the conveniences regarded them as women.
They wanted equal pay for less work, lower taxes for women, shorter work
hours. After all, the fairer sex shouldn't have to work so hard, but
they do deserve the same pay. They didn't want to join the army though.
They felt that in some cases, where it was convenient, men could still
have it all. The one thing you could do to make an ERA mad was to hold
the door for her. They took it as a sign of harassment . . . no one
knows why. Other acts of courtesy were also mistaken as antagonizing the
ERA movement. Helping an ERA with her coat was the same as telling her
she smelled like bathroom at the National Food Poisoners Convention.
Helping an ERA with her chair in a restaurant was tantamount to clubbing
her about the head with a moldy Albatros.  In response to this threat to
male dominated society, the all-male anti-ERA faction MCP (Male
Counter-ERA Pact) circulated a pamphlet explaining what a man could do
if the woman he was with gave any indications of trying to open the door
before he could open it for her. It read as follows:

 =====================================================================

               ** How not to hold the door for an ERA **

If the woman you are with starts to race for the door so she can open it
for herself, and this upsets you, here are a few things you can do to
make sure it won't happen again.

*    Just as she gets up to speed, trip her from behind.

*    When she has a large enough lead, and has the door open, stop to
     tie your shoe.

*    If there is a convenient doorway (like a men's room) nearby, wait
     until she isn't looking and duck in as she opens the door.

*    If she is holding the door, take hold of it as you enter the
     doorway and close it behind. Locking it is a sure-fire clue to her
     that you are displeased.

*    If there is a long corridor before the offending door, and she
     starts to speed up, keep pace with her. When you both hit a dead
     run, body check her into the wall. A well timed 'Ooops' will make
     it all look innocent. This is dangerous if you are with a lady
     roller derby player.

*    If you really don't care about offending her, give her a quick feel
     just as she turns away from you to head for the door. Of course,
     she may never turn her back on you again.

Remember, there is nothing wrong with being courteous. But if she won't
take it gracefully, make it bloody inconvenient for her to keep doing
so.

 =====================================================================

The ERA movement, surprisingly, took no action against the MCP. Rumor
has it that they settled the debate in some non-violent manner. History
notes that there followed a sudden increase in the sale of plastic drop
clothes and corn oil followed by a sudden increase in births about 9
months later.
