DATAPAC 3101  ITI PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION
===================================================

     THE FOLLOWING WILL PROVIDE IN MORE DETAIL A DESCRIPTION OF ITI (84)
PARAMETERS FOR DATAPAC 3101.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

INTERNATIONAL PAD PARAMETERS

1)ABILITY TO ESCAPE FROM DATA TRANSFER STATE*


     THE SETTING OF THIS PARAMETER ALLOWS THE USER TO INTERRUPT THE
COMMUNICATION
OF HIS OR HER APPLICAION (DATA TRANSFER MODE) AND INTERACT WITH THE
PAD (COMMAND MODE).  THE CHARACTER TO DO THIS IS CONTROL P. TO RETURN
TO DATA TRANSFER MODE, PRESS THE CARRIAGE RETURN OR ENTER A BLANK COMMNAND LINE
IF THE USER WANTS TO SEND A CONTROL P TO THE HOST, WITH THIS PARAMETER SET
TO ONE,
SIMPLY HIT CONTROL P TWICE AND THE SECOND CONTROL P WILL GO TO THE HOST AND
THE USER WILL REMAIN IN DATA TRANSFER MODE. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO THE USER DATA
FIELD IN THE CALL REQUEST COMMNAND LINE.

      PARAMETER NUMBER:  1
      POSSIBLE VALUES:   0 = ESCAPE NOT POSSIBLE
                         1 = ESCAPE IS POSSIBLE

     * NOTE:  ESCAPE FROM DATA TRANSFER MODE MAY ALSO BE POSSIBLE USING
THE BREAK SIGNAL IF PARAMETER SEVEN IS SET TO EIGHT.

2)ECHO*

     THIS PARAMETER INDICATES TO THE PAD WHETHER OR NOT THE TERMINAL
INPUT DATA MUST BE ECHOED.  THIS MAY BE REQUIRED IF THE USER"S TERMINAL
CANNOT ECHO BACK WHAT IS BEING ENTERED.

      PARAMETER NUMBER:  2
      POSSIBLE VALUES:   0 = NO ECHO
                         1 = ECHO
     * NOTE:  ECHO WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE SETTING OF PARAMETER 20.

3)SELECTION OF DATA FORWARDING SIGNAL

     THIS PARAMETER INDICATES TO THE PAD THE SET TO TERMINAL GENERATED
CHARACTERS OR CONDITIONS THAT WILL CAUSE DATA TO BE FORWARDED TO THE
DESTINATION.  FOR EXAMPLE (CR) CAN BE USED AS A DATA FORWARDING SIGNAL.
ON RECEIPT OF A (CR) FROM THE LOCAL DTE Y, THE PAD WILL FORWARD ALL
CHARACTERS IN IT'S BUFFER TO THE REMOTE END INCLUDING THE (CR).  IF
P13 IS SET TO 6,7,22 OR 23, A (LF) WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE PACKET AND
WILL DELIMIT IT.  DATA IS ALSO FORWARDED WHEN THE BUFFER IS FULL WHETHER OR
NOT A FORWARDING CHARACTER IS RECEIVED.

      PARAMETER NUMBER:  3
      POSSIBLE VALUES:   0 NO DATA FORWARDING SIGNAL
                         2 = FORWARD ON CARRIAGE RETURN
                         2 = CARRIAGE RETURN
                         126 = ALL CHARACTERS IN COLUMNS 0 AND 1 OF ASCII
                               TABLE AND THE CHARACTER DEL OF
                               INTERNATIONAL ALPHABET #5 (SEE APPENDIX 1)

4)SELECTION OF IDLE TIMER DELAY

     THIS PARAMETER IS USED TO DETERMINE THE IDLE TIMER LIMIT VALUE
WHEN DATA FORWARDING IS BASED ON TIMEOUTS. TO OPTIMIZE PACKETIZING OF
DATA, NO DATA FORWARDING SIGNAL NEED BE SPECIFIED.  THE PAD WILL THEN
PACKETIZE DATA BASED ON PACKET SIZE SPECIFIED (256 OR 128 CHARACTERS).
THE IDLE TIMER IS USED TO SEND ANY PACKETS THAT ARE NOT FULLY FILLED.  IF
IDLE TIMER IS ACTIVATED AND THE HOST REQUIRES THE (CR) TO INPUT DATA, IT STILL
MUST BE PROVIDED BEFORE THE DATA SENT IS ACCEPTED BY THE HOST.  THE IDLE
TIMER DOES NOT SEND ANY EMPTY PACKETS.


     PARAMETER NUMBER:  4
     POSSIBLE VALUES: 0 = NO DATA FORWARDING ON TIMEOUT IS REQUIRED
                  1-255 = INDICATES THE VALUE OF THE DELAY IN TWENTIES
                          OF A SECOND.  (IE. A VALUE OF 250
                          MAKES THE TIMER WAIT 10 SECONDS).

* NOTE:  WHEN EDITING IS ON (P15:1), THE IDLE TIMER IS INACTIVE.
IF THIS IS THE ONLY DATA FORWARDING CONDITION, TURNING THE EDITING
FUNCTION ON COULD CAUSE A USER TERMINAL TO HANG OR DATA NOT TO BE
FORWARDED.

5)AUXILIARY DEVICE CONTROL*

     THIS IS USED FOR FLOW CONTROL OF DATA COMING FROM EITHER A PC OR
 AUXILIARY DEVICE, EG., A PAPER TAPE MACHINE.  WHEN SET TO 1 IT
INDICATES TO THE PAD THAT THE DATA IS TO BE READ AN AUXILIARY I/O DEVICE.
CONNECTED TO THE TERMINAL.  THIS PARAMETER SET TO 2 INDICATES THAT THE
DATA IS COMING FROM AN INTELLIGENT DEVICE, IE. A PC. AND THAT THE PAD MUST
EXERT FLOW CONTROL DIFFERENTLY.

      PARAMETER NUMBER:  5
      POSSIBLE VALUES:   0 = NO USE OF X-ON/X-OFF
                         1 = USE OF X-ON/X-OFF FOR AUXILIARY DEVICES
                         2 = USE OF X-ON/X-OFF FOR INTELLIGENT TERMINALS

     * NOTE:  A VALUE OF 2 IS RECOMMENDED FOR PC'S

6)SUPPRESS NETWORK MESSAGES

     THIS PARAMETER INDICATES THE PAD WHETHER OR NOT NETWORK GENERATED
MESSAGES ARE TO BE TRANSMITTED TO THE TERMINAL.

      PARAMETER NUMBER:  6
      POSSIBLE VALUES    0 = SUPPRESS MESSAGES
                         1 = TRANSMIT MESSAGES

                         1 = INTERRUPT (REMAIN IN DATA TRANSFER MODE)
                         2 = RESET (REMAIN IN DATA TRANSFER MODE)
                         4 = SEND AN "INDICATION OF BREAK" MESSAGE TO
                             THE PACKET MODE DTE (REMAIN IN DATA TRANSFER
                             MODE)
                         8 = ESCAPE FROM DATA TRANSFER MODE, (IE, ENTER
                             COMMAND MODE)
                        16 = DISCARD OUTPUT TO TERMINAL ACTIVATE
                             PARAMETER 8 (P8:1) (REMAIN IN DATA
                             TRANSFER MODE)
                        21 = A COMBINATION OF 1,4 AND 16


     * NOTE:  THE BREAK SIGNAL IS IGNORED IF THE VIRTUAL CIRCUIT IS NOT
ESTABLISHED.WHILE IN COMMAND STATE.  THE BREAK SIGNAL WILL DELETE THE
CURRENT LINE.

1 THE VALID VALUES FOR P 7 ARE 0,1,2,8 AND 21.

8)DISCARD OUTPUT

     THIS PARAMETER IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH PARAMETER 7.  DEPENDING
UPON THE BREAK PROCEDURE SELECTED, THIS PARAMETER MAY BE SET BY THE PAD
WHEN THE TERMINAL USER REQUESTS THAT TERMINAL DATA BE DISCARDED. THIS
PARAMETER MUST THEN BE RESET BY THE DESTINATION COMPUTER TO ALLOW NORMAL
DELIVERY.  THE PAD WILL DISCARD ALL PACKETS DESTINED FOR THE TERMINAL
FROM THE TIME THE PAD SETS THIS PARAMETER (IE, IT RECEIVES A BREAK SIGNAL
WHEN PARAMETER 7 IS SET TO 21) TO THE TIME THE PARAMETER IS RESET BY THE
DESTINATION.  IT CAN ONLY BE RESET BY THE DESTINATION.

      PARAMETER NUMBER:  8
      POSSIBLE VALUES:   0 = NORMAL DELIVERY OF OUTPUT TO TERMINAL
                         1 = DISCARD OUTPUT TO TERMINAL


9)PADDING AFTER CARRIAGE RETURN

    THIS PARAMETER IS USED TO SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF PADDING CHARACTERS TO

                               HIGHER SPEEDS, IN COMMAND MODE ONLY.
                               (NO PADDING IS DONE IN DATA TRANSFER MODE)
                     1-255 = THE NUMBER OF PADDING CHARACTERS TO BE
                             INSERTED IN BOTH DATA TRANSFER AND COMMAND
                             MODE.
10)LINE FOLDING

     THIS PARAMETER INDICATES THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PRINTABLE CHARACTERS
THAT CAN BE DISPLAYED ON THE TERMINAL BEFORE THE PAD MUST SEND A
FORMAT EFFECTOR (IE.,<CR><LF>).  THIS PERMITS MORE DATA TO BE
TRANSMITTED IN ONE PACKET WHILE STILL LETTING THE USER PRINT OUT
MORE THAN ONE LINE, IE., PRINTING OUT FORMS.

11)TRANSMISSION SPEED (READ ONLY)

     THIS PARAMETER IS SET BY THE PAD AS A RESULT OF TRANSMISSION SPEED
 DETECTION IF THE TERMINAL ACCESSES AN AUTOBAUD PORT.  WHEN A PRIVATE
PORT WITH FIXED SPEED IS USED, THIS PARAMETER IS SET BASED ON THE
 PRE-STORED INFORMATION SELECTED AT SUBSCRIPTION TIME.

      PARAMETER NUMBER:  11
      POSSIBLE VALUES:    0 = 110 BPS
                          2 = 300 BPS

                          4 = 2400 BPS

12)FLOW CONTROL

     THIS PARAMETER ALLOWS THE TERMINAL USER TO SIGNAL THE PAD THAT THE
TERMINAL CANNOT RECEIVE ANY MORE DATA, IE. TO FLOW CONTROL DATA COMING
FROM THE NETWORK.  WHEN IT IS SET TO 1, THE TERMINAL USER CAN REQUEST
THAT THE PAD STOP SENDING DATA BY TRANSMITTING A "CONTROL S".  THE
PAD THEN SUSPENDS TRANSMISSION OF DATA UNTIL A "CONTROL Q" IS RECEIVED.

      PARAMETER NUMBER:  12
