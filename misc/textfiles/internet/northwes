               NORTHWESTNET ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY
 
 
 
NorthWestNet is a regional data communications network serving a
consortium of universities and research groups in the northwest-
ern part of the United States.  Its goals are summarized in the
Articles of Incorporation for the Northwest Academic Computing
Consortium, Inc.  All use of NorthWestNet facilities must be
consistent with the goals and purposes of NorthWestNet.  The
intent of this statement is to describe certain uses which are
consistent with the purposes of NorthWestNet, not to exhaustively
enumerate all such possible uses.
 
Some acceptable uses of NorthWestNet facilities include:
 
    o  use for scientific research or instruction at member and
       associate member institutions through the provision of
       high-speed data communications;
 
    o  use as a vehicle for scholarly communications;
 
    o  use as a means for NorthWestNet members to access remote
       computing resources for the purpose of scientific
       research or instruction.  Notable examples of such
       resources are the NSF supercomputing facilities;
 
    o  use necessary to support other acceptable uses.  For
       example, administrative communications which are part of
       the support infrastructure needed for research and
       instruction are acceptable.  Similarly, communications
       directly between non-member institutions in support of
       research or instruction at member institutions is
       acceptable;
 
    o  use required by agreements with NSF, the primary funding
       agency for NorthWestNet;
 
    o  use by member institutions as a laboratory for research
       and experimentation in computer communications, where
       such use does not interfere with production usage.
       However, any experimental use requiring modification to
       router software or protocol layers below ISO layer 4
       requires prior review by the Technical Committee.
 
In general, commercial and general administrative use are prohib-
ited.  Use for scientific research or instruction at non-member
institutions and at for-profit institutions may or may not be
consistent with the purposes of NorthWestNet, and will be re-
viewed on a case by case basis.
 
Use of NorthWestNet for any illegal purpose, or to achieve
unauthorized access to systems, software, or data is prohibited.
 
NorthWestNet is a production communications network on which many
researchers depend.  Uses that significantly interfere with the
ability of other users to make effective use of the network are
not acceptable.
