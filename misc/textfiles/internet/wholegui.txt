                         Chapter 1: Computational Resources


            This section lists computational resources on the  Internet:
            centers or particular machines that serve users with special
            computing requirements.  A good example of such  a  resource
            is a supercomputer center.

            national  supercomputer  centers  funded  primarily  by  the
            National Science Foundation.   Its  mission  is  to  provide
            supercomputer  time to scientists and researchers around the
            country.  SDSC is located on the campus of the University of
            California at San Diego and is administered by General Atom-
            ics.  Major policy guidance comes from a steering  committee
            representing  the  25  SDSC  consortium  institutions, which
            include major California universities and  all  campuses  of
            the  University  of  California  and  the  California  State

            These systems are available 24 hours a day, 7 days  a  week,
            except  during scheduled maintenance and system development.
            In 1988, these systems were  available  nearly  97%  of  the
            time.

            Two printed manuals (An Introductory  User  Guide  and  Sum-
            maries)  are  mailed  to all new users. Two-day introductory
            workshops are held approximately once per month on-site  but
            are  also  available  at your location with confirmed atten-
            dance of at least 20.  Other sources of information  include
            SDSC's  monthly newsletter, Gather/Scatter, an annual report
            of science highlights, more than 130 online  documents,  and

            How to apply for time.   31,000  CPU  hours  each  year  are
            available for academic and industrial use.  Most of the time
            is allocated at no charge to researchers  on  the  basis  of
            peer  review by the SDSC Allocation Committee or by the SDSC
            consortium institutions.  Allocations by the  committee  are
            made  independent  of  institutional  affiliation or funding
            source.  The projects must be non-proprietary.  Applications
            are  accepted four times per year (for 12-month allocations)
            for time beginning 1 January, 1 April, 1 July, or 1 October.
            Applications  must be received at least 45 days prior to the
            quarter in which you request your allocation to begin (e.g.,
            the  deadline  is  15  February for time beginning 1 April).
            For  more  information,  contact  the  SDSC  consultants  at
            (619)534-5100  and request the Overview brochure (which con-
            tains the application form).

            A small fraction of time for allocation is  available  on  a
            non-peer-reviewed  basis to industrial cost-sharing partici-
            pants.  Such projects may be proprietary but must be unclas-
            sified.   For  more  information,  contact  Bob  Randall  at
            (619)534-5060.

            The Center for Experimental Research in Parallel Algorithms,
            Software  and  Systems  (CERPASS)  provides  an experimental
            facility for researchers on the Internet.

            The Center's parallel computing resource includes a  Connec-
            tion Machine CM-2 and a Symult Series 2010.

            The Connection Machine Model CM-2 is  a  massively  parallel
            SIMD  machine.  Its hardware consists of 16,384 data proces-
            sors interconnected via a hypercube network.  Each processor
            has  a bit-serial ALU and a 64K-bit local memory.  This CM-2
            has two front-end subsystems -- one VAX 6210 and one Symbol-
            ics  3600,  a  5-Gigabyte  mass storage system and a graphic
            color display device.  Half of the machine (i.e., 8,192 pro-
            cessors)  is  also equipped with floating-point accelerator.
            Programming languages  available  on  this  machine  include
            *Lisp, C* and Paris interfaces to Commonlisp and C.

            The Symult S2010 is a  message-passing,  distributed  memory
            MIMD  machine.   Its  hardware  consists of 32 computational
            nodes. Each node has a 32-bit Motorola 68020  microprocessor
            as  its  CPU, augmented by the Motorola 68881 floating-point
            coprocessors.  Each node has 8MB local memory, and  is  con-
            nected  with  other  nodes  via a high-speed message-routing

            The CHPC provides access to a  CRAY X-MP/24, currently  run-
            ning  the COS 1.16 operating system.  Pre- and post-job pro-
            cessing, including access service for  interactive  jobs  is
            provided  by  a  VAX  8600, currently running VMS 5.1.  File
            service is provided by an IBM 4381, currently running MVS/XA
            2.2.0 and DFHSM.

                 In October of  1988,  a  second  CRAY,  the  CRAY  X-MP
            EA/14se  was installed with the UNICOS 4.0 operating system,
            to provide users with a migration vehicle to  UNIX.   Simul-
            taneously, a CONVEX C120 was installed to provide UNIX-based
            access service to both the new CRAY  X-MP  EA/14se  and  the
            earlier-installed CRAY X-MP/24.  The IBM 4381 currently pro-
            vides file service for the UNICOS CRAY  that  now  runs  the
            UNICOS  5.0  operating system.  VMS-based access service for
            the UNICOS CRAY is provided by the VAX 8600.

                 The UT System Board of Regents  has  approved  a  major
            expansion  of  the  CHPC facility, possibly to begin in Sep-
            tember of 1990.

            The Cornell Theory Center-with  support  from  the  National
            Science  Foundation, IBM Corporation, the State of New York,
            and members of  its  Corporate  Research  Institute-provides
            supercomputing  resources  for  researchers nationwide.  The
            Center's resources include two IBM ES/3090 600J supercomput-
            ers,  staff,  and  related  programs that explore the use of
            experimental parallel architectures.

            Nearly four  thousand  researchers  (including  three  Nobel
            Prize  winners,  fourteen members of the National Academy of
            Science,  and  ten  members  of  the  National  Academy   of
            Engineering)  have  used  the Center's facilities to work on
            more than eight hundred research projects.  This  work,  led
            primarily  by  university  faculty  at more than one hundred
            fifty institutions, represents  a  diversity  of  scientific
            disciplines, from the physical to social sciences.

            The Center's two IBM ES/3090  600Js  each  have  six  vector
            facilities  and a peak performance of 827.6 megaflops.  Each
            has 512 megabytes of memory  and  2  gigabytes  of  expanded
            storage.   The total disk storage capacity is 266 gigabytes.
            The principle operating  system  on  the  supercomputers  is
            IBM's  implementation  of  UNIX, AIX.  Each user application
            may access up to 896 megabytes in AIX.   There  is  software
            support  for vectorization, including a vectorizing compiler
            and vector libraries.  Both interactive and batch modes  are
            provided  in  the  Center's  production environments.  Users
            interested in using parallel computing for their  production

            work are strongly encourged  to  consider  applying  to  the
            Strategic User Program.

            In addition to the production operating  environments,  full
            support  for  communications across the Internet is provided
            via TCP/IP.  Interprocess communications,  including  remote
            logins,  FTP  file  transfer,  and  X Window System are sup-
            ported.  FORTRAN is the primary language; it is supported in
            scalar,  vector,  and parallel modes, with interactive debug
            and execution analysis.  A high-performance  C  compiler  is
            also  available.  Scientific subroutine libraries are avail-
            able, including vectorized versions.   Online  HELP  facili-
            ties,  UNIX  man  pages, and a Cornell set of TUTOR examples
            assist  users.   Graphics  software  supports   both   local
            hardware and remote facilities.  Several well-known applica-
            tion packages and a list  of  software  are  available  upon
            request.

            At Cornell, interactive  graphics  devices  include  TCP/IP-
            attached  workstations.   Hardcopy devices include videotape
            production,  35mm   slides,   plotters,   color   PostScript
            printers,  and X Window System screen-dump printers.  Remote
            researchers can use X Window System screen utilities or Tek-
            tronix  emulation to view images.  Remote users can also ftp
            various types of image files and metafiles to themselves for
            viewing  with  their  own  software.  Graphics software sup-
            ported on the supercomputers includes WaveFront and X Window
            System  in  AIX.  X Window System utilities include xim with
            WaveFront and volume-renderer  interfaces,  gnuPLOT,  and  a
            version of xmovie.

            The Ohio  Supercomputer  Center  (OSC)  is  a  state-funded,
            shared  supercomputer  resource for researchers at Ohio col-
            leges and universities.  Commercial industry uses  the  CRAY
            on  a  cost-recovery  basis.   In  September  1989 a CRAY Y-
            MP8/864 will be available to users.

            The Ohio Supercomputer Graphics Project is a major component
            of  the OSC's program.  The Project has developed a graphics
            visualization toolkit, apE,  for  displaying  and  animating
            results  of  scientific  computation  on  several  supported
            workstations.   This  developing  product  is   commercially
            available through the Center.

            The Ohio Visualization Laboratory (OVL) houses hardware  for
            visualizing  scientific results of projects conducted on the
            CRAY.  The OVL includes high-end (e.g., Abekas,  Pixar,  and
            Stellar)  workstations  and  paper  output  devices; display
            equipment  and  software;  and  video  equipment,  including
            display,   conversion,  and  animation  storage  facilities.
            Users generally come to the  Laboratory  to  use  equipment,
            although much equipment can be used over TCP/IP networks.

                            Chapter 2: Library Catalogs


            A large number of libraries allow access  to  their  library
            catalogs via the Internet.  Such catalogs can be very useful
            for finding uncommon books not available at a local library.
            Once  a  book  is  located, it can often be borrowed by your
            local library through Interlibrary  Loan.   Another  popular
            use of library catalogs is to check citations or references.
            Many catalogs also support more extended  reference  facili-
            ties.

            Please note that  on-line  catalogs  often  have  a  limited
            number of ports. Users are asked not to abuse their access.

            We would like to acknowledge the considerable assistance  of
            Ron  Larsen, Art St. George, and Joe St. Sauver in compiling
            this section.

            The Boston University Online Catalog (TOMUS) provides access
            to over 1.5 million volumes and 2.5 million microforms.  The
            collection  represents  a  majority  of  holdings  for   all
            libraries on campus.

            TOMUS is made by Carlyle Systems Inc. located in  Emeryville
            California.   The system implements a simple keyword search-
            ing strategy  to  locate  information  in  various  indexes,
            author, title, subject, and call number among them.  Records
            can be displayed using several display formats:  brief, nor-
            mal, and full.

            The online help screens are a valuable  tool  for  beginners
            but become unnecessary after several uses.

            the online catalog, but in some cases also  includes  access
            to  other online databases.  Some directors of libraries are
            sensitive to the  added  burden  this  may  place  on  their
            resources, so users are cautioned to use discretion.

            This directory has been assembled through the cooperation of

            The Network Library System (NLS) is the online public  cata-
            log  of the libraries at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
            and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  NLS  supports  a
            separate online catalog for each campus.

            The UW-Madison online catalog contains more than 1.7 million
            titles cataloged since 1976 located in twenty-five libraries
            on the campus and at the Center for  Research  Libraries  in
            Chicago.   This  represents  roughly  fifty percent of their
            collections.  The  UW-Milwaukee  catalog  contains  approxi-
            mately  nine  hundred thousand titles and represents eighty-
            five percent of the general collection.

            Note on keyboard mappings:

            Because keyboard mappings are defined by the tn3270 software
            on  the  client's host computer, we are not able to tell you
            definitively how your keyboard will be mapped.  The  follow-
            ing  chart  shows a selection of the tn3270 keyboard mapping
            used on many UW Madison VAX  computers.   These  definitions
            are also used when accessing NLS via telnet as they are pro-
            vided by the 3270 software on the gateway machine.

            Northwestern  University's  LUIS  online  catalog   provides
            author,  title,  and subject access to approximately 700,000
            bibliographic records, including monographs processed by the
            main library since 1970 and all serials, regardless of date.
            Holdings of the Medical,  Law,  Dental,  and  Transportation
            Libraries  and the United Libraries of the Garrett Evangeli-
            cal and Seabury Theological Seminaries are also included.

            Remote users of Northwestern's LUIS catalog who are familiar
            with  other  NOTIS-based  online  catalogs  will  note  some
            differences in our implementation.  Of  particular  interest
            may  be  NU's  provision  of  cross-references in the online
            catalog, a feature that  is  to  appear  in  the  commercial
            release  scheduled  for  the end of 1990.  This LUIS version
            does not provide keyword/Boolean searching, but  does  offer
            what  we  call  "search  qualification,"  allowing a user to
            limit an author, title, or subject search result by  any  of
            several  elements  present  in  the  precoordinated indexes:
            date, format (e.g., serial, video), other word,  or  holding
            library.   Use of this feature is explained in a help screen
            which may be accessed by typing an ampersand (&).

            LUIS, the Library User Information Service, can be  used  to
            find  bibliographic information, locations, and call numbers
            for materials held by the libraries  of  the  University  of
            Illinois  at Chicago (UIC).  LUIS includes more than 675,000
            titles.  Older  items  in  the  UIC  libraries  may  not  be
            included in LUIS.

            LUIS contains records for all books cataloged since 1976 for
            the Library of the Health Sciences (LHS), and since 1977 for
            the other UIC libraries.   Many  older  books  in  the  east
            campus  libraries  are  also  included: all English-language
            books published since 1968, and virtually all books  in  the
            Architecture, Art, Math, and Science Libraries are in LUIS.

            LUIS also contains LHS audiovisuals cataloged since 1978 and
            selected  government documents at LHS.  Records and holdings
            for all periodicals currently received by LHS, and for  most
            periodicals  currently  received by the other libraries, are
            in LUIS.  Most titles not yet cataloged (including those  on
            order) are also included.

            The MELVYL catalog is a computer-based  library  catalog  of
            more  than  5.5  million  unique book titles representing 11
            million holdings of all libraries in the nine-campus UC sys-
            tem  and the California State Library.  The catalog contains
            records of book and periodical (serial) holdings, and  other
            materials  such  as  maps,  films, musical scores, and sound
            recordings.  Collections strengths include agriculture,  dry
            lands, oceanography, entomology, performing arts (especially
            film and television), photography,  Californiana,  materials
            on Mexico and Central America, 17th and 18th century British
            literature, health sciences, science fiction, and many  oth-
            ers.

            The periodical file, containing  more  than  640,000  unique
            titles  of newspapers, journals, proceedings, etc., includes
            the holdings  of  Stanford  University,  the  University  of
            Southern  California,  the  nineteen-campus California State
            University system, and selected other libraries.

            The MELVYL catalog also includes two article abstracting and
            indexing  files-MEDLINE  and Current Contents.  Use of these
            files, unlike the books and periodicals files, is restricted
            to  the  UC community.  The MELVYL MEDLINE database contains
            the current  five-year  file  of  the  National  Library  of
            Medicine's   MEDLINE   database,   which   includes  article

            LIAS is the online catalog of the Pennsylvania State Univer-
            sity Libraries.  The catalog contains approximately 1.5 mil-
            lion unique titles, representing not only  the  holdings  at
            the main campus at University Park, but also the holdings of
            the twenty campus libraries of the Commonwealth of  Pennsyl-
            vania.   In  addition  to monograph and serial records, LIAS
            provides  bibliographic  access  to  the  maps   collection,
            archive  and manuscript collections, parts of the government
            documents collection, and the  machine-readable  data  files
            available on campus.

            The Harvard OnLine Library Information System (HOLLIS)  pro-
            vides  access to a number of databases including two library
            catalogs.  The  union  catalog  of  the  Harvard  University
            libraries  contains  approximately  two  million records for
            books,  journals,  manuscripts,  scores,  sound  recordings,
            visual  materials,  and computer files in the collections of
            most  of  the  Harvard  libraries.   (While  this   database
            represents  only  a subset of the six million titles held at
            Harvard, it does include most items cataloged  since  1977.)
            The catalog of older Widener Library materials contains more
            than one million short records for books cataloged  for  the
            main research library before 1977.

            RLIN is the information management and retrieval  system  of
            The  Research  Libraries  Group, Inc.  It includes an online
            bibliographic database cataloging the holdings of well  over
            one   hundred  research  libraries,  archives,  and  special
            collections-a total of over forty million records in  August
            1990.   Entries are divided among eight files:  books, seri-
            als, archival materials (e.g., personal papers, governmental
            records),  maps,  music  scores,  sound  recordings,  visual
            materials (e.g., films and photographs), and computer files.
            Smaller  subject-oriented  databases  contain  citations for
            articles in art and architectural  periodicals;  eighteenth-
            century  English-language  publications;  art sales catalogs
            dating from the 1500s to the present; and  research  in  the
            humanities  scheduled  for  publication  within the next two
            years.

            Users search RLIN with  command-line  searches  rather  than
            from  a  menu, by specifying index terms.  Indexes available
            include title, subject, author, conference  or  corporation,
            ISBN,  LC  number,  and  many more; some are specific to the
            file being searched (such as the index to music  publishers'
            unique  numbers  on  sound  recordings  and scores).  Search
            results can be further restricted by language, date of  pub-
            lication, publisher, terms found in notes fields, etc.

            The Internet is home to a wide variety of data archives.  In
            this  section we try to list the more important and the more
            uncommon archives.  In particular, we do not  list  archives
            of  mailing lists, other than those that do software distri-
            butions.  Such archives can be located by asking  the  main-
            tainers of the mail lists.

            The Gene-Server is a mail response facility that will return
            a specific GenBank (tm) entry requested via e-mail.

            Other Services:

            The server  now  distributes  Protein  Information  Resource
            (PIR, also known as NBRF) protein sequence database entries.

            Molecular biology software for Apple  Macintosh,  DOS,  Unix
            and VAX-VMS computers is also available from the server.

            A number of information files (the  R.  Roberts  Restriction
            Enzyme  database; sequence analysis reference, and such) are
            distributed.

            The Matrix of Biological Knowledge Archive-Server files  are
            now available only from this address.

            Electronic mail searching of the protein  sequence  database
            is  available;  you simply send a properly formatted protein
            "query" sequence to a specific address on the server and the
            search  will  be  performed  automatically  and  the results
            returned via electronic mail.

            The server can be accessed via e-mail on the Internet,  BIT-
            NET, and UUCP networks.  The addresses to use are:

                 gene-server@bchs.uh.edu (Internet)
                 bchs.uh.edu!genbank-server (Usenet)
                 gene-server%bchs.uh.edu@CUNYVM (BITNET)

            Please be aware that a mail response program is not  "smart"
            and  can only respond to a limited set of commands.  GenBank
            entries are available by name and accession number only.

            Your request can consist of one of the following:

                 HELP
                 SEND HELP
                 SEND LOCUS genbank_locus_name
                 SEND INDEX index_name
                 SEND ACCESSION accession_number

            "HELP" will result in a small help  file  being  sent  back;
            everyone  should  request  the  help message.  The file will
            contain up-to-date information  about  the  server,  access,
            release  numbers,  and  policies.   The  help  message  also
            includes all index names, so "SEND INDEX" no  longer  works.
            "SEND  INDEX  index_name"  (where "index_name" is one of the
            index files listed in the HELP message)  will  work.   "SEND
            LOCUS   genbank_locus_name"   will  return  via  e-mail  the
            requested locus if it exists, and an  error  message  if  it
            does  not.   Use  the index file in the HELP message to find
            the name of the entry, or use the accession number.

            The server runs every half hour and  will  handle  only  one
            request  at  a  time.  If you want more than one entry, send
            separate requests.

            Note that large GenBank entries (Lambda,  EBV,  tobacco  and
            liverwort  chloroplasts)  may not make it through the thread
            of mailers.  UUCP mailers, in particular, silently enforce a
            limit  of  64,000 characters in a single mail message.  Note
            also that Usenet mail is very unreliable;  you  should  con-
            sult  the "pathalias" database to construct a mail path from
            your machine to bchs.uh.edu.  A local Unix mail  wizard  may
            be able to help.

            IMPORTANT NOTE: "gene-server@bchs.uh.edu" is an  MX  record.
            If  you  have problems reaching that address, ask your local

            The current version of GenBank on the server is Release  64.
            The  server  is  updated  as often as possible given funding
            (none) and  disk  space  constraints.   The  server  may  be
            updated daily in the future.

            Information and software is  exchanged  regularly  with  the
            European  Molecular  Biology  Laboratory (EMBL) File Server,
            but the specific files, syntax, and information vary between
            the two servers.

            The server contains a simple response to someone asking  for
            too  many  loci  or  otherwise abusing the service: it stops
            working for them.

            Questions  can  be  sent  to  davison@uh.edu  (Internet)  or
            DAVISON@UHOU(BITNET).   Requests  to  talk to a human rather
            than a mail response program  should  be  sent  to  archive-
            management@bchs.uh.edu.    By   popular   demand,   archive-
            managment@bchs.uh.edu also works.

            This service is provided  by  the  Institute  for  Molecular
            Biology,  the Department of Biochemical and Biophysical Sci-
            ences, the University of  Houston  Academic  Computing  Ser-
            vices,  and the Office of the Vice President for Information
            Technologies.

            The server is not funded or related in any  with  the  DHHS,
            PHS,  National  Institutes  of Health, or its contractors or
            subcontractors on the GenBank contract.  GenBank is a trade-
            mark  of  the US Department of Health and Human Services, US
            Public Health Service.

            SERVICE is an automatic mail program provided  by  the  NIC.
            It  allows  access  to  NIC online files and information via
            ordinary electronic mail.  This  is  especially  useful  for
            people who do not have access to the NIC via a direct Inter-
            net link.  Users can request publicly accessible  files  and
            searches in the WHOIS database via this server.  Replies are
            batched and sent back overnight.

            SERVICE looks only at the subject line of a message.   These
            are the services currently available:


            HELP          A help message with a list of current services.
            HOST xxx      Returns information about host xxx.  WHOIS xxx
                          can also be used  to  get  more  details  about
                          a host.
            IEN nnn       nnn is the  IEN  number  or  the  word INDEX.
            NETINFO xxx   xxx  is  a  file  name  or  the  word INDEX.

            NICOLAS is a menu-driven network user help system that func-
            tions  both  as  an  information server and an inter-network
            gateway.  As an information server,  NICOLAS  provides  syn-
            taxes for inter-network mail addressing, general information
            about wide-area networks, networking-related "how to" files,
            information  on  current NASA flight projects, and a variety
            of network- and  computer-related  information  of  specific
            interest  to  the  NASA  community.   As an automated inter-
            network gateway, NICOLAS enables users to connect to  DECnet
            or  TCP/IP  nodes,  login  to  their  NASAMail  and GSFCMail
            accounts, connect directly to a number of other online  ser-
            vices  not  normally  available  to  TCP/IP users, perform a
            variety of "yellow  pages"  functions,  and  transfer  files
            between  DECnet and TCP/IP systems and from either DECnet or
            TCP/IP nodes to BITNET nodes.

            The LiMB (LIsting of Molecular Biology  databases)  database
            is  a  computer-based collection of information on molecular
            biology and related databases.  LiMB is intended to  facili-
            tate  locating  and  accessing these databases as well as to
            provide an ``overview'' that will help in developing a  sys-
            tematic,  coordinated  approach to designing, developing and
            maintaining these databases.

            Each entry in LiMB currently consists of 54 fields,  includ-
            ing:  database  staff  names and addresses; database mainte-
            nance hardware and software; scope of coverage and  database
            goals; details about submission and access to the data sets;
            database size; and types of data covered  by  the  database.
            LiMB  entries  are based on questionnaires filled out by the
            database managers or, in the absence of  a  completed  ques-
            tionnaire,  on  secondary sources (e.g., a journal article).
            LiMB is currently maintained in a relational DBMS.

            The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database  (NED)  is  an  ongoing
            project to organize a broad range of published extragalactic
            data into a computer-based central archive designed for fast
            and flexible query via electronic networks.

            The January 1991 version of NED provides  positions,  names,
            and basic data for 132,000 extragalactic objects, as well as
            related bibliographic references and notes from catalogs and
            other  publications.  It forwards to the user, upon request,
            files containing the data retrieved during  a  session.   It
            also  allows users to browse abstracts of recent articles of
            extragalactic interest from five major journals (_A &  _A,  _A_J
            _A_p_J,  _M_N_R_A_S,  _P_A_S_P,  their  Letters and Supplements), and to
            view  the  contents  of  several  major  catalogs.    Future
            releases  will  provide data from the current literature and
            from catalogs, and tools for searching the abstract database
            by content.

            NED is an object-oriented database, meaning that all  infor-
            mation  is  organized  around  a master list of astronomical
            objects (such as galaxies, groups of galaxies,  quasars  and
            radio  sources) obtained from detailed cross-identifications
            among some thirty major catalogs.  Additional  catalogs  are

            You may access the NED service over Internet or  SPAN,  pro-
            vided you have a VT100 terminal or VT100 emulation software.

            On Internet, a connection to IPAC may be  set  up  with  the
            command: telnet ipac.caltech.edu

            From a node on SPAN, use the command:  set  host  IPAC  (The
            absolute SPAN address is 5.857.)

            Once you are connected to IPAC and  prompted  for  a  login,
            respond with: NED

            No password is needed.   From  this  point,  the  system  is
            self-documenting,  especially through the Help utilities and
            the control-h key sequence.  First-time users  may  want  to

            Unidata is a national program to help  universities  acquire
            weather  data  and  to  analyze  and  display those data for
            teaching  and  research.   The  program  is  funded  by  the
            National  Science  Foundation  and managed by the University
            Corporation for Atmospheric Research.  Unidata negotiates  a
            group  contract  with a commercial data-broadcasting firm so
            that universities may receive weather data  at  a  discount.
            Unidata  also  develops and distributes software for captur-
            ing,  analyzing,  and   displaying   those   data   locally.
            Unidata-developed  software  includes the Unidata Local Data
            Manager (LDM), which captures real-time weather data from  a
            satellite  broadcast,  and  netCDF,  a  network-transparent,
            architecture-independent form for  storing  scientifc  data.
            Unidata also distributes applications software developed and
            licensed  by  universities,  such  as  Purdue   University's
            Weather  Processor  (WXP)  and the University of Wisconsin's
            McIDAS-OS/2.

            Archie is a central database for information  about  archive
            sites.  It  speeds the task of finding a specific program on
            the net.  Archie keeps track of UNIX sites; VMS sites may be
            added in the near future.

            Archie is a pair of software tools: the  first  maintains  a
            list  of several hundred Internet ftp archive sites, each of
            which is updated about once a month.  The second tool allows
            outsiders  to  log  onto  the  host  to  query the database.
            Archie also maintains a Software Description Database of the
            names  and  descriptions of various software packages, docu-
            ments, and datasets that are kept on anonymous  ftp  archive
            sites  around the Internet. The whatis command allows you to
            search this database.

            information about various  topics,  including  the  commands
            available  and  how  to use them.  The "raw" listings of ftp
            sites  are  stored  in  compressed  form  in  the  directory
            ftp/archie/listings.   Manual pages for archie are available
            in the directory ftp/archie/doc.  The  file  archie.man.roff
            contains   a   UNIX-style  manual  entry  in  *roff  format;
            archie.man.txt contains the  same  information  preformatted
            for people on non-UNIX systems.

            Users can ask archie to search for  specific  name  strings.
            For  example,  prog  kcl  would  find  all occurences of the

            string "kcl" and tell you which hosts have entries with this
            string, the size of the program, its last modification date,
            where it can be found on the host,  and  some  other  useful
            information.  This example would find archive sites that are
            storing Kyoto Common Lisp.  Complete anonymous ftp  listings
            of  sites  in the database can be obtained via the site com-
            mand; for a list of sites, see the list command.

            There is an electronic mail interface to archie.  To receive
            the  latest  information  on  this  interface,  send mail to
            archie@cs.mcgill.ca with the word help in the  subject  line
            or body.

            If you can't access the manual files via interactive ftp  or
            the   mail-based   servers,   send   a  message  to  archie-
            admin@cs.mcgill.ca asking to receive a copy of the manual by

            If  you  know  of  an anonymous ftp site that archie doesn't
            seem to maintain, or if you have additions or corrections to
            the  Software  Description  Database,  send mail to: archie-
            admin@cs.mcgill.ca.

            "Satellite" archie servers are being set up in  Finland  and
            the  Netherlands  in  order  to lessen the load on the tran-
            satlantic Internet link.

            The maintainers of archie strongly encourage maintainers  of
            anonymous ftp archives to do two things:


            o+    Send additions and corrections to the Software  Distri-
                 bution Database to archie-admin@cs.mcgill.ca.


            o+    Maintain  compressed,  automated,  recursive   listings

            base contains some of the most  current  economic  news  and
            analysis  available  on the region.  Much of the information
            is assembled from unfiltered news sources  originating  from
            Latin  America,  providing  an  ability for organizations to
            understand and monitor the environments in which  they  have
            business  and  research  interests.  Currently, the database
            contains more than eleven  thousand  articles-from  1987  to
            present-with  approximately four hundred new ones added each
            month.

            There are four ways to access STIS.  Choose the method  that
            meets  your  needs and the communication facilities you have
            available.

            electronic  mail  to  Internet  or BITNET addresses, you can
            send a specially formatted  message  and  the  document  you
            request will be automatically returned to you via electronic
            mail.

            _A_n_o_n_y_m_o_u_s _F_T_P. Internet users who  are  familiar  with  this
            file-transfer  method  can  quickly and easily transfer STIS
            documents to their local system for browsing and printing.

            _O_n_l_i_n_e _S_T_I_S. If you have a VT100 emulator  and  an  Internet
            connection  or a modem, you can log on to the online system.
            The online system  features  full-text  search-and-retrieval
            software  to  help  you locate documents and award abstracts
            that are of interest to you.  Once you  locate  a  document,
            you  can  browse  through it online or download it using the
            Kermit protocol, or request that it be mailed to you.

            an  electronic  copy  of every document that is added to the
            system.  This is particularly  effective  for  periodic  and
            time-sensitive publications, such as the _B_u_l_l_e_t_i_n.

            The STIS flyer provides additional information on  accessing
            STIS.   To  obtain  a  copy of the flyer, send an electronic
            mail message to stisserv@nsf.gov.  The Subject field will be
            ignored.   Put  the  following lines in the text of the mes-

            The International Centre for Distance Learning (ICDL), based
            at  the  British  Open University, has an online database on
            Distance Education.  This database has been  developed  with
            funding  from  the British Government's Overseas Development
            Administration to provide an information service to the Com-
            monwealth  of  Learning  (based  in Canada), an organisation
            created by Commonwealth Heads of Government to expand oppor-
            tunities for students in Commonwealth countries through dis-
            tance education.

            There are three sections in the database: Courses,  Institu-
            tions, and Literature.

            The LIDO MAILSERVER for AI literature at the  University  of
            Saarbruecken,  Germany  allows  for the retrieval of biblio-
            graphic information on  AI-related  publications  via  elec-
            tronic  mail.  The references are returned in LaTeX (Bibtex)
            format or in a refer-like format.  As  of  1991,  more  than
            twenty  thousand  documents  are  contained in its database,
            with an annual increase of twenty-five percent.  About  four
            thousand  bibliographic  requests are currently handled each
            year.

            Queries to the  bibliographic  database  may  refer  to  the
            author  name(s),  the  title,  and  the year of publication.
            Substring search and regular expressions (egrep) are  possi-
            ble.   Global  keywords or classification hierarchies cannot
            be accessed.  Users who already have a certain overview of a
            field  will  thus  probably  profit more from the LIDO MAIL-
            SERVER than novices  familiarizing  themselves  with  a  new
            area.

            For more information on this service, send the following  e-
            mail message:

                    To: lido@cs.uni-sb.de
                    Subject: lidosearch info english

            The Medieval and Early Modern Data Bank is a  resource  pro-
            ject  established  at Rutgers University and co-sponsored by
            The Resource Libraries Group, Inc.  Its aim  is  to  provide
            scholars  with  a continually expanding reference library of
            information  concerning  the  medieval  and   early   modern
            periods,  circa A.D. 800-1800.  Because MEMDB is a computer-
            based,  electronic  reference  tool,  it  offers  remarkable
            facilities for immediate information retrieval and manipula-

            In 1989-90 MEMDB will become an on-line system, available to
            subscribers  through  RLG's  Research  Libraries Information
            Network (RLIN).  When MEMDB becomes  RLIN-based  its  master
            data set will be vastly expanded.  MEMDB's scope will extend
            to virtually any scholarly compilation of data that  can  be
            presented  in  a  tabular  form.   New material to be incor-
            porated will include information on such subjects  as  wages
            and  prices,  household  size, mortality, property-holdings,
            charity, and nutrition, drawn from such sources as:

            o+    taxation records

            o+    wills and inventories

            o+    parish records and vital statistics

            WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL is a 4MW DECSYSTEM-20 Model 2065 host
            owned  and  operated by the US Army Information Systems Com-
            mand, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.

            It supports three disk  structures,  named  PD1:,  PD2,  and
            PD3:,  containing  public  domain, shareware, documentation,

            All the files are accessible via ANONYMOUS FTP.  However the
            number of simultaneous ANONYMOUS FTP jobs is limited by time
            of day and day of week to provide reasonable network perfor-

            on the collections in general as well as files  specific  to
            certain collections.

            The MSDOS and  CP/M  collections  are  maintained  by  Keith
            Petersen,  who  makes periodic announcements of new releases
            to the INFO-IBMPC and INFO-CPM mailing lists, respectively.

            The Ada, STARS, and VHDL collections are  maintain  by  Rick
            Conn who announces new releases to the ADA-SW mailing list.

            The UNIX-C collection is  maintained  by  Dave  Curry,  with
            monthly announcements to the UNIX-SW mailing list.

            The MACINTOSH Collection is maintained  by  Bob  Thum,  Stan
            Sobczynski,  and John Mitchener, based on announcements made
            on several Macintosh-related mailing lists.

            The PC-BLUE and SIGM collections  are  maintained  by  their
            respective  organizations  and updated as new volumes become
            available.

            The IBM Supercomputing Program Data Base  is  a  listing  of
            information  concerning  programs  that have been written or
            converted to use IBM 3090  vector  or  parallel  processing.
            The  data  base  is maintained by the Computer Center at the
            University of Illinois at Chicago  with  support  from  IBM.
            Data  provided for each program include the program's appli-
            cation area, name, a  description,  the  environment   under
            which  it  operates, the person to contact for more informa-
            tion and the approximate cost for academic user.   The  pro-
            grams  themselves  are  not available through the data base.
            The data base is referred to as ``supersft'' for ``supercom-
            puting software.''

            This data base is accessible to other  universities  through
            BITNET  and  the Internet.  A LISTSERV virtual machine named
            SUPERSFT has been established at UIC for easy  retrieval  of
            the information.

            Access to the database is open to anyone with  a  BITNET  or
            Internet  connection.   Access  to the programs described in
            the database is controlled by their owners.

            Three files available through this LISTSERV provide informa-
            tion  about  the data base, an index to the data base, and a
            form for submission of information.  To receive these files,
            issue the following commands from a VM system on BITNET:

                    tell listserv at uicvm get supersft help  [for the help file]
                    tell listserv at uicvm get supersft index [for the index]
                    tell listserv at uicvm get supersft form  [for the submission form]

            If you do  not  use  a  VM  system,  send  a  standard  note
            addressed  to  ``listserv  at uicvm'' if you're on BITNET or
            ``listserv@uicvm.cc.uic.edu'' if  you're  on  the  Internet.
            The  note  should contain just the appropriate LISTSERV com-
            mands, such as

                    get [filename1 filetype1]
                    get [filename2 filetype2]

            substituting the names of the files of interest.

            Submissions to the data base can be made  either  electroni-
            cally or by mail.  The information submission form is in the
            file named SUPERSFT FORM mentioned above.

                              Chapter 4:  White Pages


            The Internet supports several databases that  contain  basic
            information about users, such as e-mail addresses, telephone
            numbers, and  postal  addresses.   These  databases  can  be
            searched  to  get  information about particular individuals.
            Because they serve a function akin to  the  telephone  book,
            these databases are often referred to as "white pages."

            WHOIS/NICNAME is a NIC program that provides  an  electronic
            ``white  pages'' of network entities.  WHOIS lists the name,
            network mailbox, US postal address,  telephone  number,  and
            host for all users registered with the NIC.  WHOIS also pro-
            vides information about registered hosts, domains, and  net-
            works,  including  the  names  and  addresses  of designated
            points of  contact,  host  addresses,  and  domain  servers.
            There  are  currently  more  than 75,000 users and points of
            contact registered.

            search for white pages information from the NIC  WHOIS  ser-
            vice,  the  CSNET  WHOIS  service,  the NYSERNet White Pages

            There are three ways to gain access to the Knowbot  Informa-
            tion Service:

            1. Obtain the Knowbot User Service user  interface  program,
            netaddress, for local installation

            2. Telnet to the Knowbot  Information  Service.   Currently,
            there are servers accessible through a telnet to port 185 on
            hosts <nri.reston.va.us>  and  <sol.bucknell.edu>.   From  a
            UNIX  host, use <telnet nri.reston.va.us 185>.  The commands
            help and man summarize the command interface.

            3. Send mail to userid <kis> at one of the Knowbot  Informa-
            tion Service hosts.

            Sesquinet is a regional network in Texas.  It was  organized
            in  1986  specifically  to  fill  the  regional network role
            within the NSFnet scheme.  It has been operational since May
            1987.

            Sesquinet is primarily an IP network, and connects  directly
            to the NSFnet backbone via an NSS at Rice University.

            In cooperation with THEnet we also carry intra-state  DECnet
            Phase IV that can be passed to SPAN/HEPnet.

            Our original and slowest lines are 56kb/s, and these  remain
            the  normative circuit technology for access from individual
            sites.  We are deploying T1 circuits in two ways:

            o+    In cooperation with THEnet, we are building  an  inter-
                 city  redundant  high-speed  backbone.  Initially, this
                 will be a T1 triangle connecting Houston (Rice  Univer-
                 sity),  Austin (the University of Texas at Austin), and
                 Dallas (the University of Texas at Dallas).

            o+    In addition, some individual  sites  are  connected  to
                 this  intercity  backbone  via T1 circuits.  The Baylor
                 College of Medicine is the first to do so.

            USAN (University Satellite Network) is a discipline oriented
            network serving organizations that do research in the atmos-
            pheric and oceanographic sciences. Current members  are  the
            Universities  of  Miami, Oregon State, Penn State, Maryland,
            Wisconsin, and the  Institute  of  Naval  Oceanography,  the
            Naval Research Lab, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.

            The primary use of the network is for  access  to  supercom-
            puter facilities at NCAR. Secondary use is for access to the
            Internet via the NSFnet node and other Internet gateways  at
            NCAR.

            The network is an IP satellite broadcast network with a star
            configuration  with  the center at NCAR. Incoming traffic is
            broadcast at 56Kbits from each node on its own unique  chan-
            nel.  Outbound  traffic is broadcast at 224Kbits on a single
            channel.

            Membership in USAN is not restricted, however  members  must
            share in the operating costs for the network.

            Arizona,  Colorado,  southern  Idaho,  New  Mexico, Utah and
            Wyoming.

            Westnet is a Wide Area Network  operating  at  moderate  (56
            kbps)  and  high  (T-1,  i.e., 1.544 Mbps) data transmission
            capacities, providing connectivity from  end  nodes  to  the
            NSFNet  backbone.  Westnet has connections into the backbone
            at the National Center for Atmospheric  Research  (NCAR)  in
            Boulder,  Colorado,  and  at  the University of Utah in Salt
            Lake City, Utah.  The goal of  Westnet  is  to  provide  the
            regional  infrastructure  to  support research and scholarly
            activity.

            The member organizations are universities, research  labora-

            Institute; and in Utah: the UMC Research Station.

            Westnet interoperates with the state networking agencies of:
            AriZona  Telecommunications Educational Cooperative (AZTEC),
            Colorado SuperNet  (CSN),  and  New  Mexico  Technet  (NMT).
            State  networking  organizations  are  presently  being con-
            sidered in Idaho and Utah.   Westnet  interacts  with  these
            state  networks  to provide access to special resources (for
            example, the NSF Phase  II  Supercomputer  Centers)  and  to
            other  regional  networks  (for example, Northwestnet in the
            northwestern region of the United States).

            The computer environment at the Los Alamos National  Labora-
            tory   (LANL)   is   supported  by  a  multi-security  level
            Integrated Computing Network (ICN)  which  integrates  large
            host  supercomputers,  a  file  server,  a  batch  server, a
            printer and graphics output server and numerous  other  gen-
            eral  purpose and specialized systems.  Among the latter are
            experimental machines such as the Intel Hypercube,  the  FPS
            T-series  machine  and two Connection Machines.  In addition
            to unclassified network access, remote, secure  access  over
            LANL installed encrypted data links is supported for classi-
            fied computing up to the Secret level for NSI, FRD and CNWDI
            information  categories.   Current (August, 1989) production
            host systems include two Y-MP/832s, two  X-MP/416s,  one  X-
            MP/48,  one X-MP/24 and an X-MP/14.  The latter machine runs
            UNICOS while the others run CTSS.

            The NASA Science Network (NSN) is an IP network  which  sup-
            ports scientists and flight projects funded by NASA's Office
            of Space Science and Applications  (OSSA).  The  network  is
            used  to  provide  remote access to such resources as scien-
            tific databases and supercomputing centers.  The  NSN  main-
            tains  hubs at several NASA centers which are interconnected
            in a partial mesh topology. These backbone sites use terres-
            trial  circuits  ranging in speed from 168 to 672 Kbps. From
            these hubs radiate numerous tail circuits; the  majority  of
            these tails are 56 Kbps, with a few at 9.6 Kbps as well.

            The NSN was designed to provide NASA's  scientific  communi-
            ties with a more general networking approach that would pro-
            vide  full  networking  services  in  a   vendor-independent
            environment. These services include file transfer and remote
            logon as well as email.

            NSN is a NASA-wide  network  managed  by  the  NASA  Science
            Internet  Project Office (NSIPO) at Ames Research Center. It
            is used for NASA-funded space science research programs  and
            flight projects.

            Users  include  NASA  sites,  and   government   facilities,
            research,   and   academic   sites   conducting  NASA-funded
            research.

            PREPnet is a mid-level network  serving  Pennsylvania  since
            May  1988  for  purposes  of education, research, technology
            transfer, and economic development within the state.   PREP-
            net  was  initiated through the joint efforts of the govern-
            ment of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Bell Telephone  of
            Pennsylvania,  and  the  PREPnet  consortium of universities
            (Carnegie  Mellon,  Drexel  University,  Lehigh  University,
            Pennsylvania State University, Temple University, University
            of Pennsylvania, and University of  Pittsburgh).   The  Com-
            monwealth of Pennsylvania is the inter-LATA carrier and Bell
            Telephone of Pennsylvania is the network operator, the owner
            of  the  equipment,  and  the  marketing  agent  for network
            access.  Supercomputing  resources  and  a  gateway  to  the
            Internet  (NSFNET)  are provided by the Pittsburgh Supercom-
            puting  Center.   Other  member  institutions  have  made  a
            variety  of information resources available on PREPnet, such
            as university library catalogs, bulletin boards, and various
            other  databases containing statistical, agricultural, demo-
            graphic, economic, and medical data.  The network  architec-
            ture  consists  of  a  T1 backbone connecting hubs in Pitts-
            burgh, Philadelphia, and Allentown/Bethlehem, and a  56-Kbps
            connection to a hub in Scranton.  PREPnet uses the Transmis-
            sion Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).

            SURAnet, the Southeastern Universities Research  Association
            Network, is a project of SURA, the Southeastern Universities
            Research Assocation.  SURA is a consortium  of  universities
            which  supports, manages, and operates projects too large or
            complex to be handled by a single university.

            SURAnet, a TCP/IP network, is one of  the  NSFNET  mid-level
            networks.   8 data lines operate at T-1 speed (1.5 Mbps) and
            the reminder at 56 kbps. A redundant T-1 backbone is planned
            for the near future.

            SURAnet is connected to the NSFNET backbone at  the  Univer-
            sity of Maryland.

            SURAnet's geographic area includes the District of  Columbia
            and  13  states  in  the  southeast  US:  Alabama, Delaware,
            Florida, Georgia,  Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Maryland,  Missis-
            sippi,  North  Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia
            and West Virginia.

            While SURA, the parent  organization,  is  a  consortium  of
            academic  organizations,  SURAnet  members comprise approxi-
            mately two-thirds academic institutions and  one-third  non-
            academic sites.

            UUNET acts as an internet mail relay for its 1,000 subscrib-
            ing  sites.   UUNET provides a proxy ftp service and archive
            service which allows non-internet sites to obtain files that
            are available by anonymous ftp. Currently, UUNET may only be
            accessed via TCP/IP or the UNIX UUCP protocols.

            UUNET IS NOT A GENERAL UUCP/INTERNET GATEWAY (despite common
            delusions).

            be installed in the future.

            NORDUnet is a international backbone that interconnects  the
            Nordic  countries  Sweden (SUNET), Norway (UNINETT), Finland
            (FUNET), Denmark (DENET) and Iceland (SURIS).  It also  pro-
            vides internatinal connections to Major European and US net-
            works.  NORDUnet started real operation in Autumn 1988.

            There are (at least) 4500 IP hosts  and  about  1000  DECnet
            hosts  in  the combined national networks that are intercon-
            nected by NORDUnet.

            The protocols supported as services across the backbone  are
            IP, DECnet, EARN/NJE and X.25.

            NORDUnet   connects   through    service    agreements    to
            Internet/NSFnet,  EARN,  HEPnet and EUnet. Pilot connections
            will be set up to COSINE/IXI X.25 and to EARN OSI.

            NORDUnet is a star with a center at KTH, Stockholm,  Sweden.
            There  are 64-kbit lines to RUNIT, Trondheim, Norway; UNI-C,
            Copenhagen, Denmark and HUT,  Helsinki,  Finland.  There  is
            also  a  64  kbit line to CWI in Amsterdam, Holland and a 56
            kbit line to JvNC, Princeton, USA.

            The (nordic) lines  interconnect  MAC-level  remote  bridges

            CSNET and BITNET merged in the autumn of 1989  to  form  the
            Corporation  for Research and Educational Networking (CREN).
            CSNET continues to supply international  data  communication
            through  TCP/IP  and allied email-only services.  Members of
            CREN/CSNET include universities, colleges, government  agen-
            cies,   nonprofit  organizations,  and  industrial  research
            laboratories in the U.S. and abroad.

            CSNET offers several connection options to serve  the  needs
            of  large  and  small  organizations.   The  options include
            dial-up  delivery  of  electronic  mail,  dial-up   IP-based
            interactive  service, and IP-based interactive service using
            leased telephone and X.25 circuits.

            CSNET also provides technical information to  network  users
            and support services to member organizations.  It operates a
            24-hour telephone hotline and a  "help"  mailbox,  publishes
            CSNET-FORUM (an online newsletter), and distributes documen-
            tation on network use  and  services  by  email  through  an
            automated document server and other automated servers.  Net-
            work users may access the same information by anonymous FTP.

            Network users may register themselves in the CSNET User Name
            Server,  an  automated directory database of users and hosts
            maintained at the CSNET Coordination and Information  Center

            CSNET participates actively in Internet  organizations  such
            as the Federation of American Research Networks (FARNET) and
            working groups organized by the  Internet  Engineering  Task
            Force (IETF).

            Because CSNET offers email-only and dial-up  connections  as
            well  as  full  IP  services,  CSNET  takes  care to provide
            appropriate user and technical services for users  who  lack
            direct connections to the Internet.

            Any member organization may  use  the  support  services  of
            CSNET for technical and user information.  The email servers
            and  anonymous  FTP  files  are  open  to  anyone  with  the
            appropriate  access.   CSNET  members  can exchange messages
            with each other and with users of many  connected  networks,
            including  BITNET,  NSFNET,  Milnet, UUCP, and non-U.S. net-
            works.  Use of the network for purposes other than  research
            and education is not permitted.

            The Commercial Mail Relay service  currently  provides  mail
            relay  functions  between  the Internet and three commercial
            electronic mail systems:  Telemail,  MCI-Mail,  and  DIALCOM
            systems (IEEE-Compmail, NSFMAIL, and USDA-MAIL).

            To send mail via the Commercial Mail  Relay  users  on  each
            system  use their normal mail programs to prepare, send, and
            receive messages.  Messages to be forwarded are sent to  the
            CMR  mailbox  called ``Intermail'' on the local mail system.
            The CMR operates by having a program  service  mailboxes  in
            both  the  local and the destination mail systems.  When the
            right information is supplied either in the ARPA-Mail header
            ``TO'' field, at the beginning of the text of a message, the
            program forwards those messages into the other mail system.

            The Simple Forwarding Header (SFH) method of addressing mail
            for   each   system   follows.   First  send  a  message  to
            ``Intermail@ISI.EDU'', and use one of the SFHs in  the  body
            of the text.

            For Telemail, and the  Dialcom  systems,  we  have  added  a

            In order for a message to be delivered from one of the  com-
            mercial  mail systems to a mailbox in the ARPA-Internet Mail
            system, you must first send mail to the CMR mailbox of  that
            system,  then add the Internet forwarding information at the
            beginning of the text of each message.

            The CMR mailbox address in each system is:

            CMR is a UNIX based system, using the  MMDF  mail  software.
            Any  IP/TCP  organization  may access CMR.  See restrictions
            below.

            The requirement for using CMR is  that  the  work  conducted
            must  be  DARPA  sponsored  research  or other US government
            approved business (or otherwise meet the acceptable use pol-
            icy of DARPA,) only.

            However, DARPA as a member of the Federal Research  Internet
            Coordinating  Committee  (FRICC)  has  agreed to the (draft)
            policy for communication networks that  provides  (in  part)
            that:  ``the member agencies of the FRICC agree to carry all
            traffic that meets the acceptable use  policy  of  the  ori-
            ginating member agency.''

            Thus, e-mail messages  (i.e.,  ``traffic'')  that  meet  the
            acceptable  use  policy  of  an agency and pass through some
            facility of that agency (i.e., ``the  originating  member'')
            on  the  way  to  Intermail or CMR are allowed.  The current
            member agencies of the FRICC are DARPA, NSF, DOE, NASA,  AND
            NIH.

            In the least restrictive case, all bona fide researchers and

            foreign countries (unless denied access by national  policy)
            are allowed access.

            BITNET and UUCP (and other) networks are  interconnected  to
            the  Internet  via  mail relays. It is the responsibility of
            the managers of these mail relays to ensure that the  e-mail
            messages  (``traffic'')  that  enters the Internet via their
            mail relays meets the acceptable use policy  of  the  member
            agency providing the internet access.

            The Terrestrial Wideband Network was built and  deployed  by
            BBN  STC  as  a  part  of  the  initial phase of the Defense
            Research Internet (DRI).  In May 1989, this network replaced
            the  Satellite Wideband Network, which had been in operation
            for the previous 8 years.   The  Satellite  Wideband  was  a
            domestic  3 Mbit/sec network that had been used for research
            into the use of packet satellite technology  to  efficiently
            support  applications  with  varying  delay, throughput, and
            reliability requirements, e.g., interconnection  of  distri-
            buted  operating  system clusters, development of end-to-end
            bulk transfer protocols, multimedia conferencing,  intercon-
            nection  real-time  interactive simulation/training systems.
            The Terrestrial Wideband continues this tradition  by  using
            one  of  the cross-country T1 trunks from the DARPA National
            Networking Testbed (NNT) to support research in  high  speed
            networking,  to  provide  connectivity  among  academic  and
            government sites, and to support a testbed for Internet pro-
            tocol  development  and  experimentation  with applications.
            Currently this network is  carrying  cross-country  Internet
            datagram  traffic associated with DARPA-funded projects.  It
            also supports a research  environment  for  multimedia  con-
            ferencing  and voice/video conferencing using gateways which
            use a real-time connection oriented protocol over a  connec-
            tionless network.

            Access to the Terrestrial Wideband is typically via an IP or
            ST  gateway.  Connection of such a host is at the discretion
            of DARPA.  The current network includes the following  Wide-
            band  Packet  Switches (WPS) and user sites -- BBN (BBN), NY
            (RADC), Washington (DARPA, NRL), Chicago (NCSA),  LA  (ISI),
            SRI  (SRI,  Stanford).   This fall, Ft Monmouth will be con-
            nected to the NY WPS and CMU will be connected to a  WPS  to
            be installed in Pittsburgh.

            The Terrestrial Wideband Network is to be  used  for  DARPA-
            funded  research  and development activities of the Internet
            community.  Users typically access the network via  gateways
            which have Internet connectivity to the Terrestrial Wideband
            Network.  Applications which might  benefit  most  from  the
            Terrestrial  Wideband  Network  are those which require high
            bandwidth and/or low delay  between  geographically  distant
            sites,  such  as bulk file transfer, remote procedure calls,
            conferencing, graphic simulations, and distributed operating
            systems.

            a) System and Network Architecture
                 The  Terrestrial  Wideband  is   currently   a   trans-
                 continental network built on T1 trunks belonging to the
                 National Networking Testbed (NNT).  The Wideband packet
                 switch  nodes  (WPSs)  are  located  at  unattended NNT
                 Points of Presence (POPs).  They are based on Butterfly
                 multiprocessor  hardware  and  are connected via the T1
                 fiberoptic trunks into a backbone  configuration.   The
                 WPSs  pass  network traffic using the Dual Bus Protocol
                 reservation scheme.  Local area networks at user sites,
                 e.g.,  ethernets,  are connected to the backbone packet
                 switches via Internet IP and ST gateways  and  T1  tail
                 circuits.

                 The current topology of  the  network,  which  resulted
                 from  external  constraints,  is  a  series  of  packet
                 switches connected in a line by T1  trunks.   This  can
                 result in partitioning of the network in the event of a
                 packet switch failure.  To minimize outages,  the  Ter-
                 restrial   Wideband   Network   includes  a  number  of
                 features.  The  multiprocessor  hardware  configuration
                 used  for the packet switch provides redundancy in case



            September 27, 1989          NNSC       Section 5.21,  Page 2








                 a processor node fails.  Also, a failsafe box  isolates
                 the WPS upon detection of an outage while continuing to
                 maintain connectivity between the T1 trunks in and  out
                 of the failed WPS, thus maintaining network continuity.
                 The network also allows remote  dial-in  access  for  a
                 number of emergency functions that would otherwise have
                 to be performed by on-site staff.

            b) Operations
                 A remote monitoring  center  provides  network  control
                 capabilities,  and  a dialup capability provides backup
                 monitoring and control when necessary.  The Terrestrial
                 Wideband  Network packet switch software can be updated
                 via remote downloading.  Network operations support  is
                 provided between 8AM and 8PM Eastern time.

            c) Protocols

                 - TCP/IP traffic is supported by the Terrestrial  Wide-
                 band  Network.   This is accomplished by using standard
                 Internet gateways.

                 - Stream Protocol (ST) protocol (based on IEN  119)  is
                 used   between   gateways   which  support  voice/video
                 traffic.  This is a connection-oriented protocol  which
                 operates  over  the connectionless Terrestrial Wideband
                 Network, and allows the gateways  to  send  packets  to
                 other  destinations  with minimal delay, as is required
                 for voice/video conferencing.

                 - Gateways communicate with  the  Terrestrial  Wideband
                 Network  packet  switches   (WPSs)  via the Host Access
                 Protocol (HAP), specified in RFC 907-A.  This is a pro-
                 tocol  by  which  a  host can send datagrams across the
                 network, and can request and manage network bandwidth.

                 -  The  WPS  software  provides  an  echo  host   which
                 responds  to  ICMP ping  packets.

                 - Dual Bus Protocol  provides  a  link-level  transport
                 protocol  which uses a reservation mechanism to provide
                 access fairness for each WPS.  This is a type  of  Dis-
                 tributed  Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) protocol similar to the
                 IEEE 802.6 Metropolitan Area  Network  (MAN)  protocol,
                 but with features that support wide area networking and
                 multimedia conferencing.  Whereas  conventional  packet
                 store  and forwarding would involve per packet forward-
                 ing processing  and  buffering  at  every  intermediate



            September 27, 1989          NNSC       Section 5.21,  Page 3








                 node, a DQDB protocol performs processing and buffering
                 only at the entry point and  minimizes  the  processing
                 and buffering at subsequent nodes along the trunk until
                 the exit point.

                 - Wideband Monitoring Protocol (IP protocol number  78)
                 is used between the WPSs and the monitoring center.

            The ICBNet establishes Internet links  between  the  ARPANET
            and  cooperating  groups  of  researchers within NATO sites,
            providing transit service and a testbed for  joint  NATO  C3
            and interoperability experiments.  These links have replaced
            the old SATNET (Atlantic Packet Satellite Network)  service.
            Point-to-point trans-Atlantic service between the US and the
            UK and between the US and Italy connects  the  ARPANET  with
            local  networks at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment
            (RSRE) and the University College London (UCL), both in  the
            UK,  and at the Italian National Research Council (CNUCE) in
            Italy.   The  Norwegian  Telecommunications   Administration
            Research  Establishment  (NTARE)  accesses  the  network via
            RSRE.  Connections to the SHAPE Technical  Centre  (STC)  in
            the  Netherlands and the Warrior Preparation Center (WPC) in
            West Germany will be added within the next few months.

            The US-to-Europe links are provided via full  duplex  64kbps
            connections  between  a  Butterfly Gateway located at BBN in
            Cambridge, and the Butterfly Gateway at  RSRE,  and  between
            the  Butterfly  Gateway  at DARPA in Arlington, Va., and the
            Butterfly Gateway at CNUCE.

            SWITCH is a foundation, sponsored by the government and  the
            Swiss  universities,  providing  teleinformatics services to
            all Swiss universities and to various research institutes by
            connecting  to  national and international resources. SWITCH
            started operation in October 1988.

            SWITCHlan is a national backbone network which connects  all
            universities   using   leased   lines  with  speeds  between
            128kbit/s and 2Mbit/s.  For routing on these national leased
            lines  SWITCH uses CISCO router-bridges.  The protocols sup-
            ported are DECnet, TCP/IP, X.25 and ISO IP.

            All Swiss supercomputers are connected to SWITCHlan.  Access
            to some library catalogs will become available later on.

            International connections on the network level will go  into
            operation in January 1990:

            -    IP connection to CERN with 128kbit/s.

            -    IP connection  to  the  Internet/NSFnet  with  64kbit/s
                 through INRIA, France to Princeton University, USA.

            A connection to the COSINE/IXI pilot X.25  network  will  be
            realized in the first quarter of 1990.

            BARRNet is the  Northern  California  regional  hub  of  the
            NSFNet,  the National Science Foundation Network.  BARRNet's
            purpose is to facilitate scientific and educational communi-
            cations  using high-performance computer networking technol-
            ogy and wide-area telecommunications utilities, and to  pro-
            mote  collaboration, sharing of information, and wide access
            to computer resources for research and educational purposes.
            BARRNet  was  established in 1986 under a grant from the NSF
            by a consortium of six  members:  Stanford  University,  the
            NASA Ames Research Center, and the Berkeley, Santa Cruz, San
            Francisco, and Davis campuses of the University of  Califor-
            nia.   Since then BARRNet has grown to include several addi-
            tional government and private research laboratories and more
            than twenty-five corporate affiliates.

            Four BARRNet sites-UC  Berkeley,  Stanford  University,  the
            Lawrence  Livermore  National  Laboratory, and NASA Ames-are
            connected in a ring by data circuits  running  at  T1  speed
            (1.544  Mbps).   UC Davis, which is connected to UC Berkeley
            by a T1 line, is also considered a core site;  the remaining
            sites  are  connected to one of the core sites, typically by
            T1 or 56kbps lines, but in some cases by microwave or direct
            Ethernet (10 Mbps) connections.  BARRNet is connected to the
            NSFNET by an NSS  (Nodal  Switching  Subsystem)  located  at
            Stanford  University.   Stanford  is  also  the  site of the
            BARRNet Network Operating Center, or NOC.

            Beginning in April of 1990, BARRNet's membership  fees  will
            be  adjusted  to  reflect  size and type of organization, as
            well as connection speed.  Also during the spring and summer
            of  1990,  BARRNet will be implementing low-speed (9600 bps)
            dedicated line services,  with  dial-up  services  available
            shortly thereafter.

            An  Administrative  Committee   oversees   BARRNet   policy,
            finances,  and  general  operations.   A Technical Committee
            advises the Administrative Committee, and  oversees  day-to-
            day operations such as routing.

            of a not-for-profit  member's  research  or  instruction  is
            acceptable.   Use  of  BARRNet  for  scientific  research or
            instruction at for-profit affiliate sites may or may not  be
            consistent  with  the  purposes  of  BARRNet,  and  will  be
            reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  Commercial uses  such  as
            billing or advertising are prohibited.

            NorthWestNet (NWNet) is a mid-level network of the  National
            Science Foundation Network (NSFNET).  NWNet provides commun-
            ication with NSFNET  for  research  centers  throughout  the
            Northwest,  including sites in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, North
            Dakota, Oregon, and Washington.  The network  supports  both
            IP and DECnet within NWNet, but access to the NSFNET is res-
            tricted to IP only.  A primary focus of NWNet  is  providing
            access  by  researchers  in  the Northwest to supercomputing
            resources.

            for the Northwest are located at the University of  Washing-
            ton.   The  network  is currently implemented using a mix of
            T1, 56 Kb/s, and voice grade (19.2 Kb/s) leased lines  in  a
            mostly-tree topology.

            NWNet is funded by a grant from the National Science Founda-
            tion   and  by  membership  fees.   A  Management  Committee
            comprised largely of representatives from the member  insti-
            tutions  governs  NWNet.   Other  committees that advise the
            Management Committee include the Technical Committee and the
            Training  Committee (a subcommittee of the Technical Commit-
            tee).

            Several member institutions have large computers  accessible
            via  the  Internet.   For example, there are two Cray XMP/48
            computers at NWNet sites (Boeing and Battelle).  Some  other
            resources  available to NWNet members include:  a mail gate-
            way machine, relay.cac.washington.edu, which can route  mail
            between  the  Internet,  BITNET,  CSNET,  and UUCP networks;
            Internet access to  the  University  of  Washington  library
            catalog  (uwcat.lib.washington.edu-use  the  keypad + key or
            enter key to change screens; break the telnet connection  to

            (janus.uoregon.edu); and the University of  Washington  Com-
            puting  Information  Center  (CIC), which has more than 8000
            books,  1200  serial  titles,  and  8500  technical  reports
            related to computing.

            NWNet sponsors a yearly seminar highlighting  the  resources
            and  services  of  NWNet,  as  well  as  discipline-specific
            workshops for interested researchers currently using  super-
            computers  or  contemplating such use.  We also maintain and
            distribute a training kit containing a manual and  videotape
            geared  toward  training  user-services personnel in TCP/IP,
            the use of  NWNet,  national  networks,  and  supercomputing
            resources.

            SUNET, or  the  Swedish  University  Network,  interconnects
            local  and  regional networks at universities in Sweden. The
            goal of SUNET is to provide good  data  communications  that
            are  beneficial to the universities.  The network is used by
            researchers and teachers of all disciplines.  SUNET provides
            Swedish  academic  and research users with network resources
            for communications both within Sweden and around  the  world
            through  electronic  mail,  remote login, file transfer, and
            other methods.

            SUNET is a protocol-independent network  based  on  Ethernet
            (IEEE  802.3) interconnections. Currently only IP and DECnet
            (and EARN) are carried over the backbone. The  configuration
            of  SUNET  is  a  backbone  star  network centered at KTH in
            Stockholm with 64 kbps lines interconnecting the local  Eth-
            ernets  to one nation wide Ethernet. The lines are intercon-
            nected via remote bridges (Vitalink). Routers  are  used  to
            support  the  various  protocols: Cisco for IP and VAXes for
            DECnet (and EARN). SUNET also maintains a separate X.25 net-
            work.

            There are two interconnected  central  mail  hubs,  one  for
            IP/SMTP, RSCS/BSMTP and VMS/Mail and one for EAN/X.400 mail.

            There are (at least) 3000 IP hosts and 650 DECnets in SUNET.

            SUNET has international connections to

            The Texas Higher Education Network (THEnet)  was  formed  in
            1986  through  a  combination of networking efforts at Texas
            A&M University, the University of Houston, the University of
            Texas  Health Science Center at San Antonio, and the Univer-
            sity of Texas System.  It covers the state of Texas, with  a
            link  to  the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores
            de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico.  THEnet's goal is to pro-
            vide  and  advance the electronic exchange of information in
            support of the teaching, research, development, and  related
            collaborative  activities  of the Texas higher education and
            research communities.

            THEnet is not a homogeneous network utilizing a single  net-
            working  protocol.   Rather it is a network of physical con-
            nections between and within organizations making various use
            of  IP,  DECnet,  SNA, RSCS/NJE, OSI, and compressed digital
            video.  It provides researchers, faculty, and  students  the
            networking  "tools"  that  they  need  for  their particular
            situations.  THEnet currently connects over 60 institutions,

            JvNCnet is a  North  East  Research  Regional  Network  with
            direct  access  to  the  NSFNET  backbone.  JvNCnet also has
            international connections to several Scandinavian  countries
            (Norway,  Finland,  Iceland,  Sweden,  and  Denmark) via the
            network's connection to NORDUnet, and to France and Switzer-
            land via the link to INRIA.

            The regional network, the first T-1  (1.544  Mbps)  academic
            network, evolved from the thirteen members of the Consortium
            for Scientific Computing to a  regional  network,  currently
            with  thirty-one  sites concentrated in the Northeast.  When
            the John von Neumann National Supercomputer Center closed in
            April  1990,  JvNCnet  moved its headquarters to, and became
            part of, Princeton University.

            JvNCnet is engineered as a backbone network  where  backbone
            nodes  are  connected  to each other with multiple T1 lines.
            These backbone nodes fan out to connect JvNCnet  members  at
            T1,  fractional  T1  (128 kbps), 56 kbps, 19.2 kbps, and 9.6
            kbps over dedicated and dial-up lines.  Backbone  nodes  are
            located at phone company premises in the cities of Princeton
            (NJ), Trenton (NJ), Philadelphia (PA), Boston  (MA),  Provi-
            dence  (RI), New Haven (CT), New York (NY), and Newark (NJ).
            Member institutions connect to the  closest  backbone  node,

            ILAN, the Israeli Academic Network, established in 1984,  is
            dedicated  to  universities  and academic, medical, and non-
            profit research institutes.  The network is widely used  for
            scientific,  educational,  academic,  and research purposes:
            commercial and political use is not allowed, either directly
            or indirectly.

            ILAN has installed six 64kb lines to create a central  high-
            speed  backbone  between  Israel's seven major universities.
            ILAN has international connections to EARN and Nysernet.

            ILAN's former NJE traffic and all EARN/Bitnet  network  ser-
            vices  now  run  on  ILAN's TCP/IP backbone.  We plan a 56kb
            link  to  Nysernet  (the  New  York  State  Educational  and
            Research  Network),  a  regional  network  of NSFNET (the US
            National Science Foundation Network).  In the interim,  ILAN
            will connect to Nysernet via a 9.6kb IP link.

            Our backbone supports "Aleph," a project for the  computeri-
            zation  and  interconnection  of all university library card
            catalogs, which is near to completion.  This  system  allows
            students  and  faculty  to  search  card  catalogs  at local
            university libraries as well as libraries located  at  other
            universities within Israel.  Since this system was developed
            long before  the  ILAN  project,  it  was  based  on  DECNET

            ESnet is a computer data communications network managed  and
            funded by the Department of Energy Office of Energy Research
            (DOE/OER) for the  purpose  of  supporting  open  scientific
            research in multiple programs.  ESnet is intended to facili-
            tate access to resources at  ER  scientific  facilities,  to
            provide  for information dissemination among scientific col-
            laborators  throughout  all  ER  programs,  and  to  provide
            widespread  access  to existing supercomputer facilities via
            remote login, electronic mail, file  transfer,  and  related
            utilities.

            ESnet is installed  and  operated  by  the  National  Energy
            Supercomputer Center (NERSC), formerly known as the National
            Magnetic Fusion Energy Computer Center  (NMFECC),  which  is
            located  at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in
            California.  ESnet policy is guided by  the  ESnet  Steering
            Committee, appointed by the DOE Office of Scientific Comput-
            ing, with representatives from each of the  Energy  Research
            Programs.   The ESnet program plan, prepared by this commit-
            tee, is available from the  National  Technical  Information
            Service as report DOE/ER-0341 (June 1987).

            The ESnet backbone consists of largely of  T1  links  (1.544
            megabit  per  second)  interconnecting nineteen sites in the
            United States.  Network access to Europe and Japan  is  also
            supplied  in collaboration with foreign research facilities.

            ESnet will also provide backbone capabilties to the Magnetic
            Fusion  Energy  Network (MFEnet) and the High Energy Physics
            Network (HEPnet) communities.

            In terms of protocols, ESnet  supports  TCP/IP  and  Digital
            Equipment Corporation's DECnet.  ESnet will support X.25 and
            the OSI protocols as they become available from vendors.

            FidoNet allows MS and PC DOS personal computers, linked over
            dial-up  telephone lines, to contact UNIX and UUCP computers
            via gateways.  FidoNet, which was started in 1984, now  con-
            sists  of  more than 7,000 computers, or nodes, run by local
            system administrators.

            FidoNet is fully coupled into the Internet.  You do not need
            to  know  any  specific  gateways,  just address the message
            correctly into the fidonet.org domain, and  everything  will
            be routed automatically.

            FidoNet addresses can be addressed in the basic format of:

            FirstName_LastName@pww.fzz.nxx.zyy.fidonet.org

                 ww= Point Number (This is  usually  not  needed  unless
                     specific to a subsystem.)
                 zz= FidoNet Node
                 xx= FidoNet Network or Region
                 yy= FidoNet Zone (Presently only 1 to 5 are valid.)

            Therefore, as an  example,  user  David  Dodell  resides  at
            FidoNet address 1:114/15.  My FidoNet Internet address is:

            The California Education and  Research  Federation  Network,
            CERFnet,  is  a  data  communications  regional network that
            operates throughout California.  The purpose of  CERFnet  is
            to  advance  science  and  education by assisting the inter-
            change of information among research and educational  insti-
            tutions through high-speed data communications techniques.

            CERFnet was launched in the spring of 1989 with a $2.8  mil-
            lion  grant  from  the National Science Foundation.  CERFnet
            links fifty of the leading research and education centers in
            California  at  data  transfer rates of up to 1.544 megabits
            per second (T1).  The CERFnet backbone nodes are located  at
            UCLA,  UC  Irvine,  SDSC,  Caltech, and the UC Office of the
            President in Oakland,  California.   CERFnet  membership  is
            open  to  all  organizations  in  California,  including any
            university, college, industrial or government facility, hos-
            pital, or library.

            CERFnet offers several different connection options.  A CERF
            1544  (1.544 Mbps), CERF 56 (56 kbps) or CERF 9.6 (9.6 kbps)
            entitles the  subscriber  to  a  dedicated  leased  circuit.
            CERFnet  offers  DIAL N' CERF, a dial-up SLIP service to the
            network.  DIAL N' CERF subscribers connect to the network by
            dialing-up  the  nearest  backbone  node and logging on to a
            CERFnet terminal server.

            The Merit staff operates a gateway between the Internet  and
            SprintMail,  which  allows  messages to be exchanged between
            SprintMail customers and Internet  users.   The  gateway  is
            connected  to  Sprintnet and to the Internet through Merit's
            connections to the NSFNET.

            SprintMail, operated by Sprint International, is  a  commer-
            cial  X.400 electronic mail network providing services to US
            customers and access  to  other  networks  domestically  and
            internationally.   Formerly  known  as  Telemail, SprintMail
            uses the Sprintnet (formerly Telenet)  public  data  network
            for its e-mail connections.

            Merit  provides  hardware  and  software   maintenance   and
            administration and network operations (via the Merit Network
            Operations Center) for the Internet gateway; Sprint provides
            Sprintnet connectivity and user consulting and registration,
            as well as gateways to other X.400 networks.

            The gateway is a Sun SPARCstation-I running Sun OS 4.0.3 and
            Sunlink  MHS.  An X.25 link to Sprintnet is connected to the
            Sun's serial port at 9600 bps.   Protocols  used  are  X.400
            Message  Handling  System,  X.225 session layer, X.224 tran-
            sport class 0, and X.25. On the Internet  side,  the  Simple
            Mail Transfer Protocol (RFC-822), Transfer Control Protocol,
            Internet Protocol, and Ethernet protocols are used.

            The  gateway  supports  a  directory  function  that  allows
            SprintMail  customers  to be registered with a mnemonic name
            which can be used  by  Internet  users  when  sending  mail.
            SprintMail  users  who  wish  to register can contact Sprint
            Customer Service.

            Merit provides domain name service for the SPRINT.COM domain
            as  well  as  for  some  other  domains  on  behalf  of some
            SprintMail customers.  For example, the COMPMAIL.COM  domain
            is owned by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic
            Engineering) Computer Society but is operated  by  Merit  as
            part of the gateway function.

            From the Internet to SprintMail
            To  use  the  gateway,  an  Internet  user  can  specify   a
            registered SprintMail alias name, in the form:

                 John.Doe@Sprint.COM

            Alternatively, the full X.400 Originator/Recipient (OR) name
            can be specified, (all on one line), for example:

                 /pn=John.Doe/admd=Telemail/o=Sprintintl/c=us/@Sprint.COM

            The  Internet  host  name  after  the  at-sign,  @,  can  be
            SPRINT.COM or another domain supported by the Merit gateway.
            X.400  OR  names  consist  of a list of parameters and their
            values.  X.400 parameters in OR names that can  be  used  by
            the SprintMail gateway include:


            ADMD    Administrative Management Domain
            PRMD    Private Management Domain
            PN      Personal Name
            G       Given Name
            S       Surname
            DD.UN   User Name (DD is "Domain Defined")
            O       Organization
            C       Country (two-letter abbreviations must be used, for 
                    example, US, GB, JP)


            From SprintMail to the Internet
            When sending mail from the SprintMail X.400  environment  to
            the  Internet,  the  native  syntax  of  the sender's system
            should be used.  Use an _A_D_M_D of TELEMAIL, _P_R_M_D  of  INTERNET
            and  _C_o_u_n_t_r_y  of US, along with the "RFC-822" _d_o_m_a_i_n _d_e_f_i_n_e_d

            attribute to specify the user's Internet mail address.   For
            example,  to  send  mail  from  the  SprintMail system to an
            Internet user whose address is jdoe@engin.college.edu,  type
            (all on one line):

                 (Site:Internet,ID:<jdoe(a)engin.college.edu>)

            The angle brackets "< >" are required.  The  "(a)"  replaces
            the  at-sign, @, because that and most other special charac-
            ters are illegal as specified in RFC  987,  which  makes  it
            necessary  to  substitute "(u)" for underscore, _, "(b)" for
            bang (exclamation point), !, "(q)" for a quotation mark,  ",
            and "(p)" for percent, %.

            Resolving Problems

            PSINet is a US-based commercial,  national  TCP/IP  and  OSI
            internetwork  available throughout the continental US and in
            Canada, Germany, and Israel, with a wide  spectrum  of  ser-
            vices  for  the  individual and corporate user of electronic
            information.  PSINet is currently  a  T1-based  network  co-
            located in telephone company facilities;  it consists of two
            hundred  organizational  networks.   The  PSINet  operations
            center,  located in Albany, NY, operates twenty-four hours a
            day, seven days a week. (A regional  office  is  located  in
            Santa  Clara, California.) Local phone numbers through PSI's
            Individual Dialup Service (IDS) provides free  telnet/rlogin
            access  to any PSINet dedicated data line (SCS and CCS) cus-
            tomer sites in nearly forty cities throughout the US.

            TCP/IP packet access is also  provided  on  a  dialup  basis
            using  V.32  modems  in more than twenty-five cities.  Three
            times a year a PSINet users group (PSITech) meets to discuss
            new  services,  new  technologies,  and operational require-
            ments.

            PSINet provides internetworking  services  to  the  NYSERNet
            user  community,  and  also has connections to the NSFNET in
            Ithaca, NY.

            MIDnet is a midwest regional network  that  connects  educa-
            tors,   researchers,   libraries,   and   other  information
            resources to each other and to the National Science  Founda-
            tion  Network (NSFNET) in the states of Arkansas, Iowa, Kan-
            sas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.  MIDnet
            is  an IP-based network running at speeds from 56 Kbps to T1
            (1.544 mps), and  currently  connecting  twenty-seven  sites
            using cisco and Proteon routers to the NSFNET.

            The goal of MIDnet is to facilitate and promote the exchange
            of  information consistent with the purposes of its members.
            Member organizations are universities and colleges, federal,
            state and local government facilities, and commercial organ-
            izations.  MIDnet is currently operated with  National  Sci-
            ence Foundation grant funds and member dues.  A director and
            staff manage MIDnet, providing technical support services, a
            network  information center, and a network operations center
            at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

            Major information resources include  the  EROS  Data  Center
            (South   Dakota),   libraries,   the  Washington  University
            Archive, National Severe Storms  Laboratory  (University  of
            Oklahoma),  North  Central  Regional  Research  Dietary Data
            Archive (University of Nebraska-Lincoln),  and  gateways  to
            state educational networks.

            SDSCnet is a network that links  academic,  industrial,  and
            government  affiliates  with  the  San  Diego  Supercomputer
            Center (SDSC) and, by extension, with NSFNET.

            Participating organizations may use  the  network  to  login
            remotely  to  SDSC's  supercomputer,  parallel machines, and
            visualization resources;  transfer files; send  and  receive
            electronic  mail;  and connect to other resources on NSFNET.
            Some organizations also receive  software  support.   If  an
            organization's  network  device(s) support(s) SNMP, the link
            is monitored for outages 24 hours/day seven days/week.

            Connections to SDSCnet are dedicated links primarily  at  56
            Kbps  and  T1  speeds  using the TCP/IP or DECnet protocols.
            (OSI protocols will be added when  they  become  available.)
            Links  to  BITNET  are  also available for institutions that
            wish it and that qualify as members of CREN.

            A connection to this network is available to  any  academic,
            industrial,  or  government  organization not otherwise con-
            nected to NSFNET that seeks such  a  connection.   The  cost
            depends  on the preferred speed, network device, protocol of
            the connection, and the types of services required.

            CSUNET (California State University Network) spans the state
            of  California.  Its membership consists of the twenty Cali-
            fornia State University campuses, five California  Community
            Colleges, and the California Department of Education.

            CSUNET has four T1 connection points with the Internet,  two
            with  BARRNet  (Stanford and UC Davis), one with CERFnet (UC
            Irvine) and one with SDSCnet/CERFnet (SDSC). CSUNET also has
            X.25  packet connections to SprintNet and 9600-baud X.25 and
            Telnet dial-up access for  limited  CSU-sponsored  programs.
            Between  the  CSU  campuses,  CSUNET  also  supports DECnet,
            Appletalk, and SNA, along with TCP/IP.

            In 1988, partial funding was received from the National Sci-
            ence  Foundation  for cisco routers.  Today, however, CSUNET
            is funded entirely by the State of California in support  of
            K-12, community college, and university-level education.

            Logical and geographic maps of CSUNET  are  located  in  the
            csunet/maps subdirectory at nic.csu.net (130.150.102.20).

            Los Nettos is a regional network in the Los Angeles area.

            Important features of Los Nettos are that it is  (1)  an  IP
            network,  and (2) it is ``high speed.''  All connections and
            links are at least T1 (1.5 Mbps) capacity.  A  goal  of  Los
            Nettos is to provide an environment to develop very interac-
            tive network applications.

            Los Nettos is operated by the member organizations,  not  by
            DARPA,  or  NASA,  NSF, or DOE, etc.  It may be used for any
            educational or research purpose.

            The  member  organizations  are  universities  and  research
            laboratories.   The  Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of
            the University of Southern  California  (USC)  acts  as  the
            agent for Los Nettos.

            Seven organizations are already participating in  this  net-
            work (ISI, USC, JPL, CalTech, UCLA, TIS and Rand).  A number
            of other research centers have expressed strong interest  in

            WiscNet is a nonprofit association that provides  access  to
            national  network  resources  for  higher education institu-
            tions, mostly in the state of Wisconsin.  The  primary  pur-
            pose  of  WiscNet  is  to  provide  access  to the Internet.
            WiscNet provides no direct services to end users, but rather
            acts as a conduit to the resources of the Internet and makes
            possible interchange of information  using  electronic  mail
            and network news.

            WiscNet is governed by a board of  directors  consisting  of
            one member from each charter member institution plus the NSF
            proposal investigators.  The board is reponsible for setting
            broad operating policy, establishing direction, establishing
            membership categories, and  assessing  membership  fees.   A
            Network Planning Committee works with the operating agent on
            network design issues.

            The Madison Academic Computing Center at the UW-Madison pro-
            vides  day-to-day  operational  support  for  WiscNet.  This
            includes a Network Operation Center  that  provides  problem
            reporting  and resolution services 24 hour a day, 365 days a
            year.

            WiscNet operates a  packet-switched  network  consisting  of
            routers  connected  by  T1  (1.544  Mbps)  and DDS (56 Kbps)

            communications lines.  This  network  is  connected  to  the
            national network at UW-Madison by two T1 lines.

            The network backbone consists of cisco AGS  routers  located
            at  UW-Eau Claire, UW-Madison, UW-Milwaukee, UW-Oshkosh, and
            UW-Stevens Point.  These backbone  routers  are  redundantly
            connected  by  256-Kbps  circuits  provided  by the State of
            Wisconsin Department of Administration's  Consolidated  Data
            Network  (CDN).  End node sites are connected to the nearest
            backbone sites in their LATA by 56-Kbps DDS circuits.

            WiscNet is connected to the  CICNet  (Big  Ten  universities
            plus  the  University  of  Chicago)  regional network at UW-
            Madison by T1 lines to the University of  Minnesota  and  to
            Argonne National Laboratory.

            The Australian Academic and Research Network (AARNet)  is  a
            national  network  that interconnects the major academic and
            research facilities within Australia.  The network  connects
            all Australian universities, the Commonwealth Scientific and
            Industrial and Research Organisation (CSIRO), and many other
            government,  commercial,  and industrial research facilities
            in Australia.

            Internally the network uses a  mix  of  2-mbit  and  48-kbit
            leased  lines and multi-protocol routers to provide the con-
            nection infrastructure.

            The network supports national TCP/IP  and  DECnet  Phase  IV
            services. The TCP/IP network is interconnected to the Inter-
            net via a PACCOM link to FIX-West at Mountain View, Califor-
            nia.   At  time  of  writing  this international link uses a
            256-kbit satellite circuit.

            UNINETT is the Norwegian academic data network.  Its purpose
            is  to support research and education and collaborative work
            in and among academic and non-profit research  organizations
            in  Norway by providing access to computer networks and net-
            work resources.  UNINETT is both a network, an organization,
            and  an  infrastructure  based on a set of datacommunication
            protocols.   As  the  Norwegian  branch  of  the   Internet,
            EARN/BITNET,  the  European academic DECnet, and OSInet/IXI,
            UNINETT  offers  a  variety  of  services   connecting   the
            Norwegian  academic  society  to  the  rest  of the academic
            world.

            Electronic mail, file transfer, terminal  access,  directory
            services,  and  USENET  Network  News are among the services
            available on the UNINETT network.

            By July 1991, about eighty academic and  research  organiza-
            tions are connected to the UNINETT backbone, giving national
            and international  connection  to  some  eight  thousand  IP
            hosts,  a  few  hundred  DECnet  hosts and X.400 MTAs, and a
            handful of EARN/BITNET nodes.  The number of users is stipu-
            lated to be about fifteen thousand.

            UNINETT is a member of  NORDUnet,  which  is  a  cooperative
            effort  of  the academic networks in all of the Nordic coun-
            tries and is connected internationally through the  NORDUnet

            ARNET, a TCP/IP network connected to the  Internet,  is  the
            major  science  and  research network of Argentina.  It con-
            nects approximately three hundred sites, mainly universities
            and research organizations.  ARNET provides electronic mail,
            USENET News, file server, and electronic mailing  list  ser-
            vices.

            Like other cooperative networks, ARNET has no central  plan-
            ning  or  central authority.  The current international link
            and the top-level AR domain are managed by the UNDP  (United
            Nations  Development  Programme), Project ARG-86-026, at the
            Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MREC), together with the Secre-
            tariat  of  Science  and  Technology  (SECYT).  For the time
            being, the top-level  subdomains  are  administered  by  the
            UNDP/MREC project.

            ARNET is a store-and-forward message network  based  on  the
            Unix  communications  facilities.   The  international elec-
            tronic mail gateway and USENET news backbone, atina.ar, is a
            '386  machine  running  Unix  System V connected to the MREC
            Local Area Network.  The network is connected to the  Inter-
            net through a satellite link to SURANet at the University of
            _________________________

            Maryland.

            Most ARNET connections are over the public telephone network
            or  the  public  packet-switching  network, ARPAC, using the
            UUCP protocol in different environments.   USENET  news  and
            most  electronic  mail  traffic  is  brought  to  ARNET from
            uunet.uu.net via Internet.

            Several major nodes, such  as  secyt.gov.ar  (Secretaria  de
            Ciencia y Tecnologia), dcfcen.edu.ar (Departamento de Compu-
            tacion, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales,  Universi-
            dad de Buenos Aires), and opsarg.org.ar (Organizacion Panam-
            ericana de la Salud), call atina.ar  over  telephone  lines,
            PSN  ARPAC,  or  leased  lines  to  distribute mail and news
            traffic to other nodes.  Many nodes use various  implementa-
            tions of UUCP for MS-DOS with limited functionality.

            Future plans

            There is a cooperation agreement between the UNDP/MREC  pro-
            ject  and  the  SECYT  to distribute Internet services.  The
            first stage will be the installation of  a  couple  of  Unix
            boxes  at  major  regional sites, interconnected through the
            PSN ARPAC and national  satellite  links  using  UUCP.   The
            second  stage  will  be  the  migration from UUCP to TCP/IP.
            There are under study different ways to distribute  Internet
            services throughout the country, and to upgrade the interna-
            tional link to the Internet.

            are   reserved   for   subnetting.    The   subnet  mask  is
            255.255.254.0.

            The current MX-host  for  the  AR  domain  is  uunet.uu.net.
            Domain Name Service for AR domain is served by NS.UU.NET and
            UUCP-GW-1.PA.DEC.COM.  Most systems on ARNET use the  Inter-
            net addressing scheme and the UUCP bang notation.

                  Top-level-domain:   AR (Argentina)
                  Internet:           user@node.subdomain.ar
                  UUCP:               uunet!atina!node.subdomain.ar!user 
                                      or uunet!atina!node!user

            There are several  top-level  subdomains.   Provincial  sub-
            domains  are  used when sites don't apply for organizational
            subdomains.

            TANet, The Taiwan  Academic  Network,  is  a  pilot  project
            undertaken  by  the  Ministry  of Education and Universities
            Computer Center to establish a common national academic net-
            work infrastructure.

            To support research and  academic  institutions  in  Taiwan,
            TANet will provide access to unique resources and opportuni-
            ties for collaborative work.  TANet will be composed of most
            of  the  Taiwan  Internet community, including industry net-
            works such  as  SEEDNet  (Software  Engineering  Environment
            Development Network).

            Network Organization

            The management structure of TANet is a two-layer  hierarchy.
            The  TANet network service center (TANSC) is to be responsi-
            ble for the national  backbone  network  and  management  of
            international  links.  Within each regional area, a regional
            network service center (RNSC) will  provide  necessary  ser-
            vices and support connections to the TANet backbone from the
            local-area     network/campus      network      of      each
            university/institution.   At  present,  TANSC  is run by the
            Ministry of Education computer center, and each RNSC is  run

            university/institutions may apply for membership and be con-
            nected to TANet after obtaining  their  membership  applica-
            tion.

            Protocols

            The network protocols will initially focus on TCP/IP on  the
            TANet backbone.  Regional networks may support multiple pro-
            tocols and additional facilities (including  X.25  transport
            or  dial-up  services)  on  a local basis in accordance with
            regional requirements.  Support for OSI (CLNS) routing  will
            be  introduced  in  the near future.  Existing Taiwan BITNET
            and  ifNET  (information  NETwork)  applications  (including
            electronic  mail  delivery, NetNEWS, and file transfer) will
            be supported over TANet via IP connections.

            Network Topology

            The network implementation uses a  ring/mesh  topology.   It
            interconnects  by  intelligent routers and high-speed leased
            circuits/LANs together.

            High-speed T1 (1.544 Mbps) circuits were  installed  between
            NSYSU and NTU, MOECC, NCU, NCTU, NTHU, and NCKU.  NTU, NTHU,
            NCHU, and NCKU are now 9.6 kbps for  backup  purposes  (they
            will  be changed to at least 64 kbps in 1992).  Dynamic ISDN
            links are also intended to provide backup  services  in  the
            event  of  failure of a primary link.  The bandwidth of each
            local link will depend on  its  local  requirements;  global
            considerations  will  dictate  further  moves  toward higher
            bandwidths on the backbone links.

            A 64-kbps link will be installed from the Ministry of Educa-
            tion  Computer  Center  to  Princeton  University in October
            1991.  This link will  couple  TANet  to  both  JvNCnet  and
            NSFNET.

            OARnet is the regional network for the state  of  Ohio.   It
            serves  the higher education community, providing Ohio scho-
            lars access to colleagues worldwide.  OARnet  also  provides
            commercial connectivity to industrial and commercial members
            with unrestricted traffic flow between other OARnet  members
            and the Internet.  Libraries, databases, national and inter-
            national laboratories, and research centers are  accessible,
            helping make Ohio schools competitive.

            The Ohio Academic Resources Network (OARnet) was established
            in  1987  to  provide statewide access to the Cray supercom-
            puter at the Ohio Supercomputer Center.  Since then  it  has
            evolved into a network supporting all aspects of higher edu-
            cation in Ohio.  A primary goal of OARnet is  to  facilitate
            collaborative  projects  and  sharing  of  resources between
            institutions, including those  outside  the  state.   OARnet
            connections  are available to Ohio academic institutions and
            corporations engaged in  reseach,  product  development,  or
            instruction.    Colleges,   universities,   and   industries
            currently use OARnet connections to communicate  within  the
            state and with colleagues around the country.

            NCSAnet is a regional supercomputing network with sites pri-
            marily  located  in  Illinois,  Wisconsin, and Indiana.  The
            NCSAnet private corporate network is national in scale.

            NCSAnet is a dual-hub network with hubs on the  campuses  of
            the  University  of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at Chi-
            cago.  The Chicago hub, or, CHUB, is a Chicago  area  metro-
            politan  network  with  current  members UI-Chicago, Univ of
            Chicago (see also CICnet), Northwestern (see  also  CICnet),
            Illinois  Inst.  of  Tech., Argonne National Laboratory, and
            Notre Dame.  The Urbana hub connects the Univ  of  Wisconsin
            Milwaukee  and  Parkside  campuses and Purdue University, as
            well as  private  corporate  labs  in  New  York,  Illinois,
            Oklahoma, and Indiana.

            Expansion of the academic portion of the network  will  con-
            tinue, primarily through a state of Illinois network, netIL-
            LINOIS, which has been proposed  to  connect  smaller,  pri-
            marily  undergraduate institutions in Illinois.  netILLINOIS
            is a proposed joint network project  led  by  the  Computing
            Services  Office  at the University of Illinois and with the
            National Center  for  Supercomputing  Applications  and  the
            University of Illinois at Chicago.

            NCSAnet   is   operated   by   the   National   Center   for

            NEARnet is a high-speed (up to 10 Mb/s) network of academic,
            industrial,  government, and non-profit organizations in New
            England.  It was established by Boston University,  Harvard,
            and  MIT  late  in  1988;   as of June, 1989, it included 14
            organizations.  NEARnet is operated by BBN Systems and Tech-
            nologies under contract to MIT.

            NEARnet uses the TCP/IP protocol suite and supports  leased-
            line and microwave links at speeds from 9.6 Kb/s to 10 Mb/s.

            NEARnet has the goal of creating  a  regional  ``information
            infrastructure''   in  New  England  to  support  education,
            research and development.  Special services and  facilities,
            such  as  the  Connection  Machine  (TM),  the Massachusetts
            Microelectronics  Center,  and  library  catalogs,  will  be
            available over NEARnet.

            NEARnet is linked to the NSFNET backbone via connections  to
            the  John  von Neumann Center network and NYSERnet.  It also
            has a link to the Defense Research Internet.

                 program  distributes documents in response to specially
                 formatted messages.  The documents are  also  available
                 to Internet users through standard anonymous FTP login.

            For instructions about this and other services, send a  mes-
            sage to info-server@sh.cs.net with "HELP" in the body of the
            message.

            The Computer Incident  Advisory  Capability  (CIAC)  of  the
            Department of Energy (DOE) is located at the Lawrence Liver-
            more National Laboratory in Livermore, California.  CIAC  is
            the  DOE  crisis center for the handling of computer related
            security incidents.  CIAC rapidly  investigates  reports  of
            possible computer system penetrations, computer viruses, and
            similar problems.  Stopgap software solutions  are  provided
            in  real-time  while  robust binary and source level patches
            are developed.  CIAC distributes information about  computer
            related  threats  to  sites  that may be vulnerable to those
            specific threats. CIAC  also  retains  systems  consultants,
            applications  specialists, and research scientists to assist
            researchers in the security arena.

            As part of a network mapping project, we have implemented  a
            TCP-based  geographic  name  server.  In response to queries
            consisting of a city name and/or ZIP code  and  an  optional
            state  and/or  country  abbreviation, the server retrieves a
            variety of data from a database  containing  information  on
            all  US  cities  (~150,000).  Queries containing UNIX ed(1)-
            style regular expressions are also supported.

            The geographic names database contains state, county,  lati-
            tude and longitude for all US cities.  It also contains 1980
            census population, elevation, area code, and ZIP code for  a
            large  subset  of  the  cities, as well as a small number of
            international cities.   The  database  contains  information
            about  other  geographic  features such as counties, states,
            rivers,  lakes,  summits,  etc.  in  addition  to  populated
            places.

            The raw data were obtained from the United  States  Geodetic
            Survey (USGS) and the US Postal Service.  USGS is developing
            a Geographic Names Information System  (GNIS)  as  the  main
            repository for its ongoing National Gazetteer project.

            The NEST simulation package developed  at Columbia  provides
            a  generic framework for simulating networks and prototyping
            distributed systems.  The NEST  simulation runs  in  a  sin-
            gle   UNIX   process,  and   the   NEST  monitor  runs  in a
            separate process, which  may  be  remote.   Simulations  are
            created  using  the NEST library, a C-language library which
            runs under the all UNIX variants on VAX and 680x0 processors
            (SPARC  and  RT soon).  The library provides a simple, high-
            level message-passing facility among  a  set  of  concurrent
            lightweight  processes  which simulate a distributed system.
            Simulations can be interactively monitored and managed using
            the  standard  Nest  monitor  program, which permits dynamic
            reconfiguration  of  the  simulation.   It  is  possible  to
            create/halt/continue/destroy  simulated nodes and links, and
            to alter their  function and parameters, while a  simulation
            is  in  progress.   Multiple monitors at different sites can
            monitor a single simulation. The  monitor  is  a  monochrome
            SUNView  application  (an  X Windows implementation is under
            development).
