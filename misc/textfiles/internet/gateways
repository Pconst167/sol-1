# INTRODUCTION
#
# This file documents methods of sending mail from one network to another.
# It represents the aggregate knowledge of the readers of comp.mail.misc
# and many contributors elsewhere.  If you know of any corrections or
# additions to this file, please read the file format documentation below
# and then mail to me: John J. Chew <poslfit@gpu.utcs.utoronto.ca>.
#
#
# HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE
#
# Each entry in this file describes how to get from one network to another.
# To keep this file at a reasonable size, methods that can be generated by
# transitivity (A->B and B->C gives A->B->C) are omitted.  Entries are sorted
# first by source network and then by destination network.  This is what a
# typical entry looks like:
#
#   #F mynet
#   #T yournet
#   #R youraddress
#   #C contact address if any
#   #I send to "youraddress@thegateway"
#
# For parsing purposes, entries are separated by at least one blank line,
# and each line of an entry begins with a `#' followed by a letter.  Lines
# beginning with `# ' are comments and need not be parsed.  Lines which do
# not start with a `#' at all should be ignored as they are probably mail
# or news headers.
#
# #F (from) and #T (to) lines specify source and destination networks.
# If you're sending me information about a new network, please give me
# a brief description of the network so that I can add it to the list
# below.  The abbreviated network names used in #F and #T lines should
# consist only of the characters a-z, 0-9 and `-' unless someone can
# make a very convincing case for their favourite pi character.
#
# These are the currently known networks with abbreviated names:
#
#   applelink     Apple Computer, Inc.'s in-house network
#   bitnet        international academic network
#   bix           Byte Information eXchange: Byte magazine's commercial BBS
#   bmug          Berkeley Macintosh Users Group
#   compuserve    commercial time-sharing service
#   connect       Connect Professional Information Network (commercial)
#   fax           Facsimile document transmission
#   fidonet       PC-based BBS network
#   geonet        commercial information network
#   ieee-compmail A DIALCOM system supporting IEEE users
#   internet      the Internet
#   mci           MCI's commercial electronic mail service
#   mfenet        Magnetic Fusion Energy Network
#   nasamail      NASA internal electronic mail
#   sinet         Schlumberger Information NETwork
#   span          Space Physics Analysis Network
#   telemail      Telenet's commercial mail service
#   thenet        Texas Higher Education Network
#   usdamail      A DIALCOM system supporting USDA researchers
#
# #R (recipient) gives an example of an address on the destination network, 
# to make it clear in subsequent lines what text requires subsitution.
#
# #C (contact) gives an address for inquiries concerning the gateway,
# expressed as an address reachable from the source (#F) network.
# Presumably, if you can't get the gateway to work at all, then knowing
# an unreachable address on another network will not be of great help.
#
# #I (instructions) lines, of which there may be several, give verbal
# instructions to a user of the source network to let them send mail
# to a user on the destination network.  Text that needs to be typed
# will appear in double quotes, with C-style escapes if necessary.
