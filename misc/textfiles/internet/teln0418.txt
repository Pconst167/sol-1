
                         NOT ANOTHER LIST?!?!?!?!!!
        A list of telnet sites available on the Internet, compiled with
            the help of Auggie BBS (bbs.augsburg.edu) and dozens of
                           brave net riders.
         Compiled on April 18, 1993 by CC May (mcm@sunset.cse.nau.edu)

        This document may be copied and distributed freely, provided...
a) It is distributed in its entirety (quoting from it is still OK...)
                                  and
b) It is not used for commerce or the purpose of making money. 
   Unless I get some kind of small royalty. After all, in my spare time
   I'm a college student. :)
                 Entries are as follows:

   This is a list of services, often made possible by volunteers who
usually go unthanked. If you see anyone who does this sort of thing,
thank them.
   Also, whatever you do, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO HACK ANYTHING ON
THE INTERNET! The hacking that has been done on the Internet has caused
a great many BBSs and other sites to go down forever, and others have
taken steps at making this net a little less friendly than it is now.
(e.g., Nyx.) These BBSs do not have to be here. However, they still exist 
and literally thousands use them each day. Don't hack them, or what we now
have will be history. Well, that said, on with the show...

CC's WISH LIST
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
-An encyclopedia. There are dozens of encyclopediae (is that right? My Latin
is a little rusty. :) on CD-ROM, and just one would do a world of good for
college students. 
Anyone with wishes for the Internet, feel free to mail me. 

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
COKE MACHINES ON THE INTERNET
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
The latest in hacker trends. :)
Actually, they've been around for a little while now...
These are actual Coke and M'n'M machines connected to the Internet,
and when fingered, provide you with the amount of soft drinks held within.
I doubt you could hack 'em, anyway... and if you could, how would you get
the product? :)
These are just interesting, so I put them in. Enjoy.

FREE BULLETIN BOARD SERVICES
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
NOTE: I have placed BBSs whose main goal is to entertain or serve as
a forum for people to get together here.
BBSs whose primary purpose is connectivity or services involving the INet
have been placed in 'Other Services and Tips'.

\\\CITADEL///
Citadel is a message-only system.
Boards using this are highly active with the exchange of messages
in various "rooms", sometimes as varied as MST3K>, NetLife>, and
Spam! Spam! Spam!>. Plenty of information can be had on these boards,
though no files are available.
Another feature of these boards is that each one has added a little 
flavor to the stock Citadel code, so none of them are quite the same.

Quartz BBS
quartz.rutgers.edu
128.6.60.6
bbs
Citadel
The granddaddy. Interesting and spontaneous conversation found at any
hour of the day or night. That is, if you can get in. :)

and DOC.

\\\DOC///
Dave's Own version of Citadel.
Best-known as the software ISCA BBS runs, it is a far more user-friendly
system than the original Citadel. No files can be had on these, either.

ISCA BBS
bbs.isca.uiowa.edu
128.255.40.203
The biggest BBS on the net. Period. About 10000 active users, and often
more than 300 users online at any given time. Huge areas for
conversation on diverse topics.

FREENETS AND PUBLIC ACCESS UNIX
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Freenets are fairly new to the Internet.
These services often have Telnet, full email, USA Today news and
weather, and are typically set up like 'cities'. Registration is (as the
name implies) free, but usually require a snail-mailed form.
In much the same idea, a few boards have been set up for the public to use
UNIX at no cost.
