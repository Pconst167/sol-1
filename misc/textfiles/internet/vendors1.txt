INTRODUCTION



This  is  a  guide  to implementations and products associated with the DoD
Defense Data Network (DDN) suite of data communication  protocols,  notably
TCP/IP and OSI implementations.  It is published for informational purposes
only by SRI International  on  behalf of the Defense Communications System
Data Systems (DCS DS) Office to assist those wishing to identify existing
implementations or products incorporating the DoD protocols.

The guide has four major sections.

Section  One  contains  background  information  about  DoD  protocols, DDN
protocol policy, and qualification testing and evaluation procedures.    It
also  explains  how  to  obtain  specific  DoD  protocol specifications and
related documentation.

Sections Two through Four contain the implementation descriptions.  Section
Two  lists  software  implementations,  sorted  alphabetically  by  company
machine type.   The  Digital  Equipment  Corporation  and  IBM  Corporation
sections  cover  a  wide range of machinery software from PC/compatibles to
minis and mainframes; each is listed  alphabetically  within  each  machine
category.  A "Multiple Machine Implementations" list completes the Software
section.

Section Three contains hardware implementations  sorted  alphabetically  by
company  machine  type  and  concludes  with  a  list  of  multiple machine
implementations.

Section Four, called Analysis Tools, covers the field of  network  analysis
products,  notably  protocol  and  network  analyzers.   See also RFC 1147,
"Network Management Tool Catalog," containing a listing  of  many  products
available.

The  index  at  the  back  of  the  book  can assist in locating particular
implementations.  It is sorted by operating system, machine  type,  company
name and important keywords such as "X.25," "OSI," and "Gateway."

This  document  is  available  to  Internet  users  as a public file on the
NIC.DDN.MIL host (192.67.67.20).  The file can be copied via FTP or  KERMIT
using the pathname: NETINFO:VENDORS-GUIDE.DOC.

1. BACKGROUND

1.1. The DoD Protocol Suite

In  1982 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) were designated  official
DoD  network  communication  protocols  by  the  Office of the Secretary of
Defense (OSD).  These protocols are currently in use by the DDN,  as  is  a
DoD   version  of  X.25.    In  late  1987  DoD  began  its  transition  to
international protocols.  (See Section 1.1.3 below.)   Subscribers  to  the
DDN  need  implementations  and  vendor  products that incorporate both the
TCP/IP  and  the  OSI-based  protocols,  and  protocols  that  assist  with
conversion   between  the  two.    This  guide  provides  a  list  of  such
implementations and products.



1.1.1. DoD Protocol Selection and Announcement Procedures

Official Military Standard  (MIL-STD)  protocols  are  selected  through  a
rigorous   review   process  by  the  military  services  and  the  Defense
Communications Agency (DCA).  Once selected,  they  are  deposited  at  the
Naval  Publications  and  Forms  Center  and  are announced in the catalogs
published by that organization as official military standards.  See Section
1.3.1 for guidelines on ordering MIL-STDs.

The  Department  of  Defense and each branch of the military have their own
protocol announcement procedures as do  non-military  government  agencies,
such  as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, formerly
the National Bureau of Standards).  Commercial, national, and international
standards  organizations  also  have  their  own  review  and  announcement
procedures.  See IEEE  Communications  Magazine,  Vol.  23,  No.  1,  43-55
(January  1985)  for an excellent overview of the standardization practices
of the various protocol standardization bodies within and outside of DoD.



1.1.2. OSD Directives

A number of memoranda from the Office of the Secretary of Defense have been
issued  which  are  specific policy statements regarding the DoD protocols.
These memoranda are  available  via  FTP,  KERMIT  or  SERVICE,  the  NIC's
automatic electronic mail service, from the NIC.DDN.MIL host computer using
the following pathnames:

1.1.3. DoD Plans for the Transition to International Protocols

Vendors and  implementors  should  be  aware  that  the  DoD  has  recently
announced  that  it  intends to transition to international protocols, when
and if these protocols meet the requirements of the DoD.  It is anticipated
that   any   such  transition  will  take  place  gradually  and  will  not
significantly  impact  the  functionality,  or   the   current   level   of
interoperability  on  the  DDN.  To assist with this transition, this guide
will include transition products as they are developed.

The following is an extract from  a  memorandum  from  the  office  of  the
Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for Command, Control, Communications and
Intelligence that specifically addresses the Department of Defense plans to
transition  from the current suite of military standard data communications
protocols based  on  the  TCP/IP  protocols  to  the  suite  of  networking
protocols  based  on the international standards.  (Available online in its
entirety as PROTOCOLS:OSDIR-12-88.TXT from the NIC.DDN.MIL host computer.)

MEMORANDUM FOR:
                SECRETARIES OF THE MILITARY DEPARTMENTS
                CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
                DIRECTORS, DEFENSE AGENCIES

SUBJECT:        Open Systems Interconnection Protocols




From  now  until  August  1990,  the  OSI  protocols specified in GOSIP are
adopted as a full co-standard to the Department of Defense protocols  which
provide  similar  services  (MIL-STDs  1777, 1778, 1780, and 178l).  During
this period the DoD protocols may continue to be specified in addition  to,
in  lieu  of,  or  as  an  optional  alternative  to  the corresponding OSI

                                     4



protocols.  Effective August 1990, the OSI  protocols  specified  in  GOSIP
become the sole mandatory interoperable protocol suite and must be included
in all proposals for new automated information systems and  major  upgrades
which  require  net-  work  services.    After  that time DoD protocols may
continue to be acquired in addition to the OSI protocols when  required  to
support   operational  needs.    OSI  protocols  which  provide  additional
functionality will be added to GOSIP as implementation  specifications  for
these  protocols  are  developed.    These  protocols  must be cited in all
proposals eighteen months following their adoption into GOSIP.

The Department of Defense OSI Implementation Strategy was published by  the
Defense Communications Agency in May 1988 to establish the OSI protocols as
a military co-standard with  the  current  DoD  protocols  and  to  provide
guidance   for   implementing  DoD/OSI  protocol  interoperability  in  DoD
networks.  The Services and agencies should use this document in developing
information systems requirements.

1.1.4. Government OSI Profile (GOSIP)

A  Federal  Information  Processing  Standard (FIPS) has been issued by the
National Bureau of Standards (NBS) for GOSIP in the Federal Register,  V52,
Vo. 208, Oct. 28, 1987.

This  FIPS  proposes  a  Federal  Information  Processing  Standard  for  a
Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP)  and  outlines  the
policy  of the Federal government, including the DoD transition from TCP/IP
to ISO international protocols.

The  GOSIP  cites  the   Implementation   Agreements   for   Open   Systems
Interconnection  Protocols, the Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) and
Technical and  Office  Protocols  (TOP)  specifications,  as  well  as  the
numerous federal standards, military standards, and international standards
from ISO and CCITT upon which the "Workshop Agreements" are based.

GOSIP supports the  Message  Handling  Systems  (MHS)  and  File  Transfer,
Access,   and   Management   applications  (FTAM).    GOSIP  also  supports
interconnection   of   the   following   network   technologies:      CCITT
Recommendation X.25; Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
(IEEE 802.3);  Token  Bus  (IEEE  802.4);  and  Token  Ring  (IEEE  802.5).
Additional  applications  and  network  technologies will be added to later
versions of the GOSIP document or vendor products in which  such  protocols
are embedded.

1.2. The Defense Data Network (DDN)

All equipment attached to the DDN by military subscribers must incorporate,
or be compatible with, the  DoD  internet  and  transport  protocols.    In
addition,  the  OSI  message handling and file transfer protocols, together
with their underlying protocols as defined in GOSIP, have been  adopted  as
experimental co-standards to the DoD protocols.

Potential  implementors  should  be aware that protocol implementations for
use in the DoD environment MUST comply with the  MIL-STD  versions  of  the
protocol  specifications.   It is also important that the LATEST version of
these specifications be used.  Most of the protocol  documents  needed  for
implementation purposes are included in the DDN Protocol Handbook issued by
the DDN Network Information Center.  This handbook can serve  as  a  useful
reference  to  DoD protocols; however, implementors using this or any other
similar document should always check to see if there are any later protocol
or policy changes that apply.



1.2.1. DDN Protocol Conformance Testing

Subscriber  interfaces which are to be used on the DDN must be qualified by
meeting a series of performance tests.  The results  of  these  tests  must
satisfy  a  Technical Acceptance Team made up of personnel from the DCS DS,
the Defense Communications Engineering Center (DCEC), or other  appropriate
assignees.    The  DCS  DS has the final approving authority for subscriber

                                     6



interface qualification.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),  under  contract
to  the  Defense  Communications  Agency/Defense Communications Engineering
Center  (DCA/DCEC),  has  established  a  National   Volunteer   Laboratory
Accreditation  Program  (NVLAP) to provide standardized test procedures for
military  standard  data  communications  protocols.      NVLAP   accredits
organizations  to  perform  conformance tests of specific protocols.  It is
required  that  such  conformance  testing  be  performed  prior  to  first
operational  use  of  the  protocols on any DoD network for those contracts
executed after 1 June 1989.  These tests apply to the  protocols  specified
in MIL-STDs 1777 (Internet Protocol), 1778 (Transmission Control Protocol),
1780 (File Transfer Protocol), 1781 (Simple Mail  Transfer  Protocol),  and
1782 (Telnet Protocol).  Organizations are also accredited to test the X.25
interface protocol.

Further details regarding the conformance testing requirements can be found
in  the  26  August  1988  Memorandum issued by the office of the Assistant
Secretary of Defense titled "Conformance Testing of Military Standard  Data
Communications  Protocol  Implementations."    This  document  can be found
online at the NIC.DDN.MIL host as PROTOCOLS:OSIDR-8-88.TXT.

This Guide is not the official "Defense Data Network (DDN)  X.25  Qualified
Host  Interfaces"  list.    That list is issued periodically as a DCA memo.

2.2.2.2. TCPort Developers Kit

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    TCPort Developers Kit

DESCRIPTION:

       TCPort Developers Kit is a software platform for the development
    of distributed Macintosh network applications  running  on  top  of
    TCP/IP,  a  de  facto  protocol  standard  for  networking multiple
    dissimilar hosts.  TCPort consists of two parts:  (1) a  choice  of
    two  basic TCP/IP transport systems, one provided by Novell and one
    from Apple Computer, and (2) an application  programming  interface
    (API).    The  TCP/IP  transport system, which includes drivers for
    TCP,IP and UDP, provides  seamless  TCP/IP  connectivity,  allowing
    Macintoshes  to  communicate  with  other TCP/IP hosts, servers and
    workstations on a network.

       The  4.3  BSD  socket  library  API  assists   programmers   and
    developers  in  developing  distributed TCP/IP applications for the
    Macintosh.  This socket model gives developers who  are  accustomed
    to  the  standard UNIX programming evironment a consistent means of
    accessing the transport  protocol  layer.    The  socket  model  is
    compatible with both the TCPort trnsport system from Novell and the
    MacTCP transport software from Apple.   Having  this  compatibiltiy
    within  the  socket  library enables a resulting application to run
    without concern as to which driver is installed.   Developers  then
    have  a  set of choices to use sockets if they choose, and with the
    proper licensing,  to  ship  either  or  both  drivers  with  their
    application.

2.3.1. BBN-TOPS-20

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   BBN-TOPS-20

DESCRIPTION:

       The TOPS20 Internetworking software supports multiple  networks,
    multiple  interfaces  on  a  single  network, and multiple protocol
    suites.  Included in the standard distribution are an interface  to
    1822  nets  via  an AN20, an interface to a network front-end via a
    DTE20, and the DARPA protocol suite.

       The DARPA IP, ICMP, TCP, Server TELNET  protocols  are  included
    within  the TOPS20 monitor; other protocols are implemented as user
    application processes.  The IP  module  supports  a  routing  cache
    maintained  via  ICMP  redirect NET and HOST messages.  It performs
    fragmentation and reassembly, implements  all  options  except  MTU
    Discovery,  and  can  forward  traffic  between  any  of the host's
    interfaces.  Applications may interface to the IP layer using  User
    Queues.

       All  ICMP  messages  except  Address  Mask  are supported; error
    messages may be sent by any of the protocol layers;  higher  layers
    are  notified  when  a  message is received concerning one of their
    packets.  Messages can be sent by applications using the User Queue
    facility.

       Applications can interface to TCP either as a read/write file or
    via multiple buffers.  The TCP layer supports IP  routing  options,
    ICMP  destination  unreachable,  source quench, and redirects which
    specify a type-of-service, and the segment size  option.    Support
    for  preemption,  precedence,  and security options is delegated to
    the application.  Telnet supports options and subnegotiations.

       There is extensive inter-layer flow  control,  error  reporting,
    and  monitoring.    Utilities are available to provide information,
    list monitoring data, and perform diagnostics.

       DEC has distributed a prior version of  this  implementation  as
    part of its standard TOPS20-AN monitor.

2.4.1. Cray TCP/IP

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:  UNICOS TCP/IP

DESCRIPTION:

       UNICOS TCP/IP is the integrated networking protocol for the Cray
    operating system UNICOS.  This implementation of TCP/IP is based on
    the Berkeley 4.3BSD tahoe distribution and contains support for the
    IP,  ICMP, TCP, UDP, and SMTP protocols.  Most of the BSD utilities
    are also supported, including telnet, ftp, rcp, rsh, rlogin, rexec,
    lpr,  lpq,  lprm, talk, ntalk, netstat, sendmail, finger, and ping.
    Other supported features including both internet  and  UNIX  domain
    sockets, subnet address, and the domain name server named and inetd
    support.

       Several  performance   improvements   have   been   incorporated
    including   both   the   Berkeley  Van  Jacobson  enhancements  and
    additional  improvements  made  by  Cray.      The   Van   Jacobson
    enhancements are slow start TCP congestion control, round trip time
    variance estimation, exponential, retransmit timer backoff, dynamic
    TCP  window  sizing  congestion  control,  and  the fast retransmit
    algorithm.  Cray has added a Cray specific mbuf  management  scheme
    plus extensive use of the Cray scalar, vector CPT hardware, and the
    fast I/O hardware.  The  combination  of  these  improvements  have
    resulted  in  TCP transfer rates reaching over 500 hundred megabits
    per second in software loopback.

       The TCP protocols and utilities  conform  to  the  Internet  RFC
    specifications, and DOD MIL-STD-1777 and MIL-STD-1778.

       In combination with UNICOS TCP/IP, support is also available for
    SUN client and server NFS, SUN RPC/XDR, a special User and Group id
    mapping   capability,  Yellow  Pages  as  an  optional  method  for
    authenticating user passwords, Lock Manager,  and  REX.    The  MIT
    X-Windows System Version ll, Release 3 is also available.

       Network  media  support  is  provided for the Cray FEI-3 Network
    Interface for VME based systems, the  Cray  HSX  100  Megabyte  per
    second  High  Speed  Channel,  NSC  HYPERChannel  A-Series  and NSC
    HYPERChannel DX equipment, CNT LANlord products, and Ethernet  thru

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    CHIVES (MIT domain resolver for TOPS-20)

DESCRIPTION:

       Implementation  of  Domain  Name System (RFC-1034/1035) resolver
    and supporting  software  for  TOPS-20.    Implements  full-service
    domain  resolver, with support for arbitrary search paths, negative
    response caching, and automaticly scalable internal database.   Two
    interfaces  are  provided:  a raw IPCF interface, and a new TOPS-20
    monitor call, GTDOM%, which provides all the  useful  functions  of
    the standard DEC GTHST% call plus some new functions to support the
    Stanford FTP client and the MM-20 mailsystem (q.v.).

       CHIVES does not currently have a name server interface (i.e., it
    can  act  as  a  DNS  client  but not as a DNS server).  CHIVES was
    written with the intent that it be portable, particularly to  other
    PDP-10  operating  systems,  but  so  far noone as ported it beyond
    TOPS-20.  If you  are  interested  in  remedying  either  of  these
    deficiencies,  please  contact BUG-CHIVES@LCS.MIT.EDU, we'd like to
    hear from you.

DOCUMENTATION:

       Some  documentation  is  provided  with   source   distribution.
    Detailed installation instructions are provided, along with a guide
    to the various GTDOM% options.  You're on your own after that.

2.7.1.2. Process Software TCPware for RSX

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   TCPware for RSX

DESCRIPTION:

       TCPware for RSX is a family of highly modular TCP/IP  networking
    software  products  designed and engineered exclusively for the RSX
    operating system environment. The products support the major TCP/IP
    user  and  server  protocols,  and  operate  with  any DEC Ethernet
    hardware. The  following  software  products  are  members  of  the
    TCPware for RSX family:

   1. - TCP-RSX

   2. - FTP-RSX

   3. - TELNET-RSX

       Each  TCPware  for  RSX  product  has been designed to take full
    advantage of the  PDP-11  architecture  and  the  RSX-11  operating
    system.  As a result, the products operate reliably and efficiently
    with low CPU overhead and minimum memory  resources.  The  products
    have also been designed to be easy to install and operate.

       The  TCP-RSX  product  provides the network IP and ARP protocols
    and host layer TCP protocols,  a  QIO  programming  interface,  and
    support  software  for  network  startup, shutdown, monitoring, and
    management. The TCP and IP protocol layers (together with  ARP)  in
    TCP-RSX are implemented within an RSX I/O driver and ACP (Ancillary
    Control Processor) running in kernel mode.

       In addition to supporting all standard DEC Ethernet  interfaces,
    TCP-RSX  is  able to share the same Ethernet interface hardware and
    operate concurrently with other protocol software (such  as  DECnet
    and LAT).

       The  FTP-RSX product provides both user and server file transfer
    support.    FTP-RSX  supports  multiple  simultaneous  users   with
    multiple simultaneous FTP connections.

       FTP-RSX  supports  account  and  password  protection  and  full
    UIC-based file protection, preventing unauthorized file access from
    remote  users. FTP-RSX also supports application programmers with a
    set of library routines that  can  establish  FTP  connections  and
    transfer files with remote hosts.

       The   TELNET-RSX  product  provides  complete  virtual  terminal
    networking  for  both  server  and  user  TELNET   functions.   The
    TELNET-RSX  product  also  supports  application programmers with a
    full set of library routines that can establish and maintain TELNET
    connections with remote hosts.

       The FTP-RSX and TELNET-RSX products provide a superior method of
                                    39



    networking, since they can be used either standalone  or  together,
    making them ideal for applications that may need to grow.

       And  all  TCPware  for RSX products protect a user's investment,
    since they are designed and engineered  for  superior  performance,
    efficiency, and reliability at competitive costs.

2.7.1.3. Process Software TCPware for RT-11

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   TCPware for RT-11

DESCRIPTION:

       TCPware for RT-11 is  a  family  of  modular  TCP/IP  networking
    software products designed and engineered exclusively for the RT-11
    operating system environment.  The products support  several  major
    TCP/IP user and server protocols, and operate with any DEC Ethernet
    hardware. The  following  software  products  are  members  of  the
    TCPware for RT-11 family:

   1. - TCPIP-RT

   2. - FTP-RT

   3. - TELNET-RT

       Each  TCPware  for  RT-11 product has been designed to take full
    advantage of  the  PDP-11  architecture  and  the  RT-11  operating
    system.  As a result, the products operate reliably and efficiently
    with low CPU overhead and minimum memory  resources.  The  products
    have also been designed to be easy to install and operate.

       The  TCPIP-RT product implements the TCP, IP, and ARP protocols.
    TCPIP-RT supports high-speed process-to-process communications with
    a  library  of  subroutines  that  can  establish  and maintain TCP
    connections with remote hosts.

       Application programmers can use the subroutines in  TCPIP-RT  to
    open  active  or  passive TCP connections, send data, receive data,
    close or  abort  connections,  and  read  status  information.  The
    subroutines  are  callable  from  any  DEC high-level language. For
    memory restrictive environments, the subroutines  can  be  arranged
    into overlay regions and a small root section.

       The  FTP-RT  product  provides both client (user) and server FTP
    protocols using separate utility  programs.  FTP-RT  also  supports
    application  programmers with a set of library subroutines that can
    establish FTP connections and transfer files with remote hosts. For
    memory  restrictive environments, these subroutines can be arranged
    into overlay regions and a small root section.

       The TELNET-RT product supports client  (user)  TELNET  protocols
    with   a   user-run   utility   program.  TELNET-RT  also  supports
    application programmers with a set of library subroutines that  can
    establish  TELNET  connections  with  remote  hosts.    For  memory
    restrictive environments, these subroutines can  be  arranged  into
    overlay regions and a small root section.

       All  of  the TCPware for RT-11 products can run on the RT-11 SJ,
    FB, or XM monitors, and they can also run within or as virtual jobs

                                    41



    in extended memory.

2.7.1.4. Process Software TCPware for TSX-Plus

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   TCPware for TSX-Plus

DESCRIPTION:

       TCPware  for  TSX-Plus  is  a  family  of  highly modular TCP/IP
    networking software products designed  and  engineered  exclusively
    for the TSX-Plus operating system environment. The products support
    the major TCP/IP user and server protocols, and  operate  with  any
    DEC  Ethernet hardware. The following software products are members
    of the TCPware for TSX-Plus family:

   1. - TCP-TSX

   2. - FTP-TSX

   3. - TELNET-TSX

       Each TCPware for TSX-Plus product has been designed to take full
    advantage  of  the  PDP-11  architecture and the TSX-Plus operating
    system. As a result, the products operate reliably and  efficiently
    with  low  CPU  overhead and minimum memory resources. The products
    have also been designed to be easy to install and operate.

       The TCP-TSX product provides the network IP  and  ARP  protocols
    and  host  layer  TCP protocols, a TCP-layer programming interface,
    and support software for network startup, shutdown, monitoring, and
    management.  The  TCP and IP protocol layers (together with ARP) in
    TCP-TSX are  implemented  within  a  TSX-Plus  device  handler  and
    detached jobs.

       The  FTP-TSX product provides both user and server file transfer
    support.    FTP-TSX  supports  multiple  simultaneous  users   with
    multiple simultaneous FTP connections.

       FTP-TSX  supports  account  and  password protection, preventing
    unauthorized file access from remote users. FTP-TSX  also  supports
    application  programmers  with  a  set of library routines that can
    establish FTP connections and transfer files with remote hosts.

       The TELNET-TSX product supports client (user)  TELNET  protocols
    with  a  user-run  utility  program.  Multiple  users on a TSX-Plus
    system can simultaneously establish  outgoing  TELNET  connections.
    TELNET-TSX  also  supports  application  programmers  with a set of
    library subroutines that  can  establish  TELNET  connections  with
    remote hosts.

DOCUMENTATION:

       Fully  documented;  TCPware  for  TSX-Plus products are supplied
    with a complete User's Guide.

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:  UNIX 2.10 BSD

DESCRIPTION:

       DESCRIPTION:

       2.10  BSD  TCP/IP  is  a  fairly  complete  port  of 4.3 BSD and
    includes the 4.3 BSD TCP/IP,  with  minor  exceptions,  and  a  few
    programs  eliminated  due  to  address  space  considerations.   It
    provides support for TCP, IP, ICMP, and UDP with  user  and  server
    programs  for  Telnet,  FTP,  TFTP  and  SMTP.   Hardware supported
    includes 10M bit/s Ethernet (5  different  controllers),  3M  bit/s
    Ethernet,  and  SLIP.  The 2.10 BSD TCP/IP runs in supervisor mode.
    Drivers for Proteon ProNET and ACC and DEC/CSS IMP  Interfaces  are
    provided,  although  some  work  will be required to integrate them
    into the system.  2.10 BSD only runs  on  split  I/D  machines;  it
    could  probably  be made to run on non-split I/D PDP-11's, although
    such a system could not include networking.

       Remote  NFS  servers  supporting  full  UNIX  (NFS)  file system
    semantics appear to VAX/VMS systems  as  fully-functional  Files-11
    ODS-2  file  systems.    This  includes  multinet file versions and
    arbitrary RMS file attributes.  Text files created on an NFS server
    by  the  VAX/VMS  client system appear as Stream_LF format files to
    the client.  On the server, they appear as normal  "stream"  files,
    thus  allowing  them  to be shared with applications running on the
    NFS server and  other  (including  non-VMS)  NFS  clients.    Other
    VAX/VMS  file  types are stored on the NFS server as "raw" VMS data
    blocks plus information  about  the  RMS  file  attributes.    This
    permits  other  VAX/VMS  clients  to  share  these files on the NFS
    server and non-VMS systems to access the data, provided the non-VMS
    systems are capable of interpreting the "raw" VMS data blocks.

       The   MultiNet   NFS   Client   runs  on  top  of  the  MultiNet
    multi-protocol networking software for VAX/VMS system (described in
    detail  in its own section elsewhere in this manual).  MultiNet and
    the MultiNet NFS Client support the full range  of  VAX  processors
    running  VAX/VMS  version  V4.5  or  greater (including symmetrical
    multiprocessing support under VAX/VMS Version 5).

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   MultiNet NFS Server

DESCRIPTION:

       The  MultiNet  NFS  Server  is a high-performance multi-threaded
    kernel-based NFS server for VAX/VMS  computer  systems.    The  NFS
    Server  maps  the  complete UNIX file system semantics onto the VMS
    file system, including symbolic and hard links, making a  VMS  file
    system  look  exactly  like a UNIX file system.  All VMS text files
    are type-converted to look  like  UNIX  stream  files  for  maximum
    interoperability.    The NFS Server uses a file and directory cache
    between the file system and the network  to  mask  VMS  bottlenecks
    from   the  requesting  UNIX  machine.    The  NFS  Server  uses  a
    proprietary XDR serializer to move data directly between  the  file
    system  cache  and  the  network  buffers.    By default, the cache
    functions as a write-through cache, but  can  be  configured  as  a
    write-back cache to increase performance.

       The  MultiNet  NFS  Server  can  export  all  Files-11 ODS-2 VMS
    volumes, including  shadow  sets,  bound  volumes,  and  DFS-served
    disks.

       The  MultiNet  NFS  Server  distribution  also includes a PC-NFS
    authentication and print server (PCNFSD).  It allows  IBM  PCs  and
    compatibles  running  NFS  client  software  to  access  NFS served
    filesystems a though they  are  local  DOS  disk  drives.    PCNFSD
    supports printing from PC clients to VMS print queues.

       The   MultiNet   NFS   Server   runs  on  top  of  the  MultiNet
    multi-protocol networking software for VAX/VMS system (described in
    detail  in its own section elsewhere in this manual).  MultiNet and

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    MultiNet

DESCRIPTION:

       MultiNet  is  a  high-performance VAX/VMS multi-protocol network
    environment, which enables the interconnection of VAX/VMS computers
    to  other  systems  operating  the  TCP/IP,  CHAOSnet, or Xerox PUP
    protocol suites.  The MultiNet TCP/IP protocol  module  is  derived
    from  the 4.3BSD networking software and runs in the VAX/VMS kernel
    environment.

       MultiNet provides a full suite of user/server programs  for  all
    the  protocol families.  In particular, the following TCP/IP family
    (TCP, UDP, ICMP, and  IP)  services  are  supported:    FTP,  SMTP,
    TELNET,  TFTP,  FINGER,  WHOIS,  DECwindows,  Domain  Name Service,
    LPR/LPD, the BSD "r" services (rlogin, rsh, rexec, rmt), TALK (both
    the  4.2BSD  and  4.3BSD  versions),  Network  Time Protocol (NTP),
    BOOTP,  SNMP  (agent),   and   GATED   (RIP,   HELLO,   and   EGP).
    Additionally,  the  PING,  TRACEROUTE, and TCPDUMP diagnostic tools
    are provided as standard features of MultiNet.    Optional  layered
    products  include  a VMS NFS Server and a VMS NFS Client (described
    in detail in their own sections elsewhere in this manual).

       MultiNet includes a 4.3BSD compatible socket library, as well as
    a  $QIO  interface  allowing  users to develop custom applications.
    Additionally, MultiNet supports a Novell  (formerly  Excelan)  EXOS
    compatible  $QIO  interface,  allowing  applications written to run
    over EXOS the ability to run  (without  recompiling  or  relinking)
    over MultiNet.

       MultiNet  supports  the  full  range  of  VAX processors running
    VAX/VMS   version   V4.5   or   greater   (including    symmetrical
    multiprocessing  support  under  VAX/VMS  Version  5).  All Digital
    Equipment  Corporation  Ethernet  interfaces  (e.g.  DELQA,  DELUA,
    DEBNI),  are supported and can be shared with other protocols (e.g.

2.8.5.3. TGV MultiNet NFS Client

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    MultiNet NFS Client

DESCRIPTION:

       The MultiNet NFS Client for VAX/VMS computer systems allows  VMS
    applications  to  transparently access files stored on NFS servers.
    The NFS Client can mount remote file systems on any system that has
    an  NFS  server.   The NFS Client device driver provides a standard
    file system interface and is called automatically by the normal VMS
    Record Management Services (RMS).

       Remote  NFS  servers  supporting  full  UNIX  (NFS)  file system
    semantics appear to VAX/VMS systems  as  fully-functional  Files-11
    ODS-2  file  systems.    This  includes  multinet file versions and
    arbitrary RMS file attributes.  Text files created on an NFS server

    the client.  On the server, they appear as normal  "stream"  files,
    thus  allowing  them  to be shared with applications running on the
    NFS server and  other  (including  non-VMS)  NFS  clients.    Other
    VAX/VMS  file  types are stored on the NFS server as "raw" VMS data
    blocks plus information  about  the  RMS  file  attributes.    This

    server and non-VMS systems to access the data, provided the non-VMS
    systems are capable of interpreting the "raw" VMS data blocks.

2.8.7.1. TCPware for VMS

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   TCPware for VMS

DESCRIPTION:

       TCPware  for VMS is a family of highly modular TCP/IP networking
    software products  designed  and  engineered  exclusively  for  the
    VAX/VMS environment. The products support all major TCP/IP user and
    server protocols on a variety of network  interface  hardware.  The
    following  software  products  are  members  of the TCPware for VMS
    family:

   1. - FTP-VMS

   2. - NFS-VMS

   3. - SMTP-VMS

   4. - TCP-VMS

   5. - TELNET-VMS

       As a result of the native VMS designs,  every  TCPware  for  VMS
    product   provides   unsurpassed   performance,   efficiency,   and
    reliability. Every TCPware for VMS product is also easy to  install
    and operate, and they use DEC's recommended VMSINSTAL procedure for
    automatic and trouble-free user installation.

       The TCP-VMS product provides the network  (IP,  ICMP,  ARP)  and
    host layer protocols (TCP, UPD), Domain Name Services, QIO and UNIX
    socket library interfaces, and a variety of support  utilities  for
    network  startup,  shutdown, gateway operation, and general network
    monitoring and management. A fully compliant  DECwindows  transport
    interface for VMS V5.3 or later is also included.

       Many  other  protocols  (BOOTPD,  TFTP,  WHOIS,  etc.)  are also
    supported by TCP-VMS.  TCP-VMS has complete SLIP support  for  both
    dialup  and dedicated serial lines, and an easy-to-use programmable
    IP interface that  can  be  used  to  add  full  TCP/IP  networking
    services on nearly any type of network interface available (such as
    X.25, T1, etc.). TCP-VMS also supports  IP  over  DECnet,  enabling
    separate TCP/IP LANs to be connected over WAN DECnet links.

       In  addition to supporting all standard DEC Ethernet interfaces,
    TCP-VMS is able to share the same Ethernet interface  hardware  and
    operate  concurrently with other protocol software (such as DECnet,
    LAT, and LAVC).

       The IP, TCP, and UDP protocol  layers  (together  with  ARP  and

                                    74



    ICMP) in TCP-VMS are implemented as true VMS I/O drivers running in
    kernel mode. Because TCP-VMS is engineered to take advantage of the
    VAX  architecture  and  the  VMS operating system, it provides high
    thruput with low CPU overhead and minimum memory resources.

       The FTP-VMS product provides both user and server file  transfer
    support.  Both  a native VMS and a UNIX-style command interface are
    provided for user initiated file transfers. FTP-VMS  also  supports
    full  file  protection  (both  ACL and UIC) exactly as DECnet does,
    preventing unauthorized file access from remote users.

       FTP-VMS has a complete online help facility, and it supports any
    number  of  simultaneous  users with any number of simultaneous FTP
    connections,  limited  only  by  available  VAX  system  resources.
    FTP-VMS  has  been  shown to operate faster than other software and
    hardware implementations.

       The NFS-VMS product is a full-featured NFS server that  provides
    transparent  access to VMS directories and files for authorized NFS
    hosts and users. NFS-VMS has been designed  with  both  performance
    and  security in mind. Users can increase NFS performance through a
    number of tuning parameters, such as datagram sizes,  cache  sizes,
    number  of server threads, etc. Security features such as PROXY and
    EXPORT databases, NFS rights identifiers, and security  logging  of
    access  violations are used to protect the VMS file system. NFS-VMS
    also supports the popular PC-NFS protocol.

       The SMTP-VMS product provides complete  support  of  the  Simple
    Mail   Transfer  Protcol  (SMTP)  through  the  standard  VMS  MAIL
    messaging system.  SMTP-VMS  supports  ARPA  internet  address  and
    message  formats,  and it lets users access other SMTP mail systems
    either locally or across the Internet.

       All of the features of VMS MAIL are available  transparently  to
    process  SMTP-VMS  messages,  including  distribution  name  lists,
    automatic notification of incoming mail, reading and  editing  mail
    messages,   etc.  SMTP-VMS  also  provides  immediate  delivery  of
    outgoing mail messages,  and  it  defers  delivery  to  unavailable
    hosts.  A  number  of  run-time  parameters can be set to customize
    SMTP-VMS, such as connection timeout  values,  delivery  check  and
    retry intervals, and maximum message life.

       The   TELNET-VMS  product  provides  complete  virtual  terminal
    networking  for  both  server  and  user  TELNET   functions.   The
    highly-efficient TELNET server has been designed for high-bandwidth
    applications. The server is implemented as a VMS I/O driver, and it
    operates  with only minimal CPU overhead. User TELNET functions are
    supported with a versatile and powerful utility used  to  establish
    TELNET  connections  with  remote  systems.  The  utility  supports
    multi-line recall, startup command files,  online  help,  definable
    keys,  VMS  process  spawning,  control character mapping, and much
    more.

       The TELNET-VMS product  also  supports  application  programmers
                                    75



    with a full set of library routines that can establish and maintain
    TELNET connections with remote hosts.

       The above FTP, NFS, SMTP,  and  TELNET-VMS  products  provide  a
    superior  method  of  networking,  since  they  can  be used either
    standalone  or  in  any  combination,   making   them   ideal   for
    applications that may need to grow.

       And  all  TCPware  for VMS products protect a user's investment,
    since they are designed and engineered  for  superior  performance,
    efficiency, and reliability at competitive costs.

       With  the  NETBIOS interface, users can run NETBIOS applications
    on top of  TCP/  IP  protocols  and  communicate  with  other  PCs,
    servers,  and  hosts.  The LAN WorkPlace Socket Library can be used
    to develop networking applications.    With  either  of  these  two
    packages,  users  can  run  both  NETBIOS  applications and TCP/ IP
    applications concurrently, on the same PC.  The software is shipped
    on  floppy  disks.    Installation and diagnostics software is also
    provided.

2.14.1.1. Amateur Radio KA9Q TCP/IP

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   KA9Q/NET

DESCRIPTION:

       This  package  provides  the  Internet  protocols  on the IBM PC
    running MS-DOS.  It was designed primarily for amateur packet radio
    use.   Except where otherwise noted, it was designed and written by
    Phil Karn, KA9Q (karn@louie.udel.edu).

       The following protocols are included:

       1. SMTP client and server.  The server does not support aliasing
    or  forwarding; all recipients must be local.  A standalone command
    for sending mail is included in the distribution; it was written by
    Bdale Garbee, N3EUA (bdale%winfree.uucp@flash.bellcore.com).

       2.  FTP client and server.  Image and ASCII types are supported.
    There is no access control as yet on the server (this is  difficult
    to do under MS-DOS).

       3.  Telnet client and "server".  The client understands the ECHO
    option.    The  "server"  merely  allows  for  keyboard-to-keyboard
    chatting, since MS-DOS isn't a timesharing system.

       4. TCP echo and discard servers.

       5.  TCP.  Multiple connections are supported.  A lot of work has
    gone into tuning the implementation for operation over a  VERY  bad
    path, namely the amateur packet radio channel.

       6. UDP.

       7.  IP/ICMP.    At  present  only manually specified default and
    host-specific routing table entries are supported ("fully connected
    subnets" do not as yet exist in amateur packet radio).  Most of the
    useful IP and ICMP options are supported.

       8. Ethernet/ARP, for the 3-Com 3C-500 controller.

       9. SLIP, compatible with Rick Adam's driver under Berkeley UNIX.
    The PC's regular asynchronous adapter ports are used.

       10. AX.25/ARP, a special serial line mode for operation atop the
    amateur packet radio link level protocol AX.25.  IP  datagrams  are

                                    95



    encapsulated  in AX.25 UI (connectionless) frames.  ARP resolves IP
    addresses into AX.25 callsigns.  The resulting packets are sent out
    the  asynch  port  in  SLIP-style  framing  to a TNC (Terminal Node
    Controller) which reformats  them  in  HDLC  and  does  the  actual
    transmission.      "KISS   TNC"   code   by  Mike  Chepponis,  K3MC
    (chepponis@xx.lcs.mit.edu) for the TAPR TNC-2 is  included  in  the
    distribution.

       There is as yet no support for domain names; hosts are specified
    by their IP addresses.  Internally, the package is structured as  a
    simple  commutator  loop  with  extensive  use  of  upcalls between
    adjacent layers.  Additional applications are fairly easy to add if
    they are structured as event-driven state machines.

DOCUMENTATION:

       Several  text  files  (user's guide, programming reference, etc)
    are included in the distribution.

2.14.11.1. Netcom II
PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    Netcom II

DESCRIPTION:

Netcom II connects 286 or 386-based computers running UNIX to public
packet-switched data networks around the world.  Netcom II is a complete
implementation of the X.25 protocol for AT-bus and MCA machines.  Netcom II
runs under the following operating systems:
  - AT & T UNIX V 3.2
  - Interactive Systems 386/ix 1.0.x and 2.0.x
  - SCO UNIX V 3.2
  - SCO Xenix 386 and 286

Netcom II operates as either a packet-mode DTE or DCE, using either the 198
or 1984 versions of the X.25 protocol.

PAD SUPPORT FOR CONNECTIVITY
  Remote users connecting from asynchronous terminals via PADs can log in t
  a machine equipped with Netcom II and use all UNIX utilities or
  applications programs.  Netcom II maps stty calls which modify TERMIO
  flags to commands to the remote PAD in order to reduce packet charges and
  response time.
  Netcom II also provides a PAD utility which users can connect to remote
  hosts.

AUTOMATIC FILE TRANSFER
  Using our tty interface, uucp can carry files across packet network
  connections to other machines supporting uucp.
  Both electronic mail and remote printers can use these facilities for fil
  transfer.

OPEN SYSTEMS INTERCONNECTION PROTOCOLS
  X.25 corresponds to the lowest three layers (Physical, Link, and Network)
  of the Open Systems Interconnection communications architecture.  As
  Netcom II supplies an application interface which gives the programmer
  full control over Switched Virtual Circuit connections, it greatly reduce
  the effort required to develop OSI applications.

INCOMING CALL CONTROL
  A UNIX application can arrange to be informed of each and every call whic
  arrives from the network.  The application can choose to clear or accept
  the call, pass it to another application, or switch it to login.
  We supply a table-driven incoming call daemon, X25daemon, which provides
  method for routing calls based on addressing information, call user data,
  or subnet addresses.

2.14.11.2. NetcomRouter for Netcom II

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    NetcomRouter for Netcom II

DESCRIPTION:

       NetcomRouter  is  a  software add-on to Netcom II which enhances
    the product by adding IP routing  capabilities  over  X.25  virtual
    circuits.   NetcomRouter can be used to connect single workstations
    to remote TCP/IP networks, or for providing gateway  functions  for
    connecting networks.

       It  consists  of  a  streams  module which links a streams-based
    TCP/IP package with Netcom II.  Using it, all  facilities  normally
    operating  over  an  Ethernet  link  will also operate over an X.25
    public data network or synchronous private  line,  subject  to  the
    additional delays involved in packet-switched applications.

2.15.2.1. Mitek OpenConnect Systems TELNET/FTP CLIENTS, FTP SERVER and FTP
          BATCH

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:  TELNET/FTP CLIENTS, FTP SERVER and FTP BATCH
                        ENHANCEMENT FOR MVS

DESCRIPTION:

       Mitek's TELNET/FTP Clients are IBM host  software  options  that
    execute  as TSO commands. Since both applications reside under TSO,
    the  standard  IBM  environment  is  preserved.  Communication   is
    provided  to  the  IBM  systems  through  VTAM. Mitek's OpenConnect
    Server attaches to the IBM host as an IBM  PU  type  2  device  and
    provides the SNA to TCP/IP network interface.

       Mitek's  TSO Telnet Client application allows a 3270 terminal to
    emulate a line-mode terminal on the TCP/IP network. In  this  mode,
    the  3270  terminal  has  access  to all applications on any of the
    TCP/IP network processors  or  other  gateways  such  as  DDN  that
    support   TELNET   terminals.  The  TELNET  Client  application  is
    accessible from any terminal on the SNA network.

       With  Mitek's  TSO  FTP  Client  application,   files   can   be
    transferred  to  or  from  any processor on the TCP/IP network. Any
    3270 on the  SNA  network,  any  terminal  using  Mitek's  PS  3270
    emulation  on  the  TCP/IP  network,  or any terminal using Mitek's
    TELNET Server can initiate the FTP File Transfer.    The  FTP  File
    Transfer feature has options for source or binary code transmission
    and for insertion or stripping of carriage returns.

       Like the FTP Client, the FTP Batch enhancement under MVS is used
    to  transfer  files  to  or from any processor on a TCP/IP network.
    However,  FTP  Batch  allows  the  user  to  sequentially  transfer
    numerous  files  automatically,  rather than interactively transfer
    one file at a time.

       Mitek's FTP Server resides on the IBM host and carries out  file
    transfer requests from Ethernet hosts.

2.15.2.2. Mitek Systems TELNET Server Version 3

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:  TELNET Server Version 3

DESCRIPTION:

       TELNET   Server  Version  3  is  an  optional  software  feature
    available for Mitek Systems' OpenConnect Server  Models  M2030  and
    M2130.    This  option  permits  terminals  or  systems on a TCP/IP
    network which support a TELNET client to connect to the SNA Network
    Server  and use the full-screen SNA 3270 emulation in the Server to
    access IBM mainframes  or  midrange  systems  on  an  SNA  Network.
    TELNET Server Version 3 emulates an IBM 3278 Model 2.

       Most  importantly,  TELNET  Server Version 3 allows asynchronous
    applications on the IBM mainframe to access asynchronous  terminals
    on  a  TCP/IP  network.    The product provides high-speed graphics
    passthru from  IBM  mainframes  to  any  asynchronous  terminal  or
    workstation.

       TELNET   Server   Version   3  supports  Tektronix  CX  graphics
    applications on the IBM host, which means  that  any  user  who  is
    operating  a  computer  running  TCP/IP  and a telnet client with a
    terminal capable of interpreting Tektronix graphics can have access
    to  the  graphics applications on the IBM mainframe.  Telnet Server
    Version 3 high-speed graphics passthru can operate under either MVS
    or VM.  Telnet Server Version 3 also supports TN3270.

2.15.2.3. Mitek OpenConnect Systems Telnet Client Full Screen Option

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:  Telnet Client Full Screen Option

DESCRIPTION:

       Up   until   now,  in  order  to  have  full  screen  access  to
    asynchronous networks or computer systems, you needed  to  have  an
    asynchronous   terminal  installed  alongside  your  IBM  3270-type
    terminal.

       Not any more.

       With Mitek's Telnet Client Full Screen software, you  can  allow
    your  IBM  3270  to  connect to asychronous systems on the Ethernet
    Network, whenever you choose.

       Mitek's Telnet Client Full Screen  is  the  software  innovation
    that  enables  any  IBM 3270 terminal to have full screen access to
    asychronous computer applications on an  Ethernet  Network.    When
    Mitek's  Telnet  Client  Full  Screen  software  is  installed, the
    asychronous system residing on the Ethernet Network sees  your  IBM
    3270 as if it were an asynchronous ASCII terminal.

       Telnet  Client  Full Screen resides on IBM systems which run the
    VM and MVS operating systems as well as VTAM.  Telnet  Client  Full
    Screen also supports the TN3270 Client.

2.17.1.2. K-Talk

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:  K-Talk

DESCRIPTION:

       K-Talk is a  software  development  platform  that  enables  the
    development of AppleTalk-based applications for UNIX hosts.  K-Talk
    consists of two parts:  user libraries available from Mt. Xinu; and
    kernel  modifications  for  the  UNIX  operating  system.  The user
    libraries give programmers the ability to write applications  based
    on   AppleTalk   protocols   running   on   UNIX,  and  the  kernel
    modifications allow the UNIX Ethernet driver to recognize AppleTalk
    as  a  valid  protocol  type,  allowing  Macintosh  applications to
    communicate using AppleTalk.  UNIX hosts appear as AppleTalk  nodes
    on  an  Ethernet  network.  UNIX  vendors  who have licensed K-Talk
    include TOPS,  Sun  Microsystems,  Inc.,  Pyramid  Technology,  and
    Integrated  Solutions.    K-Talk  is also available on ULTRIX-based
    Digital VAXes.

DESCRIPTION:

       SCO NFS provides file-sharing connections across a TCP/IP LAN to
    other  Sun-compatible  Network  File  System (NFS) implementations,
    allowing users on one machine to transparently and directly  access
    files  residing on a remote machine.  SCO NFS features "client" and
    "server"  functionality,  and  standard  RPC  and  XDR   libraries.
    Running on top of SCO TCP/IP, SCO NFS is also compatible with other
    TCP/IP packages that  provides  BSD  standard  4.3  socket  library
    support for the SCO XENIX environment.

DESCRIPTION:

       The SCO Xsight Family of products - SCO Xsight and PS  Xsight  -
    provide  the  industry-standard,  high-performance  X Window System
    technology for both SCO XENIX and DOS systems.  Both are  based  on
    version  II  of  the  X Window System, the network-based (Ethernet)
    graphical windowing system  from  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of
    Technology.   SCO Xsight brings the windowing power of the X Window
    System  to  SCO  XENIX  Systems  while  PC  Xsight  provides   this
    functionality for PCs running MS-DOS.

       SCO  Xsight  enables  users  to  easily  invoke,  simultaneously
    monitor, and control multiple concurrent XENIX processes on one  or
    any  number  of  network-controlled systems. With a mouse, standard
    keyboard, and bit-mapped  display,  users  can  create,  move,  and
    resize windows at will.

       PC  Xsight provides SCO Xsight's X Window System capabilities on
    PCs running MS-DOS. PC Xsight enables DOS PCs with TCP/IP  hardware
    and  software  to  be  used as inexpensive network-based servers to
    XENIX clients running SCO Xsight.

2.24.2.5. Unisys A Series Systems

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    A Series TCP/IP

DESCRIPTION:

       The  Unisys  A  Series  TCP/IP  product augments the BNA network
    products by supporting communication with other Unisys systems  and
    other  vendor  systems  employing  DDN  protocols.  DDN software is
    implemented partly in  the  mainframe  and  partly  in  the  CP2000
    communications  processor.    The  DDN connections provided are the
    standard X.25 IMP and  other  X.25  packet  network  interfaces  at
    speeds  up to 64 Kbps, and IEEE 802.3 local area network interfaces
    at 10 Mbps.  Telnet,  FTP,  and  SMTP  protocols  and  programmatic
    interfaces  to  multiple  layers are supported above TCP/IP and are
    integral to BNA Host Services.  Several mainframes may  access  the
    DDN  through  the  same CP2000 via an IEEE 802.3 LAN, in which case
    the communications processor supports the EGP protocol.    Multiple
    X.25 connections may be supported by a single CP2000 communications
    processor.  In addition, the CP2000  communications  processor  can
    support   attachment  to  an  IEEE  802.3  LAN  and  uses  Ethernet
    compatible frames and the ARP protocol.  BNA sessions are supported
    using the DDN or IEEE 802.3 LAN for transport between BNA nodes.

2.25.1. TIM

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:  TIM

DESCRIPTION:

       The TIM network application program interface is: 1) an enabling
    technology    which    provides   rapid   distributed   application
    development, 2) machine independent, allowing easy  portability  of
    code,  3) a transitional technology which will allow easy migration
    from TCP/IP to OSI networks, and 4)  a  toolkit  for  interactively
    debugging and exercising applications across heterogeneous systems.
    Users will be able to simply swap  out  TIM/TCP  and  relink  their
    applications  with TIM/OSI.  The TIM network API lets users get the
    maximum benefit from TCP-based applications, as well as provides an
    easy  to  implement  transition  strategy  from one network type to
    another.

2.27.1.1. VINES TCP/IP Routing Option

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   VINES TCP/IP Routing Option

DESCRIPTION:

       Banyan  Systems  Inc.  develops  and  markets  VINES  -- virtual
    networking software that allows  network  resources  to  appear  as
    transparent  extensions  to  local  PCs.  VINES integrates multiple
    communications  technologies,  including   local-   and   wide-area
    network,  mini  and  mainframe  links.    The  company also markets
    high-performance, multi-function  network  servers  which  run  the
    VINES network operating system while providing internetwork support
    for a variety of popular local area networks.

       The  VINES  TCP/IP  Routing  option  allows  a   Banyan   Server
    (VINES/386,  DTS,  BNS  or CNS) to route IP frames.  This enables a
    single Banyan server or a network  of  Banyan  servers  to  connect
    multiple TCP/IP hosts or networks.

       This  option  supports  connections  between TCP/IP networks and
    Banyan servers over Ethernet (3Com 3C501 and 3C505, Micom- Interlan
    NI5010  and  NI5210, and Ungermann-Bass NIC), IEEE 802.5 Token Ring
    (IBM and Proteon ProNET-4), and Proteon ProNET-10.

       This option is available with VINES Release 3.0 and later.

       Connections between TCP/IP networks and Banyan servers over 3Com
    3C603  Token  Ring and 3Com 3C503 Ethernet are supported with VINES
    Release 3.10.

DESCRIPTION:

       Banyan Systems  Inc.  develops  and  markets  VINES  --  virtual
    networking  software  that  allows  network  resources to appear as
    transparent extensions to local PCs.    VINES  integrates  multiple
    communications   technologies,   including   local-  and  wide-area
    network, mini and  mainframe  links.    The  company  also  markets
    high-performance,  multi-function  network  servers  which  run the
    VINES network operating system while providing internetwork support
    for a variety of popular local area networks.

       The  VINES  TCP/IP  Server-to-Server  option  allows two or more
    Banyan  servers  to  communicate  across  a  TCP/IP  network.    IP
    internetting  is  available  across Ethernet (3Com 3C501 and 3C505,
    Micom-Interlan NI5010 and NI5210,  and  Ungermann-Bass  NIC),  IEEE
    802.5  Token Ring (IBM and Proteon ProNet-4), and Proteon ProNET-10
    networks.

       This option is attractive to customers with access to  a  TCP/IP
    backbone  who need to connect remote Banyan servers.  VINES packets
    originating from one Banyan server and destined for a remote Banyan
    server  are  encapsulated  in  IP  protocol headers to be routed by
    non-Banyan IP routers through a TCP/IP network.

       This option is available with VINES Release 3.0. and later.

DOCUMENTATION:

       The TCP/IP option guide is included.

    and network protocols from the user and is  applicable  to  a  wide
    variety of both local and wide-area networks.

       All  standard UNIX features are unchanged by FREEDOMNET software
    in form and meaning, with inter-machine communication taking  place
    as  necessary.    With  FREEDOMNET  software,  it  is possible, for
    example, for a user to access files and  peripheral  devices  on  a
    remote  machine  by  specifying  a directory on a remote machine as
    being his current working  directory,  requesting  execution  of  a
    program  on  a  remote machine, or redirecting input and/or output.
    These standard  UNIX  features  can  be  used  without  the  user's
    conscious  concern  for  the  fact  that several machines and their
    peripherals  may  be  involved.    FREEDOMNET  preserves  all  UNIX
    semantics in order to achieve transparency.

       Because  FREEDOMNET  preserves  all  UNIX semantics, it provides
    true transparency from the user's point of  view.    This  includes
    transparency  in  a  heterogeneous environment where differences in
    machine architecture (and UNIX implementation) must be masked.  The
    FREEDOMNET  "stateful"  server  approach  allows  for remote device
    sharing and for remote execution of programs.  The  fact  that  the
    standard  UNIX  file naming syntax is used to refer to remote files
    and  devices  makes  FREEDOMNET  very  easy  to   learn   and   use
    effectively.    In  addition,  existing programs (UNIX commands and
    user-written applications)  can  be  made  "distributable"  without
    modification  due  to the consistent naming scheme and preservation
    of  all  UNIX  semantics.    FREEDOMNET  provides   a   basis   for
    implementing   high-performance,   fault   tolerant,   and   secure
    distributed computing systems.

       FREEDOMNET is added to the UNIX  kernel  much  like  a  standard
    device  driver.  No kernel source changes are required.  FREEDOMNET
    uses  the  User  Datagram  Protocol  (UDP)  on  Ethernet,  but   is
    implemented  so  as  to  be  independent  of  network  hardware and
    protocols.

2.27.8.1. X.25 Interface Package

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    X.25 Interface Package (XIP)

DESCRIPTION:

       XIP  is  a  portable implementation of the CCITT (1980 and 1984)
    X.25 protocol.  It  is  a  full  implementation  of  the  protocol,
    allowing not only full negotiation of per-call facilities, but also
    configuration  via  registration  packets  and   operation   in   a
    multi-link  environment  using  MLP.    XIP  also  provides the OSI
    addressing extensions to X.25 for use in OSI protocol environments.

       Implementations of XIP have been certified in  Europe  (Germany,
    Austria,  Spain,  Britain),  North America (Tymnet, Sprint Telenet,
    Datapac, Infoswitch), and the Far East (Japan).

DOCUMENTATION:

  Functional Specification:
        Describes functional characteristics of the protocol.
  Porting Guide:
        Describes the software engineering steps to follow in porting XIP t
        a new hardware/software environment.
  Internals Documentation:
        Full description of the protocol implementation: state machines,
        buffer handling, code flow, process dispatching conditions and
        utility routines are all covered.

MACHINE TYPE:

       XIP  has   been   implemented   on   a   number   of   different
    microprocessor-based  systems  -  Motorola  68000, Intel 80x86, and
    Zilog Z8000.

O/S:

       XIP has been used in a number of dedicated  real-time  scheduler
    OS  environments,  including  VRTX and pSOS.  It does not require a
    scheduler for operation.

2.27.9.1. TN3270

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   TN3270

DESCRIPTION:

       Version 4.1 of tn3270 is now available. Tn3270 emulates  an  IBM
    3278 over TCP/IP.

       Significant features to tn3270 are:

       - Error  messages,  in English, overlay a portion of the screen
         when the user  types  an  erroneous  entry  (invalid  control
         sequence,  attempt  to  enter  data  in an "input disallowed"
         field, etc.).

       - Ability to "escape to shell".  This,  by  itself,  is  mostly
         useful in a non-BSD system.

       - An  Application  Programming  Interface  (API).   This allows
         programs, running under Unix, to  read  and  write  the  3270
         screen,  and to send keystrokes (3270) to tn3270.  This makes
         use of the "escape  to  shell"  feature.    Included  in  the
         distribution is a program which uses the API to receive files
         sent from the IBM host (we don't supply the IBM side at  this
         point, and the protocol is likely to change in the future).

       - Yale ASCII/7171/4994 "transparent" mode is fully implemented.
         SAS-Graph,  for  example,  supports  doing  graphics  to  TEK
         terminals  over  this  interface.    Locally,  we  use  the X
         windowing system terminal emulator  (xterm),  which  provides
         some  TEK  emulation,  to  display  SAS-Graph graphics on our
         workstations.

       - Mset now prints out program function (PF) keys  in  numerical
         order.

       The  new  version  is  also availble for anonymous ftp from host
    arpa.berkeley.edu,  in  directory  pub,  in  file   tn3270.tar   or
    tn3270.tar.Z.    The  file  should  be  retrieved in "binary" mode.
    These are large files (700 Kbytes and 300 Kbytes respectively),  so
    requestors  should consider ordering the product by mail instead of
    using ftp.

2.27.10.1. The ISO Development Environment

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   The ISO Development Environment (ISODE 6.0)

DESCRIPTION:

       This  software  supports the development of certain kinds of OSI
    protocols and applications.

       Current modules include:

       - OSI transport service (TP0 on  top  of  TCP,  X.25;  TP4  for
         SunLink OSI)

       - OSI session, presentation, and association control services

       - ASN.1 abstract syntax/transfer notation tools, including:

            * remote  oerpations  stub-generator (front-end for remote
              operations)

            * structure generator (ASN.1 to C)

            * element-parser (basic encoding rules)

       - OSI reliable transfer and remote operations services

       - OSI file transfer, access and management

       - FTAM/FTP gateway

       - OSI directory services

       - OSI virtual terminal (basic calss, TELNET profile)

       ISODE 6.0 consists of final "IS" level  implementations  with  a
    few  exceptions.   ROSE and RTSE are current to the last circulated
    drafts (March, 1988); VT is a DIS implementation.  The  ISODE  also
    contains implementations of the 1984 X.400 versions of ROS and RTS.
    ISODE is aligned with the U.S. Government OSI Profile (GOSIP).

       Fugure modules planned for the next release include:

       - OSI message handling system

       - MHS/SMTP gateway

       Although the ISODE is not "supported" per se,  it  does  have  a
    problem  reporting  address, Bug-ISODE@NISC.NYSER.NET.  Bug reports
    (and fixes) are welcome by the way.

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:  K-Talk

DESCRIPTION:

       K-Talk is a  software  development  platform  that  enables  the
    development of AppleTalk-based applications for UNIX hosts.  K-Talk
    consists of two parts:  user libraries available from Kinetics; and
    kernel  modifications  for  the  UNIX  operating  system.  The user
    libraries give programmers the ability to write applications  based
    on   AppleTalk   protocols   running   on   UNIX,  and  the  kernel
    modifications allow the UNIX Ethernet driver to recognize AppleTalk
    as  a  valid  protocol  type,  allowing  Macintosh  applications to
    communicate using AppleTalk.  UNIX hosts appear as AppleTalk  nodes
    on  an  Ethernet  network.  UNIX  vendors  who have licensed K-Talk
    include TOPS,  Sun  Microsystems,  Inc.,  Pyramid  Technology,  and
    Integrated  Solutions.    K-Talk  is also available on ULTRIX-based
    Digital VAXes.

3.2.1. Network Access Controller

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    Network Access Controller (NAC)

DESCRIPTION:

       The  Aydin  Network  Access  Component (NAC) is a DDN attachment
    device  providing  X.25  PAD  capability  to  terminals  and  hosts
    computers.    The NAC will concentrate multiple sysnchronous and/or
    asynchronous devices onto the DDN.

o     Interacts with the network control center to support network
      surveillance and management.  Much of this interaction is automatic,
      consisting of status, abnormal event and control messages.

o     Certified to operate on secure networks:
         -  Blacker compatible
         -  Operates with KG84 equipment
         -  Tempest Certified
         -  EMI/HEMP Certified

Synchronous Device Support:
      o  3270 Bisync terminals, hosts and printers
            - Data rates up to 19.2 kbs
      o  3270 SNA terminals, hosts and printers
            - LU1
            - LU2
            - LU3
            - Data rates up to 56 kbs
      o     File transfers between host computers and PC's using IND$FILE.
            Both CUT and DFT devices are supported.
      o  Interoperability with IBM X.25 NPSI products
      o  Interoperability with IBM MVS TCP/IP products
      o  Performs host emulation for synchronous devices so that the
         devices poll locally and not through the network.  This increases
         performance and reduces network charges.  Because of this feature,
         NAC allows for interoperability of dissimilar equipment: synchrono
         to asynchronous protocol conversion.

The NAC provides a full suite of communication protocols:
      -  X.25
         * DDN certified for DoD applications
         * CCITT 1984 including X.3, X.28, X.29
      -  Telnet
      -  Transmission Control Protocol          - TCP
      -  Internet Protocol                      - IP
      -  Host Monitoring Protocol               - HMP
      -  Internet Control Message Protocol      - ICMP
      -  Display System Protocol                - DSP

                                    233



      -  3270 Bisync
      -  3270 SNA
      -  Synchronous Data Link Control          - SDLC
      -  SNA LU6.2
      -  Qualified Logical Link Control         - QLLC
      -  Host Front end Protocol                - HFP
      -  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol          - SMTP
      -  File Transfer Protocol                 - FTP
      -  IEEE 802.3 Ethernet
      -  Address Resolution Protocol            - ARP


       The NAC  can  be  configured  as  a  gateway  allowing  for  the
    interconnection  of dissimilar networks.  Also, the NAC can perform
    IP routing for interconnectiong LAN to LAN, LAN to WAN and  WAN  to
    WAN.

    communicate  over  DDN.    The  hardware consists of an intelligent
    communications controller (AdCom2-I) with 1/2 Megabyte of local RAM
    and  MIL-188-144, Mil-188C interfaces.  The X.25 resides in the RAM
    on board and is executed by the local CPU (80188).  The  TCP/IP  is
    loaded  in  the  local  RAM  from  the  PC.  The resident real time
    operating system (VRTX) allows the highest performance execution of
    X.25  and  TCP/IP.    The  ADCom2-I  also  runs 3270 SNA/SDLC, 3270
    Bisync,  and  Async  terminal  emulations.      Implementation   of
    FTP/TELNET/SMTP  is  done  on  the  PC/AT  side.    The software is
    certified by DCA and runs on 386  machines  such  as  Zenith  Z386.
    Software  support for Blacker and Fischer International Watchdog is
    available.

    workstation on the LAN, or  on  a  different  network.    The  6130
    supports the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), the Simple Mail Transfer
    Protocol  (SMTP)  and  the  Virtual  Terminal  protocol   (Telnet).
    Tektronix  has  implemented a Distributed File System that allows a
    workstation to access files on other workstations  as  though  they
    were  resident  locally.    The  6130  can  support up to 14 RS-232
    terminals although 2 or 3 users per system is recommended.

DOCUMENTATION:

       The documentation set that is included with the 6130 consists of
    ten   well   written   manuals  which  cover  system  installation,
    operations,  system   administration,   and   extensive   reference
    material.  Over  40  other manuals are available which describe the
    language compilers, statistical software, spreadsheet programs, and
    other software and enhancement products.

3.20.2.1. Mitek OpenConnect Server

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   OpenConnect Server

DESCRIPTION:

       The  OpenConnect  Server is a high performance hardware/software
    set of products which permits the workstations of systems  attached
    to  a  TCP/IP  IEEE  802.3  LAN  to  connect to an IBM mainframe as
    SNA3270 or SNA3770  devices.    The  system  supports  64  LU's  of
    terminal  emulation,  PC  file transfer and API's for both 3270 and
    3770.  No mainframe software is added or changed.

       The OpenConnect Server consists of a hardware Control  Unit  and
    software  (Presentation  Services)  for the LAN attached computers.
    The Control Unit is a M68000 based system which  connects  the  LAN
    TCP/IP 802.3 network to an IBM mainframe as a PU2 device via direct
    channel attach or via SDLC data link.

       Presentation Services is a software applications  package  which
    is  executed on the LAN attached computers such as VAX, PC's, 3B's,
    Apollo, Sun or HP to provide network administration  and  the  user
    interface  for  SNA3270  and  3770  emulation.  Several enhancement
    features such as color and extended highlighting are included.

       The Server implements two network management protocols,  Network
    Management  Vector  Transport (NMVT) support for IBM's Netview, and
    Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Agent for SNMP management
    on  a  TCP/IP network.  Support is provided for IP subnets which is
    used in TCP/IP networks to permit a single network address to  span
    multiple  physical  networks.    M2533  Token  Ring Server provides
    transparent connectivity between the IBM Token Ring environment and
    TCP/IP  hosts  on  an  Ethernet  local  area  network and runs on a
    PC-AT-80386 system.

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:  Presentation Services

DESCRIPTION:

       The  OpenConect  Server/Presentation Services (OCS/PS) are Mitek
    Systems'  licensed  software  products.    These  products   enable
    workstation users on an Ethernet TCP/IP local area network (LAN) to
    connect to IBM SNA mainframe systems via Mitek's OpenConnect Server
    hardware products.  OCS/PS is workstation executable software which
    runs on all UNIX-based computers and workstations as well  as  many
    others.    Collectively, these include devices manufactured by SUN,
    Apollo, Counterpoint, Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment Corp.  and
    IBM.   Mitek's Presentation Services software products enable users
    to transfer files from computers on  a  LAN  to  an  SNA  mainframe
    computer,  to  access  IBM  3270  applications, and to emulate 3770
    Remote Job Entry (RJE).  The software also provides an Applications
    Program  Interface  (API),  which  allows  user applications on the
    workstation access to the SNA mainframe computer.  The use of these
    products  does  not  require  special  software nor does it require
    software change in the IBM SNA mainframe operating system.

       OpenConnect/TN3270 Presentation Services Version 3 is  a  family
    of  software-  only  products  which  offers  3270 service to IBM's
    TCP/IP. The capabilities of this product, which use  Berkeley's  TN
    protocol,  are:  3270 terminal emulation, 3179G graphics emulation,
    3287 printer support, PC file transfer and an  Application  Program
    Interface (API) which allows programs written in C to automatically
    access IBM hosts.

3.20.2.3. Mitek Connectivity Solutions for the IBM Application

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:  Connectivity Solutions for the IBM Application
                        System/400 (AS/400)

DESCRIPTION:

       Mitek extends connectivity from your AS/400 to  TCP/IP  networks
    with  a  special  line  of  hardware and software solutions.  These
    product solutions provide bi-directional logon  and  bi-directional
    file transfer capabilities.  Mitek utilizes the government standard
    communications architecture known as TCP/IP  (Transmission  Control
    Protocol/Internet  Protocol)  which  can coexist on an Ethernet LAN
    along with other protocols such as  DECnet.    The  Ethernet  hosts
    supported  by  Mitek's software products include: DEC VAX, AT&T 3B,
    SUN Microsystems, Apollo, Tektronix, Hewlett-Packard, IBM  PC,  AT,
    RT,  XT,  and  PS/2.  You choose the solution that's right for your
    configuration:

       - OpenConnect Server  Model  M2130  Mitek's  M2130  provides  a
         physical gateway between the AS/400 and an Ethernet LAN.  The
         M2130 appears to the AS/400 as a standard  SNA  control  unit
         and  performs data translation between the SNA and the TCP/IP
         protocols.  Speeds up to 256K bps are supported.

       - TELNET Client (TERMINAL  APPLICATION  ACCESS)  Telnet  client
         resides  on  the AS/400 and provides access capability to the
         TCP/IP host applications.  This product communicates with the
         standard TCP/IP terminal application, TELNET Server.

       - FTP  Client  (FILE TRANSFER) FTP Client resides on the AS/400
         and provides you with the capability to create,  delete,  and
         extend  files  with  options  for  ASCII  text conversions or
         binary data transmission.  Exits are provided so that you may
         write  you  own data base access routines as part of the file
         transfer.  The security systems of the AS/400 and the  TCP/IP
         network hosts are supported.

         FTP  Client  also  includes an extended command feature which
         allows you to enter a simple command  in  order  to  transfer
         multiple files between multiple systems.  This feature can be
         used interactively as well as in a batch environment.

       - TELNET Server Telnet  Server  is  an  optional  feature  that
         resides  on  the  M2130.    This  application  provides  3270
         terminal emulation.  TELNET  Server  allows  TCP/IP  Ethernet
         hosts  to  have  access  to  the  AS/400.  The server handles
         requests from  a  TELNET  Client  on  any  TCP/IP  hosts  and
         translates the ASCII data stream into a 3270 data stream.

       - 3270 Presentation Services 3270 Presentation Services resides
         on  TCP/IP  Ethernet  hosts  and   provides   enhanced   3270
         emulation.    A  special  feature  of  this  product  is  the

                                    303



         Application Program Interface (API).  A user written  program
         using  the  API  can  access the AS/400 as if the application
         were an operator at a  local  display  station.    It  allows
         emulator  sessions  to  run  unattended.    3270 Presentation
         Services is a family of products  designed  to  operate  with
         specific operating systems.

4.3.1. LANalyzer EX 5000 Series Network Analyzers

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:  LANalyzer EX 5000 Series Network Analyzers

DESCRIPTION:

       The  LANalyzer  EX5000  Series  comprises  Excelan's   versatile
    third-generation  network  analyzer  systems.   These analyzers let
    OEMs, systems integrators, and end users monitor network  activity,
    troubleshoot problems, debug protocol and application software, and
    fine-tune network performance.  The  portability  provided  by  the
    COMPAQ  PORTABLE  II and installed LANalyzer system is an important
    asset to field service and support departments --  especially  when
    combined  with  "Carbon  Copy  PLUS" communications software, which
    allows LANalyzer test control from any  remote  Personal  Computer.
    All  LANalyzer  systems have easy-to-use mouse and menu interfaces,
    on-line HELP, and built-  in,  simple  "quick  tests"  for  network
    troubleshooters.

       The  LANalyzer EX5000 series can: monitor and capture up to 100%
    of the packets based on user-defined criteria,  timestamp  captured
    packets, display test statistics in real time or save them to a DOS
    file, perform TDR-like cable checking, decode TCP/IP,  DECnet,  XNS
    and  other  protocols,  and  generate controlled amounts of network
    traffic.

       In  addition,  Excelan's  LAN  WorkPlace  software  for  PC  DOS
    provides concurrent access to applications and TCP/IP hosts.  Thus,
    the PC or compatible that runs the LANalyzer program can  become  a
    node  on the Ethernet network without requiring purchase of an EXOS
    205E or EXOS 205T controller.

       Additionally,  a  StarLAN  adapter  board   is   available   for
    monitoring  of  StarLAN  networks, and EXOS TCP/IP Network Software
    for DOS can also be run on any PC LANalyzer.

4.4.1. FTP Software LANWatch

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    LANWatch 2.0

DESCRIPTION:

       LANWatch  is  an  inexpensive,  powerful  and  flexible  network
    analyzer which runs under DOS on personal computers and requires no
    hardware modifications to either the host or the  network.  Network
    managers  using  LANWatch  can  inspect traffic patterns and packet
    errors  to  isolate  performance  problems  and  bottlenecks,   and
    protocol  developers  can use LANWatch to inspect and verify proper
    protocol handling.

       LANWatch has two operating modes: Display  Mode  traces  network
    traffic  by  displaying  captured packets in real-time, and Examine
    Mode allows you to scroll back through stored  packets  to  inspect
    them in detail.  To select a subset of packets for display, storage
    or retrieval, there is an extensive set of  built-in  filters.  The
    built-in  filters  include  alarm, trigger, capture, load, save and
    search; they can be controlled separately to  match  on  source  or
    destination  address,  protocol, or packet contents at the hardware
    and transport layers.  LANWatch  also  includes  sufficient  source
    code  so  users can modify the existing filters and parsers, or add
    new ones. LANWatch is available on a variety of  network  interface
    cards, for Ethernet, Starlan and Token Ring.

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:    HP 4972A LAN Protocol Analyzer

DESCRIPTION:

       The HP 4972A local area network protocol analyzer  is  used  for
    performance  management  and  for  troubleshooting problems on IEEE
    802.3, Ethernet, or StarLAN local area  networks.    The  HP  4972A
    provides  accurate  and  complete  information  under all operating
    conditions.  The HP 4972A provides a comprehensive,  easy  to  use,
    diagnostic  tool  for  fast  problem isolation and maintenance.  It
    monitors traffic on the network,  generates  data  frames  to  test
    other nodes, and gathers statistics to verify network performance.

       To assist in the management of network performance, the HP 4972A
    provides statistical information on network,  node  and  connection
    levels.    It  counts  and measures errors and other parameters for
    each node.  Automatic  test  sequences  make  it  easy  to  set  up
    long-term  tests  and  repeat  the  tests  at regular intervals.  A
    background traffic generator measures performance  under  different
    loading  conditions  which  allows  you  to anticipate and plan for
    future growth.  An optional color  graphic  display  makes  network
    activity easy to understand.  Performance management software helps
    fine-tune the network.

       The HP 4972A is also equipped for  troubleshooting  when  sudden
    changes  or  unavoidable circumstances take your network down.  The
    softkey-guided programming language helps test for problem  network
    conditions  as  they  occur.   Network events can also be logged to
    disk and post-processed through the same  program  to  examine  for
    possible  problems.   A user-definable display format makes it easy
    to restrict data viewed to the critical  information  you  need  to
    solve  a  problem.   Protocol interpreters display data captured by
    the HP  4972A  in  a  decoded  mnemonic  format.    Software  tools
    available  for  the  HP  4972A  allow  the user to see an "English"
    decode of many protocols.  Network performance analysis  tools  are
    also  available  for  these  protocols.    They  allow  the user to
    characterize operational performance of the network by testing  and
    making measurements on efficiency and utilization of higher network
    protocol layers.

4.7.2. Netlabs Dual Manager

PRODUCT-OR-PACKAGE-NAME:   Netlabs Dual Manager

DESCRIPTION:

       Netlabs'  Dual  Manager  provides  management of TCP/IP networks
    using  both  SNMP  and  CMOT  protocols.  Such  management  can  be
    initiated  either  through the X-windows user interface (both Motif
    and Openlook), or through OSI Network Management  (CMIP)  commands.
    The  Dual  Manager  provides for configuration, fault, security and
    performance  management.  It  provides  extensive  map   management
    features,  including  scanned  maps in the background.  It provides
    simple mechanisms to extend the MIB and assign  specific  lists  of
    objects  to  specific  network  elements, thereby providing for the
    management of all vendors' specific MIB extensions.  It provides an
    optional  relational  DBMS for storing and retrieving MIB and alarm
    information.  Finally, the Dual Manager is  an  open  platform,  in
    that  it provides several Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
    for users to extend the functionality of the Dual Manager.

       The Dual Manager  is  expected  to  work  as  a  TCP/IP  "branch
    manager"  under  DEC's  EMA,  AT&T's  UNMA and other OSI-conformant
    enterprise management architectures.
