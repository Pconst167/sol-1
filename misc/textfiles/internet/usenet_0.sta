Notes: 
	The "average disk space used by news" assumes that the host operating
	system allocates disk space in a fixed "chunk size" of about 1000
	bytes. The size of each stored message is rounded up to the next
	multiple of that chunk size. 

	The "average age of articles" is an average counting each article
	equally. The "average age of disk space" is weighted by size.

	The "expiration time" for a site is not necessarily constant. Some
	newsgroups that are considered more valuable are given longer 
	expiration times, while obvious junk is given a shorter expiration
	time. To come up with a single expiration time for a site, we find
	the average age of stored articles and then double it, rounding to
	the nearest integer. If you expire all articles older than 14 days,
	and if the arrival rate is constant, then the average age of 
	articles at your site will be 7 days.
