                             Fourth Edition

                       Initial Release, 08-26-1990


   This list of Usenet Files was compiled in order that you can get the
best out of Usenet while at the same time following the basic Network
Rules.  Many a times there have been complaints from the Usenet Community
about the new users not following the proper Nettiquette or are unaware of
the documentation available on the subject.  This is an attempt to
demystify Usenet.  More installments and updates will follow.

   In the previous releases, I tried to keep the contents of this ZIP simple
but believe that it wouldn't hurt to add some documents of a more technical
nature.  RFC822 and RFC1153 attempt to show some more technical aspects of
Usenet.

   I also upload the latest Canadian and World UUCP maps to CRS.  Look for
UCAN0791.ZIP and UMAP9107.ZIP.  These are July 91 Canadian and World Usenet
maps.

   You can find me on Canada Remote Systems in Toronto, in Usenet
Conference 8, where I am one of the Conference Coordinators.  If you have
any further questions contact me at one of the following email addresses:
