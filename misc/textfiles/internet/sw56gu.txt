	SWITCHED 56: WHAT IS IT? 
	**************************** 
	 
	*** Switched 56 represents a fast, yet cost-efficient method 
	of  transferring data.  The service taps the public network, 
	taking   advantage  of  the  recent  investments   telephone 
	companies    have   made   in   digital   and    fiber-optic 
	communications. 
	 
	*** The "56" of Switched 56 stands for the fast data rate of 
	56  kilobits per second.  "Switched" refers to your  ability 
	to  dial  and receive switched data calls just as you  would 
	with  a  voice  telephone line.  Switched 56  combines  high 
	speed with the widespread availability and low usage cost of 
	voice.   Once  Switched  56 is installed,  you  simply  dial 
	another user's Switched 56 number to transmit full duplex 56 
	Kbps digital data. 
	 
	*** Switched 56 is a fast, inexpensive way to transport data 
	digitally.   Cost  effectiveness.  High  speed.   Widespread 
	availability.   Flexibility.  Extensive  Applications.   For 
	all  these reasons, data communications managers,  PC  power 
	users, LAN managers, broadcasters and videoconference  users 
	are  making  Switched 56 the most popular  of  the  Switched 
	Digital Services. 
	 
	***   Integrated  Network  Corporation  (INC)   manufactures 
	Channel Service Unit/Data Service Units (CSU/DSUs).  What  a 
	modem  is to analog data communications, the CSU/DSU  is  to 
	digital  communications.  The company created  many  of  the 
	standards  that define Switched 56 including  call  progress 
	monitoring, echo canceller disabler and extended loop range. 
	INC  holds  two dozen national and international patents  on 
	Switched  56  technology.   The company makes  much  of  the 
	central   office  equipment  that  makes  Switched   Digital 
	Services  possible.  INC has written translation guides  for 
	all the telephone company digital switches.

	**************************** 
	 
	*** This Guide, prepared by the people at Integrated Network 
	Corporation   (INC),   is   the   most   up-to-date,    most 
	comprehensive listing of Switched 56 Digital  Services.   We 
	give  you  an  exhaustive  listing  of  installation  costs, 
	monthly charges and usage fees.. We also give you the names, 
	telephone  numbers and fax numbers of the telephone  company 
	product managers to contact. 
	 
	*** SERVICE 
	The  name each telephone company gives to their Switched  56 
	service.   Each company uses a different name, and it  helps 
	to use their name when making service inquiries. 
	 
	*** TECHNOLOGY 
	Defines the specific circuits provided, and specifies 2-wire 
	or 4-wire connection. 
	 
	*** PRODUCT MANAGER 
	Your  first contact at the telephone company should be  your 
	sales  representative.   However, if  you  need  answers  to 
	specific, highly technical questions about installation  and 
	availability, you can contact the Product Manager.  This  is 
	the telephone company's person in charge of the service. 
	 
	*** AVAILABILITY 
	Specifies  the  geographic  areas  where  Switched   56   is 
	provided.   Service is being brought to more  and  more  new 
	areas   Check  with your phone company's representative  for 
	the most up-to-date information.

	**************************** 
	 
	*** RATES 
	Like  a voice telephone line, Switched 56 typically involves 
	a  one-time installation cost, a monthly fee, and usage fees 
	from Local Exchange and Inter-Exchange carriers. 
	 
	* For local or intra-LATA calls, you will be charged a usage 
	fee by your Local Exchange Company.  A LATA typically covers 
	a much wider geographical area than the city for which it is 
	named.   The  Local Exchange rates in this  guide  apply  to 
	local calls ONLY. 
	 
	*  For long distance switched calls, you will be charged two 
	fees.   Typically both charges are included in  the  monthly 
	bill   from  your  local  telephone  company.    Your  Local 
	Exchange  Company  will charge you for access  to  the  Long 
	Distance  Company.  This typically runs  about  $  0.05  per 
	minute.   The Long Distance Company in turn will charge  you 
	for  transport  between  long  distance  switching  centers. 
	These  rates  are quoted in the Long Distance Company  pages 
	and DO NOT include the cost of local access. 
	 
	*  Access  to  Long  Distance Companies is provided  through 
	either   dedicated  digital  or  switched  digital  services 
	provided  by  the  Local  Company.   Most  users  will  find 
	switched  digital service provided by their  Local  Exchange 
	Company to be the most cost effective access method. 
	 
	*  Very  high volume users may find that it makes  sense  to 
	bypass the Local Exchange Company by using dedicated, rather 
	than switched access facilities. 
	 
	*  The cross-over point between switched and  dedicated line 
	can be calculated as follows. Find out the monthly cost of a 
	dedicated line.  Remember that $0.05 of every long  distance 
	call  using  switched  access goes  to  the  Local  Exchange 
	Company.  Divide the dedicated line cost by $0.05 to get the 
	break-even  point  in  minutes.  For example,  if  dedicated 
	access costs $500 per month, then the break-even point comes 
	at 10,000 minutes per month (almost 167 hours).

	**************************** 
	 
	* The information in this guide is based upon tariff filings 
	by  the Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) and the Long Distance 
	Carriers also referred to as Inter-Exchange Carriers (IXCs). 
	Tariff filings are often amended.  Rates for some areas  are 
	averages and may vary from state to state. 
	 
	* We recommend you contact your Local Exchange and/or Inter- 
	Exchange  Carriers to discuss current rates for Switched  56 
	Kbps  data  calls  that  apply to your  specific  situation. 
	Also,  review any discount or special program for which  you 
	may be eligible.
