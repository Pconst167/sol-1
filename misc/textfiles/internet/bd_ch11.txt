Chapter 11: IRC, MUDs AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MORE FUN THAN THEY SOUND
 
 
 
 
     Many Net systems provide access to a series of interactive 
services that let you hold live "chats" or play online games with 
people around the world.  To find out if your host system offers 
these, you can ask your system administrator or just try them -- if 
nothing happens, then your system does not provide them.  In general, 
if you can use telnet and ftp, chances are good you can use these 
services as well.
 
 
11.1  TALK
 
 
     This is the Net equivalent of a telephone conversation and 
requires that both you and the person you want to talk to have access 
to this function and are online at the same time.  To use it, type 
 
                talk user@site.name
 
where that is the e-mail address of the other person.  She will see 
something like this on her screen:
 
                talk: connection requested by yourname@site.name
                talk: respond with:  talk yourname@site.name
                                                                               
To start the conversation, she should then type (at her host system's 
command line):
   
                talk yourname@site.name
 
where that is your e-mail address.  Both of you will then get a top 
and bottom window on your screen.  She will see everything you type in 
one window; you'll see everything she types in the other.  To 
disconnect, hit control-C.
     One note: Public-access sites that use Sun computers sometimes have 
trouble with the talk program.  If talk does not work, try typing
 
     otalk
 
or
 
     ntalk
 
instead.  However, the party at the other end will have to have the same 
program online for the connection to work.
 
 
11.2  INTERNET RELAY CHAT
 
 
     IRC is a program that lets you hold live keyboard conversations 
with people around the world.  It's a lot like an international CB 
radio  - it even uses "channels."  Type something on your computer and 
it's instantly echoed around the world to whoever happens to be on the 
same channel with you.  You can join in existing public group chats or 
set up your own.  You can even create a private channel for yourself 
and as few as one or two other people.  And just like on a CB radio, 
you can give yourself a unique "handle" or nickname.
     IRC currently links host systems in 20 different countries, from 
Australia to Hong Kong to Israel.  
     Unfortunately, it's like telnet -- either your site has it or it 
doesn't.  If your host system does have it,  Just type
     
               irc
 
and hit enter.  You'll get something like this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
     You are now in channel 0, the "null" channel, in which you can look 
up various help files, but not much else. As you can see, IRC takes over 
your entire screen.  The top of the screen is where messages will 
appear.  The last line is where you type IRC commands and messages.  All 
IRC commands begin with a /.  The slash tells the computer you are about 
to enter a command, rather than a message. To see what channels are 
available, type 
 
                /list
 
and hit enter.  You'll get something like this:
 
 
*** Channel    Users  Topic

*** #screwed   3                                                               
*** #z         2

*** #ucd       1

*** #Snuffland 1                                                               
*** #p/g!      4                                                               
*** #DragonSrv 1                                                               
 
     Because IRC allows for a large number of channels, the list might 
scroll off your screen, so you might want to turn on your computer's 
screen capture to capture the entire list.  Note that the channels 
always have names, instead of numbers.  Each line in the listing tells 
you the channel name, the number of people currently in it, and whether 
there's a specific topic for it.  To switch to a particular channel, 
type 
 
                /join #channel
 
where "#channel" is the channel name and hit enter.  Some "public" 
channels actually require an invitation from somebody already on it.  To 
request an invitation, type
 
                /who #channel-name
 
where channel-name is the name of the channel, and hit enter.  Then ask 
someone with an @ next to their name if you can join in.  Note that 
whenever you enter a channel, you have to include the #.  Choose one 
with a number of users, so you can see IRC in action. 
     If it's a busy channel, as soon as you join it, the top of your 
screen will quickly be filled with messages.  Each will start with a 
person's IRC nickname, followed by his message.
     It may seem awfully confusing at first.  There could be two or 
three conversations going on at the same time and sometimes the 
messages will come in so fast you'll wonder how you can read them all.  
     Eventually, though, you'll get into the rhythm of the channel and 
things will begin to make more sense.  You might even want to add your 
two cents (in fact, don't be surprised if a message to you shows up on 
your screen right away; on some channels, newcomers are welcomed 
immediately).  To enter a public message, simply type it on that bottom 
line (the computer knows it's a message because you haven't started the 
line with a slash) and hit enter.                             
     Public messages have a user's nickname in brackets, like this:
 
                <tomg>
 
     If you receive a private message from somebody, his name will be 
between asterisks, like this:
 
                *tomg*
 
 
11.3  IRC COMMANDS
 
 
Note: Hit enter after each command.
 
 
/away         When you're called away to put out a grease fire 
              in the kitchen, issue this command to let others know 
              you're still connected but just away from your terminal 
              or computer for awhile. 
 
 
/help         Brings up a list of commands for which there is a help 
              file. You will get a "topic:" prompt.  Type in the 
              subject for which you want information and hit enter.  
              Hit enter by itself to exit help. 
 
/invite       Asks another IRC to join you in a conversation.
 
                        /invite fleepo #hottub
 
              would send a message to fleepo asking him to join you on 
              the #hottub channel.  The channel name is optional.
 
 
 
/join         Use this to switch to or create a particular channel, 
              like this: 
 
                        /join #hottub        
 
              If one of these channels exists and is not a private 
              one, you will enter it.  Otherwise, you have just 
              created it. Note you have to use a # as the first 
              character.
 
 
/list         This will give you a list of all available public 
              channels, their topics (if any) and the number of users 
              currently on them.  Hidden and private channels are not 
              shown. 
 
/m name       Send a private message to that user.
 
/mode         This lets you determine who can join a channel you've 
              created.  
 
                        /mode #channel +s
 
              creates a secret channel.
 
 
                        /mode #channel +p
 
              makes the channel private
 
/nick         This lets you change the name by which others see you.
 
                        /nick fleepo
 
              would change your name for the present session to 
              fleepo. People can still use /whois to find your e-mail
              address.  If you try to enter a channel where somebody 
              else is already using that nickname, IRC will ask you to 
              select another name.
 
/query        This sets up a private conversation between you and 
              another IRC user.  To do this, type
 
                        /query nickname
 
              Every message you type after that will go only to that 
              person.  If she then types
 
                        /query nickname
 
              where nickname is yours, then you have established a 
              private conversation.  To exit this mode, type
 
                        /query
 
              by itself.  While in query mode, you and the other 
              person can continue to "listen" to the discussion on 
              whatever public channels you were on, although neither 
              of you will be able to respond to any of the messages 
              there. 
 
/quit         Exit IRC.
 
/signoff      Exit IRC.
 
/summon       Asks somebody connected to a host system with IRC to 
              join you on IRC. You must use the person's entire e-mail
              address.
 
                        /summon fleepo@foo.bar.com
 
              would send a message to fleepo asking him to start IRC.  
              Usually not a good idea to just summon people unless you 
              know they're already amenable to the idea; otherwise you 
              may wind up annoying them no end. This command does not
              work on all sites.
 
/topic        When you've started a new channel, use this command to let
              others know what it's about.
 
                        /topic #Amiga
 
               would tell people who use /list that your channel is meant
               for discussing Amiga computers.
 
/who <chan>   Shows you the e-mail address of people on a particular 
              channel.
 
                        /who #foo
 
              would show you the addresses of everybody on channel foo.
 
                       /who
 
              by itself shows you every e-mail address for every person 
              on IRC at the time, although be careful: on a busy night
              you might get a list of 500 names!
 
/whois        Use this to get some information about a specific IRC 
              user or to see who is online.  
 
                        /whois nickname
 
              will give you the e-mail address for the person using 
              that nickname.  
 
                        /whois *
 
              will list everybody on every channel.
 
/whowas       Similar to /whois; gives information for people who 
              recently signed off IRC.
 
 
11.4  IRC IN TIME OF CRISIS


     IRC has become a new medium for staying on top of really big 
breaking news.  In 1993, when Russian lawmakers barricaded themselves 
inside the parliament building, some enterprising Muscovites and a couple 
of Americans set up a "news channel" on IRC to relay first-person 
accounts direct from Moscow. The channel was set up to provide a 
continuous loop of information, much like all-news radio stations that 
cycle through the day's news every 20 minutes.  In 1994, Los Angeles 
residents set up a similar channel to relay information related to the 
Northridge earthquake.  In both cases, logs of the channels were archived 
somewhere on the Net, for those unable to "tune in" live.
     How would you find such channels in the future?  Use the /list 
command to scroll through the available channels.  If one has been set up 
to discuss a particular breaking event, chances are you'll see a brief 
description next to the channel name that will tell you that's the place 
to tune.


11.5  MUDs
 
 
     Multiple-User Dimensions or Dungeons (MUDs) take IRC into the 
realm of fantasy.  MUDs are live, role-playing games in which you 
enter assume a new identity and enter an alternate reality through 
your keyboard.  As you explore this other world, through a series of 
simple commands (such as "look," "go" and "take"), you'll run across 
other users, who may engage you in a friendly discussion, enlist your 
aid in some quest or try to kill you for no apparent reason. 
     Each MUD has its own personality and creator (or God) who was 
willing to put in the long hours required to establish the particular 
MUD's rules, laws of nature and information databases.  Some MUDs 
stress the social aspects of online communications -- users frequently 
gather online to chat and join together to build new structures or 
even entire realms.  Others are closer to "Dungeons and Dragons" and 
are filled with sorcerers, dragons and evil people out to keep you 
from completing your quest -- through murder if necessary. 
     Many MUDs (there are also related games known as MUCKs and MUSEs) 
require you to apply in advance, through e-mail, for a character name 
and password.  One that lets you look around first, though, is 
HoloMuck at McGill University in Montreal.  The premise of this game 
is that you arrive in the middle of Tanstaafl, a city on the planet 
Holo.  You have to find a place to live (else you get thrown into the 
homeless shelter) and then you can begin exploring.  Magic is allowed 
on this world, but only outside the city limits.  Get bored with the 
city and you can roam the rest of the world or even take a trip into 
orbit (of course, all this takes money; you can either wait for your 
weekly salary or take a trip to the city casino).  Once you become 
familiar with the city and get your own character, you can even begin 
erecting your own building (or subway line, or almost anything else). 
     To connect, telnet to 
 
                collatz.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5757
 
     When you connect, type
 
                connect guest guest
 
     and hit enter.  This connects you to the "guest" account, which 
has a password of "guest."        
You'll see this:
 
The Homeless Shelter(#22Rna)                                                   
You wake up in the town's Homeless Shelter, where vagrants are put for         
protective holding.  Please don't sleep in public places-- there are plenty of 
open apartments available.  Type 'apartments' to see how to get to an          
apartment building with open vacancies.                                        
There is a small sign on the wall here, with helpful information.  Type 'look  
sign' to read it.                                                              
The door is standing open for your return to respectable society.  Simply walk 
'out' to the center.                                                           
     Of course, you want to join respectable society, but first you 
want to see what that sign says.  So you type 
 
                look sign
 
and hit enter, which brings up a list of some basic commands.  Then 
you type 
 
                out
 
followed by enter, which brings up this:
 
You slip out the door, and head southeast...                                   
Tanstaafl Center                                                               
This is the center of the beautiful town of Tanstaafl.  High Street runs north 
and south into residential areas, while Main Street runs east and west into    
business districts.                                                            
SW: is Tanstaafl Towers.  Please claim an apartment... no sleeping in public!  
SE: the Public Library offers both information and entertainment.              
NW: is the Homeless Shelter, formerly the Town Jail.                           
NE: is Town Hall, site of several important services, including: Public        
Message Board, Bureau of Land Management (with maps and regulations), and      
other governmental/ bureaucratic help.                                         
Down: Below a sign marked with both red and blue large letter 'U's, a          
staircase leads into an underground subway passage.                            
(Feel free to 'look' in any direction for more information.)                   
[Obvious exits: launch, d, nw, se, w, e, n, s, ne, sw]                         
Contents:

Founders' statue                                                               
 
     To see "Instructions for newcomers", type
 
                look Instructions for newcomers
 
and hit enter.  You could do the same for "Directional signpost" and 
"Founders' statue."  Then type
 
                SW
 
and enter to get to Tanstaafl Towers, the city housing complex, where 
you have to claim an apartment (you may have to look around; many will 
already) be occupied.  And now it's off to explore Holo!  One command 
you'll want to keep in mind is "take." Periodically, you'll come 
across items that, when you take them will confer certain abilities or 
powers on you.  If you type
 
                help
 
and enter, you'll get a list of files you can read to learn more about 
the MUD's commands.
     The "say" command lets you talk to other players publicly. For 
example, 
 
                say Hey, I'm here!
 
would be broadcast to everybody else in the room with you.  If you 
want to talk to just one particular person, use "whisper" instead of 
"say."

        whisper agora=Hey, I'm here!                                           
 
would be heard only by agora.  Another way to communicate with 
somebody regardless of where on the world they are is through your 
pager.  If you suddenly see yours go off while visiting, chances are 
it's a wizard checking to see if you need any help.  To read his 
message, type
 
                page
 
To send him a message, type
 
                page name=message
 
where name is the wizard's name (it'll be in the original message).
      Other MUDs and MUCKs may have different commands, but generally 
use the same basic idea of letting you navigate through relatively 
simple English commands.   
     When you connect to a MUD, choose your password as carefully as 
you would one for your host system; alas, there are MUD crackers who 
enjoy trying to break into other people's MUD accounts.  And never, 
never use the same password as the one you use on your host system!
     MUDs can prove highly addicting.  "The jury is still out on 
whether MUDding is 'just a game'  or 'an extension of real life with 
gamelike qualities'," says Jennifer Smith, an active MUD player who 
wrote an FAQ on the subject. 
     She adds one caution: "You shouldn't do anything that you 
wouldn't do in real life, even if the world is a fantasy world.  The 
important thing to remember is that it's the fantasy world of possibly 
hundreds of people, and not just yours in  particular.  There's a 
human being on the other side of each and every wire!  Always remember 
that you may meet these other people some day,  and they may break 
your nose.  People who treat others badly gradually build up bad 
reputations and eventually receive the NO FUN Stamp of Disapproval." 
 
 

11.6  GO, GO, GO (AND CHESS, TOO)!

     Fancy a good game of go or chess?  You no longer have to head for 
the nearest park with a board in hand.  The Internet has a couple of 
machines that let you engage people from around the world in your 
favorite board games.  Or, if you prefer, you can watch matches in 
progress.
     To play go, 

        telnet hellspark.wharton.upenn.edu 6969
        log on as: guest

You'll find prompts to various online help files to get you started. 
     For a chess match, 
                        
        telnet news.panix.com 5000
        log on as: guest

You'll find prompts for online help files on the system, which lets you 
choose your skill level.


11.7  THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN
 

     All is not fun and games on the Net.  Like any community, the Net 
has its share of obnoxious characters who seem to exist only to make 
your life miserable (you've already met some of them in the chapter on 
Usenet).  There are people who seem to spend a bit more time on 
the Net than many would find healthy.  It also has its criminals.  
Clifford Stoll writes in "The Cuckoo's Egg" how he tracked a team of 
German hackers who were breaking into U.S. computers and selling the 
information they found to the Soviets.  Robert Morris, a Cornell 
University student, was convicted of unleashing a "worm" program that 
effectively disabled several thousand computers connected to the 
Internet.  
     Of more immediate concern to the average Net user are crackers 
who seek to find other's passwords to break into Net systems and people 
who infect programs on ftp sites with viruses.
    There is a widely available program known as "Crack" that can 
decipher user passwords composed of words that might be found in a 
dictionary (this is why you shouldn't use such passwords).  Short of 
that, there are the annoying types who, as mentioned above, take a 
special thrill in trying to make you miserable.  The best advice in 
dealing with them is to count to 10 and then ignore them -- like 
juveniles everywhere, most of their fun comes in seeing how upset you 
can get. 
    Meanwhile, two Cornell University students pled guilty in 1992 to 
uploading virus-infected Macintosh programs to ftp sites.  If you plan 
to try out large amounts of software from ftp sites, it might be wise to 
download or buy a good anti-viral program.
    But can law enforcement go too far in seeking out the criminals?  
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded in large part in 
response to a series of government raids against an alleged gang of 
hackers.  The raids resulted in the near bankruptcy of one game
company never alleged to have had anything to do with the hackers, 
when the government seized its computers and refused to give them 
back.  The case against another alleged participant collapsed in court 
when his attorney showed the "proprietary" and supposedly hacked 
information he printed in an electronic newsletter was actually 
available via an 800 number for about $13 -- from the phone company 
from which that data was taken.


11.8  FYI
 
     You can find discussions about IRC in the alt.irc newsgroup. 
     "A Discussion on Computer Network Conferencing," by Darren Reed 
(May, 1992), provides a theoretical background on why conferencing 
systems such as IRC are a Good Thing.  It's available through ftp at 
nic.ddn.mil in the rfc directory as rfc1324.txt.
     Every Friday, Scott Goehring posts a new list of  MUDs and related 
games and their telnet addresses in the newsgroup rec.games.mud.announce. 
There are several other mud newsgroups related to specific types of MUDs, 
including rec.games.mud.social, rec.games.mud.adventure, 
rec.games.mud.tiny, rec.games.mud.diku and rec.games.mud.lp. 
     For a good overview of the impact on the Internet of the Morris 
Worm, read "Virus Highlights Need for Improved Internet Management," by 
the U.S. General Accounting Office (June, 1989).  You can get a copy via 
ftp from cert.sei.cmu.edu in the pub/virus-l/docs directory.  It's 
listed as gao_rpt. 
     Clifford Stoll describes how the Internet works and how he tracked 
a group of KGB-paid German hackers through it, in "The Cuckoo's Egg: 
Tracking a Spy through the Maze of Computer Espionage," Doubleday 
(1989).
