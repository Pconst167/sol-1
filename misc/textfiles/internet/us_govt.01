           Internet Sources of Government Information

                           2nd Edition
                        February 26, 1994

                       By Blake Gumprecht
             Documents Librarian, Temple University

Internet users can now access hundreds of sources of current
government information from around the world -- Census data,
Supreme Court decisions, world health statistics, company
financial reports, weather forecasts, United Nations information,
daily White House press briefings and much more. The Internet has
become a rich resource for government information, in part
because works produced by many government agencies are not
eligible for copyright protection.

So, while government agencies have been criticized for not making
more information available online, enterprising individuals and
organizations have themselves made a wealth of sources available
via the network. A growing number of government agencies too are
beginning to establish systems that can be accessed remotely. You
can now e-mail the President, and enactment by Congress last year
of the Government Printing Office Electronic Information Access
Improvement Act assures the U.S. government's role in
distributing information electronically will increase. A variety
of other proposals suggest that in the future, more and more
information produced by state, local and international
governmental organizations will also be available online,
sometimes exclusively.

In many cases, there are significant advantages to the sources
accessible online over what can be found in the library or via
other means. Internet resources are often more up-to-date than
their paper counterparts. Frequently they can be searched by
keyword. Sometimes they provide information simply not available
in more traditional formats. A word of warning is necessary,
though. Internet resources are constantly changing. What is
available one minute may not be available the next. System
addresses, source directories and file names are often changed
without notice. Sometimes a remote system may be temporarily
unavailable.

This is the second edition of a guide to Internet sources of
government information originally created for the students,
faculty and staff of Temple University. The second edition
includes more than 325 sources, two-thirds of which were not
listed in the first edition. The sources listed are intended to
provide the simplest and clearest route known to the information
described. The preferred source is often a Gopher source because
of the ease of using the Gopher software. Often, however, there
are several sources for the same information. Some may allow more
sophisticated file manipulation. Frequently files can be
downloaded to your personal computer using a feature known as
file transfer protocol (FTP).

When the source listed is a Gopher source, the instructions
assume users can escape the local Gopher menu structure to
connect directly to a remote Gopher. This can normally be done by
issuing the Gopher command in combination with a remote system
address from your system's ready prompt. Contact your local
systems administrator if this doesn't work. Many files accessible
via Gopher are also available using a Telnet command, but don't
assume a Gopher source can be accessed via Telnet. Telnet sources
usually require an account or password and are sometimes not
intended for outside use.

The second edition of this guide includes a few changes from the
first. Because the new edition features many more sources than
the first, sources in this edition are arranged by subject rather
than alphabetically. Each source is listed in only one subject
category. Sources that include information about a wide variety
of subjects are usually included in one of three general
categories that begin the list. Additional access points have
also been added for many sources. Often in the first edition only
a single access point was provided, typically a Gopher source. I
now realize some Internet users do not have direct Gopher access,
so I have supplied Telnet addresses when known. Instructions for
retrieving files via FTP are generally not provided unless the
information is otherwise unavailable. System addresses, source
directories and file names for all sources have been verified at
least twice. I have added in parenthesis the date I last accessed
the source using the information provided.

The "path" listed is the "address" of the remote computer system
where the information described can be found, along with the
steps a user must take to locate the particular directory or file
that contains the information. Slashes in the path separate
commands, steps, or levels in a menu or file hierarchy.
The first part of any path is a command statement that must be
executed to access the remote source of the information. Type the
first part of the path, up to any slashes, and press the Enter
key. If there are no slashes, type the entire phrase.

I would like to thank Terese Austin, Maggie Parhamovich, Joe Ryan
and Kim Tsang, whose guides helped me improve the quality of my
own. I am indebted as well to the ever-helpful participants of
the GOVDOC-L electronic discussion group, without whom this guide
would not be possible. I'd also like to thank Calvin Boyer, whose
U.S. Government Gophers gateway proved useful, and contributors
to Gleason Sackman's Net-Happenings list, an important source of
information about new network resources. Thanks to Larry
Detweiler, Louis Rosenfeld, Mike Showalter and others too
numerous to name who have helped make my guide more widely
available. And thanks to all who have had kind words.

Current and future editions of this guide can be retrieved via
Gopher, anonymous FTP and e-mail. The guide can be obtained via
Gopher or FTP from the University of Michigan's Clearinghouse of

In an effort to bring valuable information to the masses, and
as a service to motivated information compilers, I
(L. Detweiler) will help others unfamiliar with Usenet
`publish' their documents for widespread dissemination via the
FAQ structure, and act as a `sponsor' knowledgable in the
submissions process. This document is being distributed under
this arrangement.

I have found these compilations tend to appear on various
mailing lists and are valuable enough to deserve wider
distribution. If you know of an existing compilation of
Internet information that is not currently a FAQ, please
contact me and I may `sponsor' it. The benefits to the author
include:

- use of the existing FAQ infrastructure for distribution:
  - automated mail server service
  - FTP archival
  - automated posting
