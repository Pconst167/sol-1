CA-90:10                       CERT Advisory
			      November 16, 1990
			   Rumor of Alleged Attack
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

There have been several recent reports in the media and other places
about an alleged attack on some telephone systems, apparently in
response to the sentencing today in Atlanta of three members of a
computer intruder group called "Legion of Doom".  As of this time
(Nov. 16 at 4:30 PM EST), CERT/CC has not received any evidence to
substantiate this rumor.

Caution (not panic) is advisable.
