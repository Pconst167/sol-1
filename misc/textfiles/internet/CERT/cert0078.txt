Original issue date: March 21, 1994

Topic:  Writable /etc/utmp Vulnerability
=============================================================================

The CERT Coordination Center has received information concerning a
vulnerability that exists on systems where the file /etc/utmp is writable
by any user on the system.

This vulnerability is being actively exploited; please review CERT Advisory
CA-94:01 "Ongoing Network Monitoring Attacks."

The problem is known to affect Sun Microsystems, Inc. SunOS 4.1.X and
Solaris 1.1.1 operating systems. Solbourne Computer, Inc. and other Sparc
products using SunOS 4.1.X or Solaris 1.1.1 are also affected. Solaris 2.x
and SunOS 4.1.3_U1 (Solaris 1.1.1) are not affected by this problem.

Patches can be obtained from Sun Answer Centers worldwide.  They are also
available via anonymous FTP from ftp.uu.net in the /systems/sun/sun-dist 
directory, and in Europe from ftp.eu.net in the /sun/fixes directory.

We queried several vendors in addition to Sun.  The following vendors
reported that their operating systems, as distributed by the vendor, are
not affected by this problem:

Convex Computer Corporation             Digital Equipment Corporation
Data General Corporation                Hewlett-Packard Company
IBM                                     Intergraph
Motorola, Inc.                          NeXT, Inc.
Pyramid Technology Corporation          Sequent Computer Systems
Sony Corporation

Currently, we are not aware of /etc/utmp being writable on other systems.
If your operating system is not explicitly mentioned above, and if you 
determine that /etc/utmp is writable by someone other than root, we 
encourage you to contact your vendor.

If /etc/utmp on your system is writable only by the root account, you need
not be concerned about the vulnerability. 

We recommend that sites check their /etc/utmp file to be sure it is not
writable by users other than root.  If it is generally writable, you should
obtain patches from the system vendor or protect /etc/utmp as described below.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     If the file /etc/utmp is writable by users other than root,
     programs that trust the information stored in that file can
     be subverted.

II.  Impact

     This vulnerability allows anyone with access to a user account
     to gain root access.

III. Solution

     The solutions to this vulnerability are to either (a) protect the file,
     or (b) patch all the programs that trust it.

     Note that SunOS 4.1.3_U1 (Solaris 1.1.1) is _not_ vulnerable to this
     problem. 

     A.  To protect the file, make /etc/utmp writable only by root:

                 # chown root /etc/utmp
                 # chmod 644 /etc/utmp

     C. Clarifications added April 1, 1994

        1) If you make /etc/utmp writable only by root, this should only affect
           programs that allocate pseudo terminal interfaces and want to add
           an appropriate entry to the /etc/utmp file.  Such programs include
           script(1), cmdtool(1), gfxtool(1), shelltool(1), and tektool(1).
           These programs will no longer be able to add an entry to /etc/utmp
           which means that programs such as who(1), syslogd(1), and others
           that use /etc/utmp will not know that an account is using that
           pseudo tty. 

        2) No program should be made setuid root just to workaround this
           problem. Setuid programs must be written very carefully to avoid
           creating yet more vulnerabilities.

        3) The installation instructions on the syslogd patch do not point out
           that, until you stop and restart syslogd (or reboot the system),
           the old version is still running and the security hole has not been
           closed.
