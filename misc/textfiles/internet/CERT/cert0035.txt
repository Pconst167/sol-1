CA-91:21                     CERT Advisory
                            December 6, 1991
		  SunOS NFS Jumbo and fsirand Patches

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC)
has received information concerning several vulnerabilities in Sun
Microsystems, Inc. (Sun) Network File System (NFS) and the fsirand
program. These vulnerabilities affect SunOS versions 4.1.1, 4.1, and
4.0.3 on all architectures.

Sun has provided separate patches for these vulnerabilities for SunOS
4.1.1, and has provided an initial patch for SunOS 4.1.  Sun will be
providing complete patches for 4.1 and 4.0.3 at a later date.  On
SunOS 4.1.1 systems, Sun states that patch 100173-07 must be installed
before patch 100424-1.  The patches are available through your local
Sun Answer Centers worldwide as well as through anonymous ftp from the
ftp.uu.net (192.48.96.2) system in the /sun-dist directory.

Please note that Sun will occasionally update patch files.  If you
find that the checksum is different please contact Sun or the CERT/CC
for verification.

Sun recommends that sites upgrade to SunOS 4.1.1 to benefit from the
security improvements.  In addition, they recommend the installation
of all security-related patches applicable to the version of SunOS
that you are running.

A general NFS security note: due to security flaws in the protocol,
the CERT/CC recommends filtering SunRPC and NFS IP packets (sockets
111 and 2049) between the local network and the Internet.  This will
prevent intruders outside your local network from accessing your
files.

NFS Jumbo Patch, SunOS 4.1.1

I.   Description

This patch fixes several SunOS NFS bugs (not all security-related).
The patch file, 100173-07.tar.Z, contains fixes for SunOS version
4.1.1.  The BugIDs fixed in this patch are:

1039977 1032959 1029628 1037476 1038302 1034328 1045536 1030884 1045993

See the README file provided with the patch for more information.
 
II.  Impact

These vulnerabilities (and bugs) have multiple impacts, including
crashing the system, allowing unauthorized system access, and causing
a problem with file group ownership.

III. Solution

Obtain the patch from Sun or from ftp.uu.net and install, following
the provided instructions, with the following exception:

line 112 of the README file currently reads:

    mv /sys/`arch -k`/OBJ/nfs_subr.o /sys/arch -k`/OBJ/nfs_subr.o.FCS
                                          ^^^^^^^^
it should read:

    mv /sys/`arch -k`/OBJ/nfs_subr.o /sys/`arch -k`/OBJ/nfs_subr.o.FCS
                                          ^^^^^^^^^
