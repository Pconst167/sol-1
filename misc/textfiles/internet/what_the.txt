		 THE DDN NETWORK INFORMATION CENTER (NIC)

The DDN Network Information Center (NIC) is located at Government Systems,
Inc., Chantilly, VA, and is funded by the Defense Information Systems Agency's
Defense Network System Organization (DISA DNSO) to provide general user
services to DDN users via telephone, electronic mail, and U.S. postal mail.

The NIC works closely with the network Host Administrators, Node Site
Coordinators, domain administrators, network coordinators, network
protocol groups, vendors, contractors, government agencies, and military
sponsors to assist new users and potential subscribers in obtaining
pertinent network information.

Databases and information servers of interest to network users are
provided, including the WHOIS registry of network users, the NIC/Query
browsing system, TACNEWS, and the official DoD Host Name Service.  The NIC
is the source for official DDN protocol documents (other than the
MIL-STDs), as well as other DDN documents, and maintains the RFC (Request
for Comments) collection.  Many of the online files are available through
the NIC's automatic mail service, SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL.

The NIC registers hosts and domains, assigns IP network numbers and
Autonomous System Numbers, and provides host name translation tables
and domain name system server files to the DDN/DARPA Internet.  The
NIC also registers network users and issues MILNET TAC access cards.

SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL is an automated service provided by the DDN
Network Information Center.  It allows access to NIC documents and
information via ordinary electronic mail.  This is especially useful
for users who do not have access to the NIC via a direct Internet
link, such as users of BITNET, CSNET and UUCP sites.

   To use the mail service, send a mail message to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL.
In the SUBJECT field, request the type of service you wish followed by
any needed arguments.  The message body is normally ignored.  Large files
will be broken into smaller separate messages.  The information you
request will be sent back to you as soon as possible.

The following services are currently available:

HELP            This message; a list of current services.

VIII. USER REGISTRATION

Host Administrators have overall responsibility for registering their
users.  When new users acquire accounts on MILNET hosts, their Host
Administrator must complete a NIC-generated template to register them in
the NIC database.  Names and addresses of Host Administrators are found on
the NIC.DDN.MIL host in the files NETINFO:MIL-HOST-ADMINISTRATORS-A-L.TXT,
NETINFO:MIL-HOST-ADMINISTRATORS-M-Z.TXT and
NETINFO:ARPA-HOST-ADMINISTRATORS.TXT.

End users who require MILNET TAC dial-up access to reach their hosts must
have TAC Access cards that are provided by the NIC.  Approval for
distributing the card is sent to the NIC from the user's Host
Administrator.  Until the user is permanently registered, there may be
temporary "Guest" TAC cards available from the Host Administrator for
immediate use.


IX. HOST, DOMAIN, NETWORK NUMBER, IN-ADDR, AND ASN REGISTRATION

The NIC is responsible for the registration of hosts, domains, IP
networks, and autonomous systems numbers (ASNs) used by various
organizations connected to the DDN Internet.

To include a new host in the DDN Internet Host Table, the template
found in NETINFO:IHOST-TEMPLATE.TXT needs to be completed and returned
to HOSTMASTER@NIC.DDN.MIL.  Hosts included in the Host Table are
limited to those hosts acting as domain or IN-ADDR servers, gateways,
and hosts integral for mail routing.

Twice weekly, information is generated and installed into the DDN
Internet Host Table as NETINFO:HOSTS.TXT, which is a listing of the
hosts, gateways, and networks attached to the Internet and registered
with the NIC.  From this file, two additional files are generated:
HOSTS.TXT-Z, a UNIX compressed version of the HOSTS.TXT file; and
MIL-HOSTS.TXT, a complete listing of the MILNET hosts in HOSTS.TXT.

Domains are registered via the domain template found in
NETINFO:DOMAIN-TEMPLATE.TXT.  New domain information is installed into
the seven DNS root servers on a twice-weekly basis.  Information
regarding the root servers is kept in NETINFO:ROOT-SERVERS.TXT.
Additionally, a listing of the domains registered with the NIC can be
found in NETINFO:DOMAIN-INFO.TXT.  A listing of the netaddresses of
the domain servers for individual top-level domains can be found in
NETINFO:DOMAINS.TXT.

Network number assignments are made when a network POC completes the
template in NETINFO:INTERNET-NUMBER-TEMPLATE.TXT and returns the
template to Hostmaster.  A complete listing of government sponsored
networks is found in NETINFO:NETWORKS.TXT.

To provide address to hostname reverse resolution, IN-ADDR domains are
registered within the domain root servers via an IN-ADDR template sent
to the HOSTMASTER mailbox.  This template can be found in
NETINFO:IN-ADDR-TEMPLATE.TXT.

The NIC assigns autonomous system numbers (ASNs) when the template
found in NETINFO:ASN-TEMPLATE.TXT is sent to HOSTMASTER@NIC.DDN.MIL.
A complete listing of assigned ASNs is found in NETINFO:ASN.TXT.

From the domain, network number, and ASN templates, POC information is
extracted and individuals that are not already registered are given
records in the WHOIS database.
