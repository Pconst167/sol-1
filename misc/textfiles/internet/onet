                            ONet Association
                          Acceptable Use Policy
                                  DRAFT                  October 23, 1990

Introduction

The ONet network exists to facilitate the exchange of information in support
of education, research, development, and technology transfer.  The network
and its connections to other networks are to be used only in manners that
are consistent with these purposes within the spirit of this acceptable use
policy.

Each member is responsible for taking appropriate action to communicate this
policy within its organization and to rectify the behaviour of its users who
disregard this policy.

Organizations within Ontario which wish to make use of the ONet network
should become members of the ONet Association.  A member which provides
connectivity between itself and other Ontario-based organizations that are
not members of the ONet Association, must guarantee that no traffic will be
generated onto or accepted over ONet resources to or from that non-member
organization.

Authentication

An ONet member must ensure that it can trace any use of the ONet network
from within its organization to the individual who initiated that use.
Identification of the individual might be achieved through a mechanism such
as unique userids or passwords, or through the ownership of the node in
question. Examples of non-authenticating nodes include nodes with public-use
userids or multiple-user userids.  Traffic originating from any and all such
non-authenticating nodes within the member's network must not be transmitted
from the member's network into or through the ONet network.

Acceptable Uses of the ONet Network

The intent of this acceptable use policy is to clarify by example the
guidelines that apply to determining whether a given use is acceptable or
not. These guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. The final authority
for determining whether or not a use is acceptable is the ONet Management
Committee.  Members are responsible for raising any questionable use with
the committee.  Until any use referred in this manner is determined to be
acceptable, it should be considered as unacceptable.

Uses that fall under one of the following descriptions are, in general,
acceptable:

1.  Uses consistent with the purposes of ONet;

2.  Uses related to instruction, research, development and technology
    transfer at not-for-profit organizations;

3.  Uses by for-profit organizations in support of development and
    technology transfer projects.

4.  Uses related to the administrative and other support of
    activities considered consistent with the purposes of ONet;

5.  Uses relating to billable services, such as the sale of machine time,
    provided that the use of the service in question is itself related to
    activities consistent with the purposes of the ONet network.

6.  Uses relating to the investigation and support of vendors' products,
    such as the distribution of information or technical support material
    on request or the discussion of products' relative advantages and
    disadvantages.

Uses that fall under one of the following descriptions are, in general,
not acceptable:

1.  Uses that interfere with the work of other users of the network or
    with their host systems, or that seriously disrupt the network, or that
    result in the loss of a user's work or system;

2.  Uses related to commercial activities such as the unsolicited
    distribution of advertising material;

3.  Uses that might be considered malicious or unethical;

4.  Uses that violate federal or provincial laws;

5.  Uses related to "chain letters" or broadcasting to lists of individuals
    in such a manner that might cause congestion of the network;

6.  Uses of the ONet network that result in traffic to any connected
    network which violates published acceptable use specifications for
    that network.  (For example, although there is no limit on the size
    of files that may be transferred within the ONet network, or within
    the CA*net or NetNorth national networks, there is a specification
    that prohibits files larger than 300K from being transferred from
    the NetNorth network into or through the BITNET network.)

6) Estimate the number of hosts that will be on the network:

      6a. Initially:          65
      6b. Within one year:   140
      6c. Within two years:  300
      6d. Within five years: 850


      7.  Reason:

We are applying for a Class B license as our requirements now exceed the limits
of a Class C license.  Our TCP-IP network has grown to include different
physical LAN types (Arcnet and Ethernet as well as point to point) and has
extended over a wide geographical area (Canada, U.S.A. and England).  As well,
having a large and growing population of high-speed Unix workstations mixed in
with PC's and general use Vaxes has led to network congestion in certain cases.
We forsee real problems arising within the next year if we are not able to
create subnets to handle this situation.  This, coupled with the fact that we
will exceed the ~255 host limit within 2 years leads us to request the Class B
license.


      8. Type of network: Research

      9.  Purpose: To carry out Research and Development for a multi-national
                   company in the field of Aluminum and related products.
