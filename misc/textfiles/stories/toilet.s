   The other day, I walked into the bathroom and saw my dog staring at
   the toilet.  Rilke's concentration was so intense that he didn't
   even acknowledge me as I entered the room.  When I looked at his
   face, it almost devoid of expression; and although there was a touch
   of curiosity and perhaps a hint of bafflement in his gaze, there
   were no other clues as to what he might be thinking.
   
   I have seen evidence of some analytical ability in my dog and enough
   familiarity with the English language that I probably give him
   credit for a much more complicated thought process than he is
   capable of.  Still, I have never seen him study anything so intently
   as he had the toilet, so I thought I would amuse myself by trying to
   figure out what he was thinking.
   
   After contemplating the various activities associated with the
   toilet and how they may interest my dog, it didn't take very long
   before I hit on the obvious answer.  Rilke is an animal who marks
   his territory by going to the bathroom in strategic boundary
   locations.  Surely he assumes that humans must operate in the same
   manner and has therefore has concluded that the only place I think
   worthy of staking a claim to is the toilet.  Of course he figures
   that everything I do in and around the toilet must have some special
   significance, none of which is immediately apparent to him.  I can
   just hear the thought ricocheting around in his head: "He can have
   the stupid porcelain bowl for all I care, as long as I get to keep
   the back yard."
