                           THE OBSTINATE GOATS

   Once upon a time . . . two mountain goats happened to be going down the 
opposite slopes of a valley, through which flowed a rushing river.
   Now, some of the mountain dwellers had bridged the river by placing a large
tree trunk that had been struck by lightning, to join the steep rocky banks.
   The two goats met head on half way across the tree trunk for each wanted to
cross to the other side. But the trunk was not nearly wide enough for them to 
pass each other, and neither goat was inclined to give way. Obstinately, they 
began to bicker, but neither would budge an inch. Words soon led to action and
they started to fight, till finally both tumbled off the tree trunk into the 
river below. Wouldn't it have been much simpler if only one of the goats had 
been courteous enough to allow the other to pass.
