Subject: Paul Harvey source of UL's?

The following was published in a local paper (and therefore is true) as
excerpted from 'Paul Harvey's For What It's Worth' (Bantom Books), and
since it's from a book it MUST be true!  These are purported to be Paul's
best wierd, but true, stories:

1. We visit Altoona, PA, where TV anchorman Brandon Brooks demonstrated
   for his viewers how to protect their homes from burglars.  He used his
   own home to demonstrate...  Double locks on doors, windows that will
   not open from the outside, burglar alarms...  Now it appears that
   thieves were watching the program.  They not only learned where the
   double locks were, but where the TV set was and the VCR and the
   furniture and other things.  So a few nights later - while Brandon 
   Brooks was on the air back at the studio - the thieves broke into his
   house and cleaned him out.  That window that won't open from the
   outside?  They smashed it.

2. Police Chief Clifton Sullivan - Russell Springs, KY - got a call from
   a lady who wanted her bachelor neighbor arrested for indecent exposure
   The chief went to her house and witnessed for himself...  The fact
   was that the man next door was in his bathroom shaving.  'But,' the
   chief said, 'with the bottom part of the man's bathroom window covered
   as it is, I cannot tell if the bottom part of the man is wearing
   anything or not.'  'But,' the woman said, 'Well, you just stand on
   this chair and stand on your tiptoes and you'll see!'

3. Ed Ruffing reports in the Utica, NY, Observer-Dispatch.  Burglars in
   suburban Marcy were carrying the TV set down the driveway when the
   next-door neighbor called out: 'Hey, are you going to fix her TV set?'
   And the burglars called back, 'Yes.'  And the neighbor asked, 'Mine
   needs fixing, could you take it, too?'  And the burglars said, 'Be
   glad to.'  And they did.

4. We visit Raleigh, NC, where a state cop stopped a drunken driver.  
   While he was ticketing the man, there was a multicar accident on the 
   other side of the divided highway.  The highway patrolman told the
   drunk to wait.  The patrolman went across the highway to sort out the
   accident.  After awhile the drunk figured he'd waited long enough and
   he drove on home and told his wife that if anybody asked she should
   say he had been in bed with the flu all day.  Within the hour, two
   state patrolmen appeared at the home of the drunken driver and asked
   to see him.  He came from the bedroom wrapped in a robe and coughing
   and wheezing.  The patrolman asked if he'd been drinking that evening,
   and he said he'd been sick in bed.  They apologized for bothering 
   him and asked if they could take a look at his car.  The drunk escorted
   them to the garage and inside was - a highway patrol car, the blue
   lights still flashing.
Gee, names and actual places and everything.  Nice to finally find the
origins for these.  I wasn't familiar with number 1, but I'd always
heard number 2 told as a joke, number 3 was in Reader's Digest 20 or
so years ago, and number 4 was in one of Brunvand's books.
