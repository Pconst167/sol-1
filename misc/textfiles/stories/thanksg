A brief thought on the occassion of an all-american holiday:

    "Thanks for the wild turkey, and the passenger pidgeons,
     destined to be shit out through wholesome American guts.

    "Thanks for a continent to despoil and poison.

    "Thanks for indians to provide a modicum of challenge 
     and danger.

    "Thanks for vast herds of bison to kill and skin, leaving
     the carcasses to rot.

    "Thanks for bounties on wolves and coyotes.

    "Thanks for the American Dream,
     To vulgarize and falsify until the bare lies shine through.

    "Thanks for the KKK.
     For nigger-killin' lawmen, feelin' their notches.
     For decent church-goin' women,
     with their mean, pinched, bitter, evil faces.

    "Thanks for 'Kill A Queer For Christ' stickers.

    "Thanks for laboratory AIDS.

    "Thanks for Prohibition,
     and the War Against Drugs.

    "Thanks for a country
     where nobody's allowed to mind their own business.

    "Thanks for a nation of finks.

    "Yes, Thanks for all the memories ---
     'ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE YOUR ARMS!'

    "You were ALWAYS a headache and you were ALWAYS a bore.

    

    "THANKS...
     For the last and greatest betrayal
     of the last and greatest of human dreams."



                                 ---"A THANKSGIVING PRAYER"
