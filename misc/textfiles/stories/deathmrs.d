==================================================================

From Pitman's 'Commonsense Arithmetic'

 1. In the beginning was the word.
 2. The word was and is flesh.
 3. The word was and is sound and image.
 4. Sound travels at the rate of 1114 feet per second.
 5. Image travels at the speed of light: 186,000 miles per second.
 6. Mr B, at point B', and Mrs D, at point D', are 1114 feet
    apart.
 7. Mrs D is equipped with a penetrating, long-range voice that
    carries from point D' to point B'.
 8. Mrs D screams: "...flesh flesh flesh flesh you stinking
    heel..." (She hopes her contempt does not show unpro-
    tected margin.
 9. Mr B is equipped with a telescopic-sighted camera and a tape
    recorder.
10. The camera and tape recorder are synchronized so that when
    Mr B sights the beginning word on the lips of Mrs D, he
    takes her picture and begins to record.
11. One second later, he hears and records her words.
12. When he hears her words, he has already taken her picture.
13. Mr B has taken a picture of Mrs D one second *before* she
    manifests herself to him in word.
14. Mr B has split Mrs D's word from her image.
15. Mrs D might well bellow out some further pleasantries.
16. Mr B, feeling he has heard enough already, provides himself
    with a rifle.
17. Mr B mounts the rifle and the telescopic-sighted camera on a
    tripod.
18. The rifle has a muzzle velocity of 2228 feet per second.
19. When Mr B sights the beginning word on the lips of Mrs D,
    he squeezes the trigger and takes her last picture.
20. Half a second later, the bullet hits her square in the mouth
    and explodes her back brain.
21. One second later, he hears and records her last words:...
    flesh flesh fl...
22. Mrs D has ceased to exist half a second *before* he hears and
    records her last words.
23. Expose negative.
24. Wipe tape.
25. Not knowing what is and is not knowing, Mr B knew *not*
    Mrs D.
26. Mr B is now at a point in space, 186,000 miles from Earth
    at point B". (See proposition #5.)
27. Mrs D is back on Earth at point D".
28. Mr B has the same basic equipment but has substituted an
    E&G Bradly laser gun emitting intense beams of coherent
    light at 186,000 miles per second, capable of piercing the
    hardest substance, even diamond...laser guns on the table,
    how dumb can you be?
29. Mrs D has amplified her voice to accommodate the altered
    distance relationship.
30. At one second *after* 4:00 p.m., Mr B sights the ugly word
    on Mrs D's ugly mouth.
31. Now, since Mr B is one light-second away from Mrs D, and
    it takes one second for her image to reach point B", Mr B
    has, needless to say, provided himself with a more powerful
    telescope to take a picture of Mrs D...not at one second
    after 4:00 p.m., of course, but at exactly 4:00 p.m., present
    Earth Time.
32. One second later, Bradly's laser slices through Mrs D's big
    mouth and on my way rejoicing.
33. Mr B has taken the last picture of Mrs D (for Dead).
34. Mrs D is always dead when Mr B takes her death picture, a
    second later.
35. Mrs D existed only in her last image and her last words,
    which arrive, of course, from Pitman's 'Commonsense Arith-
    metic' some hours later...so shut off the recorder...expose
    the negative.
36. Mrs D's word and image never existed.

1. From Pitman's 'Commonsense Arithmetic', 1917:
   "Walks at the rate of 18 miles per day. Will he be there in
   time?"
2. From Claude P‚lieu, 'San Francisco 9, Beach':
   "Please adjust your brakes; a great risk in 'dancing.'"
3. From 'Transatlantic Review, 14':

6. From 'Work in Progress':
   "terrible bright sun...raw pealed face...this thing dying
   there in my arms..."
7. I would like to sound a word of warning to the 'Dancing Acad-
   emy', "In Hazard":
   Should the world's gravity be reduced by The Other Half, who
   is known as 'Gravity Gert', the force of the sun's rays would
   increase by one half...from Pitman's 'Commonsense Arithme-
   tic'...constituting The Heat Death.
8. From 'Work in Progress':
   "The formulae are fierce, can't hold the bastards back. The
   tide is coming in at Hiroshima, you dumb Earth hicks, sauve
   qui peut!"
9. From 'The Moving Times:
   "Only one caller this week; plain Mr Jones. Going to reach
   Frisco but we'll all be dead."
