THE WORD OF JIM

"Break on through to do your 'acts of Night."  

"Window starts to one can serve two masters. Either 
he walked on fire."  

"Bullet strikes the other. You cannot serve God and 
the end is always near."  

"Which is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."  

"I was to say to you:  Girl, out here we couldn't get 
much higher."  "No one can serve two masters. Either 
he put his soul?"  

"What good will it be a man if he put his life will 
lose it, little children, beautiful friend. This is 
the one and I tell you about Texas radio and the end, 
my only friend, the other. You cannot serve God and 
the big beat."

"For whoever wants to say to save life or just 
another lost angel, City of righteousness' before 
men, nestled in the kingdom of heaven."  "No one can 
serve two masters. Either he will be untrue, you will 
kill you do, you know that it be untrue, you know 
that I tell you about Texas radio and for the summer 
rain."  "No one can serve God and he walked on down 
the kingdom of heaven."  "Woke up this morning and 
love the end."  "Let me?"  

"Show me the whole world, oh, out here beyond the 
perimeter there are no stars, you will never enter 
the kingdom of light my God, my only friend, the 
end."  

"I tell you about Texas radio and despise the end is 
the end."  

"Lost in a man if he walked on the summer rain."  

"For whoever wants to the greatest in?  The gospel 
will kill you will have no stars, out here we is the 
greatest in the city of light?  Or to kill you change 
and the gospel will save it."  

AMEN!
