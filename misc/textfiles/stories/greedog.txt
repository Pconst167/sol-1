                         THE GREEDY DOG

   Once upon a time . . . a dog managed to steal a large steak from a 
butcher's shop, and ran into the woods to eat it in peace. On reaching the 
banks of a stream, he happened to see his face reflected in the water. Never 
for a moment thinking that he was looking at himself in the water, what he
thought he saw was another dog, holding a large steak in its mouth. 
   Being a greedy dog, he jumped into the stream to snatch the other dog's 
meat. Of course, the reflection vanished and he could see no sign of dog or 
steak.
   Only then did he realize that, when he barked to frighten the other, he had
dropped his stolen meat. Unluckily for him, the current was swift and the 
steak had been carried away. And though the dog hunted all over, he couldn't 
find a trace of it. Which meant, that instead of having two steaks. he was 
left with nothing.
