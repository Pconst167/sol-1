
BRAMBLES
  by Gordon Chapman

  There's brambles growing everywhere. They don't block all the paths, 
but they're a major obstacle on every one of them. Damn, I hate that. 
Some of the paths have more visible wear than others, but who the hell 
knows what that means. Who knows who has taken these paths before, for 
all I know, it could just be forest animals, and who knows where they 
want to go? I need some kind of faith, I mean, it's obvious that some of 
the paths are wrong choices, but I need to know that at least some of 
them will make it down to the sea. I absolutely have to get there. 

  The sea. I can hear it from here. The waves crash like thunder, they're 
obviously breaking close to the beach, making getting in and out of the 
water treacherous as hell. I can practically smell the salt, but I can't 
get near them. Someone must be trying to tell me something in a seriously 
cruel way.

  I'm in a movie now. There's cops everywhere, sirens wailing and rubber 
squealing, and Christ only knows how many of them with .357's want to 
leave a hole in my skull. I've got the attache case full of one thousand 
dollar bills and a million roads to nowhere. I don't know the end to this 
plot. There ought to be thin, long legged women in Ray-Ban sunglasses in 
this movie, and they should have guns. And they'd know which way to go. 
Racing from the gunfire, we'd kick off our shoes, and sprint on the wet 
sand, leaving a contrail of spray behind us. We'd jump in our helicopter, 
and its pontoons would lift from the sea, and I'd laugh out the open door, 
as the chopper tilted forward and accelerated over the water with the 
bullets flying around me. I'd know that they couldn't hit me.

  Maybe.

  I bet you didn't know that I was in an airplane crash. I was. It shouldn't 
have been poetry. A desperate dance of steel and wind, the sea and gasoline. 
It was over too quickly to describe faithfully, a brief, fatal tearing of 
metal and breaking of glass, then silence. I had wrestled, presumably help-
fully, with the controls as the pilot's face reddened and the veins in his
neck bulged explosively. Then, when I looked over, the engine dead, no sound 
other than the rain on the rolling ocean, he was gone. No choices, no paths, 
and the wreck sinking slowly and quietly without so much as a groan of 
protest. The water moved from my ankles to my knees in a couple of seconds. 
Bad cinematography. Not enough dramatic emphasis.  

  You ought to learn something from things like that, but the whole 
experience was no more enlightening than being under some psychedelic haze 
and watching the mix of oil and coloured water being projected on the wall 
by some long-haired sixties refugee who said, "Far Out" over and over and 
over at least ten thousand times a day in 1967.    

  You'd think I'd learn. It's not like I haven't had my proverbial 'girl in 
a flatbed ford,' or even a dozen of them, but hell; I'll hear the sound of 
the rumbling V-8, and see the black shit-kicker boots, then I'll dive into 
the cab. It's probably another movie. She's really not from Camrose, Alberta, 
and there's a Kalishnakov under the seat. I'll end up in another shower of 
bullets, kicking up a muddy spray on a dirt road, and diving through the 
brambles.

  Maybe not.
