
The Wolf and the Lamb 
  by Aesop
 
WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to
lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the
Lamb the Wolf's right to eat him.  He thus addressed him:
"Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me."  "Indeed," bleated
the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, "I was not then born."  Then
said the Wolf, "You feed in my pasture."  "No, good sir," replied
the Lamb, "I have not yet tasted grass."  Again said the Wolf,
"You drink of my well."  "No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet
drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink
to me."  Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying,
"Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every
one of my imputations."  

The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.

  And, with an updated twist:




THE OLD LADY AND THE CRYPT or BLOOD
  by someone who read Aesop

GANGMEMBER, meeting an Old Lady astray from the crowd, resolved not 
to waste the old bitch, but wanted to listen to pleas of mercy and 
desperation from the Old Lady of Gangmember's right to prey on her. 
He vexed the old broad, "You get your money and food stamps from the
government. I get none!" "PLEASE," bleated the Old Lady, "I was born a
long time ago and made no rules." The Gangmember retorted, "Old and 
time for you to die." "BUT," exclaimed the Old Lady, "If you take my
life, I can no longer be robbed once a month." The Gangmember threatened,
"You don't have the right to be on my turf." Old Lady pleaded, "I got
lost on the subway and didn't mean to be here. Why, I could even be 
your Mother!"  Upon which the Gangmember shot her and robbed her of all 
she had, saying, "Old Lady you ain't shit to me! even if you were my
mother. I need the green."

The gangmember has needs too, ya know, even if, needlessly meaningless.
