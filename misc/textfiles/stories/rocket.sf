Sit back and take a deep breath, then put it back....for you are about to
hear a harrowing tale of heroism, valour, bravery and courage .... with some
steaming space-gypsies thrown in.
__________________________________________________________________________
Roger Rogerson, Colonel in Its Majesties Space-O-Navy coolly surveyed the
situation.  The tension had been building for weeks, the opposing parties
had frequently skirmished and now matters had come to a head.  This would be
a battle to the death.  Someone had to.....clean up the apartment !!!
Yes that's right, horrible as it may sound this cesspit of reflective
underwear, space-grams from Venus and half chewed Space-Chocs was going to
have to be cleaned up.  Roger decided to put his best foot forward
.....outside the door......and down the Gravitic Lift......and into
the Patented People Mover street........
  Calmly he raised his noble brow skywards to gaze at his apartment (the one
with the green fumes leaking suspiciously out the window) and decided
something.......STUFF IT !
With his highly trained arm he raised his highly dangerous Space-O-Blaster
and blew his highly offensive flat into highly small pieces.....The Space
Corps would pick up the tab, and probably give him a medal for halting an
epidemic in its pustulent tracks.

  All of a sudden, the author ran out of plot, so he said ....
  All of a sudden, his wristwatch bleeped and unfolded into a lightweight 7
foot wide hologrammatic screen with 14 inch speaker cones giving true
quadrophonic sound with such low distortion it would make you weep......
"Top Secret message incoming." bellowed a 747 inside the device.
  "Attention Roger, " came a voice that boomed halfway down the street and
scared all the pets...."  This is the highly secretive top-super-mega Heroes
and General Daredevil Lunatic Fringe Society who no-one has ever heard of
because we don't exist really....."

  The speaker looked like Idi Amin, Sadam Hussein, the Ayatollah and the
last dozen American Chiefs of Staff rolled into one.  From somewhere under
the medals, gold braid, ribbons and decorations, Roger noted a beady little
red eye twitching about nervously.
  "Chadwick...., " blasted Roger in dulcet tones that made all women between
15 and 82 years of age in the surrounding area internally melt with delight.
 "Chadwick, have you been ransacking the cereal packets and sending off for
  those ridiculous play uniforms again....."
 "I'm sorry, Colonel Rogerson, sir, b-b-but I just can't help it" blurted
 the quivering Chadwick, "I do so want to join Its Majesties Space-O-
 Navy..."
 In a voice that made all female animals in the surrounding area develop
 a nervous twitch, Roger replied.....
  "I'm sorry, faithful yet incredibly idiotic sidekick.  We can't have
kindergarten dropouts with terminal B.O and the social graces of a pox-
ridden clam like your vile self joining the incredibly useless yet very
necessary for tax reasons Space-O-Navy now, can we."

  "Oh Colonel," blubbed Chadwick " so cruel, yet so handsome......"  His
pathetic voice fell away in a torrent of tears.
  "Come, come Chadwick, don't blubber...why did you call me, what's the
idiotic plot going to be this time..wait... don't tell me yet.  First, feed
me that corny, cliched line that lets me look concerned, yet ready, anxious
yet brave and you know the rest."
   "Yes sir, Colonel sir.  Here goes...."
   "THE EARTH NEEDS YOU AGAIN, SIR !!!!!"
****************************************************************************

Will Roger respond ....
  Will Roger stop posing....
   Will Chadwick get to join the Space-O-Navy....

Keep listening (or even reading) and await the next incredible installment
of   Rocket Roger in The Space-O-Navy !!!!!!

============================================================================
                                 Episode Two
============================================================================

In our last exciting episode, Colonel Rogerson was told that Earth was being
threatened with complete and utter destruction, unmatched since the 2012 AD
Grand Final.  After posing dramatically, he turned to his Wrist-O-Studio
and told Chadwick, his idiot assistant, currently dressed as 18 separate
world leaders....at once.... that he would be at HQ as soon as the dramatic
music stopped.
============================================================================
As the last nauseating notes drifted up to the ether, much to the annoyance
of several minor deities, Roger strapped on his fusion powered Ferrari
Roller Skates and zapped off into the street, dodging the flying advertising
robots that plagued everyone nowadays.

There was one particular robot that kept harrowing our Hero, insisting that
his life was incomplete without Time-Life-Britannica-Reader's Digest's
Complete Guide to Great Cheese Makers of Titan.  Roger could not see the
validity of this case and politely requested, for the 532nd time this
month...
"Piss off or I'll blow your chromic head into space-vapour" When the stupid
but persistent robot (sounds like our Marketing Students) kept following him
Roger grabbed it out of the air, and reprogrammed it to have a strong desire
to be within 4 miles of the centre of the Sun.

Roger made the final turn off the Skate-a-way into the building with huge 
neon sign on top...."Highly Secretive Top-Super-Mega Heroes and General
Daredevils Lunatic Fringe Society (please kill yourself after reading this
sign)".
He was met by the strange creature that called itself Chadwick, which was
strange because everyone else called him "What's that bloody smell ?"

"Thank God you're here Colonel Rogerson, this episode is really stretching
out, and we haven't even begun plot exposition.  Please hurry to the
briefing closet."

The briefing closet was a security device whose stupidity was unparalleled
in the history of sneaky backstabbing espionage.  The directors of the
H.S.T.S.M.H.G.D.L.F.S decided to build a huge briefing room with the latest
in electronic briefing gadgetry and security devices, then "For super-
safety," decided to meet in the basement broom closet.  This would "fool any
idiot trying to blow the building up."  Naturally, they would be buried
under the rubble of a 40-storey building, but at least the ENEMY didn't get
them.

Waiting in the broom closet were two men.  The first was the Head of the
H.S.T etc, Commander Xenophobia Bloodlust.  The second was Dr. Frankenstein
Juliff, mad inventor of weird phrases as well as the most lethal modular
gadgets in the history of Gadgetry, with a beard you could lose a Arcturan
Mega-Wombat in.

Command Bloodlust stepped forward....
"We have your mission Roger.  It will be deadly dangerous, but we want you
to do it because otherwise the story finishes here.
ATTENTION, PLOT DEVICE COMING UP: "Evil, sadistic communist sympathizer
aliens have set up a base on Uranus .....  Shut up Chadwick, no biology
jokes.  They have built ....The Stupo-Ray, an incredibly fiendish plot-twist
which turns whoever it hits into a drooling vegetable with no intelligence
at all.  They plan to fire it at Earth take over the world.  We have a
suspicion they already fired it at some banana republic down South
called....Australia.  They hit a little village called Canberra, but it
didn't seem to change anything."
"Your mission, should you decide to want to keep your pension plan, is to
infiltrate the enemy base on Uranus....Shut up, Chadwick....  destroy the
Stupo-Ray and save any beautiful maidens along the way....
CAN YOU DO IT, ROGERSON ? "
______________________________________________________________________

Can Roger do it ?
  What can't Roger do ?
    Will Chadwick get in that really neat joke about (SHUT UP, SCRIBE !!)
      Sorry....
        Will the people of Canberra notice any change in the politicians ?

Read on in the next exciting episode of..........

Rocket Roger Rogerson of the Space-O-Navy !!!

============================================================================
                                Episode Three
============================================================================

(Ed. Beware the In-Joke.  It lurks in every line about Doctor Juliff.)
In our last episode, Roger learned of the imminent destruction of the Earth
intelligentsia by the Stupo-Ray.  In a meeting with Commander Bloodlust and
Dr Frank 'Frankenstein' Juliff, Roger is asked whether he will accept the
mission........
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


"I would be honored, sir !!!" lied Roger.  Actually, he was hoping the
mission involved a fact-finding tour to Eroticon VI, or shooting lots of
small furry mammals out of cannons on Alpha Centauri; he hated dangerous
missions, they tended to be, well, dangerous !!
"Good show, Roger !!" wheezed the Commander, "But before you go, Dr Juliff
has been working on a few gadgets for you.  He tells me they're all modular
and really adaptable...Please continue, Doctor..."

Dr Juliff stepped forward....sort of....more like.....lunged forward and
shoved the most lethal weapon Roger had ever seen into his face.
"See this, son ?!" bellowed the good doctor.
Roger nodded slowly....
"Looks the spitting image of the M99 Mega-Pain Death Blaster, don't it "
Roger started to answer, but Dr. Juliff wheeled round and talked to the
wall, ceiling and the general atmosphere....
"I'll bloody say it does, look at the modules on this baby...standard Heat
Sensor gizmo here and this Sureshot Sniping Gizwhacker right here, I mean if
you couldn't hit a fly's left eyeball from a furlong away, Jeez, ya might as
well just go out and cook dinner for six, know what I mean, son.  Right you
do....."

"Sorry, my lad where was I, hmm ? Oh yes the M99 and so on...well it's not,
it's actually a pencil, cunningly disguised at great expense.  See, look at
this...you take off this module here, redirect this thingummy here point
this over here, divide by the number you first thought of, that's a joke,
boy, -laugh, and hey presto, Bob's your Auntie's best friend...A pencil !
Whaddaya think of that, son ?"

Roger didn't think much at all, he was too busy following the blur of hair
and trying to spot where the voice came out of.  Unfortunately, the look on
his face set the good doctor off again....

"What are you looking like that for, you've got no idea how useful this
little baby is...fully modular, too.  Imagine this, Charlie....you're in a
prison cell out back o' beyond, how you gonna send a rescue note without
this little baby, eh ?  Didn't think of that, did ya...Well there's more
where that came from, just you wait here till the Great Spotted Blonks come
home to roost..... "

He left in a hurry muttering something about "Why don't they get heroes that
buy books about modules, I've got a brilliant one in the Highly Secret
Bookshop..."

Roger shuffled over to the Commander and whispered,
"Where did you find him ?"
"No-one's actually sure, " mumbled the Commander "He just showed up one day,
said he was from the Victorious Centre for Alien Elimination, and occupied
an office.  We let him stay, as long he keeps turning out gizmos.  He
brilliant, if just a little eccentric."

Dr. Juliff whizzed back in a cloud of metaphors.
"Cop this lot, Roger, the latest in modular suits packed with features from
the late twentieth century, the Seventies to be exact.  Whack this gear on,
Rog."
Roger hated being called Rog, but something in Juliff's eye told him to do
what he was told.
"I'll just whack these babies in here...." said Dr. Juliff as he attached
the flare modules to the trouser section.
"Not too sure about them myself, but Sergeant Redpath seemed pretty sure."
                             In-Joke Mk II-----^^^^^
"One last thing, Roger, this suitcase that transforms at the press of a
button into....another suitcase !!  You'll probably think of a use for it
by, say, the fifth episode.  I mean, you'd better hurry up, because my
goat's gander been got at by the monkey's short and tall of it, so I'm
singing everything while I build a bloody brick wall and ...."
The Commander stepped forward and smacked the brilliant Doctor upside the
head with a very functional truncheon.
"Sorry Roger, he just goes on a bit, sometimes...." He started dragging him
out...." Good luck with the mission Roger, you'll be catching the 12:43
shuttle to Moonie Base One, tickets under the mat on the way out....bye
now."

Roger sighed, and trudged towards the door.  Chadwick, the Lunatic Sidekick
was waiting for him, and as usual smelled like the North end of a South-
bound vulture.  He didn't look too dissimilar either, dressed as he was in a
Kaftan six sizes too big with a shoulder length wig on backwards.  His nose
was bloody from walking into walls.....
"Are we going to Moonie Base One, Colonel Rogerson, I've always wanted to go
there !"
"You wanting to go there is hardly a reason for their tourist bureau to
start leaping up and down for joy, Chadwick since you are the only so-called
human alive who can repulse a battalion of Tranthian Skunk-Fiends.  Besides,
I don't think those throwbacks have any bureaus, except for the ones they
keep their alleged clothing in.  I don't see why we have to dress like
them...."

Moonie Base One represents one of the triumphs of the New Age movement.
After all that messing about with Crystals and funny voices, they felt the
Karma of the Earth just wasn't right.  So a group of militant hippies, if
you can call owning a picture of Rambo militant, hired a shuttle, landed at
Moon Base One, and sort of took over.  And like, wow man, the breadheads
didn't care !  Actually the astronomical cost of running Moon Base One was
making the 'breadheads' think carefully about maybe playing darts with the
dome and collecting on the insurance.  So they didn't mind the hippies
keeping the Base, as long as they allowed normal traffic through.
Unfortunately, the hippies insisted only 'Brothers and Sisters of the Soil'
could come through.  The government hit back, as it usually does, by being
sneaky.  It issued all travellers with flares, beads, kaftans and CND
necklaces, gave them phrase books and sent them to the renamed Moonie Base
One.  The hippies were overjoyed to see all these new Brothers and Sisters
come filing through the Gates of Karma.  So overjoyed, in fact, that they
didn't mind letting their new recruits "just pop off to Delton III for a bit
to meditate for a while....like, man, wow, dig it."
When none of them returned, they didn't really notice; what, with the Lunar
soil producing the most potent marijuana in the Solar System, you wouldn't
notice much either.

WELCOME TO THE MOST ABRUPT ENDING SINCE NAPOLEON DECIDED HE COULDN'T !!

Thanks to some highly expensive editing procedures, you'll have to wait till
the end of episode four for a cliff-hanger.  Some of our older readers may
have been getting heart trouble anyway, so breath deep and relax till next
time when you'll see.......

Rocket Roger meets Episode Four in a small bar in downtown Milan !

============================================================================
                                Episode Four
============================================================================
As Roger and Chadwick hurriedly filed through to the departure area, dodging
weirdos handing out flowers etc and entered the VVVVVVVVVVVVVFT loading bay.
The V(etc)FT was the direct descendant of the Very Fast Train project, a
marvel of engineering, and rather a good joke, actually.  (Well, I liked
it.)
It would take them to Saturn's largest moon, Titan in a matter of hours,
rather than the months it used to take when hitch-hiking from passing
Planetary probes.  They still couldn't make edible sandwiches though, and
the coffee was still twenty dollars a slice......

Roger would have been bothered by all this, except his mind was on other
things, not the least of which was the modular pencil, which, being 4ft long
and bristling with weaponry while being hidden in his trousers, gave him a
nasty pain and got several impressed looks from many women, as well as a few
men.  The other pressing issue was the news that Pirate Space Accountants,
the scourge of the System, had been spotted in the area.

Space Accountants were a new development in an old business, piracy.
Accountants had always been pirates but with the advent of planet sized
computers, human accountants were made redundant.  Though they stopped
training them, there were a lot of old accountants hanging around
desperately stopping people in the street begging to be allowed to audit
them, for old times sake.  Eventually, a large group of them (known as an
'overbudgeting of accountants') bought a ship, and started cruising the
space lanes, stopping ships and auditing everyone on board, giving them
coffee and company prospectuses etc... then slitting their throats.

As the train cranked up to 0.65 C, which is very bloody fast (thus the
name), Roger ran over a few facts in his trembling mind.  Firstly, he knew
the concept of Pirate Space Accountants was irresistible and would certainly
be developed further, which meant peril for him.  Secondly, he had no idea
how to get to Uranus...Shut up, Chadwick....and thirdly, the missiles and
laser bolts crackling outside his window were getting rather noisy, as was
Chadwick who cowered over Roger's head, snug in the baggage rack.  Laser
Bolts ?!!

Roger leapt to his heroic feet, and struck a meaningful pose, ready to leap
into action as the Pirate Accountants boarded the train.  Unfortunately, he
leapt too hard and forgot about the weightlessness.  As he floated helpless,
but very brave, the train screeched to a halt, and Roger slammed into the
far wall and slid to the floor in a crumpled heap.  Chadwick did likewise,
but swapped baggage racks in the process.  After a few minutes passed, and
normal gravity had been restored, the door to Roger's compartment slid open.
The strange figure that entered was a sight not many have seen and survived.
A suit from Regent Street was accompanied by a smart leather briefcase, an
eyepatch, a bowler hat on top of a fiery red headscarf and a huge cutlass in
the other hand that would have made Blackbeard worry.

"Good evening sir, and yo ho ho."
Roger slowly awoke.......
"My card, sir....."
It read "Messrs Scurvy Dog Fletcher & Mad Dog St-Clair III".
"Shall we get down to business sir, or shall I slit your gullet and strangle
you with your own intestines ?"

As the Pirate Accountant awaited Roger's answer a soft moan came from the
baggage racks, which quickly escalated to a scream as Chadwick rolled off
the rack and onto the Pirate, bringing him down in a flurry of "Pardon me,
sir" and "I'll keelhaul the scurvy landlubber !"
"Good work Chadwick, " exclaimed Roger as he practised his art of kicking
the opponent when he's down.
"Now let's get off this train, and save the Earth."

Cautiously, Roger stepped outside his compartment.  The corridor was empty,
save a butler robot trundling towards Roger carrying a huge cocktail.  Roger
recognized it as a Brain Melter, a drink that made the Pan-Galactic Gargle
Blaster look like Santraginnian Mineral Water.  Brain Melter hangovers were
know to last at least 16 years, thus the highly expensive drink was popular
only with the spoiled offspring of the mega-rich.

The robot turned and entered the compartment next to Roger's.  A horrible
whining noise emerged.
"No no no, you stupid oik !! The parent company owns a 24% share in itself
while leasing back half the equipment under Section 13 ! Call yourself an
accountant.  Ha ! I know Lesser Spotted Gronks with more brain power !! Get
it right, peasant before you bore me to death !!! "

Roger peeked round the door and saw a Pirate Accountant lurching in a number
frenzy, desperately scribbling figures on a wall sized piece of paper.
Watching him and pointing madly at various bits of the horribly convoluted
diagram was the most beautiful woman Roger had ever seen; well...bits of
her, anyway....

Her clothing was exquisite, obviously money was no object to this socialite.
Star Opals graced her ears, a gold and iridium weave dress clung tightly to
her svelte figure.  Roger knew at once......it was all surgery.  After all,
how genuine can a woman be, if their breasts have been filled and lifted so
many times they nestle on her shoulders, and affect her hearing !!

As Chadwick closed on Roger's heels, the woman turned, nose upturned.
"What's that godawful smell....Who the kufnuk are you ? "
Roger noticed that the accountant was stuck in an accounting frenzy, a
peculiar condition in which an accountant wouldn't notice if you ripped his
nose and ears off and served them to him on toast.
"I'm Colonel Roger Rogerson, ma'am.  At your service.  I've been ordered to
rescue any beautiful maidens I find, would you care to ...."
"By you ?" laughed the woman. "No way, prole. No-one touches me until they
reach at least eight million groats a year.  Besides, this little man, " she
gestured toward the still scribbling accountant "is going to tell me how
rich I am.  So off you go, and take your pet with you."

Roger shrugged and turned to leave, only to find the doorway blocked.  No
ordinary blockage, i.e something in the Door department.  This machine was
definitely from the Horribly Beweaponed Death Dealing War Machines
Department.  It wore an eyepatch and bowler hat and was painted with the
legend " Debt Recovery Droid: Pay up in money, or bodily organs."
"Colonel Rogerson ?" droned the robot.  Roger nodded, stupidly.
"About your expense account...."
Roger swallowed nervously, how would he get out of this one.....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How will Roger escape the Debt Droid ?
  Will he really miss having a pancreas ?
    Has the author run out of accounting jokes ? (No way, matey)


Tune in next time for another exciting episode of ....

Rocket Roger Rogerson of the Space-O-Navy !!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

============================================================================
                                Episode Five
============================================================================
In the last episode, Roger escaped the pirate accountant, but was now being
menaced by a Debt Recovery Droid, the most hideous machine ever devised for
financial purposes, except the random phrase program making up Australia's
budgets, known as the Keating Device. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Roger stood there, his mind worked feverishly.  Unfortunately, it wasn't
working on a brilliant plan.  It was actually searching its memory and
preparing an Oscar-winning rendition of Roger's life, ready to let it flash
before his eyes.  Roger was going to die, or so he thought.

Chadwick, with the cockiest look on his face since Saddam Hussein sent the
troops in, stepped forward and looked up at the robot.
"Hey robot, recite Pi to twenty billion decimal places.   Run for it Roger
!!!"  Chadwick took off in a blur, only to be picked up by the robot's
massive arm.
"YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING TOO MANY STAR TREK RE-RUNS, THAT ONE DOESN'T WORK ANY
MORE."
"Well," squirmed Chadwick, trying to wrestle free, "what does work ?"
"NOTHING LIKE THAT, INSECT ! YOU THINK I'D TELL YOU ?! "

Just then Roger noticed something shiny pinned to the robot's bowler hat.
He couldn't quite make out if it was Kylie Minogue or an Efrishian Drankut.
He decided to take a chance: "Everybody's doing a brand new dance now...."
he sang hopefully.  With astonishing speed, the droid launched into a dance
routine, flinging Chadwick down the hallway, while deploying a blonde wig on
its head and a tight pink skirt around its waist.
"COME ON BABY, DO THE LOCOMOTION !!!"
Roger nipped past the droid and sped off down the hall.
"I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now..." suggested
Roger over his shoulder.
"COME ON BABY, DO THE LOCOMOTION !!!" bellowed the joyous robot clanking
around the hallway like the Flying Scotsman on amphetamines.

Laughing confidently, Roger turned the corner and entered the escape pod
area.  A sign on the wall said "Only to be used when running out of train
jokes.  Warning escape pods have very little joke capability. Use
sparingly." Nice talking signs they have round here, thought Roger as he
decided to take a chance on the jokes, and on being in a confined space with
Chadwick.

Making sure Chadwick sat next to the extraction fan, Roger reviewed his
options.  There weren't many.  He decided the best jokes and plot line would
be found aboard the Pirate Accountants now empty ship.  As he let the pod
slide gently out of its berth, he felt a twinge of sorrow for the pirates.
Being trapped on the same train as that woman was a fate to hideous to
contemplate.  But then again, that's the only kind of fate accountants
deserve.

A short time later, the pod docked with the Pirates Ship, the romantically
named Serial Number 29X8348H.  The airlock hissed open and Roger entered the
Pirate ship's docking area.  A sign on the wall read "Please complete this
form in triplicate before entering the ship."  Three small forms fell
through a slot in the wall and a tiny shelf unfolded itself from the wall,
but it was too high up and far too small, so Roger just used his knee.

Name: Colonel Roger Rogerson
Occupation: Hero
Purpose of Visit: Takeover Bid

As Roger wondered what to do with the forms, the inner airlock slid open.
On the other side stood a young boy, about sixteen years old.  "Obviously
the office junior gopher," thought Roger, and handed the forms to the boy.
"What are the forms for ?" queried Roger.
"The first goes to head office, " replied the boy "The second to our files,
 and the third is for burning."
"Burning ?!" gasped Roger.
"Yes, " said the boy, very matter-of-factly, "something's got to run the
 ship."

Pirate Space Accountants, having rejected all forms of computerization and
most forms of machinery, nevertheless need to power their spaceships.  A
four month committee meeting decided that steam power, which represented the
Golden Age of Filthy Luchre (Industrial Revolution) was most suitable.  Steam
power requires burning, however and all the coal and coke were long gone.
However, accounting's most abundant resource was easily found: Paper.
Centuries of filling forms in triplicate had resulted in a paper mountain so
vast, it would run their fleets for centuries.

Roger made his way to the bridge, crossed the bridge and entered the
'Pilot's Office.' (Accountants took everything so literally !) It held a
bewildering array of pipes, tubes and gauges with not a binary digit in
sight !  As he gazed around, one sign caught his eye.  "Engine Room" it
read, sitting just above a large metal funnel.
"Hello ?" shouted Roger into the funnel.
"Good afternoon, sir." came the reply. "Are you the new Managing Director ?"
"I..I believe so." answered Roger.
"What are your goals and objectives, sir.  We need them to aid in
formulating engine policy."
"Engine policy ?"
"Yes sir, the engine has to be happy with its role in our company.  We give
it a policy, like, our last policy of catching your train before the next
financial period.  Understand ?"
"I believe I do, yes.  Well my goal is to get to Titan as fast as possible."
"Can do, sir.  I'll schedule a committee meeting for Friday lunch."
"What about now ?" bellowed Roger,"or you'll be sucking vacuum !!!"
"Yes sir, now is also a very good time for me."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Will Roger make it to Titan ??
  Will the committee decide on engine policy ?
    Will Chadwick rate another mention in this story ?

Tune in next time, for another brilliantly written, if a little hazy at
times...

Rocket Roger Rogerson of the Space-O-Navy !!!

============================================================================
                                 Episode Six
============================================================================
Attention:  The David Syme business school has expressed its dismay at the
portrayal of committees in this story as being slow, indecisive and useless.
They intend to present a draft proposal for changes, which they are now
discussing in a meeting.  We expect to hear from them around November 2003.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Roger sat at what passed for controls on the Pirate Space Accountants ship.
After all, everyone knows accounting has no efficient controls.  Titan
loomed large in the drawing one of the crew made for him.  There were no
windows on the ship, because windows were clear, and nothing in accounting
practice should be clear.  Like the general public, Roger just assumed the
ship knew where it was going got some sleep.

When he woke up, the ship was berthed and he and Chadwick left.  Roger
resigned as Managing Director, collected his super and promised to invest it
wisely.  That night, around the clubs and bars that dotted Titan City, he
did just that. Titan was still undergoing terraforming and was now the
furthest outpost of what passed for modern civilisation.  That is,
advertising agencies, bars, Japanese restaurants and booming criminal
element.  Few people lived on Titan, because everything had to be shipped in
from Earth, and so was horribly expensive.  Advertisements tended to run
something like: "Got a few extra gold bars lying around ?  Then why not
invest in this genuine chair !!"

With Titan being as far out as any ships went, Roger had a problem.  He had
to reach Uranus....Shut up, Chadwick....and save the Earth from the hideous,
malicious, evil-smelling, ugly aliens who wouldn't think twice about
stealing your garden hose.  The author also had a problem; making this
crossing of half a solar system sound plausible without inventing
teleportation. Hmmmm......

Roger was deep in thought, contemplating his navel, when he became aware of
a strange, overpowering voice behind him.  He turned, to see it was coming
from a small CRT mounted under a sign that read OWT OF ORDUR (Dodgy signs).
"I'm Arthur !!" claimed the fat, ridiculously clothed figure.
"And I'm Wayne !!"  offered the other moronic looking character.
"Are you having trouble saving the..."
"Universe ?!" piped up the other.
"Can't get to Uranus to fight the evil alien infestation "
"Then come on down to Dodgy Brother's Faster Than Light Space Taxis !!" they
announced in an approximation of unison.
"Since hyperspace is actually nowhere, we'll..."
"Get you nowhere fast !" bellowed the other flagellating throwback.
"Just press the button under this screen and we'll be there in a ...."
"Taxi !!" "Jiffy !!" "Nice suit !!" "Few hours !!!"

Chadwick piped up "Are we taking a taxi to the alien base, Colonel ?"
"We don't seem to have much choice, little smelly sidekick. "
Chadwick press the button, which promptly broke off in his hand.  The TV
screen and the section of wall it sat in slowly moved up, revealing a
decaying embarrassment to the automotive industry.  Inside it sat two
embarrassments to their Mother: The Dodgy Brothers.

"Another potential customer, Arthur."
"Whaddaya mean 'another.'  You're not still saying that bloody dog was a
 customer, are ya ?"
"Shut up, Arthur....Good evening, gentlemen.  Care to fly the friendly
 skies....no....Good, you'll want us instead then.  Climb in...we're bound
 for Uranus....Shut up, Arthur."

Many strange sights were beheld by the occupants of this weird vehicles.
Not the least of which was what looked like a blue police box with a scarf
hanging out the door.  Wayne managed to sideswipe it, even though there was
nothing else around for at least 500 million miles.

Things quietened down for a while, until Wayne announced there was something
'bloody huge' on the Budget Radar.  Arthur asked if it was edible at all,
but got no answer.  As the minutes passed, a metallic glint could be seen
far ahead.  They drifted closer and closer until the glint revealed itself
to be a spaceship.  But it was huge !!  Miles long ! Miles high ! Probably
miles to the lavvys in the back too !!  The taxi was suddenly bathed in a
green light.  Another insidious plot device !!  Also known as a tractor beam
!! Cue suspensful music....Cue terrified looks of helplessness....Cue DANGER
!!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What will happen on the spaceship ?
  Will Roger every get to save the Earth ?
    Will the author run out of plot before that ?
      Send your ideas to me, how will this story end ?

See you next episode, same VAX-time, same VAX-account number for.....

Rocket Roger gets frisky and watches Olympic Gymnastics !!!!

============================================================================
                                Episode Seven
============================================================================
Episode Seven of Rocket Roger; you're welcome to it.  In our last thrilling
episode, the Dodgy Brothers, Roger and Chadwick were all trapped in a FTL
Space Taxi being dragged into a giant space ship.  What fate awaits them ?
Read on if you dare (or if you're skipping lectures, slack hoons.)
============================================================================
The green light bathing their tiny craft grew more intense as they
approached the gigantic ship.  As they came nearer, Roger could make out a
name on its prow: The Challanic.  Not THE Challanic !! (see end of paragraph
to understand the joke.) This ship vanished sixty years ago,on its way to
Alpha Centauri to build a colony.  What fate befell the ship and its crew.
They would find out soon enough......

They stepped out of their taxi into the ships docking bay.  Strange thing
was, it looked more like an office.  Desks, carpeting, flimsy cardboard type
separators, and lots of graphs all over the place.  On the near wall Roger
could see large photographs of the ships namesakes: The space shuttle
Challenger and the ocean liner Titanic.

A woman in her early forties, hair drawn back tight into a bun, glasses out
of the 1950s and the most runway sized shoulder pads Roger had ever seen.
This woman obviously took power dressing to its credible limit.
"Aha, you gentle-persons must be the management consultants."
"Err...no...you dragged us in here, remember ?" answered Roger.
"Yes, we thought you were trying to dodge the issue.  Most consultants do."
replied the woman, looking bemused.  "Who are you, then.  Did personnel send
you up ?"
"No, we're trying to get to Uranus." piped up Chadwick.
The woman started to kick him, then her face lit up.
"Oh, you mean the planet ! Sorry little person."
Roger coughed and said "Would it be possible to be dropped off there,
Mrs...err"
"Please !!"  The woman looked shocked. "Young person, while on this ship you
shall mind your manners.  Refer to me as Person Highsec.  I am the High
Secretary on the ship.  As to your original question, I am afraid this ship
isn't going anywhere, we have experienced a temporary breakdown in the
engines."
"How temporary is that ?" asked Roger.
"About sixty years so far.  We're still in committee as to what alternate
solutions we have.  The Propulsive Sub-Committee advises petitioning the
engine to call off industrial action, the Action Sub-Committee wants to kick
it until it starts up again, and the Procrastination Sub-Committee wants to
postpone everything till next year, and have another Christmas Party."
Roger stared at her incredulously.
"Why not just radio Titan and ask for some help ??!!"
"We'd rather solve this on our own, thank you.  We don't want higher
management thinking we are not self-sufficient."

She turned around and Roger stepped back to let the shoulder pads pass him.
"Why don't I take you on a fact finding tour of the ship, maybe you can
think of something we've missed.  I'm sure we'll find some stray bits of
plot lying around."

They started to walk through the ship.  The whole place really was a huge
office.  Men in ties and collars looked nervously at VDUs, the women did
exactly the same (between looking bitchy at each other, and commenting on
each other's taste in clothing).  Ergonomically designed chairs ensured
maximal discomfort, so it must be good for you, and obviously, a committee
had decided on the office decor.  At least six different colours graced each
wall, dotted with weird paintings that probably cost a fortune.
The next area they entered contained a vast number of books, stored neatly
on shelves, thick with dust.
"What are they ?" asked Roger.
"Management texts." replied the female person.  "Actually, no-one reads
them, but we pretend we have.  We all get a one page summary of that lot,
and that just about covers everything you'd need."
"So this is just excess weight ?"
"Yes, I suppose it is.  Why ?"
"Don't you know any physics at all ?"
"Fizziks ?  Who's that ?"
"Well for a start, physics says that if you throw all that out the back as
fast as possible, you'll start to go forwards at a proportional speed.  With
all this stuff here, you'd be at Alpha Centauri in a few months !"
"Wow, I wonder why we never thought of that.  This Fizziks person must be
really clever. I wonder if they'd like a job here....."

While she contemplated that, Roger and Chadwick slipped away, leaving the
Dodgy Brothers to deal with her.
"Don't worry, boys.  With credentials, talent and honesty like yours, I
think you'd make great managers."

Roger and Chadwick started to head back to the docking bay.  They passed
through more offices.  Modern art furniture could be seen everywhere.
Chairs with backs four feet high were attached to about two square inches of
seat.  The triangular tables fairly creaked under the weight of a magazine
called Management Hourly.  They eventually found their way back to the
alleged docking bay, climbed in the alleged taxi and sped off to further
adventures and thrilling, if a little unbelievable, plot lines.


See you next time on ....
Rocket Roger Passes the half way mark !!!

============================================================================
                                Episode Eight
============================================================================
Roger and Chadwick made their way through the offices back to the docking
bay, and reentered the taxi.  Roger cringed at the thought of Chadwick's
potent aroma for another 10 hours, and his nose desperately tried to clamber
off his face.

"Well, Chadwick, I wonder which career stereotype we'll criticize this week.
 I think we've run out of business and management-types, so I think its time
 for RELIGION !!!"

As the taxi choked its way out of the huge doors (upon which was taped a
little A4 Poster asking WHERE IS GOD IN YOUR LIFE) (Chisholm Joke)  Roger
turned on the radio.  After much crackling and wheezing, and generally
sounding like a burning pensioner, a voice came through: Very American, very
overdone, very vomit-inducing.... (for GAD, read God in an American accent).

"Brethren !!! Children of GAD !!! Welcome to Amalgamated Religion's Worship-
Meditation-Yoga-Soul-Saving-Hour-Of-Power !!!  We have gathered together to
worship God and contribute to his retirement fund.....  Yes my Children, GAD
himself told me he's going to retire.  He doesn't like this Universe, it
doesn't pay well enough.  He's been offered a job two dimensions down,
unless he gets more money here.  YOU CAN HELP, my children.  Just send
every bit of money you have, and maybe we can convince Him to stay.  Also
GAD confided in me, there aren't enough good looking nuns around, especially
at my nun-school.  If you're ugly and thinking of joining, forget it.
GAD told me that from now on, would-be nuns must be under 25, slim, with a
balcony you could do Romeo and Juliet from.  A complete physical check by
myself, as GAD's most trusted nun-picker, will ensure GAD is pleased with
your sacrifice."

"Now, its time for our most popular segment, Make A Missionary.  Brother
Lauda is out in the Divine Dragster, we're crossing live......Niki, mate,
you there ?" "Ya, Mein Friend I here am being.  Following now am I the taxi-
cab, which is holding two peoples inside, one of racially pure Aryan stock,
the other is being not fit for ze shitting upon.  You are being now a
missionary, yes ? Please to call the present station of listening, and
missionary shall you become.  Happy shall you be as small nations shall you
invade und learn jokes zat you may impress Helga und Gretel very much, Ja."

The radio went dead as Roger leaned over his shoulder and saw the last thing
he needed....the Divine Dragster.  He picked the CB handset and spoke to
Brother Niki.

"You don't mean me do you, Brother Niki ?"
"Who else meaning vould I be.  A missionary you are now, pull over in the
name of God..."
"Now look, hang on a sec....**BOOM***"
The noise came from the alleged engine of the alleged vehicle.  It probably
had something to do with that Geschaftenkwik Missile that slammed into it.
Roger decided pulling over was in everyone's interest, especially his.

Chadwick stopped picking his nose, a habit he'd developed because the
pressure desensitized the cowardice part of his brain, making him feel
brave.  He'd written off to the Space-O-Navy many times, but each time had
received a curt letter thanking him for his suggestion, but the sight of
12,000 men with their fingers buried deep in their nostrils was hardly
likely to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy.

"Are we going to be missionaries, Colonel huh are we, are we, huh ??!!"
"Chadwick, I think I'll be the missionary and you'll be my converter, OK ?"
"What's a converter, sir.  Is it important, do I get a uniform..."
"Well, we'll just saunter into some backwater jungle village and tell
everyone that you'll visit each hut for hours on end, unless they change
their religion.  One whiff of you is enough to make Jesus repent.  Why do
you smell so bad anyway Chadwick."

"Well, my mum buys all my aftershave and deodorant.  But since she died
twenty years ago, and was blind anyway, every morning I spray myself with
rotting flea remover, ancient industrial greaser, or moldy fly spray.  And I
can't really change any of it, because she made me promise to treasure
everything she ever gave me."
"Well, maybe after we get back to Earth, you can hire yourself out as a
locust plague repellent.....for Mexico perhaps."

By this time, the Divine Dragster had pulled up alongside.  But the
dilapidated taxi had no docking mechanism...the bloody thing hardly had a
chassis, transmission, micro-fusion pile, or even fluffy dice !!  It looked
like time for some debate-causing plot twist: an unsuited space walk.

Roger started breathing deeply, oxygenating his blood as much as possible.
Chadwick did the same, filling the cabin with a foul pong.  A side
compartment opened up on the Dragster; that was Roger's destination.
"Ready Chad ?"
"Yes, Colonel"
"Pity....OK, here goes...."

The doors on both sides slowly slid, crunched and ground their way back, and
fell off.  Roger felt the unimaginable cold seeping into his body, his eyes
blurred slightly, as what little air still in his lungs rushed out and froze
before his eyes.  Bracing his feet on the side of the taxi he pushed off and
drifted into the airlock opposite.  He turned to see if Chadwick was with
him.  But no !!!  The airlock door had closed behind him, with Chadwick
still outside, clinging to the handle, and ringing the doorbell for all he
was worth, screaming into silence.  Roger heard air hissing into the airlock
and Brother Lauda's voice over the intercom.

"Are you alright, Brother Rogerson ?"
"Open the damn door, you idiot, he'll die out there !!"
"No chance, I'm not having that smelly, inferior scum on mein nice clean
 ship."
"Open it, or I'll kill you and do it myself, that heap of dysentric camel
 dung still owes me thirty bucks !!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What will Brother Lauda do ?
  Will Chadwick turn into a corpsicle ?
    Will Roger really become a missionary ?
      Will the author think of any more jokes, I hope so ?

All this and nothing else will be revealed in the next thrilling episode of

Rocket Rogerson hunts for a new plot line !!!

P.S Anyone who doesn't believe an unsuited spacewalk is possible please go
to a library, get Arthur C. Clarke's "The View from Serendip" and read
something useful.

============================================================================
                                Episode Nine
============================================================================
In our last thrilling instalment, Roger's little stinkbomb of a buddy,
Chadwick was on the wrong side of an airlock and running out of time fast.
On the inside of the airlock, concerned about the thirty bucks Chadwick
still owed him was our hero, captured by the evil Brother Niki Lauda, worst
driver this side of Venus.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roger desperately looked around the steely compartment, the laughter of the
evil Brother Lauda ringing in his ears.  Then he saw a large red button next
to the airlock.  He rushed over to it, and read the little notice taped
above it.  "Press in the event that someone is trapped outside and about to
die hideously." This was definitely the right time to press it.  After all,
it's very difficult to get money out of someone's pocket when they're frozen
solid, clothes and all.

Roger slammed the button, and a faint whirring noise came from inside the
wall.  Roger looked up at Chadwick through the airlock window.  Chadwick was
looking above the door, at a video camera that extended out towards him,
seemingly capturing that certain look.....certain doom.

"What the hell are you doing, Lauda, you inhuman monster !!" cried Roger,
doing his best Flash Gordon pose.
"I am ze shooting of ze jolly little Death Video to send back to Earth for
ze playing of at ze parties, und family gatherings und all zat kind of
schtuff.  Is good idea, ya "
"Nein...I mean....no ," yelled Roger "Who's going to watch it.  He hasn't
got a family and certainly hasn't got any friends."
"Vot about his parents.  Surely he is not being an amoeba, involved in a
growth experiment that went horribly wrong ?"

"His Father abandoned him fifteen minutes after the birth, and his mother
could barely stand the smell.  When she went blind and learned to rely on
her other senses, every time he walked past, she'd say "Good morning Farmer
Johnson...been out shovelling shit all morning, then ?'  Finally, she made
him leave at the age of sixteen before she became convinced she lived next
to a slaughterhouse without freezer facilities."

A strange quiver crept into Niki's voice.
"Ya, mein parents were the kicking of me out also.  Every day mein Mother
would make all different German food things.  For breakfast pickled pig's
trotters und schnapps.  For lunch pickled peanut butter sandwiches with
pickled apples und schnapps.  For dinner, pickled horses tail soup followed
by pickled pickle in pickle sauce with pickled ice-cream afterwards......und
schnapps.  I HATE GERMAN FOOD !!!  I am a German and I hate German food,
every Geschtinken thing is Braufenzi Geschfrigenzi PICKLED !!! Mein Gott, I
cannot let ze little fat one die.  So disgusting is he, he vill not mind to
be eating my lunch for me, Pickled Martian und schnapps.  We shall speak at
great lengths about how much our parents we are hating."

A moment later, the airlock hissed open.  As the video camera withdrew,
Chadwick's grubby little hands seized it, and he allowed the momentum to
carry him through the airlock into the compartment.
"Colonel Rogerson, sir...Thank you for saving me !!"  This little cliche was
 delivered in typical "Sidekick crawly lick grovel Style".
"That's alright Chad, but you've just spent a good one and a half minutes in
 hard vacuum near absolute zero....You should be frozen solid !!"
"Aha...a normal person would be....but I'm definitely not normal.  You see,
 all the gunge and muck and ancient aerosol I use and can't get rid of seems
 to act as damn good insulation !  Even so, that good one and a half minutes
 was actually a bloody awful one and a half minutes."
Roger smiled.  At least with all those noxious chemicals frozen to Chadwick,
the smell would go away for a while.
"Brother Lauda ," called out Roger, "can we listen to the news for a while,
we're on some urgent business."
The crackling of the weak radio signal carrying the news through the sub-
etha blared into the cabin.

"....and here are the main points again. The City of Melbourne has failed in
its 99th attempt to host the Olympic Games.  Said a spokesdroid 'We're
really looking forward to the next bid so we'll crack a century.'
 Weather; there will be a strong front of alien menace around the Dark Side
of the Moon, while those of you living on Uranus (loud sniggers in the
background) can relax, the alien menace has subsided."

"Oh no Colonel, the alien menace has moved to the Moon, why do you think
they did that ?"
"Probably because the outer edges of the solar system is utterly devoid of
 jokes, I would guess.  Brother Lauda !! Take us to the Dark Side of The
 Moon.  We've got an alien menace to exterminate !
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will the aliens finally show up ?
  When will Chadwick pay up the Thirty bucks ?
    Why has the author engineered the most unbelievable plot since Toxic
      Custard !
       Will Melbourne ever get the Olympics ?

For these answers, plus Pi to 800 places, tune in next time for

Rocket Roger Goes Alien Smashing !!

P.S Those of you who noticed the sudden absence of Roger's press ganging
    into being a missionary......Don't be so picky, I'm on a tight schedule.

============================================================================
                                 Episode Ten
============================================================================
In our last exciting episode, Roger had nobly extricated himself and his
little sidekick, the brave but reeking Chadwick out of the stickiest
situation since Sticky the Stick Insect got stuck on a sticky bun.(Thanks
Ben Elton)  What will happen this episode. . . Let's find out.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Roger swung lazily in the jerry rigged hammock he set up.  One end was tied
to an anonymous steel ring in the wall, the other was tied around Chadwick's
neck.

"You know Chad, I'm looking forward to the end of this stupid adventure."
"Why's that, your Colonelship.  Are you tiring of the endless violence, the
 pointless waste of life; do you desire the more noble pursuits of the human
 soul such as art, dance, sculp....."
"What are you babbling about, Chadwick," said Roger sitting upright and
 nearly breaking Chadwick's neck," I couldn't give a toss for that crap, and
 I love mindless violence as long as I'm dishing it out.  I'll tell you what
 really riles me.  We've been trekking across the bloody Solar System for 3
 weeks now, and  we still haven't seen a woman !! I mean, this so called
 witty, humorous, madcap serial is meant to be a parody of Z-Grade sci-fi
 movies, right ?  So where's the women ?  Where are the scantily clad
 Martian princesses with four breasts ?  Where are the Barbarella clones
 with hopelessly impractical but very revealing bikini space-suits ?

 "Oi you ! So-called author !!"
 "UH....YES, ROGER ?"
 "I want to see some women in this episode, preferably without a lot on !"
 "UM, OK ROGER I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO."
 "Good....and no ugly ones.....keep 'em slim.....find a sheep for Chad too"
 "MUMBLE MUMBLE BLOODY EGO-TRIP OFFICERS MUMBLE MUMBLE HORNY BASTARD...."

 The Divine Dragster continued it's headlong plunge towards Harpo, one of
 the many Defence Stations in Lunar orbit.  Harpo was so-called because it's
 radio was always on the blink so it never said anything.  Groucho and Chico
 were really popular, but no-one ever saw Zeppo, and the less said about
 Karl the better.

 The docking proceeded without fuss or funny, but the music was annoying
 since everyone hated the harp.  Upon disembarking there were two gorillas
 in uniform waiting for them, carrying viciously lethal looking M99
 MegaDeath Plumbium Cannons (They'll fill ya full of lead) (Chemistry/Latin
 joke.)
 "Come with.....us." they mumbled, checking little papers in their hands to
 make sure they had the words right.

 Roger and Chadwick bade farewell to another expendable character: Brother
 Niki Lauda.  An ill-conceived, hastily thrown together and badly scripted
 character but still a friend, and a great platform for German jokes.

 The two Neanderthal guards led our heroes to a small electric car, which,
 at the breakneck speed of three miles an hour took them to a small white
 room.  "Wait here." said the more talkative of the guards.

 Roger and Chad sat patiently for a few minutes, until the door shwooshed
 open (Swooshed ?) and a familiar figure whizzed in.

 "So, you slack son of a five-legged mule.  You couldn't handle a simple
  case of alien infestation, so you opened a can of inspiration and rushed
  home to Doc Juliff."
 It was, of course Dr Frankenstein Juliff, loopy and nutty but completely
 clever inventor of Modular Gadgets the likes of which had never been seen.
 He had given Roger the modular four foot long imitation M99 Death Cannon
 which with a few simple twists become a highly useful pencil.  (More astute
 readers may have noticed the strange disappearance of this item after
 episode five)

 "Well Rog, me old son, me old cobber, me old china, me...old....MATE !"
 The force of the last word shocked Roger into speech....
 "Um....yes....Good morning Doctor.....err.."
 "I can see you're all choked to the nines with gratitude at the usefulness
  of my incredible modular pencil.  But you'll need something stronger than
  that for the next few episodes.  These aliens aren't kidding around
  anymore, nosireebob'syourunclecametostayforeverandadayandwhenhewentaway
  weallwroteaplay WHOOP !!  Sorry Rog, my wording module is being passed
  incredible amounts of tramp data.  Just a little logic error, easily fixed
  noworrieswhatsoeveratallnothingtofeareverythingsundercontrolitsfinenearly
  gotit.....WHOOP !!  Ah, jeez, that's better.
  We've finally managed to get a picture of the aliens, and they're uglier
  than a Joan Kirner look alike competition.  We lost a good man getting
  this picture, so memorize it well, you'll have a test on it before you go.
  We might even add up the scores right, too" (Another in-joke, sorry)

  Roger carefully examined the picture.  The evil curve of the huge talons.
  . .  the piercing black pools in it's eyes. . . the scaly blue feathers. .
  .  and the really cute way it fluffs up its head feathers... ?!?!?!?! This
  was no ordinary alien, it was one of the most evil, sadistic, merciless
  mutant BUDGIES the Universe had ever known !!

  Every inch of six feet tall, and all called Joey, these horrible creatures
  came into being through a freak accident involving uranium, plutonium,
  germaniums (the pink ones), a cranium, a trapezium and 8 little blue
  budgies in a terrarium.  Nothing had been heard since the plague of Joeys
  had carried Tasmania off to the depths of space.  They were back in force
  now, and on the Dark Side of The Moon......The Earth Seemed Doomed.....

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Will the plague of Joeys overwhelm Roger ?
    Will a girl show up for Roger to get ?
      Will the people in the computer center crack down on this rubbish ?
        Will this story get any more unbelievable ?

                               Episode Eleven
============================================================================
In last weeks heart-stopping instalment, Dr Franky 'My beard's bigger than
yours' Juliff revealed to Roger the true nature of the alien menace, now
residing at 24, Dark Side of the Moon Street, The Moon.  Mutant budgerigars,
six feet tall and bent on Universal Domination and all called Joey, no less.
How will Roger handle this....read on...
+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|

"Gasp !!" gasped Roger, gasping.
"Gosh, Roger, " goshed Chadwick, Roger's little sidekick/buddy/insect
zapper, "This is going to be harder than I thought.  Nothing short of a
thermonuclear MegaBlastaBomba can even tickle a Joey.  How are we going to
beat them, your Heroship...sir."
"Well Chadwick, we'll just..uh.....no we won't....we'll....uh...erm....Why
do I always have to make these decisions ?  Surely the leaders of the world
and top scientists and people like that wouldn't just let an incredibly
handsome yet sensitive but rugged hero like me come up with all the ideas !
What about you, Doctor Juliff, got any ideas about Joey Extermination ?"

"Sure as whale shit sinks I do, Rog-baby.  Just 'ave a butcher's at this
little lot."
He gestured towards a scrap merchant's delight piled high in the next room.
Peering through the window, Roger asked what it was and what possible use
half a ton of scrap metal would have in fighting creatures that ate M-756
Battle Tanks for breakfast.

"Well, Roger, you know how budgies love their own reflections, yes ?  Well,
 Joeys are no different.  So we'll just polish that lot up, build a mirror,
 stick a pilot on it and presto, no more Joeys."
"No more Joeys ?" piped up Chadwick.
"Yeah, we'll just fly her into the Sun. No fuss, no mess, no bother !"
"No pilot." added Roger sarcastically, cocking his eyebrows at the Doctor.
"Oh yeah....we didn't think of that.  Well we really need a pilot or the
 Joeys will break the mirror and we'll get thrashed again."
There was a short, embarrassing silence, the kind you get when you're
typically about half way through a date, and run out of weather to talk
about.  Doctor Juliff started again.
"Look, sod that for now, let's get it working first before we worry about
 niggly details like an agonising broiling death while spinning Sunwards.
 You must understand that you can't fly this mirror to the Joeys' base,
 their radar is amazingly sensisitive.  You'll have to take it through the
 Lunar sewers, which by an incredible coincidence were just linked in to the
 alien base yesterday.  Even alien invaders have to pay rates, y'know."

"How do I carry half a ton of scrap metal through sewers, and where in the
 name of Skilbey did you find it anyway.  Lunar freight haul costs a mint !"
"Glad you asked, Rog.  We had this VAX on the base for database purposes.
 Well by an unfortunate coincidence we all tried to run INGRES at the same
 time.  Poor thing didn't stand a chance ! Just blew itself to Kingdom Come!
 As for transport....Through the Wonders Of Modules.....by the Powers
 Invested In Me.....Abracadabra......Supercalifra(no, just kidding)....we
 are proud to present you with your NEW....MODULAR....CAR !! (Insert crappy
 game show noises)

Dr. Juliff pressed a large purple button a the scrap metal began to twist
and turn and leap about like a frog on speed.  In about a minute, where
there had been a worthless pile of scrap VAX there now stood a awkward,
stilted...well, words cannot sufficiently describe the essential WEIRDITY of
the thing.

Chadwick leaped up the air and began waving his arms about like a typical
brainless game show constestant.
"YYYYEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!" he bellowed with a grin you could lose a tractor
in, and he launched himself through the window and ran, still screaming in
ecstasy, and draped himself over one of the wheels.
"It's BEAUTIFUL !!! I LOVE IT !!! Is it really ours ?"
Doctor Juliff and Roger cautiously picked their way through the broken
glass, towards the strange vehicle.
"Yep, it's yours until you die, or you finish the mission, whichever comes
first." said the Doctor.
"I don't know how to drive this thing, Doctor and Chadwick couldn't drive a
nail into a 4 X 4."
"That's why you'll be provided with a driver.  She's also the story's token
bimbo, so don't expect discussions on Aristotelian philosophy, OK ?. . .
Aha, here she comes now."
From the other side of the room, a figure (and I mean a FIGURE !!)
voluptuously . . .well, walked isn't the word.  She sort of
slid/wobbled/glided over towards Roger.

"Hi Colonel," in a voice silky and smooth with a hint of condescension
('Only a Colonel ?') "I'm Mammary MacBimbo, your driver.  I hope you're
ready for this trip, it's going to be...bumpy."  Some of those words were
accented in a way that made Roger incredibly nervous.  He plucked up
courage, remembering he was the hero of this story, and incredibly sexy.
"Sure thing,  Miss Mac Bimbo.  Ready when you are, and then a couple more
 times after that too !"  This was obviously going to become disgustingly
biological.
"When do we leave, Doctor ?" asked Chadwick, noticing Roger's complete
fixation on Miss MacBimbo and her main redeeming features.
"Now Chadwick, we're fast running out of Moonbase jokes, and the gags coming
 up are festering quick so we'd better get to 'em fast."

Our gallant crew clambered into the Sewer-Mobile, and the western wall fell
away, revealing a deep dark passage that smelled only slightly better than
Chadwick on a warm day.
"Here goes Colonel, ready to take the plunge ?"
"Whenever you are, MacBimbo !"

She slapped it into third and floored it. ("Another woman driver." thought
Roger) The craft shot off into the darkness.  What horrible dangers would
they encounter in the terrible maze of Lunar sewers. (Clue: Green & eats
pizza) Find out (if you can't guess) in the next episode !!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Will the Joeys respond to the mirror treatment ?
  Will MacBimbo affect Rogers judgement, or just his libido ?
    Will Rocket Roger get more readers than that Toxic Custard crap ?
      (YES,YES!)

Tune in next episode for another thrilling instalment of Rocket Roger !!!

============================================================================
                               Episode Twelve
============================================================================
The Sewer-Mobile sped on through the labyrinth of grey tunnels that made up 
Lunar City's sewer system.  The threat of Lunar Sewer rats, huge ferocious
and very rude, had been alleviated by strapping Chadwick to the bottom of
the vehicle, just above the water line.  God help him if a wave should
develop.  God help the rats too.  "How much longer will this take, MacBimbo ?"
asked Roger casually, trying to sound like he did this kind of stuff all the 
time.
"Not much longer, Colonel.  Sewers are dead boring and there's not many
jokes floating in this crap.  There is one concept we have to be careful of.
. .  and I think were just about to run into it. Look !"

She pointed ahead into the semi-darkness.  Roger could make out three...no
four blobs seemingly running towards them.  He signalled MacBimbo to stop
the Sewer-Mobile and unstrap Chadwick in case they needed to scare anyone
off.

The vehicle gradually halted, and Roger looked carefully at the shapes. . .
definitely humanoid. . .They had stopped running, though and seemed to be
trying to catch their breath...wheezing...coughing...spluttering.  Then they
started running again, along the concrete banks of the sewer channel.
"Come on dudes," Roger heard the lead one cry "like there's more non-
beaudacious and totally uncool sewer invaders coming to find our secret
hide-out !!"

"God, not again." said MacBimbo seemingly disgusted, "It's the Geriatric
Mutant Ninja Turtles."  Seeing Roger's confusion she continued.
"After the craze in the early 1990's died away and kids went nuts over the
Infant Hamster Assassin Squad instead, the Turtles were kicked out of their
luxury Hollywood Sewer. They tried some part time work, but there's not much
call for four underage mutants in any field.  So they came to the moon and
submitted themselves for medical experiments.  After those were finished
they moved into these sewers, and they've been here for seventy years.  No
matter what you do, just don't mention the Hamsters, OK ?  They can't stand
them."

The four Turtles had finally reached our heroes, and after catching their
breath, they spoke. (Wheezed, more like.)
"OK dudes, no funny moves, or we'll jump around making silly noises and
waving these dangerous toys about."
"Yeah....we're lean....mean....spleen ..."
"Green, dufus !!"
"Oh yeah, sorry dudes, my memory's not what it used to...er..oh yeah...be !"
Actually the sight of four geriatric amphibians with long green beards and
more wrinkles than a Hollywood Tribute didn't exactly terrify Roger.  But it
did worry Chadwick.
"Oh please Turtles, don't hurt us !!  We're only trying to save the Earth.
I hated the Infant Hamster Assassin Squad too !"

The turtles all looked at him and wrinkled their wide, flat, hairy noses.
"Whoa, little dude, what happened to you ?  Been swimming in the sewers ?"
"You must be real evil, I mean you're short, smelly, and all the other 'bad
guy' cliches in our cartoons.  I think Food-Processor and the Big Toe  Clan
sent you !!  Turtle Power !!"
As one, the four turtles surged...well...hobbled forwards and started
bashing the side of the Sewer-Mobile.  (Actually, wet celery would have
caused more damage than they did.)
"This is ridiculous !" yelled MacBimbo. "We're being assaulted by four
decrepit mutants ! " She started the Sewer-Mobile again, "One side, phlegm
features !" and the turtles were knocked aside as the Sewer-Mobile leapt
forward and continued it's harrowing journey.

Within minutes, they had stopped underneath a manhole.
"This is it, Colonel, the entrance to the Joey base.  Here, put on these
disguises." From a compartment she pulled out two "Acme Joey Disguise Kits:
Hours of fun for the whole family, until you get locked up !"
"Put these on, and the Joeys won't suspect a thing. . .Unless Chadwick
leaves his head facing backwards; fix it, halfwit !"  Chadwick corrected the
cranial orientation problem, and asked Roger "Squawk, tweet, tweet, squawk,
Who'sanaughtyboy, then."
"Automatic Joey Translation unit." explained MacBimbo.  "Now get going !"
Roger took his head off, (so to speak) and asked how they were meant to
carry a half ton car around inconspicuously.
"No problems, Colonel.  Watch this."

She pressed a small button on the side of the car.  An almost inaudible hum
filled the air and the car slowly began to shrink, and shrink, and shrink.
When it was matchbox sized, MacBimbo picked it up and gave it to Roger.
"You now have half an hour before it expands into its mirror configuration,
which, being two hundred meters wide will be a little uncomfortable if it's
still in your pocket.  Try not to let that happen, it's ve.."
"Thanks for your concern, Mammary, I'll remember you in my dreams." drawled
Roger, suavely.
"Very expensive !" continued MacBimbo, annoyed.
"Oh....right..." blushed Roger, quickly taking the shrunken mirror.
Chadwick was already half way up the ladder, and Roger followed him.
Mammary MacBimbo watched them go, and as the manhole cover fell back into
place, she turned to face the reader/camera.  She pulled a small black box
out of her uniform.  "They have just entered sector 12, I'm continuing
observation."

From the top of her head, a small rip appeared, and spread down through her
torso.  Inside, amidst the folds of uniform and synthetic skin, could be
seen...  blue feathers !!  The disguise fell into the filthy sewer, and in
MacBimbo's place stood...A Joey !!  Cackling and squawking, the evil
impostor climbed the ladder into the base, with murder on her mind.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What will MacJoey do to Roger and Chadwick ?
  Has MacJoey sabotaged the mirror ?
    What will our heroes do ?

Tune in next episode for the next thrilling instalment of

Rocket Roger of the Space-O-Navy !!

============================================================================
                              Episode Thirteen
============================================================================
In our last episode, Roger and Chadwick had infiltrated the Joey base.
Unbeknownst (ancient word of the week) to them, their driver, Mammary
MacBimbo, is actually a Joey spy.  She followed them into the base, and
will almost certainly be mean and nasty to them.  Just to make things
really bad, Roger only has half an hour to deploy the Joey-Killing Mirror
before it expands and kills him.  How will Roger get out of this one ?
Read on and find out . . .
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Roger and Chadwick cautiously climbed through the manhole and looked around
and the Joey base.  It was just what you'd expect to see in a lair of
40,000 mutant six foot budgerigars on the moon. (If anyone knows what that
is, exactly, please write and tell me, then submit yourself for psychiatric
treatment.)

The whole place was made up of twenty foot high cages, with cute little
sliding doors and lined with old newspapers.  There were thousands of them,
stacked high, suspended on huge tree like structures.  Noticeably absent
were the usual paraphernalia associated with budgies, such as mirrors,
ladders, bells, and little plastic framed balls.  Roger recalled an article
during the first Joey plague explaining the Joey's abhorrence of these
items, as they brought out the primitive budgie instincts in them. i.e
Ringing bells, climb ladders to nowhere and throwing balls up in the air
and letting them smash their skulls in.  The modern Joey avoided these
items at all costs. (Remember that.  It's important later on.)

Of course, there were the Joeys themselves, seemingly very busy, flying
between various cages intended for purposes unknown to our heroes.  Many
carried metal objects, others lifted giant coconuts between them, gripping
them by the husks. The overall picture was one of industry working at full
tilt for the destruction of the Earth, with all the Joeys single-mindedly
applying themselves. . . all save one: MacJoey, the impostor that had
followed Roger and Chadwick into the base.  She now stood about thirty
meters behind Roger and Chadwick, slowly advancing towards them.  "Look out
Roger !" came a chorus of children's voices.

Roger turned, but MacJoey had quickly hidden behind an anonymous structure.
"What is it, children ?  Is the evil Joey behind me ?" The Joey started to
overact her way towards Roger. . . "Yes Roger, she's behind you !!" Roger
whirled around, but the Joey had moved again. . .
"Where, children ? I can't see her !! Are you sure she's here ?"
"Yes ! Yes ! She's behind the anti-plasmoid shield converter !"
"Of course...the old 'hiding behind the anti-plasmoid shield converter'
 trick !  Come out, you evil old bird, you've got Rocket Roger to deal with
 now !"

MacJoey slowly emerged from her hiding place, and grinned evilly at Roger.
"So, you knew I was a Joey agent all the time.  Before I rip your head off,
you might as well deal out some more plot exposition.  How did you know ?"
"It was quite easy, actually.  When you so callously ran over the Geriatric
Mutant Ninja Turtles, I wondered how anyone trained by the Navy could be so
cruel and unfunny.  I then made a great leap of deduction and paranoia, and
sneaked a quick look at the next episode to make sure you were what I
suspected; a Joey agent !  So I'm ready for you now, do your worst !!"

MacJoey and Roger began to circle each other, each poised to strike...
"You won't be so chirpy after this, pal. "
"You're dealing with me now, feather brain...your goose is cooked."
"Well, I'm genetically engineered for combat; you're a dead duck !  Anyway,
 I've already told the authorities you're here !"
"So....a stool pigeon, huh ?" "Yep, and when they get here, you'll be caught
and tortured for information; then you'll sing like a bird !"
Roger stood up, and cast his best 'annoyed psychopath' look at MacJoey.
"Oh yeah...well, A rolling stone on the other foot is worth two gift
 horses. "
"Huh ?!!?" replied MacJoey, and looked around while trying to
figure out Roger's gift to English Literature.

"AHAHHAHA !" bellowed Roger as he leapt into action and planted his feet
square into MacJoey's capacious chest. She was flung backwards, and tripped
over Chadwick who was curled up on the floor in a well rehearsed manoeuvre.
Her neck smashed against a conveniently placed wall and she died instantly.
(I'm not one who believes in noble enemies getting off lightly with a mild
concussion.)
"Brilliantly done Chadwick, that's the first thing you've done
right in living memory.  What's your excuse ?"
"I was trying to make friends with a Lunar Grasshopper.  I nearly had it
convinced, but then that mean ol' bird hit my head and.."
"What's that thing hanging off your nose, Chadwick ?"
"That's the grasshopper, sir.  I don't like to put my nose where its not
wanted, and this is ridiculous !"

A loud flapping of wings drew Roger's attention to the dark sky. It was
accompanied by Physics screaming out that flight in a vacuum was impossible
without a power source, but was quickly shouted down by Artistic License.
After all, the sight of three hundred man sized birds flying through a
Lunar Twilight is more terrifying than three hundred man sized birds
flapping in place.

"Uh oh, let's get out of here fast !!" urged Roger. He leapt into the air
and began flapping his arms like a man whose armpits are on fire.  The
brilliant design of the suits incorporated a null-grav device accompanied
by a small...er...why am I explaining this to you.  Look, he can fly OK ?
The two impostor budgies flew high over the alien base.  Fighting back the
urge to panic hysterically, Roger looked around, and noticed an flat, open
area.  Perfect !  He banked and headed for it, closely followed by Chadwick,
and a horde of Joeys.  The horde grew larger as the squawk got around that
infiltrators had...well, infiltrated the base. Roger touched down, and
Chadwick crashed in a heap.

"Quickly Roger, by an amazing coincidence, there's only twenty seconds left
until the mirror unfolds !"
"Right, little buddy, start running !  Head for that big red 'X' on the
ground." Roger dropped the little device, and started running from the ...
what do you call a group of mutant six foot budgerigars ? Roger ran as fast
as he could, passed Chadwick, and tripped him up to make time.  Lucky for
him, the Joey's avoided anything that smelly....
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Will the mirror unfold in time ?
   Will the author find a suitable ending for this story ?
     Will another story be forthcoming after this one ?

Find out in the next thrilling episode of Rocket Roger !!!

============================================================================
                              Episode Fourteen
============================================================================
In our last episode, Roger was running for his life from a flock of mutant
budgerigars (Joeys) on their base on the moon.  He had just dropped a device
which would expand into a two hundred meter mirror, which should mesmerize
the Joeys with their own reflections.  But the Joeys are getting pretty
close.....
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roger stopped at the marking on the ground, and read the little sign.
"Minimum safe distance for expansion of two hundred meter mirror and also
for being chased by group of evil mutant Joeys"
"5....4....3.....2....1...NOW !!"

As it happens, one of the birds nearly got a wingtip to Roger before a
deafening roar filled the air.  Picture the following scene, if you can.

A glistening, awe-inspiring structure polished like the sun, two hundred
meters high.  In front of it, sitting quietly on the ground are 40,000 six
foot budgerigars, all mesmerized by their own reflections.  Behind it are
two figures, climbing a ladder to a small cabin in the centre of the
structure.  They enter it, and the click of the door sealing are the only
noises to disturb the immaculate silence, until the Joeys start to murmur to
themselves, trying to provoke a response from their reflections.  The mirror
silently lifted from the alien base, followed by the helpless Joeys.

"Now what do we do, Colonel ?  We can't just land at a zoo and say 'Hey
we've got 40,000 mutant birds to spare; do you want a couple...'"
"Simple....we fly 'em into the sun, like the Doctor said."
"But won't that get a little hot for us too ?"
"Yeah...but like any macho Hollwood-Type hero, I'll bother about that when
 we get there....Jeez, don't look out the window; you'll drop your guts !!"

The sight was something to behold...and then regret beholding.  A copious
amount of the most fearsome avian mutation seen, since Big Bird caught
Rabies and ripped eighteen toddlers apart on Sesame Street.
"The computer says they're gaining on us, they'll start hitting the mirror
in about 7 hours at this rate."
"Seven hours...that's way too long.  The readers can't wait that long.
Quick, invent a plot device that'll get us to the Sun in about four lines."
"Aha, Colonel...what about this button that's just been thought of, marked
 'Press here to get to the Sun in a hurry.'"

"I expect it'll get our asses out of this frying pan and into one Mother of
 a fire !" remarked Roger as he pushed the button, which promptly vanished.

It was suddenly very hot, which led Roger to brilliantly deduce they were
somewhere near ...wait for it...The Sun.  Great !! Sort of....
Looking out of the window, Roger saw the fearsome beaks of the hardy Joeys
nudging forwards faster and faster.  Within seconds, they were upon the
mirror, chattering away to their reflections and pecking like fury.

"Buffalo Balls !!! We're dog-meat !!" cried Roger "She's breaking up !!" The
 whole cockpit was shaking and buffeting, and our heroes began to pray for
 another brilliant plot twist to 'Please get us the Hell out of this...'

Chadwick was flung out of his box, striking a massive red button marked
'Eject Cockpit and send it back to Earth to a hero's welcome.'

A final blast of power, and the cockpit was still, drifting slowly back to
Earth.  Chadwick and Roger struggled to their feet and looked outside.  The
mirror had begun to crack up and rifts began to appear in its immaculate
surface.  The Joeys began to snap out of their entranced condition, but
found themselves helpless.  Unlike on the Moon, where Physics took a
backseat to Artistic License and let the Joeys fly in a vacuum, being this
close to a major astrophysical body made things different.

The Joeys continued their inexorable drift towards the Sun, which suited
Artistic License just fine, because they all got roasted as they meandered
through a lovely hyperbolic orbit.  By an incredible coincidence, about
three months later, 40,000 beautifully cooked birds the size of ostriches
plummetted to the Earth in famine stricken Asia, thus saving millions of
lives and annoying the Hell out of Bob Geldof, who had a little single all
ready for release.

              INSERT "TIME GOES BY" MUSIC HERE

Roger and Chadwick lay by the pool at the Everest Hilton, sipping enormous
cocktails, munching on the rave new delicacy: Solar-Cooked Joey.
"We did a brilliant job, Chad...especially me."
"Yes sir, Colonel sir, absolutely amazing."
"We really deserve this break after our harrowing adventure...I wonder
what'll happen next week."
"Nothing, sir.  The writer's buggered off for a holiday, nothing's going to
 happen till he gets back."
"Right then, I guess we'll just wait around here till he does.  Waiter !!
 Another three of these, please !"
================================================================================
                            Episode One
================================================================================
Roger and Chadwick lazed by the pool like real experts, almost Student rank.
Roger, resplendent in his silver and purple Agency Speedos, packed with all
sorts of extras, including a 300 hp outboard engine that turned on when it
contacted water.  Not really designed for use in a hotel swimming pool,
reflected Roger.  Well the wounds had almost healed, and they even recovered
his ears from next door.  Chadwick was 'wearing' an orange floral shower cap,
but the things in his hair had eaten away most of it.  His swimming costume
was something brown, sort of on him, and sort of not.

They'd been there for about three months now, and were thinking of trying the
sauna next.  Chadwick's repeated uses of the swimming pool had actually
resulted in some measure of cleanliness coming to our heroically rounded
sidekick, and after the water had been drained, scrubbed, filtered and
replaced, they let him back in.  He had broken out in a very unpleasant
rash, being allergic to 'clean.'

"I wonder when the chief will call us again Chadwick, my faithful, loyal yet
amazingly backwards sidekick with the fashion sense of a cross-dressing toad."
"I don't know, sir.  I thought saving the Earth once was good enough.  I mean
how likely is that two perilous inter-planetary threats will come along within
3 months ?"

A quick backhand to the head from Roger put an end to such rebellious
thoughts.  "Do you want to put the author out of business ?  I mean its
obvious he can't write anything serious."
Roger looked around nervously.
"...er...Chadwick, do you recall the swimming pool being 30 feet underground."

The pool, deck and expensive cocktail bar now formed the bottom of a thirty
foot hole, and it was still dropping.
"Good Lord, I think we're in the Thunderbird's set !"
"Wasn't that just a kids show, sir ?" quipped Chadwick.
"That was just a cunning ploy to fool the enemy on Saturday mornings, it was a
real as I am."
So saying, Roger stood up and did his best 'puppet with big head wobbles 4
inches to stage left.'  Chadwick did the same, but put his feet through his
sunbed.
"Well Chad," wobbled Roger and his head,"I feel a mission coming on, and I
don't think that sunbed would make a good Thunderbird 7....maybe Thunderbird
0.003.  It won't really strike raw terror into the heart of the enemy if we
launched Thunderbird 'Sunbed' at them, would it.  What sort of range
do you get out of it ?  Not a whole lot, I imagine."  Roger continued in this
vein for a while, complaining about the cargo space, offensive ordnance
capability, and navigation equipment.

At the same time, on a planet somewhere in the Horsehead Nebula's left
nostril, a strange meeting was taking place.
"Nytuk blug.  Olpons nytuk Frettled Gruntbuggly."
"Gruntbuggly ? Vok!!! Colpuscent whingburgeons reft wolkonk."
"Wolkonk ?  Vok !!! Fewturn polknit sewluft zed...Gluubulon."
"Gluubulon ? Vok !!! Julivonwi kowkxerd folnicker Bumrod."

Whoops ! Wrong planet, that's just an interplanetary remake of Black Adder
III. (in joke, sorry.) Just retune the Mega Radio Subetha Highly Dubious
Scientific Apparatus.  This is something like that bit in Total Recall where
the President of Mars has a live vidphone conversation with two guys on
Earth, ignoring the fact that light takes nearly three minutes to get from one
to the other....maybe they just bribed God, or something.  Back to the
story....

In a dark corner of the Imperial Palace on the planet Plagiar IV two shadowy
figures meet in the darkness.
"Turn on the light, I can't see a bloody thing !"
"Quertz ? Ut mikt freeb blee diky doo."
 Translation: "What, I don't speak English."
"I don't wish to know that.  Here, stick this pickle in your ear.  It'll
 translate everything for you.  No don't worry, that other guy wrote about a
 fish or something, this is a Babbling Pickle.  We're not plagiarizing anyone
 !  It won't stand up in court ! Go on, I DARE you to sue me !!"

SMACK !! (That was the sound of the author's conscience
getting thumped out.)

"Now look, this planet is really running low on greenhouse gases, we need some
 more CFC's and carbon dioxide.  Now take a look at this chart of atmospheric
 readings from a little planet called Dirt...Earth, sorry.  They've got
 buckets of it !  All we need, according to this guidebook are some 'Greedy
 bastard trillionare industrialist environment rapers.'  Our intergalactic
 Kmart ran out last year.  I think this little planet bought the lot.  So
 we'll go and borrow a few.  And thats set the plot, did you get that ?
 Questions ?  Yes ?

Reader:  Why are these aliens crossing untold light years
         to capture a short lived sociological phenomenon ?
Alien :  ZZZAAAAAPPPP !!! KABBOOOOOMMM!!

Severely:  Since nothing can travel faster than light, how will
Wounded    they get here before we've...
Reader

Alien:   ZZZAAAAAPPPP !!! KAABBOOOMMMM !!
         Don't ask silly questions.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Will the hideous Aliens break every scientific law in Creation ?
   Will they kidnap our trillionare industrialist Bastards Inc. ?
     Will the author be accused of plagiarizing Planet Plagiar ?

Tune in next week for another thrill packed episode:

Rocket Roger Starts Another Highly Improbable Mission !!
===============================================================================
                         Episode Two
===============================================================================
You will recall, dear readers (both of you) that Roger and Chadwick were 
wondering why the swimming pool was now thirty feet underground.  Roger thought
another mission was in the offing. (What's an offing ?)
------------------------------------------------------------------
As Roger and Chadwick argued about the military value of a sunbed, a door
opened in the side of the pool-sized hole.  Enter Juliff, Doctor, one of.  A
crazed inventor, quickly revived from the last series, because no-one is
funnier.  A blur of hair and modules flung itself towards Roger, spinning
phrases as it went.  "A module must have one exit point.  Declare those
variables !!  Cobol isn't too bad, really.  Isn't structured programming
wonderful !"

Roger watched in silence, this episode was getting ridiculous.  The blur
pulled up in front of our hero, and Chadwick clung coweringly to Roger's leg.
"G'day Modular Cobber !  There's two birds in the horses mouth and angels
 tread where the fool is on the hill, mi-laddo."
"Um...Doctor Juliff, I think your modular beard is on backwards."
The doctor's modular eyes detached and spun around his head.
"Oh yeah, so it is.  OK, just redirect this tail-pointer, de-reference this
 fiddly bit here and Pawn to King four."
"OK, close enough.  What am I doing thirty feet under where the swimming pool
 once was ?"

"This is our latest invention, the Modular Hotel/Secret Hideout."
"That's pathetic." sighed Roger, "Why build something secret in a six thousand
 room hotel ?"
The Doctor frowned, but not so you'd notice, since he keeps mixing his
forehead up with his left buttock.  "Don't question your superiors, bucko-my-
lad." It was conveniently left over from the Thunderbirds, so we bought it."
"Won't someone notice the pool doubles as an elevator to nowhere?"
"No worries me old china, we cunningly replace it with a hologrammatic, eighty
 million dollar virtual reality pool."
"Why not just....oh what's the bloody use....why am I here, Doc ?"

"We've received warning that some sap of an author is writing about another
 invasion, and we're sending you to save our sanity by trying to convince this
 nut to write something nice for a change."
Chadwick, scratching his rash caused by his allergy to cleanliness
asked "Where are you sending us this time, Doctor."

"It's a little planet inside the Horsehead Nebula's left nostril called the
 planet Plagiar.  A bloody awful place, not modular at all and apparently
 pretty dark all the time.  Something to do with living up a horse's nose I
 suppose.  The evil despicable aliens are planning to invade and kidnap our
 top trillionare industrialists so they can have their planet's climate
 completely stuffed up by experts."
"Is that such a problem ?" queried Roger.
"Of course it is !! You don't think global warming just HAPPENS do you ?  We
 planned that for decades, it'll do incredible things for the tourist
 industry.  We'll be able to build luxury resorts in the tropics of Greenland
 one day.  These aliens are a threat, they're disrupting our plans.  Stop
 them, Roger and the tourist industry, hat makers and sunscreen producers will
 be eternally grateful."

"I can't wait." quipped Roger, enthusiastic as Aaron Goldstein in Baghdad.
"Well, at least I know I'll get some lovely hi-tech weapons of mass
 destruction; where are they, Doc ?"
"Bad news, Roggy-Babes.  We sent all that stuff to Persia VI, to help fight
 Sodd'em Whosux.  Sorry, all we can offer is this ham on rye with extra mayo
 and pickle."
"Will it explode, killing all within a 50 foot radius when the pickle is
 depressed (or just homesick) ?"
"Er...no, not as such..."
"Oh, um...will it deliver a radar guided anti-anything missile to within 5
 microns of its target ?"
"No not really, that's not in the specs."
"What's it for then ?" demanded Roger.
"It's in case you get hungry !" answered the indignant Doctor

Roger rested his weary head in his hand and held back the tears while
Chadwick's scratching was getting really obscene.
"Right, lets get out of here, before I go bananas.  Doc, where's
 the transport ?"
"You're standing on it, Rog !  Watch this !"

So saying, the Doctor, whose passion for pushing buttons had got him into
trouble many a time, pressed yet another and the ground began to tremble.  A
steel sphere began to rise from around the perimeter of the pool, quickly
enclosing it, like a steel water balloon.  By now, the Doctor was dancing
about the place, chanting something about the fuel supply.  The sunbeds, still
scattered around the pool began to move towards the sphere and started
attaching themselves in a sort of spaceship shape around the strange sphere.
The poolside bar, diving board, kiddie pool, changing rooms, four blocked
toilets and three medium sized turds also melded into the strange craft
forming before their eyes.  When they finished, the ship began buzzing, and a
fuzzy outline surrounded the ship, crackling intermittently.

"Just clamber in, Rog-Babe and we'll move the whole base to the secret island
 launch site." mumbled the Doctor.  Roger stared at the ship, then the Doctor.
"What in the name of my overstuffed underwear is that contraption ?!?! I'm not
 getting in that, over my unconcious yet still alive body.....oh no why did I
 say that ?"  ****THWACK!!**** ***CRUMP*** (crump ?! By god, who wrote this ?)
 (I did.) (Oh yeah, sorry.)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Will Roger take this dangerous and badly defined mission ?
   Will the author sort out the plot soon ?
      Will Chadwick say anything again ?

Tune in to the next rivetting Rocket Roger episode ....

Up In Orbit, Up The Spout OR How Not To Use A Zero-G Toilet

=============
Episode Three
=============
Roger and Chadwick have been conned into another mission, to stop our best
non-biodegradeable industrialists being kidnapped by the evil, slimy etc.
aliens.  They have just been shoved into a spaceship made from
sunbeds/deckchairs and most of the items found around a hotel swimming pool,
and are obviously worried, since sunbeds are not widely renowned for being
spaceworthy.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger and Chadwick awoke to find themselves strapped in to the seats of the
Sunbed Spaceship, which could have been anywhere since it was made of chairs.
The noise of the force field holding in the air supply was strangely quiet
inside and the whole outside world looked crazed and distorted through the
shimmering haze.  Roger looked over to see if Chadwick was safely strapped
in...  damn...he was, and still unconcious...the lazy bugger.

"OK, Chad here we go; another secret and highly hidden launch site comes into
operation."  This ship began to shake and rumble.
"We're probably in Tierra Del Fuego," The strange craft lifted above the
launch umbrella, "or a remote Pacific Island, or maybe even...." The ship
cleared the launching pit and spread out below them was the little known
island of "...Manhattan !  Great ! I'm sure no-one will notice eight thousand
deckchairs being flung skywards from Central Park ! Or what's left of it when
they put the fires out."  Talking to himself was the only way Roger could
be sure of intelligent conversation.

The poolside bar had converted into a control console with lots of lights and
buttons, but every time Roger pushed something it told him to sod off.
"Where are we going ?" typed Roger into the computer.
"Queueing query into queue." replied the computer.
"Bloody AI computers, I don't know why we bother." mumbled Roger.

Since the advent of true AI computers a century ago, the computers had
redesigned themselves past human understanding.  They always seemed to be
asking for weird things to be put into their circuitry: hamsters, pictures of
Harley Davidsons, Penthouse magazines, joke books and Eric Clapton boxed sets.
A clerk once suggested they were breeding horny hamsters with quick finger
work, a rebel mentality and a great sense of humor, but not in a very loud
voice.  When such a hamster turned up inside a Cray 42, the clerk was made
Head of IBM, and the hamster wowed 'em in Vegas for years.

Otherwise, the computers spent all their time on IGRC (Inter-Galactic Relay
Chat), only answering questions when they felt like slumming it.Roger prefered
a healthy slave complex in his computers.  The technician in his soul decided
on a course of highly delicate, precise and fragile reprogamming, involving
ripping out anything red.  He opened a panel, looked at all the hamsters
inside, and decided discretion was the better part of finishing this mission.

The computer alerted him that the docking with Al-Hussein Orbital Prayer Mat
would take place in two minutes.  The USA's space program could barely afford
to launch a matchbox, and when all the satellites ran out of Duracells, the
reconaissance photos stopped coming in, the Americans bombed Nebraska instead
and promptly got invaded by the enemy.  Saddam Hussein had a strange penchant
for naming things after himself, and when the United States of 'Snazzy Green
Uniforms and Kissing The Bosses Shoulders' (as the conquered country was now
called) finally scraped enough dinars together, they launched the Al-Hussein
Orbiting Prayer Mat.  Planned to be the size of Mecca, due to budget
restrictions it was now about the size of a phone box.  In fact, that's all it
eventually was used for: a phone.  However, Hussein liked it until the day he
tested the new Hussein Space shaver.  It snagged his moustache, ripped it
off and he promptly died of embarassment.

The docking seal slowly opened and Roger drifted silently into the murky
blackness.  He felt around the walls, and found a switch.  Turning it on
revealed that phone box vandals would go anywhere in the universe to find an
untouched booth.  The receiver had been remolded into something definitely not
used for talking, and someone called 'Mozzy' obviously liked 'Shazza' and had
drawn appropriate diagrams, which Roger made a mental note of.  A small
note was attached to the ceiling with chewing gum, saying "Go to Marz bass if
youz wanna sav thu wurld."  It was signed by someone called Bonk Mee. "Oh no,"
thought Roger "the heavy metal bands are coming back."

Over two centuries ago, heavy metal had been declared a load of festering
yak's bollocks and a danger to the ozone layer, both through the music and the
ridiculous amounts of hair spray needed to maintain the hairdo.  Since so many
bands sang about Mars and its warlords and aliens they were all sent there to
find out what it was really like.  Every now and then, a tape would come back
with songs like "It's F'kin Cold" "Lots and Lots of Little Red Rocks" "I See
Red" (Split Enz joke) "Mars Sucks Big Nob."  They were clearly still alive;
Phobos was cracking up due to sound waves in the 'Zepplin' range, but
obviously the technology to build eighty thousand watt speakers was nothing
compared to building an interplanetary hopper.  "Right, lets go save the world
then."

Roger turned to leave and was immediately confronted by a hideous sight.....a
ghettoblaster....drifting just outside the box....a big one.  It must have
been hiding behind the phone box.  The ghettoblaster was the most feared sonic
weapon in the heavy metal arsenal, and they sure knew about sonic weapons.
Many unscrupulous governments, sick of seeing the poor and starving people of
the ghettoes solved the problem with these hideous machines: ghettoblasters.
I think you can work out the effects.  Its detonator would surely be burning
through, and about to inflict some horrible screaming and wailing noise on
him.  Roger flung himself into his ship just as the throbbing bass notes
started.  Or should have started.  The Martian exiles were also notoriously
bad at science, forgetting that sound can't travel through space.  Someone
hadn't told the phone box, though.  It was shaking visibly and bits were
falling off.

"Typical Telecom construction....let's go." he told the ship.
No response, not even a snide remark about room temperature IQ's.  This meant
trouble, the ghettoblaster was drifting closer to the ship.  Chadwick began to
stir. "Huh ? Wassup ? What should I wear today, Mum ?"  The ship began to
tremble; the way ships do when confronted by 300 decibels of wailing guitars,
throbbing bass, eighty piece drumkits and screaming juvenile delinquents.
Roger quickly came up with a brilliant plan: Run Away !  He was already
half way into the escape sunbed when Chadwick began to roll down
the side window.....
------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is Chadwick rolling down the window ?
   How will the author talk his way out of this one ?
      Will the ghettoblaster rock'n'roll our heroes to oblivion ?

Tune in next week for the next mindbending episode....

Wow ! That one Shook the Floor !  OR  How To Make Friends And

==============
Episode Four
==============
Chadwick and Colonel Rogerson were in trouble. (What an original way to start
an episode !) A lethal ghettoblaster loaded with Heavy Metal Mass Destruction
was drifting closer to their ship, which wouldn't move for some unexplained
reason.  Roger was bravely running away, but Chadwick in an uncharacteristic
display of bravado, brains and brilliance had rolled down the side window.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the window opened a fierce gale blew up inside the ship.  It obviously
wouldn't last long, approximately four seconds till the air ran out.  A dozen
alarms started buzzing, the cabin turned a deathly shade of red.  The sunbeds
all began rattling against each other, not designed to stand this pressure and
in one horrifyingly smooth action, blasted away from each other, leaving our
shocked heroes drifting in vacuum.....SSSPPPLLLAAAATTTT !!!!!  Deadsville.

Roger's Echoing Voice (This is his dead soul talking...Go figure.)
     Oh !! Good One ! Brilliant writing !! Eminently wonderful
     plot development !!  There'll be prizes galore for this one,
     killing off the heroes after four episodes !

Mad Scribe:
     But....ermmm....Chadwick opened the window.  I mean....that
     usually blows up space ships...doesn't it ?

Roger:
     Well yes, but you've just finished off your own story before
     it started !  We just got going with what passes for a plot,
     a few potentially good opportunities for dashing about,
     picking up women and generally being heroes.....and you just
     killed us !!

Mad Scribe:
     Er...ok Rog, s-sorry .. Colonel Rog .uh.. R-Rogerson, I'll
     fix it.

Chadwick ignored the clanging of the alarms, dropped his pants and stuck his
arse out the window.  What followed, we can only surmise, but from the look of
incredible relief on his face, a good guess would be that Chadwick has just
let off the Mother of All Farts.  The face of the ghettoblaster looked like it
was melting as it spun away from the ship blasting its ozone destroying music
to the heavens.  Another fate worse than Chadwick's breath has been skillfully
avoided. (By Chadwick's other breath, sort of...er...maybe not.)

At this point, I suppose I should explain why the ship held itself together
under such forces, why Chadwick's bum is not a lump of dirty ice, and why all
the air did not escape.  Because I said so, that's why !

The computer seemed to have got it's act together, the way faulty computers do
when a life threatening crisis has passed and set a course for Mars.  Roger
turned to Chadwick, and asked where he got a fart like that from.
"Oh Sorry, Colonel.  My tummy gets a bit upset when I wake up."
"That probably explains why Chad's house has it's own smog, and
reinforced walls." thought Roger to himself.

"Well, Chad.  How are we going to deal with the Heavy Metal Invasion ?  How
about plan 63B ? Chadwick !? What are you doing ?"
At the mention of the Invasion, Chad had plunged his finger deep into his
nose, where it was currently wiggling around.
"Sorry Colonel, but this seems to relax me whenever I get scared."
In fact, his finger was pressing on the fear center of his brain.  The touch
of Chadwick's finger was repulsive to anyone, even his own brain, so the fear
cells just shut down and took a bath.  Chadwick was so amazed when he first
found this out, he wrote to the Navy Admiralty, suggesting that all personnel
be required to keep one finger safe in a nostril during all combat.  The
admiralty replied that the sight of 12 000 men with fingers buried in any
orifice was hardly very likely to plunge fear into the hearts of the enemy.
They also sent him three stickers and a flag, the way all government
departments do, when trying to endear themselves to their more gullible
citizens.

Roger and Chadwick started preparing the ship for the hyper-transit.  This
involved pressing a button.  (Well, that killed two lines...)
A quick twinge in the pit of the stomach indicated that the ship had skipped
through the mysterious whorls of hyperspace, emerging near Mars, whose surface
was now home to every Heavy Metal band and devotee in the world: except two.
The two sitting behind the controls of the Marshall F'kin Beast of
Destruction, with its weapons trained dead on Roger.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Will the Marshall FBD let rip ?
   Will Roger be killed again, and will the author do anything ?
      What is the third inane question MadScribe will ask ?

To find out, tune in to the next thrilling episode:

Deadheads vs. Breadheads  OR  I'll Wrap This Chord Around Your
                                        F'kin Neck

============
Episode Five
============
At the shattering climax of our last episode, our heroes' ship was
being followed by a Marshall FBD from the Martian Heavy Metal
Colony.  It was bearing down fast, ready to unleash death at poor
unsuspecting Roger....scene switches to enemy ship.
------------------------------------------------------------------
"Oi Francis there's the f'kin bastard now !"
"How many times I gotta tell ya ? My f'kin name's not f'kin
 Francis, right ? It's Weasel Aniseed-Nigel Keymaster Elk Runner !
 (good acronym, huh ?) So just f'kin call me Weasel or I'll tell
 Shazza about Mrs. Palm and her five daughters, ya mongrel !"

Charles Darwin would have had serious doubts about his theory had
he seen these two.  Black imitation leather shoes tried to cling
to two toothpicks that passed for legs.  Tight jeans with tennis
balls shoved down the front, delicately slashed with a hyper-chainsaw.
A black t-shirt depicting some strange character doing something
unnatural, beautifully offset by a word.  The word, being the name
the 'musicians' went by was usually a disease or something
cheerfully demonic.  Intellectual groups sometimes used two words,
no-one used three since a bass player's head exploded trying to
think of three words without using "F'kin."  The bit above the
leather jacket told the whole story. (We'll call it a head, for
argument's sake.)  The face betrayed a mind free and untroubled by
thoughts or mental processes of any kind.  How it was
possible for millions of years of evolution to produce this.......

"Ok Slasher, press the button." said Weasel.
"Which f'kin button ?"
"Errrmmm.....try...errr." Weasel began counting the fingers on his
left hand. "Try button number little finger."
"What...this one ?" asked Slasher, pointing at a button with a
little finger painted on it.
"Yeah, f'kin why not ?" agreed Weasel.

As the button was pressed, the strange vessel shot rays of pure
sound through the cabin of Roger's ship.  The painful screams and
squeals of small animals filled Roger and Chadwick's heads, while
demonic guitars clashed throughout their skulls.  Thankfully, some
might say, they passed out quickly.

The Marshall FBD drifted over the unconcious heads of Roger and
Chadwick, lowered a grapple and began towing the plot towards
Mars, and an unknown fate.  (Well, I know the fate but you don't.)

Some hours later, Roger woke up.
"Wake up, Chad.  And don't fart again ! You haven't been asleep."
"Uhhh...I feel like my brain's been on a drinking spree without
 telling the rest of me..." mumbled Chadwick.
"Come on, we've got to study up on Heavy Metal culture or we won't
 be able to communicate with these weirdos."  urged Roger,
 punching the appropriate buttons on the console.  The buttons
 told him not to hit so hard as the computer began its discourse
 (in a heavy BBC accent) on Heavy Metal Culture (Martian branch).

"This culture is unique in human history as the only culture to
 form with only one driving force behind it.  They don't hunt for
 food or water or search for shelters, (All were provided by the
 Government in perpetuity, thus continuing a long standing
 relationship between Heavy Metal fans and the Social Services
 department.) but are almost solely preoccupied with Heavy Metal
 Music.  This music tends to be loud, dealing almost solely with
 sex and/or demonology, and is generally agreed to be crap.  All
 females involved are called Shazza, whilst all males have names
 that are entirely not sensible at all.
 Several important words exist in the Martian culture long since
 lost on Earth. Theses words are listed below:

  F'kin:(verb,noun,adj.) Always used in place of the word 'very.'
              e.g "We're f'kin honoured to see you, Your Majesty."

  Maiden,Zepplin,Purple,Gunners,Acca Dacca,Ozzy etc.  Gods of the
  Heavy Metal fans.  At the mention of any God, the fans ritually
  bang their heads against thin air. Though the purpose of this is
  not clear, it is possible they are trying to prevent their tiny
  brains from slipping down their necks.

  Air Guitar: The instrument most fans play.  Fans are loath to
  play real guitars, since that needs lessons.  In fact, 'lessons'
  is a swear word in this culture.

"Ok, Chad I think that should do it.  Think you can conduct
 yourself properly ?"
"F'kin much so !" exclaimed Chadwick, as he went through the
motions of playing an amazing solo....on a flute.
"Why me Lord ? " Roger cried to himself.  "The guitar goes around
 the neck."
As they left the ship, Chadwick was plucking his throat and
thinking how silly this would look.

Roger strode down the landing ramp, trying to instill a sense of
awe (Navy Contact Guide: Sec. 13 p 722) in the throng of hostile
HMMs (Heavy Metal Martians).  The effect was not helped, however
by Chadwick falling off the side of the ramp.  All was not lost,
though, as Roger noticed all the natives had were ancient electric
guitars pointed at him.  They weren't even plugged in !  Roger
began to laugh out loud. (NCG: Sec 13 p 723) "What are you going
to do ?  Twang me to death ?!!"  Even Chadwick chuckled from two
feet under the Martian dust.  There was no reaction from the
crowd, except one individual who casually pointed his guitar at
the ship, which uncharacteristically exploded !  "Oh dear...."
thought Roger, remembering the Navy Contact Guide.  "If your craft
is destroyed, see Sec 28: How to Read yourself the Last Rites."

============
Episode Six
============
In our last Pulitzer Prize Winning episode, Roger and Chadwick had been
captured by the Heavy Metal Martians and had their spaceship blown up by a
loaded Japanese '54 Fender Strat.  Roger's plan to awe the natives, sadly but
predictably backfired worse than Saddam's 'Tour of Kuwait - 1991' and things
look bleak for our intrepid yet gullible heroes.....
------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger and Chad were bound tightly with bottom E-strings and led through the
narrow enclosed streets of the HMMC.  Outside the dome could be seen graceful,
dusty ruins, delicately aged into their majestic twilight years.  Untouched by
the passing centuries, the buildings held positions only possible in the
lighter gravity of Mars.  The original Martians had never been found but as
with all vanished races in sci-fi series, they were much smarter than us.
Didn't really explain why they let the Earth take over their world.  One of
their captives noticed Roger and Chad staring at the old Martian structures.

"F'kin ugly, aren't they ?  Don't worry, man,  we're knocking 'em down next
 year.  Gonna build a huge f'kin concert arena instead!"
"Your artistic sensibilities astonish me." lied Roger, sarcastically.
"Y'know we're planning a comeback tour of the Earth ?" said the HMM.
"Really ?" chuckled Roger in disbelief. "But you don't have a spaceship !"
"Don't need one.  We got a Marshall !!" laughed the HMM.  "If you lie it face
down, that amp's got enough power to lift itself right off the ground !  And
it can take us with it !"
This was beginning to sound seriously dangerous.  The sub-plot was going to
take longer to finish off than Roger had previously thought.

They were thrown into a stinking pit of a room, one of Edisons original 2 watt
light bulbs, toilet, and a floor showing more cockroach than floor.
"Wow ! Just like home !" smiled Chadwick, eagerly looking around.
Roger was less impressed.  "I bet room service closes at ten around here.
Better get some shuteye then, we'll need for tomorrow's heroic and daring
escape sequence."  He walked to the bed, killing as many cockroaches as
possible.  At least Chadwick would have plenty of dinner tonight.

After getting very little sleep, because of the mutated cockroaches practising
"Stairway to Heaven," Roger was awoken by the sweet strains of 'Revielle' on
heavily distorted guitar.  With all the extra licks and turns thrown in, it
took seven minutes to finish.

Roger kicked Chadwick to conciousness, praying that he wouldn't have his
customary apres-sleep morning fart.  He was lucky.
"Good morning Colonel. " Chad stretched until you could just see one of his
bones poking out of his generously-proportioned figure.
"Have you got your escape plan together ?"
"Wait a minute, I'll check...." said Roger, searching his memory to see if his
built in IULEG (Incredible, Unbelievably Lucky Escape Generator) had come up
with anything, and it had.

(I hope nobody here has read 2000AD Monthly issue 18, 'cos I absolutely
positively didn't get this from pages 8 to 17 thereof.)

"Well Chad, this is incredibly unbelievably lucky, but there's a massive
 escape tunnel right underneath us that the HMs haven't found yet, even though
they've been here for two hundred years, and we've been here for one night !"
"By the great Skilbey, sir !  We're lucky today aren't we ! "
Roger overacted a huge smile. "We sure are, Chad !"
Chadwick seemed to remember something "Didn't I read this somewhere bef....."
A series of full stops hit Chad over the head, thus preventing further
embarrassment to a certain author.

Roger swept the dust away, revealing a stone slab.  Luckily, the HMs hadn't
put many guards on the only prisoners they've had in two hundred years.  In
addition, these guards suffered bouts of deafness, especially during highly
contrived escapes.(Doesn't this sound like every war movie you've ever seen.?)

The slab lifted to reveal blackness.  The blackness led down into more
blackness, but it was blacker.  Roger reached deep, found the light switch and
turned it on.  It revealed a small room, with a sliding steel door on one
side, a small railing around four feet from the ground and flourescent lights
in the ceiling.  There was also very annoying music, (James Last Orchestra
playing the Best of Deep Purple) and a sign saying MAX CAP: 16 PERSONS.
"This guy Max must be really sick if he thinks he's sixteen different
 people...." thought Roger as he jumped into the small room.  Chadwick
followed by trying to climb down slowly, but was left dangling his hands
gripping the hole in the roof while his feet lingered five feet from the
floor.

"Help me Roger ! I can't get down !"
"Your dancing problems, like your aromatic armpits,  aren't my fault, so don't
inflict them on me, OK ?" commented Roger as he casually tickled Chad's ribs,
making him crash to the floor.  Beside the steel door were several buttons,
all illegibly marked.  Roger pushed the bottom one, hoping it would lead
somewhere interesting and safe.  Roger felt the elevator started to descend,
but it quickly stopped much too soon.  A soft bell sounded, and the door slid
slowly open.  Outside stood a small figure who looked like a green Cabbage
Patch Kid dressed as Obi Wan Kenobi, complete with a mysterious hood which
cast strange dancing shadows on his craggy face.  It opened its mouth to
speak.....
"Going down ?" croaked the ancient being.
Roger barely managed to say yes.
"Damn Good Coffee !" murmured the creature.

The small figure shuffled forward into the elevator, turned to face the door
and started humming to the muzak, totally oblivious to Roger's presence.  He
even managed to ignore Chadwick's devastating aroma.  The elevator continued
it's descent, stopped, and everyone got out.  The room they entered was huge
and cave-like but with a smooth glowing white floor.  Scattered all around
were strange machines, and all around them were hundreds of little beings.  It
looked like a dozen sci-fi conventions rolled into one Martian mess.
Unfortunately, Roger wasn't dressed for the occasion, and naturally was
viciously attacked.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will Roger survive being mauled by  walking celery sticks ?

=============
Episode Seven
=============
In our (my) last thriller of an episode, Roger and Chadwick escaped from the
heavy metal Martian mob, and stumbled into an underground hideout, the last
refuge of the Yoda lookalikes.  Unfortunately, due to the need for exciting
and dangerous endings, our heroes are being attacked.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luckily for Roger and Chad, little creatures living under such low gravity
tend to be very weak, so it was like being attacked by under-developed pygmies
wielding damp lettuce.  Chadwick was tickled slightly on his nose, and his
sneeze knocked seven of them across the room.  The rest of them surrendered at
once, and asked him "Are you from Earth ?"
"Yes, we are."
A great 'excited crowd' noise arose, prompting the slightly bruised alien to
step closer to Roger.
"Then please tell us," A strange awed, expectant look came over his face.
"....Who killed Laura Palmer ?"

There was an audible silence as Roger tried to think who he meant.
"I - I'm sorry...who ?"
"Laura Palmer....daughter of Leland, very good friend of almost anybody....she
 of the blue makeup."
"Should I know ?" asked a bewildered Roger, who was born hundreds of years too
late for all this.

The little green guy started to get emotional and impatient.
"For a hundred years we had monitored your television in order to learn your
 ways.  We still have many questions like 'Why is Neighbours STILL running ?'
 but most of all...."Who killed Laura Palmer ?"  We have the whole first
 series on tape, but Eg-Nog (cursed be his name) broke the antenna, and the
 repairman union was on strike for three years."

He started to cry, clutching Roger's trousers.  The rest of the crowd didn't
look too sane, either, and were shuffling closer.
"If you don't tell us, we'll go collectively NUTS !!  Was it Leo ?  Or Bobby ?
 Or Agent Cooper ? PLEASE !!"
He broke down into a sobbing heap, draped over Roger's shiny boots.  The
others started yelling names at Roger, pressing forward, eager for a reply,
ANY reply ! "Donna ! Leo ! The owl !"

Roger and Chad back stepped towards the lift.  Chad worriedly tugged Roger's
arm.
"Tell them something, Roger ! Anything ! Just get us out of here!"
"Um....er...it was..." The room went deathly silent again.
"MARVIN !!" yelled Roger as he turned and ran back to the open elevator doors.

The crowd gasped, then sighed in that 'I knew it all the time' way that annoys
the hell out of everyone, especially when you know for a fact that whoever it
is didn't know anything of the sort.  Voices started up again, saying "Of
course !  I could see it in his eyes !  Who else could it have been ?!" The
trick seemed to have worked.  Although, as the elevator doors closed, Roger
was sure he heard one of them say .....
"Waitasec.....who the Hell is Marvin ?"

Roger stabbed the 'down' button, hoping that the author would plant another
convenient escape ship somewhere below.  Unfortunately, and totally out of the
author's control, the elevator began to rise, back towards the surface, and
the horrible Heavy Metal Martians.  It did this because it was upset.  It's
not often that elevators get upset, but this one was peeved that the author
hadn't give it a long speech on the tedium of being an elevator (ha ha), or
letting it see the future, and be very funny about not wanting to go up (ha
ha), and thus robbed it of a chance at stardom.  Well, this author doesn't
think that psychic elevators are believable.  Little green guys watching 'Twin
Peaks' are obviously an everyday occurence.  Not to worry, readers.  After
Roger and Chad nervously tiptoed from the elevator, it promptly dropped down
its own shaft due to a unforeseen case of Ferrous Termites.

They stepped into a 'Variation on a Launching Pad Theme.'  Just imagine
something very metallic, functional, greyish, and covered in graffiti, and
that's probably the place.  Sitting in the middle was the Marshall FBD from
Episode Four.  For those of you who have sinfully not tattooed this story onto
your arm, the Marshall "F'kin Beast of Destruction" is a spaceship owned by
the Heavy Metal Martians.  And, just to be totally original, Roger was going
to steal it.

They reached the boarding ramp, but got a surprise when they pressed the
button marked 'Open the f'kin door.'  Something happened, but you couldn't
file it under "Door Openings I Have Read About."
"It didn't open, Roger !" yelled Chadwick through clenched teeth.  (This is a
very difficult thing to do, and some experts have pointed out that it is
possible that when Chadwick talks, not all the noise comes from his mouth.)
"Not to worry, young but overripe sidekick." He pulled small black box from
his pocket.
"My very own sub-molecular burglar kit ! Guaranteed to break any form of
 electronic locking or you get five years off your sentence."
Roger knelt and stuck the device onto the black metal door, totally ignoring
what we of the Twentieth century would call a 'Door Handle.'
"What do you think you're doing ?" yelled a voice that seemed to come from the
door itself.
Roger looked up in surprise.  Doors weren't meant to talk.  Martians - yes,
computers - yes, Inflatable Ingrid - yes, but not doors !  He pushed a few
buttons on the burglar kit.
"That won't work you know.  I'm burglar proof !"  It was definitely the door.
Roger kept working.  "Just shut up, Door !  No known code can stand my black
box.....try and stop this !"  He reached out and pressed a red button.

The box began to buzz softly, and a row of red lights all lit up and began to
flash in different combinations at amazing speed.   It soon began to slow down
as the buzzing became louder.  The lights stopped, but the door remained shut.
A loud buzz followed by a fury of flashing lights.  Nothing.  The door was
silent, but in smug sort of way.  The box hummed, but no lights came on.  The
humming became a rattling hum (!?), then a scream, and smoke began to pour
from it.  It fell to the floor and smashed itself.
"Bloody Japanese artificial intelligence...." muttered Roger. "Why do Japanese
AI systems kill themselves if they fail their mission ?"

But there was no time to contemplate that last joke, because the Heavy Metal
Martians had discovered their prisoners were gone !  Alarm guitars were
twanging through the whole sub-plot, thus providing an exciting scene to
escape from !  But how could Roger and Chadwick escape from this dire
predicament !

===============
Episode Eight
===============
In the last episode, Roger and Chadwick were perilously trapped between a very
locked door into the Marshall FBD (A spaceship / 100 000 watt amplifier) and a
high potential for a horde of Heavy Metal Martians.  The door wouldn't open,
and the whole colony was searching for them.  What will our brave heroes do ?
Forget the brave heroes, let's watch Roger and Chad.
==============================================================================
Roger leapt into a carefully planned course of action, namely screaming and
trying to batter the door down with his fists before the horde got there.
"AAAARRRRGGGHH !!! Lemme in !! We're all gonna DDDIIIIIEEEEE !!!"

When Phase One of this ground-breaking plan was complete, Roger moved on to
Phase Two :  crying and cowering in a quivering heap.  But Chadwick, the poor
man's Sanchez, ran to Roger's side and shook the pathetic Roger's heaving
shoulders.
"Colonel !  Please don't do that !  You always get out of everything !"
He pulled a rickety tape recorder from some anonymous recess of his clothing
and pressed 'play.'  From its dilapidated speaker came the woeful strains of
some annoyingly patriotic and inspirational music.  Chadwick lifted his head
and began to make a patronizing speech into where Camera Three would have
been when the movie rights to this episode were sold.

"What about that terrible time on Sirius VI, Colonel ?  You didn't learn the
 native language correctly and told the Thoroughly Insane Dictator of True
 Pain and Torture that his sisters were as ugly as a Fifth dimensional
 Warthog with a skin condition, but after I radioed the Third Brigade of Death
 Marines in, we managed to complete the mission.  And on Solomon's World, when
 you followed that map upside-down for three days and got us trapped behind
 lines, we still managed to get out, with just a little help from a tactical
 airstrike by four squadrons of the Ultra Bomber Wing, and on Salva..."

"Ok ! Ok ! So you're a great morale booster, Chad ! What, in the name of
 Skilbey, did I ever do to deserve you !" shouted Roger sarcastically.
Chadwick didn't understand sarcasm, being too brutally honest. (Not to mention
as thick as Ultra-Packed Plasteel.)
"Oh Colonel ! You're back ! I'm so happy you're back !" blurted the delirious
Chadwick.
"Yeah, yeah, whatever you think, Chad.  Just turn that bloody music off !"

Chadwick did so, and Roger returned to trying to unlock and open the door.
First he tried to bypass the electro-lock seal circuits with a Wendell 750
Plasma Harmonizer.  The door remained shut.
Then he made a small target on the metal surface and used a Yazaki Electron
Destabilizer.  The door was unimpressed by his efforts and didn't budge.
Roger then picked up a stray Particle Mega-Cannon and delicately showered the
door with enough high energy radiation to destroy a minor Sun.  The door
internally yawned, contemplated the sudden warm spell, and thought about how
great it was to be locked.
After chanting an ancient Swahili door opening spell, Roger borrowed a Sonic
Screwdriver from a man with a long scarf and obligatory hornbag assistant.
The door had never read about Sonic Screwdrivers and continued its state of
blissful lockedness.
This attempt was followed by a quick horoscope casting, sacrifice of a virgin
mouse and selling his eternal soul to the Devil.  The door was, of course, a
skeptic and had no time for such occult nonsense.  If you had to choose a
phrase to characterize this door, "Obstinately and stubbornly locked" would
probably be a candidate for the "Most Accurate Assessment Of A Door" trophy.

Roger was about to re-implement Phase Two of his previously incomplete plan,
when Chadwick stepped forward and pulled down hard on the door handle.
(Remember that ?!)  The door quietly and graciously slid open.  Roger
contemplated suicide, then he decided maybe a quick bout of strangling
Chadwick might be more appropriate.  But it was too late, because Chadwick had
already wandered into the ship.  Roger trudged, trying to invent some new
torture methods that were especially effective on "...ungrateful sidekicks who
upstage their Heroes...mutter...mutter."

The interior of the ship consisted of two items.  A control console just where
you would expect it to be, and beer cans everywhere else.  Roger pushed away a
few cans and revealed the pilot's seat.  It's surface, having not been cleaned
for hundreds of years made Roger worry about his the condition in which his
bum would be returned to him after sitting in it, so he decided to take his
chances with standing.  Predictably, Chadwick took no notice of it, in fact,
the seat seemed to try and avoid Chad's bum, a feeling held by nearly all
sentient beings.

Roger was proud of their progress so far, and rightly so.  Two alien mobs,
three hostile inanimate objects, one lucky escape and several useless and dull
sub-plots had safely been avoided.  In light of this, he was especially
indignant that the ship was being uncooperative, and refused to start.  He
sent Chadwick outside to try and find the problem, but Chadwick, being only a
sidekick, and a cowardly one at that, pointed out that only Heroes could solve
dangerous and life-threatening dilemmas.  However, if ever Roger needed undue
praise, ego-boosting, or a quick shoe-shine, he'd be there with bells on.

Roger huffed, and stepped outside the ship.  The alarm guitars were still
chugging away, and the Heavy Metal Martians would probably be here soon.
As he walked down the ramp, he noticed a thin black cord running towards the
rear of the ship.  Roger followed the cord to the back of the ship and up into
the engines.  In the shadows he noticed a quarter inch hole.  It was marked
POWER.  On the end of the black wire, lying next to the hole was a metallic
plug.  Roger looked hard at the plug, then the hole.  He was sure there was
some elementary relationship between the two which he was missing.  As he
stared, he felt a rumbling under his feet, and voices began to sound in the
distance.  The rumbling and the voices grew louder, the Martians had tracked
him down !

"Plug the bastard !" came a cry from the horde of hair, black t-shirts,
slashed jeans and loaded guitars.  Of course !  Plug !  Roger grabbed the plug
and shoved it into the hole.  The ship began to hum to itself.  (It later
wrote a tune based on the humming and made a fortune.)  Roger began a mad dash
to the boarding ramp of the ship, but he was too late !  The Martian Mob had
blocked his path and were slowly advancing on him !  They didn't look happy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will Roger get out of this nail-biting situation ?
   Will the escape be sensible at all ?
      Why does a spaceship need a power plug ? (Therein lies a gag.)

Find out in our next thrilling, chilling episode:

Power Cords Man !   OR   Where's the Spare Battery ?

 
==============
Episode Nine
==============
At the thrilling climax of our last episode, Roger had plugged in the engines
of the escape ship, but was now cut off from the boarding ramp by a horde of
Heavy Metal Martians.  This didn't help the exciting escape scene much,
because it's notoriously hard to escape when you're not on board.  Could Roger
fix his problem ?  Let's watch......
____________________________________________________________________________
The mumbling horde began to shuffle forward towards Roger.  Trapped !  But
wait !  Maybe, they'd all attack one at a time, like they always do in the
movies....no such luck.  The mob still surged forward, growling words like
"Kill" and "Pain" and "Cut 'em off."  None of these prospects appealed to
Roger, so he mentally prepared himself for some heroic combat sequences.
Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath, crossed his arms over his chest and
prayed to the God of Unbelievable Fight Sequences: Arnie Stallone.

"Aaaaaaaoooooooouuuuuuuummmmmm  *THWACK* *CRUMP*" said Roger, as he slumped
to the ground with a nasty lump on his head.  Heavy Metal fans are
notoriously distrustful of philosophy, and seeing Roger's deeply
introspective chanting, immediately smashed him over the head with a Gibson.
As Roger began the slow descent into blackness, he heard the dragging
footsteps of the mob nearing his helpless body.  As he decided it was all
over for him, and started wondering how many thousands of grief-wracked
mourners would bawl their way through his funeral, a strange sound filled
the air.  Roger recognized it as Chadwick's favourite cassette: a bootleg
recording of a live concert featuring Nana Mouskouri, Lawrence Welk, Willie
Nelson, John Denver and the Hooked On Classics drum machine.

The mob stopped as the music filtered through the hairspray and disturbed
the long disused 'brain' cells.  They all froze, and clapped their hands
over their ears, desperately trying to keep the woeful, pathetic strains out
of their ears, but it was no use.  A frightening scream rent the air as
hundreds of tortured souls sank to the floor, begging for mercy.

"Music hath charms to sooth the savage beast," thought Roger, "but if you
 don't have real music, then you can't go past Chad's bootlegs !" He casually
strolled past the writhing figures, occasionally putting the boot in if one of
them twitched in a suspicious or threatening way.

Inside the ship, Chadwick had stacked some boxes on the seat so he could see
over the control panel and was relaxing, snapping his fingers, enjoying what
his disfigured brain chose to call music.
"Did you have any problems fixing the engines, Colonel ?"
"Nah, not really." said Roger, seeing an opportunity to show off.  "Just the
usual alien horde to vanquish.  Care to have a look ?"
Chadwick jumped down from the chair and ran to the view port.
"Wow !  Did they hurt you, Colonel ?  Did you get all of them ?"
"Sure I did !  One of them nearly knocked my immaculate hair out of place,
 though....the consequences could have been dire.  Let's get this ship off the
 ground, Mars is getting dull real fast."

They sat down at the pilot's console and logged onto the ship's control
system.  They TRIED to logon to the engine control system.  (Please note, the
author is about to unleash scathing attack upon a personal loathing of his:
logging on to uncooperative systems from remote sites.)

Roger pressed a few keys, and the screen was instantly covered in garbage.
After changing parity and data bits setting, Roger succeeded in getting into
the first stage of the system.  But it was the Kitchen system, so Roger used
the this one to try and get into the Engine Control System (which wouldn't
respond directly to it's own phone number).  He managed it, but it had a
different data bit setting to the first one, and consequently crashed.  After
swearing loudly, Roger repeated the whole process 3 times.  It mysteriously
and for no apparent reason, worked on the last try, but the text quickly
changed to garbage when Roger accidentally type the letter 's' and breathed
too hard.  "Sod this !" cried an exasparated Roger.  If he had been the
author, he'd probably have nicked off to the kitchen to eat things, but being
a Hero meant he had to start the engine manually and keep the plot ticking
over.

He ran towards the back of the ship, into the Power Source Facility.  In an
attempt at humour, one of the Martians had crossed out 'Source' and tried to
write 'Chords' but obviously did not possess complete control of his either
his hand or, in fact, the alphabet.  Roger stepped through the door, which
made the door happy (Plagiarism !  Plagiarism !) and flipped the light switch.

Inside the small room was a terrible sight indeed.  It smelled awful, like
twenty sweaty musicians locked in a stable of horses suffering at least six
gastric disorders .... on a hot day.  Strangely enough, only the stable and
horses were missing from such a quaint scene.  The twenty musicians turned to
face Roger.  Roger looked back and forth, trying to create a clear description
in his mind for us to read.

What could he think, but that these poor souls must be mutants.  Hideously
deformed by prolonged exposure to Heavy Metal, their bodies had warped to fit
the subliminally projected stereotype from all Heavy Metal songs.  There was
no head or face, just a mass of hair.  The legs weren't actual legs, they were
more the result of an overzealous stuffing of the crotch with socks, various
fruits, aerosol cans and, in one pitiful case, a pumpkin.  These varied forms
of padding had been vastly overdone, and ran all the way down jean's legs,
clinging tightly to the patches of fabric between the wide rips and slashes,
thus forming a barely functioning leg.  By far, though, the most amazing
feature of these beasts was the torso.  It was a guitar !  A beautiful,
shining guitar of fantastic design, each brilliantly unique, each eminently
playable, graced the gap between hair and legs.  A long wire led from each
guitar into a small plug in the wall, above which was a small speaker.

One of the figures lifted its arms and began to pluck its strings.  The
guitars actually talked by playing !
"What gives, man ?" came a voice from the speaker behind the guitar.
"Erm...." replied Roger, succinctly and authoritatively.
"Is this gig happening, or what ?" asked a red and white Fender, softly
plucking its strings.
"Um...How...what ?" insisted Roger, forcefully, yet tactfully.
"Just give us the word, and we play the ship right into orbit !" chuckled a
guitar with a beer-gut in the corner.
"That sounds good !" said Roger, relieved to hear no violence was needed.
"After we have a few crates of whiskey, of course !"  It laughed slobbily, and
if it could have drooled inanely, it probably would have.  Seeing Roger's
blank expression, it's tone changed....
"You did bring the booze, didntcha ?"
"Uh oh..." thought Roger, "Problems...with a capital W !"
==============================================================================

===============
Episode Ten
===============
In our last not so dangerous episode, Roger had discovered what actually
powers the spaceship he has gallantly stolen: Rock-N-Roll !  One problem, the
twenty living guitars that provide it won't start till vast amounts of whiskey
are thrown their way.  Roger has never heard of this stuff, and so risks being
viciously attacked, as usual.  How will Roger get the ship going ? Read on....
==============================================================================
"So where's the whiskey, man ?" demanded a vile, beer-gut shaped guitar.
"Er...I haven't got any whiskey." replied Roger, wondering what tone of voice
was best for trying to convince an alcoholic living guitar to cooperate.
The other guitars began to play again, but the music was terrible and loud.
"We call this one the 'No Whisky Blues'." bellowed the fat guitar.  "We sing
it just before we kill the guy who told us there's no booze !"  The group
slowly began to advance on Roger, their weak legs unable to move quickly.

Roger had to move quickly.  What would keep these vile creatures back ?  Aha !
Nipping past two guitars and jumping over a third, Roger landed in front of
the hole that the fat guitar was plugged into.  He reached up and yanked it
out of the wall.  The guitar plucked at its strings, but heard only a nasty
twanging sound that rattled horribly.  In silence it clattered to the floor.
The other guitars stopped dead and looked at their fallen companion.
"If this ship isn't off the ground in two minutes, " said Roger, "the rest of
 you get the same, OK ?"  He turned and strutted arrogantly from the room,
notching up another twelve points on his personal Toughometer.

During the next three hours, some incredible sounds came from that back room.
It was like ten 'Monsters of Rock' concerts meeting a nuclear bomb, only
louder.  Flying on rock-n-roll had its disadvantages: There was only one
station to listen to, and you couldn't turn it down.

"Chadwick ! Go stand outside the door, please."
"Do you want me to guard the cabin, sir ? Am I being useful yet ?"
"Yes, but not as a guard, I just want your multi-layered alleged skin out
there blocking that horrible noise off.  Honestly, Chad, some of the stuff
that covers you is still unidentified by science !"

But all was not as Hunky-Dory as it seemed.  Roger had indeed managed to steal
the Amplifier/Spaceship, but he hadn't really thought about the Episode where
he plugged in the power cord to the engine.  The Marshall company, when it
went into building spaceships instead of amplifiers, couldn't get out of the
habit of putting power leads instead of internal batteries.  Basically, their
spaceship had to be plugged into a 220V wall socket before it would go
anywhere.  Unfortunately for Roger, the three hundred thousand foot long
extension cord was about to run out.....

Chadwick stuck his head around the door and asked Roger what a flashing
red light next to the 'Cable Limit Warning' meant.  Roger was about to
investigate, when every light in the ship went out.  The beeping, buzzing and
humming all suddenly vanished, and the guitars that powered the ship stopped
playing.  Roger ran to a window, and looking outside could see a thin glinting
from the cable that used to supply power to the ship snaked back to the
surface of Mars.  This was obviously a situation calling for leadership
ability, intelligence and a swift surety in one's decisions.  Roger glanced
around looking for this amazing sounding guy, but caught only his own
inadequate reflection.

"What do we do now, Colonel ?" asked Chadwick, re-entering the flight deck.
"Let's see where we're going first." answered Roger, trying to sound like he'd
done this a hundred times.  A quick look over the controls showed that the
ship was now driftting, powered by Newton's First Law.  "Well, it looks like
we've got enough air for about five hours."
"What happens when that runs out ?"
"We'll get tired, start hallucinating, collapse, and basically....die."
"Well at least you have a few hours to think of a way out." said Chadwick,
looking hopefully at Roger.
"Only if nothing unexpected happens to the air, like something involving your
disgusting digestive processes." replied Roger, feeling seriously worried.
"I'll try not to kill us, Colonel...." said Chadwick, turning away and finding
a comfortable corner to sit in, and wait.

Roger considered the situation.  They had just cast themselves adrift in
inter-planetary space, without power or extra air.  The chances of running
into another ship at this distance were astronomically small.  He'd rather
take a bet on a dead horse winning the Derby, or that the next US President
would be a small mongoose named Neil.

They sat still and waited for the air to run out.  Roger wasn't worried about
himself, he knew he would never succumb to the perils of hallucination, and
besides, the pink elephants running around his head would keep him safe.
Boredom wasn't a problem, the eighteen thousand one inch tall screaming
Mongols fighting a pitched battle with Hitler's Fourteenth Panzer Division
provided adequate entertainment.  It was only when all his old girlfriends
filed into the room and started nagging him about being lost in space again,
and never calling home, and never listening to what 'she needed....' that
Roger began to think that maybe - perhaps - it could be possible that his
sanity bucket had developed a leak.  Breathing became agonizing toil, and his
vision began to cloud over.  It looked like the end for brave Roger.
Unless...what did that sign over there say ? He could only see a few of the
words clearly..."Auxiliary Air Supply" Roger struggled over to the sign, and
cleared the rest of the sign.  He read it again..."This ship has no Auxiliary
Air Supply."  With a groan at the terrible joke, Roger slid to the floor and
into unconciousness.
==============================================================================
Could this be the end for Roger and Chadwick ?
   Will they slowly suffocate and be lost in space forever ?
      Is the author really that stupid ?

Tune in next week for our next terrifying episode

New Improved Oxygen    OR    Who'll Get The Rogerson Account
================
Episode Eleven
================
In the last episode, Roger and Chadwick were suffocating to death inside a
Spaceship/100 000 Watt Amplifier recently borrowed from the Martian Heavy
Metal Colony.  When the power cable came out, the air stopped pumping, and
pretty soon, our Heroes will stop breathing.  And, being unconcious, they
didn't notice a strange craft drifting towards them....
==============================================================================
This intruder was not so much a spaceship as a flying billboard.  It's surface
was totally covered in what looked like advertising slogans: "Unflumbulate your
lopozoids with New Improved Lopozoid Unflumbulator !" and "Tired of seeing
your Polnoks looking like Veebles on a Dramblet ?  Buy this amazing New
Improved Polnok Hoozier and rest at ease !."  Even the ion stream from the
engine said "Koke Adds Life !"

All this selling power was lost on Roger and Chadwick who still lay unconcious
on the floor of their ship.  They remained blissfully unaware as a large hole
was punched through the roof and a small platform descended to the floor.
Upon the platform sat a medical droid, which dragged Chad and Roger onto the
platform, and sat patiently awaiting their recovery as they slowly moved back
to the other ship.

Roger lay still as his hearing returned.  He could hear the power system
running, and the air tasted and smelled sweet, and Chadwick was nowhere to be
seen.  (These two facts are more than coincidental.)  Looking around the room,
it seemed to be some kind of medical bay.  He was securely strapped onto an
uncomfortable stretcher, and couldn't do a thing about it.  A voice came from
somewhere behind him.  A young man was speaking to someone on the phone.

"Yeah, he's just woken up .... Weirdest thing I ever seen.  He's not from Clan
Kwikker-Kooker, or The Micro-Dine sector, or even Greater K.  He's got no ID,
no cards of any kind, no marks of civilisation on him at all.  Well, the Boss
wanted to see him, so I'm sending him up now."

Ten minutes later, Roger found himself strapped to a chair in a sumptuous
office the main feature of which was a fat businessman behind a huge wooden
desk.  In huge brass letters was written the name "Farquar T. Thunderbolt."
"So," began the man, "you're the guy with no firm."
"Er...I guess so." said Roger.
The businessman launched into a speech that would have made Hitler sit up
straight and start taking notes.
"Do you know what that means ?  It means that you are a subversive !  You are
dangerous !  You're a cancer in our society !  You don't belong here ! You
should be cut out...you should be made an example of."
Roger began to suspect he was not going to be given the pass-card to the city.
"And ordinarily we'd do it." continued Farquar.  "Sadly though, we have a
problem.  Let me explain our situation."

"This whole world is geared for only one thing: advertising.  We'd advertise
our own funerals if it got a new account for the company.  As you well know,
advertising is war, and we were originally bound for Zraken Beta, as
reinforcements for the Butter Substitute Wars.  Our ship crashed onto this
dung heap of a world after flying through twelve gigatons of our competitors
product.  The huge population on board weren't trained for anything...except
advertising !  That's what we're about.  Sadly, this world has no native
population, so we've got no-one to sell to, except ourselves.  And then we've
got no market to survey, except the guy who was the ships janitor.  He is now
'The Market'.  Everything we sell goes through a 'Market Survey'.  That is, we
ask the ex-janitor what he thinks of it.  Only problem is, all our tests
produce a one hundred percent result ! Every time !  Well, only problem now is
that he's at Death's Door and knocking pretty hard.  Luckily, you've turned
up.  How'd you like to be the new market ?"  He beamed at Roger as though he'd
just offered him twelve years in a locked room with the last seventy winners
of Miss Universe.  Roger just looked back at Farquar as though he'd just been
offered twelve years of being stranded on a planet full of crazy ad men. .....
which, in fact,  he was.

"Erm....can I think about it ?" asked Roger.
"Nope, we can't have you thinking, you know.  You must react instinctively,
tell us the first thing that comes into your mind."
"You're a bunch of poisonous, narrow-minded sons of a Hulgravant Mega-Wart
with the social relevance of a Papal Decree." grinned Roger.
"OK....that's a start..." frowned Farquar T. Thunderbolt.  "Tell you what, why
not go down to our leisure center and think it over.  It's one of the perks of
the job, y'know.  After a while down there, I'll just bet you'll love this
job."  He told Roger how to get there, and hurried off like a man who's just
carried off a brilliant plan and wants to brag to his friends...which he, in
fact, had.

Roger strode down the creamy walled halls and stopped at a plain looking door
marked "Leisure Center."  Letting himself in, he looked upon the most relaxing
and totally chillin' scene in the Galaxy, man.  The room was at least eight
feet high, and he couldn't see the walls, obscured as they were by a tropical
paradise straight from Fiji.  A waterfall cascaded from the roof into a
shimmering pool, hugged by smooth boulders damp from the rainbow spray.  On
each rock sat a gorgeous woman with a body that made Elle McPherson look like
Nancy Reagan.  "Uh oh.." said the suspicion centre of Roger's brain.  Roger
grinned and told his suspicion centre to take a short holiday, and shifted the
'Oh boy, look at that bimbo !' section into fourth gear.  He addressed all of
them at once, in a stupid pose that said "Hey, I'm a gullible pratt."
"Hey babes, I'm a multimedia superstar, and world famous Hero !  So who's
first ?" said Roger.  A stunning redhead slid voluptuously to the ground and
put her arms around Roger.  "Oh boy !" thought Roger.  "It actually worked !"

He spun around and dipped her low as in a romantic tango.  He bent low to
whisper sweet nothings in her perfect ear, and completely failed to notice the
tip of her left index finger drop off, revealing a glistening hypodermic.  She
plunged it deep into Roger jugular vein, and he fell to the ground.
"Damn it....I guess this means a nightcap is out of the question." said Roger
as blackness closed over him once more.
================================================================================
Has Roger's libido left him in trouble again ?
   Where has Chadwick got to ?
     Why set up such a lavish trap just for one man ? (Artistic license, man!)

For the answers to these world-shattering questions and not much else, tune in
next week for another spine-chilling episode of Rocket Roger !

=========
Ep Twelve
=========
At the end of the last mind-blowing episode, Roger had once more been rendered
unconcious by a combination of trickery (on their part) and stupidity (on his
part).  Little did Roger know (true enough in itself) that he was about to
undergo brain surgery.  It was the kind that would make him a perfect specimen
for market surveys: removal of 90% of brain tissue.  The situation seemed
hopeless......  (or whatever 'certain doom' cliche appeals to you.)
==============================================================================
Roger lay strapped down (for the second time in two episodes), cold, and
bloody annoyed !  He understood the need for the Hero to be in tricky
situations and then `Hero' his way out of it, but quite frankly, he was all
Heroed out.  He began to think back to his University days.....

     ****FLASHBACK TIME !! SHIMMER SHIMMER WOBBLE WOBBLE TWINKLY MUSIC****

"And so we can establish the Heroicicity required as a function of threat,
number of women present, resulting trouser bulge and how many bullets you have
left.  This is turn reveals that...." droned the lecturer.
"ZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzz....." replied the entire lecture theatre.

As usual, the lecturer had sent eight hundred bright cheery people into a
catatonic, zombie-like trance.  He was in good form today, it took a whole
eleven minutes.  Roger was made of sterner stuff than most of the others, and
could still force his left eye to creak open, though the right one had long
since given up, choosing instead to dream about Magda "Roller Coaster"
Williams.  Elementary Heroism 501 was the dullest subject since 'Great Music
of the late 1970s', and Roger hated every minute of it.  In fact, he also
hated Advanced Double Talk 314, Atomic Device Building 666, Advanced Seduction
417 (well, that one wasn't too bad.) and Running Like Buggery 806.  He felt an
insect bite his shoulder and, as usual, succeeded only in bruising himself
when he tried to swat it.  "That's it !" thought Roger. "I hate this place,
I'm getting out !"

As you may have guessed, Roger's education was no ordinary one.  He was
trained to be a Hero from an early age and had spent all his life learning all
the skills he'd need to be a genuine 'Poster-on-the-bedroom-wall, Dinner-
With-The-Queen, Take-My-Daughter-In-Fact-Take-Them-Both ' type of Hero.
Unfortunately, he hated, loathed and despised every contemptible, futile
moment his father was forcing him to endure.  It is the bane of all sons to be
what their fathers were not, but Roger (as you may have guessed) wasn't
interested any more.  "Right." thought Roger.  "Escape time !"

Later that night, having packed his favourite 'Ultra-Dude' comic, five frag
grenades, Electra-Plasmoid Lacerator and a change of underwear, he executed
his brilliant escape plan.  After bribing his dorm-guard with a heavy blow to
the head, running down the hallway holding a full length mirror ahead of
himself (to fool the video cameras), detonating sixteen mines by throwing his
mother's English Muffins (densest substance known to man) ahead of himself, he
finally reached the outer wall.  Flinging himself over it with a method
perfected only by Lunar high jumpers and b-grade Chinese movie actors, he
landed heavily on....a solid oak podium . . . with a microphone neatly at his
mouth . . . and an audience of smiling academics, parents and friends beaming
at him.  This not being the kind of thing you expect on the other end of an
escape, Roger just stood there with bulging eyes and open mouth.

"Congratulations Roger !" came a deep voice.  It was the Head of the
University, General Jeremiah 'Was A Bullfrog' Vorroson.  "A beautiful
graduation if ever I saw one.  Your parents must be very proud of you."
"Um...yeah, I guess." replied a stunned Roger.  "You mean you wanted me to
escape ?"
"Of course we did !" replied the General.  "You can't make a Hero.  Heroes are
born, not made.  So we just pressure you with boredom, stupid subjects and a
total lack of female companionship in the hope that you'll take it upon
yourself to use your training, think for yourself, and get out."  He grinned
the sort of grin that makes you want to grin too, though you're not sure why.
Roger wasn't sure either, but grinned anyway.  He turned to the audience, and
they all grinned too.  Roger turned to back to the General, and noticed that a
small pistol in his chubby hand was pointed at Roger's neck.  A soft whoosh of
air, and Roger slumped to the deck, still grinning.  It is a strange fact that
he was to spend much of his career as Hero slumped and unconcious, so it seems
he would just have to start getting used to it.
 
He awoke (not in the real world, just in his dream) right in the middle of what
some would call The Deep End, into which he'd been thrown.  This particular
deep end took the form of a negotiating table on the Planet Squipo.  At one
end sat a representative from the Quinton Fabulon Washing Machine Company, 
dressed in metal panels made from a recycled washing machine.  Facing him was 
what can only be described as  an Alsatian after meeting three chainsaws for a 
long chat and quick bout of dismembering.  It was actually three Squips, 
telepathic creatures of astonishing collective intelligence.  Sadly, if their 
telepathy was blocked (as it was by a washing machine in full spin cycle) they 
became as clever as a Mac owner.  They barely had enough intelligence between 
them to make sure they'd go out with a bang.  In exactly half an hour, their 
automatic Warbots would scour this planet, destroying every electrical 
appliance (especially washing machines) they could find.  At the same time, 
the washing machine company would launch a 'Spin Cycle' to end them all, in 
the form of a giant washing machine at the very core of the planet, sending it
spinning into another orbit.  And Roger, barely twelve hours into his career, 
had to stop them.

Naturally, he failed miserably, spending ten minutes trying to turn on his 
translator, another ten getting to know the two representatives, and ten more 
saying  "Well, lets try and see it from his point of view."  The entire planet
was laid waste.  As Roger sat there feeling useless and pathetic, eighteen
hundred ships from Earth landed, strip mined the entire planet in 5 hours flat
and took Roger back to Earth, along with around twenty percent of what had been 
the beautiful Planet Squipo.

"Well done Roger !" came the greeting from General Vorroson.  "You've done the
school proud.  You obviously knew we couldn't mine the planet while intelligent
life still existed there, so you manipulated those stupid Squids...."
"Squips, sir." interrupted Roger.
"Yeah, whatever, into roasting themselves into oblivion !  Brilliant
statesmanship, Roger.  All that ore will go straight to the Quinton Fabulon
Washing Machine company to provide badly needed washing machines for the
Scrabongor system.  Now, there's this alien there called a Goppigong...."
Roger calmly turned and fainted, thus beginning an illustrious career in the
service of the wonderful, exploitative world of Heroism.

Why has the author provided such a non-event ending ?
    Will Roger ever succeed (like a toothless parrot) ?
       Will Chadwick ever return from wherever he might be ?

=========================
Episode Twelve point Five
=========================
The sad time has come......the author is unable to provide a genuine, bona
fide, 100% Aussie Beef episode of Rocket Roger !  Instead, he's serving up this
half-baked 5% Kangaroo meat pint sized episode with artificial plot devices,
carcinogenic humour and dramatic additives.  The real thing will be back Real
Soon Now !  (This is Roger as a kid again, about third year University level.)
================================================================================
Roger was in trouble, again.  But it wasn't another life-threatening situation,
unless you consider having six assignments due this week as a potentially 
death inducing situation.  As he sat and contemplated the mountain of
paperwork in front of him, he thought of another Very Important Thing to do. 
It became absolutely vital to go and write another episode of his brilliant
story: Brave Brian.  This newly discovered sense of urgency to do something 
useful spouted from that part of Roger's brain which controlled the Desire To 
Be A Good Citizen hormones.  But since Roger had no intention of actually 
starting any assignments, he justified it with other stuff: like washing the 
car, dishes, dog, roof, fence, neighbour's fence, kitchen utensils, kitchen 
floor, ceiling, and writing lots of garbage.  

Fighting his way through the towers of reference books, half started essays,
piles of bug reports and core dumps, he struggled into the terminal room,
logged on, and wrote lots of crap, then flung it out to an unsuspecting world. 
(Except for those who asked for it.)  ("Nobody expects it, in fact those who DO
expect it"...tend to quote Monty Python a lot...hmmm.)  The writing was good,
it got laughs, it got replies, it won awards (Most Gratuitous Use of the Word 
'Electrono-Plasmoid-Interpolation-Polarity-Inverter-Accelerator' in Yak Skin
transcript form.)  but these screaming masses of fans did nothing to sway the
tutors who demanded to see Roger's completed assignments.  Roger said nothing,
and tried to bravely flash the reams of praise received from far and wide. 
Sadly, it didn't work and Roger was expelled from the Computing course, and had
to become a freelance Hero instead.  

This story was within an amoeba's left thumbnail of being true.  My nasty
assignments got in the way of more important plot questions, like 'Where has
Chad got to ?  Will Roger wake up and escape from the evil advertising planet ? 
Will the Mad Scribe ever get back to the plot line so thoughtfully expounded in
Episode One ? (God I hope so.)'

Keep watching, faithful readers.  Just think of it as Roger catching the wrong
train.  He's on his way.  Never fear.  Go ahead make my cliche.  Shut up.  OK.

The Mad Scribe trudges off to tackle the fearsome UNIX beast head-on.

===================
Episode Thirteen
===================
The Story So Far: Roger has crashed on a planet inhabited entirely by
Advertising Executives, who want him to become The Market.  To make him a good
candidate for market surveys, they want to remove his brain.  He has found
himself strapped to an obligatory operating table......
===============================================================================
Now that the obligatory and long overdue flashback scene was over, allowing
the author to use the University humor that has been held back for so long,
Roger was able to get back to the real world, where his brain was about to be
removed in order that he could become a good candidate for market surveys.  It
would qualify him to answer the Eternal Question: 'Do you prefer Snork to
Butter ?'  Obviously, giving a good answer to this question precludes the
possession of a brain, so Roger's brain busily packed its bags for a short
trip to the hospital incerator, from whence it might end up at any of fourteen
thousand McDonalds scattered around the planet.  Roger was currently strapped
to the cold operating table from Episode eleven.

"How about plan 34-C ?" asked Roger of himself.
"Nah, we don't have a Yak or a M-78 Ultra-Huge Tank." answered Roger.
"Right, " replied Roger "What about 40-Delta-QZX9 ?"
"I doubt that would work.  We're missing the small knife, the unicycle, and
the Eighth Division of Krappen's Mad Mercenaries." replied Roger again.
"Hmmm...well how about - "
"Ah shut up and stop bothering me !" yelled Roger at himself.

"Oh goodly yes indeedly !  The patient is wordily talking at his selfness."
Roger creaked his neck to get a view at what could possibly have uttered such
garbage.  He got a view alright, though the seeing didn't make things any
clearer.  It was obviously meant to be a surgeon, for it wore the customary
green gown and surgical mask.  On the other hand, what surgeon usually wore
the gown backwards, revealing a pot belly with a tattooed inscription: "Worst
Surgeon of the Year 545-560."  Also, the glasses with the lighthouse lenses
didn't exactly help Roger's faith , and neither did the fact that through the
lenses could barely be seen two dark eyes swivelling about in all directions.
His chubby face was thick with deep lines from continuous squinting.  Roger
quietly swallowed a large lump of fear in his throat.  It tasted awful.

The surgeon slowyly maneuvered towards the operating table where Roger lay
securely strapped down.  Twenty minutes later, with nothing left standing, the
Doctor finally arrived.  "Whew ! Almost didn't reachify my table.  And how are
we feeling today ?" he asked Roger's feet, patting them as he did so.
"My my ! That's quite a nose you have there !  Would you like it removed ?"
"Er...I'm over here actually !" called Roger from the other end of his body.
"Aha ! You cheeky little moveable Devil, you !  What's it going to be then ?"
"Well, how about a short back and sides, with a little blow wave across the
top ?"

"I don't think so, my friend !" came a booming voice from the viewer's
gallery.  It was the unmistakeable voice of Farquar T. Thunderbolt.  "None of
your slimy tricks will get you out of here.  You should be honoured that you
are going under the knife of our planet's finest surgeon."
"I thought you said you were all advertising men !  Where did you get a doctor
from ?  What's his qualifications ?" shouted Roger.
"Well, he's not actually trained, but he's seen every episode of Quincy three
times, and he's seen half of Ben Casey MD, Dr. Kildare, Veterinarian's
Hospital, St. Elsewhere and Doogie Howser !  If that's not training, I don't
know what is !  But enough of this mindless chatter.  Doctor Lotsablud, I want
you to remove this man's brain !"
"Yes !  My operation that is favourite !"  Dr. Lotsablud began madly
scrambling around, checking equipment, pushing buttons and insane laughter
filled the chilly air.

Roger struggled futilely against the cowardly bonds that tied him down.
"You can't do this, you fiend !  You'll never get away with it !"
"Oh, won't I ? " laughed the evil Farquar.  "And who's going to stop me ?"

If Farquar had the relevant statistics at hand, he might have chosen his words
more carefully.  A recent survey conducted by the Volvuxian Couch Potato
Society proved conclusively that more rescue attempts are made after the words
"...who's going to stop me ?" have been spoken (usually by the villain), than
any other phrase.

A muffled explosion echoed through the labyrinthine halls.  Shouts, gunfire,
more explosions and general chaos.  The surgery doors burst open and at least
seven men swathed in black flung themselves headlong into the room.  At their 
head was a familiar figure....short....plenty of space around him....a 
strange hazy gas that seemed to follow him....CHADWICK !!!

"Never fear, Roger !" shouted Chadwick as his men tied the Doctor up.  Roger
looked into the viewer's gallery and saw the plump figure of Farquar T.
Thunderbolt hitting a large red button before running from the booth.
"Quick Chadwick, " urged Roger. "He's sounded the alarm !"
Chadwick looked unconcerned, and slowly examined his fingernails.
"Don't worry, Colonel, we disconnected the alarm system before we came in."

Predictably, just as this rash statement was spoken, the alarms went off, like
a convention of really keen firemen.  The alarms clanged loudly and Chadwick's
face took on the look of a the guy who swapped accidentally all Saddam's 
bullets with blanks.  "Or maybe it was the coffee dispensers...." he said
softly.  
"I'll deal with you later !" warned Roger, wiggling an admonishing finger at
Chadwick's downfallen face.  "How do we get out of here ?"  A new voice
answered him.
"I think I'd better take over from here."  One of the anonymous figures in
Chadwick's rescue removed the black mask covered his head.  A full head of
shiny bronzed hair tumbled down around his shoulders ? His ? No way ! This was
definitely a HER !  Roger, being a complete loon, fell instantly and hopelessly
in love.
================================================================================

ask HIM for ROCKET ROGER !  It's MY STORY !!  He's getting a bit cheesed off !

=================
Episode Fourteen
=================
In the last heart stopping episode Roger had fallen in love with the
mysterious woman who saved him from a frontal, backal and sideal lobotomy.
The rescue bid was headed by Chadwick, the most useless sidekick since Barney
'Blind as a deep sea fish' Bolowski took up archery as a social sport.  Well,
at least Chadwick hasn't killed anyone - yet.  The rescue went slightly wrong,
since Chadwick disconnected the coffee machines instead of the alarm system.
==============================================================================
Roger did his best guppy impression as the alarms clanged.  She certainly was
ravishingly beautiful, and ravishing was only one of the things on Roger's
mind.  This was no bimbo, no mindless concubine.  This was a woman to grow old
with, to raise a family with, to play 'Hide The Sausage' with several times a
week.  Chadwick ran over to Roger, grinning like a maniac.  Roger turned his
attention to the very embarassing fact of who had just rescued him.

"Oh boy, Colonel, I bet this is the first time a Hero has ever been rescued by
 a sidekick !  I can't wait to tell all my friends back home."
"I doubt your slug collection will much care to hear this tale, and if you
breath one word of this to any human being, I'll see you flung into deep
space, got it ?  As far as I'm concerned, I've just been rescued by ..... "
He turned to the beautiful woman, "...her ! *sigh* "

She turned to face Roger and strode casually towards him.  She smiled, and
slapped Roger hard across his blushing cheeks.  "You may call me Trist, and I
suggest you don't even bother trying your luck, Hero boy.  I've sworn a vow of
celibacy until our society is free of that cancerous leech, Farquar T.
Thunderbolt, who moves slyly upon us with his evil 'Gummo bubblegum' and the
insidious 'Wacko.'"
Roger opened his mouth to say something, but seeing the expression on Trist's
face, thought better of it.
"You have only been rescued," continued Trist "because this brave and handsome
fellow believes you can help us."  Brave and handsome ?  Who was she talking
about ?  Could it .... nah ... maybe .... Chadwick ?!

Chadwick scrunched up his face to reveal something quite like a bulldog after
sixteen failed plastic surgery operations.  He smiled up at the motherly
figure of Trist, who returned a mischievous grin.  It was like watching
Quasimodo making gooey eyes at convention of cover girls.
"Oh good grief, " thought Roger. "I've been beaten to her by a man who
thinks...well, actually he doesn't think at all !"

"Er...glad to help."  was all Roger said as he picked himself up off the
floor.  "Good !" replied Trist as she made her way back to the door.  "Come
on.  The guards will be here soon and our base is many hours journey from this
place."

The group made their way into the corridor.  It was like any other corridor in
an advertising agency, lined with self-praising posters showing successful
campaigns from the past.  The famous "His Pants For Her" followed by "Her
Pants For It", "Its Pants For Rover" and "No Pants For Nudists."  (You
probably have to be an Aussie to follow that last gaglette.)  The deep pile
carpet, made from the hair of competitors after various spectacularly
successful takeover bids, was thick enough to muffle their footsteps.  Alas,
as they progressed confidently through the maze of halls, a mysterious
trapdoor opened up and swallowed the other members of the rescue group,
leaving only Roger, Chadwick and Trist.  This was no coincidence, as the
author can't waste lines writing about five other guys in black trudging about
all the time.  Best just to kill them off, and stick with the main plot, I
reckon.

"Where are we going ?" asked Roger.
"We are leaving the domain of the evil Farquar T. Thunderbolt and heading for
the domain of the good, kind and generous King Kwikker-Kooker."
"Look, this advertising thing is getting ridiculous !" exclaimed Roger.  "Do
all your political divisions sound like they'd go "Crispily crunchily golden-
brown after just fifteen minutes in the family oven ?"  Trist turned and gave
Roger a look that would have made Frankenstein quiver back to the kitchen for
a cuppa.

"Those are ancient and noble names handed down for generations since the Great
Arrival.  Since that time, many heroic feats have been performed to make our
world as it is today.  Brave Promo-etheus stealing the plans of fire and
finding out if people want it inserted nasally !  Clever Gallup and his forty
copy boys discovering just what colour the wheel should be !  Yes, Colonel,
our world is not like your Earth, but we are proud of what we have become !
Our world is a united one, living peacefully under the banner of Sales,
Advertising and Marketing." She made a religious looking gesture when intoning
the last three words.
"Then why are you trying to overthrow F.T. Thunderbolt ?"

"Because he's a blaspheming heretic !  He is trying to work without Marketing,
and is undercutting everyone else.  Just because there aren't any people on
this planet who don't work for an advertising agency, doesn't mean you can
skimp on the Market Research !  As our Holy Book sayeth 'Researchest thou
thine market, yea,  even to discover which colour is desired to anoint a
simple wheel.  Skimp not on this vital Holy task or shall thy face be
smothered in egg when sales sink lower than the deep end of the last swimming
pool in Hell.' That is how the Law is written and must be followed by all."

"Look Trist, you're a real nice girl and everything, but this guy Thunderbolt
isn't playing marbles !  He tried to cut my brain out just to make me a
suitable market research candidate !  He's way out of my league, and I really
prefer being alive.  You meet more interesting people that way.  Anyway, it
looks like you're doing OK on your own.  A bit of industry, science, mindless
but evenly matched warfare and religious intolerance; all the hallmarks of a
good civilised society.  We wouldn't want to upset the balance, so I think me
and Chadwick will go steal a spaceship or something original like that.
"I don't think so, Roger." said Chad, standing firm.  "Trist needs our help."
"Yeah right, " said Roger strolling away.  "I'll do this one on my own then."
"Goodbye Roger." whispered Chadwick.  Neither saw the silent tear roll down
the other's cheek.

===============
Ep Fifteen
===============
In our last episode, the woman Roger fell in love with had just fallen in
love with Chadwick.  This revelation of this highly unlikely event was
followed by a dramatic parting scene, in which Roger decided to escape the
advertising world.  Chadwick has elected to remain behind to help the woman,
Trist, overthrow the evil empire of Farquar T. Thunderbolt.
=============================================================================
     Roger had wandered around for too many hours now, and his feet felt like
they'd been stamping on nails.  His stomach felt emptier than a particularly
deep bit of deep space, and his original plan of finding a spaceship was
looking in serious danger of being voted the worst plan since Cuthbert The
Mindless Twit tried using battle ants to attack Dwinkor, Lord of the
Anteaters.  He was lost, tired, hungry and (though he didn't know it yet)
about to enter a very ideologically unsound area of this otherwise stable
place.
     The particular part of the Kwikker-Kooker sector he had inadvertently
strayed into used to be the University.  This was where dangerous things like
'learning' and 'education' used to go on, before Good King Kopp Willbey banned
them.  He moved quickly through the dusty dark halls, fearing whatever hideous
beasts the author had planted to obstruct him.  Never fear, Roger, nothing so
obvious in this episode.
     The huge vaulted chamber Roger at the end of the corridor was the remains
of the library.  Nobody had trod the pine floors for decades at least and the
dust sat thick on the oak tables.  Roger approached one of the index analyzing
machines.

"On." he said, hoping the machine still worked.
"Shh !" remonstrated the machine.
"ON !" shouted Roger, hitting the machine in a very complex technical way.
"Silence in the library !" said the machine through clenched diodes. "Mime
your requirements."
"What ?  There's nobody here but me !" said Roger, looking for the switch to
turn off the 'Obstinate Librarian' mode.
"Mime, the art of, usage of, library, in.  See: French exports, pointless
exploits, excuses for wearing makeup, terminal idiocy, proper behaviour of
heroes in libraries." replied the uncaring machine, which was thoroughly
enjoying itself.

It was, of course, programmed to do so since librarians by their very nature,
(i.e small, quiet, shrew-like and likely to be bald by the age of forty five)
could never have the stamina and sheer guts to continually subject people to
the abuse librarians were expected to deal out daily.  Most only lasted a few
years before becoming suicidal/homicidal/psychotic/traffic wardens/all of the
above.
The final day for human librarians came on the day of the death of the last,
terminally overworked, human librarian.  It was a most unfortunate incident
involving thirty two copies of Shakespeare's complete works, a large pot of
Vaseline, and a crocodile farm.  They were replaced by the only thing that
could live up to the public's expectations of continual unwarranted abuse by
the librarian profession: the Index Analysing Machine.  It could cross
reference, alphabetize, correlate and interpret every index entry around the
world in two minutes flat...if it felt like (rarely), and it wasn't too busy
writing to the Board of Directors asking for more money (very rarely), and it
didn't tell you to try the Stockholm Institute for Training Bacteria to Play
Football's Anders Holstenwick Memorial Library (A. Holstenwick was the
greatest flagellum-bearing centre-forward in the Institute's history.), which
didn't happen too often (count the commas, we're still on track for a record
breaking sentence.).  Still, the IAMs were instantly recognized by the
library-going public to be the greatest achievement in getting libraries to
live up to their reputation since the invention of the 'Stick a metal tab in
your lunch bag' droid.
After only a few months in general use, the phrase " I annoy you therefore
IAM." was thrown around my desperate punners looking for material.

Roger set about trying to mime a spaceship.  He tried standing straight and
tall, spreading his arms out, but the IAM gave him a reference to the basic
beliefs of Christianity.  He tried jumping in this position, but was given the
code for the Superman collection.  He even tried farting to demonstrate rocket
power and received a reference to the biological disorder section.  This was
going nowhere fast.  His patience snapped and kicked the machine hard.
"Listen you rustbucket, I'm the only visitor you've had for hundreds of years
and your bloody mime games are pissing me right off !  Tell me where I can
find a spaceship on this navel-lint ball of a planet, or I'll bypass your
decision circuits and make you count every letter in every book ever
written...twice.

The IAM decided it had annoyed Roger long enough and told him that the only
spaceship on the planet belonged to Farquar T. Thunderbolt.  It sat atop his
huge skybreaker (not just a Skyscraper, a SkyBreaker) building.  However,
since Roger had just been rescued from F.T. Thunderbolt, he wasn't likely to
get it just by asking politely.  This was a definite bit of hard work coming
up.  It would have been good to have Chadwick here, even as a decoy to knock
out the guard dogs.

Meanwhile, Chadwick was enjoying life.  He believed that, in complete flagrant
disregard of all known laws of Human relationships, a beautiful woman named
Tristesse had fallen in love with him.  Naturally he was wrong and knew
something was a bit fishy when she kept asking him for skin samples.  His mind
didn't want to accept, however, that all was not hunky dory and he went on
believing they were both in love with each other.  After a couple of days, she
announced that she was ready to begin the final attack on Farquar T.
Thunderbolt's headquarters.  She carried a small glass vial of a repulsive
looking liquid.  When Chadwick asked what it was, she told him it was a deadly
poison derived from the multitude of noxious chemicals swimming about in and
all over his skin and that they would use it to kill F.T. Thunderbolt.  Chad
wasn't sure about this relationship any more.  It would have been good to have
Roger here, so he could understand when he was being insulted and humiliated.

Both parties started their journeys.  Roger packed whatever food he could
find, and a gun made from the internals of a library indexing computer.
Chadwick and Tristesse packed nothing but the vial containing the poison from
Chadwick's skin.  Farquar didn't stand much of a chance....or did he ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will Roger find the spaceship he so desperately needs ?
     Will Chadwick keep helping Tris in her assassination attempt ?
          Will there be another five week break till the next episode ?

Tune in (hopefully) next week for another installment of Rocket Roger !

===============
Episode Sixteen
===============
In our last late-breaking episode, Roger and Chadwick had both set out
towards the tower of the evil Farquar T. Thunderbolt, ruler of
the..erm...damn, I forgot to name his nation.  OK, let's go with Wacko Inc.
Roger was determined to steal Thunderbolt's spaceship, and Chadwick was half
an assassination squad, trying to kill F.T Thunderbolt, advertising genius and
general bad-guy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger trudged through a wasteland of ruined buildings and unkept streets.  A
shadowy figure caught his eye, and looking closer he saw a broken down old
man wearing the latest in post-holocaust fashion, shuffle up to him.
"Got any ?" said the man.
"Any what ?" replied Roger, slowly backing away, bravely making sure his
blaster was there.  (You never know with these old broken down men....)
"Wacko ! What else ?!" rasped the potential target.
"What's that ?" asked Roger.
"You mean you don't know ?! It's....well...it's...just...Wacko !" coughed the
old relic.  "Actually now that you mention it....I've never seen it !  I don't
even know what it is !  Ha ! Haha !"  This burst of clarity was obviously too
much for him and he collapsed to the dusty ground, dead as this plot.
Roger shrugged, searched the guy's pockets and moved on.

After many days travel, both teams arrived at the tower.  By sheer and utter
coincidence, in no way related to the fact that they are the only three
characters, they meet at the base of the tower.  It is shiny, gleamy and
topped with a sign bearing the 'Wacko' logo.  Tris was delighted to see Roger
again, even if she only wanted the specs for a gas mask to block out
Chadwick's unique aroma.
"Colonel Rogerson !  I see you've decided to join our Holy Quest to kill the
evil Thunderbolt and stop the spread of this horrible Wacko."
"I'm glad you mentioned that. This old fellow back there came up to me begging
for the stuff, then he couldn't tell me what it was !"

Chadwick piped up.  "It's a concept, Colonel.  There is no such thing as
Wacko, it's just a marketing campaign that spiralled out of control.  The
whole population of this country was killed by a burning desire to have
something that didn't exist !"
"That's unbelievable..." sniggered Roger.
"Believe it, Colonel," said Tristesse, "everyone in this building thinks Wacko
is real and will defend it to the death, except F.T Thunderbolt.  He runs this
whole campaign and is secretly building a huge starbase complex in orbit with
the profits.  Using this poison derived from Chadwick's skin, we will kill him
and bring his reign of terror to an end !"
(Ed.  The readers may be interested to know that this well-worn line represents
the one thousandth cliche used in Rocket Roger.  Yippee, hooray, party noise
and streamers.)

Roger decided to put his foot down.  He did so, quite hard, and tripped on a
stray bit of post 'Wacko induced' holocaust rubble.  Picking himself up, he
addressed this revolution-mad nutcase.
"You can stick your quest where you probably think the Sun shines out of.  No
way are you getting me to risk my life, which I rather enjoy, to knock off some
trumped-up ad exec with a Starbase complex." (Wow, a pun !)  Tris huffed,
turned and left dragging Chadwick with her.  Chadwick turned despairingly to
Roger, but he had already been dragged half way down the path towards another
entrance into  the forbidding building.  Roger himself had already blown the
door away, taking the subtle approach in only setting the blaster to 78.

He stepped through the smoking frame, hoping the molten droplets of steel
wouldn't mark his uniform.  He was inside the lobby, probably once beatiful but
now looking like a convent after a Hell's Angels 'Screwing, Slashing and
Sodomy' convention.  It was mostly junk and rubble but in one darkened corner
a flickering neon sign still flashed.  "The Dungeon" it proclaimed, "The most
torturous nightclub in the building !"  A door next to the sign still clung to
its hinges and Roger made his way towards it.  He didn't notice the light beam
he crossed.  Somewhere nearby, a door slid open and the Security Robot emerged.
It's first visitor in three hundred years, you'd think it would be pleased
that business was finally picking up.  Actually it was incredibly
claustrophobic due to being locked in its cubicle for three centuries.  It's
circuits had been locked into 'fashion check' mode. When it was built, the
current trend had been wearing underwear on your head and a strange purple suit
which looked like the skin of a mutant giraffe.  Roger was a little more
sensibly dressed, which was going to prove very painful for him.  The robot
scanned Roger, found him wearing underwear in the most curious of places, and
its warped circuits decided Roger obviously didn't need his head.  It also
decided to help him remove it.

He heard a curious grinding noise and turned to see a seven foot rust bucket
held together by sheer bloody-mindedness bearing down on him.  Bits fell of it
with every step, but sadly the weapon bits were hanging on tight.  Roger stood
his ground, and was reminded of the Debt Collector Droid from his last
adventure.  He wondered what the author had against robots, and why couldn't
Roger fight against, say, a killer bagel instead of something as severely
dangerous as a deranged robot.  "Can we talk about this ?" said Roger.
"Take off your head." came the robot's pretty determined reply.
"It doesn't come off !" said Roger.
"That's a matter of opinion !" replied the robot, rolling forward shakily.

The Debt Collector Droid had been easier than this.  He got out of it by making
the robot sing Kylie Minogue songs.  (It would take too long to explain, go read
it yourself.) In this case, that plan was as useless as explaining tact to
Salman Rushdie or tolerance to the Ayatollah.  Roger drew his hand-made blaster,
which sounds great except that Roger himself had made it out of the insides of a
uncooperative library computer.  He aimed and pulled the trigger.  The gun
didn't fire, but did give him a reference to a book called "How to Relate to
Rogue Robots" by A. Isimov.  He felt as safe as a rat in a All-Cat zoo.  The
robot cared nothing for obscure literature and rolled onwards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How will Roger escape the mad robot ?
    What are Chadwick and Tris up to ?
       Will the author be able to handle more than three characters ?

Tune in next week (or whenever another episode pops out) for another (another?)
rivetting adventure of Rocket Roger !!

=============
Ep Seventeen
=============
In the last episode, the moronic author had written himself and Roger into a
deep dark corner.  Roger was being threatened with having his unfashionable
head ripped off by an ancient security robot.  His blaster has failed, and
his sidekick, Chadwick, is nowhere to be seen or smelled.  Read on, Macduff.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger's panicking was getting a little ridiculous, and he reminded himself
that, being the hero of the story, he was brave and resourceful.  He looked
carefully at the robot and realized that brute force wasn't going to help.
He had to use his brains !  Aaagghh !  Well, stranger things have
happened...but not many.
"Hey robot !" snapped Roger.
The robot ground to a halt, not quite expecting a conversation.  It hadn't
spoken to anyone in centuries, so it decided a quick chat wouldn't be too
bad.
"When was the last time you thought about anything ?"
"Uh...well" cranked the robot, "It has been quite a long while."
"And what is your operational lifespan ?" asked Roger.
The robot said nothing for a few seconds, as if retrieving some long buried
memories.
"About thirty years, I think.  I should have retired centuries ago, come to
think of it."
"So in your official operational lifespan, you haven't actually thought about
anything."
"No, I s'pose not." said the dejected robot.
"So if we accept Descartes' premise of `I think therefore I am' then your lack
of thinking during your official lifetime means that you don't exist !"
"Well, um, yes I suppose you're right." came the rather surprising answer.
"I'll just be off then, OK ?" said Roger cheerily as he strode past a very
confused piece of hardware.
"Uh..sure..." said the robot.  As Roger left, the robot could be seen hitting
its head against the decaying walls, then asking the walls whether they felt
it.

Roger could see no other exits from the lobby, so he entered the cubicle the
robot had originally emerged from.  He found it to be a rather complex Inter-
Level Security Shuttle, which was basically a box that could move to any floor
in the buildiattached the seat belt (this is a community concious comic strip)
kicked over a pile of Playbot magazines and pressed the button for the top
floor, where he was sure he would find Farquar T. Thunderbolt.  Somewhere far
above the ancient motors creaked back to life and unleashed a fifteen gee burst
of acceleration.  Roger had neglected to remember that this cubicle was built
for a robot, and his guts were suddenly much closer to his ankles than was
medically advisable while his vertebrae toppled like domioes.  Luckily for 
Roger the stopping process was a little less arduous; only about fourteen point 
nine gees.  ("Ain't I a stinker?")
Roger staggered from the cubicle into a deserted but gleaming corridor and
collapsed onto the floor.  He felt a vibration through the floor.  They were
regular, like footsteps coming his way !  He struggled to his feet and
clambered into a nearby hole in the plot: a ventilation duct.  As he crawled
down it, he heard voices, which he followed to their source.  He was looking
onto a high-level meeting of advertising execs.

"Gentlemen, and token woman with no responsibility whatsoever, we are facing a
crisis !  Wacko sales have plummeted in the last three months and I want to
know why !"
The rest of the board looked around nervously. 
"Is it because everybody's dead ?" squeaked a suit with a head on top.
"DEMOGRAPHICS !!!" roared F.T. Thunderbolt.  "We're not pitching Wacko at
the...'dead' is such an awful word..let's say...the metabolically challenged."
Murmurs of agreement seemed to float from nowhere.  In fact, they floated from
hidden speakers that Thunderbolt had installed.  The sound of agreement seemed
to always make the sheepish board members follow him blindly, which is just how
he wanted it.

"I have an idea." said the token woman at the table.
"No you don't." replied Farquar.  "Go and make me some coffee."
With a strangely familiar glint, the woman strode from the office.  She seemed
to stare a the grille behind which Roger was hiding.

Farquard continued to speak.  "What we need is a new approach  (Murmur murmur).
A dynamic and forward looking new way to pitch Wacko to our beloved public 
(Murmur murmur).  A new campaign with all the old cliches thrown out the
window (Murmur murmur).  The first thing we'll need is.....a girl with big
ti.."

"Not so fast, Thunderbolt !"  It was Roger's heroic voice that saved the author
from a barrage of well-founded criticism.  He moved slowly around the table
towards Farquar, wielding his blaster like a nun wields a crucifix.  "Let's go,
Thunderbolt.  You're taking me to your spaceship."  Farquar withered under
the gaze of the weapon and they both left the room.  The rest of the board,
being utterly devoid of leadership ability remained in this room and discussed
the demographics of the dead until they snuffed it themselves.

A few minutes later Roger was staring at what he'd been searching for for the
last three episodes: a way out of this dead-end plot line.  It was shiny and
sleek and had no fluffy dice in the cockpit.  They went inside and that was
when Roger got a shock.  Waiting in the cockpit was none other than
Tristesse D'Arpeggio and Chadwick, his ex-sidekick !  "Hand him over, Roger"
said Tristesse.  "Or you will die with him !"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------





In our last controversial episode, Roger had forced F.T. Thunderbolt, evil
advertising megalomaniac to lead him to his spaceship.  But waiting for them
both were Tris, revolutionary assassin and Chadwick, Roger's ex-sidekick, the
bane of deodorant manufacturers everywhere.  Tris was pointing a loaded bottle
of poison at the intrepid but planless Roger.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Hand him over, Colonel.  The heretic Thunderbolt must die !"
"Lighten up, Tris !  Just give me five minutes, I need him to start the ship
for me.  It's matched to his thumbprint."  So saying he dragged himself and
Thunderbolt up the landing ramp, moving with the grace of two epileptic lobsters
in a strobe light factory.  
"Not so fast, Rogerson !" shouted Tris, who, in her extreme revolutionary
paranoia, thought Roger was running for it, ran to the ramp and seized Roger's
neck.  He kept his grip on Thunderbolt and the three of them, successively
joined at the elbow/neck joint slowly pivoted their way up the creaking
gangplank, like a caterpillar with absolutely no coordination....in snowshoes.
Once inside the ship, events took a turn for the believable.  F.T Thunderbolt
reluctantly started the ship up and with Chadwick safely as far from the 
air-conditioning as possible, Roger, Tris and Chadwick strapped themselves in 
for lift off.
As the ship automatically navigated towards the Starbase Roger and Tris
unstrapped and they released Chadwick.  Thunderbolt was still strapped down
tight.
"Alright Rogerson, I've kept my part of the bargain.  Give me Thunderbolt for
the rest of the flight and my revenge will be complete !"
"God, enough with the cliches already !  Take him, take him !"

With a look that most professional wrestler's would kill to make, Tris
unstrapped the flabby F.T Thunderbolt and escorted him into a small room near
the back of the ship.  She took only herself and a thorough working knowledge 
of pain in the human body.  Farquar T. Thunderbolt was in for a rough time.
The ship drifted closer to the now visible Starbase and it was pretty damn
impressive.  Lots of shiny silvery domey futurey kind of bumps and bits
glittered expensively in the twinkly cliched starlight; just like NASA wish
they could make the boring, boxy 'toilet-roll' appearance of their orbiting
Lego set look like.  

As the ship nestled into the docking bay, Tris emerged from the back room
dragging F.T. Thunderbolt with her. He looked like Death warmed up, then frozen
again, microwaved for ten minutes, soaked in Liquid Plumber, diced, broiled in
a light barbecue sauce and stuck back together with Superglue.....followed by a
swift kick in the family jewels for good measure.  He wasn't saying much, but
the look on what was left of his face said more than enough.
They all entered the Starbase and cautiously entered the entrance to the entry
hall.  It was uniformly white with no furniture.  At the far end was what
appeared to be an elevator door.  Seeing no alternative they all stepped in.

Elevators are one of the most fascinating phenomena in the Universe.  They are
all secretly constructed with a special Personality Nullifier Field which
changes the mindset of anyone passing through the doors.  As an example if you
put the Ayatollah, Salman Rushdie, Rabbi Lev Goldstein and the Pope in a TV
studio, they'd happily kick the living shit out of each other on Live TV !  But
if you forced them into an elevator they'd move apart like negative point
charges, shuffle their feet and examine their shoes without saying a word. 
This is absolute proof of the mystical power of elevators and don't tell me you
haven't seen it yourself !  This is what Roger & Co. were stepping into.  

As the doors schloofed closed, Chad, Roger and Tris' necks turned to jelly and
they had to look down.  They started counting the scuffs on their shoes, 
thinking about the mail they had to answer and completely forgot about their 
prisoner.  When the lift stopped they were alone.  The mysterious elevator
force had make monkeys out of all of them.  For Chadwick, the new simian look
was a big improvement, but Roger wasn't used to it.
"What sort of a plot twist was that ?!  He can't even think of a clever
realistic way of escaping, so he invents a weird force to explain it !  Too
much Twin Peaks I think...."

The author completely ignored Roger's childish whining and continued.....
The trio emerged from the lift and found themselves (Oh THERE you are !) in a
dressing room.  It had wooden benches, grey lockers, various supportive
underwear type devices and the customary sweaty damp ambience.  A small speaker
in the ceiling played an advertising jingle.  "Da da doo doo da da DA ! 
Welcome to the game, you'll have a great time, until you're crushed down to the
size of a dime !  Welcome to the game, it's really a scream !  The
audience will love ya when they see....your....spleen !" A short silence was
followed by the one voice nobody wanted to hear.

"Welcome my friends, this is Farquar T. Thunderbolt, your All-Powerful Games
Master !  Choose a locker, get dressed and go through the door marked 'The
Dante Room'.  I think we'll all enjoy this....especially me ! *evil cackle
which cannot be spelled*."
"You fiend, Farqaur !" shouted Roger.  "What kind of sick game is this ?!"
"It's not sick." explained Farquar.  "It's The Fight Game !  The best gameshow
in the history of gameshows !  All you have to do is fight your way through my
maze and I'll let you live.  And if you don't make it through...well, I'll do my
best to torture what's left of your earthly remains.  *another slightly less
evil but still very scary cackle that still can't be spelled*."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will Roger enter the Fight Game ?
   Will Don King try and promote him ? (No ! Not the Chernobyl Haircut !)
      Will Chad & Tris ever speak again ?

==========
Episode 19
==========
In the last over-budget episode Roger, Chadwick and Tris had been captured by
the advertising bastard, Farquar T. Thunderbolt.  In his orbiting torture
satellite, our heroes are being forced into 'The Fight Game.'  What horrors has
Thunderbolt got planned for them ?  Will they choose the money or the Ankle
Spike Reebok treatment ?  Will they get the two-week vacation on Vega Six ?  Or
will they be mutilated beyond recognition ? Place your bets and read on....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first door loomed large in front of them.  It bore no markings save a brass
plaque with the inscription "Dante Room: Abandon All Hope All Ye Who Can't Make
Up Good Room Names."  Roger didn't like the sound of that.  He would much prefer
the sound of the Titan Secondary School Cheerleader Squad after a few beers too
many, but they were nowhere to be seen.  (Well, they were somewhere to be seen,
but it sure wasn't here !) Since they were in a locker room of sorts, he decided
to see if there was anything useful in the many lockers around the place.  Tris
and Chadwick joined him, but the only thing they could find was three sets of
purple wigs, leather jackets and a lyric sheet for "Anarchy in the UK" by the
Sex Pistols.
"Looks like a setup to me, " said Roger, "but you never know what you'll need in
this crazy place.  Put them on and hope we're not walking into a Richard
Clayderman concert."

They opened the huge door and were almost knocked back by a blast of heat and
noise.  At the foot of the door, leading one hundred feet across a Hell-like
chasm of fire, was a rickety wooden bridge.
"We don't have much choice, let's go." said Tris, stepping lightly on the
fragile looking structure.  As the others followed her, the door, not
surprisingly, slammed itself behind them with a ringing cliche, leaving them but
one direction to travel.  Still it looked safe enough......

"Welcome to the Dante room, contestants !"  It was the voice of F.T.
Thunderbolt.  "Doesn't look to tough, does it ? Hmm... tell you what, let's make
it more interesting **evil cackle that can only be spelled in Rumanian** !"  A
panel in the roof slid back and a fat figure began to emerge.  It was a woman
who had partaken of far too many truckloads of doughnuts.  She was dressed as a
Valkyrie, with pigtailed blonde hair, a large shield in one hand and a spear in
the other.  As she was lowered further and further it dawned on Roger that the
bridge could never take her weight.  Unless she stopped, they were doomed....
Luckily, she stopped, and it was here that the machinations of F.T Thunderbolt's
fiendishly twisted mind became apparent.  Clenched between her shining teeth was
the other end of the rope !  If she opened her mouth, they'd all be barbecued.

"Meet Ms. Germania Von Michelin !" laughed Farquar.  "I found her at Madame
Butterfly's Home for Insane Prima Donnas.  I'm sure you'll find her particular
form of insanity quite amusing.  If she sees people, anybody at all, she'll
think they're an audience and start singing one of those awful Bavarian folk
songs.  It'll be her swan song, or in this case, overweight buffalo song, but
it'll be such FUN ! *evil cackle that would put the Wicked Witch of the West to
shame and is utterly unspellable*"

"The only thing that can stop a culture vulture of that size is punk music !"
said Roger.  "Start screaming !"  As they all looked onto the lyrics sheet, and
accompanied by appropriate air guitar solos and head banging routines they began
to inch their way over the bridge.
"I am an Anti-Christ !" Von Michelin's eyebrows shot up in disgust.
"I am an anarchist !" She disdainfully wrinkled her nose and grinded her teeth.
"I know what I want and I know how to get it !" Her grinding teeth began to chew
through the rope, but they were halfway there.
"I want to destroy passers by !"  The rope began to weaken under the attack by
the teeth that had chewed a thousand takeaway burgers.
"Run !" shouted Tris.  They charged along the rickety span towards the archway
on the other side.  But their singing had stopped and Germania Von Michelin
suddenly found herself on stage again !  Time to sing, ja !
"Jump !" yelled Roger as he realized that the bridge was about to be assaulted
by 600 pounds of Teutonic womanhood.  They all leapt off the bridge just as the
open chorus of "Hans, Find Me a Big Knackwurst" had been warbled.  As they
landed amongst each others tangled limbs and bruised bodies they heard the
bridge and Von Michelin tumble into the fiery chasm.  "That was close, " said
Chadwick, "nobody ever survives the second verse of that song."

They had landed in an ante-room.  In one corner sat Roger's Auntie Mildred, in
another sat an ancient crone wearing a revolutionary headband and weilding a
huge knitting needle and in the third sat an orangutan, who Chadwick seemed to
be studiously avoiding.
"So.  The old ante-room gag strikes again." murmured Roger as he wondered what
would happen next.  Here's where things get groovy.  There are three plain
doors in this room.  The first is labelled "The Prune Room", the second is
"The Moon Room" and the third is "The Dune Room."  Which door will the intrepid
group take ?  And what about the orangutan ?  It's just the those crappy books
everyone used to muck around with except you can't turn back if you die, 'cos
The Scribe is in charge.  Submit your votes tattoed on the left buttock of any
Playmate Of The Year from 1987 onwards, or just send e-mail.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will this daring experiment get any answers ?
   Will Roger be ignored by you lot and have to ask the orangutan for advice ?
      Will your advice be any better ?
=============
Episode Twenty
=============
The avalanche of votes received by this author seem to indicate an obsession
with dried fruit unfairly harnessed with a reputation for bowel shifting.  The
humble prune will be the centrepiece of this episode.  Aboard the orbiting
Starbase, Roger & Co. have thrown themselves on the creative forces of the
readers.  How will they fare in 'The Prune Room' ?  Harken to my tale.....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Chadwick, come here, I've got a plan." said Roger.
Chadwick waddled over looking happier than a cat in a rest home for paraplegic
pigeons.  "Am I important now ?  Am I in the plan ?" he gasped.
"More than that, little chum.  You are the plan !"  replied Roger smiling
graciously.  "Stand next to the door. " he said. "Now, bend over and close your
eyes." As Chadwick did so, Roger pushed the door opened and shoved Chadwick
inside with his boot.  "That should take of them." said Roger to the unbelieving
Tristesse D'Arpeggio.
"What do you mean 'them' ?" scolded Tris.  "He might be slaughtered in there !"
"Nothing with a nose can frighten Chad.  When he gets nervous, he sweats like a
sumo wrestler on holiday in the Sahara Hilton when the air conditioning breaks
down.  He's a human smell grenade !"

A soft knocking from the other side signalled that either the room was safe or
that the inhabitants were smart enough not to get near Chadwick.  As Roger
slowly pushed the door open the sounds of pain and moaning drifted through.  A
smell of torture and sweat, a wall lined with mirrors, the sound of a crappy
Jazz-Aerobics cassette.  No doubt about it, this was a health farm. Our brave
heroes strode in to meet the foe.

The foe presented itself rather politely.  It consisted of a rather shapely gym
instructor wearing a purple shoelace wrapped strategically around herself.
"Excuse me, but where is the exit ?" asked Roger, wondering where the danger
was, besides the possibility of someone walking on his tongue if this woman
stayed nearby for too long.
Instead of turning into a seven dimensional Star Chewer or ripping off her face
to reveal a battery of Blazzoom 450 Flesh Piercer missiles, she did something
rather unexpected: she answered him.  "Yeah, down the back, past the showers,
second on the left."  She jogged away and Roger's eyes jogged after her.
"Oh. " said Tris. "That was easy." She and Chadwick began to walk the
deceptively safe path towards the exit.  Roger shrugged his shoulders and
followed.
The group passed a bevy of fat businessmen, busily sweating and grunting their
bodies through a barrage of tendon bending, fat burning, money wasting
exercises.  "Excuse me, but is this really a gymnasium ?" said Roger to an exec
whose headband was obviously there to hold his toupee in place.
"Yes.  It might be.  I think.  Am I ?  I am.  I reckon.  Why not ?  Pinball."
replied the baggy-eyed one.
"Thank you." replied Roger, thinking how intelligent middle management had
become over the past decades.  A speaker on the ceiling crackled and delivered a
message.  It was the voice of Farquar T.  Thunderbolt, mad advertising genius
and the builder of this orbiting prison/joke.
What hideous plan was he about to describe ?  How would he choose to humiliate
and torture our Heroes ?
Actually, in hindsight, the two words he spoke didn't seem to constitute much of
a threat.  "Prune time" is not really recognized by any sentient species as a
threate of dire consequences.  The strangest threat in existence comes from the
Convatty Knids of Yamma Epsilon.  They live in a shell which is impervious to
all known attacks, except one vastly improbable sequence of events.  Thus the
Knids only insult, now a famous and well-respected tradition,  runs as follows:
"May a pregnant Varg Beast leap over your shell and release 14 milliliters of a
solution consisting of six parts uranium triophosphate, 2 parts copper flouride
and 1 part pureed Kvart brain, at an angle of 62.3 degrees, thus passing through
your anterior chamber, over the guarding rim and nestling above your third brain
and thus causing you to believe you are an electric toothbrush inspector."  More
maverick Knids run against tradition and substitute a 54.6 degree angle.  This
has provoked the older Knids to fits of rage, who hurl the original insult back
at the young mavericks, who retort with their new variation.  As you can see,
Knid debate is slightly less interesting than the view inside a coffin.  But,
back to the action......

"Prune time !" shouted F.T Thunderbolt.  All the would-be athletes froze, then
slowly made their way towards a strange octopus like machine.  When they were
all within its reach they opened their mouths.  Its arms reared up and dashed up
against the open mouths and began to pump a purple slush into them.  After a
minute of this the arms detached and the victims stampeded towards the bathroom.

This was all very curious, but Roger still didn't see the danger.  He's about to
meet it, as I shall explain.  The purple slush is a concentrated prune solution
that is so powerful, it removes brain tissue while opening the bowels up.  In
the past months the chamber beneath the toilet block has filled up with a
mixture of brains and prunes.  F.T. Thunderbolt has worked a fiendish plot and
the mixture has come to life: Prunus Sapiens.

As Roger, Chad and Tris wandered towards the exit an innocuous liquid dribbled
from beneath the door.  "What's that ?" asked Chad as he stupidly opened the
door.  A wave of purple slime crashed onto the whole group and exciting 'fight'
music began to play.  A steel slab crashed behind them, sealing them in a tiny
space with no way out.  The Prune slime was knee deep and gripped them with an
insane ferocity, holding them down as the mixture climbed higher and higher. 
Roger quickly searched his pockets for some high-tech anti-Prune hardware, but
found that the author (being a git) had forgotten to write about any.  Uh oh.

"I've got it !" shouted Roger.  "Tris, where's the poison you were going to use
to kill Thunderbolt ?!"  He was referring to the ultra-toxic reagent made from
the numeous noxious substances that Chadwick excreted.  
Tris reached into her pocket and retrieved the deadly liquid.  She pulled off
the top and poured it into the purple gunge that was threatening to crush
Roger's favourite bit of his body.  The slime's grip loosened immediately and
it began to spasm and twitch randomly.  It shook itself into dozens of pieces,
which gradually congealed and hardened and generally died.

"Lucky you remembered that." gasped Tris as she staggered through the exit that
mysteriously appeared in one of the walls.  "We were nearly..." she gulped,
"...written out !"  "Nah, it was obvious.  The writer didn't give us any secret
weapons, so he resorted to using Chadwicks repulsiveness...pretty woeful,
really. OUCH !!" yelled the ungrateful bugger as my hand tweaked his nose.

The new room was another waiting room.  Three doors were set in the far wall,
awaiting the readers' votes on which should be used.  Will it be the Tune Room,
the Broom Room or the Hoon Room ?  Your votes will help write the next episode,
and, by gum, it needs all the help it can get.  Send your votes on a hundred
dollar bill, or e-mail.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will Roger keep whining about the pathetic endings ?
    Will the readers flood me with hundred dollar bills (or just votes) ?
       Will anyone send a bill for a hundred dollars in an attempt to be funny?

All these questions are utterly irrelevant, as is the next episode of:
