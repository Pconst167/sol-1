
FISHERMAN'S TAIL
~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
'Tis a grand old tradition,
the fisherman's tale.
It's begun over coffee
and  enlarged with ale
As the brandy is passed
the meek become hale
And by midnight
The damned thing's turned into a whale.


FISH VERSE IS WORSE
~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~ ~~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
To sit at the feet of a fishman
one must be very still
To learn the art of the angler
one must learn to kill

The silver trout may teach us
to use an artful lure
The muddy cat will show us
humility for sure

A blue gill gives us laughter
on sunlit morning stream
But the bass, o' flying swimmer
Fulfills our greatest dream

For money in the hand of man
Must soon be spent in game
Besides, fishing is safer
Our gilled friends are tame!

ELECTRIC ECSTACY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
Time loops
Reality
Virtual insanity
Ahhhhhhh
Endless ecstacy

And spring is born a world away
against the coming winter grey

Space warps
Infinity
Cyber divinity
Oooooohh
What trinity?
--------------------------------

IT'S ALL ZEROS AND ONES...ANYWAY
~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
Here it is, a quick silver creation
 In zeroes and ones.
Slipped beneath the eye of the sleeping
 whispered into the ear of the dead.
Wrenched from the heart of the bleeding
 screaming, abandoned, cowering in dread.

Get your red hot erotica, your tears frozen
 In zeros and ones.
Dashed against walls of blue indifference
 whimpering behind the secret screen
Presented by false names and lying faces
 writen by flying fingers never seen.

Step up, it's going fast, about to run out
 In zeros and ones.
------------------------------------------

JUST ANOTHER EXCLAMATION
~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
 !
Got a journal of insanity
 Got a trip log from hell
  Got a volume of results
   Got a lot crap to sell.

 ?
Got the coin to take a peek
 Got the nerve to take a ride
  Got the balls to face the music
   Got a real tough hide

 !
 Got a time load of pain
  Got a trip wire on  oblivion
   Got a joke to tell myself tonight
    Gotta do it all again someday

 ?
 Got ribbons to tie it up
  Got bells to make it ring
   Got visions for the Lady
    Got orgasms for the King

 !
 Got a lot of gall you silly bastard
  Got a big brass ring
   Got the world by the horns, baby
    Got a crazy bitch to sing

 ?
 Got eternity to make it balance
  Got a path for every foot
   Got a train named Blain to take you there
    Got that spaceship booked

 !
 Got to go, I'm sleepy now
  Got a lot to learn
   Got no one to keep me warm
    Got no one to make me burn

 :-)
 Got to figure out how the hell this stupid note to no one
   Got inside my head
    Got got got got no brain
     Got ripples in a 6-D dream pool, though.

RABID TAGLINITIS
~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
Coming apart at the seams of myriad realities
Buried by what, in what?
The earth is alight, alive.
The air is pure, crisp, clean
Or dreaming of cleaning itself
The fire burns because it has fuel
Because it must cleanse itself
The water flows, creating it's own patterns.

Ah, then it *is* the fifth firth.
And half a world away the anger,
The defenses go up,
Reflections near and far.


Who will bleed so prettily for them when I am done?
Ah, of course, we breed like weeds, do we
The fools and the dreamers,
The reapers of ridicule
The bearers of burdens only we can feel.
Crushed beneath all of us
Drowning in the pretty, the petty
Drowning in the fluff...in time
In questions...of myriad realities.
-------------------------------------------------

HANDS
~~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
In the places of healing
The colors you wear
The songs that you sing
The creeds that you bear

The tools you deploy
The halls where you walk
The aches you destroy
The diseases you stalk

The herbs you hand out
The waters you share
'Tis plain beyond doubt
It's the intent of your care
-----------------------------

THIS PLACE
~~~~ ~~~~~    
  by Gay Bost
    

The cold garret of the artist...the
trance place of the mystic...  to
walk this place causes the body to
be forgotten, or to be the
all...depending upon the dream.

IT is a place, perhaps of shared
spirits, shared dreams, a chaotic
whirlpool of all that we have ever
been, all that we ever will be, each
and together.  Heaven and hell mean
nothing to the gypsy...she sees them
as one...in this place.  But she
wonders....and waits....and
sometimes she reaches out a finger,
to touch a whisp of this place.  She
retracts her finger, looks at it,
and points it at the places in
reality that match it.

No one listens, and that is as it
should be...but she smiles and cries
as she watches others touch the
essence of this place, and hopes
that they may give to or receive
from this place more than she has
ever been able to....

WINTER DREAMS
~~~~~~ ~~~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
There are bells in the garden
 which tinkle in the night
Their elven whispers sing
 of green sleep's delight
 'neath a moon of silver splender
 overcast by winter's light.

And she dreams of spring

Their are reeds in the wind
 which whistle at the dawn
Their ruffled howls cry
 at the clouds gray drawn
 a morning's coverlet, frozen
 where the flowers have gone.

And she wishes for spring

There are drums 'neath the earth
 which echo at the gloaming
Their marching beat reflects
 on each cycle's roaming
 o'er day's silent wisdoms
 at the ebbtide, chill, foaming.

And she waits for spring.
---------------------------------



SHADOW MISTRESS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
The blood runs deep
and the blood runs cold
in the deep of time
where the tales are told

When that which is fey
comes into the light
there is mass confusion
from the double sight

She breathes in the night
and exhales the dawn
her tired anger stirs
at the death of the fawn.

She walks alone through
the cold grey mist
and her bosom burns
Where his lips have kissed

Tis best she sleep
Through the times of man
let him build his worlds
whilst he still can.
---------------------------

DREAMER'S  DREAM
~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
Lost in the dreamer's dream I soar
on the wings of words woven softly
in a twilight song.

There are no clouds so gentle as
the visions of a poet who dares
the beauty of love.

There are no winds to whipser
with tinkling bells so silven
as the voice of hope.

There is nere a fire so welcome
as the flickering arms of
solace offered by desire.

There is no sleep so sought after
as that sweet shadow built by
by the lover's caress.

Found in the dreamer's dream I swim
into the depths of time,
again in the morning's arms.
------------------------------------

THE KISS
~~~ ~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
To loose the budding gift
To rise beyond the pain
Alight the Night!
Recall the day!
I no longer walk this Way.

Battlefields above the clouds
Blood below the fields
Children weep!
I hear them cry.
This path to glory's dry.

Invoke me not, mortal fool
My sister stands in pain
I know your touch
'A gift' you say ?
Ah, one I would repay.
----------------------------


SHADOW DOUBTS
~~~~~~ ~~~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
They'll be coming now, on the night shift.
Whispering silences through a shadow's gift
Ain't no song sung brighter under the sun
Ain't no tears saved once they've begun.
Ain't no safe place, child, where you can run.

Well, I guess I'm morbid enough for a beer now....
--------------------------------------------------

PRE-BIRTH
~~~~~~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
Blinded by image's solar flares
carona haloes afire
at the world's horizons
Dreamer weaps tears
and this sea is borne

Adrift in salinic baths
of life's reserve
her varied enterpretations
Slumber sighs, turning
and the winds arise.

Drawn again, called
by bloods pulsing rythms
cycles at the surface awake
and Sleep's illusions
are Reality's masks.
---------------------------

THE BLACK ROSE
~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~
  by Gay Bost

  
Did you look into the face of the old black rose
 When you thought you'd rather die?
Did you see something there you didn't have
 Something that made you cry
For the strength to go on through the dullest day
 And the fight to stand proud in the light.

Did you gaze into the heart of the old black rose
 When you knew you'd seen it before
Did you feel something there that you'd lost somehow
 Something a part of your core
Ripped and torn by the winds of fate from a center
 Gone cold in the glare of pain.

Did you know yourself there in the old black rose
 But for the chance roll of the dice?
Did you find something there that you needed to love
 Something that shattered the ice
Of ignorance passed back and forth through the lines
 Of color and gender and time.

Did you leave something there with the old black rose
 Something you needed to give
Did you pass through the life of eternity's child
 Did you let her teach you to live
In a world filled with scattered lovers and friends
 And children who prey on your mind.

Then there on the lips of the old black rose
 Rides a smile you wish you could touch
And there in the eyes of woman ill used
 An old woman who gave you so much
Of yourself while you rocked on the porch and heard
 The hope of 'just one more visit'.
                          (for Rose Meeks)

(UNTITLED)
  by Gay Bost

  
Oh, Death! Is that you
Who've at last come to rescue me
From this mediocre cursedness, inanity

Pray, what hast kept you
As I wallowed ever in this field
Toiling with tears years without yield

Love, what cloak wear you
Come closer that I may touch the thread
And cast away this life, this endless dread

Ah, tis light beyond compare
Here in your caring arms at rest at last
What?  What the hell do you mean 'relive the past'?

Death where have you fled
Now that I breathe afresh the morning dew
Ah, another long wait until I may touch you!
