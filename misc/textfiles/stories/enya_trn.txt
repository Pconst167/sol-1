Well, since my offer of this list of translations, I've gotten
several requests, so I decided to just post it and save everyone
(including myself :-)  ) lots of time.  So, without further ado,
I present the list of enya translations.  It was originally 
posted by Lyle Corbin.

   You asked this (common) question at just the right time, since I was just
   ready to post this to USENET.

   Please send me comments & etc.

  ===========================================================================

    English Translations of _The Celts_, _Watermark_, and _Shepherd Moons_.

  ===========================================================================

    The following is a compilation of translations taken primarily from
    USENET postings.  In the cases where multiple translations existed, I
    tried to pick the phrases that made the most (English) sense, and which
    flowed together the best.  The choice was often arbitrary, and not
    being a speaker of Irish (or Gaelic), Latin, or Welsh, I was not able
    to make my own judgements regarding the accuracy of translation.  Your
    comments, suggestions, and corrections are welcome.  Some of the songs
    have the lyrics compacted, where repeated phrases are only listed once.

    There are several songs, such as Ebudae, where when listening to the
    song it sounds like lyrics beyond what's printed are being sung.  If
    anyone is willing to transcribe any such lyrics (and, possibly,
    translate) then send them to me for inclusion into this document.
    Please be sure to send me both the original language text (with accents
    (fada) as appropriate) and the translation if you do.  (Information
    telling me that there is nothing there to translate would be useful too.)

    Finally, if anyone has editions of songs which were released on singles
    only, (i.e. not translated here) then feel free to send me transcriptions
    and translations for those as well.

    Enjoy!

    P.S.  If you happen to read this using a proportional font, the accents

  ============================== THE CELTS ==================================

 The text for this album was taken from the liner on a Japanese release by
     Jagg Groeg (crow@mundil.cs.mu.oz.au)

 Translations for these songs were provided by Fidelma McGinn.  Thanks!

    The mystical incantations throughout the songs were not translated
    as they have no English equivalent.

                         (Dedicated to Ridley Scott)


 Codladh Fada                               Long Sleep

   ,         ,     ,
 Siul liom tri an realta dearg.             Walk with me through the red stars

 Deireadh, deireadh an Turas                The end, end of the journey
  ,   ,    ,   ,
 Realtog, realtog dearg.                    Small stars, small red stars

  ---------------------------- I WANT TOMORROW ------------------------------

 Dawn breaks; there is blue in the sky.
 Your face before me though I don't know why.
 Thoughts disappearing like tears from the moon.

 Waiting here; as I sit by the stone
 They came before me, those men from the sun.
 Signs from the heavens say I am the one.

 Chorus

 Now I know; I can see your light,
 this light that I must follow,
 You -- you could take my life away
                   -- so far away.
 Now I know; I must leave your spell
                   -- I want tomorrow.

 (The above lyrics for the chorus are taken from those printed in the
  sleeve of the Japanese pressing by Jimco Records: following are the
  words which are almost undoubtably those actually sung)

 Chorus

 Now you're here; I can see your light,
 this light that I must follow,
 You -- you may take my life away
                 -- so far away.
 Now I know; I must leave your spell
                 -- I want tomorrow.

 Notes:

 (1) Samhna is a version of Samhan which is the name given to the first day
     of November.  This day was a very large feast in pagan, esp. Celtic,
     tradition.  Indeed, the Irish word for November is Samhain.  It was
     one of the most important festivals of the year.  Oiche Samhna is the
     Irish for Halloween.  (Aidan Hollinshead)

  --------------------------- CURSUM PERFICIO -------------------------------

 Cursum perficio                 I complete my journey (or my path)
 Verbum sapienti                 The word of the wise
 Quo plus habent                 The more they have [of it]              (1)
 Eo plus cupiunt                 The more they want [it]
 Post nubila, Phoebus            After the clouds, Phoebus [the god Sun] (2)
 Iternum                         (3)

Notes:

(1) My guess is that the thing "they" want in the 3rd and 4th lines is in fact
    the 'word of the wise' mentioned in the 2nd line, which, by the way, would
    also be in the correct case of the declination.

(2) Phoebus was one of the names for the Sun god, which may be more famous as
    Apollo (Greek). It is notable that the Sun is a male.

(3) The word 'iternum' does not exist; it could either be a misspelling for
    'eternum' (eternal), which is unlikely since it is very rare that an
    adjective be used as an adverb, or for 'iterum' (again and again) which is
    in fact an adverb and makes a little more sense (!!).

Finally, the meaning of 'cursum perficio' is actually best explained by the
footnote to the lyrics: Enya was inspired by these words she saw on Marylin
Monroe's last house, where they were taken to mean "my journey ends here".
It is a rather "free" translation, but it's probably a very good way to convey
the meaning of Latin, which has a way of saying things that is very distant
from modern-day English. The fact that those words turned out to be
prophetical only adds to the power of the song.

  the sheet music for this album.  These comments are available as the
  Enya Papers #22.


  ----------------------- HOW CAN I KEEP FROM SINGING? ----------------------


A verse is missing from the printed words on "How Can I Keep From Singing?"

The lyrics are all correct except after the second verse ("Through all the
   tumult and the strife...") add this verse:


                  While though the tempest loudly roars,
                  I hear the truth it liveth.
                  And though the darkness 'round me close,
                  Songs in the night it giveth.

                  No storm can shake my in-most calm
                  While to that rock I'm clinging.
                  Since Love is Lord of heaven and earth,
                  How can I keep from singing?


     Transcription by Jagg Groeg (crow@mundil.cs.mu.oz.au)
     (But you can get the words just by listening carefully!)

  Note:  There are several words that are a bit difficult to determine
          exactly what they are, but Jagg points out (and I agree) that
          of the possibilities, the ones here make the most sense. - Lyle

Notes:

"Ebudae" is a term that deals with sounds.

The last line seems to contain a misprint, since the phrase is definitely
  "anonn is anall", not "annon ...".  (Aidan Hollinshead)

  --------------------- BOOK OF DAYS (English Version) ----------------------


                     One day, one night, one moment
                     My dreams could be tomorrow
                     One step, one fall, one falter
                     East or West,
                     Over earth or by ocean
                     One way to be my journey
                     This way could be my
                        Book of Days


                     No day, no night, no moment
                     Can hold me back from trying
                     One flag, one fall, one falter
                     I'll find my day maybe
                          Far and Away
                          Far and Away


                     One day, one night one moment
                     With a dream to be leaving
                     One step, one fall, one falter
                     Find a new world across a wide ocean
                     This way became my journey
                     This day brings together
                          Far and Away

                     This day brings together
                          Far and Away
                          Far and Away.

Notes:  This version was produced for and released with the soundtrack for the
          movie "Far and Away", starring Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman.

        This version of the song has been released in place of the original
          version in recent pressings of _Shepherd Moons_.

Notes:

(1) Proper names I'm guessing--Umbriel, Ariel, Io, Vela.

(2) This is tough. "itur" is a poetic form, apparently.  The phrase
    may mean "without end" or "eternal". (Larry)

    'Et itur ad astra' means 'And we go to the stars'.  There is no way of
    putting into English the "impersonal" meaning of 'itur' which is actually
    the third person singular of the passive indicative present tense (sorry,
    but I do not really know how English scholars refer to tenses, hope it's
    clear enough) of the verb 'ire' which means 'to go'.  Since 'to go' cannot
    possibly be passive (I am gone?) the passive mode is taken to sound as
    done by everybody and nobody in particular at the same time, really like
    something that gets done but without specifying by whom. (Mauro)

    This phrase has been bothering me for some time - I was sure I'd seen it
    or something like it before.  Eventually I found it.  There is a phrase in
    Virgil's Aeniad which reads 'sic itur ad astra' which the translator noted
    as having the literal meaning 'thus you shall go to the stars' but the
    poetic, metaphorical meaning 'thus is immortality gained'.  So
    substituting 'et' (and, also) for 'sic' (thus, therefore) the translation
    might read along the lines of 'and you shall go to the stars' or, perhaps,
    'and you shall live forever'.  (Unknown)

(3) 'Vela' refers to a boat's sail.  It may well be a proper name, though.
        (Mauro)

(4) "mirabilia" (neuter plural) means literally "marvellous things";
    translated as the singular and differently--English likes to vary.

(5) "sempervirent" == "evergreen".

(6) I don't know how to translate "Rosetum"--a proper name or "rose garden", 
	which seems unlikely.

(7) Zephyrus is a warm west wind.

(8) Volturnus is a "river(?) in Campania", according to Cassell's Latin
    dictionary.  I don't understand the reference.

(9) Africus is the south-west storm-rain wind.

(10) The Etesians are winds that blow 40 days each year around
     the "dog days".

     "Etesiarum" is a general term for swirling winds "tease"ing each other.
     Eurus is the East wind; hence "Europe." NOTE--In Carribean Blue, the
     wind "Boreas" is mentioned; it refers to the North Wind; hence the
     Aurora Borealis.  (Graham)

(11) Eurus is the south-east wind.

(12) This is almost impossible to translate into English without doing
     damage to word order.  "mine is dear to me, its/his/her own is
     dear to each."

(13) "terrigena" is literally "earth-born creature," formed from the word
     for land, "terra", and race or kind, "genus." (Graham)

 --  It is apparent that most of Enya's Latin lyrics have been influenced
     by Virgil's Aeneid, since many of her phrases are those used by Virgil.

        I'm not too happy with the translation of the third line,
        but it's as good as I'm going to get.  'dilse' has quite a
        few meanings.  (Aidan)
