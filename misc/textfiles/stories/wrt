³   The writer carefully considered what he would write. He pondered the   ³
³ ideas as he sat waiting for his daughter to get off work. He thought of  ³
³ the setting he would use for his story. He carefully considered what he  ³

³   Later that night he sat down before his computer and glanced once      ³

³   He carefully, ever-so-carefully prepared the words that would make up  ³
³ the first page of the manuscript. This was the most important page, he   ³
³ had been told. Without getting this page just so, the material would     ³
³ never be read, would never be considered, would never receive so much    ³
³ as a second thought.                                                     ³

³ at his (supposed) humor as he typed the words, which in turn appeared    ³

³ ³   The writer carefully considered what he would compose. He pondered ³ ³

³ ³   He made sure the room was secure and no errant sounds would make   ³ ³
³ ³ their way to the pickup on the screen in front of him. He tapped the ³ ³
³ ³ record key and carefully, ever-so-carefully prepared the words that  ³ ³

³ ³   He sighed to himself as he paused and sipped the soft drink. He    ³ ³
³ ³ continued, but had to pause several times to scratch a persistent    ³ ³
³ ³ itchy nose. Pressing the backspace key, he watched as it erased the  ³ ³
³ ³ words on his screen, caused by the errant irritant. He chuckled at   ³ ³
³ ³ his (supposed) humor as he respoke the words, which in turn          ³ ³

³ ³ find its way down the screen, ready to add the words of the story    ³ ³

³ ³ ³   The writer carefully considered what he would write. He       ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ pondered the ideas as he sat waiting for his daughter to        ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ finish he day at work. He thought of the setting he would       ³  ³ ³

³ ³ ³   Later that night he sat down in his favorite chair, the       ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ composer next to him. He glanced once again at the screen in    ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ front of him. A wicked smile crossed his lips as he thought     ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ about the audacity of those that barred his way.                ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³                                                                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³   He picked up his headset, and tapped each of the sensitive    ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ pickups. The computer didn't like his actions, and beeped a     ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ sour note at him.                                               ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³                                                                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³   He cleared his conscious mind of any stray thoughts that      ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ might distract him and put the headset over the crown of his    ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ head. It reminded him of a small prayer cap he'd seen worn      ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ many, many years before. He couldn't remember the significance  ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³  of the cap and didn't care.                                    ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³                                                                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³   The screen reflected his random thoughts in patterns that     ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ made no sense. No mind. He hadn't given the all-important       ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ mental command to begin. He carefully adjusted the temple       ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ and frontal pickups and watched the screen bounce and glide     ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ images across it's face.                                        ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³                                                                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³   For amusement he pictured a pretty girl, then quickly         ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ replaced it with a view of his wife, sitting in front of the    ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ crafting machine that she used to sew, knit, darn, and          ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ crochet for her booth in the local craft store.                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³                                                                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³   Satisfied that everything was in place, he relaxed and        ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ cleared his mind.                                               ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³                                                                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³   "Begin," he uttered to himself. The screen snapped to a       ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ page-white display. "Prepare first page heading," he            ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ instructed and watched as the words appeared quickly on the     ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ screen.                                                         ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³                                                                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³   An errant itch distracted him, and as he scratched his nose,  ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ the words tore from side to side.                               ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³                                                                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³   "Damn," he swore to himself, and watched as the words turned  ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ shades of color, and faded from sight.                          ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³                                                                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³   "Begin," he reinstructed. He wouldn't let the errant          ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ irritant bother him again.                                      ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³                                                                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³   He sighed to himself as he lipped the soft drink straw and    ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ was rewarded with a refreshed draught of the liquid. He smiled  ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ at his (supposed) humor as he watched the word reappear         ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ magically on the screen.                                        ³  ³ ³

³ ³ ³   He purposely left the spot blank, opposite his name. It       ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ would fill in later, when he instructed the machine to finish.  ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ Then before the final count was dropped into place, the         ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ computer would quickly check all aspects of the story,          ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ including the plausibility, according to the level of science   ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ and fiction he'd programmed earlier.                            ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³                                                                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³   He checked the material on the screen, making sure the        ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ appropriate computer address including a target for daytime and ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ nighttime.                                                      ³  ³ ³

³ ³ ³   He thought `title' and watched as the cursor jumped to the    ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ middle of the page, waiting for his thoughts.                   ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³                                                                 ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³   The title. Ah, the title, he thought as he stared at the      ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ screen. A smile crossed his lips as he paused, then formed the  ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ words in his mind, only to see them appear in the appropriate   ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ weight and size on the screen. It read, `The Writer.'           ³  ³ ³

³ ³ ³ ³ pondered the ideas as he waited for his daughter to        ³  ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ ³ arrive through the transitube from her work. He thought    ³  ³  ³ ³

³ ³ ³ ³   Later that night he sat in his favorite chair and spoke  ³  ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ ³ quietly. "Composer," he said, "Prepare the following story ³  ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ ³ for submission to... " he paused as he glanced at the      ³  ³  ³ ³
³ ³ ³ ³ reject next to the name on the pad. The corporate name was ³  ³  ³ ³

³ ³ ³ ³   "Waiting," the composer spoke back. It had finished his  ³  ³  ³ ³

(Author's note:)

  Background: This story was written as the result of receiving a 
rejection note from a major SF magazine. Initially, I took the letter as 
a slap in the face because of its condition. It was a very bad photocopy, 
with the street address of the firm whited out and typed over. It wasn't 
that I was upset that they didn't accept the story; they didn't have the 
courtesy to send a "clean" rejection slip.

  After the initial irritation, I started reading the letter, and I 
realized how badly it had been composed. Not only were these folks in 
the publishing business (and had been for many, many years), but I really 
expected decently written material from them. After a few hours and in the 
meantime, going after my daughter, I came up with the idea for this story.

  In its current form (as a text file), you can't really get the full
intended impact. Copiers, as most of you know, tend to lose the quality 
as you make copies, one generation after another. Therefore, each story
within the story is supposed to be printed in a lighter print until, at 
the end, you can barely make out the words.

  That was the way I sent the story to the magazine, along with a letter
telling them what I thought about their rejection notice. I did not offer
the story for publication to them, and didn't hear anything back. A later
story (BRADLEY) received a new rejection letter, so I think I made my
point.
