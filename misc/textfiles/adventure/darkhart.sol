 THE DARK HEART OF UUKRUL
          Part 1

 OBJECT OF THE GAME

 To win the game, you will need to locate six stone hearts. There are eight
available, but you only need six. Next, you will need to unlock the sacred urn
to get the glass heart of Uukrul. Then, you'll have to retrieve the obsidian
hammer, destroy Uukrul, and rescue Mara. Finally, you must destroy the city of
Eriosthe for victory.

 CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

 The fighter and paladin are straightforward. The higher the level to which they
advance, the better they will fight.

 The magician gets more spell points with level advancement, but he requires new
rings to cast better and stronger spells. Visit the magician circle via
teleporter as often as you can. The award of new rings seems to be determined by
how much progress you have made; you can get several rings without advancing in
level.

 The priest also gets more spell points with level advancement, but at lower
levels his magic is _very_ undependable. Visit the temples as often as you can
via teleporter. Wait until you have a level 4 or 5 priest and at least one
copper ring from each god before you start depending on his prayers.

 Note: 15 is the maximum level to which any character may advance.

 COMBAT

 At lower levels (under 10), use your fighter and paladin to protect the mage.
The priest can fight a bit, but not too well. Each member receives experience
points for damaging and killing monsters. The final blow or spell that kills
seems to earn substantially more points. Since the monsters' hit points are
shown (as horizontal bars), plan accordingly for that final blow.

 EQUIPMENT

 Upgrade the weapons for your fighter and paladin to broadswords and their armor
to chain-mail as soon as you can. When they get to level 6 or 7, buy silver
swords for them or they will have a lot of trouble with monsters. Next, upgrade
their armor again to plate mail and battle shield. Some weapons are particularly
deadly for certain monsters. Sagaris the sage can often tell you about their
secrets.

 Your mage should carry two scrolls of silence at all times until he can cast it
himself. Buy a cross for your priest when you can: It seems to help in turning
the undead. Each member should carry a poison antidote, a plague antidote, and
bandages, until the magician is strong enough in the healing arcana. As far as I
can tell, both kinds of rations work the same, and the Thurgood stuff is
cheaper.

 OBJECTS

 All the jewelry (such as necklace, gems, etc.) should be sold at the market.
Don't waste money getting Sagaris to identify them. Keys can be used only once;
throw them away afterwards. The skulls and bones do not seem to have any
purpose. There are no cursed objects. Get everything you can find. Identify all
the weapons, armor, and other odd items.

 MAPPING

 It is generally not necessary to map if you make wise use of the labeling
feature available in automapping. The one exception is the Cube. You will need
precise mapping to get through that puzzle. However, that area is small and the
layout is simple. Cracking it is a different story.

 Since there are no referencing coordinates used in the game, this walkthru will
only give general directions to the locales; however, specific traveling
directions will be given whenever they are necessary to solve the puzzles. The
game maze is interconnected by sanctuaries. The most logical way to play the
game is to fully explore every segment of the maze before entering the next
sanctuary. There are exceptional instances that are pointed out in the walkthru.
A lot of the puzzles have alternate solutions. I will give specific details for
the ones I know about, but there are probably more I may not have come across.

 THE DARK HEART OF UUKRUL
          Part 2

 STARTING OUT

 As can be imagined, not a lot goes on here. This is really an introductory area
to get comfortable with the game play, the graphics, and the layout. Based on
the inscription that Mara left, you should be able to find and open a secret
door, and get an ornate key. This opens the grate on the north side of the
atrium. You find a brass key there which, in turn, opens the grate on the south
side. You find Mara's book inside the south grate. The map on the wall in the
atrium gives you the location of a secret door, which you will see in the next
segment. There is also a pit and a teleporter in this segment. Explore them if
you like. There is not much in either place, but it is easy to return. Sanctuary
Urtas is the next stop.

 URTAS

 This is another short segment without a whole lot to do. In the reception area
to the east of Urtas, go through the east door in the northeast corner. This is
a twisty passage which doubles back to the reception area. There is a secret
door that opens to the west where it first becomes two tiles wide. This door can
be opened by [L]ooking for a device. It leads to a set of rooms which matches
the map you see in the first segment. Referring to the map should help you
discover a second secret door which leads to some money.

 From the reception area, enter the south door in the southwest corner. This
will lead you to an area with two spinners and a moveable wall. There is a magic
scroll behind the wall.

 From the reception area, enter the east door in the southeast corner. This
takes you upstairs. In this area, you find a bit of money, a dagger, and see a
vision of Mara for the first time; it won't be the last. Go upstairs again to
Sanctuary Urlasar.

 URLASAR

 Shortly after you leave Urlasar, you will be confronted by the spy. Fight him.
You will either kill him or he will run away, but it doesn't matter. Follow the
passage to the downstairs. At the intersection, turn left (east) to visit the
market place. Give your characters better equipment if you have the money (see
general information). Also, visit the forge, mausoleum, guild, and the healer.
Make sure you visit the teleport BORASAL through the north door in the corridor
connecting the two market sections.

 Take the north door behind the teleport, immediately go through the east door,
and follow that passage through another door. You arrive at an area that has
poisonous gas. The first stone heart is also hidden here. Search the north wall
four tiles _after_ you enter the door. You will need to use magic to open the
secret door. When you come through here the first time, your magician probably
won't be strong enough to cast ALTIS (open secret door spell). So, you should
mark this area for a return visit. If you want to explore the rest of the gas
room, there are four tiles that will decrease your hit points. There is also a
map on the wall showing you where those four tiles are, but there is nothing
else in the room.

 You'll find stairs going down at 1S-4W of Teleport BORASAL. Follow those stairs
down through a corridor and you will find another set of stairs going down.
These lead you to the temples. There are four separate temples here -- one for
each of the four gods. Each temple has an altar. You may burn incense here that
restores the priest's hit points (you can buy incense at the market). I never
had the need to burn any incense throughout the game.

 These four altars are also where the gods' rings are awarded. Visit them often.
The various inscriptions throughout the temples area are not helpful for
anything. Don't waste magic points in translating them if you are running low.
Be sure to visit Teleport BORAMIS.

 There is a secret door in the temple of Ufthu, just north of the altar. This
door can be opened with the prayer HOYAMOQ. You will need to invoke that prayer
quite a few times to do the job. Inside the secret door you will find an
inscription that is very difficult to translate (and not terribly helpful), a
few coins, a nasty knife which is a very nice weapon, and two monks who you
won't be able to beat until you reach level 10 or so. The monks have fairly nice
treasure after you defeat them, but it's not vital to the game. You may want to
mark this area for a return visit.

 Follow the corridor going west from Teleport BORAMIS. You will find stairs
going down. Once downstairs, keep moving east until you find another set of
stairs going back up. This leads you to the magician circle and Teleport ALARIQ.

 There are many inscriptions in this area. They hint at the locations of the
various stone hearts, and most of them require a lot of spell points to
translate. The circle hands out various rings for your magician. There is also a
book of archives here. You will only be allowed to read a few paragraphs at a
time depending on your progress in the maze. These paragraphs are extremely
helpful in understanding your various tasks. Visit here via Teleport ALARIQ as
often as possible.

 There is a second stone heart to be found in this segment. Exit the temples to
the north, and turn east to go downstairs. Explore this level carefully and
beware of three spinners. At the northwest corner of this level, you will fight
an armed skeleton. Defeat him to get the iron key. This key opens a grate which
leads you to an inscription that reads "search no more." Search here and you
will find a secret door to the east. This door can only be opened by magic, so
you may need to return at a later time. There is a corpse behind the door.
Searching the corpse with the sword will yield the second stone heart.

 There are other goodies, but I'll leave them to you to explore and enjoy. The
next sanctuary is Urmor which can be reached by taking the stairs up to the
northeast of the market.

 URMOR

 You get to meet Sagaris in this segment by traveling in the following manner:

 After exiting Urmor through the east exit, take the stairs down. Take another
downstairs located 1S-4E of the entrance stairs. Take another downstairs 6S-6E
of the entrance stairs. Go downstairs once more at 3S-0E. Go downstairs again at
2N-0E. Exploring this level will lead you to Sagaris. He is an important ally.
He will ask you to help him. Answer "yes" when he asks if you have been seen. He
will tell you to find the Pool of Testing.

 Sagaris will also identify objects for you for a fee. Be sure to visit teleport
SAGARIS so you can return easily. Elsewhere on this level you will find some
money and a scroll. There is also a king's tomb here: I suggest you leave it
alone. The monster triggered by the tomb is very tough, and there is nothing to
be gained.

 Urlusam can be reached by taking the only downstairs on the Sagaris level.

 URLUSAM

 Exiting east from Urlusam and going downstairs takes you to a gigantic level.
This level consists of a _huge_ cavern to the east, a few chambers to the south,
and a tiny set of rooms to the northwest. The set of rooms has an iron key which
opens a locked grate. You will find a map which shows you a secret room within
the rooms. There is some money in the secret room.

 There is not much of interest in the chambers, except a yellow gem and some
money. There is also a gnome here, but I could not fathom his purpose in the
game.

 The cavern is truly large and leads you to the pool of testing. There are also
several secret doors here which yield money and some small treasures. There is
another gnome here who has some connection with the one in the chambers;
otherwise, he doesn't seem to have any purpose.

 First, go near the southeast end of the cavern and up the stairs. You will find
a bronze key here. Return to the cavern and explore any doors leading south. You
will soon find a passage where "all the footprints here seem to lead toward the
end of the passage; none lead back."

 Search at the end of the passage for a secret door to the north. LOOK for a
device to open it. You will find a drawing and a teleport here. Push "C" on the
teleport. This takes you to another teleport; push "A" to get to a third one;
push "D" to get to a fourth teleport; and push "C" to get to a fifth teleport
with only one button. Explore here to get a brass key. Push the button on the
teleport to return to teleport 3, and push "D" to get back to teleport 4.

 Now, explore this area. There are two locked grates here. The first one is
opened with the brass key; the second one is opened with the bronze key. Behind
the second grate is a map that shows you the area around teleport 5. You should
be able to discern the location of a secret door using this map. Push "C" to get
to teleport 5.

 SEARCH for the secret door. LOOK for the device to open door. After listening
to Sagaris, SEARCH for the secret door at the inscription, and SAY the word
"FAITH" to open it. (There have been numerous clues hinting at the word
"FAITH.")

 Follow Sagaris's instructions. Take the wand that he leaves for you. The wand's
main use is to cast "ALTIS," but it has a randomly limited number of uses. To
use the wand, wave it in the air. To return to the cavern, push the button on
teleport 5. Then, push "A" and push "C." You are back in front of teleport 1 in
the cavern.

 To reach sanctuary Urran, take the downstairs at the extreme eastern end of the
cavern.

 THE DARK HEART OF UUKRUL
          Part 3

 URRAN

 This is a short segment with only a single level, but there are numerous places
where mapping is impossible. A lot of passages wrap around and the compass does
not always work. It's a tough area to explore, but it contains one stone heart
and the silver disk.

 After exiting east from Urran, you will soon reach a 5x5 room with doors on
every wall. If you enter the second west door from the north, you will find a
corridor which leads to a 3x3 room through a one-way door with no other exit.
This room has a column at the center. On the south side of the column is a
secret door which can be opened by looking for a device.

 After entering the column, if you exit to the west, you will return to the
center of the 5x5 room. If you exit the column to the east, you are teleported
two positions north of the column. You will find a drawing here, and you can
return to the 3x3 room via a one-way door. Exiting the column through the north
or south leaves you in the 3x3 room. The only way to escape is by exiting the
column to the west.

 The drawing that you find represents another 5x5 room with two spaces occupied
by skulls. You will find other drawings as you explore that depict the same 5x5
room with skulls occupying other spaces. Combine all these drawings together,
and clearly mark off the spaces occupied by skulls. It will come in handy soon
enough.

 If you take the first west door to the north, you will find a raised panel on
the floor. If you touch it, press it with a staff, or stand on it, you will get
a smell of bromine that makes you slightly dizzy. I'm not sure what this does,
but it seems to have something to do with the functioning of the compass.

 In the 5x5 room with all the doors, take the middle north door. There is a
spinner two spaces after you enter the door which turns you 180 degrees.
Compensate for the spinner and you will reach an elevator. Here, you will find
the third stone heart and another drawing. Return via the elevator.

 Enter the first east door to the north. You will have to fight a witch here who
is pretty tough. Use scrolls of silence on her, and don't spare your magic
spells. After several look-alike corridors, you will arrive at the 5x5 room
depicted in the drawings. This room is filled with booby traps denoted by the
skulls on the drawings. By combining the drawings you should be able to see the
path that allows you to get safely to the south door. The correct path after you
enter the room is north twice, west twice, south, west, south, west, south
twice, and east twice.

 The preceeding route takes you to teleport MELAS, where you'll find a silver
disk. Whenever you get hopelessly trapped or lost, rubbing this disk will bring
you back to this location, and you can use the teleporter to go to any sanctuary
-- a real lifesaver; however, the disk does not work during combats.

 Enter the middle east door. A corridor leads you to another 5x5 room with doors
everywhere. Only two doors are of interest here; all the other doors wrap
around. Enter the middle south door. You will find an ornate key here that is
very important for the end game (a long way away!).

 Enter the middle east door. A long corridor (and I mean long!) leads you to
sanctuary Urshas.

 URSHAS

 Exiting east from Urshas takes you downstairs. Here, you will find a book
giving you a slight hint of what to expect, and another set of stairs leading
down. This level is in the shape of a rhombus, and you are at the western tip of
it. You should explore the level to get the shape, and make note of interesting
locations for a return visit.

 The center of the rhombus has a set of corridors joining the western and
eastern portions. In the middle of these corridors is a roof opening. Climb
through the opening to another corridor. There are very important inscriptions
on both ends of this corridor. Go back down to the rhombus. The central
corridors have two pits. Climb down either one to reach the crossword puzzle
level.

 The crossword puzzle level is laid out just like a crossword puzzle. At the end
of each row or column where a word would end, there is a secret door that does
not require searching. You need to provide the word to open the door. Each clue
that is given is actually a composite of several clues. The key is to break it
down and interpret it correctly. In order, the answers are: FRAIL, INSIDE, NEED,
DRAGON, TEETH, HUM, ENGRAVE, KNEE, ASH, UNDERFOOT, RENOUNCES, and ICICLED.
Inside each secret door is a drawing. Record what you find as well as the clue
number associated with each one, then return to the rhombus.

 Go to the southern tip of the rhombus where the two small buttons are.
Combining the two inscriptions you found with the 12 drawings should tell you
exactly what to do here. Here is the correct sequence for pushing the two
buttons ("D" stands for diamond, and "S" stands for square): D, S, D, D, D, S,
S, D, S.

 Enter the door that you just opened. You will find a stone heart in the east
room. The dragon is in the west room. There is no need to fight it (it's
tough!).

 At the northern tip of the rhombus there is a mirror reflecting a vision. There
are several clues that will point out what to do here. You need to shatter this
vision by invoking the KUURAOTH prayer. Your priest needs to have at least the
gold or platinum ring from the god FSHOFTH to be able to do this. So, a return
visit is probably necessary here. Anyway, Invoking the prayer will shatter the
vision and give you a plaque. INSPECT the plaque and note the writing. You will
need that to face off with Uukrul.

 Take the stairs leading up at the western tip of the rhombus. Here, the vision
of Mara will again appear, giving you a clue about the mirror. Go back upstairs
to reach sanctuary Ureal.

 UREAL

 Exiting east from Ureal will lead you to a grate which can only be opened by
pulling down a chain to the northeast. As you pass through this grate, Uukrul
will lock it behind you, but don't panic; this is not really a trap. Besides,
you can always use the silver disk to escape back to teleport MELAS. Continuing
to explore this area, you will discover four sets of stairs leading up, as well
as different colored stains covering various numbers of indentations. Each of
these stairs leads to a small area with more stains and indentations.

 Continuing from the now locked grate, you will eventually arrive at three
doors, and Uukrul will speak to you. All three doors lead into the same room.
The left door requires a key to open it, and more keys are needed because there
are more doors behind the first one.

 The right door leads to a lot of monsters, so you will have to fight several
battles to get in.

 The middle door requires a word to open it. I was able to discern the word from
Uukrul's speech. The word is (are you ready for this?) "WORD." I was told that
you can also find this out if you link the indentations of the same color in
sequence to form letters. Even though I mapped the areas, it was still too
confusing, and I was unable to confirm this.

 As far as keys for the left door (and all those beyond it), I was told that
there are secret doors along the way where the keys are hidden, but I never
found them. Entering through the middle door will lead you to a locked grate
that cannot be opened. Behind the locked grate is an urn where Uukrul's dark
heart is kept. Even after you figure out how to get to the urn, you still need
six stones hearts to open it, so tackle this puzzle only after you have obtained
the required number of hearts.

 Explore the entire room and you will find that the urn has a 4x4 enclosed area
behind it. Inside this area, each square is an enclosed room with doors. You can
change the locations of the doors to form a path to the urn by moving eight
levers found at the back (western) end of the 4x4 area. Move levers 1, 3, 4, 5,
and 8. Then, follow this path:

 East, south twice, east twice, north twice, west, north, east twice, south, and
east.

 You are now in front of the urn. Insert the six hearts into the sockets to free
the dark heart, and take it. Leaving this area is simple: Go west, south, and
east. Enter the door at the southwest corner of the room and go upstairs. There
is a black bound book here which Sagaris can identify for you. Go back upstairs
to sanctuary Urtehln.

 URTEHLN

 After you exit to the east from Urtehln, you will come to a door with a drawing
and an inscription. Entering the door will yield some writings on the floor and
a copper hoop on the ground 8-feet in diameter. All of these provide you clues
to the following: There is a stone heart to be found around here; there are five
levels to the exit; there are some keys and cards to be found.

 Search just east of the copper hoop and you will find a secret door. Enter the
door and pull the lever behind it to get the first card. Give the card to your
magician. Stand on the copper hoop to ascend to second level. (Sagaris explains
how to use the card when you ask him to identify it.) Level 2 has four separate
areas, but they all yield the same results. Avoid the areas to the west and
north, since they are harmful to your priest and magician.

 The area to the east is the easiest to handle. This area has a 3x3 room in the
middle, with doors in all four compass directions. Go through each door in turn,
touch the upper panel, then return and touch the lower panel. Doing so will get
you several keys and another card. Again, give the card to your magician.

 Return to the copper hoop to ascend to level 3. There's not much to do here,
except to push the UNLOCK buttons on the east, south, and west walls. The UNLOCK
button on the north wall does not work. Instead, push the ACTIVATE button there.

 This transports you to level 4, which consists of a lot of grates that are jail
cells. Most of these grates have been unlocked by you on level 3; the keys you
found on level 2 will open the rest.

 Explore every position in this area. You will find two more cards and a fighter
who was captured by Uukrul. He will give you a stone heart, talk about Mara and
Uukrul, then die. Give all the cards to your magician and step on the copper
hoop to go up to level 5. A map found on this very small level should alert you
to a secret door on the west wall, which you can open by looking for a device.

 Inside you will find a fifth card. Give it to your magician. Stand on the
copper hoop to ascend again. You end up in a room with a battle shield. Exit the
room, travel east, and you will soon be battling some monks. They are rather
tough, but you will get the Globe of Blood for defeating them.

 Have Sagaris identify it for you. Using it periodically gives you visions and
maybe some hints that tighten up the plot. Continue traveling east to reach
sanctuary Urzhut.


 THE DARK HEART OF UUKRUL
          Part 4

 URZHUT

 Go to the marketplace and buy three or four ropes to use in this segment. Also,
be sure to take the silver disk with you.

 Exiting to the east from sanctuary Urzhut takes you east along narrow corridors
and rooms to the control rooms of the great underground river. Read paragraphs
11 and 12 of the archive in the Magician Circle to get an idea as to what is
going here. Along the way you should also find a red pointed hat, which can help
your magician recover spell points at a faster rate. You will have to battle a
group of ferocious monks before you can get it.

 When you arrive at the room with the inscription that reads "Even with her
help, fools cannot walk on water," avoid the south door, because it leads to an
area that depletes your hit points. Instead, enter the north door, and
immediately search for a secret door to the north, which you can open by looking
for a device.

 Get the iron key, then continue east until you see the vision of Mara again.
She will talk to you about the carriage and the hammer. Turn south at this point
and open the locked grate with your iron key. Completely explore the control
rooms in this area. If you look carefully at all the drawings, maps, and
inscriptions here, it should not be difficult to figure out what needs to be
done.

 In the room of the three huge wheels, close gate "A" and open gate "C." At the
Carriage Command Center, SAY "STRIYA," return to the spot where Mara appeared,
go east one space, and cast TALIS to search for a secret door. (This is revealed
by a map.) Open the secret door with magic. You will find a teleporter inside.
Make sure you have the silver disk with you in case you need to make a quick
exit.

 We will go after the hammer first. You will have to travel through a chain of
teleporters. Push these buttons in sequence: 2, 4, and 5. Exit west from the
teleporter. Be aware that there is a random spinner here; check your heading
periodically. You will soon arrive at a pit. Climb down to a corridor with 2
pits. JUMP over the first pit, and climb down into the second one. Climb down
into another pit to the south, climb down another pit to the east, and yet one
more pit to the east.

 Mara appears once more to give you the password to the secret door: "DARNUTH."
Open the secret door and fight the demon to get the hammer. The demon is not too
tough if you have scrolls of silence to cast on him. Rub the silver disk to
escape to Teleporter MELAS. While there, remember to retrieve the silver disk.

 Use Teleporter MELAS to visit Sagaris, so he can identify the hammer for you.
Be sure to visit the forge to repair the hammer. Return to sanctuary Urzhut and
retrace your journey back to the first teleporter behind the secret door.

 With the hammer in your possession, you will now proceed to the next sanctuary.
Push 2, then 4. Exit west from the teleporter and proceed downstairs. Go through
a short corridor and downstairs again. Here is another corridor and another set
of stairs leading down.

 The corridor leads to two doors. You can only enter the second door if you
closed gate "A" and opened gate "C" earlier in the room with the three huge
wheels. Go downstairs yet one more time. Follow the corridor north, then east,
and ride the carriage. You will only get to ride the carriage if you SAID
"STRIYA" earlier at the Carriage Command Center.

 Exit the carriage to the east and walk along the warm corridor. You will soon
discover why it is warm: There is a red dragon in the next room! Fight the red
dragon and get the tome of ruination as a reward. Sanctuary Urqol is only a very
short distance away from the dragon.

 URQOL

 Buy several ropes (five or six) to use in this segment. This is the Cube. To
get from Urqol to Urqastur you need to find your way up a 7x7x7 cube. There are
stairs, teleporters, trap doors, pits, conveyance ports, etc. Careful mapping is
needed to figure out the proper route. There is also a stone heart to be found
here.

 Described below is one solution to the cube. Exiting to the east from sanctuary
Urqol will soon take you up via stairs to level 1 (bottom level) of the cube. Go
east twice, south three times, west twice, north twice, west, and north four
times to the northwest corner of level 1. Press the tablet on the conveyance
port. This teleports you to the southeast corner of level 7.

 Go north, west four times, north, and fight the frost spirit. Now, go north,
west, north three times, and west. Press the tablet on the conveyance port. This
teleports you to the southeast corner of level 1.

 Go west twice and north twice. The stairs take you to level 2. Here, go north
twice, west three times, and north twice. Look up; climb up. You are now on
level 3. Check your heading to make sure you are facing east. Look down and use
a rope to climb down into the pit. You should see another pit to the west.
Repeat this procedure to get back to level 1.

 Go east twice, and press the tablet on the conveyance port. This teleports you
to the southwest corner of level 7. Go east twice, look down, and tie a rope to
climb down into the pit. Go east twice and north twice. Look down and JUMP over
the pit. Go north, then west twice. You arrive at a trapdoor with three runes.
Pull rune 2, then rune 1. (I am not sure if this is random, but keep pulling
rune 2 until a message tells you that you hear heavy metal clanking down below,
then pull rune 1 until you see the same message.)

 Pull rune 3 to drop yourself down to level 5. Explore the two opposite doors to
the north. The west door leads to a hole in the roof. Look up, then climb up. A
long corridor takes you to an inscription which gives you the Service Access
code: "QOLARIS." Return to level 5 by climbing down. Go to the east door and
climb down into the pit.

 Here, you will find a wizard with a stone heart. ATTACK him to get it. Return
to level 5 by climbing up. Go through the southeast door to the trapdoor. Use
the trapdoor to drop down to level 4. There is a pit two spaces to the south.
(If you jump over the pit and enter the door behind it, you can get a bronze key
after a battle; that's an alternate solution.)

 Climb down the pit to level 3. Go west twice, north three times, and east
twice. Use the trapdoor to drop down to level 2. Climb down the pit three spaces
to the west to get to level 1, and go south three times. Press the tablet on the
conveyance port to teleport back to the southwest corner of level 7, and climb
down the pit to the east.

 Go south twice, north twice, look down, and JUMP over the pit. Go north, then
west twice. Leave the trapdoor alone this time. Go south twice, then east, look
down, and JUMP over the pit. Use the trapdoor here to drop down to level 5. Go
south three times, look up, and climb through the roof opening. Go north, look
up, and climb up through the roof opening. Go north three times (you're close to
the exit).

 There are two solutions here. The first one is to open the locked grate to the
north with the bronze key; leave the conveyance port alone; follow the corridor
to the stairs which lead up to sanctuary Urqastur. The second solution is to go
through the door to the west and search for a secret door on the west wall. SAY
"QOLARIS" to open it. Go south to get to the stairs which lead up to sanctuary
Urqastur.

 If you followed the walkthru to this point, you should now have six stone
hearts. Don't forget to return to the urn you found earlier to get Uukrul's dark
heart.

 URQASTUR

 This segment is pretty small, but you have five teleporters in various places
with which you must contend. There is one stone heart in this segment.

 Exit east from Urqastur. After reading the inscription on the far wall, climb
down the pit. Walk east through the wall. Keep going east until you enter
another door with a map on the wall. You will find a door and a grate here.
Exploring either one for the first time will teleport you automatically to a
small disjointed area. Here, you will fight a devil, get an iron key, open a
locked grate, and find a teleporter. Pushing "Y" on the teleporter will put you
one space south of the spot where you originally came from, and in the middle of
a east-west corridor.

 Going west here will gain you another vision of Mara. She gives you two words
that can open several secret doors, and a clue to the Heart Hall. Go to the east
end of the corridor. There is a secret door on the south wall which can be
opened by saying "DRASZ."

 Continue south, search for another secret door, and open it with "DRASZ." You
will find a black portal here. Enter it and you will be caught by Uukrul. West
of the portal is a long corridor. Enter the south door near the end of the
corridor. Search the west wall for a secret door which can be opened with the
word "SALUNH."

 Continue going to the west until you reach a teleporter. Pushing button "Y" on
the teleporter will teleport you to the Heart Hall. This is a 5x10 rectangular
area with blocks shaped like a cross in the middle. The drawing that you saw
earlier depicts the room structure inside the cross.

 Walk counterclockwise around the cross until you get sucked into it through a
hidden door. Teleport HEARTHALL is just to the west of you. You can use this to
return to the sanctuary.

 If you continue east, you will have to get through four secret doors that
require magic to open them, and fight three very tough battles against wights,
dragons, and titans. Your reward is another stone heart. If you run low on
energy and spell points, you are better off using the teleporter to return to
the sanctuary to rest up before coming here again.

 After you get the stone heart (which you don't need if you have been following
this walkthru), use the teleporter to return to Urqastur. Go down the pit and
walk through the wall just like before. After entering the door with the map, go
north to the unlocked grate. If you get teleported again to that disjointed
area, push "Y" on the teleporter to return.

 Go up the stairs behind the unlocked grate. There is not much of interest here.
Head east to sanctuary Uroqlamn. If you should explore in other directions and
find another teleporter, ignore it, for it does not lead to anyplace
interesting.


 THE DARK HEART OF UUKRUL
          Part 5

 UROQLAMN

 Exiting east from sanctuary Uroqlamn will lead you into Adron's Palace. You
find yourself in a room where several tiles are covered with anywhere from one
to six stars. These tiles are teleporters that will send you to the
corresponding levels of the palace.

 Before you can use them, you'll have to activate them. Take one step to the
south of the entry door and search for a secret door. Open it by looking for a
device. You find yourself in a control room with a red gem and a blue gem. To
activate each level, push the blue gem once, push the red gem level-number of
times, and push the blue gem once. For example, to activate level 3, push the
blue gem once, push the red gem 3 times, then push the blue gem once. Repeat
this until all 6 levels are activated, then return to the other chamber.

 You should see all the stars on the tiles sparkling. Wander around here for a
while until you are challenged by a group of monks. Fight them to get the
Adron's die. This is your vehicle to travel. To go to level one, stand on the
tile with one star, USE the die, and CAST the die on the ground. Repeat the same
steps to go to other levels.

 Go to level 1. Whenever you need to approach a black rune, INVOKE the TAPU
prayer first. You'll take less damage this way. You are standing on a tile with
one sparkling star. Cast the Adron's die again. This will take you to a sublevel
where there are four quadrant keys and four prophecies to be found. You will
need to solve 4 riddles to completely explore this level. The answers to these
riddles (in order) are: PRIEST, HAMMER, SAGARIS, and MAGICIAN.

 The four keys are: north six, east seventy-two, south eighteen, and west five.
After exploring this level, cast the die while standing on the one-star tile to
return.

 Back on level 1, go west, and JUMP over the pit. Go west twice, north five
times, east 17 times, and north. You will see Sagaris here. Follow him through
the secret door (SAY "SAGARIS" to open it), then east until he stops to speak to
you. Afterward, continue east until you find the two teleporters.

 Visit teleport SURAQIS so you can use it to return later. Notice that the other
teleport has four buttons. Push the asterisk (*) button to teleport to another
teleporter. West of this teleporter is a drawing that gives you the beacon
codes: north, VGAK; east, XBHW; south, LFPW; west, BPKQ. Use the teleporter to
return.

 When you are back at the teleporter with four buttons, push 1. You are
teleported to the royal chambers of the palace. This is a fairly small area with
two secret doors. Explore the south side to find an inscription giving you the
operations for each quadrant. There is also a code machine nearby.

 To the north (after you enter the room covered with Uukrul's runes) search for
a secret door in the northwest corner of the room. Look for a device to open it.
A long corridor leads you to another room. Search for another secret door in the
northeast corner of the room. Again, look for a device to open it. One more room
behind this contains an inscription which explains how to use the code machine.

 There is a roof opening further to the south that will take you back to level
1. Go back to the code machine. Enter VGAK, DIVIDE, 6 to get the north arming
sequence (1231). Enter XBHW, ADD, 72 to get the east arming sequence (3144).
Enter LFPW, SUBTRACT, 18 to get the south arming sequence (1344). Finally, enter
BPKQ, MULTIPLY, 5 to get the west arming sequence (3325).

 Exit back to level 1 through the roof opening described earlier. Make your way
back to teleport SURAQIS. Use it to return to sanctuary Uroqlamn for rest and to
replenish your supplies and weapons. Be sure to give the hammer to your fighter
or paladin. You next stop is Uukrul's hideout.

 Exit to the east of Uroqlamn as before and enter the star chamber. Stand on the
tile with four stars and cast Adron's die. This teleports you the level 4. There
is supposed to be another stone heart hidden here. I never found it, but I
didn't need it. Make your way to the east wall while avoiding the black runes.

 Here, at two different spots, you will find a statue of a phoenix who will ask
you riddles. (Either statue will lead you to Uukrul, and the riddles are
identical.) You have to answer three riddles; the third one can only be solved
by INSPECTing the plaque that you received in the rhombus. The answers are:
UUKRUL, ADRON, and I WILL RULE.

 You are now in combat with Uukrul. The first thing to do is USE the dark heart
by THROWING IT ON THE GROUND. That shatters the heart and forces Uukrul to stay
and fight. Next equip your fighter or paladin with the reforged obsidian hammer.
Have your magician repeatedly cast RESENTEL or RESEN spells. The last blow must
be made by the character with the hammer, otherwise Uukrul will regenerate. So,
some planning is needed to kill Uukrul. If you have enough spell points, he is
not that difficult to destroy. You will get an ornate key after Uukrul is
killed. But the game is not yet over.

 Go ahead and explore the rest of Uukrul's hideout on this level. You should be
able to find a lot of money, a crown, and more money. When finished, exit
through the door in the northeast corner, and find your way to sanctuary
Urxaszel.

 URXASZEL, CHAOS

 By now your magician should have the crystal rings from most, if not all, of
the arcanas. If he has the crystal ring of knowledge, cast CYQIEQARAQK in the
sanctuary to learn about lots of interesting things. They are not really
essential to winning the endgame, but they're fun to read. Also you should be
allowed to read all 15 paragraphs of the archives in the Magician Circle.

 If you deposited the five cards you obtained from the prison and torture center
in a sanctuary cache, go get them: You will need them in Chaos. Also, make sure
you still have the ornate key you received in the UREAL segment.

 Exit east from sanctuary Urxaszel, where you will again meet Sagaris. What he
says now should give you an inkling as to what will follow. Also, you can now
use teleporters to go to Chaos and Beacon. Return to sanctuary Urxaszel.

 Before rescuing Mara, you must first go and arm the beacon. Use the sanctuary
teleporter to go to Uroqlamn. Go to the star chamber and cast Adron's die on the
five-star tile to go to level 5. You come to a very strange room with numbers on
the floor. You find that when you walk in any direction, you will go several
spaces before stopping. What happens is this: When you try to move in any
direction, you will move the same number of spaces as indicated by the number on
the tile from which you started, unless you're stopped by a wall.

 Here is the sequence to get to the door on the east wall: Starting after you
have entered the room, go east twice, north, south, west, north, and east twice.
You will find the arming mechanism after you pass through the east door. Input
all four sequences: 1231, 3144, 1344, and 3325. The beacon is now armed, and you
are ready to go to Chaos.

 The easiest way to leave here is to use the silver disk, which brings you back
to Teleport MELAS. Then, you can use the teleporter to get to Chaos. The long
way to do it is to exit through the many-number room again. The sequence for
leaving after you have entered the room is: west, south, and west twice. From
there you can use Adron's die to return to the star chamber, then the sanctuary,
then teleport to Chaos.

 Chaos is no fun! Most of it is totally unmappable, and the compass usually
doesn't work. Once you leave the teleporter and exit through a one-way door to
the west, you will see a locked grate in the distance where Mara is kept. Turn
to read the inscription on the east wall which reads, "I contain the way of your
escape." This is your starting point.

 If you're the brave, curious type, go ahead and explore on your own for a
while. Translate as many inscriptions as you can find. It is very important that
you find another locked grate that can be opened by your ornate key. Behind the
grate is a very important map. There is also another map that shows a path.

 You will find a lot of gateways, as well as many other drawings. When you tire
of wandering around aimlessly, return to your starting point (where the first
inscription was), then follow the instructions in the next paragraph.

 If you just want to get through this to watch the endgame display, here is what
needs to be done:

 First, give all five cards to your magician. At the starting point described
earlier, take one step west. You will be transported to a point just in front of
a teleporter with four buttons on it; push 3. You will be teleported to a room
with doors in every direction. Check your compass to make sure you are facing
east. (The compass will work here.)

 Go east twice. You will end up in a room two tiles long with a card. Get the
card and exit through the one-way door to the south. (Give this card to the
magician. He should have a total of six cards.) Take one step south. You are
transported elsewhere again. Turn until you are facing west, then follow this
sequence _exactly_: west four times, north four times, north twice, west twice,
south once, south twice, east five times, east once, and north once. This
sequence passes through seven latches; this maneuver is what opens Mara's cage.

 Give all the cards to other characters so the magician is now cardless. Go four
spaces south. That will transport you back to the front of Mara's cage again.
Enter the cage and CALL HER NAME. This wakes her up, and Mara is rescued.

 Now, give five of the cards back to the magician, return to your starting point
(which should be close by), and take one step west. You are in front of the
teleporter with the four buttons again; push 3. Exit the room through the south
door. Hurrah! You are facing teleport Chaos. Use it to go to Beacon.

 Once you step off teleport Beacon, you will be met by both Sagaris and Mara.
Read all that they tell you and enter the last line of the LAIRIAN prayer from
the manual to finish the game. I hope your priest has the crystal ring from the
god FSHOFTH. (I don't know what would happen if your priest didn't have that
ring.)

 Now, sit back, relax, and read lots and lots of text. (Personally, I was a
little disappointed in the lack of endgame "specials effects" after all the hard
work I put into playing THE DARK HEART OF UUKRUL.)
