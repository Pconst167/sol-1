Problem:
What do I do in the streets of Serenia?
Hint:
After you visit one of the shops in the town of Serenia, you can
find  a silver  coin in  the  street.  It will  be located  just
outside the tailor's door at the  entrance to an alley. There is
also  a barrel  in the  alley entrance.  Be sure  to look in the
barrel and take the fish.
 
Problem:
What do I do at the Tailor's Shop?
Hint:
You can  get a blue  cloak from the  tailor. But first  you will
need  to get  the golden   needle from  the haystack  beside the
Swarthy Hog's Inn. Give the tailor the golden needle and he will
give you the cloak.

Problem:
What do I do at the Shoe Shop?
Hint:
The shoe maker is very poor and would like to retire. If only he
had  enough money.  Perhaps if  he had  a rare  pair of shoes to
sell. You can  get him such a pair  of shoes from an elf  in the
witch's forest.

Problem:
What do I do at the Toy Shop?
Hint:
The  toy maker  will gladly  accept the  marionette you got from
grandpa gnome and his grandson.  He will exchange the marionette
for a sled.

Problem:
How do I avoid dying of thirst?
Hint:
Drink from a desert oasis. There are many of them to drink from.
In fact,  in the extreme desert  heat, an oasis provides  a good
place to save your game.

Problem:
What should I do with the skeleton I found?
Hint:
You will notice a shoe near the skeleton. Get the old shoe.

Problem:
Where can I find the skeleton?
Hint:
The skeleton is in the desert. Start  at the Bee tree, go west 4
screens. The next screen west is an oasis, enter this screen and
drink. Go west  2 more screens, then south  1 screen. You should
now see the skeleton. Get the old shoe.

Problem:
Where can I find the Temple?
Hint:
Start at the  Bee tree, go west 4 screens.  The next screen west
is an  oasis. Enter this  screen and drink.  Go north 2  screens
from  the oasis,  until you  are next  to the  cliff. Go  west 3
screens along the cliff, you should  see an opening in the cliff
and a  small pool of  water near the  rocks. Make sure  to drink
from the pool.  Go north 1 screen at the  opening. You should be
at the temple.

Problem:
How can I find the Bandit's camp?
Hint:
Start at the  Bee tree, go west 4 screens.  The next screen west
is  an  oasis.  Enter  this  screen  and  drink.  Go west 2 more
screens,  then south  3 screens.  You should  now be  at another
oasis. Drink.  Go south 1  more screen, then  go west until  you
reach the tents (4 screens). You are now at the camp. Be sure to
drink from the large jug in the middle of the camp.

Problem:
How  do I  avoid being  killed  by  the bandits  in front  of the
temple?
Hint:
Hide from them behind the rocks on the east side of the entrance
to the temple.  Spy on the bandits and  pay special attention to
the staff that one of them is carrying.

Problem:
I'm at  the bandits' hideout  and there are  many drunken bandits
around. What should I do?
Hint:
At the  bandits' hideout, enter  the first tent.  The bandit has
fallen asleep at his post! Be  careful not to wake him. Sneak to
the back of the tent and  get the staff leaning against the back
of the tent. Then leave the tent quietly. You can use this staff
to get into the temple.

Problem:
I'm at the  bandits' hideout and the place looks abandoned.  What
should I do?
Hint:
If there is no one at  the bandits' hideout, you'll need to come
back later.  Go to the  entrance of the  desert temple and  hide
behind some rocks on the east side at the base of the cliff. Spy
on the bandits  and pay special attention to  the staff that one
of them is carrying.

Problem:
What do I do with the staff?
Hint:
Do you recall seeing the bandits open the desert temple with the
staff? Now it's  your turn. Go to the desert  temple and use the
staff to open the temple. When  you get inside, quickly take the
gold coin  and brass bottle  from the floor  and get out  of the
temple.

Problem:
How do I avoid being sealed up in the desert temple?
Hint:
Save your game  just before entering the temple.  When you enter
the temple to get the brass bottle and gold coin, do it quickly.
There is just  enough time to get these two  items only and then
head out of  the opening. Don't spend any extra  time in here or
you'll be sealed up forever!
