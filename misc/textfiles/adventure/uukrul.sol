	Solution to The Dark Heart of Uukrul
	====================================

        The  land  of Eriosthe is being threatened  by  the  evil
magician,  Uukrul who was once of the Ancient. Therty  led  by
the brave Mara is rumoured to be slaughtered during their mission
to  eliminate Uukrul. Mara is captured and imprisoned  in  Chaos,
the  jail of Uukrul. Yourrty is chosen to infiltrate  Eriosthe
and find a way to destroy Uukrul and rescue Mara. Yourrty will
need to search for clues and solve puzzles during game play.


Character Development
=====================


Fighting
========

        Fighter   and ladin  will  gain  levels  much   faster
initially in the game as the priest and magician will not be very
powerful at low level. Fighter andladin can wear the  heaviest
armor  and wield the most powerful sword. At highest level,  they
can  do  200-300  demage points depending on  the  weapons  used.
Paladins can lay their hand on enemy to demage them or heal  your
party.


Prayers
=======

        Priest should try to invoke prayers as soon as  possible.
The priest will need to go to temple if he thinks he is qualified
for a better ring. Gaining levels will usually rewards the priest
with one or two rings. However, if the priest will have a  better
chance  of  getting  a higher ring if he is able  to  invoke  the
prayers of the gods successfully.

        The  prayers  to Ufthu are useful during  combat.  RALKOR
will  send an arrow to strike the strongest opponent. KARNH  will
heavily  injure monsters adjacent to the priest. DROM  will  give
strength  to yourrty so that they cause more demage. IDRIS  is
very  demaging  to all undead creatures present. THOL  will  make
your opponents less effective in combat.

        Prayers to Drutho are useful in dungeon exploring.  UMESH
will  attempts to translate the script on the wall. HOYAMOQ  will
try  to  force  the secret door open, usually  a  few  prayer  is
required before the door is opened. TAPU will reduce demage  done
to  the rty  in dangerous area. BYNDU is the  prayer  with  no
arent  purpose.  MORPETH will help to reduce  encounters  when
exploring.  BELAMOQ is the most powerful door opening prayer,  no
secret  door could withstand its power if  successfully  invoked.
However,  it is usually not answered and cost a great  amount  of
virtue points.

        Prayers to Gothur are for healing purposes. SIRDHE is the
basic  healing  prayer, it will heal a certain amount  of  wounds
from  each character. HOLNAK will increase your  fighting  power.
ELIS  will  heal  completely the character with  the  lowest  hit
points.  TELIS  will heal therty completely, but  it  is  only
answered  at an altar. BEYONG will remove poison and plague  from
therty. Usually answered in a sanctuary.

        Prayers to Fshofth is necessary under certain  situation.
NULAMIR  will  attempts  to silent the  enemies.  TULAR  is  only
answered  at an altar. If successfully invoked, it will  increase
the rty's food by 200 units. RULASAIR is similar to TULAR  but
can be cast anywhere, however the increase is only 100 units  and
is  more  draining than TULAR. EMANUI is usually  answered  in  a
santuary, it give growing health. KUURAOTH is only needed to wake
up  the dark vision from the mirror that can tell the  future  of
Eriosthe. LAIRIAN is needed to light the beacon.

Magic
=====
	
        Magician gain rings depending on their frequent usage  of
spells from articular discipline. For example, if you use fire
spells frequently, then you will get the next higher ring of fire
earlier  than the other rings. Generally speaking, you will  gain
one or two rings everytime you gain level.

        The  effects of the crystal spells are not given  in  the
manual  but you can learn about them by casting CYQIEQARAQK,  the
tome of the Seer.

The Tome of the Seer
====================

        The  great mystic Cyqie harnessed his own soul to  create
the  spell which destroyed him. CYQIEKUN shall draw forth  flames
of  the  hell in which he is now imprisoned. So  perish  all  who
outreach their station.

Range: 3 by 3 radius from the caster.

        Your  mirror may scry visions of the future,  your  globe
may  show  thest, but you are now, and forever  slave  to  the
present.

        The  great  mystic Cyqie created the spell  of  ceaseless
healing.  CYQIETUR  shall form a pure blue  globe.  Those  within
shall be contiually refreshed and restored.

        The  halls of the greatlace, which once thronged  with
life, are silent now. Adron, why did you not smite the  darkness?
But  the beacon remains, and the darkness shall be  swallowed  by
its light.

        One from thest shall return.    One who is captive  shall
be  freed. One who is once of the light shall be returned to  the
greatest light.

        QADIOS  is a mighty spell. It forms around those of  pure
heart  the  womb of infinity safety. Focus your  minds  on  great
things and no harm mayss.

        The  obsidian crystal survives in a solamn artifact.  The
hammer lies broken, yet it shall break the darkness.

        Behold  the greatest of spells. MUZAQ shall call forth  a
black  trumpet,  when the trumpet sounds, the cries  of  all  the
damned  souls  in  hell  shall burst  forth  in  a  maelstorm  of
oblivion.

Effect: wipe out all enemies.

        The kauri plaque is broken, the waking vision now sleeps.
Areth: you will never rule.

        Behold  the mirror that foretells the future.  Pray  that
the  dark  tower  may  crumble. Prayer that  the  vision  can  be
disspelled.  The dark heart of Uukrul must be shattered,  it  has
been foretold.

General hints
=============

        At low levels (1-6), therty will not be able to  fight
very  well.  If  you find that yourrty is  taking  a  lots  of
punishment, try to let them gain higher level before  proceeding.
Healing spells and prayers are important, so ensure that you  can
cast/invoke them. Don't proceed further if you find that you  are
having  little  virtue/psychic points but head straight  for  the
nearest sanctuary and rest. When you have reach level 10 or more,
only  the strongest opponents will be able to hurt you.  At  this
stage,  much time is spent solving puzzles rather than  fighting.
The  maximium level possible is 15, at this level,  the  magician
and priest will have all their rings complete and will no  longer
need to worry about combats.

        When  you find a key in a certain level, it will  usually
unlock a grate somewhere on that level. You will not be allow  to
drop  it before it unlock anything. If your character  carry  too
many keys in his bacck, he might not be able unlock the  grate
even  though he is carrying the correct key. If  possible,  don't
let  any  character carry too many keys. So it  is  advisable  to
store the key in the cache in the sanctuaries after it was used.

        Resting in higher levels sanctuaries will heal the rty
much faster. So, always teleport to the last sanctuary you  found
before resting.

     Before  you  can invoke the prayer TULAR  successfully,  you
will need to buy food rations from the supply shop. Once you have
learn to invoke it, rest in sanctuary to reach full virtue points
and  then  go to the altars to invoke it.  When  travelling  long
distance,  make  sure that you have at least 2000-5000  units  of
food.

        If  you  cannot find a way to open any secret  door,  try
ALTIS,  HOYAMOQ  or BELAMOQ if possible. This  situation  usually
occurs  when you need to speak a certain word to open  the  door.
The words needed is usually the answer to a riddle or a ssword
found somewhere.

        Teleporters  are only active after you have find  it.  If
you  know its name but have never been to it, then you  can't  go
there.

        Before  you  can cast the spell REAAM  to  identify  your
items.  Go to Sagaris and ask him to identify it for you. If  the
properties of any items is unknown, a visit to Sagaris is usually
rewarding.

        Searching  will  reveal most secret  doors.  However,  at
higher  areas,  you will need to cast the spell TALIS  to  reveal
secret doors.

ŠThe Sanctuaries
===============

URTAS - Sanctuary of the Ancients
=================================

        There  is  nothing much here, except that it give  you  a
feel of the mapping feature. A certainrt here is not allow  to
be  mapped and there are some spinner traps that spin your rty
when  you  stepped on them. The savage wolf at  that  level  will
gives  yourrty a subtantial amount of punishment, but  if  you
cast SHUM regularly, you should have no problem. A vision of Mara
shows up briefly to tell you to find the frozen hearts.

URLASAR - Sanctuary of the Village
==================================

        Initially, you will come across a figure in robe, if  you
don't  want to fight with him, offer him money. If you choose  to
fight with him, you will take a great deal of demage but  winning
this combat will allows you to gain a lot of experiences.

        This area consist of most of the places you will need  to
visit often throughout the game.

        The  supply shop provides all the necessary items  needed
in the game, you can sell items if you need money, or buy  better
equipments  when you have the cash. It will take sometime  before
you  can  get hold of all the goodies in the  shop.  Unidentified
items are usually sold at a lower price, so try to identify  them
before you sell them.

        Directly  behind  the shop is a forge for you  to  rir
your  broken weapons. However, most wooden/magical weapon  cannot
be reforged. So take care of your magical weapons.

        To  the  east is a hospice for you to heal or  cure  your
party.  The price requested is reasonable, soy for healing  if
you  need  a quick heal instead of wasting food  resting  in  the
sanctuaries.

        Behind  the  hospice is a guild for  you  to  recuit/meet
people  who  are  eager to join your rty.  If  your  character
happened  to be killed and not resurrected, you will be allow  to
choose  a  successor. The 3 persons presented  will  probably  be
cotible  to  the  dead character. When you need  to  choose  a
successor, consider the choice carefully, you might get a  higher
level character or one which is lower.

        Beside  the guild is the mausoleum which  will  resurrect
your characters if they were killed. However resurrection usually
lower your characters experience points and sometimes  attributes
and the amount of money requested is proportional to the level of
the deceased.

        There  is  a teleporter BORASAL nearby, so that  you  can
come here easily.

        There  is  also the hall of temples where your  find  the
temples  of the four gods. You will need to go to the  individual
god's  temple if you want to gain a more powerful ring  from  the
god. The teleporter here is BORAMIS.

        When you go lower, you will find the Circle of  Magician.
Your  magician  will  be  able to gain  better  rings  if  he  is
qualified.  The teleporter to here is ALARIQ. There are  messages
on the walls telling you where to find the 8 frozen hearts.

        EIGHT FROZEN KEYS FOR SIX BLOODIED LOCKS
        AND THE DARKEST HEART OF THE COLDEST ROCK

        THE FIRST BEHIND GASES AND POISONOUS AIR
        THE SECOND WITH THE DEAD BEHIND TWIST AND STAIR
        THE THIRD WITH A DRAGON - THE FOURTH IN A CELL
        THE FIFTH IN DEPTHS WARPED BY EVIL'S SPELL
        THE SIXTH WITH HIS HORDES - THE SEVENTH IN A PIT
        THE LAST IN THE STRONGHOLD WHERE THE DARK ONE SITS

        ONE SHATTERED HEART SHALL THE DARK ONE STOP

        Going  back to the hall of temple, there is a place  full
of  undead creatures as indicate by a skeleton on a certain  map.
The  battle there is tough when therty is at low  levels,  and
hidden  inside this place is a chrome key. This key  unlocks  the
grate to the north of the teleportor BORASAL. Behind the grate is
a  place  full  of poisonous gases and air.  This  locations  are
marked  with  a 'X' on the map. If you step on them,  your rty
will  receive a lot of demage. At the point just before you  step
into  the poisonous gases, there is a secret door to  the  north.
Search  for  it, and try to open it. Behind the door is  a  stone
heart.

URMOR - Sanctuary of the Deepening Night
========================================

        You will have a lots of encounters in this area. However,
you will be able to gain a few levels if you fight well. You will
find  a  few  keys and unlock a few grates. Follow  the  map  and
eventually  you will find a vision of Mara. Heed what  she  says.
After searching for a while, you will find a old man who ask  you
to do something for him. He will want the priest to go to a  pool
of  testing to get a black rod. Say yes to him, and he will  then
reveals himself as Sagaris the Sage. He will identify items for a
fee.  The teleporter to here is SAGARIS. The fee is dependent  on
its  value, important or enchanted items usually cost much  more.
However,  identified items can be sold at a higher price  at  the
supply shop.

URLUSAM - Sanctuaries of High Vault Ceilings
============================================

        The  battle  in  this area is quite  tough.  Because  the
caverns is very long, and therty can hardly survive till  they
reach the next santuaries at the eastern side. The most dangerous
opponents are the black orcs. The fighter andladin are  unable
to hit them and they have a lot of hit points. The black orcs hit
are usually critical.

        MY FIRST WAS OF THE FORMING - AND LIES FOREVER STILL
        MY SECOND IS OF THE AFTERMATH - THE COOLING OF THE KILL
        MY THIRD IS ME ALONE - ONE OF THE MIGHTY THREE
        MY FOURTH IS AN ELIXIR - AND THE PARTING OF THE WAYS
        MY LAST IS OF THE HOLOCAUST - WITH THE DYING OF THE DAYS

        FOR ALL IS TOLD HEREIN - TELL ME PRIEST WHAT MAY I BE?

        Search for the pool of testing on the map. You will  need
faith  to  open  the secret door leading to the  pool.  Only  the
priest  can  get  inside the pool to get  the  black  rod.  After
getting the rod, Sagaris appears and took it, and as a reward, he
drop  a  wand  of potency. This wand can  be  used  to  translate
inscriptions. Use it wisely as it has limited charges.

        There are lots of secret doors along the caverns, most of
them  yield  a  cache  of  money. Head  east  to  find  the  next
sanctuary.

URRAN - Sanctuaries Beyond Reason
=================================

        This  is  a horrible place, the coss  is  not  working
properly,  and thessages twist among themselves. Therty  is
teleported  all over the place. Follow the map to find  the  room
marked  with 'X' all over the place. You might be  killed/injured
if  you  step on them. Follow theths on the map to  clear  the
room.  The teleporter MELAS is found in the room and there  is  a
medal  of escape in a box. It will allow therty to  return  to
this place when it is rubbed. Everytime a new sanctuary is found,
you can find a medal here, so there are a total of 13 medals. Use
them wisely, since there are places where you can return only  by
the  medal  or  starve/frozen to death. Each time  the  medal  is
rubbed, it will be gone forever and you will need to get  another
one from here if it is available.

        The  scrying mirror is buried with the bold  defender  of
light,  Kiriya. The mirror can be used to see the future of  your
party. It will show what might happened to yourrty at the next
sanctuary. So use it everytime you have reach a new sanctuary.

URSHAS - Santuary of the Dragon
===============================

        The  mirror at the northern end of the  diamond  foretell
the  future of Eriosthe. It can be awaken by your priest,  invoke
the  prayer  KUURAOTH  to do that. Take the  Areth's  plague  and
inspect it, it contains an important clue.

yourself  inside a room. Kill the ice dragon inside and  get  the
stone heart. The chalice can be sold for quite a high price.

UREAL - Santuary of Twisted Paths
=================================

        This  level is basically a setup by Uukrul to  test  your
potentials. Pull the chains near the grate to open the grate.

        When  you havessed, Uukrul will close it  behind  you.
You are supposed to find your way out of these twistedths.  At
the end of theths is three test put up by Uukrul. Clearing any
one  of these tests will allow you to getst to the next  area.
However, if you opt to retreat, go back to the grate. Uukrul will
open the grate if you responded correctly.

First Test:

        Find four keys to open four grates to getss. By taking
note of the four fragments of maps found and then placing them on
on  top of each other, a drawing is formed with some  letters  on
it. The meaning is difficult to guess, but on close  examination,
it  actually means something quite simple. The message behind  it
is:

        Cast  the spell TALIS whenever you are at a  place  which
resemble  a  U. And you will find a secret door to  the  key  you
need. Check the maps to learn their locations.

Second Test:

        A  secret door lies infront of you. You need to  speak  a
word  to  open it. Since no clue is given  whatsoever,  the  only
reasonable answer is the word "WORD" itself. So, speak it and the
door  is opened. This is the easiest test but can be quite  tough
if you think in the wrong direction.

Third Test:

        You  are supposed to fight the minions of Uukrul. If  you
manage  to  clear them, you will come to a secret  door  that  is
easily opened.

        There   are  three  fights.  The  first  involves   three
organisms  that like to spit acid and poison at yourrty.  They
have  relatively high hit points and are difficult to be  killed.
The  second battle consist of four trolls. They can stretch  time
by  their own wish so as to slow down yourrty. They  are  much
easier opponents cored to the organisms, but beware, they  hit
hard. The last room is guarded by two fire spirits. They like  to
breathe  fire at therty and do a lot of demage. If your  level
is low, there is only a slim chance of successfully hitting them.
To  defeat  them  is almost impossible unless  you  are  powerful
indeed.

        Don't  forget  about this place when you have  clear  it.
Always  return  to  go for the third test.  Fight  here  to  gain
experiences. When you find that you have suffered a great deal of
demage,  turn  back and use the other two ways to return  to  the
sanctuary  URTEHLN.  Train here until you can easily ssed  the
third  test.  Only then you are prred for what lies  ahead  of
you.

        After ssing the test, you will find a urn in  an  area
protected by alot of shifting walls. Enter the combinations:

        ^ v ^ ^ ^ v v ^
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

^ - lever up
v - lever down

and  walk along theths indicated on the map. You will find  an
urn. The dark heart of Uukrul is hidden inside. Insert the  stone
hearts  you have found into it. You will need six hearts  to  get
the dark heart. So, return here everytime a new heart is found.

URTEHLN - Sanctuary Beneath the Pyramid
=======================================

        4  cards,  4 stops, 4 keys, 4 locks, 1 final door  and  1
stone heart, 1 final card before you drt.

        This  place consists of six levels. The number  of  magic
card your magician carries will determine which levels yourrty
will  be  teleported  when you step into  the  elevator.  And  at
anytime, waving the card will bring you to the teleporter.

        The first card is found behind a secret door at level  1.
Give the card to your magician, and then goto the next level.

        Level  2  is  an area of torture,  beware  of  the  black
circle, it might decrease your attributes permanently. There  are
4  rooms in the four direction. Just go to the eastern  room  and
you  will find four rooms. Press the buttons to  reach  different
places.  Keep  doing so until you have found 4 keys and  1  card.
Goto level 3 when you find the card.

        The  third level is easy, simply go to the 4 corners  and
select  the  unlock function if it is not  demaged.  After  that,
activate it to reach level 4.

        Those grates that are still not unlocked can be  unlocked
by the 4 keys you found. Look around this place until you find  2
cards  and Nalusi. Nalusi will give you a stone heart  before  he
die. There is a bone of cursing which can be use in combat,  wave
it for it to take effect.

        Give 4 cards to the magician to reach level 5. There is a
secret door to the west. Get the card.

        Give  5 cards to your magician and travel to level 6.  To
the  west is a secret door that hide a war shield which  you  can
give to your fighterladin.

        Head east to find the next sanctuary. Along the way,  you
will  fight some monks and find a globe of blood. This globe  can
be used to see thest, but you need to wait sometime before you
can use it again. Use it regularly as it give hints as to what is
happening in thest.

URZHUT - Sanctuary of the Great Engineer
========================================

        This area stretch over a large distance, so make sure you
have  enough rations and are powerful enough to  survive  through
the  long journey. Don't miss out any places in this area.  There
are  quite a number of magical items for you to collect. You  can
get an enchanted robe and a hat of thought for your magician.

        Head  east, eventually you will reach the control  rooms.
Get  the key at the northern control room to open the grate.   At
the turbines, Close gate A and B but leave gate C opened. At  the
carriage control, enter STRIYA. Now the carriage is ready. At the
northeastern  corner,  cast TALIS to reveal a secret  door  to  a
teleporter.  If yourrty is weaken, you can choose to get  back
to URZHUT and take the carriage to reach URQOL, otherwise you can
continue the search for the hammer.

        Use  the map as a guide to find the hammer. The pits  are
difficult,  so if possible, bring along some ropes. At  the  very
bottom,  Speak  DARNUTH  to open the secret  door  behind  Mara's
vision. A daemon will be guarding the obsidian hammer. Kill it to
get the hammer.

        Now  teleport to 4 and head for the carriage. The  reason
gates  A  and B are closed is because you need to walk ss  the
rooms, if they are opened, the rooms will be flooded. Gate C must
be open in order to supply energy for the carriage, otherwise  it
won't move.

URQOL - Sanctuary Beneath the Cube
==================================

        This  place is in fact a cube. Picture the map as one  on
top of the other. And in this way, pit are directly connected. If
you  drop  from  a trapdoor, you will be at  the  place  directly
below. Keep this in mind when you are using the maps provided.

        The  battle here is quite tough, so yourrty should  be
at  least level 10 in order to survive long enough. Look for  the
bronze  key  at  level 4. Anyway, at level 6,  you  will  find  a
trapdoor with 3 handles, pull them in the order 2,1,3. This is to
open  the doors at level 5. Follow the map to level 4 to get  the
stone  heart. FInd your way to the grate at level 7. If you  have
not  find the key yet, speak the word QOLARIS to open the  secret
door in the room to the east of the grate.

URQASTUR - Sanctuary of Adron's Legions
=======================================

        This place is a bit unstable at first. There are a number
of portals that will teleport yourrty to some places the first
time  you step on them. However, the portal will be gone once  it
is activated. So don't be surprised when you are teleported to an
area not included in the maps provided. The maps only show  those
area that are stable.

        There  are  numerous  secret doors in  this  region.  The
password used are DRASZ and SALUNH. Speak them to open the secret
doors. Travel around to gather the 4 messages in gold.

        Use  the  teleporters to reach heart hall. When  you  are
there,  walk around the place, there is a spot where  your rty
will be able to get inside. The teleporter here is HEARTHALL. And
the  4 secret doors can be opened by speaking 4 words. The  words
are decode as follows:

        Pick the nth letter of the nth message and than put  them
together to form a word.

e.g.    First inspect runes, each letter is given however taken

answer: Firelight

        Open the secret doors and fight the creatures behind  it.
You  will need to fight a wraith, two fire drakes and  one  titan
before  you  can reach the last door. If you are  having  a  hard
time,  retreat  to  the teleporter and  rest  at  any  sanctuary.
Teleport  here again when you are strong enough. Behind the  last
door is another stone heart.

        The  fight with the Titan is very rewarding,  about  8000
experience  point per character. Keep on fighting him  until  all
your  characters  reach  level 15 and have get  all  the  crystal
rings.

UROQLAMN - Sanctuary of Adron's Palace
======================================

        You  will  find yourrty in a hall  covered  with  dice
squares.   You  will  find  Adron's  die  when  you  defeat   the
necromancers. Search for the secret door as indicate on the  map.
You  will  find a room with some buttons for you  to  press.  The
third button will add a diamond, the second button will light the
dice  square  equal to the number of diamonds. So,  the  sequence
should be 3,2, 3,2, 3,2, 3,2, 3,2, 3,2. Make sure all the 6  dice
squares are lit before you proceed. Go back to the hall to  check
it  out. The dice square should be lightened up by  now.  Casting
Adron's die when you are standing on the dice squares will  bring
you to another location.

        Now,  walk  to dice square 3 and cast the die.  You  will
find  yourself in the next location, walk east and you will  find
Sagaris.  Speak SAGARIS to open the secret door and follows  him.
He  will  brief  you  on your mission.  The  teleporter  here  is
SURAQIS.  The altar here will be able to let your  priest  invoke
TULAR  to provide food for yourrty. The other teleporter  here
will bring you to a code machine just follow the map.

        Search this area for secret doors to find all the  hidden
messages. You will need to find the beacon codes, beacon commands
and instructions.

        After  that,  go to the next level and visit  all  the  4
quadrants. Take note of the 4 quadrant keys. There are 4 gargoyle
riddles  in this area. The answers are: HAMMER,  SAGARIS,  PRIEST
and  MAGICIAN. If you answered incorrectly, you will be  sent  to
some  other  places. From what I know, there  are  two  different
places.  In the first place, you can get out by  walking  through
the  walls.  In the second place, there is no way to get  out  by
searching  or  walking.  Instead, check  the  inventory  of  your
magician,  a strange scroll is added to his bacck. By  reading
it,  the rty  will be able to escape  from  here.  Behind  the
riddles are four prophecies about the future of Eriosthe.

        Cast  Adron's die to reach the next level. There will  be
another  3  riddles  in  this place. The  first  two  riddles  is
obvious,  as  for  the  third,  inspect  Areth's  plague.   After
answering  the  riddles, you will find Uukrul inside.  Since  you
don't  have the obsidian heart yet, he will disappear before  you
can  kill him. The fight is not difficult though. Cast MUZAQ  two
times and he will disappear.

     Now,  search Uukrul's room, you will find two secret  doors,
speak UUKRUL to open it. You will find another stone heart and  a
code book.

        By  now  you should have found at least  6  stone  hearts
already, go to the heart urn and insert the hearts. You will then
be able to get the obsidian heart of Uukrul.

        Use  Adron's  die to goto the hall with 5  dice  squares.
Step  onto the square with 5 stars and cast the die.  Follow  the
map and find your way to the Beacon Arming Machine.

Beacon Arming Sequence:
        use code machine, enter code, command, key
e.g.    enter VGAK, DIVIDE, 6
        result: north quadrant 1231

Alternative Arming Sequence:
        use code book, translate code, then apply command with key.
e.g.    using code book, V=7, G=3, A=8, K=6
        therefore, 7386 DIVIDE 6 = 1231

        Enter  the arming sequence in the order  north,east,south
and west. The beacon will then be armed.

        After arming the beacon, go back to find Uukrul. Cast the
obsidian  heart  in his presence and he will be trapped  in  this
plane  forever.  His soul will always regenerate his  hit  points
when he is critical, only the obsidian hammer can split his  soul
and kill him. After killing him, you will find an ornate key. Use
the key to open the grate in his room.

        His treasure room contains large amount of money and some
precious  items.  But you should have no need for  them  now,  so
proceed to the next sanctuary.

URXASZEL - Sanctuary Beyond the Beacon
======================================

        Sagaris  will give you instructions when you reach  here.
There is nothing in this place, but you will need to go to  CHAOS
to save Mara.

CHAOS
=====

        At  any teleporter, enter CHAOS and you will be  here.  A
map  of CHAOS is given. In this place thessages  warp  around,
i.e.  if you head north, after sometime you will reach  the  same
old  place.  Most of the walls are one sided, i.e. you  can  walk
through  one  side of them but not both. Many spinner  traps  are
found here, so check your map and coss. At certain  locations,
your  coss  will not work and you can't map.  Well,  there  is
nevertheless a good news: there is absolutely no fighting in this
place. Just puzzles solving.

        So, to aid you in your quest, i have found a very  simple
way  for  you  to rescue Mara. Follow  the  instructions  closely
unless you want to do it your own way.

1. Give the 5 card of moving to your magician. When you step  out
of the teleporter CHAOS. Walk to the elevator just infront of the
cage  where Mara is trapped. You will be teleported to  a  place,
head  east  and you will find a teleporter there. It  has  button
numbered 1 to 4.

2. Press 3. Walk east, east to get reach the card room. Get card.
But  don't  give the card to your magician yet. Go out  and  step
into the elevator again. Walk to teleporter.

3.  Press  2. Walk north, then west to get the ornate  key.  Walk
west,  west then face east. You will find a grate here.  Open  it
with  the key and step into it. Read the map. Turn back and  walk
outside.  If  you  cannot  find the grate,  you  can  go  to  the
teleporter again and press button 3, then walk east then west  to
find the grate.

4.  Give the 6th card to your magician. Walk into  the  elevator.
You  will can to a place where you cannot map. You will  need  to
touch all six latches within 18 steps.

        . . R
        L   .
        .   E       A
        C . . . . V .
            .
            .
            Y       @ <- you will be here when you step into elevator

   You might need to perform this sequence a few time. Head north
until  you  reach  latch  A. Make  sure  the  message  "mechanism
restarted"  is there, otherwise you need to move around until  it
is so. After that, follow theth indicated: A - V - C - L - R -
E - Y. When you have done that, the cage imprisoning Mara will be
opened.

5. Now find you way back to Mara cage. Make sure you don't  touch
the  latches  again,  otherwise  you will need  to  go  back  and
activate them again. Walk inside the cage and save Mara.

6.  Let  your  magician carries only 5 cards and  walk  into  the
elevator. Walk east to the teleporter and press 3. Walk south and
you  will  be  at  the  teleporter  CHAOS.  You  can  go  to  any
sanctuaries  to  save the game if you want to repeat  the  ending
sequence. Otherwise enter BEACON at the teleporter.

BEACON
======

        Sagaris  and Mara will be waiting for you here. You  will
need  to enter the last verse for the prayer LAIRIAN in order  to
light the beacon. When the beacon is lit, sit back and watch  the
end game.
