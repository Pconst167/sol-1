   OK, to start off with, 'The Insti-
tute' is the type of adventure where
you do a lot of dashing from point 'A',
to point 'C', maybe a quick stop-off at point 'B', then back again.  This means, that there are a lot of moves required to solve this adventure (around 325). So since you can only save one game per disk, I suggest that you take the files "VENSAV" and "VENLOD", and place them on a few other disks so that you will be able to save more then one game.

   Next, I'd like to point out that there are also a lot of moves that you
would not need to do if you wanted to
go a bit more faster through the solve.
So, I have included an asterisk (one of
these "*") in front of these moves.
When you see one of these, you can either ignore it, or follow, but, if
there are more then one them in a row,
don't start in the middle or you'll 
find something won't work.

   You should follow everything in
brackets, and in parenthesis are comments or extra directions I might make.
