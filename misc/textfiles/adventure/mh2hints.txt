Problem:
What's the object of this game?
Hint:
After being  forced to become  a Manhunter in  New York by  the Orb
Alliance,  You discovered  that Phil  Cook, an  Orb ally,  was a
dangerous killer. As the game  begins, Phil is escaping from New
York  in his  spaceship. You   chase him  in a  second spaceship
vowing not  to let him  get away. Having  chased him across  the
country  you crash  land in  San Francisco.  Find Phil before he
kills again, help defeat the Orbs!!
Hint:
Most clues are visual and symbolic.  You must look carefully at the
screen to determine how the clue in that screen ties in with the
rest of the  game. Take notes as you play.  Save the game often.
The game  shows you what you  are able to do,  what you can get,
and where you are able to go.
Hint:
If the cursor is an arrow, press <ENTER> to move in that direction.
If the  cursor is a  magnifying glass, press  <ENTER> to take  a
closer  look. If  your cursor  is  a  hand, you  may pick  up or
manipulate the  object by pressing  <ENTER>. If the  cursor is a
#3,  you are  in third  person perspective  and are  able to see
yourself on the screen.
Hint:
Press <F3> to travel. You will be shown a map of San Francisco. All
the locations you are authorized to investigate are indicated by
a blinking square.  The number of  locations you can  visit will
increase as the game progresses. Use your arrow keys or joystick
to position the  blue and red circle over  the location you want
to travel to and press <ENTER>.
Hint:
Press the  <TAB> key to  view your inventory  screen. Highlight the
item you wish  to use by using the up-down  arrow keys and press
<ENTER>.
Hint:
The MAD  (for Manhunter Assignment  Device) is a  personal computer
that has  two functions: INFO  and TRACKER. The  MAD is standard
equipment for all Manhunters.
Hint:
The  yellow target  is the  person you  are currently tracking. The
tracker  will allow  you to  see exactly  where your suspect has
traveled. If  more than one  person is involved  in the criminal
activity, you may  put your cursor over the  other suspect while
tracking, and quickly press <ENTER> to tag the new suspect.

Problem:
What do I do at the crash site?
Hint:
Move your cursor to the green  card on the ground. Press <ENTER> to
take the  I.D. card. Note  the name "Peter  Brown" on the  card.
Enter "Peter Brown" into your MAD. You will assume Peter Brown's
identity. Peter Brown's apartment is now yours.
Hint:
At the crash site. Move your  cursor to the rectangular blue object
on  the  ground  and  pick  it  up.  Peter  Brown was tracking a
suspect. Use  the Tracking function to  track the suspect. Watch
as the suspect travels from the bank to the warehouse, the Ferry
Building, and  the Embarcadero Fountain.  Travel to the  Bank of
Canton.

Problem:
What do I do at the Bank of Canton?
Hint:
Enter the bank  through the same door that  the suspects used. Take
the dragon note that is on  the desk. Take the newspaper that is
lying  on the  floor. Note  the  name  of the  scientist in  the
article. Look at the dead man's  left hand. Read the name on the
door as if  you were standing outside. Enter  the name into your
MAD computer.

Problem:
There is no one named "Bat Vomit" in the city!
Hint:
The name is reversed. Enter the  correct name "Tad Timov" into your
MAD. Tad  Timov is the dead  security guard that worked  for the
Bank of Canton. Your character will  be now be able to travel to
his apartment. But  first exit the bank and go  to the left. You
will find a dead body.

Problem:
What do I do with the dead body I found near the bank?
Hint:
Look at the  large bite on the victim's neck,  take the broken fang
that is lodged in his skin. Pick up the laundry receipt, look at
the tattoo on his hand. Travel to the warehouse.

Problem:
I can't get into the warehouse office!
Hint:
Set the arcade mode to "EASY".  Avoid the robots. Enter the room at
the bottom-left corner of the screen.

Problem:
What do I do in the warehouse office?
Hint:
Read the  schedule message on  the wall. Take  a close look  at the
message written in blood on the  top of the desk. Note the first
names  in the  message, Zac  and Mic,  and the  contents of  the
message. Pick up the mallet  leaning against the wall and notice
the fish imprint on the end. Travel to Tad Timov's apartment.

Problem:
What should I do at Tad's apartment?
Hint:
Wait and you will be attacked by a guard dog. There is nothing else
you can do here, YET. Travel to the Ferry Building.

Problem:
What should I do at the Ferry Building?
Hint:
The doors are  locked so you cannot go in.  There is a message that
you  must look  at on  the side  of the  building. You cannot do
anything else here, YET. Travel to the Embarcadero Fountain.

Problem:
What should I do at the fountain?
Hint:
Jump in. Try to enter the pipe on the right side.

Problem:
How can I enter the pipe in the fountain?
Hint:
Set the arcade mode to "EASY". You need to get into the pipe on the
right, but you keep slipping on slime. Anytime you get too close
to the drain,  press <ENTER> to spin away.  When you slide close
to the pipe opening press  <ENTER> several times until you slide
right in.

Problem:
I keep getting my face eaten by rats and bats!
Hint:
Set the arcade mode to "EASY". Stand  in one place as you punch and
stomp. Don't  try to move  forward yet. The  rats and bats  will
eventually stop coming. Move forward when they stop.

Problem:
What do I do in the den?
Hint:
Take the  driver's license that  is lying on  the floor. Match  the
last name, "STONE" with the first name that you read on the desk
in the  warehouse office. Enter the  name in your MAD.  Take the
empty flask. Look at the dead  creature. Read the message on the
wall.

Problem:
Where do I go after I leave the den?
Hint:
Travel to the Hyde Street Pier.

Problem:
What do I do at the pier?
Hint:
Climb down  the ladder. Look into  the pipe on the  beach. Go under
the pier and climb the piling. Notice the hole in the pier. You
can't do anything  here for now, but you  will come back later.
Travel to the Manhunter's apartment.

Problem:
What do I do at the Manhunter's apartment?
Hint:
Look out the window to reveal various messages. Look in the dresser
drawer, take the cloth.

Hint:
The Bank of Canton, warehouse, Ferry Building, Embarcadero Fountain
and the Hyde Street Pier.

Problem:
What items should I have in my robe?
Hint:
Peter  Brown's I.D.  Card, Tad  Timov's dragon  note, the newspaper
clipping, the fang, the laundry receipt, the mallet, Mic Stone's
driver's license, the empty flask,  and the cloth that says "Rub
jewel of heaven".

Problem:
Getting started on day 2.
Hint:
The Orbs gave you an assignment. Press  <F3> to travel to pier 5 to
do  some investigating.  Use the  MAD tracker  to tag  the other
suspects.

Problem:
What do I do at pier 5?
Hint:
Look at the dead creature on the boat. Take the muzzle. Compare the
broken fang with the fang that you found in front of the bank.

Problem:
What do I do with the muzzle?
Hint:
Remember when Timov's dog attacked you? Return to his apartment and
muzzle the beast. Search his place for clues.

Problem:
What do I do at Tad Timov's apartment?
Hint:
When you see  Tad's dog, select the muzzle from  your robe that you
found  on the  boat. Take  the camera.  Note the  symbols on the
tapestry on the  wall that says "Heaven Vision."  Travel to the
Temple.

Problem:
I keep getting a Ninja's throwing star in my forehead, what can I do?
Hint:
Set the arcade mode to "EASY".  Defend yourself long enough and the
Buddah will  rise, allowing you  to climb the  sectet stairs. To
make the  arcade sequence a  little easier, save  the game every
time you dodge a few Ninja stars.

Problem:
OK, I'm in the stairway, now what?
Hint:
Examine all the statues. These statues provide two important clues.
Read the dragon note. "R3" means "RIGHT 3" - Replace R3 with the
word from  the third statue  on the right.  Replace L1 with  the
word on the  first statue on the left. Replace  R4 with the word
on the  fourth statue on the  right. Look at the  cloth that you
found  in the  drawer. It  says "Rub  jewel of  Heaven." Use the
cloth  on the  Heaven statue  for another  clue. Continue up the
stairway.

Problem:
What should the decoded dragon message say?
Hint:
"The R3 is the L1 to R4" = The Castle is the Gateway to Hell.

Problem:
What does the decoded "Heaven" message say?
Hint:
F+Oar P+inches = four pinches.

Problem:
I keep falling into a pool of acid! Help!
Hint:
Set the arcade mode to "EASY". Stay  in the center of the bridge as
you move across. Saving the  game after making it halfway across
will make crossing easier.

Problem:
A very  big man insists  on branding dragons  onto my hand!  I need some
advice.
Hint:
Don't touch the brand. Instead, run over, grab the scroll, and jump
out the window. Once outside, run to the right before the Ninjas
get you.

Problem:
I keep getting cut in half by a Ninja!

Problem:
What do I do with the scroll, what does it mean?
Hint:
West is  not a direction,  it is a  name. Match up  the name "West"
with one of the first names that you read back at the warehouse.
Enter "Zac West" into your MAD Info.

Problem:
I'm in the room with an old man with a twitching mustache. What do I do?
Hint:
Remember  the "Heaven"  message? Select  four pinches  from the pot
with the  "Heaven" marking (second  from left). Smoke  the pipe,
watch the vision and take the statue.

Problem:
What does the vision mean?
Hint:
You saw a  vision of the old man's daughter  turning into a mutant.
Remember her face, you will need to recognize her later. Travel
to the Shop.

Problem:
I'm at the  Shop and I can't figure out  what to do.
Hint:
The morbid shopkeeper seems to be holding a finger. If you had some
body parts  to give him he  might let you try  to play cards and
win  a prize.  If you  don't have  any, leave  and travel to the
TransAmerica pyramid.

Problem:
What are all those S's in the pyramid building?
Hint:
All of the S's are slaves.

Problem:
What do I do in the pyramid building?
Hint:
Take the rifle. Free the slave that the robot is punishing. To free
the slave set the arcade mode  to "EASY". The idea is to rotate
clockwise without getting hit. Move only when the robot aims at
you.  When you  are at  the top  of the  screen, the slave will
escape. Continue to  rotate until you are at  the bottom of the
screen. Walk off the screen and travel to the doctor's house.

Problem:
What do I do at the doctor's house?
Hint:
Get the letter from the doctor's pocket. Pour the urine sample into
the  flask  that  you  found  near  the Embarcadero Fountain by
selecting the  flask from your  inventory. Travel to  the cable
car barn.

Problem:
What should I do at the cable car barn?
Hint:
Hop onto a  cable car to get inside.  You need to go to  the box in
the upper-right  corner and bump  against the right  side. Pull
the switch to  open the gate. Run through the  gate. If you are
having difficulty set the arcade mode to "EASY" and try again.

Problem:
I found the cable car, what do I do?
Hint:
Look at the posters on the side  of the cable car. Look at the dead
man on the pile of bodies in  the car. Take the letter from his
belt.  Look at  his hand.  Leave the  same way  you came in and
travel to the private club. Knock on the door.

Problem:
They won't let me into the club or the laundry!
Hint:
You can't get  into the club because it's  private. It's for ratmen
only. Come back  later when you have a  disguise. Travel to the
laundry. The  laundry is closed, come  back tomorrow. Travel to
the scientist's house.

Problem:
How can I travel to the scientist's house?
Hint:
Type the name  "Noah Goring" into your MAD. You  picked up the name
"Noah" from  the newspaper clipping, "Goring"  from the doctor's
letter.

Problem:
What do I do at the scientist's house?
Hint:
Take the matches.  Look out the window. Read  the files. Notice the
white thread. Travel to the Wax Museum.

Problem:
What do I do at the Wax Museum?
Hint:
Notice the fish that the wax  figure is holding. You found a mallet
with  a fish  on it  at the  warehouse. Use  the mallet here to
smack the fish. Look at  the three propaganda exhibits (you can
see the other two exhibits after watching the film, then moving
left). At the last exhibit, look  in the chimney. Leave the wax
museum.  Select  travel,  if  you  have  completed  all  of the
activities in  day 2 you will  be sent to your  apartment. This
ends day 2.

Problem:
Whenever I  go to the Manhunter's  apartment and try to  lay down in the
hammock, it tells me that "It's too early to go to bed". Why?
Hint:
You have not completed all of the activities in Day 2.

Problem:
What are the locations I may have missed?
Hint:
Pier 5, Tad Timov's apartment, the Temple, the Temple stairway, the
Ninja initiation room, the room with  the old man and the smoke,
the  shop, the  TransAmerica building,  the doctor's  house, the
cable car barn, Noah Gorings house, and the Wax Museum.

Problem:
What additional items should I have in my robe?

Hint:
Zac West and Noah Goring.
Hint:
The additional items  you should have are, the  camera, the scroll,
the statue, the rifle, letter #1, letter #2, the full flask, and
the matches.

Problem:
Where should I go first?
Hint:
Travel to  the  laundry.  You  will  see  a  girl. Move towards the
girl. Give the girl the laundry receipt. When she winks at you,
follow her. It's a trap... but you must fall for it.

Problem:
I was clubbed and came to in the dark, what now?
Hint:
The slave you freed released you. Take the walking stick. Leave the
laundry and travel to Ghirardelli Square and investigate.

Problem:
What should I do at Ghirardelli Square?
Hint:
Get the rat's paw. Then travel to the shop.

Problem:
What do I do at the shop?
Hint:
Give the  man at the  counter the rat's  paw. He will  let you play
cards. Find  the ace three times.  Don't take a prize  yet, play
and find  the ace three more  times. When he offers  you a prize
this time, select the mask on the left.

Problem:
I can't beat this guy at the card game.
Hint:
Set  the arcade  mode to  "EASY". Watch  carefully, he's  trying to
trick you with a false shuffle. To beat that con, save the game
as soon  as the shuffle is  completed, then choose the  ace. If
you're wrong, just  restore the game. After you  leave the shop
travel to the private club.

Problem:
I still can't get into the club.
Hint:
Get as close as you can to the door. Wear the mask and knock on the
door.

Problem:
What do I do at the club?
Hint:
Get as close as you can to the door. Wear the mask and knock on the
door.  When  the  ratman  shows  you  the  arm, note the symbols
tattoed on  it. Play dice. When  the ratmen get mad  at you give
them the flask. While they are fighting over the flask, grab the
hatchet and leave. Travel to Ghirardelli Square again.

Problem:
What do I do this time at Ghirardelli Square?
Hint:
Try to climb up the sign to the man hanging up there. You will need
to get  the ring that  is hanging around  his neck. If  you have
difficulty climbing the sign set the arcade mode to "EASY".

Problem:
I keep getting zapped by the guy with the shocking personality.
Hint:
Don't touch  him. Use the walking  stick to take the  ring from his
neck.

Problem:
Anything else I should do at Ghirardelli Square?
Hint:
Go into  the window in the  tower. When you reach  the gate, take a
close look.

Problem:
My flask keeps breaking while I'm at Ghirardelli Square!
Hint:
Go back  to the private club  and find the proper  time to give the
flask away.

Problem:
How do I open the gate?
Hint:
Notice that the  pattern on the lock is the  same as the ring. Open
the lock with the ring.

Problem:
Ok, I've opened the gate and now I've got real trouble!

Problem:                 
I've return to the Wax Museum and don't know what to do.
Hint:
Investigate where  both suspects went.  There is fresh  meat on the
pile of bodies in exhibit  #2. Examine Noah Goring carefully. Go
into  the fireplace  in the  last exhibit.  When done  leave the
museum. Travel to the Hyde Street Pier.

Problem:
I've found Noah Goring, but I don't know what to do with him.
Hint:
Use the fang to cut the white thread on his tie. Take the card.

Problem:
What do I do at the Hyde Street Pier.
Hint:
Go  under the  pier. Climb  up the  piling. Use  the hatchet to cut
through the bottom of the crate. Hide in the crate.

Problem:
How do I get out of the crate?
Hint:
Use the hatchet.

Problem:
The mutants keep stomping me!
Hint:
Look at  the mutant in  the second cell,  middle row. That's  Ming.
Remember her from the vision you saw after smoking the pipe with
her father? Give her the statue.

Problem:
How do I free the mutants?
Hint:
Insert the  Orb card that you  found in Noah Goring's  tie into the
cell door-access  machine. Fool the camera  into thinking you're
and Orb by using the Orb-On-A-Stick.

Problem:
How do I escape?
Hint:
Use the balloon.

Problem:
How do I use the balloon?
Hint:
Turn on  the gas, light the  gas with the matches  you found at the
scientist's house.

Problem:
Where do I land?
Hint:
Land at Julius Castle.

Problem:
I'm in the control room and confused. What do I do?
Hint:
Take a closer look at the  controls. Close all of the gates. Select
the ROBOT button  - move all of the robots  to the lowest sensor
square in the center. Select the  SLAVE button - move all of the
slaves into Slavery.  Select the LAVA button -  open the gate on
the  bottom right  to flood  the robots.  Open the bottom center
gate to flood the cable car barn. Open the gate next to the lava
in the  second row down,  center to flood  the pyramid and  Coit
Tower.  Watch as  the mutants  turn into  people again. Move the
slaves into Hell.

Problem:
I'm at Freedom. How do I use the digger?
Hint:
When you are in  the digger, punch in the code that  you saw on the
severed arm. Press the START button.

Problem:
What is the code for the digger?
Hint:
UNNC

Problem:
I can't make it through the lava maze!
Hint:
Set the  arcade mode to  "EASY". Save the  game often. You  need to
reach the  Ferry Building in  the upper-right corner  of the far
upper-right section.

Problem:
The lava maze is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE!
Hint:
We have a map of the lava maze available and would be happy to mail
it to you. Leave a message for Customer Service on this BBS. You
may  also  obtain  the  lava  map  by  writing or calling Sierra
On-Line's Customer Service Department.
