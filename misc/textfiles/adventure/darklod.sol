                 Walk Through by Dorothy Millard (C64 Version)


Scenario


You journey through a mirror which leads you to the alterworld where you must
defeat the Dark Lord Nequam who killed your grandfather.


Note

 1. Dark Lord has some "real-time" puzzles, 16-color "draw and fill" graphics,
    multi-channel music and animation that continues while you type.

 2. There is a self-running demo, a tutorial adventure, easy and hard skill
    levels, and a randomiser replay feature.
