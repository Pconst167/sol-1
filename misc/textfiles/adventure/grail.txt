-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The beginning:
==============

IN THE CASTLE:
--------------

You'll find yourself inside camelot standing on a floor plan of the castle.
You can walk around by using the cursor keys or the mouse.
When you reach a certain room, a message window will appear. You can enter the
room by pressing ENTER or just click the mouse.
First go to merlin's room. It's the little tower room on the right.
The big tower room beneath it is your treasury.
Enter merlin's room.
"LOOK AT ROOM", "LOOK AT OBJECTS", "LOOK AT WIZARD", "ASK ABOUT GAWAINE".
"ASK ABOUT GALAHAD", "ASK ABOUT LAUNCELOT", "ASK ABOUT QUEEN".
"TALK TO MERLIN", leave the room and go to the queens bower.
"LOOK AT BOWER", "LOOK FLOWERS". Walk over to the rose, "GET ROSE".
"ASK ABOUT THE MESSAGE OF THE ROSE", "TALK TO QUEEN" 4 times.
"KISS GWENHYVER" as much as you like. But after a few times it gets boring.
She's not into any major loving at this time.
Well back to some serious adventuring again.
"ASK ABOUT LAUNCELOT". Leave the room and go to your own room.
It's to rooms to the left from the bower.
"LOOK ROOM", "LOOK CLOTHES", "CHANGE CLOTHES", "GET PURSE". Leave the room and
go back to merlin's room. "ASK ABOUT THE GRAIL", "LOOK AT MAP". Walk to the map
and "STUDY MAP". Use the arrow keys or the mouse to move around the map. Study
all the places on the map. Press <F6> to leave the map. Walk over to merlin's
desk and "LOOK DESK", "LOOK AT SCROLL", "READ SCROLL", "GET SCROLL". Walk over
to the table, "GET BEAKER", "GET FLASK". Merlin is a bit pissed off because you
can't keep your hands to yourself. Just "APOLOGIZE" or restore your game. You
did save your game didn't you. You didn't save it ?. So what's the point of
writing a good advice at the beginning of all our solutions if you don't pay any
attention to it. Well life sucks, once a janitor always a janitor ???. Oops
wrong solution. Now walk to the chest and "OPEN CHEST", "GET LODESTONE". Leave
this room and go to the treasury. Walk over to the man, "TALK MAN", "GIVE
PURSE", "GET GOLD", "GET SILVER", "GET COPPER", "GET PURSE", "ASK ABOUT
BUNDLES", "ASK ABOUT GAWAINE". Go back to merlin's room "TALK TO MERLIN". Go to
the chapel of the two Gods. It's the tower in the lower left hand  corner. Go to
the left symbol. It's the symbols of the warrior god mithras. "KNEEL", "PRAY",
"GIVE MONEY", give 1 gold piece. Look and listen to the vision that appears. ,
"STAND", go to the right symbol. "KNEEL", "GIVE MONEY", give 1 gold piece. Look
at the vision of the grail. "STAND", "LOOK FLAMES". This religious stuff is very
expensive, don't you think. Go back to the treasury and let the man refill your
purse. It's not neccesary but doesn't it feel great to be rich !. Now go back to
merlin's room and "TALK TO MERLIN". Leave the room and go the the outer
courtyard. Walk to the guard standing opposite of your horse, "TALK MAN", "ASK
ABOUT GALAHAD". Go to the left of your horse and "MOUNT HORSE". Use the arrow
keys to steer the horse out the castle and through the gate. The mule will
follow you.

GLASTONBURY TOR:
----------------

Now travel to GLASTONBURY TOR. In the clearing there is a shrine of some sort.
If the widdershins appear "GIVE MONEY", 1 copper is enough. Go to the statue.
"LOOK STATUE", now go WEST.

1 silver will do the trick.
"ASK ABOUT GAWAINE", "ASK ABOUT TOR", "ASK ABOUT GRAIL", "ASK ABOUT BOARS".
"BUY SPEAR", "PAY", 1 gold coin. "ASK ABOUT BLACK KNIGHT". Now go WEST.
It doesn't matter is your mule runs of. You'll find him soon enough.
You're now in a arcade sequence where you have to fight the wild boars.
Use the SPACEBAR to thrust your spear into the boar. If you have difficulty
with the boars just set the arcade difficulty to easy.
Mind you, you'll get less points.
After killing the boars go WEST. "TALK TO CROW", "YES". Go over to the skeleton
and "LOOK SKELETON", "GET SILK". Now go EAST.
Again you're in a arcade sequence.

"PUT GAWAINE ON HORSE" and walk EAST.
Walk up to the hag and "TALK TO HAG", "GIVE SLEEVE".
Walk to the pedestal and "LOOK PEDESTAL", "READ INSCRIPTION".
The missing words of the inscription are . . . .  A RIDDLE.
So you have to solve some riddles, big deal !. Go WEST.
Now you've reached the magic barrier of the mad monk. Just try walking through
the stones. Walk up to one of the stones. "TALK STONE".
Type in the word that solves the riddle. If you typed the correct word, the
stone will start to glow. Do this with all the five stones. Then you can cross
the barrier.
If you want the solution to all the riddles just write or call sierra on line
and they will give them to you.

WE DON'T KNOW THE RIDDLES BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT EACH TIME.

Now go WEST on the hill. You are transported into the ruins of glastonbury tor.

YES FOLKS BELIEVE IT OR NOT, HERE IT COMES AGAIN.

FLOWER TEST
-----------

When light is dim and courage fails,		Almond Blossom
When heart against adversity rails,
When it seems you will never see the dawn,
This alone can drive you on.

If a dream is abandoned,			Anemone
Or a purpose dies,
These are left with the dregs
Of bitterness and sighs.

It can be sweet on the tongue,			Yellow Lily
Or vile as a curse,
To hear it is evil,
To believe it is worse.

In time of grief,				Poppy
It gives relief,
It can lessen fears,
Ease the pain of tears.

Oh, it is splendid,				Sunflower
It has no peer,
It scorns the lesser,
And holds itself dear.

Known to the priest				Cornflower
And nun,
Who natural pleasures
Do shun.

Surrounded by giants,				ButterCup
Your worries were few,
Wonders abounded,
The world was new.

Wise are they					Chrysantemum
who seek it,
Fools are they
who believe without it,
Scorn those who claim
To own it.

It alleviates all pain and sorrows,		Daffodil
The final end of all tomorrows,
That to which we all must go,
Rich or poor, high or low.

For its sweet sake,				Forget-me-Not
You suffer in silence,
What we both most desire,
But will never possess.

STONES RIDDLES
--------------

Three lives have I.				Water
Gentle enough to soothe the skin,
Light enough to caress the sky,
Hard enough to crack rocks.
     What am I?

Lighter than what                               Iceberg
I am made of,
More of me is hidden
Than is seen.
     What am I?

When I am filled                                ...
I can point the way,
When I am empty
Nothing moves me,
I have two skins
One without and one within.
     What am I?

If a man carried my burden                      ...
He would break his back.
I am not rich,
But leave silver in my track.
     What am I?

My life can be measured in hours,               Candle
I serve by being devoured.
Thin, I am quick
Fat, I am slow
Wind is my foe.
     What am I?

To unravel me                                   Riddle
You need a simple key,
No key that was made
By locksmith's hand,
But a key that only I
Will understand.
     What am I?

Weight in my belly,                             Ship
Trees on my back,
Nails in my ribs,
Feet I do lack.
     What am I?

If you break me                                 ...
I do not stop working,
If you touch me
I may be snared,
If you lose me
Nothing will matter.
     What am I?

I turn around once,                             Key
What is out will not get in.
I turn around again,
What is in will not get out
     What am I?

I am only useful                                ...решето
When I am full,
Yet I am always
Full of holes.
     What am I?

You can see nothing else                        Mirror
When you look in my face,
I will look you in the eye
And I will never lie.
     What am I?

I drive men mad                                 Gold
For love of me,
Easily beaten,
Never free.
     What am I?

Glittering points                               ...metheors
That downward thrust,
Sparkling spears
That never rust.
     What am I?

When set loose                                  ...
I fly away,
Never so cursed
As when I go astray.
     What am I?

When young, I am sweet in the sun.              Wine
When middle-aged, I make you gay.
When old, I am valued more than ever.
     What am I?

I am always hungry,                             Fire
I must always be fed,
The finger I lick
Will soon turn red.
     What am I?

Each morning I appear                           Shade
To lie at your feet,
All day I follow
No matter how fast you run,
Yet I nearly perish
In the midday sun.
     What am I?

Bright as diamonds,                             Sea
Loud as thunder,
Never still,
A thing of wonder.
     What am I?

You heard me before,                            Echo
Yet you hear me again,
Then I die,
'Til you call me again.
     What am I?

Lovely and round,                               Pearl
I shine with pale light,
grown in the darkness,
A lady's delight.
     What am I?

Until I am measured                             Time   
I am not known,
Yet how you miss me
When I have flown.
     What am I?

All about, but cannot be seen,                  Air
Can be captured, cannot be held,
No throat, but can be heard.
     What am I?

I am seen in the water                          Blue
If seen in the sky,
I am in the rainbow,
A jay's feather,
And lapis lazuli.
     What am I?

I go around in circles                          Wheel
But always straight ahead,
Never complain
No matter where I am led.
     What am I?

At the sound of me, men may dream               Music
Or stamp their feet
At the sound of me, women may laugh
Or sometimes weep.
     What am I?
