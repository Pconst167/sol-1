                                   | GETTING STARTED | 
                                   +-----------------+
Problem:
What's the basic idea behind this game? How do I play?

Hint:
Help all  the babes in the  game. Find a babe.  Talk to her. Find  out what she
needs,  get it  for her,  and get   ready for  some gratitude.  Not! Don't  get
frustrated. Helping  one babe may allow  you to eventually find  the right babe
for you.

Problem:
How do I get started?

Hint:
If you're in the  front lobby at the beginning of the  game, try talking to the
front desk clerk  to get your room key.  Go up the stairs to  your room, unlock
your door and go  inside. Look at the table. Try calling  all the phone numbers
on the cards on the table. Go to  the bathroom. Use the sink. Look at the brown
water. Call maintenance to send a plumber up to fix it.

Problem:
How do I use the elevator or the ice machine next to my room?

Hint:
Some things are  not useful at the beginning  of the game such as  the elevator
and  ice machine.  We're going  to try  hard to  make you  forget about certain
things that you see early on, so keep  your eyes peeled and remember to look at
things later that you couldn't use at the start!
                                   
                                   +--------+
                                   | GAMMIE | 
                                   +--------+
Problem:                            
What does Gammie want?

Hint:
Gammie wants to use the Cellulite Machine. You'll have to fix it.

Problem:
How do I repair the Cellulite machine's piston?

Hint:
Go to the dining  room. Walk into the kitchen. Put your  hand in the garbage to
find a can of  lard. Take the lard and use it to  lubricate the large piston on
the left.

Problem:
How do I repair the Cellulite machine's ripped vacuum hose?

Hint:
Go to the Mud  Bath and walk one screen to the right  to reach the Weight Room.
There is a wide rubber belt on  the BunShaker machine. If the BunShaker machine
is  being used,  talk to  the  body-builder,  Thunderbird. Leave  the room  and
return. The BunShaker should be vacant and  you can take the belt. Use the belt
on the hole in the vacuum hose of the Cellulite Machine.

Problem:
How do I clean the Cellulite machine's filter?

Hint:
Use a  wrench on the  filter tank bolt.  Open the filter  lid. Take the clogged
filter and use it  on the sink in the Kitchen to clean  it. Put the filter back
in the filter tank. Close the lid and tighten the bolt with the wrench.

Problem:
Where can I find a wrench?

Hint:
You can get a wrench from the plumber. Go to your bathroom and run the water in
the sink.  If you see brown  water, call maintenance at  extension 76 to report
your plumbing  problems. If the  water is clear,  stuff a roll  of toilet paper
down the  toilet. You can  get some toilet  paper from the  front of the maid's
cart  that appears  every now  and  then  outside your  room. When  the plumber
arrives, click the pick-up icon next to  the plumber to get the wrench. Use the
pick-up icon, not the hand icon. Take his file too, you might need it.

Problem:
I think the machine works, but I can't seem to tell Gammie.  Why?

Hint:
Give the machine a  test run. Turn it on. Wait for  the message that everything
is okay. Once you see the message, shut the machine down and go talk to Gammie.

Problem:
Where can I get an orange?

Hint:
Go to the Dining Room. Click your hand on the salad bar to find an orange. Take
the orange.

Hint:

then outside  your room. Click  the washcloth on  the pool. Go  to the Kitchen.
Open the refrigerator door. Put the wet cloth inside and close the fridge door.
Leave the Kitchen. Return to the Kitchen and open the fridge. Use the take icon
to pick up the cool cloth.

Problem:
Where can I get some mineral water?

Hint:
If Gammie asks for some mineral water, go to the hallway door east of the Blues
Bar to find a room service tray. Take the mineral water off the tray.

Problem:
After I helped Gammie, she took off!  Why did I go through all this?

Hint:
Gammie left  behind a lot  of excess cellulite.  This can be  useful. Go to the
beach and click your hand on the sand  to find a whale oil lamp. Click the lamp
on the  drainage faucet in  the center  of  the Cellulite Drainage  room. Get a
match in the Blues Bar and click your zipper on it to light it. Light the lamp,
and you'll find you've created a Lamp of Knowledge. Pretty neat, huh?
                                   
                                   +------+

Hint:
Walk one  screen left of  the Front Desk.  Open the hallway  door to enter  the
Health Spa. Rose is in the High  Colonic Treatment room through the door on the

Problem:
What does Rose want?

Hint:
Look around the  High Colonic Treatment room. You'll see  lots of flowers. Rose
loves flowers. You need to get some more flowers for Rose. The only flowers you
can take are in  your room. If you don't have your room  key, talk to the front
desk girl to get  it. Get the flowers from the vase in  your room and give them
to Rose. She'll give you an orchid for all your troubles.

stage, try walking out of the bar for a little while and come back later.

Hint:
The Spa will not  serve alcohol, but you can find a place  that has beer. Go to
the  Mud Baths  and walk  right. Walk   through the  Weight Room  to enter  the
Aerobics  Room. Use  the empty  spot to  dance and  end the  class. Talk to the
aerobics instructor  and get her employee  badge. Go back to  the hall and walk
east until  you reach the gate  to the employee's campground.  Use the employee
badge to open the gate. Enter the tent and take some beer for Burgundy.

After she drinks the second six-pack, she'll meet you in the sauna.

Problem:
Where can I get a towel to wear in the sauna?

Hint:
You can  get a towel  in two different  places. You can  take a towel  from the
maid's cart that appears every now and then outside your room. You can also get
one from  Gary the Towel  Attendant in the  Health Spa. To  get the towel  from

screen.

Problem:
What does Shablee want?

Shablee wants an evening gown.

Problem:
Where can I find an evening gown?

sauna with her, you  can find the dress back-stage at the  bar. Click your hand
on the curtain to  walk on stage. Walk south of the  stage between the curtains
to find the dress. Take the dress and give it to Shablee.

Problem:

go upstairs to  your room. Look at the  cards on the table. Call  the Turn Down

return to your  room, a condom will be  left on your bed. Take  the condom, and
you'll meet Shablee on the beach.
