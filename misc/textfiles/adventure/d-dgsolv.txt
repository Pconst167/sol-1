============[ Death Gate Full Solve by Vulcan and Bucky / DREAD ]=============
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to this solve, I'd imagine not too many people actually played this 
due to its size (or just having tremendous troubles getting the damned thing 
to RUN in the first place ;), but here it is anyway, this document will only 
list the ESSENTIAL steps in finishing the game, you go ahead and look for the
jokes and other fun stuff like kicking someone else's chair while they're 
sitting on it :).

There's an end savegame included with the zip, copy this into your game
directory, load it, drop the nexus seal piece into the focus and you'll see
the ending...

Note that :-
      - When I say TALK to somebody, that means going through ALL the possible
        responses unless specified otherwise.
      - The total possible score is 1500 in this game, the numbers along the 
        right side of this text indicates the score you [SHOULD!] have 
        accumulated up to that point following this solve.
      - SAVE VERY DAMN OFTEN!!

Last Remarks - easy game, compared to "The Companion of Xanth" anyway, and I
actually got full score on this one, wow. =)  But these guys should really get
some help on the 3DS animations, though... they all are rather boring, esp.
the ending...<G>
