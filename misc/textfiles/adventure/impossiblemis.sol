A solution to Impossible Mission I. Impossible you think?
Actually it's not that difficult.

First you have to download the game from this page:

www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Pines/2062/download.html

Why from this page? Well, every time you start this game,
it starts at excactly the same position. That makes writing
a solution a lot easier. If you can't find it, please don't

                   "IMPOSSIBLE MISSION" - HINTS AND TIPS
            By Jaromir Krol - "Jerry King" - jaromirk@kki.net.pl
                  http://www.kki.net.pl/jaromirk/c64joke/


 This  great  game introduced speech synthesis to  the C64, and was one of the
 most  difficult  games of its time.  Without cheats and possibilites given by
 the various emulators, it still is!

 Elvin  Atombender, an evil genius, plans to do what all evil scientists do in
 their  weekends:  destroy the world. And you,  a  top secret agent, must stop
 him.  You  must  search his complex  underground  laboratory  and retrieve 36
 pieces  of a puzzle. Then you must put them together to form a correct image,
 and use it to open the door to Elvin's control room.

 I   recommend   playing  this  game  with   an  emulator  that  has  freezing
 capabilities,  or  with a program/card which  can  do it (Game Wizard, Action
 Replay...).  This  way,  you can freeze  before  dangerous situations, and if
 something isn't right, just try again from the same point.

 The  basic game is obvious, really - search all the objects in all the rooms,
 avoiding  robots  and doing a lot of  gymnastics (yes, I pasted this sentence
 from  my  "Impossible  Mission II" solution :).  In  the objects you can find
 platform  "resetters", robot freezers, and pieces of puzzle. Use the freezers
 and resetters in the terminals - every room has one (or more :). You can also
 get  those in the music rooms - there  are two in the maze (which is randomly
 chosen  at the beginning). When you enter  the room and use the keyboard, you
 hear  a number of tunes, starting with three. Your task is to put them in the
 right order - from the lowest one to the highest one.

 In one of the rooms, there is a large rectangle which you cannot search. It's
 the  door to Elvin's main room. When you  have the full puzzle, you can enter
 it to complete the game.

 The  puzzle  consists of nine parts, each  in turn consisting of four pieces.
 You must assemble all nine parts. Each completed part gives you one letter of
 a  password - such as ALBATROSS - and when you have all nine letters, you can
 open the security door.

 You  may  flip  and  turn the pieces  of  the  puzzle,  and even change their
 colours. You can phone your HQ for help, but it will always cost you a number
 of minutes. The full puzzle - solved - is an electronic access card.

 I  have the trained versions of both IMs on  my site, BTW, so you may want to
 get  them there: http://www.kki.net.pl/jaromirk/c64joke/ Check the games page
 to download the IMs. L8r!
