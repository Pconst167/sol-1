 JACK THE NIPPER 
 Gremlin 1986 

 CONTROLS : Keyboard, Kempston, Cursor
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 AIM : Jack the Nipper is the epitome of naughtiness - the naughtiest
 kid in town. Now he's trying to set a record for naughtiness. Can you
 ensure that he does it without getting busted?
 
 GAMEPLAY : JTN has a fair amount of arcade adventure elements - to
 bump up the Naughtyometer's rating you'll need to perform certain
 tasks. There are about twenty of these, but they're not that easy to
 do; quite apart from working out what to do and how to do it, the
 various other characters around the town will do their best to hinder
 you. Parents and shopkeepers will do their best to catch Jack, and
 ghosts will also pester him - although these can be exorcised with a
 well-aimed peashooter shot.

  If Jack collides with another character, he'll get a thrashing which
 will increase his nappy rash rating (shown at the bottom right of the
 screen). Too much rash and he'll be "self-spanked off" (a la Andrew
 Beckwith...) and lose a life. 

 COMMENTS : "An excellent game".
 RATING : 93% (CRASH #30, July 1986)

 NOW : An interesting, and graphically neat, arcade puzzle game.

HOW TO GET THE PEA-SHOOTER

In the Bedroom (E6), jump onto the chest of drawers and onto the cot. Bounce to
the other end of the cot and onto the shelf.

HOW TO BLOW UP THE COMPUTER

Go to the Police Station (C7) and take the Battery. Go to the Just Micro Shop
(C4) and stand next to the mirror-like object. When the shopkeeper goes into
the left hand corner, walk past the mirror and the computers will blow up. Now
do a runner or the shopkeeper slaps your botty, increasing rash factor.

HOW TO KILL THE FLOWERS

Go to I Bloom Plant Shop (A5), climb on the right hand shelf and take the
Weedkiller. Trot down to the Garden (G5) and drop the Weedkiller on the flowers
and watch them die. You can shoot the flowers first to gain more Naughty Points
if you're feeling particularly evil. Once the flowers are poisoned it's time
you weren't there or it'll be Smacky Time.

HOW TO DO THE TEETH

At the Launderette (C9), get the Pot of Glue from the top of the machine and
waddle down to the False Teeth Factory (A7). Wait until the keeper is at the
far end and then jump onto the conveyer belt nearest the door, then leggit.

HOW TO STOP SOCK PRODUCTION

Go back to the Police Station (C7) and into the Cell (C8). Get the weight and
take it to the Hummo Sock Factory (A6). Jump on the end of the conveyor belt
and run for it.

HOW TO GET THE CREDIT CARD FROM THE BEDROOM

Go to the right of the Bank screen (G3) and you should find a Key. Take this to
the Bank (F2). Drop everything but the Key. When the Safe guard moves away,
drop the key. Now your pockets are empty. Enter the safe and you should find
yourself in a Manic Miner-style room (E2). Jump to the top and get the Soap
Powder. Press enter and go through the door. You should end up on top of the
wardrobe. Pick-up the Credit Card.

HOW TO GET THE BOMB, HORN, AND FREE THE PRISONERS

Get the key from the Bank (F2) where you left it. Go to the Museum (C1/2) and
go through this hole again, drop the Key, but keep the Pea-Shooter, or you're
dead. Watch out for the Fireplace. On a shelf in the next room is a Horn, drop
the Horn by the door and go right. Ghosts start to home in on you at this point.
After three rooms you see a Bomb on the fireplace. Pick it up and go through
the door by the Horn. Go to the Police Station (C8) and into the Cells. Drop
the Bomb and all the prisoners escape. At this point the irate policemen chase
you and try and tan your hide. Yes, you guessed it, run away!

HOW TO MAKE A CAT FLY

Yes, you'll believe a cat can fly. Go to the room with the Horn in it and drop
the Pea-Shooter next to the door for a quick getaway. Sneak up behind the
slumbering puss and press FIRE. The befuddled pussy cat will now sink it's
claws very firmly into the ceiling and will not come down until it's been
pacified by it's owner and given some Good Cat Munchies. Beeping your Horn
under the cat annoy's people lots, and you gain more Naughty Points.

HOW TO FOUL UP THE COMPUTER FACTORY

Go to the Bank (F2) and drop the Key. When the guard moves, run forwards and
pick up the Floppy Disk. Now go to Technology (A9) and jump at the table with
one computer on it and then leg it, quickly.

HOW TO DO THE LAUNDRY

Get the Soap from E2 and go to the Launderette (C9). Jump onto the socks and
the machines start to bubble furiously, a bit like the grown-ups.

HOW TO OVERDRAW A BANK ACCOUNT

Get the Credit Card and go to the Bank (G2). Jump at the Cash Dispenser on the
wall and watch it explode.

HOW TO ANNOY THE GARDEN KEEPER

After killing the man's flowers you feel a might remorseful. Trot down to the
Graveyard (G6) and shoot the ghostie. Pick up the Fertilizer and drop it on the
nice man's rotting flowers (G5). Now the nice man is very happy .... or is he?

HOW TO SCARE YOUR SIBLINGS

If you go into the Playschool (E1) and through the door you find the kiddie's
clay table. Take this to a room full of screaming youngsters (F1). Now the
children have a real monster to play with, tee, hee.

HOW TO MAKE THE CHINA SHOP MAN VERY ANGRY

Take the Potty from the Playschool (E1). Beware because it's not empty, Ho, Ho.
Trot down to the China Shop (C6) and smash it and any other objects you are
carrying.

THE GAME IS FINISHED. YOU ARE INDEED A LITTLE HORROR. TEE, HEE.
