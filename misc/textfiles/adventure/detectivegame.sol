 you must search is down. Understand?. You can't see it. I hope you
 understand. Continue searching this wall with the lens and you will
 find a secret passage. Go in. Take the screwdriver.
 Use screwdriver with locket. You get an OPEN LOCKET (CLUE#10).
 Put the open locket in the sealed envelope.

 * Before choose the murderer go to Major's room and take the blank
   bullets and the elephant gun.

 * During the game, you can follow Bentley, the butler, until he enter
   in his room. Here, you can search the wardrobe. You find Bentley's
   jacket. In the jacket there are the keys. 
   Those keys open Bentley's room (if you are locked inside) and
   the study that is the room on the left.
   In the study you can find some bullets. Simply take the bullets and 
   replace them with the blank bullets.

 Now, you can choose the who is the bad guy. Who is?. Guess...
 The lights goes out...
 Naturally to stop the escape, use the elephant gun on the murderer..

 * I found three secret passages in the MacFungus residence. One is in
   the kitchen and link the kitchen with the cellar. In the cellar
   there is the second secret passage that link the cellar with the 
   dining room. The third and last secret passage I have discovered is
   from the Major's room and the reverend's room. Try it out!.
   I think there are no others.
