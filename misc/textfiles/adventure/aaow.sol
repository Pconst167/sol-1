         The hardest part of THE ANCIENT ART OF WAR is overtaking
    an enemy fort.  Whoever is in the fort has a distinct advantage
    over the attacker.  But with this small tip, you can take over
    enemy forts easily. 
         I figured this out when I attacked an enemy fort on all
    sides.  I attacked with three armies, and there were only two
    in the fort.  The two of my armies took their stance against
    the enemy, waiting for my command.  The third just waltzed into
    the fort, unchallenged. 
         This must have been overlooked by the programmers of the
    game.  The strategy is simple.  First, put the FIGHT DELAY
    option on long.  (This means you army will wait along time to
    fight with your command before it decides to fight on its own.)
    Then target the fort you want to attack.  Detach armies of
    three archers in good condition for every army in the enemy
    fort.  (If there are too few or they are too weak, they will be
    captured.) Then construct an army or two, depending on the
    enemies strength, that consists of the right kind of soldier to
    fight that group. (Barbarians to fight archers, etc.) Make
    sure that their in the proper formation. 
         Then move all your armies to just outside the enemy fort.
    Attack it with all your three-archer armies first.  Make sure
    all the enemy armies are occupied, and then move your main
    armies in.  Once they are in place, ZOOM in on your
    three-archer armies, and then ZOOM in on your main armies.
    (Assuming the three archers didn't wipe them out.) The latter
    fight will be easy, because even if you attack an army with one
    lousy soldier, it will be weakened. 
         This trick has never failed me.  With it I have beaten the
    Islands of Doom scenario against Sun-Tzu.  The only problem now
    is that the game is really boring. 
         By the way, if you win a tournament or something with this
    trick, I wouldn't get angry if you wanted to send me money or
    something at P.O.  Box 398, Derby, CT.  06418.  And if you
    distribute this, I would appreciate it if you distributed the
    address with it.  Just thought you might like to know :-}
