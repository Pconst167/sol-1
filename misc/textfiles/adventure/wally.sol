INLAY CARD TEXT
Wally is back, this time with his family in the first ever Multi
Role Arcade Adventure. Not only does Wally appear fully animated,
but also Wilma, Herbert, Tom, Dick and Harry. The purpose of the
game is to find the combination for the safe and then pay the
gangs wages.The combination is split and can be found in
different locations.  Not only must the combination be
identified, but also the right items to collect the combination
must be used. The locations are many and varied, and contain zany
arcade sequences which must be completed to finish the adventure.
Each character has specific abilities and it is up to the player
to select which one will perform a particular task. The game
starts with the whole gang in the Town Square by the Fountain.
You have control of Wally, so the rest of the gang go off about
their own business. As Wally cannot do everything himself, you
will have to select one of the other characters, (except for
Herbert, he is totally uncontrollable) to perform the various
tasks.  This is achieved by pressing the Character Select key
while they are on the current screen. While a character is not
under your control, he or she may be carrying out other tasks,
which may help or hinder you.  If you reach the edge of the
screen while walking about town, you will continue to the next
location. However, some of the screens have exits other than at
the extreme left or right, eg a door or a road. To leave at these
points you should press the exit key whilst in the appropriate
position.  There is another, faster way of getting across town,
but it is more risky than walking. To complete the game, all of
the pieces of the safe's combination must be taken to the sfae
in the correct order. To pick an object up, simply walk in front
of it. It will then be exchanged for one already carried. The
two objects carried are displayed at the top of the screen. All
this rushing around is hard work, so the characters must eat and
drink to keep themselves going. Wally isnt too fussy about what
he eats, but the rest of the gang may be more choosy.  Each
character has a part to play.  Wally is a builder and odd job man
by trade, so you should use him for mixing cement, etc. Wilma is
Wallys wife, and so might do the shopping. Herbert, Wally and
Wilmas pride and joy, doenst do anything except get in the way.
Tom, the punk, is a mechanic, Dick is the plumber and Harry is
the electrician.  You will find it necessary to complete the
varied arcade sequences to obtain certain objects. In some arcade
sequences, the controls will alter to suit the game. All controls
are redifinable.

GENERAL FACTS
The lyrics to 'Everyone's a Wally ?' are:-
[Some spelling may be slightly wrong, but *this is intentional*.
There may also be the odd mistake - I'm relying on memory from
several years ago here!]

Now Wally was a builder, and he had to build a house,
He knew the basics of the trade but hadn't got the nouse
to build the walls, dig the drains, or put in lights and doors,
To plumb the bath, slate the roof, or lay down any floors.
Now Wally was a grafter, and he didn't like to shirk -
That's why he called his mates in to help him do the work.

<chorus - can't remember it exactly>

First he called in Dick the prick, who turned up with his hod.
He thought he knew all the tricks, the good for nothing so-and-so
Like superglue between the bricks instead of using mortar.
"'Ere," said Wally, "don't you think you oughta
Use proper stuff to do the job?" But Dick got all his mates;
They travelled on the Tube and stuck a shovel in his face.
[fx: <clang> Ow!]

<chorus>

Now Tom was a plumber's mate, the spiky little punk.
You've never seen a geezer dressed in so much blinkin' junk.
He started in the bathroom, and after half an hour,
The basin was off the wall, and he'd pulverised the shower.
"Of course it's working well!"[1] he said, swinging on the chain
-
The cistern came off the wall, and flushed him down the drain!
[fx: <flush> Aaaaaaaaaaaaagggh! <typical toilet glug effect>]

<double chorus>

Now Harry was a hippy (Harry Christmas to his mates);
Turned up to do the wiring, what a two-and-eight! [2]
He opened up the fuse box, it didn't half go dark,
So he fiddled with the terminal, and it all began to spark.
"Cosmic, mahn!"[1] he said, his fingers in the socket,
He threw the switch, began to twitch, and took off like a rocket!
[hint of rocket launch effect]

<chorus to fade>

The chorus consists of pairs of lines like:
Everyone's a wally, a nellie or a nana or a nerd,
Everyone's a wally, everyone's a wally, that's the word


[1] Think of "The Young Ones" to get the accent right!
[2] I think this is 'state'
