<DESCRIPTION>

As  a  player you will travel back in  time to stop six wicked sorcerers from
creating a magic book of evil.


<TIPS>

While  playing Wizards Squares, I find that  the ball usually lands on Red or
Blue.

If you have low hit points, watch out for Slasher Boars. Also, steer clear of
swamps  and mountains, as they contain the toughest of monsters (Hurlers, Ice
Urchins,  Spikers,etc.). Grub Snufflers are the  best monster to meet because
they have a much greater pro- fit ratio. (hit points against gold carried)

The  game  is finished in the realm  of sorcerers, in the Dungeon of Despair.
You  must  have  about  10,000 hit points  and  many  spells to finish it. An
absolute  neccessity  is  the "Scroll of Scalna",  which  can be found in the
other dungeon in the realm. The Scroll is a magical map, and it automatically
maps your path.

Watch  out  in  the  dungeons, and constantly  check  ahead  of  you with the
"Xamine"  command  at  the bottom of the  list  of commands, as bear traps or
spikes whip up and destroy your amour, or do up to 4000 hit points damage.

Some  weapons are better than others for  killing certain monsters. Here is a
list indicating what weapon is best against some of the different monsters.

Tanglers -------- Dagger
Wave Slappers --- Rapier
Spincers -------- Rapier
Mutant Carps ---- Cudgel
Slasher Boars --- Spear
Ramdarts -------- Bow and Arrow
Giant Cockroach - Fauchard
Spiker ---------- Staff

Make sure that you have plenty of food before descending into any dungeons or
tombs, as you may get lost and run out of food. This will cause you to starve
to death

Some  magic items can help you in your quest  - If you Use the wand of power,
you  gain  200 hit points, and if you  Use the moonstone amulet, you gain 100
food.


<SOLVE>

Here  are  the  moves you will have  to  do to complete this quest......don't
panic  if  you can't follow them closely,  as searching for some food will be
unfortunately a hard task!

First  of  all,  go to Bay View to buy  rope  and  hooks - to allow you to go
through mountains - as well as a hammer.

To gain one level, you will just have to go to Redstone Castle, open the door
to  the  Hall of visions with the gold  key (already in your inventory at the
start of the game). There, speak.......Mesron may help you......you will have
to do it after each 'big action'.

You  will then have to gather lots of money, as living in Questron 2 is based
upon  money. When you are rich enough  to cure yourself from bad injuries, go
to  Redstone  Castle and open every chest  in sight. This means that you will
have to kill nearly all Guards, and thus you will be at great risk.

The  emerald key is located in the Northwest  corner of the Castle, in a room
guarded  by  only one soldier, and where  two chests stand. The copper key is
located in the Southwest corner of the Castle, near the Guard dressed in red.
You will have enough money to buy some Hit-Points.

Your next goal is Rivercrest Cathedral and within, the Rivercrest tombs.

Here,  not  very far from the entrance - it  is the first door in the hall to
the  East - lies the Moonstone Amulet.  Bring it immediately to the Holy One,
in  the Cathedral. He can help you. There  is also an Emerald Door - far from
the entrance to the Southeast, which can be opened with the emerald key found
in the Castle. Not far from it lies the Wand of Power.

Go  back  to Redstone Castle and the Hall  of  Visions to gain one level. The
best  thing  to  do now is to go  to  Octapoint to buy some weapons, clothes,
spells and travel facilities.

Now  go  back to the Rivercrest tombs.  Follow  the corridor to the Northeast
until  you  find  the Blind Robed Priest. Give  him  the fare he wants and go
through the passage he grants you. Go to the door to the East, cross the room
to the South door, go through it and speak with the character standing there.
He  is Morle the Magician. He will give  you a mission (find and give him the
Orb), and a brass key.

Go  back  to  Redstone Castle, open the  doors  that you haven't been able to
unlock  with  the  other  keys, and go to  the  Hall  of  Maps. When you have
memorised  the maps, go to collect the  Ord (just under you!), the door opens
with the copper key.

Return  to  Morle  inside  Rivercrest tombs and  get  his  Orb  back. He will
teleport you to the Realm of the Sorceror'.

You  should be near Demph. Enter it and buy as many spells, Hit points and as
much  food as possible. Buy also (if you  can afford it) a camel or some kind
of  terrestrian animal to carry you. You will have to find a boat to get back
to  Landor.  Go  to Burnside. Here you  should  find some for about 2000 gold
pieces.  Go  to the North of Burnside. You  should see the boat on the coast.
Sail Norrth until you reach Landor (not far from Redstone Castle).

Go  to  the  Hall  of Visions and  improve  your  abilities (you should be an
Apprentice  now). Maybe you will have a key replacing all other keys. You can
go and consult the Sage that will improve your abilitieas too.

Sail  back  to the Realm of the  Sorceror's. Enter the dungeon located on the
Eastof  the  island. The equipment you  need  is randomly distributed on each
level.  Open  every chest until you have  them all. Don't forget to watch out
for traps.......type X to avoid them.

The  Scroll of Scalna lies somewhere on  Level 3, the Crystal Goblet on level
4,  the  Agate  Key  on Level 6 and the  Onyx  Key  on Level 8. Now go to the
surface.

Go to Twilight Cathedral and give the crystal goblet to the Holy One. He will
be very impressed!!

Go  to the Great Fortress. You will have  to execute all Guards and open each
chest to find some useful tools. Be sure you are strong enough to try it. You
should find the Sapphire Key to the East of the Fortress, and the Ruby Key in
the  guard's  quarters.  Open the door leading  to  Simon the Stooge with the
agate key. Give him some money so as to have your abilities increased.

Exit  the  Fortress  and  come back again  (only  then  will the King talk to
you......well  you DID slay all his guard  company!). Go to the two-door set.
Open  the  first with the agate key and  the  second with the ruby key. Go to
speak  to  the  King. Although he is angry  about  you, he asks you to be his
hero!  No  time to hesitate......he will give  you  the Opal key (to open all
doors  in  the Fortress). Go to the last  door left (behind the King) open it
with  the opal key, follow the path to the Eternal Flame. Get it and exit the
Fortress.

Go  to Twilight Fortress, visit the Holy One (maybe some Bread of Life?), and
enter the tombs thanks to the Onyx Key. Find your way to the Black Key. It is
in  a room to the far West of  the labyrinth. The Eternal Flame will help you
to  cross the dark passage. There is nothing else interesting in the tombs so
don't waste time there.

Go back to Landor and Redstone Castle. Go to the Hall of Visions. Mesron will
tell  you that Seacrest is about to be attacked. Go there as fast as you can!
(you  just have to go FOUR MOVES to  the right from the Castle, then go North
until you enter the village.......don't waste any moves, avoid all encounters
as time is of the essence.......once in Seacrest, you should face Mantor, and
his killer guards - if not it's too late). Get near to Mantor and throw him a
fireball (from the Book of Magic). He will vanish and the guards will be free
from the spell thrown on them. You have saved Seacrest!!

Go  back to the Hall of Visions. Speak  twice to earn some experience, and be
considered  as  a Knight of Landor. Mesron  will tell you that Morle has been
captured by Mantor.

Your  Hit Points are now only limited by  the number of Gold Pieces you have.
Try  to buy as many as you can, more  than 10,000 if you want to survive (the
end of the game costs a lot of hit points!!).

Go  back  to  the  Realm  of Sorceror's,  enter  Demph  and  buy  some spells
(Fireballs!).

Now  you can enter the Dungeon of Despair: you are a Knight of Landor and own
the Black Key. Reach Level 8 of the Dungeon by any available means.....beware
the last trap leads to Mantor's Lair.....he has thrown a spell that costs you
about 40 hit points each move you make (Mantor's Mind Zap).

Go  East  then North until you reach Morle  who  cries for you to hurry. Find
Mantor  (just  wander  about  for  a few  seconds  to  find  him), follow the
corridors. Kill all annoying guards.

Once  you  have  entered the main room  where  Mantor  and his private guards
stand,  try to reach the Book of Evil  (in the centre) and throw the Destruct
Spell (from the Book of Magic) until Mantor disappears.

Morle  teleports you with his last  psychic strength to Redstone Castle where
you are welcomed as THE HERO!!!

Well done, Count Of Questron, Baron of Landor!!
