Author's notes:

    This is THE complete, solved, and written docs for Bard's Tale III: The
Theif of Fate. We started playing Bard's Tale III on 6-15-88. We finished on
6-23-88. We started writing this on 6-28-88. We finished writing this on
6-29-88. We released this on 6-30-88. The 15 days between when we started
playing, and when we finished writing this, was the worst experience ever
conceived to mankind. When and if Bard's Tale IV comes out, someone else
better write a solve file, because we sure the hell aren't!!

    We would like to clarify for Vigilante, who gave us the
inspiration to write a real solve file, that Shahka Brae doesn't exist. We
would also like to tell him that the dude with the long name is actually
'Brilhasti ap Tarj.' Also, the Stone Touch spell doesn't exist in Bard's Tale
III.

    The general info file we used was taken from the docs typed in by ESI. The
trainer was taken from BBI. The fix used for the codewheel was taken from XPB.
This solve was done by Kool Kat, Wildcat, and Marduk. All in the 404 area code.

If you ever are on you knees, begging to know the locations of the statues in
Malefia, give 5150 a call and leave e-mail to one of us.

Whaddya think about Tyson killing Spinx in 91 seconds?? Too bad Tarjan
wasn't so easy to kill. Well, at least we got the 22 million pieces of gold
finding him! Heh heh heh heh... have a nice day!

                   ===> BARD'S TALE III: Thief of Fate <===


[< PREFACE >]  As I lay dying...

I pray my body does not fail me before I am able to complete this most
important missive.  I pray as well that, somehow, the heroes who once  before
saved Skara Brae will find this accounting and act upon it. I leave this
record so those who come after will know what horrors that the Mad God Tarjan
has perpetrated, and so that they will not be lulled into believing that
Skara Brae was his sole target.

How can I describe that day.  May, it did not begin like all others  for on
that day we celebrated the victory over Mangar that had so recently liberated
our city.  Bards from the world arrived in Skara Brae to play and herald the
brave deeds of those heroes who saved us.  The townspeople danced in the
streets with happiness, and the great festival filled all with an
overwhelming joy of life and renewed hope for the future.

Then Mangar's Master, the The Mad God Tarjan, arrived to reduce our day of
celebration into a day of mourning.  His shadow sank the city into pitiless
black oblivion.  Foul creatures that had festered in his flesh like maggots
burst forth to assault fair Skara Brae.  People ran, but could not run swiftly
enough to escape.  Tarjan's minions left none untouched.

Forgive the shakiness of my script, for life ebbs painfully from my body as I
write.  Tarjan, mocking my death curse, told me Skara Brae was barely one in a
series of conquests he had long contemplated to complete his revenge.  He
laughed when I said heroes would come to destroy his mad plan, yet I sensed
fear in his voice when I promised that the legendary Hawkslayer, and those
who defeated Margar, would return again to triumph. As payment for my
threat, he gave a swift twist of his jewelled sword into my belly.

Tarjan must be stopped.  Whosoever reads this, you must get word to the
heroes.  This will be their greatest challenge, for upon their efforts rests
the fate of more than Skara Brae, more than the Six Cities of the plains.
Their failure will mean the extinction of all life - save for the wretched
Tarjan and his servile parasites.  Pray for success...and life renewed.


[< OBJECTIVES >]

You must assemble a group of adventurers who will travel to the seven
dimensions in search of the source of Skara Brae's destruction.  Along the
way, you'll gather words, spells, and items that will help you in your final
battle against the repugnant Evil One.  If you successfully destroy the Evil
One, Skara Brae will be released from the bond of ruin.

Using logic is he key to surviving in each of the dimensions.  Let's say
you're trekking around in some icy, arctic-like zone and a monstrous snow
wolf steps onto your path, bares its teeth, and then proceeds to chew off
your ankle.  You have a bag of spells to chose from, but one type of spell
would be 'especially' effective. (Hint: Trying to freeze the snow wolf in an
ice storm is not the best choice.)

Throughout the game, you'll need to make important decisions about how to
accomplish certain tasks.  You won't want to proceed in the usual 'Whatever
Works' method.  It will pay to think it out.


[< PRE-BUILT PARTIES >]

When you enter the Refugee Camp, you'll find a group of adventurers called
INTERPLAYERS ready to do your bidding.  They're not the most seasoned of
adventurers, but they're good enough for you to sample Thief of rate with.
Use these characters to find out how commands work, what different races and
classes do, how it feels to get repeatedly attacked, in general, what the
Realm is like.  When you're ready, you can create your own characters.


[< CREATING CHARACTERS >]

I'm sure most of you know how to do this, so there's no need in the key
pressing situation ... so listen up:

RACES
-----
HUMANS: Their strength and inventiveness make them one of the best survivors.
Never lacking agression , they can handle themselves in justabout any adverse
setting.

ELF: Fair of hair and skin, the Elves are slightly taller,faster, and more
agile than humans.  Although weaker, they make up for this by being more
skilled in magical arts and war strategies.

DWARF: Stout and short, these people are amazingly strong and healthy.
Brightness, however, isn't a shining attribute of theirs.

HOBBIT: The Hobbit is deft and clever, which are ideal traits for thieving.
Their favorite boast is 'A locked door is soon no more.'

HALF-ELF: The result of an Elf and Human 'friendship', Half- Elves acquire
their fair and light skin from Elves, and their physical bulk from Humans.

HALF-ORC: Orcs are the henchman of evil wizards who are capable of little
more than following orders for physical dirty work.  Half-Orcs are tempered
with Human blood, so while they're still dangerous, they aren't completely
mindless drones forever in search of necks to wrench.

GNOME: Gnomes are much like Dwarfs, but a little more anti-social due to a
deficit in beauty.  Because they've spent so much time studying alone, Gnomes
have developed a certain flair for magic.


CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES
--------- ----------

As you create your characters, these attributes appear above the race
categories at the top of the screen.  They're your character's vital
statistics.  These values will determine how successful your character
performs in his or her class (or 'profession').

STRENGTH (ST): Nobody really wishes to be light on might, but strength is
especially important to fighters.

INTELLIGENCE (IQ): If you won't have brawn, then you better have the brains.
Magicians get bonus spell points for high intelligence scores.

DEXTERITY (DX): This helps determine how fleet of feed and
nimble of hand you'll be.  A high score makes you harder to hit, and helps
you land the first blow.  For Rogues, the higher this value, the less
likely they'll get their fingers snapped off in traps.

CONSTITUTION (CN): This represents your overall health.  The higher this is,
the more damage your opponent must inflict on you before you need to start
thinking about death.  Should you be blessed with strong constitution, you
will get bonus hit points.

LUCK (LK): Luck is ambiguous and unpredictable; you never know what alliance
it has made with fate.  One thing is known about luck: lucky souls are more
likely to resist evil magic and avoid traps.


CLASSES
-------

No one class, or profession, is nobler than the next.  As the mix of strings
on the Bard's mandolin makes for a richer sound, so will a mix of calls
make for a richer journey.  Create a party with no Rogues or Bards, and
you'll have nobody to steal flowers for your grave and sing at your funeral.
While there are 13 classes to put your choosing, only eight are available to
the first-time adventurer.

WARRIOR: It's a rare weapon that this king of fighters can't handle.  Warriors
gain an extra attack capability for every four levels of experience after the
first; a reward for becoming more adept in battle.

PALADIN: This fighter swears to battle all evil and uphold honor and purity.
Due to their virtuous nature, the Paladin can handle some enchanted weapons
that other can't and also have greater resistance to spells cast on them.

HUNTER: These are the skilled assassins.  Their combat approach is to aim for
the vital organs or nerve center and do away with the opponent with as little
swordplay as possible.

MONK: These are no ordinary, somber, brown-robed, porridge eaters.  Monks are
actually adept fighters skilled in the ways of martial arts. While Monks with
more experience prefer to fight with their bare hands, they can also use
traditional weapons.  A Monk's armor class improves as he or she gains levels.

BARD: Any Bard will tell you that music can do more than
sooth the savage beast.  The Bard can do a number of things from creating
light to regenerating spell points with a mere stroke of strings.

ROGUE: This dexterous thief makes a living out of picking locks and
neutralizing traps.  If you plan on traveling  without a Rogue, prepare to
pay a high physical price for your spoils.  A Rogue also has the ability to
identify mysterious items.  And perhaps most important, a Rogue can be an
excellent killer due to his or her ability to sneak up close to an opponent
before he or she attacks...and you'll soon find out just how important this
thief is to your fate.

CONJURER: Conjurers have the ability to heal wounds and
create physical phenomena like fire and light.

MAGICIAN: A Magician's specialty is to change the properties
of physical objects, such as enchanting a sword, turning an enemy to
stone, or making a dungeon wall vanish.

SORCERER: These mages have weighty illusions, ones that a newly-made
character surely couldn't handle.  You must know at least three spell levels
from the Magician and Conjurer classes.

WIZARD: Rumor of the Real is that these mages have the power to summon and
bind creatures of the supernatural, creatures who react foully to being
dragged out of their worlds on someone else's whim.

ARCHMAGE: Archmages must have mastered all the spells of any three magic
classes.  With this hefty experience requirement, Archmages are undoubtedly
the most auspicious among those who cast spells for a living.

GEOMANCER: Fighters who want to convert to a life of a magic can become
Geomancers.  Once they choose to change, they can still use the armor,
weapons, and magic items that the  fighter can use.  Beware: Bards lose their
songs, Warriors lose their multiple attacks, Hunters lose their critical hit
ability, and Monks lose their armor class bonus and multiple attacks.  It's
part of the trade off.

CHRONOMANCER: Chronomancers are the travel experts of the magic users.
Before becoming one, a magic user must master all the spells of any three
mage classes.  An once you become a Chronomaster, you lose the power to use
all the spells you previously learned.  It may sound unfair, but the
Chronomancer needs to focus all of his or her attention on the important
dimensions teleport spells.  Don't think you can get around without this
spellcaster, because you can't.


SPECIAL CHARACTER TIPS FROM THE REFUGEE CAMP
------- --------- ---- ---- --- ------- ----

* Don't worry about losing a level 1 character; just make another one if he
or she dies.  However, when your characters reach level 3, regularly back up
your character disk with your favorite disk copy utility or prepare to shed
tears over a lost character.

* If your favorite character is killed, you can resurrect him or her with
magic, or with gold if you can find a shrine that raises the dead.  You can
also turn off the computer, reboot, and reload your party from the point
where you last saved them to disk (which means all of the characters lose any
gold or experience points they may have earned since the last time you saved
them.)  Or, you can delete the dead character from your main character disk,
and replace that character from your backup disk.

* When you roll for attributes, shoot for 16's, 17's, and 18's since
they can make a big difference. For example, high dexterity gives you
bonus armor protection and first strike capabilities; luck often lets
your survive if you accidentally spring a trap; constitution provides
all characters with extra hit points; and high intelligence gives
mages bonus spell points in later turns.

* Certain races rely on certain attributes being strong. A mage who is
strong but not intelligent is at a far greater disadvantage at an
opposite attribute... being weak but with high intelligence.

* Develop a Sorcerer quickly to use in the dungeons. Wizards, too, are
important because they can summon extremely powerful special members.  Work
toward Archmagedom.  You'll also need to prepare at least one character for
the role of Chronomancer.

* Experiment with Hunters.  They can often kill superior monsters quickly
because of their critical hit capabilities.  Rogues also have excellent
critical hit abilities, but only when they hide in the shadows.  And don't
dismiss the Monk as lightweights best left chanting in the monastery; after
the sixth level, they're probably the best fighters of all the classes.

* You can always enlist the services of special members and save them to your
party.

* Beware of certain magic squares.  Keep an eye on your
character's statistics while exploring.  If you see that your
character's spell or hit points are dropping for no apparent reason, your character
is probably on a magic square that drains power - jump off the square before
he or she is sapped of all strength.


[< SPECIAL CHARACTERS >]

You may meet special characters during your travels, or summon them with a
spell or magic article (the summoned characters are also known as illusionary
characters).  You can invite as many of these special characters to join your
party-granted you have the space in your party. You can save special
characters to disk once you return to the Refugee Camp.

Special characters choose their own method of attack and usually go
after the first group of monsters that you party if facing.
Illusionary characters disappear from the party ranks when they are
killed or when a foe disbelieves its existence. If a nonillusionary
special characters is attacked by another party member for any reason,
the special character immediately turns hostile and fights until
defeated. Dead special characters can be resurrected and healed just
like your regular characters.

Special characters can carry items for your party, but they can't find
them or use them. Only the characters you made are capable of this.
When special members are killed, anything they were carrying
disappears, so don't have them carry your favorite family heirloom.


[< MOVING UP IN LEVELS >]

All newly-made characters start out as level one. As you adventure,
fight, and gain experience, you can go up in levels. The higher your
level, the better you'll perform in the profession you choose: magic
users cast more spells, fighters fight more skillfully, thieves steal
more successfully, and so on. To advance, you must go to the Review
Board where the Old Man will review your accomplishments and let you
know if you are fit for advancement... [Art possibly?]

Spellcasters need to advance in levels to acquire more spells. What
spellcasters would wish to dedicate years of study only to dabble in
the same handful of tepid spells all of their lives? The following
tables shows at what level spellcasters can use certain level spells.
For instance, a Wizard with an experience level of 3 can only use
spells up to the second level. Spellcasters have seven spell levels
that they can acquire.

EXPERIENCE LEVEL/SPELL LEVEL

1/1         8/4
2/1         9/5
3/2         10/5
4/2         11/6
5/3         12/6
6/3         13+/7
7/4

You can advance to a new, more powerful mage class once you learn
enough spells from enough mage classes. Just how many spells and just
which mage classes you must learn depend on which mage class you want
to advance to. When you go to the Review Board, you'll find out
exactly which classes you can advance to at that time.

For those seeking to change classes, your experience points will reset
to zero, but your other attributes such as hit points, spell points,
and gold remain unaffected. A warning to magic users: once you advance
to a new mage spells, you don't get the chance to learn the magic
classes and spell levels that you skipped. For instance, if you become
an Archmage without having studied the Sorcerer spells, you cannot go
back to learn those Sorcerer spells.


[< PLACES >]

Despite the fact that much of the Realm was crushed, some
places still do
stand.  The Scrapwood Tavern, for one, still does good
business.


[< REFUGEE CAMP >]

Once, there was a home to travelers called the Adventurer's Guild.
Wayfarers stopped there when they wanted to slake a thirst, engage in
merriment, or just rest their weary feet. Now that the plague has
descended and Skara Brae has been shattered, the Refugee Camp serves
as the gathering points for travelers.

Although lacking the niceties of the Adventurer's Guild (tables,
heating, vermin free bedding), you can still do the same things in the
Refugee Camp. Come here to create characters, form a party, and save
characters to disk. This is where you will begin every game and where
you will be returned should all your party perish during the quest.


[< SCRAPWOOD TAVERN >]

Drink up! This is the only tavern in the vicinity. You may want to
fill up with a wineskin here so your Bard will not have to go thirsty
in some of the more inhospitable, tavernless areas. While you're here,
ask the barkeep how things are going...


[< PLACES NO MORE >]

In the previous scenarios of Bard's Tale, you may of found places like
Roscoe's Energy Emporium, temples, casinos, but... here, you may not
be so fortunate. So you may have to search out for alternatives, if
there are any.


[< REVIEW BOARD >]

Once, this housed the representatives from each of the ten different
classes from all over the Realm. They were responsible for advancing
adventurers with enough experience points to higher levels. During the
dark days, all fled or perished in the attempt. Now, the Old Man sits
on the Board, and he alone will answer to your call for advancement
[Art, again in aid.]


[< MORE TIPS FROM THE REFUGEE CAMP - PLACES >]

* Your first adventure should be in the Mad God's dungeon in Skara
Brae. Here you'll build your savvy for fighting, spellcasting, and
adventuring.

* Avoid potential traps. Use the Trap Zap spell when in doubt. It will
disarm any trap, including the Gas Cloud trap, famous for its toxic
fumes.



Actual solution starts here:




Skara Brae:

To complete the level of Skara Brae, one must venture into the Mad
God's Temple, and utter the words 'chaos.' Once inside of the dungeon,
teleport immediatly two levels down using the APAR spell. Once there,
find a portal that goes down. It will be much easier to find using the
SOSI spell. When you are within three or four paces of the portal, the
spell will tell you 'Something special is near.' Once you are in the
room with the portal, cast LEVI and hit 'W' to levitate down the
portal. Walk around until Brilhasti tells you that you are close. When
he does so, he should be right around the corner. Once you hear him
for the second time, go to the west and stay against the wall, turn
north and precede cautiously. After going north for aproximately ten
paces, hit '?' to see the dungeon map (you may want to do this during
other dungeons.) If you see on the map that you have passed through a
door, go east one and south one. You may want to save the game before
you go south. Once you go south, you will enter his chamber. As soon
as possible, cast the PREC spell. This spell will prevent Brilhasti
from conjuring up more foes for you to fight. Try to kill his guards
as soon as possible. After killing all foes except Brilhasti, advance
until at 10'. Once you kill him, you will be teleported back to the
Review Board where the old man will teach your Chronomancer (if you
have one) the spells to get to Arboria. Which is our next dimension to
solve.

Arboria:

To enter Arboria cast: ARBO
To return to Skara Brae cast: ENIK

Once in Arboria, seek the fisherman's hut. Go inside and pay him money
to learn the GILL spell. This spell will allow you to breathe under
water. After learning the spell (which can also be learned in the
Wizard's guild inside of Ciera Brannia) go in the lake right next to
the hut. As soon as you are under water, cast the GILL spell. It only
last for a short while, so move quickly. Head towards the west. After
going west for about 20 paces, you should be near the water of life.
To get some, make one of your characters use a wineskin or a canteen.
They will collect some of the water which will play an important role
in the future. Once out of the lake, look around for an oak tree. It
is close to the city gates. When you run into it, it will ask you if
you want to pick an acorn. Type yes and give it to one of your
characters. Now you must go to the top of Valarian's tower and get the
nightspear. Teleport straight up about two or three levels using the
APAR spell. Once you make it two the top, there is a place where you
must plant the acorn. To do so, make the character use the acorn.
He/she will plant it. Then use the Water of Life. The acorn will grow
into a full size tree. Climb the tree and look around on the top level
for the nightspear. Give it to one of your characters. To get out of
Valarian's tower, teleport straight down two or three levels, and find
the stairs going out of the tower. Go inside of the city, and go into
the King's castle. It should be right in front of the city gates. The
king will tell you to bring Tsolaths head to him. Then you will exit
the city and find the festering pit. It looks like a hole in the
ground. After you enter it, teleport down with the APAR spell and find
Tsolath. Cast a PREC spell as soon as you find him. The best way to
kill him is to use something quick and powerful, such as the DEST
spell. Once you kill him, he will try to come back to life, but the
nightspear will absorb the light that controls him, killing him for
ever. Then you will be able to get his head and heart. Take them and
go back to the King's castle. The King will take Tsolaths head and let
you into his Sacred Grove, which is right outside of his castle. Enter
the grove and head towards the south-central part of the dungeon. You
should find a door there. Enter the door and use Tsolaths heart. One
of your characters will put it in a bowl in his chest. Then use the
Water of Life, this will make the heart start pumping and bring
Valarian back to life. You then will have to exit and re-enter his
burial chamber to discover a door to the east. Enter the door and head
towards the south-east. There you will find Valarian's bow and arrows.
Give them to your characters and make you way back out of the grove to
the city gates. Find the well worn area where you will teleport back
to Skara Brae. Go to the old man in the Review Board. He should give
you 600000 experience points and tell you of your next quest. Be sure
to have your chronomancer talk to him to learn the new teleporting
spells.

Geledia:

To teleport to Geledia cast: GELI
To return to Skara Brae cast: ECUL

Geledia is a cold place, so as soon as you teleport there, you must go
indoors to avoid freezing to death. Once you are in the Ice Keep, go
up the stairs. Go to the top left corner. Their you will find a riddle
and a three- legged-one-eyed statue. You then must make your magic
users cast the following spells: INWO, WIHE, FOFO, INVI. Go through
the passageway and work your way up to the top. You will have to earn
the lens by defeating a few guardians. Once you have the lens, go back
down to the bottom of the tower, and go through the passageway again.
Go to the gold portal in the large room on the first floor of the Ice
Keep. Make your character use the lens you just found. Then go towards
the top right corner of the dungeon. Their you will find another
riddle. Cast the following spells: MAFL, SHSP, FEAR, SUEL, SPBI. Go
through the passageway and, again, work your way up to the top. You
will again have to earn the lens by defeating a few more gaurdians.
Once you get the second lense, work your way back to the passage way,
and go back to the large room with the gold portal. Use the second
lense just as you did the first.

Now you only have one more lense to go. Look around on the first floor
for the third riddle. Once you find it, cast the following spells:
LEVI, ANMA, PHDO. Enter the passage way, go up, defeat the guardians,
go down, leave the passageway, and go back to the gold portal. Once
you use the third lense, the portal will open allowing you to go
through it. In this dungeon, you will find the prizes you seek. Once
you go back to the review board in Skara Brae, the old man will give
you another 600000 experience points, and tell you of your next quest.

Kinestika:

To teleport to Kinestika cast: KINE
To teleport to Skara Brae cast: OBRA

In Kinestika, you must find a left and a right key. The left key will
be found in the Private Quarters. To get to the Private Quarters, go
all the way to the right wall and take the passageway. Then go to the
top right of the dungeon in a room by a spinner. Take the key and go
back the way you came. Once back in the main dungeon (Ferofist's) go
to the bottom right and enter the Barracks. Once in the Barracks go to
the bottom right corner into a backwards 'L' shaped room. Take the key
and again go back the way you came. Once in the main dungeon go north
of the dungeon and enter the Workshop through another passageway. Go
to the left and you should find the sealed portal. You shouldn't have
to go through any doors to find it. Once you find the sealed portal.
Use one of the keys and turn it 15 times. Use the other key and turn
it 18 times. The portal should open. If not, use the opposite key and
turn it 15 or 18 times respectively.

Once in the dungeon below, work your way to the top center and go
south through a door. You will find a guy who asks you if you want to
end this peacefully or violently. Answer yes to the question. He then
will allow you to enter his chamber. Go south for about 4 paces. You
should find him waiting for you. There you will be able to convert one
of your characters (monk, paladin, bard, or rogue) into a Geomancer.
After doing so, look around the chamber for his chest. The prizes you
seek will be in them.

Lucenia:

To teleport to Lucenia cast: LUCE
To teleport to Skara Brae cast: ILEG

Once you are in Lucenia, walk around the wilderness and collect the
four differnt roses. You should find a White, Blue, Red, and Yellow
rose. The go to the mountain (4N,8W) and climb it. Once at the top of
the mountain, you must slay a dragon. You will find a crystal key
under its corpse. You will also need to collect some of its blood by
using a wineskin or canteen. Leave the mountain and go to Cyanis's
tower. Climb the tower and you should find Cyanis at the very top,
center. When you find him cast REST. He will then cheerfully give you
a magic triangle. After you have the triangle, go down back to the
wilderness. Find Alliria's tomb (1N,8W) and go around to the back of
it. You should find a dead rose bush. Use the dragon's blood you
gathered earlier, and the bush should grow a rainbow rose. Pick it and
enter Alliria's tomb. Once in her tomb, venture around until you find
a dungeon with a bunch of zig- zags. A beautiful looking shadowy
figure should ask you for the 'Flower of Truth.' Give her the White
rose. Later, she will ask you for the 'Flower of Valor.' Give her the
Blue rose. After going through a teleport on the same level she will
ask for the 'Flower of Kinship.' Give her the Red rose. She will later
ask for the 'Flower of Nature.' Give her the Yellow rose. Then, right
before you enter Alliria's chamber, she will ask for the 'Flower of
Alliria.' Give her the Rainbow rose. You then will be allowed to enter
Alliria's chamber. Take your prizes and exit the dungeon. Go back to
the Review Board and receive 600000 more experience points and the
spells for your next quest.

Malefia:

To teleport to Malefia cast: EVIL
To teleport to Skare Brae cast: LIVE

Malefia was absolutely the hardest and most time consuming dungeons of
all Bard's Tale dungeons. We refer to it as the S.O.B. dimension. I
will simply explain the goals, and let you experience the hell we went
through solving this dungeon by ourselves. It's helpful to cast SCSI
to find out how lost you really are. On the main level, you will have
to find a statue. Once you do so use the corresponding item. On the
first level down, there are two more statues. On the second level
down, there are three more statues. Once you complete all of the
statue business, go to the bottom right corner of the first level down
and levitate down the portal in a big room. Go north to find THE door.
If it's a 'faint door' then you haven't found all of the statues (six
of them.) We advise saving the game numerous times while venturing
beyond THE door. You must kill the first group of foes to enter the
sacred chamber. Once in the chamber, you must fight more foes to cross
a bridge. Running from the second group of foes can do more damage
than good. Once you past the second group, you must go after Tarjan
himself. Tarjan isn't exactly in a cheerfull mood when you find him.
He will conjurer up some 'friends' that you must play with (the
trainer would be nice right now, wouldn't it??) After playing with the
first group of friends, guess what? Yep, another group of friends.
These friends aren't really friends. These friends don't like you very
much. If you are lucky enough to kill the second group, Tarjan is all
yours. Since he likes to conjur up 10 black slayers every round,
casting PREC might not be a bad idea. Once you have killed the Mad
One, you will enter adventurer heaven and will be put to sleep until
part IV comes out. You may now turn it off and go back to Skara Brae,
where you will welcome a group of Hedge Lizards. Beat the %$#% out of
them and then you may want to do one of the following:

1. If you have to cut the grass tommorow, use some of the gasoline
(all if necessacary) and play Pyro-Bardia.

2. If you don't have to cut the grass, you have a couple of nice
frisbees to throw at your dog.

3. If you just happen to have some hydrochlroic acid laying around, we
hear disks react violently to it.

4. Have you ever studied the anatomy of a diskette?

5. If you have a trash can in the corner, here comes your chance for 2
points.

6. Call your lawyer, and sue the hell out of EA for making the false
claim that a thief is needed to solve the game.

7. Take a trip down to Panama and celebrate!

8. Experiment with a diskette's bouyancy. (Preferrably the Pacific)

9. The next time you see Kool Kat, Wildcat, or Marduk, give him a
million dollars for spending all of this time writing this file for
you after we already had it solved!

10. Break into your local hospital, and steal a bottle of Ether to use
until Bard's Tale IV comes out.

EXTRA * EXTRA * EXTRA * EXTRA * EXTRA * EXTRA * EXTRA * EXTRA * EXTRA

Allira: Main level, use Allira's belt.
Valarian: One level down, use Valarian's bow, 16N,8E
Lanatir: One level down, use Sphere of Lanatir.
Ferofist: Two levels down, use Ferofist's Helm
Scedeau: Two levels down, use Scedeau's Cloak
Werra: Two levels down, use Werra's Sheild.

You must go up and down many portals to find the above
statues!

We had lots of fun finding them, so can you!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Tarmitia:

To teleport to Tarmitia cast: AECE
To teleport to Skara Brae cast: KULO

Tarmitia was meant to be harder than it actually is. All you have to
do is answer a riddle and kill some one. Walk around in Berlin until
you find a floating head. The head will ask 'Who am I?' Respond with:
Tyr. Then the head will ask 'Who am I really?' Respond with :Werra.
You will then be teleport to a new dungeon. There, go the the bottom
left corner. Enter Werra's chamber and kill him. It is a good idea to
cast PREC and DIVA. This part looks easier than it really is. After
you kill Werra, he sits up and laughs at you, while six black slayers
try to destroy you. 2 NUKE spells should take care of them, but watch
out, because the Black Slayers critical hit everything they touch!
Once you kill the Black Slayers, you will receive your prizes and will
be able to go back to Skara Brae. To do so, go to the top right corner
and walk through the teleport.

Tenabrosia:

To teleport to Tenabrosia cast: OLUK
To teleport to Skara Brae cast: ECEA

In Tenabrosia you will want to go inside of the city gates to Black
Scar. Here you will find a Bard's Hall that will teach your Bard some
new songs. You will also find a Wizard's Guild that will teach you the
ever- powerfull Goderdammerung spell (NUKE). Once you learn those, you
may exit the city and set out to fulfill your quest. Find the Canyon
in nowhere, and the shadow lock will be in it somewhere. After you
find it, leave the canyon and find the Tar Pit. It looks like a hole
in the ground. It would be very wise to save your game before entering
this death pit. Once you are in the pit go south down the wall you
enter by. Then turn west and proceed about 10 paces. You want to be at
the very center of the southern wall. Once you are at the center,
slowly and cautiously go north. You will be walking over tar, so you
will get stuck many times, and you might lose a few characters. Don't
worry, just cast REST if your hit points are getting too low. You
should find a place where tar is bubbling up in the middle. Use a
wineskin or canteen to collect some of it. Go back the way you came.
Once you exit the dungeon, go to the dense forest (6S,7W) and find a
group of trees that are blocking the entrance to another dungeon. It
looks like a hole between a few trees. Once you are facing the trees,
use the tar that you just gathered. The tree will go up in flames,
allowing you to enter the dungeon within. Once in the dungeon, you
must find the shadow door.

When you have the shadow door and lock, go to the 'middle of nowhere.'
Use the shadow door and lock. A magic door will appear which you will
be able to go through. Once inside, wander around until you find
Scedeau. He will be guarding the prizes you seek. Since he will keep
moving you further and further away, the olny way to kill him is to
have your rogue hide in the shadows. It may take a while to get
him/her out to 90', but when you do so, it is a good idea to cast DIVA
to increase the damage inflicted upon Scedeau. If you don't kill him
the first time, just go back out again until you do. Another good idea
is to cast PREC, because while you are hiding in the shadows, Scedeau
just might want to conjur up some friends to mess you up.

Actual solution ends here !

1: Among the ruins of Skara Brae is an unnatural silence.
   As if death itself had come to stay.
2: There is a statue of the Mad God Tarjan here. It's

care of it.
3: The feeling of evil is foreboding.

1: The flat, grassy plain stretches peacefully out in all
directions.
   This is the Vale of Lost Warriors.
2: Here, halfway up Earthdagger Mountain, winds swirl around
and make this
   place earn its name: Cold Peak.
3: Stabbing up the sky like an obsidian dagger, Shadow Rock
is utterly alien
   to the surrounding landscape.
4: Foul, noxious gases reaking of rotten eggs bubble up
through the turgid,
   yellow, mud-laden waters.
5: Amid the bountiful trees you find a spring that almost
glows with purity.
6: Deeply hidden in verdant shadows, this grove is quiet and
feels very
   peaceful.
7: The Ruins of Skara Brae.
8: Old dwarf mines.

Bard Songs:

The bard has seven tunes he/she can play one at a time while
exploring or
during combat. The last two songs must be found.

1. Sir Robin's Tune: Lets party run from foes easier, and
prevents foes from
  calling for help.

2. Safety Song: Bonus to saving roll. This means that the
party is less likely
  to be damaged by magic and traps.

3. Sanctuary Score: Lowers the armor class for all members.

4. Bringaround Ballad: Increases the party's hit points for
extra protection
  also increase the damage points inflicted on the enemy.

5. Rhyme of Duotime: Makes party regain spell points twice
as fast, and makes
  fighters hit one extra time.

6. Watchwood Meledoy: Casts a mage flame.

7. Minstel Shield: Cast magic compas during non combat.
Burns all foes for
  150 to 600 points of damage during combat.

8. Kiel's Overture: Lowers armor class during non combat.
Aborbs half of damage
  inflicted upon the party during combat.

Torch: Lights your way in dungeons. Not nearly as precious
as spell points.

light weapons.
Scale Armor: Stronger than chain mail, hard to peirce.
Plate Armor: Strongest nonmagical armor.
Robes: Nice around the house, but no protection in a
dungeon.
Helm: Head protection from all but the fericest attack.
