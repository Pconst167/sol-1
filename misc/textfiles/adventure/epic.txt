                          Cockpit Display Systems
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         The cockpit utilises the latest in bio-elctronic circuits, and
    superconductive transfer systems to provide a mass of data to the star
    pilot.  Information is provided on a holographic display system
    directly in front of the pilot's line of sight for target
    acquisitionand fire control systems [an HUD] and on three display units
    in the front of the cockpit, with an auxilliary defence unit on the
    side view of the cockpit.2.)

                          The System Display Unit
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         This console is situated on the left hand side of the front
    cockpit view.  This display provides vital system data for the pilot.
    The top displaybar shows the ship'sa forward velocity.  The second
    display bar is a fuel indicator an d the final display bar shows the
    current score of theoperational starpilot.3.)

                       X-Particle Wave Combat Scanner
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         This display is located on the right hand side of the front-facing
    cockpitand provides the pilot with accu rate scans of the vicinity
    around thespaceship and will located and position on these scanners any
    enemytargets.  PRIMARY TARGETS would appear as a large white dot on
    this display,all friendly forces would be identifiable as a small blue
    trace. Somecr aft [usualy civilian] have an x-trace friend or foe
    device.4.)
                        Shields & Deflector System
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         All round non-regenerative shield with a 5.16 second lead time.
    Has fullatomic generated shields fed by the epical metal bodyshell,
    with nuclear fusion points aft, left and centre-line, which is able to
    withstand direct hits of over 2 megatons on full strength shields.  The
    Epical is able to withstand 6,000,000 pounds per cm squared so all
    current laser beams are deflected.Th e epic class is a one man
    starfighter only 24 metres in length and has transwarp capability, the
    smallest previous craft was 90 metres in length.The epic class has the
    fastest acceleration of any starfighter with zeroto one million
    kilometres in 4.68 7 seconds from a static start.  It has a transwarp
    factor of 0.34 which is thirty four times the speed of lightduring
    critical mass.  The EPiC class fighter has full atmospheric
    capabilities, with its primary role a ground attack starfighter.

                              ARNAMENT SYSTEMS
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         The EPiC class has an awesome variety of weapons available.  It is
    fitted with auto-recharge laser rifles on both wing tips, provision
    also for ioncannons, photon guns and cobalt weaponry.  The craft has a
    tractor beam system which allows collection of fuel scoops.

                                WEAK POINTS
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~
         Due to the lack of some materials during the design stage the epic
    craft has some minor disadvantages and faults:
        -The craft consumes a large amount of fuel and engines are very
         noisy.
        -It requires a regular ion stream clean as the photonic cells on
         the fuselage are damaged due to the massive electronic fluxes
         across the fuselage.
       - The cabin is heat-shielded but the titanium engine sections cannot
         stand the heat sheer passed through the Epical shell.  So engine
         failure is probable is force-field absorption disks fail.

                        Section 1 Non-strike Systems
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                               Tractor Beams
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         A superconducting NIOBIUM TITANIUM device.  This has a strength of
    2900 kilogauss [290 Testas - magnetic field strength] and pick up any
    objectwithin 50km. The objec t can be 32 times the mass of epic and
    will needa escape velocity of 300,000km per second.
                      'Atomics' Force Field Generator
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         The epic class fighter is without doubt the smallest starfighter
    topossess an atomics generator. Two source reactors forward and aft
    ofthe ship produce a fleet of electromagnetic energy [which wraps
    around the vessel] while an invisible nuclear shell is perfectly angled
    to create energy deflection, as opposed to being impact retardent to
    absorb the energy of attacking weapons.  However, the force field will
    weaken if constant bombardment occurs.  In addition, the field can only
    repel firepower upto a destruction threshold of sevenmegatons per cubic
    metre. ! WARNING ! Once activated the force field will take 4 to 6
    seconds to achieve fullstrength.
                       Weaponry Battery Override Unit
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         This device, when activated, can override all fuel, energy and
    weapon systems to divert all power towards the laser batteries.  This,
    in turn, will allow simultaneous firing of ALL lasers [Not torpedos as
    they have an independant energy source].  Using the energy from this
    nuclear battery can allow up to 10 seconds firing of all weapons in
    several different directions without using the vess el's own energy
    reserve.

                SECTION 2 - Unguided Light Radiation Weapons
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                Laser Rifle
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~
         Triple firing.  This weapon (which is also known as the amber gun)
    uses light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (LASER).
    A laser beam is focused into a liquid nitrogen cooled amber crystal.
    Its chromium atoms are excited into a high energy state so that they
    produce a yellow light which is only allowed to escape in the desired
    direction.  The flash, last ing one thousandth of a second, can bore a
    hole through diamond by vaporisation at 20,000 degrees centigrade
    produced by 2 * 10power of 25 photons.  The rifles can emit nearly 400
    bursts of energy per second and each amber crystal provides enough
    energy for over 60,000 bursts with a range ofover several kilometres.
    The beam would be almost useless against larger craft with shields, but
    are deadly against fighters.
                            Proton Pulse Cannon
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Twin fire.  This is a standard air-to-ground, air-to-air combat
    weaponfor larger frigate class starships and long-range fighters.  It
    can fireup to 80 rounds per minute but it has only enough power for 120
    roundsper cannon, with a range of over 20 kilometres.  The beam has a
    plasma energy bank which feeds off to a main coil, attracting the
    positive protons.  In one square millimetre, 86,000,000,000,000,000,000
    watts of energy are concentrated.  The cannon has around the same
    strength as a low yield nuclear device of 0.7 kilotons and could ripple
    a mediumsized starship with several well placed slots.
                                  Ion Beam
                                  ~~~~~~~~
         Twin fire beam system.  This is a powerful energy beam which has
    been specially modified to fit on small craft, as it is only normally
    foundon a cruiser.  Direct visual contact will result in retina
    damage.  Only 12 rounds can be fired from the battery unit.  The range
    is over 80 kilometres and has a punch of nearly one megaton per sound,
    enough to bring down any small or medium size ship even with shields
    up.
                         The Neutron Epical Blaster
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         This is the most powerful laser system to be fitted to a starship
    [with the exception of mother ships and the new prototype Warbird II].
    A massive single emittance of energy with the power of nearly 100
    megatons could wipe out a city, mountain or Starship on a single blast.
    However, it has only a short range of less than 60km.  The weapon was
    constructed along with the EPiC class fighter.  The laser beam passes
    through aepical isotope producing an almost indestructible epical
    plasma stripped of all neutrons, creating a five metre beam of
    controlled anti-matter.

             SECTION 3 - GUIDED WEAPON SYSTEMS AND SMART UNITS.
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                               Photon Torpedo
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Four only.  An advanced guided missile with a photon nuclear
    detonator andphoton light stream drive which hurls device at high
    speed.  This light stream gives the torpedo a bright glow.  This can
    give the enemy time to raise shields and and brace for impact because
    it is easily visible during combat.  The torpedo device the epic craft
    is fitted with has eight multiple warheads that can airburst and then
    select several closelygrouped targets.  Each warhead carries 3
    megatons.  The torpedo will not activate until it can seek and destroy
    its target.
                           DEFENCE TORPEDO SYSTEM
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         This defence system is exclusive to the EPiC fighter, the
    systemfires bright blue multiple homing torpedos simultaneously in
    four different directions.
                  COBALT SALTED ANTIMATTER DOOMSDAY DEVICE
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         This weapon design was brought to the federation council only 15
    years ago and has only recently been constructed.  Controlled
    experiments have shown devastating results. Its firepower magnitude is
    tenth scale - an unclear explosion of 1,000,000 megatons.  A blast
    range in excess of 200,000 kilometres is enough to wipe out an entire
    planet and its surrounding moons.  The device creates a nuclear
    reaction within a nuclear reaction.  Cobalt particles are obliterated
    in a hydrogen explosion.  The cobalt atom is split in one billionth of
    a second.  The energy level of the hydrogen detonation increases by a
    factor of onemillion. The cobalt is then turned into anti-matter and
    everything within 200,000 kilometres is destroyed.
          MAXIMUM VERTICAL SECURITY DOCUMENT - RESTRICTED VIEWING
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         IMPERIAL REXXON COMMAND DATABANK RECOVERED FROM THE WRECKAGE OF A
    CRIPPLED WARBIRD FLOATING IN THE RETREN MINEFIELD BEFORE THE AUTO
    SELFDESTRUCT SEQUENCE WAS ACTIVATED BY THE ON BOARD COMPUTER.  ALL DATA
    HAS SINCE BEEN CLASSIFIED TO LEVEL 7.
                                   BRIEF
                                   ~~~~~
         The data recovered suggests that the Rexxon fleet is technically
    less advanced than our present generation of starfighters but the
    sheer number of Rexxon crafts provides them with a far greater
    advantage in the combat arena.  Federation statistical analysis teams
    predict that the federation pilots will need to destroy EIGHT
    starfighters for the lossof ONE federation ship.A variety of combat
    simulations has resulted in positive kill ratio of 5-1 in favour of the
    federation.  However, this figure is not good enough to predict an
    overall victory.  In addition, the combat simulator results do not take
    into account the difficulty of fighter protection of the fleet across
    several thousand kilometres of openspace.  Let us not forget, this
    operation is not gladiatorial fighter-v-fighter mission. Convoy ships
    will be easy prey for the enemyfighters.

HISTORY             : Tactical lessons learned from the previous century
                      showed the Rexxon forces how valuable stand-off
                      capability is.  The result is thiseffective long-
                      range interceptor from Deggron R.I.  Analysis
                      suggests that this craft may suffer from lack of
                      manoeuvrability due to its engine configuration, so
                      is easy prey to smaller predators in a close range

                        TOP SECRET MISSION BRIEFING
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     SECRET MEMO TO THE CHIEF OF WAR, ADMIRAL AJAX, STARSHIP REDSTORM.
         The following missions have been preplanned using the Rxt1000
    computer to assimilate each individual mission.  The missions here are
    vital for the safety of the federation fleet.  Some missions may seem
    to have a "no-win scenario" to the incredible demands exerted on the
    pilot, but repeated simulation suggests a 2.7854 percent probability
    that all missions will be successful.  Three EPiC class starfighters
    are available, and in the result of one being destroyed the other two
    willbe on standby.  With the three craft available this gives us a one
    in tenchance of success.
    - For commander of EPiC fighters only.  Classification level 24
    - Exact launch time and date to follow. Commence time zero hours from
    this point.

                              MISSION NUMBER 1
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    MISSION CODE NAME : BREAKTHROUGH
    OBJECTIVES :
    1) To clear a path through the ionic mine belt - the boundary of
       the Rexxon empire.  Engage and destroy any hostile fighters before
       your prescence is detected.
    2) Proceeed directly to Amragan nine and destroy the primary target of
       the deep space tracking station within 122 seconds of entering the
       planets atmosphere.
         LOCATION AND MAP   : The tracking station is located in sector
    YNJ-836????? it is visible for nearly 400 kilometres.
         WEAPONS AND STORES : Only standard laser cannons can be fitted to
    reduce fuel consumption and also to enhance performance in atmospheric
    conditions.  A tractor beam is also fitted for fuel pod collection
    along your proposed trajectory.
         MISSION BACKGROUND: This mission is vital in the escape from the
    Supernova. We are in one of the remotest parts of the galaxy, far away
    from the m assing Rexxon fleet waiting near anchor point, the closest
    point of theRexxon empire to the federation.  The enemy has made a
    critical error in believing that the area, along the trajectory the
    fleet will take, isimpassable due to the large mine belt in this
    vicinity and the automatedlong range scanner located on Amragen Nine.
    They have left the scanner relatively undefended.  The Rexxons have
    also overlooked a blind spot in their defence shield.  Every 42 days,
    Amragan Nine moves behind Amragan Ei ght and a solar eclipse of its sun
    occurs.  So for 421 seconds the tracking station is blinded and cannot
    make contact to the rest of the Rexxon Empire.  A small one man fighter
    can destroy the tracking stationbefore the eclipse ends and create a
    corridor for the fleet to safelypass still undetected by the enemy.
    Failure to destroy the tracking stationin time will result in the
    Rexxons massing a force and easily finding the civilian fleet before it
    can escape into deep space.
         REXXON DEFENCES / FORTIFICATIONS / SQUADRONS: Planet Assault data
    and probable Rexxon defences: Latest intelligence at this stage
    suggests the 7th Strarous was fleet is on a tour of duty in this
    system.  The total firepower consisting of three fighter squadrons and
    two command warbirds with a Frigate escort. Ground Ion cannons,
    ground aerial burst defence systems, possible force field generator
    around thetracking station and the primary force field generator.
    TIME : 34 hours 30 minutes.

                             MISSION NUMBER TWO
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    MISSION CODE NAME: WIPEOUT
    OBJECTIVES:
    1) To destroy the central processing Unit and [or] the four
       intergalactic space ports in the industrial centre of planet
       Tarrun.
    2) Obliterate the mining complexes on the Moon of Statillica
       concentrating firepower on main mine shaft entrance points and the
       collection port and space docks in the central planet zone.
         WEAPONS AND STORES: Two T40 laser cannons, tractor bean unit, a
    new weapon fitted is a powerful twin photon gun.
         MISSION BACKGROUND: Tarrun is the most industrialised planet in
    the Rexxon Empire, with large scale production of enemy fighter craft
    and defence systems.  However, the main use of Tarrun is in the
    production of brinzerctronic crystals used by the Rexxon fleet for
    trans-warp capability.  Destruction of these production sites will
    remove the Rexxons only source of this crystal, thus preventing them
    from engaging the federation in a long term chase across the universe,
    until their stocks are replenished.
         PROBABLY REXXON DEFENCES / FORTIFIC ATIONS / SQUADRONS : Intense
    ground batteries around all key installations including multiple laser
    turrets and guided missile installations.  Warning!  Several crack
    sqaudrons of enemy fighters are based around the CPU on Tarrun and
    the space ports, expect thrity plus bandits over Tarrun and Stallica.
    TIME: 37 hours 12 minutes.

                              MISSION NUMBER 3
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    MISSION CODE NAME: GLORY
    OBJECTIVE : A Rexxon attack legion had massed around the massive outer
    planet Elan andis now enroute to Tarrun.  This force is perhaps not
    enough to destroy thefleet alone, but tactics suggest that they will do
    their utmost to slowthe federation fleet down.  Priority protection
    will be given to the following starships:-Agriculture and food
    producing ships.
    - Fuels tankers and Mineral Fuel Barges.
    - Primary ordinance ship "mars"
         If the Rexxons have already received a transmission from Amragan
    nine then this attack may consist of most of the Rexxon battlefleet.
         WEAPONS AND STORES: All weapons armed, available and ready at this
    time.
         MISSION BACKGROUND: After the assault on the industrial centre in
    the Tarrun solar system the fleet will not be able to commence warp
    drive until they are out of the system, leaving it vulnerable to attack
    for three hours.  Mission control on the Battleaxe has intercepted
    codedtransmission from the Rexxon Fleet. EMERGENCY COUNCIL MEETING, THE
    FEDERATION STARSHIP BATTLEAXE.THIS ATTACK HAS SHOWN HOW VULNERABLE THE
    CIVILIAN FLEET IS.  SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES
    ALREADY AND THE ENEMY HAS YET TO LAUNCH A FULL SCALE ATTACK ON US.
    COMMANDER AJAX HAS FORWARDED THIS PROPOSAL TO THE COUNCIL:In view of
    the worsening situation with the Rexxon forces fully aware ofour
    position and perhaps our heading, the fleet is now facing its
    greatest peril since entering Rexxon territory.  Our fighter squadrons
    have suffered heavily in attempting to protect the civilian ships,
    which are open to the threat of Rexxon interceptors.  It is my belief
    that we cannot guarantee the civilian fleet with the high quantities of
    enemy fighters approaching us.  Therefore, I propose a plan to the
    council.  I propose that the battle fleet draw the enemies attention
    away from the convoy fleet.  Many of our fighters and frigates have
    been lost attempting to defend the fleet.  They are not designed to
    defend but to attack, with their inherent advantage of speed and
    surprise.  It is my intention to go on the offensive against the heart
    of the Rexxon empire using our attack squadrons to launch a decisive
    blow to the Rexxon forces.  The intention is for the federation battle
    fleet and its support ships to leave the civilian fleet with a skeleton
    defence, changing coursetowards the Rexxon capital world of Lizar.
    With the reports of the enemy fleet massing near Torky five they are
    within striking distance of the civilian fleet.  If we employ a bold
    manouvre heading towards the Lizar system to launch an all-out assault
    on the Rexxon high command, theRexxon battle fleet, I beleive, will be
    compelled to come to the aid of its mother planet. The Rexxon solar
    system has been left relativelyundefended as an attack has, more than
    likely, been considered an improbability. This may be the Rexxon`s
    undoing.  Consequently, the civilian fleet can escape into deep space
    as the enemy launches all of its forces against our battle fleet.
    Members of the council, the plan that I put forward to you is, granted,
    a high risk venture.  The conclusion of any action may result in the
    total annihilation of the federation battle fleet.  However, it may
    also give sixty million people the chance to escape from the wrath of
    the Supernova and the Rexxon empire.

    MISSION BACKGROUND: The infamous magma cannon is perhaps one of the
    greatest engineering feats of the Rexxon Construction Corp designed as
    part of an inner defence ring for the capital planet of Lizar. A
    massive dome over 14 kilometres in height towering way above an
    enormous volcanic mountain range.  Within it a giant electron gun
    protrudes upwards into the atmosphere of the planet.  The Magma Cannon
    feeds off the energy deep within the planets core producing enough
    power from its natural power plant to generate a ninth scale powerbeam.
    Punching a hole into the dense atmosphere, reaching out far into space
    across thewidth of th e Lizarian solar system, hitting its target with
    the power of several thousand megatons which no starfighter could ever
    repel.  Themonstrous weapon could rip apart the federation battle fleet
    before it reaches the edge of the Lizar solar system unless an attack
    squadron led by an EPiC class fighter could disable the magma cannon
    before thefleet is in range.
    PLANET ASSUALT DATA : Potead is impenetrable to all conventional
    craft.  The EPiC fighter will be able to sustain flight in the lower
    atmosphere with full use of flight modes. Its gravitational pull will
    drag the craft through 8,000 kilometres of dense atmosphere reaching
    temperatures of 100,000 degrees C.  All landings by the Rexxons have
    been made by massiveheat shielded Rocket Pods on a calc ulated and
    precise trajectory to a destination point. The EPiC fighter's main
    computer will be assigned a similar auto route.
    PROBABLE REXXON DEFENCES / FORTIFICATIONS / SQUADRONS : Due to the
    heavy atmospheric conditions no Rexxon fighter craft can operate in
    this hostile environment, so the primary Rexxon defences are ground
    based with various aerial defensive systems including multiple rocket
    and laser batteries.  The planet also has a terror legion of Amtrak
    fighters which will be ever-present arou nd the vicinity of the Magma
    Cannon.  After this mission, it is expected that the Rexxons will mount
    a major offensive towards thebattle fleet.  At this point we will be
    only seven hundred millionskilometres away from Lizar.  All fighters
    are to be put on red alert as soon as the Magma cannon is disabled.

                              MISSION NUMBER 5
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    MISSION CODE NAME : GALACTIC STORM
    OBJECTIVE : To neutralise the remaning space forces of the regional
    Lizar battlefleet.
    LOCATION AND MAP: Local Galaxy Celest. Qu ad 64g.
    WEAPONS AND STORES: Dependant on stocks.
    MISSION BACKGROUND: It is anticipated that after the assault on the
    Planet Potead all regional forces will be scrambled and will mass on
    our trajectory towards Lizar. The battlefleet will encounter a
    considerable number of Rexxon Warbirds, Frigates and very large numbers
    of one-man fighters[exact numbers are unobtainable at this time]. It is
    also believed that the imperial guards may also be used for the first
    time.  These are the elite starfighters th at protect the Rexxon
    council and have maintained the tradition of invincibilty over the last
    few hundred years.  The battlefleet will launch a direct assault upon
    the main enemy fleet withthe EPiC class fighter and three squadrons
    ofstarfighters will launcha three pronged attack on the enemies flank.
    The federation crusiers willengage the Warbirds. All firepower will be
    concentrared on crippling theenemy motherships. We will have to
    eliminate over 60%  of the enemyto ensure total and final success.
         PROBABLY REXXON DEFENCES / FORTIFICATIONS / SQUADRONS : The enemy
    will scramble every available starfighter in the solar system.Analysis
    suggests that the combined number of enemy fighters will exceed 100,
    interceptors 40, Rexxon Warbirds and frigat es 10.WARNING - The enemy
    space fleet may catch us at any point.  Time is critical. To ensure
    success we must quickly eliminate the regional enemy space fleet,
    before the arrival of the main Rexxon battleforce.

                              MISSION NUMBER 6
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    MISSION CODE NAME: RETALIATOR
    OBJECTIVE: To effect the final and total annihilation of the Grand
    ImperialRexxon command centre and the government complex of Grand
    Lizar.
    LOCATION AND MAP: The imperial Rexxon command centre is located in the
    central metropolis of Lizarico City.  The target is easily identifiable
    as the city's communication links originate from this central location.
    WEAPONS AND STORES: Depandant on stores.
    MISSION BACKGROUND: To ensure a swift and total destruction of the
    enemycommand and all its governing body, preventing a long term Rexxon
    vendetta and an extended conflict across the gulf of the universe. When
    the human race settles on Ulysses VII, a new order will exist acrossthe
    galaxy as the human race rebuilds a more tranquil exist ance.
    PROBABLE REXXON DEFENCES/FORTIFICATIONS/SQUADRONS : Not known at this
    time.

                              MISSION NUMBER 7
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    MISSION CODE NAME: MOTHER OF ALL BATTLES.
    OBJECTIVE: Save the human race from total destruction in the largest
    space conflict in recorded history.
    LOCATION AND MAP: The grand Moons of Hydraden 12 billion Km cosmic East
    of Lizar.
    WEAPONS AND STORES: Dependant on stores.
    MISSION BACKGROUND: The arrival of the enemy is imminent. The combined
    battle strength of seven armies across the entire Rexxon empire have
    joined forces to outgun Federation forces to a factor of 3, spearheaded
    by two gargantuan Rexxon dreadnoughts and their assault ships.  We are
    not expecting victory but perhaps this valiant battle may save the
    remnants of the human fleet who have skipped to safety through this
    torrid war zone. Maybe in the future of mankind this battle will
    neverbe forgotten.
    PROBABLY REXXON DEFENCES / FORTIFICATIONS / SQUADRONS : 2 Imperial
    Dreadnoughts.  40 Rexxon Warbirds. 140 Battle Frigates.  200 Long range
    interceptors.  1000 Short range interceptors.

          THE CD DATABANK OF THE UNIVERSE: REF HISTORY 68732.1556
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    THE BATTLE OF VIREK : First human encounter with the Rexxons. An
    unfortunate occasion which resulted in the most famous strategic
    engagement in the history of the human race.  It is now of great
    relevance due to the fact that Rexxonic doctrine in war planning and
    battle factors have changed very little over the last few centuries and
    therefore lessons learned from this may help the fleet in guessing
    Rexxon tactics. Four hundred and ten years ago, before the emancipation
    of the United Federeration, the human space fleet has colonised many
    planets cosmic east of Atlantis halfway toward the planet Lizar
    including ALTAIRA ONE - a life sustaining, ore rich planet, of no
    strategic importance.  At that time nobody knew it was an ancient
    incubation planet, and t herefore, a sacred centre of worship to the
    little known race called the Rexxons. It was unfortunate for the human
    race because unscrupulous human profiteers found the incubation
    chambers, stealing artifacts stored from the Rexxons past lives, in
    preparation for the next.  All of these sites were, eventually,
    destroyed by the profiteers. ALTAIRA ONE was subsequently attacked with
    complete surprise by a Rexxon battleforce.All colonists were captured
    or killed. The several thousand hostages were to pay for the crime.

                              SUPERNOVA FACTS
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1) A Supernova is a rare type of star which explodes with great
       violence and then fades.
    2) A Supernova is a result of nuclear sysnthesis.
    3) A Supernova occurs on average every one second somewhere in the
       universe in the universe. i.e - The Crab Nebula exploded in 1064AD.
       It measured one hundred thousand billion KM across. The star has to
       be a twelve megnitude star, usually a giant red or blue sun.  The
       star expands, the surface becomes cooler. It then seperates into
       layers within its core [which consists of an iron compound].  When
       it explodes the shockwave energy is 10 to the power of 53.  Imagine
       the total energy burned in ten million years multiplied by 100 -
       dissipatedin one second. This is ten to the power of 20 megatons.
       The sun is nowa neutron star [12 million tons per cubic inch] at
       19km acrossweighing the same as the sun.
