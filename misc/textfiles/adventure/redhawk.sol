Redhawk - The Solution

    There are three places you really need to know about in this game. These
are Oxford Gardens, Smallman Street and Brook Court. At these locations the
exits are to the west and can only be accessed by going to them by taxi or by
flying as Redhawk. Three items can be found at these locations: the cat which
is given to the RAT, the wellies which are worn as Redhawk so FUSOR cannot kill
him when he strikes with a lightning bolt. And finally, a pair of gloves which
are given to the scientist (must be before 15:00 hrs.) when you are Kevin. The
scientist will then do an analysis of them and tell you that they show traces
of explosives. These gloves are then given to the professor. The pink tube
found on the train is given to Lesley.

    A magnet is found at the power station. This is taken by Redhawk and given
to TECHNO. When Redhawk is given a radio in return for catching the first
mugger, drop it, change to Kevin and pick it up again. Kevin can now listen to
the radio and find out when robberies and muggings are taking place.

    On FUSOR, the RAT, TECHNO and MERLIN have cards. To get the cards,
examine.... (name) then type TAKE (colour) CARD from (name). This will work
with all except Merlin. To get a card from Merlin, enter the gallery as Kevin
and examine MERLIN. Then say KWAH and examine MERLIN again. Then proceed to
take the card.

    At the Warehouse there is a vase. This is found by examining the Warehouse
and is taken to the museum and given to the curator. In return he gives you a
book. Read it and you are given some important information. (To get into the
museum initially, you must be Redhawk).

    When all four cards have been collected and the information gleaned from
the book, the gloves given to the professor and the pink tube to Lesley, you
must go to Heath station and drop the radio. Type in the following all in one
sentence.... D, D, S, E, E, U, say "KWAH", U. Then you will be at the Reactor
Complex. Hit the professor and insert the cards into the bomb in the same order
in which you found them. When this is done you have completed the game.

    Points to remember: every time there is a mugging, arrest the mugger and
take a photo. This ensures that your popularity is kept topped up so that you
keep the radio. Also, only become Redhawk when it is really necessary.
