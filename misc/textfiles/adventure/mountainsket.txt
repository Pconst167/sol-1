CHEAT MODE
~~~~~~~~~~
 When the game starts go east, east, north and then kill the man. When asked
if you wish to escape, press 'Y'. After he's had another swipe at you and
you're asked 'Which way?' use CAPS SHIFT + 8 to jump outside the quote marks
and then delete them. Now enter the line CHR$ USR 4867, which forces a jump
to ROM, then ENTER, then RUN, and the program runs but the break protection
disappears. If you then POKE 250 into 23323, 23324 and 23325, your abilities
are then increased accordingly, which should make you a pretty fearsome
opponent.
