This is the now complete solution of Time Tunnel.


GOAL:

The goal is to find seven pieces of scripture.


BASIC KNOWLEDGE:

You can always teletransport to the secret room by 
pressing and holding the fire button for two or three seconds. 
There, you can store up to three or four objects. You will 
also find the torch, necessary to complete the game.
Teletransport back to your original situation holding the
button again.

To take objects to and from this room, just hold the button 
when picking them. Otherwise, you will leave the room
without them.

You may see, from time to time, a coloured sphere appearing
from nowhere. These spheres are annoying: if you touch one,
it will transport you to a specific time.


WALKTHROUGH:

Start by taking the log on the mansion, which is
on the room on the right door. From there, you have the
time destination control room on the right, and the 
time machine room on the left. Exit on the left with the log.

You are now on the time machine room. The machine is out of order.
Leave on the only door on the left while carrying the log.
Place the log on the fireplace and shoot at it.
You will start a fire and a time machine piece will appear on
the table. Pick it up, take it to the time machine room,
climb the stair up to the top, face the gnome to the left and
drop the piece there. The machine is now ready.

Retrieve the torch from the secret room, and move it over the
lit fireplace; you now have a lit torch, necessary for all
the dark rooms in the game.

Then travel to...

STONE AGE - Year 9600 BC
Get the stick and shoot down the two small rocks with your
lightning which are at the top of the screen. Take them all to the
round boulder blocking your path on the left,  but at ground 
level (not the one on the higher path). Put the largest boulder
on your possession just a bit apart from the blocking stone. 
Then, drop the log over the stone you just placed. 
Climb to the top platform and drop the other, smaller stone. 
The obstacle should now move. If it doesn't, realign the
stone and log. Go along to the cave on the left
screen with the lit torch, the scripture piece is there.

There is a cage lying around, which shall be taken to
California; and a magic potion inside the other dark cave,
that you should take to Colonial Salem.


MAGICAL PERSIA - Year 893 BC
Take the glass from the mansion table.
Travel to Persia and walk one screen north.
There is a woman on a magic carpet here.
This part requires some imagination... the game requires
you to place both the cup and the wine flask (lying around
in Persia) on the floor, under the flying carpet's path.

Wait until the woman descends and leaves a key.
Get the key and exit south, then travel to...

SPACESHIP - Year 3456

Walk south, and keep walking south until you get to a room
with two levers. Activate both and then keep walking south
until you return to the room with a view of a moon.
You will see a cauldron, take it later to Colonial Salem.

Take the flashing, round object on the control panel and exit
right. You will find a hole which matches with the object,
put it there. Open the safe box with the key you got at Persia.
Take the pyramid key and exit right.
Put the key on its lock under the left pad.

Now you have to teleport using a pad and go for the other piece
of scripture. The problem is, oxygen runs out before you can
get a grasp on it.

The previous solution stated that the oxygen tank was needed
to successfully recover the piece. It said that placing it on 
the same pad you use to teleport would do it.

What I had to do is use the rightmost pad, with no need for the
oxygen tank. Don't know if the numbers on the tubes have anything to do.
Just keep trying and you will eventually get the piece.
Another problem is, if you solve the California scripture puzzle
sequence first, then you can't remove the oxygen tank from its place.

When you finally get the scripture, return to your original position on
the lower-left corner to return.

Exit the spaceship by going left on the control panel room, then through
the numbered door.



Put the two scripture pieces on any room on your mansion and then
get the dynamite from the safe box on the spaceship.
Go back to Persia, walk three rooms north until you find the large
boulder. Put the dynamite on the boulder, just a little above
the floor, and centered on the base. Placement counts, so
you may need some adjusting. Light the dynamite with the
torch and wait for the explosion.

Enter the cave with the torch and exit through the
right door. Take the lamp on the floor and exit the cave.
Walk south, and drop the lamp next to the snake basket.
Shoot the lamp and a flute will appear. Remove the basket
top, and take the flute. The gnome will play, and when the snake
emerges, it will carry another piece of scripture.
Take it, and time the snake so as not to touch it.

On your way out, notice the yellow shield (which looks
more like a vase) on the exit room. Take it later to 
Mythological Greece. Don't forget your torch either.

Now is a good time to travel to...

BLACK HOLE - Year 9999

Getting the piece here is as simple as walking to it.
But don't take it with you, this is the place where you have to 
deposit all the pieces.


Then travel to...

COLONIAL SALEM

Get the broom from the shop plus the second potion and take
them to the log house on the right end of town. Bring the 
cauldron from the spaceship. Then put the cauldron in the fireplace, 
put the broom in the cauldron and the two potions.
Go outside, wait for a bat to appear and shoot it.
Pick him up and put it on the cauldron.
Fire at all this twice, then jump on the broom.
Exit the house riding the broom, then fly east.
Two rocks can be picked up, one leads to the exit,
the other covers the piece of scripture.

Now it's time for...

CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH - Year 1842
 
Enter the house on the middle.
You have to place the oxygen tank on the pad near 
the elevator-with-a-chain. Then, get the horse food 
from the dark room (on the left side of town), using the 
torch as light. Make the horse follow you two screens right.
There's a mechanism on the floor which moves the elevator chain. 
Get the horse to walk over there, and with some luck it will get 
stuck. Now you can go down the elevator. Be sure to bring 
the cage you find on year 9600 BC.

Descend on the elevator and drop the cage one screen to the left,
before the scorpion. Go right and pick up the balloon, 
go up and inflate it on the oxygen tank; descend and go left. 
Drop it on the cage and the cage will fly. Shoot the balloon 
when it's exactly over the scorpion. This will trap the scorpion 
and you can go past it and get another piece of scripture, avoiding the stalactites.


Travel to Greece now.

You find a yellow shield which looks more like a vase lying 
around on Persia. Take it to Greece and enter the building on the right.
Walk north, left, left and you will find... Medussa? Anyway, 
advance to the left immediately holding the shield as you enter, 
to face the beast. If you don't, the projectile will hit the gnome. 
Once you deflect the shot with the shield, Medussa will disappear. 
Get the sword that lies undefended. Go right, then right, and you 
will find a wall which has a marked block. Approach with the sword
and the block will disappear, revealing a candelabra. There's another
candelabra hidden on a block if you go south, on the east wall.

Take both candelabra to the room east of Medussa's room. You should see two
pedestals around, and one under the arch. Place the candelabra on the left
and right pedestals. You have to be standing aside from each pedestal to do it, not
in front of it. When placed correctly, the last piece of scripture will appear.


LAST STAGE

Take all the pieces of scripture to the Black Hole.
They will form an inverted sign which will come up on the screen.

It reads something like "Damyo has the staff".

Now go back to Persia, to the snake basket. Open it, and the snake will transform
into a staff.  Take it, and enter the cave you discovered with the explosion.
Walk through the north door (on the center of the wall) carrying the staff
and you'll win the game.

Thanks to Georg Rottensteiner for help on the final stage.
Thanks go to whoever wrote the initial solution too, don't know his name.
