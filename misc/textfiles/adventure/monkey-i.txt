[10/07/90]          Secret Of Monkey Island:Part 1
Hi all:
 This is a general start for Secret Of Monkey Island.

The 1st thing you do is go into the SCUMM bar, talk to all the pirates.
Then go into next room and talk to the 3 important Pirates.  After that
wait for the cook to exit the kitchen, and enter that, take the slab of
meat, and dip it in the boiling Stuff.  G o outside step on far right
corner and knock the bird in the air, take the Fish.  Go back inside,
dip the fish in the boiling stuff Pick up the pot under the counter and
exit.  Next go visit the Voodoo guy and he says some crap, but take the
single rubber c hicken.  Next go outside to the pirates and talk them
into giving you a map and some money.  Next go into the jail talk to the
guy and he will want breath mints go to the store buy them, and give it
to the guy, he will ask you for a trade....  You can also g o into the
cliffs by going directly left up from the 1st screen you start on, if
you are in the path you can take a yellow petal from a flower bush...  I
have found an Island house with no way across other to use the chicken
pulley..  Another thing, i have found the Troll, he wants something, you
give him the stewed fish, and he lets you pass..  You then can go to a
house and you will find the guy who will train you.  Ok now go to the
circus, and use the pot as a helmet.  They will give you money, you then
go to the store and buy a shovel, and a sword.  Leave town, and go to
the trainer's house, he'll teach you about sword play, then leave.  Go
out and see all the walking pirates, and learn their insults. go into
the fork again, and wander around, when you see a small sign, push it
with your shovel.  Then walk along the wood bridge, and find the sword
master.  Challenge and beat her..  Great You have completed 1/3 of being
a pirate..  Now continue to walk around and find an 'X' dig there and
get the second treasure. ..  Ok now make your way to the governors
mansion, and put the yellow petal in the meat and give to piranhas dogs.
They will go to sleep.  Go into he house, take the vase open the door,
and enter..  Just watch it is kind of cool..  Then when you exit, go bac
k to the jail, give the prisoner the gopher repellant.  He will give you
a cake, Open the cake and look at the file..  Go back to Governors
house, go through hole in wall, watch some more.  Congrats you have just
gotten the 3rd part of being a pirate..  Now g o back to the Chicken
Pulley Island, swing across, tell the chrome dome that the governor was
captured, let him think, and when you play with the animal, stroke it!
Now go to the Master Swordsmen, tell her about the governor, get her to
join you.  Now go t o Scumm bar, pick up another slab of meat, and all
the mugs you can find..  Fill 1 cup with grog, and exit, make your way
to the jail. when you are about to lose the mug o' grog, select the use
mug (with the liquid) and replace with new mug.. then do it ag ain when
it is near death..  Then when you get to the jail, use the grog on the
jail cell.  You have freed him, Now ask him to join you..  Ok now go to
Stan's (Boat Place) and ask to buy a boat, he will tell you you need
credit so go to the store in town ( h e will also give you a business
card, and a compass)..  Ask the guy for a note, and watch how he opens
the safe, when he puts note back ask him to go speak to sword master.
Then go up to safe use the push/pull thing on the handle to open safe,
get note c lose safe, and go back to stan.  When you go to stan ask him
for the boat in the far back.  You say $5000, he will say no, so u
leave, he calls you back, you then buy the boat for $5000!  Now go to
where you 1st start game, and you will meet stan, he will wa nt to buy
boat back, and it is kinda funny!  This is the end of part 1!

Oh BTW There is a part when the sheriff throws you in the water, you get
the idol, and climb out, you automatically get the sword.

                   The Secret of Monkey Island Solve
                                Part ][
-------------------------------------------------------------------
First I'd like to say before I get on with this solution that I'd
like to see more solutions to some of these new games coming out.
I enjoyed reading the solutions for Part 1 of Monkey Island but it
was too damn confusing for some people and there were about 10 or
so of them all under different file names which pissed me off cause
I don't need to waste the time downloading, eh?  So please anyone
who writes a solution to a game, keep it neat and clean and none of
this Word Perfect or Word for Windows format shit, ok?  Thanks...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, first thing you have to do is open the desk drawer and look
inside of it.  You'll notice a book which you take.  This is just
a diary of the previous owner of the ship which you can read it if
you want to but it's not necessary.  Then grab the feathered pen
and then the ink off the desk.  Go out onto the deck and you can
talk to the mutinous pirates if you want to but they aren't going
to help you any.  Go climb up the rope ladder and grab the Jolly
Roger.  Then go back to the deck and down the hatch behind your
mutinous crew.  Go to the door and down into the kitchen.  Next,
open the cupboard and grab a box of cereal.  Open it up and you
will find a toy surprise which turns out to be a small key when you
look at it.  Get the pot on the table and go back up the ladder.
Now go down the second hatch from the crew's living quarters.  Grab
the rope and open the kegs on the left and look in them to get some
gunpowder.  Open the bottom right chest and look in it to get the
fine wine you will need later.  Ok, now go back up to your room and
use the small key you found in the cereal on the cabinet.  Get the
small chest and open it then look in it.  You will find a recipe
and some cinnamon sticks.  You can look at the recipe but you don't
need it since I will include the correct ingredients here.  Go back
out to the deck and use the rope on the cannon.  Then put the
gunpowder you have in the cannon nozzle.  Go back down to the
leaking storeroom and get some more gunpowder then go back to the
kitchen.  You might want to save your game here...Just a
suggestion...Hahaha...Ok, now here is the list of objects you need
to use in the pot:

- CINAMON STICKS
- RUBBER CHICKEN
- BREATH MINTS
- JOLLY ROGER
- GUNPOWDER
- FINE WINE
- CEREAL
- INK

Pretty weird, eh?  Oh well...Now you'll pass out and when you
awake, go out to the deck and you'll see you're are Monkey Island.
Go down into the kitchen and use the bussiness cards you got from
Stan in the red hot fire.  Run back up to the deck and use the
flaming mass on the fuse and use the pot then you'll get blown onto
the island.  You might want to save your game before you do that
because it's frustrating when the fuse burns out before you get the
pot on and into the cannon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Keep an eye out for the solution to Part ]I[ since I'm in the
catacombs right now, which are a pain in the ass, but I should be
done with it soon.  It's weird...G.P. LeChuck doesn't really seem
like a bad guy on the island at all!  Anyways, you can email me on
a board that I call if you need any extra help on the game.

The Secret of Monkey Island Solve

Part III

Solved and Typed By The Blademan:


Haven't seen a solve for part 3 yet, guess its my turn to type it out. I think
this part was a bit harder that the prevous parts, but what do I know!  Try and
solve the game on your own first, use this as a last resort. It takes all the
fun and adventure out of the game to simply read these cheats and walk thru the
game. Now to business...

You've just been shot from the cannon and ended up on the beach.  Pick up the
banana. You can read the sign posted on the tree if you like, it has some hints.
Now head into the jungle, go northwest, the screens will scroll as you make your
way around the island.  Go to the beach to the leftmost part of the screen and
read the note. Head back into the jungle. Go to the fort. Take the rope, the
spyglass, push the cannon, take the cannon ball and some gunpowder. Head back
into the jungle.

Go to the right a few screens, find the dry river bed, there is a strung up
person with some rope. You can't get the rope yet. Read the note. Head back
into the jungle. Go to the northest to the river fork. Take the rock that's
holding a note down. Read the note, next look at the rock, it's a flint. Now
go up the footladder, you'll come to a rock on a see-saw (catapult). Use the
spyglass till it tells you your looking at the bananas, then push-pull the
"primitive art" till its directly inline with it. Now go up the ladder, use
the spyglass again and look around for fun. Now push the big rock that's near
the edge. If you aligned the catapult correctly, it will hit the tree and
knock the bananas off. If not, go down and realign it and then get another
rock from the pile and oush it off. Try not to sink the ship. Fo a laugh, while
ontop of the stone lookout, walk to the righ as far as you can and see what
happens. This is Lucasfilms dig at Sierra.

Climb down from the rocks, read any notes. Once down, go to the damn, stand in
front of it. Use the gunpowder on the damn, use the flint with the cannon ball.
Boom! Ride the water. The go tothe pond where the hung person was and get the
rope from him. Throughout the who game, Herman Toothrot will come up to you,
talk to him if you like to learn some hints. Head back into the jungle.

Go right one screen, go to the beach, find the bottle, read the note. Then
gp south two screens to the "crack" and find the strong branch. Tie a rope
to it, lower yourself, tie a rope to the stump and lower yourself again.
Get the oars. Head back into the jungle.

Go back to the beach. If you see the monkey you can feed him all the bananas
you have. Once on the beach, pick up the bananas that fell off the tree when
you hit it with the rock. Use the oars withthe rowboat. Go north three times,
go to the beach, the head back into the jungle.

Go to the village. It appears empty, go east twice tothe big monkey head.
Get the bananas in the bowl. Go east twice. The cannabals will stop you.
Talk to them, they'll throw you in jail. In jail, get the cute skull, move
the board and escape. Now go back to the beach, use the rowboat and go
to beach where you found the bananas. Head back into the jungle.

Find the monkey. Keep feeding him all the bananas you have till he looks
happy. (Click on LOOK AT MONKEY) He will then follow you around. Now
head in the jungle, go north twice, then east to the clearing, this is the
sacred monkey grounds. Go the the totem pole. Find the nose, pull it, it
opens a gate to the monkey head. It will close as soon as you release it.
The monkey will climb up and hold it down. Go in and get the whimpy idol.
Bring this back to the cannabals and offer it to them so they don't eat you.
They will be very grateful. Go into the hut and get the banana picker, then
give it to Herman Toothrot, he will give you a key. (its a giant Q-Tip)
Walk around, if the cannabals don't reappear, leave the village then come
right back. Talk them and and get the navigator's head from them. You'll
have to trade your leaflet or brochure for it. Head back into the jungle.

Go back to the sacred monkey grounds, go to the money's head. (if you can't
get back in type USE NAVIGATORS HEAD and the gate will open) Then position
yourself in the giant monkey's ear and use the monkey key and the mouth will
open. Go into the catacombs, use the navigators head and follow the direction
the eyes point. After awhile it will lead you to the ghost ship. Once there
TALK to the NAVIGATORS HEAD and tell him you want the necklace. Wear the
necklace, it makes you invisible, go onto the ship.

Go below using the hatch. look around. Go through the passage, then pick up
the chicken. (See the glowing crate!! Also, notice the locked hatch?) Now go
back to the sleeping ghost, tickle his feet with the feather a few times till
he drops the grog. Get the jug. Now go up on deck, go left to the door, open
it. Here is LeChuck. You want the key hanging on the wall, but can't get near
it. Use the magnetic compass to get the key (this is where I was stuck !@#$)
Go back below and now open the hatch, walk down it. To get by the rat, pour
grog into the dish. Go to the pot, get some grease. Go above deck.

Try opening the door to the righ (Tool shop and Brig) It squeaks and the ghost
keeps shutting it. Put some grease on the hinge. Open the door, get the tools
and go below deck and open the glowing crate and get the root. Go to the
canabals and they will make a special potion for you. Go back to the ship.
You'll meet up with the ghost, talk to him. Your crew will also show up.
You can kill the ghost if you want.

Now you're back on MeLee Island, you want to stop the marraige. Use the
seltzer to kill the two ghost you meet. Go to the church. Once inside, click on
STOP THE WEDDING!! Save the game here. You need to be fast at one point here,
but if you blow it, you can still win. After a confrontation with the govenor
and LeChuck, the monkeys run off with the govenors ghost killer potion. Now
LeChuck will attemp to beat you up. If you are fast enough, spray him will
selter. If you don't, you'll be knocked into orbit. (I suggest letting it
happen to see this happen, its quite funny) You'll land on Stan's Used Boat
lot, right on a soda machine. Quickly pick up the ROOT BEER bottle and use it
on LeChuck. If you blow it, don't worry, you'll be knocked in space again,
you'll land at the sword instructors house. Use the root beer as soon as you
can. Once you do, LeChuck will vanish for good, the govenor will be your
girlfriend, fireworks will go off and you can now go to bed!

Great game. If you bought it, you can send in a card for the 256 color VGA
upgrade. I hope someone does and posts it on the boards. Kinda sucks that they
didn't include it to begin with.

If there are any typos, though! What do you expect at 2am...The Blademan
