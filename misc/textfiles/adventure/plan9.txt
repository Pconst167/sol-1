   of the street where Bela used to to live.Talk to the barman and buy the
   bottle of rum.

   should have gone by now. Examine his desk and you'll find a key-its for
   the editing room.

   particular the  one on the far left, you should  discover an address on
   one of them - Lot 9,Pleasant Rest,Highgate.
5) Then go downstairs  and talk to the doorman, ask him to call you a cab.
   Then go outside and  climb into  the cab.Tell the cabbie to take you to
   Lot 9,Pleasant Rest,Highgate.
6) Once you arrive go into the cemetery and enter the crypt.Examine Bela's
   body to  discover  a door key and pick up the hammer.
7) Climb back into the cab and go to  Vlad Street. Enter  the house and go
   into the study.
8) Examine  the flyer on  the  table next to  the books,its an  advert for  
   the local mall. Pick up the pictures of Bela also on the table.
9) Examine the trophies  hanging up on the back  wall. Try pushing the one 
   on the left-a credit card should fall out.
10)Leave the house and take the cab to the Mega-Mall.
11)Press the elavator  call button. When the doors open walk inside and go
   to floor number 2.
12)Leave the lift  and  enter  the Lycanthropository (huh??) Buy the scary
   mask.(Pay for everything you buy with the credit card).
13)Examine  the mask - you'll find a note and a small key (read the note).
14)Go to  floor number 3 and  go into Ted's Travel Agents and buy a ticket
   to Rio.
15)Then go to floor number 5 and go into the  hardware  store. Talk to the
   assistant  say..... "Nice day for gatherin' corn." then  buy the spade.
   (you'll have to examine the  tool you want  to buy first)  then use the
   passport with  the photocopier  and you'll get a copy of  your passport
   photograph.
16)Finally,go to floor number 6 and enter the bank. Talk to the teller and
   change some of your money into the currencies of Washington,Brazil,Hong
   Kong and Australia. Examine  the credit  card and  jot down the  number
   which is scribbled on  the back of it,it should be 350143. Hand the key
   which you found in the scary mask to the teller,she'll ask you for your
   safety deposit box number select 530143.
17)Open the safety deposit box and take the reel of film,examine it and it
   should have `WUN' on it. (If you want to watch the reels of film to see
   whats on  them you can either go to the editing room in the  studio  or
   go to any of the projection booths scattered throughout the game,simply
   give the guy the film.Theres a cinema on floor number 4).
18)Leave the mall and go to the cemetery for a spot of`Grave-digging'.Walk
   around the  cemetery until you  find a grave  with a wooden  cross as a 
   headstone with  the  name J Harris  on it. Use the  spade to dig up the
   grave-you'll  need to  use the spade  three  times before  you find the
   second reel of film.This reel should be marked `OF'.
19)Now go to the airport. Give the rep. the ticket and board the plane. Go
   inside to cockpit and talk to the pilot (the one on the right). Ask him
   if he knows a place to stay. Remember his name is Steve Peters.
20)Once you  arrive in Rio  jump in the cab and  you will be taken to  the 
   hotel.   
21)Remember the pilot said he left something behind  when he stayed  here?
   well examine the registration book to find out what room he  stayed in.
   Then ask for a room, when she asks you  what room  you want ask her for 
   the same room Steve Peters stayed in.

   ID off the table. Examine it to find out his address -  21 Aviation Way
   Studio Town.
23)Replace his photograph  on his  ID with the one of you, the one you got
   when you used the photocopier with your passport.

   Bela of you and leave you alone. Pick up the third reel of film, marked
   `LO'.
25)Go back to the airport where a group of not so friendly security guards
   will grab you and take you to the police station.

   unfair trial you'll end up in a prison cell.
27)Give the  bottle of rum to  the prison guard and he'll  leave  the room
   giving you the chance to escape..he'll drop a statue before he  leaves,
   pick it up.If you try hitting it you'll discover that it is hollow, use
   the hammer on the statue to break it open,you'll find a slimy DeathHead
   moth pupa.
28)Once youve escaped go to the airport and give the rep your ticket. Once
   you get back home get a cab to Avaition Way.
29)O.k,to get into the house use the credit card to open the door.Once you
   are inside pick up the scuba gear (you'll  have to drop some stuff) and
   then go  into the back  garden where you'll find the forth reel of film
   marked `property'.
30)Alrighty,go  to the studios store room and pick up the love beads. Then
   take a cab to the airport.

   the hippy commune.Then go to the diner and pick up the balloon. Go back
   to the  store  room in the studio  and pick up the dictionary. Fly back
   to Australia and go to the hippy commune.Talk to the  two hippy's about
   Fred  and they'll  give you a reel of film he left  behind..it's marked
   `H.K'.

35)Go to the bridge and talk to  the painter  you'll walk  over to him and 
   slip,falling off the bridge and into the water.  Quickly  use the scuba
   gear before you drown. Pick up the crow bar and then  use balloon  with
   the scuba gear,you'll then shoot to the surface!

   poster.
