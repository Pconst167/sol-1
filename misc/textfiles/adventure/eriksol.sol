DOLPHIN: When you meet the dolphin, you go OUT, FILL JAR, FILL FLASK, IN. This gives you the required breath. Note that it is necessary to use either bottle or jar to water the plant, and subsequently must be filled with breath again.

SHELTERED BEACH: It is not important and leads to the dwarves, like Hot Rock; it doesn't matter which route you choose. To open the door hit it with the hammer.
