=====INTRO=====

  Having completed Wishbringer in one day, I thought I would type up this file
to help anyone stuck somewhere in the game, who is smart enough not to by the
original or the InvisiClues.  I would first like to give a brief background on
Wishbringer.  The object of Wishbringer is to find the cat, Chaos, and bring
him/her/it back the woman who owns the Magick Shoppe.  Wishbringer is unique  
in that it can be solved many different ways (thus allowing for longer game-
play).  Wishbringer (the item you will find) is equipped with 7 wishes, and
the game can be solved without using any of them.  In my completing the story,
I had to use one wish, and I may try to go back and solve the story without
using that wish, but the solution I provide here will be the same.  You will
end up with 95 out of 100 pts, while still successfully completing the game.
This solution will not be "exact".  As it is, there are wandering monsters
("Boots") that you will have to avoid on your own.  I will present answers to
any obstacles that may seem difficult to people like me who did not buy the
game package.  Notes will be included in brackets..  If you have any Ques-
tions, leave mail on one of the above boards......

 just type "Y"]
