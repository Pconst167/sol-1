SHADOWS OF MORDOR - SOLUTION - TYPED BY VAXALON - 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(You can play this game in various ways, as Frodo, as Sam, or as both 
characters. This solution assumes that you're Frodo.)

START: Make your way to the cliff by going S, E, E, N, E, and if you don't
meet Smeagol on the way just WAIT until he turns up.

SMEAGOL: HIT SMEAGOL WITH SWORD when he appears, then when he falls to the
ground SAY TO SAM "TIE ROPE TO SMEAGOL". When Smeagol complains and asks 
you to release him you must SAY TO SMEAGOL "NO". He will offer to act as a
guide, so SAY TO SMEAGOL "PROMISE" and when he reluctantly agrees you should
UNTIE ROPE and SAY TO SMEAGOL "FOLLOW ME". He should follow you from now on,
but if he doesn't it may be because he's tired so go back and find him and
SAY TO SMEAGOL "REST".

CLIFF: There are two ways down. Both require you to CUT TREE WITH SWORD.
This command may need repeating, but eventually you'll be left with a stump
and a branch.
(1) Take branch and use it to lever boulders to edge of cliff, then
LEVER ROUND ROCK OVER CLIFF to send the lighter one over the edge. Tie rope
to remaining (LUMPY) boulder and CLIMB DOWN ROPE to ledge below. When your
companions arrive, PULL ROPE to release it then tie it round the other 
boulder and CLIMB DOWN ROPE to the bottom. PULL ROPE to retrieve it.
(2) LEVER STUMP OVER CLIFF then go down hole made by cutting the tree.
HOLD OUT CRYSTAL to enable you to see, or cut branch into twigs and light
twigs with match. Go through tunnels until you come out on the ledge where 
you TIE ROPE TO STUMP, then CLIMB DOWN ROPE and PULL ROPE.

BASE OF CLIFF/SWAMP: Go to northern edge of swamp and DROP ALL. Go to the
four logs and SAY TO SAM "DRAG LOG". Go back to edge of swamp and 
SAY TO SAM "DROP LOG". Do this for all four logs and BUILD RAFT - which is
why you retrieved the rope after coming down the cliff.

RAFT/CROSSING SWAMP: SAY TO SAM "GET ALL", SAY TO SAM "GET ON RAFT" then get
on it yourself and POLE RAFT with the branch to the other side. SAY TO SAM
"GET OFF RAFT" the POLE RAFT back across again for Smeagol and repeat the
procedure for him. Finally you GET OFF RAFT and PULL ROPE to retrieve it.

OTHER SIDE OF SWAMP: Make your way to the Rough Paved Highway by following
Smeagol's advice. If a black rider enters then do nothing; if you stay
still he should fly off again. If an orc enters just leave the location
immediately to avoid it.

ROTTEN WOODS: You may have to WAIT here a few turns until the exit to the
east opens up. Then go E, SE, E, SE, S, and WAIT until Skinny Orc appears.
If you happen to meet him on your way there, try to ignore him as there's a
chance that a black rider might appear.

SKINNY ORC: KILL ORC WITH SWORD as soon as he appears, and repeat command
if necessary, or alternate this command with SAY TO SAM "KILL SKINNY ORC
WITH SWORD". Note that you have to specify to Sam which orc to kill or he
gets confused, especially if, as is possible, other orcs appear at this 
point. When the skinny orc is dead EXAMINE ORC to learn about the length
of fishing line, and TAKE LENGTH. Then head for the water hole.

WATER HOLE: TAKE PARCHMENT, and if you want a laugh don't leave at once
but wait and listen to the conversation between the bathing orcs.

STOUT ORC: When asked for your pass, GIVE PARCHMENT, then when you've been
given the all-clear go S, S, W, S, to the overgrown hollow. If smeagol
vanishes on the way, don't worry as he should reappear with something
useful: "a plump young coney".

OVERGROWN HOLLOW:
 When you arrive, GO FISHING, provided you're carrying the length of line.
If sam has it then SAY TO SAM "GO FISHING" and repeat if necessary until
you catch something. If you WAIT then Faramir should appear, causing 
Smeagol to run off.

FARAMIR: When he asks what you are, SAY TO FARAMIR "HOBBITS" and he should
be pleased to see you. When he leaves you should continue waiting until
he returns and gives you some rations, then SAY TO FARAMIR "THANKS".
However, while you are waiting you may encounter...

AN ENRAGED OLIPHANT: If this turns up while you're waiting at the overgrown
hollow, simply going north, waiting and returning south should cause it to
go away again.

PLUMP YOUNG CONEY: This is a young rabbit, very tasty to eat, but it has to
be cooked first. CUT BRANCH WITH SWORD until you get a pile of twigs,
then DROP TWIGS. OPEN BACKPACK, GET PAN, PUT CONEY IN PAN, GET SALT,
SPRINKLE SALT ON CONEY, PUT SALT IN BACKPACK, OPEN MATCHBOX (or SAY TO SAM
"OPEN MATCHBOX"), GET MATCH, LIGHT MATCH, MAKE FIRE, PUT PAN ON FIRE,
EXAMINE PAN, GET PAN and finally EAT RABBIT until it's all gone. Then put
the pan back in the pack and close the pack up.

WATERFALL: You now need to meet up with Smeagol again so go to the waterfall
location and GO WATERFALL before going SE to meet Smeagol. When he tells
you he's hungry just give him the fish you caught earlier, and SAY TO 
SMEAGOL "EAT FISH" (some people can't work anything out for themselves).
Now go back through the waterfall to the Dark Shadowed highway (south of
the waterfall).

DARK SHADOWED HIGHWAY: Keep an eye open for Black Riders and remember to 
stay still if they are present. Go E, SE to the pale white bridge, then go
NE and WAIT until Frodo starts acting strangely and heads east. Once he's 
done that, go up the Twisted Staircase (N, U, W, U, E) to meet the
Red-Eyed Wolf.

RED-EYED WOLF: To be allowed to pass safely, SAY TO SAM "DROP BREAD" and
when the wolf has eaten it go NE to the entrance to the Yawning black tunnel.

YAWNING BLACK TUNNEL: Go east into the tunnel and HOLD OUT CRYSTAL to provide
light. Make your way through tunnels be going S, SE, NE then CUT WEB WITH 
SWORD and go no S, NE, NE, E. At this point you should hear a voice coming
from a Cocoon, so EXAMINE COCOON and GET COCOON before going north and
south-east to the narrow Tunnel mouth.

SPIDER/NARROW TUNNEL MOUTH: Somewhere during your travels through the tunnels
you should have met the spider, and as soon as you do just type in the word
GALADRIEL to send it scuttling off. The spider should now be waiting to the
east, so SAY TO SAM "GO EAST AND ATTACK SPIDER WITH SWORD", then WAIT and
go east yourself to meet (fingers crossed) a live Sam and a dead spider.
Then go north and west to the Sturdy Iron door.

STURDY IRON DOOR: Here you can CUT COCOON WITH SWORD and then WAIT until
a platoon of Orcs appears and rushes through the door.

RESTING: You should do this regularly to keep your strength up, and don't
forget to SAY TO SAM "REST" and SAY TO SMEAGOL "REST".

EATING: EAT when you're carrying the bread, or EAT RATIONS when carrying the
rations. Do this fairly regularly too. Sam will follow your example without
being told, but smeagol will only eat fish which is why you must catch one
at the overgrown hollow. Note that there are several fish: slippery ones, 
ugly ones etc.

BOX OF SOIL WITH MAGICAL PROPERTIES: Sam carries this around, but as to its
purpose....?

Note that there are other locations, other characters and other routines.
This is just one of several ways of getting through the game.
