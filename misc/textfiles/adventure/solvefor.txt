NOW BE IN THE UPPER ELEVATOR WHERE YOU NEED TO: 'SLIDE UPPER CARD

    NOW, KEEP [WAITING]

UNTIL THE ELEVTOR DOOR OPENS UP. THEN: S,NE, POUR LIQUID IN HOLE,
SW,N, SLIDE UPPER CARD THROUGH SLOT, PUSH DOWN BUTTON, ['WAIT'

BY NOW, SO LET'S GET TO BED!...TRY: SW,N, SLIDE UPPER CARD
THROUGH SLOT, PUSH DOWN BUTTON, (WAIT...), S,W,W,N, GET IN BED,
SLEEP (YOU MAY NEED TO WAIT A MOVE OR TWO).


    NOW, IN MY EARLY VERSION, THERE'S A BUG THAT TAKES ALL OF THE
ITEMS THAT YOU AREN'T WEARING AND PUTS THEM IN THE ROOM OUTSIDE
YOUR BED. THEY ALSO AREN'T VISIBLE UNLESS YOU 'LOOK' OR GO OUT OF
THE ROOM AND RE-ENTER. F YOU FIND YOU'RE MISSING YOUR ACCESS
CARDS, THEY ARE RIGHT THERE IN THE ROOM NEXT TO THE BUNK. OK, NOW
ON TO THE OTHER COMPLEX! (YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAVE THE GAME AGAIN!)
GET UP, (LOOK AND GET YOUR CARDS IF YOU NEED TO), S,W,S, GET
CANTEEN, OPEN CANTEE , SLIDE KITCHEN CARD THROUGH SLOT, DROP

NE,N,N,N, EAT RED GOO, E,N.

    NOW, THE NEXT THING YOU NEED IS THE LOWER ELEVATOR ACCESS
ARD. FLOYD HAS IT, BUT THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT FROM HIM IS TO BE
IN THE UPPER ELEVATOR WITH HIM AND KEEP SAYING 'SLIDE UPPER CARD
THROUGH SLOT'. EVENTUALLY, HE WILL SHOW YOU HIS CARD, AT WHICH
POINT YOU SHOULD 'GET LOWER CARD'. THEN YOU SHOULD: S, PUSH RED
BUTTON, DROP UPPER CARD, (WAIT UNTIL THE ELEVATOR OPENS), S,
SLIDE LOWER CARD THROUGH SLOT, PUSH DOWN BUTTON, DROP LOWER CARD,
WAIT UNTIL DOOR OPENS), N,E, S,E.

    YOU SHOULD NOW BE IN THE SHUTTLE. ALFIE CONTROL EAST, TO BE
EXACT. THIS LITTLE HONEY WILLTAKE YOU TO THE LAWANDA COMPLEX ON
THE OTHER ISLAND. THE SHUTTLE CONTROLS ARE VERY SIMPLE. THE LEVER
CONTINUALLY ACCELERATES THE SHUTTLE WHEN IN THE UP POSITION. IT
MAINTAINS CURRENT SPEED WHEN IN THE MIDDLE POSITION AND DE
CELERATES THE SHUTTLE WHEN IN THE DOWN POSITION. TO ACTIVATE THE
CONTROLS, INPUT: SLIDE SHUTTLE CARD THROUGH SLOT, DROP SHUTTLE
CARD, PUSH LEVER UP.

    OK, NOW KEEP HITTING 'L' AND YOU'LL NOTICE YOUR SPEED
INCREASING EACH TIME IN INCREMENTS OF 5. KEEP HITTING 'L' UNTIL
YOUR SPEED HIT 55 MPH. (NEVER MIND THE SIGN YOU SEE). THEN, 'PULL
LEVER DOWN'. IT WILL NOW BE IN THE MIDDLE POSITION AND YOU WILL
BE STEADY AT 55 MPH. SOON YOU WILL SEE A SIGN MARKING  THE
HALFWAY POINT. WHEN YOU SEE IT, HIT 'L' ONE MORE TIME, THEN INPUT
'PULL LEVER DOWN'. THE SHUTTLE WILL DECELERATE (IGNORE THE SPEED
LIMIT SIGNS) AND SHOULD STOP RIGHT WHEN  YOU'VE ENTERED THE
LAWANDA STAION! (THIS IS ANOTHER GOOD TIME TO SAVE THE GAME!).


    OK, NOW TO FINISH FIXING THE REST OF THE SYSTEMS AND FINISH
THE GAME. NOT E>>> SOMETIME BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE GAME
(DEPENDING UPON HOW LONG IT TOOK FLOYD TO GIVE YOU THE LOWER
CARD), YOU WILL GET  HUNGRY. WHEN YOU DO, JUST 'DRINK LIQUID' AND
DISCARD THE CANTEEN. O.K., FROM ALFIE CONTROL EAST GO: W,N,U
,U,NE,N, TELL FLOYD TO GO NORTH, TELL FLOYD TO GET SHINY BOARD,
S,E,N, OPEN PANE L, REMOVE SECOND BOARD, INSERT SHINY BOARD IN

    OK, THE PLANETARY DEFENSES ARE REPAIRED! NEXT: S,E,N, OPEN
LID, REMOVE FUSED BEDISTOR WITH PLIERS, INSERT GOOD BEDISTR IN
CUBE, DROP FUSED BEDISTOR AND PLIERS.

    COURSE CONTROL IS FIXED! NOW GO: S,S,S,S.

    YOU SHOULD NOW BE IN THE COMPUTER ROOM. YOU MUST NOW WAIT
UNTIL FLOYD ENTERS
 AND NOTICES THAT THE COMPUTER IS BUSTED. THEN: NE, OPEN BIO-LOCK DOOR,SE,E,
LOOK IN WINDOW.

    FLOYD SHOULD NOW BE WITH YOU AND THE BRAVE LITTLE SOUL WILL
SEE THE MINIATURIZATION CARD IN THE LAB AND WILL VOLUNTEER TO GET
