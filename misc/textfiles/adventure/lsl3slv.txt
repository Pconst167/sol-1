faithfully by The Timelord and Low Rider... As you may know, we are the main
support boards for a new organization, GPA. I would like to take the time to
thank WCA for copying our release of Leisure Suit Larry 3, it is soo nice to
log onto a BBS and find LSL3S1.ZIP, then unzip it and see things like:
WCAPLUG.ANS, and INTRO.WCA, umm, yeah guys, real original. Well I am sure you
all will probably want to edit this doc file to change it to the WCA Game 
Solve for Leisure Suit Larry 3, well just to set the record straight...

   Leisure Suit Larry 3 came out in the stores Friday Nov. 3rd, 1989. We had 
it on our boards not 30 minutes after it came out. We also had it sent to 
approximately 20 boards during the weekend. Since there are only 3 of us, and 
at this time none of us have USR HST's, well it kinda takes awhile to send 2.4 
megs to EACH AND EVERY BBS... Now, FiRM supposidly has a crack on this, I 
havent seen it, YET, but knowing FiRM's rep, I am sure that they didnt steal 
our files. However, this game solve can be used with the FiRM release...

    Also to set the record straight on some other Sierra stuff, Codename 
ICEMAN is not out yet, and it will not be out until December, we got this 
straight from Sierra itself, so for those people who are saying "I saw it, 
honest dude!"... Well, prove that it exists..

    I would also like to take this time and say thank you to Nightmare for 
showing us what a complete idiot you are. Of course we are a NEW GROUP, and 
are not that established, but we are here to stay, and with time, hopefully, 
we will be as big (or close to it) as some of these other organizations...
Its just right now we dont have the members for this. If you have to be such 
an immature idiot as to not give a starting group a chance, you should be 
shot.

    As far as GPA goes, we are VERY VERY SMALL, but always looking for 
members. If you wish to be a member of GPA, contact either myself (timelord), 
or Low Rider at one of the two GPA boards:

The Tardis GPA Hq [9O4]376-1117          BadLands [9O4]336-6608

And even if you dont want to be a member of GPA, you should call our boards 
anyways, since we have alot to offer...

Now, on to the history of Larry 3...

The Larry series, as most of you probably know, is unlike most games. It's 
more of a "Pornographic Sex Adventure" where you are the bumbling Larry 
Laffer, on his never ending quest for pussy. This one is quite unique however 
since you are TWO characters, Larry, and Passionate Patti (Larry's beloved?)..
About halfway through the game you will switch into Patti.... I wont go into 
that now.. There is one part to note, there will be a set of commands called 
"LEI COMMANDS", they are shortened and are the following set of instructions:
Go to cave by Chip-n-Dales
Enter cave
Save game
go to edge of cliff
get flowers
make lei
exit cave
go back to whatever you were doing before..Since we had to finish this game 
with these commands like 5 times due to flowers wilting, well...

Also, you can beat the 4000 point score, we finished it with 4337 today 
(Tuesday, Nov. 7th). Well, now I am going to let someone take over here to get 
started on the typing here...

GPA, Sometimes the first, Always the Best...
