Flunky - Partial Solution (Don Priestley and Vampiro)
-----------------------------------------------------

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME
The plot, as I remember it, had something to do with you being a mad keen 
autograph hunter who had taken a job at the palace in order to get the 
autographs off of all the royal family. You're carrying you're autograph book at 
the start of the game (it's the red thing with a big A on the front) and you 
must put it in front of each royal family member after completing the task(s) 
that they set out for you.

LIGHTING THE FIRES
What you're asked to do at the start of the game, simply walk up to the empty 
fireplaces while carrying the matchbox (which you have in your possesion at the 
start of the game). You start in a corridor that contains three doors, Andy and 
Fergy are behind the first door, Charles and Di the second, and the Queen the 
third. You can enter the the first two doors in any order but you can't leave 
until you have lit the fires (there are two fires in both the couple's rooms and 
one in the Queens) and completed the tasks given to you. You cannot enter the 
Queen's room until you have completed all the tasks set by her sons and their 
(ex)wives.
N.B. `Flunky' is a *VERY* fiddly game, and timing is all important. You're 
advised to make heavy use of the `Save' feature on your emulator in order to 
carry out the tasks set out below.

THE GUARDS
The guards will occasionally try to shoot you after you've completed certain 
tasks in the game, if you're in Andy's and Fergy's apartment simply hide in the 
secret passage to get rid of the guard. If you're in Charles and Di's pad you'll 
need to outrun the guard or keep avoiding his gun blasts (he'll give up after 
about four shots).

ANDY
Wants a boat to play with in the bath, DON'T give him the purple boat as he'll 
get the guard to shoot you. Get the remote control from the table next to Fergy 
then go to the room at the far right of the apartment that has a small arrow 
painted on the wall, the wall should slide back to reveal a secret panel. Now go 
left to the room that has `pictures' of two boats and a helicopter on the wall, 
whilst still carrying the remote cotrol, press fire, the helicopter will take 
off from wall. Now, attempt to position the chopper over the small boat on the 
left side of the wall, it _should_ pick the boat up and bring it down to ground 
level. Pick up the boat and enter the secret passage. Keep following the passage 
until you come to a lever which you should raise to it's highest point (by 
constantly pressing the forward key), now go down until you come to a room with 
some green `water' in it. Go left and you'll find a room with a skeleton and an 
open portcullis in it, go through it (it will immediatly shut behind you) and 
you should find a boat, part submerged in the water, pick it up and put it in 
the middle of the green stream. Now walk up to the skeleton and keep pressing 
the forward key, you'll start to `yank it' and the portcullis will begin to 
rise, yank 13 times and quickly go back through the portcullis (it's hard but it 
CAN be done) then go left to another room with a green stream in it. There's a 
bomb in this stream pick it up and pocket if for later, then put the small boat 
that you got off the wall in the middle of the stream it should drive off to the 
right pushing the boat that you moved previously to the accesable room on the 
right. So get the boat and retrace your steps back to Andy.

FERGY
Has lost her freckles, you'll need the box of red make-up (on the towel rail 
next to Andy) and the bomb (mentioned previously). Put the make-up on the floor 
opposite Fergy and the bomb as close as you possibly can to the fire, it should 
turn red. Now get the matches and walk up to the bomb as if you were lighting a 
fire, the bomb will start to flash, now quickly drop the bomb in the makeup and 
put the makeup on the table next to Fergy, it should explode all over her face. 
N.B. This will not work if Fergy is covering her face with the mirror at the 
time, you have to judge it perfectly.

CHARLES
Has lost his polo balls which can be found bouncing around in the three rooms 
next to him, get the springs (found in same room as Charles) and bounce the 
balls back into Chaz's room one by one. Once you've done this Charles will ask 
you to place the balls, put them as near to his horse as possible trying to keep 
them roughly central, he'll hit them all out of the room (he'll occasionally 
mis-swing but that's just a random factor - be patient). Finally, Charles will 
hit all the balls into the guard, who'll come straight after you, so get ready 
to run !!

DIANA
Has lost her hair, get the gun from the table next to her and take it to the 
room with Charles in, walk to the bottom of the screen and shoot (stand still 
whilst holding the gun then press either the left or right key to fire the gun) 
at the creature sitting on the mantle-piece, it should come to life and start 
flying round the room. You now need to get this creature to sit on Di's head, 
keep shooting it's left wing in order to get it to move right through the rooms 
that had previously contained Charle's balls, then shoot it in the middle of 
it's body when it's directly over Di's head. The guard will, unfortunately, try 
to shoot you every time you shoot the gun in Di's room so you'll need to be very 
careful. If you do it right you should only have to fire the gun in Di's room 
twice.

THE QUEEN
Want's her Corgi's back, a sausage can be found in the kitchen (if you avoid the 
cook) which the dogs will eat, but nothing seems to happen when they do so. You 
seem to be able to get an almost infinte number of sausages (a new one appears 
in the kitchen every time the dogs eat one).

The problem with the dogs is ,that they don't occur near the queen. you need
to use the sausages as a bait. Personally I went to that room with a counter
and lay the sausage on the floor. When the dog wanted to eat it I quickly take
it back and went towards the throne room. The dog followed me. I left the sausage
there and went for the second one...
