  this is probably the best infocom text adventure yet, don't ruin you're 
 adventure by cheating with this sheet, just use this in emergencies!

 note: these are the commands needed to solve the leviathan ver. of the game
 characters: the diver (you) - supposedly an expert diver, who, just like 
everyone else on the island is waiting for his ship to come in.. 
             johnny red - the pirate leader. proud, but not a backstabber, 
makes a good leader on the quest
             pete the rat - the cook on the ship, one-eyed and fairly trust-
worthy also.
             the weasel - the name says it all, works in a plot to reap the 
benefits of the expedition all by himslef. little backstabber.
             mcginty - the owner of mcginty's salvage. disgusting habits, self
-ish and unsure.. 'asshole'
             other characters - just fill in the other needed roles, can be 
asked questions, but don't always answer...
             -get yourself a copy of the docs. re-written by the i.c. of trade
