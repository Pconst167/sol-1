DANTE'S INFERNO - THE SOLUTION
------------------------------

In the wood go east, get the offering (it's black) and the rope (it's a black), then enter in the cave. 

In front of the river, use the offering to get on the Caronte's boat. Wait until the boat stops then go into the first circle. 

To avoid the Demon with the whip let him follow you to the far east of the circle, then run to west, south and east, When you arrive under Minosse's tail, go south. (Don't worry for the red object near him: it's a red herring!)

In the second circle, avoid the lustfuls and look for the torch (it's violet). Get it then go south. 

In the third circle, avoid the two black dogs and search the path to leave the circle. Go south.

In the fourth circle, avoid the giant rolling weights pushed by horders and spendthrifts. Look for the horn (it's yellow): you can carry only 2 objects, so to take the horn you must leave the rope, but remember where you leave it. Go south.

In the marsh of the fifth circle, avoid the hands and reach the tower, to south. Drop the torch then come back to get the rope where you have left it. Return to the tower and drop the rope to get the torch again. Use the torch and wait until the Flegiàs Boat comes. Drop the torch, get the rope and go on the boat. 

Leave the boat when you arrive to the other side of the river Go south and wait for Medusa. DON'T GO EAST, or you'll be petrified! Use the horn until the angel arrives. He protects you from the Medusa's glance (when he is between you and her), so you can cross the gates of Dis going east and soth. (Leave the horn.)

In the sixth circle avoid the demons and go west and south to reach the next circle. If you want you can get the crucifix (it's white): it destroys the demons near you. 

In the seventh circle avoid the two black dogs (again!) and go east and south two find the way to the "burning sand". 

In the burning sand avoid the fires and look for the portion of the south wall without the flames. Here you can use the rope to descend into the eight circle (use it until Gerione comes).

In the eight circle (ten groups of different sinners) avoid the demons and find the way to the ninth circle going west, south, east, south, west, south, west, south, east, south, west, south, east, south, east, south, west, south, east, south. (Get and use the crucifixes if you think you need them.)

In the ninth and last circle (a lake of ice) avoid the hands and go west to reach Lucifer. When you are in front of him, go north inside him and... you see once more the stars! :-))
