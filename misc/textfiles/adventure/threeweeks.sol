                           THREE WEEKS IN PARADISE
                          =========================


  Instructions:
 ---------------

Another Wally Week game, following  on from Automania, Pyjamarama, Everyone's a
Wally, and Herberts Dummy Run...

This time Wally's really done it...  Deciding to go on holiday, he takes  Wilma
and Herbert to a deserted isle, as advertised by Costa Del Cheapo holiday firm.
It  seemed  nice  and  cheap,  and  the  literature  said that the natives were
friendly, and in fact it was  such  a  nice  place, nobody had ever bothered to
come back...

Well.  Wilma kidnapped by the Chief Tribesman, hanging by her feet, and Herbert
the main course at a celebratory dinner.  Wally's got his work cut out for  him
this time, and no mistake...

Do you need a handbag to crocodile rock?  That priest may be hot stuff, but how
do  you get his attention?  Is it co-incidence that corkscrew, coconut & cookie
all begin with the same  letter,  and  yet  blunt axe doesn't?  Are the bellows
more than just a load of hot air?  Am I giving the game away?  Yes.


  Hints & Cheats:
 -----------------

To  gain  infitite  lives  on Three Weeks in Paradise wait until Wally has been
knocked down.  When the  stars  start  revolving  round  his head quickly press
Symbol Shift, D and P.

  To rescue Wilma:

First of all get the Mint from the sign  outside  the  Trading  Post  then  get
Wilma's  Handbag  from the beach, to get to the beach go through the picture in
the room that contains the  table.   As  long  as  you have the Handbag in your
possession the crocodile will not harm you.  Go to the screen with the Ice Cube
in it and press the Action key.  Now pick up the Hole and go  right  until  you
are just past the crocodile, now drop the Handbag.  Take the Gold Fish Bowl and
the  Hole  to  the Wishing well screen, stand at the far left of the screen and

the spider will not move as long as you have the Bowl.  Go through the  picture
again  and into the sea, pass over the locker and the door will open.  Take the

are in the same room as the big  bird.  With the Egg and the Spinach proceed to
the room that contains the sign 'Old Faithful', now pull the rope  and  run  to
the  water.   Jump  up the geyser.  Jump into the nest and swap the Spinach for
the Bow and Arrows.  Now drop  down  and  drop  the  Egg. Go to the screen that
contains Wilma and shoot the native with the  Bow  and  Arrows.Proceed  to  the
screen  with  the  well  in it and jump down.  Go to the centre of the well and
press the Action key.  Take the bottle and  climb out of the screen by going to
the right of the screen and keeping the Action key depressed.  With the  Bottle

them to the room with the Totem  pole  in  it.  Now pass over the white man and
press the Action key.Should you have the bellows the cloud will move away  from
you,  so make sure you are standing to the right of it.  When the cloud reaches
the hut collect the Shell.   Now  take  the  Shell  down the well and press the

the Geyser, pull the rope, and run to the water to fill the can.  Go  and  find
the  Flipflops  and take them along with the full Billy Can to the beach.  Just
as you pass the crab press the Actionkey.   Now collect the Claw and take it to

screen.  Go to the geyser screen and do the same as did when freeing Wilma, but
instead of being sucked up the billy can will be filled in.  Goto the screen on
the  right  og  the geyser and onto the quicksand, the flip-flops stop you from
sinking.  Stand in front of the creb and use the billy can.  Pick up the crab's
