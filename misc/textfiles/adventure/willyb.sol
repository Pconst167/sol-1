	The Advantures of Willy Beamish
	===============================

Day 1

	Horny will 'attack' the principle during the assembly. After that,
	you will be in the classroom with Ms Glass. Don't let Horny 'attack'
	her if you want to carry on with the game. (You can try it out for
	some fun). Willy should pretend to have a stomach upset to get away
	from the teacher, but when the nurse question you, say it's alright.

	Back in classroom. You can choose to be a good boy and sit down to
	write your compositon until the class is over. You will miss some
	of the fun if you did this. The alternative method (recommended) is
	to sneak out of the classroom when the teacher fall asleep. (zzz...Z)
	But before that, make sure you click on your table and get the piece
	of wood and crayons. When you are outside the classroom, the coach 
	will stop you and demand a hall pass. Click on yourself to bring up
	the inventory. Click on the white crayon and on the piece of wood,
	this will write the word 'Hall Pass' on it. Click on the Hall Pass
	and move it outside the inventory, this will clear the inventory
	window. Give the Hall Pass to the coach. Go to toilet. Inside the
	toilet, Spider will demand something from you. Give him the game
	buddies. You are now free to leave the school. From now on school
	is over.

	Outside Willy's house. If you are early, you will be able to get
	the letter the principle sent to your parent. (You must sneak
	out the classroom to be able to do this) Get letter. Go inside
	house. Go to kitchen. Talk to mother. Bring Brianna to the swing
	and don't swing too hard. Mother will force you to cut the carrots
	and in the process you will cut your finger. Go upstairs and enter
	the bathroom. Press TAB to toggle the active area in the room. You
	will see an arrow pointing at one of the cupboard. Click on it to
	bring up the first aid box. Apply the iodine and then the plaster.
	Go back to your room and play Nintari. You can't do it unless your
	thumb is properly treated. 

	Go to the dining room for dinner. Be a good boy and give the letter
	to your father. He will get angry and give your Nintari key to
	your sister for save keeping. After dinner, go upstairs. Mother will
	ask you to bring the conditioner to your sister. Go to Brianne room,
	help her to get back to bed (this might occur randomly) and this 
	will make the game easier. Go to bathroom. You will see the 
	conditioner and Nintari key on the table. There are a few way to 
	get the key form your sister. Firstly, you can used your frog on 
	her. This will scarce the hell out of her and you can take the key 
	and walk away. Secondly, you can get her diary from her room and 
	then used it on her. She will give up and let you have the key. 
	(This is not recommended, the diary have other purposes as well).  
	Go back to your room and unlock the Nintari system with the key.
	Play a few round and then go to bed.
