                   Basic Detective Skills
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

About The Colonel's Bequest:

Colonel's  Bequest is  a PLAY  divided into  8 "acts." There are
several tasks you MUST accomplish in  each act to cause the play
to progress.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

How to progress through the "acts":

In  every act  there are  certain tasks  you must  accomplish in
order for the play to progress to the next act.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

How to "spy" on  people and find  out what's really  going on
behind  those closed  doors? Everytime  I walk  into a  room and
interrupt a conversation, the people stop talking!

Push on  either armoire upstairs  to move it.  Discover a secret
room. You are able to peek through the eyeholes of the portraits
to spy on  anyone in the bedrooms. Do  this often throughout the
play. Downstairs, push on the Grandfather Clock or the mirror to
eavesdrop on conversations.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

How to closely examine the items you've found. What to use to
yourself:

A real  detective is never  without a magnifying  glass! You can
find  a monocle  on Wilbur's  dead body  and use  it to  examine
evidence in much the same way.
