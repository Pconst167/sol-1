   NEUROMANCER Solution by Siamak

The following is just one way of going through the game. Of course there are
many variations on the theme.

Start| When you wake up in Ratz restaurant use the PAX. Read the messages. They
will give you some useful info to start with. Download all your credits.
(Always carry all your money with you. I will tell you why later).
Pay your bill, you don't want to get arrested right at the start.

Getting money| You saw a message on PAX from a certain General Armitage. Send
him a message with your ID # (Type:BAMA ID 056306118).
If you check your account, you will find 10000 credits, courtesy of Armitage.
(Remember to download them all)
He also left a message to meet him outside Matrix Restaurant. Go there.
You will never get to meet Armitage but you get arrested when you go to the
rendezvous point.

NOTE: Whenever you get arrested and brought to court do this:

1) Never pay the lawyer fee.
2) Always plea guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court. This way
   you never get death penalty. You only get fined.

Whenever you get fined (and it goes up with each additional offense) it will
be deducted from your bank account (on PAX), not from what you are carrying.
That's why I said carry all of your cash with you. Each time you upload credits
to PAX and you have fines outstanding, they will be deducted from your account.
The only danger in carrying your money is that if you die by some misfortune
and get revived at the Body Shop, you will lose all your money. But with usual
precautions (saving game before trying something new) that shouldn't happen.
Later you will find a safe place to put your money.

Do Armitage trick as many times as you can. I don't know how many times you can
do it. I did it twice and that was enough to complete the game. You will find
more money as you go on.
By the way, try not to sell your body parts. If you have to sell to raise cash,
buy them back as soon as you can afford it. You will need all your strength in
Cyberspace.
(In case you are very desperate for money, you can edit your disk to get it. I
will give the necessary info at the end. But try not to use it. It spoils the
game.)

Next go to Shin's Pawn Shop and get your UXB deck. You can start calling
databases using your deck and Comlink 1.0 software and a few link codes you got
from the messages on PAX.
Calling databases is an important part of the game. You will get all kinds of
information off them. You need link codes and passwords to call.
Some of them you get off other DBs, some from the people you meet. By the way
some boards let you get on the first level. It's the higher levels you have to
find passwords for. And there are some levels (DBs as well) you can get to only
in Cyberspace. There are no passwords (or link codes) for them.
Some words you have to decode. If you are unable to decode a word, you need to
upgrade your Cryptology skill.
Some DBs require higher versions of the Comlink for connection.
You also need a Cyberspace jack. They are located at different places. For the
moment use the one at Gentleman Loser or Cheap Hotel.
Later I will give a complete list of DBs and passwords.

Skills: You will need to buy skill chips and then upgrade them.
I figured you will need about 25000 credits to get all the skills and upgrade
them to limit. But you don't have to get them all at once. For the early stage
of the game in Chiba City you only need Cryptology, Coptalk, Musiancianship,
Bargaining, Software analysis and maybe Debug and Hardware repair.

Now let's explore Chiba City. I will tell you what to ask people and what you
can get at each location. The things you can ask a character you will find at
different places. The game doesn't necessarily proceed in the order given.

Massage Parlor: Tell the girl you want to buy info. You can buy five of them.
(You will get arrested and fined each time, but be persistent)

Microsofts: Ask Larry Moe about SEA, Matrix, Cyberspace, ROM, ROM Constructs,
Coptalk, Skill, Chip, Fuji, Police, Comlink, Code.
Some answers will be repetitive. Buy Coptalk skill. Implant it.
At the back room of Microsofts is the Panther Moderns HQ. You can't get to it
yet.

Donut World (near Body Shop): Use Coptalk skill to imitate a cop. You will get
a few link codes and passwords (some coded). Later when you get your Coptalk
skill upgraded visit again. You will get some more bits of info.

Gentleman Loser: Ask Shiva about Cryptology (a message on PAX told you to pick
it up here, remember?), Chip, Skill, Bargaining, Pshycoanalysis, Phenomenology,
Philosophy, Teach, Upgrade, Train, Instruct, ROM, ROM Construct, Software, AI,
Neuromancer, Loser, Wilson, Hitachi, Copenhagen, University, Matrix, Guest,
Pass, Norton, Emperor.
Again some answers are repetitive.
Get Cryptology chip. Buy hardware repair if you can afford it. Get guest pass
for Matrix restaurant.

Julius Dean (across from Maas Biolabs): Ask Julius about: most of what you ask
Shiva at Gentleman Loser,plus these: Screaming Fist, Fuji, IRS, Hosaka, Tozoku,
Musabori, Hitachi, Exotic/Hardware, Wintermute, Tessier-Ashpool.
You will get link codes and passwords. Buy and upgrade skills as much as you
can afford. Buy gas mask.

Now call a few databases. Use the jack in Gentleman Loser. You can't use the
Cheap Hotel until you pay your bill.

Call REGFELLOW. Get passwords. Dowload BattleChess 2.0, Scout 1.0.
Scout lets you find out how many levels a DB has. Otherwise it's not very
useful. To use it, when you connect to a DB and opening screen appears hit "I"
and choose Scout 1.0.

Call ASANOCOMP. Get a few link codes.

Call CHEAPO. Edit your bill on second level or pay it if you prefer.
Order caviar. Edit bill. Go to Cheap Hotel to pick it up.

Call WORLDCHESS. You can play in chess tournament using BattleChess 2.0 and
win a few hundred. Otherwise don't bother.

Call CONSUMEREV only if you have money to burn. It gives a review of all decks.
A very long list.

Now hit the streets again. If you meet Lonny Zone's girl along the way ask her
about: Lonny Zone, Microsofts, Hardware, Software, Hitachi, Justice, Law,
Lawyer, Judge, Cyberspace, Matrix, Massage. Not all of her answers are helpful.

Metro Holographix: Ask Finn about Chip, Skill, Debug, Ice breaking, ROM, ROM
Construct, Holy/Joystick, Software, Neuromancer, Wintermute, Tessier-Ashpool,
AI, Screaming Fist, Pong.
Buy skill chips and joystick. Don't buy any software as you can download all
of the software he has off DBs.

Crazy Edo's: Trade caviar for Comlink 2.0 software. Delete Comlink 1.0. (When
you get a higher version of Comlink delete the old one. You don't need it).
Don't buy any decks here. You get them cheaper at Asano Computing.

Asano Computing: Here you can buy better decks or ask about different decks.
He will tell you which ones are Cyberspace capable. You don't need a Cyberspace
deck yet.
If you bad mouth Crazy Edo you will get some discount.
The best non-Cyberspace decks are Ninja 3000 and Edokko, the best Cyberspace
ones are Ninja 5000, Samurai Seven and Cyberspace VII. Any one of them will do.

House of Pong: Listen to the ramblings of the monk and you will find what he
wants. Give him joystick and get Zen and Sophistry chips in return.

Matrix Restaurant (need guest pass to enter): Ask Norton about Anonymous/Bosch,
Matt Shaw, ROM/Construct, Dixie, Skill, Chip, Upgrade, Teach, Train, any skill
by name, Password, Loser, ESFA, NASA, AI.
Buy and upgrade skills as much as you can or come back later. Note all the
passwords you get.

Now go back to Cheap Hotel and call databases.

Call CHAOS. Get Comlink 3.0. Read messages. You will get quite a few hints.

Call FUJI. You will find Larry Moe is a consultant. Note his ID number.

Call HITACHIBIO, PSYCHO, IRS if you like. Not much of interest here.

Call BRAINSTORM. Read messages. You will find out which ICE breakers are best.

Call SOFTEN. Get Comlink 4.0. Upgrade Coptalk skill. Get Sequenser 1.0.
Sequencer 1.0 is used to find password of any DB (first level only). Use it
the same way as Scout 1.0. Use it on any board you don't have password for.
On some bases this is the only way to get in.
(After upgrading Coptalk visit Donut World again).

Call KEISATSU (Tactical Police). On second level edit the warrant list and put
in Larry Moe's name and ID. He vanishes (presumably arrested) and you can get
to Panther Moderns in the back room of his shop.

Panther Moderns: Ask Lupus about Sense/Net, Security/Pass, ROM/Construct, Chip,
Skill, Evasion, Bank, GemeinSchaft, Tozoku, any skill by name, Upgrade etc.,
Software, Easy Rider, Wilson, Hitachi, AI, Fuji, Hosaka, Musabori, Matrix,
Guest pass, Restaurant, Cyberspace.
He will give you a bank account number to get money from. Buy evasion chip and
security pass if you can afford it or wait until later.

Back to Cheap Hotel and calling databases.

Call LOSER. Read messages. You get a code for cracking bank. Download software:
Probe 3.0 and Hammer 1.0 on level 2.

Call FREEMATRIX if you like. You can't download any software. They are phony.
And don't bother with Blammo 1.0. (A message on LOSER warned you about this).
It's a Trojan horse. When you fire Blammo at ICE in Cyberspace, it rebounds and
hits you.

Call EASTSEABOD. Get Comlink 5.0. Read messages.

Call YAKUZA. Get Comlink 6.0, Blowtorch 1.0 and Decoder 1.0.

Call MUSABORIND and VOYAGER. Nothing of interest here.

Call JUSTTICE. You have to use Sequencer to get on. Nothing of interest anyway.

If you have survived by now, it's time to get some more money.

Call HOSAKACORP. Upload Comlink 6.0 to their library and you will get 7500
credits. (Can do this only once).
On level 2 edit the employee list and add your name and ID number. Then you can
go to Hosaka office and collect weekly paycheck of 10000.
You can do this every 7 days by game clock, which is about 6 hours of real
time. (If you don't pause the game).

Call BOZOBANK. Use Sequencer to get in. Open an account. Account number will be
712345450134.

Call BANKGEMEIN. On second level transfer fund from account 646328356481 to the
acount you opened at BOZOBANK. You get 30000 this way.

Call BOZOBANK and get money if you need. By the way this is the safe place to
keep all your dough, immune from court fines and the butcher at Body Shop.

These are all the databases you can call. Now go to Asano Computing and buy the
best Cyberspace deck you can and also buy/upgrade all remaining skills.
You should still have a few thousands credits left.

A few other places you can visit. You have already been to company offices in
the High Tech part of Chiba City when you collected your paycheck. Tell the
security computer you work for Hosaka to get in. You can't get into the offices
if you enter as a volunteer to sell yourlungs (and you don't want to do that
anyway).
There is a Cyberspace jack in each office. Also in Sense/Net office you can get
a ROM. (You have to have a security pass). You get ROM numbers from a DB in
Cyberspace. So come back for it later.

Maas Biolabs: You can't get in there until late in the game. When you unlocked
the door and turned off the alarm from Cyberspace, put on the gas mask and
enter. You can have a CyberEyes chip implanted. It functions the same as a
Cyberspace capable deck. It has more RAM so you can store up to 32 softwares
compared to 25 for best decks.

Zion Cluster and Freeside: From Chiba City airport you can ride a shuttle to
either Zion Cluster or Freeside.

Zion Cluster: Ask the man about Bank/Banking, Wintermute, Gemeinschaft, Music,
Dub, Freeside, Zion and Maelcum.
You get the code for vault in Gemeinschaft bank. Use Musicianship skill and
play music. Play Dub and you will get a free ride to Freeside aboard Maelcum's
spaceship. Keep playing other music and he will pay for your return to Chiba
City.
Ask Maelcum the same questions, but you get pretty much the same answers.

Freeside: Here are the offices of Bank of Bern and Gemeinschaft and Villa
Straylight. Each has a Cyberspace jack. The code to enter vault is BG1066.
Stay away from Villa Straylight as it drains your constitution. You only need
to use the jack in manager's office at bank of Bern. About that later.

Well, That's about all you can do in Chiba City and suburbs. Now it's time to
hit Cyberspace where real fun begins!

But first here is a complete list of databases. They are listed by name, link
code, number of levels ,passwords for each level and the lowest version of
Comlink needed for connection. If password for a level is not given, you can
reach that level through Cyberspace only.

    Database name          Link code   Lvls    Password(s)      Comlink version

Cyberspace

Cyberspace consists of 8 Zones, 0 to 7. Each zone has a number of databases
protected by ICE. Some of them have a resident AI. You enter a database, break
the ICE and kill the AI if any. You should start at Zone 0 which has weakest
ICE and AI and go on in order. After each Zone your skills go up, which you need
to tackle the higher Zone.

Each Zone can be entered at a different Cyberspace jack. You need a Cyberspace
deck (or CyberEyes) and Comlink 6.0 or Cyberspace 1.0 (found later).
The location of jack for each Zone:
Zone 0 - Cheap Hotel
Zone 1 - Gentleman Loser
Zone 2 - Fuji, Hitachi, Hosaka and Musabori offices.
Zone 3 - Bank of Bern
Zone 4 - Sense/Net office.
Zone 5 - Gemeinschaft Bank vault.
Zone 6 - None.
Zone 7 - Villa Straylight

You can get to Zone 6 through Cyberspace only. You will find KGB and Easy Rider
softwares in Zone 3. KGB takes you from any Zone to KGB database in Zone 6.
Easy Rider lets you cross Zone boundaries. After you find it just use the jack
at Cheap Hotel to get to Zone 0 and then use Easy Rider to go to other Zones.

The following are ICE cracking wares:

ICE breakers - Good  : Decoder, Blowtorch, Hammer
               Better: Doorstop, Drill
               Best  : Concrete, DepthCharge, LogicBomb
Interface Corruptors - Slow and Jammies. They jam and slow the firing of the
ICE. Slow is the better one.
Viruses - Injector, Acid, Python, ThunderHead. Unlike other wares they get used
up and you have to get new supplies. Also they have a limited lifetime. If
the effect of a virus runs out (the ICE turns blue) fire another virus.
Injectors are the best.
Shielding - Armorall. Whenever your shield is about to run out, use Armorall to
raise your shield. Armorall 1.0 can be use once, Armorall 2.0 twice and so on.
Carry a few versions.

You start with some basic wares which are enough for Zone 0. As you go on you
will find more powerful wares. Always get rid of lower version when you find
higher version of a program (except for Armorall) or your deck will become
full. Carry six different ICE breakers at any time. Not that you need that many
, but because some might crash during combat.

ICE breaking techniques: When you enter a base just keep hitting "I" so you can
get the maximum number of shots in. Fire in the following sequence:

1) Slow or Jammies (if you have them). Only once.
2) A Virus (if you have them). Fire virus as needed whenever ICE turns blue.
3) Cycle through your ICE breakers from strongest to weakest.
4) Use Armorall as needed to raise shield (if you have them).

You can use Probe to get some info about a DB, but it might cost you one round
of battle. The best way to use it is to fire when you first enter a DB, and
when you get the info exit and then reenter for combat. By the way, always save
the game before entering a new base.

Watch ICE strength bar at right at all times. If it's close to zero and you are
about to be flatlined, don't panic. Continue fighting. Chances are the ICE will
crack before you do.

AI combat: If a base has an AI you have to fight and kill it. AI killing skills
are Logic, Phenomenology, Philosophy and Sophistry.
First use Psychoanalysis to find out what the AI's weakness is.
Then following sequence:

1) Use weakness skill.
2) Rotate among other three skills in a fixed order.
3) Go to step 1.

Whenever you are about to be flatlined (life indicator turns red) use Zen skill
to raise your constitution and then resume battle from where you left it.
Use Evasion skill to get out if situation becomes too hot to handle.

If Psychoanalysis says unknown weakness, try it again. A couple of AIs you can
kill in a special manner explained later.

After finishing one base always exit Cyberspace to repair damage, debug crashed
programs and let your constitution reach maximum again before going on to the
next base. Specially early bases when you don't have powerful wares yet.

The following are complete list of databases found in each Zone. They include
coordinates, name, AI (if any) and what software or item of interest they might
contain. For each base there is also a list of wares in parenthesis which can
be used for cracking the ICE in that base. These are for the first time you
enter a base. Later when you find more powerful wares in higher Zones, you will
find it much easier to crack ICE in lower Zones. I do not claim that these are
the best combinations, they are just the ones I found effective. Experiment
with different combinations to find the best. I recommend going to bases in the
order given, at least in lower Zones.

 This is the final battle. After you break through the ICE, Neuromancer will
 send you to a prison island. Cycle through your skills (Logic, Phenomenology,
 Philosophy and Sophistry) until you are out and back to this DB again.
 Fire Kuang Eleven prg at it, and then cycle through above skills in a fixed
 order until you kill it. I have killed it using many different combinations
 of skills, but this is the most straightforward. Don't forget to use Zen
 skill as needed.

                         Neuromancer Code Wheel

         First, a short explanation of the evolution of code wheels.  The code
wheel is a form of protection against piracy of a particular game.  They first
appeared (to my knowledge) in the Electronic Arts game Amnesia in the form of
a "street index".  The next appearance was much later, in Legacy of the
Ancients, also EA.  The third (and most complicated one) was included in Bards
Tale III.  And, as you may have guessed, the latest use is in Neuromancer. The
first two also included disk protection, but the companies seem to be relying
on just the code wheel for their protection against piracy, as the last two
have had no disk protection whatsoever.  The protection comes when, at certain
points in the game, you will be given a set of two, three or four (depending
on the complexity of the wheel) words or locations or whatever, and, using the
code wheel, you must provide the required answer, or you will not be able to
proceed with that function.  Without the wheel and without altering the
programming of the disk, you are stuck.

         What is a code wheel?  It is two or three concentric paper circles,
each one smaller than the one beneath it, so that only the outer ring of the
larger one(s) shows.  It is on the outer ring that one set of words are
printed.  On the outside edge of the smallest circle can be found the second
set of words. One or several small windows are also cut out of the smallest
circle (and in the case of three wheels, windows may also be cut out of the
middle wheel at random points) so that the requested code numbers or words may
be seen through them.  If there is more than one window, each window will have
its own name printed above or below it.  In the most simple application, the
use would be something like this: the player is given the conditions of A and
B.  He would rotate the code wheel until A on the outer circle lines up with B
on the inner circle and observe the code through through the window.  In the
case of multiple windows, he would have been given A, B, and C, rotated as
before to line up A and B and look through window C for the answer.  Such is
the case with Neuromancer.

         The code wheel in Neuromancer is used to operate the PAX machine
found at various locations throughout the game.  You will be given three
access codes and asked for a verification code.  There are 16 possible A's,
B's and C's.  The codes are broken down into two tables.  The first tables
gives A (outer ring) and B (inner ring), to be cross referenced to each other
to get a position number. This position number will be cross referenced with C
(windows) to give the 3 to 6 digit verification code.  The access codes you
will be given are listed below with THREE LETTERS IN UPPER CASE (usually the
first three, but not always, so I have tried to draw your attention to the
ones that do not have the first three in caps).  These will correspond to the
abbreviations in the tables.  Good luck!
