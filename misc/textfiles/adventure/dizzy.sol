Note: Several objects are useful in this game, but are not vital
to complete the adventure. Just for the record, these are:

CLOVE OF GARLIC - Kills bats
INSECTICIDE - Kills Spiders
BIRD SEED - Kills...er...Birds
PICKAXE - Unblocks tunnel, to get dagger
HARD HAT - Destroys falling stalactites
EMERALD - Drop on yellow statue to enter tomb

There is also the following cheat:
Pause the game and type in NOOTRAC 4571. Dizzy will disappear and
you can move around thr screens using Z and X. Press space to
make Dizzy reappear in your chosen screen.

This Solution was found at the Spectrum Game Database. Don't know
if the cheat works with the C64.
