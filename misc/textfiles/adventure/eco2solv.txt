Problem:
How do I get past customs?
Hint:
Select the passport and immunization card and click them 
to the Custom's Official. If the tutorial has started, do each 
action the game asks you to.  Click on each message to get to the 
next instruction.

Problem:
Where is my immunization card?
Hint:
Your immunization card has slipped down inside your passport. 
Open your inventory and click the hand icon on your passport. You 
will find your card.

Problem:
Where do I find Nicanor?
Hint:
Nicanor, a man from the Ecology Emergency Network, is holding up 
a sign near the customs exit. Click the talk icon  on him or walk 
near him and he'll introduce himself. If you just walk near him, 
you will not get points, but the game will advance.

Problem:
Dad is busy with Nicanor. What do I do next?
Hint:
Explore this screen and the one to the east. Look at everything 
and talk to everyone. Although you don't have to do all of the 
things here to make the game advance, you will learn extra 
information and earn additional points by exploring thoroughly.

Problem:
I see two guys talking behind some crates near the launch. How do 
I get close enough to hear what they're talking about?
Hint:  
The men standing by the crates are employees of Maxim Slaughter, 
the man who bribed the Customs Official. They are talking 
privately, so you will have to sneak up on them. Click the hand 
icon on the crates to climb up and overhear their conversation.

Problem:
How do I get close enough to be heard by the old fisherman?
Hint:
The old fisherman is a little deaf, however, Adam doesn't want to 
walk near his smelly catch. Go west to the first screen and walk 
out on the pier from there.

Problem:
How do I deal with the parrot peddler?
Hint:
The parrot peddler will appear every other time you enter this 
screen and walk in front of the crates. You can buy the parrot 
any time you see him.  Just select money from your inventory and 
click it on the parrot peddler.  After the parrot flies away the 
peddler will leave and not return.

Problem:
How do I stop the litterer?
Hint:
The litterer won't stop. Click the garbage bag icon on his trash 
to clean it up. If you leave the screen and come back, or if you 
are on the pier with the fisherman when you see him, the trash 
will blow away before you can return.  The litterer will be in 
the screen every other time you go there, so you have more 
chances to get the trash.

Problem:
What do I do with the package Dad has?
Hint:
Click the hand icon on the package and it will open. It's an 
Ecorder, a hand held computer. Once you open the package, the 
Ecorder is in your inventory.  Dad will give you a demonstration 
of how to use it. If you forget how to use it, there is a 
complete description and diagram in "Adam's Eco News," your game 
documentation.

Problem:
What do I do with the Ecorder?
Hint:
Select the Ecorder from inventory. Go to the next screen and run 
the Ecorder cursor over the launch where gas is leaking. The 
Ecorder cursor lights up when something is found. Click the 
Ecorder cursor while it is lit up and you will get a message that 
it is recording. Go into your inventory and click the inventory 
hand icon on the Ecorder. Then you can turn the Ecorder on and go 
to the screen that contains the information on "River Traffic," 
the item you recorded. If you have trouble using the Ecorder, 
your game documentation called "Adam's Eco News" has a complete 
description and a diagram. Remember to use the Ecorder on every 
screen. You get a point each time you record a fact and it makes 
some of the puzzles easier to solve. You will get extra points 
the first time you successfully take the Ecorder quiz. You can 
take the quiz as many times as you like. Now walk back to Dad.

Problem:
What do I do with the otters?
Hint:
Click the talk icon on Orpheus, the shy otter who is hiding in 
the roots, until he comes near the boat. You will have to do this 
two times. Click the hand icon on him to get Forest Heart's gift.

Problem:
Bugs keep biting me! How do I climb the large tree near the campfire?
Hint:
Click the hand icon on the leaf from the pool of sap near the 
canoe. It will be placed in your inventory. If you are bitten by 
the gnats, select the leaf from inventory and click it on Adam. 
The leaf works as insect repellent! Click the hand icon on the 
tree to climb. The gnats will come near you but won't bite.  Keep 
climbing until you get the exit arrow near the top of the screen. 
Click on that spot and you will climb to the next screen.

Problem:
How do I put out the bird's nest fire?
Hint:
Pitcher plants grow in tree tops and hold lots of rain water. 
Climb to the screen above the bird's nest and click the hand icon 
on the pitcher plant to push it over. A stream of water will fall 
down to the screen below. Careful! Be sure to push over the 
correct pitcher plant or someone below will be angry.

Problem:
How do I avoid the hoatzin's terrible smell?
Hint:
Climb down to the screen with the bird's nest and head west. From 
time to time, you will see a hummingbird heading west. Click the 
hand icon to pick some of the purple flowers that the 
hummingbirds are clustering around. The flowers have a strong 
perfume that will protect you from the hoatzin's terrible smell.

Problem:
I have the fragrant flowers but still can't get past the hoatzin!
Hint:
Climb near the stink bird. When you are standing next to him, 
select the flowers and click them on Adam. Adam will hold them 
over his nose. Click the hand icon on the far pitcher plant and 
Adam will walk over and tip it over.

Problem:
I can't get past the snake!
Hint:
You must help the toucans before the snake will leave. After 
helping the toucans, climb down to see the baby bird hatch. A 
drum will start to play and it will scare the snake away.

Problem:
How do I get through the tree maze west of the toucans?
Hint:
Click the hand icon around the screen and you'll soon find a way 
west. To find the correct path, notice where the small red lizard 
ran. Just go where the lizard did.

Problem:
How do I get the drum on the lower limb of the tree?
Hint:
Walk all the way out on the limb. It will bend down, but you 
won't fall.

Problem:
I can't get past the jaguar. Help!
Hint:
Go out on the limb and click the hand icon on the drum. Use the 
drum to frighten the jaguar.

Problem:
I've landed in the village. Now how do I get out of the mud?
Hint:
Pick up the fruit and the vine. They are located beside the mud 
hole. Use them to lasso the wild pig. Click the fruit on the pig 
to get him to come over.  While he eats the fruit, click the vine 
on him. You will have enough fruit to keep trying if you miss 
him. If you miss, just throw more fruit and try again.

Problem:
The village is deserted! Where is everybody?
Hint:
The people are hiding from you. Explore the village thoroughly, 
then head north near the mud puddle to enter the Grove. Once you 
have met Forest Heart and have agreed to help her, the people 
will come out of hiding.

Problem:
Where is Forest Heart?
Hint:
Forest Heart is in the large tree in the Grove north of the 
village.

Problem:
I've met Forest Heart but the village is still empty!
Hint:
The people will hide until you agree to help Forest Heart. Once 
you are inside the tree and have talked to her, show that you 
agree to help by clicking the hand icon on the branch she dropped 
in the tree room. The next time you enter the Village, the people 
will be there.

Problem:
Ok, the village is full of people. What do I do?
Hint:
Click the talk icon on all of the villagers. They will tell you 
their problems.  Help each one to solve them.

Problem:
How do I help the boy Taquia?
Hint:
If you have the drum, select it and click it on Taquia to return 
it. He is the shaman's apprentice and is responsible for the 
drum. If you don't have the drum, you may have to return to the 
spot you last played it pick it up again.  After helping Taquia, 
he will move away from the vine. Click the hand icon on the vine 
to swing across to the other bank.

Problem:
How do I help Churana the weaver?
Hint:
Once you have helped Taquia, you will be able to swing across the 
river. On the other side of the river, click the hand icon on the 
berries. You can also find a necklace that is hidden in the 
bushes. Musqui dropped the necklace when she was picking berries 
to make paint. Click the hand icon on the necklace to pick it up. 
Return the necklace to Musqui the potter and she will tell you to 
keep it. After she tells you to keep the necklace, you can give 
it to Churana the weaver. The next time you visit the weaver, 
Llusti will be sitting at her side.

Problem:
Apu the chief won't let me borrow his machete.
Hint:
You must help Churana the weaver first by giving her the love 
charm necklace you found in the berry bush. Llusti will go back 
to Churana. Once Llusti is no longer with Apu, the chief will be 
free to talk. Click the hand icon on the machete on the ground 
near Apu and he will let you borrow it.

Problem:
I want to help Alichina, the cook, fix her drink. How do I help?
Hint:
You must help Sumac the gardener harvest her roots first. She 
will give you some roots that you can give to Alichina. Alichina 
is the woman with gray hair who is standing next to the cooking 
pot.

Problem:
How do I help Sumac the gardener harvest roots?
Hint:
Obtain the machete from the chief and give it to Sumac.

Problem:
How can I help Musqui's baby?
Hint:
The baby needs medicine for its arm. Get the bark cup that is 
near Forest Heart's sap pool in the tree room. Click the cup on 
the sap pool to fill it.  Gather some pods on the opposite 
platform. To do this, you will need to use all the tree 
entrances. The doors are located between the buttress roots, just 
as the first one is. Click the ingredients on the bench outside 
the shaman's hut by the river. Leave the room. When you come back 
the medicine will be waiting for you. Click the hand icon on the 
bark cup and take the medicine to Musqui.  Click it on her or the 
baby and she will give you something in appreciation.

Problem:
I've given Alichina the roots but she still won't give me the drink!
Hint:
You must get a clay cup from Musqui the potter to hold the drink. 
However, Musqui won't give you the cup until  you help her baby 
with the shaman's poultice. To make the poultice, gather the 
ingredients in the tree room in Forest Heart and leave them on 
the shaman's bench by his hut. Once Musqui gives you the cup, 
give it to Alichina. If Alichina isn't ready to make the drink, 
she will keep the cup for you until the right time.

Problem:
Where is the shaman?
Hint:
You must help all the villagers before you meet the shaman. If 
you talk to Sinchi, the man who is thatching his hut, he will 
tell you that the shaman wants a Sky Sapphire. By helping all the 
villagers, you will acquire what you need to capture a Sky 
Sapphire, the blue Morpho butterfly you see in the Village.

Problem:
I've helped a lot of people but I don't understand what I'm 
trying to do.
Hint:
Talk to Sinchi, the man who is thatching the shaman's hut. He 
will tell you that the shaman needs a Sky Sapphire. Sinchi is 
talking about the large blue butterfly that you see in the 
village after you speak to him. Unless you talk to him, you will 
not see the butterfly. You can talk to him at any point, even if 
you have already helped some villagers. You must help ALL the 
villagers before you will be able to catch the butterfly. Talk to 
each villager to find out what they need.

Problem:
How do I get the Sky Sapphire?
Hint:
You must have a cup of the sweet drink to attract the butterfly. 
To get this, help all of the villagers. The villagers will 
eventually give you roots and a clay cup. Give the cup and roots 
to Alichina. She'll give you a cup of sweet drink. Next, go west 
to the screen where you fell into the village. Wait until the 
butterfly lights on the bushes with large, blue flowers. The 
bushes are near the mud hole. Click the cup of sweet drink on the 
butterfly. When the butterfly is drinking, click the hand icon on 
the cup to pick it up again.  Click the cup and butterfly on 
Sinchi the thatcher. He will invite you into the hut.

Problem:
Sinchi invited me to enter the hut and meet the shaman. What do I 
do?
Hint:
Enter the shaman's hut. The spider will not bother you.

Problem:
How do I deal with the Shaman?
Hint:
When you first enter the hut, the shaman asks you to sit down. 
Click the hand icon on the ground to do what he asks. At that 
moment a rainstorm begins that keeps you from leaving the hut. 
Since Sinchi didn't finish mending the thatch the it leaks. His 
pet spider doesn't like the water. You will have to fix the leak.

Problem:
How do I plug the leak in the hut?
Hint:
Click the hand icon on the hut pole to climb it. Click the sticky 
leaf on the spot where the water is dripping to plug the leak.

Problem:
Quiri won't move! I can't mix the paint!
Hint:
Click the berries you gathered across the river on the berry pot 
and the shaman will initiate you. The key to the face painting 
symbols is found in your game documentation, "Adam's Eco News." 
Click the cursor on the pattern that the shaman names. Then click 
on Adam's face.

Problem:
Quiri moved out of the way, but I'm still stuck!
Hint:
Put the berries you gathered across the river in the small pot on 
the ground.  You will go to a close-up and the Shaman will tell 
you which pattern to select.  The patterns are listed by name in 
the game documentation, "Adam's Eco News." Find the pattern name 
in the documentation. Click on the pattern in the game.  Now 
click the cursor on Adam's face.

Problem:
What do I do at the large tree north of the village?
Hint:
The tree has three entrances. You can  find them if you walk 
between the buttress roots. When you find an entrance, you will 
see one of the white exit cursors, which indicates that you can 
walk further. Click there and you will end up in front of a tree 
door.

Problem:
I can't get in the door to the tree!
Hint:
You can only enter the tree from the main entrance, which has a 
drum stand.

Problem:
How do I use the drum stand by the tree?
Hint:
Click the drum you found up in the Canopy on the drum stand. You 
will see a close-up of the drums. Click on the baton to the left 
of the drums in the close-up. Now you can play by clicking the 
baton cursor on the drums.

Problem:
I'm playing the drum but nothing seems to happen.
Hint:
You must play the correct melody on the drum. To learn it, pick 
up the drum again and go back to the drum stand in the village. 
Click the drum on the drum stand there. The markings behind the 
village drum stand match the markings on the drums. Play the 
pattern in order. Be sure to pick up the baton to play.  Learn 
the pattern. Play the pattern exactly the same way at the drum 
stand in the Grove. Be sure pick up the drum again when you leave 
the village drum stand.

Problem:
Why can't I talk to Forest Heart?
Hint:
Forest Heart is too weak to speak unless you are close to her 
heart. Click the hand icon on the seat in the middle of the 
screen. When Adam sits down, he can hear her. She will tell him 
that her seedling has been destroyed and that he must find a new 
one. She will offer Adam a gift that he must take to accept his 
quest.

Problem:
How do I help the Shaman start the ceremony?
Hint:
Click Forest Heart's branch on the shaman -- this is the "green 
memory" he needs to start the Ceremony.

Problem:
The ceremony is over but nothing is happening
Hint:
Click the hand icon on Forest Heart's golden blossom. The golden 
blossom is the one lying on the bottom of the path in the tree 
room.

Problem:
How do I make friends with the bat?
Hint:
Click the talk icon on the bat. Then, click Forest Heart's amulet 
on her. She will decide to help you in your quest!

Problem:
How do I free the bat?
Hint:
Once you have made friends with the bat by talking to her and 
showing her Forest Heart's amulet, click the hand icon on the 
net.

Problem:
How do I escape from Slaughter's shack?
Hint:
Use the walk icon to bounce the chair over to the bird cage. You 
must free Paquita, the bat that Adam made friends with in the 
forest. Paquita will help you escape.

Problem:
How do I free Paquita?
Hint:
Use the walk icon to bounce over to the bird cage. The latch to 
the cage has been fastened shut with a carrot. Click the hand 
icon on the carrot and Adam will eat it! Paquita can then fly out 
and chew through the rope that keeps Adam tied to the chair.

Problem:
How do I get out of Slaughter's bedroom without getting caught?
Hint:
If you leave by the door, you will always get caught. You will 
have to make your own escape route. First, click the hand icon on 
the jaguar pelt rug to move it out of the way. The floorboard 
underneath is rotten. Click the hand icon on the rotten section 
and Adam can pull a large chunk of it out. Click the hand icon on 
both the top sheet and the bottom sheet of Slaughter's bed. In 
the inventory window, click one sheet on the other and you will 
have a sheet rope.  Now select the sheet rope and close the 
inventory window. Click the sheet rope on the hole in the floor 
and Adam will tie the rope to the bed. Click the hand icon on the 
rope and Adam will start to climb down the rope.

Problem:
Slaughter's took all my things! I have nothing in my inventory!
Hint:
Your things are locked up in the safe in his bedroom - along with 
a few other surprises.

Problem:
Where is the combination to the safe?
Hint:
The combination to the safe is hidden in the password protected 
section of Slaughter's executive organizer. You will find the 
executive organizer under the bottom sheet on Slaughter's bed. 
Click the inventory hand icon on the organizer to view it close 
up. Click the power button to turn it on. Click the button with 
the key on it. You can find the password hidden on a slip of 
paper in Slaughter's bedroom.

Problem:
What is the password for the executive organizer?
Hint:
Click the look icon on the head of the jaguar pelt. You will find 
something is clenched in its teeth. If you look at the tail, you 
will find that it has been removed and sewn on. Click the hand 
icon on the jaguar's tail and the jaguar will spit a note onto 
the floor. Click the hand icon on the note to pick it up.  Open 
the inventory window. The password is on the note - Slaughter's 
name backwards.

Problem:
How do I avoid getting caught by Gonzales once I am outside the shack?
Hint:
To stay safe while you figure out how to help the birds, click 
the hand on the barrels or equipment and hide behind them. 
Gonzales must not be facing you when you sneak from one to the 
other. Hide behind a barrel when you first enter the room. Go to 
the screen to the east if Gonzales is reading his cookbook. If he 
takes too long on this screen, it sometimes helps to get caught. 
Paquita will free you again and Gonzales may be reading when you 
reenter. If Gonzales isn't reading and not facing you, you can go 
east the following way: Enter the screen by the rope ladder. Go 
as far into the distance as the game allows, then go east. When 
you enter the next screen, click the hand icon on the crates to 
hide if Gonzales is chopping vegetables. To climb the tower, wait 
until Gonzales goes to the other side of the camp and out of 
sight. He is chopping vegetables and wood, as you will see from 
the flying chips. He will leave for a while and then return. Be 
sure to time his habits. Click the hand icon on the alarm by the 
satellite dish to disable it as soon as you climb up.

Problem:
How do I get rid of Gonzales?
Hint:
Distract Gonzales by setting the birds in the cages near the 
river free. Click the key that you got from the safe on the lock 
on the lower cage - the one with the bird Adam saw in Iquitos.

Problem:
The birds keep giving me away!
Hint:
The birds are hungry and must be fed some of the grain from the 
sack near Gonzale's cookbook to quiet them.

Problem:
How do I get the grain?
Hint:
If you just try to touch the grain, Gonzales will catch you. You 
must suck up the grain with the hand vacuum that is on top of the 
satellite platform. Climb up on the tower when Gonzales is out of 
sight. Turn off the alarm that is attached to the satellite dish 
by clicking the hand icon on it. The alarm will turn green and 
you will be safe. Click the hand icon on the small vacuum near 
the laundry basket. To climb down from the platform, click the 
hand icon on the laundry basket and find the purple suspenders. 
Click the suspenders on the hook above the alarm. Adam will 
bungee down to the ground. Hide behind the barrel near the 
birdseed. Click the vacuum on the birdseed. Get the birdseed out 
of the vacuum in inventory by clicking the inventory hand icon on 
it. When you can get to the screen with the bird cages, click the 
birdseed on the birds. Don't go too close or the hungry birds 
will squawk and give you away! The birds will stay quiet when 
eating and allow you to approach.

Problem:
I've successfully avoided Gonzales. How do I leave the camp?
Hint:
Take the ax that is in the stump on the same screen with the bird 
cages. Make a canoe from the log near the bird cages by clicking 
the ax on it. Get a tennis racket from Slaughter's zebra-skin 
footlocker to use as a paddle. For more points, go back and click 
the talk icon on Paquita to tell her you are leaving before 
setting out in the canoe.

Problem:
What do I do in the bat caves?
Hint:
You can't go back the way you came. You have to go deeper into 
the caves. There is a tunnel in the upper right-hand corner of 
the screen. A small bat will stop you and demand your 
identification. To pass, you must obtain a bat visa.

Problem:
How do I get a visa?
Hint:
The cave is a refugee center for bats where your human passport 
will not work.  Talk to the little bat who is writing. He is the 
Customs Official. Show him Forest Heart's amulet and he will give 
you a job handing out bat visas. The bat visas are a stack of 
leaves next to the Customs Official. Once you have passed out the 
visas to the bats, you will be allowed to use an extra one to go 
through the tunnel.

Problem:
Which bat gets which visa?
Hint:
There are many different kinds of bats in the rain forest. You 
must match the correct visa to each bat. If you look at the leaf 
visas in your inventory, you will find the Latin name of each 
type of bat. Talk to all the bats to find out about them. Use the 
Ecorder on the bats. Review the data in the Ecorder. The Ecorder 
information screen about each bat includes its Latin name. Now 
you can match the leaves and the bats. Don't forget to give one 
to Paquita!

Problem:
I've given out visas to all the bats but still can't leave!
Hint:
Give the last visa to the bat Customs Official. It is a visa for 
a "California Big-Eared Bat." He'll let you use it and you can 
proceed north into another cave.

Problem:
How do I get the old bat to talk to me?
Hint:
Chiropterus Handwing, the old Temple Bat, is grouchy. He is 
hanging upside down and it makes him dizzy to talk to Adam 
standing on the ground. Click the hand icon on the perch and hang 
upside down. Now when you talk to the old bat, he can help you 
find the City of Gold.

Problem:
Ok, I've talked to the old bat. What do I do next?
Hint:
Adam must prove to Chiropterus that he is worthy to go to the 
City of Gold.  Pick up the Truth Stone. It is in a small alcove 
on the wall to the left of the jaguar statue.

Problem:
What do I do with the Truth Stone?
Hint:
Place the Truth Stone in the slot in the Jaguar statue. The 
correct slot is the same shape as the stone and is at the base of 
the statue in the front.

Problem:
I've answered all the riddles and the jaguar is gone. What 
happens next?
Hint:
Take the golden feather that the jaguar gave you. Head north to 
the underground river. The shadows at the back of Chiropterus's 
cave lead to a stairway.

Problem:
How do I help Paquita?
Hint:
Go back to get Chiropterus. He knows more about bat illnesses and 
can tell you what to do next.

Problem:
Chiropterus has examined Paquita. How do I proceed?
Hint:
Use the whistle that Chiropterus gave you (click it on Adam) to 
clear the bats away from the cave entrance. Click the hand icon 
on the boat to untie the rope mooring and get in. Once in the 
boat, you will leave automatically.

Problem:
Help! I'm trapped in the flooded forest!
Hint:
Swim east and click the talk icon on the howler monkey. He has a 
problem and needs your help. The floods have stranded him in the 
middle of a harpy eagle's hunting ground. Unless the monkey can 
escape, he will be dinner for the eagle.

Problem:
The monkey won't let me on his rock!
Hint:
You can make friends with the monkey by giving him something to 
eat. Swim south from where you entered. Click the hand icon on 
the vine to climb it. Click the hand icon on the fruit to pick 
some. Climb down and swim back to the monkey.  Click the fruit on 
the monkey and he will let you climb onto the rock with him.

Problem:
I'd like to help the monkey escape but I don't know how.
Hint:
Get one of the large lily pads for the monkey to use as a raft. 
Before you can use the lily pad, you'll have to figure out how to 
cut it loose. Look at the monkey's rock carefully.

Problem:
How do I cut the lily pad loose?
Hint:
Get the piranha's teeth from the monkey's rock - they are very 
sharp. Click them on the large lily pad near the fruit tree. 
Click the hand icon on the lily pad and take it to the monkey.

Problem:
The monkey can't reach me even though I can help.
Hint:
Click the hand icon on the rock to climb up. The monkey will hop 
onto the lily pad.

Problem:
How do I get out of the harpy eagle's nest?
Hint:
You cannot leave without the eagle's help. Use the golden feather 
you got from the jaguar. Click it on the harpy eagle.

Problem:
How do I get into the main ruins?
Hint:
You must open a secret tunnel. It leads from under the huge rock 
with the carvings into the ruins you see in the distance by the 
lake. If Adam climbs up on the seat, it will tip the stone so 
that you can see the staircase. The rock slides back in place 
when Adam climbs down. You need to weight the rock down.  Click 
the mask from Slaughter's safe in the hole where one is missing. 
If it won't fit, open the inventory window and click the hand 
icon on it. One of the gold weights was stuck inside it! Put the 
mask in place and take the rest of the disks. Put all the disks 
on the seat. Don't forget to use the disk that you found in the 
mask.

Problem:
How do I find my way through the temple maze?
Hint:
Click the hand icon on the litter left by Slaughter and his men. 
Under one piece of trash is a magnifying glass dropped by 
Slaughter. Click the hand icon on it to pick it up. In the 
Inventory Window, click the magnifying glass on Churana's 
necklace to see the carved pattern. The pattern is a map to the 
maze.  Go down the secret passage to the maze. Whenever you click 
the eye icon on the necklace in inventory and you are in the maze 
room, you will pop up the maze map to help you find your way.

Problem:
I'm in the room at the top of the maze, but I'm stuck!
Hint:
This room has an exit that leads to the lake. Click the hand icon 
on the footholds on the back wall. Click the hand icon on the 
carving of the snake's tail. The door will slide open.

Problem:
How do I get past the golden serpent?
Hint:
The snake can be charmed, just as the king used to do in ancient 
times. You will need the gold crown and the bone pipes. They are 
in the room at the top of the maze. Solve the jigsaw puzzle on 
the back wall by clicking on the blocks.  There are two pictures. 
Each time you put one together, a hidden panel opens.  You can 
take the crown, the pipes and a small pot of gold dust that may 
be useful later. Once the panel has been unlocked, you may use 
the hand icon on it to swing it around in case you forgot 
anything. Go to the lake shore and click the walk icon on the 
small islands to reach the large one with the carving. If one of 
the stones turns into a turtle and dunks you, don't worry. Just 
start over and avoid that stone the next time. Once you get to 
the island, click the hand icon on the water to the east. A 
golden serpent will swim toward you.  Click the crown on Adam's 
head. Click the pipes on the serpent and Adam will play a tune 
that puts him to sleep. Click the hand icon on the water to swim 
to the secret island.

Problem:
The vines won't release me!
Hint:
Click the amulet of Forest Heart on the orchids and they will 
make the vines let go of Adam. Now, whenever you approach the 
fountain, you are allowed to touch it.

Problem:
Where is the seedling?
Hint:
The correct seedling is hidden among the thousands of 
identical-looking seeds on the fountain ledge. You must sprout 
the seeds to find out which is the right one. To sprout the 
seeds, click the hand icon on the stone cup from the stella 
(statue) of the Princess. Click the stone cup on the hole in the 
fountain - located just behind the vines. Click the golden 
blossom of Forest Heart in the cup. Now turn on the water by 
clicking the hand icon on the pillar at the top of the fountain. 
When you see the correct seedling, click the hand icon on it.

Problem:
Slaughter keeps catching me!
Hint:
You must walk Slaughter into the vine booby trap, where he will 
be caught by the plants. Click the walk icon on the ground to 
climb down from the stella.  Click the pot of gold dust on 
Slaughter and Adam will blow the dust in his eyes. Slaughter 
won't be able to see and will back up into the fountain.  Another 
way to trap Slaughter is to put the pot of gold dust on the 
fountain.  Slaughter will trap himself trying to get it.

Problem:
I've defeated Slaughter. How do I proceed?
Hint:
You've found the Fountain of Youth, just as Chiropterus asked you 
to do. Use the bat whistle to call the bats. Click the whistle on 
Adam and he will blow it. When the bats fly in, click the hand 
icon on the sparkling water in the fountain and Adam will give 
some to Paquita.

Problem:
What do I do when I return to the village?
Hint:
Since you now have the seedling of Forest Heart, the people will 
help you plant it so she can live again. Click the seedling on 
the area of ground that the shaman has prepared for it. After the 
seedling sprouts, you will be left alone with the shaman. Click 
the whistle on Adam when the shaman tells you to.  Paquita will 
fly in. Click the eye icon on Paquita when she asks you to and 
you will see a surprise!
