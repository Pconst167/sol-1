Alone in the Dark
(The Walkthrough Ver. 1.0)

	This is a COMPLETE SPOILER to the Alone in the Dark 
game for the PC.  It will get the player through quickly and assumes 
the player either retains all (s)he reads or does not care at all about the 
story that goes with the game.  All unnecessary and used items are left 
behind as soon as possible.  Most things that do not need to be done to 
finish the game are marked as optional.  This is by no means the only 
order of events that leads to a completed game, but it is nearly the 
most efficient.  Distribute this freely and add to it as you wish just 
maintain the credits.  Enjoy!

In the LOFT:  Push the Wardrobe in front of the window to keep out 
the winged beast.  Then push the Chest over the trapdoor in the floor 
to keep out the Zombie.  Now you can safely search the LOFT.  Open 
the Chest to get the rifle.  There is a note behind the Piano on its right-
hand side.  There is a Book in the small bookcase opposite the 
window.  Read and leave the Book (Extracts of Golden Fleece) and the 
note.  Open/Search the Wardrobe to get the Indian Cover.  Take the 
Lantern from the table.  Exit through the opening in the corner to the 
Right of the barrels (the same way you entered) into the STORAGE

Death).  Read and leave the Book (The Tale of Captain Norton).  
Leave the STUDY and go through the set of closed double doors in the

Pirate (Captain Norton).  Take the key he had and the book by the 
paintings on the floor.  Read and leave the Book (Demonia

Matchbox while you are at it) and enter the Maze.  Remember the 
closed Stone Door on the Left as soon as you enter.  If  you don't see it 
go Right and turn Left when you see it and start the following

Creatures while wading to the Crypt/Alter in front of the tree.  Take 
the Hook from the Crypt/Alter.  Put/Drop the Talisman on the 
Crypt/Alter to stop the Fireballs, but you must still avoid the Water 
Creatures.  Use the Lighter to relight the Lantern (if you are out of oil 
at this point, you are in BIG trouble -- try again).  Throw the Lantern 
at the Tree.  Follow instructions and "GET OUT OF HERE!"  Wade to 
the opposite platform you entered on.  Jump up and Use the Hook to 
open the Stone Door.  Go through and to the Left into the Maze and go

STONE STAIRS and down the Third HALLWAY and out the Front 
door.

It's over, but...
