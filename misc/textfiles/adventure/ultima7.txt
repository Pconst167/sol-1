                    ::::::>> WALKTHROUGH <<::::::


Ok, since I've been getting TONS of netmail asking me to, I decided to write
this to help all you stuck Ultima fans out there.  I've seen a couple solves
floating around already, but they were shaky at best, so here it goes...

: Note :  There are essentially two ways to go about this game.  You can either
follow Elizabeth and Abraham's trails and work on solving the murders, or you
can cut to the chase and do the important stuff.  I decided to tell you how to
chase E&A, which takes a little longer, but gives you more enjoyment of the plot
development.


::: TRINSIC ::: You appear in Trinsic.  Search the stables and get the key.  Use
it on the chest in the dead guy's house (west side of town).  The scroll is your
first clue that the Fellowship is not what they claim to be.  Talk to the
victim's son, Spark, and Gilberto in the healer's.  Talk to the mayor and get
permission to investigate outside of Trinsic.  If any of you have "lost" your
documentation, drop me some email and I'll send you a patch that will
bypass the protection scheme in Trinsic.

::: BRITAIN ::: Skip Paws and go to Britain.  Talk to Lord British, get the Orb
of the Moons (VERY useful).  He'll tell you to find Rudyom in Cove.  Talk to
Batlin at the Fellowship, and tell him you want to join the Fellowship.  Take
the package to give to Elynor in Minoc.  Also talk to the mayor, Millie, Gordon,
and Clint, the shipwright.  You will learn the Elizabeth and Abraham have gone
to Minoc.  Following this little goose chase is a good way to follow through on
what you need to do to finish the game.  Also visit the museum and acquire the
moonstones (I like Iolo's little comments on this... :)  I would also get the
Mark and Recall spells as soon as you are able.

::: COVE ::: Talk to Rudyom, get the wand and 4 pieces of blackrock.  Read his
notebook.  If you're a softie, talk to the girl at the shrine, she's a sure
thing. :)

::: MINOC ::: Surprise, surprise, another murder... Go to the sawmill ASAP.
Talk to everyone outside.  Get the dagger from the murder scene.  If you really
wanna learn about the Fellowship, open the package before giving it to Elynor.
You can still give it to her and Batlin will be a little miffed, but he'll still
let you join.  Talk to Margareta, learn your fortune.  Most of what follows will
help you fulfill your destiny.  You will also learn in Minoc that Elizabeth and
Abraham have gone to Paws.

NOTE : Solving all of the little town mysteries is not necessary to finish the
game (a couple are, but most are just for kicks).  If you're into maximum game
enjoyment, then I recommend you take the time to solve them.

:: PAWS ::  Talk to Feridwyn.  He'll say E&A (Eliz. and Abraham) have gone to
Jhelom.  You can stay and solve the little "missing venom" mystery if you like.
It will give you practice on how to deal with people and get information from
them.  Head to Jhelom.  If you can't afford a ship by now, go to the western
entrance to the dungeon Despise (next the Lost Lake surrounded by mountains NW
of Britain) and get the flying carpet.  Follow north shore of the river that
feeds the lake and it will be sitting there.  Very useful item (and it's free!).
While you're in Paws, buy the hourglass from Beverlea and keep it in a safe
place.

:: JHELOM ::  Talk to Joseph the mayor.  He says E&A have left for Britain (of
course).  While you are here, talk to DeSnel about the serpentine dagger you
found in Minoc.  You can solve the mystery with Sprellic and the banner of
Honor, but it's not necessary.  Keep in mind that killing townsfolk is ok ONLY
if they attack you first.

:: BRITAIN (again) ::  Go to Britain again and talk to Batlin.  He'll tell you
to go to Destard and find some Fellowship gold.  Destard is located to the SW of
paws on the west side of the mountains.  You don't have to go in, just go near
it.  It's PACKED with treasure and gems and dragons, so be careful.
(Invisibility is almost a MUST here).  There are also some glass swords in there
(save at least one for later...).  Go back to Britain, and join the Fellowship
at 9pm that night (don't listen to your friends).  There is another
documentation scheme here.  Batlin will ask you 2 of 3 random questions I've
seen.  Ginseng must be boiled 40 times and Mandrake can be found in 2 places in
Britannia.  I think the answer to the picture question is 6.  Trial and error
will help if that's the wrong answer.  Make sure you wear your Fellowship
amulet, it will effect the way some characters treat you.  Looks like E&A have
headed towards Vesper.

:: VESPER ::  Find Auston the mayor.  He's not a Fellowship branch leader, but
he has talked to E&A.  He will refer you to Cador, who tells you they went to
Moonglow.  This is an interesting town.  Be careful what you say if you go into
the gargoyle tavern...

:: MOONGLOW ::  Very important city... Talking to Rankin, the Fellowship branch
leader, will reveal that E&A have moved on (surprise surprise) to Terfin, the
island home of the Gargoyles.  While you are here you need to awaken Penumbra
who has been asleep since your last visit to Britannia.  Next to the door of her
house is a plaque.  By reading it repeatedly, you will learn how to open the
door (by placing a hammer, gold ring, lockpick, spindle of thread, and some
other form of gold next to the plaque).  This will open the door.  Once in side,
awaken Penumbra with your Awaken cantrip or by using a potion.  She will say she
needs some blackrock to shield her room before she can continue to help you.
Well, what do you know?  If you've followed along closely, you should have 4
chunks of it with you.  Put them on the pedestals in her room and talk to her
again.  She will tell you to find the Ethereal Ring.  This would be a good place
to cast a Mark spell so you can return when you've found the Ring.  Terfin would
be a good place to start.

:: TERFIN ::  Talk to everyone, especially Draxinusom and Quan.  E&A have headed
to the Meditation Retreat.  You can solve the altar conspiracy here if you like,
but it's not necessary.  You will also learn that the Ethereal Ring is on the
isle of Spektran (NW of Terfin).  You will get the ring later.

:: MEDITATION RETREAT ::  If you go to the Retreat (NOT necessary at this point,
you will return later...) you will learn that Ian will only permit entrance to
Fellowship members (which you are, I hope...).  You will learn that E&A have
gone to Buccaneer's Den.  Before you pursue them any further you must find the
omniscient Time Lord.  The first step is to go to Empath Abbey west of Yew.

:: EMPATH ABBEY ::  Talk to Taylor the monk.  He will tell you about the Emps
that live in the woods.  If you've seen them, you'll know they won't speak to
you (unless you have some honey).  Go to the Bee Cave and get two or three
clumps of honey.  The Bee Cave is no big deal.  I found that you could basically
run right through the bees and they won't really give a shit.  Use the smoke
bomb if you get in trouble.

:: EMPS & WOODS ::  With the honey, you are able to talk to Trellek the Emp
about finding the Wisps.  If you're having troubles finding the Emps, look for
the giant white Silverleaf trees in the woods.  Trellek will need permission
from Saralek who needs permission from Solomon, the Emp leader.  Solomon will
give you a written agreement to have Ben the woodsman sign to stop the
destruction of the Silverleaf trees.  Ben's cabin is on the very western edge of
the forest near the shore.  When you've gotten the treaty signed, Solomon will
grant you permission to take Trellek to the Wisps, but Saralek changes her mind.
Instead of going with you, Trellek will give you a whistle to call the Wisps
with (that was easy, huh? :)  Head to Spiritwood to find the Wisps (near
Destard).  They can also be found in the abandoned fortress they've inhabited
somewhere near Yew woods.

:: THE WISPS ::  Blow the whistle when you're near a Wisp and it will talk to
you.  They will offer you information if you bring them Alagner's notebook.
They will also give you valuable information on the Guardian.  Off to New
Magincia!

:: NEW MAGINCIA ::  Alagner will agree to give you his notebook if you answer
the questions of Life and Death.  This must be done by asking the Tortured One
in Skara Brae.
It might save time if you Mark Alagner's house so you can return his notebook
quickly later.  If you haven't acquired a Seance spell yet, go get one and head
towards Skara Brae on foot.

:: SKARA BRAE ::  Use the Seance spell and hitch a ride from the Ferryman.
Destroyed by an accidental fire, Skara Brae is home of the Dead.  Talk to
everyone (especially Mordra).  Make sure you pick up the Mandrake Essence (the
glowing potion), an empty vial, a curing potion, and potion of Invisibility at
Mordra's pad.  Go to the Smithy and talk to Trent.  Take the music box and go to
the Dark Tower in the NW edge of the isle.  Use the music box near Rowena and
take her ring to Trent.  Take the finished cage and go to the Alchemist's.
Caine won't answer the questions until you destroy the Liche.  Plug the three
potions and the empty vial into the thingamajig and turn the burner on.  If you
did it right, a sparkling blue potion should fill up the vial.  Take that and
the cage to the Dark Tower.  Go to the back of the Tower (through the fake wall
by the stairs) and use the cage on the Well.  Go to the throne room and wait for
midnight.  When Horance lies down, plop the cage over him and use the potion.
Horance says you need to find someone to sacrifice.  Talk to Forsythe the mayor.
Now you get to find and talk to EVERYONE in the town, including those who you've
talked to already.  After everyone refuses to sacrifice themselves, Forsythe
will agree.  Take him to the Well and destroy it.  Go to Caine and learn that
there are NO answers to Life and Death (you MUST still do this).

:: TIME LORD :: Go to New Magincia, and tell him there are no Answers.  Get the
key, find the notebook in his storeroom and take it to the Wisps.  Use your Orb
to beam to the Time Lord.  He will direct you to the dungeon Despise to destroy
the ether-screwing generator.  Before you can follow up on this, you need to
destroy the generator found in Deceit.  In order to do this, you need the
aforementioned Ethereal Ring (ie Spektran!).  If you go to Alagner's to return
his notebook, you'll find him dead (very dead, actually).  Use his crystal ball
and you'll get your first glimpse at the much sought Elizabeth, Abraham, Hook,
and Forskis...

:: SPEKTRAN ::  The door to the Sultan's place should open when you approach it.
As you will see, the Sultan is somewhat of a loony.  You need to kill his harpy
and take its key.  The harpy can be easily killed using invisibility or a glass
sword (make sure you still have at least one glass sword when you leave here.
It's ok if you don't, but it will save you much heartache later...).  To reach
the room with the ring you need to stack the crates on the table (three high I
think...).  Now head to Moonglow and have Penumbra enchant the ring.

:: DECEIT ::  This dungeon isn't too tough, but what's inside the generator IS.
Follow all the hallways and find the false walls (try walking into the dark
areas and you'll see what I mean).  You can talk to the Cyclops if you want, but
it's not necessary.  Before you approach the generator, drop all your party
members and put on the Ring.  Inside the generator is the ugliest, toughest
fucker in the whole game (he's the one you've been saving the glass sword for).
I didn't have any more glass swords by the time I got here and still killed him,
so don't fret.  By cornering him and using LOTS of healing and protection
potions, you can do it with any magical weapon.  Click on the box in the middle
of the room and watch as the generator collapses.  There should be a miniature
tetrahedron sitting on the ground.  GET IT and get out of Deceit.  Now Nicodemus
(in the "chessboard house" in Yew) is able to enchant your hourglass, which is
needed to approach the next generator in Despise.

:: DESPISE ::  DON'T enter the northeastern entrance to Despise.  It's good for
experience, but not necessary.  Use the entrance on the Lake (the one where you
found the flying carpet).  I won't get into the details of Despise, but you need
to get around the teleporters and follow the tunnels east of the entrance.  The
tunnels will burrow around to the SW side of the lake and you'll find the
Spherical Generator.
You'll find a moongate puzzle inside.  The correct sequence is RED, BLUE, BLUE,
RED.  Pick up the small Sphere and leave (via Recall if possible :)  One more
generator to go!

:: MEDITATION RETREAT AGAIN ::  This place is pretty much a bore, except for the
cave that you're not allowed to enter (ooo! are you shaking??).  By this point
in the game you should have gotten a feel for what the Fellowship is about
(nothing good, that's for sure...).  In the cave is the Cube generator.  You
won't be able to approach it, but you should Mark it so you can beam back later.
After reaching the Cube, contact the Time Lord by using the hourglass.  He will
tell you to find a mineral called Caddellite.  This is found on the Isle of
Ambrosia.

:: AMBROSIA ::  This island is kinda hidden.  It's located in the NE sea of
Britannia.  If you've been using the map from the game package or the one found
in the game itself, you won't be able to see Ambrosia because it's under the
little compass icon in the upper right corner.  It's a large island and
shouldn't be too hard to find.  Inside a cave on this island is where the
Caddellite is found.  It's guarded by a three headed Hydra.  Surprisingly the
Hydra is huge wimp and croaks quickly in combat.  You'll need one chunk of
Caddellite per party member (or just one if you plan on approaching the Cube
alone.  You can't take your party members inside anyway...).  Take the
Caddellite to Zorn in Minoc and he will fashion helmets for you.

:: MEDITATION RETREAT again :::  Beam back to the Cube and go inside wearing
your special helmet.  The puzzle inside involves walking on certain spots of the
walkway that trigger the bridges to other parts.  Trouble is, some spots remove
other bridges as well.  I could go on for a page or two on how to solve it, but
it would be easier just to tell you to save the game a lot and do it yourself.
It's hard, but not impossible.  Just look out for the fire fields and fireballs.
Another hint: you'll cover almost 100% of the walkways before you're able to get
to the center.  After the Cube crumbles, take the little cube and head to
Buccaneer's Den.

:: BUCCANEER'S DEN ::  Now you're after the ever elusive E&A and the killer
Hook.  Possession of the little Cube forces the truth out of people who would
normally lie to you (ie most people in Bucc. Den...).  Talking to Danag at the
Fellowship Branch will reveal much about Hook, Elizabeth, Abraham, and the
fucked up Fellowship.  Talk to Sintag at the House of Games and get the key from
him.  The door in the Games leads into the mountain passages where Hook's
hideout is.  In his hideout, you'll find the navigational plans for the ever
elusive Crown Jewel, and the Black Gate key used to get past the barrier on the
Isle of the Avatar.  Also in his hideout is a list of people the Fellowship has
eliminated (with you and ol' LB yet to go).  There's nothing much else in those
tunnels, except for a some torture chambers used by the Fellowship and a couple
worthless prisoners.  Off to the Black Gate!

:: ISLE OF THE AVATAR ::  If you're not 8th level by this time and able to cast
some major kickass spells, you might want to do some experience-collecting
before going here.  The key from Hook's place will allow you to pass the barrier
on the south side of the island and get into the dungeon.  This dungeon is
rather long and hard.  A couple tips:

     - It is not necessary to kill the dragon.  Lots of
       cool goodies though! (ie a Glass Sword that will be
       handy  soon)

     - The Chair of Change teleports you to one of 3 places
       in the dungeon if you sit in it.  At each location it
       takes you, examine all the walls for hidden passages.

     - Sitting in the Throne of Virtue (or whatever its
       called) will make the Chair of Change take you to a
       fourth place, necessary to get to the Gate.

     - In the "Fellowship Hall" try fiddling with the
       medallion.

     - Watch out for the Paladin guarding one of the last
       doors, he's an asskicker (use a Glass Sword if you
       have one...).

     - Take the mage's spellbook from his room.  It's
       fully loaded!

     - If you still can't find the Black Gate room, try
       looking for any keys you might have missed.  Also
       poke on every wall you see, there's lots of
       illusionary walls.

:: THE BLACK GATE ::  Ah, the gang's all here!  After some little bickering,
they will attack you.  I had troubles winning this battle hand-to-hand until I
found a useful little spell called Death Vortex.  If you use it, DON'T cast it
on an enemy.  Cast it on YOURSELF.  This spell is useful to say the least.
After everyone croaks (except the little weasel Batlin) you'll be left with the
choice of returning home, or using Rudyom's Wand (you still have it I hope!) on
the Gate.  The animated sequence at the end of the game is kinda short, but
_completely_ amazing.


Ok people, that's it.  Mucho regards to Mr. Gariott and Origin for making such
an incredible game.  Ultima VIII is supposed to be out next summer, so keep
yer eyes peeled.  If anyone has any further questions, drop me a note!
