SE-KAA OF ASSIAH
Written by Les Hogarth & Clive Wilson
Walk Through by Dorothy Millard (C64 Version)


Notes
1. You need to make approximately ten moves before the staff and cloak 
appear.
2. Do not hang around too long in the castle before making a move, or an 
evil brood of lost souls will appear, pause instead.
3. In part 2 on the Plains of Beardome, where you arrive from part 2, it is 
essential to remain still whilst the hopper is running across the screen.  
It appears every 15 seconds, so wait until it has just disappeared from the 
screen then move and wait again for it to cross before moving again.  
Painfully slow but it guarantees a safe journey.  The alternative is to move 
quickly but this is risky.
