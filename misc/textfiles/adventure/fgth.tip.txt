FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD - TIPS - TYPED BY VAXALON - 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE ZTT ROOM
 
 There are two methods to get past the bullets. You can wear the flak jacket
and shoot away the wall but the seconds method is easier, especially if you 
have no jacket. Move to the far left of the room and start shooting. 
Miraculously the wall will be shot away even though you aren't facing it.
If you complete the puzzle you can go to the shooting gallery or you can go
to talking heads if you press one of the three buttons at the bottom of the
screen.

RAID OVER MERSEYSIDE

 To complete the game just aim your game near the top or middle of the screen
and keep the streams of bullets coming out. It should't be to much hassle to
get through without losing any pleasure points.

SHOOTING GALLERY
 
 When you have shot at your target it is possible to save time by pressing
the fire button again even through the booklet says you have to go to the
bottom of the screen.

THE MURDER MYSTERY
 
 This is very easy because it is always Mr Straight but before you can reveal
this you must first find all 23 clues

TALKING HEADS

 This is quite a simple game to complete. Just shoot out the top blocks and
shoot through them until you have to move to avoid being shot. Then move to 
the bottom of the screen and quickly back to the top and start shooting.
By alternating between the top of the screen and the bottom it is possible to
slowly chip the Russians points away.

SEA OF HOLES

 This room is more frustrating than anything so just persevere and you will
finally complete it after a bit of practice.

THE WAR ROOM

 When you enter this room move to the far right. As soon as the symbols,
shoot at them. The first time you hit a symbol you haven't hit before then
the pleasure bar relevant to that symbol goes up.

THE CORRIDORS OF POWER
 
 The important thing to remember is that you are not in an ordinary maze.
The doors to the rooms are normal at the top end of the corridors. You can 
only depart from the corridors of power if you're hit by a fireball or you
enter a room.
