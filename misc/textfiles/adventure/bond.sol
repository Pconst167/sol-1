 JAMES BOND: THE STEALTH AFFAIR
             Part 1

 AT THE AIRPORT

 Okay, 007, so you've met with the director of the CIA, who told you about the
stolen Stealth bomber. Why they would ask a British agent to help when they have
their own worldwide network of capable agents is unimportant right now. What
_is_ important is that you have to get out of this darn airport in Santa Paragua
before you can get on with the game. The customs official wants to see your
papers. Now, where did you put that passport?

 EXAMINE newspaper machine. Hm, that looks familiar! (Right! You saw the same
machine in FUTURE WARS, another adventure using the same game engine.) EXAMINE
coin return slot. Ah, how convenient! There is a coin sitting in the slot. USE
COIN ON COIN SLOT (not the coin return slot). Unlike the machine in FUTURE WARS,
this one works the very first time! EXAMINE newspaper. The newspaper will tell
you which country is currently friendly with Santa Paragua. This is random, so
make a note of it.

 Enter the door to the bathroom. Enter one of the toilets. OPERATE BRIEFCASE and
TAKE AMERICAN PASSPORT. (Don't show that to the customs official. It'll make for
a very short game.) TAKE PEN and OPERATE CALCULATOR to open the secret
compartment (as explained to you in the manual). EXAMINE the passport falsifier.
EXAMINE the note at the lower right area of the falsifier. Hm, the instructions
seem simple enough. OPERATE the up or down button until the sign matches the
country name in the newspaper. TAKE UNUSED PASSPORT. USE UNUSED PASSPORT ON
OPENING (at the left edge of the falsifier). OPERATE the Enter button on the
falsifier. Voila! You now have a validated passport from that country. OPERATE
BRIEFCASE to close it.

 Leave the bathroom and go back to the customs area. USE THE FORGED PASSPORT ON
CUSTOMS OFFICIAL. Now we are getting somewhere. SPEAK to the welcome hostess.
What is this? A telegram for Bond? James Bond? EXAMINE telegram. It says "Flight
714. Mr. Martinez." It must be from a friendly agent. Go left one screen.

 Enter the open door where the armed guard is. He asks to see your airplane
ticket. No problem. USE AIRLINE TICKET ON GUARD. Notice the two columns on the
left side of the screen? One says "5" and the other says "7." They lead to
different luggage carousels. Try exiting the screen to the left on the near side
or between the two columns. You will find yourself in front of one of the
luggage carousels. The blinking letters on the sign in the middle of the screen
give you the number of the flight that is being unloaded. Naturally, you want to
be at the carousel for flight 714.

 Once you are at the correct carousel, EXAMINE the luggage coming at you on the
conveyor belt until you find the one belonging to Mr. Martinez. TAKE LUGGAGE.
Exit to the right. Enter the closed door on the right side of the screen. Here
is another bathroom area. Enter one of the toilets. OPERATE LUGGAGE. You find a
watch and an electric razor. Both, of course, have secret uses which are
described in your manual. EXAMINE the razor. OPERATE THE RAZOR. There is an
electric cable attached to it. The razor only works with AC power. Leave the
toilet and enter the bathroom area again. Notice there is an electric socket on
the right, past the last toilet. USE ELECTRIC CABLE IN SOCKET.

 The cassette tape machine inside the razor tells you to go meet your contact at
Las Mimosas Park, and you should be wearing a red carnation. Wait! What is this
about self-destructing in 5 seconds? Oh, a joke! Ha-ha, very funny! Still, that
may come in handy later. Leave the bathroom. USE THE FORGED PASSPORT ON THE
CUSTOMS OFFICIAL. He notices that you are not Mr. Martinez and yet you are
carrying his luggage. Whew! He only takes the luggage and waves you on your way.
No harm done. You have already taken everything you need out of the luggage
anyway.

 Exit to the left, then leave the airport through the door in the middle of the
screen. Stand next to the taxi sign and wait for a taxi. It shouldn't be long
before a taxi pulls up. Just walk up to it and you will automatically climb into
the taxi that takes you to downtown Santa Paragua.

 DOWNTOWN

 The taxi drops you off near a flower shop. How convenient. We can just buy a
red carnation here and be on our way. EXAMINE American passport. There is some
currency inside the passport. USE CURRENCY ON FLORIST. Darn. She doesn't have
enough change for the transaction. Now what? Go left one screen.

 Well, there's a bank right here! I'll bet they can convert your currency into
change in no time at all. Enter the bank. USE CURRENCY ON THE BANK CLERK behind
the window. He exchanges some of the currency for coins. While you're at it, you
may as well exchange all of it. USE CURRENCY ON THE BANK CLERK a second time.
Now, you have all coins and no currency. Exit the bank.

 Go back to the florist. USE THE FIRST STACK OF COINS ON FLORIST. TAKE RED
CARNATION. USE RED CARNATION ON JAMES (you). Go left one screen. You are in
front of the bank again. Go to the far side of the bank and exit left. This must
be the park mentioned in the cassette. And look, there's the bench right in the
middle of the screen. Walk to the bench and move around it a bit until the game
takes over and sits you on the bench. A man in a trench coat comes out from
behind the bushes to greet you.

 That sure was a brief greeting! A passing car drives by and guns him down
almost immediately. He does manage to tell you about some documents and gives
you a key taped to a card with the number 2475 written on it. It sure looks like
a key to a safe-deposit box. I guess we should go visit the bank again.

 Go right one screen and enter the bank. USE CARD AND KEY ON THE BANK CLERK
behind the window. He deactivates the security door to the safe-deposit boxes
and hands your key back. Go down the stairs at the bottom right of the screen.
Enter the safe-deposit boxes area through the open door. EXAMINE the safes until
you find 2475. It should be the lowest one in the right column. USE KEY ON SAFE.
You find a briefcase and open it. You find a calculator inside that allows you
to open the secret compartment. There is a small electronic box here. EXAMINE
it. From its description, this must be a safe-cracking device. TAKE SMALL
ELECTRONIC BOX. There is also an envelope here. EXAMINE envelope. It's marked
"Operation Stealth." Jackpot! TAKE ENVELOPE.

 Suddenly, two KGB agents come out of nowhere and attack you. You recognize one
of them. He's the guy that was supposedly your contact who was gunned down at
the park. This was all a deliberate ploy to get you to open the briefcase for
them. They have both you and the envelope; you're in big trouble now!


 JAMES BOND: THE STEALTH AFFAIR
             Part 2

 IN A CAVE

 The KGB agents have you all tied up in a cave. Just before they left, they blew
up the entrance with explosives, and you're trapped. EXAMINE the ground right
next to you. OPERATE THE GROUND. Mr. Bond, you're one lucky spy: There's a piece
of sharp metal buried in the ground near you. USE ROPE ON THE PIECE OF SHARP
METAL and you're free again. OPERATE THE PIECE OF SHARP METAL and it turns out
to be a pickax. EXAMINE pickax. Left behind by a miner, eh? Okay, I'll buy that.
EXAMINE the rock wall next to you. You can feel a breeze. Let's see, if I take
this axe and work on this wall...move slightly to the left of where you're
standing. OPERATE PICKAX three times and you'll have a hole large enough through
which to escape. Enter hole.

 Here's the first of several arcade sequences. You are strongly advised to save
the game here. This one is fairly easy. You're in the water and will have to
swim to the right of the screen. The red line is your oxygen level: As you swim
underwater to get through the rocks, this level will decrease. When the level
reaches zero, you die. If you get to a point on the screen where you can
surface, you'll restore the oxygen level back to maximum again. Fair enough?
Well, go for it! Once you finish this screen, there's one more screen to
conquer. When you exit this second screen to the right, you find yourself back
in front of the flower shop.

 BEACH

 Go left one screen and you're in front of the bank again. This time, exit to
the left in front of the bank. You're near a beach with a hotel in the
background. What is that guy doing on the beach? Speak to the man on the beach.
He is selling an inflatable bracelet, useful to swimmers and surfers. SPEAK to
him again until he drops the price to 18. USE COINS ON MAN to buy the bracelet,
then walk to the hotel.

 HOTEL

 Enter the hotel through the revolving door. SPEAK to the receptionist. Enter
the door to the side of the elevator. Take the stairs and go up to the third
floor. The maid is here vacuuming just outside the elevator. Now you know why we
didn't take the elevator in the first place. You would never be able to get past
her. Go right two screens to the end of the hallway. OPERATE DOOR. Here, things
will happen quickly and furiously. First, a girl named Julia pulls a gun on you.
Then, a man named Otto and two burly guards burst in and capture both you and
Julia. What is going on here?

 BOAT

 You find yourself on a boat with Julia, Otto, and the guards. They are just
about ready to tie you to a big rock and throw you overboard. Quickly, OPERATE
BRACELET. The bracelet inflates just before they tie you up. Both you and Julia
are thrown into the ocean. You will fall through two ocean screens with
absolutely nothing to do. As soon as the third scene appears, save the game
quickly; there's no time to lose! OPERATE BRACELET to deflate it and you're free
from the ropes. Swim to the girl until you're touching her. OPERATE GIRL to
untie her and watch as you and Julia try to swim back to the surface two screens
away before your oxygen runs out.

 It will be very close. But if you were quick enough down at the bottom of the
ocean, both of you should be able to get back to the surface safely. Sit back
and enjoy a very long animated sequence as the game tries to tighten up the
various loose ends in the plot. This sequence ends with you performing some
magic inside the presidential palace.

 PALACE

 As the magic show comes to an end, you go backstage just in time to see Julia
being kidnaped by the guards. You decide to follow them. Next thing you know,
you find yourself in yet another arcade sequence. Needless to say, save the game
first.

 You find yourself in an overhead view of a maze with guards patrolling
everywhere. There are many doors in the maze that can be pivoted 90 degrees each
time you walk into them. Use of these doors and careful timing to trap the
guards will help you make your way to, first, a blinking key, then to a blinking
exit. It is actually kind of fun and not very difficult. If you enjoyed this,
great; there's one more maze immediately following this one. Clearing both
mazes, you'll find yourself in front of a hallway door.

 OPERATE DOOR to open it and enter. This is a big office. The one thing that
should attract your attention is the statue near the desk. EXAMINE the statue.
The arm is a little crooked, isn't it? Well, that is a dead giveaway if I ever
saw one. OPERATE THE STATUE'S ARM and you discover a safe. It's time to put the
safe-cracking device to good use. USE THE ELECTRONIC BOX ON SAFE DOOR. You
should save the game here.

 OPERATE THE VALIDATION BUTTON ON THE BOX to turn it on. Click the up arrow
button on the safe to change the leftmost digit until its LED lights up on the
electronic box. Click the lock combination button on the safe to move to the
second digit. Again, click the up arrow button on the safe until the second LED
lights up on the electronic box. Repeat with the third and fourth digits on the
safe. When you have found the correct fourth digit, click the lock combination
button on the safe one time. The little box should start beeping, indicating
that its work is done. OPERATE THE VALIDATION BUTTON ON THE BOX to turn it off.
TAKE LITTLE BOX, OPERATE THE LOCK COMBINATION BUTTON one more time, and the safe
door opens. The correct safe combination is random. You must use the above
procedure to open it.

 Hey, there's the envelope again, the one you found in the safe-deposit box! How
did it end up here? TAKE envelope. Oh, no; not only did the envelope end up
here, but so did the KGB agents. You're ambushed by them again. As this is
happening, Otto bursts onto the scene with his guards. One of the KGB agents is
killed; the other one grabs the envelope and runs. Naturally, you go after him
while the guards are going after both of you. This is going to be nasty, so save
the game here.

 The KGB agent is trying to escape by stealing a water scooter and skimming all
over the ocean. You're in hot pursuit on another stolen scooter: Here comes
another arcade sequence.

 While you're skimming over the water with the agent right in front of you, you
have to dodge sharks (or are they rocks?) that come at you from both sides. I
found a trick here that worked quite well. Move the cursor to the right side of
the screen. Click the mouse to bring your scooter to the right and off the
screen completely. Now, no harm can come to you. When the enemy agent stops
moving around and stays still in the middle of the screen, bring your figure
back and run into him. That brings an end to this half of the sequence.

 Once you run into the KGB agent, the game takes over; it shows that you
overpower him and recapture the envelope. But you're not out of the woods yet.
You are now on the water again, and this time, you're being chased by four
guards. Save the game as quickly as you can. My little trick won't work here.
Instead, you have to stay close to the middle of the screen and make quick,
small movements to dodge the guards as they try to ram you from both sides. This
is really quite difficult at first, but you can do it easily once you get used
to the patterns and rhythms of the guards.

 SUBMARINE

 If you stay alive long enough in this sequence, you'll escape the guards and
board a submarine. Here, you return the document to your superior, and receive
instructions to go to a secret base and destroy the Stealth plane. Just before
you leave the submarine, "Q" (the special gadget expert) gives you a compact
disk that can destroy the vital computer programming necessary to fly the plane.
He also hands you your special cigarettes. Good luck, Mr. Bond.


 JAMES BOND: THE STEALTH AFFAIR
             Part 3

 OCEAN FLOOR

 Once you're clear of the submarine, save the game. While you're on the ocean
floor, your main threat comes from a huge shark that always appears from the
right side of the screen. It swims straight across and is very fast. If you
happen to be in his path, you're lunch. Luckily, the timing and position of his
appearance are fixed. If you get killed once, you can avoid him after you
restore by simply moving to a different position on the screen.

 Go down one screen. You should be at the bottom of the ocean. Move one screen
left. There are some seaweed plants here. Swim to the one in the center of the
screen. Get as close to its bottom as you can, then EXAMINE the seaweed twice.
That will get you an all-important, "can't finish the game without it" elastic
band. How on earth did I know there was an elastic band HIDDEN in the bottom of
the ocean? Read on.

 After getting the elastic band, move four screens to the right. You may want to
save the game after each screen to protect against an untimely appearance by the
shark. You'll come to a dead-end with two palm trees growing near the middle of
the screen. Palm trees? In the bottom of the ocean? Yup. That's what the game
calls them. EXAMINE the right palm tree. Swim close to the palm tree, OPERATE
THE PALM TREE, and you'll find a button. OPERATE BUTTON and a hole appears to
the right; enter the hole.

 Remember you wanted to know how I knew there was an elastic band in the bottom
of the ocean? Well, if you enter the hole without finding the elastic band
first, the game will give you an inappropriate and blatant message that does not
make much sense, but at least it's a hint for you to go search for one.

 After entering the hole, walk to the right until you see a pothole above you,
then OPERATE POTHOLE. A ladder lowers and you climb up to the surface. Gee, talk
about being at the wrong place at the wrong time. You pull yourself up and find
yourself in the middle of a hangar surrounded by guards: You're caught yet
again.

 HEADQUARTERS

 The guards put you inside a locked cage suspended by a cable over a tub of
man-eating piranhas. The cage is slowly being lowered into the tub. As soon as
the guards leave, USE PEN ON THE LOCK OF THE CAGE DOOR. (Move the cursor around
the middle of the cage until you find the lock.) The manual tells you that the
pen contains an acid that can dissolve most metals. Now what? Well, remember
reading in the manual about the steel cable in your watch?

 USE THE WATCH ON THE WALL at the top right of the screen and a steel cable
shoots out and attaches to the wall. That still does not seem to quite do the
trick. USE THE WATCH ON THE WALL on the wall at the top left of the screen.
Another steel cable shoots out and attaches to the opposite wall. Now, maneuver
your character to the right, just past the vent grill. Do not go too far or
you'll fall off. OPERATE the grill to open it, and go inside.

 Save the game here. You're into another maze game, more difficult this time
because the entire maze is in darkness, and you can see only a small circle of
the immediate area where your character is situated. Instead of guards, this
maze is populated by rats; you can see their red eyes as they roam around in the
maze. The objective is the same: You need to use trap doors and good timing to
get to the blinking wrench, then to the blinking exit. If you succeed, you get
to do it again in another maze. Surprisingly, these mazes aren't as difficult as
they appear.

 Once you get past both mazes, you'll end up in a bathroom with showers. There's
a soldier here brushing his teeth. OPERATE SOLDIER and you knock him out! TAKE
NAPKIN near the mirror and USE THE NAPKIN ON THE SOLDIER. You gag him with the
napkin so he can't call for help. EXAMINE army boots on the floor, TAKE ARMY
BOOTS, TAKE laces, and USE laces on the soldier to tie him up. TAKE THE CLOTHES
on the bench. Once you have both the boots and the clothes, the game will take
over, and you'll change into the soldier's uniform in one of the showers.
EXAMINE the sink and TAKE THE GLASS on the sink.

 Exit the bathroom through the door at the bottom of the screen. Go left and
around the bend to the next screen. Enter the door in the middle of the screen.
OPERATE THE SECOND LOWEST DRAWER on the left, then EXAMINE the drawer. TAKE
LACES and USE LACES ON JAMES. Your boots are now tied with the new laces.
OPERATE THE BOTTOM DRAWER on the right. EXAMINE the drawer, TAKE BLANK STAMP,
and exit the room.

 You may notice that there's another door here facing left. This is the door
that leads to the piranhas. You certainly don't want to relive that experience
again, do you? Follow the hallway to the right, go to the next screen, and enter
the door in the center of the screen.

 EXAMINE the clothes lying on the bed. TAKE THE MISSION INSTRUCTIONS and USE THE
GLASS ON THE WATER FOUNTAIN at the lower right edge of the screen. Exit the
room, go right, around the corner, and up to the next screen.

 Here, you encounter an officer and several soldiers. The officer orders you to
bring him a glass of water. Before you have a chance to say, "I've got it right
here," the game kicks you back to the previous screen. Go up to reenter the
screen. All the soldiers have disappeared, including the officer. Gee, that's
fast. Go left one screen, enter the first door you come to, and save the game.

 Notice that the officer who wanted the glass of water is sitting behind a desk.
Also notice there's a stamp (one that uses ink, not a postage stamp) on the left
corner of the desk. USE THE FULL GLASS ON THE OFFICER. The game will walk your
character closer to the desk before the glass is given to the officer. As your
character is moving, quickly select TAKE and move the cursor over the stamp. As
soon as the officer takes the glass and starts drinking, click your mouse to
activate the command. If you do everything right, you'll switch the officer's
stamp with the blank stamp, and he'll be none the wiser. But you must be pretty
quick here: When the officer finishes with the glass, he will tell you to leave.
Exit the room.

 Go right one screen, down one screen, and enter the door. You're back in the
room where the water fountain is. There's a control board at the upper right
edge of the screen. Just below it in a black area there's a garbage dump.
OPERATE GARBAGE DUMP and you'll find an inflatable lifeboat. TAKE LIFEBOAT. Now,
select TAKE again. Move your cursor slowly over the area, just to the right of
the armchair, until you find the inkpad. You won't see it, but the game will
tell you when the cursor is over it. TAKE THE INKPAD. (Note that the inkpad
won't even be there until AFTER you have taken the officer's stamp.)

 USE THE OFFICER'S STAMP WITH THE INKPAD to ink the stamp. USE THE INKED STAMP
WITH THE MISSION INSTRUCTIONS to get an authorized mission instruction. OPERATE
THE CIGARETTE CASE in your inventory to open it to reveal four cigarettes.
EXAMINE all the cigarettes. The first one should have a blue ring on it; the
fourth one should have a red ring on it. The manual tells you that the first one
is for revealing fingerprints, while the fourth one has a mini-rocket in it.
OPERATE THE FIRST CIGARETTE to get cigarette paper. OPERATE CIGARETTE PAPER ON
GLASS to get the fingerprint of the officer. You're now ready for the finale.

 ENDGAME

 Exit the room, go right around the corner, and onto the next screen. USE
FINGERPRINT ON THE FINGERPRINT READER just to the left of the security door.
Stand in front of the door and enter when it opens. Follow the hallway to the
right and enter the next door. USE THE AUTHORIZED MISSION ON THE MAIL SLOT just
to the left of the guard. He will deactivate the force field and open the next
door for you; enter it.

 You're in another hallway similar to the first one except there's a trash can
at the end of this one near another door. There's also an electric socket right
next to the trash can. (Actually the game describes it as an electric plug which
doesn't sound right to me.) Well, that should be an obvious clue. USE THE
ELECTRIC CABLE (from your razor) ON THE ELECTRIC SOCKET. OPERATE THE RAZOR to
make sure it's turned on. USE THE RAZOR ON TRASH CAN to hide the razor. Enter
the door for the final confrontation.

 You should save the game here just in case your timing is off the first time.
Otto is here, guarding Julia. Dr. Why -- the brain behind the Stealth Affair --
is here: the UBG (ultimate bad guy) in the game. When possible, select USE and
the LAST CIGARETTE in your inventory. Position the cursor on the computer
console to the right (not the one with the CD player). Then, just relax and
enjoy the various scenes showing the Stealth plane taking off. Soon, your razor
cassette recorder will be playing the self-destruct joke again, thus creating a
diversion. As soon as the diversion begins, click repeatedly until your
cigarette rocket is fired. Wait until it completes its flight path and destroys
the computer console to your right. Now, very quickly, OPERATE OTTO and get into
a fistfight with him. You must do this quickly, or Otto will put a bullet right
between your eyes.

 While you're occupied with Otto, Dr. Why will leave the command center, taking
Julia with him. When you're finished with Otto, the first thing you need to do
is to USE THE COMPACT DISK ON THE CD PLAYER. That disables the computer
programming that guides the plane, and allows the plane to be easily destroyed.
Quickly, move to the door on the top left of the screen and leave the command
center. If you dally too long, you'll die when the whole center blows up.

 Once you leave the command center, the next sequence is automatic. So just sit
back and watch. Dr. Why throws Julia on the ground and is getting into his
helicopter. You rush forward just as the helicopter is taking off. Both you and
Julia manage to hang onto the bottom of the helicopter and are lifted off the
island. The next scene shows the island exploding and sinking with the
helicopter barely escaping. As soon as the next scene appears, save the game
IMMEDIATELY.

 You only have two or three seconds to make a move, so you really have to be
quick about it. USE THE ELASTIC BAND ON THE BOMB which should be above and
slightly to your right. You and Julia will fall from the helicopter. You have
two screens to fall before you reach the ocean and get eaten by the sharks.

 Wait a minute...you mean I've walked you through this whole game just so you
can watch Julia and yourself being eaten by sharks? Oh, sorry; there's one last
move I forgot to give you. During those two screens where you're falling towards
the ocean, OPERATE THE LIFEBOAT in your inventory. There, happy now? Relax and
enjoy the conclusion!
