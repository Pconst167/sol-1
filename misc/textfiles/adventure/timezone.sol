             WELCOME!!! 

TO THE COMPLETE SOLUTION OF THAT EPIC
OF EPICS, "TIME ZONE" !

THANKS TO: SPLIT INFINITY BBS

MADE PRESENTABLE BY:  THE MERCENARY

***************************************

Wow, this is a big sucker!  Hats off to
Ken and Roberta Williams.  It seemed 
like it took forever just to write the 
tutorial for this massive adventure... 
It must have been an eternity writing  the code to program it.  One can believe that it took the year they 
claim.  But the effort put in
by those pioneers of the graphic  adventure certainly paid off, and
I doubt another adventure of this scope
and caliber will be seen for many years to come.

Well, enough of the editorializing...on
with the tutorial.

First of all, there are a number of  time 'zones' that are dead ends...
red herrings to frustrate your solving 
of the adventure.  They are as follows:

all time periods in Antarctica (you  freeze your buns off in all of them!)

Australia  1400 AD
Africa  1700 AD
Africa  2082 AD
South America  2082 AD
Alaska  50 BC
South America  1700 AD
South America  1400 AD
South America  50 BC
North America  1000 AD 

In each of these zones, you inevitably 
get killed or end up finding nothing
of value to aid in your final objective
on Neburon.

Also, I have not included a trip to  Australia 50 BC, where you find a
rhea egg which, with a shovel, you can 
dig up and take.  Using the hat
pin you find in Asia 1700 AD, you can  poke a hole in the egg and use
it to carry water (which is found in  numerous zones) to drink when you 
get thirsty.  This happens in only a  couple of time zones, most importantly
in Africa 1400 AD.  However, I have  found that by following the moves I
describe, you can get back to the  machine before dying of thirst and
therefore you do not need to go to get 
the egg and the water.

As usual, everything between commas  represents each seperate input and
everything in parentheses is a seperate
comment not to be inputted into the
game.  Also, I have preceded each zone 
with its title.  These titles
are enclosed in >brackets< and should  not be inputted into the game.
Also, most of the time when you input  'look', it is only there to pass some
time in order for something to happen.
Don't expect to find something new 
whenever you input 'look'.

This is a massive adventure, so I warn 
you to save the game often!!  I suggest
that you save it after each zone you  solve.  While I have taken pains to
assure that this tutorial is accurate, 
I have an early version of the game
and newer versions may have changed  things slightly.  I may have also missed a typo or two, so please let the sysop know if you have run into a discrepancy in the directions given... I will try to update any faults in this tutorial.

Of course, follow all instructions on  disk switching when going from zone
to zone....

Here goes!...
