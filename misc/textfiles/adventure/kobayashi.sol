			KOBAYASHI NARU (Mastertronic 1987)
			----------------------------------
Please be aware of the fact that this game (like the closely related Shard of Inovar, by the same authors, I think) hardly makes _ANY_ sense at all; it does, however, have loads of silly spelling (klam, omask, scimitax?? Come on, guys, buy a dictionary!). Game on!


(You start at the three gates)

                            KNOWLEDGE

GET SCIMITAX, S, ASCEND TREE, ANALYSE TREE (you notice some pods), DESCEND TREE, THROW SCIMITAX AT STEMS, GET POD, ANALYSE PLANT (there is a leaf on it), GET LEAF, N, E, ACTIVATE POD, THROW POD AT MAW (the plant hurls you over the barrier), S, GET FLOWER, USE LEAF (against the gas), N, ASCEND OBELISK, JUMP BARRIER, W, W, W, N.


				  WISDOM

ACTIVATE SOLANCE, PULL SOLANCE (it slices through the metal), N, ANALYSE TUNNEL, ANALYSE CLIFF (you see the Omask), GET OMASK, USE OMASK (against the gass in the tunnel), ACTIVATE SOLANCE (it deactivates), E, E, E, ACTIVATE SOLANCE, CUT ANTENNAE (the creature disappears), E, E, E, SWIM WATER, SWIM KLAM, GET PEARL, USE SOLANCE (it keeps the klam open), SWIM WATER, ASCEND KLAM, PUSH BOULDERS (they create a path), DESCEND CLIFF, S, E.


                          UNDERSTANDING
