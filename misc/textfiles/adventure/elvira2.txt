                      ELVIRA II: THE JAWS OF CERBERUS 
 
  PICK YOUR OCCUPATION, NOT YOUR NOSE 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  When the game begins, you'll be asked whether you want to restore a saved 
  game. If you choose not to restore a saved game, then you'll have to 
  pick your occupation (see OCCUPATIONS below). When you restore a saved 
  game, your occupation remains the same as it was when you saved the 
  game. 
 
  OCCUPATIONS 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Your stats are set at the beginning of the adventure, when you select 
  your occupation. Here's what you start with: 
 
 
  OCCUPATION      WS      ACC     WP      MR      PR      CON   STR   INT 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Stuntman        10      6       10      6       9       8      10     6 
  Private Eye      9      9       9       8       8       9       8     9 
  Programmer       6      8       6      10      10       6       6    10 
  Knife Thrower    8     10       8       8       6      10       9     8 
 
  These numbers increase as you gain experience and may change with 
  different circumstances. Naturally, stats increase at different rates 
  depending on your occupation. For your latest health report, click on 
  the body icon on the right side of the screen 
 
 
                           THE MAIN SCREEN 
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  The Action Window 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  If you've ever seen a movie, you know what the action window does. (If 
  you've never seen a movie, then you probably aren't from around here, 
  and probably have no business playing with computers, either). This is 
  where the fun happens ... blood, gore, mayhem, death, blood, paranormal 
  phenomena, battle with goons from the great beyond, blood, plunder, 
  carnage ... did I mention that there's blood? 
 
  Moving Around 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  *       Click on the direction arrows at the lower right of the main 
          screen to move forward, back, left, right, turn around, or climb 
          up or down. 
 
  *       If you want to move toward an object, click directly on the 
          object to move in closer. 
 
  *       To open a closed door, just click on it. 
 
  Looking at Stuff 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  If you see something in the action window that you want to know more 
  about, here's what you do: 
 
  1       Click on the object, then drag it into your inventory 
  2       Click on the object again 
  3       Click directly on the examine box 
  4       Read all about the object 
 
  If you're able to do other stuff with the object you've selected these 
  options will appear just below the examine command. For more about this, 
  read the command menu section. 
 
  Getting to Know the Locals: Conversations 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Sometimes you get lucky, and somebody you meet will actually want to 
  talk to you instead of disemboweling you. When the person or thing in 
  the action window is interest in chatting, a mouth icon appears at the 
  right of the screen. Here's what to do: 
 
  1       Click on the mouth icon 
  2       Read the dialog options that appear 
  3       Click on the desired dialog option 
  4       Wait for response and more dialog options 
  5       Repeat this procedure from step 2 until encounter ends 
 
  Souvenir Collecting 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  *       Click the suitcase icon in the upper right corner to bring up 
          your inventory 
  *       To add something to your inventory, simply drag it from the 
          action window down onto the message box, or the suitcase icon 
  *       To use an item in your inventory, click on the item, then select 
          the option that appears on the right side of the screen. Some 
          objects can be dragged from your inventory and used on an object 
          in the action window in order to complete an action sequence. 
 
  You can carry an amazing amount of stuff, so feel free to help yourself 
  to anything that isn't staked down. On the other hand, greed doesn't 
  always pay - in fact, it can cost you plenty in strength. If you're 
  expecting unpleasant company and want to travel light, go ahead and drop 
  some of your goodies, they'll still be there when you get back. 
 
  Direction Arrows: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Without these arrows, you ain't going nowhere. Wherever you are, look at 
  the highlighted yellow arrows in this area to find out what your 
  movement options are. 
 
  The Tell-Tale Heart: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  That beating heart on the main screen represents the current state of 
  your body. The beating speeds up if you panic, and slows down as you get 
  a grip on yourself. If you get hurt, it slows way down. If it stops, 
  you're dead. 
 
  The number next to the heart is what you want to keep an eye on. It is a 
  sum of all the individual hit points from the various parts of your 
  body. 
 
  "The Corpus Delectable" (Health Status Indicator): 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  The guy in the top left corner of the screen is YOU or at least, a 
  reasonable facsimile. This is your health status indicator. The size of
  the little lines coming out of him tell you how many hit points each area 
  of the body can take before you die. Here's how you die: 
 
  *       You've been beaten about the head and shoulders so relentlessly 
          that you're down to 0 hit points for the head or chest area. 
  *       The skin and muscles and guts are ripped, tendon and sinew, off 
          your fragile mortal frame (arms and legs have been hacked off.) 
 
  If that wasn't enough for you, here's what happens if you should lose a 
  single limb: 
 
  *       If the hit point total in one of your legs drops to 0, then your 
          movement will become sluggish until you get some healing done. 
  *       If you lose an arm, then your carrying capacity drop. 
 
  Seismic Activity Sensor: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  The motion sensor is a little gadget that can help you find 
  unfriendlies before they find you. As you move, the sensor will lose 
  its mind. But as soon as you stop moving, the sensor will scan the area 
  and display any movement in the vicinity. 
 
  Spellchecker: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  This gadget will let you know which spells you've got running at the 
  moment. You can have any number of spells going at one time. 
 
  Suitcase: 
  ~~~~~~~~~ 
  When you click on the suitcase icon an inventory of everything you're 
  carrying appears. 
 
  Room Scanner: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Click this icon and all the stuff you've discovered so far in the room 
  appears in a message box. In addition, all items that have been dropped 
  will appear. 
 
  Spellthrower: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Click on this box to display all your mixed and ready-to-cast spells. 
  Once displayed, simply click on the spell to cast it. 
 
  Spellbook: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Click this box to view the spellbook, which will enable you to mix 
  spells 
 
  Combat Weapon Box: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Click on this icon anytime to alter your style of fighting. 
 
  Hit Point Indicator: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Each time you smite your opponent with a weapon, this gauge gives you 
  an indication of the severity of the blow. 
 
  Damage Indicator: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  This gauge gives you an analog indication of how much damage you sustain 
  from each of your opponent's blows. 
 
  Command Menu: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Whenever you click on an item, you will be given a choice of actions to 
  take with that item. These actions will appear to the right of the main 
  viewing area. Click on the desired action to execute the action. 
 
  The Stats Bar: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  LEV - Level. Lets you know how well you're doing in your quest. As you 
  gain experience points, you will move up in levels and be able to mix 
  more powerful spells, fight hand-to-hand more effectively, increase your 
  stats and ultimately get closer to Elvira. 
 
  EXP - Experience. This number increases as you play and slay. It also 
  relates directly to your level. 
 
  PP  - Power Points. The more power points you have, the more spells you 
  can cast before a recharge. 
 
  HP  - Hit Points. Maximum hit points for your character. 
 
  Secondary Stats: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  WS    - Weapons Skill. Determines how lethal you are with your weapon. 
  ACC   - Accuracy. Determines the likely hood of hitting your target 
  WP    - Will Power. Determines the amount of guts you have 
  MR    - Magic Resist. Determines how susceptible you are to supernatural 
          charms. 
  STR   - Strength. Determines how hard you can hit 
  CONST - Constitution. Determines your total hit points and will lower 
          the damage you take from attacks. 
  PR    - Poison Resist. Determines resistance to deadly doses. 
  INT   - Intelligence. Determines power points and the number of spells 
          you get out of each mixing. 
 
  COMBAT 
  ~~~~~~ 
  As soon as an opponent appears on screen, your pointer will change into a 
  combat icon. Click on the combat weapon box to bring up a choice of 
  four combat modes. 
 
  *       Normal: Turns cursor into a sword. No advantage for either 
          fighter. 
  *       Defensive: Turns cursor into a shield. Less chance of hitting or 
          getting hit. 
  *       Fierce: Turns cursor into a lightning bolt. Better chance of 
          hitting and getting hit. 
  *       Berserk. Turns cursor into a viking helmet. Change of hitting 
          and getting hit is very great. 
 
  How to fight: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  1       Click on a choice, and the cursor will turn into the weapon 
  2       Move the weapon onto your opponent 
  3       Position the cursor over the part of the opponent's body that 
          you wish to attack, then click to slash away. Each evil critter 
          will be easier to hit in some areas than others. 
 
  Active & Inactive Weapons: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  When the cursor changes into a weapon or shield, it will appear either 
  white or black. When it is WHITE, the selected weapon is active. When it 
  is BLACK, your weapon is in the midst of a hack or slash. 
 
  Running Away: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Sometimes it's better to be a weenie. To run away, back away carefully, 
  then TURN & RUN! 
 
  SPELLCRAFTING 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Lesson One: To get even the most basic spell off the ground, you need 
  four things: 
 
  1       My Spellbook 
  2       The right ingredients to mix the spell 
  3       The level, experience, and opportunity to cast it 
  4       My red pendant 
 
  Get the Spellbook! 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Make sure to get my spellbook when you first enter the studio. If you 
  don't, you'll probably be mashed into dog chow shortly after you get past 
  the main gate. 
 
  About Spell... 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Each spell has 3 requirements that must be fulfilled before it can be 
  created. These requirements are listed under each spell in the 
  spellbook. The effect is also listed. The three requirements are: 
 
  *       Level: Each spell has a level number listed. You must be at that 
          level or higher before being eligible to create that spell. 
  *       Cost: The number of power points burned after each application 
          of a spell is listed 
  *       Ingredients: You must have all ingredients needed for a 
          particular spell in your inventory 
 
  Mixing a Spell: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Once you've got my book, you can click on the book icon in the upper 
  right of the screen any time to refer to it. There are eight spells on 
  each page, and dozens of spells in all. 
 
  *       To turn an index page: Click the book icon at the top left of 
          the page 
  *       To choose a spell for mixing: Turn to the correct index page and 
          click directly on the spell name. This brings up the description 
          of the spell, the level you need and the list of ingredients you 
          need to make it 
  *       To return to the spellbook index: Click on the book icon in the 
          upper right side of the spellbook page without mixing a spell on 
          screen. You may now choose another spell. 
  *       To mix the spell: 
 
          1       Click the mix icon at the top left of the page. Your 
                  inventory will appear. 
          2       Drag each of the ingredients from the inventory up to 
                  the page and let go. 
          3       When you've got all the items on the page, click the mix 
                  icon again. The new spell will appear as an icon in your 
                  inventory. There's no limit to the number or ready-mixed 
                  spells you can carry. 
 
  *       To exit the spellbook index: Click on exit. 
 
  Casting a Spell: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  Once your first pre-mixed spell is in the bag, a new icon - the 
  spellthrower - appears in the upper right of the screen. Click this 
  icon, and your spells appear. Click the spell you want, and it's 
  automatically cast. 
 
  Fun Facts About Spells: 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
  *       Some spells can only be used once. After you use them their 
          icons disappear forever. 
  *       Some spells can be used over and over again. 
  *       Your currently active spells appear in the spellchecker at the 
          lower left of the screen. 
  *       If a spell disappears from the spellchecker list, it's run its 
          course. The same goes if you've got a spell running, but it 
          doesn't appear to be doing you any good. 
  *       The name of the spell is a good clue on what ingredients it may 
          need. 
  *       Double click on a spell icon to find out which spell it is and 
          how many charges are left.
