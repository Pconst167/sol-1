             The Solution to The Tracer Sanction
             -----------------------------------

      Direct commands will be portrayed in brackets, (ie. [GET DUCK] ).

Directional commands will be abbreviated as follows:

               [N] = North          [E] = East          [U] = Up
               [S] = South          [W] = West          [D] = Down


    When you first start out, you are on the planet Mongo, the first command you
type is [TALK MAN], from there you proceed [E], [N], [BUY 500], [E], [BUY CHART]
[W], [N], [N], [S], [GET ALL], [WEAR PACK], [N], [TURN POINTER TO SONEX], [PUSH
BUTTON].  Now you have arrived on the planet Sonex, from your ships cockpit, you
will travel [E], [S], [S], [S], [E], [N].  Here you arrive at a shop that buys
gems.  If you recall, when you first start out, you are given a gem (along with
1000 sols).  Thus you [SELL GEM], [S], [W], [N], [N], [BUY 800], [N], [N], [TURN
POINTER TO JUBILEX], [PUSH BUTTON].  (Great name for these planets -huh? ).

From the cockpit you enter [E], [S], [S], [S], [S], [GO HUT], [GET BATTERY], [W]
[GIVE SUIT].  If you don't give the suit then the hermit will take the solar
battery.  [S], [GET SHOVEL], [E], [E], [GO CAVE], [YELL], [N], [GET DIAMOND],
[DIG], [W].  When you wake up, the computer says that you see a man in a purple
robe running off into the distance.  This man, as we will later find out is
'Wing' , the man that we are looking for.  [W], [W], [N], [N], [N], [N], [BUY
800], [N], [N], [TURN POINTER TO SONEX], [PUSH BUTTON].  In the adventure, the
reason we come back to Sonex is because we must sell the diamond to the jewler.
Thus we proceed to the jewlers shop once more. [E], [S], [S], [S], [E], [N],
[SELL DIAMOND], [S], [W], [N], [N], [BUY 1500], [N], [N], [TURN POINTER TO
BRENON I], [PUSH BUTTON].  This will be the last time we go to Sonex but we will
be returning to Jubilex in a later part of the adventure.  [S], [DROP SHOVEL],
[DROP CHART], [N], [E], [S], [S], [W], [W], [N], [N]. This guy looks like the
type that you must beat at his own game so [SHAKE BRIDGE], [N], [INSERT BATTERY]
[S], [S], [E], [E], [E], [E], [E], [TURN DIAL], [N], [LOOK BUSHES], [N], [GET
ALL], [S], [TURN DIAL], [S], [W], [W], [W], [N], [N], [N], [TURN POINTER TO
EARTH], [PUSH BUTTON].  At last we will be going home, back to Earth!  [S],
[DROP ACE], [GET SHOVEL], [N], [E], [S], [S], [W], [N], [W], [DIG], [GET ROPE],
[E], [S], [W], [W], [N], [W], [S], [GET TORCH], [N], [E], [N], [E], [PULL WORN
BOOK].  That is a lot of sols! [TURN DIAL], [GET SWORD], [N], [S], [E], [N],
[BUY 900], [N], [N], [S], [DROP SHOVEL], [DROP SWORD], [DROP PACK], [N], [TURN
POINTER TO JUBILEX].  (Here we go again, back tracking!) [PUSH BUTTON], [E], [S]
[S], [S], [W], [LIGHT TORCH].  That is a lot of sols to be just laying around,
don't you think?  [E], [N], [N], [BUY 650], [N], [N], [TURN POINTER TO KORANTH].

Finally!  A new planet!  [PUSH BUTTON], [S], [DROP TORCH], [DROP LIGHTER], [DROP
ROBOT], [N], [E], [S], [S], [E], [S], [S], [OPEN GRATE], [D], [S], [W], [TIE
ROPE TO PIPE], [W], [W], [W].  1400 sols!  In this game money seems to be lying
around as stones do.  Nevertheless the adventure is a fun one.  Now to journy
back up the river.  [E], [E], [E], [UNTIE ROPE], (realistic game isn't it
though?) [E], [N], [U], [W], (If you type <HIT MAN> the response is a funny one)
[N], [CLIMB TREE], [S], [E], [N], [N], [W], [N], [BUY 800], [N], [N], [S], [DROP
ROPE], [GET ACE], [N], [TURN POINTER TO METROPOLIS], [PUSH BUTTON], [E], [S],
[S], [W], [N], [N], [OPEN ACCOUNT].  Mind you this account is an intrest free
account.  Talk about a cheap bank! [S], [W], [DEPOSIT 650], [E], [S], [W], [W],
[W], [W], [W], [S], [E], [GIVE BANANA], [GET PEEL], [GET KEY], [W], [N], [E],
[E], [E], [E], [S], [S], [S], [S] (long alley!) [E], [E], [S], [WITHDRAW 650]
[N], [W], [W], [W], [W], [N], [E], [BET 650], [CHEAT].  By god, we are a sorry
lot, taking banana peels from the zoo and cheating at a game of cards, will we
ever change our ways?   NAH!!! [W], [S], [DROP PEEL] (We also play dirty) [E],
[E], [E], [E], [S], [DEPOSIT 1950], [N], [W], [W], [N], [N], [N], [N], [E], [N],
[W], [WITHDRAW 1950], [E], [S], [E], [N], [BUY 1600], [N], [N], [S], [DROP ACE],
[DROP CARD], [GET SWORD], [GET ROBOT], [N], [TURN POINTER TO KORANTH] (Koranth?)
[PUSH BOTTON], [TURN POINTER TO DARTEN], [PUSH BUTTON], [E], [S], [S], [E].  Now
we come to a part of the adventure that is most frustrating yet silly in a way,
just be patient and hang in there for we are almost done with the adventure.
[PUSH BUTTON], [PULL BUTTON], [TWIST BUTTON], [TURN BUTTON], [HIT BUTTON], [PUSH
BUTTON].  Whoooo, at least we got that out of the way.  Now to venture onward.
[UNLOCK DOOR], [INSERT SWORD], [E], [FOLLOW EGNAD] (What a name!  It's almost as
funny as Tip O'Niel!!!) [W], [W], [W], [W], [W], [TALK WING], [S], [REMOVE
BATTERY], [CHARGE BATTERY], [INSERT BATTERY], [N], [E], [E], [E], [E], [FOLLOW
EGNAD], [S], [S], [S], [W], [N], [BUY 400], [N], [N].  Now we journy upon the
last leg of the adventure.  Through all the back-tracking and the cheating, the
end is in sight.  [TURN POINTER TO VALKYRON], [PUSH BUTTON]. And now for the
last command of the game......[E].
