                               Ha, ha.)
                   7  333   Slide paper under door

                            points.  You can get 5 more points if you
                            take the bell back after the cat uses it. 
                            I presume this accounts for the last 5
                            points.


I would like to acknowledge the help of Bob Anderson and Charles
Freeman in getting through the game.
