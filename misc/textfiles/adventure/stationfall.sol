Note:  You  will  get  hungry (Eat 'goo' or 'nectar'; drop kit when food is
depleted),  and  sleepy (get on bed in any Barracks and 'WAIT'), and may be
attacked  by  Plato  (SAY 'FLOYD, HELP' 4 times) at random times. Also, you
must leave the room if a Welder approaches.

It is necessary to make an accurate map of your travels as, if there are no
physical  directions  between the end of a section - in this solution - and
the beginning of the next section, then you must make your way via your map
to  the  point  where the solution continues. This is necessary when any of
the actions, mentioned in the preceding paragraph, occur.
