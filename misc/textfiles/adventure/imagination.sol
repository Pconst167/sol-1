IMAGINATION - SOLUTION - TYPED BY VAXALON - 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1)Talk to the Timelord and read notice.
2)Fill bucket with coal.
3)Examine the window in the pod then enter VIEW.
4)Give the map to the mother of weather and she will change the wind in the
  airfield.
5)Examine the bull outside the citadel then return to rear gunner and aim
  the gun then fire the gun.
6)Paint the cord with the black paint then the Japanese soldier thinks
  you're a black belt!
7)Take the bucket of hot coals to deep in the forest of Mildew and drop
  it. The snow will melt revealing some grass. Take this to cow and feed it.
  Then milk cow. Give creamy icicle to child in forest. She will let you
  have the yoyo.
8)Play the yoyo over the bottomless pit. It picks up a key that fits the cell
  in the citadel dungeon.
9)Take the bread from the cell in the citadel dungeon and feed the bat in
  the caverns of Doobris. The bat will press the switch which will enable
  the auto food dispenser in the Jupiter Ship.
10)Take the chips drop the dispenser and drop them in the airfield and if
  the wind is in the right direction (see hint 4) the dogs will run to them
  and allow you to enter the base.
11)Dig with the spade in the airfield and take the gloves. They will allow
  you to hold the unlimited livers poker and in turn allow you to climb the
  ladder in the platform maze.
12)Use the pickaxe to hit rocks near the mole and fill the can with oil.
  Oil the gun in the tank and fire gun. If you have read the plaque in the
bell tower you will then know what to do!
