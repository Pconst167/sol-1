THE COUNT (Scott Adams)
-----------------------
This game is a real pain getting through, because it relies so heavily on timing. 
There isn't really a great deal to do, which means that you spend most of the time 
waiting. Well, anyway, a few notes:

1. The cigarettes: make sure to get the PACK, not just one cigarette! The pack may 
be hidden in the closet to prevent it from being stolen, but it's not necessary.
2. You can't avoid getting bitten by the Count!
3. Certain aspects of the game are randomized, so if the postcard/package arrive 
too late in the day, try re-scheduling or restore your game
4. Eating the tablets and lighting the torch are a matter of timing. The 
suggestions below are just that: suggestions. Try to eat the tablet when the sun 
starts to set and you'll have plenty of time.
