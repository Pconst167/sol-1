                                   Might and Magic III Hints

TO BEGIN WITH: I think that Might and Magic III is one of the best adventure games I have ever playe(due to its immense size and color graphics). However, my one major problem with it is that it has nalmost infinite supply of riddles, brain twisters, and outright impossible problems that are no fu a all to solve and only detract from the game. For this reason, I am typing up this sheet of cluesforpeople who are stuck at one small place. Because of the game’s sheer size and number of puzzles,I knw I have left out many clues. However, I hope that this list can help most people who are stuck Addiional note: the M&M III that I am playing is the 256 color Macintosh version--but the codes an hintsshould all be the same.

                             To solve the Cathedral of Carnage:
  This place took a while for me to figure out. There are 2 orbs here (each worth 1 million experien) for which you have to fight and die in order to get. There are three steps to get the orbs (as th rb guardian will tell you) the Lock, the Key, and the Cup.  To solve the Lock: arrange the five heds(in order from west to east) so the first (westmost) head faces North, the next head faces West, he ext North, the next East, and the last head (the eastmost) South. To solve the Key: Tell the guadian“weeds” in response to his question (he will give you 1 million gold, 10,000 gems and a hologra card) To solve the cups: this one is easy to solve, but it’s a killer...literally... just drink frm all f the cups. The westermost cups will eridacate 2 characters, while other cups will stone or kll othe characters. After all this trouble , go back to the orb guardian and tell him “JVC” as the nswer tohis request. Just grab the orbs and give them to the king of your choice.

      To get past pirate queen in D2:
Give her a Prescious Pearl of Youth and Beauty- you can find these in many locations, one of which iin the witch's cavern in D1
  
      The maze from hell:
The maze is easy (especially if you liberally use the 'teleport' spell). The monsters in it are not.inotaurs are hard to hit, and they take (generally) 2 'implosion' spells. Medusas are sort of easy,bt very annoying. In the center of the maze, you can find a fountain that will make you an UltimateAdenturer, and in the Northeast area you will find the Minotaur King and a hologram card.

      To win the Tomb of Terror:
This place was hell!  In order to win, you must arrange the center room so that there are 4 granite ads in the corners, and 4 energy fields between the heads. There are 16 levers used to accomplish ti-2 levers per head/energy field. My only useful advice would be for you to map out which levers chng which heads-draw a rough map of this tomb, and mark which levers change which heads. When only te crner slots are granite heads in the middle room, step into the center to be teleported to the Mumy Kng.

     To win the game:
You will need: 1 blue priority pass card, all of your characters to be Ultimate Adventures (to achie this, go the the Maze From Hell), 1 pyramid pass card, hologram sequencing cards 001-006 (or 007 -Idon't know which one), and some pretty good characters (at least level 60)
To get the blue priority pass card: give 11 orbs of power (found in pyramids or various caverns) to ur king or choice
To get the hologram cards: Go everywhere (generally, cards are found at the end of an especially difult cavern)
When you have all these, just go into the pyramid on the Isle of Fire, go to through the NorthWest dr, break down a few walls, and head to the left, and enter the unmarked teleporter. The ending willpesent itself.
