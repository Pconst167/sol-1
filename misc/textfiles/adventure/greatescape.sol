Okay, now seriously. More or less. Hello, all the ex-C64 users! You are reading a solution (in a way... it's more of a collection of hints that should let you complete the game) to "The Great Escape" for the C64. This solution was written by me. Who's "me"? Me is me, and my name is Jaromir Król. "Translate" it to Jeremy King if you wish, although names should not be translated, and anyway, this translation is not exactly correct. :) If you are thinking about the C64 JokEmulator now, you are absolutely right - I am the one guilty of writing it. You may get it from its official site on: http://www.kki.net.pl/jaromirk/c64joke/C64joke.htm. And you may contact me at: jaromirk@kr.onet.pl. All right, the commercials are over - let's play the game now. 
Oh, a word of explanation - I did not finish the game myself. Hey, don't blame me, I didn't even know about this game until I read its review, and the review already contained a full solution! The review - and the solution - were printed in a computer mag named "Bajtek" (that would translate to something along the lines of "Bytey" :) ), but I can't remember its author. Anyway, let's get to the point, the point being the walkthrough. It may contain some errors, but it shouldn't. Even though it's been a few ears since I played this game, I still remember it well, so I think the solution will work. What I wrote here is based on what I can remember from "Bajtek" and my own experiences from the game. :)

All right then... In the game you will play a pilot captured by the Germans during World War II and put in a prison camp. Your object is to - guess what? Yep, perform the Great Escape. And here is how you can do it:

I will start with the descriptions of the objects you can find in the game. Then I will tell you how to make that not-so-great escape. Let us start with the basics then. These are the objects that you will find in the game:


- Food - well, what could it be for...? :) Find it inside the buildings.
- German uniform - you will find it in the buildings. Use it to disguise yourself and the guards will let you in almost anywhere. Herr Kommandant will recognise you, though, so beware!
- Keys - to open doors, what else! There are 3 of them, and they are scattered around the camp. One is under the watchtower, the other two inside the buildings.
- Lockpick - use it to open doors. Get it in the buildings.
- Map and false ID - you will need these to continue your escape after you get out of the camp. In the buildings.
- Poison - use it on food, then give it to the dogs... Nuff said. It can be found in one of the barracks.
- Radio - catch the forbidden news on it. :) As above.
- Shovel - part of the tunnel under your barrack is blocked, and you will need the shovel to dig your way through. Inside the buildings.
- Torch - use it in the tunnel to find your way. To be found in the buildings.

- The Red Cross parcels should arrive daily (sometimes they may be late... like nowadays :)), and can be found in the buildings. They will always contain useful (and necessary in the escape) objects. These are:
- a bag - arrives in the first parcel.
- a bar of chocolate - give it to a prisoner if you are in trouble, and he will start to run, thus attracting the attention of the guards and allowing you to flee. Arrives in the third parcel.
- a compass - you will need it outside the camp to escape. Arrives in the fourth parcel.
- a pair of shears - you will use them to cut the fence during your Great Escape. Arrives in the second parcel.

All right... now here is what you should do:
- When you have the compass and the shears, get them in the tunnel. Then find the key under the watchtower in downright corner of the camp. Go to the upright corner and open the door. Inside, you will find the lockpick.
- Use the lockpick to open the big door in the upper central part of the camp. Behind it, you will find the map and the false ID. In the same section there is the shovel and the torch, so get them as well. You will also find a second tunnel there. Hide the necessary objects in the hole on the "playground", where you have your morning exercise.
- During the exercise, quickly get the shears and the compass. Cut the fence, and go outside the camp. Leave the compass, and go back in the camp! Wait till the next day. Again, during the exercise, act quickly. Get the map with the false ID, cut the fence, drop the shears, get the compass... and run for it! If you perform Great, you will Escape. Congratulations and all... they will accidentally shoot you later, anyway. Nah, just kiddin'. L8R. :)
