                 HI ALL! ViRTUAL REALiTY HAS PRODUCED A SOLVE

                                 TO THE GAME

                            "CURSE OF ENCHANTIA"


 SPOIL, SPOIL, SPOIL! Sorry fellows but this is our job. It is not a crime
  for if you're stuck you use it if you're not you don't and have fun
  yourself. So directly to the game itself...


 You begin your quest hanging on the wall and there doesn't seem any way to
  escape. This is really simple. Just shout "HELP!". A strange-looking
  fellow will enter the door and throw you a key. Pick up key and use it on
  cuffs. You are free! But how are you going to leave the room? Try kicking
  the wall. Take clip. Use clip on the keyhole to open the door. Leave this
  fucking room. Pick up aquarium and all precious stones on the floor. Try to
  avoid axes but that doesn't really matter. Leave the tower by going west.
  WOW!!! Just don't think that the game is over by now. It is simply the way
  they created the scenery. When you are under water wear aquarium. Free fish.
  Wait till it brings you a shell. Pick up shell. There is also a coin behind
  the rock. Pick it up. Go left. You will see a kind of little dump on the
  sea floor. Look in it. Take worm. Go to Mr.Fish and talk to him. Give a worm
  to him. Go left. Give shell to a turtle and it will take you over the
  shocks. Pick up wipe. Fight shark wit a wipe. Go left. When the shell
  closes jump over it. Left again. When you see a big cork operate your wipe
  on it. You ought to be in the cave right now. Pick up grass and push a
  button on the wall. When you're in a cave pick up as many rocks of different
  size as you can and bring them to the stone roller. You will find him
  somewhere on the edge of the cave. Keep on bringing him rocks until he
  gives you a rope. I want mention the direct place of every object for they
  are really simple to find. So find a computer and a branch. The branch is in
  the room with holes. Get branch and grass together. Go to the room with
  a big rock. Take plank and put it on the rock. Now throw computer on plank.
  Take magnet. Jump down. Attach rope to magnet. Go to the room where you got
  the computer and get a roll of wire from the hole using magnet. Go to mud
  creature place and attach wire to hooks. Get mud when creature leaves it on
  wire. Attach mud to grass&branch. Pick up a coin somewhere on the ground.
  Go to the well. It will be repaired by now. Throw coin in the well. You
  can try any of three wishes for fun but what you really need is a helmet. Go
  to the place where rocks are always falling down and wear helmet. When you
  are on the other side enter the room and get in bucket. Wear grass&branch&mud
  and the bucket will be raised. Fresh air at last! GOOD! Go towards town. On
  your way to the town a man will jump out and run at you. When he falls take
  his sword and hit him with it. Take money. Enter town. I am not going to
  draw a map of the town for it is very simple to find stuff in it. Go to
  magician and click your money bag on him. He should send you to mountains.
  This sequence should be really easy to do. Go right. Push big stone and jump
  over it. Take rubber gloves. You will reach an area with four buttons on the
  wall. Press 1,2,3,4 and 3 again: a bridge will come out. Pick up rope. Walk
  near the electric asshole and wear gloves. Avoid stones: to do that you ought
  to stand in free spaces between mountains (You must pick up a little stone in
  one of them). When you reach a large stone hanging over your head, wear small
  stone. Throw bigger stone on large stone. Cross this shit. When near a hole
  throw rope and then jump on it. Continue to the right. Read message on the
  wall and say it aloud. Enter secret passage. Talk to parrot. It will turn you
  into frog and you will find yourself back in town. Go to clothes store and
  give money to shopkeeper. Take dress. Walk in dressing-room and wear dress.
  A door will open. Enter. Take snowball and throw it at big blue dick-head.
  Don't panic, he will fall just like they all do. Go north and find a plank.
  Find a place where the fish is jumping and throw plank on hole. Take fish.
  Find deodorant somewhere in that area. Wear it. Go to chukcha and give him a
  fish. Pick up stick. Go to ice column and fight with a stick. Pick up ashes.
  You have to go by a walrus which is somewhere to the right. You have to do
  that to make him appear in another place. Walk to the very north and then
  left. Walk over walrus and shout "HELP". A little green dick will help you.
  Follow him in the hole. Jump in boat. OOPS!!! Don't pay attention. Throw
  ashes in the water. You will come to an ice castle. At first push the
  biggest icicle then the one which is smaller then the other one which is
  smaller than the previous one and at last the smallest. Enter palace. Take
  broom. Pick up cubes on the table and throw them from now you will have to
  continue throwing them in order to open different doors. You have to find
  the following objects: a gun (use broom to get it, when you got a gun put it
  in holster, a basket will lower so take a piece of glass and bottle of oil
  from it), ice cube, icicle (use broom), magnifying glass, megaphone and a
  jack. When you have all these subjects you will find a whistle in the hall.
  Attach whistle to megaphone and use it on window on the northern wall. Jump
  in hole. You will be in a room with a beam. Put magnifying glass in the
  first hole, ice cube in the second one then icicle and at last piece of
  glass. The beam will explode. Use jack on hole under door. You ought to be
  in a room with queen. When she strikes you with electric balls jump over
  them. Sit on armchair. HA-HA!!! A hand will catch you in the next room,
  don't panic for you are clever enough to wear (FUCK! again this "wear") oil.
  Enter the next room. Enter doors until you find a box of matches. After a
  little walk you will find yourself in a room with a "little", stinking, green
  mother fucker. Walk behind the column and wait until he falls asleep. Then
  come near him and put a match in his foot. Then fight with a box. YO!!!
  Nice jump!!! Take fire-extinguisher. A shopkeeper will come and take you back
  to town. Go to magician and pay him. Har-Har!!! Looks like a pig isn't it?
  Go to the center of the town and then to the left: a bug will let you pass.
  After leaving town go left and pick up a bun of hay then go left again pass
  fire balls and pick up a tray. Return to where you came from. Go down. When
  you see a big nose put a bun of hay in it. HA! Another victory. Pick up a
  sock in a pile, a pen and a stamp. Descend by steps. Pick remote control.
  Go towards ship then to the right. Fill sock with gold. Go near robot and hit
  him with it. Enter ship. You have to cross the stream by putting two planks
  perpendicularly. You ought to put them this way in the middle of the room.
  There is a little dark mark on which you must stand with the first plank to
  the left from the corner. Pick up a list of gold. Leave ship and go to the
  left. Take a tape. Return to mailbox. Pick up letter and attach stamp on it.
  Put letter in the mail box. Go to musicians and put tape in the recorder.
  Hit remote control. Give your tape to a man with a getto blaster. Enter cave
  and shout "HELP!" again. Take spray. Go back to the main screen. Insert an
  access card that man gave you in slot near door. When on cloud you must go
  left and right until you find yourself near thingy. Pick it up. Fall down.
  Go back to cave. A door will appear. Enter. Use spray on wall then use list
  of gold to make a button. Hit button. Throw sack with balls on scheme and
  throw tray to cross it. Pick up ventilator. Open door using clip on lock.
  Go back to town. Go to magician and pay him once more. You will find
  yourself in a coffin. Take bone and fight with it. Pick up shovel. When
  dracula runs at you stand behind the grave from which you have come. What
  an asshole! Pick up discs. Walk to the next screen. When you see that penis
  again come by him and fight him with a shovel. Pick up garlic and cross.Next
  time when you see this putz push a plate on his foot. Eat garlic to scare
  him again. Then draw him away by using the cross. Pick up vacuum-cleaner.
  And at last come to him from the back and play some music with discs. Poor
  vampire will retire because of you, the greatest terrifyer and vampire
  killer. Leave cemetry. Walk along the passage. Push gates in order to open
  them. Then cross the bridge quickly for it will soon ruin. Enter castle.
  Go to the left room and take a ring. Then to the right room. Push a book in
  the second section and it will open a secret passage. Enter. When this
  shitty queen sends a ghost to kill you fight it with vacuum-cleaner. When
  she pulls fire around her hit your fire-extinguisher. And finally when she
  strikes you with flame, fight her with ventilator. She will fall. Come to
  the queen and attach ring to her. WOW!!! Nice job! You have finally finished
  the game.

                                   THE END.
