Problem:
How do I get rid of the witch?
Hint:
Remember  the brass  bottle you  got out  of the  desert temple?
Well, it's time  to use it. Give the brass  bottle to the witch.
She's so  greedy that she'll snatch  up the bottle and  open it.
Stand back and watch her own greed be her demise.

Problem:
What should I get from the witch's house?
Hint:
You'll need  to take the  pouch from her  chest of drawers,  the
spinning wheel from her trunk, and a key from her lantern.

Problem:
That witch keeps turning me into a frog.  How do I protect myself
from her evil magic powers?
Hint:
You'll need  to see the  Gypsy, Madam Mushka.  Give Madam Mushka
the gold coin you got from  the desert temple. She will give you
a  magic amulet  that will   protect you  from the  witch's evil
spells.

Problem:
I've seen a tree with a locked door on it near the witch's house.
How do I open it?
Hint:
Use the key that you got  from the witch's lantern to unlock the
door of the tree.

Problem:
What should I find inside the tree?
Hint:
You  should find  a golden  heart. Take  it and  give it  to the
talking willow tree you saw outside the witch's forest.

Problem:
I've gotten rid of the witch, but now I seem to be trapped in the
witch's forest. How do I get out of here?
Hint:
To get  out of the witch's  forest, go one screen  west from her
house. Select the honeycomb from your inventory, and squeeze the
honey out of  it onto the trail. Then  throw three emeralds onto
the trail.  An elf will appear  and lead you out  of the witch's
forest.

Problem:
What  do I  do with  the spinning  wheel I  got from  the witch's
house?
Hint:
Remember the grandpa  gnome you saw in the  main forest? You now
have  something  that  will  interest  him.  This  is  a special
spinning wheel, which he'll gladly  trade you for his grandson's
marionette.
           
                        The Main Forest
Problem:
Every time I  go into the Swarthy Hog's  Inn, a hardened criminal
knocks me unconscious, throws me  into the basement, and the game
ends. What am I supposed to do here?
Hint:
Unfortunately, you  will have to  be knocked unconscious  by the
disreputable thug  and thrown in  the basement. However,  if you
made friends with the rat  outside the Baker Brothers' Bake Shop
(by throwing  an old shoe at  the mangy cat chasing  him), he'll
free you by gnawing the rope that they've tied you up with. Once
free, take the  rope and use the hammer the  shoe maker gave you
to break the  lock on the door. Go into  the kitchen and get the
leg of  lamb, then exit the  Swarthy Hog's Inn through  the back
door of the kitchen.

Problem:
Where do I get a gold coin to give to the Gypsy, Madam Mushka?
Hint:
You can get  a gold coin from the temple  in the desert. It will
be on the floor beside a brass bottle.

Problem:
Cedric warns  me to stay away  from some bees in  the hollow of a
tree. Should I stay away from those bees?
Hint:
Heed Cedric's advice. After all, you don't want a swarm of angry
bees after  you! However, if  you see a  bear attacking the  bee
tree, offer  your assistance. Remember  the fish you  got out of
the barrel in town? Throw the  fish to the bear. He'll leave the
bees alone and the queen bee will reward you for your kindness.

Problem:
How do I get the dog to stop digging up the ant castle?
Hint:
Be sure to pick up the stick  at the base of the bee tree. Throw
the stick at the dog and  he'll forget all about the ant castle.
And for your kindness, the king of the ants will vow to help you
with your journey later.

Problem:
How can  I get the marionette  from the little gnome  boy and his
grandfather?
Hint:
Do you remember the spinning wheel you got from the witch? Well,
that was  no ordinary spinning wheel!  Offer this spinning wheel
to grandpa gnome and he'll trade you the marionette for it.

Problem:
How can I help both Prince Herbert and the talking tree?
Hint:
You  will find  out that   the talking  tree is  actually Prince
Herbert's  fiance. You  can help  her by  returning her heart to
her. You'll find her heart locked  inside a tree just one screen
east of the witch's house. Once you have the heart, return it to
the  talking  tree.  She'll  turn  into  the  beautiful princess
Alicia. Since  she'll no longer  have a use  for the harp  she's
been playing, she'll  toss it to the ground. Be  sure to pick up
the harp.

Problem:
Where  do  I  get  the  silver  coin  to  buy  a pie at the Baker
Brothers' Bake Shop?
Hint:
You can  find a silver coin  in the streets of  the city. You'll
find it at an alley entrance near the tailor's shop.

Problem:
I've seen a large rat being chased by a mangy cat in front of the
Baker Brothers' Bake Shop. Should I try to help the rat?
Hint:
Yes, throw  the old shoe (you  found beside the skeleton  in the
desert) at the cat. The rat will be so grateful, that he'll help
you later in your journey.

Problem:
How  do  I  get  the  poisonous  snake  away  from the path it is
guarding?
Hint:
When Madam  Mushka's Gypsy caravan  pulled away, they  dropped a
tambourine at  their old campsite.  Shake the tambourine  at the
snake and you'll scare him away.

                          Snowy Mountain
Problem:
I've  come to  a snowy   ledge where  a now-frozen  waterfall has
washed away part  of the path I'm traveling on.  How do I get off
this ledge without dying?
Hint:
Use the  rope you kept (from  the basement of the  Swarthy Hog's
Inn) and  throw it over the  rock on the edge  of the cliff. You
can then climb up the cliff.

Problem:
I've  come to  a snowy   ledge where  a now-frozen  waterfall has
washed away part of the path I'm traveling on. I've tried tying a
rope on the branch above me, but when I climb the rope the branch
breaks. How can I climb the rope without breaking the branch?
Hint:
Don't throw the rope around  the branch. Instead, throw the rope
around the  rock that's sticking  out of the  edge of the  cliff
just above.

Problem:
I'm on the upper trail of  the mountain now and the waterfall has
washed away parts of this trail as  well. How do I join Cedric on
the other side?
Hint:
Carefully walk to the edge of  the cliff and jump onto the small
boulders of  ice protruding from  the frozen waterfall.  You can
hop on  these boulders to  get to the  other side. Once  you get
over there, walk on the log. You've now joined Cedric.

Problem:
Help! Cedric's  been captured by a  wolf! Every time I  run after
him, I slip and fall off the mountain. How can I rescue him?
Hint:
Did you  get the sled  from the  toy  maker in town?  You had to
trade him grandpa gnome's marionette for the sled. Use that sled
here to get down the mountain slope.

Problem:
I've seen  a poor, hungry eagle  outside Queen Icebella's Palace.
What could I give him?
Hint:
Yes. Feed  him the leg  of lamb (that  you got from  the kitchen
cupboard of the Swarthy Hog's Inn). However, be sure Graham eats
some of the lamb before giving the leg to the eagle.

Problem:
Graham is becoming hungry. What can I feed him?
Hint:
Feed Graham some of the lamb before giving the leg to the eagle.

Problem:
Queen Icebella keeps commanding her wolves to kill me.  How can I
avoid this?
Hint:
Remember  the harp  Princess Alicia  dropped?  Well, play it for
Queen Icebella and she'll call off her wolves.

Problem:
How do you kill a Yeti anyway?
Hint:
You  can kill  the Yeti  by throwing  the pie  (you got from the
Baker Brothers'  Bake Shop) into  the Yeti's face.  After you've
killed the Yeti, go into Crystal Cave and get a glowing Crystal.

Problem:
I'm  on a  very confusing  and  windy  path above  a swift  river
coursing its way through a ravine. How do I get out of here?
Hint:
You  will notice  a pool  high up  on the  cliff where Cedric is
sitting. Move  to the opening in  the center of the  cliff below
and Graham will climb the mountain to join Cedric. As soon as he
gets up there,  he'll be captured by Roc and  taken away to this
two-headed bird's nest.

          The Hermit, Ocean Voyage, Island of Harpies
Problem:
I've seen a rusty crowbar on the beach. Should I take it?
Hint:
Yes. You never know when a rusty crowbar will come in handy.

Problem:
I'm at a hermit's house on the  beach. I'm trying to talk to him,
but he's hard of hearing. How can I get him to hear me?
Hint:
To get  the old hermit to  hear what you have  to say, travel to
island of  Harpies and be sure  to pick up a  conch shell on the
beach. You can give the conch shell to him, which he'll use as a
hearing aid.

Problem:
There's a hole in the boat on the beach. How can I repair it?
Hint:
Use the beeswax to repair the hole in the boat. Your boat is now
ready for travel.

Problem:
The  boat,  Cedric,  and  I  keep  getting  eaten  by a giant sea
creature. How can we avoid being eaten?
Hint:
When  you're  traveling  in  the  ocean,  it's  best to map your
journey to the island Harpies. The best way to avoid being eaten
by the sea creature is to travel  a direct route to and from the
island of Harpies. When traveling from the beach where you found
the boat, go  west, west, west, then south.  When returning from
the island of Harpies to the hermit, go west, then south, south,
and south.

Problem:
How do I keep the Harpies from eating me?
Hint:
You can easily  distract the Harpies from killing  you by giving
them an  object you have. Remember  the harp you picked  up from
Princess Alicia?  Well, give it  to one of  the Harpies. They'll
fight over it and that will give you a chance to escape.

Problem:
Cedric's been hurt on the island of Harpies. Where can I take him
to be healed?
Hint:
You'll want  to take Cedric  back to the  Hermit who is  hard of
hearing.  Also, be  sure to  pick up  the conch  shell from  the
beach. You can give the shell to the Hermit, so he can hear you.
He'll heal Cedric by using special poultice herbs.

Problem:
I've seen  a shell on  the beach at  the island of  Harpies. Do I
need it?
Hint:
Yes. You can give the shell to  the Hermit, which he'll use as a
hearing aid. He has many things  to tell you and will assist you
in your journey.
 
                       Mordack's Island
Problem:
I've landed on Mordack's Island. When  I walk up the path leading
to his  castle, two cobra dragon statues kill me.  How  can I get
past them without being fried?
Hint:
Do you remember killing the Yeti for Queen Icebella? Well, after
you killed him, did you get a glowing crystal from Crystal Cave?
Use  the crystal  now to  protect yourself  from these  dragons'
deadly breath!

Problem:
How do I get into Mordack's Castle?
Hint:
Don't go into the castle through the main door. Instead, walk up
the path  on the east  side of the  castle. You will  come to an
opening in the ground covered by a grate. Use the crowbar to pry
open the  grate. You do have  a crowbar, don't you?  If not, you
can find the crowbar one screen west of the hermit's house.

Problem:
I'm lost in a maze inside Mordack's Castle. What am I supposed to
do in here and how do I get out?
Hint:
You will find  two things in Mordack's maze; a  Dink and a door.
When you find the Dink, give him the tambourine you got from the
Gypsy  campsite and  he will   dance a  crazy dance.  While he's
dancing, one of Dink's hairpins will fall to the ground. Use the
Dink's hairpin to open the locked door.

Problem:
I'm in Mordack's supply room. What am I supposed to get here?
Hint:
Get the bag of peas out of the cupboard on the east wall.

Problem:
I'm in Mordack's kitchen and  there's a woman cleaning the floor.
What does she want?
Hint:
Yes. Approach Cassima and give her  the locket that you found in
Roc's nest. In return for your kindness, she will help you later
on.

Problem:
Every  time  I  enter  the  hallway  beside  the  kitchen, one of
Mordack's henchmen captures  me and throws me into  a prison cell
in the basement. How do I get past this henchman?
Hint:
When you see  the henchman coming at you, throw  the bag of peas
at him. He  will slip on the peas  and fall unconscious. Quickly
walk past him into the dining hall.

Problem:
I've been thrown into a prison cell in Mordack's basement. How do
I escape?
Hint:
Do you remember seeing the  woman, Cassima, cleaning the kitchen
floor? Well, you needed to give her the locket that you found in
Roc's nest. Had  you given her the locket,  she'd have freed you
from the prison cell. Also, be sure to look in the rat's hole in
the  prison cell  and get  the moldy  cheese with  the fish hook
(that  you found  on the  island of  Harpies). That moldy cheese
will come in very handy.

Problem:
I'm  trying to  go up  the stairway  beside the  dining room, but
another one of  Mordack's henchmen captures me and  returns me to
the prison cell in the basement. How do I get past this one?
Hint:
This henchman  is a little easier  to get around than  the first
one. Go into the dining room and walk to the northeast corner of
the dining table.  The henchman will try to  block your way. But
he's big and moves very slowly. Quickly walk around to the other
side of the table and walk right past him!

Problem:
I'm sneaking around  Mordack's bedroom and a very  mean cat keeps
alerting Mordack that I'm there. How do I keep this cat quiet?
Hint:
Remember  when you  landed on  Mordack's island  and wrecked the
boat? Well, right  on the beach was a dead  catfish. Did you get
the fish? If  so, throw it at the cat  and while he's eating the
fish carefully  approach him and  trap him in  the empty bag  of
peas. But do be careful, for he's a vicious cat!
 
                  Defeating Mordack

Problem:
I'm in Mordack's study. What's worth reading?
Hint:
Go over to  his desk and take a  look at the old tome.  When you
thumb  through the  pages you'll  acquire the  tiger spell,  the
mongoose spell, the rabbit spell, and the rain cloud spell. Wait
in the study until you see  Mordack return to his bedroom and go
to sleep. Next,  go into his bedroom and take  the wand from his
nightstand.

Problem:
Every time I go into Mordack's laboratory,  he  sees me and kills
me. How do I avoid him killing me?
Hint:
Don't go in the laboratory  when Mordack is there. First, you'll
want to go to Mordack's bedroom  and then to his study. Read the
old tome in his study and wait there. After awhile, Mordack will
return to his bedroom and go  to sleep. Go back into his bedroom
and get the wand from his nightstand. Now you can safely go into
his laboratory.

Problem:
I've got Mordack's wand. Now what?
Hint:
Go up the spiral staircase  and put both Crispin's and Mordack's
wands into  the machine upstairs.  Next, put the  piece of moldy
cheese  (you got  from the  rat's  hole  in the  prison cell  of
Mordack's basement) into the machine.  This will drain the power
from  Mordack's wand  and at  the same  time charge up Crispin's
wand. Finally, remove Crispin's wand from the machine.

Problem:
I've gone up a spiral  staircase in Mordack's laboratory and have
found a machine. How do I use it?
Hint:
Put both  Crispin's and Mordack's  wand into the  machine. Next,
put the  piece of moldy cheese  (you got from the  rat's hole in
the prison  cell of Mordack's  basement) into the  machine. This
will drain  the power from Mordack's  wand and at the  same time
charge up  Crispin's wand. Finally,  remove Crispin's wand  from
the machine.

Problem:
I've successfully  drained Mordack's magical  wand, but now  he's
turned into a giant dragonfly. How do I defeat him?
Hint:
Be sure  to get the spells  by thumbing through the  old tome in
Mordack's  study.  Then  when  Mordack  comes  after  you  as  a
dragonfly, select Crispin's wand  from your inventory. Point the
wand at Mordack  and you'll be able to  select from four spells.
To defeat the dragonfly, select the tiger spell.

Problem:
Mordack has turned himself into a dragon. How do I defeat him?
Hint:
Be sure  to get the spells  by thumbing through the  old tome in
Mordack's study. Then when Mordack  comes after you as a dragon,
select  Crispin's wand  from your  inventory. Point  the wand at
Mordack and you'll  be able to select from  four spells. To foil
Mordack's  plans to  destroy you  this time,  select the  rabbit
spell.

Problem:
Mordack has turned himself into a cobra. How do I defeat him?
Hint:
Be sure  to get the spells  by thumbing through the  old tome in
Mordack's study. Then  when Mordack comes after you  as a cobra,
select  Crispin's wand  from your  inventory. Point  the wand at
Mordack and you'll be able to select from four spells. To defeat
the cobra, select the mongoose spell.

Problem:
Mordack has turned  himself into a ring of fire.  How do I defeat
him?
Hint:
Be sure  to get the spells  by thumbing through the  old tome in
Mordack's study. Then when Mordack comes  after you as a ring of
fire, select Crispin's wand from  your inventory. Point the wand
at Mordack and you'll be able to select from four spells. Select
the  rain cloud  spell and  you'll rid  your kingdom of Mordack.
Congratulations! You've won King's Quest V.
