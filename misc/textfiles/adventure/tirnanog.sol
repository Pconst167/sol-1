TIR NA NOG - TIPS - TYPED BY VAXALON - 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Starting from the Altar of the Seal, walk right until in the central plain.
Press enter three times and you will be facing three doors. Take the first
door on the left and you will be in the Forest Of Cern. Go back through
the door and keep walking until you come to the cave, walk through it and
press enter again three times, then walk left and take the first entrance
(cross pathways) on the left. Now walk left. You will pass one door, but 
don't take this one as it leads to the Plain Of Lies. Keep walking left to 
the second door and go through there. If you have followed the instructions
correctly you should be at the sword. Use it wisely.

 To rid yourself of the Sidhe walk through it and you disappear. Then press
6 and 1 and you're back in the same place with everything you were carrying
on the ground and no Sidhe.
