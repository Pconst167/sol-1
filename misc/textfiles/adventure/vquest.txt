 This is how to solve Viking Quest,
 this is just version one a lot of
 stuff will be longer, incomplete, and
 maybe not right. All will be
 perfect in version 2.

 This will tell you *almost* exactly
 how to solve Viking Quest, if you
 don't want to know, turn off your
 computer now.

 %*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

 [Part one - Fathers Castle]

 [south],[south],[kill stranger],
 [look stranger],(this will give
 you the silver coin),[south],(now
 in the Land of Wotan, I think
 typing [touch spear] does something
 but I'm not sure, try that and then
 wander [west],[east] until Wotan
 comes around!),[west],[talk
 stranger],(trade your whatever
 with the stranger for 100 gps),
 [east],[south],[d] (for down!)

 Now we will leave this place full
 of gods for now and go down into
 a towney place.

 %*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

 [Part two - Towney Place]

 We must get some food or we are
 going to starve our asses off!

 [west],[south],[east],[go building]
 , [buy food] (ahhhh yes we still
 have an ass! and you better hope you
 traded with that guy or you are
 not going to be able to get food!),
 (Now go back to the place you started
 when you came [d] to the town, by
 reversing your directions),(type
 south I think, but be sure you are
 back up in the land of gods!!!)

 Now back to the land of gods!

 %*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

 [Part three - Back to gods' place]

 Now we gotta find Odins ass and
 tell him we are going to kick it
 in unless...

 I think that you go like [east],
 [north],[north],[east], but I'm
 really not sure.... it will say
 you are in the Land of Odin when
 you get there.

 I'm almost posotive though that once
 you get where the strange was killed
 if you just go [north],[east] that
 you will be there??

 Once in Odin's Land, keep going [east]
 until you find him, he was nice and
 said we could use his name once, so
 we won't have to kick his ass!

 Now go [west] and i think you will
 be where you killed the stranger??
 if not get here, go back into
 wotan land, go west, and I think
 you are by the town?? Or else go south
 or soemnthing, but find where it says
 go down for town, and then go [d].

 *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

 [Part 4 - who cares]

 Now go [east],[say odin],(bandits
 are coming up next and he will
 save us so our ass don't get kicked!)
 ,[east],[go castle],[u],[kill
 bandit],[look bandit] (this will
 give you a ring or soemthing, nice
 bandit picture eh?),(now go back
 to the same place where you came
 down from last with I think
 [down],[leave],[south],[west]???
 or something like that!!! Then go
 [west],[west],[west (i think)]
 but find the country side.. from
 the country side go [south],[south],
 [look distance]

 And poofo magico, since we killed
 that bandit it magically teleports
 us to.......> Harbor Place < another
 famous Wyvern place name.

 %*%**%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%

 [part 5 - some harbor place]

 go [south] until you get to the boat
 and then type [look boat],[go boat]
 and this is one part I'm not sure
 about here, you have to sail around
 until you come to the next palce:

 Chasm of Wyvern (named after me!)

 Then onto the next part..

 *%%*%**%*%*%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%**%%**%

 [part 6 - Chasm of Wyvern]

 It's time to say goodbye to para-
 chutes because now you are going
 to jump head first into a pile of
 lava!!!! (???)

 [jump chasm],[turn around],(ahhhh,
 you will go flying down somewhere)
 now you will be in some crappy blue
 picture...move around cuz I don't
 know what to do here either (written
 down I mean) so move around and you
 know you are getting soemwhere when
 you come to the first spot: a dragon!

 This is how i'll show it treks:

 [at dragon]

 attack dragon with sword

 [at balron]

 attack with spear

 (get rid of the dragon on the dragon
 one!)

 [at demon]

 wear amulet

 [at demi-god]

 show runic amulet

Then you come to the beautiful princess
and win the whole damn sun of a you
know....

 look for version two, which will be
 muuuuuch better.

 see ya at a later date, k!
