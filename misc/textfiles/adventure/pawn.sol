    Blue Key can only be used once but has TWO possible uses! Opening the
    door before you, to rescue the Princess and return her to old misery
    guts, OR opening a safe that you have yet to locate. There are no
    points to be gained by rescuing the Princess, but you NEED to open the
    safe and then vote for maximum points, so forget the Princess. If you
    want to go ahead and rescue the old girl, then follow the
    'mini-solution' at the end of the main solution).
