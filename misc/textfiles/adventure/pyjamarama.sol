GENERAL FACTS
There are two different versions of Pyjamarama available.  The
main difference between them is the title music.  The music on
the *first* release is called "Popcorn", and quite commonly
available as a tracker/mod.  AFAIK there's no copyright
restriction on the Popcorn music.  The infinite lives hacks
were different for the different versions, so there must have
been something more than just the title music being changed.
