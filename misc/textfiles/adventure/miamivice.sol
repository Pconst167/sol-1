The Game
--------
Crockett and Tubbs have heard; the word is on the street - a one million
dollar contraband shipment is due in town on Thursday morning, for collection
by Mr. 'J' - an old fashioned gangster with a respectable new image and
some influential friends.
These big deals usually go down under the cover of a waterfront warehouse
and as of Midnight Sunday that's as much as you know.
Just get out there and squeeze the network of dealers; starting with the
real low - life, the $10 wrap men who frequent the local bars. If you
handle them right you just might get to their suppliers, the next link in
the chain and eventually the slick businessmen who operate in the casinos -
they should have lots of information if you don't have to shoot them first!

TO SHOOT OUT OF CAR WINDOW
Press FIRE to enter fire mode - car display will light up. To shoot in
direction shown in car display, press FIRE again (fire mode will then be
exited).
To select a new aiming direction, move joystick...
UP - Shoot ahead
DOWN - Shoot behind
RIGHT - Shoot directly out of the window (right)
N.B. Passangers cannot shoot left!
Once new aim selected, player must fire to exit fire mode.

car cannot turn!!

TO ENTER A NAMED LOCATION
Stop on the road; press FIRE; release, and move joystick left. Car display
will change to:

[See MiamiViceInstructions.jpg]

Press FIRE when arrow pointing to chosen side is lit. To abort entry, press
FIRE when no arrow lit (if either character enters a location, any evidence
or suspects carried in the car will be lost). N.B. Note that turning is
possible whilst reversing.

JOYSTICK CONTROLS WHEN INSIDE A LOCATION
UP - Go through door
DOWN - Exit option mode
LEFT - Walk left
RIGHT - Walk right
FIRE - Shoot in current direction
Evidence (bags of contraband) are collected by walking over them.
Should a crook be encountered, his name will be displayed in the message
window. A crook may be apprehanded by catching, trapping or shooting (if he
survives!) When a crook surrenders, option mode is automatically selected.
Choose options by pressing FIRE when option is highlighted.
Successful interrogation should yield a name of a person or place, a time,
or a dollar value of a deal.
Any crook that is arrested will be carrying all of their deal. Crooks and
evidence should be returned to City Hall to score.

Special Locations
-----------------
Do not have interior screens, but computer beeps when they are visited.
They are:
CITY HALL - Drop off crooks and evidence here (both will be lost if car
crashes with them inside). You will not score for a crook who hasn't talked
(but you will score for his evidence). City Hall will interrogate him and
pass on information on the message window in about 3 hours.
HOSPITAL - May be visited once a day to recover some player strength.

Timing
------
1 game minute = 1 second real time
If you enter a location before the meeting time, the crooks will spot the
car as they arrive, and the meeting will be called off.
If you enter a location when a meeting has been going on less than 4 minutes,
the crooks will have fled, leaving behind evidence.
If you enter a location 4 to 8 minutes after a meeting has started, you may
find a crook carrying evidence.
If you enter a location 8 to 12 minutes after a meeting has started, it
will be deserted - but if you leave quickly you may spot the red getaway car.
If you arrive after 12 minutes you are too late.
If you fall to catch Mr. 'J', the game will restart on midnight of next
Sunday, after you have played to midday on Thursday. All meetings will follow
the previous week's schedule, except for crooks who have been taken to City
Hall, or shot dead.

Scoring
-------
The game ends automatically when you apprehend Mr. 'J', or when either
Crockett or Tubbs is killed.

YOU GAIN POINTS FOR:
(1) Returning evidence to City Hall (all crooks carry evidence which will
be scored when they are returned).
(2) Return crooks to City Hall once they have talked (but not if they lied).
(3) Shoot getaway cars (red ones).

YOU LOSE POINTS FOR:
(1) Crashing your car.
(2) Destroying civilian (non-red) cars.
(3) Each wound on Crockett or Tubbs.
(4) Having a bribe rejected.
(5) Failing to arrest a suspect after threatening to do so.
If you haven't got Mr. 'J' at the end of any weekly cycle (i.e. by midday
Thursday), you lose all your score.

Meetings
--------
Your captain has provided you with sets of probable time schedules for all
the meetings which are expected on Monday.
There are two possible schedules for Monday a.m., and four on Monday p.m.
All meetings within each twelve hour period will follow the same schedule,
although you do not know which ones at the start.
To catch a crook at a meeting, arrive at the meeting between 4 and 8 minutes
after its scheduled start. To disturb a meeting in order to make the crook
flee, leaving his contraband behind, arrive between 0 and 4 minutes from
its start. To encounter a crook's car (the red car), enter and leave the
location of a meeting within 8 and 12 minutes from its start.

Hints And Tips
--------------
1. The timing of the meetings is critical so it is important to refer to
the meeting schedules - Mondays only.
2. In the meeting schedule, once a suspect has been located all subsequent
encounters in the period will follow in the column of times above and below.
