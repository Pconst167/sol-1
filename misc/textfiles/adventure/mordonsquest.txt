SOME BRIEF NOTES:
 Saying Yes to Mordon's request causes the cupboard in the annexe to open up.
 The blowpipe is made up of the bamboo, berries and thorns.
 In the cave beyond the waterfall in the jungle area, the south-west exit
isn't given in the location description. It's still there though.
 Also, in the location where you get the crystal orb, there's a north-west
exit that is not indicated.
 The octopus cannot see you if you turn your lamp off.
 The phone call tells you 'All that glitters is not gold.' a reference to
Fools Gold, or iron pyrites, and from this you deduce that this is what the
jester wants.
 When you spray the paint on the invisible barrier you see the deactivation
code, 8875.
 When the droid repeats the word 'PASS', you are meant to word out that this
is the clue to the password needed for the adamantium barrier. 'P' is the
16th letter of the alphabet, 'A' the first and 'S' the 19th, making 1611919.
 As the program only accepts the first four digits of any inputs, you need
only dial 1611 to learn of 'perseverance', which is certainly something you
need in order to get through this frequently illogical adventure. END
