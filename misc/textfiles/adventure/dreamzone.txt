                           (Baudville Software)

In  two  scenes  (involving  the  'Thief'  and  the  'Deamon),  the  parser
occasionally  won't  recognize a command the first few times. This may have
been  corrected in later versions. Also, in the earlier version, you cannot
kill the Thief the first time so be sure to SAVE YOUR GAME!

The  four lifts go to floors 1 - 4. On each floor are ten rooms, from L - A
and  R  -  A  to  L  -  E  and R - E. Necessary directions are shown in the
solution.

Lift N also has a Basement!
