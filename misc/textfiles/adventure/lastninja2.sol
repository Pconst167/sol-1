Last Ninja 2 --- Complete walkthrough by DINKO BICAKCIC.

Well, I think this is the best game ever made for C-64 so here's how
to play, enjoy and finish it.
 Note: I'm nonnative english speaker, so I'm going to try to give you
the best possible vocabulary while I'm writing this walkthrough.

First thing I would like to suggest to learn the commands with joystick/
keyboard (I personally with my Frodo emulator (the best one for windows) 
use the numeric keypad - PC/Windows. If you're still using C-64 you need
to use joystick port 2. On commodore 64, F1 equals "space bar" on FRODO
PC emulator while F3 is F3.

Pressing F3 will give you a choice of things to use (keys,bottle,etc)
Pressing SPACE BAR will allow you to use weapons (Sword, shurikens,etc)
Note -- shurikens are the best, but limited, other than that sword is the 
most deadly.

I'm going to use, since the game is 3d, terms for movement the following:

N - north 
S - south
W - west
E - east

NE, NW
SE, SW - Hope you'll understand.  Here's the picture:


       8
    7     9
     \ | /
   4 -   - 6
     / | \
    1     3
       2

---- or think of it as joystick. Note: I'm not sure if 7,9,1 and 3 will
work on the keypad. 0 (zero) is used as a fire button on joystick.
With numeric keypad:  8 for example will move you N (a bit to NW)
, while 8+4 will move you straight NW. (It may be difficult but you just
need to play a little bit arround and you'll become a master in minutes).
What's very important is to practice Jumping --- for example
pressing 2 (down) and fire will do the jump but the ninja will not jump 
straight, it will jump a bit to the south direction. Pressing 2+4 (SW) and
fire will do the longer jump to the straight direction. The same applies
to the joystick.  
Also you may configure these movements by pressing "J" button (If you see
that something weird happens don't be affraid, just keep pressing it untill
you come back to desired way of movement. For example pressing "J" once
will result in following: When you move joystick up ninja will move straight
in NW direction, not in N direction as it did before. Pressing "J" two more 
times will put you back to the original way of moving.

When picking up the things you need to use the following: press fire,
then move SW or SE, doesn't matter (for example press 0 on numeric keypad 
(remember to hold it) and press 2+4 (I don't think 1 will work). the same 
applies to the joystick.
When using weapons there's a choice of hits (alwaus hold 0/FIRE) ---
  right - shoot through the oponent (middle efficient)
  left - shoots accross the oponent (most efficient) slowest 
  up - directly hits in to the head of oponent (least efficient) fastest
  down - always a leg kick.

With shurikens use 0 (Fire) and left (W) or right (E).
When you don't have any weapons use a leg kick and hands (fire + left or 
right or up - doesn't matter).
Ok, that's it with the instructions, now with the game:

1. Level one, Central Park.  Go behind the curtanins (You'll se a black spot 
between the red curtains). In the next screen you have to beat the guy, and
simply punch (fire or 0, then hit 4 or W) the yellow switch. Go back, and 
you'll se an open hole.  Simply step on it (go to it) and the ninja will fell
down to the first floor.  In that room once you get out of the square, don't 
go back to it, cause it will put you back to the first screen. Now, near the 
bass drum you'll se a key; simply pick it up and go through the doors, to the 
next screen.  Press F3 and use a key on the steel doors (simply like you're 
going to pick it up).  The door should open but don't go there yet. Beat the 
cop and go SE.  In the next screen beat the cop (again) and near the chairs,
(where the cop was standing) there's a box.  Pick it up (you won't pick up 
the box, you'll pick up the shurikens) again - I'm saying this so you can 
Understand how to handle this game. I think there's a 6 shurikens that don't 
matter where you will use them (I suggest to keep one for the end). 
Ok, when you do that go SW. In the next screen
there's a guy that throws knives at you.  You can't kill him but just go SW,
and jump when he throws a second knife. (Hint, he'll throw it there where the
track (where you walk) bends.  In the next screen you'll se a map (on the 
ground). You can pick it up (just in case), but since now I didn't find any
use of it. Anyways, besides map, you're going to see something again,
like a steel door bu this time use it as a ladder (remember to put all the
weapons away, and simply walk to it) Once you're up go SW to the next screen.
Now you have to do a little jumping to the last wall ("thing") and pick up 
(I think it's called a) a staff (it's brown and very important weapon).
Now go back all the way to the shurikens. Now just remember when going down 
to those steel doors you must turn the ninja facing the wall, not the doors
and simply make him walk backwards (that way he will grab the doors with his
hands), If you have any problems go to the edge of the wall, NE (direction)
and jump to the next screen. Now when you're in the shuriken screen you'll se 
a cop waking up, and coming back to you.  You can bo back to the previous 
screen, and go back again to the shuriken screen to place him (cop) back to 
the guarding position and then you have to quickly go to the SE. In the next
screen kill the cop and go SE. Next screen - kill the guy, and in the right
restroom you'll find a first part of numchukas (a little bit better than 
staff) and go to the previous screen. Now go all the way to N,NW (it's a long
track) and in the next screen you'll have to kill a cop and pick up the 
hamburger (gives you extra life). Go NW and you'll se another restroom.
Do as you did before to complete the numchukas. Now go back to previous screen
(NE) and go SE.  You'll be back to the first steel doors that you opened
with the key. If the cop is awake, do that little trick to put him back
in to the guarding position.  Note: When finding numchukas, you wont' just
find them - You must pick them up.  Ok go through those damn doors to NW,
and in the next screen you have to go SW.  Use the boat (jump on it, and from
it to the track). It's very simple you just need a little practice.
In the next screen you'll see the thing of bees and you must,must
do the following to save the energy. Go all the way to W, to the last first 
level screen. Nothing will happen but now you're ready for a bit harder task.
Go back to the bees screen and go through the small bent track (N) , AND 
ONCE YOU GET TO THE END TO JUMP TO NE (you have to jump from left side of the
track. If you succed you should be on the Island. Now with the space bar (F1)
take out the staff and go to the near the boat as much as you can. Press FIRE
(hold it) and right (keyboard 6) and you should actually push the boat. Now
when the boat is moving you have to jump back to the bees screen and go back
to the last screen of the first level (From Bees screen go W). Use the boat 
as you did before (you'll, i guess have to practice a bit) and go inside the
building. The entire screen should go black and you should load a next level.

Just a little note : Bees can't be killed (well I haven't figured that yet).

Level 2. THE STREETS (I'm going to shorten this a bit).

/////short version//////

On this level you need to find: hamburger, key, sword and a bottle.

>From the main screen I want you first to do this.  Go NW; in the next screen
go NE through the buildings (kill a cop), and the next screen (remember it)
is the last screen of this level.  Now, go back to the first screen and go SE
>From that screen go SW (careful with the stop light, and also let's
call this screen an intersection 1) and go NW. In that screen
kill the guy, and you should have seen the door flashes. Punch the door with
the leg and go through it. Inside the building there's a sort of like a 
health club and there should be a ninja (he's not that dangerous).
Simply kill him and pick up the sword located on the wall (you should see it
flashes when you enter the hall). Go back to the intersection 1, and go all
the way SE (through 5 screens I believe). As I remember you should be in the
screen where you will see a theater (It has DRUGS written on it) and there's
a drunk guy on the floor. If I'm incorrect try to find this screen yourself.
In front of him (the drunk guy) pick up the bottle and go SW through
the street (Stop light again). Kill the guy and go NW. In the next screen
you'll se a restroom, and a guy in front of it. Kill the guy and in the 
restroom you'll find a key. When you pick it up go all the way back to the
last screen in this level, and apply the key to the sewer cover (it's a 
round object in the middle of the screen). Once you open it go to it, and 
you're ready for the next level. (You'll se a ninja sort of like drown slowly)

Update: The word that I should have written is man-hole cover
 (in the last screen of this level) 

LEVEL 3 - THE SEWER

This level is probably the easiest one of all.

>From the first screen go NE, kill the guy and go NW. Kill the guy and before
you jump over on the other side of sewer go through the doors NE. Kill the 
guy (he's hidden) and pick up the key located all the way to the right.
Now go back and jump over to the other side and go NW. Do a bit jumping
again and watch for the spiders. Just stop when you see them comming and 
go behind them to the next screen (SW). Apply (Use) the key on the cover of
the lower level of the sewer, and go down. Now kill the guy and go NE.
Now all you have to do is just follow the track (screens) and when you get 
to the screens with the choice of doors do the following, first choose a 
middle door, than last door, and then left doors (upper). Assuming you have
found your way all the way to the end you should see a screen with the
doors (located NE) and no oponents, but with the hungry crocodile (door
keeper). Don't try to go arround him, you won't make it. Go back to the 
previous screen and apply the bootle to the torch. You should see a piece
of paper on the bottle changes collor to red. Now go back to the crocodile
screen, and simply throw the bottle as you would shurikens. It may not work
at first, but don't worry just keep shooting. Once he goes up in flames, just
go trough the doors.

LEVEL 4 - the basement

Probably the hardest.

Again, I'm going to shorten this, assuming you got a hold of a game and 
movements, and so on.  From the first screen go NE, (you have to go arround
the boxes, near the wall).  In the next screen go up the ladder on the
upper level of the basement.  Then go SW in the first screen of this
level and pick up the green object (it's a some sort of pass-card).
Now go all the way to the other end of this upper level (there's about 
  5 screens) and go through the doors. In that door pick up the plate near the 
table (right side)
On the right side of the screen under "using" the drumstick (chicken leg)
should appear. Now, go all the way back to the ladder, and lower yourself
down.  Next what you have to do go all the way through about 10 screens 
forward until you reach the lab (in many screens there should be a opponents
but just take care of them). Now before I go on I should mention that 
3 screens may give you a bit of trouble.  the first one should be the one
with the railroad tracks and some things (I don't know the word) going
fast on them (one after another). Simply jump.  there's also one more with
the railroad tracks, and again jump (they are loaded with deadly electric
current). The last one's probably the hardest one in the game. There's no
opponents, but the track by which you going is cut off and there are 4 
pillars. You have to use all of them (jump on them) in order to go on.
It's actually simple but it may seem hard at the moment. Now I'm assuming
that you have reached the lab go SW, and then SE. In that screen apply that
drumstick (chicken meat) to the big white canister (tub) and you should see
the peace of meat go green. Now go back to the entrance in the lab and go
SE. In the next screen you have to go SE, but there's a panther on that edge.
Simply go close to the animal (panther, and not that close!) and give him
(like pick up) that meat. You should see it jump and simply fell asleep.
Go arround the panther to the next screen and apply the green card on the 
box near the entrance to the elevator (more precisely on the right side of
the elevator).
And you are ready for next level.

Level 5 - the office

On this level, go SE, and go through the doors. On the first computer, which
is located on the right pick up a four digit number (it's different in every
game and you need to remember it).  Go back to the previous screen and
go NW. Then go NW through the doors. I don't know what is in the other room
but if you want to take a look just go ahead. Now once you have passed through
those NW doors in this room on the right table there's an ashtray. Simply 
pick it up and you'll see a secret doors open. Go trough them and go up the
ladder. Go NE trough the doors and then go NW. Ok, now it's going to be tough
to explain how to avoid the big fan.  Now i think that there's a way to disable
it but i never did it. Do the following. Point the ninja in that direction,and
go, but you HAVE TO GO NW a bit to the N direction so it looks like ninja
is moving slow (because of the wall). Simply proceed moving like that.
The fan will blow you but not enough to throw you off the track. 
If you're moving in any other way it will blow you off the track. Simply once
you pass it, open the doors (no key needed) and go outside. Go SW, and kill the
guy and Go NW. Go up the ladder, kill the guy. and go NE (once you reach the
roof).  Now, there's a helicopter waiting for you to jump, but you'll never
cach it. (It may be possible but you're gonna waste a lot of time). Simply
jump NE (to the right screen) and you're on your way to the next level.

Level 6 the mansion

Lower yourself by pressing down (or pulling joystick down) on one of the
pillars. Do a bit of jumping until you reach the one on the roof. move a
bit NW, and once you're on the roof go STRAIGHT NE (you have to be very
precise). Now in the next screen move close to the window so that ninja
is about at 100 degree angle of the window at right side of the roof.
Simply move SE and ninja should go down through the window (do not jump)
Once you're down go SW and then trough the doors. Pick up the rope (near
the bed) and go back two screens. Go through the doors and in that room
set up rope (well actually just press F3 to see the rope under "using"
bar). Go to a gray spot that looks like the doors and lower yourself 
down to the kitchen. From kitchen go SW and go in to the other room. 
In the other rooms you'll see something that looks like a radio. Apply a 
pick up again and that should disable the alarm. Go back to the previous 
screen and go through the secreet doors to the basement (The secreet door
is located on the right of the stairs near the green plant (well what other
color plants are usually).  Go down the stairs and move the light switch 
so you can see the light in the other room turns up. (the light switch looks
like a box on the wall). You don't have to do this but the next room is
labyrinth shape and I would advise to do this for first time.
After the labyrinth room there's another screen with a big machine in it.
Again I have the word problem (machine). Go near the chair and turn NW
Apply the pick up move on the little gray board with the white switch on it,
and you should see a steam move up. Go through the doors to the last level.

Level 7 - THE FINAL BATTLE

Go through the doors,when you kill the guy,and in the next screen lift up
(pick up) the red (I don't know how to say it) "thing (it looks like a carpet,
with some chinese writing on it). I don't think that should be complicated.
Once it's up you should see a safe. Apply (pick up) the password that you 
picked up on the 5th level, and when the safe opens pick up the bomb.

NOTE - When you see the numbers I think that direction (on joystick) changes
the number while /FIRE/ moves you to the next number, and than you have to 
change the number according to the number you've got on the 5th level.

WHEN you pick up the bomb, Kunitoki will appear, but I would advise you to
get out of that room, and come back to it. Now, this is probably the easiest
to do. Well in that room as you have probably seen there's a star with 5
candles at each corner. I would turn on (pick up) at least two, (you can
try more, but never all of them) and when you're done with that kill the 
Kunitoki in the middle of the star. Once he's done quckly turn on the other
candles. If the star is not flashing, and you don't see Kunitoki's body
flying in three parts (up and down to his body) 
you haven't kill the Kunitoki in the center of the star. When he wakes up do
this again. With assumption that you got that done all you have to do is 
put the bomb back in to the safe.

And you're done.

Couple of last words : If you would like more info contact me at
dinkouser@aol.com.
Most of the oponents in the game can be avoided without killing (it does take
a bit of practice to go arround them)
Also some of the weapons are not needed (numchukas, or sword).
Also you don't have to pick up the rope nor deactivate alarm on the 6th
level. Simply go down the stairs (although alarm will activate). The actual
result of the alarm is that your oponents will run faster. (I don't know if
it's same with all versions).
