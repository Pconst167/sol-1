Problem:
Where do I go on Day One?

Hint:
When you awake in your cave, get your money and your horn.  Go outside and speak 
to the men in your campsite. Then go to the Watling Overlook (walk left 4 screens) 
and observe the peasant on Watling Street, speak to Will Scarlet and young Simon 
in the Shooting Glade (from the campsite screen go right and then up 1 screen),
and visit the widow and her three sons at her cottage. Now select the map from
the Icon Bar and this will end Day One.


Problem:
I see a peasant from Watling Overlook! What do I do?

Hint:
Click the hand or walk cursor on the peasant to meet her on the trail. To save
her, shoot the sheriff's officer with your bow and arrow.


Problem:
What should I do at the shooting glade?

Hint:
Be sure to  talk to Will and young  Simon. If you like, you  can also show them
your excellent marksmanship  by shooting the targets on  the trees. However, if
you'd  like to  skip your  marksmanship practice,  set the  Arcade level to the
easiest setting.


Problem:
What should I do at the Widow's Cottage?

Hint:
Talk to the Widow and her three sons. This is all you need to do on Day One, so
select the map from the icon bar. This will end Day One. By the way, be sure to
visit her on other days.

Problem:
What do I do on Day 2?

Hint:
You need to explore the forest. Eventually you'll find Marian being attacked by
a Fens Monk. Rescue her by shooting the Fens Monk with your bow and arrow. Be
sure to pick up her slipper to give to Lobb on another day. Blow your horn to
call your men. Finally, select the map from the icon bar and this will end Day
Two (notice that the overlook is now displayed on the map).

Problem:
Where can I obtain a disguise to enter Nottingham?

Hint:
Go to the Watling Street Overlook and observe the beggar on the trail. Click
the hand or walk cursor on him to encounter him on the trail.  To get his
clothes for a disguise, offer him money--a half penny will do.


Problem:
Lobb won't speak openly to me!

Hint:
Find Lobb in the Cobbler's Street in Nottingham. Give him Marian's slipper,
which you picked up from the forest floor after rescuing her from the Fens Monk
on Day Two.  He'll give you a silver comb. You'll be able to  give this silver
comb to Marian on another day.

Problem:
What must I do on Day Four?

Hint:
Two events must occur before the day ends. Go to the Watling Street Overlook
and observe the peasant in custody on the street. Click the hand or walk cursor
on him to encounter them on the trail. Shoot the sheriff's man with your bow
and arrow. You also need to visit Marian in the Willow grove. Give her the
silver comb Lobb gave you and the heart-shaped half emerald.


Problem:
Marian doesn't trust me!

Hint:
Remember the silver comb you got from Lobb on Day Three? Give Marian the silver
comb you got from Lobb. Now she'll trust you. You can also give her the half
emerald shaped like a heart.

(NOTE:  On Day 5 you will encounter either a Fens Monk or a Abbey Monk
on Watling Street (you will see both from the overlook).  It doesn't
matter which one you encounter first.  So, if you encounter the Fens
Monk (robed in black) first, you will encounter the Abbey monk on
Day 6).


Day 5 and 6, Fens Monk

Problem:
No one is on Watling Street. How do I proceed?

Hint:
Before you go to Watling Street, you need to visit the widow's cottage to find
out the news about her sons. Then go to the Watling Street Overlook and watch
for a Fens Monk to come down the street. He'll be wearing black. Click the hand
cursor on him to encounter him on Watling Street.


Problem:
What should I do when I encounter the Fens Monk?

Hint:
Click the hand  cursor on him. To get  the Fens Monk's robe, click  the bow and
arrow cursor  on him, accept his  challenge, and defeat him  with Little John's
staff. Use this Monk's robe as a disguise for the day's events.


Problem:
How do I cross the Fens?

Hint:
When  you defeated  the Fens  Monk on  Watling Street  and took  his robe for a
disguise, you'll notice he was carrying a reed instrument. Blow this whistle at
the edge of the  Fens and another Fens Monk will pick you  up in a boat to take
you to the Monastery.


Problem:
How do I get past the guard of the Fens Monk Monastery?

Hint:
You need to give  the guard two items. First, give him  the whistle made from a
marsh  reed.  Then  give  him  the  bag  of  gemstones.  You'll  need your game
documentation to correctly identify the gemstones.


Problem:
What do I do inside the Fens Monk Monastery?

Hint:
You need  to do three  things. First,  visit  the Prior in  the Refectory. Then
visit Fulk and release  him from the Torture Room. Find the  Prior again in the
Scroll Room, spill wine on him and  take Fulk's scroll. Also while you're still
in the Scroll Room, find and take Marian's scroll.


Problem:
How can I obtain Marian's scroll?

Hint:
When you enter the  Scroll Room, click the eye cursor on  the scroll rack. This
will bring up a close-up view of the  scroll rack. Now click the hand cursor on
each of the scrolls  until you find Marian's. You might also  wish to read each
of these scrolls carefully. One of them contains a clue for another part of the
game.


Problem:
I'm having trouble getting Fulk's scroll!

Hint:
After you've released  Fulk from the chains in the  torture room, return to the
Scroll  Room. Here  you'll see  the Prior  reading Fulk's  scroll at  his desk.
You'll notice the Prior's  goblet of wine on the desk. Walk  up behind his wine
goblet and click the hand cursor on  it. Of course, wine will spill everywhere.
When the Prior leaves the room in disgust, take the scroll from the desk.


Problem:
How do I get past the iron grate?

Hint:
Did you  examine the other  scrolls in  the  scroll room? One  scroll "seems to
speak  of  the  history  of  this  very  fortress"  and  gives a hint about the
gargoyles surrounding the iron grate. First,  you need to click the hand cursor
on "the Gargoyle  with the thoughtful face," then on  "the Gargoyle with a lean
and hungry look," then finally on  "the foolish looking Gargoyle." Now the iron
grate will open up and you and Fulk can escape.

Days 5 and 6, Abbey Monk


Problem:
No one is on Watling Street. How do I proceed?

Hint:
Before you go to Watling Street, you  need to visit the widow's cottage to find
out the news about  her sons. Then go to the Watling  Street Overlook and watch
for an  Abbey Monk to come  down Watling Street. He'll  be wearing brown. Click
the hand cursor on him to encounter him on Watling Street.


Problem:
What should I do when I encounter the Abbey Monk?

Hint:
Use this Monk's  robe as a disguise for  the day's events. Just click  the hand
cursor on him. He'll  be so afraid of you that he'll  give up his clothes. Also
be sure to visit the widow today.


Problem:
What should I do in the Abbey?

Hint:
You need to do four things. First, go  to the laundry room and get three robes.
Second, explore the  hedge maze behind the Abbey and  note the quickest path to
the secret door. Next, meet the Abbot in the refectory and take his ale cask to
the pub for a refill. Get the Abbot drunk and then take the puzzle box from his
bedroom. You will have to wait for a safer place to open the puzzle box.


Problem:
What must I do at the pub?

Hint:
There are  two things to  do in the  pub today. First,  refill the Abbot's  ale
cask.  To  do  this,  you  need  to  get  the  empty  ale cask from the Abbot's
refectory. Go back to the Abbey and  return with the empty cask. Give the empty
cask to the Innkeeper, and he'll be much more cooperative. Be sure to play Nine
Men's Morris and win the amethyst (see "NINE MORRIS" for instructions on how to
play the game).


Problem:
I keep getting thrown out of the Abbey, or end up drunk!

Hint:
Accept the Abbot's challenge and drink with him. But first, you need to win the
amethyst by  playing Nine Men's  Morris in the  pub. You can  slip the amethyst
into your mug after the first glass of ale has been poured.


Problem:
The Abbot's room is locked! How can I enter?

Hint:
Get the Abbot drunk!  This means you'll need to go to  the Refectory and accept
his challenge to  drink. He will instruct one  of the other monks to  leave his
door unlocked. If you use the amethyst wisely, you'll drink him under the table
and be able to walk right into his room yourself.


Problem:
Ok.. the Abbot is drunk, what do I do next?

Hint:
Search the Abbot and lift his purse. Grab the empty ale cask from the table. Go
search the Abbot's room for the puzzle  box he was playing with earlier. You'll
find it under the third pillow on his bed.


Problem:
How do I open the puzzle box?

Hint:
You might wait until another day to  open this puzzle. You won't be needing the
contents until  Day Ten. The  key to  opening  it is in  reading Fulk's scroll.
Looking at the scroll, write down the first letter of each name of a Druid tree
listed there. These first letters will give you the Latin word you need to open
the puzzle box.  Select the puzzle box from inventory  with the hand cursor and
punch in these letters.


Problem:
How do I help the widow's boys escape?

Hint:
Go to the pub and pay the Abbot's bill of twelve pennies. Give the pub keep the
empty ale cask.  Exit the pub through the  secret cave in the back  by clicking
the hand  cursor on the  iron door to   the back room  of the pub,  then on the
spigot  of the  second cask  in the  back room.  Find the  secret door into the
guard's room and click the eye cursor  on the hole in the door. Eventually, the
guards will  slip out of the  room to get some  money for ale. Enter  the room,
place four pennies on the table and  exit back into the tunnel. When the guards
leave, enter  the room and  click the hand  cursor on the  trapdoor. Select the
robes from  inventory and click them  on the opening of  the trapdoor. When the
four of you are back in the tunnel, exit through the pub. When Robin is stopped
and asked to bless the kneeling, drunken  Sheriff, click the talk cursor on the
Sheriff.

Problem:
How should I get started on Day Seven?

Hint:
Visit Marian in the Willow Grove and give her the hand scroll from the Fens
Monk Monastery. Visit the Green Man of the ancient oak and solve his riddles.


Problem:
What should I do when I encounter Marian?

Hint:
You need to give her the hand scroll you got from the Fens Monk Monastery.
Also, give her the heart-shaped half emerald.  NOTE: Make sure you copy
the hand (with the letters on it) down. You will need this hand code later 
in the game. So be sure you SAVE the game before you meet her in the grove.


Problem:
How do I summon the Green Man?

Hint:
Remember the golden net the widow gave you?  If she hasn't given it  to you by
Day Seven, go visit her. You can use this net to capture a Pixie, one of the
wood sprites. You will find the Pixie in an open field (just go to an open area
and wait for the Pixie to appear). The Pixie will introduce you  to the Green 
Man. Talk to the Green Man and he'll challenge you with three riddles.


Problem:
What should I do with the Golden Net?

Hint:
You can use this net to capture a Pixie, one  of the wood sprites.  The Pixie
will introduce you to the Green Man.


Problem:
What are the answers to the Green Man's riddles?

Hint:
Refer to your hand code diagram (did you remember to write it down?) for the
the letters to spell out the answers. The answer to the riddle that begins 
"I am the heart.." is wood. The answer to the riddle that  begins "High born, 
my touch.." is snow. The answer to the riddle that begins "I am the outstretched
fingers.." is  feather. The answer to the riddle that begins "Golden treasure 
I contain.." is beehive. The answer to the riddle that begins "My first master 
has four legs.." is fur. The answer to the riddle that begins "Metal or bone 
I may be.." is comb. The answer to the riddle that begins "Not born but from 
a mother's body drawn.." is cheese. The answer to the  riddle that begins "I 
am two-faced but bear only one.." is coin. The answer to the riddle that begins 
"I am a window.." is eye.

Problem:
What should I do on Day Eight?

Hint:
There  are three  things you  need to   do on  Day Eight.  First go  to Watling
Overlook and observe the Yeoman on  Watling street. Confront the Yeoman and pay
him for his  clothes. Second, attend the fair  and give the hand scroll  to the
scholar  who shows  you the  correct coat  of arms.  Finally, enter the archery
tournament and win the golden arrow.


Problem:
What should I do when I encounter the Yeoman on Watling Street?

Hint:
Offer him some money. He'll give you his clothes for a disguise.


Problem:
What should I do at the Fair?

Hint:
You need to do two things at the fair. First, locate a scholar who can show you
the  correct  coat-of-arms you're asking to see.  Refer to the "COATS ARM"
for a description of the different coat-of-arms. When the scholar shows you the  
correct coat-of-arms, give  him the hand  scroll from Marian.  Second,
enter the archery tournament and win the golden arrow.

Problem:
What must I do on Day Nine?

Hint:
You must do three things. You must escape the sheriff's men when they sweep the
forest.  You must  encounter the  jeweler on  Watling Street. Finally, disguise
yourself as  either Puck, using his  Yeoman's clothes, or as  the Jeweler, then
visit the Sheriff of Nottingham.


Problem:
How can I evade the sheriff's men?

Hint:
When the sheriff's men are chasing you,  run to the ancient Oak. You'll need to
call upon the  Green Man's protection. To gain the  Green Man's protection, you
must  have  answered   his  three  riddles  on  Day   Eight.  Using  your  game
documentation find the  Druid name for the oak. Click the hand cursor on Robin
and enter this Druid name using the hand code (refer to the DRUID NAMES area for
a complete list of Druid names). Robin will transform into a tree and the sheriff's 
men will walk right by him.
    Another way to evade the sheriff's men is when you hear the sheriff's men in
the forest, go to the map and go to the willow grove. Go down one screen from the 
grove and then walk left until the computer automatically takes you to the map
view.  
    Whichever way you choose to evade the sheriff's men, go to the overlook 
afterwards.


Problem:
What should I do when I encounter the jeweler?

Hint:
There  are three  possible ways  to complete  this encounter.  You can  let the
jeweler go on his way, in which case you'll use your Yeoman's disguise to visit
the  Sheriff. You  could give  the jeweler  the heart-shaped  half emerald, and
he'll  gladly trade  you his  clothes. If  you give  him the  emerald, you  can
complete the  game, but Marian  will die on  another day. A  third option is to
simply click  the hand cursor  on him twice.  This is the  best option to take,
because  you'll get  his clothes  for  a  disguise and  he'll still  be happily
rewarded.


Problem:
How can I get in to see the Sheriff?

Hint:
If you fail to get the Jeweler's disguise,  put on the Yeoman disguise.  Go to
Nottingham Castle  and bribe the  guard--a penny will do. Keep talking  to the
Sheriff and you'll convince him to come with you,or make a wager by giving him
three pennies. This will end Day Nine.

Problem:
What should I do on Day Ten?

Hint:
You need to rescue Marian, and either heal her in the Willow Grove or let her
die.


Problem:
How do I rescue Marian?

Hint:
While in your camp, blow your horn to assemble the men.  When you're given the
choice, follow John's subterfuge plan. Go to the Pub and talk to the Innkeeper
several times. He'll let you use the back way into the Abbey Monk Monastery. At
the Monastery,  travel through the hedge  maze to find the  witch's court. When
you get  to the entrance  of the Witch's  Court, select the  ring that commands
fire from  inventory and click  it on Robin.  Now click the  hand cursor on the
door.


Problem:
I keep getting burned up trying to rescue Marian!

Hint:
Put on the ring that commands  fire from your inventory before rescuing Marian.
You found  this ring by  opening the puzzle  box from the  Abbot's room in  the
Abbey Monk Monastery.


Problem:
I've rescued Marian, but now she's dying!

Select the half emerald from inventory and click it on Marian  to heal her. If
you don't have the half emerald, she will die. However, you can still complete
the game without her.


Problem:
How do I ambush the treasure train?

Hint:
Blow your horn to call your men together. Choose Tuck's plan -- Ambush with 
an element of surprise.

Problem:
What should I do on Day Twelve?

Hint:
You need to avoid the sheriff's men in the forest and then encounter a knight
on Watling Street.


Problem:
How do I avoid the sheriff's men in the forest?

Hint:
The same way you avoided them the first time they swept the forest!


Problem:
What should I do when I encounter a knight on Watling Street?

Hint:
This is a false knight! Talk to him  and then try to give him the password from
Marian using the hand code. When you  do this a second time, Robin will realize
he's a false  knight. Immediately select your bow and  arrow from inventory and
shoot him. When he is on the  ground, search him. Now you'll have evidence that
he was plotting against the King. Blow your horn to call Little John.

Problem:
What should I do on Day Thirteen?

Hint:
Day Thirteen is the  final day of the game. If Marian  has died, you'll need to
visit her spirit in the Willow Grove.  If you know the password, you can rescue
the Queen's Knight from the Fens  Monk Monastery, then stand trial to determine
your fate.


Problem:
How do I cross the Fens Marsh?

Hint:
Select  the ring  that commands  water from  inventory and  wear it. You'll see
Will-O'-the-Wisps floating over the Fens Marsh. Click the talk cursor on one of
the Wisps.  They'll let you  cross if  you've  visited or healed  Marian in the
willow grove and received a password.


Problem:
I can't locate Marian's spirit in the Willow Grove!

Hint:
If Marian has died you need to use  the hand code to call up her spirit. You'll
need your  game documentation for this  one. Look up the  Druid name for Willow
and enter  it using the  hand code. You'll  receive a password  to give to  the
knight.


Problem:
How do I enter the Fens Monastery?

Hint:
You'll need  your game documentation for  this one. Look up  the Druid name for
ivy and enter it  using the hand code. The ivy on the  wall will grow and grow.
You'll be able to climb the wall using the ivy.


Problem:
The Queen's Knight won't go with me!

Hint:
Remember the  password Marian gave  you in the  Willow Grove? Well,  enter this
password using the  hand code. The knight will go  with you. After crossing the
Fens, and  the knight is  safe, you'll stand  trial and your  fate as an outlaw
will be determined. You have completed the game.

Nine Men's Morris Game

Instructions to play the game:
    
    This is a two-player game. Each player has 9 pieces.  There are
24 "points" on the board where a piece may be placed.  These are the
corners of the squares and the places where the connecting lines
intersect.
    The object of the game is to create "mills" and remove your 
opponent's pieces from the board until he only has 2 pieces left or
is unable to make any moves.  A "mill" is 3 of the same player's 
pieces laid in a row with no vacant points between them (see below).
    Each time a player moves one of his pieces so that he creates a 
new mill, he can remove one of his opponent's pieces. Pieces that line
up diagonally or without being connected by a line do not count (see
below for an example).

    How to begin: determine, however you like, which player gets the
first move. That player may place 1 of his pieces on any vacant point
(remember there are 24 points). Then the other player places 1 piece.
They take turns placing pieces until all 9 pieces have been placed on the
board.
    While the players put down the 9 pieces, each one should be trying to
do 2 things: create a mill; or prevent the other player from creating a
mill.
    Once all remaining pieces (not counting any lost because the opponent
created a mill) have been placed on the board, the second part of the game
is for the players to continue taking turns moving 1 of their pieces to an
adjacent vacant point on the board. A player may not jump over his own or
another player's piece and moves must be made along the lines only. A piece
cannot jump across spaces.
    A player who has made a mill may not take a piece from one of his
opponent's mill unless there are no other pieces to take.
    A new mill may be formed by a player moving one of his pieces from an
existing mill (so it's no longer a mill) in one turn and moving it back into
the same place to recreate the mill on his next turn (provided the other 
player doesn't block the space in the meantime).

The Riddles of the Green Man in the Oak Tree

I am the heart that does not beat; if cut, I bleed without 
blood,I can fly, but have no wings, I can float, but have 
no fins,I can sing, but have no mouth.
WOOD

High born, my touch is gentle, purest white is my lace,
silent, silent is my kingdom, green is the colour of my 
death.
SNOW

I am the outstretched fingers that seize and hold the 
wind,wisdom flows from me in other hands,upon me are 
sweet dreams dreamt,my merest touch brings laughter.
FEATHER

Golden treasures I contain, guarded by hundreds and 
thousands, stored in a labyrinth where no man walks, yet 
men come often to seize my gold, by smoke I am overcome and 
robbed, then left to build my treasure anew.
HIVE

My first master has four legs, my second master has two 
legs, my first I serve in life, my second I serve in 
death,Cure me and I live beyond my death. Tough I am, yet 
soft beside, 'gainst ladies' cheeks I oft reside.
FUR (or SKIN)

Metal or bone I may be, many teeth I have and always bared, 
yet my bite harms no one, and ladies delight in my touch.
COMB

Not born but from a mother's body drawn, I hang until half 
of me is gone, I sleep in a cave until I grow old, then 
valued for my hardened gold.
CHEESE

I am two-faced but bear only one face, I have no legs but 
travelwidely, men spill much blood over me, kings leave 
their imprintupon me, I have greatest power when given 
away,yet lust for me keep s me locked away.
COIN

I am a window, I am a lamp, I am clouded, I am shining,I 
am coloured, set in white, I fill with water and 
overflow, I say much, but have no words.
EYE
