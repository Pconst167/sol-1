HERE'S HOW TO MAKE A SUPER ROMSWITCH!
 
OBTAIN AN OLD MONITOR ROM AND MAKE
SURE YOU HAVE AN APPLE LANGUAGE CARD.
 
REMOVE THE LANGUAGE CARD AND LOCATE
CHIP#5, TTL 74LS20. LOCATED AT THE
TOP OF THE FIRST ROW NEXT TO THE ROM.
 
BEND OUT PIN SIX (DON'T BREAK IT OFF!)
 
OBTAIN AN SPST SWITCH. SOLDER ONE LEAD
FROM A POLE TO THE PIN BENT OUT. SOLDER
THE OTHER TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CARD 
WHERE THE HOLE 6 IS. NOW REMOVE THE
AUTOSTART ROM FROM THE LANGUAGE CARD
AND REPLACE IT WITH THE MONITOR ROM.
 
NOW YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN THE AUTO-
START ROM ON THE MOTHERBOARD AND THE
MONITOR ROM ON THE CARD BY FLIPPING
A SWITCH! OR BURN YOUR OWN 2716, MAKE
A JUMPER SOCKET, AND PUT IT ON THE
LC FOR A SUPER CRACKING ROM!
