

STARCROSS  IS  A RELATIVELY SIMPLE ADVENTURE-- IT'S ALL SIMPLY A MATTER OF
SHOVING  COLOR  CODED  RODS  INTO   THE APPROPRIATELY  COLORED  SLOTS. (FREUD
WOULD  HAVE  BEEN  PROUD).  THE  ONLY PROBLEM  IS  IN  FINDING  THE  RODS AND
SLOTS.   THIS  COLUMN  WILL  TELL  YOU EVERYTHING YOU  NEED  TO  KNOW...  (IN
CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!) SO BE  SURE AND HIT THE SPACEBAR IF I START TO TELL YOU
ANYTHING YOU  *=>  DON'T WANT TO KNOW YET! <=* A WORD TO THE WISE: IF YOU PUT
A ROD INTO A SLOT OF A DIFFERENT COLOR. IT WILL DISAPPEAR FOREVER.

THE LANDING
-----------
GET UP. GET LIBRARY. E. PUSH  RED BUTTON. READ  SCREEN. GET THE COORDINATES
FOR WHICHEVER  UNIDENTIFIED MASS  (UM-??) HAS BEEN CHOSEN AT RANDOM FROM THE
CHART BELOW:

COORDINATES FOR MASS OBJECTS

ENTER COUCH. SAY TO COMPUTER "R IS (R). PHI IS (PHI). THETA IS (THETA)". WAIT
FOR COMPUTER TO REPLYY  THAT THERE IS INDEED A MASS THERE. IF IT DOESN'T THEN
YOU  GOT  THE  COORDINATES  WRONG!  TRY AGAIN.  THEN  TYPE:  SAY  TO COMPUTER
"CONFIRMED." FASTEN BELT.  WAIT. (THE ROCKETS  WILL FIRE.) UNFASTEN BELT. GET
UP. EAST. DON SUIT. GET LINE. W. SIT. FASTEN BELT.  WAIT. WAIT OR  LOOK UNTIL
THE TENTACLES GRAB YOU AND YOU  ARE  SAFELY DOCKED. (A TOTAL OF 7 WAITS).

GETTING IN
----------
UNFASTEN BELT. GET UP. OPEN INNER. OUT. CLOSE  INNER.  OPEN  OUTER.  OUT. PRESS
FOURTH BUMP. (THE SCULPTURE IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SOLAR SYSTEM.  YOU PRESS  THE
FOURTH  BUMP  BECAUSE IT CORRESPONDS TO YOUR HOME PLANET (EARTH).  WHY IS EARTH
THE FOURTH BUMP AND  NOT  THE  THIRD  ? BECAUSE  THE  SUN  COUNTS  AS THE FIRST
BUMP!).  AT THIS POINT YOU SHOULD SEE A 'TINY BUUMP').   PRESS  TINY.   NOW  YOU
WILL SEE A BLACK ROD RISE UP.  THIS ROD IS  A  'SELF-DESTRUCT'  DEVICE!  DO NOT
PUT IT IN ANY BLACK SLOT. EVER!. TAKE BLACK  ROD.  THE AIRLOCK DOOR WILL OPEN
WHEN  YOU  TAKE  THE  ROD. IN.  CLOSE OUTER. OPEN INNER. IN. TA-DA! YOU ARE
NOW IN THE 'ARTIFACT'!!!!


THE ARTIFACT
------------
THINK  OF  IT   AS   AN   INTERGALACTIC INTELLIGENCE   TEST.    PUT  THE  RIGHT
BLOCKS IN THE RIGHT HOLES AND  WIN  THE PRIZE.   THE ARTIFACT IS CYLINDRICAL IN
SHAPE. AND DIVIDED (LIKE  A  PIE)  INTO FOUR WEDGES. WHICH (LIKE THE SLOTS) ARE
COLOR  CODED.   THESE  COLORS ARE: RED. BLUE. GREEN. YELLOW.  THESE WEDGES  ARE
TRANSECTED  BY  5  CONCENTRIC RINGS: IN SHORT. TTHE CYLINDER IS DIVIDED INTO  A
SORT  OF  CIRCULAR GRID SYSTEM OF RINGS AND COLORS. (THIS WILL BE MORE  OBVIOUS

TO YOU  AS  YOU  MOOVE  ABOUT  IN  THE ARTIFACT.) DIRECTIONS  ARE:  N.S.E.W.U.
AND  D.  UP  AND DOWN CORRESPPOND TO IN AND OUT.  EAST AND WEST CORRESPONDD TO
LEFT  AND  RIGHT.  AND ALSO TO PORT AND STARBOOARD.  WHEN   YOU   ENTER    THE
ARTIFACT.  YOU  WILL BE UNABLE TO ENTER THE YELLOW SECTION WITHOUT BEING  EATEN
BY  THE  GRUES  (WHICH  WERE APPARENTLY CAPTURED ON THE PLANET  ZORK.  BUT  WHO
ESCAPED  FROM  THE  ALIEN  ZOO  FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF MENACING ADVENTURERS
FOOLHARDY  ENOUGH  TO  TRAVEL   WITHOUT LIGHT. )


COLLECT THOSE RODS!
-------------------

YOU  CAN GET THESE IN DIFFERENT ORDERS. BUT THE FOLLOWING ONE  WILL  DEFINITELY
WORK:    BLACK.  RED.  SILVER.  YELLOW. PINK. BLUE. GOLD. BROWN. VIOLET. GREEN.
CLEAR (CRYSTAL). WHITE.



GETTING THE RED ROD:  IT'S  BEING  HELD CAPTIVE  BY  'ANT-MEN'!   TO GET THERE:
N. W. FORWARD.  E.   NOW.  THE  ANT-MEN WILL  BE  VERY NASTY IF YOU TRY TO TAKE
THEIR ROD AWAY.   SO  LET'S  KEEP  THEM BUSY    DOING    SOMETHING   ELSE--LIKE
REBUILDING   THEIR   NEST....     THROW SOMETHHING  AT THE NEST--THE TAPE PLAYER
WILL DO NICELY.  AND  YOUR  SPACE  SUIT WILL  ALSO  WORK  IF YOU WANT TO BOTHER
TAKING  IT  OFF.   THEN  GET  RED  ROD. DON'T  FORGET TO RECLAIM WHATEVER IT WAS
YOU THREW!! (GET LIBRARY)


GETTING  THE  SILVER  ROD: (IT'S ON THE WAY TO THE YELLOW ONE. WHICH WE  REALLY
>NEED<!)  FROM  THE NEST: W. AFT. W. S. S. PORT. GET GUN. LOOK  INTO  GUN.  GET
SILVER ROD. (TOO EASY. NO?)


GETTING  THE  YELLOW  ROD:  ITT'S IN THE SPACESHIP  DOCKED  OUTSIDE  THE BLUE
AIRLOCK.    FROM THE WEAPONS DECK: E. N. OPEN INNER. OUT.  CLOSE  INNER.  OPEN
OUTER. OUT. S. S. GIVE THE TAPE LIBRARY TO THE  SPIDER (THE CLUE HERE WAS THAT
HE IS INTENSELY  INTERESTED  IN  NEWS). HE'LL  GIVE  YOU  THE  YELLOW  ROD. BUT
THAT'S ALL HE'S GOOD FOR.  (GIVE  TAPE. GET  YELLOW ROD.) THE YELLOW ROD IS ONE
OF THE 'USEFUL' RODS:  YOU'LL  NEED TO STICK IT IN THE YELLOW SLOT TO GET SOME
OF  THE  OTHERS.   TO GET TO THE YELLOW SLOT:  N.  N.  IN.  CLOSE  OUTER.  OPEN
INNER.  IN.  UP.  (YOU  ARE  NOW IN THE GRASSLANDS. THE  WEASELS  AND  UNICORNS
HERE  ARE  STRICTLY  LOCAL  COLOR.  NOT USEFUL.) S. OPEN HATCH. D.  PUT  YELLOW
ROD   IN  YELLOW  SLOT.   (PUTTING  THE YELLOW ROD IN THE YELLOW SLOT WILL TURN
ON THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING IN THE YELLOW SECTION  OF  THE   'ARTIFACT'.)   WHILE
YOU'RE  HERE.  PUT  THE  RED ROD IN THE >SECOND< RED SLOT (THIS  WILL  TURN  ON
THE  LIFE  SUPPORT  SYSTEM AND GET THAT TELL-TALE WINDEX AROMA OUT OF  THE  AIR
IN  A  FEW  TURNS.   LATER ON THIS WILL ENABLE YOU TO TRADE YOUR OLD  SPACESUIT
FOR  SOMETHING  TRULY  USEFUL  (LIKE  A BROWN ROD)).  GET CARD.  YOU'LL NEED TO
PUT THIS INTO THE COMPUTER-- I  SUSPECT IT'S  A DISK II CONTROLLER CARD-- CAN'T
BOOT UP WITHOUT ONE!


GETTING THE  PINK  ROD:   IT'S  IN  THE SPACESHIP  DOCKED  OUTSIDE  THE  YELLOW
AIRLOCK.  BE CAREFUL.  ONE  FALSE  MOVE AND  IT'S  DEEP  SPACE FOR YOU.  TO GET
THERE : U. N. D. W.  OPEN  INNER.  OUT. CLOSE  INNER.  OPEN  OUTER. GET BASKET.
(THIS BASKET CAN BE USED  TO  HOLD  THE RODS  TILL YOU NEED THEM--THAT WAY THEY
WON'T  TAKE   UP   VALUABLE   INVENTORY SPACE.)  OPEN  OUTER  (YES.  AGAIN:  IT
STUCK THE FIRST TIME!).   OUT.   ATTACH LINE  TO  SPACESUIT.   ATTACH  LINE  TO
HOOK.  PORT. GET PINK ROD.


GETTING  THE  BLUE  ROD:  IT'S  IN  THE LABORATORY.     WITH    OTHER    USEFUL
IMPLEMENTS.  TO GET  THERE:  E.  DETACH LINE  FROM  HOOK. IN. CLOSE OUTER. OPEN
INNER. IN. S.  S.   PUT  ALL  RODS IN BASKET. E. GET ALL DISKS. NOW COMES THE
TRICKY PART: THE ROD IS IMBEDDED IN THE SILVER  SPHERE.   ALL  WE  HAVE  AT OUR
DISPOSAL TO OBTAIN IT IS THE 4-POSITION DIAL AND THE TWO DISKS.... FORTUNATELY.
THESE    ARE    'TRANSPORTER    DISKS'. UNFORTUNATELY.    THEY   EXPLODE   INTO
NOTHINGNESS  IF  YOU  ALLOW   THEM   TO TOUCH.....     ANYWAY.    HERE'S    THE
PROCEDURE:  PUT RED  DISK UNDER  GLOBE. PUT BLUE  DISK  ON  FLOOR.  PUT CARD ON
GLLOBE. TURN DIAL TO 4. TURN DIAL TO 2. GET CAARD. GET BLUE ROD. GET ALL DISKS.
PUT BLUE ROD IN  BASKET.  W.  PUT  BLUE DISK  ON FLOOR. (YOU *>HAVE<* TO PUT IT
ON THE FLOOR HERE SO  THE  'MAINTENANCE MOUSE' CAN COLLECT IT AND PUT IT IN THE
GARAGE  SO YOU CAN TRANSPORT THERE (AND OUT OF TROUBLE) LATER!!!)


GETTING  THE  GOLD ROD:  N. N. N. N. W. AFT. NOW YOU'RE IN THE  COMPUTER ROOM.
OPEN  PANEL.  PUT  CARD  IN SLOOT. CLOSE PANEL.  TURN COMPUTER ON. (IT WILL
SPEW OUT  A  GOLD BAR FOR YOU). PUT GOLD ROD IN BASKET. LOOK AROUND IF YOU
LIKE. BUT THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO DO  HERE. THE ENUNCIATOR  PANEL  TELLS  YOU
WHAT YOU HAVE TO FIX  TO  PUT  THE  ARTIFACT  IN ORDER.  BUT  I'M GOING TO
TELL YOU THAT ANYWAY......


GETTING THE BROWN ROD: N. W. W.  S.  S. E.  E.  REMOVE  SUIT.   LOOK  AROUND OR
'WAIT' OR SOMETHING UNTIL THE CHIEFTAIIN COMES.  OFFER SUIT TO CHIEF.  POINT  AT
BROWN ROD.


GETTING  THE  VIOLET  ROD:  YOU HAVE NO TIME TO  PUT  THE  BROWN  ROD INN YOUR
BASKET!    FOLLOW  THE  CHIEF  WHEEN  HE LEAVES. IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GET  THE
THE  VIOLET  ROD!!!  JUST  KEEP  SAYING 'FOLLOW CHIEF' UNTIL  YOU  GET TO THE
'CENTER OF THE WARREN'.  THEN: D. CLOSE INNER.  OPEN  OUTER.  OUT.  P. P. GET
VISOR. N. MOVE SKELETON. GET VIOLET ROD (MOVE THE SKELETON ONLY ONCE!!). S. S.
PUT  RED  DISK  ON  FLOOR. STAND ON RED DISK.   SURPRISE==>  TRANSPORTER CITY.
WITH  ANY  LUCKK  YOU'LL  NOW  BE IN THE GARAGE. IF THE MOUSE HASN'T COLLECTED
THE  BLUE  DISK  YET.  YOU'LL  BE  BACK OUTSIDE THE  LABORATORY.   YOU'LL JUST
HAVE TO WAIT TILL HE COMES AND GETS IT. THEN TRANSPORT TO THE GARAGE.......


GETTING  THE  GREEN  ROD:   ENTER  BIN. (KEEP TYPING  'ENTER  BIN'  OR 'AGAIN'

THE BLACK ROD IN THE BLACK SLOT!).

GETTING TO THE CONTROL BUBBLE:  OUT. U. JUMP. FIRE GUN AT DRIVE BUBBLE.  AGAIN.
AGAIN.  (YOU  SHOULD NOW BE 'ON CONTROL BUBBLE'.) D. PUT GOLD ROD IN GOLD SLOT.
IN. PUT CLEAR ROD IN CLEAR  SLOT.  FIVE COLORED  SLOTS  WILL  APPEAR.   PUT THE
APPROPRIATE ROD  IN  EACH  SLOT-->  THE ORDER YOU DO IT IN DOESN'T MATTER.

THE  FINAL  SEQUENCE:   YOU NOW USE THE VARIOUS COLORED SPOTS TO SET THE COURSE
OF THE ARTIFACT  TOWARD  EARTH.   TOUCH LARGE SQUARE.  (THE VIEW NOW COVERS THE
AREA  FROM  THE SUN TO JUPITER).  TOUCH BROWN SPOT. (YOU WILL HAVE TO TOUCH  IT
4    TIIMES.    UNTIL   THEE   EARTH IS HIGHLIGHTED).  TOUCH VIOLET SPOT (THREE
TIMES. UNTIL THE PATH  FORMS  A  CIRCLE AROUND  THE  EARTH.  (DON'T STOP AT THE
