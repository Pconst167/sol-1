Mages with little training and experience are limited in the spells they can
cast.  As a spellcaster grows in stature, penetrating the mysteries of the
higher circles of magic, he gains the ability to cast more powerful spells.
Great power is not without cost, however.  When he casts a spell, the mage
experiences a drain in magical power equal to the level of the circle of that
spell.  Thus, a simple first level spell drains one point while a fifth level
spell, more difficult to cast, drains five.  The caster's magical power
returns within a few hours.
