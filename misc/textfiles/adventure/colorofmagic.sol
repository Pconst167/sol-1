room and take the bucket. Go up to the deck and drop a bottle of rum in each 
of the three starboard locations and watch the pirate booze himself 
overboard. Climb into the old tub of a lifeboat then bail water until you can
get the frog then wait until you are in a different boat then wait again 
until you hit the 'circumfence'. Say hello to Tethis, wait until you are 
on the island, open the door and go Rimwards and wait again 
(many many many many many many times) until Tethis arrives. Then wait some 
more until the bells clang, then wait even more until you are told to go 
outside. Go outside, say hello to Marchessa and wait again until you get to 
Krull, then, just for a change, type wait until the frog changes and 
bites the toe of Garhartra. Then attack Garhartra, open the door, 
go Widdershins, attack the hydrophobes and go W-R-R-R-U-R. Then finally 
wait until you fall. END.
