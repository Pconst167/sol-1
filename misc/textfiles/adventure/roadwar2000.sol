Solution:  Take control of one or two cities.  Search for a GUB agent by
using the look for [P]eople command.  The password is PANACEA.  This
agent may appear while the Gang is engaged in [L]ooting or Searching for
[V]ehicles, as well.  The password always stays the same.  Gain control
of one or two more cities, and stay in the same area.  Search for a
second agent using the [P]eople command, who will tell you where the GUB
is located.  This city is different every scenario.  After you learn
where the GUB is located, visit it.  Go to the city where it is, and
again search for [P]eople.  Save the game when you arrive in the City,
because when you find the GUB, the game will ask you simple copyright
protection questions.  Some answers are:  (1) there are three types of
chronies; (2) mutants are zombies; (3) Canada and Mexico have the same
number of cities.  Accept the mission from the GUB chairman.  There are
eight scientists.  Each one is located in one city.  Once again, search
for them in cities by using the [P]eople command.  They can only be
found once you have contacted the GUB.  The [P]eople command may also
bring you into contact with agents who give you general hints about
where a scientist might be.  More than one scientist can be in one area
(but not in the same city).  Find the scientists.  Note the cities
you've searched.  Searching 1-2 days in each city should be sufficient.
At some point, return some scientists to the GUB.  By now, the GUB
should have given you a radio direction finder which can locate 2
scientists.  Note that you may accidentally come upon scientists that
can be found with the RDF, reducing its value.  Importantly, once you
receive the RDF, two things happen.  One, a third bomb detonates in a
major city, making mutants a constant threat.  Two, you meet "Invader
Death Squads," which are heavily armed and armored gangs.  To defeat
them, carry many cars and many men (using the unimproved ones as decoys
and rammers), or use quick combat and instruct your men to shoot at the
wheels (the only part of the car that can't be improved!).

Strategic tips:  Santa Monica, California contains the SSI Headquarters,
where you can find chronies and many vehicle improvements.  Pittsburgh
has two foundries and a welding shop.  Detroit and Indianapolis have
vehicle improvement shops.  Chicago and New York have snow tires.
Dallas and Houston have fuel additives and food supplements,
respectively.  Cheyenne has a drill instructor.  New York and Washington
D.C. have politicians.  Minneapolis has a doctor.

Tactical tips:  Never give wine to your men in a ratio greater than one
to one.  Never let your men participate in Mardi Gras (they'll desert).
Never take over a town that's controlled by Reborners (your men will
join them).  Any town can be taken over, if you stay long enough.  Hard
fighting for a town usually also depletes its supplies.  Aim at the
tires of heavily armored vehicles.  Never ram.  Use large vehicles
instead of small ones.  Always keep antitoxin, and find some if you run
out or have none.  Healers can be found by using the [P]eople command.
Never let your men ride amusement park rides (they'll crash and be
killed).  Never stay north during December, January, and February.
Never use abstract combat.  Be wary of hiring new doctors or drill
sergeants to replace old ones.  (Politicians are much less important).
