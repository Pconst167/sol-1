Hi everyone... I guess this will complete the Strike Force Cobra story, and
will also let _you_ complete the game. :) First of all, an introduction to
the game:

A mad scientist codenamed "The Enemy" built a new kind of bomb which,
if detonated, will kill eradicate the human race. The Strike Force Cobra,
an elite team of four commandos, must stop him. In order to do this, they
have to destroy the bomb, hidden in an underground laboratory. The lab consists
of four levels. The bomb is on level 4, the deepest one. You start on level 1.
To enter the bomb room, you need a 9-digit code. There are seven scientists
in the lab, all kidnapped by the Enemy. Each one knows one of the digits. The
two remaining ones can be cracked by your portable computers, but you need
to find all the others before you can do that. In short, then - make your way
to level 4 (it looks like a negative of a photo), enter the bomb room, shoot
the computer to open your way to the bomb, and destroy it with a few grenades.

And now for the creme de la creme... the pokes, that is.
Poke 48389,0 - will stop the timer.
Poke 48567,0 - will stop the energy decrease.

And the greatest treasure of them all:
Poke 46449,0 - go through walls, doors, and all other objects - including
               the enemies! Sometimes you may need to restore the previous
               state - use Poke 46449,32, and walls will be walls again.

Have fun! I did.
