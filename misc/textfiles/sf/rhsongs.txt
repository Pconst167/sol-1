LIPS: Michael Rennie was ill
      The day the earth stood still
      But he told us where we stand
      And Flash Gordon was there
      In silver underwear
      Claude Rains was the invisible man
      Then something went wrong
      For Fay Wray and King Kong
      They got caught in a celluloid jam
      Then at a deadly pace
      It came from outer space
      And this is how the message ran:

        Anne Francis stars in Forbidden Planet

LIPS: I knew Leo G. Carroll
      Was over a barrel
      When tarantula took to the hills
      And I really got hot
      When I saw Jeanette Scott
      Fight a Triffid that spits poison and kills
      Dana Andrews said prunes
      Gave him the runes
      And passing the news lots of skills
      But when worlds colide
      Said George Pal to his bride
      I'm going to give you some terrible thrills
      Like a-

BOTH: I love you

                        OVER AT THE FRANKENSTEIN PLACE

JANET: In the velvet darkness
       Of the blackest night
       Burning bright-there's a guiding star
       No matter what or who you are
BRAD and JANET: There's a light
PHANTOM VOICES: Over at the Frankenstein Place
BRAD and JANET: There's a light
PHANTOM VOICES: Burning in the fireplace
BRAD and JANET: There's a light...a light in the darkness
       Of everybody's life
RIFF: The darkness must go
      Down the river of nights dreaming
      Flow morphia slow let the sun and light
      Come streaming into my life
      Into my life
BRAD and JANET: There's a light
PHANTOM VOICES: Over at the Frankenstein place
BRAD and JANET: There's a light
PHANTOM VOICES: Burning in the fireplace
                There's a light...a light
BRAD and JANET: In the darkness of everybody's life

                                  TIME WARP

RIFF: It's astounding. Time is fleeting
      Madness takes its toll
MAGENTA: Ahh
RIFF: But listen closely
MAGENTA: Not for very much longer
RIFF: I've got to keep control
      I remember doing the Time Warp
      Drinking those moments when
      The blackness would hit me
RIFF and MAGENTA: And the void would be calling
GUESTS: Let's do the Time Warp again
        Let's do the Time Warp again
NARRATOR: It's just a jump to the left
GUESTS: And then a step to the right
NARRATOR: With your hands on your hips
GUESTS: You bring your knees in tight
        But it's the pelvic thrust
        They really drive you insane
        Let's do the Time Warp again
        Let's do the Time Warp again
MAGENTA: It's so dreamy-Oh, fantasy free me
         So you can't see me-no, not at all
         In another dimension-with voyeuristic intention
         Well secluded I see all
RIFF: With a bit of a mind flip
MAGENTA: You're in to the time slip
RIFF: And nothing can ever be the same
MAGENTA: You're spaced out on sensation
RIFF: Like you're under sedation
GUESTS: Let's do the Time Warp again
        Let's do the Time Warp again
COLUMBIA: Well I was walking down the street
          Just having a think
          When a snake of a guy
          Gave me an evil wink
          He shook me up, it took me by surprise
          He had a pick-up truck and the devil's eyes
          He stared at me and I felt a change
          Time meant nothing-never would again
GUESTS: Let's do the Time Warp again
        Let's do the Time Warp again
NARRATOR: It's just a jump to the left
GUESTS: And then a step to the right
NARRATOR: With your hands on your hips
GUESTS: You bring your knees in tight
        But it's the pelvic thrust
        It'll really drive you insane
NARRATOR and GUESTS: Let's do the Time Warp again
                     Let's do the Time Warp again
COLUMBIA (dancing): Ah!
                    Oh Oh!
                    Ahhh!

                              SWEET TRANSVESTITE

FRANK: How d' you do
       I see you've met my faithful handyman
       He's a little brought down
       Because when you knocked
       He thought you were the candyman
       Don't get strung out by the way I look
       Don't judge a book by its cover
       I'm not much of a man
       By the light of day
       But by night I'm one hell of a lover
       I'm just a sweet transvestite
       From Transexual
       Trasylvania
       Ah, ha
       Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound
       You look like you're both pretty groovy
       Or if you want something visual that's not too abysmal
       We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie
BRAD: I'm glad we caught you at home.
      Could we use your phone?
      We're both in a bit of a hurry.
JANET: Right
BRAD: We'll just say where we are
      Then go back to the car
      We don't want to be any worry.
FRANK: Well, you got caught with a flat
       Well how about that
       Well babies don't you panic
       By the light of the night
       It'll all seem alright
       I'll get you a satanic mechanic
       I'm just a sweet transvestite
       From Transexual Transylvania
       Ha ha.
       Why don'tcha stay for the night?
RIFF: Night
FRANK: Or maybe a bite
COLUMBIA: Bite
FRANK: I could show you my favorite obsession
       I've been making a man
       With blond hair and a tan
       And he's good for relieving my tension
       I'm just a sweet transvestite
       From Transexual Transylvania
       I'm just a sweet transvestite- hip hip
GUESTS: Sweet transvestite
FRANK: From Transexual
ALL: Transylvania...Ha ha
FRANK: So come up to the lab
       And see what's on the slab
       I see you shiver with antici....pation
       But maybe the rain
       Is really to blame
       So I'll remove the cause-
       But not the symptom

     THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES

ROCKY: The sword of Damocles is hanging over my head
       And I've got the feeling someone's
       Going to be cutting the thread
RIFF: Oh!
ROCKY: Oh woe is me-my life is a misery
       Oh can't you see that I'm at the start
       Of a pretty big downer
       I woke up this morning with a start when
       I fell out of bed
GUESTS: That ain't no crime
ROCKY: And left from my dreaming was a feeling
       Of unnamable dread
GUESTS: That ain't no crime
ROCKY: My high is low-I'm dressed up with no place to go
       And all I know is I'm at the start of a pretty big downer
GUESTS: Sha la la la
        That ain't no crime
ROCKY: Oh no no no
GUESTS: Sha la la la
        That ain't no crime
ROCKY: No no no no
GUESTS: Sha la la la
        That ain't no crime
ROCKY: The sword of Damocles is hanging over my head
GUESTS: That ain't no crime
ROCKY: And I've got the feeling someone's going to be cutting the thread
GUESTS: That ain't no crime
ROCKY: Oh woe is me-my life is a mystery
       And can't you see that I'm at the start of a pretty big downer
FRANK: Oh...oh...oh
GUESTS: Sha la la la
        That ain't no crime
ALL: Sha la la la
GUESTS: That ain't no crime
ROCKY: No no no no
GUESTS: Sha la la la
        That ain't no crime
ROCKY: No no no no
GUESTS: Sha la la la
        That ain't no crime
ROCKY: No. No

                              CHARLES ATLAS SONG

FRANK: A weakling weighing ninety-eight pounds
       Will get sand in his face when kicked to the ground
       And soon in the gym
       With a determined chin
       The sweat from his pores
       As he works for his cause
       Will make him glisten and gleam
       And with massage and just a little bit of steam
       He'll be pink and quite clean
       He'll be a strong man
       Oh, honey-
GUESTS: But the wrong man
FRANK: He'll eat nutritous high protein
       And swallow raw eggs
       Try to build up his shoulders
       His chest, arms and legs
       Such an effort
       If he only knew of my plan
       In just seven days
ALL: I can make you a man
FRANK: He'll do press-ups and chin-ups
       Do the snatch, clean and jerk
       He thinks dynamic tension must be hard work
       Such strenuous living I just don't understand
       When in just seven days-oh baby
       I can make you a man

                     WHATEVER HAPPENED TO SATURDAY NIGHT

EDDIE: Whatever happened to Saturday night
       When you dressed up sharp and
       You felt all right
       It don't seem the same since cosmic light
       Came into my life and I thought
       I was divine
       I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go
       And listen to the music on the radio
       A saxophone was blowing on a
       Rock and roll show
       And we climbed in the back seat
       And we really had a good time
ALL: Hot Patootie bless my soul
     I really love that rock and roll
EDDIE and GUESTS: Hot patootie bless my soul
                  I really love that rock and roll
                  (Repeat three times.)
EDDIE: My head used to swim
       From the perfume I smelled
       My hands kind of fumbled with
       Her white plastic belt
       I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and
       That's when I'd melt
       And she whispered in my ear
       Tonight she really was mine
       Get back in front and put some hair oil on
       Buddy Holly was singing his
       Very last song
       With your arm around your girl
       You tried to sing along
       It felt pretty good, whooo-really had
       A good time
ALL: Hot patootie bless my soul
     I really love that rock and roll
     (Repeat.)

                          CHARLES ATLAS SONG REPRISE

FRANK: But a deltoid and a bicep
       A hot groin and a tricep
       Makes me-ooooh-shake
       Makes me want to take
       Charles Atlas by the hand
FRANK and ALL: In just seven days-oh baby
               I can make you a man
FRANK: I don't want no dissension
       Just dynamic tension
JANET: I'm a muscle fan
FRANK and GUESTS: In just seven days

JANET: I was feeling done in
       Couldn't win
       I'd only ever kissed before
COLUMBIA: You mean she's a-
MAGENTA: Uh huh
JANET: I thought there's no use getting
       Into heavy petting
       It only leads to trouble
       And seat wetting
       Now all I want to know
       Is how to go
       I've tasted blood and I want more
COLUMBIA and MAGENTA: More, more, more!
JANET: I'll put up no resistance
       I want to stay the distance
       I've got an itch to scratch
       I need assistance
       Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me
       I want to be dirty
       Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
       Creature of the night
       Then if anything grows
       While you pose
       I'll oil you up and drop you down
MAGENTA and COLUMBIA: Down down down
JANET: And that's just one small fraction
       Of the main attraction
       You need a friendly hand
       Oh, I need action
       Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me
       I wanna be dirty
       Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
       Creature of the night
COLUMBIA: Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me
MAGENTA: I want to be dirty
COLUMBIA: Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
MAGENTA: Creature of the night

                                EDDIE'S TEDDY

SCOTT: From the day he was born, he was trouble
       He was the thorn in his mutter's side
       She tried in vain
NARRATOR: But he never caused her nothing but shame
SCOTT: He left home the day she died
       From the day she was gone
       All he wanted
       Was rock and roll porn und a motor bike
       Shooting up junk
NARRATOR: He was a low-down cheap little punk
SCOTT: Taking everyone for a ride
DR. SCOTT and ALL: When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy
                   You knew he was a no good kid
                   When he threatened your life with a switch blade knife
FRANK: What a guy
JANET: Makes you cry
SCOTT: Und I did
COLUMBIA: Everybody shoved him
          I very nearly loved him
          I said, 'Hey, listen to me
          Stay sane inside insanity'
          But he locked the door and threw away they key
SCOTT: But he must have been drawn
           In to something
           Making him warn me in a note which reads
ALL: What's it say?  What's it say?
EDDIE'S VOICE: I'm out of my head
               Oh, hurry or I may be dead
               They mustn't carry out their evil deeds

FRANK: I'll tell you once
       I won't tell you twice
       You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss
       Your apple pie
       Don't taste too nice
       You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss
       I've laid the seed
       It should be all you need
       You're as sensual
       As a pencil
       Wound up like an 'E' or first string
       When we make it
       Did ya hear a bell ring?
       Y' got a block
       Take my advice
       You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss
       The transducer
       Will seduce yah

FRANK: Planet, shmanet, Janet!
       You'd better wise up-Janet Weiss
       You'd better wise up
       Build your thighs up
       You better wise up.

FRANK: Don't get hot and flustered
       Use a bit of mustard
BRAD: You're a hot dog
      But you'd better not try to hurt her
      Frank Furter
SCOTT: You're a hot dog
           But you'd better not try to hurt her
           Frank Furter
JANET: You're a hot dog....

                              ROSE TINT MY WORLD

COLUMBIA: It was great
          When it all began
          I was a regular Frankie fan
          But it was over when he had the plan
          To start working on a muscle-man
          Now the only thing that gives me hope
          Is my love of a certain dope
          Rose tints my world keeps me
          Safe from my trouble and pain
ROCKY: I'm just seven hours old
       Truly beautiful to behold
       I wish sombody should be told
       My libido hasn't been controlled
       Now the only thing I've come to trust
       Is an orgasmic rush of lust
       Rose tints my world keeps me
       Safe from my trouble and pain
BRAD: It's beyond me
      Help me, Mommy
      I'll be good you'll see
      Take this dream away
      What's this, let's see
      I feel sexy
      What's come over me. Whoa-
      Here it comes again
JANET: Oh I-I feel released
       Bad times deceased
       My confidence has increased
       Reality is here
       The game has been disbanded
       My mind has been expanded
       It's a gas that Frankie's landed
       His lust is so sincere
FRANK: What ever happened to Fay Wray?
       That delicate satin-draped frame
       As it clung to her thigh
       How I started to cry
       'Cause I wanted to be dressed just the same
       Give yourself over to absolute pleasure
       Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh
       Erotic nightmares beyond any measure
       And sensual daydreams to treasure forever-
       Can't you just see it. Oh, oh, hooo. Oh
       Don't dream it. Be it
       Don't dream it. Be it
       Don't dream it. Be it
       Don't dream it. Be it
ALL: Don't dream it. be it
     (Repeat four times.)
SCOTT: Ach, we've got to get out of this trap  
       Before this decadence saps our wills
       I've got to be strong and try to hang on
       Or else my mind may well snap
       Und my life will be lived for the thrill
BRAD: It's beyond me
      Help me, Mommy
JANET: God bless Lili St. Cyr.
FRANK: My my my my my my my my...
       I'm a wild and an untamed thing
       I'm a bee with a deadly sting
       You gotta hit, and your mind goes ping
       You're heart'll thump and your blood will sing
       So let the party and sounds rock on
       We're gonna shake it 'til the life has gone
       Rose tint my world
       Keep me safe from my trouble and pain
ALL: We're wild and untamed things
     We're bees with a deadly sting
     You gotta hit and your mind goes ping
     Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing
     So let the party and sounds rock on
     We're gonna shake you 'til the life has gone...
     Rose tint my world
     Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.

RIFF: Frank-N-Furter
      It's all over
      Your mission is a failure
      Your life style's too extreme
      I'm your new commander
      You now are my prisoner

GUESTS: Dealing

FRANK and GUESTS: I'm going home

BRAD: I've done a lot
      God knows I've tried
      To find the truth
      I've even lied
      But all I know
      Is down inside
ALL: I'm bleeding
JANET: And super heroes
       Come to feast
       To taste the flesh
       Not yet deceased
       And all I know
       Is still the beast
ALL: Is feeding
NARRATOR: And crawling on the planet's face

          Lost in time
          And lost in space
ALL: And meaning
