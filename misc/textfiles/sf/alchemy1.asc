       While it hasn't  made  the  front  pages  yet, alchemy is enjoying a
       revival. The truth is, it never went  away. It merely has kept a low
       profile. Yet, more  attention  is being given to alchemy  than  ever
       before. We will  look  at some of the reasons for this, but first it
       might be well to explain what we mean by the term "alchemy".

       A one word  definition  is  'evolution'   or  `transmutation`.   The
       implication is, one thing is being changed into another  thing.   As
       an every day  example, consider the sun. It is truly an alchemist as
       it constantly is transmuting helium  into  hydrogen.  Wine  that has
       gone sour, is  wine  that has been transmuted into  vinegar.  Modern
       alchemists understanding that  the best kind of vinegar is made from
       red wine, deliberately try to turn wine sour.

       However, wineries add  sulfides to  the  wine  to  prevent  souring.
       Fortunately some wineries do not do this and there  are also ways of
       eliminating the sulfides  from  wine.   And  yes, this transmutation
       includes turning lead into gold!

       So we are surrounded by everyday examples  of alchemy. The making of
       a pot of  tea  is an alchemical process as it extracts  an  essence,
       called sulphur by  alchemists  to color the water which we then call
       tea. It might be noted that the term  sulphur is an alchemical 'code
       word' that, in this instance, refers to the natural  oils in the tea
       (or in any  plant).  There are many more examples but our purpose is
       to chronicle past and current events in this recondite domain.

       Alchemy is a  discipline  that  started  way  back  in the annals of
       history as best can be determined.  Ancient Greeks, Indians, Chinese
       and Egyptians were  practitioners  of alchemy. However,  we  do  not
       intend to go  that  far  back.  We  will  return  to the days of the
       sixties and seventies so that we may have some insight to Dr. Albert
       Reidel.

       Frater Albertus, as  he  preferred   being  called,  supervised  and
       operated what is called a "mystery school", in the  Wasatch  montain
       range in Utah.  Located  in  the  Salt  Lake  City area, this school
       taught a curriculum  of very interesting  subjects.  These  included
       Qabalah, the ancient  Hebrew  technique  of spiritual  growth  which
       incorporates the tenets    of    magic,   astro-cyclical   pulsation
       (astrology) and, Alchemy. The school  was  run  in  the  manner of a
       Gurdjieff "Fourth Way" school.

       Dr. Israel Regardie,  who  was my friend and mentor  suggested  this
       school to me.  At  the  same  time, the person who had taught me the
       rudiments of Qabala, Dan T., also referred to this school indicating
       I would do well to look into it. Simultaneously,  Mary F. invited me
       to her home to meet two people who had a unusual 'hobby', alchemy!

       These two people.  Kurt  and Helene von K. were destined  to  become
       good friends and teachers of mine. They talked about alchemy and how
       they cured their  son  of  mental  dysfunction  through  the  use of
       alchemical preparations. They showed  us  a  small  vial  of an oily
       substance and declared this was "oil of iron".

       As a graduate civil engineer with an MBA and 20 years  in the 'hard'
       and logical discipline  of  information systems, I could not readily
       accept what they told me.  My engineering background always insisted
       that I should see, feel, taste  and  touch  things  to  verify their
       reality. I had never heard of oil of iron, nor the  oil of any other
       metal, so it  could  not possibly exist! That was my mind set at the
       time. Nonetheless, they managed to capture my interest.

       What got me excited was, they had  studied under one Frater Albertus
       at the very same school I had so recently heard so  much  about, the
       Paracelsus Research Society!   They  explained  how to apply for the
       school and tantalized Mary and I with stories of alchemy.

       It did not take long for me to get  on  the telephone with 'Doc' and
       with Dan.  They  urged  me  to  go.  The  clincher   was,  Bill,  an
       Episcopalian priest committed  to  attend  and Mary decided to go as
       well.

       We applied, were accepted and soon  found  ourselves  in  Salt  Lake
       City, at the P.R.S. awaiting the commencment of the Prima class. The
       night before, the  meeting  room  was abuzz with the  new  students.
       Sixteen in all,  all  ready  to  start  the  first of seven two-week
       courses at P.R.S. to learn the rudiments of alchemy.

       Everyone was intensely interested  in  everyone  else as to how they
       came here, what  they  were  "into"  and so on. It turned  out,  the
       students were "into"  a  variety  of things. There was a couple from
       Canada who had studied alchemy, they  said, for many years under the
       guidance of the  god  Mercury.  There was an opera  singer  and  her
       husband who was a conductor of a symphony as well as being a concert
       pianist. He had been a child prodigy and had studied under Kofdaly.

                                      Page 2





       There was a   sweet  old  lady  in  her  late  70s  who  was  "into"
       crocheting; a computer programmer;  a  chiropractor; a chap who told
       us he was  the master of the martial art of swords  (and  gave  some
       fascinating demonstrations of  power);  a high energy Ph'D candidate
       from Norway studying   at  M.I.T.;   an   industrial   engineer;   a
       surrealistic artist; a chemist (who was to perform  some  incredible
       alchemical experiments later on); a medical doctor; a priest; a lady
       who had been the secretary to a state governor and a civil engineer.

       A mixed crew   indeed!   Yet   before  long,  sharing  this  special
       experience, we came to be good friends and most of those friendships
       are as strong as ever today.  Everyone  button-holed  everyone  else
       and got into serious discussions of all sorts.

       The martial arts expert, in answer to my question  as  to  what this
       'bought him', said: "I can tell past lifetimes from the aura". Well!
       I urged him  to 'read' my past lifetime. He  squinted at me, sort of
       over and behind me and I could scarce  conceal  a smirk. Boy, was he
       'coming on'!  After a few minutes he told me I had  been a worker in
       the pyramids of Egypt but was killed in an accident. I was stunned!

       This was the precise substance of a recurring dream I had as a teen.
       That I was  working,  as  a stone mason in a pyramid when a block of
       stone struck me in the head and I  died! This little incident was to
       be the first  of  many "weird" and often disquieting  events  during
       this class.

       The next morning, we assembled in the meeting room, per instructions
       from 'Soror Emmy'  bright  and  early.  We  could  hardly  await the
       arrival of 'Frater Albertus'. He arrived promptly and seated himself
       at the head of the table saying, as  he  was to do for the beginning
       of every class  I  took,  "Good  Morning Everyone" and  then  became
       silent and allowed  his  eyes  to  rest  for  a  few moments on each
       student.

       We all felt he could read our minds  and  the  class  got  a  little
       restless. Then he  closed  his  eyes  and seemed to  drift  off...or
       something. After what  seemed  an  eternity,  his  voice, strong and
       clear said: "GOD is good". He then lapsed into silence and the class
       closed its respective eyes and waited. After a short time, he spoke:
       "God is GOOD" putting the inflection  on  the  last word of the same
       sentence. Again a silence followed by his speaking: "God IS good".

       We meditated on the import of this for several minutes  and  then he
       opened his eyes  (as  did  the  class),  looked  around  at everyone
       thoughtfully and then  started to  dilate  on  this  sentence.  Each
       morning of every class he would start with this "Morning Meditation"
       as he called it.

       He was amazing in that he never used notes, he always  had  his talk
       perfectly memorized. And  he  never  gave  the same one twice in the
       seven years I was to take these classes!   It  was  observed that he
       always wore a  cardigan  sweater  and that the sweater  was  in  the
       "correct" color for  that  day.   That is, red on Tuesday, Orange on
       Wednesday, Black on  Saturday,  etc.  These  are  the  corresponding
       "planetary colors".

       In many ways he was truly astonishing, he had been  born  on  May 5,
       1911, 1:40 am in Dresden, Germany. His hands were very large,

                                      Page 3





       belying the fact that he was an artist with a delicate touch. He was
       very powerful as  I  found  out, yet very gentle and patient. Frater
       Albertus was to initiate me into alchemy  and  be my teacher for the
       next ten years, until his death.

       Each day followed the same format, a morning meditation  followed by
       a session on  Qabala  where  we  studied  the Tree of Life and other
       Qabalistic philosophies. He also  taught  Astro-Cyclical  Pulsations
       showing how all of life follows (seemingly) predictable cycles, just
       like a sine wave. And, of course, the mainstay of  the  studies  was
       Alchemy.

       Always a session  on  theory followed by practical lab work where we
       could prove (or disprove) the theory  given.  We  learned  that  all
       substances consist of  three  essentials  and  that  they  could  be
       separated, purified and put back together again into a higher state.

       He helped guide us through the morass of alchemical writngs so often
       written in obscure  words  and  more obscure meanings. The theory he
       gave us helped  to understand these  writings  and  reveal  them  as
       extremely valuable aids to the student.

       He himself exemplified his belief in creating written records.  Each
       experiment that was performed, was carefully written  up  in  notes.
       These notes were,  of  course,  kept by the student, and one set was
       put on file in the P.R.S. records.

       The three basics which Frater told  us all things were made of, were
       called by the  alchemists,  Sulphur,  Salt and Mercury.  These  were
       analogs for Soul,  Body  and Spirit. Or, Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
       or Brahma, Shiva, Vishnu, or Solids, Liquids, Gasses.

       In fact, a large set of 'triplicities' fit these terms. He described
       and showed us the differences in these  three  as they varied in the
       different kingdoms of vegetables, minerals and animals. He taught us
       how to extract these, from plants, how to purify  them  and  how  to
       conjoin them again. His purpose was to show us the parallels between
       the kingdoms and  how, using this spagyric technique, one could make
       medicines. Potent medicines.

       Medicines that were, in the main, different from those prescribed by
       orthodox physicians, yet  medicines   that   have   been  known  for
       millenia, preserved in "old wives tales", American  Indian  lore and
       in other 'occult'  respositories.  As  we shall see, these medicines
       are being "revived" and are available to the public. It is my belief
       that it is from alchemical medicines  pernicious  diseases  will  at
       last be overcome.

       These medicines consisted  initially of herbs and  plants.  Then  we
       progressed to working  with  such  metals  as  Antimony and Iron. In
       P.R.S., we used,  as  a  text, Basil  Valentine's  incredible  book,
       "Triumphal Chariot of Antimony".

       Herein lie explicit, clear instructions on how to transmute  a rank,
       poisonous element into  one  that can be used medicinally. This was,
       to be sure, Antimony.  From this  matter,  all  manner  of marvelous
       medicines can be made.

       While Basil Valentine set down many 'recipes' there are a few

                                      Page 4





       "blinds" in his  writings.  To  be absolutely sure in preparing such
       medicaments, one should seek a teacher  to guide the student through
       the little traps set for the unwary.

       It is interesting to note that in the March 1987  issue  of  "AMBIX"
       magazine, Dr. Lawrence  Principe,  now  at Johns Hopkins University,
       wrote an article  in  which  he  received   a  government  grant  to
       replicate the work done by Valentine in "Triumphal Chariot".

       His research proved to be invaluable as he showed a  few  'traps' in
       the work and   developed  techniques  to  obtain  the  "Tincture  of
       Antimony" by making  this  healing   substance  from  the  "glass"of
       antimony.

       In a conversation with him, I indicated it was not so much a miracle
       that he was indeed able to replicate the experiments,  but  that  he
       got the government  to  pay  for  it!  Larry  injects the scientific
       disciplines into an arcane subject.

       In a different  operation,  we  separated  the  essences  of  common
       chicken eggs and  from  the  sulphur  thereof, produced  a  medicine
       salutary in incidences of artheriosclerosis.

       This substance, an  oil,  is  also  marvelous as a topical. Jody, my
       wife, will not be without it now as a skin care product. The metals,
       having long absorbed planetary influences,  are  far  more  powerful
       than herbs in healing.

       Consider the energy in a half fingernail covered  with  Uranium.  It
       could blow away  a  city, such as Hiroshima . How wonderful it would
       be if this   energy  were  harnassed   for   healing   rather   than
       destruction!

       Frater told us of the "Philosopher's Mercury" and of  the  "Stone of
       the Philosophers", legendary  alchemical  items. He did not show us,
       directly, how to create these things,  but  gave  us hints, stories,
       analogies and insights.

       His method was, true to the code of alchemy, NOT  to  give  anything
       away on a platter, but to make you work for it. To sweat for it. So,
       it was to  be years later on, that marvelous day that I succeeded in
       making some potent alchemical, medicinal  products  as  well  as the
       sought-for goal of the alchemists, mercury.

       Oh, not quicksilver,  but  the Philosophcal Mercury.  The  Universal
       Dissolvent.  When my  friend  and  teacher Dan T., helped me achieve
       this goal, I literally fell on my  knees to thank the Father for his
       grace in discovering  this  secret  to me! This is  a  product  that
       thousands have strived for and yet few have obtained.

       Through all of  this, Frater was ever mindful of and conveyed to us,
       the goodness and love of our common  father  for  all  his children.
       Indeed, as indicated  by  Valentine  and others, the  revelation  of
       preparing these alchemical gifts were a direct gift of God.

       I don't think  anyone  in  this  domain doubts that! To augment this
       spiritual aspect, Frater read to us from such canonical texts as the
       (King James) Bible. He "opened us up" to new ideas as to how Qabalah
       and Alchemy were quite prevalent in this Holy book.

                                      Page 5





       In fact, we  were  all  amazed  as  he  offered proof-after-proof to
       substantiate his statement that the Bible is a Manual of Alchemy and
       contained vast secrets for those who have eyes to see.

       In my classes  and seminars, I cite  examples  from  such  canonical
       texts as the Bible, to show how these texts are written in a code. A
       symbolic code that  must be penetrated in order to  glean  the  true
       (and hidden) meaning.

       As an example,  there is a section in John that shows how to prepare
       the Philosophical Mercury! Genesis  is a treasure house of mysteries
       not discerned by  the  casual  reader. As Paracelsus  told  us,  the
       Qabala (a Spiritual  discipline  that is part and parcel of alchemy)
       opens all sealed epistles.

       At the end of the seven year cycle  at P.R.S., I had absorbed a good
       deal of alchemical knowledge. In fact, I got "hooked"  on  it.  As a
       former counsellor in  a drug program, this is the only "addiction" I
       can safely say is healthy!

       Perhaps equally important to the teachings,  were the many different
       groups of people  I  had met. Our bonding at P.R.S.  enabled  us  to
       remain in close  touch, even to this day. Subsequent to the classes,
       I met fellow alchemists from every part of the globe.

       We too maintain a 'network'. Now while  we  were still attending PRS
       classes, Frater founded  "PARALAB"  a company chartered  to  prepare
       alchemical or "spagyrical"  (as  they  are  more  correctly  called)
       preparations for public sale. These were both medicinal and cosmetic
       items. (Unfortunately, Paralab plroved to be 'before its time').

       He also wrote quite a few books.  He  taught  the classes, mowed the
       lawns, and was a man of boundless energy. However,  he once told as,
       that all this  would  end.  That  alchemical  mystery  schools  each
       operated in their own cycle and PRS also had to end. But before this
       came about, he "transmuted" PRS into PARACELSUS COLLEGE.  He dreamt,
       and set the  ideas  down  on  paper,   of   TRISTAR,  a  spectacular
       alchemical research and healing center.

       Woven into the architecture were the symbols of alchemy.  A  sort of
       modern Gothic cathedral.  Plans were drawn up, models made to scale,
       monies were begun to be appropriated, then he died. It was July 1984
       when a dream and a reality left this plane.

       Since he for   some   reason   did  not  groom  someone  to  be  his
       replacement, the light has gone out.   The  college sits idly and no
       classes are being taught. Books he had in manuscript  form may never
       see the light of day. There is no one on the horizon to pick up the
       torch he lit.  BUT,  he  inculcated alchemy into many who will never
       forget him! And, more germane, who  will  continue  to carry out the
       work in their own unique ways.

       The people whose  lives  he touched may number into  the  thousands.
       Many are actively engaged in either "practical" alchemy or in allied
       research. Most of  those  are  in communication with one another, to
       share ideas and results.

       My personal activity in networking started with my producing retyped
       and translated copies of old alchemical texts. This has caused many

                                      Page 6





       a student to  knock  at my door. It is a rare day when I don't write
       SOME fellow alchemist SOMEwhere in the world!

       There are more alchemists than are  dreamt  of, Poland, Switzerland,
       France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, India,  Belgium, Spain,
       Portugal, Australia and other countries.

       Before examining alchemy  today,  let  us  take  a brief look at the
       principals behind the phenomena of alchemy.

       Firstly, as indicated, alchemists consider ALL things as composed of
       three essential, sulphur,  salt and  mercury.  These  are  actually,
       consciouness (sulphur), a  vivifying  life  force  (mercury)  and  a
       vehicle in which the latter two are housed (salt).

       They correspond to soul, body and spirit, in that order. This is the
       same spirit and  soul  as found in religion. However, in alchemy, we
       learn how to separate these three so that they can be seen and held.

       This is part of the vast field of  alchemical  theory  but  a theory
       that allows direct proof to be made. You can see, weigh,  and  taste
       the three essentials from the various kingdoms.  This enables you to
       KNOW and experience their existence rather than having faith.

       Alchemy trades off knowledge for belief!

       In the Indian  alchemy  called  Ayurveda,  the same principles apply
       under the term  "Gunas" and include  Sattva  (consciousness),  Rajas
       (spirit or energy) and Tamas (body or mass).

       Techniques for separation of the three principles are  available  as
       well as teachings   for   the   "Three  Fold  Process",  Separation,
       Purification and cohobation.

       As an example, in the plant world,  one  can  extract the alchemical
       sulphur; which is the essential oil. Then one can extract,  from the
       putriified plant, the spirit. This exhibits itself as alcohol.

       Happily, "store bought"  ethyl  alcohol will do nicely. Finally, the
       residue of the plant, the 'fecal matter'  is burned or calcined to a
       white ash or salt.

       These are all  purified  and then brought back together  (cohobated)
       and through a  certain  process  can  be  formed  into  a stone-like
       matter. A "Plant Stone". So, we have  killed  the plant to enable it
       to give up its soul and spirit. Then we have re-united them and thus
       resurrected them in a new and glorified body.

       This product is the highest form of the plant attainable.

       Philosophically speaking, note that the plant could  not  do  it for
       itself. It needed   "  a  higher  power"  (in  this  case,  man)  to
       accomplish this highest transmutation.  The plant stone can not only
       perform interesting physical phenomena, but is an extremely powerful
       medicine. What it will cure depends  on what plant  or  herb  it was
       made from. The laws of astrology apply here.

       The plant stone  is  also  a teaching device as its confection is an
       exact analog of how to make a stone in the other kingdoms. The

                                      Page 7





       curative powers of   the  plant  stone  are  the  focussed  and  the
       concentered healing powers of the original herb.

       If the herb had been rosemary, the  part  of  the body it would heal
       would be the heart as rosemary is a sun plant and  the  sun  governs
       the heart.

       Further, the sage  plant,  governed  by Venus which also governs the
       kidneys, would be  useful  in  kidney   problems.   Mercury  governs
       valerian and the thyroid so a goiter condtion might  be eased with a
       tincture from the  valerian  plant  or,  more  likely  CURED  with a
       valerian plant stone.

       While the sulphur   is   the   major   healing   agent,   utilizing,
       spagyrically ALL the parts of the plant, a more efficacious medicine
       will obtain.

       Going a step further, we know that planets also have  rulership over
       metals as well as plants and specific parts of the body. The Sun for
       example rules gold  and  Venus  rules  copper.  The  Sun  also rules
       sunflowers, frankincense and rue as well as the heart.

       It should be clear then, that a medicine  cna  be  made for specific
       parts of the  body  from  metals. And that since metals  have  "been
       around" longer, absorbing beneficial rays, they will be more potent.

       Recall the analog  of  Uranium!  How to do it-make a tincture from a
       metal?  Why just  like one does with  the  plants.   "As  above,  so
       below". I can personally attest to the efficacy of  Aureum  Potabile
       or tincture of gold. The process is one of extracting the sulphur of
       gold, purifying it and using this product as a medicine.

       As mentioned, if  one  could  combine  the other two essentials, the
       effect would be absolutely astonishing.  However,  getting the other
       two essentials in the mineral kingdom is not so easily done!

       Returning to the present, what is happening now?   Sources  tell  me
       that more alchemical  information  is being made available than ever
       before. Anyone working in this field  can  tell you that. Alchemy is
       said to have Sufi roots.

       Frater Albertus in his book "The Alchemist of the Rockie  Mountains"
       refers to this.  He  went  so  far  as  to say that in the HinduKush
       mountains, in a little town called  Nuristan,  alchemists  were busy
       converting base metals into gold. Their purpose was  to  prepare for
       the financing of  the  coming avatar. An atlas shows this town to be
       in Afghanistan.

       Did you ever wonder why the Soviets  were  so  bent  on getting into
       Afghanistan? There weren't   all   that   many   natural   resources
       available. In fact,  it  is  only a very hardy person that can eke a
       living from that difficult and hostile  country.  So  what  did they
       want? Could it be they heard that someone was producing  gold there?
       Maybe even mass producing it? Who can say with certainty?

       The same sources  mentioned,  said  that  the  Adepts who were there
       moved to France well in advance of  the  Russians.  Again, anyone in
       this field will tell you that, yes indeed, France  is  a  hot bed of
       alchemical activity. More groups being formed, more books being

                                      Page 8





       written, etc.  Lets  consider  some  specifics  in various countries
       including France.

       Australia is very "hot" when it comes to alchemy. As an example, Dr.
       Manfred Junius has formed AUSTRALHERBA to formulate various spagyric
       products. He combines the essences  of  herbs (all three essentials)
       with honey and other natural substances.

       These products will nourish the body like no other  substances  can.
       His herbal wines  are  the  spirits of plants extracted purified and
       combined with other  essences  to   create   an   invigorating   and
       stimulatng beverage. These qualities are imbued by the herbs
       used.

       Would you believe: "A healthy wine"? These products  are  now  being
       distributed in the  United States. Dr. Junius, a friend, has written
       excellent books on alchemy, gives  concerts playing the Sitar and he
       also teaches alchemy  and otherwise shares that which  he  has  been
       given through lectures and seminars.

       Dr. Junius will  be  in Dallas the last week of July 1990 to teach a
       one week course in Alchemy.

       Jurgen Klein, together with his wife  Ulrike,  have formed 'Jurlique
       Ageless Skin Care Products'. He was a student of Rudolph Steiner and
       taught at the  Waldorf School. Dr. Steiner was a brilliant  man  and
       his pioneering work  with  herbs  and plants are carried on today by
       the Waleda Co. who offer various health and cosmetic preparations.

       Dr. Conway of New Zealand, who was a student of Frater Albertus, (as
       was Dr. Junius) founded a firm to compound creams and emolients from
       natural ingredients using spagyric  techniques.  That is, alchemical
       processes.

       On Connaught Circus. in New Delhi, we find the "Ayurvedic  Pharmacy"
       where alchemical products   are   sold  over  the  counter  and  are
       compounded to prescription. Out in  the  front  of  the pharmacy, we
       find workers with huge iron mortars and pestles.

       With it they grind metals laboriously by hand for months.  Day after
       day they grind a particular metal or gem into a powder so fine it is
       almost a liquid.   These  are  then  treated  and  mixed  with other
       ingredients to make medicines.

       Diamond powder will yield a medicine  for the brain, and gold bashma
       (oxide) is salutary  for  the  heart.  And many Indian  preparations
       contain shilajeet which is obtained from a certain type of rock from
       the Himalayas.

       This rock, under  the  influence  of moonlight, oozes out a tar like
       substance. It is this tar-like material  that  is  used  to  provide
       medicinal effects.

       Alchemy is especially flourishing today in France. Jean Debuis leads
       a group called  "Les  Philosophes  de  la Nature". The  organization
       boasts a membership of over 1500 people, all practicing alchemy.

       I mentioned this  organization  to  friends  in  Colorado and it was
       decided to organize an American branch. The lessons from France are

                                      Page 9





       translated into English  and  offered to English-speaking alchemical
       students as a correspondence course.

       The lessons span a number of year  and  include  Qabala  as  well as
       Spiritual and Practical  Alchemy.  These lessons are  being  offered
       today. And Karin Kabbalah  in Jasper Georgia, offers a very complete
       set of lessons dealing with the Qabala.

       In the fall of 1986 I spent a week with an alchemical society called
       Filiation SOLAZAREFF. They  held  a  'pilgrimage'  in  the  woods of
       southern France. The  proved alchemy  can  be  done  "in  the  wild"
       without the trappings   of  modern  equipment  and   "store   bought
       chemicals".

       Solazareff is a  powerful  and charismatic man who is well versed in
       alchemy. He and  his  followers   consider   themselves  to  be  the
       'guardians of alchemy' and in particular in the service of "La Dame"
       (the Virgin).

       In Germany, Barbara Theiss formulates herbal medicines  and  markets
       them. And in  Germany,  long a bastion of alchemy, numerous Hermetic
       groups flourish.

       In Belgium Dr.I. Beck spearheads alchemical  studies  in Antwerp and
       in Bruxelles Marcel  Jirousek  is  researching  the   properties  of
       magnesium as a cure for AIDS.

       In Switzerland, a group that studied under Augusto Pancaldi are busy
       translating his writings  from  Italian  to German. (While my group,
       R.A.M.S. is busy translating German  into  English!)  Augusto  was a
       gentle and knowledgeable alchemist.

       It was he who arranged for Frater Albertus and Eugene Canseliet (the
       latter served under the master Fulcanelli, who legend  reputes to be
       hundreds of years   old!)   to  meet  and  exchange  views.   It  is
       regretable that all three of these  giants  of  alchemy  have passed
       through transition. However, Urs G. and Alois W.  keep  the  work of
       Pancaldi ongoing.

       Siegfried H. in  Canada reports that there is a Swiss PRS group that
       follows the precepts laid down by Frater Albertus even to the extent
       that they make spagyric preparations.

       Also in Canada, Ralph F. has started  an  alchemical study group. In
       Spain Julian P. and in Portugal Jose A., typify alchemists who, with
       members of their  groups,  search  the  writings   of   the  ancient
       alchemists to extract   clues   to   be  more  successful  in  their
       alchemical endeavors.

       Germany, Switzerland and  England   have   organizations  publishing
       alchemical journals. Arthur  Fehres,  in Australia,  relates  he  is
       working on a new technique to obtain oil of iron. He teaches alchemy
       in two-week seminars.

       It will be  recalled  that  oil  of  iron  is  helpful  in  problems
       concerning the head.  It  has  proved   most   effective  in  severe
       headaches and might prove effective in amnesia and  other such "head
       related" problems.  Better   than   anything  you  can  get  in  the
       drugstore we might add!

                                      Page 10





       Paul Baynes in England is making spagyric extractions of the herb Fo
       Ti Tieng. The  Chinese  refer  to  this  herb as one containing "the
       Elixir of Life" and use it to promote longevity.

       Finally,  my friend,  Pierre  Munier   has  developed  a  method  to
       solidify quicksilver and he shapes it into religious and magical
       shapes. He learned his alchemy from teachers in India. He also makes
       and sells purified oils of metals.

       In America, alchemy is also alive and well. Willis  W.  is following
       the general lines of study as Paul Baynes but compounds his products
       from cactus, aloe  vera  and  creosote. He is quite involved in bio-
       agro products, perhaps not so alchemical  but of great importance to
       preserve this planet nonetheless.

       Robbie Eure and Art F. have combined talents to produce a remarkable
       salve combining aloe vera and gold. This salve I have used (and help
       distribute) is amazing  in  the  relief of pain from  a  variety  of
       causes.

       Betty McK, in San Diego, discovered that by heating ethyl alcohol in
       a small flask,  the  alcohol  will  gradually turn color and finally
       congeal and become  a dark brown mass just like chocolate syrup.

       Moreover, in time, the mass will  start  to  pulse or beat....like a
       heart! If I  had not seen this phenomena myself, I  would  not  have
       believed it.   What  it  is  we do not yet know. All we know is that
       the combined action of a sandbath,  morning  light  from  an Eastern
       window and a green light shining on it makes it behave in a peculiar
       fashion!

       Greg Collins relates that due to a history of family colonic cancer,
       he had a  check up. To his great dismay, polyps were  discovered  in
       his colon by  his  physician.  He  decided  to  try  some alchemical
       preparations and took a colloidal extract combining gold, silver and
       copper. In addition, he took three  drops  of  gold  tincture once a
       week. Five weeks    later,   his   physician,   after    exploratory
       examination, announced "The  polyps  went  away".  A check-up in May
       this year re-confirmed the efficacy of the gold tincture.

       Mary Lynne of Ohio read a passage in Biblical Exodus that gave her a
       clue to making perfumes. It gave her insight on how to extract, from
       a handful of dried flower petals,  copious  quantities  of essential
       oils. From this oil she made delic ate and exquisite  perfumes.  Her
       pupil Pete B. still produces perfumes from the generated oils.

       George F. is  overseeing  the  printing  of  a  book  by  Mary Lynne
       describing her techniques.  George,   a  beautiful  man  and  friend
       conducts private research  into alchemy and has been  a  fifty  year
       member of an esoteric RC order, AMORC.

       Dan T.used his knowledge of alchemy to make herbal flavorings. These
       are used to  create  delicious  beverages  often  found  for sale in
       health food stores.  Dr.  Jack Hinze  and  his  son  Shane  have  an
       organization  (Apotheca Naturale)  that  produces   a   variety   of
       spagyric tinctures. Dr.  Dan  Clark, of Melbourne Florida has formed
       Bioactive Nutrients and offers spagyric  and  homeopathic  tinctures
       and remedies.

       Harold Wilson has  developed  an  incredible  biodegradeable solvent
       that will radically dissolve gold!   The  marvel of his invention is
       that it contains no corrosives (!), no toxics (!!)  and  one  of the
       main constituents is water!!! This could be a grea t boon for anyone
       in the gold-mining business.

       Ore containing a variety of elements are  introduced into this fluid
       and it radicfally   dissolves   ONLY   the   gold.  A  second  fluid
       precipitates the gold back out and recovery is at the 99.6% level.

       Bill  van D. has developed nutrients that will feed gold and make it
       multiply. Peter M. grows gold crystals.  Other people are engaged in
       making exotic palliatives and cures,  doing private research, and so
       on.

       Surely this  business with gold sounds, well, far fetched.  But that
       is probably due  to  a  lack  of exposure to and awareness of, these
       recondite disciplines. Yet we read  that  Dr.  Paul  Cottle,  of the
       University of Florida, utilizing a linear accelerator, hurls lithium
       ions at gold and converts it to lead. Shades of wrong-way Corrigan!

       Dr. Cottle, of  course,  was  trying  to prove something  about  the
       functioning of atomic  nuclei.  He also gave weight to the idea that
       transmutation is entirely possible.

       But Bainbridge, Sherr and Starr proved  that  in  the  1940s as have
       recent experimenters in Australia (alchemists) who  have  transmuted
       quicksilver into silver    and    have   created   artificial   gems
       indistinguishable from the 'real thing'.

       And as exemplified by Larry Principe's  research, the governments of
       various countries have shown to be QUITE interested in alchemy.

       A paper studying  the possibility of producing work  from  the  heat
       given off by transmutations conceded that the work of Kushi, Kervran
       and others were correct. That is, transmutations DO take place. This
       paper was written by the U.S. Army!

       Beyond this, there  is  actually  a  tremendous amount of alchemical
       activities taking place.  As  previously   indicated,   hundreds  of
       reasearchers are in the laboratories trying to wrest  the secrets of
       healing and of  life  itself,  from  Nature. Many closely follow the
       teachings of the ancient alchemists, reading texts written long ago.
       They try to decipher the archaic and  code-like  words often written
       in foreign languages.

       To aid them,  my  group,  R.A.M.S.  is  involved in translating  old
       alchemical texts and  transmuting  these  ancient  manuscripts  from
       dusty items taking up space, into a form readable and thus useable.

       It is hoped that some researcher  will  discover  a  new approach or
       even a key to unlock secrets heretofore hidden away. To some extent,
       this has already been the case.

       These are usually  not  large  organized  groups  but   clusters  of
       individuals now turned  on to the possibilities promised by alchemy.
       And, to some  extent  folk  concerned   about  the  environment  and
       pollution seeking better ways.

       Russell Schilling in  Atlanta, Ron DiSalvo in Marina del Rey, Dhyana
       M. in Marietta, Robert M. in Marshfield  WI, Anthony House and Laura
       J. both in Seattle, Mack Ross in Australia and a veritable legion of
       individuals are tuned  into the same philosophy and  trying  to  use
       alchemy to help their brothers and sisters.

       We would be  remiss  not  to  mention  other literary efforts in the
       Hermetic field. These include Publications  such  as  "The  Hermetic
       Journal" published in  England  by  the  tireless Adam  McLean;  the
       eclectic magazine GNOSIS;  Dr.  Hoffman's "Four Worlds Journal", the
       French journals "Tempete  Chymique"  and  "La  Tablet  Emeraude";  a
       newsletter emanating from  Israel "Kabballah"; the Swiss  alchemical
       German language Journal   "Essentia";  the  venerable  "AMBIX"  from
       England; from the U.S. we find "Cauda  Pavona"  and "Hermetica" both
       published in academic  environments  and, of course,  the  venerable
       FATE. Mr. Ritman in Amsterdam has opened to the public an incredible
       library of alchemical    documents.   This   is   the   "Bibliotheca
       Philosophica Hermetica" .

       Tom Brown's "Borderland  Sciences"  group  often  have  articles  on
       Hermetic subjects. The American branch of the Les Philosophs  de  la
       Nature will soon  produce a newsletter to add to a growing number of
       alchemical journals. They are based in Boulder CO.

       We can see then, that there is quite a bit going on, with or without
       our knowledge. There  are  many more  groups  and  invididuals  than
       imagined working quietly, even secretly, doing research,  conducting
       experiments, testing and finally, it is hoped,  coming up with those
       products that are most potent in healing.

       Perhaps, some of  these researchers will be instrumental in bridging
       the wide gap between the alchemist and the scientist.

       It might be asked, and who are these people? Since I travel all over
       the U.S. and beyond, giving lectures,  classes  and  seminars, I can
       answer that question with accuracy.

       The answer is:  the  neighbor  down the street, your  Sunday  school
       teacher, the milkman and a host of others that one would not suspect
       as being involved  in  arcane  studies.  They  are without doubt out
       there.  And they aren't mysterious  or  sinister  folk either.  They
       are sincere, probably very spiritual, people dedicated to the common
       good.

       One day, like Sir Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton, they will "come out
       of the closet".  Hopefully,  at  that  time,  the  fruits  of  their
       discoveries in alchemy,  unlike Boyle and Newton, will be recognized
       and utilized to heal mankind of all  his  illnesses,  both spiritual
       and physical. As the good Lord told us in Genesis, all these things,
       plants, herbs, minerals, etc. are here for our use  and  benefit, to
       nourish and sustain  and heal us. Thus it was He who instituted this
       Holy Art and Science.

       He left for US the challenge and  joy  of  discovering  the  deepest
       secrets of matter. Truly, as Frater Albertus was wont  to  say: "God
       IS good".

                                       finis
