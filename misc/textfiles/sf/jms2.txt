     Showman...if sometime Monday during the day you leave me an EMAIL message
with your address, I can at least send you one of the CD's, though not
autographed.  This may help make up for losing all the others.  No charge.

     The CD is from Sonic Images, and I just finished approving the final
stages of the revised booklet inside (more pictures, including a three shot of
me, Doug and John), and having reviewed the additional suite, which is I think
about 12 minutes long, making the whole CD about 55 or 56 minutes.  It will be
hitting stores sometime in March; the first 2,000 copies right off the press
are already earmarked for the UK, to fill a backlog of orders.

     If you haven't got a copy of the soundtrack, and want one, I very
strongly suggest you go to your record store locally or contact a discount
distributer and pre-order; the limited edition went out in a flash, and while
Sonic Images can do good sized orders, they're not as fast as, say, a Warners
Records.  These things are going to fly out the door, and if they know how
many to advance produce, that'll help minimize any shortages.

were any real number of civilians on board.  And even then only if it were

      To the Brady Bunch Theme

 It's the story
 Of a bunch of filkers
 Who simply couldn't leave B5 alone
 They were cruising
 For a bruising
 Riding the modem tone.

 It's the filking
 That drives you crazy
 With rhymes that cut you clear down to the bone
 Even more scary
 Than Mayor Barry
 It makes you groan and groan

 Till the one day the filkers met a producer
 And they knew that they were clearly out of luck
 Now this group must somehow cross the border
 Or risk assault and mayhem from a truck.

 The Filking Bunch.
 The Filking Bunch.
 Run away from the scary Filking Bunch.

     Unfortunately, I've never been able to dictate scripts.  I need to SEE
the words on the page.  A lot of what I write has a certain rhythm to the
language, and I can only see that on the page.  (People who have gotten used
to my writing can sometimes tell exactly where a jms scene appears in another
script by the rhythms.)  For me it all happens when I fall through the page.

     Normally, for things like this, the studio has rights to the actor's
likeness.  For other aspects of merchandising, like actual figures of the
actor, there is a percentage given.

     Unfortunately, many studios take advantage of the idea that there is no
such thing as a percentage of the net, since there is never (on the books) any
profit.  Case in point: in the 27+ years of Star Trek, the majority of the big
seven actors have gotten about $16,000 from all of the dolls, figurines, chess
sets and zillion other products with their faces.  This out of a billion
dollar franchise.

     The "ban" was only for the satellite viewers; now that the show has begun
to air regionally, anybody can talk about anything.

     (And it was just a request, not a ban; I don't have the power to enforce
one, and wouldn't want to do so in any event.  Common courtesy, and a
request...which was wonderfully accommodated.)

     There are some episodes coming that are about as intense as this, though
not as much *happens*, in the sense of a bunch of events affecting lots of
people in different places.

     Yes, intentional parallel structure to "Midnight," which is why I
included the shot from that episode in Londo's dream.  I like irony.

     On the chance that the datacrystal might fall into the wrong hands, I had
Sinclair deliberately avoid using Garibaldi's last name, and avoid Delenn's
altogether (since she has only the one).  The Ranger was told to deliver the
crystals at the cost of his own life if necessary...but  sometimes such orders
don't end well for the messenger.  So both messages began the same way.

     Re: the Ranger's pin...I kind of designed this, working with Ann Bruice,
our costumer.  I sketched out what I had in mind, which is two figures at
either side of the brooch, one minbari, the other human, joined and made of
the same metal, over a precious stone.

                                                                    jms

     The Rangers actually owe more to the Lone Ranger and the Texas  Rangers
in general.

     FYI, Sinclair called Delenn "old friend" as far back as the 2-hour pilot.

     I will tell you a true and secret thing, re: Londo's dream, and looking
up into a blue sky to see the ships passing overhead.

     Ever since I was a kid, I've had that image in my dreams, of standing out
in the open and looking up as strange dark ships pass overhead.  It's always
been an unnerving image, and I really wanted to use it here to see if it would
have the same effect on others.

     The other single most recurring image is to be standing at the bottom of
a long set of stairs, in a basement, and the door at the top of the stairs is
thrown open, and there's gunfire, and guards, and flares in the night beyond,
and more ships firing down.

     Don't be surprised if this shows up as well, someday....

     Which is basically deliberate.  Now we begin the process of narrowing
down these threads, and collapsing some of them, so that we see that A and B,
originally perceived as two different things, are actually aspects of the same
thing.  Since so much has been thrown out, the next episdoes after this are
kinda focused on only one or two elements at most.  You've been hit with a
lot; now's time to pull back a little and let people breathe and digest what
they've seen.  Then, as stated, you start peeling back the layers and tossing
out the red herrings so you can concentrate on the important aspects.  (And,
really, there's not *that* much, minus that pennultimate scene in Sheridan's
quarters, that isn't an extension of what has gone before...Delenn was told
that she might be dropped from the Grey Council in "Babylon Squared," and the
information about the President has been sort of there in the background ever
since Chrysalis.

     Even so, though, this concern has been anticipated, and built around.

     I doubt we'll be seeing these guys again for a long time, if ever.  So I
don't consider them on the level of certain shadows or stuff.

     Yes, Sheridan was speaking in the Drazi's native language, trying
(without success) to get through; they're a cranky species to start with, and
this didn't help.

      Pledging oneself to someone's side is not common, and carries great
significance.  From that point onward, you are bound to that person until your
death, and you must defend that person at the cost of your own life.

      Given that the Narns were agrarian prior to the arrival of the Centauri,
and were under their heel, and got most of their tech FROM the Centauri
leftovers, no, they're not more advanced.  It's a lot like the Russian
situation, seemingly this tremendous power, but once you look deep, not as
well off as they'd like you to think.

      Claudia loved the scene when I first described it to her, prior to
finishing the script.  She was dying to do it, and kept sort of "doing" it
around people for some time prior to filming.

     The Narn were not out in space prior to the Centauri arriving.

     We hadn't thought much about it (maybe because I'm kinda tall), but
Bruce, Jerry, Claudia, Richard, Andreas...they're all *really* tall, which has
kinda come back to bite us at times on casting, because if we have to have a
baddie, or someone against whom they must go, we have to be sure they operate
at the same height area (usually), or it'll look goofy.

     BTW...I'm pleased to announce that the latest survey from Viewers For
Quality Television (VQT) has chosen Babylon 5 as the #1 ranked syndicated
series, and #16 overall, beating such network/non-network shows as Murphy
Brown, DS9, Seinfeld, Lois and Clark, Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman and The
Simpsons, among others, in their ranking of Highest Quality Shows.

     Thanks to all those who downloaded (and continue to download) the VQT
survey forms, for helping draw people's attention to the hard work being done
on Babylon 5.

     I haven't used my pool in a year and a half because I'm too busy behind
the keyboard to take a dip.  Honest.  And making ice cream isn't something I
can even think of making the time for.  Thank goodness I have a policy of not
getting involved in my own life....

     Believe it or not, I worked with Laura Dern once upon a time, before  she
was LAURA DERN.  When Showtime produced my adaptation of "The Strange Case of
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," through Shelley Duvall's company, she and Anthony
Andrews were cast as the leads.  Even though she was noted even then mainly
for being Bruce Dern's daughter, she was very sweet and talented and you could
see real talent there.

     Loops: get the hell away from my office window.  I can see you out there
with my x-ray specs.

     Y'know...people wonder sometimes why I get a little exasperated with
Paramount from time to time.  Here's a few reasons.

     Back when the Arsenio Show was still on the air, Stephen Furst was set to
appear on the show.  Suddenly, they canceled.  According to Stephen, he was
told on the QT that it was because Paramount heard about it, and didn't want
to promote B5.

     Back at the top of the season, we'd met with Winrich Kolbe about doing
some of our episodes (he does a lot of TNG, DS9 and now Voyager directing).
 Nice guy, we met, we agreed, and a date was set.  All parties agreed to it,
we had a deal.  Not long before the episode comes up, his rep calls to get him
out of it...at first muttering about some vague, ill-defined TV movie
Paramount wanted him to do, but we'd had this for a long time...then his rep
was finally asked, "Look, does this have anything to do with the big boys at
Paramount leaning on you because it's B5?"  The rep reluctantly admitted that
this was the case.  We released Kolbe from his assignment.

     Now, finally, B5 is getting some press, some word of mouth; mostly about
this show called Babylon something.  Well, UPN just announced that they're
doing a new detective series for the UPN stations, the majority of which are
also B5 stations.  And guess what they've announced the title is?  BABYLON.
You think maybe some folks'll get confused about which show this is, given
that they're both on the same station in many places?

     The roster of such things goes on, and on, and on.

     But it's not stopping us.  Inch by inch, we continue to fight our way
into the ratings.

                                                                    jms

     I've read Harlan's piece for the TV guide special Star Trek edition (like
there haven't already been a dozen such recently).  Suffice to say it pole-
axes much of the mythology around "City" and Gene's claims in that regard.
Interesting reading...and some smoking guns.

     Actually, the idea that people coming into the story now will have a hard
time is something of a myth; we continue to add new viewers all the time, and
in some countries the show is actually being shown out of  order; to date I
have seen at most 1 or 2 people who were unsure about one aspect or another
after seeing just one episode, but were still able to follow the story easily
enough.  You may not know what it means in relation to something that happened
6 months ago, but what it means *now* is very clear, and all the information
needed is always included in the episode.

     B5 does not provide squished credits to anyone, and they are not
satellited out in that form.  Local stations do that.  In the cas of Fox
shows, sometimes the Fox network does it in distributing the show to its
affiliates.  But we never provide them that way.
