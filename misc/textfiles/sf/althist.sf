                          THE ALTERNATE HISTORY LIST
                           Version 10 - 27 Apr 1992

This is a list of (nominally) SF stories involving Alternate Histories, aka
What-Ifs, Allohistory and Counterfactuals. Most of the info comes from readers
of the UseNet newsgroup rec.arts.sf.written, but much was extracted from:

Hacker, Barton C., and Gordon B. Chamberlain, "Pasts that Might Have Been, II:
 A Revised Bibliography of Alternative History", in ALTERNATIVE HISTORIES
 (eds. Waugh and Greenberg) {Garland 1986, 0-8240-8659-7}.

Criteria for inclusion are generally the same as described in:

Chamberlain, Gordon B., "Allohistory in Science Fiction", in ALTERNATIVE
 HISTORIES (eds. Waugh and Greenberg) {Garland 1986, 0-8240-8659-7}.

Thus, the alteration affects more than fictional individuals, and the story is
not secret history, does not rely on events entirely futureward of when the
author wrote the story, etc. Submissions of new entries are always appreciated,
as are corrections to old. And don't hesitate to complain if you disagree with
the inclusion/removal of a story. The poster has not read all the entries and
is reliant upon submitters' advice.

Entries have been separated into the following categories:

Anthologies: are books composed mostly/entirely of genre short stories and/or
 essays, each of which is also described separately.
Alternate Histories: include the effect[s] of changing the outcome of an event
 such that the flow of history is noticeably altered. In some, the divergence
 may be the existence of magic.
Future Glimpses: include a character who "sees" how history might unfold
 depending on his actions/decisions.
Crosstime Stories: feature travel/communication between alternate timelines,
 such activity often the major feature of the story.
Changing the Past: involve the changing of the outcome of a past event,
 accidentally or deliberately, but usually through time travel.
Reference Materials: discuss the genre and/or specific books/stories. This
 does not include literary criticism.

In the entries, please note that:

The notation "W:" beginning a description stands for "What if:", and that line
describes the divergence of that AH from ours. An "S:" means "Story:" and that
line describes the plot. A "C:" indicates "Comments:". If none of these is
present, "C:" or "S:" is assumed.

If an author's name is replaced by a group of dashes, the entry is a sequel to
or in the same series as the preceding entry. If replaced by dashes within
arrows, it is part of a series collected within the previous book entry.
Double arrows indicate inclusion in a book collected within an omnibus volume.

If a story in a series seems to fit a different category than the series as a
whole, it is still listed with the series.

If you can't find a particular short story, check other entries by the same
author to see if it has been retitled, revised or expanded.

References to books containing a short story include an author/editor's name
only if different from the author of the story.

Where known, publication info for books is listed in the form {publisher year,
ISBN}. Original copyright date is usually the same as the first publication
date listed. Where a book has been revised or expanded for a later edition,
the abbreviation rev. or exp. appears before the publisher name.

                     ADDENDUM - DATE OF APPARENT DIVERGENCE
                      By Evelyn C. Leeper and R.B. Schmunk

The various entries in the Alternate History List are listed here by date of
apparent divergence from history as we know it. To save space, descriptions are
not included; consult the main list for that info. In some cases the divergence
date is so vague that the story has been omitted from this list. Similarly,
crosstime stories involving multiple possible divergences have generally been
left out. Where the date assignment required some guesswork, the latest
possible date has usually been assigned. Many such entries have a question mark
following the date. Other symbols which may appear after the date are: ")"
indicates a Change the Past story; "}" indicates a Future Glimpse story; and
">" indicates a Crosstime story.  As benchmarks, dates of some notable events
are included. Please e-mail corrections, etc. to schmunk@spacsun.rice.edu.
