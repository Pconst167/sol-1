                                 The Tachyon Field

       In early 1982 an article was published in the magazine "raum & zeit"
       (Space & Time).   This  article talked about the significance of the
       Tachyon Field, both as a practical  explanation of the phenomenon of
       gravity as well as possibly being able to bring about the production
       of unlimited, inexpensive, usable energy.

       At the time  of its publication this article was already  two  years
       old.  Numberous readers  experessed the opinion that the article was
       quite easy to comprehend.  Hence  I  take  the liberty to include it
       here (Dr. Nieper's Revolution in Technology, Medicine  and  Society,
       published in English in May, 1985).

       It attempted to  explain  anew  the  previous  comments from another
       perspective, so that the general  understanding  was  enhanced  by a
       form of "stereo  principle."  The article has been  left  unchanged,
       except for some minor additions.

       "The Leaning Tower  of  Pisa  has  not  disclosed its secret to this
       date: that is,  why  was  the object  dropped  by  Signore  Galilei,
       accelerated towards the ground at 9.81 m/sec?  Today  we call this a
       gravity effect and gravitational acceleration.

       Popularly, it is  known  as "Earth attraction" (Erdanziehung).  This
       popular concept is very confusing  and  apparently has also confused
       some distinguished  scientists.   One thing is certain-gravitational
       acceleration is certainly NOT an 'attraction' phenomenon.

       It is generated  by  a  PUSH  or PRESSURE-based mechanism which will
       have to be analyzed in detail.

       "While human science has made significant  progress in many areas of
       physics, especially atomic  physics,  research  into   gravity   has
       obvously remained one of physics' stepchildren.

       "It would seem  that theoretical physics has, or at least has shown,
       great inadequacies in its intellectual faculties in this context.

       "To date, classical physical theory  assumes that universal space is
       filled with masses  distributed  throughout it, and  that  they,  in
       turn, are composed  of  atoms.  These masses would include the suns,
       planets, moons, asteroids and other  bodies freely traveling through
       space, such as comets and small particles.

       The second reality  recognized  throughout universal  space  is  the
       electromagnetic field, mostly in the form of the visible light

                                      Page 1

       spectrum, as well as X-rays and shorter wavelength variations of the
       electromagnetic field.

       As is known,  light  is  generated  by  the  suns,  and  its overall
       distribution through space is very  weak,  if we disregard locations
       close to the suns.  In the vicinity of the Sun, the  energy  content
       of light can be quite high as everyone knows.  However, this view of
       the universe, which  is  still  held, to a large extent, by orthodox
       physics, is, upon closer inspection, no longer sufficient to explain
       the extraordinarily important  phenomenon  of  the  acceleration  of
       gravity.  The British   physicist,   Dr.   Rendle,    has   compiled
       approximately 60 different  statements  by  distinguished physicists
       starting with Newton in the 17th Century, up to today.

       In practically all instances, it is  apparent that we have foundered
       in our attempts at explaining gravitational acceleration.   The most
       interesting and to  this  day  the  most  modern, statements on this
       topic still come from Newton, at  the  end  of the 17th Century!  He
       said that the mutual interaction between bodies is  to  be admitted,
       and that their explanation would be possible only in the future.  He
       also stated that he was certain that the capability for a body to be
       accelerated by gravity  was  not  a property of the body itself.  It
       was based on a physically yet-to-be-discovered  RELATION BETWEEN THE
       BODIES.

       As is known,  the classical laws of gravitational acceleration  came
       from Newton (gravitational acceleration is proportional to the mass,
       and inversely proportional  to the square of the distance.) However,
       Newton provided no  description or  explanation  as  to  why  bodies
       accelerate towards each  other,  or  why  there  are   gravitational
       effects.

       The same is  true  of Einstein.  In his general theory of relativity
       of 1916, he describes gravitational  effects  in terms of the theory
       of relativity.  In  his  subsequent  biography, 'Aus  meinen  spaten
       Jahren' (Out of  my  Later  Years),  he  expresses  doubts as to his
       capacity to ultimately explain gravitational  effects.  On March 28,
       1949, on the occasion of his 70th birthday, Einstein  wrote  to  his
       friend Solovine '...there  is  not  a  single  concept of which I am
       certain it will stand the test of time.  And I am not certain that I
       am even on the right track..'

       "These remarks are important because there are many physicists, more
       or less imprisoned by conventional  theory,  who  quote  Einstein to
       counter the upcoming   modern   concepts   regarding   gravitational
       effects.

       "Interaction of large  forces between masses in space is conceivable
       only through:

          a)  the action of a very energy-rich field in space, and

          b)  the explanation of gravitational  acceleration  as  a push or
              thrust phenomena,  because only pressure or  push  phenomenon
              can be  exerted  in  space by electromagnetic fields or other
              conceivable forms of energy.

       "An 'attraction' such  as  'gravitational   attraction'   or  'Earth
       attraction' DOES NOT EXIST.  In turn, the generation of a pushing

                                      Page 2

       effect is conceivable  only  if the pushing pressure between the two
       bodies to be accelerated towards  each  other  is  smaller than that
       acting outside the two.

       This again is  conceivable  only  if  the body 'shields'  the  field
       intensity impinging on  it  in  each  case,  so  that  bodies moving
       towards each other are accelerated into the shielding shadow.

       The beginnings of this concept date  back  to  the arly part of this
       century.  During the 20's and the 30's, physicists such as Levetzow,
       Stanyukowiz, and Shneiderov  dealt with this concept.   The  general
       conception was that  universal  space  was  filled  with energy-rich
       charges, designated as gravitons,  for  instance, which impinge on a
       body.  They are  partially  absorbed  in  the  body,  and  then  are
       reflected at a decreased rate.

       This energy gradient would explain the gravitational acceleration at
       the surface of  such bodies.  Another scientist, Nieper, developed a
       different concept back in 1953, namely that of the total penetration
       of the body, although this required  very  energy-rich gravitational
       fields or 'gravity gravitons.'  Certain data gathered by NASA during
       circumlunar navigation by  satellites  in  1967-71  favored  such  a
       theory.

       In 1970, the  American  physicist Stokes, called Nieper's theory the
       'shielding theory.'  In 1972, the  well-known  physicist Stuhlinger,
       working at the  time with Wernher von Braun in Huntsville,  Alabama,
       expressed the idea  that  the shielding theory could be explained by
       the effects of a Tachyon Field, whose  properties had been described
       in 1966 by physicist Feinberg.

       "In the following  period,  Nieper  was  able  to  explain   several
       important observations related  to  gravitational phenomena in terms
       of the shielding theory.  This includes  for example, the conditions
       on Earth at  the  time  of  the  dinosaurs.   The  habits  of  these
       behemoths could be  explained only if the acceleration of gravity on
       Earth was approximately 0.3 g (300 g for 1 liter of water) and not 1
       g, as it is today.

       If the DENSITY of the irradiating  Feinberg  field were to INCREASE,
       the gravitational acceleration  of  a  body  such   as  Earth  would
       DECREASE.

       A deviation in  the  mass  of  the  planet Jupiter and its moons (of
       approximately 25%, according to Nieper  and  in  the range of 24% to
       41% according to NASA data) can be explained in the same manner.

       The renowned Dutch  physicist  Kooy  has independently  developed  a
       gravitational theory identical  to  the  above,  except  that he, in
       contrast to Nieper, also provided a mathematical framework.

       Kooy also assumes that bodies in universal space are penetrated by a
       very energy-rich graviton or Tachyon  Field  (Feinberg  field), FROM
       ALL DIRECTIONS IN SPACE and TOWARDS ALL DIRECTIONS  IN  SPACE.  This
       property is called  ISOTROPY.  Thus, the conduction of gravitational
       fields is somehow  of  infinite velocity.   Kooy  has  written  some
       important papers on this.

       "In Nieper's opinion, one of the most important phenomena in gravity

                                      Page 3

       research is the  so-called  Magyary phenomenon.  It was found by the
       Hungarian engineer Magyary in 1961,  during  measurements of a solar
       eclipse.

       The measurements were performed in Budapest using  a  radio  antenna
       atop a transmission  tower,  and simultaneously controlled elsewhere
       by a government  authority.  In contrast  to  expectations,  it  was
       discovered that, at the peak of the eclipse, 'the Sun  deprived  the
       Moon of part of its mass effect on the Earth.'

       This means that,  during  this  eclipse, the gravitational effect of
       the Moon on  Earth was smaller.  This  phenomenon  is  fundamentally
       opposed to the  laws  of  Newton  and Einstein, as  are  some  other
       measurements, for example,  the  tests  performed  by  the  American
       physicist Saxl with a torsion pendulum.

       "Modern gravitation scientists believe  that  any gravitation theory
       unable to explain  the  Magyary phenomenon is either  deficient,  or
       wrong.  Nieper's explanation  of  the Magyary phenomenon is that the
       Feinberg field density increases in the direction of the sun.

       Hence the moon, in a corresponding  position,  may  be more strongly
       irradiated, and absorbs  (shields) a smaller percentage  of  energy.
       Therefore its gravitational effect becomes smaller.

       And incidentally, there are reliable indications that heating in the
       interior of the  planets-in the case of Earth, we call it geothermal
       heat-is generated by  the  conversion   of   braking   gravitational
       radiation.  In that   sense  geothermal  energy  will   be   trapped
       gravitational energy that is constantly renewed from the outside.

       The presumed phenomenon  of  density  increase of the Feinberg field
       towards the Sun is explained by  stating  that  the  Feinberg  field
       irradiating from the outside is completely absorbed  in the Sun-thus
       also releasing considerable  energy-and that simulataneously the Sun
       generates a new kind of Feinberg or Tachyon Field.

       (   Newer studies have shown that  approximately  only  one-third of
           the Sun's light energy can originate in fusion  processes, while
           the larger portion of the light energy must come from a field of
           energy of a different kind.                                    )

       Upon emission from the Sun, this field is very dense, and is, on the
       average, slower than the field irradiating the Sun from the outside.
       In fact, the  peak  velocity of the tachyons on the way from the Sun
       to the Earth seems to exceed that of light only slightly.

       Nieper calls this  Feinberg  field   radiated   by   the   Sun,  and
       particularly dense around it, the 'perisolar cushion field.'

       Several important phenomena  can  be  explained  by   this   theory,
       especially the heating  of  the  planet  Venus.   As  is known, this
       heating was explained by the so-called greenhouse effect of the very
       dense Venusian atmosphere.  Based  on the experimental data released
       by NASA, Nieper  has  contested  this  from the very  beginning,  in
       contrast to many  NASA  scientists.   Nieper  was later proven to be
       possibly correct ('Science', 18 January 1980, pp. 289-293).

       (   The important complex of data, transmitted until mid-1984 by the

                                      Page 4

           two Russian  space  modules  in  Venusian  orbit, supports, to a
           great extent,  the  hothouse   concept  of  Venus,  and  largely
           disproves the greenhouse concept (see science report  on  Venera
           15 and  16 spacecraft orbiting Venus in "Venusian Geology Coming
           into Focus", by Richard A. Kerr,  in "Science", 18 May 1984, pp.
           702-703                                                        )

       The collapse of the greenhouse theory as an explanation  of the high
       Venus temperature is  considered  a  decisive  'nail  test'  for the
       possible correctness of the shielding  theory.   The concepts of the
       perisolar cushion theory also explain why probably  NO GRAVITATIONAL
       EFFECTS OCCUR ON  THE  SUN'S  SURFACE,  as  seems  probable from the
       dynamics of eruption  from the solar  surface.   It  has  also  been
       observed that slowly-cooling double stars DRAW NEARER to each other,
       which also corroborates the cushion theory.

       (   Meanwhile it became obvious as a result of American  and Russian
           experiments, that  the  Sun  must  be  a  gaseous  ball  with  a
           homogeneous density.  This is  only  explicable when there is NO
           gravity acceleration on the surface of the Sun-surely not such a
           high acceleration as would correspond to the immense mass of the
           Sun.  It  seems  that  the  diameter  of the Sun  is  constantly
           changing and  that  it may not be perfectly spherical.  This has
           an influence on the orbit of  the  planet  Mercury.   In the USA
           this subject  sparks  heated  discussion  because  this  finding
           stands in direct opposition to the tenants of Einstein's theory.
           Only at  some  distance  from  the  surface  of  the  Sun is the
           acceleration due  to  gravity   measurable,  and  it  then  also
           produces a deflection of light, as measured by  Eddington.  This
           increase in the acceleration of gravity WITH INCREASING DISTANCE
           from the  Sun  is  explained  by  the  dilution  of the radiated
           Tachyon Field in relation to  the  incidental  field.   Only the
           shielding theory  of gravity is in a position  to  explain  this
           phenomenon.                                                    )

       The strong heating  of  Venus  can be explained in terms of a higher
       energy interception due to a higher  density  of the Feinberg field,
       and in terms of a consequence of the limited velocity  with which it
       leaves the Sun.   On  the average, that velocity may be equal to the
       velocity of light.

       On the other hand, however, it has  been  believed, since Feinberg's
       publication of 1966, that gravitons or tachyons, as they are called,
       can be much  faster  than  light.   The  German  physicist  Koppitz,
       formerly active at  the  Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich,
       performed a very interesting calculation in this regard.

       Koppitz states that the light velocity  corresponds  exactly  to the
       geometrical mean of   the  plotted  tachyon  velocities,   i.e.   it
       represents the maximium  velocity of half the tachyons (this is also
       called V50).

       (   Moreover, the French space physicist  Vallee first mentioned the
           decrease in the velocity of light IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
           at the October, 1981, Congress in Toronto, to which this book is
           also dedicated.  Nor could this be any different,  since the V50
           of the Tachyon Field MUST DECREASE in the direction of the Sun.)

       "In principle, and independently, the Dutch physicists Kooy and

                                      Page 5

       Berghuis agree with   this   reasoning.   NASA  has  again  released
       experimental data that   presuppose    the   application   of   this
       understanding of the tachyon velocity.

       During the study of the planet Uranus, which is very  difficult  and
       can be done  only  indirectly, observations were made indicating the
       probable existence of equatorial  rings,  similar  to  those we know
       also float around  Saturn.   The  published  data   point   to   the
       conclusion, albeit only tentatively at this time, that we can expect
       a considerable mass deviation.

       Its ballistically calculated   average  density  is  1.3,  while  in
       reality, compared to Earth conditions,  it could be approximately 5.
       This deviation is most readily explained by assuming  that  tachyons
       are much faster,  in  the range of Uranus' orbit, than near Earth or
       Venus and therefore have a much higher  'penetration  power.'   This
       would reduce the  acceleration  of  gravity on Uranus,  which  could
       explain its mass of deviation.

       This would also  mean,  if  we  apply  the  Koppitz  model, that the
       velocity of light is faster near Uranus than near Earth.  To measure
       this would, of  course, be difficult,  since  the  measurement  time
       would become as relativistic as the light velocity  itself.  If, for
       instance, it were  twice  as  high  as  near  Earth, then time could
       conceivably pass twice as fast, so  that a measurement would show no
       deviation.

       Jupiter's mass deviation, as assumed by Nieper based  on elements of
       the shielding theory, could possibly also be explained in terms of a
       higher Tachyon Field velocity in the range of Jupiter's orbit.  Data
       currently known for  the outer Jupiter moons Ganymede and Callistro,
       which are said to have an average density of approximately 1.9 based
       on ballistic calculations, lead us  to  expect  a  mass deviation of
       41%.

       "Professor Seike urgently recommended placing instruments  on either
       Jupiter's or Saturn's moons, to measure the velocity of light there.
       In analogy to  Nieper,  he  expects  CONSIDERABLE DEVIATIONS (in the
       speed of light).

       "The range in which the Feinberg  field  radiated  by  the  Sun (the
       perisolar cushion field) mixes with the very high-velocity  Feinberg
       field irradiating the  Sun  from  the outside, is called the MERGING
       ZONE.  It is assumed that the Earth  orbit  is preferentially within
       this merging zone.

       "With an average  density  of  3.3,  Earth's  moon  probably  has  a
       composition similar to  that  of  the outer Jupiter moons.  Koppitz,
       Reed and some  other  physicists have  speculated  on  the  possible
       nature of the tachyons which isotropically penetrate  all  masses in
       space from all directions and in all directions.

       Unanimously they assume  a  PULSATING  UNIT  that  hides  its energy
       content in its pulsating power.  This  model thus deviates from that
       of the electromagnetic wave.  TACHYONS INTERACT WITH MATTER, and not
       in the manner indicated in quantum physics.  They can  release their
       energy gradually, WITHOUT  STEPS  (a  so-called  elastic  relation).
       This characteristic is unanimously  accepted  by  Kooy,  Nieper, the
       Americans Mead and Reed, and some other physicists.

                                      Page 6

       "The energy content  of  the Feinberg field is extraordinarily high.
       The famous physicist de Broglie already assumed an energy content in
       space of 10 to the 26th power Joules/liter.

       In Nieper's view, the Feinberg travelling field near Earth is strong
       enough that, due to its penetration of Earth, it loses only 4% to 6%
       of its energy content,  and this is  converted into geothermal heat.
       This could be  an  underestimation.   For  the  layman,   there  are
       extraordinarily high energy concentrations.

       "It must be  mentioned  in  this  context that probably only a small
       portion of the tachyons travel fast enough to be considered relevant
       to the generation of gravitational phenomena.

       Today we know with certainty that  the  predominant  portion  of the
       high energy Tachyon  Field 'remains in place.'  In  this  particular
       case, we therefore also mention bradyons.

       "The Japanese scientist,  Seike,  mentions  a tension of 880 MILLION
       VOLTS PER CENTIMETER for the Feinberg field!

       It is assumed that the traveling  Tachyon  Fields  are hardly slowed
       down by masses,   and   yet   have   a  moment  (the   gravitational
       acceleration) and/or generate heat (geothermal heat).  They are also
       braked by strong magnetic and electric fields.

       For instance, the  inner  moon  IO,  of  Jupiter's  moon  system, is
       subjected to very strong magnetic induction.  This moon is obviously
       very hot in its interior and has strong  volcanic activity.  This is
       in spite of the fact that its size is only that of Earth's moon.

       Nieper explains this  heating effect as a consequence  of  the  high
       braking effect, of  the  strong  magnetic  induction  generated from
       Jupiter into the mass of IO, on the  Feinberg  field.   It  has been
       accepted that all other attempted explanations by physicists  of the
       heating of IO are inadequate.

       "The American physicist,  Townsend Brown, at the University of North
       Carolina was the  first to prove,  in  systematic  experiments,  the
       emission of a THRUST MOMENT due to gravitational field radiation, in
       the direction of the POSITIVE charge of a condenser.   Based on this
       principle, he built  machines  capable  of  flying.  Perhaps one can
       rightfully say that these are the  first  flying  saucers  built  on
       Earth.

       It was also observed that abrupt condenser discharges  with  a  very
       high voltage gradient, especially in a defined, rhythmic manner, are
       equally suited to removing energy or moment from the Feinberg field.

       Thus, this COULD  BE  AN  INDICATION  of  the beginning of TECHNICAL
       EXPLOITATION of energy from the Feinberg  field,  an energy that may
       be FREE and UNLIMITED.

       "A substantial theoretical  foundation  for  this  technology  again
       comes from Nieper,  and  is  contained  in the shielding theory.  He
       postulates that all so-called natural accelerations are subjected to
       the same basic principle: that all are 'tachyon interceptive.'

       In other words, the acceleration of gravity, electromagnetic and

                                      Page 7

       electrostatic acceleration, and     the    so-called    radiesthetic
       acceleration ( of  the  divining  rod ), are  a  common, fundamental
       phenomenon.

       Accordingly, the electric   motor   does   not   work   because   an
       electromagnetic field is  built  up  in  it.   It  works because the
       electromagnetic field exerts an INTERCEPTIVE  ACTION on the Feinberg
       field RADIATING THROUGH IT.

       "The electromagnetic field produced as such would  have  no  effect.
       This theoretical concept  states that possibly the various different
       methods of exerting   an  interceptive   effect   on   gravitational
       radiation are interchangeable  and,  above  all, that  they  can  be
       optimized, possibly well beyond an efficiency of 100%.

       In fact, existing   experimental  data  confirm  this  concept.   An
       electric motor built eight years ago  by  the American, Gray, to the
       coil system of  which  is  connected a rhythmic condenser  discharge
       (not an electric   field),   apparently   already  has  exceeded  an
       efficiency of 100%.   That  is, it  produces  more  energy  than  it
       requires for its operation.

       Naturally this is no 'perpetual mobile', since the  'excess'  energy
       comes from the   GRAVITATIONAL   STRESSING  FIELD.   The  systematic
       experimental series presented   by   the   Japanese  Seike  and  his
       collaborator Cho are absolutely fascinating.

       Seike does not,  in  accordance with conventional customs,  send  an
       electric field THROUGH the coils surrounding an iron core,  so as to
       generate a magnetic  effect.   Rather he 'TRAPS' the ELECTRIC FIELD,
       which is possible  by  means  of   a  special  winding,  called  the
       'Kleinean Bottle.'

       Thus he generated an extraordinarily energy-rich tachyon  beam, from
       minimal input power,  by means of which he can cut metals and stone,
       with the exception of mica.  (Why  is  Mica  not  affected  by  this
       Tachyon Beam?) This tachyon beam is called the 'Seike Beam' today.

       Incidentally , the  human  eye may also be able to  produce  such  a
       Seike phenomenon-if we may call it that.  This would explain why Uri
       Geller is capable of bending silver spoons with only a glance.

       "The stone melting  processes  in the Seike-ray, as well as those of
       the spoon handle   under   Uri   Geller's    eyes,   were   observed
       INDEPENDENTLY OF A TEMPERATURE INCREASE.

       Instead, the concentration  of  the  tachyon  concentration  led  to
       SPATIAL CHANGES OF  THE  ATOM, which caused corresponding changes in
       the material's strengths.

       "The German engineer  Schaffranke,   the   youngest  of  the  German
       technicians who worked with Wernher von Braun, has  the  great merit
       of having collected and identified numerous experiments in the field
       of gravitational energy  conversion  which could not be explained IN
       THEIR TIME.

       Schaffranke, as well as Nieper, calls  the  principle  of converting
       gravitational field energy  (or gravity stressing energy)  'Feinberg
       conversion', which technically, of course, is not properly defined.

                                      Page 8

       However, for the   sake   of   simplicity,  and  in  recognition  of
       Feinberg's achievement, the term apparently will find popular use.

       According to Schaffranke, it was experimentally possible, already in
       1880,
                         AS SHOWN BY THE PHYSICIST KEELY,

       to convert Feinberg energy into electrical current.

       "Another experimenter, Hendershot,  was  similarly  successful.  And
       very impressive indeed  are  Dr. Moray's experiments  in  Salt  Lake
       City, over several  decades,  from  1920 to 1960.  A thick insulated
       cable, the so-called antenna which  was displayed in the garden, was
       connected to the   convertor   and   extracted  continuous   useable
       electrical energy of  up to 70 KW.  The validity of the attempts was
       verified by competent neutral investigators.

       However, at the time, considering  the  prevailing physical views of
       the universe, they were entirely unexplainable.  "Today  there is no
       doubt that the  so-called  Feinberg  conversion  is  feasible,  that
       unlimited, inexpensive energy can  be  produced  and  that  Feinberg
       conversions usher in  an  entirely  new  area  of   technology   and
       civilization.

       "The discovery that  energy  can  be obtained from the gravitational
       field does not arrive a minute too  early.  If humanity-which, based
       on current energy  technology  is approaching certain  disaster-once
       more escapes, then  it  can thank the scientists mentioned above for
       the escape.

       "It is entirely mistaken to believe  that environmental problems can
       be solved by saving energy.  To the contrary, restoration  of  order
       to our already  heavily damaged environment will require an enormous
       amount of additional energy, and  an  energy  that  does  not entail
       pollution.

       "It is also erroneous to believe humanity could live  in  peace with
       an energy shortage  or  with  expensive energy.  It is not the price
       and the shortage of energy which  would  alone  determine  mankind's
       destiny.

       It is the CONVERGENCE of social problems, population  explosion, and
       energy shortage shortage ACTING TOGETHER."

       Raum and Zeit is published in Germany and also in the United States.
       The following is a letter announcing the publication of the magazine
       in an English edition.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Dear Reader,

           raum &  zeit has long been recognized as one of Europe's leading
       scientific journals, one   which    is   not   afraid   to   publish
       controversial material.  It  is  a  journal  recognized   and   much
       referred to by  Academies  of Sciences.  One of the major objectives
       of this English version of raum &  zeit  is  to  bring to the U.S.A.
       many European publications  on research in a variety  of  scientific
       disciplines.
                                      Page 9

           The language   barrier   that  exists  between  the  U.S.A.  and
       continental Europe has always been and still is a major handicap for
       those who do not speak the languages  of  the  Old  World.  This has
       already resulted in major disadvantages for scientific  progress  in
       the U.S.A.  raum  &  zeit  will  attempt to do something about this.
       This journal will be written in such  a  way that those not familiar
       with any of  the  sciences  can  understand  what   is  being  said.
       Knowledge must be available to everybody.

           raum &   zeit   will   publish  articles  in  a  wide  realm  of
       disciplines, including allopathic    medicine,   natural   medicine,
       physics, chemistry, acupuncture, engineering, politics  (related  to
       the sciences) and  invites  everybody  who  has questions to ask, or
       articles to publish,  to write to  the  Managing  Editor.   As  said
       before, we are a very open minded journal, not afraid  to  question,
       because only continuous questioning of everything and everybody will
       lead to absolute  truth.   It  is also essential that every issue is
       looked at from as many sides as possible.   We are convinced that by
       rejoining the many  separated  specialized  sciences   the  complete
       picture can be regained.

           raum &  zeit will appear every 2 months and will be available at
       the newsstand for $12.50 per issue.   Subscriptions  are invited and
       will cost $59.00 per year.
