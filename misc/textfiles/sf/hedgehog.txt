                       -----------------------

        Reconstructed by Matthew Crosby and alt.fan.pratchett

             from the Discworld novels by Terry Pratchett

                                -----


            Bestiality sure is a fun thing to do
            But I have to say this as a warning to you:
            With almost all animals, you can have ball
            But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.
  
    CHORUS 1:   The spines on his back are too sharp for a man
                They'll give you a pain in the worst place they can
                The result I think you'll find will appall:
                The hedgehog can never be buggered at all!

            Mounting a horse can often be fun
            An elephant too; though he weighs half a ton
            Even a mouse (though his hole is quite small)
            But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

    CHORUS 2:   The spines on his back are so awful thick
                you'll end up with naught but a painful prick.
                He has an impregnable hole when curled up in a ball,
                Hence the hedgehog can never be buggered at all!

            Screwing a cow while she goes moo-moo
            Will be entertaining to both her and you
            Or you might try a tiger, if you have enough gall
            But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

                CHORUS 1

            A fish is refreshing, although a bit wet
            And a cat or a dog can be more than a pet
            Even a giraffe (despite being so tall)
            But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

                CHORUS 2

            You can manage a snake, though its poison might kill
            It's amazing how humping a camel will thrill
            You can go with a snail if you slow to a crawl
            But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

                CHORUS 1

            You can ravish a sloth but it would take all night
            With a shark it is faster, but the darned beast might bite
            We already mentioned the horse, you may recall
            But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

                CHORUS 2

            You can roger a skunk if you can stand the smell
            Or even an oyster, should he let go of his shell
            A troll can be rocky if down you should fall  
            But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

                CHORUS 1

            For slippery fun, you can cornhole an otter
            Or pego a pig after parting his trotters
            Or tumble a tapir, though the prospect appall
            But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

                CHORUS 2

            For prosimian fun, you can bugger a lemur
            To bolster your name as a pervert and schemer
            The lemurs cry "Frink!" as a coy mating call
            But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

                CHORUS 1

            Antipodean pranks -- you can futter a wombat
            Or strive with a 'roo in venereal combat
            Or hump a goanna -- go on, do it all
            But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

                CHORUS 2

            A moose is amusing, a squid quite confusing
            Or try on a rhino if you fancy a bruising,
            Or mountin' a mountain goat (careful, don't fall!)
            But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.
    
                CHORUS 1        

            You could thrust with a thrush if you fancy a climb,
            Or pork a few piglets if you have the time,
            A skinhead's pet cat if you don't mind a brawl,
            But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.

    original version was thought up by Matthew Crosby, and has since
    then been streamlined and expanded by readers of the newsgroup.

    Note from Matthew: "BTW, I know the giraffe verse in the book is
    `if you stand on a stool', but this doesn't really rhyme. I've
    tried to insert all the other scraps Pterry has given us... if I
    missed any, let me know."
