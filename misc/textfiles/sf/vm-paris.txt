			Has more good Volaries or Poets made,
			From thy dark Caves were Inspirations given,
			     And from thick groves went vows to Heaven
			Hail then thou Muse's and Devotions Spring,
			'Tis just we should adore,'tis just we should thee sing

		I have set the Vampire Club from "World of Darkness" in Paris.
	It has the same owner, and some background. It is floating on the 
	Seine. Every new kindred to the city will have free membership, and 
	will have to do a short performance on the stage. She/he will have a 
	week to prepare her/his show. At the end, Sire Francois Villon will 
	welcome the new kindred to stay as long as she/he wants, for the 
	proof that one is an artiste has been given. If what they have done 
	is crap, he will invite the new comer to leave his city. If it is 
	THE PITS, he will order a Blood Hunt on the "chien qui a osser me 
	presenter une tell chose!" ("On the dog who presented such a thing!".)
	This is very rare, as every kindred is told that they better do 
	something good. On the other hand, if he is impressed by the show 
	(such as very good french poetry, etc..) he will be most pleased to 
	help the new comers in the future! 
		This must be played in live action (rolls to play instrument..
	botch is always possible, no others!). Let them know that they are in
	the "citee des arts". Costumes, and advice are avaiable from 
	Sebastien, but he will never set up something. Villon will never 
	speak another language but he understands several others, and won't 
	mind if the new comer performs in another language.
		This performance can be anything, like a play, a demonstration
	of one's abilities, a song, a lecture on a subject (art is good, but it 
	can be on anything else, as long as its not borring!). Eg: A Tremere
	could do some "magical tricks"; a Malkavian could mimic the Tremere....

	NOTE:
	~~~~~
		I am using different rules for Diablerie: 

	*First you advance in generation acording to (your generation/vessel 
	generation) rounded to a lower value. If the vessel is of the same clan 
	as you; then you gain +1 in any CLAN disciplines the vessel had, if 
	they are above your own level. If from another clan, you can develop
	the vessels MAIN dicipline, without having to learn it. (same price as
	a non-clane dicipline, but no need for a teacher.).

	*That's the good things, now the bads:
	Roll your conscience against your humanity:
		1 or more successes---lose one humanity and a conscience
		No successes----------lose 2 humanity and a conscience
		Botch-----------------as above, and the character gains a 
				     derangment and he/she frenzies...
	Now, some part of the vessel will pass onto you (his/her soul
	is beeing mixed with yours), so you will start to develop a
	trait of character which will be close to the nature of the vessel.
	The greater the jump, the greater the reincarnation.
	Eg1= Nathaniel diablerises a Ravnos of 8th generation, he ends up
	a a 8th (he was 9th), and only gets mild kleptonania.
	Eg2= Nathaniel diableries Villon, he ends up as a 6th generation,
	with a mix of Villon's soul and his own..he died as Nathaniel, and 
	Villon died as well, but now there is a being with a bit of both!
	Eventualy, Villon will take over the new body and be re-born as a 
	6th generation Ventrue.....
	*All disadvantages from Diablerie Mexico are still present!

			It makes diablerie more powerful, but it has a very
	funny "bad" side...DO NOT TELL THE PLAYERS YOU ARE USING THAT RULE, IF
	THEY WANT TO BE DIABLERISTES, THEY MUST PAY THE PRICE (and discover it
	at the same time!!!). In Paris, a diablerist will gain a very bad 
	reputation due to the Lady, who will "hate" him/her and will try to 
	make his/her life very misserable! The only diablerie permitted is 
	after a Blood Hunt, if the Prince is realy impresed by the courage
	of the players, and he is very VERY angry at the hunted! Even so, he
	will try to make the character do a wrong move and kill him/her as 
	soon as possible; or at least to make his/her life very misserable!!!

	1_ T H E  B R U J A H :
			Since the last 200 years, the clan has been known to 
	be active in Paris. There greatest achievment was the French Revolution,
	in 1789, they manage to take control of France, and only an alliance 
	of the other clans succeeded in destroying their "Republique". They have
	then waited till the 18 of March 1871: the Paris Commune! 100 days of
	anarchy across the streets of Paris. It was eneded by the army, lead 
	by a ghoul of the Ventrue. Then the prince, after seeing that the 
	Brujah destroyed his library at the Lovre, ordered a Blood Hunt on 
	" Tous les membre de ce clan depravee et inutile!!!"(all the members 
	of this useless and deviant clan). The biggest Blood Hunt ever called
	among vampires: All Brujahs were hunted down and killed by all the 
	other clans. There was no pity. None survived, and Paris was free of 
	their influance till the 20 century. the Elders of the clan took their 
	revenge in 1917: The Russian Revolution was set and succeeded. All the 
	other clans were told not to interfere. In may 1968, there was a 
	burst of Brujah and the country was taken by surprise! The prince 
	agreed to let the clan come back into Paris, and the clan ended the 
	"mai 68" revolution.
			There are no leaders of the Brujah in Paris, only a 
	inn, where they meet and plan what to do. They are all of 10th
	generation or above since no older Brujah will go to Paris...They 
	still remember the Commune!!! The pub is called: La Taverne de Nesle, 
	rue dauphine.
			There are lots of gangs in Paris (skinheads, punks, 
	etc...), feel free to do your own Brujah, but they will be "young" 
	(100 years old). The players could become leaders of the clan, or can 
	start as one of the leaders (they are 5 called: Philippe, Bruno, 
	Vanesa, Delphine, and Vincent. They are all 8th generation).

			They were the most powerful in the past, able to cross
	the kingdoms, as they wish. Now there are only dreams of that time, 
	and plans for the future!
			Paris has a very small population of Gangrels, in 
	fact they do not live in the city, but in the woods near it. All 
	parks in Paris are theirs, but only few live there. They hate the 
	Toreadors even more here, since it is them who have develpped Paris 
	so much. Their leader is a women, who died around the 14 century, not
	a lot is known about her but that she is the Lady of Arbanville! 
	She came to Paris 50 years ago, and became the leader of a brood who 
	lived there. She seized control of the Boy Scout movement and it is 
	said that Lord Baden Powell was one of her freind. (she didn't make
	him a vampire, because she loved him to much to inflict the curse on 
	him. And at that time she was already in Golconda.). She made an 
	aliance with the Nosferatu (with Jean) and the Malkavian (with 
	Benoit) clan to move against Abelard, the Tremere leader of Paris. 
	The Lady and he have been enemies since the first time they saw each 
	other. She doesn't know what he is doing in Paris but wants to prevent
	him from doing anything. She knows that he practised diablerie to 
	gain power, and that he will be ready to use it again, if he finds 
	an elder! But she has no proof of it.

	BACKGROUND: I was invited to quit the Camarilla and join the Inconnu
	sortly after my achieving of the Blessed State of Golconda, but my 
	Children need me to show them that there is a way to be free from the 
	frenzy, and live accepting the Beast as a part of yourself. I will never
	force them, if they don't want to join me it is all right, but I'll try
	to convince them all. My powers are great (since the Beast helps me now)
	but I will not use them, there are too many who will be jealous and 
	might want to comit diablerie on me! But I will always answer them and 
	advice them on how to reach this The Blessed State.
		My frienship with the Garou, or Lupines as we calll them, 
	is long. I helped them against the evil force of a demon in the past
	(what they called a Bane). Now they consider me as one of their freinds
	and they are, in some sort, very close to me childrens.
		Of all clans, the Tremere are the one I fear the most! They are
	on the wrong way and they might unlease powers far above their 
	power to control. Anyway, Tremere will pay for his Crime.
	IMAGE: long blond hair, with eyes as deep as the sea, the Lady is one
	of the most beautifull women of the world. She always wear a white 
	dress and is always charming to mortals and kindred alike.
	ROLE PLAYING: You will aid anyone on their way to Golconda, if they 
	ask you. You will try to help any vampire who comes to you with 
	goodness in her. Always smile, and try to make the others around you 
	happy. If there is a Tremere in the room, you will not speak to him, 
	nor help him. The Toreadors are blind to the beauty of the world and 
	try to create their own, it is the wrong way: but they can learn, and 
	you can teach them. Consider that in every Kindred, there is at least 
	5% of good!!!...

		       They are controlled by 3 vampires: Jean, Eric, and 
	Laurent. They sleep in the catacombs and control all the other 
	"dwellers under the sky" (the sky is in fact the stones above their 
	head.). All the Cataphiles (cata: catacombes, philes:love. It is the 
	name of the people who come to this place, and respect it.
	On the other hand "Tourists", are people who go there and trash the 
	place.) are they herd, and some of them are retainers. They are
	regrouped in groups like: the deepcats, The psi-div (servants of the 
	3 elders). Or they just have a underground name:Gandalf,Gizmo,La Taupe
	Legolas(they are the psi-div) others are cataclisme, cataract, caton,
	etc... Nobody knows how many there are, but they have all 2 things in
 	common: they love the Catacombs, and are ready to defend it! (Once, 
	there was a skinhead group, who went down. Sometimes later, all the 
	Cataphiles knew it. (they leave handouts in special places, and the 
	others can read them.) They all met in one place, and made a "bust" 
	into the skinheads, who NEVER returned.).
			There are around 300 kmsq of tunnels under Paris, and
	they where made as a maze. Each tunnel has a name, like on the ground.
	But they are different, so there is no hope of getting out. The 
	Cataphiles made maps of the place, but give them only to their 
	trusted allies. The IGC (inspection generale des carriers, inspector 
	of catacombs) patrols the Catas to get every body out(see after); 
	they can give fines up to 5000 Fr, and if you are in possession of 
	bones, then it goes to court, and you might have a prison sentence. 
	Entrances are in fact pits with ladders on their side, at the bottom 
	there is a corridor. This are about 1.60 m height, the temperature is
	fixed all year and around 20 C. There are some rooms, which various 
	sizes: Z, Zlard, L'abris Laval, La plage.... This is where most of 
	the cataphiles can be found (generaly partying, and listening to music
	like Dead Can Dance, And Also The Tree, or more "cold wave" stuff). 
			The Nosferatu fight against the Ventrue of Paris over
	the cata, since the mayor of Paris (Jack Chirac is blood bonded to 
	Labianus) wants to closed them forever. The IGC is their weapon. 
	Their relation with the Toreadors is good, even if their clans are 
	enemies. It is said that Eric and Arnaud were very good friends in 
	the past, and they still see each other from time to time.
			They live under the Monparnass Graveyard, among the 
	rest of those who fell during the Commune. Some strange facts about 
	Jean, Eric, and Laurent is that no one has ever seen then. It is 
	wispered that they are so horrible that they cause fear in mortals 
	and great uneasiness among kindred. They, in fact, look as if there 
	were no flesh between there skin and their bones. Along with their 
	Nosferatu appearance, they look like Undead from your worst 
	nightmare! It is said that they all have the corruption touch, and 
	that plants, and small animals die from their touch.

	BACKGROUNDS NOTES: Back in the old days, when I was studing in Poland
	I found the most beautyfull lady ever! I loved her so much, but she
	went away with another...my sadness had no limit. It was in 1556 in
	the Yagelon University in Krakow that I saw her again, but she found
	someone else to love, another women! But these days are over now and
	she is dust...I still live, remember her and cry.
		I can speak many languages, and I travelled a lot, until
	I found Paris, and it's kingdom of the dead! My doom is too great 
	to carry, and no one will ever see me again; but they can still hear my 
	voice, that chills their unearthly blood!
	IMAGE: Ever seen the nosferatu page 54 of WoD? Well he is even worse.
	ROLE PLAYING: Be strange, make everyone feel uneasy (especialy women). 
	Then, change and be happy for a minute or so...

	BACKGROUND: I received the curse by the same Sire as Jean, and so we
	knew each other from the start! But what a curse! I cannot walk among
	the beauty of the world, since I am one of their most ugly things. But
	what a benediction, my lore of the world is so great that nothing
	is unknown to me...well somethings are but you know what I mean!
		One of my few children is living in the Opera House, he
	has even a book written about him! I will always be happy to see
	some of my clan, who love art! In fact, we should be the artistes of the
	undead, the Toreadors should consider our feeling and acept us as
	true "lovers" of Art! Many of us already sleep under the most beautyful
	Cathedrals of Paris!
	IMAGE: well hard to guess....
	ROLE PLAYING: You have an integral culture on art. You know true 
	ugliness, therefore you know beauty. You know a lot and hate it when 
	someone corrects you, BUT the problem is that you have a very bad 
	memory...

	BACKGROUND: Laurent is the most secret of his kind, never speaks. 
	In fact he speaks only to Eric and Jean. He loves all modern art,
	and especialy cinema. He has seen almost all the films, but
	he hates theater. "Theater cannot give you the deep emotions and 
	feelings that a camera can" as he says. He is in love with a mortal, 
	but loves her too much to inflicte the Curse on her. If something 
	happens to her, he will hunt and kill, in the most horrible way, the 
	offender. 
		He gives money to some cinemas, especialy the Max Linder 
	Panoram (he owns it, as a matter of fact). He is in on his way to 
	Golconda, and will reach it very soon. In fact, some say that he is 
	a member of the inconnu (this is untrue). 
		(since he never speaks, this was recored by Eric)
	IMAGE: .....If I say: appearence of 5, you won't belive me.
	ROLE PLAYING: He will never speak, nor be seen. But he can be 
	"sensed" (with very hight Auspex, or by luck) in a cinema. (He is in 
	love with "Piero le fou" by Godard, and will see it whenever it is 
	playing. )

	BACKGROUND:Ever heard of the Phantome de l'Opera? (phantom of the 
	Opera?). Well he is the one. His herd are the workers of the Opera.
	He has forgotten that he is a Kindred and feeds in a second state (he
	cannot remember feeding...).
	IMAGE: He has the most elegant clothes in this time, and wear a white
	mask over his face, as well as a hat. He can take care of some very 
	good singers and become their Mentor for sometime. He will NEVER 
	reveil his vampiric nature, even to a kindred. He will go into 
	frenzy if someone refers to him as: Vampire, Kindred, Cainite, 
	Nosferatu...
	ROLE PLAYING: He will speak to no one, but other singers. You know 
	you are far from better that them, so you require respect. Act like a 
	father watching his sons.

			There are little nosferatu in Paris, but most of them 
	are art lovers, and live in the catas, or under cathedrals, or 
	covents.

			The Malkavians has two very distinct groups in Paris:

	(i) The first is called thor et a dhor: They control all the clubs 
	around and in Paris. They are the "next generation of artists". 
	They will enter frenzy, if the name Toreador is pronounced in their 
	presence: They are caitiffes who thinks they have a clan! as Benoit, 
	their leader says. They will never attack the Toreadors, because of  
	logic no one understands. Some whisper that The former Prince was a 
	Malkavian, and that Villon killed him to take control. (this is
	untrue, the former Prince was a Ventrue: Labianus!).

	(ii) The second are more "classic", if such thing has ever existed.
	They are ruled by the youngest vampire ever made! he is 15th
	generation and 3 years old! She has a nurse, Tatiana, who was 
	embrased after she lost her child. In fact it is her who has
	convinced the others to have a baby at their head. "la verite sort 
	de la bouche des enfants" (truth comes from children's mouths) is her 
	moto.
			They are have all one thing in common: they are NOT 
	mad.... they are completly insane, behond any hope of understanding. 
	They are even more stange over here than any where else!

	it to anybody, even they don't know about it!
	My history is simple: there is no such thing as the Past, and it is 
	raining today. Lovely  sound of the cars outside. Leave me now,
	I have to see my fiancee, Karine ( a 7 generation, owner of the Zenith),
	Did I tell you that she was my child? No, probably not; but we are the
	Blood Oath together, and I might even taste her tonight! Did you ever 
	share blood with one of our kind? No, it is a pitty, it is great fun!

	BACKGROUND: She was embrased after a having an abortion. From
	that time on, she sired 9 other vampires, all pregnant, at different
	stages (1 a month). She then desided to sire a baby. She sired a women,
	who sired another,....to the 14 generation, who sired a baby! The 14,
	named Virginie, killed the others and become a 8th generation through 
	diablerie!
	Of course no one knows this fact! She is blood bonded to Tatiana, so
	she won't tell anyone. Virginie is in fact a poor 12 year old girl, 
	who should have listened to her mom when she told: Never speak to 
	strangers. The only probleme is that she now thinks she is a nurse
	and she doesn't remember her past at all, or does she?
	IMAGE: Always in a nurses dress, she has red hair and looks very "mean".
	ROLE PLAYING: If one of the players plays a child: you will love him
	(her)! If not just ignore them as much as you can!

			They are the founder of Paris, citee des lumieres. 
	They control art, models, cinemas, museums, monuments...and half of 
	the world's fashions. One word from their prince, Sire Francois Villon,
	makes a vampire the cream of the cream; or nearly nothing! The clan 
	has control Paris politics till the Religion Wars. The Ventrue 
	controled the Guise and Henri IV, the toreadors controlled the Valois 
	family. During this time, the inquisition arrived in Paris and a war 
	on kindred was set. A conclave was held in Rome, and the Toreadors 
	lost Paris to the Ventrue: Henry IV become the king, and ended the 
	wars. Sometime later, the Ventrue areed to let the Toreadors have 
	the Louvre (the old palace of the king). They built Versaille, so 
	they could have a eye on all the nobility of France, under their 
	ghoul: Louis XIV!. He has lived for a long time due to his vampiric 
	powers, but became a vampire. He died of the final death, in the Paris
	commune, killed by a member of the the Sabbat. 
	In fact, he was killed by Arnaud, who took his blood! but no one knows 
	this.
			The Louvre was, until now, the pride of the Clan. 
	F. Villon owns it and is the true master of the clan in Europe. The 
	Universal Exposition is in fact a Toreador meeting. All the Grande 
	Couture is controlled by Arnaud. The minister of culture, is a ghoul 
	of Villon, but is dominated to forget this when he changes functions.

	kill them (humanity of 10, conscience of 5).
		I am indeed, the master of the grande couture, and feed of them.
	My only retainer is a little cat, who spies for me. Some say that I 
	have one or two mortal lovers. But I will NOT sire, because I will
	have to admit diablerie, since I will never lie to my children, or 
	to my children's children.....and so on but some questions will never 
	be answered...

	6_ T H E  T R E M E R E :
			The clan has a deep hate for Paris, as they were not 
	able to go there for a long time due to the importance of the 
	Magi infulence. (they hate the Tremere for they turned into blood 
	suckers!!). This past few years, the Elders of the clan have managed 
	to convinced Villon to get them into the city. The Prince agreed on 
	one condition: All the tremere, leaving or passing through Paris 
	must NOT use any magic, and must have a Obsfuscat/Ritual that will 
	hide him/her to the spells of the Magi. Failure will be followed by 
	a Blood Hunt on all the clan in Paris. The Ventrue have agreed to 
	help the Toreadors if such a Hunt is called. The gangrel will help, 
	but they will not say it. (secretly Villon hopes that it will happend
	and he might even set something up... He hates beeing pushed around)
			The Elders have agreed to these terms, because they are
	so happy to set their agents to Paris, and work their plans. There 
	is a Chantry in Paris now: Its head is Abelard, known to be a 
	powerful wizard, and blood mage. Any Tremere going to Paris will have
	to go to the Elders who will cast a ritual on him/her. This ritual 
	will "hide" the vampire to the Arcanum defences, but that is all. See 
	The Magi of Paris, for more informations.
			The Elders plan for Paris is to learn more about the 
	Toreador power, and why they have so much influence over all the 
	others. They suspect an ancient to sleep under Paris and want to know 
	who is she/he! The Settites have made contact with them, and offered 
	their help! ?WHY? The Elders MUST know who is behind Paris.

	BACKGROUND:( If you are looking for a good guy: see someone else!)
		I was born to my new life in God's year 1792, in Spain. My
	Sire and mentor were very nice to me (poor fool even let me free of the 
	Blood Bond!), and he taught me a lot about my new powers...
	Now I was the Master of the Ars Magica; I could learn everything and
	be the Most Powerful, and then take control of the Orders of Hermes.
	For 150 years, we travelled the lands and the seas seeking powerful place
	to perform powerful rituals, but lo! one day my "beloved" sire did
	a spell I could never do, because of my generation (7th at the time).
	I went away and cried for nights over my lost hope. BUT a member of 
	the Sabbat saw me, and told that me I could take the blood of my sire, 
	and become more powerful through diableri. 
		I killed the poor fool, and drank his blood, but nothing 
	happened, I  was still a 7th. I set a trap for my sire and in june 
	1900 drank his blood; thus becoming a 6th!!!!!
		My plan was never discovered, and the Elders belive 
	the story I told them (we were attacted by some hunters, and my 
	sire met the final death on that day!). 
		I won't use my powers, unless my "life" depends on it. I 
	remember one night, I had to kill some Dogs (read Lupines, some of the 
	Lady's freinds), but it was the only time.
		The Elders of the clan see me as a great mage, but 
	there is something strange about my ways. He hasn't witnessed a sun 
	rise, because of my ability to conceal my actions, but the council 
	will be more happy if they could know a bit more about  me. They send me 
	to Paris because I might make a false move: then Villon will order a 
	Hunt on me, and the council will blame the Toreadors.
		I was approached by the Settites to uncover the corpse 
	of one of them, hidden in France in torpor. They are looking for more
	information, and I think that when the Ancient is found; I will 
	expose the Settites to the Prince (thus gaining prestige, and 
	wiping out my potential enemies). I think that the Ancient is a
	Methuselah, and if that is the case, with the ritual of the bitter rose
	I think I will be the True Master of the clan!
	IMAGE: He is a tall Spanish-type guy, in his 50s. Aways wearing a 
	black suit from Chanel, and the most expensive aftershave on the 
	market.
	ROLE PLAYING: You are a Master among Slaves: You respect only those 
	who have more power than you. The others are your slaves! You will 
	try to hide your feelings, but if they notice it, never mind they are 
	just slaves.

===============================================================================
	7_T H E  V E N T R U E :
			The clan got control of France after the religious wars,
	but they had to wait till Louis XIV became king to really have a hand 
	on Paris; and therefore on France. Even if Villon is the Prince, he 
	has to consult the clan to get anything which isn't art done. Villon 
	hates this situation and will do anything to wipe out the Ventrue from
	his city, and France! By some allience with the Brujah clan, the 
	prince managed to weaken the Ventrue, and now they control few 
	important people around Paris. 
			The clan meets in Versaille, every Sunday, to debate on
	the affairs of the state. But the clan is weak, and hasn't got the power 
	to face the Toreadors. But they try to gain control of other clans. 
	The Nosferatu are an easy aim, since the Toreadors won't help them! 
	afterwhich the Malkavians, and the Gangrel. They plan to make each clan in 
	their debt, then call for a conclave, and attack the Toreadors. Well 
	this is for the future, because the clan is weak and waits for "new 
	blood". This is due to the intervention of the Brujah clan over this 
	200 years.
			They are lead by an old vampire, since his name 
	is Labianus, he was Caesar's general, who in 52BC took 
	Lutece (old name of Paris).

	BACKGROUND: I was one of Caesars lieutenants, and the only one left!
	I went into torpor soon after being embrased and awoke some 1200 
	years after. When I saw that my beloved city was a TOREADOR PLACE, I
	took imediate action: The War of Religion was set, and I showed them 
	all!
		But after the inquisition days, I was quite happy to welcome 
	the allience, and left Paris to the Toreador who gave France 
	to the clan. I still want to see Paris free from this Degenerates, 
	but the Beast is strong in me, and I know that one day I will hunt 
	Villon and kill him! I CANNOT order a Blood Hunt on anyone, and this 
	has made me despair for so long.....
	IMAGE: He was a soldier, and is still one! Always in an uniform, and 
	the general grade. Rather short, but muscular, he is a warrior of old.
	His dark skin and hair would reveal his mediteranian origin, if his 
	accent was less pronouced.
	ROLE PLAYING: You are the best warrior ever and proud of it. If the 
	one you speak to is a soldier, you will respect him; if it is 
	civilian: They won't know what you are saying, so take time 
	explaining things to them. ("You know a 44 desert eagle, the gun not 
	the bird!").

	BACKGROUND: I had a little problem in Germany, this lupine was

===============================================================================
					"One day, my children, one day
					 I will return from my sleep,
					 And that day:
					 NIGHT WILL SET UPON THE WORLD!"
				Set, god of corruption, Lord of darkness.

	8_ T H E  S E T I T E :
			Their lord was sleeping for eternity, but they always 
	belived that He will come back; that day will become night and that 
	night become total darkness. The darkness is upon the world, for the 
	followers have found what they are looking for; or so they think! 
			The political situation of Paris was kown by the 
	setites for a long time, and now they made their first move to find 
	out why! They suppose it is because of an old setite, who is in torpor 
	under Paris, but who still influences the rest of the city (and France.)
	They sent 5 setites to Paris, with the aim to discover who is the 
	Elder, and bring him back to Egypt.
			They haven't told Villon they are in Paris, and if 
	he knew of this in his city, he would order a Blood Hunt at once. 
	They keep their temple secret, and no one knows where it is. They have
	made contact with Abelard, and gave him some help in the past. He will
	protect them in Paris, and help them in their search. Of course, he 
	was corrupted by the leader of the Setites... his lust for power was 
	too obvious for ANY setite to miss! It is quiet obvious that he 
	will be killed when the Elder is found.

	BACKGROUND: I was a very nice person, but I was sent in prison...
	Well, I net my Sire there and he made me into one of the few followers 
	of Set!!! I was sent on difficult missions for our God, and I always
	succeeded! I ended up in Paris in the 1900 century, but was discovered
	by a Nosferatu called Eric, so I left with haste, but now he has 
	forgotten me and I will have my revenge.
			I tested my new reborn power in 1990, by corrupting 
	a member of the French goverment and making him sign a paper to give 
	HIV-contaminated blood to some 200 hemophiles! This worked very well, 
	and all the clans look at the others for an explanation. In fact, they 
	do not really care, for vampires cannot have AIDS, but the more human 
	of them want to know who did it! The Sabbat is the first suspect!
	IMAGE: She looks like an innocent girl, in her mid 20's. Always a poor 
	face, which lights when someone takes care of her. Dressed as to 
	seduce the person you are aiming at, and always talk as to seduce 
	her/him.
	ROLE PLAYING: You are a plotter and a survivor: the others are just 
	above nothing: If they serve you, ok; if not corrupt them and use 
	them.... as long as it amuses you.

==============================================================================
	9_ O T H E R  C L A N S :

			1_ASSAMITES:
		They have the right to come to Paris, as long as they stick to
	the rules. Some might be send to take a job in the Vampire Club, other
	could go there to kill a member of any other clan. (F.Villon, Arnaud, 
	Laurent, and Benoit have escape such assassinations, and are therefore
	not concerned.). Sebastien will provide them a haven in his club.

			2_GIOVANNI:
		None of these rats are ever to enter Paris: if they do, Villon
	will order a Hunt at once. 

			3_RAVNOS:
		They are welcome in France, but not in Paris. They can stay
	there, but she/he will have to report his activities to a Toreador 
	every night at 1200. If she/he enters the Louvre to steal something, he
	will find himself/herself watching the sun rise! They can steal any
	other things, but art is forbidden. (ie a diamond:ok, a painting:final
	death!).

			4_SALUBRI:
		This kindred will tend not to go to Paris, it is a city which
	is great, from a long distance. Each Salubri who dreams about Paris
	will have his worst nightmare. They are able to sense that there is 
	something strange about that city.

			5_THE SABBAT:
		They are few in Paris, and their power is weak. But they will
	try to start a conflict among the other clans as soon as they see
	an occation. They made an alliance with a pack of Black Spiral Dancers
	who are trying to fullfill their own schemes... They are a pack of 5 
	vampires. They all leave in a communal Heaven in the sewers (the 
	Nosferatu don't live there!!!), they have another heaven, in an old 
	church inside Paris, but they will use it only in emergencies. They 
	are the Templates of the PGttS (if you haven't got the book; go and 
	buy it! it is worth the money...), with the following modifications:

		*Richard: the assamite antitribu. (quietus 4, generation 4, 
		  browl 4, dodge 4, celerity 3.)

		*Virginia: the city gangrel antitribu. ( celerity 2, protean 4,
		  generation 4, brawl 3, finance 2.)

		*Vincent: the Lasombra. (dominate 3, obtenebration 5, 
		  generation 6, sabbat status 3, pack recog 3, leadership 5, 
		  subterfuge 5, finance 4.)

		*Gerard: the malkavian antitribu. (Auspex 4, dementation 4,
		  animalism 2, dexterity 4, perception 5, stealth 4.)

		*Anne: the Tzimisce priest. (Vicissitude 6, Thaumaturgy 3, 
		  fire ways 3, generation 6, manipulation 5, charisma 5,
		  occult 4, subterfuge 4, investigation 3.)

			Their Vinculums are as followed, the first row is the
	value of the mane, the column indicates for who (eg: Richard got a
	Vinculum of 9 for Anne. She got a 7...poor Richard!!):

		| Vinculum | Richard | Virginia | Vincent | Gerard | Anne |
		| Richard  |    NA   |    6     |    8    |    5   |   9  | 
		| Virginia |    4    |    NA    |    8    |    4   |   5  |
		| Vincent  |    8    |    5     |    NA   |    6   |   7  |
		| Gerard   |    7    |    2     |    9    |    NA  |   4  |
		| Anne     |    7    |    6     |    8    |    1   |   NA |

	10_ I N T E R A C T I O N  T A B L E S.
		Sorry I cannot give nice pictures for all my NPCs, but this 
	might help as a quick references for the interactions between some of
	the Cainites in Paris. This is only for Camarilla Kindred, for
	Sabbat, see above.

					"...When will you rage!"
						A garou.

	1_ T H E  G A R O U :
		There is a brood of garous living in the forest near Paris. 
	They are weak, due to vampire presence, but are still important. 
	Their aim is to hunt down the Wyrm of Paris! This is a great (and 
	foolish) task! The only trees in Paris are mutants! Paris is a 
	stronghold for the Wyrm, the Defence, is their dwelling place. 
	Companies have their GHQ there, and it is easy to corrupt them. In fact 
	it is easier to corrupt people here!. 
		The leader of the brood, Melodie, is a very good friend with 
	a vampire (the Lady of Arbanville!). The two have known each other for a 
	long time, and are ready to help the other. Of course this friendship
	is not appreciated among other Garou, and Melodie has survived 
	several challenges on that! Nevertheless the allience between the two is
	working pretty well: The ecologist mvts are developing quite well 
	(around 18% at the last elections...) and the scouts of Paris are 
	doing more and more things to help Gaia. (meetings, advertising,
	etc...). BUT the Lady told the Garou of an evil presence in town: 
	Abelard, a Vampire/mage of great power. His arrival corresponded to 
	the arrival of a pack of Black Spiral Dancers, that is what causes 
	the uneasiness among the garou. Why are they here? Are they related 
	to Abelard? What are they looking for?
			Melodie, is a female garou, very calm and intelligent. 
	She knows when to rage and when to use her brain. She is an Homid, and
	is quiet good looking. She lives in the Mie de Pain (a shelter for 
	homeless in Paris) and half the staff are also Garou. They serve a
	meal every evening to all who come there. They are helped by some 
	scouts (Who were sent by the Lady, but they don't know it.).

	2_T H E  H O L Y  I N Q U I S I T I O N.
		Use the vampire hunter of Gary as the head of the Paris 
	inquisition. He knows of vampires, and of magi. He has been more 
	oriented to fight the magi (he still belives they are demonologists).
	He hasn't got many powers, but he is spyed on by Jean or his retainers.
		Following is a list of ideas for a group of hunters who might 
	give daymares to your players: 

	[WARRNING: Contribution made and copyrighted by Dennis Depalma alias 
	"renfield@camelot.bradley.edu", with his permission.]

	1.  A TEAM!  Who in their right minds would want to hunt alone?
	For the exact same reason vampires form into coteries, hunters 
	should create there own circles.  Recruiting should be reasonably
	high on the list of priorities, putting together a group with 
	a wide range of skills and resources.  Suggested group members
	should be:
	-The bankroller:  The person who has all the cash, a spoiled rich
	kid that does it for fun or maybe a tired old man who's devoted 
	his life to the hunt.  Through this cash supply, the hunters will
	have access to the absolute best weapons money can buy.  Another
	idea is to have the hunters bankrolled by the government, a 
	corporation (Weird R' Us Department) or by organized crime (a 
	mortal drug dealer who's tired of following orders).  Whatever
	the money source, it'll allow the players to get some of the 
	neat toys listed later on.
	-Contact person:  Could be the same guy as the bankroller, doesn't
	have to be.  Sure, a vampire controls city government, but is it
	the one you're hunting?  If not, then your contact man can get the
	local police to harass the vampire you are after.  He can also go 
	through the city records system and find a lot of havens.  Might 
	even be able to get some media attention to endanger the
	masquerade.
	-Occultist:  Magick can be a great equalizer against the vampires.
	A decent occultist should at the very least be able to help spot
	any vampires, and probably help with the tracking.  They should
	also be able to foil certain attacks, and place alarm wards around
	the hunters base, making it hard for the undead or their servants
	to catch the hunters by surprise.
	-Techie:  This is something that is often neglected, in my opinion.
	People tend to rely on off the shelf items, but why not find
	someone who can help you out by making designer hunting tools?  A
	flamethrower is WWI tech, any decent shop instructor could crank
	out an unreliable one himself.  Tech's should also have some type
	of chemistry skill, so he can mix up a nice little batch of
	plastique or thermite or something similar to surprise a vampire
	when he starts his car.  
	-Detective:  Somebody good at shadowing, spotting the undead, and
	tracing the indicators of their existence.  Somebody who can also,
	if necessary, help find replacements for any of the hunters who 
	happen to buy it.
	-Butt kicker:  Somebody who can use all the neat guns and stuff 
	the hunters can have.  Also should be physically effective, not
	that he could take the vampires in hand to hand (although a Navy 
	SEAL should be able to take you average (i.e. non-combat monster) 
	vampire.  Somebody to actually pound the stake in, or to actually
	fire the rocket launcher into the haven.
	2:  Good planning.  Just because the players are often disorganized
	or divided against each other doesn't mean the hunters should be.
	These guys are professionals, and presumably very good at what they
	do.  Not only do they know all the tricks, but they should come up
	with new ones as the situation warrants.  Booby traps, terrorist 
	tactics, ambushes, and other dirty tricks should all be high on
	their list of things to do.  Also, keep them ruthless.  These guys
	are fighting their very own Holy War, they shouldn't be worrying 
	about civilians.  Blowing up apartment buildings to get at the one
	kindred haven on the top floor is not outside their potential.  Car
	bombs are distributed like party favors, and they take great pains
	to always insure that it is one kindred versus half a dozen well
	armed, highly trained kine in a venue of their choosing.
	3:  Appropriate weapons.  What's up with all these hammers and 
	wooden stakes?  Not a chance in today's world, buddy.  Assault
	weapons, heavy pistols, and grenades can immobilize a kindred if 
	used well.  Flamethrowers are hard to buy commercially, but there
	is a black market and the technology really isn't advanced.  For 
	capture, there's always crossbows and spearguns, many of which are
	strong enough to punch through steel.  A high powered rifle and a 
	telescopic sight makes a great tool for softening up a vampire 
	before your teammates move in, three or four shots to the head and
	chest should leave him low on blood and at least wounded.  Tasers 
	don't work (as far as I know) nor does mace, but an acid sprayer 
	will do the job on a vampires eyes.  Nail guns could be modified 
	to throw small spikes, and keep in mind the kindreds extreme fear 
	of fire.  Hair spray is a nasty weapon in trained hands.  
	4:  Tactics-  Different than organization and planning, this allows
	hunters to use attacks the kindred can't.  Drive buy shootings
	work, because the hunters know who's kindred and who isn't.
	Admittedly, it's hard to kill a vampire with guns, but a dozen 
	shotgun shells will slow him down and make him a little less 
	cocky. 
	5:  Daytime movement- the hunters best weapon.  If the hunters 
	find out where the kindred live, no matter what the kindred's 
	defenses, she can be killed.  You've got ghouls, the hunters 
	kill or disable the ghouls.  You've got dogs, the dogs are toast.
	You've got the best alarm system money can buy, the hunters have 
	a mad scientist techie that can circumvent it.  You sleep in a 
	lead lined steel bank vault, the hunters can either break in or 
	seal it shut.  Locking a vampire in forever is almost as good 
	as killing it.  
		Or say you have no haven and sleep out doors.  No problem.
	the hunters follow you to the spot where you earth meld one night,
	and spend the day preparing for your reemergence.  They coat ...
	oh, how about a twenty foot radius circle around where you went
	under with about an inch of beeswax, tar, napalm, or even silly 
	string.  When you emerge into the night, they light it up, 
	simultaneously blasting you to bits with their shotguns.  You 
	get away by earth melding, no problem.  They come back the next 
	night and do it again. 

 	I guess the important thing is to give your hunters a fair shake.
	They might not all be Rambo, but they should be able to kick some butt.
	Give the hunters as much credit as you give to any of the vampires, 
	and they should do okay.
	Good inspiration for hunter teams:
		Sneakers
		A-Team
		Ghostbusters
		The terrorists from either of the Die Hard movies.
		NOT the Frog brothers.


		Here is a list of a hunters who lives in Paris, their leader:
	Father Vairnom and his "followers/allies/hunters" who helps him. A poor
	kine was embrased a year ago by a vampire of Paris. He went mad, and 
	tryed to see a priest (to help him finding a way to redemption). BUT 
	alas, he found Vairnom; who imprisoned him and did some experiments
	on him: fire, light, stake, power of the cross, holy water.... The 
	poor priest lost his mind, and thinks of himself as "the armed arm of 
	GOD". For him all vampires are evil and must be destroyed: There is 
	starvation in Somalia, because of vampires; war in middle est, because 
	of vampire; (insert what you don't like), because of vampires. He 
	burned the poor kindred who sought help, and try to hunt down his sire: 
	(who ever you want him to hunt!! a player perhaps?). 
		He managed to get some help from some other parisians, who 
	belive in the danger of kindred! They do not know how many they are,
	and think that the sire is the last one in Paris!

		Paris is (and was) a great place for magi, rituals are 
	easier to perform and there is much lore to be found in the libraries
	of the Orders og Hermess. Their main plot (as regard to Cainites) is
	to know a little more about the Tremere Clan. They will let them come
	to Paris, then capture some leaders and question them! Well this is a 
	good plan, even if the Tremere have some powerful rituals they 
	cannot yet break. They know of Abelard and will try to get him for 
	interrogation! the ony problem is that the Order is divided as what 
	to do after: Kill him, or make him a slave, or maybe take immortality 
	from him. 
		As Magi is not out yet, this might (actually will) change. But 
	the basic idea will still be there. Since I don't know of any 
	clans/orders/??? I cannot tell you who is the leader or anything else,
	sorry.

			Paris, city of light, is in fact a city of darkness. 
	Corruption is easy in Paris. Anything has it's price, is true in 
	Paris. All living or undead person in Paris will or are be open to 
	the touche of corruption, or will corrupt others. Only those will 
	hight humanity (humanity of 10, councence of 5, or Golconda) will be 
	immunue to this effect. Note that this is NOT apparent, you (as ST), 
	must make the climat of Paris as dark as you can.
			The ST will have to show Paris on two different 
	aspects: The first; the beautifull city. La citee des arts, glitering
	and lovly. (as in the vampire club, the louvre, etc...). This is where 
	art express itself. The Toreadors must remain in power, or this dream 
	will fade! Villon knows it, but still wonders WHY? This is the Paris 
	you will see in tourist guides, on postcards, and blablablabla.
	the second; Paris the pit! corruption, gangs, homeless, blablabla. 
	It is the Paris of the "cours des miracles" (think the right 
	translation is Court of the miracles, it was a court of beggars in 
	the ?? century). you must show your player both sides, and swap from 
	one to the other as they cross a street, or change tube!
			Why the Toreadors didn't "clean" the city and made it
	a haven for artistes? well there is an Ancient vampire under Paris. 
	He walked the earth for millenium, he was sired by Sutekh, in the 
	Land Of The Pharaons! For millenium he planed total destruction of 
	the world of the livings, and of the world of the undeads...Now, even 
	in his unearthly sleep, he still cast a shadow over the small town of 
	Lutecia, in Gauls. But the truth is far more darker, in his madness
	he opened a gate to the Black Lodge; a powerful place, where spirits
	meet. He was possessed by a Spirit called Bob, and went into torpor 
	just after. 
			Villon is aware that there is something strange in 
	Paris...He thinks that it might be due to an old and powerful Cainite
	but he is not sure. He now suspects that there are powerful spirit
	activity and it is the first reason why he allowed the Tremere in
	town! He is trying to contact the Inconnue to get their aid, but 
	had no success so far. One of the future campaine will be set
	around the Black Lodge, I'll do it next year (ie 1993/1994). It will
	be playtested.

	1_The Black Lodge: An Overview.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		The Black Lodge is a spiritual force from Native American  
	belief, which has been modernized and corrupted by the dreams of an  
	increasingly more and more self-gratifying humanity.
		The Black Lodge is spiritual location, another plane of  
	existance closely tied to the earth, but not by the usual linear  
	earth-type "you get there by going north" fashion. It instead is a  
	realm inside of dreams, the soul, and the mind. The Black Lodge is a  
	domain in the Umbra, darkly linked to Gaia. As such, it can be  
	reached by Garou stepping sideways, but to do so would require a  
	great expenditure of Willpower and most importantly Rage to reach it,  
	I, as a ST would take several from each off the character attempting  
	to force his way into the Lodge, perhaps even making them permanant  
	losses.
		The Black Lodge is a place of Madness. Perhaps at one time it  
	was pure Wylding madness, but has over time been corrupted by the  
	Wyrm. It is a place where the Weaver holds no dominion, and realty is  
	a dream.
		Time does not flow linearly within the Lodge. Events can  
	happen in any order there, effect before cause, effect without a  
	cause, cause without effect. And time within the lodge relates to  
	time outside the lodge in the same fashion. If a person is seduced by  
	the lodge's madness in the year 1990, then it is fair game for the  
	Lodge Spirits to influence the persons actions in 1940 or 2016, and  
	within the lodge it will appear that these influences took place  
	after the persons seduction, usually. There are no hard-and-fast  
	rules within the lodge. Time is what you make of it.

	2_Entering the Lodge: 
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		There are several known methods of entering the lodge. Garou  
	may be able to force their way into the Lodge by stepping sideways,  
	as mentioned above. Doing so would be a costly, and dangerous,  
	proposition. 
	
		Particularily twisted Tremere or Magi might develop a ritual  
	or spell to allow them access to the Lodge in an attempt to negotiate  
	with the Lodge spirits in exchange for power. Even the attempt to do  
	so virtually guarentees the attemptor that s/he will be possesed or  
	murdered by the Lodge spirits. This does not deter said Magi however,  
	as their mere desire to enter the Lodge at any point in their life  
	opens the neccesary doorway for a Lodge spirit to begin directing the  
	wizard in the direction neccesary to be embraced by the Lodge. 

		There are locations which exist in nature, similar to Caerns,  
	which hold portals to the black lodge. These portals open rarely,  
	usually only once every 50 to 500 years, and are dependant on the  
	position of the planets. When one of these portals is open, anyone  
	may enter the Lodge through  merely by stepping into the center of the  
	portal. [The ring of Sycamore trees from the series]

		Any one who has been seduced by the Lodge will enter the  
	lodge in spirit form whenever the Lodge spirit who seduced them  
	desires. While this is happening, the Lodge spirit will control their  
	body, making them commit horrendous crimes and acts of evil. The  
	amount the seduced body/mind recalls of these acts while it is not  
	being possesed appears to be up to the Lodge Spirit's whim. 

		Also, any one who has been seduced by a Lodge Spirit will  
	enter the lodge whenever they fall asleep. In these periods, the  
	Lodge spirit does NOT enter the body, instead the soul roams the  
	lodge in what will be remembered as a never-ending tensely surreal  
	recurring dream, in which the individual wanders a limitless series  
	of identical rooms interacting with evil reflections of people who  
	have or will play an important part in their life.
		Further, since time has no meaning (or perhaps just a meaning  
	incomprehensible to humans) within the Lodge, anyone who is fated to  
	someday be seduced by the Lodge can be influenced by Lodge spirits  
	before their actual seduction, being posessed as above or entering  
	the lodge in dream-form, as above. [For example, for the year before  
	his possession, Cooper wandered the Lodge in his dreams on a highly  
	regular basis]
		And lastly, items brought from the Lodge into Gaia may be  
	used as portals into the Lodge by those who have been or are fated to  
	be seduced by the Lodge. These items may allow the doomed to enter  
	the lodge spiritually and/or physically, and the entrance may or may  
	not be controlled by the doomed. The specifics vary from item to item  
	and incident to incident. [The photo Mrs. Chalfont gives to Laura  
	and/or Teresa Banks's ring are good examples of such items]

	3_Inside the Lodge: a visual description.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Most Caern-like openings into the Lodge and most  
	dream-passages begin in a part of the Lodge known as The Waiting  
	Room. 
		The waiting room is a large room with thick red curtains for  
	walls and a zig-zag pattern of off-white & off-black stripes on the  
	floor. It is furnished by three black apolstered chairs, two of them  
	next to each other, the third a short distance away and facing at a  
	90 degree angle perpendicular to the other two. The seperate chair is  
	adjacent to a small black marble end table with a small white marble  
	sculptur on it. The sculpture appears to be of a planet or  
	astrological model, but never manages to draw much direct attention.  
	The chairs in close proximity to one another have a similar endtable  
	between them, this one lacking a sculpture. And at either end of the  
	chair/endtable/chair combination stands a tall brass floor lamp.  
	Behind the chairs is a near-life size white marble statue of a female  
	nude Coffee is often served in the waiting room, but I wouldn't  
	recommend drinking it. 

		If you pass thru the curtains in any direction you will find  
	a short hallway, also walled by curtains, and with the same floor.  
	Passing thru curtains out of this hallway will take you to another  
	room almost identical to the waiting room. The only difference will  
	be the furnishings. Apparently an infinite number of rooms such as  
	this exist, and appear in a totally random order. One is furnished  
	with a black chair and a single brass lamp, another with nothing but  
	an ornate silver table, another...etc.
		If you continue to travel without a deffinate destination in  
	mind thru the lodge, you will continue to pass thru room after room  
	on this order, and most certainly become lost.
		However, if you walk with a target location in mind, and are  
	willing to spend a Willpower, Gnosis, Rage, or HUMANITY point to get  
	there, you can step thru any curtain and arrive in any location  
	within the lodge.
		Other locations include any entrance room that an artifact  
	gate or item opens into. Thru these rooms, you MAY be able to exit  
	the Lodge. These rooms can look like ANYTHING, but probably resemble  
	the item they are linked to. 

		The final location is The Meeting Room. This wood-floored  
	room is where the Lodge spirits get together for reasons  
	incomprehensible to mankind. This square room is occupied by a small  
	stage in the corner, several chairs, a dark-colored sofa, and the  
	infamous green formica table (allso, I could have SWORE I saw a  
	1960's refrigerator next to one of the chairs).
	Possible ways in which the Black Lodge can be used in V:tM :
		#1: Much as they were used in the TV show: a bunch of rowdy,  
	unhuman spirits who drag the PC's into their power struggles as pawns  
	and/or food.
		#2: Another interesting idea might be to make the Black Lodge  
	= the beast. In this sort of chronicle, all vampires are possessed by  
	Lodge Spirits when ever they frenzy. All vampire PC's would probably  
	start out with the Dark Fate flaw. Alternately, you could do this for  
	lupines, connecting the Black Lodge to the moon and too the Veil.  
	Either way would work, but I prefer it with the vamps being  
	possessed, as it fits the concept of them "having no souls" and also  
	fits well with The Little Man's fascination with green formica  
	tabletops.
		#3: And my final idea for using this, would be to have the  
	PC's play Lodge spirits. Yeah, you heard me right. This is only  
	advised if you're dealing only with players who are either very  
	experienced role-players, or total 'Peaks Freaks. Otherwise, it'd be  
	VERY difficult for them to stay in character. You've been warned.

	4_Additional note about entrances into the Black Lodge:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Aside from the methods of entrance I noted in my earlier  
	posting, it seems to me that area's which have become slowly and  
	gradually charged with wyrm energy become more and more similar to  
	the lodge, until at last the eventually open a physical threshold  
	into the Black Lodge. By wyrm energy, I'm not talking about high  
	powered, split second flashes of evil, but rather, in this case,  
	lethargic/lecherous energies which continually pervade a location.  
	[examples from the show include One-Eyed Jacks, the Bang Bang Bar,  
	and the convenience store in Buenos Aries which Phillip Jeffries  
	discovered] Such locale's become slowly build up with this energy (a  
	more appropriate description might be "lack of energy", as these  
	areas tend to syphon off the intellectual energies of those who  
	enter, leaving them hollow) over years, until they begin to shift  
	into looking like the black lodge. The change is gradual, and usually  
	goes unnoticed by those who frequent such locale's, but garou and  
	mystics who enter the place for the first time will notice a  
	metaphysical stench/blanket of laziness charging/smothering it. From  
	such a location, anyone possessed by a lodge spirit may physically  
	enter the lodge, but it should be costly in willpower and/or  
	garmonbozia (see below). Inside the lodge, an analog will slowly  
	begin to form, a combination of the infested locale and the  
	red-curtain motif of the lodge.

	5_The singularity.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		"Do you know who I am? I am the arm."
				 - The Little Man From Another Place
	
		To really stew it all down, there is only ONE lodge spirit.  
	Only one. It has the ability however to divide itself into lesser  
	incarnations, more specialized ones.  The lodge exists, and it has  
	it's own goals in mind which it directs the lesser spirits of itself  
	too, but they can attempt to subvert the goals of the lodge [like The  
	Giant / The Little Man From Another Place did in the show, trying to  
	help Cooper avoid being sucked into the Lodge].  
	
		 The lodge broke itself off into at least 2 separate spirits,  
	Bob and Mike, there were probably others. Between each of these were  
	formed lesser spirits that bridged the gap in their personalities and  
	foci. In addition, they form more lesser spirits whenever they  
	possess an individual. Any Lodge Spirit can dissolve any and all of  
	the lesser spirits which are directly linked to them, but cannot  
	dissolve those further out, and to do any dissolution is very costly.

	6_Garmonbozia.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Defined within the context of the movie/series as both "Corn"  
	and "Pain & Sorrow", Garmonbozia is in a way the food of the Black  
	Lodgers.  
	
		In game statistics, Garmonbozia is pooled trait, similar to  
	blood pool, rage, gnosis, and willpower in that points of it are  
	spent to utilize supernatural powers. It is different from all of the  
	above in that it has no set maximum, and that it can take damn near  
	forever to replenish. 
	
	6_Hierarchy.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~
		All Black lodgers also have a hierarchy rating, which defines  
	how far removed they are from the lodge in the same way that  
	Generation determines how far a cainite is removed from Caine. The  
	lodge itself has Hierarchy 0, Bob and Mike each have1's or 2's,  
	Phillip Gerard and Mrs. Tremond's Grandson are 2's or 3's, etc. 

	7_Replenishing/Increasing Garmonbozia.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		There are at least three ways in which Garmonbozia may be  
	replenished. 

			The most rewarding is thru possession. If a Black  
	Lodger is able to possess an individual temporarily, and during that  
	possession cause them to loose a humanity point, the Black Lodger  
	will reap great amounts of Garmonbozia from it.  The figure I  
	recommend (But have yet to play-test) is as follows:
					 Have the possessed make another  
	humanity roll, this one against a low difficulty (3 thru 5). Failure  
	on this roll will NOT cause them to loose additional humanity.  
	Rather, total the number of successes made, and multiply them by  
	their (pre-possession) humanity score. The result is the number of  
	Garmonbozia points the lodger gets.  (For example, Bob is possessing  
	Leland. He forces Leland to kill Laura, thereby dropping Leland from  
	a four to a three humanity. Leland rolls four dice against a  
	difficulty of 3 and gets two successes. 2 x Leland's prepossession  
	humanity of 4 = 8, so Bob feeds 8 Garmonbozia points off of it.  Had  
	he forced Cooper {Humanity 10} to kill Annie, he could have  
	potentially gotten around 70 or 80 points from that one act)
			The only other safe way to replenish/build up   
	Garmonbozia is by absorption from those around you.  If a Black  
	Lodger is able to cause an individual near him emotional pain, he can  
	psychically suck that sadness/sorrow in for nourishment. To do so, he  
	must concentrate, but it requires no rolls or special actions on his  
	part. The person in pain, must roll humanity, but with no adverse  
	effects if they fail, against a low difficulty. If they net any  
	successes at all, the Black Lodger is gains one garmonbozia point,  
	two points if the trauma is especially heart-wrenching. 
			Then there is the dangerous way to get  Garmonbozia,  
	which is too steal it from the other Black Lodgers. ["You stole the  
	corn from the can on the shelf, Bob! The thread is about to break Mr.  
	Palmer!" - Phillip Gerard]You can only steal Garmonbozia from those  
	of an equal or higher Hierarchy number (i.e. those equally or further  
	removed from the lodge than oneself) To do so requires an action of  
	any sort which is symbolic of theft or eating off of the other  
	lodgers plate, at which moment is made a extended contested willpower  
	roll. Whichever spirit runs out of willpower first automatically  
	looses 2/3rds of their Garmonbozia (Half of which is gained by the  
	winner of the duel, and half of which is lost to the lodge itself).
		You might also want to allow Garmonbozia to be increased by  
	spending experience if you play black lodge chronicle type 3 (above),  
	at a rate of one experience point = about 5 Garmonbozia points.  Such  
	increases could be justified as being the result of all the assorted  
	crap the characters mere presence has brought into the lives of those  
	she is around.

	8_Using/Expending Garmonbozia.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Garmonbozia is used in many ways.  It is spent to power the  
	Lodge Spirits supernatural powers, it is used whenever they attempt  
	to possess an individual, it is used to bring someone across into the  
	black lodge while they sleep, and it is used to create further lodge  
	spirits.

	9_Creating Lodge Spirits.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		A lodge spirit may create (at any time in which it has more  
	than 2 Garmonbozia points) another lodge spirit.  Such lodge spirits  
	must be warped perspective reflections of oneself, wrapped around a  
	focus of some sort. [For example: Bob has other things to do than  
	maintaining constant watch over Leland (Which he does end up doing  
	anyway as time goes by and Cooper starts getting to close to learning  
	the truth) so he draws forth an aspect of himself, creating a lesser  
	spirit which is Bob weaved into the mentality and maturity of Leland  
	as a child, one to watch over Leland and keep him from figuring out  
	what was happening to him. Then later Bob needed an agent who's  
	perceptions would always be in the physical world keeping track of  
	Cooper et al, so he formed a part of himself into The Owl, which was  
	focused around spying on coopers actions, and then... well, you get  
	the point. ]
			To do so, it must find a focus, envision a form for  
	the new spirit which symbolizes that form, and then transfer a  
	portion of it's life-force into making that vision and foci real.  It  
	must spend one third of it's current Garmonbozia (rounded up)on the  
	creation.  Those points are consumed by the lodge, who then gives the  
	spirit the immediate capacity to solidify it's vision into a new  
	lesser spirit. 
	
			The new spirit thus created has a Hierarchy number  
	one larger (weaker) than the spirit who focused/formed it, and has a  
	starting Garmonbozia pool of 1/2 the pool the "parent" spirit had  
	just prior to the forming.  (Yes, this will net a total Garmonbozia  
	between the two of them which is LARGER than the Garmonbozia pool  
	possessed by the spirit who created the other one. Why do you think  
	Mike was willing to form The Giant and Phillip Gerard? Because he  
	knew that in the long run it would make him MORE powerful within the  
	lodge. )
		Also, while the personality of the new spirit IS that of it's  
	creator wrapped around a focus, it IS a free willed spirit, capable  
	of disobeying or even turning against it's creator over time, but  
	probably will not do this, for reasons which follow...
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	10_Dissolving Lodge Spirits.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Any lodge spirit may dissolve any lesser spirits which it has  
	formed as direct links to itself. [Bob may dissolve Mrs. Tremond's  
	Grandson, but he can't lay a finger on Phillip Gerard] To do so,  
	certain conditions must be met:
			The spirit you wish to dissolve must be one of your  
	direct "children": of the Hierarchy rating just above (weaker) than  
	yourself, and created by you. You may not dissolve another spirits  
	construct, no matter what it's Hierarchy. 

			You must currently possess more or equal amounts of  
	Garmonbozia as it does. Any excess in it's favor will deny you the  
	right to destroy it. 

			You must win an extended contested Willpower roll  
	against it.  

	and lastly:
			You must make some sort of symbolic attack against  
	it's focus.  [For example, in order to destroy Mrs. Tremond's  
	Grandson, he would have to symbolically weaken it's link to Leland,  
	perhaps by having possessing someone and forcing them to send Leland  
	a valentine.  :)
		Once you have successfully completed the above requirements,  
	the lodge will grant you the immediate ability to dissolve the spirit  
	in question.  All of it's Garmonbozia will be absorbed by the lodge  
	itself, along with one third of your own (ST's might think this all  
	seems pretty drastic, but I believe the dissolution of a Lodge Spirit  
	should be a major event, an undertaking not taken lightly)

	11_Lodge Artifacts:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Aside from creating spirits from themselves, Black Lodgers  
	may also create physical bodies [Phillip Gerard   and   The Owl] too.  
	To do should be more costly, and such a being should only start out  
	with 1/3rd the Garmonbozia of it's creator, not 1/2, and lacks the  
	ability to possess that non-physical lodge spirits have.
		Physical Artifacts may also be created [Teresa Bank's ring or  
	the photo Mrs. Tremond gives Laura are both good examples, both being  
	able to draw a person into the lodge.   Another good example is the  
	coffee cup which traps Cooper's soul in the lodge at the end of the  
	last episode]. Such items only have 1/4th the Garmonbozia of the  
	creator, and are indiscriminate in their evil. They perform  
	particular functions well, using certain powers at the cost of one  
	Garmonbozia point each.  They continue to work toward their focus  
	until they run out of Garmonbozia, and are non-replenishable. The  
	reason a spirit would create such an object is simple: artifacts lack  
	free will, and as such will never turn against you. Also, unlike  
	spirits, they can be absorbed by their creator at any point without  
	having to spend the Garmonbozia to to dissolve them. 

	12_Cooperation:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		It is possible for multiple lodge spirits to work together to  
	create an artifact or spirit which is linked to the both (or all) of  
	them.  Such spirits may be dissolved or absorbed by either without  
	requiring the permission of either (But the lodge must still think  
	their actions are in its best interest though). 

	13_Additional Supernatural Powers:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		I don't have time to work out additional powers for the Black  
	Lodgers, but I can list some already existing powers in the books  
	which can easily be appropriated for the Lodge Spirits and their  
	artifacts. The use of any of the following powers should each cost  
	the Black Lodger from one to five Garmonbozia points, depending on  
	the relative power of the ability, and the circumstances surrounding  
	it's use. Costs should be much lower while the spirit is actually  
	within the black lodge.
		From Vampire: the Masquerade :  
	
			All the auspex levels seem to fit with the style and  
	mood of Twin peaks, with the exception perhaps of level 5, but even  
	that could be made to fit. 

			Presence level 1 works nicely, yet unreliably.

			All the dominate levels work well, with one small  
	change. Rather than requiring eye-contact, they require that the  
	spirit who is using them be focused on "seducing" the specific  
	individual on whom the powers are useable. 

			Animalism MIGHT be okay, as these are amerindian  
	nature spirits, sort of, but only if that were the focus of the  
	spirit using it. 

			Obfuscate: A definite yes. What more can I say? 

		From the Storyteller's Handbook:

			Visceratika: the levels which let you sense the  
	movements of everyone in the same building as yourself might work.  
	[The Fan could always tell when Laura was home...]

			Sanguinus might be allowable between a "parent"  
	spirit and it's "children",  but I'd be wary here as a ST, using this  
	might just make the Black Lodgers seem combat-oriented, which is NOT  
	what they are, most of them don't even have true physical forms  
	outside of the lodge. 

		From the Player's Guide: 

			The setite powers of corruption are also definite  
	yes's, but not the stuff about the tongues and turning into snakes.

			Necromancy might work too, with the Black Lodgers  
	being able to call upon the souls of those they've seduced and  
	corrupted in the past.  [I'd hate to meet the ghost of Windam  
	Earle].But still, I don't think the flavor is right on this one. 

			Some of the really high levels of the conventional  
	disciplines seem workable too, but I'd have to say no, you need to  
	give the Cainites a few advantages (at least, you do if you're not  
	considering the black lodge to be the source of the beast) over their 	 
	non-corporeal brethren.

		From the Player's Guide to the Sabbat:

			Dementation, the power owned by the Malkavian  
	Antitribu: This is THE key power of the Black Lodgers, without the  
	ability to drive people mad, they really aren't worth using. My only  
	regret is that white wolf didn't include this power in the original  
	rule-book. 

			Vicissitude: One could make a VERY good case for  
	level one of this power. 

			Obtenebration (?) : Another good one. [and great for  
	explaining why Leland and the girls were lit by a flashlight when  
	they made the run to the train car. And don't tell me that Phillip  
	Gerard was holding the flash light, because he was still back at the  
	cabin during the scene in question]. 

		From Werewolf: the Apocalypse :
			Okay, I admit it. Sorry Sam, but I don't play W:tA  
	often enough to have many of the gifts memorized.  But I'm sure that  
	many of them are more than appropriate to the Black Lodge, such as  
	ones controlling the terrain, or driving off animals, or for sensing  
	the wyrm and things of that nature. I'll have to leaf thru the book  
	again.
			I know there are rules for wyrm bane's possessing  
	individuals in the book, but I haven't read them in a while. If I'm  
	not mistaken, I think their rules for fast take-overs, which is  
	definitely NOT in the spirit of Twin Peaks.  It took YEARS for Bob to  
	get the kind of hold he did over Leland, and about six more to get  
	the hold he did over Laura. Twin Peaks is about destiny, timelessness  
	and lethargic evil, not about last second rescues and disposable  
	badguys. [OK, yes, Windam Earle DID believe in disposable badguys,  
	but not in thump...he's a puppet. Okay, you kill him, so I possess  
	the guy standing next to him. You kill him, so I get the guy on the  
	corner. That's just not Twin Peaks IMHO] Cooper would like it to be  
	about last second rescues...

	14_A real short statement about the motives and mental states of the  
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Black Lodge Spirits:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Black Lodgers are not neccesarily evil. In the same sense  
	that Sabbat are not neccesarilly evil.  The quick and easiest (and  
	shortest) description I could come up with for Black Lodge Spirits  
	personality is this:    They're just like Malkavian Antitribu except  
	that instead of bluntly sucking the blood out of people, they instead  
	go the more subtle route of wearing down their victims humanity and  
	feeding off of the sadness and pain this causes. They aren't evil,  
	just....sick.       :)

		"Do you know WHO that is!?!??!!!!?"
			-FBI Agent Phillip Jeffries to Director Gordon Cole,
				talking about Agent Cooper, 

					because Jeffries could see that 
					Bob was destined to possess Cooper.

		In the tv show, we see at least half a dozen Black Lodge  
	spirits. First, we see Bob, then Phillip Gerard/The One Armed Man,  
	then Mike/The Little Man From Another Place, then we hear about Mrs.  
	Tremond, then we discover that The Giant (Who until that point I had  
	assumed was an angel) is really not only A: a black lodger, but allso  
	B: another incarnation of The Little Man From Another Place. 

		Then, we go to the movie, where we see all of the above (save  
	The Giant), plus a couple of woodsmen, and a little boy behind a  
	mask, and a strange little critter which seems to be a weird  
	Mike-like thing with a face like the little boy's mask and lastly we  
	get to see Mrs. Tremond, who allso goes by the name Chalfont. Lot's  
	and lots of these Black Lodgers, right? I thought so at first too,  
	but I was wrong.
		The little man says  "Do you know who I am? I am the arm."   
	Whoa. This took me at first.  Then I thought "So, Mike is Phillip  
	Gerard's arm, and it seems that Mrs. Chalfont's Grandson is sort of  
	like Leland trapped at the age/moment in which Bob first seduced him.   
	And the little dancing guy in the corner of the convenience store  
	looks like Mike with a face made out of Mrs. Tremond's Grandson's  
	mask, implying that he's a link between Mike and Bob/Chalfont. Then  
	Bob throws up his arms and it forces that little guy back into the  
	corner, a certain sign that Bob would destroy this link if he could,  
	and of course Bob was obviously the owl or linked to the owl, and we  
	know the doppleganger was really..."     Well, I started to think too  
	fast for words, and this is what I came up with:
	
		To really stew it all down, there is only ONE lodge spirit.  
	Only one. It has the ability however to divide itself into lesser  
	incarnations, more specialized ones. 

		I'll attempt to trace a genealogy of the spirits shown in the  
	tv show and movie: We start with the lodge. The lodge for some reason  
	splits itself into at least two persona's. One is Mike, and at least  
	one of the others is Bob. They are all linked in a web. Between them  
	they form lesser spirits which bridge the gaps in personality. They  
	continue on thru physical-world time, possessing humans, feeding off  
	their pain, and dragging them into the lodge to use as the basis for  
	the creation of more lodge spirits. Bob takes over Leland Palmer,  
	creating a new spirit in the form os Leland locked in the age he was  
	possessed at but wearing a mask. Time passes in the physical world.  
	Then an FBI special operative by the name of Phillip Jeffries is able  
	to willingly enter the lodge somehow, exerting his will over a part  
	of it. He affects Mike, changing him forever, and in the process so  
	changed is Jeffries. Mike is able cast off the wyrm influence from  
	himself. He takes a bit of Jeffries life force, and uses it to  
	construct for himself a body which is able to enter the physical  
	world. He names this body Phillip Gerard (the one armed man), and  
	locks humanity into thru the weaver. He splits himself off into  
	several more parts, one known as the The Little Man From Another  
	Place which houses wisdom locked by the wyld. Another houses madness  
	locked by the wyrm. Bob is revolted by this, and so destroys the  
	connection spirit between himself and Mike. However, Mike has by this  
	time created another spirit (In the form of a hyperactive version of  
	The Little Man with a face which completely resembles the mask that  
	Mrs. Tremond's grandson wore) to house his madness, and links this  
	spirit onto Mrs. Tremond/Chalfont's grandson.  Bob is not directly  
	linked to this little dancing critter, so he can't destroy it without  
	first destroying Mrs. Chalfont's Grandson, and doing that would cost  
	him his control of Leland (and, since the black lodge exists beyond  
	time, he would know that it would prevent him from getting Laura,  
	Dale, Annie, Windam Earle, and Chet Desmond too, altogether too  
	costly). So Bob has to live with this connection, and thru it, Mike  
	is able to syphon off  some of Bob's influence and Garmonbozia,  
	thereby slowing Bob's efforts to consume both Leland and Laura. Not a  
	perfect fix, but worth attempting anyway in Mike's opinion.  So Bob  
	burnt some Garmonbozia forming Teresa Banks' ring, because he figured  
	it would bring him enough Garmonbozia to make up for the amount he  
	had to spend on it.  He allso created a spirit form of himself linked  
	to the fan in the Plamer household so that he could talk to Laura  
	when Leland wasn't home. Mike saw that he wasn't stopping Bob, and so  
	formed himself into The Giant to try to warn Cooper off, [but in his  
	madness (?) he was unable to tell Cooper straight out what was  
	happening].  Bob was wary of this though, and so formed himself  The  
	Owl to be able to keep an eye on Cooper.

		1_PRELUDE:

		This is the senario, played on Sundays evenings, during
	the Lent term 1993, by me as ST and all the play testers.
		It is based on the idea that a Lasombra antitribu is hunting
	down all of his children, and children's childrens...etc. He happends
	to be a member of the Inconnu, so he cannot hunt them down directly,
	BUT he can use other vampires to do it for him: the players!!!!!
	Even if he follows the path of Honorable accord, he senses the 
	corruption of the Black Lodge and has brolen  his word of 
	non-interferance!

		2_ ENTER THE CHARACTERS:

		After being introduced to the Prince; each player will dream
	the following dream, and recieve an invitation to dine signed
	The Duke of Provence (he is Corwin). The dream is :

		"White hands are playing with some cards, making a castle
		with them. All the cards are blank. On the other side
		there is a red "S" and a "C" (Sabbat/Camarilla) on a
		black background, separated by a white line. Then the hand
		take one card of the castle, and all falls...."

		When they will go to the address, the next night, the Duke will 
	explain what he wants of them, and will give them a pack of cards:
	it has 32 cards, 5 like the carracter in a medieval costume (whatever
	suits him the best: knight/paysant/noble/magician...). Another card
	has a picture of a street in Paris, near the Eiffel Tower. The name is 
	Vincent! (NOT the Brujah, the Lasombra). Corwin will be pleased to
	swap cards....see after. The Duke (Corwin) wants the players to kill
	Vincent (he doesn't care about the rest of the pack) BUT he will
	not give them any help (the cards are powerful enough) nor will
	he fight along side them. He is from the Inconnu, and has sworn
	not to get involved in Kindred and Kine affairs (which he is doing, but
	he is covering for it... and the Lodge infuences him as well).

	The Cards are a powerful artefacts: If some blood is put on a card
	where there is a picture of a place, the user; by spending a willpower
	point; can "jump" into the place represented by the picture. If
	the user has a card of another person, and some his/her blood
	on the card; she/he can speak to the person; if and 
	only if, this person has a card of the caller, with some of its
	blood on it. The caller (or reciever) can "jump" into the place the
	other is (by spending a willpower point) providing that they hold
	their hands. (ie if one of them doesn't want the other to "jump"
	then, he/she cannot jump!!!). These are borrowed from the Amber
	Chronicles by Zelazy. The cards might have other powers, but it
	is up to the ST to decide, as he wish (as long as it fits the plot)
	Do not foget that Corwin gave his world that the cards are not 
	dangerous per se, and that he is following the path of honerable 
	accord. 
		If you think that the cards are too powerful, just say that,
	at the end of the story: You wake up and feel realy worried about 
	that strange dream of yours....Cards, which cards? (dominate
	is a Lasombra clan discipline, and Morphus ways gives a nice control
	other the dreams.....).
		The players will have no lead whatsoever to start with;
	so it is up to them to find a way to find this Vincent.

		3_ENTER THE RAVNOS.

		In the mean time, a Caitif, wanting to join the Ravnos clan
	is trying to steal something from the Louvre, as a proof of his
	"ability" (he is in fact a Ravnos, but doesn't know his Sire, so
	he assumes he is Caitif). A blood hunt will be ordered, and the 
	players should suspect the Sabbat. You can leave some leads as to
	where to find the Ravnos, as a letter in Gypies Cant (posted
	sometime ago on the list). The idea is to get the players to
	hunt him down, have his blood (or not, this is up to you.)
	If she/he does, he will be "badly" seen by vampire
	with a humanity of 6 or more. Make sure that the player
	gets some powers, but balance them with a derangement of
	cleptomania.... Ravnos blood bears a strange curse! Of course
	there will be all other (normal) effects for Diablerie...
	See "Diablerie Mexico" for details), and become famous in Paris 
	(status goes +1, unless already above 3 (ie 4 or more)).

		4_ENTER THE SABBAT.

		At that point, our friends from the Sabbat will appear,
	and guess who will be their targets???.... They will try to make
	the players join them (since they need more information 
	on Paris, and these guys are young/neonates vampires, so
	do your best to present the sabbat with a good face.)

		Their plan is very simple, try to give what the vampire
	want, and make him/her join a vinculum. It could be giving 
	a apprentice to a Nosferatu, political power to a Ventrue, 
	true freedom to a Brujah, new rituals for a Tremere....or anything 
	that your players might want/like. This is there to show the
	"good" side of the Sabbat, and to put a twisted plot into the 
	adventure... (imagine one of them joining the Sabbat, and 
	acting as a spy for them....). Will the players trade their
	humanity for power???...You never know!

		If all the players accept the deal, they will undergo the
	Ritual of Creation, and become true members of the Sabbat. BUT
	They will have to drink the other blood in a Vaulderie, with their 
	own; but the others won't drink theirs. (ie they will have a 
	rating of Vinculum towards the others, but the others won't have
	one towards them.

		If some acept to run with the Sabbat, let them plan an ambush 
	for their fellow ( and former) companions. (use both above and under
	options....).

		If none acept the deal, then the Sabbat will try to 
	kill them. They will lead them into their haven in the sewers
	and ambush them, with the help of some Black Spiral Dancers, 
	or alone (it is up to you). Their plan must leave NO way out
	for the players, they will be trapped with no way of escaping..
	(by a fire elemental, or something else up to your fiendish
	imagination!).

		5_THE LAST BATTLE.

		The Sabbat will think that the player cannot escape their 
	fate, and won't bother finding out if the players really died.
	It would be true, apart from the cards: One can jump out of the trap
	with a card, to the street in Paris (see above). The player will 
	then have to find a GOOD plan to get the Sabbat....Obviously,
	they cannot go in the places where they are known, nor to places
	where they hang around (ie Vampire Club, clubs, etc.). If they
	don't do it: then there will be a Wild Hunt on them, and they will 
	have a hard time!

		If their plan is good, then let the Sabbat fall in it: BIG
	fight and let destiny play its wild card!. If their plan is bad,
	then, use the Sabbat as more intelligent...

		6_NOTES.

		I didn't give a more precise line, because the players WON'T 
	follow it! You could make connections to other vampires in the city 
	all dead ends, but it will show more of Paris to your players. 
		If you want to use Corwin (as the Duc of Provence) for
	another hunt, or as a mentor for the players, feel free: He could
	always find a "job" for your players. "How about getting this 
	painting for me?" or "How about going all over the world and killing 
	Lasombra vampires?" or "Serve me as spies in Paris".....etc. Below is
	a list of "botches for hunting rolls" which seem to happend a lot
	in my game (for some strange reasons).

		*The vessel is a vampire, just take one from the above.

		*The vessel is a kine, with wonderful blood. It is so good
		that the player must made a conscience roll (diff 7), if he
		fails the vessel is drained...if not he will have taken 4 
		blood pool points, and the poor vessel is going to a party
		where he will drink a LOT (you can tell, because he got
		a bottle in his/hers jacket.).

		*The vessel is a magi, looking for a Tremere....

		*The vessel is watched by the police for a reson X.

		*The vessel is a carrier of the AIDS virus. (no offence 
		intended.)

		*The vessel will be found raped and killed the next day,
		She was a very good looking person.(no offence intended).

		*The vessel is the character's ward/retainer and there is
		a chance for frenzy (diff 6). If you are feeling in a bad mood.

		*The vessel is a lupine (either a Black Spiral Dancer, or 
		"good" one, or a ratkine, or any other garou you like....
		apart from a were-elephant...).

		*When feeding, a group of Sabbat vampires play a little 
		Gangbanging game.

		*The vessel is a undercover police officer on duty.

		*The vessel was already "used" that night, and has 6 Blood
		pool points.

		*The feeding is seen by a group of "teens", who want to serve 
		the kindred...Only problem, they will tell everybody about
		him/her; and will want to become one of the immortals....

		*The feeding is seen by a cop, and he wants to become a
		vampire.. (he is mad for power and will do anything to kill
		his sire, even diablerie....he read and loved The Vampire
		Chronicles....).

	6_T H E  T E S T A M E N T.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		(This is just an idea, it hasn't been played...).
		The Prince is living Paris, he is bored with it! He designs a 
	new Prince and leaves the city in a chaotic state!!!! The "heir" will
	be one of the players! The real story, is that Villon wants to see 
	who will obey him, and who are his enemies, hence a little "game" of
	his to make it clear who plots against him! Hope the "heir" has got
	guts........

		*Brujah: Let's create an anachic comunity, they plan an Anarch 
	uprising

		*Gangrel: The lady waits, feeling the trap.

		*Nosferatu: Panic on board!!!! Spyes are sent everywhere...

		*Malkavian: Benoit ask the players to become the Prince, since he
	is the leader of the Toreadors, and the city needs a Toreador Prince! 
	Mark will send a letter, asking him to become the first Malkavian Prince
	of Paris...

		*Toreadors: They want one of them in charge! and now!!!(this is
	a facade as they (the elders) all know the plan...since they are 
	blood bounded...).

		*Tremere: Back up and see what is happening, if they can create
	even more trouble, then ask for a Justicar!

		*Ventrue: It is our change...CHARGE!!!!

		*Sabbat: Let's have a gangbanging games, or maybe more!

		Now, when Villon sees who is ploting against him (or if the 
	situation becomes uncontrollable), he will get out of hiding and 
	plan to bring down his more important enemies! He will reward the 
	ex-Prince with allowing him to Sire a child, if the ex-Prince had a 
	brood (ie other players), he will grant them a boon! (but if they
	don't want to use it NOW, he will manage to find a way to reduce it.
	eg: by talking about them is good terms (status up) etc....).
