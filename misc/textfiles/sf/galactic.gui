The story of how the 12 colonies of man are destroyed after a 1000 year war
with the evil Cylon Empire.  Through deceit, the Cylons are able to destroy
the Colonies' entire fleet, except for the Battlestar Galactica, captained
by Commander Adama.  Adama gathers up the few remaining humans left on all
the twelve worlds and embarks on a journey to find the mythical planet
Earth, the supposed thirteenth colony of Mankind, lost ages ago when humans
first left the motherworld, Kobol.  With food and fuel running out, the
fleet heads for an ore planet, Carillon, hoping to get what it needs.  The
Ovions, who populate the planet, are being controlled by the Cylons, who
set a trap for the Galactica.  The fleet gets food and fuel, and escapes,
destroying Carillon and a Cylon Base Star.  [Originally, Baltar, who was
the human traitor responsible for mankind's defeat, is executed by the
Cylons.  But it was later decided that he survive to lead a Cylon fleet
against the Galactica.]

Apollo proposes to Serina, who he met in the pilot episode.  She is the
mother of Boxey.  Meanwhile, Boomer and Jolly, returning from an advanced
patrol, contract a disease and spread it to all the Viper pilots except
Starbuck and Apollo.  They discover a void in space, which Adama determines
to be the way to Kobol.  Apollo and Serina are married, a group of female
shuttle pilots (Serina included) fly a Viper expedition to get help for the
males, and the Galactica reaches Kobol.  The Cylons, lead by Baltar, find
the planet and destroy the pyramids of Kobol before Adama can find the
whereabouts of Earth.  Serina is killed, but the Galactica and fleet
escape.

become the gun-slinger for the evil LeCerta, who runs the town.  The
woman's husband, a colonial warrior who also had been marooned (popular
planet!)  had been killed by Red Eye, who thinks that LeCerta is Imperious
Leader.  Apollo challenges Red Eye to an Old West shootout.  Apollo wins,
and is rescued by the Galactica, leaving woman and son behind.

Starbuck is assigned to test a new ultra-fast Viper with a talking computer
named CORA and devoid of laser turrets.  While testing it, he meets a
bootlegger named Bootlegger who steals the Viper.  Starbuck is then
arrested by the Galactic Police of a prison planet.  All the prisoners are
the descendants of the original prisoners, who stay in jail and make
ambrosia.  Starbuck escapes and Apollo and Boomer fly by to fight off
attacking Cylon fighters.

Baltar attempts to lure the Galactica into range of a gigantic pulsar
cannon, which Adama becomes aware of.  Apollo and Starbuck lead a group of
convicts on a possible suicide mission to destroy the cannon, located on an
icy planet.  They join forces with a society of clones enslaved by the
Cylons and destroy the cannon.

The Magnificent Warriors
Air Date:  11/12/78
Writer:  Glen A. Larson
Director: Chris Nybe
Guest Cast:  Brett Somers, Barry Nelson, Eric Server, Dennis Fimple

A Cylon attack destroys most of the fleet's food supply.  The Galactica
finds a rural planet to trade for grain, but Adama must put up with a
lovesick old acquaintance who has the equipment.  However, the people of
the town they go to (Serenity) are being plagued by the Borays, a group of
pig-like marauders (resembling Tellurites).  Starbuck is conned into being
their sheriff, an occupation which has a short life span.  The Borays
kidnap Adama's girlfriend?  and the Galacticans rescue her, making a deal
with the Borays.  (Their leader becomes the new sheriff.)

The Young Lords
Air Date:  11/19/78  
Writers:  Don Bellisario, Frank Lupo, Paul Playdon
Direcotr: Don Bellisario
Guest Cast:  Bruce Glover, Charles Bloom, Audrey Landers, Brigitte Muller,
             Adam Man

Starbuck crashes on the planet Trillion (sorry Apollo, it's his turn) where
the Cylons have destroyed all the humans except for a band of children who
have become warriors to save their enslaved father.  At first, the oldest
boy, their leader, wants to trade Starbuck for their father.  But Starbuck
convinces them to go along with a scheme of his, and they rescue the
children's father.  Then Apollo and Boomer come to rescue Starbuck.  (Sound
familiar?  Poor Boomer never gets to be marooned.)

The Living Legend
Air Dates:  Part I--11/26/78  Part II--12/3/78  
Writer:  Glen A. Larson
Director: Vince Edwards
Guest Cast:  Lloyd Bridges, Rod Haase, Junero Jennings

Apollo and Starbuck, while on patrol, encounter the supposedly lost
Battlestar Pegasus, commanded by the living legend, Commander Cain.  Cain
insists that the two battlestars join forces to crush the Cylon Empire, or
more notably, the planet Gamoray to begin with.  Adama, however, fears that
the Cylons may attack the unprotected fleet while the battlestars are away.
Cain takes steps to assure his plans, and is relieved of duty.  The Cylons
do attack the fleet (with 3 Base Stars--as many as they used to destroy the
entire Colonies), and the Pegasus is pulled out to surprise the Cylons.
This works, and the fleet is saved.  Then they launch a surprise attack on
Gamoray while the Pegasus takes on the three Base Stars.  The Galactica
obtains fuel from Gamoray, but the Pegasus disappears after destroying two
of the Cylon ships.  Baltar, on board the third, narrowly escapes, and no
one is sure whether the Pegasus is destroyed, or has headed back out to the
stars.  [Arguably the best episode of the series.  Sheba joins the cast as
of this episode.]

Fire In Space
Air Date:  12/17/78  
Writers:  Jim Carlson, Terrence McDonnell
Director: Chris Nyby
Guest Cast:  William Bryant, Jeff MacKay

A Cylon kamikazee attack leaves the Galactica burning in space, with no way
to extinguish the blaze.  Furthermore, Adama is gravely injured.  Boomer,
Athena, and Boxey are also trapped inside the Rec Room.  Apollo and
Starbuck extinguish the fire by blowing holes in the ship, and Adama is
saved.  The people in the Recreation Room are saved by Muffy the Daggit.

War Of The Gods
Air Dates:  Part I--1/14/79  Part II--1/21/79  
Writer:  Glen A. Larson
Director: Dan Haller
Guest Cast: Patrick Macnee, Kirk Alyn, Bruce Wright, Paul Coufos, 
            John Williams

The fleet is plagued by a group of glowing lights that constantly fly pastd
them too fast to be followed.  Also, vipers keep disappearing whenever they
follow the lights.  On a mission to find the men, Apollo, Starbuck, and
Sheba find a desolate planet, and the remains of a ship wreck.  There they
find Count Iblis, who claims to be, if not a deity, then the next best
thing.  His mysterious powers sway the fleet, as he promises to deliver
them if they will follow him.  Adama doubts Iblis' word, but gives him the
task of delivering the traitor Baltar, which he does.  Everyone is ready to
follow Iblis, but Adama and Apollo soon realize that Iblis is really the
Prince of Darkness and that those 'lights' are after him.  In a final
battle, Iblis kills Apollo, then is taken away for killing someone who
hasn't given himself freely.  Starbuck and Sheba, while bringing Apollo's
body back, are captured by the lights, who reveal themselves to be the good
version of Iblis' type.  They resurrect Apollo, and give the Galacticans
the coordinates for Earth.  [Baltar, at one point, realizes that Iblis'
voice is that of Imperious Leader, ruler of the Cylons, which Iblis doesn't
deny.  Baltar is then placed on board the Prison Barge.]
        
The Man With Nine Lives
Air Date:  1/28/79
Writer:  Don Bellisario
Direcotr: Rod Holcomb
Guest Cast:  Fred Astaire, Anne Jeffreys, Lance LeGault, Robert Feero

An old con man, Chameleon, is running from a trio of bloodthirsty
Borellians (Klingon-like villains) when he meets Starbuck.  To gain refuge
on the Galactica, he convinces Starbuck that he is his long-lost father.
He is brought on board to confirm the story, and the Borellians get on
board by joining the Viper pilot training program (The Colonial Fleet needs
YOU!).  The Borellians are captured and put on board the Prison Barge, and
Chameleon admits to his con and leaves.  Cassiopea tells him that he really
is Starbuck's father, but no one ever tells.

Murder On The Rising Star
Air Date:  2/18/79
Writer:  Don Bellisario, James Carlson, Terrance McDonnell
Director: Rod Holcomb
Guest Cast:  Frank Ashmore, Luman Ward, Brock Peters, Patricia Stich, W.K.
             Stratton

Ortega, Starbuck's rival in the popular sport Triad (a somewhat cross
between handball and basketball) is murdered, and all the evidence points
to Starbuck.  Apollo is about the only one who believes Starbuck, and sets
out to find the real killer.  With Baltar's help, it is discovered that
Ortega was blackmailing a man who had taken bribes to let people on board
his ship during the exodus from the Colonies.  This man killed Ortega, and
is captured when he attempts to kill Baltar, the only other man who can
identify him.

Greetings From Earth
(Two hour special)  Air Date:  2/25/79  
Writer:  Glen A. Larson
Director: Ahmet Lateef
Guest Cast:  Randy Mantooth, Bobby Van, Ray Bolger, Kelly Harmon, 
             LLoyd Bochner

Apollo and Starbuck find a primitive sleeper ship carrying a man, a woman,
and four children.  It is taken aboard, and is believed to be from Earth.
The council wants to open the ship, even though it might kill the
inhabitants.  Adama will not allow this.  Dr. Wilker and Dr. Salik discover
that the inhabitants cannot survive in their atmosphere.  Apollo, Starbuck,
and Cassiopea steal the ship, and continue with it to it's destination,
Paradeen.  The male, Michael, informs the Galacticans that they are
originally from Terra, but have fled the war with the Eastern Alliance (an
evil government), who are killing the democracy-type people.  An Eastern
Alliance ship follows the sleeper ship and captures the party.  However,
the Galacticans are able to then capture the Alliance men, and take them
back to the fleet in their own ship, and imprison them on the Prison Barge.
The fleet then continues on to Terra, gaining the location from Michael.
[A classic scene is when the Alliance Commander, bragging about his
invincible Empire, first sees the Galactica, bigger than any ship he has
ever scene.  His mouth dropping open says it all. Similar to when Baltar
first saw the Pegasus.]

Baltar's Escape
Air Date:  3/11/79  
Writer:  Don Bellisario
Director: Rick Kolbe
Guest Cast:  Ina Bolin, LLoyd Bochner, Lance LeGault, Robert Feero, Anthony
             DeLongis

Adama is besieged by the troublesome Siress Tinia, who is appointed by the
Council of Twelve to watch over him.  Meanwhile, Baltar plans his escape
with the help of the three Borellians and the Alliance Enforcers.  Thanks
to the Council's interference, hostages are taken, and Adama is forced to
give in.  Baltar is to escape in his fighter, along with his Centaurians,
while the rest go in the Alliance ship.  The Alliance ship is able to take
off, but Baltar's escape is foiled because the Centaurians had been
disassembled and, when put back together, didn't quite function up to par.

Experiment In Terra
Air Date:  3/18/79  
Writer:  Glen A. Larson
Director: Rod Holcomb
Guest Cast:  Edward Mulhare, Melody Anderson, Nehemiah Persoff, Ken
             Swofford 

Apollo and Starbuck follow the escaped Eastern Alliance ship back to Terra.
Before reaching it, they are picked up by the race of white lights that had
helped them against Count Iblis.  Their representative, John, asks Apollo
to help avert a war that would destroy Terra.  He is sent down, appearing
to all of the inhabitants as a man they had thought was dead.  He is unable
to convince anyone, and is thrown in prison.  Starbuck rescues him, and
they call the Galactica to try to help before Armageddon occurs.  The
President of the Western people has made a treaty with the Eastern
Alliance, in which all hostilities will stop.  However, the Eastern
Alliance is lying, and plans to strike when the guard is down.  Apollo
lectures the people of how his own race was tricked, and before anything
can be done, the Eastern Alliance fires its warheads.  The Galactica is
able to destroy all the bombs, and the frightened world powers open their
eyes and talk peace.  In return for their help, Michael tells Apollo that
Terra is not the Earth that they are searching for.

Take The Celestria
Air Date:  4/1/79
Writers:  James Carlson, Terrence McDonnell
Director: Dan Haller
Guest Cast:  Ana Alicia, Paul Fix, Nick Holt, Randy Stumpf, Richard Styles

Starbuck runs in to his long-lost love, Aurora, who is supposedly found to
be a traitor on board the Celestria.  It is discovered that the captain of
the Celestria, Kronus, runs the ship like a dictator, and Aurora and
friends are a liberation force.  It is learned that a junior officer is
really the one mistreating the crew, and that Kronus is only an iron-fisted
leader.  Apollo and Starbuck help defeat the evil members of the Celestria.

The Hand of God
Air Date:  4/29/79
Writer:  Don Bellisario
Director: Don Bellisario
Guest Cast: None

Tired of running from the Cylons, Adama decides to have it out for the last
time.  Using Baltar's ship, Apollo and Starbuck sneak on board the
following Base Star, and sabotage its scanners.  The Galactica then
destroys the Base Star, and Apollo and Starbuck are barely saved.

[This was the last episode, and it ended with an unattended scanner picking
up transmitions of an Earth Moon Mission.]
