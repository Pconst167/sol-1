it was posted by Todd Ogasawara. It is taken from a bio/biblio sent to him 
by Clarke.

     Arthur C. Clarke, B.Sc., F.R.A.S., F.R.S.A., F.B.I.S. was born at 
Minehead, Somerset in 1917 and educated at Huish's Grammar School, Taunton. 
He joined H.M. Exchequer & Audit Department in 1936, then served in the 
RAF. While running the prototype GCA (Ground Controlled Approach) radar, he 
developed the basic theory of Communication Satellites, and published it in 
1945.
 
     After demobilisation, he took First Class Honours in Physics and 
Mathematics at King's College, London, which later elected him Fellow. From 
1948 to 1950 he was Assistant Editor of Physics Abstracts at the 
Institution of Electrical Engineers. He was Chairman of the British 
Interplanetary Society 1946/7, 1950/3.
 
     Since 1954 his interest in underwater exploration has taken him to the 
Great Barrier Reef of Australia and the Indian Ocean, and he is now a 
director of the Colombo-based Underwater Safaris.
 
     He has published more than seventy books and made many appearances on 
Radio and TV, most notably with Walter Cronkite on CBS during the Apollo 
missions. His 13-part "Mysterious World" and "Strange Powers" TV programmes 
have been seen worldwide.
 
     He is a Council Member of the Society of Authors, a Vice-President of 
the H. G. Wells Society and a member of many other Scientific and Literary 
Organisations. His honours include several Doctorates in science and 
literature, a Franklin Institute Gold medal, The Marconi Fellowship, the 
Charles A Lindbergh Award, the UNESCO-Kalinga Prize, and an Oscar 
Nomination for the Screenplay of 2001: A Space Odyssey. In 1987 he was 
invited to New Delhi to deliver the Nehru Memorial Lecture, under the 
chairmanship of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He has also been Vikram 
Sarabhai Professor at the Physical Research Laboratories, Ahmedabad.
 
     His recreations include observing the Equatorial skies with a 14" 
telescope, table-tennis, diving, and playing with his Rhodesian Ridgeback 
and his six computers.
 
     He has lived in Sri Lanka for the past 30 years, and in 1979.  
President Jayewardene appointed him Chancellor of the University of 
Moratuwa, near Colombo, which is also the location of the government-
established Arthur Clarke Centre for Modern Technologies, specialising in 
communications and computers.
