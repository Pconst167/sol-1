This is a monthly posting that is posted on or about the 15th of each
month.

This list is from the Rocky Horror fan club and from people that
E-Mailed me.  Since I didn't go to all of these theaters, I cannot
guarantee their accuracy.  Entries marked with `*' have more information
about them at the end of the list.  Entries marked with `!' are
temporary.  Some of these entries have been slightly edited (mostly for
conciseness) from the original message sent to me, but the content is
the same.  Also note that this is the official list of the Rocky Horror Fan
Club.  (Thanks to all the people that helped make it that!)

I have recently changed colleges and I'm sorry if any additions got lost
in the shuffle.

Many periodic postings, including this one, are available on the archive

---------END OF LIST---------


These comments are not mine (mostly) but of some of the readers of
alt.cult-movies.rocky-horror


The Loft Cinema - Tucson, AZ
 Sat, Midnight, $4.50
 Comments: Huge theater, big screen, new film. Audience mostly high
  school and college students. Some cast members have an awful sense of
  timing. Virgins are married before sacrificed. (We have morals... NOT
  :)

Rialto - So. Pasadena, CA
 Sat, Midnight, runs about 8 months per year
 Comments: This place is in the National Registry of Historical
  Landmarks.  It is one of the few remaining original vaudville
  theatres, complete with orchestra pit, bizarre pseudo-Egyptian decore,
  and gaudy paint.  The balcony is usually closed.  You might recognize
  it, because it has been used in _many_ motion pictures.  I recall at
  least Kentucky Fried Movie being filmed there.  It has been several
  years since I saw Rocky Horror there, but they still line up every
  Saturday.
 Comments: "The Player" is the best known most recent film which takes
  place at the Rialto.
  
Varsity Theatre - Palo Alto, CA
 Sat, Midnight, $6.75; $3.75 if in RHPS costume.
 Phone: 415-323-6411 (program info recording)
	415-323-6431 (box office)
 Comments: A very large (~800 seat?) vintage theatre with a full
  stage.  The cast, Erotic Nightmares, just celebrated its 6th
  anniversary.

SouthBay Galleria General Cinemas - Redondo Beach, CA
 Cast: "Tonight's Menu", Cinema 3 at midnight on Saturday (or thereabouts)
 Cost: $5, Props: Everything except rice, tortillas, and open flame.
 Directions: 405 to Hawthorne Blvd. Theatre is nestled beside a mall
  (The Galleria) between Artesia and 182nd about a mile SouthWest of the
  freeway on Hawthorne.
 Comments: The theatre is a large commercial (500 seat) theatre with no
  atmosphere, but the cast makes every attempt to get the audience in
  the "Rocky" mood.  A stage is set up in the front of the theatre and
  professional lighting is used to illuminate the actors.  Prior to the
  show is what has been described as "one of the most continuously
  original pre-shows ever done" where virgins are sacrificed in
  different ways each week.  There is usually a social smoke-fest in the
  lobby where regulars tend to ignore long stretches of the movie.  The
  cast is open and very friendly with the audience. "Tonight's Menu" is
  3 years old.

UC Berkeley - Berkeley, CA
 Sat, Midnight, $6.00
 Comments: It's about 5 blocks below UCB.  The cast is excellent and it
  is considered the best cast in the country (so say the fan club in
  NY).	We have official virgin hunters outside the theater before the
  show.  The virgins are marked with "V" or "Fuck Me" in lipstick on
  their faces so that they can be easily identified by those with rice
  and other projectiles.  We also have Super Heroes in the uncut version
  of the film. We also show shorts or music videos before the main
  feature.  Sometimes the cast isn't there, but we have a good time
  anyway.  About four times a year we have lengerie night complete with
  a competition for the best outfit.  Other goofy things are known to
  happen, like last night when the entire cast was dressed as Star Trek
  characters who had been forced to play out the roles of RH. Our next
  lengerie night is tentatively scheduled for early July.
 Comments: Berkeley has been running the longest of them all..

Camera One - San Jose, CA
 Sat, Midnight
 Phone: 408-294-3800

Palace - Montreal, Canada
 St. Catherine St. W.

Flatiron - Boulder, CO
 Every other week (?)
 Phone:  303-442-1944.
 Comments: The theater is at the corner of 13th Street and College, just
  one block from the CU-Boulder campus.  It seems to show only every two
  weeks.  The cast is called Deep Throat Nine, and they are a crazy
  bunch:  they yell backa t the audience and throw things at them,
  including a two-quart pitcher of water in the water-cooler scene in
  Sweet Transvestite. Before the show are cast-lead cheers and songs and
  jokes.  No Super Heroes. A lot less structure than the show at
  Berkeley CA.

????? - Ft. Collins, CO
 Comments: The cast "The Rocky Whores" is organized by the Rocky Horror
  society at Colorado State University.  for the last 2 years, the cast
  has been able to convince the Aggie Theater (I don't remember the
  address) to allow limited showings once or twice a semester, usually
  3-4 shows over a weekend shows will no longer be done at the Aggie
  since new seats were installed over the summer.  the Rocky Horror
  society is now trying play the show at the CSU Lory Student Center
  Theater. the the cast is comprised of Rocky Horror society members as
  well as members of Boulder's Deep Throat 9 cast.  the show is
  basically the same as the one in boulder, except for the print and a
  few props and pre-show activities. the Rocky Whores have had a Super
  Heroes print. additional props include a tank, and a 7 foot stuffed
  gorrilla during the floor show. pre-show contests include "lets fake
  an orgasm" and "lets fake oral sex". other than this, the show is
  similar to any other. the audience usually contains more virgins than
  veterans, but that is fun as well.

York Square - New Haven, CT
 Fri & Sat, 11:30, $5.50 - Comes and goes, usually stays for several
			   weeks at a time.
 Comments: They usually search you for props.  Current reels are heavily
  damaged.

Northlake 8 - Atlanta, GA
 Comments: If you are looking for a really professional cast, might I
  suggest the Northlake 8 in Atlanta. The cast really does a good job
  (and, I played Brad/Riff/Magenta there for a year prior to moving to
  Gainesville).   The Northlake 8 is a great theater! For directions,
  just take I-75 to Northlake Drive and head east.   You cannot miss the
  Mall, it is on the right side of Northlake Drive, and the AMC is near
  Toys-R-Us.  Tell them Tom Servo sent ya!   Ask for Kim McFarland, she
  is the area Rep of the Nat'l Fan Club, as well as a teriffic Frank!

The Wave - Honolulu, HI
 Last Saturday of the month, 8:00pm, *FREE*
 Comments: Here is a great deal for any Rocky fan if they are planning a
  trip to Hawaii.  If you are in town on the last Saturday of the month
  a club called "The Wave" plays the movie for free.  The only problem
  with this showing is that there is no cast to speak of, and that the
  show begins at 8:00 p.m. or there about.  There are us few regulars
  that go almost every month and we are starting to get more to come to
  the show.  Who knows we might get a cast on of these days.

Henenway Theater - University of Hawaii Manoa campus, HI
 Saturday at midnight, $4.00

Greenbriar Theater - Indianapolis, IN
 Sat. Midnight $4.00
 Comments:  We are an up-and-comming cast that has been around for a
  while but is just now getting up on our feet.  If you have just come
  to Indiana for college or whatever and are looking for a regular
  Rocky, we can use some dedicated cast members.  We get wild and out of
  control, but hey, it's Rocky Horror and it is a hell of a time.  To
  get to Greenbriar, take the northern leg of I465, take the Meridian
  street exit and go south and then turn right onto 86th street and go
  for several blocks until you get to 86th and Ditch.

Fine Arts Theatre - Kansas City, KS
 Fri & Sat, 11:30 PM, $4.00
 Phone: 913-262-4466

Harvard Square - Cambridge, MA
 Midnight on Fri and Sat, $6.75
 Comments: Across the street from Harvard.

Southside Marketplace - Baltimore, MD
 Fri & Sat
 Comments: Highly recommended
 Comments: [this is] TERRIBLE. It certainly is *NOT* a must see and I
  tried them out several times. It was ok at the other theater, but this
  show is horrible.

Uptown - Minneapolis, MN
 Fri & Sat, Midnight
 Comments: I saw the RHPS there many times growing up: The Uptown is a
  relatively small theatre with great atmo.  Don't try to sneak in
  alcohol or too much rice, they frisk you at the door. Their motto:
  "Drink it before you get here."  The cast is good, the crowd is odd,
  as usual, and the people are relatively friendly, if messed up.

Cinema 35 - Paramus, NJ
 Fri & Sat, Midnight, $5.00
 Comments: Our cast went to the Rocky Horror mini convention in
  Washington DC on April 24th. Out of the six of us who went, three of
  us pulled first places in the costume contest. Out of all the other
  theatres represented there we were told by all of them that we had the
  loudest most enthusiastic Rocky crew any of them had ever seen. Even
  Sal heard some lines he never heard before. Our lines are always up to
  date. On that weekend we had some David Koresh lines strewn about by
  us. Our theatre allows most things except it only allows cast members
  and the five transylvanians we haqve to go up to the first few rows of
  the theatre and up to the screen. THere are no open flames permited in
  our theatre (well except for mike but hes okay) so the lighter scene
  is done with flashlights. We are allowed to throw just about anything.
  New lines are always welcome. The only problem with our theatre is
  that our film is falling apart. The entire dinner scene is cut from
  when Frank turns off the magnet until Eddies Teddy begins. During the
  wedding scene a huge blue line runs accross the screen back an forth.
  Its cool sometimes because every so often our film's mess ups lead to
  new lines. We are currently in the process of getting a new film fron
  TC Fox.

Harwan - Mt. Ephraim, NJ
 Saturday, midnight, $5.00
 Comments: I am a member of the Transducer Players from the Harwan
  Theater in Mount Ephraim, NJ.  We are one of the oldest casts in the
  country.  We are also the only cast in South Jersey. The Transducer
  Players are pictures on pages 120-121 of Sal's 15th anniversary book,
  as well as pictured on the back cover with the eastside cinema cast.
  (That was just after they lost the 8th street playhouse in the
  village.) We haven't had Friday night shows in over two years.  Thank
  the econnomy for that.  What we do have are shows EVERY saturday night
  at midnight, admition is still only $5.00.  The theater itself is a
  single screen, 640 seat theater complete with stage.	It's actually an
  old vaudville theater.  An average show is 200-250 people.  We sell
  out every weekend in october.
  --
  Our important show is undoubtably Halloween, and we put on the best
  show anywere.  But this year on October 16th, Sal Piro himself is
  going to visit. Sal will host the show, as well as sell stuff.  (Ever
  meet him?  Ya know how he is...)  I wanted you to be aware of that.

Brook Theatre - Bound Brook, NJ
 Comments: The Brook Theatre on Hamiltong Street in Bound Brook, NJ shows Rocky
  Horror on Friday and Saturday nights.  [ed: They have a cast, I met
  some of them at Age of Consent :) ]
  
Cinema Classics - Redbank, NJ
 Saturdays

Torrey Pines Cinema - Las Vegas, NV
 Fri-Sat, ca. Midnight, $3.50
 Comments: Cast, virgin ceremonies, the usual (?). No Super Heroes.
  Torrey Pines also runs Heavy Metal, Sid and Nancy, animation, anime,
  other midnight-type movies on the same schedule. (93 May 14)

Amherst - Buffalo, NY
 Comments: Has cancelled Rocky for summer BUT it will be back up the
  last week of August,approximately.. Most of our cast has been going to
  see it at the StoneRidge , in Rochester..:)
 Comments: Rocky will be back at the Amherst as of Aug 28,hopefully..

Lockport Mall - Buffalo, NY
 Price: $5.50
 Comments: The crowds are small and the cast is sporadic..but it's fun!!
  It is off of Transit Rd.,FYI

Movieland 8th Street - New York, NY
 Price - $7.50	(Just like most New York City movies...Yuck)
 Every Friday and Saturday night
 Comments: Rocky is still going strong in New York City at Movieland, on
  8th St. (Just 1 block from the now closed 8th St. Playhouse). While
  the cast is constantly changing, there are a few regulars, including
  several people who date back to the Playhouse, and even the Waverly,
  before that.	Rice isn't allowed, but lighters, and noisemakers are.
  In fact, they are sold by the cast for people who forgot to bring
  props.  Virgins are sacrificed, sometimes (when time, and the
  projectionist allow) we have a few pre-show numbers.	We have
  Superheroes.	After the show the cast (and as many people as we can
  drag with us) usually go to Polyesthers (A 70's theme bar with Rocky
  in the Jukebox).  They love us.  We usually go in costume, and they
  put Rocky on the TV when we get there.

Cinema East - Nyack, NY
 Comments: I enjoyed this theater.  went there twice.  they have a pink
  panther short at the beginning, and (when i was there) a good cast.
  mostly the same lines as 8th street playhouse.

Jo-Mor's Stoneridge Theater - Rochester, NY
 Fri & Sat, midnight, $5.00
 Comments:  I am a former member of the cast that performs here, "Sweet
  Temptations".  When I left, the show had deteriorated to the point of
  being just not fun anymore--obnoxious management, random horsing
  around while in costume, etc.  However, the cast finally saw the low
  attendance which resulted from this, and is now trying to get serious
  and rebuild itself.  I'm always willing to give second chances when
  they're due...so go check 'em out, and give them some well-needed
  encouragement.
 Comments: I'm a current member of the cast.  It's fairly open, and
  we're always trying to recruit new cast members.  We enjoy good
  relations with management, the cast and regulars regularly hang out
  together (after the show, and otherwise), and we interact strongly
  with our audiences.

Cedar Lee - Cleveland Heights, OH
 Sat, midnight, $6.50
 Address
  2163 Lee Road
  Cleveland Heights, OH 44118
 Phone	+1-216-321-5411
	(Show information) +1-216-321-8232
 Comments: There is a good show here. People that saw it in other
  theaters say that this is very good. There is a fine cast and good
  managment. This is where the editor of this list goes.

Graceland - Columbus, OH
 Fri & Sat, Midnight, $4.00
 (614) 888-3523
 Comments: The Rocky Horror Picture Show is playing at the Graceland
  Twin Cinema in Columbus, Ohio at the Graceland shopping Center off of
  High Street.	It plays both Friday and Saturday nights at midnight (of
  course) with a live cast both nights (two members of which are writing
  this message). Price of admission is $4.00, though the cast does get
  in for free.	If you have any questions, call the theatre at (614)
  888-3523 and ask for Brian, Mae, or Wendy.  If you have any virgins
  amongst you, ask for Brian, he'll take care of them. P.S. only rice is
  allowed for audience props! and no fucking rice at the cast!!!

Clinton Street - Portland, OR
 Sat, $4.00 with cast, $3.50 without
 Comments: Shows run every Saterday night with the Caberiet performing
  about every other weekend. It has been showing RHPS for almost 17
  years which I believe makes it the longest running show in the US.
  Audience varies, tends to be louder on cast nights, but good. There
  are often theme nights, last night, for example was "Fuck with your
  character night" The one con is that you are considered a virgin if
  you have never seen RHPS at Clinton Street. Overall it's lots of fun.

Lehigh - Allentown, PA
 Fri & Sat, Midnight, $5.50
 Comments: Name of the cast is "Sins of the Flesh" out of Bethlehem, PA.
  Excellent cast, all ages and skill levels.  Has been known to perform
  RHPS at more than one location at the same night.  (ie  enuff talented
  cast for two complete performances.)

The Hollywood Theater - Pittsburgh, PA
 Sat, midnight, $3.00
 Comments: They have a performance cast. They also show TWO Tim Curry
  Videos before Rocky starts, Paradice Garage and I do the Rock. They
  are the only place in the Pitsburgh area that has the current rights.
  You are allowed all standard props except WATER. we also have a brand
  new Print of it and it looks GREAT!
 Comments: Not only that, but it *does* contain the entire "Super
  Heroes"--only time in 10+ years of viewing in both SoCal and
  Pittsburgh I have ever seen that scene.

Meadowbrook Cinema - Warwick, RI
 Fri & Sat, midnight, $5.00
 Cast:	Creatures of the Night
 Comments:  The management of this theater is REALLY obnoxious...he
  doesn't allow any religious comments, the house lights are up during
  the show so the security can force people to stay in their seats
  (except for the Time Warp, of course), the audience has to sign a
  WAIVER before buying tickets, etc.). In February of 1993, the original
  cast had a huge fallout with said management, and left the theater.
  The current cast has been assembled by management.  They haven't been
  around long enough to develop much of the petty politics that are
  associated with some casts, and so they can concentrate more on the
  show. Personally, I don't recommend this theater, but if you're in the
  neighborhood....  The original cast is now at the Jane Pickens
  Theater.
 Comments: [this] is a great show for anyone not involved in the petty
  politics which are associated with some RHPS casts.  All they did was
  get rid of some of the trouble makers and still have a great cast.  It
  sounds like sour grapes in [this] list.

Jane Pickens Theater - Newport, RI
 Will run Fri. & Sat. as long as attendance is good; may be just Sat. in winter
 Cast:	Absolute Pleasure Players
 Comments:  This is the new home of the Absolute Pleasure Players, after
  we fled the Meadowbrook (see above).	We do lipsynch preshows before
  the movie, and we have special "V.I.P." virgin seating.  No rice
  allowed (you can throw popcorn instead), but all other audience props
  are fine.  It's a very good show... highly recommended.  Some cast
  members may cross over between the two RI theaters on occasion (but
  not often...we're better.  :-)  ).
 Comments: some of the Meadowbrook (Warwick, RI) cast still perform at
  both and on friday nights, this is a good show ( not so good on
  saturday)

Northcross 6 - Austin, Texas
 Fri & Sat, midnight, $4.50
 Northcross Mall
 2525 West Anderson Lane
 (512) 454-1650
 Comments: It's a decent theatre in a north Austin shopping mall.  My
  teenaged daughters go regularly and have a great time!

Central Park Fox - San Antonio, TX
 Fri & Sat, 10pm, $1.50
 Comments: Cast is on Friday only. (Cast does not get in free, tho)

River Oaks Theatre - Houston, TX
 Price: $6.00

Tower Theatre - Salt Lake City, UT
 Irregular, usually at least once a month, always at a midnight show.

Neptune - Seattle, WA
 Saturday, midnight, $6.50
 Comments: Continuous over 15 years.  Virgin games before the show.
  Live cast.
  
Hoyts Centre - Sydney, Australia
 Fri, 11:30pm, AUS$11.50 Concession AUS$8
 Comments: Cast usually hang out in the bar at Hoyts, so come by and say
  hello! Hoyts is a 'family' cinema, so no fucking swearing, alright? We
  have been running in this incarnation for four years (Anniversary show
  is Fri May 28, 1993). The cinema is quite good, and we have a great
  print, *including* the SuperHeroes ending! Props are mostly cool, just
  no fried rice or anything squishy :( As always, we need fresh lines,
  so feel free to bring your along!
 Comments: Good cast, some innovative callbacks, and a good quality film
  (with Super Heroes at the end, incidently). Movie doesn't start until
  around 12:00, with the cast building the atmosphere with audience
  participation prior to the screening by sing-a-longs and virgin
  introductions etc. All props are permitted and encouraged (with the
  exception of naked flames). Sheets of newspaper handed out at the
  door, to bewilder the virgins who don't know what to expect.

Valhalla - Melbourne, Australia
 This show only plays once a month, on Saturday night
 Comments: (they show Blues Bros every Fri night) Very traditional cast,
  I think they stick to the audience participation album!

Cinema Mondo - Helsinki, Finland, Europe
 Sat, 11:00 - Used to be every Sat at 11:00, but it has been on a break for
	      few months now, though they promised that it'll get back to
	      programme.
 Was 40 FIM, what is about $8.00
 Comments: A small one, but shows used to be good. And as I said: RHPS
  hasn't been on the programme for some months, but it might come back
  next autumn or later on the summer.

Berliner Kammerspiele - Berlin, Germany
 Is anyone in Germany reading this thing except me? I have a small
 contribution to your list of theatres, Rocky is playing in. There is a
 private theatre
   Berliner Kammerspiele,
   Alt-Moabit 99
   1000 Berlin
   Germany
 showing a live show of the Rocky Horror Show for years now. After a
 winter's break Rocky comes back in March 94, I think.
 Furthermore Rocky plays in some state theatres in Germany. I know of a

Paramount Theatre - Wellington, New Zealand
 Either Fri or Sat at 11:15pm, $8.00 or $6.50
 Comments: Either Friday or Saturday nite at 11:15pm.	Generally best
  to watch the papers to see if it's on.   Admission is $8, or $6.50 if
  you have a Radio Active Sub Card. The theatre is pretty small, but any
  props are allowed except water.   There's a fairly large hardcore
  cast, but the average age of them is pretty low (~17- 19).   We're
  loud, and we're rowdy, but it's good fun and we love to come up with
  new AP.   The film is somewhat cut, missing the entire reprise of 'I
  can Make you a Man' to halfway through the Narrator's speech, and it
  jumps in a few places.   We've moved from 3 other theatres; we're
  running out of options, but we stillknow how to party.

Prince Charles Cinema - London, UK
 Fridays
 Comments: off Leicester Square, and they are still performing there,
  every Friday (I think).  Their Space Riff & Magenta are a couple
  called Stephanie and David who run the British RHPS Fan Club. Their
  address is:
       Time Warp Fan Club
       1 Elm Grove
       Hildenborough
       Tonbridge
       Kent TN11 9HE, ENGLAND
  If you write to them and enclose an international reply coupon, they
  can send details of how to join, and they have loads of info on casts
  around the UK. (And there are some!)
