According to well-informed U.S. intelligence sources, Alternative 3 is a
plan to colonize the planet Mars with a cross-section of persons from all
major areas of human knowledge and culture. This project has been ongoing
and under development for many years. The public discussion of a manned
mission to Mars distracts from claims of well-placed sources that we have
already HAD manned Missions to Mars.

A moon base dubbed Luna was sighted and filmed on the far side of the moon
by the Apollo Astronauts. A mining operation using Very Large
Machines has also been sighted there. Luna is a joint United States,
Russian and Alien base.

A craft code-named Aurora allegedly exists at Area 51 (Dreamland) in
Nevada which makes regular trips into space. It is a onestage TAV (trans-
atmospheric vehicle) which can take off from the ground using a 7 mile
long runway, go into high orbit and return on its own power, landing on
the same runway. Atomic-powered alien craft are flown at Area S-4 in
Nevada. Our pilots have made interplanetary voyages in these craft and
have already been to the Moon, Mars and other planets.

With the government's advance knowledge of what's actually on Mars, it's no
wonder that NASA and other agencies are slow to discuss the "face" and
other structures seen on Mars.

Is the foregoing all true? I don't know, I wasn't there. But the people
who DO know are now speaking up -- because what you are reading is most
likely just the "tip of the iceberg" of what is really going on with our
Manned Missions -and our presence in space.
