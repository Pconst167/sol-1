              Wilfred Hyde-White, Dianna L. Burgdorf                           

     The story of how the 12 colonies of man are destroyed after a 1000 year 
war with the evil Cylon Empire.  Through deceit, the Cylons are able to destroy
the Colonies' entire fleet, except for the Battlestar Galactica, captained
by Commander Adama.  Adama gathers up the few remaining humans left on all the
twelve worlds and embarks on a journey to find the mythical planet Earth,
the supposed thirteenth colony of Mankind, lost ages ago when humans first
left the motherworld, Kobol.  With food and fuel running out, the fleet
heads for an ore planet, Carillon, hoping to get what it needs.  The Ovions,
who populate the planet, are being controlled by the Cylons, who set a trap
for the Galactica.  The fleet gets food and fuel, and escapes, destroying
Carillon and a Cylon Base Star.
[Originally, Baltar, who was the human traitor responsible for mankind's
defeat, is executed by the Cylons.  But it was later decided that he survive
to lead a Cylon fleet against the Galactica.]

old acquaintance who has the equipment.  However, the people of the town they go

     Apollo and Starbuck, while on patrol, encounter the supposedly lost
Battlestar Pegasus, commanded by the living legend, Commander Cain.  Cain
insists that the two battlestars join forces to crush the Cylon Empire, or 
more notably, the planet Gamoray to begin with.  Adama, however, fears that
the Cylons may attack the unprotected fleet while the battlestars are away. 
Cain takes steps to assure his plans, and is relieved of duty.  The Cylons do 
attack the fleet (with 3 Base Stars--as many as they used to destroy the 
entire Colonies), and the Pegasus is pulled out to surprise the Cylons.
This works, and the fleet is saved.  Then they launch a surprise attack
on Gamoray while the Pegasus takes on the three Base Stars.  The Galactica
obtains fuel from Gamoray, but the Pegasus disappears after destroying two of 
the Cylon ships.  Baltar, on board the third, narrowly escapes, and no one
is sure whether the Pegasus is destroyed, or has headed back out to the stars.

people in the Recreation Room are saved by Muffy the Daggit.

	
			   War Of The Gods

Air Dates:  Part I--1/14/79  Part II--1/21/79  Writer:  Glen A. Larson
Guest Cast: Patrick Macnee, Kirk Alyn, Bruce Wright, Paul Coufos, John Williams

     The fleet is plagued by a group of glowing lights that constantly fly
passed them too fast to be followed.  Also, vipers keep disappearing whenever
they follow the lights.  On a mission to find the men, Apollo, Starbuck, and
Sheba find a desolate planet, and the remains of a ship wreck.  There they find
Count Iblis, who claims to be, if not a deity, then the next best thing.  His
mysterious powers sway the fleet, as he promises to deliver them if they will
follow him.  Adama doubts Iblis' word, but gives him the task of delivering
the traitor Baltar, which he does.  Everyone is ready to follow Iblis, but
Adama and Apollo soon realize that Iblis is really the Prince of Darkness
and that those 'lights' are after him.  In a final battle, Iblis kills Apollo,
then is taken away for killing someone who hasn't given himself freely.
Starbuck and Sheba, while bringing Apollo's body back, are captured by the
lights, who reveal themselves to be the good version of Iblis' type.  They
ressurect Apollo, and give the Galacticans the coordinates for Earth.
[Baltar, at one point, realizes that Iblis' voice is that of Imperious Leader,
 ruler of the Cylons, which Iblis doesn't deny.  Baltar is then placed on board
 the Prison Barge.]
	
			The Man With Nine Lives

Guest Cast:  Fred Astaire, Anne Jeffreys, Lance LeGault, Robert Feero

     An old con man, Chameleon, is running from a trio of bloodthirsty 
Borellians (Klingon-like villains) when he meets Starbuck.  To gain refuge on 
the Galactica, he convinces Starbuck that he is his long-lost father.  He
is brought on board to confirm the story, and the Borellians get on board by
joining the Viper pilot training program (The Colonial Fleet needs YOU!).
The Borellians are captured and put on board the Prison Barge, and Chameleon
admits to his con and leaves.  Cassiopea tells him that he really is Starbuck's
father, but no one ever tells.


			Murder On The Rising Star

Air Date:  2/18/79  Writer:  Don Bellisario, James Carlson, Terrance McDonnelL
Guest Cast:  Frank Ashmore, Luman Ward, Brock Peters, Patricia Stich, W.K.
             Stratton

     Ortega, Starbuck's rival in the popular sport Triad (a somewhat cross
between handball and basketball) is murdered, and all the evidence points
to Starbuck.  Apollo is about the only one who believes Starbuck, and sets
out to find the real killer.  With Baltar's help, it is discovered that 
Ortega was blackmailing a man who had taken bribes to let people on board his
ship during the exodus from the Colonies.  This man killed Ortega, and is
captured when he attempts to kill Baltar, the only other man who can identify
him.  

			Greetings From Earth

(Two hour special)  Air Date:  2/25/79  Writer:  Glen A. Larson
Guest Cast:  Randy Mantooth, Bobby Van, Ray Bolger, Kelly Harmon, LLoyd Bochner

     Apollo and Starbuck find a primitive sleeper ship carrying a man, a woman,
and four children.  It is taken aboard, and is believed to be from Earth.  The
council wants to open the ship, even though it might kill the inhabitants.
Adama will not allow this.  Dr. Wilker and Dr. Salik discover that the
inhabitants cannot survive in their atmosphere.  Apollo, Starbuck, and 
Cassiopea steal the ship, and continue with it to it's destination, Paradeen.
The male, Michael, informs the Galacticans that they are originally from Terra,
but have fled the war with the Eastern Alliance(an evil government), who are   
killing the democracy-type people.  An Eastern Alliance ship follows the 
sleeper ship and captures the party.  However, the Galacticans are able to then
capture the Alliance men, and take them back to the fleet in their own ship, 
and imprison them on the Prison Barge.  The fleet then continues on to Terra,
gaining the location from Michael.
[A classic scene is when the Alliance Commander, bragging about his invincible
Empire, first sees the Galactica, bigger than any ship he has ever scene.  His
mouth dropping open says it all. Similar to when Baltar first saw the Pegasus.]


			      Baltar's Escape

Air Date:  3/11/79  Writer:  Don Bellisario
Guest Cast:  Ina Bolin, LLoyd Bochner, Lance LeGault, Robert Feero, Anthony
             DeLongis

     Adama is besieged by the troublesome Siress Tinia, who is appointed by the
Council of Twelve to watch over him.  Meanwhile, Baltar plans his escape with
the help of the three Borellians and the Alliance Enforcers.  Thanks to the
Council's interference, hostages are taken, and Adama is forced to give in.
Baltar is to escape in his fighter, along with his Centaurians, while the rest
go in the Alliance ship.  The Alliance ship is able to take off, but Baltar's
escape is foiled because the Centaurians had been disassembled and, when put
back together, didn't quite function up to par.


			Experiment In Terra

Air Date:  3/18/79  Writer:  Glen A. Larson
Guest Cast:  Edward Mulhare, Melody Anderson, Nehemiah Persoff, Ken Swofford

     Apollo and Starbuck follow the escaped Eastern Alliance ship back to
Terra.  Before reaching it, they are picked up by the race of white lights
that had helped them against Count Iblis.  Their representative, John, asks
Apollo to help avert a war that would destroy Terra.  He is sent down,   
appearing to all of the inhabitants as a man they had thought was dead.
He is unable to convince anyone, and is thrown in prison.  Starbuck rescues
him, and they call the Galactica to try to help before Armageddon occurs.
The President of the Western people has made a treaty with the Eastern 
Alliance, in which all hostilities will stop.  However, the Eastern Alliance is
lying, and plans to strike when the guard is down.  Apollo lectures the people
of how his own race was tricked, and before anything can be done, the Eastern
Alliance fires its warheads.  The Galactica is able to destroy all the bombs,
and the frightened world powers open their eyes and talk peace.  In return for
their help, Michael tells Apollo that Terra is not the Earth that they are
searching for.



			   Take The Celestria

     Starbuck runs in to his long-lost love, Aurora, who is supposedly found to
be a traitor on board the Celestria.  It is discovered that the captain of the
Celestria, Kronus, runs the ship like a dictator, and Aurora and friends are a
liberation force.  It is learned that a junior officer is really the one
mistreating the crew, and that Kronus is only an iron-fisted leader.  Apollo
and Starbuck help defeat the evil members of the Celestria.

Tired of running from the Cylons, Adama decides to have it out for the last
time.  Using Baltar's ship, Apollo and Starbuck sneak on board the following
Base Star, and sabotage its scanners.  The Galactica then destroys the Base
Star, and Apollo and Starbuck are barely saved.  
[This was the last episode, and it ended with an unattended scanner picking up
transmitions of an Earth Moon Mission.]

			Galactica Discovers Earth

Air Dates:  I--1/27/80  II--2/3/80  III--2/10/80  Writer:   Glen A. Larson
Guest Cast:  Robert Reed, Richard Lynch, Pamela Susan Shoop

     At Last, the Galactica finds the planet Earth!  It's the year 1980 A.D.,
and their hopes are dashed when they find that the planet does not have the
technology to help defeat the Cylons.  In fact, the Earth is bad off as it is.
The Galactica leaves Earth, so that the Cylons following do not find it, but
send down Lt. Troy (formerly Boxey, Adama's grandson) and Lt. Dillon to 
contact Prof. Mortinson, a man they feel can help them to advance Earth's 
technology quick enough to be of help.  There is trouble, in the form of 
Xavier, one of the Council of Twelve who feels that the Galacticans should
upgrade Earth by travelling into the past and introducing modern devices
(Dr. Zee has developed a time-travel device and a cloaking device, both
outfitted into Vipers).  He goes to Nazi Germany, not caring about the
consequences, and Troy and Dillon, joined by reporter Jamie Hamilton of
Earth, follow him.  They undo his damage, but lose Xavier somewhere in time.
Adama goes ahead with his plan to slowly upgrade Earth, Prof. Mortinson is told
that someday he will meet them again, and Jamies joins the Colonial fleet.



			    The Super Scouts

Air Dates:  Part I--3/16/80  Part II--3/23/80  Writer:  Glen A. Larson
Guest Cast:  Alan Miller, Fred Holliday, John Quade

     The Cylons launch a surprise attack on the fleet, doing considerable 
damage.  Troy and Dillon take the children of the fleet down to Earth to
protect them.  With Jamie's help, they disguise themselves as scouts, but
they get into some trouble, such as when Dillon tries to change his gold cubits
in for American currency, and accidentally robs a bank.  With the police after
them, the group camp out in the woods.   However, some of the children become
ill from drinking polluted water from a chemical plant, and there is a problem
with the Colonists' bizarre anatomies.  The children are saved, however, and 
the plant is closed down.
[The reason for using children was that ABC T.V. agreed to broadcast the show,
but only at 7:00 P.M. on Sunday, which was considered children's time.  This
meant only a minimal of violence, and morals for the kiddies.  This is what
killed Galactica 1980.  Also, it was explained that due to the relatively
lighter gravity of Earth as opposed to Caprica and the other home planets, the
Galacticans could do amazing physical feats.  Enter the super-kids!]



			       Spaceball
 
Air Date:  3/30/80  Writers:  Frank Lupo, Jeff Freilich, Glen A. Larson
Guest Cast:  Fred Holliday, Bert Rosario, Paul Koslo, Jeremy Brett

     Xavier returns, and gets rid of Troy and Dillon by sending them into space
in a sabotaged Viper.  They are busy repairing the ship while Xavier tries to
kidnap the kids and hold them for ransom.  Meanwhile, Jamie has taken the
children to a baseball camp for underprivileged kids where she is doing a
story.  This of course results in them playing a game with their super-powers,
saving the camp from being closed down.  Troy and Dillon return in time to foil
Xavier, but he escapes again.



		       The Night The Cylons Landed

Air Date:  4/13/80  Writer:  Glen Larson
Guest Cast:  Roger Davis, William Daniels, Peter Mark Richman, Lara Parker

     The Cylon Empire has built a new type of Cylon, a humanoid android.  One 
of them, Andromus, along with a centaurian, crashland on Earth.  Troy and 
Dillon attempt to catch them, but the Cylons are picked up by a group of people
on their way to a Halloween party.  The Cylons learn that the party is
associated with a New York radio station, and seek to take control of the
station to send a message to a nearby Cylon Base ship that they have found
Earth. 
[Note:  Microwave ovens screw up Cylon circuitry.]


			So This Is New York
Air Date:  4/20/80  Writer: Glen A. Larson
Guest Cast:  William Daniels, Roger Davis, Lara Paker, Peter, Mark Richman,
	     Wolfman Jack

     Continuation of previous episode, where Cylons attempt to take over a
radio station(where Wolfman Jack is the D.J.).  Troy and Dillon are slowed in
their attempt to stop them when they have to save a child in a penthouse fire
started by the Cylons.  They save the child and stop the Cylons.



		           Harvest Home

Air Date:  4/27/80  Writer:  Robert L. McCullough
Guest Cast:  Ned Romero, Ana Alicia, Dana Elcar

     The Cylons again attack the fleet, taking out the Agroships.  With
their food supply destroyed, Troy and Dillon enter a partnership with 
Hector Alonzo, a farmer being threatened by a powerful and prejudiced 
land baron, John Steadman.  (Sounds like a job for the A-Team!)  The 
Galacticans bring down Dr. Zee's anti-grav ship, and Steadman spots this and
calls in the police.  The Galacticans hide the evidence of their presence,
put Steadman out of business, and get their food.



			The Return of Starbuck

Air Date:  5/4/80  Writer:  Glen A. Larson
Guest Cast:  Dirk Benedict, Judith Chapman, Rex Cutter

     At last, the fate of Starbuck is revealed.  Prof. Zee was revealed in
the premier to be a mutant.  He is a child genius.  He has a dream about
Starbuck, which he relates to Adama, who knows the story to be true.
     Fourteen years earlier, while in a battle, Starbuck's Viper was 
gravely damaged, and Boomer watched him wildly fly towards a planet.  
The fleet could not go back for him, since the Cylons were on their tail.
Starbuck crashed onto the barren planet, his ship all but destroyed.  There
he finds the remains of a Cylon fighter, of which one Cylon he is able to fix. 
He does this out of lonliness.  Cy, as he names him, first wishes to kill
Starbuck, because he is a human, but soon learns that they need each other,
and they become friends (to both of their surprise).  Then a mysterious
pregnant woman appears, and Starbuck does his all to care for her, which makes
Cy jealous.  However, Cy helps Starbuck build a tiny ship out of the remains of
