Okay, having read the funny stuff after someone followed up with a URL
that explained the Narn Bat Squad, I hereby present "The Babylon-5
Moto-Cross!"  Having already done this for DS9, I figure it's time to
ask the question here as well, the one question that has been burning in
our minds, keeping us up, taking most of our concentration away from
daily matters:

What car would everyone drive?

Okay, maybe not EVERYONE.  So I've got a car fetish.  Sue me.

1) Sheridan -- Yet a big Dodge pickup truck with a big magnum engine
and a dumb mutt dog on the passenger seat.  One of those little license
plate frames that look like a chain.
2) Delenn -- a Tucker torpedo with a 440 squeezed into it, something
truly bizarre yet massively powerful.
3) Ivanova -- a jeep with spikes on the wheel covers like the chariots
in Ben Hur :-) Optional bumpersticker that says "If you can read this,
you are within weapons range," and the little Yosemite Sam mudflaps that
say "BACK OFF!" (with "Marcus" written underneath)
4) Garibaldi -- a GTO, some big ol' gas-sucker that rips pavement apart,
possibly with a tach in the hood and flames painted on the front.  BIG
tires.
5) Franklin -- not sure, seems like the red Jeep Cherokee type.  He has
to wear hot shit sunglasses while driving.
6) Marcus -- a beat-up old MG that has been tinkered with like mad until
it can go 250mph (for twelve seconds until it over-revs and shoots the
rods right through the hood -- lively, cute but rumpled, and looks like
it might careen right over a cliff if you're not steering carefully)
7) Bester -- anything with a Stealth paint job.  Probably a black panel 
van with government plates
8) Londo -- a big obnoxious Cadillac pimpmobile with a wet bar and a
jacuzzi in the deck lid.  Rotten exhaust -- belches black smoke all over
everyone.

What would everone else drive?

Take care,
Janis

"Termiter's argument that God is His own grandmother generated a
surprising amount of controversy among Church leaders, who on the one
hand considered the argument unsupported by scripture but on the other
hand were unwilling to risk offending God's grandmother."
