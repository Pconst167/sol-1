THE DOCTOR AND TIMELORDS IN GENERAL

1.1  Who is Doctor Who?

    Doctor #                 Actor
       1                William Hartnell*
       2                Patrick Troughton*
       3                Jon Pertwee
       4                Tom Baker
       5                Peter Davison (with one "d")
       6                Colin Baker
       7                Sylvester McCoy
       8                (1992 ??? )

  Also, Richard Hurndall* played Doctor #1 in "The Five Doctors", except
  for the old clip at the beginning (that was Hartnell).

  * indicates the actor has passed away


1.2  What is the Doctor's name?
 
The main character of "Doctor Who" has been referred to by several
different labels.  These include:
    -Theta Sigma, used by Drax on the Planet of the Shadow (The Armageddon
     Factor).  This is supposedly an old school name.  It was used again
     in The Happiness Patrol.
    -Doctor Who, has been used in a couple episodes, most notably The War
     Machines, were WOTAN is calling for "Doctor Who".  The role was credited
     as "Doctor Who" until Castrovalva, where the name changed to:
    -The Doctor.  This seems to be what he is called most often.
    -Doctor van Wer, was used in The Highlanders.
    -In Colony in Space, a name was presented, but was unreadable, on a 
     Gallifreyan computer.
    -Dr. Caligari was used in The Gunfighters.
    -Dr. Foreman was hinted at in An Unearthly Child.
    -Dr. John Smith was the alias the Doctor used while he was UNIT's unpaid
     scientific advisor.  He also used this in The War Games.
    -In The Trial of a Time Lord, one section of the matrix had the Doctor
     almost saying his name while on Earth.  He never finishes the sentence.
    -In Remembrance of the Daleks, a calling card was produced by the Doctor
     that may or may not have had his name.
    -Ace usually calls him Professor.


1.3 What is the distinction between regeneration and incarnation?

    When a regeneration occurs, a timelord renews his or her body.  What that
means to us is a new appearance (a new actor).  An incarnation is a particular
body.  So far, the Doctor has had seven incarnations and six regenerations.


1.4 How many regenerations does a timelord get?

    Twelve.  The fact that there is a fixed number is referenced in many
stories, and I believe the first mention is in "The Deadly Assasin".
The number twelve is stated in "Mawdryn Undead", and probably in other
stories as well.

1.5 How old is the Doctor?

    Here are some clues:

  From "The Ribos Operation":
        The Doctor: "How old do you think I am?"
        Romana: "759"
        The Doctor: "756"
        Romana: "You've lost count somewhere."

  From "The Pirate Planet":
        The Doctor: "How long do you think I've been operating this TARDIS?"
        Romana:  "523 years."
        The Doctor: "Right uh....has it been that long?"

Well, I've got another -- From "Remembrance of the Daleks", the younger of
the female scientists (who I believe is called 'Alison Williams' or something
similar) asks the Doctor "How do you just rewire a piece of alien
machinery?", to which he replies "It's easy... when you have 900 years of
experience." (older than both the figures given in the file :-) )

CONFUSING PLOTS AND STORYLINES

2.1  Please explain Romana's regeneration.

There is no good explanation, but net discussions have yielded these
possibilities:

a: Romana is wasteful
b: Romana had achieved a higher level in the Academy, and hence the
ability to "try-on bodies"
c: Romana, unlike the Doctor, regenerated "Without Stress". What I
mean by this is that the Doctor could choose and "Try-on bodies" like
Romana did *IF* there was no stress about his regeneration.


2.2  Was that really the White Guardian at the beginning of The Key to
Time?

There are two camps of opinions to this question, obviously one yes and
one no.  The No Camp believes that the pursuit of the key was motivated
solely by the Black Guardian, and use as evidence his masquerade in
The Armageddon Factor as their proof.  They also feel that the White 
Guardian at the start of the sequence was threatening to the Doctor,
and therefore out of character.

I [James] personally disagree.  When masquerading, the part was still played
by Valentine Dyall.  In The Ribos Operation, the part was played by 
Cyril Luckham.  Cyril also played the White Guardian in Enlightenment,
when both Guardians were present, so we may be confident that Cyril's
appearance is the "normal" appearance of the White Guardian.


2.3 Was there a regeneration scene from Colin to Sylvester?

This is how Time and the Rani begins:

Voice of BBC1: "A new series, a new physical form and a journey to an
altogether more far-flung shore.  Sylvester McCoy stars as Doctor Who."

[OK, so that bit was only on the BBC, but I'm saying that so people know that
these nexts bits come before the title sequence.]

Computer animation space sequence: swirling stars.  Out of these come spinning
the TARDIS.  Multicolored beams come from the left.  Some miss, some hit.
Those that hit cause the TARDIS's gyrations to alter, so that the TARDIS is
spinning in three (maybe four!) dimensions.  There are two of these sequences,
actually.

Inside the TARDIS:  The Doctor and Mel are lying on the floor.  The Doctor is
face-down [and surprisingly short, since it's actually McCoy in a wig and
Colin's immense costume].  The exercise bike falls over.

On Lakertya:  Ikona climbing atop the quarry, er, serene rocky mountain.
He looks into the pink sky and sees a color-cycling rainbow.  Down this bow
comes the TARDIS.

Inside the TARDIS:  Red-clothed feet enter.  Pan up.  It's the Rani, holding
a gun-like object (which the Doctor recognizes later in the show), which she
used to shoot down the TARDIS.  Rani speaks: "Leave the girl; it's the man
I want."

Inside the TARDIS:  Furry feet.  (Urak)  They lumber over to the face-down
Doctor.  Furry hand reaches down, and turns the Doctor over, just as the
fx people turn on a video bleed.  The wig disappears as the shot is changed
to a wig-less McCoy, and the fx people slowly turn off the bleed, as the
whooshy music rises portamento higher and higher and higher.

As the bleed stops and we see the face and the music climaxes, the
opening title sequence begins.


MAKING THE SHOW

3.1  Will there be more Doctor Who?

Maybe, maybe not.  Not anytime soon, anyway.  The official announcement is:

"Doctor Who will be back but not in the near future. We are
 not close to a deal with any company. When Doctor Who returns
 the programme will be vibrant, vital and improved, not a tired
 old Time Lord who comes back too soon" *

* The BBC has announced it start production of Dr Who in 1992.
  This leaves the questions though:

     1. When will the first episode be aired?
     
        The latest reports of show times could be as early as the '92 season,
     but is mostly speculation now - and for U.S. viewers, it could mean
     a year at least after the first season ends.


     2. Who will play Who? (The Doctor)

        We know offically that Sylvester McCoy won't be continuning as
     the Doctor. The list of people nominated to take over the part have
     included a run-down list of impossibilities, so hence the real
     word has yet to be given.
           

3.2.  Will there ever be a woman Doctor?

While it may be possible for a male<->female regeneration, it is
unlikely that a woman will be cast as the Doctor in the near future.

This whole controversy started with Tom Baker intentionally stirring
up the hornets nest by saying when he left the part, "And I'd like
to wish the new Doctor, whoever he or she may be..."


3.3 Is David Agnew really a pseudonym for Douglas Adams?

David Agnew was a house pseudonym that was used twice. The first time was on
"The Invasion of Time" and that one was written by Graham Williams and Anthony
Read.  The second episode with that name was City of Death and that one
was Douglas Adams (as script editor) and Graham Williams.



3.4 Was Castrovalva the first Peter Davison story filmed?

Castrovalva WAS the fourth Peter Davison story made.  The others were
made in advance to allow the Doctor character to settle (hard to do
with three other characters to write for...).  In order, they were:
Four to Doomsday, The Visitation, and Kinda.



MISCELLANEOUS

4.1  What are the "missing episodes"?

   During the early seventies many Doctor Who stories were destroyed by
the BBC, along with vast amounts of other material kept by the BBC, in
order to cut costs in storage. This was before they knew they could market
much of the stuff.  Copyright laws had much to do with this also.  Many of
the lost episodes are of the later William Hartnell and much from the
Patrick Troughton era.  As much as 115 episodes are still missing
(equivalent to 2 to 3 seasons).


4.2  Which story included John Cleese?

John Cleese appeared with Eleanor Bron as art critics in City of Death.


4.3 What is Temporal Grace?

Temporal Grace is the quality which is alleged to prevent the use of
weapons inside a TARDIS.  It has not been working in the Doctor's 
TARDIS since Logopolis.


4.4  Where can I get more information?

Doctor Who - Twenty-Five Glorious Years

    "Doctor Who - Twenty-Five Glorious Years" is a book that tells the story
of the first twenty five years of the longest running science fiction series.
The book is a mish-mash of information that any Who-info starving Whovian will
kill to get (maybe a little too strong), but it does have plenty to interest
anyone who loves the Doctor.
    The book starts of with an introduction to the beginnings of this 
amazing series from the brainchild of Sydney Newman  to the airwaves in 1963.
It then proceeds to give a perspective of the quarter century of Doctor Who, 
from William Hartnell to Sylvester McCoy.
    Then comes an insight behind the cameras of Doctor Who with John Nathan-
Turner.  John gives us background to his work done with the show and working
with Tom Baker, up to Sylvester McCoy.
    The next section discusses the seven actors that have played the Doctor
since the beginning.  Starting off with a long part about Sylvestor McCoy, it
gives a two or three page discussion on the other six Doctors.
    Following is a little section on other persons that have played the 
Doctor, including Peter Cushing in the movies "Doctor Who and the Daleks" and 
"Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD", and Trevor Martin who played the Doctor in
a stage play.
    It goes on to discuss the Doctor as viewed by his favourite female 
companions and includes a little write up of each. They include:
 Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill), Dorothea 'Dodo' Chaplet (Jackie Lane),
 Victoria Waterfield (Deborah Watling), Zoe Harriet (Wendy Padbury),
 Liz Shaw (Caroline John), Jo Grant (Katy Manning),
 Sarah Jane Smith (Elizabeth Sladen), Leela (Louise Jameson),
 Romana (Mary Tamm), Nyssa (Sarah Sutton), Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding), 
Perpugilliam 'Peri' Brown (Nicola Bryant), Melanie Bush (Bonnie Langford) and
 Ace (Sophie Aldred).
    Others sections include one of guest stars that have appeared on the show,
separated into subsections of each of the Doctor's eras, excluding 
Sylvestor McCoy, and a couple of smaller sections on Doctor Who and the 
merchandisers and as well as Doctor Who in the comics.
    The final section is a listing of all the episodes,  giving the name of
the story, writers, directors, guests, how many episodes and when they were
aired.


4.5  What other books are recommended?
    Neal Crossan writes:
   Well from Peter Haining, his best was probably Dr.Who - A Celebration,
since then he has shown a remarkable talent for rewritting the same book.
   For individual stories, InVision can't be beat (this includes CMS
Adventures In Space In Time).
   Dr.Who -The Early Years is an excellent account of the Hartnell Years of 
the Show.
   For an overall perspective, Dr.Who Monthly and DWB.  O.K., so they're
magazines and not books, but many of the topics in 25 Glorious Years have
been covered in them in much more detail.
   And finally the best book on Dr.Who - David Bank's Cybermen book.


4.6  How do I get Ryan K. Johnson's fan-produced episodes of Doctor Who?

Basically, all you have to do is put $3 and a blank (VHS) videotape
in an envelope and send it to:

Ryan K. Johnson, P.O. Box 85418, Seattle, WA 98145

and he'll send the tape back to you with the four Doctor Who episodes,
_Wrath of Eukor_, _Visions of Utomu_, _Pentagon West_ and _Broken Doors_,
plus _Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation_ (a parody of you-know-what.)

That's basically it. He wants as many people as possible to be able to
see these and encourages us to "show them around or make copies for friends,
enemies, or people off the street." So there you have it...
