INTRODUCTION.
        I: The Citations of Books.

        We arranged the materials in the following bibliography in
chronological order, according to the date on which they were catalogued
by the Library of Congress in Washington. Generally, several items near
the end of the list will have the annotation <In preparation, MM/YY>
immediately after the Library of Congress call number. Such items have
been catalogued as a part of the Library's "Cataloging-in-Publication"
program but have not yet appeared in print. To learn more about them,
write to, or call, the offices of the respective publishers.

        The number in the upper left-hand corner of each entry is the
Library of Congress card number. The first two digits, to the left of
the hyphen, represent the year in which the Library catalogued the
work, and the remaining digits, to the right of the hyphen, are a serial
number for the order of the cataloguing. The Library begins a new series
each year, so that 89-1, for example, is the card number for the first
work catalogued by the Library in 1989, 89-2 is the second, and so on.

        Beneath this, is the main body of the entry. It includes the
author, title, publisher, place of publication, date of publication or
copyright, and the descriptive cataloguing. Following this, you will
find the Library of Congress call number. This number is that which is
used to shelve and retrieve books and journals in most large public and
university library systems. Most of those libraries which have not yet
converted to this system of cataloguing still employ the Dewey
Decimal System, and the call number in that system is shown, in most
cases, directly beneath the Library of Congress call number.

        The terms located to the right of the heading "Tracings" are those
under which you will find subject-entry cards in most card catalogues.
These terms can be particularly useful if you are searching for
materials on a specific or narrower topic within the bibliography. Vern
Buerg's LIST program is a very handy way to do this. (see below)

        The thesaurus of searching terms used to create the tracings
conforms to the Library of Congress's subject headings. You can find a
two-volume tabulation of these headings in the reference collection of
every large library, and in nearly all good small libraries, as well.
Often this work is kept near the library's card catalogue or its on-line
terminals.

        In the bottom fields of each entry, you will find any added
entries, technical annotations, and bibliographic notes which the
Library of Congress's staff included on the original library card.



        II: The Citations of Articles.

        The articles which appear in the following bibliography are
arranged chronologically by control number, generally in three series,
but sometimes in two. In each series, the order is from the most recent
article to the oldest.

        In the first series, the control number appears in the upper
right-hand corner of the entry, immediately beneath the item number. In
the second and third series, the control number is to be found near the
lower left-hand corner of the entry.

        Please remember that to see the most recent articles on a
subject, you generally will have to look in three places. At the
beginning of the list, you will find those entries which have a control
number in the upper right-hand corner. If you do not find such entries
in this bibliography, then we have included only two series. After the
first series progresses to the oldest article included in it, you will
find two more series with the control number for each article at the
lower left of the entry. Again, the most recent article in each series
will appear first with older articles following later. You can determine
very easily the point at which the one series ends and the next begins,
because the control numbers will "jump" to a more recent date.

        The first two fields in each citation show the author and title
of the article. The field labelled "Source" shows the title of the
journal in which the article appears, the date of issue, the volume and
issue numbers, and the pages which contain the article. Often this field
also will show the Library of Congress call number for the journal and
may include a note, with cataloguing numbers, if that issue has been
preserved on microfilm. Many entries also show the international
standard serial number for the journal as the last field.

        The field which is labelled "Notes" contains a brief abstract of
the article, in most cases.

        The terms listed under "Tracings" and "Other Terms" correspond
to the subject-cataloguing terms which would appear on a library card if
the work had been catalogued as a book. We have incorporated these terms
into our citations to make it easier for you to search for a specific or
narrower topic within the general bibliography. One way to do this on a
DOS microcomputer is to use Vern Buerg's LIST program. (see below)

        Several other fields may be included in a citation. The labels
for these fields generally are self-explanatory.




        III: Using the Bibliography.

        There are two "shareware" programs which can, in effect,
transform this ASCII-text bibliography into an on-line, searchable
catalogue for you.

        The most important of these is Vern Buerg's superb LIST program,
which has rendered the DOS "type" command completely obsolete. Once you
have brought the bibliography to your screen, using the command LIST
<filename.ext>, you can use the program's searching functions, with the
keystroke "/" for case-sensitive searches or "\" for case-insensitive
searches, to highlight serially those terms which are of the greatest
interest to you. You can search every word or word stem in every
entry, so that you can create a list of all of the works by
one author or all of the books published by one publisher very easily.
By using topical terms, which are to be found in the list of tracings
for each citation, you can compile a list of works on a narrower topic
than the general subject of the bibliography.

        We compressed the data in each bibliography in this series by
using Phil Katz's PKZIP program. Should you not wish to use its
corollary, PKUNZIP, to expand the file for searching, you can use
Jim Derr's fine SHEZ program. It will allow you temporarily to "un-ZIP"
the file and search the file's contents, as long as LIST.COM resides in
the same directory as SHEZ and that this directory is in the DOS path.

        If you wish to print the bibliography, we recommend Daniel
Doman's DPRINT program. If you turn on your printer's compressed
printing mode and enter:
              DPRINT -M20 -W80 <filename.ext>
from the command line, you will produce a copy with the entries printed
in the middle of each numbered page and with a margin on the left which
is suitable for binding.

        Please remember that the PKZIP, PKUNZIP, LIST, SHEZ, and DPRINT
programs are all "shareware" and, if you use them, you owe the authors
of these excellent programs the financial contribution for which they
ask. The bibliography in this present file was prepared for the use of
students, scholars, and researchers who are interested in the subject,
and we solicit no contribution of any kind for it.




        About THE BIBLIOGRAPHER.

        We prepare bibliographies and other useful reference lists of
data on demand for our clients. We search virtually all of the large
commercial databases as well as many less-well-known smaller ones to
prepare inclusive bibliographies of books, journal articles, maps,
music, and ephemeral publications, such as reports. Our professional
staff uses published indexes and abstracts to add materials that are not
yet available on-line. We also can find a copy of almost any item in
our bibliographies and deliver it to our clients.

        Our customers include engineers and physicists who are working
on the most advanced technology, academics working in fields as diverse
as nineteenth-century British literature and modern interferometry, and
both professional and amateur genealogists. Our corporate clients
include major firms in industry and commerce, leading government
contractors, and small information brokers. No subject is too abstruse
or arcane.

        Because we understand the pressures of time and money on the
modern researcher, we work quickly. We can send printed bibliographies
or searchable disks swiftly or we can transmit the material by modem.

        If we can help you with your research, please write or call us.
