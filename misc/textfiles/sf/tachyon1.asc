                  The Symposium on Energy Technology in Hannover
                             November 27 and 28, 1980

                      Topic of the Symposium (Tachyon Field)
                               by Dr. Hans A. Nieper

       Space is filled  with  an  energy field, the energy concentration of
       which is extremely large (for the  layman,  the energy field in this
       lecture room could correspond to the energy of several bombs.)

       This energy field  has  little  to  do with light  energy  or  solar
       energy, and instead  is  called the GRAVITON FIELD, TACHYON FIELD or
       NEUTRINO FIELD.

       There are two essential models of imagination for this field and the
       tachyon.  We are either dealing with  EXTREMELY  SHORT  WAVES  which
       possess VERY HIGH  ENERGY  electromagnetic  radiation,   or  we  are
       dealing with very  small  energy  units  which  display  a PULSATING
       BEHAVIOR which, in turn, determines their energy.

       Most scientists have a tendency to  use the model of PULSATING UNITS
       (quantum jiggle or Zero Point Energy in modern terms).   These units
       can move MUCH FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, however, they need not
       often do so.

       According to some scientists, the Tachyon Field DETERMINES THE SPEED
       OF LIGHT.  It would then correspond exactly to the geometric average
       (V50) of the tachyon speed (Koppitz).

       If the speed  of  light  corresponds to the geometric average of the
       sum of the tachyon speeds, this would  mean  that the speed of light
       would also change with changes in the characteristics of the Tachyon
       Field.

       The late Canadian physicist W. Smith wrote that the  speed of light,
       in general, is   assumed  to  be  quite  static  (constant)  in  our
       universe.  It is defined as "the  rate  at  which space moves within
       time."  However, if  this is considered in terms of  the  new  field
       concept (Tachyon Field), then the speed of light DEPENDS on the
       TIME CHARACTERISTICS of the field.

       The speed of  light,  therefore,  is  ONLY  constant  when  the time
       characteristics of the Tachyon Field REMAIN constant.  However, when
       these characteristics change (which  they always do), then the speed
       of light CHANGES.

       In fact, the speed of light measured on the earth  is  ANYTHING  BUT
       UNIFORM.  In the March, 1934 edition of "Popular Science", on page

                                      Page 1

       25, the following summary was given.

          "In 1926,   Prof.   A.A.   Michelson,  one  of  the  most  famous
           experimental physicists  of his  time,  measured  light  flashes
           between two mirrors set up on mountain peaks 22 miles apart.  He
           determined that the speed of light was 186,284 miles per second.

           In order to obtain a more accurate value, he  allowed  light  to
           pass through a three inch (evacuated) tube a mile long which was
           located in  Pasadena,  so  that the speed of light could also be
           measured in a vacuum.

           After the death of Michelson, Dr. Francis Pease (of the Carnegie
           Institute) and  Fred Pierson  (of  the  University  of  Chicago)
           continued these measurements.

           As reported in the December, 1932 edition of "Popular  Science",
           on page  36, these measurements displayed SUBSTANTIAL DEVIATION,
           especially since controllers  of  the  U.S.  Coast  and Geodetic
           Survey DID NOT FIND ANY ERRORS when they measured  the length of
           the tube several times.

           Accordingly, the  measured  deviations, could only be attributed
           to a CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING BEHAVIOR of the speed of light.

           On certain days, the light seemed  to  move  up  to 12 miles per
           second FASTER than on other days.  The speed  seemed  to  change
           with the  season,  and  there  were  even more mysterious cycles
           lasting about two weeks.

           Finally the  scientists AGREED  ON  AN  AVERAGE  value  for  all
           measurements, and FIXED the average speed at 186,271  miles  per
           second."

       This was in  1934.  Today, based on the torsion pendulum experiments
       of the American physicist, Dr. Saxl,  we  know  that  during the New
       Moon the gravitational acceleration of the Earth INCREASES SLIGHTLY.

       This means that at the time of the New Moon, the Tachyon Field LOSES
       its intensity slightly thereby INFLUENCING THE SPEED  OF  LIGHT.  It
       is obvious that  rejection of the axiom of a constant speed of light
       creates a problem for ORTHODOX PHYSICS.

       In addition, Prof.  Seike suggested  that  the  speed  of  light  be
       measured on another body in space, for example, on a moon of Jupiter
       or on a probe remote from the Earth.  He expects a  HIGHER  speed of
       light there than on the Earth.  He is probably right.

       The Tachyon Field   is   also  responsible  for  the  phenomenon  of
       gravitational acceleration.  The SHIELDING EFFECT of a mass causes a
       second mass to be ACCELERATED TOWARDS  IT.  The gravity acceleration
       (Earth attraction) is  a  THRUST  phenomenon and NOT  AN  ATTRACTION
       phenomenon.

       The field strength  of  the Tachyon Field is extremely large.  It is
       given as 8.8  X  10  to  the  8th volts  per  centimeter  by  Seike.
       Probably only a small fraction of tachyons travel  faster  than  the
       speed of light.

       The majority of  them  (tachyons)  may  remain relatively stationary
       (these are called  BRADYONS)  and   because   of  their  OSCILLATORY
       BEHAVIOR (Prof.  Seike      calls     it     "trembling      motion"
       [Zitterbewegung]), they HAVE A GREAT AMOUNT OF ENERGY.

       This means that  ALL MATTER is immersed in an EXTREMELY DENSE ENERGY
       FIELD which we cannot percieve.

       In connection with this, we must  consider  an  explanation  for  an
       exact physical experiment  which has been repeated  many  times  and
       which has not  yet  been  adequately explained.  This is the PHANTOM
       PHENOMENON in Kirlian photography.

       Kirlian photography shows that biologically  living  matter, without
       defining this more precisely, can be imaged on a photographic plate.
       For example, a freshly picked leaf will expose a photographic  plate
       exactly according to its structure.

       Usually, an exposure time of eight hours is needed.  However, if the
       tip of the  leaf  is  cut  off  before  the  leaf  is  placed on the
       photographics plate, the result  is  that  the  WHOLE  leaf is still
       completely imaged on the photographic plate, exactly in its previous
       form and including its missing part.

       This phantom phenomenon  in Kirlian photography is  among  the  many
       documented results of  experimental  physics.  Therefore, space must
       have characteristics which allow  it  to  retain the "impression" of
       matter which it  previously  contained,  at least for  a  period  of
       several hours.  The  concept  of  a  bradyon field at rest, and with
       very high energy, would explain this.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard note...

           Think of the Bradyon field in  its continuous jiggle as having a
           composition similar to syrup.  Rapidly moving  Tachyons  can  be
           thought of as water or gas.

           Comparison of  the  flow  speed  of the two fields shows how the
           Bradyon field could "sustain"  the holographic (3d) image of the
           universe in a matrix of living energy.

           This opens up very interesting concepts relating  to Sheldrake's
           Morphogenetic Fields and Burrs' Electrodynamic Fields of Life.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       However, only tachyons  which  criss-cross  space  could  be used to
       explain the acceleration of gravity.   It  is  possible that this is
       only a small fraction of the entire Tachyon Field.

       According to our present knowledge, the energy of the  Tachyon Field
       can be transformed into other energy types in many ways.

          1)  The Tachyon Field penetrates masses and gives off part of its
              energy by  means  of  a  BRAKING  EFFECT.   This leads to the
              central heating of masses  (geothermal  energy).   Today  the
              principle has    been    verified   mostly    by    analogous
              investigations of  the  Moon  and  Venus.   It can be assumed
              that, when penetrating the Earth mass, the travelling Tachyon
              Field will give up about 4% of its energy.  This calculation

                                      Page 3

              is very  vague,  and  cannot  be given more precisely at this
              time (Nieper).  The GEOTHERMAL  ENERGY  can  be considered as
              captured GRAVITY FIELD ENERGY.  It is generated  continuously
              from the  outside  and  can theoretically be removed from the
              Earth arbitrarily and without causing any damage.

          2)  Magnetic and electrostatic fields are capable of intercepting
              tachyon energy (refer the work  of T. Townsend Brown i.e, the
              Biefield/Brown Effect - BIEBRN1 & BIEBRN2 on  KeelyNet).  The
              intercepted energy   (or   braking   effect)   may   increase
              exponentially with  the field  strength.   Masses  which  are
              subject to   large   magnetic  induction  apparently   absorb
              especially large   amounts   of  tachyon  energy  because  of
              principle 1 (and 2).  The  Jupiter  Moon  IO  seems  to be an
              example of this.

          3)  Very abrupt voltage changes apparently withdraw  energy  from
              the Tachyon  Field.   This  principle seems to play a role in
              the formation of lightning energy.  Experiments based on this
              principle include the Gray  convertor,  where  discharges are
              fed in  from a condensor system to a conventionally  designed
              electric motor,  instead  of the conventional electric field.
              The Gray motor has an efficiency  of  over  100%; that is, it
              can produce more energy than is required for its operation.

              During an   electrical   short  circuit,  the   energy   flow
              apparently is greater in a special experimental configuration
              than would be expected from the supplied power (Kromrey).

          4)  The  so-called  "standing  electromagnetic  wave" and certain
              other manipulations of electromagnetic  waves seem to disturb
              mutual "tolerance" between the electromagnetic  waves and the
              Tachyon Field.    This  leads  to  ENERGY  REMOVAL  FROM  THE
              TACHYONS into   the   electromagnetic   wave   which   become
              "UNSYMPATHETIC."  This principle was discovered  by physicist
              Nikola Tesla  about  100  years  ago  and  was used by him to
              experimentally extract Tachyon  Field  energy  and convert it
              into electrical    current.     By    adopting    the    term
              "interference", specialists   today   speak   of   a   "Tesla
              interferometer."  Tesla at  that  time prediced the technical
              exploitation of space energy "within a few generations."

              He was  about 100 years ahead of his time.   The  exceptional
              importance of this man is only now becoming known.  The Tesla
              Principle is  considered by specialists today to be a classic
              example of tachyon energy conversion.  The recently developed
              "Tesla Cannon"   is   based    on    this   principle.    The
              electromagnetic waves  are  modified  in the  form  of  laser
              bundling, so that they absorb additional tachyon energy.

              Such a  beam  can  have  a  destructive  effect in space over
              hundreds of kilometers and  has  a  very  high  energy.   The
              American physicist  Dr.  Moray  did not fire  Tesla  modified
              waves into space.  Instead he directed them into an insulated
              cable 15  meters  long.   Inside the cable, energy is removed
              from the Tachyon Field.   Dr.  Moray  was  able  to produce a
              continous power of 70 KW direct current!   This  occurred  in
              1929.  Forty years earlier Tesla directed a "Tesla-beam" over

                                      Page 4

              a long  distance  onto  a  piece  of  metal and made numerous
              electrical bulbs light up.   The  effective  energy  was much
              greater than that emitted by the generator.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Vangard notes...

           Keely students   will   recognize   the   true A discoverer   of
           interference and how intelligent application of it can result in
           constructive (harmonic) or destructive (enharmonic) interference
           to alter energy/mass flows.

           We know  that  Tesla  wrote a most vicious letter to Bloomfield-
           Moore (Keely's patroness) in  the  late  1880's  or early 1890's
           claiming Keely to be a total and complete fraud.

           It is interesting to note that Tesla carried out  NO research on
           MECHANICAL VIBRATORS  until  he came to this country.  Note also
           that he lived in New York, was highly literate and without doubt
           aware of the research of John  W.  Keely  in nearby Philadelphia
           through the at times massive press coverage of  Keely during the
           period of 1872 through 1898.

           Through the work of Tesla, the MECHANICAL VIBRATORS evolved into
           electrical devices   using   the   principles  of  SYMPATHY  and
           RESONANCE which Keely originally pioneered for practical results
           using only sound waves.

           It is our belief that Tesla made  himself  aware of Keely's work
           in a most detailed fashion and incorporated it in the MECHANICAL
           VIBRATORS of his early days.

           These later evolved into electrically driven devices which could
           do the  same  job  yet did not require the laborious  mechanical
           tuning which occupied so much of Keely's researches.

           Tesla's main  ORIGINAL  CONTRIBUTION  is  the  Rotating Magnetic
           field.  The  rest  is  a  result   of  high  plagiarization  and
           hybridization without due credit to his inspiration.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

           5)  When  the  plane  of  a  system performing  circular  motion
               (spinning system)  is  tilted very rapidly, there is also an
               energy absorption  from   the  Tachyon  Field.   Either  the
               gravitational acceleration   of  the  system   changes,   or
               electrical current is produced, or both.  In principle, this
               is known  as  the  Faraday  Disk  (rotating  magnet) and the
               Laithwaite spindle (mechanical  gyroscope  which  rotates at
               the periphery   of  a  central  gyroscope).    The   DePalma
               convertor, also  called  an  N-machine,  is  based  on  this
               principle.  At high revolutions it provides a direct current
               output which is greater than  that  required  to operate the
               generator.

           6)  If an electric field is directed into a coil  which is wound
               around an  iron  core, it develops magnetic forces.  This is
               the principle of the electromagnet.   The  coil  can also be
               wound in a specific way called a MOBIUS COIL, which is also


                                      Page 5

               known as  a  KLEINEAN  BOTTLE.  An electrical field directed
               into such a coil is "encaged"  and  RESULTS  IN MUCH GREATER
               ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION IN THE IRON CORE,  with respect to
               the energy  introduced,  than is the case for a conventional
               electromagnet.  The iron core  can then send out a VERY HIGH
               ENERGY TACHYON BEAM in the AXIAL DIRECTION,  which  can MELT
               METALS AND  ROCKS,  for  example.  Prof. Seike in particular
               dealt with this technology.   The  energy  derived  is  much
               greater than that required for induction.

           7)   According   to  Nieper's  theory,  all  so-called   natural
                accelerations can   be   referred   to   one  common  basic
                principle, which is that  these accelerations are caused by
                a DIRECTED TACHYON BRAKING EFFECT.  This  is  true  for the
                acceleration of   gravity,   as   well   as  electrostatic,
                magnetic, electromagnetic and radiesthetic accelerations.

                In principle, ALL accelerations  MUST  BE EXCHANGEABLE when
                experimentally manipulated.   For example,  electromagnetic
                acceleration can  be  exchanged  for  the  acceleration  of
                gravity.  This axiom also  explains the operating principle
                of the  Howard Johnson convertor, which  is  based  on  the
                usage of  the magnetic paradox.  According to this paradox,
                the work performed during  the  acceleration  of  a  magnet
                using an iron core is greater than the force  required  for
                sideways removal of the iron core.  The linear model of the
                Johnson convertor  was patented under U.S. patent 4,151,431
                after extensive testing at the beginning of January, 1980.

            8)  There is a special kind of  tachyon  energy conversion into
                heat, which  particularly affects biological  organisms.  A
                space which  is  enclosed  on  all  sides  by  a conducting
                membrane which can be charged,  leads  to such a conversion
                of tachyon  energy  into heat.  This also  applies  to  the
                cells of  the human organism.  The principle was discovered
                by Dr. Wilhelm Reich.  In  Germany  the  biophysicist, F.A.
                Popp, has  examined  these  questions.   This  "Orgone  Box
                Principle" will be pondered for long time.

                Based on  the  existing  convertors,  no  one can doubt the
                technical feasibility of  obtaining energy from the Tachyon
                Field.  Such  convertors  in  principle   could   be  built
                relatively simply   and  at  low  cost.   However,  certain
                scientific, financial and political efforts have to be made
                for large-scale  utilization   of   tachyon   energy.   The
                installation of large power plants and cross-country  lines
                and other  high-cost  infrastucture is not required, nor is
                the purchasing of fuel.
