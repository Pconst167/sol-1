Don't Examine This Too Closely
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Disco Inferno - The episode takes place during the filming of 'Earthquake', a
1974 motion picture. The date given, however, is 1976.

Good Morning, Peoria - Al is reflected off the station's glass.

Leap of Faith - The priest is reading about the kid who got killed by the 
train. He shows the headline to Sam, and to the right of the main story was a 
story about Bangladesh asking for flood assistance. The only problem was that 
the leap took place in 1963. Bangladesh didn't even become a country until 
1971. Before that, it was East Pakistan!!!

Lee Harvey Oswald - There are several errors, including a translated sentence
that begins with a lowercase letter. The date on the screen is clearly stated
to be February, 1999, minor until you consider that Al refers to "The Leap
Back", a leap that Sam should have forgotten AND takes place on September 18,
1999.

Dr Ruth - The episode takes place in 1985, but Al says that he checks on
6,000+ "Annies" in 1984. Also, the phone in the kitchen was off the hook. How
did she call 911 from the bedroom? Two lines in an apartment? Highly unlikely.
Also, it was highly unlikely that the kitchen phone became disconnected for
some reason (even with the cord unplugged, the receiver is still off the
hook).

Blood Moon - A girl passes out, and Sam takes the pulse...with his thumb!

Memphis Melody - When Sam Beckett told Elvis' mom that he would one day be
more famous than Perry Como or Pat Boone, she should have said to him, "Who
the Hell is Pat Boone?" Pat Boone was not around in 1954 and didn't hit the
music scene until about a year later. Oh, well.

Mirror Image - In this episode, it is a major plot point that Sam's birthday
is August 8, 1953. Yet, both "Play It Again, Seymore" and "The Amicanization
of Machiko" take place PRIOR to Sam's birthdate. Unless the producers are
taking a pro-life stance, this establishes that Sam already could leap outside
his lifetime. (Which episode was Sam's birthdate first mentioned?)
