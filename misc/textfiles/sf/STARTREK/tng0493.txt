                          Star Trek TNG List of Lists
                             compiled by Mark Holtz

   This is the Star Trek TNG List of Lists. It contains a listing of all the
episodes for "Star Trek: The Next Generation" TV series, plus some added
notes. (Due to length considerations, there is a separate TOS/TAS, Movies, and
DSN List of Lists) This list comes out around the 1st of every month with a
repost on the 16th, except July and August, when it will come out on the 1st
only. However, a posting may not come out due to events beyond my control.
   If you are wondering why I compile these lists, it is strictly out of the
enjoyment of "Star Trek", and have welcomed the wealth of information posted
by other fellow Star Trek fans who post on the electronic networks. After
being irritated by the ever constant requests for episode lists on Usenet, I
decided that, in the middle of 1990, to post a list of episodes on a regular
basis. It soon grew from that, and, with the contributions of other people,
these lists grew to what you see today. (And still growing). The only payment
I ask is thanks and contributions, I am not making a dime off these
compilations.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Death Train", with Patrick Stewart about terrorists taking over a train
containing a nuclear bomb, airs on the USA network on April 14th at 9 PM/8 PM
Central.

Lessons - Picard becomes romantically involved with a shipmate. At 3am, Picard
can't sleep and decides to get a drink and do some work, but Stellar
Cartography are using up all the computer power (hmmm....). When her gets down
to the lab to find out what's going on, he opens the door and ruins the
experiment. However, he and the Lieutenant Commander doing the work fall for
each other. (She is a pianist, and we have another scene with Data playing the
violin).

The Chase - Norman Lloyd (St Elsewhere) plays Picard's old archeology tutor.
He tries to talk Picard into leaving Starfleet and going off on some
mega-important dig with him. Lots of dilemma. Eventually, the ship gets roped
into this trip anyway. Loads of aliens: Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians and
some new ones. (Directed by Jonathan Frakes)

Frame of Mind - Riker is taking part in Bev's theatre group, playing a man in
an insane asylum. As time goes on, he inexplicably finds himself in a real
asylum, and the story mixes between these events. The others try to rescue
him, but he doesn't trust them. A 'what the heck's going on?' sort of story.

Suspicions - Dr Crusher is accused of murder. While she tries to investigate a
killing, a second murder takes place - and this time, she is the only one who
could have done it! Whoopi makes an appearance in his one.

Rightful Heir -  Worf goes to a Klingon spiritual world to seek some answers
(after Birthright). Gowron is in this episode, plus a *load* of Klingon
extras.

Second Chances - Tackles the Riker/Troi romance.  One guest star will be Mae
Jemison, who became the first African-American woman in space with her shuttle
voyage, will play a transporation engineer. The astronaut's real-life
credentials are breathtaking. SHe's an M.D., who also holds a degree in
chemical engineering from Cornell, and speaks Swahili, Japanese and Russian -
plus English, of course. Levar Burton directs.

- Next to last episode will be a time travel story.

Season Finalle - Yet another cliffhanger....with the BORG! Lore returns. Also,
Data will use the holodeck computer to fashion a poker game with great
physicists such as Albert Einstein, Issac Newton, and Stephen Hawking (as
himself).

Also scheduled....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Lwaxana Troi will be appearing in a episode.

* The Borgs have changed after 'I, Borg'.

* There will be an episode where the Klingon deity Kaylis (spelling unsure)
  seems to have returned. We will see Worf in what we would know as a
  meditation chamber. He will have a vision in which he sees her and is told
  of her return.  He must make sure, with the rest of the crew, that it is
  truly her and not an imposter.

Seventh Season
-============-
According to various published reports, the seventh season will be the final
season of TNG, and the series will be proceeding to movies.

Syndication Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Star Trek: The Next Generation" is a syndicated program that is sold to each
individual station. It is not part of the FOX network, although many stations
that have purchased TNG are also part of FOX. The production code numbers
begin with 101 in order to prevent confusion with the original Star Trek
series.

United States/Canada
-==================-
The first run episodes are uplinked to the local stations on the Saturday and
Sunday of the Satellite Date. This uplinking is done through Keystone
Communications (formerly WOLD Communications), through AT&T's Telstar 301
which is located at 96 degrees west. The program is uplinked at the following
times on Transponder 9-Vertical Polarity (5V):

Saturdays -  2:00 PM- 3:00 PM ET/11:00 AM-    Noon PT (D Feed)
Saturdays -  6:00 PM- 7:00 PM ET/ 3:00 PM- 4:00 PM PT (U Feed)
  Sundays -  2:00 PM- 3:00 PM ET/11:00 AM-    Noon PT (U Feed)
  Sundays -  5:00 PM- 6:00 PM ET/ 2:00 PM- 3:00 PM PT (D Feed)

The audio carriers are wide-band, and are: 6.2-left, 6.8-right, and 5.8-mono.
No scrambling is employed in the uplink. (With AT&T's Telstar 301, launched in
1983, reaching the end of it's life, and with only enough fuel to launch it
out of it's orbital slot, the feeds may be moved to AT&T's Telstar 302 (85
Degrees West) in the near future, and then to AT&T's Telstar 401, which is
slated to be launched in November of 1993 to replace Telstar 301.) The station
then airs the episode for the first time anytime during Paramount's official
week of (Monday through Sunday), although some stations (notable Paramount
owned ones) are able to show episodes the Sunday prior to the week-of, but
that requires special permission from Paramount.

The order of the uplink is as follows (from "Time's Arrow, Part II"):

* Slate with standard television color bars with text over it, saying:

  PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

     <<< STEREO >>>                  (The "<<< >>>" are flashing)
     STAR TREK #227
     18:00 - 19:00

                 TELSTAR 301/5V      (These three lines are in smaller text in
                    5:59:45 EDT      lower right hand corner of screen)
                       09/19/92

* Same slate, only time of feed is replaced by flashing "ROLL TAPES NOW"
* Color bars only
* Slate for promos for next weeks episode:

  PARAMOUNT TELEVISION
     STAR TREK: TNG
  PROMOS FOR EP. #228
     REALM OF FEAR
    ALL NEW EPISODE
      :30/:10/:05
       FULL MIX

(Full mix means that the promos have full music and Paramount narrator)

(If this is a repeat episode, the "ALL NEW EPISODE" is replaced with "NEXT
EXCITING EPISODE". Also, the production numbers have a "R" on the end of
them).

* :30, :10, :05 Promos for following week's episode-Full Mix
* Slate showing title of episode:

    TIME'S ARROW,PTII

        SHOW #227
        09/21/92

(The 09/21/92 simply indicates the first day of Paramount's official week of
for the airing of that episode)

* Teaser
* Opening credits
* 4 - :30 Commercials
* Act I
* 2 - :30 Commercials and black spot for local commercials
* Act II
* Black spot for commercials
* Act III
* 1 - :15 Commercial, 3 - :30 Commercials, 1 - :15 Commercial

* Closing Credits
* "Paramount/A Paramount Communications Company" Logo
* Slate for promos for next week episode (same as above, only substitute
  PRODUCTION TRACKS instead of FULL MIX).
* :30/:10/:05 Promos. The production track promos are identical to the full
  mix promos except that there are limited sound effects, characters speaking,
  and no music. The local station adds in their own music and narration.

It is currently against Paramount contract to cut short the closing credits
and the Paramount logo in first-run episodes. If your station is cutting the
credits or is cutting the episodes, then write to both the offending station 
and:

     Paramount Pictures Corporation
     TV Syndication and Promotion
     5555 Melrose Ave.
     Los Angeles, CA  90038

The episodes from seasons one through five are currently available for daily
syndication from Paramount television. (Some stations, with the unavailability
of "Time's Arrow II" in daily syndication, may elect not to air "Time's
Arrow".) With the exception of "Encounter At Farpoint", there is no editing by
Paramount television in order to make room for more commercials. Any such
editing is being done by your local station. "Encounter At Farpoint" is being
distributed as a two-part episode, with several scenes being moved around,
some other scenes being shortened or cut, and some of the audio being changed.

Currently, it is permissible for Star Trek: The Next Generation to be subject
to "Syndication Exclusivity" rules. Thus, if, on your local cable system, both
your local station and a out of town station both carry TNG, your local
station can have the out of town station's TNG broadcasts be blacked out on
cable.

Beginning with the fourth season, the episodes were recorded with Dolby 
Surround for rear speaker sounds (but is 100% compatible with stereo sets).  
If your station broadcasts TNG in stereo, yet, sometimes during the broadcast, 
the audio seems to disappear during the broadcast for a couple of seconds or 
seems to be coming out of the wrong channels, then you have a problem which 
can only be corrected at the broadcast station. Call up your local station and 
talk with the chief engineer. Tell him (or her) that Star Trek: The Next 
Generation, starting in the fourth season, has Dolby Surround as part of the 
stereo audio. This Dolby Surround information is confusing the "audio
anti-phase detector", and that the detector should be removed to avoid future 
problems with the TNG audio.  Then, thank the Chief Engineer for his time.

England/United Kingdom
-====================-
The series was being broadcast on BBC2 Wednesdays at 6 PM, however, they have
stopped after the airing of the two-part episode "The Best of Both Worlds".
However, some notes on the following episodes:

* "Conspiracy" - The scene with the mother creature is edited out.

* "The Icarus Factor" - The pain sticks ceremony is heavily edited.

* "Shades of Gray" - The flashbacks include the scene from "Conspiracy" with
  the mother creature....intact!

* "The High Ground" - This episode is unaired because the theme of the
  episode, terrorism, could cause problems. In this episode, Data makes a
  reference to a successful use of terrorism in 2017.

Sky Television now holds the rights to broadcast TNG, and has restored scenes 
cut from the above episodes. However, they will NOT be showing "The High 
Ground" for the same reasons as the BBC.

  style chairs.

Stardates
~~~~~~~~~
After the random stardates in the original "Star Trek", the powers that be
decided on a more logical way to determine a stardate. Thus, the following 
came about.

EXAMPLE: "Captains Log: Stardate 45076.3"

The "4" represents that the series takes place in the 24th century, according
to an original writer's guide, although Deep Space Nine may change that. It 
also has been noted that 1000 stardates pass with every year.
The "5" represents the season number of TNG without exception.
The "076" represents the portion of a season that advances during TNG.
The ".3" represents a portion of a day thereof.

During the pre-recorded sub-space messages and recorded logs of away teams,
both the current stardate and the current time (in 24-hour military format, 
down to the second) are shown on the bottom of the screen. ("The Defector", 
"Identity Crisis")

Working Titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Unconditional Return" -> "11001001"
"The Shroud" -> "Skin of Evil"
"Time To The Second" -> "Time Squared"
"Send In The Clones" -> "Up The Long Ladder"
"Beyond Tomorrow" -> "Legacy"
"When Honor is Lost" -> "Reunion"
"Paradise" -> "The Host"
"Civil Wars" -> "Half A Life"
"Breaking Up Is Hard To Do" -> "In Theory"
"Barriers" -> "New Ground"
"Terror In Ten-Forward" -> "Power Play"
"Q and I" -> "Q-Me" -> "True Q"

What is canon?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
According to various sources, this is what is considered acceptable, or canon,
for potential TNG episodes:
* Almost all of the original series (except for obvious conflicts)
* All of Star Trek: The Motion Picture
* Most of Star Trek II, III, IV, and VI
* All of the TNG episodes
* "TNG Technical Manual" by Mike Okuda and Rick Sternbach

The following is not acceptable:
* Star Trek (The Animated Series)
* Star Trek V: The Final Frontier
* All Star Trek Novels (yes, even the ones Gene Roddenberry wrote)
* All fanzines and fan written material
* Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise
* Worlds Of The Federation
* All FASA Material

Ranks and Insignia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the next generation, the following uniform colors represent which division
a person is in:

    Medical Corps and Sciences - Navy Blue (?)
      Security and Engineering - Mustard Yellow
        Command and Navigation - Wine Red

Vice Admiral - Gold rectangle with three circle in it. (Redemption II and
Chain of Command I).  (UV_

Captain - Four solid gold circles

Commander - three solid gold circles

Lieutenant Commander - two solid gold circles and one empty gold circle

Lieutenant - two solid gold circles

Lieutenant (Junior Grade) - One solid gold circle and one empty

Ensign - One solid gold circle

- Two silver rectangles (worn by Kosinski in "Where No One Has Gone Before")

Cadet - Various black stripes depending on group assignment. (First Duty)

NOTE: During seasons one or two, some of the pips were in silver.

NOTE: There have been inaccuracies with the pips and ranks, especially with
the rank of O'Brien.

According to Gene Roddenberry, there are no enlisted ranks in Starfleet.
However, in "Family", Sergei Rozhenko (Worf's foster father) mentions
something about meeting another Chief Petty Officer. Later on, in the same
episode, Sergei mentions that he, an enlisted man, managed to raise an
officer. Also, in "The Drumhead", the part-Romulan part-Human medical
technician said that he was so anxious to get into space, he decided to forgo
the Academy and, instead, become enlisted. This will indeed contradict what
Gene has said.

In "Future Imperfect", some of the ranks in effect 15 years from season 4 are:

Admiral - Four Gold Bars
Captain - Four Silver Bars

The other ranks are based upon the "normal" TNG ranks. They are formed by 
substituting a bar for a solid circle and a narrow bar for an empty circle. 
The rank is part of the insignia/communicator.

ship from death for trying to change the society of Angel One.

"Pen Pals" - Data communicates with a girl whose planet was slowly 
self-destructing.

"Up the Long Ladder" - Picard essentially forced the clone race to live and 
breed with the Bringloidi, despite the strong resistance of the clone race and 
the fact that this would completely destroy the non-sexual nature of the clone 
race.

"The Ensigns of Command" - The Enterprise manages to delay a Sheliak vessel
from destroying a Federation colony on Tau Cygna Five, even though the planet
is part of the Sheliak Corporate.

Remember Me - Wesley's experiment causes his mother to be trapped in a warp
bubble.

The First Duty - Wesley's flight team perform an extremely dangerous maneuver
which results in a serious accident and causes the death of a fellow team
member. The resulting coverup causes Wesley to repeat a year at the academy.

Several times during the series, a major character has died, only to be saved
at the last minute. Some of these episodes include:

Hide and Q - Worf and Wesley get impaled by a soldier.

Time Squared - The Enterprise is seen being destroyed.

addiction withdrawal in the second part.

"A Fistful Of Datas" - Troi, playing the mysterious stranger, is seen smoking

Saucer Separation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The TNG Enterprise, being a starship carrying families, has the ability to
separate into a saucer and warp drive section in case of an emergency
situation. When separated, the saucer section is capable of only impulse
speed, while the warp drive section turns into a formidable battle machine.

"Encounter at Farpoint" - While Worf takes the saucer section to Farpoint
Station, Picard takes the warp drive section to meet up with the Q entity.

"Arsenal of Freedom" - Geordi takes the Warp Drive section in order to destroy
the defense device on Minos, while Chief Engineer Logan takes the saucer
section to safety.

"Best of Both Worlds - Part II" - In order to retrieve Locutus/Picard, the
Enterprise separates into two sections, with Riker in charge of the Warp Drive
section, and Cmdr. Shelby in command of the saucer section. While the Borg
attack the warp drive section, the rescue shuttle with Worf and Data launches
from the saucer section.

Shuttlecraft
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following shuttlecraft, associated with the Enterprise, have appeared in
TNG:

NCC-1701D-1 - "Sakarov" ("Unnatural Selection")
NCC-1701D-2 - "Goddard" (loaned to Scotty in "Relics")
NCC-1701D-5 - "El-Baz" (Time Squared)
NCC-1701D-5 - "Onizuka" (used in "The Ensigns of Command")
NCC-1701D-5 - Feynman ("The Nth Degree")
NCC-1701D-6 - ("Coming of Age")
NCC-1701D-7 - "Onizuka" ("The Minds Eye")
NCC-1701D-9 - ("The Price")
NCC-1701D-12 - "Pike" (destroyed in "The Most Toys")
NCC-1701D-13 - (crashed on Vegra II in "Skin of Evil")
- "Fermi" (Distroyed - "Rascals")

Other shuttlecraft from other ships....

NCC-2544-10 - (shuttle from USS Repulse, "The Child")
NCC-45167 - "Cousteau" (from the Aries, "Identity Crisis")

In "Unnatural Selection", Data states explicitly that he is fully trained to
pilot all current Federation vessels, including auxiliaries (namely
Shuttlecraft). We've also seen Ro, Riker, Picard, Wesley, Geordi, and Worf fly
shuttles, but Data seems to be the crew's "driver."

In the episode "Power Play", Chief O'Brien mentions that some of the
shuttlecraft are equipped with transporters, as demonstrated earlier with "The
Best of Both Worlds - Part II".

Attempts at Self-Destruct
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"11001001" - Picard and Riker try to self destruct in order to prevent the
possibility of the Enterprise falling into enemy hands.

"Where Silence Has Lease" - Picard tries to self destruct for Nagilum.

"Contagion" - Virus-induced sort-of-self-destruct-like-thing.

"Brothers" - Picard attempts to engage the self-destruct sequence in order to
regain control of the Enterprise, but fails.

Time Travel
~~~~~~~~~~~
"We'll Always Have Paris" - Dr. Paul Manheim's time experiment causes small
loops to occur in time.

"Time Squared" - Due to a strange energy vortex, a duplicate Picard from the
future arrives on a shuttlecraft

"Yesterday's Enterprise" - A worm hole is created, causing the Enterprise-C to
travel through time.

"Captain's Holiday" - Two Vorgons travel from the 27th century to get the Tox
Uthat.

"Future Imperfect" - Riker thinks he's in the future

"A Matter Of Time" - Berlinghoff Rasmussen, in the 22nd century, steals a time
machine from a visiting time traveler from the 26th century, and uses it to
visit the Enterprise and steal some devices to "invent" later on.

"Cause and Effect" - The Enterprise and the Bozeman gets caught in a time
loop. For the Enterprise, it was for around 17 days. For the Bozeman, it was
either caught in the loop for around 80 years, or simply shot forward in time 
about 80 years.

"Time's Arrow" - Upon discovery of Data's head on Earth, the crew of the
Enterprise travel to a planet. In order to see the aliens/shapeshifters, Data
constructs a phase inverter, and, in the process, manages to travel to 1893.
At the end of this episode, Picard, Riker, Troi, Dr. Crusher, and Geordi walk
into the time vortex.

Also, the Traveler ("Where None Have Gone Before" and "Remember Me") could be
considered a time traveler. Maybe.

Enterprise Exceeds Warp Limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Enterprise is able to only achieve Warp 9.5 "with extreme risk" (Encounter
at Farpoint). However, there have been various times when this 'speed limit'
has been exceeded.

"Where No One Has Gone Before" - In a warp field experiment with the Traveler,
Wesley's distraction caused the Traveler to phase in and out, and causes the
Enterprise to travel 2.7 million light years in a few seconds.

"When The Bough Breaks" - When Captain Picard insists that the Aldean people
return the children kidnapped from the Enterprise, the Enterprise is hit with

TOS/TMS Crossovers In TNG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While TNG is supposed to take place 78 years after the original series, there 
have been occasions in which various characters and actors have appeared in 
either the original series or movies, and then reappeared on TNG. Among these 
are....

"Encounter At Farpoint" - DeForest Kelley makes an appearance as an unnamed 
admiral who hates transporters and notices that Data, with all that knowledge, 
doesn't have pointed ears.

"The Naked Now" - The records from the original Enterprise ("The Naked Time")
were used to combat a microbe that causes drunk-like effects.

"Symbiosys" - Merritt Butrick was T'Jon "Symbiosis", and, of course, appeared
as Kirk's son David Marcus in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek
III: The Search For Spock. (After his appearance in TNG, Merritt Butrick died
due to complications to AIDS)

"Sarek" - Mark Lenard makes an appearance as Sarek.

"Unification" - Leonard Nimoy makes an appearance as Spock, as well as Mark
Lenard as Sarek. Also, Malachi Throne, who played Romulan Senator Pardek in
"Unification", was also involved in TOS's "The Managerie" as Commodose Jose
Mendez.

"Relics" - Scotty modified the transporter so that the transporter buffer is
recycled and the rematerialization subroutine is disabled so that the two 
survivors of the Jenolin could survive while waiting for a rescue. 75 years
later, the Enterprise reactivates the transporter, and Scotty is the lone
survivor, without aging.

Kirk has been mentioned in "The Naked Now", "Unification II", and "Relics".

Also: Diana Muldaur, a guest star on TOS episodes "Return To Tomorrow" as Dr.
Ann Mulhall and "Is There In Truth No Beauty" as Dr. Miranda Jones, appeared
on a regular basis as Dr. Pulaski during the second season of TNG. Majel
Barrett, who played Number One ("The Cage") and Doctor/Nurse Chapel, is used
as the TNG computer voice, and has appeared as Deanna Troi's mother, Lwaxana
Troi.

Convention Hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Patrick Stewart - May or may not allow taping of convention appearance. He
considers convention appearances to be a personal experience to be shared with 
those in the audience.

Brent Spiner - He is very protective of his privacy, and rarely makes 
convention appearances, partially due to a bad experience with a fan at a 
convention in New York. He does not allow the video taping or the 
photographing of convention appearances.

Gates McFadden - Do not videotape convention appearance.

Wil Wheaton - He doesn't allow videotaping. The explanation for this was that 
someone had taped him before and sold these tapes without his consent or 
paying him.

Michael Dorn - "I don't LIKE prune juice, Worf likes prune juice, I don't."

Marina Sirtis - While she does allow for videotaping of her convention 
appearances, she reminds everyone that videotaping is a privilege, and not a 
right. No flash photography when Q&A starts. Also, she has no idea about how
the pips work, nothing about Engineering, why Worf changed uniform color, and
similar topics.

Please remember, these actors are taking their personal time in order to
appear at conventions. Some of these actors do not give out autographs, others 
do. The "no videotaping" rule is due to the fact that some unscrupulous people 
tape the convention appearances and then resell the tapes without royalties
going to the actors.

Money In The Future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Encounter At Farpoint" - Beverly Crusher buys a roll of cloth, and has her
account on the Enterprise billed.

"Conspiracy" - The planet where the Starship Captains meet is Ditalics B, and 
is said to be owned by Ditalics Mining Corporation, which may imply something 
of the Federation's economic structure.

"The Neutral Zone" - Picard mentions that they no longer use money.

"Manhunt" - Picard, while on the holodeck running the Dixon Hill program, goes
to the bar to buy a drink. He, of course, forgot to bring money, and the lady
had to pay for the drinks.

"The Price" - There is a bidding war going on for the use of a wormhole, and
Picard mentions how much toll the Ferengi might charge if they get the rights
to use that wormhole.

"A Matter Of Perspective" - Dr. Apgar's reason for developing the Krieger wave
generator was to sell it to the highest bidder.

"Unification II" - When Riker enters the bar, he is asked to toss a couple of
coins into the jar for a song. Riker responds that he doesn't have any money.

Religion In The Future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Who Watches The Watchers" - Picard is thought to be a god by the populace.

"Data's Day" - In Data's log, a Hindu festival of lights is mentioned.

Did you know . . .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. . . That Geordi LaForge is named after a real Star Trek fan named George
LaForge? George LaForge died from muscular dystrophy in 1975.

. . . That Denise Crosby originally tried out for the role of Counselor Troi
and Marina Sirtis tried out for the role of Security Chief Tasha Yar?

. . . That Gene Roddenberry's full name is Eugene Wesley Roddenberry, thus, in
creating Wesley Crusher, Gene used his own middle name and based the character
on what he wanted to be like when he was young?

. . . Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) did the special effect shots only for
"Encounter At Farpoint". However, they get credit in every episode because of 
the extra stock footage for Enterprise flybys and such. Even ILM stock footage
isn't used much anymore, except when the Enterprise enters Warp.

. . . TNG is filmed in 35mm using Panavision cameras. The film is transferred
to videotape, and post-production is done on video.

. . . That William Riker and Deanna Troi is based upon Ilia and Decker from
"Star Trek: The Motion Picture"?

. . . That while "Skin of Evil" was aired after "Symbiosis", they were
produced in the reverse order. Near the end of Symbiosis, when the Ornarans 
and Brekkians beam off, Denise Crosby is seen in the background, waving
goodbye as the doors close. (UV)

. . . That "Star Trek: The Next Generation" has made over $500,000,000 in 
syndication and merchandising.

. . . That if you look closely at the Enterprise during the fly-by in the
opening credits, you can see someone walking past the windows. According to
Mike Okuda in the "Star Trek: The Official Fan Club Magazine" (#60), this is
Captain Picard.

. . . "The Child" and "Devil's Due" were originally scripts for the proposed
"Star Trek: Phase II" television series. The "Star Trek: Phase II" series idea
was scrapped, and instead, the sets were used for the shooting of "Star Trek:
The Motion Picture"

. . . At the time of the filming of "Q Who", there were two visual supervisors
at the time: Dan Curry and Rob Legato. They each had their own specifications
for the design of the Borg ship:

Rob Legato - The Borg ship should be a ball with a trench of detail around the
             middle.

Dan Curry - The Borg ship should be a cube that looked smooth at a distance.
            As you got closer and closer, more detail would be revealed the
            closer you got. (Dan had hired Special Effects for this job).

Rob Legato team had some problems, so Special Effects got the job and built
the Borg ship. It took 14 modelers 2 weeks to finish the job. That is  nothing
short of amazing when you consider that while the specifications called for
only one side finished, Special Effects supplied a Borg ship that was finished
on all sides. In order to that level of detail, F/X put everything they could
find, including R2-D2, toy soldiers, plastic model "rails", and the F/X logo.

. . . The junkyard in "Unification II" consisted mostly of ships dragged out
from wherever Mike Okuda could find 'em. Some of the models included: models
from the unmade first Star Trek movie (years before Star Trek: The Motion
Picture), models from ILM that were never used, models of the Enterprise that
didn't come out of the mold right, and a very unusual looking Enterprise.
Some of the models were designed by Greg Jein and Robert McCall.

. . . "A Matter Of Time" was written partially because Robin Williams, a fan
of the show, wanted to appear. However, when the script was ready for
shooting, Robin was unavailable, so Matt Frewer was cast instead.

. . . That the shuttle Onizuka, which Data used in "Ensigns of Command", was
named in tribute to one of the Space Shuttle "Challenger" astronauts.

. . . During the fifth season, a thirty-second ad during one of the show's 10
national ad slots in a first-run episode costs $200,000.

. . . Gene died at the same time the crew was filming "Hero Worship"?

. . . The only episodes when William Riker was called Bill was in "The Naked
Now" and "Haven"?

. . . Gates McFadden's stunts in "Remember Me" was done when she was pregnant
but she did not know about it until days later.

. . . For "Relics", only the turbolift door, the command chair,
helm/navigation, Scotty's station, and possibly part of the station portward
of it were reconstructed for this episode. The rest was stock footage from
TOS's "The Mark of Gideon".

. . . In "Booby Trap", the original name of the holographic scientist was to
be Leah Daystrom, who was the great-great-great-daughter of Dr. Daystrom from
TOS. However, after they cast Susan Gibney for the part, they changed the name
to Brahms, and only made several references to The Daystrom Institute.

. . . Andy Probert designed the Enterprise D, and owns the designs to the
Enterprise. Paramount is using his designs with permission. You can see Andy
in "Encounter At Farpoint", in the post-atomic court. Andy is the spectator
wearing "a giant tribble", actually a very large fur hat.

. . . The original 8-foot model of the Enterprise that was built by Industrial
Light and Magic isn't used much anymore. For motion control work, the 4-foot
model is much easier to use, is much more detailed, and, for far away shots,
it's easier to make it seem far away. The original 8-foot model isn't used
except for extreme closeups or for saucer separations. The 4-foot model was
built by Greg Jein in the third season.

. . . The title "The Dauphin" comes from the French term "Le Dauphin", and is
used to designate the heir to the royal throne (if the royalty was still in
place in France).

. . . The reason that you keep seeing a lot of the same faces on TNG,
Civil Wars, and (I think) L.A. Law is that the casting is all handled by the
same casting director, Junie Lowrey-Smith (not sure of this name either), who
likes to reuse a lot of the same actors.

. . . "Family" is the only episode in TOS, the movies, and TNG which has no
scenes filmed on the bridge.

. . . In order to prepare for the episode "Chain Of Command, Part II", Patrick
Stewart watched tapes from Amnesty International. These tapes included 
statements of those who had been tortured, and a long interview with a 
torturer who talked about what it was like to be inflicting pain.

. . . The transporter effect is accomplished as follows:
1> Fill a canister with water. Add glitter and shine a light through it. Stir
   briskly and tape.
2> Film the scene, first with the actor, then without. (Or vice versa)
3> Transfer the scene to tape, and use video technology to matte the glitter
   over the actor.
4> Use a video wipe to 'streak down' the glitter.

. . . The translation from "11001001" after Riker introduces them:
Minuet: "Hi!, it's nice to meet you."
Picard: "You are from paris?"
Minuet: "Deep down we're all from paris."
Picard: "Ah yes, deep down we're all from paris."

. . . The translation from "Time's Arrow":
Data (in English): "I am a Frenchman."

Poker Player: "Ah, mes parents sont originaires de Boubonnais. Je suis ne a la
New Orleans." / "Ah, my parents are from Boubonnais. I was born in New
Orleans."

Data: "Alors nous sommes presque freres. Je suis heureuz de vous connaitre." /
"Then, we are almost brothers. I am pleased to meet you."

Poker Player (in English): "Please sir..."

. . . According to a November, 1992 issue of "California Business" article,
Paramount's annual first-run TNG gross advertising revenues are about $90
million, with production costs in the $31.2-$36.4 million range.  Net annual
advertising profits are between $30 and $60 million, without even counting the
$70 million+ in licensing and affiliate station fees. TNG airs in 217 markets,
with a 99% national coverage. Weekly viewership is in the 20 million range,
bring in the most desirable of demographics.

In-Jokes
~~~~~~~~
"The Naked Now" - During the scan of records, we see a parrot wearing a
Starfleet shirt, complete with insignia, with nacelles, an obvious reference
to Gene Roddenberry. ("The Great Bird" = Gene) This same screen also reappears
in "Conspiracy".

"11001001" - The 11001001 is binary, and is converted to 201 decimal, or hex 
C9. Under the Z-80 microprocessor series (the Z-80 was used in the TRS-80 
Model I, III, and IV, and for the sound processing in the Sega Genesis), the 
C9, in assembly language, is known as "Unconditional Return."

"Conspiracy" - The topographical map of the planetary surface was a "very
shakey" drawing of Kei and Yuri. Yuri is on the right side, and Kei is upside
down.....

"The Neutral Zone" - On the family tree of Clare Raymond, which is recalled by
Troi, there are references to various shows, including: W. Hartnell m. P.
Troughton (DW), J. Pertwee m. T. Baker (DW), and P. Davison m. C. Baker (DW),
and J-L. Picard m. W. Riker. Other references include Gilligan's Island and
M*A*S*H.

"The Child" - In this episode, Doctor Pulanski refers to "Cyano Acrylates",
which are the active ingredient for SuperGlue, as a possible source of the 
Ikner radiation that was causing the plague samples to grow.

"Loud As A Whisper" - (DP) The conference table, "made to resemble indigenous
rock", had various markings on them. Most notable to Lovely Angels/Dirty Pair
fans are the marking "Kei" and "Yuri".

"The Measure Of A Man" - When Riker is showing off Data's arm to the JAG
representative, there is a pad on her desk which lists Data's parts, including
"Nausican Valve" and "Totoro Interface". Also, it is noted that part of Data's
construction is made out of something called "Yurium". (DP)

"The Dauphin" - In this episode, Daled 4 is a planet's name. Daled is the
fourth letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and has the numeric value of four. (UV)

"Contagion" - The Iconian artifact has various markings on it, including "Kei
and Yuri" (DP), "Dirty Pair" (DP), "Gundam" and "Totoro." Also, the various 
views as seen through the portal include: Toronto's City Hall and Nathan 
Phillip's Square (depicting the arches over the reflecting pool/skating rink), 
and Toronto's City Council Chambers. Also, in this episode, the Romulan ship 
that attacked the Enterprise was named the "Harkonnen", which just happens to 
be the name of the family that attacked the Atriedes family in the Dune 
series. In this episode, another Galaxy Class Starship is mentioned. . . the 
Yamato. This was originally the flagship of the Japanese fleet that fought in 
World War II at both the Coral Sea and Midway before it was sunk by Torpedo 
Bombers from an American carrier. Many years later, a Japanese Animation
series was done up, in which a battleship is reconfigured to become a starship
in order to recover something called the "Cosmo DNA". This series was called
"Starship Yamato", however, this series was known in the United States as 
"Star Blazers".

"The Icarus Factor" - The TNG art department had a field day putting in 
in-jokes. The mat has the chinese character of "sei", or "star" (as in "starry 
sky". The two scrolls hanging on the walls say, in Japanese syllabic 
characters (hiragana), "urusei yatsura", a pun of "ususai yatsura" ("noisy 
neighbors" or "annoying neighbors", a Japanese animation. Also, while lunging
at Riker, Riker's father says (in a terrible accent), "youroshiku
onegaishimasu", literally saying "Please do me the favor of being kind to me", 
but has the meaning of the English phrase "Pleased to meet you." Various other 
markings include "Kei" (DP), "Yuri" (DP), "Akira", and "Tonari No Totoro". In 
addition, the scrolls hanging on the walls also say, "Ataru", "Lum", and 
"Uresai Yatsura".

"Samaritan Snare" - Picard mentions "Nausicaans" in a conversation with Wesley
on the shuttlecraft.

"Up The Long Ladder" - When Picard is looking at the list of ships trying to
find the Mariposa, another ship listed is the Buckaroo Banzai captained by 
John Whorfin and built by the company that the red Lectroids had made. The 
same company name was seen on the USS Hathaway (Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems 
(of Grover's Mill, NJ :-) )

"Hollow Pursuits" - The anti-grav units contain a flux capacitor. Nothing big,
until you consider that the flux capacitor was a essential part of the
DeLorean/Time Machine in "Back To The Future".

"Menage a Troi" - The Ferengi Security code begins with "Kei Yuri" (DP).

"Transfigurations" - (DW) In the sick bay, against the wall, there is an
outline of the top portion of the TARDIS, upside down. Also, three roundals
can be seen against the wall. They show up again in several episodes after
this one.

"Legacy" - A label on a nuclear reactor says, "Remember, you can never add TOO
MUCH water to a Nuclear Reactor." Starlog #__ includes a complete picture of 
the reactor, including some of the rules (some of them hysterical)

"Qpid" - The scene where Worf smashes Geordi's lute, then says "Sorry" is
completely reminiscent of a scene in Animal House at a toga party. Also,
Princess Bride fans might want to note that the dialog during the sword fight
with Picard/Robin Hood, where he says "There is something you should know . .
. . I'm not from Nottingham.", is reminiscent of a sword fight in the movie
where similar dialog is uttered.

"Half A Life" - One of the displays has the number "4077" in the corner, an 
reference to M*A*S*H.

"In Theory" - The line "Now would be a good time", spoken by Picard, is
completely reminiscent from Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, which, in turn, was
used by Kirk during "The Doomsday Machine". Also, while it is not be visible
in the actual show, someone on the production crew re-labeled the shuttle pod
"PONTIAC NCC-1701-D".

"Darmok" - The writers were playing around with the words in this episode, 
with DARMOK, the letters reversed, becomes KOMRAD (comrade). JILARD also 
becomes JLpIcARD. Also, Gilgamesh is based upon Gilgamesh (from Sumerian
lore), a character described as a combination of Solomon, Ulysses, and
Hercules combined into one. One of the important factor's after his friend's
death is Gilgamesh's fear of death, although never playing a factor in battle,
results in his constant search for immortality, but, in one manner or another, 
comes very close, but always manages to miss.

"The Outcast" - Among the technical phrases used, "Reverse the polarity of the 
neutron flow" was a phrase commonly used by the third doctor (Jon Pertwee) 
during Doctor Who. (UV)

"The Next Phase" - One of the control panels on the Romulan Ship looks
somewhat like the TARDIS control console (DW). (V)

"Relics" - With Scotty on board, there are plenty of references to the old
series. For instance, the "miracle worker" bit comes from Star Trek III. The
"It is green" bit comes from TOS "By Any Other Name".

"Aquiel" - The name of the Klingon battlecruiser that meets with the E is the
Qu'vatlh (proper spelling, badly pronounced by Picard). This is listed in the
Klingon Dictionary on page 58 as one of the Klingon curses.

- Other in-jokes, albeit unseen, include: Shuttlecraft "Pontiac" and "Indiana
Jones" on operations board; crew quarters for Lt. Luke Skywalker.

Doctor Who (DW): A cult British Science Fiction series which ran on BBC1 from
November 23, 1963 to December, 1989. The title character is known only as "The
Doctor", a time lord who travels through time and space in a TARDIS (Time And
Relative Dimensions In Space). The TARDIS is bigger on the inside than on the
outside, and can change outward appearance, however, the Doctor's TARDIS,
being a broken down Type-40, is stuck in the shape of blue British Police Call
Box. The Doctor himself can, at point of death, regenerate into a totally
different body and personality. The series can be seen on several PBS stations
and the USA/Sci-Fi Channel weekday mornings at 9 AM PT/Noon ET.

Lovely Angels/Dirty Pair (DP): A Japanese anime series where the two main
characters, "Kei" and "Yuri", are members of World Welfare Foundation. Their
job is to take care of problems that crop up. However, they usually leave the
place in worse shape then they arrived, and it's usually not their fault. The
series itself has had TOS in-jokes in it also.

Shakespeare
~~~~~~~~~~~
It is well known that Patrick Stewart is a Shakepearean actor from England. 
However, several references to Shakespeare appear on TNG. [No, I don't know 
what the numbering scheme is]

"Encounter at Farpoint" - Picard says, "Kill all the lawyers!", which comes
from "2 Henry VI 4.2.74".

"The Naked Now" - Data says, "When you prick me do I not . . . leak?". This is
paraphrased from "Merchant of Venice 3.1.60-61".

"Hide and Q" - Q says, "All the galaxy's a stage," to which Picard replies:
"World, not galaxy, all the world's a stage." The reference is from "As You
Like It 2.7.139", with the entire passage from "As You Like It 2.7.139-165".

"The Defector" - At the beginning of the episode, there is a scene on the
holodeck where Data performs a scene from Henry V, when the King mingles with
his troops shortly before the Battle of Agincourt. 
   The entire scene is from "Henry V 4.1.84-157", although some lines were cut
out. Originally written for the King and three soldiers (Court, Williams, and
Bates), the author of the episode combined Court and Williams into one role,
represented here as Williams. Williams, incidentally, was played by
Shakespearean actor Patrick Stewart.
   Later in the episode, Picard quotes from Williams' speech, which is from
"Henry V 4.1.142-144".

"Sins of the Father" - The title comes from the "Merchant of Venice 3.5.1-2", 
with the entire passage from "Merchant of Venice 3.5.1-7".

"Menage A Troi" - Picard sets about wooing Lwaxana Troi back from Daimon Tog.
In the process, he delivers a Shakespeare mish-mash from Sonnets 147, 141, 18,
116, and Othello 5.2.13-15.

"Remember Me" - The title is from "Hamlet 2.5.89-92 & 111-113" with the entire 
passage from "Hamlet 1.5.89-113".

Differences in "Encounter At Farpoint"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, "Encounter At Farpoint" is being distributed in both a two-part
form and a two-hour movie form. The two-hour movie was shown as the first
episode of TNG, the repeat was shown as a two-part episode. Currently, the
stations that are showing TNG as a daily syndicated program have "Encounter At
Farpoint" as a two-part episode.

Unfortunately, the two-part episode is heavily butchered. Among the changes
from the two-hour movie version:

* The movie version starts out with the credits, the two-parter starts out
  with a teaser instead.

* In the movie version, Riker sees what happens in two sections.  In the 
  two-parter, the second section is cut out.

* The two-parter had the rejoining of the saucer section with the warp drive
  section being majorly edited.

* A section where Picard is talking to Dr. Crusher about Wesley is cut.

* A scene where Geordi talks to Dr. Crusher about his VISOR was moved to part
  two. It appeared in the first half of the movie version.

* Some of the audio was changed, and somewhat "sweetened" (Mike Brown term),
  in the two-part version.

To add additional confusion, Paramount has officially retired the two-hour
movie, and has made available for the videotape and laserdisc series an
unbutchered two-part episode of "Encounter At Farpoint."

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Opening Credits (1st & 2nd Season) - During the opening sequence, the graphics
are a departure from the Sol system, beginning with Earth with the sun in the
background, and featuring fly-bys of Jupiter and Saturn. During this sequence,
the camera pans right, and we see sunlight off the left side of Earth and
Jupiter, but the right side of Saturn, indicating that Saturn is backlit. (UV)

Opening Credits (From Third Season On) - During the opening sequence, at the
end of the planets, watch closely the starfields. The stars go in two
completely different directions.

"Code Of Honor" - While on the planet, watch Deanna's arms. In the group
shots, Deanna's arms are at her sides, while, in the close-ups, her arms are
behind her back. (UV)

"Datalore" - Upon beaming down to the planet's surface, Commander Riker gives 
the stardate as 4124.5. A little later, Captain Picard gives it as 41242.45.  
(V) Also, the glass of champagne Lore pours for Data goes flat immediately 
before Data picks it up thanks to the time that passed between the times the
two parts of the scene were filmed. (It goes flat as the travelling wipe
crosses it) (UV)

"Skin Of Evil" - When Riker is being pulled into Armus, the away team runs
towards Armus. However Geordi drops his phaser into Armus. When Captain Picard
beams onto the planet, the away team is standing around calmly, and Geordi's
phaser is back in his pocket. (Either the phaser didn't get THAT dirty, or
they beamed down another one quickly) (UV) Also, the computer-generated
picture Worf is looking at within the first minutes of "Skin of Evil" is the
very same as the one you can see twice later: It contains already this graph
of Armus' energy-level (or whatever it's meant to represent) with the same ups
and downs Troi is causing much later in the show!

"Conspiracy" - At the beginning of the episode, while Picard is asleep, Riker
tells LaForge to increase speed to Warp 6. Laforge replies, "Aye Sir, full
impulse." 

"Loud As A Whisper" - Data has learned sign language and is now interpreting
what the mediator is saying. Data quotes the mediator as saying "My friends 
have died" or something like that, before it is even signed. (V)

"Measure of a Man" - In this episode, Data is shown bending a metal bar.  
However, the metal bar that Riker places on the JAG officer's desk is not bent 
in the same manner.

"The Royale" - The surface temperature of the planet is less than absolute 
zero by six degrees Celsius. Also, after they beam the piece of the ship out 
of orbit, O'Brien and Riker pick it up with their bare hands (coming from 
space, it should have been close to zero Kelvin itself). Plus, after beaming 
down, they then scan the atmosphere to see if it's safe to breathe. (V)

"Samaritan Snare" - Wesley opens a communications channel, and says that 
Shuttle #2 is ready for takeoff. However, in the following scene, when the
shuttle is seen powering up, there is a "01" on the outside of the shuttle.
Oops. (UV)

"The Enemy" - Picard says to Tomaluk that he will be escorting the Romulan
ship to the Neutral Zone. Yet, in the closing shot, the Enterprise and the
Romulan Ship take off in two different directions. (V)

"The Price" - When the Ferengi Daimon talks to picard about putting photon
torpedoes through the worm hole, he says, "Casualties of war, Captain", 
however, his mouth looks as if he is saying "Picard." (V)

"Yesterday's Enterprise" - At the end of the episode, Geordi talks with 
Guinan. However, he is wearing an open neck uniform. (V)

"Sins of the Father" - The sound effects people must have fallen asleep every
time someone got slapped. (V)

"Sarek" - The music recital in this episode contained several errors. First,
the quartet seating is towards the audience, not toward each other. Classical
music was originally developed with the performers facing each other in order
to get visual cues. The performing in front of the audience did not come about
until much later. Second, the Allegro is by Brahm's, not Mozart. Thirdly, the
Allegro is a sextet, not a quartet. (UV) Also, in this story, Geordi and
Wesley are setting up this pool, and wesley says that the temperature is 150
degrees celsious, which is aproximately 300 degrees Farenheit. (where's that
formula?!?!?!) However, there was no obvious radiant heat because Geordi and
Wesley were standing close to the pool and peer inside. (UV)

"The Most Toys" - When Data is talking to the Enterprise at the start of the
episode, he says, "Level 1 precautions for incoming material remain in 
effect." But when Geordi and Wesley are playing back the tapes later, we hear,
"Level 1 precautions remain in effect." Selective recorder? (UV)

"Brothers" - The code which Data gives to lock the Enterprise computer system
differs between the spoken version and the version displayed on the screen.
(See "Security Codes") (V)

"Remember Me" - Beverly asks the computer to show her "the Universe". The
computer then puts out a drawing of the Enterprise that is cropped with a
sphere.....with the portion of the saucer section with the bridge cropped off.
(UV) In the final act, when Wesley and the Traveler are entering the equations
into the computer, watch Wesley's hand. He closes his eyes, and then places
his hand on the case, about three inches below the entry pad.  While he is
making his entries, his hand starts moving up, while the sound effect people
keep making the sounds in time. (V)

"Legacy" - During the card trick with Data, Riker's hand keeps on changing
position during the trick when the camera switches. (UV)

"Reunion" - After K'Eyhlar dies, Alexander the child runs away, and Worf lets
out his primal scream, we see her body being lowered to the floor. As she is 
finally settled, her eyes flutter open and closed several times (as, 
presumably, the actress, Suzie Plakson, "gets her bearings"). Also notice that 
her head is facing towards her left. However, when her body is shown full-on 
from the perspective of her feet (as Worf tells Alexander to "look at death, 
and never forget"), her head is facing slightly towards her *RIGHT*, and 
remains that way for the rest of the scene (a prime example of a scene being 
shot in several takes with the continuity person being asleep on the job).  
(V) Also, Dr. Crusher and her aide comes from the bedroom, not from the 
corridor. (UV)

"Devil's Due" - In the TOS episode "Day of the Dove", Captain Kang explicitly
remarks that the Klingons have no devil. However, in "Devil's Due", Ardra uses
the guise of the Klingon devil, Fekhlar, a creature that consumes the souls of
cowards. (V)

"Clues" - Guinan has a cigarette in a holder, which changes length with each
camera cut...a common problem in any movie where smoking is portrayed.

"The Drumhead" - After the first hearing with J'Ddan, Worf and J'Ddan leave
the hearing room. The doors open, as they are walking though the doorway, the
doors start to close, but hesitate, open back up and then close after they
leave the doorway. Looks like someone pulled on the rope too soon :-) (V)
Also, Satie says that Captain Picard took command of the Enterprise at
Stardate 41162. This is in error . . . it was 41152. (V)

"Half A Life" - Near the end of the episode, when Lwaxana Troi is standing
next to the mirror and then begins to walk away from it, for a brief instant
the boom from the mic is visible in the reflection. (V)

"In Theory" - In the teaser, Data finishes telling Jenna the reasons why she 
broke up with Jeff. She and Data then close up the photon torpedo, and she 
moves off to a control panel. On top of the torpedo rests a black, hand-sized 
deviceamajig. Data stands up, holding some sensormajig in his left hand. The 
scene then shifts to Data walking towards Jenna, and the sensormajig is now in 
his RIGHT hand (with no indication that he ever shifted it there), and Jenna 
is holding the deviceamajig she left on top of the torpedo (with no indication 
that she ever went back to get it). (V)

"Redemption II" - In part one of this story, Worf said that he would be
serving on the Bortas. Yet, in this episode, he is serving on the Hectar, with
no explanation about the transfer.
   Also, Picard says to Guinan that Yar died a year prior to Guinan joining
the crew. However, "Skin of Evil" was the fourth to last story of the season,
and Guinan is first seen in the second season premiere "The Child", suggesting
only 3-4 months between the two stories.
   Picard refers to the battle on Narendra III as taking place 24 years ago to
Sela, and 23 years ago to Guinan. (V) But, of course, Guinan senses time
differently......
   When Worf is given his family name back the blood on the knife is red not
pink as in Star Trek VI. (UV)

"Ensign Ro" - When Ensign Ro takes off her jacket, her communicator is on her
jacket. However, when she hands the jacket to the little girl, her
communicator jumps to her uniform, with no action of putting the communicator
there. (V)

"Silicon Avatar" - In the second act, look closely at the tricorder that Dr.
Marr holds during the conversation between Dr. Marr and Data. During the
conversation, she has her tricorder open. She then closes it, then reopens it,
but holds the tricorder UPSIDE DOWN!!!! (V)

"Disaster" - In the scene where Dr. Crusher and Geordi are evacuating all the
air out of the cargo bay, Geordi hits the button that closes the cargo bay.
The pushing of the button and resulting door closing are audibly heard, even
though sound doesn't travel in a vacuum. (Probably dramatic reasons) Also,
when the ship starts shaking, they cut to ten forward, where the stars are
shaking right along with the ship. (V)
   Also, while in the turbo lift, when Picard gives out the pips to the girl
(whose name escapes me). Look closely (actully it's fairly obvious once you
notice it). Her collar has two small holes where the pips go, before the pips
were put on.  Either they punched some holes to make it easier to put them on
(since the collar looks fairly stiff) or it's a product of having to do the
shot in several takes =-)

"The Game" - When the crew are forcing Wesley to play the game, and Riker is 
holding his eyes open, Wesley blinks. (V)

"Unification I" - When Dr. Crusher is examining Data in order to prep him (and
Picard) to Romulus, she asks if Data's ears are detachable, to which Data says
that they are not. Yet, in "Datalore", Data's brother, Lore, is clearly shown
without ears. A design change?

"Unification II" - After Spock, Picard, and Data have knocked out the Romulan
guards, and Spock has Sela at gunpoint, Picard has no gun in his hand. After a
camera switch, Picard then holds a Romulan disrupter "pistol". A minute later,
after a scene with the Enterprise, Picard is still standing in the same place, 
but with a Romulan disrupter "rifle". (UV) After Data gives Sela the famous 
"Spock Pinch", and when Picard, Data, and Spock leave the room, look at the 
glass pyramid in Sela's office. There is a reflection of a cameraman chewing
gum. (V)

"New Ground" - Alexander states that he was born on stardate 42305. Unless the
equivalent of 01000 stardate equals approximately one year, Alexander would be
only 2 and a half years old. Also, the creature which Riker saves from the lab
is obviously a hand puppet. (V)

"Violations" (?) - Troi and the Bad Guy {tm} get into the turbolift on Deck 3.  
Troi orders it to go to Deck 8. When she gets off, the doors close just in
front of the camera, clearly showing "Deck 3."

"The Masterpiece Society" - Geordi states that his VISOR covered the range
from 1 Hertz to 1 Terahertz. While this covers radio, microwave, and far
infrared frequencies, it does not cover near infrared, visible, ultraviolet,
x-rays, or gamma rays.

"Conundrum" - While a record search is performed, Deanna's father was listed
as "Alex". However, in "The Child", she named her child after Ian, her
father's name. (V) When MacDuff is talking to Picard in Picard's ready room,
when Picard goes to the window, all you see in the window is the reflection of
Picard and the room behind him (not the stars outside), then, when you see
MacDuff, in the reflection, leaving the room behind Picard, when the door
opens, you don't see the reflection of the bridge, you see stars. Oops! (UV)
After Rikers first love scene, a wide-angle-view-pan-to-closeup on the bridge
can be seen at the very top of the screen, in the brightly lit area. (UV).
Shortly afterwards, in the same scene, MacDuff is walking around and up to the
tactical station from his chair, and we can see his legs walk next to Worfs.
The camera cuts to Worf, and we see MacDuff approaching Worf. (UV) Also, 
Beverly Crusher is listed in the crew manifest as a Lt. Cmdr, when her 
actual rank is Commander. (UV)

"Ethics" - When the barrel falls on Worf, a second barrel also falls, and it's
lid pops off. However, when Geordi runs over to Worf, the lid is back on the 
barrel. (V)

"Cause and Effect" - The first time we see Picard in the Sickbay talking to 
Geordi and Dr. Crusher, he is wearing his standard uniform, and states he had 
a feeling of deja vu when he was reading. However, in the next loop, he is 
shown wearing his gray uniform while reading in his ready room, and when he's 
in Sickbay, he's also wearing his maroon jacket. (Also recall that in the 
first loop, when he is talking to Beverly, he is wearing the grey uniform.  
Thus, the sequence goes: grey -> standard -> grey). Presumably, both instances 
of this scene happen at the same "time", and since Picard's behaviour was not 
affected until Dr. Crusher contacted him, why is he wearing the standard 
uniform in one loop, and the gray uniform in the next loop? (V)

"Cost of Living" - In the turbolift where Picard and Data got trapped in due 
to the metal parasites, look closely: Picard, in this scene only, is wearing 
only three pips. (V) Also, Picard is told that the inertial dampers had
failed, in which he orders the Enterprise out of warp. If the inertial dampers
had failed, they would have been splattered all over the bridge. (V)

"I, Borg" - During the first time in the lab, Three of Five asks "Do I have a
name?" "I" should not have been used, it should have been "we".

"The Next Phase" - One of things dropped in films is an explanation as to why
Geordi and Ro are able to breathe or not be able to go through the floors.
Oops. (V) Also, Riker starts playing the trombone.... before his lips reach 
the mouthpiece. (UV)

"Time's Arrow" - The paper which Data picks up is dated "Sunday, August 11,
1893". Unfortunately, August 11, 1893 was a Friday. (V)

"Man Of The People" - There were several snafus which occurred, including....
* In Engineering, when Geordi and Beverly were checking out the
  Biofilter logs from the Dorian, Geordi had two hollow pips and one solid,
  instead of two solid and one hollow.
* When Riker and Troi walked out of Ten-Forward (the scene where Troi was
  wearing that revealing dress), they stepped right into a Turbolift. The
  sign on the lift's door said "08  Turbolift", indicating they were on Deck 8
  instead of Deck 10.
* Near the end, in Sickbay, when Beverly was reviving Deanna, Deanna's eyes
  fluttered open a couple of times, and then remained shut. (This is when she
  still looked old.) Although I couldn't make out an actual color, it was
  obviously that Marina didn't have her black contacts in.

"Schisms" - When Riker sits down at CONN when the ensign is having trouble
navigating, when we see his hands over the console, it is the display for 
OPS. It was also explained at the end of the episode that the experimenters 
had homed in on the Enterprise from Geordi modifying the sensors. Yet, Riker 
began experiencing his chronic insomnia days before Geordi made his 
modifications.

"Rascals" - The computer display in the classroom clearly shows "Classroom
Seven" on the screen. Yet, when Picard meets Riker, he refers to Classroom
Eight. (V) Also, when Keiko gets the Coffee, when she picks it up from the
replicator, it's in her left hand, yet, in the next scene, it's in her right
hand. (V) Also, amazingly, the clothings shrank, but not proportionally, and
Guinan's hat and Ro's headband is perfectly. (V) When Rikers dives to avoid a 
phaser blast, we *HEAR* the phaser, but not see it.

"A Fistful Of Datas" - When Data is being connected to the computer, look at 
his neck. You can see where the gold makeup ended. (UV) Also, when Pa 
Hollinder talks to the young Hollinder, and the Pa turns, his hand gets "cut 
off" due to the video wipe. (V) Also, while the Pa talk with Worf and Troi, 
talk a look at the manniquin standin for Young Hollinder.

"Chain Of Command" - The tunnels were underground, yet, they never once used a
flashlight, and there was light down there. (UV) Also, when Worf opens up the
door that was magnetically sealed, it opened inward like a normal door, yet,
when they started to run out, the door slid closed. Trick door?

"Ship In A Bottle" - When the book is tossed out of the holodeck, it got
zapped immediately. This is conflict with "The Big Goodbye", in which the
gangsters, when they walked out of the holodeck, they de-rezzed slowly. Also,
in "Elementary, Dear Data", there was a sheet of paper which was shown Picard
which did not de-rez when taken out of the holodeck. Moriarity must have made
some programming boo-boos.

- Betazoid's and the Ferengi Mind: In "The Battle" and "The Price", Deanna's
is able to sense deception from the Ferengi, and later, used against them.
Yet, in "Menage A Troi", the Betazoid Ambassador says that they are unable to
read Ferengi minds, a fact later confirmed in "The Loss". Data has suggested
that this is due to the Ferengi brain separated in four regions.

- In "Reunion," Gowron was prepared to offer K'Ehleyr a seat on the Klingon
Council for her assistance in getting Picard to quicken the pace of the Rite
of Succession. However, in "Redemption," he states to Picard that females are
not allowed to serve on that Council. He really wanted that pace
quickened......

Data Using Contractions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In "Datalore", Lore says that there are differences between him and Data,
among them, the ability of Lore being able to use contractions, while Data
couldn't. Yet, in "The Offspring", Data says that he hadn't quite mastered
contractions. It appears that Data can use contractions, as the following
shows indicate . . . . .

"Encounter At Farpoint" - At the beginning of the "post Atomic-horror"
courtroom, when Q enters, Data says, "At least we're acquainted with the
judge, Captain." Also, when Data is asked by a very familiar "Admiral" if he
is a Vulcan, Data replies, "No sir, I'm an android." (Entire Episode-V)

"The Naked Now" - Data says: "Correction, sir.. that's blown out." instead of
"that is". Then, after being examined by Dr. Crusher, Data says "I'm already
listed in several bio-mechanical texts.". Later, after Picard orders Yar to
the sick bay, Yar asks "Did he say when?", to which Data replies "I'm sure he
meant now.". In this same scene, "Chronological age, no. I'm afaid I am
not...." (Entire Episode-V)

"Code of Honor" -

"The Last Outpost" - During the conversation with Sentry, Data clearly said
"I'm afraid not." (UV)

"Where No Man Has Gone Before" - After they shot out of the galaxy and were
looking at all the nice special effects outside Data said something like "It's
beautiful". (UV)

"Datalore" - In the teaser, in response to Tasha's query about holding the
memory of over 411 people, Data responds, "Actually, I'm quite efficient in
some basic human information." Then, in act one, on the way to the place where
he was found, in response to Tasha's query about the colonist's memories, Data
replies, "I've always felt that it was done hurriedly, but I know little
more." Next, in act two, in a conversation with Chief Argyle, Data says, "I've
been most anxious to hear the Chief Engineer's opinion, Mr. Argyle." Then, in
the final act, after the fight with Lore, Picard asks Data if he's ok, in
which Data replies, "Yes Sir, I'm fine." This is quite surprising, since this
is one episode which they should have been extra careful about using
contractions. (V)

"Heart of Glory" - (UV)

"Elementary, Dear Data" - When Data and Geordi are just about to confront
Moriarty for the first time, Data notices some scratches near Moriarty's
secret entrance and he asks, "What's this?" (UV)

"The Offspring" - In the Captain's quarters, after Picard answers Data's
question about Admiral Halftel having children, Data replies, "I'm forced to
wonder how much experience he had as a parent when his first child was born."
(V)

"Future Imperfect" - The future Data uses a contraction.

"In Theory" - When entering Jenna's quarters, Data recites several phrases
with contractions, including "Honey, I'm Home" and "You don't tell me what to
do! You're not my mother!" - a clear contradiction of the no-contraction rule.
However, he was running a program in which he was simply reciting various
phrases couples use, and he was saying them in a different tone of voice than
usual. (V)

"The Quality Of Life" - Data clearly states "The trasnporter controls are not 
malfunctioning. I've locked out the controls."

                            ST:TNG Technical Manual

The "Star Trek: The Next Generation" Technical Manual (Pocket Books, ISBN
0-671-70427-3) is the complete technical guide to the Treknology used in TNG.
It is written by Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda, who work in TNG's Art
Department. Among their responsibilities include making sure that everything
is consistent in the technical department from show to show. However, they
have been known to clown around a little, and some of that clowning has shown
up in the technical manual. Such as:

11 - In the saucer section, right above the Captain's Yacht, there is a duck.  
A half inch to the left and a little bit down, there is a mouse. Slightly to 
the right of the mouse, there is a "Slippery When Wet" sign. In the shuttle
bay, there are three big shuttles, two small shuttles, and a Porsche. To the
right of the duck, about one inch, there is a DC-3 cargo aircraft, and, in
that same rectangle, there is a symbol of a woman and a child (the symbol for
Canada's "Family" rating for movies). Also, right under the warp pylons, there
is a registered trademark symbol. In addition, there is an image of NOMAD on 
it's side, center of the saucer section, forward.

Interestingly enough, if you look at the ship diagram in Engineering on the
show, those exact items show up.

120 - The tricorder display shows "TR580 TRICORDER VII", alledgely a reference
to the old Radio Shack TRS-80's.

                        Eugene Wesley "Gene" Roddenberry
                       August 19, 1921 - October 24, 1991

He created a legend which continues on today, creating a show that has helped
believe that there was a future worth living for. He showed us that space is
not just for space battles, but for learning new ideas and ways of thinking,
and, indirectly, has done more for civil rights and the space program than
Martin Luther King, Jr. and John F. Kennedy. Gene will be missed, but will not
be forgotten.
