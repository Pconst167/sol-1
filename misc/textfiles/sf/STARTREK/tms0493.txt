                         Star Trek Movie Lists of Lists

This is the Star Trek Movie List of Lists. It contains a listing of all the
"Star Trek" movie series, plus some added notes. (Due to length
considerations, there is a separate TOS/TAS, TNG, and DS9 List of Lists). This
list comes out around the 1st every month. However, a posting may not come out
due to events beyond my control.

If you are wondering why I compile these lists, it is strictly out of the
enjoyment of "Star Trek", and enjoy the wealth of information from fellow Star
Trek fans who post on the electronic networks. After being irritated by the
ever constant requests for episode lists on Usenet, I decided, in the middle
of 1990, to post a list of episodes on a regular basis. It soon grew from
that, and, with the contributions of other people, these lists grew to what
you see today. (And still growing). The only payment I ask is thanks and
contributions. I am not making a dime off these compilations.

Did you know . . .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. . . That many of the sets constructed for this movie have been re-used and
re-dressed for the subsequent films and have been used (albeit painted over)
on subsequent movies and Star Trek: The Next Generation. One of these sets was 
originally used in the TMP Klingon bridge. It was later used as the TWOK 
dilithium reactor room, TVH Klingon "lab" where Spock searched for the 
identity of the Probe's signal, and on TNG as backgrounds for various alien 
ships.

. . . The initial set construction was originally supposed to be for a new
series that was going to be a flagship of a proposed Paramount 4th network
titled "Star Trek II"?

. . . The recreation deck briefing consisted of mostly Star Trek fans. Word
leaked out that they needed a lot of extras for a day of shooting, and many
fans showed up, on word of mouth alone, for this day of shooting. A casting
call was never issued.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* When the travel pod with Kirk and Scotty dock at the Enterprise they are as
  Cargo 5 (Look over the Door). But the Announcement says Cargo 6

* In one of the extra scenes in the normal P&S video release where Kirk leaves 
  the airlock and goes after Spock, you can clearly see where the set ends and 
  where a variety of girders and other construction material starts.

* When Chekov gets his hand burned, Ilia goes up to help him. The camera cuts
  to Kirk with his back to the viewer, and Ilia is still sitting in her chair.
  Then, in the next shot, Ilia is seen leaving Chekov and going back to sit
  down.

* During the climactic scene outside of the Enterprise (inside of V'ger),
  Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are all wearing jackets with a colored band on the
  sleeve.  Just after they re-enter the Enterprise and are back on the bridge,
  the colors on Spock's and McCoy's jackets are switched.

Did you know . . .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. . . that all of the actors who played Khan's men were, at the time, male
strippers of Chippindales?

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* One of the best known SNAFU's is when Khan says to Chekov, "I never forget a
  face". "Space Seed" aired during the first season of Star Trek, and Chekov
  joined the crew during the second season. It was known before production 
  started that this was an error, and yet, the powers that be did not want to 
  leave out Walter Koenig.

* The blood stain on Kirk's jacket is constantly changing.

* Saavik mentions that visuals and tactical displays don't function in the 
  Mutara Nebula. Sulu has a lot of difficulty locating and hitting the
  Reliant, but Spock's scanners are able to pinpoint the Reliant's impulse 
  engines and get a clear reading of the Genesis Wave. Later, Chekov not only 
  scores three direct hits on the Reliant, but he also knows the exact 
  distance from Reliant before the Genesis device exploded (4000 km).

* When Joachim, one of Khan's injured men, is injured and says, "Yours is the 
  superior intellect", he then dies with his eyes open. However, when Khan
  hugs him, his eyes suddenly close.

* Saavik says that "shields will be useless" in the nebula.  However, the
  Enterprise enters Warp from inside the nebula....it should have been crushed
  since navigational deflectors are a type of shield.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* In "The Menagerie-Part One", Spock says "This is the Enterprise, 17 years
  ago". Yet, during Star Trek III, the Admiral says "There will be no refit of
  Enterprise...she's twenty years old." This would mean that most of TOS, the
  lost years, Star Trek I and II would have taken place within three years. 
  Perhaps Starfleet was embarassed about the Genesis project and wanted to 
  deny Kirk his ship.

* When Chekov detects an intruder in Spock's quarters, the graphics used are 
  that of a TOS style Constitution class ship, not that of a Movie style
  refit. Perhaps the Starfleet computer contractors screwed up and installed
  improper graphic files?

* The apparent size of the Bird of Prey changes several times during the
  movie. At the beginning, it looks huge, but, at the end, it's smaller.

* The Enterprise barely clears the space dock doors. No other space dock doors
  are shown, and the interior of the dock looks rather confining. However, the
  Excelsior, shown to be easily bigger than the Enterprise, somehow got out of
  the docking area without delay.

Stardate 8390.0: Kirk notes in his log entry that they are beginning their

Shakespeare
~~~~~~~~~~~
McCoy quotes the famous line, "Angels and ministers of grace, defend us!" from
Hamlet 1.4.39. The entire passage is in "Hamlet 1.4.39-57".

Did you know . . .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. . . In the scene where Uhura and Chekov are looking for the nuclear vessels,
a woman passes by and says "Across the bay, in Alameda." The scene was
originally written with no one responding, and the woman was just passing by,
unaware of any shooting that was going in. They had to track her down to get
her release on the film, and she just asked for a day's pay.

. . . Part of the reason whales were featured in this film was because both
William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy are members of the "Save The Whales"
organization.

. . . Kirk Thatcher is the son of former English Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. Among other things, he is an independent record producer, television
producer, and special effects/animatronics techie. That was his own hair and
punk rock band playing on the bus during Star Trek IV.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The Klingon bridge received a complete makeover between III and IV.

* The Klingon transporter is shown to have 4 pads. However, in III, six
  Klingons were beamed down at once. (Maybe they hugged....) Also, according
  to the "Day of the Dove", Klingon transporters are silent.

* In the dinner scene between Kirk and Gillian, the candle in the middle of
  the table is constantly changing position.

* When Scotty is holding the mouse, his middle finger is missing.

Did You Know . . .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. . . That the shuttlebay in Star Trek V is the repainted royal throne room
from Eddie Murphy's "Coming To America."

. . . Industrial Light and Magic was unable to do the special effects work for
Star Trek V because they were overloaded with the effects work for 
RCA/Columbia's "Ghostbusters II" and Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade." A stock shot from Star Trek IV was used in Star Trek V, and thus, 
ILM has to receive credit.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While many Star Trek fans consider the entire film to be a SNAFU, here are
some specific mistakes....

* In the opening sequence, when Kirk falls off the cliff, Spock catches him 
  before he crashes into the ground. Right after he's caught, take a close
  look at his shirt. One part of it is puffed out where wires are attached to 
  keep Shatner from swaying back and forth.

* The citizens of Nimbus III, "The Planet of Galactic Peace", were forbidden 
  any weapons, yet General Koord carries a pistol, and the people in the bar 
  have a gatling gun.

* Starfleet Headquarters is in the same time zone as Yosemite. When Kirk, 
  Spock and McCoy leave Yosemite, it's dark; yet, when they are aboard the 
  Enterprise talking to "Bob" from Starfleet, it's daytime in the background.  
  Maybe "Bob" uses a fake window, a la "Total Recall"....

* If you watch the far side of the Galileo when it first lands in the hanger 
  deck, you can see the feet of some stage hands rolling the shuttle into 
  place just in front of the advancing fog.

* When Kirk, Spock, and McCoy shoot up the access way aboard the Enterprise
  while escaping Sybok's men, watch the deck numbering.  They pass by deck 52
  twice. Also, the decks in turboshaft 3 are numbered one to seventy-eight. 
  The Enterprise is only 71 meters in overall draft, which would give each 
  deck just under one meter of height.

* When the Klingons fire on the Enterprise, it just had used the transporters 
  so the shields must be down. Yet, there is not one mark on the ship to
  indicate a torpedo hit.

Changes from theater version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When Star Trek VI was released to home video, it added several scenes,
including the following:

1. A scene in which a potential rescue plan is discussed with a Colonel West.
2. A scene in the torpedo tubes in which it is revealed that Klingons have no
   tear ducts.
3. The final scene in which the assassin is revealed to be Colonel West.

TNG Sets
~~~~~~~~
* Look closely at the warp engines in Engineering. Straight out of TNG.

* When Scotty is looking at the prints for the Enterprise, look behind him.
  There are the windows for the briefing room. This room was also redressed
  for the dining room, and, in reconstruction for TNG's fifth season, they
  damaged the wall.

* Also, look at the presidents office. If you look closely where the view
  screen is located, you could swear, by the placement, that a certain bar
  seems to belong there also. Also, look at the windows and the entryway. The
  president's office is Ten-Forward.

Shakespeare
~~~~~~~~~~~
The subtitle "The Undiscovered Country" comes from "Hamlet 3.1.80". In
addition to the title of the movie, the following make further reference to
Hamlet's soliloquy: First, when Chancellor Gorkon toast to "The Undiscovered
Country", and then, with General Chang just before the photon torpedo hits his
ship.
   Many have criticized the movie's use of "the undiscovered country" in
applying it to the future rather than death.  Yet change is death--the death
of that which is familiar to us. Like Hamlet, Kirk asks himself, "To be or not
to be." If the Federation allies itself with the Klingon Empire, it will be
the death of the universe as he knows it. It could, in fact, be disastrous:
"ills that we know not of" might await the Federation should peace be made.
The undiscovered country could be too agonizing, so it is safer to cling on to
the "ills we have, [rather] than fly to others that we know not of."
   Of course, the undiscovered country may also be wonderful beyond
description. That is the dilemma Hamlet faced, and it is also the dilemma
which Kirk faces, though (like Hamlet) Kirk does not face this possibility for
some time, preferring to cling on to the familiar ills of war and hatred.
   As viewers, we are quite aware of just what lies in the undiscovered
country Kirk was so afraid of. We have seen the next generation of explorers
(even if they never explore anything). I find it amusing that the "ills we
know not of" happen to be seen weekly as Star Trek: The Next Generation.
   Further Shakespeare references:

As the Klingons leave the Enterprise, Chang says:
- "Parting is such sweet sorrow." Romeo and Juliet 2.2.184
- "Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
                           2 Henry IV 3.2.212 [paraphrase]

During the trial scene, Chang says:
- "Let us sit upon the ground
   And tell sad stories of the death of kings:
                                     Richard II 3.2.155-56

And during the final show-down, Chang says:

- "There's a divinity that shapes our ends
   Rough-hew them how we will--"  Hamlet 5.2.10-11

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* When the Excelsior is hit by the subspace shock wave, Valtane is standing
  near Sulu at the captain's chair. The next few scenes show crewmembers being
  shaken about. One of the scenes shows Valtane at his station behind a few
  crewmembers. The next scene has Valtane next to Sulu again (walking back to
  his station, I believe)

* Valeris is called "Lieutenant", but wears Commander Insignia. Maybe she's a
  Lieutenant Commander?

* In VI, Valeris flies the Enterprise-A out of dock under 1/4 impulse power,
  and it zooms out in 2 seconds. However, in III, that same sequence takes
  over 2 minutes for both the Enterprise and the Excelsior.

* McCoy, at one point, had to shoot someone with a hypospray. While the hypo
  was designed to look like the original series hypo, McCoy used it backwards.

* Kirk and McCoy are arrested over two hours after Gorkon is assassinated
  (watch the clocks). However, it is implied that they beamed over
  immediately. They must've switched over to Klingon Daylight Time.....

* Kirk's trial begins at around 9 AM Federation time, goes past 11, 3, and 6
  once, and then goes to around 11:30. That's over 14 hours....the trial was
  at a snail's pace.

* During the interrogation sequence, a clock behind Scotty reads several
  minutes earlier than the previous shot. It's with his line, "Then we're
  dead."

* The Fed President is told by Chancellor Azetbur that any attempt to rescue
  the prisoners will be considered an act of war. As she is saying this, the
  plans for Operation: Retrieve are just a few feet away from the President!

* Deck labels indicate that the transporter room is on Deck 7, yet, when the
  officers discover the bodies of the conspirators, they're on Deck 8.

* When Kirk and McCoy are on Rura Penthe, and that tall alien is definitely on
  about something, McCoy says, "He's definitely on about something, Jim."
  However, that piece of a dialog is captured on two shots, and, in the first
  half of the shot, McCoy's lips are not moving. (UV)

* The Klingons on the bird of prey have purple blood, but the Klingon at the 
  end has red blood, which is seen on the spike on his shoulder. It was later 
  revealed in the video version that the assassin was Human in Klingon 
  disguise. (V)

* The closing credits have Uhura listed as "Uhuru". Oops, although Uhuru is
  the proper Swahili spelling for "Freedom".

                    Eugene Wesley "Gene" Roddenberry
                   August 19, 1921 - October 24, 1991

He created a legend which continues on today, creating a show that has helped
believe that there was a future worth living for. He showed us that space is
not just for space battles, but for learning new ideas and ways of thinking,
and, indirectly, has done more for civil rights and the space program than
Martin Luther King, Jr. and John F. Kennedy. Gene will be missed, but will not
be forgotten.
