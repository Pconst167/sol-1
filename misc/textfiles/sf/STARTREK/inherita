                            TEASER

FADE IN:

          EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

in parking orbit around Starbase 164

          PICARD (V.O.)
Captain's log, stardate 44232.3. We're in orbit around starbase 164
preparing to welcome aboard Magister Nevik and his apprentice,
Nahj,from the planet Navaron,for transport to Gama III. I've been
requested by Starfleet to persuade Nevik, if possible, to join the
Federation. I know from our last encounter this won't be an easy task.

INT. ENTERPRISE--TRANSPORTER ROOM THREE

PICARD and BEVERLY, wearing dress uniforms, are waiting for the
Navarons to beam aboard. O'BRIEN is at the controls, doing some final
adjustments.

          PICARD
Are the Navarons ready to beam aboard?

          O'BRIEN
(adjusting settings)
Not yet. A minor problem transporting their technical instruments. They
require a faster rate of molecular reconstruction--Should be another 15
seconds.

          PICARD
Their instruments are remarkable--the most advanced sensory and
communication technology I've encountered.

          O'BRIEN
Ready now, Captain.

          PICARD
Energize.

Two humanoids begin to flicker into view on the transporter pad. One is
quite old looking, the other no more than a teenager. Both are short,
brown, and very human-like. They are wearing simple monk-like garments
of coarse cloth. The older one wears a necklace with a one-inch
opal-like orb in the center--a symbol of his leadership role. They are
accompanied by an assortment of baggage made of a flexible metallic
skin.

          PICARD
Welcome to the Enterprise, Magister Nevik.

          NEVIK
(Bows head in acknowledgement)
Captain Picard, this is my apprentice, Nahj.

NAHJ also bows his head in respect, then takes a step forward and half
stumbles over a piece of luggage. NEVIK winces.

          PICARD
May I introduce Dr. Crusher? She'll be giving you a medical exam. You
gave Admiral Young quite a scare yesterday.

          NEVIK
(bows to Beverly)
I'm charmed.  There is no cause to be alarmed, however. Brainstorms are
unfortunately common among the elder of my race.

          BEVERLY
Perhaps we can find a way to halt the process.

          NEVIK
(smiles in disbelief, shaking head at Beverly. Then directs his
attention to Nahj) 

Take the equipment to our rooms. You may use this time to acquaint
yourself with the ship...  (turns to Picard) If that's alright with
you, Captain?

Nahj's eyes light up. He is obviously very eager to explore the ship.

          PICARD
Certainly.
(taps communicator)
Ensign Crusher, report to transporter room three.
(to Nahj)
Ensign Crusher can show you any thing you wish.

Captain Picard, Beverly, and Nevik exit as Nahj begins picking up the
luggage. Some of it is oddly shaped and unwieldy. It is obviously more
than he can manage alone. WESLEY enters and begins to help him pick up
and carry the baggage.

          WESLEY
I'm Wesley Crusher.

          NAHJ
You can call me Nahj. 

The two young men exit the transporter room, already beginning to
whisper excitedly like good friends.

          INT. - SICKBAY

Nevik is lying on a biobed as Dr. Beverly Crusher scans his head. He is
obviously impatient with the procedure.

          BEVERLY
How long have you been having these seizures?

          NEVIK
I've had three this year. Brainstorms are the first failing of age,
among my people. You make too much of it.

          BEVERLY
You have no cure, no preventative for this?

          NEVIK
For the aging and decay of the body?
(chuckles)
Not yet.

          BEVERLY
I'm curious that this symptom should be so common to your people--other
races age very differently. And some effects of aging can be reversed
or at least halted.

          NEVIK
Please, Doctor, do not concern yourself. My race has a long history. We
will manage our old age on our own.

          BEVERLY
While you're on this ship your health is my concern.  Your brain scan
shows some anomalies. They may be common to your people or they may be
a clue to what's causing your seizures. I'd like to examine Nahj for
comparison.

          NEVIK
Fine. 

Nevik gets off the biobed rather hurriedly for an old man. He's quite
agile. Dr. Crusher is looking down at her scanner, analyzing the data.
She does not notice as Nevik half stumbles out the exit, half clutching
his head.

                              FADE OUT

            STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - ACT ONE          

FADE IN

EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

enroute to Gama III at warp speed.

INT. PASSENGER QUARTERS

Nahj is looking around the room, curiously. Wesley is watching him. The
luggage is left unpacked on the floor by the door, where it was dumped
on arrival. Nahj finally heads for the computer terminal and starts
accessing Starfleet history. He scans it at the same rate Data would
use--ultra fast. He finishes the text within seconds. Wesley is
astounded.

          NAHJ
(swivels around in chair, carefree and excited)
How lucky you are to be a part of all this.  Will you show me the rest
of the ship now?  I want to see all of it.

          WESLEY
How did you do that?

          NAHJ
(genuinely puzzled)
Do what?

          WESLEY
Scan the databank so quickly. I thought only Data was able to process
information so fast--at least I did until today.

          NAHJ
It's not difficult.
(getting excited again)
I could teach you. It's like a trick, a mind exercise. You clear your
mind, make it an open receptacle. Then you can process computer
information, or anything else at that speed. Nevik taught me, and I'll
teach you.

Wesley is thunderstruck at Nahj's nonchalance and eager to start right away.

          WESLEY
Now?

          NAHJ
Would you show me the ship first?

          WESLEY
Of course. 
(talking while they exit)
Wait'll you see engineering. This ship is the fastest in
Starfleet...and I can show you my new program in the Holodeck....

CUT TO:

INT. - OBSERVATION LOUNGE

Nevik and Picard are relaxing, looking at the stars and just getting
into a good talk.

          NEVIK
How do you put up with that Doctor clucking all over you?

          PICARD
Dr. Crusher takes her duties seriously. 

          NEVIK
I see no reason for this protective attitude. I'm getting old--that's
all. It happens to most.

          PICARD
While you're on this ship the Federation is responsible for your
welfare. That is a responsibility none of us take lightly.

          NEVIK
(smiling)
Your solicitude does you justice. I've been whining like an old man,
which is just what I am. Now. Weren't you going to offer me some of
that delicious vice of yours? Earl Grey tea, wasn't it?

          PICARD
(to food dispenser)
Two teas, Earl Grey, black.
(carries the tea to where the two are sitting)

CUT TO:

INT. - SICKBAY

Nahj is sitting on a biobed, dangling his legs over the edge, impatient
to leave.  Beverly is finishing a scan, checking her readings. She
looks up.

          BEVERLY
That's all, Nahj. 

          NAHJ
(indifferent, a little bored)
I can go now?

TROI enters sick bay. Beverly nods dismissal at Nahj and he leaves.

          TROI
You are concerned.

          BEVERLY
(beings pacing)
I've checked all the information Starfleet has on Navaron
physiology--it isn't much. Nothing on this brainstorm phenomenon Nevik
insists is part of their normal aging process.Take a look at this.

Beverly keys in wall computer and display shows a larger than life-size
brain graphic with its electrical activity. A large fissure cuts
through left and right brain, slightly askew of center and jagged, like
a lightning bolt. The electrical activity is extremely high--a
bombardment that does not let up.)


          BEVERLY
This is Magister Nevik's brain activity. This fissure between left and
right brain is widening. That, together with the extremely high
electrical activity, may be causing his brain storms. I don't know for
sure, but I do know this: If that fissure widens two millimeters more,
he will die.

          TROI
And Nahj?

          BEVERLY
His brain activity is within normal parameters except for the high
electrical rate. His synapses fire at a rate most humanoids achieve
only under artificial stimulation. I can't determine if there is a
connection between the brain fissure and the unusual axon-synapse
rate--but I suspect there is more to this brainstorm phenomena than
aging.

CUT TO:

INT. - OBSERVATION LOUNGE

Picard and Nevik are still talking.

          PICARD
Have your views about joining the Federation changed any since the last
time we met?

          NEVIK
Fifteen years by your reckoning.
(half sighs, half harrumphs)
No. You know the problem.

          PICARD
The Prime Directive.

          NEVIK
We would not be on this mission, or any of our missions, if we followed
the  prime directive.  I'm surprised the Federation agreed to transport
us, considering our objective.

          PICARD
It is unusual, but not without precedent.

          NEVIK
Renar, now that's a lovely planet.  
(shrewdly)
It doesn't still rankle, does it?

          PICARD
Rankle? No. But it does puzzle me how you do it.  No twist, no
distortion in the Renar culture suggests an intervention took place.
Yet you most assuredly saved them from nuclear destruction.

          NEVIK
They live and prosper...a most pleasing outcome.

          PICARD
You take every factor into consideration in your interventions in a way
we never could. The results are astounding. The Federation could learn
a lot from you.

          NEVIK
(shakes his head slowly)
The prime directive is a good rule, such wisdom in races so young gives
me much hope. The Federation should stick to it....But for us
Navarons--it will never do. Our whole purpose, to aid younger cultures
with their growing pains...  (puts cup down) but you've heard all this
before.

CUT TO:

INT. - TEN FORWARD

DATA enters. Ten Forward is moderately busy. GUINAN is behind the bar,
fiddling with an authentic antique keg.

          GUINAN
Data..,
(gestures for him to join her)
You're just what I need--a little dutch boy.

          DATA
Little dutch boy?

          GUINAN

(attempting to tighten spigot screws, readjust the spigot, but not
having any success) 
This keg has been nothing but trouble since I picked it up at Starbase
164. First the barrel leaked, now the spigot.  Makes you wonder if
craftsmanship is dead.

          DATA
Little dutch boy?

          GUINAN
Here. Stick your finger in the spigot. That'll hold it. I need a radial
spanner from engineering to fix this. I won't be long.

Data  puts his finger in the spigot and stops the drip. He watches Guinan start to leave.

          DATA
Could not the replicator...?

But Guinan is already gone.

PAN TO:

Nahj, Wesley and two young female ensigns are sitting at a table, very
chummy and happy. A glowing sphere is in Nahj's open palm. He's just
explained how to use the mechanism to contact anyone in the galaxy by
enhancing and amplifying thought patterns through subspace. The
starfleet officers are half-impressed, half dubious.

          NAHJ
(hands the sphere to one of the women)
Here. You try it.

          FIRST ENSIGN
(laughs a little nervously)
Who shall I contact?

          WESLEY
Anyone. Your mother, father, sister, friend.

          SECOND ENSIGN
How about that cute engineer on Starbase 164?

          FIRST ENSIGN
Okay. My mother.
(she closes her eyes, holding the sphere in her fist. It changes color
as she concentrates. After a few moments she opens her eyes.) 
My mother said to be sure and wear a raincoat on Denebi IV. (beat) It
rains a lot there.

The whole group breaks into laughter.

          NAHJ
Your mother will remember the experience as a pleasant fantasy, or a
dream if she was asleep. But between people who understand the process,
the Lirda opens up instantaneous communication across infinite
distances. (beat) Nevik has a greater one--he can contact all the
Navarons at once with it.

          FIRST ENSIGN
(now totally sold on communication device)
Starfleet could use technology like that. It would open up tremendous
possibilities...

          NAHJ
This is nothing. A toy. We have tools that go far beyond this. Nevik
has a sensory amplification device, the Pharangar, that opens up every
mode of perception--to infinity. When he wears it, he can learn
anything he wants. He can know anything in the universe--for him there
are no secrets.  And when I pass phahr-quar I shall inherit that
helmet.

The three starfleet officers are totally enthralled by what Nahj is
telling them. They can imagine themselves having such powerful
knowledge.

          NAHJ
(continuing)
But I'd gladly give it up to hang around with people like you.

That breaks the spell. They all laugh and the tension that had built up
with the demonstration of the sphere is dispelled.

(to Wesley, serious and earnest, a little conspiratorial)
Come with me and I'll show you that trick I mentioned earlier.

The two young men rise and nod good-bye to ensigns one and two. As they
pass the bar, Wesley notices Data has his finger in the spigot of the
keg.

          WESLEY
Plugging the dike?

Data thinks a moment and nods.

CUT TO:

INT. - CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM

Picard is sitting at his desk, accessing computer terminal.

          PICARD
Computer, show me all data entries on Navaron activities in the last
fifteen years.

The computer screen shows listing of half dozen entries. Two refer to
Magister Nevik.

          PICARD
Tell me full entries 2.7 and 2.8

          COMPUTER
Navaron history entry 2.7. Stardate 34824.7. While on a mission to
Romulan planet Alpha Tao III, Genderia, apprentice to Magister Nevik,
contracted a virulent form of the Navos plague and died. She was
twenty-nine at the time and preparing for full Magister rank. This
calamity necessitated the need for another Magister apprentice.

Navaron history entry 2.8. Stardate 34924.1 Nahj Caputon of the
Regendra cluster-family was invested as Magister apprentice at the age
of seven. His registered sensory, communication, and intelligence
quotient is in the top ninety-nine percentile of Navaron children
tested. He is the only one to attain the sensory-communication index of
1.99.

There is a chime.

          PICARD
Enter.

Troi walks in and stands at Picard's desk, a questioning look on her face.

          PICARD
I'd like your impressions of Magister Nevik and his apprentice.

          TROI
Nahj is very intelligent and his training has made the most of his
abilities. He is lonely and eager for approval. He swings between
arrogant self-confidence and insecurity.

          PICARD
And Nevik?

          TROI
Nevik is harder to read. His mind control is extraordinary.I sense from
him great wisdom, gentleness, compassion. But there is something more
underneath that. Something worries him.

          PICARD
His mission to Gama III?

          TROI
No. He is worried about something more personal. Something about
himself. I don't know how to put it into words--it's more than a
worry--it's anxiety, fear--I don't have words for it.

          PICARD
Dr. Crusher told me of her preliminary findings. He could be concerned
about his precarious health.

Troi suddenly experiences tremendous pain. Picard stands and moves
toward her as he reacts to the pain on her face.

          PICARD
What is it?

          TROI
(struggling for words)
I...don't know.  I feel a great internal struggle--much pain, anxiety.

          PICARD
Where? Who?

          TROI
I don't know. Its power is greater than anyone on the ship could be
generating.

CUT TO:

INT. - PASSENGER QUARTERS

Nevik is alone in his quarters. The room is dim and a candle burns in a
ritual holder on the table. The Magister is wearing a translucent
helmet which covers his head and face--the Pharangar. His hands are
tense and white-knuckled.

CUT TO:

EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

We see what Nevik is experiencing--an energy field in space, a radiant,
thin fog with random flashes. (As the story progresses the fog becomes
thicker and the flashes more frequent.)

                                   FADE OUT

ACT TWO

FADE IN

EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

enroute to Gama III at warp speed.
                
                PICARD (V.O)
Captain's log, stardate 44236.3,  I've relieved Ensign Crusher of his
other duties so he can spend more time cultivating his friendship with
Nahj--a bridge, I hope, to negotiating with Magister Nevik.


INT. - MAIN BRIDGE

Picard in command chair, WORF, RIKER, Troi, and Data are all at their
stations. A supernumerary is at CONN, GEORDI is at the engineering
station aft.

                WORF
Captain, we're picking up a subspace distress signal coming from sector
2462.6, very weak at this distance. It identifies itself as the
Klaxtor, a freighter from Dendar II.

                PICARD
On main viewer.


MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

On main viewer is a weak visual signal showing the rather run down
bridge of a small and very utilitarian freighter. Three bridge crew
members (humanoid) are visible and they are clearly distraught.

                CAPT. KAGAN
This is Captain Kagan. We need help immediately. Our life support
system is failing. The internal temperature has dropped five degrees
already. We can recycle oxygen for two, at the most three, days.

                PICARD
What has caused the malfunction?

                CAPT. KAGAN
We were surrounded by an unusual energy field. One energy pulse broke
through our shields and damaged the outer hull.

Picard motions Worf to cut sound. Worf does so and just at that moment
the turbolift doors open, revealing Nevik. Picard is startled and not
pleased, but disguises his feelings.

                PICARD
Magister...

                NEVIK
Forgive my intrusion. I sensed that I might be of help.

Picard nods. He doesn't have time for this. He continues to deal with
the crisis as he motions Nevik to take a seat.

                PICARD
Data, how long will it take us to reach them?

                DATA
At warp 9 it will take us three days, 20 hours, twenty-two minutes...

                PICARD
(interrupting)
Thank you.
Lt. La Forge, can you help them extend their life support systems until
we reach them?

                GEORDI
I'll need to see schematics of their system. It'll mean using the last
of their converter energy.

                PICARD
Understood.
(motions Worf to engage sound communication with Dendar freighter on
main viewer) 
It will take us close to four days to reach you. In the
meantime, our chief engineer will work with you to extend your life
support system until then. I'm turning you over to him now. Give him
whatever information you have on the energy field.Picard out.

Worf relays the freighter communication to Geordi's station. Geordi
begins getting the freighter schematics on his computer terminal.

                PICARD
Increase speed to warp nine. Adjust course 2642.6, mark 4.

                CONN
(sets new heading into console)
Yes, Captain.

                PICARD 
(turns to Nevik.)
I'm afraid we must delay your arrival at Gama III by several days.

Nevik waves away the delay as of no importance. 

                NEVIK
This energy field could be vastly interesting. Please let me know what
you discover about it.

Nevik stands up and walks over to Data's station, in a too casual,
nonchalant manner.

                DATA
Navaron has an almost mythic reputation. You never developed space
travel, yet you were able to contact those who had.

                NEVIK
(deliberately changing the subject)
It is you who have developed a mythic reputation. Discussion of the
android Starfleet officer is Federation wide.

                GEORDI
Captain, I've downloaded the life support extension procedure to the
Klaxtor. They'll be able to hold on until we get there, but just
barely.  Even with converter energy, the oxygen level will continue to
slowly deteriorate.

                PICARD
What about the energy field?

                GEORDI
There isn't much. The field is over four parsecs in size. The Klaxtor
records describe it as a fine, almost indiscernible mist. It didn't
appear to be dangerous.

                PICARD
Analysis?

                GEORDI
The Klaxtor doesn't have the technology for analyzing the field's
structural or chemical base.

Picard acknowledges.

                RIKER
The Dendarian traders specialize in pharmaceuticals. I wonder what they
are doing in that sector.

                DATA
The colony on Biranda IV reports an outbreak of Navos plague. Perhaps
that is the Klaxtor's destination.

                PICARD
We'll find out soon enough.

Beverly and Wesley are seated at dining table; they've just finished
dinner.They're relaxed and clearly having a good time together. Beverly
stands and gets dessert from the replicator--chocolate mousse.Coffee is
already on the table.

                BEVERLY
I'm glad you could join me tonight. I haven't seen much of you this trip.

                WESLEY
I've been busy. Captain Picard...

                BEVERLY
I know. You like Nahj, don't you?

                WESLEY
I've never met anyone like him. It's exciting to be with him, learn
from him...the things he knows...its opened up a new world for me.

                BEVERLY
I'm concerned...about that. The Navaron's have developed their
abilities over centuries--I'm concerned that...this crash course of
yours, could be...dangerous.

                WESLEY
Mom, I can handle it. 

                BEVERLY
All I'm asking is that you think about what you're doing. There's no
need for you to take risks. That's not too much to ask.

                WESLEY
Sure, mom. Don't worry.

CUT TO:

INT. - OBSERVATION LOUNGE

Nevik and Picard are alone, deep in a friendly discussion.


                NEVIK
Nahj is quite taken with your ship. (beat) And your crew.  It's all he
talks about.

                PICARD
I'm glad he finds them to his liking.

                NEVIK
A Magister can't afford too much intimacy. The race must always come
first, not the individual.

                PICARD
Are the two so incompatible?

                NEVIK
Relationships have a way of distorting one's objectivity. (beat) Do you
hope my attachment to Nahj will soften me?

Picard doesn't respond verbally--the two understand each other perfectly.

                NEVIK
For millennia the Navarons have helped younger cultures in difficulty,
helped them to reach the point of transformation, what we Navarons
missed out on...  (forcefully) I won't let Federation rules get in the
way of it.

                PICARD
No matter what the cost?

                NEVIK
To Nahj? He'll adjust. He's eager to socialize now--he's young. With
time, he'll adapt to his task.

                PICARD
As you did.

                NEVIK
As I did.

                PICARD
No Regrets?


                NEVIK
(leans back, reminiscing)
Perhaps one or two.  Do you not have regrets as well?

Picard smiles and nods a touche.

                NEVIK
Nahj lacks confidence--unlike your Ensign Crusher. 

                PICARD
That's what experience is for.

                NEVIK
You're right. I'm going to turn our mission on Gama III over to him.

                PICARD
What about this little mystery of the energy field? Could Nahj handle
that? Or have you already discovered what we'll be dealing with?

                NEVIK
(evasive--lying doesn't come easy to him)
Perhaps he can handle that. I will consider it.

CUT TO:

INT. - PASSENGER QUARTERS

Wesley and Nahj go about the ritual preparation for pharangar
meditation with graceful concentration. The ritual includes drawing the
window closures, dimming the lights, lighting a large candle with fluid
motions containing Tai Chi like forms.  Nahj takes a translucent face
and head helmet out of its metallic receptacle. The helmet has red
lines, like a computer schematic, imbedded in it.   The door opens and
Nevik enters.

                NEVIK
Tonight, Nahj, you will begin learning the primary use of the Pharangar.

                NAHJ
Am I ready?

                NEVIK
I am getting too old to control the Pharangar energy. It takes the
strength of youth--which you have.

Nahj seems uncertain and dubious.

                NEVIK
Wesley would be willing to try it, wouldn't you?

Wesley's eyes light up with eagerness.

                NEVIK
You see, Nahj. 
(indicates that Wesley sit in the Magister's meditation chair.)
I will assist you. This will not be different from the other times,
except for one thing. You will let down the barriers I taught you and
let the flow wash over you.

Nevik places the helmet on Wesley in a ceremonial way. He lets only a
few moments pass, then removes the helmet.

                WESLEY
It's beyond words. But--I could not make sense of it all.  So
much--confusion.

                NEVIK
(nods... this is to be expected)
You will learn to sort it out.
Now, Nahj.

Nahj sits in the meditation chair and Nevik places the pharanger over
his head for just a few moments, then removes it.

                NEVIK
That wasn't so bad, was it? Over the next few days you'll have the
chance to get more familiar with the process. I'm turning the Gama III
mission over to you.

Nahj reacts-he's terrified.

                NEVIK
Don't be dismayed. The Pharangar will become your friend, companion,
soul-mate. You'll learn to trust it. It will complete you.  Now...I
will meditate.


Nevik settles into the chair he uses for meditation. Wesley sits on a
couch set perpendicular to the chair. Nahj stands a little behind Nevik
and slowly, carefully places the helmet over his head.

INT. - TEN FORWARD

Nahj and Wesley are at a corner table talking and having drinks. 

                NAHJ

(he has difficulty broaching the subject, but Wesley is the only one he
can talk to) I have learned to sort out the sensory data. I can focus
on discrete bits, choose my focus and concentrate--its like wrestling a
weapon out of the hands of a strong opponent. More difficult than I
imagined.

                WESLEY
I know you can handle it, Nahj. You were chosen for this.

                NAHJ
(shakes his head. Wesley is missing the point)

I have focused on the Gama III crisis for three days now, sorting out
the details, the conflicting positions--what disturbs me is--the crisis
isn't crucial. If we don't interfere, it won't matter in the long run.
That's clear. So why are we going there?  And something else. The
energy field. Nevik insists that I not focus on it, but it fights
me--fights for my attention. I can't explain it, but I sense it is
connected to Nevik somehow.

                WESLEY
The Magister hasn't give me any instructions about it. Why don't I give
it a try?

Nahj thinks about it and nods assent.

Wesley walks through the turbolift doors and takes his station at CONN,
supernumerary leaves that station. The regular bridge crew are all at

We're coming into visual range of the freighter.

                RIKER
On main viewer.

Angle on MAIN VIEWER.The freighter, a small ship in a slightly skewed
position, looks like a derelict. It is surrounded by continual flashes
of lightning like charges, tightly imbedded by them. There are
infrequent flashes off in the distance of a similar nature. These
flashes move in different directions, seemingly at random, from one
point in space to another.

CUT TO:

Nevik is alone, sitting in meditation chair, wearing the Pharangar. His

                INT. - MAIN BRIDGE

Only a moment has passed, the bridge crew is still reacting to the
unusual nature of the phenomena they are seeing, and to the fact that
it has suddenly engulfed the ship.

                RIKER
What is that?

                PICARD
Full stop. Data, analyze.

                DATA
Electro-chemical impulses, negative neural ionic discharges--and
something our sensors aren't capable of analyzing. No discernible
pattern.

                WESLEY
It's like an energy soup.

                DATA
An intriguing analogy.

                TROI
Captain, just as we came into range of the energy field, I felt a
powerful sensation--a great thrust of will, a feeling of
embattlement--then when the field engulfed the ship, that feeling
disappeared.

                PICARD
Could you be sensing something from the energy field?

                TROI
I don't know, but I've felt this level of emotional power only a few
times before--and only on this voyage.

                PICARD
(acknowledges Troi's input, then bends his mind to the task at hand)
Can we transport the freight crew from this distance?

                WORF
The distance is not a problem. The energy field is interfering with
transport lock.

                RIKER
If the Enterprise were hit by one of those charges, how much damage
would it cause?

                DATA
The voltage reading is off the scale. I would expect considerable
damage, sir.

                WORF
Won't our shields protect the ship?

                DATA
The shields will provide some protection, but they were not designed to
withstand electro-chemical impulses of over 1.5 million, 700 thousand
volts.

                RIKER
Is it a weapon of some sort?

                DATA
Insufficient information. Nothing like it has been encountered in
Starfleet history.

                PICARD
Speculate, Mr. Data.

                DATA
The electro-chemical composition does bear a faint resemblance to
synapse activity in the humanoid brain, but the other elements confound
that analysis.

                PICARD
A life form?

                DATA
Possible, sir, but only speculation at this point.

                WESLEY
Sir, I suspect Magister Nevik has the answers to your questions. 

                PICARD

(the pieces fall into place- realizes the Magister must have something
to do with the energy field) Lt. Worf, please escort the Magister to
the bridge. I'd like his input.

                WORF
Yes, sir.

Worf leaves in turbolift.

Worf stands outside Nevik's quarters. He rings the chimes, but there is
no response. He does a security over-ride and enters.

(puzzled)
Is this necessary, Ensign?

Troi motions for Picard to let Wesley go.

                PICARD
Permission granted.

Wesley leaves in turbolift. Picard turns to Troi, questioning.

                TROI
Wesley was very agitated by news of Nevik's collapse.

                RIKER
It's not like him to let emotions interfere with his duties.

                TROI
It is his sense of duty for the Navarons that motivates him: In some
way, he feels responsible for what is happening.

INT. - SICKBAY

Nevik is still unconscious. He's lying on a biobed with a neural
regulator attached to his head. Beverly is scanning him. Nahj stands
by, stricken. Wesley comes to the sickbay entrance and signals Nahj to
join him in the corridor without Beverly noticing him.

INT. - CORRIDOR

                WESLEY

I've got to find out about the energy field now. Before its too late.

Nahj reacts--horrified, but accepting.


INT. - SICKBAY

Nevik is still lying, unconscious, on biobed, while Dr. Crusher is
scans his head, making adjustments to the neural regulator headband
he's wearing. His vital signs appear on the computer terminal on the
wall. Nevik groans and moves his head from side to side. He opens his
eyes.

Like an asteroid hit me here.
(indicates left side of head)

                BEVERLY
An accurate description. You have the symptoms of a concussion,
perhaps from your fall.What were you doing just before the seizure?

                NEVIK
Meditating.

Beverly is surprised. This is not the answer she was expecting. 
                
You may need to give up... meditating for awhile. 

CUT TO:

INT. - PASSENGER QUARTERS

Nahj is holding the Pharangar. Wesley sits in the meditation chair.

                NAHJ
I can't give you more than thirty seconds. Understand?

                WESLEY
(nods)
I'll make the most of it.

Nahj lowers the Pharangar over Wesley's head. After no more than five
seconds, Wesley slumps over, the Pharangar falls from his head. Najh
can't believe it--he's shocked. He looks around, sees the COM PANEL,
and realizes he needs help. He presses the panel.

                NAHJ
Sickbay.

I'm on my way.
CUT TO:

INT. - SICKBAY

Wesley is wheeled into sickbay on a gurney by a medic. Beverly
accompanies him, completing a full body scan. Najh trails in the rear,
despondent. Nevik is alert, sitting up in a chair, wearing a neural
regulator patch on his forehead. He motions Nahj over to him.

                NEVIK
What happened? He used the pharangar? On the energy field?

Nahj is too overcome to speak. He nods, while watching the medic place
Wesley on a biobed, Beverly give him an injection, and place a neural
scan over his head.

                NEVIK
(sits back, more tired than he's ever felt before)
I never thought it would go this far.

PAN TO:

Wesley is being treated and monitored by Beverly.

                BEVERLY
He's in a coma. Two cc's of vasoneural stimulant.

                NEVIK
Don't wake him. It could be disastrous.

                BEVERLY
What do you know about this?

                NEVIK
He was using the Pharangar--he attempted to study the energy force
surrounding us--the Zemen.

                BEVERLY
You know what it is?

Nevik nods.

                BEVERLY
And my son?

                NEVIK
He's experiencing massive sensory overload. The coma protects him from
further input. He needs to come out of it on his own, and he should...

                BEVERLY
Should?

                NEVIK
The Pharangar has been used only by trained Navarons for centuries.

CLOSE UP:

Beverly reacts to this bitter information--her greatest fear realized.
She continues to monitor Wesley and starts a nutrient IV.

A sweep of Sickbay reveals Nevik has gone. Beverly looks up and notices
he's missing. She keys her insignia.

Nevik is back, lying on a biobed, weak and shaky. Beverly is

angry. She gives him an injection. Nahj, agitated and anxious, paces
between Nevik's bed and Wesley's.

                BEVERLY
(to Nevik)
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

Picard and Data enter. Wesley can be seen lying unconscious on a biobed
in the background.

                BEVERLY
(looks up at Picard)
I'm hoping the neural path regulator will slow down his processes
enough so I can try micro-surgery. His brain fissure is widening.

(Nods acknowledgement)
 Magister, we need some answers.

                NEVIK
(struggles for full alertness)
I thought there was still time... foolish to think I could take care of
this secretly... foolish not to prepare you sooner.

You're saying this extraordinary energy field is some sort of waste
product?

                NEVIK
(nods)
When a Magister opens his mind with the sensory amplifier, this energy
is discharged interdimensionally. Through mind discipline, the magister
pushes the Zemen to the uninhabited outer reaches of the galaxy.

What is it doing here?

                                
                NEVIK
As the Magister ages, his ability to control the Zemen weakens.

                BEVERLY
Your brainstorms...

                NEVIK
Yes. They are caused by my incomplete ability to discharge the energy.

                PICARD
What can we do?

                NEVIK
I know of only one solution. The energy has an interdimensional aspect,
paralleling the mind amplification through dimensional realities. If I
could beam into the field my energy will neutralize it, send it into a
barren dimension.

                DATA
Question: Even if you neutralize the Zemen in this way, won't there
still be an interdimensional rift?

                NEVIK
The rift is necessary for the Pharangar to operate. It is controllable.

                DATA
Captain, if Nahj were able to use the Pharangar to create a safe
transport path through the field, we could beam the Klaxtor survivors
aboard and give ourselves more time to work out a permanent solution.

                PICARD
Would that work?

                NEVIK
Nahj is able to block out the Zemen--he could use his mental barriers
to create a free zone through the zemen without exposing his mind to
it. It is not beyond his abilities.

They all turn to look at Nahj, speculatively.Wesley stirs in his coma.
Beverly goes over to his bed, scans his brain activity, frowns. He
mumbles and she leans over to hear him. She straightens up.

                NAHJ
What does he say?

                BEVERLY
"Plug the dike."

Crew reacts with puzzlement.

EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

The Enterprise is at full stop within the energy field. The freighter
can be seen through the radiant fog.

                PICARD (V.O)
Captain's log, supplemental. Nahj prepares for a novel use of the
Pharangar--creating a corridor of safety through the negative neural
ionic interdimensional discharge field created by Magister Nevik's
lifetime use of the mind amplifying device. Through this corridor we
will beam aboard the freight crew and cargo from the Klaxtor.

INT. ENTERPRISE-PASSENGER QUARTERS

Nahj is seated in the meditation chair, Data holds the Pharangar.
Riker and Picard watch. Data places the helmet over Nahj's head.

                DATA
(holding helmet)
This technology is most intriguing. The biochemical computer conduits
are more sophisticated than any design I've ever seen.

                NAHJ
There isn't much you have to do, Data, but your part is essential. I
haven't learned to break the connection-that's the most difficult part
of using the Pharangar. Even Nevik had some difficulty doing it and
usually relied on me to remove the helmet.

                DATA
Why is that?

                NAHJ
Part of it is the seduction of processing sensory data at such a
phenomenal rate--the richness of the experience is beyond imagination.

                DATA
And the rest of it?

                NAHJ
The Pharangar works on the cellular level of the brain. The inhibitions
of the cerebral cortex, which allows effective action by dampening
nonessential sensory input are held in abeyance. I may know that a
certain action is necessary just as I may know any input--but acting on
it while wearing the Pharangar requires special training.

                RIKER
Then how are you going to create a pathway through the energy field?

                NAHJ
The Zemen is unique, since it is a by product of the Pharangar. It can
be manipulated through concentrated thought.

Data goes to computer console and analyzes energy field.

                DATA
The Zemen is growing stronger, exponentially. 

                RIKER
Are you ready, Nahj?

Nahj nods.

                RIKER
Let's do it.

Data places Pharangar over Nahj's head.

CUT TO:

INT. - TRANSPORTER ROOM THREE

O'Brien is at the console, Beverly and three medics are standing by
with medical kits

                O'BRIEN
I can't get a lock on the crew members;  their life signs are too weak. 

                BEVERLY
You could beam us over and get a lock on our communicators.

                O'BRIEN
That would work.

                BEVERLY
We'll need oxygen packs and biosuits.

O'Brien opens a wall storage unit and removes four oxygen packs and
four biosuits--coveralls of thin, silvery material.

                BEVERLY
We don't have much time.

The medical team hurriedly put the biosuits over their uniforms. Each
holds an oxygen pack and mask as they step on transporter pad. O'Brien
energizes and they dematerialize.

INT. FREIGHTER - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

The freighter bridge is small, utilitarian, bare and a little run down.
The freighter has lost most of its power source, and the ship is dimly
lit.The medical team materializes and puts on oxygen masks. All five
freight crew members are on the bridge and unconscious.  One medic runs
off the bridge and down a corridor.

INT. FREIGHTER - CARGO BAY

The medic enters from the corridor, places her communicator on the
cargo (a supply of plague vaccine), and quickly exits, returning to the
bridge.

INT. FREIGHTER - BRIDGE

The rest of the medical team examine the freight crew members, scanning
them quickly. The medic returns from the Cargo Bay. Beverly taps her
communicator.

                BEVERLY
Ready to beam aboard.

INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM THREE

                O'BRIEN
Transporter lock is now secure.

O'Brien energizes. 

INT. FREIGHTER - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

The nine figures flicker, begin to dematerialize, then return to solid form.

INT. ENTERPRISE - PASSENGER QUARTERS

Nahj, under the Pharangar, his knuckles white, is obviously having a
hard time maintaining his concentration. Riker exchanges a look of
concern with Data.

INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

Picard, Worf, and supernumeraries are staring tensely at the MAIN
VIEWER, concerned by what they see. The clear space between the
Enterprise and the Klaxtor flickers out and in several times, then
finally stabilizes again as a clear, clean open space, surrounded by a
very active, thick, milky white radiant cloud of energy.

                INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM THREE (OPTICAL)

O'Brien is resetting transporter controls, then as he finishes...

                PICARD'S COM VOICE
Energize. Now.

O'Brien energizes..The four members of the medical team and five
Klaxtor crew members materialize. The patients are all still
unconscious. Beverly and the medics go into action. Two medics wheel
the gurneys into position. One patient begins to come around. Another
crewman regains consciousness and staggers to his feet. The medics
place two unconscious figures on the gurneys. Another crew man starts
to become conscious and staggers to his feet. One crew member is near
death and Beverly gives this one a heart stimulant, still on the
transporter pad.

                BEVERLY
(indicating the crew member she's treating)
Transport us directly to sickbay.
(taps communicator)
Dr. Selar, prepare 2 cc's protodynaplasm, and intensive care unit. 

O'Brien transports Beverly and crew member. The medics escort the two
ambulatory freight crew members, wheeling two gurneys with still
unconscious patients out of transporter room 3, clearly on their way to
sickbay.

                O'BRIEN
Crew transport successful, Captain. Now beaming cargo to Cargo Bay Two.

CUT TO:

INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY

Sickbay is a beehive of activity. Wesley, still unconscious, is on life
support. Two crew members are sitting, obviously weak and confused.
Troi is talking with them, assessing their mental state. A doctor comes
up and gives the two patients a liquid to drink, and a hypo. Another
patient is in the biosupport unit, still unconscious; Beverly attends
this one. The last two are on regular biobeds, and now conscious, but
too weak to move. Nevik is sitting in a biosupport chair, awake, alert,
and in anguish, knowing he is responsible for this disaster. Troi,
sensing his pain, gives the crew member she's talking with a few
parting words of encouragement and walks over to Nevik. On the way, she
pauses by Wesley's biobed, getting a reading on his emotional state.
Troi then pulls a chair up to Nevik's side.

                TROI
Wesley is feeling awe and wonder.

                NEVIK
That is a good sign. He has a strong mind.

                TROI
You are blaming yourself.

                NEVIK
I was arrogant to think I could carry on till Najh was ready to take over. 

                TROI
You did what you had to.  You have helped many people in your life.

                NEVIK
It doesn't balance out.I've harmed Wesley, these people (gestures to
Klaxtor crew) and who knows how many others have died because they
didn't receive the plague vaccine in time.

                TROI
No one can control everything.

                NEVIK
Perhaps that is our mistake. The Navarons try.


Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi, and Nahj enter sickbay to confer with
Magister Nevik.

                NEVIK
I'm afraid you've only postponed the inevitable, Captain.

                PICARD
I hope you're wrong. We're here to discuss our alternatives.

                                DATA
There is a way to neutralize the Zemen without sacrificing the
Magister. Since the energy cloud consists of negative neural ionic
interdimensional discharges, an amplification of positive neural ionic
interdimensional energy beamed in to the field would counter its
force.

                GEORDI
Do we have the technology to do that?

                DATA
Not at this time.

                PICARD
Data, we need more than theory.

                DATA
If Najh created a pathway for the Enterprise to exit the Zemen, it
would give us more time to consider a permanent solution.

                RIKER
Isn't that asking a lot? We almost lost our medical team last time.

                DATA
It will require fifty-five seconds at quarter impulse to set precision
warp co-ordinates. At warp 6, we can exit the field in .06 seconds.

                NAHJ
(anxious to please)
Less than a minute? I could hold the energy barrier for that long--I think.

                RIKER
Are you certain? All our lives are at stake, Mister.

                NEVIK
Nahj may get the Enterprise out of the energy field for a short time,
but as long as I am here, the attraction cannot be counteracted.

                DATA
That's true, but there will be a delay factor which will give us the
opportunity to devise a permanent solution.

                RIKER
The whole plan hinges on Nahj's ability to control the Pharangar. It's
a long shot.

                PICARD
It's our best option.

CUT TO:

EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

The Enterprise, still engulfed by radiant cloud.

CUT TO:

INT. ENTERPRISE-MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

Picard, Worf, and Troi are in their usual places. Supernumeraries at
CONN, OPS and aft stations.

                PICARD
Ready to begin exit procedure, Number One?

                RIKER'S COM VOICE
Ready, sir.

                PICARD
Begin.

                WORF
A path through the zemin has opened up at bearing 025, mark 4.

                PICARD
On main viewer.

Angle on the MAIN VIEWER -- an elongated egg-shaped space opens up in
front of the Enterprise, free and clear of all electro-chemical
activity, and surrounding it is the now very active Zemen, thick, milky
white, radiant, and with frequent flashes of lightning. The free space
does not extend all the way out of the Zemen--the exit is not
complete.

                PICARD
Number One, A space has been cleared in front of the Enterprise--but it
doesn't extend to the end of the energy field. Any explanation?

                RIKER'S COM VOICE
Data says the Zemen has gotten too powerful for Nahj to create a path
all the way through it.

                PICARD
Understood. We'll proceed. CONN, set course.

                CONN
Course laid in.

                PICARD
One quarter impulse power. Take it slow.

                CONN
Aye, sir.

CUT TO:

EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

The ship creeps along pathway, which continues to open up ahead of it.

CUT TO:

INT. ENTERPRISE - PASSENGER QUARTERS

Nahj is wearing helmet, deep in concentration. Data is monitoring his
status with tricorder. Riker observes. Suddenly there is a thunderous
crash and the ship lurches wildly. Nahj flies off his chair, the helmet
goes rolling. Data lurches after it. Riker holds on.

INT. ENTERPRISE-BRIDGE

The Bridge officers hold on as the ship lurches wildly.

                                                        FADE OUT.

END OF ACT FOUR


ACT FIVE

FADE IN:

After a few hideous moments of violent shaking,the ship stabilizes.
Picard looks around to ascertain any obvious serious damage to crew or
equipment. The supernumerary at the CONN station picks himself up from
the floor, obviously shaken from his fall.
		PICARD
Ensign, are you alright?

                ENSIGN
(a little shaky, but assuming CONN station, beginning to run diagnostic
on his equipment)
Yes, Captain, I'm fine. Checking for damage--CONN is in good working
order.

Picard turns his attention back to the main viewer:all the bridge crew
follow suit.On the view screen the exit path has closed up. The
Enterprise is completely surrounded by the energy cloud and it is so
dense now that visibility is less than fifty feet.

                PICARD
Damage report.

                WORF
Minor damage to navigational shield. Moderate damage to outer hull,
secondary hull holding.

                PICARD
Casualties?

                WORF
Coming in... Five injuries, all minor.

CUT TO:

INT. - PASSENGER QUARTERS

Nahj is near tears, with shame and frustration. Data is holding the
Pharangar. Riker looks at Nahj, questioning.

                NAHJ
The zemen has grown too strong for me to control.

Riker places a reassuring hand on Nahj's shoulder.

CUT TO:

INT. - SICKBAY

Picard enters, followed by Data and Riker. Beverly, Troi, and Nevik are
already present. Nevik looks weak and ill. Wesley can be seen in the
background, still unconscious.

                NEVIK
As I weaken, the Zemen draws energy--whether I'm using the Pharangar or not.

                DATA
We're running out of time, Captain. The radiation level is increasing
and even without a direct hit, the thermal energy will begin burning
through the hull in fourteen minutes.

                NEVIK
There is only one solution. You must take it now, Captain.

                DATA
I differ, Magister. It may be possible for me to use the Pharangar,
since Nahj is unable.

                RIKER
You, Data?

                DATA
Since I already process sensory information far beyond humanoid
capacity it is possible that I will be able to use the pharangar
without ill effects.

                BEVERLY
You're guessing, Data.

                DATA
I have analyzed the structure of the Pharangar and although some of the
design puzzles me, there is nothing it can do that my self-correcting
program cannot counteract.

                NEVIK
It is the Zemen you have to worry about--as it grows stronger it could
over power whoever uses the Pharangar. Even you.

                PICARD
Opinions?

                TROI
We seem to have a choice between the certain death of Magister Nevik
and the uncertain fate of Commander Data.

                BEVERLY
And the lives of the crew hang in the balance.

                DATA
Captain, if I fail, there will still be time for Magister Nevik to beam
into the energy field.

                RIKER
And we will have lost both of you.

                PICARD
There is great risk in either alternative. If Commander Data is willing
to attempt the use of the Pharangar, I will allow it. I will not,
however, command you to do this, Data.

                DATA
I am willing.

                RIKER
Let's get moving.

INT. - PASSENGER QUARTERS

Riker, Data, and Nahj, are present. Nahj is ill at ease, but game to
play his part.

                NAHJ
My turn to assist you, Data. Concentrate your will on opening the path
through the Zemen. If you lose that concentration even for a moment...

                DATA
I understand.

INT. - SICKBAY

CLOSE UP: Wesley begins to stir on biobed. He opens his eyes, looks
around. Camera shows his P.O.V. as he notices the freighter crew being
treated. MEDIUM CLOSE UP as Wesley tries to puzzle out that somehow the
crew has been rescued. He has no idea how long he's been out or what
else he may have missed. He feels anxious, confused. One of the medical
staff notices he's awake and signals Beverly, who comes over to his bed
and takes his hand gently. She's greatly relieved.

CUT TO:

INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

Geordi is at OPS, Worf at Tactical, supernumeraries at CONN and other
stations. CLOSE UP on Picard, staring intently at Main Viewer. Pull
back to MAIN VIEWER which shows a dense radiant fog so thick the
freighter can no longer be seen.

                RIKER'S COM VOICE
Captain, are you ready?

                PICARD
Ready.

INT. - SICKBAY

Wesley is struggling to sit up. Beverly is scanning him--he's alright,
though very weak still.

                WESLEY
How?... Captain Picard?

                BEVERLY
Your questions can wait. You need to concentrate on regaining your strength.

                WESLEY
I must know. Are we out of the energy field?

                BEVERLY
Not yet, but we should be any minute.

                WESLEY
(eyes widen with alarm)
How?

                BEVERLY
Data's going to clear a path--using the Pharangar.

        WESLEY
The energy field...the Pharangar...they are connected...it could kill
him if he doesn't know how to control that connection.

                BEVERLY
Nevik would tell him of any danger...

                WESLEY
He doesn't know...He's too close to it. I've got to tell Data...

                BEVERLY
(alarmed, keys insignia)
Commander Data...

                RIKER'S COM VOICE
Data is under the Pharangar, Dr. Crusher. This better be urgent.

Beverly and Wesley exchange looks of dismay.

                BEVERLY
Wesley is conscious and has vital information about the danger tge
Pharangar and Zemen pose.

INT. - PASSENGER QUARTERS

Data is wearing Pharangar, Nahj is monitoring him, while Riker watches.

                RIKER
(to Nahj)
Remove the Pharangar--seems we have a problem.

                PICARD'S COM VOICE
Number One-why the delay?

Before Nahj can remove the Pharangar, Data suddenly removes it himself.
Nahj is taken off guard by his abrupt movement--usually impossible for
a novice. Data stands, picks up the Pharangar with his hands, and
without saying a word, exits the room. Riker takes a half second
reaction time, then follows.

INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR

Data strides rapidly down the corridor. Riker catches up to him.

                RIKER
Data, stop. What are you doing?

                DATA
(maintains fast, deliberate pace)
I cannot delay, and it would take too long to explain. Magister Nevik
was right about one thing: there is only one solution.

INT. - TRANSPORTER ROOM TWO

Data turns into Transporter Room Two. Riker follows. Data quickly sets
transporter controls.

                RIKER
I won't let you beam yourself out there, Data.

Data gives Riker a split second look of surprise, then places the
Pharangar on transporter pad and activates transporter beam. The
Pharangar dematerializes.

INT. - MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

Close up on Picard, staring at Main Viewscreen, amazed. Pull back for
reactions of Troi and Worf and the Supernumeraries filling the other
stations. PAN to MAIN VIEWER--The energy field is rapidly disappearing
through a spatial rift, which would be invisible were it not for the
radiant energy fog slipping into it. The Zemen completely disappears,
leaving empty, clear space. The freighter is again in view.

                BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
Sickbay to Bridge. The fissure in Magister Nevik's brain has started
healing-spontaneously.

                PICARD
Data, what did you do?



INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM TWO

                DATA
I healed the rift with the material originally torn from the
interdimensional barrier-the Pharangar. In essence, sir, I plugged the
dike.

INT. - MAIN BRIDGE

Picard and the rest of the Bridge crew look relaxed for the first time
in a long while.

                PICARD

Captain's log, Stardate 44249.5. As soon as we deliver the plague
vaccine to Biranda IV, we will convey the Klaxtor to Starbase Farragut
for repairs. In the meantime, Magister Nevik is making a miraculous
recovery.

INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY

Nevik is sitting up, looking better, more spry and robust. Beverly is
scanning him. Wesley is up and watching.

                BEVERLY
It's amazing. Your brain fissure is completely healed.

                NEVIK
I haven't felt this good in years-not since I was an apprentice.I'd
forgotten what it felt like.

                WESLEY
What are you going to do now? Without the Pharangar?

                NEVIK
Difficult question. I feel like I might live long enough to answer it.

Nahj enter sickbay.He is downcast, a complete contrast to Nevik's
surprising lightheartedness.

                NEVIK
(continuing)
Why so glum?

                NAHJ
I've failed you. I've failed Navaron.

                NEVIK
Nonsense. You're feeling bad because you now have what you wanted:
freedom to choose your own path. Don't feel guilty. You did your best.

                NAHJ
We haven't been without a Magister for millennia.

                NEVIK
The change will do us good. We needed shaking up.

                BEVERLY
You need to rest. Your recuperative powers are astounding, but there
are some residual effects.

                NEVIK
With the Zemen gone, I could live a long time. We have long travelled a
solitary path, Nahj. Perhaps its time we joined together with others of
good will.

                NAHJ
The Federation?

Nevik nods.

                WESLEY
You could go to Starfleet.

Nahj begins to brighten.

                NEVIK
I've learned our knowledge, our wisdom, is not sufficient. Somewhere
along the way we lost humility -- our humanity.

INT. - ENGINEERING

Data and Geordi are working on repairs at the main console--nothing
urgent to their movements; they have plenty of time. Geordi,
preoccupied, pauses and looks up at Data.

                GEORDI
What was it like?

                DATA
The Pharangar?
(pause)
It was more wonderful than I can express.

EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

The Enterprise is in orbit around Navaron.

                PICARD (V.O.)
Captain's log, stardate 44253.2. We are returning Magister Nevik and
Nahj Caputin to their home planet, Navaron. The Magister has convened
an assembly of elders. If they assent, the Federation will have a new
member.

INT. - TRANSPORTER ROOM THREE (OPTICAL)

Picard, Wesley and Riker are in dress uniforms, O'Brien is at
Transporter console. Nevik and Nahj have all their equipment with them.
Nahj pulls Wesley aside.

                NAHJ
(hands Wesley glowing medallion)
I want you to have this as a remembrance.

                WESLEY
I'll see you at Starfleet Academy.

                NAHJ
May it be so.

                O'BRIEN
Transporter Co-ordinates locked on.

                PICARD
Good-bye, Magister, and good-luck.

Nevik nods. The two Navarons step on transporter and dematerialize.

FADE OUT.

END OF ACT FIVE
