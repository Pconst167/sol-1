SECTION ONE OF "STARS AND BLIGHTS FOREVER":
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doug Vermes
                      "Stars and Blights Forever"

      Millions of individual stars twinkled in the vast emptiness
of space. Each with its own message. Peace and tranquility was
ubiquitous here. Suddenly a massive object soared through the
blackness of space at tremendous speed. The peace was disturbed
by a starship. The starship had just a few words printed on it: U.S.S.
Enterprise. NCC 1701-D.

      "Ensign Crusher, what is out ETA?" This question was spoken
by a middle-aged man of about average height. What little remained
of the man's hair was already gray. Nevertheless, he had an air of
superiority about him. The fact that he posed the question as an
order signified that he was in charge. His outfit was essentially
the same as everyone else's: one-piece, with a standard-issue
Starfleet communicator attached to one side. On his right lapel
were his rank markers; four solid markers. Four solid markers,
according to Starfleet regulations, signified the Captain of a
starship. He was standing in a saucer-shaped room, accompanied
by many other similarly attired officers. However, none of the others
had more than three rank markers. At the front of the room, taking up
nearly the whole wall, was the viewscreen. It currently showed the
vast field of space through which they were travelling. Ensign
Crusher, a lad of no more than eighteen, turned to the Captain.
     "Estimated Time of Arrival is approximately twelve hours from
now, Captain." the Ensign said.
     "Good. I will be in my quarters if you need me. Number One, you
have the bridge." The Captain stood up and walked a few paces
away. A man with a beard, a Commander by the three solid rank
markers he wore, presumably 'Number One,' replaced the Captain's
position. The Captain walked off the bridge into the Turbolift.

     Many lights were flickering rapidly, and warning buzzers were
going off in the control room of another spaceship. A short man,
middle-aged, wearing brown and black checkered trousers, a short
scarf, an eccentric tie, and a brown sports jacket had a very
concerned look on his face. He was not alone, though. In the same
room, whose walls had a unique depressed circular pattern, was a
younger girl with blonde hair. She wore a red shirt, and a black
jacket which had 'Ace' emblazoned across the back.
     "Professor!" she called. The man ignored her.
     "Doctor! What's happening?" she called.
     "I don't know, Ace! We're being pulled off course!" The man,
known as the Doctor, spoke with a Scottish accent. Suddenly,
as if hit by an inspiration, the Doctor struck the control console
with the edge of his fist forcefully. Suddenly all the buzzers
and lights stopped. The central column started rising and
falling.
     "You see, Ace, there's no need to worry!" The Doctor gave Ace
a childish grin.
     "Professor, you sure know how to fly this thing!"
     "Oh, it's not my fault! I've been meaning to rep..." The Doctor's
voice trailed off as he glanced back at the central column, which
was slowing down. "...That's odd. We appear to be landing."
     "You were saying?" Ace asked mischeviously. The Doctor
flashed her an intolerant look and then he began to flip switches
and read various screens on the console. The central column
slowed almost to the point of a complete stop.

    The Captain was sitting in his room, reading Shakespeare,
when the communications unit buzzed in.
    "Captain Picard, we're approaching our destination." the voice
of 'Number One' said. Picard took off his reading glasses and
walked out of his room, en route to the bridge.

    On the bridge, the doors to Turbolift Two slid open. Captain
Picard walked onto the bridge and resumed his seat. The
viewscreen showed a blue planet. He turned to 'Number One.'
    "Commander Riker, reports?" Picard asked.
    "Nothing unusual to report." Riker responded routinely.
Suddenly the whole bridge was jolted violently.
    "Red Alert!" Picard ordered. The klaxon alerts sounded
instantaneously. The viewscreen showed the planet becoming
rapidly smaller and smaller until it no longer was visible. This
took place in a matter of seconds.

Ok, here we go... Section Two of "Stars and Blights Forever":
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    "Captain. It would appear that we have been somehow
'relocated.'" an officer in a yellow outfit with very pale skin noted
 cooly.
    "Substantiate, Mr. Data." Picard ordered.
    "We are approximately two thousand light years from our
previous position." Data responded. Data was an android, which
explained his extremely calm manner.
    "Two thousand? But's that not possible!" Ensign Wesley
Crusher responded with boyish surprise.
    "Captain! Another spaceship is approaching at Warp 9.6!" A
Klingon attired in Starfleet uniform informed the Captain of this fact.
    "Onscreen, Mr. Worf!" The klingon, Worf, pressed a button and
the image of a large square-shaped spacecraft filled the screen. Picard
 stood up.
    "The Borg!" he uttered in a worried tone. Out of nowhere, faintly,
a strange wheezing, groaning sound filled the air inside the Enterprise.

    "Commander Data, what is that sound?" Picard asked.
    "Checking... No record of that sound in my data banks, Captain."
Captain Picard tensed, ready for whatever might come.

      Inside what appeared to be a conference room, a Police Box stood.
This was quite an incongruous sight, considering that here was a
twentieth century Earth object in a twenty-fourth century Earth
spaceship. However, this was not just an ordinary Earth Police
Box. It was, in fact, a Time and Relative Dimensions in Space
Capsule; TARDIS for short. The doors to the Police Box opened,
and out walked the Doctor, followed by Ace.
      "Where are we, Professor?" Ace asked. She started walking
around the room, looking at their surroundings.
      "I'm not quite sure..." The Doctor looked out the window.
"Ahh! We seem to be on a spaceship."
      "How do you know that?"
      "Look." He pointed out the window, into the black emptiness
of space. He turned around and closed and locked the door to the
TARDIS.
      "Hang about, Professor! I thought we were supposed to be
going to visit twelfth century England!"
      "Nobody's perfect, Ace!" The Doctor picked up a tricorder
which was laying down on the table. "However, this object is from
Earth. Twenty-fourth century, I'd guess." Ace resumed looking around
the room. She turned and saw a closed doorway.
      "Hey, I wonder where this leads!" Ace asked rhetorically. She
started toward the doors.
      "Ace!" The Doctor hurried after her, quite concerned.

      Captain Picard was still quite worried.
      "How did we get here?" Picard asked himself. Suddenly, the doors
to the Captain's ready room, where he held private
conferences, slid open. Picard sprung up. Through the doors
walked the Doctor and Ace.
      "Now, Ace. How many times have I told..." The Doctor noticed all
the officers on the bridge. "...Oh, hello!" He said quite flippantly.
      "Who are you?" Picard demanded.
      "This is Ace, and I'm the Doctor. Who are you?" The Doctor
spoke as if he were introducing himself to old friends.
      "I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship
Enterprise. Now, what are you doing on the bridge? How did you
get here?" Picard barked.
      "Well... I.. Hmm.... It's a bit difficult to..." The Doctor turned
and looked at the viewscreen. "Ah! A Borg spacecraft. Hmm... Very
nasty race." Riker was temporarily startled by this discourse.
      "What do you know about the Borg?" Riker asked the Doctor.
      "Oh... No more than any other traveller." the Doctor responded.
While Picard was about to ask more questions about the Doctor, a
Borg suddenly materialized in the middle of the bridge. Worf
ripped out his phaser and shot the Borg down.

Here's Section Three of "Stars and Blights Forever"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
      "No!!!" the Doctor shouted. Another Borg materialized and
Worf took a shot at it. However, this time, the Borg deflected the
shot. Worf increased the phaser intensity and tried again. This
time, he was successful. "No! This will not work! They'll just
adapt!" the Doctor shouted.
      "Yes, but what else can we do, Doctor?" Picard asked
rhetorically. Nevertheless, the Doctor responded.
      "Confuse it! Sever its link with the Borg conscienceness." the
Doctor exclaimed. Another Borg materialized. Worf took many
shots at it, but they were all in vain. The Borg walked over and
extracted the main data core from the main computer on the
bridge. Before anyone could stop him, he vanished.
      "Oh, splendid. Now the Borg have access to all knowledge
contained in our computers. What's more, we can no longer
use our computer!!" Picard declared angrily.
      "Captain, the Borg ship has entered warp drive. It is
approaching Warp 9.9999996." Data noted.
      "You had something to do with this, didn't you, Doctor?!"
Picard demanded.
      "No... " The Doctor was abruptly cut off by Picard.
      "Lieutenant Worf! Escort these.... intruders to the brig!"
Picard barked. Worf, who was pretty ferocious looking, grabbed hold
of Ace and the Doctor.
      "NO!!! I can assure you. We had nothing to do with this!
We've only just arrived..." the Doctor said desperately.
      "Really? And how exactly did you get here in the same
quadrant as us?"
      "Well... We were on our way to Earth when we were pulled
off course by something... Then, we finished up here." the Doctor
said.
      "Captain, they might've encountered the same thing we did."
Riker hypothesized. Picard motioned away Worf and pulled the
Doctor aside.
      "Commander La Forge, prepare transporters. We're going to
beam an away team to the Borg ship." Picard ordered.
      "No can do, Captain. The Borg ship is surrounded by a graviton
forcefield. Our transporters can't penetrate it." La Forge remarked.
Picard grunted.
      "Look, Doctor. If you are telling us the truth, then we need your
help. You must help us to recover our data core." Picard asked.
      "Well, I'll do whatever I can to help."
      "Good. We'll need to transport to your spacecraft." The Doctor
frowned at this.
      "Ahh..." the Doctor said a little angrily.
      "Doctor, we must get to the Borg ship! The only way to
do that is if you help us, and allow us to transport to your
ship!"
      "Oh... Well... If you must. Ace, you stay here!"
      "Professor! I want to go with you!" Ace complained.
      "You will stay here, Ace!" the Doctor ordered.
      "Number One, Commander La Forge, Worf,  Counselor Troi,
Doctor Crusher, you will be in my away team. We are going to
attempt to pursue the Borg in the Doctor's vessel." Picard ordered.
The away team started walking toward the Turbolifts, along with
Data. "Captain Picard! This way." The Doctor motioned toward the
ready room doors. The away team followed the Doctor through the
conference room doors, with puzzled looks on their faces. Picard
caught up to the Doctor, just as they were entering the ready
room.

As faithful as ever, here is Section Four of "Stars and Blights Forever"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
      "Doctor! Where do you think you're going?" Picard asked.
      "To the TARDIS... er, my spaceship."
      "Yes, but the transporter room is on Deck Te...What is that?!"
Picard noticed the TARDIS sitting in the conference room.
      "It appears to be an artifact from Earth, twentieth century, to
be precise." Data noted.
      "Data, we need you to stay on the Enterprise. You have the
bridge, Mr. Data." Picard ordered. "What is that?" Picard
repeated his question, still astonished by Data's comment. Data
was about to answer again, but Picard motioned him to leave the
ready room.
      "It's the TARDIS!" the Doctor responded gleefully. The Doctor
unlocked the doors and opened both of them. "In you go!" The away
team hesitated. The Doctor gave Picard a reassuring nod.
      "Follow his instructions!" Picard ordered. The confused away
team slowly entered the doors of the TARDIS.

    Suddenly, everyone found themself in the brightly lit console
room of the Doctor's TARDIS. The away team stared around in sheer
disbelief.
    "This can't be. How is this possible? Is it kind of like a
Holodeck?" Commander La Forge asked.
    "No, no... Relative dimensions... no time to explain!" The Doctor
pushed a red lever on the console, and the double doors to the
TARDIS slid closed with an eery hum. "Now, let's see if I can get a
fix on the Borg ship. What direction was it heading?"
    "Sector Seven, heading Mark Five." La Forge replied. The Doctor
flipped a switch and the scanner screen slid open. He underwent a
complicated procedure of turning dials and flipping more switches.
Finally, the Borg ship appeared on the scanner screen.

    "My God! There it is!" Picard replied. The Doctor flipped a few
more switches, and the central column began to rise and fall. The
TARDIS was in flight.

    A while later inside the TARDIS, in a room with many lounge chairs
and umbrellas, everyone was relaxing.
    "Doctor, I still don't understand how this TARDIS can be so big!"
La Forge stated.
    "It's all quite simple, really. It's dimensionally transcendental."
the Doctor remarked in a tone which said that he expected La Forge to
understand it all from that explanation.
    "But I still don...." La Forge was cut off by Picard.
    "Shouldn't we be concerned more about the Borg and the Enterprise's
data core?" Picard interjected.
    "Yes... Captain Picard has a point." the Doctor agreed. Suddenly,
the whole TARDIS shuddered violently.
    "RED ALER....." Picard cut himself off as soon as he remembered
where he was. A sound filled the whole TARDIS. The Doctor's
expression became quite serious.
    "What is it?" Riker asked.
    "The TARDIS cloister bells....." the Doctor responded...
    "The what?" Picard asked sternly.
    "It means imminent disaster for the TARDIS." There were a few
moments of deathly silence. "Quick! The console room!" The Doctor
leaped out of his chair and sprinted out of the room. The others got up
and followed him.

Here's Section Five of "Stars and Blights Forever"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Once the others had caught up with the Doctor in the console room,
he was already staring at the open scanner screen with discontent. The
others glanced at it.
    "Captain, the Borg attached their tractor beam to the Doctor's ship.
We're being pulled within range of their disruptor beam." La Forge
commented.
    "How long before we are in range?" Riker asked.
    "I can't tell you exactly, but it'd have to be pretty soon!"
    "Doctor, we've got to get out of here!" Riker said impatiently.
    "Yes.. I quite agree with you. I'll try and materialize on board the
Borg ship. Hold tight, everyone!" The Doctor flipped some switches and
the TARDIS shuddered a bit more violently than the Doctor had expected,
knocking Picard off his feet. Picard's head hit the floor with a thud,
and he went unconscious. The central column slowed to a complete stop,
and ceased being lit.
    "Doctor!" Riker barked.
    "Yes?" The Doctor and Doctor Crusher answered simultaneously.
The Doctor grinned, but his grin quickly vanished as he
remembered the seriousness of Picard's situation.
    "I mean, Doctor Crusher! Can you help him?" Riker asked.
Apparently, Riker was not amused.
    "Well, I can try to stabilize his condition. But I can't bring him
'round." Doctor Crusher answered.
    "Why not?"
    "The replicator doesn't work without the computer, I couldn't
bring any medication." She began to attempt to stabilize Picard.
    "Damn!" Riker activated his communicator. "Riker to Enterprise."
Silence. "Riker to Enterprise."
    "That won't work in here, I'm afraid." the Doctor said. "He'll just
have to stay in here while we go and recover the data core." The Doctor
began flicking switches and dials and pressing numerous buttons on the
console at lightning speed.
    "Doctor Crusher, remain here with the Captain."
    "Yes, Commander." she answered.
    "Now, Doctor. You, Geordi, Deanna, Worf, and I will enter the Borg
ship." Riker ordered.
    "Yes, Commander." the Doctor responded, in a playful tone. The
Doctor pulled the red lever which operated the doors, and they slid
open. Worf and Riker pulled out their phasers and prepared themselves
for combat. The five walked out of the TARDIS.

    Inside the massive Borg ship, the Police Box exterior of the TARDIS
seemed a tiny incongruency. The Doctor locked the door to the TARDIS.
    "Will, I'm sensing the massive Borg consciousness. They are aware
of our presence." Counselor Troi remarked. Suddenly, a Borg stepped out
of one of the many cubicles and started marching toward them. Worf
fired, hitting the Borg point blank. The Borg fell to the ground,
de-activated.

    "No, no, no, no, no, no.... That's not the way to do it!" The Doctor
pulled out a cylindrical device with a bullet-shaped head and walked
toward a large metal box which was near them. The Doctor twisted the
bottom of the device and held in near the center of the right side of
the box. The device emitted a faint whirring noise. The cover of the box
suddenly slid off, revealing a mass of wires. The Doctor reached into
the box and ripped out the wires. Suddenly, the whole ship seemed to
silence. "There we go." The Doctor smiled.
    "What have you done?" Riker asked.
    "If I'm right, he's severed the link with the Borg consciousness."
La Forge postulated.
    "Deanna?"
    "I am no longer sensing the Borg consciousness." The away team
silenced while that fact fully registered. Worf stared needles at the
Doctor.
    "What have you done?" Worf demanded in his deep Klingon voice.
    "Well, I've put the Borg out of action, so to speak." the Doctor
responded quite proudly.
    "Permanently?" Riker questioned.
    "No, no! Temporarily, Commander Riker, temporarily..."
    "We'd better search the Borg ship. Deanna, maintain vigilance with
the Borg. At the first sign of any Borg consciousness, I am to be
informed immediately." Riker ordered.
    "Yes, Commander." she complied.

Ok... Section Six of "Stars and Blights Forever".
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Inside the TARDIS, Doctor Crusher was beginning to get impatient.
She glanced at Picard's prostrate form and back at the console. She
paced back and forth, thinking of something that she could do. She
walked over to the central console.
    "Computer." She decided to try to access the ship's computer. There
was no response. "Computer!" she reiterated. Still silence. She flipped
a few switches. Nothing happened. She flipped a few more. Suddenly
she heard a humming sound. She spun around. The scanner screen had
slid open. It showed the inside of the massive ship. She smiled.
    "Now that's more like it!" she said.
    "Doctor..." a faint voice croaked. It was Picard.
    "Jean-Luc, don't try to move."
    "Beverly... I don't think I can stay conscious for much longer..."
Picard's words took extreme effort on his part.
    "Hang on, Jean-Luc. I'll try and find some medical supplies."
'Easier said than done, Beverly. ', she thought. She left the console
room and wandered through the corridor. "Well... A ship so small on the
outside couldn't be TOO much larger on the inside," she said to
herself. She was never more wrong. She wandered further and further
around. Corridor after corridor all looked the same to her.
Nevertheless, she was determined to find some sort of medicine.
She opened door after door. Finally, after what seemed to her like
hours of walking around in this maze, she found a storage cabinet.
Inside was a box which seemed to be a first aid kit of some kind.
Satisfied with this discovery, she headed back to the console room.

    The away team was cautiously making their way around the seemingly
out of action Borg ship. Riker had a look of uneasiness on his face. The
Doctor, however, seemed quite calm. They continued their search.

     Back on the Enterprise, Ace was getting worried. She paced back
and forth on the bridge.
     "What's taking them so long?" She asked, semi-rhetorically.
     "I cannot hypothesize as to that. I do not possess enough
information." Data responded. Ace walked over to the science section
of the computer.
     "You've got some ace hardware!" she remarked.
     "I am not familiar with your terminology. Please clarify." Data
requested.
     "What? What do you mean?"
     "I do not understand the word 'ace', that you used. Is Ace not your
designation?"
     "Designation? Oh! It's nothing... Just an expression for something
really neat."
     "Neat. Tidy. Clean. I understand."
     "No! Not 'neat' as in tidy, neat as in 'cool'."
     "'Cool'. Expression of something which attracts the interest of
the speaker. I see." Data added this word to his data bank. Ace started
playing around with the computer. "You are not permitted to do that,
Ace."
     "Oh, come on, Data!" Ace begged.
     "Come on where?" Data inquired.
     "Never mind." Ace responded touchily. Momentarily, an expression
of confusion appeared on Data's face. Then, he resumed his normal
activities. Ace sat down in the First Officer's seat, and waited
impatiently.

     Half an hour after finding what Doctor Crusher assumed was a
medical kit, she re-entered the console room, extremely out of breath.
     "My God! This place is a maze!" Doctor Crusher said to herself.
She opened up the medical kit to reveal numerous complex pieces of
medical equipment. She handled each one carefully, examining them for
some clue as to what they might do.

     The away team so far had been unsuccessful in their search. Riker
was getting more impatient.
     "Doctor, where is the data core?" He asked rhetorically.
     "Oh how should I know!" The Doctor responded, nevertheless.
     "What about Captain Picard? He might be in grave danger." Riker
hypothesized.
     "No, I shouldn't think so. Doctor Crusher must have found the first
aid kit in Store-Room Three by now! She can't help Picard without it."
Suddenly a thought struck the Doctor. "Oh!!!"
     "What?" La Forge asked.
     "She'll have no idea how to use the medical facilites! The
equipment of your time is primitive compared to my medical kit!" Riker
rolled his eyes.
     "Well, what can we do?" Riker asked.
     "I think I'd better get back to the TARDIS."
     "No, Doctor. We need you here! Your presence is imperative if we
are to recover the data core."
     "Well SOMEONE has to go back to the TARDIS!" Riker thought about
this for a moment.

Now, here is Section Seven of "Stars and Blights Forever"!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
     "Geordi, you'll go back."
     "Yes, Commander Riker." La Forge responded.
     "Now... Geordi... Let me explain the medical kit... " The Doctor
proceeded to run down a long list of complex descriptions and technical
information. Despite its apparent complexity, Geordi seemed to
understand it.
     "Commander, I think now that we've shut down the Borg
Consciousness, I should be able to rig up something on the Enterprise
to allow transportation to and from the Borg ship."
     "But how will you get back to the Enterprise?" Riker asked.
     "He can go in the TARDIS," the Doctor answered.
     "But I can't operate the TARDIS!" La Forge blurted out.
     "Oh, don't worry! I already set the coordinates for the Enterprise.
All you have to do is to go in, close the doors, and press the third
switch on the bottom of the panel closest to the interior doors. It's
gray, I think." the Doctor said. "Key!" The Doctor tossed Geordi one
of the keys to the TARDIS as the thought struck him.
     "Well...."
     "Go on, Geordi." Riker ordered. La Forge starting going back to
the TARDIS. Suddenly, he spun around.
     "Commander! You'll probably need my tricorder." La Forge
commented. He proceeded to give the tricorder to Riker.
     "Good point, Geordi. Thanks." La Forge walked away and the Doctor,
Riker, Troi, and Worf continued on their search. The Borg ship, along
with the Borg, seemed quite dormant. Riker flipped open the tricorder
and began to take readings.
     "Hmm... It doesn't seem to tell us much." Riker commented.
     "Let me see that..." the Doctor said, with a gleam in his eyes. The
Doctor had a look of extreme concentration on his face as his fingers
played across the keys of the tricorder at amazing speed. A few
moments later, the Doctor stopped his reprogramming. "There we go!
This should help us find the data core!" the Doctor remarked quite
triumphantly. Riker snatched it away and looked at it.
     "This way." he pointed in the direction that the tricorder gave
the largest reading from.

     La Forge had a bit of difficulty finding the TARDIS in the massive
Borg ship but, surprisingly enough, he managed to find it relatively
quickly. He removed the key from his pocket, unlocked the doors to
the TARDIS, and walked in.

     Inside the TARDIS, Doctor Crusher heard a humming sound and
saw the interior doors open. La Forge walked in.
     "Geordi!" she remarked with surprise. La Forge pushed the red
door lever on the console and the doors slid closed.
     "Hello, Doctor Crusher. How's the Captain?" he asked.
     "Not too well. I found what I think is the medical kit, but I
haven't the faintest idea how to use it!" she said.
     "Yeah... The Doctor said you'd have a problem, so he sent me
here. First, let's get back to the Enterprise."
     "But, how-"
     "The Doctor says the coordinates are already set! Here's hoping!"
He flicked the third switch on the bottom of the panel closest to the
interior doors. It was blue. The time rotor lit up and the central
column began to steadily rise and fall. "Now... Let me explain how to
use the medical equipment..." He recounted the whole lecture the Doctor
gave him. Once he finished, Doctor Crusher understood how to use
everything. She fished out the device that supposedly had the "deep
healing beam," and applied it to Picard. Five minutes later, Picard
regained consciousness. He sat up slowly and looked around as his vision
cleared. Doctor Crusher was astonished at how quick the recovery was.
She marvelled at the living proof that medical technology more advanced
than what she possessed existed.
      "Geordi... Beverly..." Picard smiled as he saw Doctor Crusher.
"Where..." He looked around and remembered he was in the TARDIS.
"Where is the rest of the away team?" he asked.
      "They're out on the Borg ship trying to recover the main data
core." La Forge replied.
      "I must join them." Picard stood up.
      "That's not possible, Captain." La Forge remarked.
      "Why not?"
      "The TARDIS is on its way back to the Enterprise."
      "How were you able to operate it?"
      "The Doctor had preset the coordinates."
      "I see." Picard had just finished speaking these words when the
central column slowed to a complete halt. The time rotor was no longer
lit. Picard was the first to notice this. "Geordi, the column has
stopped moving."
      "You're right, Captain. I think we've landed." La Forge remarked.
      "Let's open the doors then." Picard ordered. La Forge pulled the
door lever and the doors slid open. They walked out.

Section 8 of "Stars and Blights Forever"!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
      In the Captain's ready room, where it had been before, the TARDIS
materialized. On the bridge, Ace, who was half dead from boredom,
heard the materialization sound and jumped out of the First Officer's
seat.
      "Ace, where are you going?" Data inquired. She ran into the ready
room. Picard, Crusher, and La Forge were standing in front of the
TARDIS.
      "Where's the Professor?" Ace asked Picard.
      "Who?" he asked.
      "The Doctor, I mean."
      "He's still on the Borg ship."
      "Captain, I can rig something up to allow transportation to the
Borg ship, now that their defenses are disabled." La Forge commented.
      "Make it so." Picard ordered. La Forge left the ready room.
Picard, deciding there was no reason to remain in the ready room, also
left. He was followed by the Ace and Doctor Crusher.

      Data saw the Captain walk on the bridge and immediately left the
Captain's seat.
      "Captain, was your mission successful?" Data asked.
      "Not yet, Data. The Doctor is still on board with Worf, Counselor
Troi, and Commander Riker." Picard responded. "Any change in status, Mr.
Data?"
      "Negative, Captain."
      "Data, the Doctor has temporarily de-activated the Borg
Consciousness. Would we be able to communicate with the Doctor and
Commander Riker?" Picard asked.
      "If their energy field has been de-activated as well, it should be
possible." Data responded.
      "Well, there's only one way to find out." Picard activated his
communicator. "Picard to Commander Riker." Picard waited for a few
moments. No one responded. "Picard to Commander Riker!" Still no
response. Picard decided he'd de-activate his communicator. Just as he
was doing so, a voice responded through the communicator. The voice was
very faint and difficult to hear. There was a lot of sub-space
interference which broke up the message.
      "...Riker here... see you... well, Captain." Riker said.
      "Commander Riker. What is your current situation?"
      "...Can't...communicat... Repeat... not understa.. Ple... peat..."
      "What is your current situation?" Picard repeated.
      "...Doctor... searching....data core... tricorder... Locate
soon..."
      "Your message is difficult to understand, Number One. Commander La
Forge is preparing to transport us to the Borg ship. I repeat, we will
be beaming to the Borg ship."
      "Understoo.... Await... rrival..."
      "Picard out." Picard de-activated his communicator. "Data, what
was the cause of all the interference?"
      "The remainder of the Borg energy field which surrounds their
ship." Data responded.
      "Commander La Forge, how soon will transporters be ready?" Picard
barked.
      "I'm working on it, Captain! Probably another few hours!" He
responded. Ace, who was tolerating all this, walked over to Picard.
      "Excuse me, Captain Picard?" she asked.
      "Yes, Ace?" He responded.
      "Could I have the key to the TARDIS so I can get some stuff from
the TARDIS?"
      "Well, umm..."
      "I just left a few things in there! I'll only be a minute!"
      "Well... I suppose so..." He handed the TARDIS key to Ace.
      "Thanks." she walked into the ready room and entered the TARDIS.

      Inside the TARDIS, Ace went to her room. 'Now where did I put
those canisters of Nitro-9?' she asked herself. She continued searching.

      The doors to Turbolift Four slid open and Commander La Forge
walked on to the bridge. He walked over to Captain Picard.
      "Captain, I've finished re-adjusting the molecular stabilization
ratios and field core integration algorithms on the transporters, so we
should be able to transport to and from the Borg ship now, as long as
they remain inactive." La Forge said.
      "Good work." Picard acknowledged. "Data, prepare any necessities
for away team work and meet me in Transporter Room Two." He ordered.
      "Yes, Captain." Data responded, and then proceeded to leave the
bridge.
      "Ace? Ace?" Picard looked for Ace. Suddenly, the doors to the
ready room slid open, and Ace walked in. "Ah, Ace, there you are. You
will accompany Lieutenant Commander Data and me to the Borg ship."
      "Sure, it's better than being stuck on the bridge!" Ace seemed
excited.
      "La Forge, you have the bridge." Picard ordered.
      "Me?" La Forge dared to question Picard.
      "Yes, you!"
      "Well, it's just that I've never..."
      "You have the bridge, Geordi!" Picard barked.
      "Yes, Captain." he responded.

Ok.. Here's Section Nine of "Stars and Blights Forever"!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
      "Ace, come with me." Picard and Ace walked into Turbolift One.
"Transporter Room One," Picard announced to the ship's computer. Nothing
happened. "Transporter Room One!" he repeated his order. Still no
response. He slapped his communicator on. "La Forge! What is wrong with
Turbolift One?" Picard demanded.
      "Sorry, Captain, but without a data core, the computer can't
operate. You'll need to open the hatch on the side panel of the
Turbolift and manually input the destination." La Forge responded.
Picard grunted and turned off his communicator. Picard glanced around
the Turbolift.
      "What hatch?" he asked rhetorically. Ace popped open the hatch in
question.
      "This one." She grinned. A complex mass of wires and circuits was
inside the hatch. There was also a relatively primitive number entry
pad. Picard entered in a number, presumably the Deck number where
Transporter Room One was located, and the Turbolift started moving.
After a little while, the Turbolift slowed to a halt, and the doors
opened. Picard and Ace walked out. They entered Transporter Room One,
where Chief O'Brien was stationed. Picard stepped on a transporter pad,
next to Data, who was waiting for Picard and Ace, and motioned Ace to
step on a vacant pad.
       "Chief O'Brien, have you located the trace patterns of
either the Doctor, Worf, Counselor Troi, or Commander Riker?" Picard
asked.
       "Yes, I've located all four. However, I'm getting slightly
strange readings from the pattern of the Doctor." O'Brien responded.
      "Never mind that, just put us down near the Doctor."
      "Yes, Captain." O'Brien acknowledged.
      "Energize." O'Brien played his fingers across the transporter
console and with a flash of light, the three away team members speckled
out of existence on the Enterprise.

    Meanwhile, the Doctor was busy searching for the data core. He
possessed the tricorder, and was getting close to the core, by the wild
fluctuation in readings from the tricorder. All of sudden, Captain
Picard, Data, and Ace, materialized beside the Doctor.
    "Ahh, Ace, I thought I told you to stay put!" the Doctor said
playfully.
    "Come on, professor." she responded. Ace put her knapsack on the
ground.
    "Ace! You have to stay on the Enterprise!"
    "Doctor, have you made any progress?" Picard asked.
    "Captain Picard, I see you've made a full recovery! As it happens,
I'm close to the data core, if the tricorder is right. But these
readings keep shifting, it's very disconcerting. Captain, can you beam
Ace back to the Enterprise?"
     "Yes, of course." Picard activated his computer. "Picard to Chief
O'Brien."
     "O'Brien here.' O'Brien responded.
     "Beam Ace back to the Enterprise."
     "Aye, sir."
     "Energize."
     "Doctor!" Ace's last attempt to remain with the away team was in
vain as she slowly dematerialized. Her knapsack, although unseen by the
others, remained. Riker and Worf walked over to the new away team. After
some brief greetings, they went back to work.
     "Let's find the data core." They followed the tricorder readings
for another few minutes, until they stood beside a console of sorts. The
Doctor pulled out his trusty sonic screwdriver and opened up a panel
on the console. Situated right in the center of all the circuitry was
the data core. The Doctor grabbed it out of the circuitry.
    "Captain!" Troi remarked, in a very distressed tone of voice.
    "What is it?" Picard asked.
    "The Borg! The consciousness is back! It just came out of nowhere!"
    "We've got to get out of here!" Riker remarked. Riker hastily
activated his communicator. "O'BRIEN! GET US OUT OF HERE! NOW!" he
yelled. The six began dematerializing. This time, it was a slow process,
due to the power building up in the Borg energy field. However, after
what seemed like eternity, the six rematerialized in the Transporter
Room on the Enterprise. The Doctor noticed, to his surprise, that he no
longer possessed the data core.
    "Where..." the Doctor began to ask, but he was cut off by Mr.
O'Brien.
    "Captain, I have beamed the data core directly back into the main
computer, so all ship functions ought to be operational." O'Brien
commented.
    "Thank you, Mr. O'Brien." Picard responded hurriedly.
    "Quick! The bridge!" the Doctor remarked. They all ran to the
various Turbolifts, accompanied by Ace, who had been waiting in the
Transporter Room. As it happened, Ace, Picard, and the Doctor, ended
up in the same Turbolift.
    "Computer, Express mode to Main bridge." Picard ordered.
    "Acknowledged." the computer responded. The Turbolift gave a little
jolt as it started to move at ten times its ordinary speed. Seconds
later, the Turbolift doors opened, and they all ran onto the bridge. The
menacing image of the Borg ship still lurked on the main viewscreen.
     "Captain, you must get out of here before the Borg ship before they
fully recover!" the Doctor said. At that moment, Worf, Data, and Troi
ran onto the bridge from a different Turbolift. Each ran to their
respective posts.

Here we go! Section 10, the last section, of "Stars and Blights Forever"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
     "Agreed." Picard thought for a second. "Let's get rid of them while
we have the chance. Mr. Worf, load all torpedo bays!" he ordered.
     "Picard, no!" the Doctor remarked.
     "Aye, Captain." Worf responded. Worf pressed a few controls on his
station. "Torpedoes bays loaded."
     "Doctor, we have no other choice."
     "But they are living creatures! They have their right to existence
just as much as you or I do!" the Doctor pointed out.
     "Captain, the Borg ship has regained fifty percent of its power."
Data remarked.
     "Doctor, I must destroy them while I can! Living creatures or not,
they will do nothing but destroy. I cannot allow that." Picard argued.
     "And I cannot allow you to destroy these Borg in cold-blooded
murder!" the Doctor snapped back.
     "I'm sorry, Doctor." The Doctor opened his mouth to protest
further. "Fire." Picard ordered. Worf pressed a few more buttons on his
control panel. The cluster of officers on the bridge watched as the
reddish torpedoes were fired upon the Borg ship. The torpedoes neared
the ship and impacted. Nothing happened. A buzzer sounded.
      "Captain, the Borg's energy field has absorbed the impact. No
damage has been done to the ship or the energy field." Data stated.
      "We're too late!" Picard snapped.

      On the Borg ship, one by one, the Borg stirred and started leaving
their cubicles. The first one out came out near Ace's knapsack. The Borg
picked up the knapsack, inspected it, and then tossed it a bit violently
back to the ground.

      A bright flash spread across the viewscreen. The Doctor covered
his eyes. The Enterprise shook from pieces of the Borg ship which hit
the shields. When the flash faded, the Borg ship had blown up into
thousands of tiny fragments of rubble floating in space. The Doctor took
off his hat and placed it on his chest, and bent his head in respect.
The Enterprise crew was horrified by this action, but, nevertheless,
remained silent.
      "What happened?" Riker asked.
      "I dunno. I would've loved to have blown it up with some of the
Nitro 9 that I made." Ace said. She suddenly realized she was missing
her knapsack. "Hang about! Where's my sack?" Realization hit the Doctor
first.
      "Ace, you left it on the Borg ship! How many times have I told you
not to carry around explosives in your bag!" The Doctor's voice had a
slightly playful tone to it. Ace smiled.
      "Sorry, professor." she responded.
      "Well that's that, then." Picard said.
      "I see you got your way after all, Captain Picard." the Doctor
said with a hint of resentment in his voice.
      "Yes, it is all for our safety, Doctor." The Doctor grunted at
this remark.
      "Come along, Ace. Time we were off." the Doctor remarked in a
slightly disturbed tone of voice. Picard was about to thank the Doctor
for all his help, but caught himself, as he realized that the Doctor
didn't want to destroy the Borg. The Doctor and Ace left the bridge and
went to the ready room.
      "Ensign Crusher, plot course for the nearest Starbase. Warp factor
5." Picard took one last look at the rubble of what was the Borg ship.
"Engage."

    The Doctor unlocked the TARDIS and motioned Ace inside. They walked
in. Inside, the Doctor pressed the lever that controlled the doors.
    "Where to now, Ace?" he asked.
    "I've always wanted to see the Eye of Orion that you told me so much
about." Ace responded. The Doctor considered her suggestion.
    "Agreed." The Doctor smiled. Ace smiled in response, and the two
broke out into laughter.

    With a wheezing, groaning sound, the TARDIS dematerialized from the
Captain's ready room on the U.S.S. Enterprise. On the bridge, after
hearing the dematerialization sound, Captain Picard nodded his head in
respect.
