INTRODUCTION:

First, a BIG thanks to the users of the REC.ARTS.STARTREK and
REC.ARTS.STARTREK.INFO newsgroups on the InterNet, and to the
users of the Star Trek message bases on the VirtualNet.  Without
them, this list wouldn't be here (especially Mark Holtz and Jim
(The Big Dweeb) Griffin.  Thanks, Jim & Mark!).

Secondly, I'd like to respectfully dedicate this file (and its
upkeeping) to Gene Roddenberry.  Gene, I never knew you, and you
never knew me.  But I can't help but feel the impact your
creation, Star Trek, made on me and my character.  I think I'm
probably a better, more tolerant person, thanks to the beliefs
and ideals you instilled in me at an early age.  You shall be
missed.  Hailing frequencies closed, sir.

A:   The order in which the episodes were originally aired.
B:   The episode title.
C:   Paramount's production code number (ST:TNG Episodes) or
     Syndication airing order (ST:TOS Episodes)
D:   The first stardate given in the episode.
E:   Plot synopsis.

In syndication, most stations air the episodes by Paramount's
production code, rather than by airing order.  So if you're
wondering why reruns aren't shown in the order they were aired
(or listed here), that's why.

The stardates given in a Star Trek: The Next Generation episode
follow a general rule:  The first digit, 4, indicates the current
series (Star Trek: TNG). The second digit indicates the season
the episode falls in.  The next three digits indicate how far in
the season the episode is.  A point follows, and then a number
that represents (roughly) what day it is in the episode.  (The
first year, by the way, of Star Trek: The Next Generation is the
year 2364.  The original series took place around 2260, and Star
Trek II occurred in the year 2284.)  This works great for seasons
2-5, but the stardates still skip around a bit in the first
season.  And finally, as always, this listing will be updated as
regularly as possible. Please check your local Bulletin Board
System (BBS) for the latest version.

                  ---==* THE RUMOR MILL *==---

All of the following tidbits are RUMORS ONLY.  If you don't want
to have some future episodes spoiled for you, you may not want to
read any further.  You have been warned.

Whoopi Goldberg will do three more episodes of ST:TNG.  Also,
Nichelle Nichols may appear in a future episode as Guinan's
Mother or Daughter.  (NOTE: The latest rumor on this is Guinan
will appear in either the last 3 or 4 episodes this season, and
possibly the first few episodes of next season.  As of this
writing, she has reappeared in "Imaginary Friend" and "I, Borg".)

Paramount may introduce a homosexual character to ST:TNG.  (NOTE:
It looks like right now they've decided instead to have a
homosexuality- themed episode with "The Outcast")

Future episodes will include:

"I, Borg" - The Borg are back!  Well... at least one of them is.
Geordi takes it upon himself to free an adolescent boy from his
Borg programming, when the Enterprise discovers a crashed Borg
ship.

"The Next Phase" - Experimental Romulan cloaking technology
renders Geordi and Ro Laryn invisible (oops!), and the crew
believes they're both dead.  Rumor has it we'll get to see Data
deliver Geordi's eulogy, and Riker will play the trombone at his
funeral.  We'll actually learn quite a bit about Geordi's family
in this episode.

"Inner Light" - "An alien icon in space has a strange effect" on
Picard.  This episode will feature Patrick Stewart's son, Daniel,
playing (appropriately) Picard's "long-lost son".  I've heard
this will be an alternate reality story, as we'll also see
Picard's "grandchildren."

"Time's Arrow" - The big season finale is coming up...
Apparently, Data travels back in time (with Guinan) to either the
late 19th or early 20th century, where he meets the legendary
author Mark Twain.  The episode was originally not written as a
two-part episode, but will be expanded to become one.  Rumor has
it that our old buddy, Q, will appear either at the end of part 1
or the beginning of part 2.

"Duelling Qs" (Next Season) - From what I hear, it will involve
two Qs challenging each other to a sort of intergalactic
olympiad.  The John DeLancie Q has the Enterprise Crew play on
his team, so to speak.  The other Q is... ready for this?... to
be played by William Campbell (The Squire of Gothos). "Are you
challenging me to a duel?"  This episode may not be filmed due to
projected cost overruns.


We will see (oh, joy) the Enterprise "head" (or bathroom) in an
upcoming episode this season.

The secret of Picard's relationship with Guinan (which has been
hinted at in "The Best of Both Worlds" and "Ensign Ro") will be
revealed before the end of the sixth season.

Both Stewart and McFadden would like to see the Picard/Crusher
relationship explored more.  Stewart has revealed that an
"upcoming episode" will touch on it a little (possibly the
episode "Inner Light?").

We may see a female Q next season (why not?).

Michael Dorn will play a non-klingon role in a guest appearance.

ST:TNG will run for seven seasons, not six, as was initially
reported.

Dr. Pulaski will _not_ appear on ST:TNG again.  

There will no longer be any more episodes with Data emulating
Sherlock Holmes, and "Moriarty" (from "Elementary, My Dear Data")
will not appear again on ST:TNG.  This is because Paramount would
have to pay the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle a licensing fee
(apparently, they were really upset that "Elementary, My Dear
Data" was shot without the above sum being paid.)

AND NOT A RUMOR, BUT... Brent Spiner has released an album of
songs entitled "Ol' Yellow Eyes is Back."  In addition to Spiner,
Patrick Stewart,  Jonathan Frakes, Michael Dorn, and Levar Burton
appear as Spiner's backup singers, "The Sunspots" (on the song
"It's a Sin to Tell a Lie").  I had a chance to listen to it, and
IMHO, it is truly awful.  I mean it.

of the planets in the Solar System to different views of the

From Fourth Season to Fifth Season:

* Title Sequence slightly rearranged with the "ST:TNG" coming out
of a "video-tunnel" effect.

red and black suede jacket.
