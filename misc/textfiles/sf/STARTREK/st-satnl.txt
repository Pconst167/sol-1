    Sensors are picking up an unidentified vessel, Captain, headed straight
    toward us.
     
                              KIRK:
     
    Range, Mr. Sulu?

    Point zero four light years, sir, and closing fast.
     

                              KIRK:
     
    Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency.
     
                             UHURA:
     
    I've been trying to raise them but there's no response, sir.
     
                               KIRK:
     
    (PUSHES BUTTON OR TALKS INTO MICROPHONE)  This is Captain James T. Kirk
    of the starship Enterprise.  Identify yourself. (TO UHURA) Put them on
    the viewscreen, full magnification.

(CUT TO: MOCKUP OF BRIDGE SCREEN ON WHICH IS KEYED A MAROON '68 CHRYSLER
LIMO "DRIVING" TOWARD THE VIEWER THROUGH A FIELD OF STARS WHICH CONTINUALLY
RECEDE, TO INDICATE MOTION ...)
     
    What kind of ship is that, Mr. Spock?
     
                              SPOCK:
     
   Fascinating, Captain.  It would appear to be an early gas combustion

    vehicle, at least two or three hundred years old.
     
                              KIRK:

     

    (TO SPOCK) Run it through the computer.  Find out what those little
    numbers mean.  I want answers.
     
                              SPOCK:
    (TO COMPUTER) Process visual feed.  Analyze and reply.
     
                              KIRK:
     
    I have a hunch, Mr. Spock, that we are about to face a menace more
    terrifying than the flying parasites of Ingraham B; more insidious


    than the sand-bats of Manark 4; more bloodthirsty than the vampire
    clouds of Argus 10.  I have a hunch that "thing" out there is more
    deadly than the Klingons, the Romulans, and the Gorns, all rolled
    into one.
     
(SFX: COMPUTER)
     
(A STRIP OF PAPER COMES OUT FROM CONSOLE ...)
     
                              SPOCK:
     
    Here is the readout, Captain.  The computer has identified the alien
    vessel as a 1968 Chrysler Imperial with a tinted windshield and retrac-
    table headlights.
     
                              KIRK:
     
    And the little blue and orange numbers?
     
                              SPOCK:
     
    That's called a "California license plate", and it's registered, or
    was in 1968, to a corporation known as "NBC".
     
(SFX: COMPUTER SFX)
     
(MORE PAPER STRIP COMES OUT FROM CONSOLE SLOT ...)
     
                              SPOCK: (CONT'D)
     
    Wait, here's something more.  The computer isn't sure, but it thinks
    this NBC used to manufacture cookies.
     
                              KIRK:
     
    Could that (POINTS AT SCREEN) be some sort of illusion, Mr. Spock?
     
                              SPOCK:
     
    It's no illusion, Captain.  Scanner readings indicate two life forms
    inside that craft.
     

                              KIRK:
     
    Mr. Sulu, increase speed to warp factor eight.
     
                              SULU:
     
    But, sir, that's only for the most extreme emergencies.  The ship can't
    take it.
     
                              KIRK:
     
    You heard my order, Mr. Sulu.
     
                              SULU:

     
    Aye aye, sir.

    supplies to Earth Colony 9, we are being chased through space by an

    cookies.  It would all seem silly if it weren't for this feeling of
    dread that haunts me, a sense of impending doom.

(CUT TO: MODEL OF CHRYSLER LIMO, MUCH CLOSER THAN BEFORE)
     
    It's no use.  We can't shake them.

    Then we'll give them a fight they won't forget.  (INTO INTERCOM, WHICH

    Lock phasers on target, Mr. Sulu.
     
                              SULU:
     
    Phasers locked on target, sir.
     
                              SPOCK:
     
    But, Captain, you can't --
     
                              KIRK:
     
    Stand by to fire.

(SFX: FADE WHOOPING ALARM OUT ...)
     
                              SPOCK:
     
    But, Captain, we don't know who the aliens are or what they want.  To kill
    them without warning would be highly illogical.
     
                              KIRK:
     
    Fact -- their intentions are unknown.  Fact -- I am responsible for the
    lives of 430 crewmen.  And, fact -- I can't afford to take any chances.
    (TO SULU) Fire main phasers!  (PAUSE WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS)  I said, "Fire

    Arm and lock photon torpedoes, Mr. Sulu.

    They're not working either, Captain.

    Captain, the helm does not respond.  The controls are dead.

    Well, do something, man.  Go to manual override.  Cut in auxilliary
    systems.

    Well, fix it, Scotty.  I don't care how, but fix it.  The lives of 430
    crewmen hang in the balance.  Kirk out.
     
                              SPOCK:

    Starfleet Command of our situation.

    But how, Bones?  How did they get on board?  Did they beam on? Did
    they suddenly materialize?

    No, they just sort of stepped out from behind the curtains.

    Describe them, Doctor.

    There's two of them.  Bipeds, humanoid in appearance.  Their clothing is
    drab except for a bright piece of cloth worn around the neck of the
    leader.
     
                               SPOCK:
     
    Was there anything else odd about their clothing?
     
                              McCOY: 
      
    I'm a doctor, not a tailor, dammit!  Wait, there was one other thing
     about them that seemed strange.  They spoke English!  Quick, Jim, I
    hear them coming up the turbo-lift!  They'll be here in seconds!

    Of course, if it was up to me you could keep them -- as souvenirs, give

    (TO McCOY) Belay that kind of talk, Doctor McCoy.
     
                              McCOY:
     
    (TO KIRK) Forget it, Bill.  We lost.  It's over.  (TO SPOCK) Are you
    coming, Leonard?
     
(SPOCK TRIES VULCAN NERVE PINCH ON McCOY)

    (A BIT DESPERATE NOW)  Wait, Mr. Spock.  We have yet to try Vulcan
    mind meld, where you actually enter the alien's brain, merge with
    his intelligence, and read his thoughts.
     
                              SPOCK:
     
    I entered Mr. Goodman's mind while you were talking to Dr. McCoy, Captain.

MIND ... )

    (WITH A SHUDDER)  It's okay, Captain.  I'm all right now.
     
                              GOODMAN:
     
    What do you think, Curtis?  Any chance we can sell this junk to
    "Lost in Space"?
     
(CURTIS HAS PRIED APART A SECTION OF THE SET AND IS TURNING IT AROUND ...)

    
                              CURTIS:
     
    Well, it all comes apart.

    (TO CURTIS) Hey, get away from there!
     
(CURTIS DOES NOT TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY, AND THROWS HIM A MOCKING SALUTE)

     
                              CURTIS:
     
    Right on, Buck Rogers!  Is that an order?
     
                              KIRK:
     
    No, it can't end like this.  I won't let it!  This is MY ship!  I give
    the orders here!  I give the commands!  I am responsible for the lives
    of 430 crewmen, and I'm not going to let them down!  There's got to be
    a way out! (POUNDS PANEL IN FRUSTRATION)
     
                              SPOCK:
     
    You are becoming quite emotional, Captain.  Needless to say, my trained
    Vulcan mind finds such open displays of emotion distasteful.  Emotion,
    you see, interferes with logic, and it is only by dealing with problems
    in a logical, scientific fashion that we can arrive at valid solutions.
    Now, with regard to the alien takeover of the Enterprise, I would suggest
    that we seek some new alternative, based upon exact computer analysis, of
    course, and taking into consideration elements of -- (SUDDENLY BREAKS DOWN
    INTO SOBBING WACKO)  Oh, God!  I don't believe it!  We're cancelled! How
    could they do this?  Everybody I know loves the show!  I have a contract!
    What about my contract?  I want my ears back! (ETC ...)
     
                              GOODMAN:
     
    (LEADING SPOCK OFF)  Curtis, can you give me a hand here?
     
                              CURTIS:
     
    I have a couple Valium in my tool box.  Maybe that'll help.
     
(GOODMAN AND CURTIS HELP SPOCK OFF THE SET ... )
     
                              KIRK:
     
    So it's just me, is it?  Well, I've been in tougher spots.  Surrender?
    No way.  I'd rather go down with the ship.
     
                              GOODMAN:
     
    (EXITING)  Oh, Shatner, your agent called you.  Something about a mar-

    Captain's log, final entry.  We have tried to explore strange new worlds,
    to seek out new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.
