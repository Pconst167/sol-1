>StarDate:  UNKNOWN

>Plot Summary:
>   Treva -- a human colony on the fringes of known space.  Isolated from the
>rest of the galaxy, at last report they were on the verge of becoming a
>true interstellar community -- a full fledged member of the Federation.  But
>now the Enterprise has received a distress signal.  Treva is in the throes
>of a violent revolution led by a merciless warlord who has committed
>countless atrocities in the name of freedom.
>   Data and Lt. Tasha Yar are dispatched to investigate.  But once they
>reach Treva, they discover the truth, and any possible solution may be far
>more complex than a simple rebellion.  For Treva's president wants more than
>Starfleet's good words in her fight against the rebels.
>   She wants their weapons.  And before the battle is over, she means to get
>them.  Over Data and Yar's dead bodies, if necessary.

     This novel fills the gap between 'The Arsenal of Freedom' and                   
'Skin of Evil'.  Ms. Lorrah gives a fascinating look into Tasha
Yar's past, and invents fabulous characters which are so uncommon
in the rest of the series.
     Dialogue, plot, and characterization are all excellent, and
the premise is quite sound..

Next: Vulcan's Glory


>TOS #44  Vulcan's Glory                         Copyright February 1989
>Author:    D.C. Fontana
>StarDate:  UNKNOWN
>
>Plot Summary:
>   Here is a very special STAR TREK novel -- from the woman consistently
>voted by the fans as their favorite writer from the original STAR TREK
>television series!
>   D.C. Fontana, writer of such classic STAR TREK episodes as "Journey
>to Babel" and "This Side of Paradise," here brings us the never-before-
>told story of a very young Mr. Spock, on his first mission aboard the 
>U.S.S. Enterprise.  You'll also meet Captain Christopher Pike and his
>enigmatic first officer "Number One" (previously seen only in the orig-
>inal STAR TREK pilot "The Cage"), as well as the ship's brand new
>engineering officer, Montgomery Scott.
>   VULCAN'S GLORY is the tale of Spock's struggle to reconcile his many
>obligations -- those forced on him by his Vulcan heritage, and those
>chosen by him upon his elistment in Starfleet -- to balance the wishes
>of others against the desires of his own heart.

     This is the kind of novel we could use more of.  Something fresh
and inventive, and most especially, well written.  D.C. Fontana has
written a fascinating tale about Spock's first adventure aboard the
Enterprise.  
     The characters are alive and interesting, the plot is solid,
and the dialogue is more realistic than any I've seen in a Trek novel
in some time.  This is a Must-Read(tm), folks.

                                [Vulcan's Glory]

Next: Strike Zone


>TNG  #5  Strike Zone                            Copyright March 1989
>Author:    Peter David
>StarDate:  UNKNOWN
>
>Plot Summary:
>   Deep in the uncharted regions of our galaxy, a primitive, warlike
>race -- the Kreel -- have stumbled upon weapons powerful beyond their
>wildest imaginings.  The Kreel have used those weapons to attack their
>most bitter enemies -- the Klingons.
>   Now Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise have
>been called in to mediate the dispute.  The Enterprise will ferry diplomatic
>teams from the two warring races to the source of their conflict -- the
>mysterious planet where the weapons were discovered -- in an attempt to find 
>a peaceful solution to the conflict, and discover the origins of the 
>super-powerful weapons.
>   Before the galaxy erupts into full-scale war...

     Peter David seems to have a magic touch when it comes to writing
Star Trek novels.  This is an at-times humorous, adventuresome tale,
with a subtle, tongue-in-cheek condemnation of the arms-race.
     The characters are vivid and real, and the plot rolls along
nicely, with no noticeable holes.

                                [Strike Zone]
               Characterization:  5

Next: Double, Double


>TOS #45  Double, Double                         Copyright April 1989
>Author:    Michael Jan Friedman
>StarDate:  4925.2

>Plot Summary:
>   On a routine exploratory mission, the Starship U.S.S. Hood picks up
>a distress signal from a research expedition thought lost long ago --
>the expedition of Dr. Roger Korby, one of the centuries' greatest
>scientific minds.  Korby himself is dead, it seems, but his colleagues
>have made a most incredible discovery -- a discovery they insist the

>mayhem and murder.
>   And puts an inhuman stranger with his memories and abilities in
>command of the Enterprise.

     For an author who has done such generally *good* work as Michael
Jan Friedman, this is an incredibly pitiful novel.  It seems almost
like (dare I say it?) *plagiarism*.
     This one is a decent adventure story, in a way.  Someone who has
never seen "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" might indeed enjoy it.
But I found it to be consistently predictable, and at times, even
*boring*.  I find there's very little to recommend this novel.

                                [Double, Double]
               Characterization: 3+

Next: Power Hungry


>TNG  #6  Power Hungry                           Copyright May 1989

>Plot Summary:

>Federation's only allies in a critically important sector of space -- the
>crew finds a brutal dictatorship -- one more concerned with preserving its

>Captain Picard is hesitant about turning over the supplies to the
>corrupt government:  he fears they may never reach their intended
>destination.  But can he convince the ruling council to change their
>ways, before it is too late -- for the government, and Thiopa itself?

     Weinstein delivers a thoroughly enjoyable, if not thoroughly
solid piece.  The dialogue and characterization are a bit shaky, 
but the plot holds them up nicely.

                                [Power Hungry]

Next: Masks


>TNG  #7  Masks                                  Copyright July 1989
>Author:    John Vornholt
>StarDate:  UNKNOWN
>
>Plot Summary:
>   The Enterprise journeys to Lorca, a beautiful world with a feudal
>culture where the inhabitants wear masks to show their rank and
>station.  There, Captain Picard and an away team don masks of their own
>to begin a quest for the planet's ruler and the great Wisdom Mask that
>the leader traditionally wears.  Their mission: to establish diplomatic
>relations.
>   But shortly after transporting, Picard and his party lose contact with
>the ship, and Commander Riker leads a search party down to the planet to
>find them.
>   Both men, however, are unaware that their searches -- indeed, the ship's
>entire mission -- are part of a madman's plan.  A madman who is setting the
>stage for a trap that will ensnare both Enterprise landing parties, and
>leave him poised to seize control of the awesome Wisdom Mask...
>   And the planet Lorca itself.

     Unlike some of his most recent work, _Masks_ is an absolutely                       
great piece of work.  Mr. Vornholt creates a splendid culture for
the people of the planet Lorca -- a medieval society where one's
mask determines one's status...
     Characterization is right on target, and the plot couldn't
possibly get any better.

                                [Masks]

Next: The Captain's Honor


>TNG  #8  The Captain's Honor                    Copyright September 1989
>Authors:    David and Daniel Dvorkin
>StarDate:   41800.9
>
>Plot Summary:
>   A series of vicious attacks by the enigmatic M'Dok Empire has devastated
>the planet Tenara -- bringing the Enterprise and another Federation
>starship, the Centurion, to the planet's aid.  The Centurion's captain is
>Lucius Sejanus -- a powerful magnetic man who favors taking a far stronger
>stance against the M'Dok than Captain Picard.  And as the conflict
>escalates, Sejanus's instincts seem to be correct... for it appears only

>   Now the people of Tenara must decide which path they will follow -- the
>way of peace, or the road to war.  But unknown to any,  one of the
>Centurion's officers has made that decision for them -- and plans to
>provide a full-scale ware between the Federation and the M'Dok Empire!

     This novel relies heavily on the Starfleet-officer-gone-bad schtick,                      
and sours about half way through.  The characters aren't quite right,
and the plot is slow as molasses at points where it shouldn't be.
     Even for all that, this is still your average adventure story.

     I have to agree with the publishers about this novel.  Ms. Dillard
has novel easily equal to _Spock's_World_.  This is a truly great story,
with solid plot, and interesting characters.
     I had a slight problem with the apparent ease with which Kirk was
talked into accepting promotion into the Admiralty, but that's a small
sticking point.
     One more book which can be called a Must-Read(tm).

     This one goes into my top five *worst* Star Trek novels of all 
time... (It makes the top *three* worst TOS novels.)  
     The author seems to have the idea that tossing in a few familiar
characters (Flint, Pal, Jahn, etc...) will make for a great story.  
But she's just proved herself wrong, as this never even approaches 
greatness.
     The narration is heavy-handed, the dialogue is strained and
out of character, and the plot moves along like a drunken mime.
This book, overall, is just plain *TEDIOUS* (I barely forced myself
to finish reading it), and that's a pretty sad statement.

     This is a good novel.  It is unique in one respect: it is the one and
only time that the character of Dr. Katherine Pulaski aspires to be anything
more than a McCoy-clone.

     This novel is thoroughly enjoyable; it's a fine accounting
of some of our heroes' antics during their Academy days, centered
around the Kobayashi Maru scenario...
     The plot is solid, the characterization well done... I can't
find much room to fault this one.  High marks.
