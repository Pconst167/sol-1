Hi,

This is the teaser to the second script I sent in somewhere in July.  The 
rejection came three months later.  There are some slight similarities to "
Attached", which I didn't know about when I wrote it, and "The Inner Light", 
which I hadn't seen at that point.  But I hope you enjoy it nevertheless.


        STAR TREK: "Heritage" - REV. 20/06/93 - TEASER

                            TEASER

FADE IN:

1.   EXT. ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT AROUND ALPHA KORONOS.         1.

                         PICARD (V.O.)
               Captain's log, Stardate 94877.6. 
               The Enterprise has arrived at
               Alpha Koronos where we are to
               commence proceedings which will
               hopefully result in the
               Koronosians becoming a permanent
               member of the Federation.

2.   INT. WORF'S QUARTERS.                                  2.

     The small room is bathed in a dim, red light,
     illuminating the assortment of weapons that line the
     far wall in a hellish glow.  The bowed figure of a
     small klingon boy is outlined against this warlike
     setting, and the whispers of a klingon ritual flow
     from his mouth.

     WORF moves from the far side of the room to sit
     beside the boy, ALEXANDER.  He doesn't speak until
     Alexander has finished the chant.

                             WORF
               I am proud of you.

     Alexander remains silent.

                         WORF (CONT.)
               What is it?

     Alexander does not answer; instead he continues to
     focus his attention on the weapons that line the
     wall, and on the bat'telh in particular.

                         WORF (CONT.)
               Alexander, if there is a
               problem, if you do not wish to
               go through with this, you must
               be open with me.

     Alexander stands up and leaves the room, leaving
     Worf to ponder.

3.   INT. CORRIDOR.                                         3.

     PICARD, RIKER and DATA make their way towards the
     Transporter Room.



                             RIKER
               Universal translators....?


                            PICARD
               That's what they ordered so
               that's what we sent them.  And
               I'm hardly in a position to feel
               offended.  I can't speak their
               language; there's no reason why
               I should expect them to speak
               ours.

                             RIKER
               Agreed.  They didn't ask to join
               the Federation; we asked them.

                            PICARD
               From what I have heard, their
               culture... their way of life...
               means a great deal to them. 
               They wish to preserve it with as
               little chance of pollutants
               creeping in as possible.

                             RIKER
               Well, if they're afraid of us
               polluting their traditions why
               are they even considering
               joining the Federation?  They'll
               be opening themselves to an
               armada of different beliefs and
               values....

                             DATA
               There is a lot to be gained from
               experiencing other's values and
               beliefs, Commander.  It is not
               necessary for them to change
               merely by making those
               experiences available to them. 
               Perhaps this is something they
               realise.

                             RIKER
               Perhaps.  It still seems a
               little strange to me, though.

     The three officers enter the Transporter Room.

4.   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM.                                 4.

     PICARD, RIKER and DATA enter and look to the ENSIGN
     stationed behind the transporter console.




                            ENSIGN
               Three ready to beam up, sir.

                            PICARD
               Make it so, Ensign.

     Three beams of energy sparkle and coalesce on the
     transporter pad, forming into KORTAR, the Koronosian
     Ambassador and his two Assistants.  Each has a
     strange device strapped around their mouth with a
     similiar electronic apparatus covering the right
     ear.

     Picard steps forward to greet them as they step off
     the pad.

                        PICARD (CONT.)
               Ambassador Kortar, it is good to
               finally meet you in person.

     When the Ambassador speaks, there is a slight
     electronic tingle to his voice as the universal
     translator interprets the essence of his speech.

                            KORTAR
               Thank you, Captain.  I too have
               been looking forward to our
               discussions.

                            PICARD
                     (Indicating Riker)
               This is my First Officer,
               Commander William Riker....

                             RIKER
               A pleasure, sir.

     Kortar nods a greeting to Riker.

                            PICARD
               ...and Lieutenant-Commander
               Data.

                             DATA
                         (To Kortar)
               Grash-kalla, Ambassador.

     Kortar removes the universal translator mouthpeice
     momentarily.

                            KORTAR
               Grash-kalla.







                             DATA
                         (To Riker)
               I accessed all information on
               Koronosian culture from the
               language banks.

     Picard moves towards the door.

                            PICARD
               If you will step this way,
               Ambassador.

     Picard, Riker, Data, and the three Koronosians exit
     the Transporter Room.

5.   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE.                               5.

     PICARD, RIKER, DATA, KORTAR and his two Assistants
     sit around the table.

                            PICARD
               I assure you, Ambassador, your
               people will lose nothing.  They
               stand only to gain.

                            KORTAR
               I appreciate your attempt to
               quell any misgivings we have,
               Captain.  But you cannot
               understand our ways, nor what we
               stand to lose.

                             RIKER
               Sir, there is a great variety of
               races and cultures, all in the
               Federation, who feel as you do. 
               They maintain their way of life,
               their values.  At the same time
               they work within the Federation
               and reap the rewards.  The only
               thing they lose is isolation.

                            KORTAR
               I am sure that is the case,
               Commander.  But you must
               appreciate my scepticism when
               faced with the future of my
               people... our society... all
               that we hold dearest.

                            PICARD
               We appreciate and respect your
               reservations, Ambassador....

                                                  (CONTINUED)


                        PICARD (CONT.)
               However, there is little else we
               can offer you other than our
               assurances.

                            KORTAR
               That is true.  And we've argued
               this point for well over the
               time duration given to this
               meeting.
                    (Pauses)
               Perhaps before you make such
               guarantees you should experience
               our culture first hand,
               Captain.... Understand for
               yourself what we fear losing.

     Picard and Riker look at one another uncertainly.

                            PICARD
               Thank you for your offer,
               Ambassador.  I am truly grateful
               for such an oppurtunity. 
               However, we were hoping to begin
               discussions on the matter of
               joining....

                            KORTAR
               I empathize with your position,
               Captain.  After all, the
               Federation has matters of
               greater importance to attend
               to....

                            PICARD
               It is not that, Ambassador.  I
               am merely concerned that this
               may delay any agreement between
               our two societies....  An
               agreement which will bode well
               for both our peoples.

                            KORTAR
               Perhaps it will facilitate our
               talks.  A far greater
               understanding of our respective
               situations can only assist us in
               these discussions.

     Picard is silent for a moment.  Riker continues to
     stare at Kortar and his Assistants dubiously.

                            PICARD
               Agreed.  Very well, Ambassador. 
               I would be delighted to take you
               up on your offer.



     Kortar stands up, as do his Assistants.  Picard,
     Riker and Data do so as well.

                            KORTAR
               Very good.  We will transmit a
               time and co-ordinates to you
               shortly.  I look forward to...
               educating you, Captain Picard.

     Picard nods while an obviously uncomfortable Riker
     glances at him, then back at the Koronosians.

                                                       FADE
OUT.

        STAR TREK: "Heritage" - REV. 20/06/93 - ACT ONE

                            ACT ONE

FADE IN:

6.   EXT. ALPHA KORONOS: ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT.               6.

                         PICARD (V.O.)
               Captain's Log, Stardate 94878.2. 
               I have been given the
               opportunity to experience
               Koronosian culture first-hand. 
               Though this detour from the
               scheduled discussions may result
               in a delay, the chance of
               strengthening ties through an
               exploration of each other's
               cultures is too compelling to
               refuse.

7.   INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS.                                7.

     PICARD is packing clothing and other items into his
     carry-bag when his door chimes.

                            PICARD
               Come.

     The door slides open to reveal RIKER standing in the
     doorway.  Picard looks up, then resumes packing.

                        PICARD (CONT.)
               Well, get on with it.

                             RIKER
                       (Entering room)
               Get on with what?

                            PICARD
               Telling me that I'm being
               careless, rash, reckless,
               unthoughtful.....

                             RIKER
               Why do you need me to tell you
               that.  You seem to know it all
               already.
                (Looks in bag Picard is packing)
               Besides, why are you packing all
               this?  I thought you were there
               to experience their culture, not
               pollute it, remember?

     Picard halts packing and sighs.




                            PICARD
               You're right.  What am I doing
               with all this?

     He starts unpacking most of his belongings again.

                             RIKER
               So you're really going ahead
               with this?

                            PICARD
               I agreed to do it, Will.  Not
               like I can back out now. 
               Besides, it should prove a
               worthwhile experience, getting
               to see how others view the
               world.

     Riker picks up a bottle of red wine that is lying
     next to the open bag.

                             RIKER
               And this?

                            PICARD
                 (Taking bottle from Riker)
               Chateauneuf-Du-Pape.  A taste of
               French life.  From one culture
               to another.

     Picard places the bottle in his carry bag, which he
     then closes.

                             RIKER
               I'm not entirely pleased about
               this, you know.

                            PICARD
               I know.

                             RIKER
               Perhaps if I could accompany
               you....

                            PICARD
               You know they're only allowing
               one person down there, Will.  To
               keep the contamination to a
               minimum.

     Riker nods his head.

                             RIKER
               You ready?

     Picard takes a final look around his Quarters.


                            PICARD
               I think so.

     The two exit Picard's Quarters.

8.   INT. CORRIDOR.                                         8.

     PICARD and RIKER make their way to the Transporter
     Room.

                             RIKER
               I still can't believe I'm
               letting you do this.

                            PICARD
               Not like you have a choice.

9.   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM.                                 9.

     PICARD heads for the transporter pad as RIKER
     watches.  The ENSIGN behind the console studies the
     read-out before her, then looks up.

                            ENSIGN
               They're ready to receive you,
               sir.

                            PICARD
               Excellent.  Energize.

                             RIKER
               Enjoy yourself, Captain.

     Picard nods a thanks to Riker as the beam envelops
     him and he disappears.

10.  INT. TEN-FORWARD.                                      
10.

     WORF and TROI are sitting at one of the tables, each
     enjoying a drink.

                             WORF
               I just don't understand.  It is
               not like I am forcing him to
               endure it.  He has chosen to
               undergo the rite out of his own
               free will.

                             TROI
               I understand.  But he might not
               see it that way.  The Age of
               Ascencion is an important time
               for a Klingon and he may feel
               that you would want him to go
               through it.


                             WORF
               It is a time when a Klingon
               becomes a true warrior, and yes,
               I would be proud to see him pass
               through.  It is a test of
               endurance, of a Klingon's
               mettle.

                             TROI
               But he has also spent a fair
               amount of time on Earth, among
               humans.  He is also K'Ehleyr's
               son and she was half-human.  By
               going through with this Klingon
               ritual, he may be feeling that
               he is being untrue to her, to
               how she raised him, her values.

                             WORF
               It is true that K'Ehleyr was a
               little more lax.  She did not
               hold as much respect for Klingon
               traditions as I do.

                             TROI
               Talk to him.  Make him
               understand that you are not
               pushing him into a decision.  If
               he is only accepting those
               values because they mean
               something to you, he is doing a
               dis-service, not only to himself
               but also to those values that
               you wish him to uphold.

11.  EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE.                                 
11.

     The wind sweeps over the arid landscape, kicking the
     sand and dust up into the air.  Through the
     resulting haze, a city comes into view.

12.  INT. KORTAR'S ABODE.                                   
12.

     KORTAR and an Assistant are sitting in his office,
     decorated by various sculptures and paintings
     indicative of his people and their lifestyle.  Both
     look up from the work they have been studying as
     Picard enters with his carry-bag, accompanied by two
     other Koronosians.
                            KORTAR
                      (To Koronosians)
               Doohrt.

     Picard watches the two Koronosians, who accompanied
     him, exit the room.  Kortar lifts a universal
     translator mouthpeice to his mouth.



                        KORTAR (CONT.)
               Captain.  Thank you for coming. 
               Please sit.

     Picard turns to admire the various works of art that
     are scattered around him.

     He moves forward and seats himself in a chair on the
     other side of the table from Kortar and his
     Assistant.  Both Koronosians ignore him, continuing
     with their work and speaking in their own tongue,
     having removed their translators from their mouth
     but still retaining the receiver in their ears. 
     Picard continues to look around him uncomfortably.

     Finally, Picard has had enough.

                            PICARD
               Excuse me, gentlemen.  But I
               don't understand a word of what
               you are saying....

     Kortar looks up at Picard, then moves the translator
     mouthpeice into position.

                            KORTAR
               Do not be concerned, Captain
               Picard.  You will shortly.

13.  EXT. ALPHA KORONOS: ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT.               
13.

     The Enterprise continues to circle Alpha Koronos,
     now passing over the night side of the planet. 
     Small groupings of lights from cities can be seen
     dotting the surface.


14.  INT. READY ROOM.                                       
14.

     RIKER is sitting alone in the Captain's chair,
     looking slightly tired.  A warm mug of coffee is
     steaming beside his hand.

     Reaching a decision, he punches a knob on the desk's
     comm-panel.

                             RIKER
               Mr Sterez, is there still no
               response from Captain Picard?

                         STEREZ (V.O.)
               I'm sorry, sir.  We've got a
               lock on his communicator, but we
               have yet to receive a reply to
               any of our signals.


                             RIKER
               Very well.  Please get me
               Ambassador Kortar.

                         STEREZ (V.O.)
               Aye, sir.

     There is a slight pause, then the image of
     Ambassador KORTAR appears on the view screen on the
     Ready Room desk.  He has obviously been getting
     ready to sleep.

                             RIKER
               I apologize for having disturbed
               you, Ambassador.  But I am
               wondering if I may have a word
               with Captain Picard.

     Kortar hesitates, reaches off-screen to the
     universal translator, then holds it in position.

                            KORTAR
               Would you please repeat,
               Commander.

                             RIKER
               Would it be possible for me to
               speak to Captain Picard?

                            KORTAR
               I'm sorry, Commander.  But the
               Captain has had a long day and
               has decided to retire already. 
               I will inform him of your call
               when I speak to him tomorrow.

                             RIKER
               If it is not too much of an
               inconvenience, sir, I would
               appreciate.....

                            KORTAR
               Forgive me, Commander.  But I
               will not be able to reach
               Captain Picard tonight.  You
               will have to try again tomorrow.

     Riker is about to speak, but Kortar cuts the
     communication off and the screen darkens.

15.  INT. BRIDGE.                                           
15.

     RIKER exits the Ready Room and moves to DATA, who is
     working at one of the aft stations.  The rest of the
     Bridge is mainly populated by those working night
     shift.


                             RIKER
               Mr Data, it's good to see you're
               still awake.

                             DATA
               Sir?

                             RIKER
               Are sensors picking up the
               Captain's communicator?

     Data's fingers dance over the panel before him,
     then:

                             DATA
               There we are, Commander.

                             RIKER
               Scan for human life signs in
               that vicinity.

     Data is silent for a moment as he carries out the
     command.

                             DATA
               The sensors can detect no human
               life signs in that area, sir.

16.  EXT. ALPHA KORONOS: ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT.               
16.

                         RIKER (V.O.)
               First Officer's log, Stardate
               94882.6.  It has been a little
               over twenty-four hours since
               Captain Picard beamed down to
               the surface.  Since that time
               there has been no word from him. 
               Sensors also indicate that he
               has been seperated from his
               communicator, his only link to
               the ship.

17.  INT. READY ROOM.                                       
17.

     RIKER sits behind the desk, staring at the image of
     KORTAR on the viewscreen before him.

                             RIKER
               Ambassador, I understand your
               reluctance to allow other
               members of my crew to beam down,
               but under the circumstances....






                            KORTAR
               An agreement was made between my
               government and the Federation,
               Commander; that no one will
               transport to Alpha Koronos
               unless authorized by us to do
               so.

                             RIKER
               With all due respect, I have
               lost contact with my Captain....

                            KORTAR
               I give you my solemn word that
               he is quite safe, Commander...

                             RIKER
               Not good enough, Ambassador.

                            KORTAR
               You do not trust my word? 
               Commander, your conduct is not
               helping the fragile relationship
               between our two peoples.

                             RIKER
               Ambassador, I need....

     The image of Kortar disappears, to be replaced by
     the empty darkness and the reflection of Riker's own
     frustrated face.

18.  INT. MAIN ENGINEERING.                                 
18.

     WORF enters the Engineering section a little unsure. 
     He looks around, his eyes finally finding GEORDI,
     who is working with two other officers to repair a
     faulty panel.

     Worf approaches the group reluctantly.

                            GEORDI
                     (To other officers)
               Duffy, regulate the power flow
               to the other systems.  Coster,
               you got it?  Okay, let's power
               her up and see what happens.

     There is a moment of silence, followed by the sound
     of a control systems coming back on line.  Within
     seconds, the panel is fully functional.







                        GEORDI (CONT.)
               Okay.  Everything seems to check
               out just fine.  But we'd better
               have a look at the master's
               system display just to make sure
               everything is working as it
               should.

     Geordi is about to follow the two officers when he
     notices Worf.

                        GEORDI (CONT.)
               Worf, is there something I can
               do for you?

                             WORF
               Commander.  Would it be possible
               to have a word with you?  In
               private.

                            GEORDI
                          (To Worf)
               Sure, Worf.
                        (To officers)
               Duffy, Coster.  You guys go
               ahead; I'll be with you shortly.

     Worf and Geordi move into the Chief Engineer's
     Office.

                        GEORDI (CONT.)
               So, what is the problem?

                             WORF
               Five years ago, you were at the
               celebration of my Age of
               Ascension.

                            GEORDI
               Of course.  It would be hard for
               me to forget.

                             WORF
               So you remember?

                            GEORDI
               Oh, yes.  It left quite an
               impression.

                             WORF
               Alexander is facing that choice
               now.  Whether he should perform
               the rite or not.





                            GEORDI
               You think he may not be ready
               for it...?

                             WORF
               No.  That is not what concerns
               me.  He has been preparing
               according to my instructions. 
               What does concern me is whether
               he wishes to go through with it
               at all.

                            GEORDI
               Do you believe he doesn't?

                             WORF
               I cannot help but feel that
               there is a part of him that does
               not wish to go through with it.

                            GEORDI
               He's spent a lot of time among
               humans, Worf.  That must have
               had some impact on him.  Perhaps
               he's afraid of losing that part
               of him in this rite.

                             WORF
               I know.  He must choose his own
               way.  But he is my son.  He is a
               klingon.

                            GEORDI
               He's a klingon by birth.  But
               that doesn't mean he wishes to
               respect what it means to be a
               klingon.

     Worf nods, thinking about Geordi's words.  His
     thoughts are broken by the beeping from his
     communicator.  He taps it in reply.

                             WORF
               Worf here.

                             RIKER
               Lieutenant, report to the
               Captain's Ready Room.

                             WORF
               On my way.
                         (To Geordi)
               Thank you, Commander.




                            GEORDI
               Any time.

     As Worf leaves, Geordi pauses for a moment, then
     moves to help the two officers at the System's
     Display Monitor.


19.  INT. READY ROOM.                                       
19.

     RIKER is seated behind the desk, looking exceedingly
     tested.  DATA is standing before him, seemingly
     unperturbed as only an android could be.  Both look
     to the door as it hisses open, allowing WORF to
     enter.

                             RIKER
               Data, Worf; I've got an
               assignment for the two of you. 
               You both know of our
               difficulties in contacting
               Captain Picard.  You will beam
               down and try to locate him.

     The look that passes between the two officers does
     not go unnoticed.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               I know.  That's why all
               communications with the ship
               must be scrambled.  I don't want
               the Koronosians to know what
               you're up to.

     Worf nods and is ready to leave; Data, however, is
     not so sure.

                             DATA
               Sir, you do realise we will be
               violating the agreement between
               the Federation and Alpha
               Koronos, which clearly states
               that no crewman shall....

                             RIKER
               I know, Data.  You've made your
               point, and if it's any help
               you're fired.  Now you can go.

     Data hesitates for a brief second, then follows Worf
     out.

     Riker presses a knob on the comm-panel before him.





                             RIKER
               Ensign, get me Ambassador
               Kortar.

20.  EXT. ENTERPRISE CIRCLING ALPHA KORONOS.

     The Enterprise maintains it's orbit.

21.  INT. BRIDGE.                                           
21.

     RIKER is moving towards the captain's chair as he
     listens to Data's voice, sounding rather faint and
     crackling.  He sits down, a look of deep concern on
     his face, and glances at an equally pensive TROI.

                          DATA (V.O.)
               ... no one has seen him,
               Captain.  At least not in any of
               the major villages.  Lieutenant
               Worf and I shall continue our
               search.

                             RIKER
               Thank you, Mr Data.  And keep us
               apprised.  Enterprise out.

22.  EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE.                                 
22.

     The wind is still blowing across the desolate land. 
     A small farm house comes into view.

     Two figures approach the isolated farm house through
     the blowing dust-storm.  Both wear large coats with
     hoods pulled over their heads, protecting their
     faces from the stinging sand.

     They walk up onto the front wooden porch and the
     shorter knocks on the door.  There is a long pause,
     then the door opens and a man peers out.  The larger
     being looks up, and the ridge that extends all the
     way along his head can clearly be seen.  It is WORF. 
     The other humanoid pulls the hood back from over its
     head to reveal a skin-colour matching that of the
     surrounding sand.  DATA looks at the man at the
     door.

                             DATA
               Jean-Luc Picard?

     The man, who we now see to be Jean-Luc Picard, but
     altered to look like a Koronosian, stares back at
     them, with not a hint of recognition.

                                                       FADE
OUT.

Hi,

If you missed "Memento Mori", the script I posted a few weeks ago, or any 
parts of "Heritage" that didn't make it (I know there've been problems with 
it making on the net), mail me and I'll send you the act that has been

FADE IN:

                         RIKER (V.O.)
               First Officer's Log, Stardate
               94884.7.  Captain Picard has
               been found.  However, questions
               as to what happened to him since
               his beam-down will have to wait,
               for a problem of a far more
               serious nature has arisen.

24.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
24.

     RIKER and Dr. CRUSHER are walking briskly towards
     the Transporter Room.  Crusher is carrying a medi-
     kit.

                             RIKER
               He seems to have no recollection
               of the Enterprise or any of us. 
               In fact, he seems to have no
               recollection of being Jean-Luc
               Picard at all.

                            CRUSHER
               Just who does he think he is,
               then?

                             RIKER
               Unfortunately, Data didn't have
               time to explain.  He and Worf
               had their hands full with the
               Captain and his wife.

     Crusher is about to say something, but is cut off.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Don't even ask.  Right now, I
               know as much as you do.

     They enter the Transporter Room.

25.  INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM.                                 
25.

     RIKER and CRUSHER walk directly onto the platform.

                             RIKER
               Energize.

     Riker and Crusher disappear in a shimmer of light.



26.  EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE.                                 
26.

     The storm continues to rage.  The farm house can
     barely be made out in this sand-filled wilderness.

27.  INT. FARM HOUSE.                                       
27.

     PICARD, his "wife" SERANNA, WORF and DATA are in the
     lounge-area.  The front door opens, and a rather
     wind-battered RIKER and Dr. CRUSHER enter.

     Data moves to Riker, while Crusher begins scanning
     Picard and Seranna with her tricorder.

                             DATA
                         (To Riker)
               He is quite adamant that he does
               not know who we are, Commander;
               and that he does not know of a
               Jean-Luc Picard.

                             RIKER
               Well, has he told you who he
               believes he is, then?

                             DATA
               He calls himself Saphett, and
               claims to have been a farmer,
               but was forced to give that
               profession up because of the
               drought.  He now lives on this
               farm with his wife, barely
               making ends meet.

                            CRUSHER
                         (To Seranna)
               It's not going to harm you. 
               It's only a scanning device.

     Crusher glances at Picard, who is watching her
     closely.

                        CRUSHER (CONT.)
                          (To Picard)
               Don't you remember me?

     Picard watches her as if he did not comprehend a
     word she said.

                             DATA
                          (To Riker)
               His wife's name is Seranna.  She
               appears to have a fairly strong
               personality, though he is still
               quite protective of her.


     Riker nods and is about to move towards Picard and
     Seranna.

                         DATA (CONT.)
               There's one other thing,
               Commander.  He cannot speak our
               language.

     Data holds out a universal translator for Riker, who
     looks at it and then at Data.  Finally, he takes it.

                             RIKER
               Would you mind explaining that?

                             DATA
               I cannot.  No doubt it is all
               linked to the fact that he
               looks, behaves, even thinks like
               one of them.  The only language
               he does understand is
               Koronosian.

     Riker nods and moves towards Picard and Seranna.

                             RIKER
                    (Indicating Seranna)
               Mr Worf....

     Riker seats himself opposite Picard as Worf moves
     forward to stand over Seranna.

     Riker fits the universal translator mouthpeice into
     position and indicates Seranna.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Rasse ny karre'de.

     Crusher steps forward and takes Seranna's hand,
     reassuringly.  Seranna looks at Picard, who is
     eyeing Worf and Crusher warily.

                            SERANNA
                          (To Picard)
               Tra, de su doohrt.

     Seranna gets up and is followed out by Worf.  Picard
     watches her go, then turns to look at Riker

                             RIKER
                    (Indicating translator)
               De su rekken rasse.  Trede.

     Riker moves the translator towards Picard, who
     studies it.




     Worf and Seranna walk down a corridor, out of sight
     of the others.  Worf stops at the nearest door.

                             WORF
                    (Indicating the door)
               After you.

     Seranna looks at him, unsure, then opens the door
     and steps inside.  Worf closes the door, locks it,
     and turns to rejoin the others in the lounge.

     As Worf appears, Picard is holding the device to his
     mouth with the attachment placed against his ear. 
     As he speaks, he is surprised at the strange sounds
     that pour out of the mouthpeice.

                            PICARD
               Who are you?  What are you doing
               here?

                             RIKER
               You don't recognize me?  Any of
               us?

     Picard does not answer.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               The Enterprise.  Does that name
               mean anything to you?  Do you
               remember the Enterprise?

     Again there is no response.

                            CRUSHER
                           (To Riker)
               Will, if I may have a word with
               you....

     Riker nods and gets up.  They move out of ear-range
     from Picard, who still has the universal
     translator's earpiece in place.

                        CRUSHER (CONT.)
               I think we should take him up to
               the Enterprise.  Up there I can
               take a more detailed scan of his
               brain, find out exactly what has
               happened to him.

                             RIKER
               All right.  But I don't suspect
               he'll be willing to leave
               without his "wife".




                            CRUSHER
               Take her to the Enterprise as
               well, then.  She must know
               something of what is going on
               here.

                             RIKER
               Those physical alterations.... 
               Can you do anything about them?

                            CRUSHER
               There seems to have been slight
               modifications to the skin and
               bone structure.  They should be
               easily reversible.  But once
               again, I can only do that on the
               Enterprise.

     They return to Picard.

                             RIKER
                           (To Worf)
               Mr Worf, you can let Seranna out
               now.

     Worf moves towards the room in which Seranna is
     locked.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
                           (To Picard)
               Sir, I'm afraid you will have to
               accompany us.

                            PICARD
               Where?

                             RIKER
               Back to our ship.  There we can
               take a proper look at you, find
               out exactly what has happened.

     Worf and Seranna re-enter the lounge area.  Picard
     moves to join his "wife".

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               There is no need to pack just
               yet.  We can provide you with
               all your requirements.

                            SERANNA
                          (To Picard)
               De doohrt ma ras.





                            PICARD
                          (To Riker)
               My wife will be accompanying me.

                             RIKER
               We'll supply Quarters for the
               both of you.

     Riker looks at Picard, who touches Seranna's hand
     with his own in an intimate sign of comfort and
     reassurance.

     RIKER, TROI and Dr. CRUSHER.  PICARD is lying
     unconscious on a bio-bed.  The alterations to make
     him look like a Koronosian have been reversed.

                            CRUSHER
                    (To Riker and Troi)
               There's been massive
               interference with protein
               formation by way of the RNA
               molecules.  It's caused massive
               disruptions to a variety of
               cells in his cerebral cortex.
                    (beat)
               Essentially, all access to those
               molecules that contain his
               memories have been cut off. 
               Even those that he uses to
               vocalise his thoughts.

                             RIKER
               That explains his loss of
               memory.  What about his complete
               knowledge of Koronosian customs,
               beliefs, language?

                            CRUSHER
               That's a little more tricky. 
               And I don't think I can answer
               that just yet.  I'll need to do
               a more in-depth examination
               before I can give you anything
               else.

                             RIKER
               Anything would help.  Before I
               speak to Kortar about this, I
               want to know exactly what he did
               to the Captain.





                            CRUSHER
               I did remove a miniature
               electronic chip that had been
               inserted into the Captain's
               head, in the region of his
               cerebral cortex.  I have no idea
               why it was placed there, but
               I've sent it down to Geordi to
               examine.  He may be able to give
               you a better idea of its
               function.

     Riker nods.

                             RIKER
                     (Indicating Picard)
               I'll want a word with him when
               he wakens.

                            CRUSHER
               I'll let you know when he's
               ready.

     Riker and Troi exit Sickbay.

30.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
30.

     RIKER and TROI.

                             RIKER
               Have you managed to sense
               anything from him yet?  Because
               so far, I've seen no indication
               of the captain; none of his
               memories, nothing.

                             TROI
               Saphett is, to all intents and
               purposes, another person.  It is
               possible, though, that in order
               to construct another identity,
               whoever did this to him had to
               use the essence of Jean-Luc
               Picard as a foundation on which
               to build.  If we could reach
               him, even on that level....

                             RIKER
               It would be a start.  But the
               question is: how do we reach
               him?

                             TROI
               Perhaps if we knew exactly what
               the Koronosians did to him....




                             RIKER
               I'm going to contact Ambassador
               Kortar.  Find out what the hell
               is going on.  When we agreed to
               beaming the captain down, they
               mentioned nothing about brain-
               washing.

31.  INT. WORF'S QUARTERS.                                  
31.

     WORF has just draped the coat he wore to the surface
     over his klingon chair when he sees Alexander's
     preparation for the next ritual set out in the
     adjoining room.  He moves into the room, darkened
     for the upcoming ceremony.

     Alexander is nowhere to be seen, so Worf assumes the
     kneeling position and performs the ceremony himself. 
     ALEXANDER watches from behind him.

                             WORF
               Are you aware of the purpose of
               this ceremony?

                           ALEXANDER
               It represents the freeing of the
               spirit, the coming of manhood.

                             WORF
               Yes.  It is meant to free, not
               confine you.  You must choose
               your own way, Alexander; your
               own path.

                           ALEXANDER
               I am a Klingon.

                             WORF
               No, you are not.  Not until you
               say it from here and here.

     He indicates his head, then his heart.

                         WORF (CONT.)
               Only then are you a true
               klingon.
                    (beat)
               Your mother taught you to
               respect your human side.  And
               you have lived among humans for
               a long time.

     Alexander does not reply to this; instead he looks
     away.




                         WORF (CONT.)
               But now you must make a
               decision, about what you really
               want and who you wish to be. 
               That is a decision I cannot make
               for you, but one which you must
               find alone, within yourself.

                           ALEXANDER
               Father, I do not wish to pass
               through the rite of Ascension.

     Worf stares at his son for one long moment.  Then,
     he walks away, leaving Alexander in the setting of
     an unfinished ceremony.

32.  INT. READY ROOM.                                       
32.

     RIKER is seated behind his desk, once more staring
     at the image of KORTAR.

                             RIKER
               Ambassador Kortar.  No doubt you
               are already aware of....

                            KORTAR
               I am aware of your actions,
               Commander, and those taken by
               your fellow officers.

                             RIKER
               Now that we got that out of the
               way, would you mind explaining
               to me what exactly it is that
               you have done to my Captain?

                            KORTAR
               Commander Riker, we had every
               intention of returning him to
               you in full health.  It was you
               who broke our agreement,
               snatched him from us....

                             RIKER
               That is not an explanation,
               Ambassador.  Now I'm still
               waiting.

                            KORTAR
               He was getting first-hand
               experience of our culture,
               Commander, as was agreed at our
               first meeting.




                             RIKER
               With an electronic chip jammed
               in his head?

     Kortar pauses for a moment.

                            KORTAR
               Commander, if you want your
               Captain returned in a full state
               of health, you will return him
               to us.  Along with the chip to
               which you have just referred.

                             RIKER
               We also have a Koronosian woman
               who claims to be his wife.  Care
               to explain that, Ambassador?

                            KORTAR
               You will return her as well,
               Commander.  She is a Koronosian
               citizen and you had no right....

                             RIKER
               I have every right when my
               Captain is brain-washed,
               Ambassador.  And I'm still
               waiting for an explanation.

                            KORTAR
               I will explain nothing so long
               as you hold one of our citizens
               against her will, Commander.  I
               expect her and the electronic
               chip you mentioned to be
               returned to us without delay.

     Kortar's image disappears from the screen.

     Riker thinks for a moment, then presses a button on
     the comm-panel before him.

                             RIKER
               Riker to LaForge.

                         GEORDI (V.O.)
               LaForge here, Commander.

                             RIKER
               Geordi, have you made any head-
               way with that chip Doctor
               Crusher sent you?





                         GEORDI (V.O.)
               Nothing so far, Commander.  But
               I'll let you know as soon as we
               have something.

                             RIKER
               Do that.  Riker out.

33.  INT. SICKBAY.                                          
33.

     PICARD wakens and tries to sit up.  CRUSHER notices
     him and moves to his side.

                            CRUSHER
               Just relax.  You're going to be
               fine.

     Crusher turns to reach for the universal translator
     she placed nearby.  Picard looks up, to see his
     reflection in a nearby monitor.

                            PICARD
                     (Holding his face)
               Rasse trech.  Rasse trech.

     He continues to stare at his now-changed face,
     shocked.

                                                       FADE
OUT.

                        END OF ACT TWO

        STAR TREK: "Heritage" - REV. 2/7/93 - ACT THREE

                           ACT THREE

FADE IN:

34.  EXT. ALPHA KORONOS: ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT.               
34.

                         RIKER (V.O.)
               First Officer's Log, Stardate
               94887.3.  Though Captain Picard
               has been found, it appears that
               his mind is gone, replaced with
               the knowledge, experiences and
               way of thinking of the
               Koronosian culture.

35.  INT. SICKBAY.                                          
35.

     RIKER and TROI enter Sickbay, and move towards Dr.
     CRUSHER.

                             RIKER
                         (To Crusher)
               Your report on Seranna, Doctor.

                            CRUSHER
               Follow me.

     Crusher moves to a display screen and activates it.

                        CRUSHER (CONT.)
               This is an image of Seranna's
               cerebral cortex, where all her
               short-term and long-term
               memories are stored, much like
               in the human brain.  I've found
               similiar disruption of protein
               formation, including the
               electronic device we found in
               the Captain.

                             RIKER
               Have you removed it?

                            CRUSHER
               No.  I don't want to until
               Geordi is able to determine what
               its exact function is, and how
               it may affect her.

                             TROI
               She really believes she's
               married to the Captain?  And
               that he is Saphett?




                            CRUSHER
               That's how she knows it to be,
               yes.  New, encoded protein
               molecules have been injected
               into her brain, forming new
               memories.

                             RIKER
               Is that what's happened to the
               Captain?

                            CRUSHER
               I've found traces of these
               encoded protein molecules in his
               brain.  As for being artificial,
               they are no more different than
               any other protein molecule in
               his head, at least as far as I
               can see.  Isolating them may be
               impossible, at least without
               some sophisticated peices of
               equipment which we don't have.

                             RIKER
               But the Koronosians obviously
               do.
                    (beat)
               I understand there was some
               trouble when the Captain woke
               up.

                            CRUSHER
               He reacted as anyone would if
               they woke up to find their
               facial features altered.  He's
               calmed down, though, so you
               should be able to speak to him.

                             RIKER
               Where is he now?

                            CRUSHER
               In the reception area.  There's
               no more reason for him to remain
               in Sickbay.  Right now, the only
               way he's going to get his memory
               back is through association.  He
               won't get much of that here.

                             RIKER
               That's why I've assigned him to
               his own Quarters.  Perhaps being
               there may help him remember
               something.

     Riker heads for the reception area, followed by Troi
     and Crusher.



     They find PICARD sitting in a chair, lost in
     thought.  He looks up as they enter, then picks up
     the universal translator that is lying next to him
     and fits the ear-piece into place.

                             RIKER
                         (To Picard)
               I would like to take you some-
               where... a place where you may
               have more privacy.

     Picard does not respond.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Do you understand.....?

     Picard fits the mouth-piece into place.

                            PICARD
               I understand you very well. 
               Though I cannot fathom why you
               have taken me... done this.

     Picard indicates his face.

                             RIKER
               We'll talk about that later. 
               Now, if you'll follow me....

     Picard watches Riker for a moment, then follows him
     and Troi out of the reception area.

36.  INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS.                                
36.

     The doors slide open, and PICARD, RIKER and TROI
     enter.  Picard looks around the room, at the various
     personal items that fill it.  He stares at the
     figurine given to him by his old mentor, Galen, as
     it sits on his desk, then moves to a wall where the
     sash, given to him by the proto-Vulcan people on
     Mintaka Three, hangs.

     Riker and Troi remain silent, watching for anything
     that would show a hint of remembrance.  No such
     reaction is forth-coming.

                            PICARD
                         (To Riker)
               Where is my wife staying?  And
               why won't we be sharing rooms?

                             RIKER
               Counsellor Troi will show you to
               your wife.  Her Quarters are not
               far from here.


                            PICARD
               Why won't we be sharing rooms?

                             RIKER
               Make yourself comfortable.  If
               there is anything I or
               Counsellor Troi can do for you,
               don't hesitate to call.

     There is an uncomfortable moment as Picard stares at
     Riker.  He then removes the ear-piece of the
     universal translator from his ear.

     Riker and Troi glance at one another, then exit.

37.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
37.

     RIKER and TROI walk down the ship's corridor.

                             RIKER
               Deanna, I'd appreciate it if you
               could work with him... show him
               around the ship....

                             TROI
               Of course.  However, there is
               someone else aboard who I
               believe is better suited to that
               job than I am.  Data has all the
               files on Koronosian culture
               downloaded into his system....

                             RIKER
               Counsellor, Captain Picard is
               still human....  No matter what
               he may be thinking or how he
               talks....

                             TROI
               No.  He's Koronosian....  No
               matter how he looks.  He speaks
               their language, performs their
               customs....  In every respect
               that matters, he is Koronosian.

                             RIKER
               And Data is better prepared to
               handle a Koronosian?









                             TROI
               He knows their beliefs, their
               language, I don't.  Saphett can
               relate to Data more than he can
               with me, and that ability to
               relate is important in any
               therapy.

     Riker's communicator beeps and he taps it.

                             RIKER
               Riker here.

                         GEORDI (V.O.)
               LaForge here.  I think Data and
               I have found something that may
               be of interest to you,
               Commander.  If you'll join us on
               the Bridge....

                             RIKER
               I'm on my way.

38.  INT. BRIDGE.                                           
38.

     RIKER and TROI exit from the aft turbo-lift.  Troi
     moves to her seat at the centre of the Bridge, while
     Riker moves up to GEORDI and DATA, who are working
     at one of the aft stations.

                             RIKER
               So, what have you got, Geordi?

                            GEORDI
               Data and I have been studying
               this chip for some time now,
               Commander, and all we've managed
               to come up with is that it is a
               receiver and transmitter of
               sorts.

     Data finishes keying in certain commands on the
     panel before him, then looks at the read-out on the
     monitor.

                             DATA
               As I suspected, it is a
               transmitter that sends out
               focussed energy pulses at
               specific frequencies.

                             RIKER
               Aimed at what?





                             DATA
               At those frequencies, any
               protein blocks at which the
               energy pulses are focussed would
               shatter, leaving those molecules
               encoded with memories
               isolated....

                             RIKER
               ....and the information they
               contain inaccessible.

                            GEORDI
               Exactly.  The chip then encodes
               new, artificial instructions
               into molecules that it forms and
               injects them into the brain.

                             DATA
               Such technology would make for
               an ideal situation in most
               societies.

                             RIKER
               Ideal?  How?

                             DATA
               I learnt the Koronosian language
               after I was fed all the
               information regarding grammar,
               vocabulary, pronunciation....

                             RIKER
               Fine, Data.  Go on.

                             DATA
               In effect, the same can be done
               to any Koronosian who has such a
               chip implanted in his or her
               head.

                             RIKER
               Not only language.

                             DATA
               Agreed.  The theory and
               practical application of any
               occupation could be programmed
               into the minds of people.  The
               need for schooling would be
               abolished, as anything could be
               learnt instantaneously....






                             RIKER
               And who controls that knowledge;
               controls what is to be
               tranmitted into people's minds? 
               What a perfect way to make sure
               that people maintain a
               particular way of life....  All
               from this one chip.

                            GEORDI
               Actually, this thing is more
               like a relay station, passing on
               the instructions it receives.
                    (beat)
               There's one other thing,
               Commander.  We've also found a
               set of instructions encoded into
               the chip.

                             RIKER
               Obviously intended for the
               Captain.  Have you managed to
               decode it?

                            GEORDI
               Not yet, but I'm getting there.

                             RIKER
               Keep trying, Geordi.  And make a
               copy of those instructins to be
               stored in the Enterprise's
               computer.  We may have to give
               this chip back, but that doesn't
               mean we can't keep the
               information stored within it.

                            GEORDI
               Aye, sir.

                             RIKER
                           (To Data)
               Mr Data, I've got a special
               assignment for you.....

39.  INT. NURSERY.                                          
39.

     The Instructor, KYLE, is teaching a young class of
     students, which includes ALEXANDER.

                             KYLE
               ...and it was at what outpost
               that a Federation starship
               defended the Klingons against
               the Romulans, paving the way for
               the peace that we now enjoy?


     No one answers, and Kyle waits for a moment, giving
     someone a chance to voice a suggestion.  A young
     girl puts her hand up.

                         KYLE (CONT.)
               Yes, Gloria?

                            GLORIA
               Norendra Three.

                             KYLE
               That's right.  It was at
               Norendra Three that the
               Enterprise-C, the immediate
               predecessor to this ship,
               battled four Romulan warbirds,
               and lost.  But it was because of
               their heroic efforts that a war
               that had raged for decades was
               finally over.

     A small boy sitting across the aisle from Alexander
     turns to the Klingon when Kyle's back is turned.

                              BOY
                        (To Alexander)
               We conquered you.

     Alexander jumps out of his seat, hitting the other
     boy and pulling him from his seat.

                             KYLE
               Alexander!  Let him go!

     Kyle rushes to the two boys who are scuffling,
     pulling them apart.

                              BOY
               You're not one of us!  You're
               not one of us!  You're a nobody!

                             KYLE
               Alexander, stop it!

     Alexander pelts the boy again.

40.  INT. READY ROOM.                                       
40.

     RIKER is seated behind the Ready Room desk.  He
     punches a Knob on the comm-panel before him.  A
     Koronosian appears on the screen.

                          KORONOSIAN
               Sjet bakla ahr'en?




                             RIKER
               I need to speak to Ambassador
               Kortar.

                          KORONOSIAN
                      (More forcefully)
               Sjet bakla ahr'en?

                             RIKER
               Never mind.

     Riker punches another button, closing the one
     channel and opening another.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Transporter Room, prepare to
               beam two down to the planet's
               surface....  Same co-ordinates
               as those used for Captain
               Picard.

     Riker gets up and exits the Ready Room.

41.  INT. BRIDGE.                                           
41.

     RIKER enters from the Ready Room and moves towards
     the aft turbo-lift.  GEORDI is working at one of the
     aft stations.

                             RIKER
                         (To Geordi)
               Mr LaForge, do you have that
               electronic chip with you?

                            GEORDI
               Right here, Commander.

                             RIKER
               Then let's go.

     Riker and Geordi enter the turbo-lift and the doors
     close behind them.

42.  EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE.                                 
42.

     It is approaching dusk in the great city.  The
     lights from the many buildings can be seen through
     the darkness and the blowing sand.  The howl of the
     wind is clearly audible.

43.  INT. KORTAR'S ABODE.                                   
43.

     KORTAR is pouring himself a drink, a thick, orange
     brew, at a counter.  The door to his abode opens,
     and RIKER and GEORDI are led in by two KORONOSIANS.



                            KORTAR
                       (To Koronosian)
               Tere shiern ahr'ait?

                          KORONOSIAN
                (Indicating Riker and Geordi)
               Serla rasse g'aght.  Rhie'at
               Koragher.

     Kortar nods, then dismisses the Koronosians with a
     wave.

                            KORTAR
               Doohrt.

     The two Koronosians exit.  Kortar picks up a
     universal translator and moves it into position
     around his mouth and ear.

                        KORTAR (CONT.)
               You have a lot of explaining to
               do, Commander.
                    (Returns to counter)
               But let me first get you and
               your officer a drink.

                             RIKER
               I won't have anything, thank
               you.

     Kortar continues to fill two beakers with the thick,
     orange brew.

                            KORTAR
               You are on our world now,
               Commander.  And you shall have a
               drink.

     He offers a beaker to Riker and Geordi.  Each take
     it, but do not drink.  They move to the table where
     Kortar has seated himself, sipping his orange drink.

                        KORTAR (CONT.)
               Good, is it not?  We call it
               Rhe'gla....  It's quite lethal
               in large doses.

     Riker throws the electronic chip so that it skitters
     across the table, to smack against Kortar's beaker
     and come to a stand-still before the Ambassador's
     face.

                        KORTAR (CONT.)
               Why, thank you, Commander.





                             RIKER
               You don't get it for nothing,
               Ambassador.  I still would like
               an explanation of what it was
               doing in my Captain's head.

                            KORTAR
               I would have thought your
               computers would have analysed it
               already, Commander.... told you
               everything you needed to know.

                             RIKER
               Not everything.

                            GEORDI
               We know it's a transmitter and
               receiver of sorts....  And that
               it isolates certain brain cells
               while injecting new ones, with
               new encodings, into the brain.

                            KORTAR
               Simply put.

                             RIKER
               Now, would you mind explaining?

                            KORTAR
               We followed our agreement to the
               letter, Commander.  Every
               Koronosian has such an implant
               and it seemed the best way to
               integrate your Captain into our
               society.

                             RIKER
               Integrate?

                            KORTAR
               He learnt everything about us,
               all our values, beliefs,
               customs, in an instant,
               Commander.  Now he understands
               us... our ways.

                             RIKER
               Understands you?  He's one of
               you.

                            KORTAR
               We will restore him... once you
               return the other Koronosian to
               us.




                             RIKER
               She thinks she's been married to
               him for twenty-five years.

                            KORTAR
               And she will forget him in an
               instant, once I've relayed the
               instructions to her chip.

                             RIKER
               You implant memories into their
               heads and then remove them as
               you wish?

                            KORTAR
               Not as we wish, Commander.  We
               needed someone to guide your
               Captain through the process...
               be with him so that he can
               understand our ways.  She
               volunteered.

                             RIKER
               To have false memories implanted
               into her head?  They all know
               about this?

                            KORTAR
               Of course, Commander.  We don't
               normally use the tool to alter
               memories, but these are...
               unusual circumstances.  Normally
               it's used as an educational
               tool.
                    (beat)
               Would you like a
               demonstration..?

                                                       FADE
OUT.

I'm posting the last two acts of Heritage below.

All the best,

        STAR TREK: "Heritage" - REV. 4/7/93 - ACT FOUR

                           ACT FOUR

FADE IN:

44.  ALPHA KORONOS: ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT.                    
44.

45.  INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS.                                
45.

     PICARD removes his Kataanian flute from its case and
     studies it.  For a long moment, he stares at it. 
     Behind him, SERANNA steps into view, watching him. 
     After a slight pause, she speaks.

                            SERANNA
               Sei rasse te koorn?

     Picard turns to look at her, and is about to answer
     when the door chimes.  He reaches for the universal
     translator, fitting it into place.

                            PICARD
               You may enter.

     The door opens, and DATA steps inside.

                             DATA
                         (To Seranna)
               Grash-kalla, Seranna.

     Picard gets up and moves to join his wife.  Data
     notices the universal translator in place.

                         DATA (CONT.)
                         (To Picard)
               Saphett, I have come to offer
               you and your wife a tour of the
               ship.  If you are not busy or
               have other engagements....

                            PICARD
               I'm not.
                    (beat)
               I will join you in a moment.

     Picard exits, entering the adjoining room.  There is
     a moment of silence before Seranna turns to Data.

                            SERANNA
               Tje rasse nye karre te g'ler.

     Data looks slightly taken aback, for an android.





                             DATA
               Seranna, tje rasse te rus'gla. 
               De rekke su tra.

                            SERANNA
               Ku ma trech dog hir?  Tje se
               balsshmet!

     Data looks deeply offended and is about to reply,
     but is broken off by Picard, who has just entered
     the room.

                            PICARD
               Tchu, Seranna!

     Picard returns the mouthpeice of the translator to
     its previous position.

                        PICARD (CONT.)
               Sir, I apologize for my wife's
               behaviour.

     Not understanding what Picard has said, Seranna
     turns to Data.

                            SERANNA
                     (Indicating Picard)
               Dog rasse koorn?

                             DATA
                        (To Seranna)
               Tje rus'gla ma rasse ge'tan.

                            SERANNA
                         (To Picard)
               Tje rus'gla te rasse ge'tan?
                         (To Data)
               Rasse te rekke se'doohrt.

                             DATA
                         (To Picard)
               If you wish me to leave....

                            PICARD
               Yes, and I will accompany you.

     Picard and Data move towards the door.

                            SERANNA
                         (To Picard)
               Tje nye karre se koorn.

     Data does not answer, but Picard does.  He removes
     the translator momentarily.



                            PICARD
                         (To Seranna)
               Rasse ern duug sa.

     He returns the translator to his mouth.

                        PICARD (CONT.)
                         (To Data)
               I go because I wish it.

     Picard and Data exit the Quarters, leaving Seranna
     alone.  Once they are gone, she seats herself beside
     Picard's desk and in her anger and frustration,
     throws the flute's casing across the room, to hit
     the far wall.

46.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
46.

     PICARD and DATA walk down a corridor.

                             DATA
               Your wife seemed rather upset
               that you accepted my invitation. 
               Also, the terms she used to
               describe me would not be
               considered polite in Koronosian
               culture.

                            PICARD
               And she has a right to feel the
               way she does.  You take us from
               our homes... try and make me
               think I'm one of you... alter my
               features.  I have every right to
               be angry too.

                             DATA
               If you feel that way, Saphett,
               then why did you agree to this
               tour?

                            PICARD
               I know why you're doing this to
               me... trying to make me think
               I'm one of you.

     He waits for a reaction from Data, but gets none.

                        PICARD (CONT.)
               You want something, don't you? 
               A part of our culture....






                             DATA
               If you are referring to the
               electronic chip that we found in
               your head, sir, you are
               mistaken.

                            PICARD
               Am I?  I'm sure you know of the
               advantages it gives us, the
               ability to learn, to grow.  It
               made me who I am.

                             DATA
               In what way?

                            PICARD
               I wanted to be a farmer.  I
               always did.  In the course of a
               year, all the necessary skills
               and knowledge I needed was fed
               into my brain.  It wasn't a
               matter of learning, it was just
               a matter of knowing.

                             DATA
               And Seranna?  Who was she?

                            PICARD
               Who she is now.  People don't
               change, only our ability to
               understand.

47.  INT. KORTAR'S ABODE.                                   
47.

     RIKER, GEORDI and KORTAR are watching through a
     large window into an adjoining room, where a young
     girl is sitting at a terminal on which a large
     cross-sectional map of Alpha Koronos' various rock
     strata is shown.  An adult Koronosian is at another
     nearby terminal, monitoring the girl.

                            KORTAR
                    (To Geordi and Riker)
               The child's name is T'churian;
               she wants to become a geo-
               physicist.  She lacks the
               various skills required for the
               occupation, but that will all
               change.

                            GEORDI
               You're going to encode it in all
               at once?





                            KORTAR
               Not all at once, no.  We start
               from the basics and build on
               from there.  It's a slow
               process, allowing the recipient
               to process and understand what
               he is receiving.  That is how we
               work, especially when dealing
               with children.  As they grow up
               and become more familiar with
               the process, we can move a lot
               faster.

                             RIKER
               You spent a great deal of time
               with Captain Picard...

                            KORTAR
               The time spent included
               inserting the chip, Commander. 
               Even then, we did move rather
               quickly.

     In the adjoining room, the child suddenly
     manipulates the controls and a new set of figures
     appears on the terminal monitor.  The view of the
     various strata alters, becoming more detailed.

                        KORTAR (CONT.)
               T'churian has accomplished the
               next phase in her learning.

                             RIKER
               But it can be taken away just as
               easily.

                            KORTAR
               We don't remove anything,
               Commander.  Every input is
               specifically tailored to the
               individual's needs.  Once
               programmed into their minds,
               there is no reason to remove it.

                             RIKER
               And Captain Picard?

                            KORTAR
               To integrate your Captain into
               our culture it was necessary to
               isolate certain memories
               temporarily.  To remember his
               life on the Enterprise while he
               acted out a role as a Koronosian
               would have caused too many
               contradictory attitudes.


     They move away from the window.

                            GEORDI
               Ambassador, when that child's
               chip received instructions for
               further encoding, my VISOR
               picked up no indications of any
               signals being sent.

                            KORTAR
               It wouldn't, Mr LaForge.  The
               signals are sent by way of
               neutrinos.  And as you no doubt
               know, neutrinos aren't easy to
               detect.

                            GEORDI
               Neutrinos?  But how....?

                            KORTAR
               It's a long, involved process. 
               Essentially, the neutrinos are
               fired out at a specific rate and
               interact with the chip and the
               multitude of various organic
               compounds that it contains....

                            GEORDI
               ...Which produce the required
               encodings.

                            KORTAR
               Instructions are encoded into
               organic molecules being
               manufactured in the chip and are
               then injected into the brain. 
               But that, of course, is putting
               it simply.

                             RIKER
               I would be interested in hearing
               more about this process... once
               you've returned our Captain to
               us, of course.

     Kortar hesitates.

                            KORTAR
               Commander, I will gladly return
               your Captain to you, if you
               transport him to the surface.
                    (beat)
               However, I am sorry to say that
               Alpha Koronos has decided to
               remain out of the Federation.


                             RIKER
               This is rather sudden.

                            KORTAR
               I apologise if I raised your
               hopes by agreeing to our meeting
               in the first place, Commander. 
               But we do believe that it would
               be in Alpha Koronos' best
               interests if we progressed
               alone, in our own way.

     PICARD and DATA enter Engineering from an adjoining
     corridor.

                            PICARD
               This is a big ship.

                             DATA
               As I said before, it is the only
               Galaxy-class starship in
               existance, and the Flagship of
               the Federation.

                            PICARD
               And very impressive.

     A CREWMAN looks up from the Master Systems Display.

                            CREWMAN
               Commander Data.  Sir, Mr LaForge
               is planet-side, and I was
               wondering if you would look
               something over.

                             DATA
                         (To Picard)
               Excuse me one moment.

     Picard nods and Data moves to join the crewman at
     his station.

                            CREWMAN
               Sir, Mr LaForge, Duffy and
               Coster repaired this faulty
               panel a short while ago, but it
               seems to be down again.

                             DATA
               This is the terminal that
               accesses current information
               from the power transfer conduit.
                                                  (CONTINUED)


                         DATA (CONT.)
               It is possible that there is a
               fault in an inter-linking
               system.

     Picard watches them discuss the problem for a
     moment, then looks up at the large, throbbing
     matter/anti-matter reactor.  He looks at it
     momentarily, slightly puzzled.

                            PICARD
               Generator coils....

     Data looks up from where he is working, and at
     Picard who is still staring at the reactor.

                             DATA
               I beg your pardon?

                            PICARD
               Your ship, it employs generator
               coils.  In the nacelles.

                             DATA
               That is correct.  How do you
               know this?

     Picard is silent for a moment, trying to grasp at
     something intangible.

                            PICARD
               I know this system....

                             DATA
               What else do you know?

                            PICARD
               Nothing.  It must have been fed
               into me.  But why would they be
               sending me technical knowledge? 
               I'm a farmer.

                             DATA
               Saphett, this knowledge has not
               been sent to you via the
               electronic chip.

     Picard remains silent, waiting for an explanation.

                         DATA (CONT.)
               We removed that implant shortly
               after bringing you to the
               Enterprise.  They could not have
               provided you with this
               knowledge.




                            PICARD
               You what?

                             DATA
               We removed...

                            PICARD
               You're lying.  How else could I
               know this?  I've never been on
               this ship before.  How could I
               know what I know now?

                             DATA
               I do not know.  Unless there
               were some memories the
               Koronosians did not want to
               render irretrievable.

49.

     KYLE is seated behind her desk, staring at WORF, who
     is seated before her.

                             KYLE
               Mr Worf, when your son came here
               he was having tremendous
               difficulties fitting in.  He
               overcame those difficulties, and
               things seemed to be getting
               better.  Until now.

     Worf shuffles uneasily in his chair.

                         KYLE (CONT.)
               This morning I had to break up a
               fight between your son and
               another of my students.  Neither
               would say what caused it, but I
               do know that it was your son who
               threw the first punch.

                             WORF
               I see.

                             KYLE
               "I see" is not good enough, Mr
               Worf.  I respect Alexander's
               right to take pride in being a
               Klingon, but not when he beats
               up one of my students.

                             WORF
               Attacking the weak is not the
               Klingon way.




                             KYLE
               I'm certain it's not.  Mr Worf,
               I would like you to have a word
               with your son.  Tell him that I
               respect him as an individual and
               I respect his beliefs, but I
               don't respect his recent
               behaviour in my class.  And if
               it happens again, I will be
               forced to take more drastic
               measures.

                             WORF
               With all due respect, Ms. Kyle,
               how can you respect that which
               you know little or nothing
               about?

     Kyle is silent for a moment.

                             KYLE
               Lieutenant, I'm a very flexible
               person.  I accept a wide range
               of view-points.  But I do not
               accept hooliganism, no matter
               from where it comes.

     Kyle gets up and moves to the door.

                         KYLE (CONT.)
               I will leave you now.  I'm sure
               you and your son have much to
               discuss.

     Kyle opens the door to the adjoining Nursery, where
     Alexander has been waiting, then exits.  Worf gets
     up as his son enters the room.

                             WORF
               Well?  Have you nothing to say?

     Alexander is silent.

                         WORF (CONT.)
               Do you admit to hitting one of
               your fellow-students.

                           ALEXANDER
               I am a Klingon....

                             WORF
               You are not a Klingon.  Nor do
               you become one through bullying
               others.  You become one by
               accepting certain challenges, by
               following the traditions....



                           ALEXANDER
               I do not wish to pass through
               the rite of Ascension.

                             WORF
               This is your heritage.  This is
               who you are.  You cannot hide
               from that.  You must accept it
               and take pride in it.
                    (beat)
               Perhaps I was expecting too
               much.  Perhaps I should have
               sent you to a Klingon school
               where they would have taught you
               what it means to be a Klingon.

                           ALEXANDER
               I don't want to be different!

                             WORF
               If you cannot accept your own
               differences, how can you expect
               others to accept them?

               Specify.






                           COMPUTER
               The form of the encodings
               correspond to the formation of
               distinctive patterns of
               rubonucleic acids.

                             DATA

                           COMPUTER
               The patterns are indicative of
               the development of RNA molecules
               located in the cerebral cortex. 
               These are formed according to
               the pattern of DNA molecules in

     RIKER is sitting behind his desk, reading through
     some incoming messages on his desk monitor, when the

                             RIKER
               Come.

     He looks up as DATA enters.

                             DATA
               Commander, I seem to have
               successfully decoded the
               instructions located in the
               Koronosian Chip.

                             RIKER
               How did you do that?

               Carry on.

                             DATA
               Certain parts of the encodings
               were clearly instructions to the
               implant to isolate certain
               memories; it is the other parts
               that may be of more interest.

                              RIKER
               What were those instructions?

               The other encodings in the chip
               match certain RNA molecules in
               the Captain's brain.  I did a
               complete diagnostical scan of
               the Captain's brain, and though
               it took a great deal of time, I
               have managed to isolate those
               specific molecules....

                             RIKER
               Data, I don't need an
               explanation, I need results. 
               What did you come up with?

                             DATA
               Sir, I believe the instructions
               I have decoded in the chip are
               meant to direct the chip to make
               copies of the encodings in the
               specified molecules in the
               Captain's brain and to send the
               copies back to the transmitter.

                             RIKER
               They made copies of some of
               Captain Picard's memories?

                             DATA
               I believe so, Commander?

                             RIKER
               What memories?  And for what
               purpose?

                             DATA
               The memories that include all of
               his knowledge of our ship's
               propulsion.  No doubt they wish
               to learn how to build their own
               starships.

                                                       FADE
OUT.

                        END OF ACT FOUR

         STAR TREK "Heritage" - REV. 6/7/93 - ACT FIVE

                           ACT FIVE

FADE IN:

52.  EXT. ALPHA KORONOS: ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT.               
52.

                         RIKER (V.O.)
               First Officer's Log, Stardate
               94889.2.  Doctor Crusher has
               informed me that there is the
               possibility of retrieving
               Captain Picard's lost memories. 
               It is vital that we do, if we
               are to discover the true reason
               for the Koronosians' actions,
               their purpose behind what they
               have done.

53.  INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE.                               
53.

     RIKER is alone.  He turns towards the door as it
     opens, allowing PICARD and WORF to enter.  Picard is
     still wearing a universal translator.

                             RIKER
                         (To Picard)
               Saphett.  Please come in and
               take a seat.

     Picard seats himself opposite Riker.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Commander Data has told me of
               your sudden knowledge of our
               propulsion systems.

     Picard does not reply.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Our doctor has suggested that
               you continued to know it all
               along...  You've just been
               suppressing it.  To remember
               that and nothing else on the
               ship may have been a
               contradiction your brain did not
               wish to deal with.  It was
               pushed into your unconscious
               until brought out during your
               tour.

                            PICARD
               Do you honestly expect me to
               believe that?




                             RIKER
               What do you think?

                            PICARD
               Take a good look at me,
               Commander.  I look human.  But
               that is thanks to you.  I am a
               Koronosian.  I was born, lived,
               and married on that planet.  I
               had a child, watched it grow and
               die there.  And I remember
               nothing of this ship, the living
               area in which you confined me,
               or even you.  None of it, except
               for certain technical details,
               which you could have easily fed
               into my brain.

                             RIKER
               Right now, you know nothing of
               us, Saphett....  Of our ways, of
               who we are.  I'm giving you the
               chance to change all that.  I'm
               giving you a chance to
               experience what you've lost. 
               And if you're anything like my
               Captain, I think you'll take me
               up on my offer.
                    (beat)
               Allow us to restore your
               memories... the ones that were
               taken away from you.

                            PICARD
               There are no such memories.

                             RIKER
               Then there is no reason why you
               should not accept my offer.

                            PICARD
               What is to be gained?  I have
               this life.  I don't want
               another.  This is who I am.

                             RIKER
               What do you have to lose?  Let
               me show you your other side, and
               you don't have to lose a thing.

54.  INT. SICKBAY.                                          
54.

     PICARD is lying on the central bio-bed.  Though the
     mouth-peice of the universal translator is removed,
     the ear-peice is still in place.



     Dr. CRUSHER is hooking him up to a machine while
     RIKER stands by, watching.

                            CRUSHER
                           (To Riker)
               By stimulating certain areas of
               his brain, specifically his
               interpretative cortex, we'll
               excite those molecules that have
               been isolated, allowing them to
               form new protein connections.
                           (To Picard)
               You may as a result relive the
               memories with which those
               molecules are encoded, but you
               will still remain conscious of
               the present.

     Crusher waits for a response, but doesn't get one.

                        CRUSHER (CONT.)
               Do you understand?

     Picard nods, but continues to fix his eyes on the
     ceiling above him.

                        CRUSHER (CONT.)
               Okay.

     The machine is activated, sending an electric
     current directly into Picard's brain, to his
     interpretative cortex.

     A slight electronic hum is heard from the machine,
     and Picard moans.  Images of forgotten memories
     flash before his eyes, all while he still remains
     conscious of the present, as if one image were
     super-imposed onto another.  All that he was is
     returned, his heritage reaffirmed.

     Crusher deactivates the machine and Riker moves to
     Picard's side.

                             RIKER
               Captain?

                            PICARD
               Will....

55.  EXT. ALPHA KORONOS: ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT.               
55.







56.  INT. READY ROOM.                                       
56.

     RIKER watches as GEORDI and DATA enter.

                             RIKER
               Geordi, Data.  Good.  You both
               have been working on the
               Koronosian implant and on the
               method of transmission.  What I
               want to know is: Can we
               infiltrate the system, send our
               own instructions?

     Data and Geordi glance at one another, then back at
     Riker.

                            GEORDI
               Not without knowing the exact
               frequencies being used.  And
               Ambassador Kortar did tell us on
               the planet that special codes
               are required for access if you
               want to plant something in a
               particular individual.

                             RIKER
               Don't worry about the codes. 
               What I want to know is can you
               do it?

                             DATA
               It is possible.  I have a basic
               knowledge of the principles used
               for encoding and decoding.

                            GEORDI
               The demonstration on the planet
               gave me a basic idea of how the
               procedure works.  It shouldn't
               be too difficult to send out a
               neutrino pulse.

                             RIKER
               Get to work on it.

     Data and Geordi exit, leaving Riker to muse.

57.  EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE.                                 
57.

     Dawn is breaking as the sun rises over the city. 
     The wind has quitened and the sand-storm of the
     previous day has ceased.





58.  INT. KORTAR'S ABODE.                                   
58.

     Two beams of light appear before a startled KORTAR. 
     They are replaced by RIKER and WORF.

                            KORTAR
               De'sag se vich!

                             RIKER
               Ztuch!

     Kortar fumbles for a translator and finally fits it
     into place.

                            KORTAR
               Explain what, Commander?  Why
               you have broken in here without
               authorization.  That is what you
               need to explain.

                             RIKER
                       (Indicating door)
               Mr Worf....

     Worf moves to cover the door, phaser in hand.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               You did this for a purpose.  You
               were the one who pushed for our
               Captain to undergo this
               "experience", you were the one
               who brainwashed him.

     Kortar does not answer.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               You were after his knowledge of
               the ship's propulsion, weren't
               you?  You want to create your
               own starships.

                            KORTAR
               Do you expect me to believe all
               this, Commander?

                             RIKER
               All that about wanting him to
               gain first-hand knowledge of
               your culture was a cover, to get
               hold of his memories and
               knowledge.  And here we were
               thinking you were only
               interested in preserving your
               culture.




                            KORTAR
               I am.  That's why we have no
               interest in joining the
               Federation.

                             RIKER
               But you still want your own
               ships....

                            KORTAR
               Of course.  But on our own, in
               our own way.

                             RIKER
               Where is that knowledge being
               stored?

     Kortar is silent, but only for a moment.

                            KORTAR
               The creation of our first ship
               is already under way, Commander;
               in the minds of those who have
               received the knowledge.  They're
               already being invented.

     Riker takes out his phaser.

                             RIKER
               The frequencies; I want the
               frequencies at which those chips
               receive transmissions.  And
               whatever codes that are
               necessary for access.

                            KORTAR
               I cannot tell you that.

     Riker turns, aims his phaser at a sculpture and
     fires.  A beam of energy lances out of the phaser,
     engulfing the sculpture.  In seconds, there is only
     ash.

                             RIKER
               That is the first chunk of your
               culture gone.  And it's not the
               last, unless I have those
               frequencies.

                            KORTAR
               Are you aware of what you have
               just destroyed!?!

                             RIKER
               Yes.  And I've only just begun.



     He aims his phaser at a large mural and fires.  As
     with the sculpture, the mural is also destroyed.

                            KORTAR
               Stop this!

                             RIKER
               I want those frequencies!
                    (Indicating a vase)
               Mr Worf...

     Worf aims his phaser.

                            KORTAR
               You'll have them!

     Worf lowers his phaser.

                             RIKER
               Now.

     The doors to Kortar's abode open and two Koronosian
     guards enter.  Worf fire a low-setting shot, barely
     missing them.  They stop just inside the abode.

                             WORF
                         (To Riker)
               A universal language.

     Kortar moves to his desk.

                            KORTAR
               I'll have them sent to your
               ship.

                             RIKER
                    (Into communicator)
               Data, Geordi; stand by to
               receive frequencies and
               necessary codes.

     Kortar works at the comm-panel at his desk, then
     looks to Riker.

                         GEORDI (V.O.)
               Frequencies and codes received,
               Commander.


59.  INT. BRIDGE.                                           
59.

     GEORDI and DATA are at an aft-station.

                         RIKER (V.O.)
               Proceed, then.  Riker out.

     Data begins to key in commands to the computer.


                             DATA
               By copying certain parts of the
               encodings in the Captain's
               implant, we have the necessary
               instructions to erase certain
               memories.  All we have to do is
               redirect those instructions to
               other molecules in the brains of
               those to whom this transmission
               is being sent.

60.  EXT. ALPHA KORONOS: ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT.               
60.

                         PICARD (V.O.)
               Captain's Log, Stardate 94889.7. 
               As requested by the Koronosian
               government, the Enterprise will
               be leaving Alpha Koronos without
               completing the talks.  However,
               one last duty remains to be
               done, and one I have not been
               looking forward to.

61.  INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM.                                 
61.

     PICARD and TROI are in the Transporter Room.  The
     door opens and SERANNA, accompanied by WORF, stand
     in the corridor outside.  She is wearing a universal
     translator.

                             WORF
                    (Indicating the room)
               This way.

     Seranna enters, followed by Worf.




                            SERANNA
                         (To Picard)
               Who are you?  Do I still know
               you?

                            PICARD
               I am your husband of twenty five
               years.  And I will always be
               that to you.

                            SERANNA
               You've changed.

                            PICARD
               This is who I am.  This is where
               I belong.  I've made my choice.

                            SERANNA
               Do you still remember me?

                            PICARD
               Everything, Seranna.  I remember
               everything.

     Seranna removes the universal translator mouth-
     peice, moving her hand to Picard's, forming the
     intimate sign of comfort and reassurance.

                            SERANNA
               Tra, se toresh Saphett.

                            PICARD
               Sa rekke trech ta'dra.  Rus'gla,
               Seranna.  Rus'gla.

     Seranna moves away from him and onto the transporter
     pad.  She takes one last look at her husband before
     a scattering of particles builds up around her,
     taking him from her sight.

62.  INT. WORF'S QUARTERS.                                  
62.

     WORF enters his Quarters, the remains of the
     ceremony he had begun earlier still clearly evident. 
     He walks through the main room to the adjoining
     chamber.

     There he finds Alexander studying the Bat'telh. 
     Alexander does not notice him at first, but when he
     does, he remains where he is, holding the weapon.

     Worf looks at his son momentarily, then moves toward
     him.





                             WORF
               Alexander, I know of your fears. 
               I know of your difficulties. 
               But they cannot be overcome by
               running away from them.  Nor can
               they be overcome by abandoning
               what you are.

     Alexander does not turn to look at him.

                         WORF (CONT.)
               Your mother taught you to
               respect your human side.  And
               you have lived among humans for
               a long time.  I do not ask you
               to forget her teachings or what
               you have learnt from those
               around you.

                           ALEXANDER
               I don't want to lose....

                             WORF
               You will lose nothing.  By
               following the one, you are not
               forsaking the other.  You are
               only giving new meaning to that
               which you already know.  A new
               outlook.  There is nothing to
               lose in that.

     Alexander turns to him, still admiring the bat'telh. 
     He looks up to his father, ready to meet the
     challenge that has been put to him.

63.  ENTERPRISE.                                            
63.

     The Enterprise breaks orbit, moving away, towards
     the stars at sub-light speed.


                                                       FADE
OUT.

                            THE END
