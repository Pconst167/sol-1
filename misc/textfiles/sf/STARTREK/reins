This is a script I submitted to Paramount last year.  For reasons which'll
be obvious soon, they couldn't use it or even adapt the basic story.  People
have been asking what scripts look like; I thought I'd post this as an
example.  I followed the same format as a couple of TNG scripts I bought at
a convention.

One caveat: There is too much stage direction in the script.  That means I
describe how the characters move around the room as they talk, etc.  That
sort of thing should really be left up to the director.

I've included the cast list, set list, and such at the beginning so people
can see what those look like as well.  I'll post part 2 shortly, along with
some more comments about some things that are wrong with the script as it
stands now.

My thanks to the people who read and commented on this while I was writing
it, by the way.  You were absolutely indispensible.

If you don't see "STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION" at the top of the title
page, your newsreader doesn't understand underlining, and you'll need to
remove all instances of "_^H" (that's underline backspace) from the file
to view it.

         FADE IN:


         INT.  POKER ROOM

         DATA, GEORDI, TROI, RIKER, WORF, and O'BRIEN are playing poker.
         Data has his usual visor on.  Riker, O'Brien and Worf hardly have
         any chips left.

         Data lays down a full house.

                                    DATA
                        (doing an impression)
                   Read 'em and weep, suckers.

         The others groan.  Data rakes in the chips.

                                  O'BRIEN
                        (grumbling, but in jest)
                   Are you people sure you're not
                   cheating?

         The others look at him like he's nuts.

                                  O'BRIEN
                        (jokingly)
                   Well, half the people at this table
                   could do it if they wanted to.  I
                   mean, Data's eyes are fast enough to
                   keep track of all the cards...

         Data isn't offended by this -- he's more confused than anything
         else.  Riker decides to join in.

                                   RIKER
                        (grinning)
                   And Counselor -- no poker face is
                   straight enough for you.

         Troi makes a face at Riker -- she knows he's kidding.

                                    WORF
                        (maybe joking; who can
                        tell?)
                   Geordi can see through the cards.

                                   GEORDI
                   You're just jealous 'cause lady luck's
                   visiting our side of the table for
                                   (MORE)







         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - TEASER        2.


                                  GEORDI (Cont'd)
                   once.

                                   RIKER
                        (to O'Brien)
                   Visiting?

                                  O'BRIEN
                   I think she's moved in.

         Data is taking all this seriously.

                                    DATA
                   Chief O'Brien, it would not be
                   sporting of me to use any abilities
                   beyond those of the other players.
                   Why would I wish to do such a thing?

                                  O'BRIEN
                   It was only a joke...

         Wesley bursts into the room, excited.

                                   WESLEY
                   Geordi, I got 'em!  I didn't think I'd
                   be able to, but I did!  It's going to
                   be so great...

         The others are amused by Wesley's enthusiasm.

                                   GEORDI
                   Whoa.  Slow down, Wes.  What'd you
                   get?

                                   WESLEY
                        (it's like a meeting with
                        God)
                   Third-row seats at a lecture on warp
                   field dynamics by Doctor Sontok!

                                   GEORDI
                   THE Doctor Sontok?  He hasn't given a
                   talk in years.

                                   WESLEY
                   And hardly anyone knows about this
                   one.  A friend of mine at Amai Central
                   University got US a pair of reserved
                   spots.  That is, if you want to go.

                                   GEORDI
                   Want to go?  Of course I do!  When?
                   Where?










         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - TEASER        3.


                                   WESLEY
                   It's in two days, on Amai Two.

                                   RIKER
                   Two days?  Wes, we can't spare the
                   time.  We have to get to Darga Four as
                   quickly as possible, and that means no
                   diversions.  We're thirty-six hours
                   away as it is.

                                    DATA
                   We will pass within shuttle range of
                   the Amai system in eight point six
                   hours.

                                   WESLEY
                   Well?  It'd be worth a shuttle trip.
                        (off Riker's look)
                   Uh, with the Captain's permission, of
                   course.


         INT.  BEVERLY'S OFFICE

         BEVERLY is seated, talking to Wesley, who's leaning against the
         doorway.

                                   WESLEY
                   OKAY, Mom.  I will.

                                  BEVERLY
                   And be sure to get enough sleep.  I
                   know how you get when there's
                   something interesting to do.

                                   WESLEY
                   Jeez, Mom, it's only a four-day
                   visit...

                                  BEVERLY
                   I know.  I'm sorry, Wes.  I remember
                   my mother doing this, too.  I told
                   myself I never would, but...

                                   WESLEY
                   It's okay.  But I REALLY have to go
                   now, or I think Geordi'll leave
                   without me!

                                  BEVERLY
                   Okay.  Goodbye.

         Wesley turns to leave.










         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - TEASER        4.


                                   WESLEY
                   Bye, Mom.


         INT.  CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SICKBAY

         Geordi is waiting for Wesley.  The two start walking down the
         corridor.

                                   WESLEY
                   Mothers.  Is it just me, or are they
                   all like that?

                                   GEORDI
                   You've got it mild, Wes.  You don't
                   wanna KNOW how my mother used to hover
                   over me.


         INT.  MAIN SHUTTLE BAY

         Wesley and Geordi enter and head toward a large shuttlecraft, the
         "Cochrane," which is waiting.

                                   GEORDI
                   ...She smiles, looks him straight in
                   the eye, and says, "Just try THAT in
                   hyperspace!"

         Wesley bursts out laughing.  The two reach the shuttle and climb
         in.

                                   WESLEY
                   Where'd you hear THAT?

                                   GEORDI

         FADE IN:


         EXT.  SPACE -- AMAI TWO

         The shuttlecraft flies toward the planet, entering the
         atmosphere.


         INT.  AMAI TWO -- SPACE CONTROL

         This is a room a lot like an airport control tower, from which
         incoming and outgoing space flights are directed.  There are lots
         of small screens, in front of which various AMAIANS are seated.
         Other than the screens, the room is white.

         Amaians are fragile, tall people with extremely fair skin.  They
         all wear the same type of white robe, simple yet elegant.

         One of the flight controllers is looking at a display showing
         data about the approaching Enterprise shuttlecraft, as well as a
         schematic of its flight path.  She hits a button on her screen.

                             FLIGHT CONTROLLER
                   Enterprise shuttle, this is Amai Two
                   space control.  You may land at pad
                   thirteen by two.  Please alter your
                   course to zero one three mark five for
                   descent.

                        (filtered)
                   Understood, Amai Two.  Adjusting
                   course.


         INT.  SHUTTLECRAFT

         Geordi is asleep in the passenger compartment; his visor is on
         his chest.  Wesley is at the controls; he hits some buttons.

                                   WESLEY
                   Geordi, we're almost there.  Wake up.

         Geordi awakens, barely.  He's still half-asleep.  He rubs his
         eyes and yawns, then puts on his visor and goes up to the
         copilot's chair.

                                   GEORDI
                   So Wes, you still haven't told me
                   about your friend.  How'd you two
                   meet?

         Wesley obviously likes Sonri more than he realizes.








         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT ONE       7.


                                   WESLEY
                   Sonri?  We met on the physics net.
                   She's studying warp propulsion.  Right
                   now, she's just at Amai Central
                   University, but she wants to go to the
                   Daystrom Institute later on, if
                   they'll accept her.

                                   GEORDI
                   That's quite a leap.  Amai Central
                   isn't exactly known for its physics
                   program.  I didn't even know it HAD
                   one.

                                   WESLEY
                   Not really.  I mean, Amai Two isn't
                   exactly the most advanced place in the
                   Federation.  They're only a member
                   'cause the Klingons attacked them...

                                   GEORDI
                   That's not a very nice thing to say
                   about your friend's home planet.

                                   WESLEY
                   She sure doesn't want to be there.
                   But she can't leave until she's
                   twenty-two.

                                   GEORDI
                   Why not?  The Daystrom Institute would
                   send a ship...

                                   WESLEY
                   Nobody's allowed to leave until
                   they're married and have kids, and the
                   marriage age is twenty-one.  It's a
                   pretty dumb law.

                                   GEORDI
                   I don't know -- you've gotta look at
                   their culture to know if it makes any
                   sense for them.

                                   WESLEY
                   If you say so.


         EXT.  SPACE -- THE SHUTTLECRAFT

         Descending toward the planet.


         INT.  DORMITORY LOBBY









         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT ONE       8.


         This is the lobby of a University dormitory, with white walls,
         floor, and furniture.  There are a couple of Amaians working
         here.  One is painting a picture, a spectacular sunset over a
         desert.  The other is playing beautiful, melodic music on a
         strange-looking stringed instrument; we hear the music in the
         background.  A third Amaian, SONRI, a plain-faced girl about
         Wesley's age with long red hair and lots of freckles, is sitting
         down, waiting for Geordi and Wesley.  She stands when they
         arrive, suitcases in hand.

                                   SONRI
                   Wesley.  It's good to finally see you
                   in person.

         Sonri holds out her left hand, fingers straight and palm
         vertical.  Wesley holds out his left hand the same way and
         presses his palm against Sonri's.  He is a bit tongue-tied.

                                   WESLEY
                   Hi.  Uh, Sonri, this is Geordi
                   LaForge.

                                   SONRI
                   Wesley's told me a lot about you,
                   Commander.  It's an honor to meet such
                   a great mind.

         Wesley is embarrassed by that, but tries to hide it.  Sonri holds
         out her left hand to Geordi, who returns the unfamiliar hand
         greeting.

                                   GEORDI
                   Well, I don't know about THAT.  But
                   it's good to meet you, too.  Call me
                   Geordi.

                                   SONRI
                        (smiles)
                   Come on.  I'll take you to your rooms.

         Sonri turns and heads for the stairs across the room from the
         entrance.


         INT.  DORMITORY HALLWAY

         A white hallway with a white tile floor, and doors (with white
         doorknobs) at even intervals.  There are light grey room
         "numbers" -- actually polygons representing the numbers -- on the
         doors.  The three are walking down the hallway.

                                   SONRI
                   You're lucky you're with Starfleet.
                   The University usually doesn't let
                   visitors stay in the dorms.








         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT ONE       9.


                                   GEORDI
                   What made Doctor Sontok decide to give
                   his talk HERE?

                                   SONRI
                        (sheepishly)
                   I did, actually.  I heard he collected
                   transitionist artwork.  I know a girl
                   who's one of the best transitionists
                   in the Federation.  So, I offered to
                   help her study for a science test.
                        (stops next to a door)
                   Here's your room, Commander.  Wesley
                   is next door, and my room is six doors
                   down.

                                   GEORDI
                   Okay.  I'll join you two in a few
                   minutes.

                                   WESLEY
                   Um, Sonri and I have a lot of things
                   to talk about.  I don't mean you're
                   not...

                                   GEORDI
                   It's okay, Wes.  I understand.  Sonri,
                   can I look around the University after
                   I unpack?

                                   SONRI
                   Of course.  Just ask anyone if you get
                   lost.  This dormitory is Imagination
                   House.

         Geordi nods.  He turns the doorknob -- none of the doors have
         locks -- and enters the room.  It's all white, of course.  Wesley
         and Sonri continue down the hallway as Geordi shuts the door
         behind him.  They reach Wesley's room.

                                   SONRI
                   And here's your room.

                                   WESLEY
                   Great.  Come on in...

         Wesley opens the door, revealing a room identical to Geordi's.


         INT.  DORMITORY BEDROOM

         Wesley and Sonri enter.  Wes sets his suitcase down on the bed,
         then sits next to it.  Sonri sits across from him, next to a
         desk.  She pushes the door closed.









         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT ONE      10.


                                   WESLEY
                   Sonri, why is this place so... so...
                   WHITE?

                                   SONRI
                   White is the simplicity over which
                   individuals express their souls.

                                   WESLEY
                   Huh?

                                   SONRI
                        (laughs)
                   Sorry.  Must be the artistic
                   philosophy classes.  What I mean is,
                   you're free to color your personal
                   space any way you like.  I have a
                   bunch of space pictures on my walls.

                                   WESLEY
                        (shaking his head)
                   Hmm.  I can see why you want to leave.
                   This place is great for an artist, but
                   I can't imagine trying to be an
                   engineer here.

                                   SONRI
                        (nods, then, somber:)
                   It seems like nobody here understands
                   me.  And I sure don't understand them.
                   I'm practically tone deaf, I can't
                   draw at all, and I think most
                   philosophy is pretty silly.
                        (frustrated)
                   I want to get out of here!

                                   WESLEY
                   I'd offer to bring you back with me,
                   but the Captain would just take you
                   home again and lecture me.
                        (mimicing Picard)
                   "Ensign Crusher, Starfleet regulations
                   strictly prohibit the transfer of
                   unauthorized personnel."

                                   SONRI
                        (giggles)
                   From what you've said, though, he
                   sounds like a wise man.

                                   WESLEY
                   Yeah, he's a great captain.  I sure
                   couldn't do his job half as well as he
                   does.  But he can be a bit of a pain
                   sometimes.








         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT ONE      11.


                                   SONRI
                   Perfection is rare, Wesley.

                                   WESLEY
                   Yeah...  So, what about the surprise
                   you said you had for me?

         Sonri stands and motions with her finger -- come here...


         INT.  DORMITORY CORRIDOR, OUTSIDE SONRI'S ROOM

         We see Geordi knocking on Wesley's door.  Nobody answers, so he
         starts walking down the hall toward Sonri's room.  As he walks,
         we hear what's going on behind the door.

                                 SONRI (VO)
                        (muffled)
                   No.  Put your hand THERE.

                                WESLEY (VO)
                        (muffled)
                   Oh!  That's great!  You're pretty good
                   at this.

                                 SONRI (VO)
                        (muffled)
                   I get a lot of practice around here.

                                WESLEY (VO)
                        (muffled)
                   I try to do it on the holodeck at
                   least once a day, but there's only so
                   much a computer can do for you.

         Geordi arrives at the door, unaware of what's going on.  He
         knocks.  The door opens immediately, revealing Wesley and
         Sonri... at a computer terminal on Sonri's desk, manipulating a
         warp field diagram.


         INT.  SONRI'S ROOM

         The walls here are covered with beautiful spacescapes.  It's like
         standing on the observation deck on the Enterprise.

                                   WESLEY
                   Hi, Geordi...  Hey, take a look at
                   what Sonri and I did.  It's an
                   inverted...

                                   GEORDI
                   There's no time, Wes.  I just got a
                   call from Amai Space Control.  We're
                   needed there.








         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT ONE      12.


                                   WESLEY
                        (glances at Sonri)
                   What about the lecture?

                                   GEORDI
                   We may have to miss some of it.

                                   WESLEY
                        (to Sonri)
                   Can you record it?  I have to go...

                                   SONRI
                        (unhappy)
                   Sure, I guess I can.  Try not to take
                   too long...

                                   WESLEY
                   I will.  Hopefully we'll be back soon.
                        (gets up)
                   Well, bye...

                                   SONRI
                   Goodbye.

         Wesley and Geordi leave the room.


         INT.  DORMITORY CORRIDOR

         Wes and Geordi are walking away.

                                   WESLEY
                   What's this about?

                                   GEORDI
                   They've picked up an unidentified
                   ship...


         INT.  SPACE CONTROL

         Wesley and Geordi are leaning over a console with the flight
         controller.

                             FLIGHT CONTROLLER
                   We have really old sensors.  We just
                   saw it three hours ago.  It's headed
                   straight for Amai Two.

                                   WESLEY
                   That's a really odd reading.

                                   GEORDI
                   If I didn't know any better...

                             FLIGHT CONTROLLER
                   Yes?

                                   GEORDI
                   Well, that looks an awful lot like an
                   old Bussard ramjet design, with a
                   magnetic scoop.

                                   WESLEY
                   A ramjet?  But at those speeds, it'd
                   have to be...

                                   GEORDI
                   ...several hundred years old.  Wes, we
                   HAVE to take a closer look.


         EXT.  SPACE -- THE SHUTTLECRAFT

         Flying through space.


         INT.  SHUTTLECRAFT

         Wesley and Geordi are both in the control cabin.

                                   WESLEY
                   A ramjet.  I know they're possible in
                   theory, but I don't think I've ever
                   heard of someone actually building
                   one.

                                   GEORDI
                        (looking out the window)
                   I've only heard about one of them, but
                   it looks like this one's a LOT bigger.
                        (puzzled)
                   Hey, that's weird.

                                   WESLEY
                   What?

                                   GEORDI
                   Well, it looks like there's a low-
                   frequency FM signal coming from their
                   engines.  They're using them as a
                   transmitter.

                                   WESLEY
                        (checking his console)
                   It looks like an automatic signal.  It
                   keeps repeating.
                        (hits some buttons, then
                        looks at Geordi)
                   Docking instructions...








         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT ONE      14.


                                   GEORDI
                   Looks like we're going to get a REALLY
                   close look at this beauty.


         EXT.  SPACE -- THE STARSEEKER

         A large ramjet -- a cylinder, with a slightly wider section at
         the fore end.  The center is hollow.  It moves by generating a
         magnetic field and pulling hydrogen through its center, crushing
         it until a fusion reaction is obtained, and expelling the
         resulting energized helium like a rocket out the aft end.  This
         is barely visible as a dimly glowing green jet shooting from the
         thin end of the Starseeker.  The surface of the Starseeker should
         be pitted and dented, as it's been in space for a long time with
         very minimal (by Federation standards) navigational shielding.

         A landing bay door opens toward the fore end, to admit the
         shuttlecraft.  The landing bay's ceiling is fore; its floor is
         aft, since the ramjet's "gravity" is really its forward
         acceleration.  The bay door closes when the shuttle is inside.


         INT.  STARSEEKER -- LANDING BAY

         This is a dirty, grungy place, very much in contrast to the
         Enterprise's antiseptic interior.  There are several clunky-
         looking shuttlecraft present.  It's apparent that nobody has been
         here for a long time.

         Our shuttle has just landed; its warp engines are powering down.
         We hear the bay filling with air.


         INT.  SHUTTLECRAFT


                                   GEORDI
                   I hardly see any noise from the
                   engine.  That must be some great
                   shielding.

                                   WESLEY
                        (looking at his controls)
                   Well, there's air now.  It's
                   breathable, but a little thin.  Do we
                   go out and look around?

         Geordi is putting a small PHASER on his belt.  He hands another
         to Wesley.

                                   GEORDI
                   Just in case.  Let's go.










         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT ONE      15.


         INT.  STARSEEKER -- LANDING BAY

         A door has opened to admit TARGOFF, a tall Dulian (humanoid, a
         tall, very handsome race) and two Dulian BODYGUARDS.  Targoff's
         manner suggests that he is missing a few screws upstairs -- he's
         wild-eyed and intense.

         The shuttle door opens, and Geordi and Wesley emerge and stand by
         the shuttle.  They look at each other in surprise -- so there ARE
         people here.  Targoff approaches.

                                  TARGOFF
                   I am Targoff, commander of the
                   Starseeker.

                                   GEORDI
                   I'm Lieutenant Commander Geordi
                   LaForge, and this is Ensign Wesley
                   Crusher.  We're from the starship
                   Enterprise, of the United Federation
                   of Planets.

                                  TARGOFF
                        (pointing at the shuttle)
                   This is the Enterprise?

                                   WESLEY
                   No.  This is just a shuttle.  The
                   Enterprise is about a third as big as
                   this ramjet.

                                  TARGOFF
                   I see.
                        (indicates the doorway)
                   Come.  I will show you the Starseeker.

                                   GEORDI
                        (smiling to Wesley)
                   It'd be an honor.  I've never been on
                   a ship like this before.

         Targoff and his guards lead Geordi and Wesley through the door
         from which they emerged.  As they leave, Targoff speaks.

                                  TARGOFF
                   The Starseeker has been out here for
                   fourteen generations.  We've tried to
                   colonize three other planets, but they
                   weren't quite right for us.


         INT.  STARSEEKER -- CORRIDOR

         We follow Geordi and Wesley through the doorway from the landing
         bay.  As soon as they are through the door, two more BODYGUARDS,








         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT ONE      16.


         their guns leveled at Geordi and Wesley, step into view.

         Geordi instinctively reaches for his phaser, but the guard
         nearest him bradishes his gun.

                                  TARGOFF
                   Don't even think it.

         Geordi and Wesley toss their phasers away.  Close-up on their
         reactions...

         FADE OUT.

         END OF ACT ONE.

If you're reading this, I'll assume you've finished reading part 1, which
contained the teaser and act 1.  Aside from the fact that my dialogue isn't
that great in places, something that can be fixed without a whole lot of
trouble, the script has some big problems.

First of all is the expense.  The TNG people don't like to build more than two
sets per episode (which doesn't mean it never happens, but it's really rare.)
Set construction is very expensive, and the more you can confine your story to
a few rooms, the better off you'll be.  As a rule of thumb, every Enterprise
set you've seen more than once is a standing set, and can be used if desired.
(Sets can also be redressed fairly extensively once they're built, so you may
be in good shape if you have several locations that look similar.)

Several rooms can easily be cut out of the Amai Two sequence in act one, and
some of the Starseeker sets below can be redresses of Amai Two and of existing
Enterprise sets.

The teaser is another problem.  It doesn't really grab the reader.  If at all
possible, each act (and the teaser) should end with a startling revelation or
with some imminent danger.  Think of TNG as a series of five really short
movie serials.  The hero has to be dangling over the alligator pit at the end
of each segment.  (In truth, of course, we want the viewer to be glued to the
set during the commercials to avoid missing the resolution to the problem.)

The first act isn't a whole lot better.  There's no action, no plot movement.
There is some character interaction, which is always good, but the plot needs
to move along while that's happening.  Until the end of act one, we don't even
have a clue what the plot's going to be ABOUT.

Anyway, I'll shut up now and let the story continue.  I'll post part 3 shortly,
with a couple of comments about coming up with stories.  (The page numbers
start over at 1 here, just because I'm too lazy to make nroff start at the
appropriate number.)

         FADE IN:


         INT.  STARSEEKER -- PRISON CELL

         This is a dark, poorly-kept cell.  The jailers are obviously not
         too concerned about prisoner sanitation.  There's a small window
         in the metal door, blocked by a grid of bars.  There are no
         benches or beds in the cell.  Geordi is sitting on the floor
         against the wall opposite the door.  His visor has been taken
         away.  Wesley is by the door, looking out the window.  He turns.
         Then he tries tapping his communicator; it buzzes.

                                   GEORDI
                   Their shielding's too good, Wes.  Just
                   sit down.  They'll be back.

                                   WESLEY
                   They've just left us sitting here for
                   hours.  They can't want us too much.

                                   GEORDI
                   That all depends on what they want us
                   FOR.  They may just be trying to break
                   our spirits.  When you go to the
                   Academy, you'll be trained for things
                   like this.

                                   WESLEY
                        (sitting)
                   Unfortunately, I'm here NOW.
                        (sighs)
                   So, what'd you think of Sonri?

                                   GEORDI
                   She seemed nice enough.  The important
                   thing is, what do YOU think of her?

                                   WESLEY
                   What do you mean?

                                   GEORDI
                   It's pretty obvious.  You have a
                   crush.

                                   WESLEY
                   What?  No.  I mean, I... No.

                                   GEORDI
                   There's nothing wrong with it, Wes.
                   It's natural...

                                   WESLEY
                   Look... I like her a lot.  But I
                   certainly don't have a CRUSH on her.
                   Okay?

                                   GEORDI
                        (amused)
                   All right, Wes, if you say so.

                                   WESLEY
                   Anyway, I don't want to talk about her
                   any more.  How about a game of chess?

                                   GEORDI
                   Um, Wesley, we don't have a board, and
                   I couldn't see it if we did.

                                   WESLEY
                   Who said anything about a board?

                                   GEORDI
                   Right...  Okay, I think I can manage
                   that.

                                   WESLEY
                   Pick a number between one and ten.

                                   GEORDI
                   Three.

                                   WESLEY
                   Okay, you're white.  Ready?

                                   GEORDI
                   Give me a second.
                        (beat)
                   Okay, got it.  Um, pawn to queen four.

                                   WESLEY
                   Knight to...

         The game is interrupted by the entrance of Targoff, and a pair of
         TRAHN GUARDS.  The Trahns are shorter than the Dulians, and are
         not very good-looking.  There is a Trahn guard standing outside
         the cell door.  Geordi stands.

                                   GEORDI
                        (quietly, to Wesley)
                   I'll do the talking.

                                  TARGOFF
                   We have examined your shuttlecraft.
                   You have some VERY interesting
                   technology.  It could mean an end to
                   our journey, after fourteen
                   generations in space.

                                   GEORDI
                        (turning to face Targoff's
                        voice)
                   Be careful which buttons you push, or
                   you might find yourself with a big
                   hole where your landing bay door used
                   to be.

                                  TARGOFF
                        (as if berating a
                        subordinate)
                   Be quiet.  Now.  Obviously, there
                   isn't enough room for all of us on
                   your shuttle.  So tell me of your
                   Enterprise.

                                   GEORDI
                   Oh, no.  You aren't going to get
                   anything out of us while you keep us
                   prisoner.

                                  TARGOFF
                   Wrong.  You will tell me what I want
                   to know, and you'll tell it to me
                   here.

                                   GEORDI
                   Or what?

                                  TARGOFF
                   This is one of the pleasant areas of
                   the Starseeker.  Others are much
                   closer to the magnetic coils.  The
                   shielding is not as...  effective
                   there.  We lost a great many Trahns
                   before closing those sections off.

                                   GEORDI
                   And what do you hope to gain from a
                   knowledge of the Enterprise?

                                  TARGOFF
                   All knowledge is useful.  Now.  Tell
                   me of the Enterprise.  How many men
                   can it carry?  What are its armaments?
                   Anything like your hand weapon?

                                   GEORDI
                   You'll find out if you keep us here...

                   Captain's log, stardate 44505.9.  The
                   Darga Four situation is under control.
                   We're stopping off at Amai Two for
                   some brief shore leave.


         INT.  BRIDGE

         PICARD, RIKER, DATA, and WORF are at their stations.  The Amai
         Two flight controller is on the viewscreen.

                        (in disbelief)
                   A WHAT?

                             FLIGHT CONTROLLER
                   That IS what he said.  A ramjet.

                   We are picking up an electromagnetic
                   disturbance.  Its signatures are
                   similar to those of traditional ramjet
                   designs.

                                   RIKER
                   Sounds like they missed their

                                   RIKER
                   So much for stopping off at Amai Two
                   for a couple of days.

                                   PICARD
                   Mm.  But this is much more absorbing,
                   Number One.  Besides, I don't think
                   Amai Two would be quite to your
                   liking.

                                   RIKER
                   I was thinking of you, sir.  A whole
                   planet full of artists and
                   philosophers:
                        (smirking)
                   you'd be on the first shore party.

                                   PICARD
                   Indeed, Number One.  Perhaps later.
                   Time to arrival, Mister Data?

                                    DATA

                   Aye, sir.

                                    WORF
                   I have a more detailed scan now,

                   On screen.

         A computer representation of the Starseeker appears on the
         screen.  It shows the electromagnetic field, the cone of incoming
         hydrogen, and the accelerated fused results leaving the other
         end, all in animated schematics.  Picard is like a kid in a candy
         store -- this is why he's out in space.

                                   PICARD
                   Remarkable.  Absolutely astounding.

                   Length is approximately one kilometer.

                   Intense magnetic fields are drawing
                   hydrogen in one end and compressing
                   it, resulting in a fusion reaction
                   which...

                                   PICARD
                        (interrupting)
                   Yes, Data, we know how a ramjet works.
                        (to Worf)
                   Any sign of the shuttle?

                                    WORF
                   Not yet.

                                    DATA
                   The ramjet's electromagnetic fields
                   will prevent reliable sensor and
                   transporter operation.


         INT.  PRISON CELL

         Geordi and Wesley are sitting alone again, but not for long:
         Targoff barges in, accompanied by two Trahns.  The same guard is
         outside the cell door; he watches.  One of Targoff's Trahns is
         carrying Geordi's visor.  Targoff points at Geordi, then at the
         door.  The Trahn with Geordi's visor picks him up by the arm and
         starts to lead him off.

                                   WESLEY
                        (standing)
                   Hey!  Where are you taking him?

                                  TARGOFF
                   He is going to aid us in capturing
                   your Enterprise.  It has arrived here.











         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT TWO       7.


                                   GEORDI
                        (facing Targoff's voice)
                   What?  You've got another think
                   coming, Targoff.

                                  TARGOFF
                   I don't think so.  Trahn.

         Targoff pushes the other Trahn toward Wesley.  The Trahn grabs
         Wesley by the arm.  Wes tries to squirm free, but the guard is
         far too strong.  The guard pulls out a sharp knife.

                                  TARGOFF
                        (to Geordi)
                   If you refuse, we will kill your
                   companion.

                                   GEORDI
                   And if I agree, you'll kill even more
                   people trying to take over the
                   Enterprise.  No deal.

                                  TARGOFF
                   Ah.  But their deaths will be quick,
                   painless.  Your companion's will not.

                                   GEORDI
                   I'm sorry, Wes.  You know I can't do
                   it.

         Targoff stares into Geordi's eyes.  He can't read them at all,
         and finally turns away with a slight shiver -- those white eyes
         give him the creeps.

                                  TARGOFF
                   Very well.  Trahn?

         The Trahn cuts Wesley's hand with the blade of the knife.  Wesley
         does his best to keep quiet, but doesn't quite succeed.  Geordi
         hears this and flinches, but holds fast.

                                  TARGOFF
                   Now the left eye.

         The Trahn moves to comply...

                                   GEORDI
                   All right, all right!  You're a bunch
                   of barbarians, you know that?

                                  TARGOFF
                        (smugly)
                   Yes.










         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT TWO       8.


                                   GEORDI
                   And my help won't amount to much.
                   There's still no way you're going to
                   get enough people aboard to make the
                   Enterprise's security teams sweat.

                                  TARGOFF
                   Our soldiers are very good at what
                   they do.  Your shuttlecraft will hold
                   enough of them.  All you need do is
                   bring them aboard.

                                   GEORDI
                   You trust me to do that?

                                  TARGOFF
                   Of course.  If you betray us, your
                   companion will see his heart before he
                   dies.  Trahn, take him.  Give him his
                   eyepiece.

         Geordi, putting on his visor, is escorted out of the room by one
         of the Trahns.  Targoff stares at Wesley for a moment, then
         signals the other Trahn to let go of Wes.  Wes collapses to the
         floor, clutching his hand.

                                  TARGOFF
                   With me, Trahn.

         The two aliens leave.

                   Interference from the ramjet is too
                   great for a detailed scan, or for

                   Security team to shuttle bay two.

         Worf walks quickly from the bridge, leaving via the main
         turbolift.


         INT.  SHUTTLECRAFT

         We are approaching the Enterprise.  The shuttlecraft is packed
         with TRAHN SOLDIERS, all armed with nasty-looking guns (plasma
         pistols.) Their leader, TRODIN, a Dulian, is pointing Geordi's
         phaser at his head.  Geordi hits some buttons, and shuttle bay
         two's door starts to open.

                                   TRODIN
                        (looking at the Enterprise)
                   That one is shuttle bay two?

                                   GEORDI
                   Yes.

                                   TRODIN
                   Land in the large one,
                        (pointing to the main
                        shuttle bay)
                   THERE.

                                   GEORDI
                   But the door's closed...

                                   TRODIN
                        (brings the phaser closer)
                   Then open it, like you did the other.
                   I won't walk into your trap.
                        (brings the phaser REALLY
                        close)
                   Now!


         INT.  MAIN SHUTTLE BAY

         The door opens, and the shuttle flies in...

         FADE OUT.

         END OF ACT TWO.

         FADE IN:


         INT.  SHUTTLE BAY

         The shuttlecraft enters the bay.  As soon as it clears the force
         field, its door opens and soldiers jump to the floor.  One of
         them shoots a SECURITY GUARD, who was on duty next to the main
         doorway and had just managed to draw his phaser.  The guard
         falls, his weapon lying a few feet away.  The shuttle, meanwhile,
         has landed; Trodin shoves Geordi out at phaserpoint.  The
         soldiers make for the door.


         INT.  BRIDGE


                                    DATA
                   Sir, the shuttle has landed in the
                   main shuttle bay, not bay two.
                   Notifying Lieutenant Worf.

         Data hits some buttons.  The red alert siren sounds.

                                    DATA
                   Weapons have been fired in the main
                   shuttle bay.  Intruders have left the
                   bay.

                                   PICARD
                   Activate force fields.

         INT.  CORRIDOR

         The Trahn soldiers (one of whom is holding the security guard's
         phaser,) Geordi, and Trodin are stuck in a section of corridor.
         One of the soldiers tests the force field with a hand.

                                   TRODIN
                   Get rid of those walls.

         Geordi touches a wall panel, which activates.

                                   GEORDI

                                   GEORDI
                   I can't...

                                   TRODIN
                   Then remove the power source, Chief
                   Engineer.

                                   GEORDI
                   I can't do that.

                                   TRODIN
                        (pointing his gun at Geordi)
                   You will try, or I will kill you.

                                   GEORDI
                   Then I guess you'll have to kill me.
                   All I promised was to get you onboard,
                   and you're here.

         Trodin points the phaser at Geordi's head for a moment.

                                   TRODIN
                   No.  You may still be useful.

         Trodin turns and fires the phaser at the wall next to the force
         field.  The phaser-toting soldier does the same.  Sparks start to
         fly across the corridor.

                                   GEORDI
                   Wait!  If you overload those circuits,
                   the whole corridor could blow!

                                   TRODIN
                        (still firing)
                   Then help us.

                                   GEORDI

                   thirteen by F-three and twelve by D-
                   eight.  Propogate.

         The force fields vanish; Trodin and the soldier stop firing the
         phasers.  We see that the walls are scorched from the phaser
         hits.

         At Trodin's motioned command, the troops run around a corner --
         and right into Worf and a group of SECURITY GUARDS, who were
         coming the other way.  There's no time to draw weapons; hand-to-
         hand combat ensues.  Worf throws one Trahn against a computer
         panel, which lights up then deactivates several seconds later
         (though this shouldn't be emphasized) when there's no command.
         We notice Trodin escaping, though none of the Enterprise people
         do.  The battle is over shortly, thanks largely to Worf.

                                   GEORDI
                   Wait a minute.  There's one missing...


         INT.  CORRIDOR

         Trodin is running down the corridor when the force fields come
         back on.  He slams into one, painfully, but immediately gets up
         and fires at the emitter, as before.

         FX: TRANSPORTER.  Trodin starts to beam out.

         He looks at his body and yelps in surprise.

                                   TRODIN
                   What the...?


         EXT.  SPACE -- ENTERPRISE AND STARSEEKER

         Time has passed.


         INT.  SICKBAY

         The security guard from the shuttle bay is on a bed, unconscious.
         One of the Trahn soldiers is on another bed nearby, also
         unconscious.  There are two security guards present.  Beverly is
         scanning the soldier.  Picard enters and goes to the guard's bed.

                                   PICARD
                   How's he doing, Doctor?

                                  BEVERLY
                   He'll be ready for duty again in a
                   couple of days.

                                   PICARD
                        (walking to the soldier's
                        bed)
                   And your other patient?

                                  BEVERLY
                   He has minor head injuries and some
                   internal bleeding.  That must have
                   been some fight.

                                   PICARD
                   Worf was involved.

         Beverly looks at the captain.  That explains it...

                                   PICARD
                   Anything else, Doctor?

                                  BEVERLY
                   His brain chemistry is very odd.  I
                   can't be sure right now, but my guess
                   is that he's received large doses of
                   drugs recently.

                                   PICARD
                   Drugs?  For what purpose?

                                  BEVERLY
                   I won't know until I've had a chance
                   to run more tests.

         She stops working for a moment.

                                  BEVERLY
                   Jean-Luc, I'm really...

                                   PICARD
                   I know, Beverly.  We'll get him back.

         Beverly isn't convinced.  But she goes back to work.


         INT.  DEBRIEFING ROOM

         Troi, Riker, and Worf are grilling Trodin.  There are two
         security guards standing behind Trodin, ready to stun him if he
         tries anything.  Trodin is very calm, though.  Worf is playing
         the "bad cop."

                                   RIKER
                   We know you're the leader of this
                   little gang.

                                   TRODIN
                   Obviously...

                                    TROI
                   What do you mean by that?

                                   TRODIN
                   They are Trahns.  I am a Dulian.

                                    WORF
                   That means nothing to us.

                                   TRODIN
                   That... is your problem.

                                    WORF
                        (leaning in close)
                   I warn you.  Do not mock us.

                                   RIKER
                   Worf...
                        (to Trodin)
                   Now.  Tell us about your ship.

                                   TRODIN
                   You mean you can't see inside with
                   your powerful scanners?

                                   RIKER
                   We want to hear it from you.

                                   TRODIN
                        (peering at Riker)
                   You CAN'T scan us, can you?  You're
                   not as powerful as you look.

                                    WORF
                   We are strong enough.  Now answer our
                   questions!

                                   TRODIN
                   No.  I'm your prisoner, so you're
                   going to kill me whether I tell you
                   anything or not.

         Troi looks at Riker -- what does this imply about the culture
         over there?

                                   RIKER
                   We never kill unless we're forced to.

                                   TRODIN
                        (lying, and not hiding it)
                   Neither do we.

                                    TROI
                   WE mean it.  Right now, one of your
                   soldiers is receiving medical
                   attention.

         Trodin looks at Troi.

                                   TRODIN
                   But they're all Trahns.  Why?

                                    TROI
                   They are people.

                                   TRODIN
                   Not the same way we are.
                        (beat)
                   They're barbaric, uncivilized fools.
                   If it weren't for us, they'd've killed
                   themselves off by now.








         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT THREE    16.


                                    TROI
                   Your people are subjugating the
                   Trahns...

                                   TRODIN
                   Ruling them.

                                   RIKER
                   It sounds more like slavery to me...

                                   TRODIN
                        (laughs)
                   Subjugation!  Slavery!  The Trahns are
                   glad to be ruled.  We've given up as
                   much as they have.  We share the
                   Starseeker with them.  We give them
                   the benefits of our technology, our
                   expertise...

                                    WORF
                   But not your medicine?

                                   TRODIN
                   They already outnumber us ten to one.
                   We don't want to make it even worse.

                                   RIKER
                   It sounds like it already IS worse.


         INT.  BEVERLY'S OFFICE

         Beverly is seated, working at the viewscreen on her desk.  We see
         a complex molecular model -- the drug from the Trahn's brain.

                                  BEVERLY

                                  BEVERLY
                   I've isolated our mystery drug.
                        (looks at the model)
                   This is a VERY well-designed chemical.
                   It appears to selectively inhibit
                   neural impulses in the brain of the
                   subject.

                                PICARD (VO)

                                  BEVERLY
                   I think so.

                                PICARD (VO)
                        (filtered)
                   What does it control?

                                  BEVERLY
                   I don't know for sure, but my guess is
                   it's to keep them submissive.  It's
                   physically addictive.  If the drug
                   were removed, the shock would probably
                   kill the patient.
                        (disgusted)
                   They'd have no choice but to keep
                   taking it.


         INT.  BRIDGE

         Picard and Data are at their stations.  The others are manned by
         various crewmembers.

                                   PICARD
                   Can it affect humans?

                        (filtered)
                   It's very specific to this species'
                   brain chemistry.

                                   PICARD
                        (nodding)
                   Understood.
                        (sighs, then, to himself:)
                   Barbaric.

                                    DATA
                   Sir?  Human history contains several
                   instances of drug usage by military
                   agencies, to ensure loyalty.

                                   PICARD
                   That doesn't make it right, Data.

                                    DATA
                        (considers this)
                   I see, sir.  But the Prime Directive
                   would seem to apply here.

                                   PICARD
                   The moment Commander LaForge and
                   Mister Crusher were captured, we
                   became intimately involved in all
                   this.  And we will remain involved

                   Report to the conference room.  Mister
                   Data, you have the conn.

         Picard heads for the conference room.


         EXT.  SPACE -- THE ENTERPRISE

         Time has passed.


         INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

         Geordi, Picard, Riker, Troi, Beverly, and Worf are present.
         Beverly is close to tears.

                                  BEVERLY
                   These people sound hideous.  We can't
                   just sit out here and wait, Jean-Luc.

                                    WORF
                   Recommend we demonstrate our ability
                   to find Ensign Crusher by force.

                                   RIKER
                   I'm with Worf on this one.  It's time
                   we showed them we can bite back.

                                   GEORDI
                   I'm not sure it would make any
                   difference.  Their leader seemed like
                   he wasn't quite all there.

                                   PICARD
                   We will use force, if necessary.  But
                   if they're willing to kill Wesley,
                   they've already done it by now.
                   Otherwise, he's safe for a while
                   longer.

                                  BEVERLY
                   You don't KNOW that!

                                   PICARD
                   Doctor, please.
                        (gently)
                   I know he's your son.  But we must
                   treat this as we would any other
                   hostage situation.

         Beverly bites back a strong response, then nods weakly.  Troi
         puts a hand on her forearm, reassuring her.

                                   PICARD
                   Now.  Mister Worf, what have you
                   learned from the rest of the boarding
                   party?

                                    WORF
                        (slightly chagrined)
                   Nothing, sir.  They refused to
                   speak...

                                  BEVERLY
                        (nods)
                   That'd be an effect of the drug,
                   Captain.  We're not going to get
                   anything from them.

                   On my way, Commander.

         Everyone leaves for the bridge.


         INT.  BRIDGE

         Everyone comes in from the conference room and goes to the
         appropriate station.

                                   PICARD
                   Let's hear it.

                   have captured and held a member of my

                        (filtered)
                   Yes, we have.  At the moment, he is
                   unharmed.

         Beverly is relieved at this, but Targoff's next words have the
         opposite effect:

                                TARGOFF (VO)
                        (filtered)
                        (continuing)
                   He will die, unless you give me
                   control of your ship NOW.

                                   PICARD
                   No.  We will not be coerced.

                                TARGOFF (VO)
                        (filtered)
                   Very well.  Then you will hear your
                   Wesley Crusher's screams as his limbs
                   are ripped from his body.

         Beverly is NOT amused by this.

                                  BEVERLY
                   No!  Harm him in the slightest, and
                   I'll see you shrieking with...

         INT.  STARSEEKER -- PRISON CELL

         Wesley is asleep on the floor in a corner.  He has ripped a strip
         of cloth from his shirt; it's wrapped around his injured hand.

         He wakes up as four Trahn guards, all armed, enter.  One of them
         points a gun at Wesley, and motions for him to go through the
         door.

         Wesley gets up.

         FADE OUT.

I hope you're all enjoying the story so far.  I think you'll agree that acts
two and three are a big improvement over the teaser and act one; the last
two acts, IMHO, are the best.

First, some words about where good stories come from.  In general, the most
successful TNG episodes are based on character interaction, and the science
fiction stories that surround the character stuff is essentially spraypainted
on.  "The Nth Degree," for instance, is about Barclay, not about subspace
field distortions or neural interfaces.  (I think that's an example everyone
can agree on, if you ignore the last five minutes.)

There are exceptions -- "Yesterday's Enterprise" was more plot-driven than
character-driven.  But I think they're pretty rare.  A story that starts out
from solid characterization, in which the technical stuff is secondary, will
by and large be more successful than a story based on gadgets, in which our
people just happen to be the ones using them.

Of course, the spraypaint is important, too; this is Star Trek, after all.
In general, if a story is action-packed and has lots of suspense, it's more
likely to be accepted.  By no means, though, try to shoehorn suspense and
danger into a story.  That usually comes out pretty poorly (the "tacked on
jeopardy" technique.)  It's almost always possible to get some tension out
of a good story without forcing things.  It's also important to make sure the
plot is intimately related to the character story -- we can have Riker and
Beverly fall in love, but if it has nothing to do with the mission at hand,
it's going to look hackneyed.  (Multiple unrelated stories may be more
realistic, but this is drama, not a documentary.)

And with that, I'll present the final part of "Reins Of Power."  I hope you
can read it with a critical eye, to see where I've violated these guidelines.
If I had this story to do over today (assuming I could still use Wesley!)
it'd come out fairly differently.

         EXT.  SPACE -- THE ENTERPRISE AND THE STARSEEKER


                                PICARD (VO)
                   Captain's log, supplemental.  It has
                   been twenty minutes since Targoff
                   threatened to kill Wesley Crusher.  We
                   have heard nothing since then.


         EXT.  SPACE -- THE STARSEEKER

         Establish the location...


         INT.  HIDEOUT

         This room, in a neglected part of the Starseeker, is the lair of
         the secret Trahn leader.  There are tattered pieces of cloth
         blocking the entrance.  ALLEA, a particularly ugly Trahn woman of
         about sixty, is talking to a few other Trahns when Wesley is
         brought in, struggling, by the four Trahn guards.

                                   WESLEY
                   Where are you taking me?  Let me go!

         Allea motions to the guards, who release Wesley.  She is very
         confident in her speech.

                                   ALLEA
                   You are from the Enterprise.

                                   WESLEY
                   That's right.  Where's Targoff?  I
                   want to talk to him NOW.

                                   ALLEA
                   It would be a sad day indeed if
                   Targoff were HERE, Enterprise crewman.
                   Do you have a name?  I am Allea.

                                   WESLEY
                   Ensign Wesley Crusher.  What's going
                   on here?










         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT FOUR      2.


                                   ALLEA
                   Please, sit.

         Allea motions to a worn chair.  It doesn't look comfortable, but
         after the floor, Wesley gladly accepts.  He looks at Allea, then
         looks around the room.

                                   WESLEY
                   Targoff doesn't know about this place,
                   does he?  Or about you.

                                   ALLEA
                   He knows about me.  He just doesn't
                   know where I am.  The Starseeker is a
                   big place.  He can only watch some of
                   it, especially when some of his
                   eyes...
                        (indicates the guards)
                   are really mine.

                                   WESLEY
                   What's going on here?  Does Targoff
                   know you have me?

                                   ALLEA
                   If he doesn't, he'll discover it soon.
                   You should be grateful.  He was about
                   to have you tortured, to pressure your
                   Enterprise.

                                   WESLEY
                        (snorts)
                   It wouldn't have worked.

                                   ALLEA
                   I believe that.  But Targoff's grasp
                   of the real world is not very tight.
                   In any case, I decided that you would
                   be more useful alive, and in my hands.

                                   WESLEY
                        (nervous)
                   Useful?  How?

                                   ALLEA
                        (off his look)
                   No, nothing like that.  We usually
                   leave the torture to the Dulians.

                                   WESLEY
                   Then what do you want with me?

                                   ALLEA
                   The same thing Targoff did, really.
                   He's not completely stupid.  When he

                                  ALLEA (Cont'd)
                   can't deliver you, he'll know the
                   Enterprise won't be too pleased about
                   it.  He'll want you back, and quickly.
                   I intend to use that.

                                   WESLEY
                   By holding a hostage hostage?

                                   ALLEA
                   We have some demands which must be
                   heard, and this is the only way we'll
                   get Targoff and his council to listen
                   to us.

                                   WESLEY
                   Demands.  What are they?

                                   ALLEA
                   We want access to the Starseeker's
                   hospitals.  We want a seat on the
                   ruling council.  We want the curfews
                   lifted and the checkpoints removed.

                                   WESLEY
                   You shouldn't need to take a hostage
                   to get THOSE.  None of that sounds
                   unreasonable.

                                   ALLEA
                   But the Dulians are unreasonable.
                   Completely.

                                   WESLEY
                   Why?  What do they do?

                                   ALLEA
                   We work for them, and they give us
                   just enough freedom to keep us from
                   rioting.

                                   WESLEY
                   You're slaves...

                                   ALLEA
                        (sarcastic)
                   They saved us.  If it weren't for
                   THEM, we'd all be dead.

                                   WESLEY
                   What do you mean?

                                   ALLEA
                   We couldn't stay on our planet.
                   Almost all the plants and animals were

                                  ALLEA (Cont'd)
                   dead from the pollution.  So the
                   Dulians built the Starseeker.  They'd
                   find another world, and try to make up
                   for what they did to ours.  They told
                   us that included an end to the labor
                   camps.  They just wanted some of us
                   here, too.

                                   WESLEY
                   So you and the Dulians are from the
                   same planet.

                                   ALLEA
                   Yes.  When they found us, we were
                   living among the trees.  We were at
                   peace with the world.

                                   WESLEY
                   And they took you back with them,
                   right?  This is really familiar.  It's
                   happened on hundreds of planets.

                                   ALLEA
                   They took our great-grandparents back
                   to their cities.  It was all so new to
                   us then.  They seemed like gods to us.
                   We didn't know any better than to do
                   what they asked, at first.

                                   WESLEY
                   And then?

                                   ALLEA
                   And then we saw them for what they
                   were.  People, who had more knowledge
                   than we did and were using it to force
                   us into submission.

                                   WESLEY
                   Didn't you fight back?

                                   ALLEA
                   There were revolts, but the Dulians
                   were too powerful.  They even used
                   drugs to keep us obedient after the
                   first couple of times.  We never did
                   anything but make them angry, and make
                   our own lives worse.

         Wesley mulls this over.

                                   WESLEY
                   Isn't kidnapping me going to do the
                   same thing?








         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT FOUR      5.


                                   ALLEA
                   It would.  But now THEY have a knife
                   at their throats.  The Enterprise.
                   They're as defenseless against it as
                   we are against them.  Oh, Targoff
                   won't see it for a while.  He's been
                   in charge too long, and he can't
                   imagine being challenged by anyone.
                   But I've talked to the guards who saw
                   your shuttle, who tested your weapons.
                   You're generations ahead of us.

                                   WESLEY
                        (looking around)
                   Well, yeah, we are.  But if you're
                   expecting the Enterprise to start
                   cutting the Starseeker to pieces until
                   the Dulians give in, you're in for a
                   surprise.

                                   ALLEA
                   Meaning?

                                   WESLEY
                   Meaning that we're peaceful.

                                   ALLEA
                   Peaceful?  So why were you armed?

                                   WESLEY
                   For SELF-DEFENSE.  If the Starseeker
                   started attacking the Enterprise, it
                   would shoot back.  But otherwise,
                   they'll wait.
                        (sighs)
                   And even if they didn't, you're still
                   not doing this right.  Okay, let's say
                   Targoff agrees to your demands.  Then
                   what?  I leave the ship, and the
                   Enterprise goes away.  What's to stop
                   Targoff from clamping down on you?

         Allea looks angry for a moment, and almost says something.  She
         thinks better of it.

                                   ALLEA
                   We have to do SOMETHING.  We can't
                   just let ourselves be crushed.

                                   WESLEY
                   I agree.  You DO have to do something.
                   But it has to be a lot more than just
                   asking for a few stupid little tokens.
                   The only way your people are going to
                   get out of this is if YOU'RE the ones

                                  WESLEY (Cont'd)
                   on top.  The Dulians won't let you get
                   away with anything else.

                                   ALLEA
                   A rebellion?  No.  We tried it on our
                   planet...

                                   WESLEY
                   This isn't your planet.  From what
                   I've seen, you outnumber them.
                   There's no reason you can't free
                   yourselves.

                                   ALLEA
                   But... the Dulians are in control of
                   the ship.  They can just seal all the
                   doors and keep us away.  We wouldn't
                   know how to open them.

                                   WESLEY
                   I can help you with that.  I know a
                   few things about electronics.

                                   ALLEA
                   I have to think about this...

                                   WESLEY
                   Don't think about it, Allea.  Do it.
                   The longer you think about stuff like
                   this, the more reasons you'll make up
                   to avoid it.  And this is the only
                   time you'll have me here to help you.
                   This is the only way you're going to
                   get anything but tokens from the
                   Dulians.

                                   ALLEA
                   Why are you offering all this?  What
                   do you get?

                                   WESLEY
                   Get?  I don't GET anything.  I just
                   don't like to see people... oppressed
                   like this.  It's not right, and if I
                   can help, I will.

                                   ALLEA
                   Maybe you're right.  I just don't
                   know.
                        (beat)
                   Are all the people on the Enterprise
                   so... strong-willed?

                   No.  I guess... I guess I take after
                   my mother.  The captain usually leaves
                   things alone, like the Prime Directive
                   says.

                   But I'm already involved here...  Now

                                    DATA
                   Correct, sir.  Hydrogen intake must be
                   sufficient to propel the vessel, or it
                   cannot power its engines.

                   Helm, take us to the aft end of the

                   But it should prompt Targoff to turn
                   around and talk to us.

                   Nothing yet, sir.

                   There will be.

                                   ALLEA
                   Ura, tell me all you know.

                                    URA
                   They have some kind of ray that's
                   slowing us down.  Allea, if we get
                   below the minimum...

                                   ALLEA
                   I know!
                        (thinks)
                   Has Targoff talked to them since we
                   took Wesley?

                                    URA
                   I don't think so.

                   Well, then, that's why!  They're
                   trying to get Targoff to talk.

                                   ALLEA
                   And if he won't, we're all dead.
                        (decides)
                   We can't let this happen.  All right,
                   Wesley, show us what to do.

                   Commander Targoff, we will not sit
                   idly by while you toy with us.
                   Release my crewman at once.

                   Oh, no.  We'll do far worse than
                   destroy you, Targoff.  We'll strand
                   you, in the middle of space.

                   I see.  Picard, I'm going to be
                   honest.  The reason I haven't called
                   you is... well, you see, your crewman
                   has been kidnapped.

                   There are a few radical Trahns who

                   ignored them before, but now we're
                   looking.

         Picard signals that the transmission should be cut off.

                   Opinions?

                   He is lying.

                   No.  I think he's telling the truth.
                   He really DOESN'T have Wesley.

         EXT.  SPACE -- THE STARSEEKER



         INT.  HIDEOUT

         Wesley, Allea, Ura, and several other Trahn leaders are gathered
         around a table, looking at a map of the area around the
         Starseeker's control room.  Wesley is pointing at some corridors.

                                   WESLEY
                   If we move in here and here, we'll cut
                   them off.

                                    URA
                   There'll be so much confusion, they
                   won't know what's hitting them.

                                   WESLEY
                   Yep.

                                   ALLEA
                   Brilliant.

                                   WESLEY
                   I play strategy games that are a lot
                   like this.

                                   ALLEA
                   Just remember that we're dealing with
                   lives, not markers on a board.  Ura,
                   how soon will we be ready?

                                    URA
                   Very soon.  We're just getting the
                   last of the guns from the guards.

         YANNA, a young Trahn male just barely older than Wesley, bursts
         into the room.  He's carrying Wesley's hand phaser.

                                   YANNA
                   Look what I have!

         Wesley grabs the phaser from Yanna.

                                   WESLEY
                   How'd you get that?

                                   YANNA
                   It was in one of the councilmen's
                   cabins.  I found it while I was

                                  YANNA (Cont'd)
                   cleaning.

         Allea dismisses Yanna, and he leaves.

                                    URA
                   The fool!  They'll have noticed that.
                   They probably even know we're about to
                   strike.

                                   ALLEA
                   Then we have to do it now.

                                    URA
                   But we're not fully armed...

                                   ALLEA
                   We won't get another chance, Ura.  Not
                   if they figure this out.  Wesley, do
                   you agree?

                                   WESLEY
                   I think so.  And I know I'd rather
                   have this phaser on our side than
                   theirs.

                                    URA
                   I still say we should wait.

                                   ALLEA
                   But I am in command.  We strike now.

         Allea gets up and walks out the door.  Wesley follows her.  After
         a moment, and not happily, Ura leaves as well.


         INT.  STARSEEKER -- CORRIDOR

         This is a T intersection of two large corridors.  We see ARMED
         TRAHNS at both corners -- Wesley, Ura, and Allea are next to each
         other on the near side.  The camera moves to reveal that the side
         passage is occupied by Targoff's Dulian BODYGUARDS.  They are
         standing on the near side of an octagonal doorway, which is open.
         They are obviously ready for an attack -- their weapons are
         raised.  In the background, we hear gunfire -- the revolution is
         happening.

                                   ALLEA
                        (quietly, to Ura)
                   This is it.  Once we're past this
                   door, we have them.  Are we ready?

         Ura nods.

         Allea motions with her hand, and the Trahns pour into the side








         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT FIVE     14.


         passage, guns blazing.  The Dulians react quickly, leaping to
         cover on the other side of the doorway (crouching behind the
         corners of the octagon.)  One of them is hit by a Trahn as he
         tries to take cover.  The Dulians fire back, scoring lots of hits
         -- the Trahns have no cover.  But they keep coming.  One of the
         Dulians gets up and opens an access box, inside which are door
         controls.  He's shot down.  The Trahns are almost at the door as
         his partner hurriedly finishes the job...

         The door, a thick metal bulkhead, slams shut.  The Trahns stop.
         Ura, Wesley, and Allea come around the corner to the head of the
         crowd and look at the door.

                                    URA
                   I told you this would happen.  They'll
                   seal all the entrances now, and we'll
                   be stuck out here without any food...

                                   WESLEY
                   Will you be quiet?  I'm not done yet.

         Wesley goes to the access box on this side of the bulkhead.  It's
         sealed shut, as he finds when he tries to open it.

                                    URA
                   You can't unlock it.
                        (looks at his gun)
                   And it's too tough to shoot open.

                                   WESLEY
                   No it isn't.  Stand back.

         The Trahns nearest the box comply as Wesley takes out the phaser
         and blasts a hole in the front cover.  Inside, we see that the
         controls have been blasted apart as well, revealing wires
         underneath.

                                    URA
                   You melted the controls!

                                   ALLEA
                   Let him work.

         Wesley rips out some of the wiring.  He tries putting two of the
         wires together.  There's a spark, but nothing happens.  He tries
         another two; they work, and the door opens.

         There are several Dulian guards waiting inside.  Wesley ducks
         behind the corner of the doorway as the firing starts.  We hear
         gunplay, but we just see Wesley, crouched behind the doorway.  He
         would much rather be at a computer console than in the middle of
         a firefight...

         Then, abruptly, all the firing stops.  Wesley looks up and sees
         that the Trahns have won, though they've taken pretty heavy








         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT FIVE     15.


         losses.

                                   ALLEA
                   Inside!  Move!

         The Trahns rush in.  Wesley catches up with Allea.

                                   ALLEA
                   Those were Targoff's bodyguards.  He
                   wouldn't send them unless there was
                   nobody else left.
                        (a hint of glee)
                   We have them...


         INT.  STARSEEKER -- CONTROL ROOM

         Computer consoles line the walls of this room.  There's a large
         viewscreen across from the main entrance; the Enterprise fills
         the screen.  Targoff is standing at one of the consoles, his
         finger pressed down on one of the buttons.  Some other Dulians
         are watching him.

         A hole appears in the door, and rapidly grows larger.  We see
         that Wesley is disintegrating it with his phaser.

         Allea, Wesley, Ura, and some other Trahns rush in.  They point
         their guns at the Dulians, who step away from the controls and
         raise their hands into the air.

                                   ALLEA
                   Targoff, get away from those controls.
                   You know we've beaten you.

                                  TARGOFF
                        (smiling)
                   Except... I've entered an overload
                   program into the engine control
                   systems.  If I release this button
                   without entering the cancellation
                   command, in ten minutes the engines
                   will explode and take you with them.

         Allea isn't happy about this.

                                  TARGOFF
                        (the smile turns into a
                        grin)
                   Now.  Put down your weapons, or I'll
                   kill you.

         Allea starts to indicate that her people should comply, but
         Wesley stops her.










         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT FIVE     16.


                                   WESLEY
                   Ura, you know these controls, right?

                                    URA
                   Yes, most of them.  He's telling the
                   truth.

                                   WESLEY
                   I don't care.  Where's the
                   communications station?

         Ura points it out.  Wes walks over to the station.  From behind
         his back, we see him pressing some buttons.

                                   WESLEY
                   Crusher to Riker.


         INT.  BRIDGE

         Picard looks at Riker in surprise.  Geordi is at his station.

                                   RIKER
                   Riker here.  What's going on over
                   there?

                                WESLEY (VO)
                        (filtered)
                   Targoff is threatening to overload the
                   engines and blow up the Starseeker.
                   If you don't hear from me in seven
                   minutes, slow the Starseeker down
                   until its engines shut off.

         Riker and Picard exchange a look -- why is Wesley giving an
         ORDER?  After a moment, Picard nods.

                                   RIKER
                   Seven minutes.  All right.

                                WESLEY (VO)

                   Captain, even if we shut off the
                   engines, they'll still have enough
                   power in their batteries to vaporize
                   themselves...

                                   RIKER
                   I'm sure he knows that.  Looks like
                   the poker lessons are paying off.

         INT.  CONTROL ROOM

         Targoff is still hovering over the button.  Wesley turns away
         from the communication station.  He walks to a chair and sits
         down.  He faces Targoff.

                                   WESLEY
                   Okay, let's do it.  I want to see you
                   overload an engine that doesn't have
                   any power.
                        (smiles)

         Targoff's resolve wavers.  He stares at the Enterprise on the
         viewscreen.  Abruptly, he jerks his hand back from the button.
         An alarm sounds until he angrily hits a quick sequence of buttons
         at another console; then the control room is silent.

                                  TARGOFF
                   All right.  You win.

         A couple of Trahns step forward and take Targoff's arms.  They
         bring him over to Allea.

                                   ALLEA
                   Targoff.  You don't know how often
                   I've wanted to put a gun to your head.

                                  TARGOFF
                   We should have brought enough drugs
                   for all of you.  You won't find us
                   easy to rule, Trahn.

                                   ALLEA
                        (coldly)
                   You're right.  I won't.

         And with that, Allea lifts her gun and shoots Targoff.

                                   ALLEA
                   That's for the curfews.

                                   WESLEY
                        (standing)
                   Allea!  Stop!  You can't do this...

                                   ALLEA
                   Take him.
                        (to the other Dulians)
                   All you.  Over by that wall.  NOW!

         They comply.  A couple of Trahn guards take Wesley's arms.  One
         of them confiscates his phaser.











         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT FIVE     18.


                                   ALLEA
                   Get him off this ship.  We're done
                   with him.

         The guards lead Wesley through the blasted doorway.  Wesley
         shouts back to Allea as he's taken away.

                                   WESLEY
                   I thought you were better than this.
                   You're just as bad as they are!

         There's no sound for several seconds.  Then we hear several guns
         being fired inside the control room, and some bodies falling to
         the floor.


         FADE TO:


         INT.  CRUSHER QUARTERS

         The lights are off.  Wesley is sitting by a window, watching the
         stars go past.  He is obviously in a sour mood.  Then the comm
         system beeps.

                                GEORDI (VO)
                        (filtered)
                   Wes, there's a comm channel open for
                   you.

                                   WESLEY
                   Tell 'em to leave a message with the
                   computer.

                                GEORDI (VO)
                        (filtered)
                        (beat)
                   It's Sonri.

         Wes takes a deep breath, then gets up.

                                   WESLEY
                   Okay, I'll take it in here.

         He goes over to a desk, on which is a viewscreen, and hits a
         button on the viewer control panel.  Sonri's face appears.  In
         the background, we see that she's in her dorm room, at the
         computer.

                                   SONRI
                        (somber)
                   Hi, Wes.  Geordi told me what
                   happened.  Are you all right?










         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT FIVE     19.


                                   WESLEY
                        (shaking his head slowly)
                   I don't know...
                        (beat)
                   Why, Sonri?  Why does stuff like this
                   happen?  I was trying to help.  I
                   thought I was setting them free.

                                   SONRI
                   I can't tell you anything you haven't
                   heard a hundred times since you got
                   back.

                                   WESLEY
                   I know.  The Prime Directive.  It's
                   just... Well, I really thought this
                   was different.

                                   SONRI
                   So what happens now?

                                   WESLEY
                   Well, Starfleet's sending a ship to
                   tow the Starseeker to an empty planet,
                   so they can colonize it.  They're
                   going to establish diplomatic...

                                   SONRI
                   I mean to you.

                                   WESLEY
                        (nods -- he knew that)
                   They're putting together a board of
                   inquiry.  I have to report to Starbase
                   Sixteen in three days.  Commander
                   Riker thinks they'll go easy on me,
                   since this sort of thing has happened
                   before, but I'm not sure.

                                   SONRI
                   What do you think they'll do?

                                   WESLEY
                   I don't think they'll put me away or
                   anything.  Maybe they'll send me to
                   the Academy for a while, to train me
                   for stuff like this.
                        (sighs)
                   But if this is the sort of thing I'm
                   going to have to live with, I'm not
                   sure I want to be in Starfleet.

                                   SONRI
                   You won't do anything like this again.
                   It's over.








         Steven Grimm / "Reins Of Power" - Rev. 6/10/90 - ACT FIVE     20.


                                   WESLEY
                   Well, yeah, but...

                                   SONRI
                   No.  I know you, Wes.  You've wanted
                   to be a Starfleet officer for as long
                   as I can remember.  All the good
                   things you've told me about it are
                   still true...

                                   WESLEY
                   Yeah.  I guess so.

                                   SONRI
                   Anyway, I have some good news for you.
                   I talked to Doctor Sontok for about
                   four hours after his lecture.

         Wesley perks up.

                                   WESLEY
                   Really?

                                   SONRI
                   Wes, he was very impressed with our
                   field inversion theory.  He even
                   worked on it with me for a little
                   while.  Here, I'll send you what we
                   did...

         She hits some buttons on her console.  The word "Receiving"
         appears at the bottom of Wesley's screen as Sonri talks, then
         goes away.

                                   SONRI
                   Anyway, take a look at that and tell
                   me what you think.

                                   WESLEY
                   Okay!  I'll look at it.
                        (serious again)
                   Sonri, thanks.  I'm glad I have
                   someone to talk to.

                                   SONRI
                   Me too, Wes.  I'm glad someone out
                   there trusts me enough to talk about
                   stuff like this.  It's so hard to find
                   someone I feel comfortable with.
                        (kidding)
                   Even if you are an alien...

                                   WESLEY
                   Hey, I'm with Starfleet.  That's never
                   stopped us before.

                        (raises her eyebrows)
                   I know.

         Wesley grins.
