Audio Problems?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During the fourth and fifth season  episodes, if your station broadcasts  TNG
in stereo, yet, sometimes during the broadcast, the audio seems to  disappear
during the broadcast for a couple of seconds or seems to be coming out of the
wrong channels, then you have  a problem which can  only be corrected at  the
broadcast station.  Call  up your  local  station  and talk  with  the  chief
engineer. Tell him (or her) that Star Trek: The Next Generation, starting  in
the fourth season, has Dolby Surround as part of the stereo audio. This Dolby
Surround information is confusing the  "audio anti-phase detector", and  that
the detector should be removed to  avoid future problems with the TNG  audio.
Then, thank the Chief Engineer for his time.

Stardates
~~~~~~~~~
After the random stardates  in the original "Star  Trek", the powers that  be
decided on a more  logical way to determine  a stardate. Thus, the  following
came about.

EXAMPLE: "Captains Log: Stardate 45076.3"

The "4" represents that the series takes place in the 24th century.
The "5" represents the season number of TNG without exception.
The "076" represents the portion of a season that advances during TNG.
The ".3" represents a portion of a day thereof.

During the pre-recorded sub-space messages  and recorded logs of away  teams,
both the current stardate and the  current time (in 24-hour military  format,
down to the second). They  are recording on the  bottom of the screen.  ("The
Defector", "Identity Crisis")

Working Titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Time To The Second" -> "Time Squared"
"Send In The Clones" -> "Up The Long Ladder"
"Beyond Tomorrow" -> "Legacy"
"When Honor is Lost" -> "Reunion"
"Civil Wars" -> "Half A Life"
"Barriers" -> "New Ground"
"Terror In Ten-Forward" -> "Power Play"

What is canon?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
According to  various sources,  this  is what  is considered  acceptable,  or
canon, for potential TNG episodes:
* Almost all of the original series (except for obvious conflicts)
* All of Star Trek: The Motion Picture
* Most of Star Trek II, III, IV, and VI
* All of the TNG episodes
* "TNG Technical Manual" by Mike Okuda and Rick Sternbach

The following is not acceptable:
* Star Trek (The Animated Series)
* Star Trek V: The Final Frontier
* All Star Trek Novels (yes, even the ones Gene Roddenberry wrote)
* All fanzines and fan written material
* Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise
* Worlds Of The Federation
* All FASA Material

Ranks and Insignia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Admiral -  Triangular  shoulder board  with  gold braid  enclosing  six  gold
circles of varying size.

Rear Admiral -  The same  as an  admiral, except  with five  gold circles  of
varying size.

Branch Admiral - A color-coded triangle with the apex facing inward set on  a
white shoulder board  surrounded by  silver oak leaves.  The triangle  colors
are:

    Medical Corps and Sciences - Navy Blue
      Security and Engineering - Mustard Yellow
        Command and Navigation - Wine Red

Fleet Captain - Five solid gold circles
Captain - Four solid gold circles
Commander - three solid gold circles
Lieutenant Commander - two solid gold circles and one empty gold circle
Lieutenant - two solid gold circles
Lieutenant (Junior Grade) - One solid gold circle and one empty
Ensign - One solid gold circle
Ensign (Junior Grade) - One empty gold circle
Midshipman - One gold starburst worn on the right uniform lapel.

NOTE: During seasons one or two, some of the pips were in silver.

According to  Gene Roddenberry,  there are  no enlisted  ranks in  Starfleet.
However, in  "Family", Sergei  Sarjenka  (Worf's Father)  mentions  something
about meeting another  Chief Petty Officer.  Later on, in  the same  episode,
Sargei mentions that he, an enlisted man, managed to raise an officer.  Also,
in "The Drumhead", the part-Romulan  part-Human medical technician said  that
he was anxious to get into space, so  he did to become an enlisted man.  This
will indeed contradict what Gene has said.

In "Future Imperfect", some  of the ranks  in effect 15  years from season  4
are:

Admiral - Four Gold Bars
Captain - Four Silver Bars

The other ranks are  based upon the  "normal" TNG ranks.  They are formed  by
substituting a bar for a solid circle  and a narrow bar for an empty  circle.
The rank is part of the insignia/communicator.

Picard Surrenders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Encounter at  Farpoint"  -  Picard  says  "Transmit  the  following  in  all
languages and in all frequencies: 'We surrender'."

"The Last Outpost" - The crew assume that the Ferengi have them  immobilized,
and attempt to surrender, but the Ferengi surrender first, believing that the
Enterprise have them immobilized.

"The Outrageous Okona" - Picard drops shields "In case we decide to surrender
to them."

"A Matter of Honor" - Picard surrenders to Riker on the Pagh.

"Peak Performance" -  Riker asks Picard  "Would you care  to surrender  now?"
even before the war games begin. Later,  the Ferengi drop by, and demand  the
surrender of the Hathaway.

"The Defector" - The Romulans ask Picard to surrender, but he doesn't.

"Yesterday's Enterprise"  -  Alternate-Picard  refuses to  surrender  to  the
Klingons.

Picard violates the Prime Directive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In "The Drumhead", it  is recorded that Picard  violated the Prime  Directive
nine times while  in command  of the Enterprise.  While it  was not  directly
specified what the nine violations were, this  is what is believed to be  the
Episodes which contained these violations:

"Justice" - In order to save Wesley from the death penalty for (accidentally)
violating one of the Edo laws.

"Angel One" - The crew barely managed  to save the survivors of a  Federation
ship from death for trying to change the society of Angel One.

"Pen  Pals"  -  Data  communicates  with  a  girl  whose  planet  was  slowly
self-destructing.

"Up the Long Ladder" - Picard essentially  forced the clone race to live  and
breed with the Bringloidi,  despite the strong resistance  of the clone  race
and the fact that this would completely destroy the non-sexual nature of  the
clone race.

"The Ensigns of Command" - The  Enterprise manages to delay a Sheliak  vessel
from destroying a Federation colony on Tau Cygna Five, even though the planet
is part of the Sheliak Corporate.

"Who Watches the  Watchers" -  The Enterprise  treats a  Mintakan person  for
serious injuries as a  result of a  Federation observation's post's  cloaking
device's failure, ending with that race believing Picard was a God.

"The High Ground" -  The Enterprise engages  in a commando  raid in order  to
rescue Captain Picard and Beverly Crusher on a warring world.

"Legacy" - The  commando raid  might have  radically changed  the balance  of
power on the planet.

"First Contact"  -  The Enterprise  contacts  a  planet in  order  to  rescue
Commander Riker.

Since then, the following violations occurred:

"The Masterpiece Society"  - When the  Enterprise is forced  to make  contact
with a colony on ???????? in order to prevent them from being distroyed by  a
stellar fragment that is passing by, and causes changes in that colony.

Command Offered to Commander Riker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"The Arsenal of Freedom" - USS Drake (mentioned--offered before Enterprise)
"The Icarus Factor" - USS Aries
"Best of Both Worlds" - USS Melbourne

Riker  actually  commands  a  ship,  albiet  temporarily,  in  the  following
episodes:

"A Matter Of Honor" - Klingon Ship Pagh
"Peak Performance" - USS Hathaway
"The Best Of Both Worlds-Part II" - USS Enterprise NCC-1701D
"Redemption II" - ???? during a blockade

Saucer Separation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The TNG Enterprise, being  a starship carrying families,  has the ability  to
separate into  a  saucer and  warp  drive section  in  case of  an  emergency
situation. When  separated, the  saucer section  is capable  of only  impulse
speed, while the warp drive section turns into a formidable battle machine.

"Encounter at Farpoint"  - While Worf  takes the saucer  section to  Farpoint
Station, Picard takes the warp drive section to meet up with the Q entity.

"Arsenal of  Freedom" -  Geordi takes  the  Warp Drive  section in  order  to
destroy the defense device on Minos.

"Best of Both Worlds -  Part II" - In  order to retrieve Locutus/Picard,  the
Enterprise separates into two sections. While the Borg attach the warp  drive
section, the  rescue shuttle  with Worf  and Data  launches from  the  saucer
section.

Shuttlecraft
~~~~~~~~~~~~

TNG:

NCC-1701D-2 - "Sacharov" (used in ?????)

Convention Hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Patrick Stewart - May or may  not allow taping  of convention appearance.  He
                  considers  convention   appearances   to  be   a   personal
                  experience to be shared with those in the audience.
Brent Spiner - He is  very  protective  of  his  privacy,  and  rarely  makes
               convention appearances, partially due to a bad experience with
               a fan at a convention in New York. He does not allow the video
               taping or the photographing of convention appearances.
Gates McFadden - Do not videotape convention appearance.
Wil Wheaton - He doesn't allow videotaping. The explanation for this was that
              someone had taped him before  and sold these tapes without  his
              consent or paying him.
Michael Dorn - "I don't LIKE prune juice, Worf likes prune juice, I don't."
Marina Sirtis - While she  does  allow  for  videotaping  of  her  convention
                appearances, she  reminds  everyone  that  videotaping  is  a
                privilege, and not  a right.  No flash  photography when  Q&A
                starts. Also,  she  has no  idea  about how  the  pips  work,
                nothing about Engineering,  why Worf  changed uniform  color,
                and similar topics.

Please remember, these  actors are  taking their  personal time  in order  to
appear at  conventions. Some  of these  actors do  not give  out  autographs,
others  do.  The  "no  videotaping"  rule  is  due  to  the  fact  that  some
unscrupulous people taping  the convention  appearances and  then resell  the
tapes without royalties going to the actor.

The Merry Men (and Women) of Qpid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Picard -> Robin Hood
Riker -> Little John
Data -> Friar Tuck
Worf -> Wil Scarlet. Is not a merry man.
Laforge -> Alan A Dale
Vash -> Maid Marian
Q -> The Sheriff of Nottingham

(NOTE: I have not read or seen  "Robin Hood", so some of those spellings  are
bound to be wrong.)

Money In The Future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Encounter At Farpoint" - Beverly Crusher buys  a roll of cloth, and has  her
account on the Enterprise billed.

(maybe) "Conspiracy"  -  The  planet  where the  Starship  Captains  meet  is
Digitalis B, and is said to  be owned by Digitalis Mining Corporation,  which
may imply something of the Federation's economic structure.

"The Neutral Zone" - Picard mentions that they no longer use money.

"The Price" - There is a bidding war going on for the use of a wormhole,  and
Picard mentions how much toll the Ferengi might charge if they get the rights
to use that wormhole.

"A Matter Of  Perspective" - Dr.  Apgar's reason for  developing the  Krieger
wave generator was to sell it to the highest bidder.

"Unification II" - When Riker enters the bar, he is asked to toss a couple of
coins into the jar for a song. Riker responds that he doesn't have any money.

Religion In The Future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Who Watches The Watchers" - Picard is thought to be a god by the populance.

"Data's Day" - In Data's log, a Hindu festival of lights is mentioned.

Did you know . . .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. . . That Geordi  LaForge is named after a  real Star Trek fan named  George
LaForge? George LaForge died from muscular dystrophy in 1975.

. . . That Gene Roddenberry's  full name is Eugene Wesley Roddenberry,  thus,
in creating  Wesley Crusher,  Gene used  his  own first  name and  based  the
character on what he wanted to be like when he was young?>

. . . Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) did the special effect shots only  for
"Encounter At Farpoint". However, they get credit in every episode because of
the extra stock footage for Enterprise fly-bys and such.

. . . That William Riker and Deanna  Troi is based upon Ilia and Decker  from
"Star Trek: The Motion Picture"?

. .  . That  while "Skin  of Evil"  was aired  after "Symbiosis",  they  were
produced in the reverse order. Near  the end of Symbiosis, when the  Onnarans
and Brekkans beam off, she is seen  in the background, waving goodbye as  the
doors close. (UV)

. . . That  "Star Trek: The  Next Generation" has  made over $500,000,000  in
syndication and merchandising.

. . . If you look closely at the Enterprise during the fly-by in the  opening
credits, you can  see someone  walking past  the windows.  According to  Mike
Okuda in  the "Star  Trek: The  Official Fan  Club Magazine"  (#60), this  is
Captain Picard.

. . . "The Child" and "Devil's Due" were originally scripts for the  proposed
"Star Trek  II"  television  series.  The "Star  Trek  II"  series  idea  was
scrapped, and instead, the sets were used for the shooting of "Star Trek: The
Motion Picture"

. . . The junkyard in "Unification  I" consisted mostly of ships dragged  out
from wherever Mike Okuda could find 'em. Some of the models included:  models
from the unmade  first Star Trek  movie (years before  Star Trek: The  Motion
Picture), models from ILM that were never used, models of the Enterprise that
didn't come out  of the mold  right, and a  very unusual looking  Enterprise.
Some of the models were designed by Greg Jein and Robert McCall.

. . . "A Matter Of Time" was written partially because Robin Williams, a  fan
of the  show,  wanted to  appear.  However, when  the  script was  ready  for
shooting, Robin was unavailable, so Matt Frewer was cast instead.

. . . That the shuttle Onizuka, which Data used in "Ensigns of Command",  was
named in tribute to one of the Space Shuttle "Challenger" astronauts.

. . . During the fifth season, a thirty-second ad during one of the show's 10
national ad slots in a first-run episode costs $200,000.

. . . Gene died at the same time the crew was filming "Hero Worship"?

. . . That "Star Trek: The Next  Generation" is on the list of shows  endored
by the  Viewers  for Quality  Television.  Other VQT  endored  shows  include
"Cheers", "Designing  Women",  "LA  Law", "Life  Goes  On",  "Murphy  Brown",
"Northern Exposure", "The Trials Of  Rosie O'Neill", "Law & Order",  "Quantum
Leap", "60 Minutes",  "China Beach", "thirtysomething",  and "Beauty and  the
Beast".
(The VQT  should  not  be  confused with  the  American  Viewers  of  Quality
Television. The VQT seeks to  change television by encouraging and  nurturing
high quality  television,  while  the  AVQT seeks  to  change  television  by

In-Jokes
~~~~~~~~
"Unknown" - In this episode, Doctor Crusher prescribes the active  ingredient
fo SuperGlue.

"Unknown" - In this episode, Daled 4 is a planet's name. Daled is the  fourth
letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and has the numeric value of four. (UV)

"The Naked Now"  - During  the scan  of records, we  see a  parrot wearing  a
Starfleet shirt, complete with insignia, with nacelles, an obvious  reference
to Gene  Roddenberry.  ("The  Great  Bird" =  Gene)  This  same  screen  also
reappears in "Conspiracy".

"Conspiracy" - The planet Digitalis is  a slight rearrangement of a  medicine
takn by heart patients.

"The Neutral Zone" - On the family  tree of Clare Raymond, which is  recalled
by Troi, there are references to various shows, including: W. Hartnell m.  P.
Troughton (DW), J. Pertwee m. T. Baker (DW), and P. Davison m. C. Baker (DW),
and J-L. Picard m. W. Riker.  Other references include Gilligan's Island  and
M*A*S*H.

"Loud As A Whisper" - (DP) The conference table, "made to resemble indigenous
rock", had various markings on them. Most notable to Lovely Angels/Dirty Pair
fans are the marking "Kei" and "Yuri".

"The Measure Of  A Man" -  When Riker is  showing off Data's  arm to the  JAG
representative, there  is  a  pad  on her  desk  which  lists  Data's  parts,
including "Nausican Valve" and   "Totoro Interface". Also,  it is noted  that
part of Data's construction is made out of something called "Yurium". (DP)

"The Dauphin" - The  title comes from  the french term  "Le Dauphin", and  is
used to designate the heir to the royal throne.

"Contagion" - The Iconian artifact has various markings on it, including "Kei
and Yuri" (DP), "Dirty Pair" (DP),  "Gundam" and "Totoro." Also, the  various
views as seen  through the  portal include:  Toronto's City  Hall and  Nathan
Phillip's Square  (depicting  the  arches over  the  reflecting  pool/skating
rink), and Toronto's City Council Chambers.
    In this  episode, another  Galaxy Class Starship  is mentioned.  . .  the
Yamato. This was originally the flagship of the Japanese fleet that fought in
World War II at both the Coral Sea  and Midway before it was sunk by  Torpedo
Bombers from  an American  carrier. Many  years later,  a Japanese  Animation
series was  done  up, in  which  a battleship  is  reconfigured to  become  a
starship in order to  recover something called the  "Cosmo DNA". This  series
was called "Starship Yamato",  however, this series was  known in the  United
States as "Star Blazers".

"The Icarus Factor"  - The  TNG art  department had  a field  day putting  in
in-jokes. The  mat has  the chinese  character  of "sei",  or "star"  (as  in
"starry sky". The two scrolls hanging on the walls say, in Japanese  syllabic
characters (hiragana), "urusei  yatsura", a pun  of "ususai yatsura"  ("noisy
neighbors" or "annoying neighbors", a Japanese animation.
   Also, while lunging at Riker, Riker's father says (in a terrible  accent),
"youroshiku onegaishimasu", literally saying "Please do me the favor of being
kind to me", but has the meaning of the English phrase "Pleased to meet you."
    Various  other markings  include "Kei"  (DP), "Yuri"  (DP), "Akira",  and
"Tonari No Totoro". In addition, the  scrolls hanging on the walls also  say,
"Ataru", "Lum", and "Uresai Yatsura".

"Samaritan Snare"  -  Picard mentions  "Nausicaans"  in a  conversation  with
Wesley on the shuttlecraft.

"Up The Long Ladder" - When Picard is looking at the list of ships trying  to
find the Mariposa, another  ship listed is the  Buckaroo Banzai captained  by
John Whorfin and built by  the company that the  red Lectroids had made.  The
same company name was seen on  the USS Hathaway (Yoyodyne Propulsion  Systems
(of Grover's Mill, NJ :-) )

"Hollow Pursuits" -  The anti-grav  units contain a  flux capacitor.  Nothing
big, until you consider that the flux  capacitor was a essential part of  the
DeLorean/Time Machine in "Back To The Future".

"Menage a Troi" - The Ferengi Security code begins with "Kei Yuri" (DP).

"Transfigurations" - (DW)  In the  sick bay, against  the wall,  there is  an
outline of the top portion of  the TARDIS, upside down. Also, three  roundals
can be seen against the  wall. They show up  again in several episodes  after
this one.

"Qpid" - The  scene where Worf  smashes Geordi's lute,  then says "Sorry"  is
completely reminiscent of  a scene  in Animal House  at a  toga party.  Also,
Princess Bride fans might want to note that the dialog during the sword fight
with Picard/Robin Hood, where he says "There is something you should know . .
. . I'm not from Nottingham.", is  reminiscent of a sword fight in the  movie
where similar dialog is uttered.

"In Theory" -  The line  "Now would  be a good  time", spoken  by Picard,  is
completely reminiscent from Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Also, while it may
not be visible in the actual show, someone on the production crew  re-labeled
the shuttle pod "PONTIAC NC-1701-D".

"Darmok" - The writers  were playing around with  the words in this  episode,
with DARMOK,  the letters  reversed, becomes  KOMRAD (comrade).  JILARD  also
becomes JLpIcARD.
   Also, Gilgamesh is based  upon Gigamesh (from Sumerian lore), a  character
described as a combination of  Solomanm, Ulysses, and Hercules combined  into
one. One of  the important factor's  after his friend's  death is  Gigamesh's
fear of death,  although never  playing a factor  in battle,  results in  his
constant search for immortality,  but, in one manner  or another, comes  very
close, but always manages to miss.

"The Outcast" - Among  the technical phrases used,  "Reverse the polarity  of
the neutron  flow"  was a  phrase  commonly used  by  the third  doctor  (Jon
Pertwee) during Doctor Who. (UV)

Doctor Who (DW): A cult British Science Fiction series which ran on BBC1 from
1963 to 1989. The title character is known only as "The Doctor", a time  lord
who travels through time and space in a TARDIS (Time And Relative  Dimensions
In Space). The TARDIS is  bigger on the inside than  on the outside, and  can
change outward appearance, however, the Doctor's TARDIS, being a broken  down
Type-40, is stuck in the  shape of blue British  Police Call Box. The  Doctor
himself can, at point of death, regenerate into a totally different body  and
personality. The series can be  seen on several PBS  stations and the (to  be
launched in late 1991) Sci-Fi Channel.

Lovely Angels/Dirty Pair  (DP): A Japanese  anime series where  the two  main
characters, "Kei" and "Yuri", are members of World Welfare Foundation.  Their
job is to take care of problems that crop up. However, they usually leave the
place in worse shape then they arrived, and it's usually not their fault. The
series itself has had TOS in-jokes in it also.

Differences in "Encounter At Farpoint"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, "Encounter At Farpoint"  is being distributed  in both a  two-part
form and a two-hour  movie form. The  two-hour movie was  shown as the  first
episode of TNG, the  repeat was shown as  a two-part episode. Currently,  the
stations that are showing TNG as  a daily syndicated program have  "Encounter
At Farpoint" as a two-part episode.

Unfortunately, the two-part episode is  heavily butchered. Among the  changes
from the two-hour movie version:

* The movie version starts  out with the credits,  the two-parter starts  out
  with a teaser instead.
* In the  movie version,  Riker sees  what happens  in two  sections. In  the
  two-parter, the second section is cut out.
* The two-parter had the rejoining of the saucer section with the warp  drive
  section being majorly edited.
* A section where Picard is talking to Dr. Crusher about Wesley is cut.
* A scene where Geordi talks to Dr. Crusher about his VISOR was moved to part
  two. It appeared in the first half of the movie version.
* Some of the audio was changed, and somewhat "sweetened" (Mike Brown  term),
  in the two-part version.

To add additional  confusion, Paramount has  officially retired the  two-hour
movie, and  has made  available for  the videotape  and laserdisc  series  an
unbutchered two-part episode of "Encounter At Farpoint."

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Opening Credits  (1st  & 2nd  Season)  -  During the  opening  sequence,  the
graphics are a departure  from the Sol system,  beginning with Eath with  the
sun in the background,  and featuring fly-bys of  Jupiter and Saturn.  During
this sequence, the camera pans right, and  we see sunlight off the left  side
of Earth and Jupiter, but the right side of Saturn, indicating that Saturn is
backlit. (UV)

"Code Of Honor"  - While on  the planet,  watch Deanna's arms.  In the  group
shots, Deanna's arms are at her sides, while, in the close-ups, her arms  are
behind her back. (UV)

"Datalore" - Upon beaming down to the planet's surface, Commander Riker gives
the stardate as 4124.5. A little later, Captain Picard gives it as  41242.45.
(V)

"Skin Of Evil" - When  Riker is being pulled into  Armus, the away team  runs
towards Armus. However Geordi drops his phaser into Armus. In the next scene,
the away team is standing around calmly,  and Geordi's phaser is back in  his
pocket. (UV)

"Conspiracy" - At the beginning of the episode, while Picard is asleep, Riker
tells LaForge to increase  speed to Warp 6.  Laforge replies, "Aye Sir,  full
impulse." Later on,  in that same  episode, Picard says  "Mr. LaForge,  ahead
warp six." Geordi responds with "Aye, sir, full impulse." (UV)

"The Enemy" - Picard says  to Tomaluk that he  will be escorting the  Romulan
ship to the Neutral Zone.  Yet, in the closing  shot, the Enterprise and  the
Romulan Ship take off in two different directions. (V)

"The Royale" - The  surface temperature of the  planet is less than  absolute
zero. Also, after they beam the piece  of the ship out of orbit, O'Brien  and
Riker pick it up  with their bare  hands (coming from  space, it should  have
been close to zero Kelvin itself).  Plus, after beaming down, they then  scan
the atmosphere to see if it's safe to breathe. (V)

"Loud As A Whisper" - Data has learned sign language and is now  interpreting
what the mediator is saying. Data  quotes the mediator as saying "My  friends
have died" or something like that, before it is even signed. (V)

"Yesterdays Enterprise"  - At  the  end of  the  episode, Geordi  talks  with
Guinan. However, he is wearing an open neck uniform. (V)

"Sins of the Father" - The sound effects people must have fallen asleep every
time someone got slapped. (V)

"Sarek" - The music recital in this episode contained several errors.  First,
the quartet seating is towards the audience, not toward each other. Classical
music was originally developed with the performers facing each other in order
to get visual  cues. The performing  in front  of the audience  did not  come
about until  much  later.Second,  the  Allegro is  by  Brahm's,  not  Mozart.
Thirdly, the Allegro is sextet, not a quartet. (UV)

"The Best Of Both Worlds" - In the  scene where the away team is on the  Borg
ship, Beverly notices Picard/Locutus behind six Borg soldiers. Yet, when Worf
rushes to rescue Picard, the soldier have disappeared. (V)

"Brothers" - The code which Data gives to lock the Enterprise computer system
differs between the spoken version and  the version displayed on the  screen.
(See "Security Codes") (V)

"Remember Me" - In the final act,  when Wesley and the Traveler are  entering
the equations into the computer, watch Wesley's hand. He closes his eyes, and
then places his hand  on the case,  about three inches  below the entry  pad.
While he is making his  entries, his hand starts  moving up, while the  sound
effect people keep making the sounds in time. (V)

"Legacy" - During the  card trick with Data,  Riker's hand keeps on  changing
position during the trick when the camera switches. (UV)

"Reunion" - After K'Eyhlar dies, Alexander the child runs away, and Worf lets
out his primal scream, we see her body being lowered to the floor. As she  is
finally settled,  her  eyes  flutter  open  and  closed  several  times  (as,
presumably, the actress,  Suzie Plakson,  "gets her  bearings"). Also  notice
that her head is  facing towards her  left. However, when  her body is  shown
full-on from the perspective of her feet (as Worf tells Alexander to "look at
death, and never forget"), her head  is facing slightly towards her  *RIGHT*,
and remains that way for  the rest of the scene  (a prime example of a  scene
being shot in several takes). (V) Also,  Dr. Crusher and her aide comes  from
the bedroom, not from the corridor. (UV)

"The Drumhead" - After the first  hearing with J'Ddan, Worf and J'Ddan  leave
the hearing room. The doors open, as they are walking though the doorway, the

doors start to close, but  hesitate, open back up  and then close after  they
leave the doorway. Looks like someone pulled on the rope too soon :-) (V)
   Also,  Satie says that  Captain Picard took command  of the Enterprise  at
Stardate 41162. This is in error . . . it was 41152. (V)

"Half A Life" - Near  the end of the episode,  when Lwaxana Troi is  standing
next to the mirror and then begins to walk away from it, for a brief  instant
the boom from the mic is visible in the reflection. (V)

"In Theory" - In the teaser, Data finishes telling Jenna the reasons why  she
broke up with Jeff. She  and Data then close up  the photon torpedo, and  she
moves off to a control panel. On top of the torpedo rests a black, hand-sided
deviceamajig. Data stands up, holding some sensormajig in his left hand.  The
scene then shifts to Data walking  towards Jenna, and the sensormajig is  now
in his RIGHT hand  (with no indication  that he ever  shifted it there),  and
Jenna is holding the  deviceamajig she left  on top of  the torpedo (with  no
indication that she ever went back to get it). (V)

"Redemption II" -  In part  one of  this story, Worf  said that  he would  be
serving on the Bortas.  Yet, in this  episode, he is  serving on the  Hectar,
with no explaination about the transfer.
   Also, Picard says to Guinan  that Yar died a year prior to Guinan  joining
the crew. However, "Skin of Evil" was the fourth to last story of the season,
and Guinan is first seen in the second season premere "The Child", suggesting
only 3-4 months between the two stories.
   Picard refers to the battle  on Narendra III as taking place 24 years  ago
to Sela, and 23 years ago to Guinan. (V)

"Ensign Ro" - When Ensign Ro takes off her jacket, her communicator is on her
jacket.  However,  when  she  hands  the  jacket  to  the  little  girl,  her
communicator jumps to her uniform, with no action of putting the communicator
there. (V)

"Silicon Avatar" - In the second act, look closely at the tricorder that  Dr.
Marr holds during  the conversation  between Dr.  Marr and  Data. During  the
conversation, she has her  tricorder open. She then  closes it, then  reopens
it, but holds the tricorder UPSIDE DOWN!!!! (V)

"Disaster" - In the scene where Dr. Crusher and Geordi are evacuating all the
air out of the cargo bay, Geordi  hits the button that closes the cargo  bay.
The pushing of the button and resulting door closing are audibly heard,  even
though sound doesn't travel  in a vacuum.  (Probably dramatic reasons)  Also,
when the ship starts shaking,  they cut to ten  forward, where the stars  are
shaking right along with the ship. (V)

"The Game" - When the crew are forcing  Wesley to play the game, and ????  is
holding his eyes open, Wesley blinks. (V)

"Unification I" - When  Dr. Crusher is  examining Data in  order to prep  him
(and Picard) to  Romulas, she asks  if Data's ears  are detachable, to  which
Data says that  they are not.  Yet, in "Datalore",  Data's brother, Lore,  is
clearly shown without ears. A design change?

"Unification II" - After Spock, Picard, and Data have knocked out the Romulan
guards, and Spock has Sela at gunpoint, Picard has no gun in his hand.  After
a camera switch, Picard then holds a Romulan phaser "pistol". A minute later,
after a  scene with  the Enterprise,  Picard is  still standing  in the  same
place, but with a Romulan phaser "rifle". (UV)
   After Data gives Sela the famous "Spock Pinch", and when Picard, Data, and
Spock leave the room, look at the glass pyramid in Sela's office. There is  a
reflection of a cameraman chewing gum. (V)

"New Ground" - Alexander  states that he was  born on stardate 42305.  Unless
the equivelent  of 01000  stardate equals  aproximately one  year,  Alexander
would be only 2 and  a half years old. Also,  the creature which Riker  saves
from the lab is obviously a hand puppet. (V)

"The Masterpiece Society" -  Geordi states that his  VISOR covered the  range
from 1 Hertz  to 1  Terahertz. While this  covers radio,  microwave, and  far
infrared frequencies, it does not cover near infrared, visible,  ultraviolet,
x-rays, or gamma rays.

"Conundrum" - When MacDuff is talking to Picard in Picard's ready room,  when
Picard goes to the window, all you see in the in the window is the reflection
of Picard and the room behind him (not the stars outside), then, when you see
MacDuff, in the  reflection, leaving the  room behind Picard,  when the  door
opens, you don't see the reflection of the bridge, you see stars. Oops! (UV)
    After Rikers first  love scene, a  wide-angle-view-pan-to-closeup on  the
bridge can be seen at the very top  of the screen, in the brightly lit  area.
(UV). Shortly afterwards, in the same scene, MacDuff is walking around and up
to the tactical station from his chair, and we can see his legs walk next  to
Worfs. The camera cuts to Worf, and we see MacDuff approaching Worf. (UV)

- Betazoid's and the Ferengi Mind: In "The Battle" and "The Price",  Deanna's
is able to sense  deception from the Ferengi,  and later, used against  them.
Yet, in "Menage A Troi", the Betazoid Ambassador says that they are unable to
read Ferengi minds, a fact later confirmed in "The Loss". Data has  suggested
that this is due to the Ferengi brain separated in four regions.

- In "Reunion," Gowron was prepared to  offer K'Ehleyr a seat on the  Klingon
Council for her assistance in getting Picard to quicken the pace of the  Rite
of Succession. However, in "Redemption," he states to Picard that females are
not allowed to serve on that Council.

Data Using Contractions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In "Datalore", Lore  says that there  are differences between  him and  Data,
among them, the ability  of Lore being able  to use contractions, while  Data
couldn't. Yet, in "The  Offspring", Data says that  he hadn't quite  mastered
contractions. It appears  that Data  can use contractions,  as the  following
shows indicate . . . . .

"Encounter At  Farpoint"  - At  the  beginning of  the  "post  Atomic-horror"
courtroom, when Q  enters, Data  says, "At  least we're  acquainted with  the
judge." (V) Also, when Data is asked by a very familiar "Admiral" if he is  a
Vulcan, Data replies, "I'm an android." (V)

"The Naked Now" - Data says: "Correction, sir.. that's blown out." instead of
"that is".... Also, after Picard orders Yar to the sick bay, Yar asks "Did he
say when?", to which Data replies "I'm sure he meant now." (UV)

"The Last Outpost" - (UV)

"Where No Man Has Gone Before" - After  they shot out of the galaxy and  were
looking at all  the nice  special effects  outside Data  said something  like
"It's beautiful". (UV)

"Datalore" - In the  teaser, in response to  Tasha's query about holding  the
memory of over 411 people, Data  responds, "Actually, I'm quite efficient  in
some basic human  information." Then, in  act one,  on the way  to the  place
where he  was  found, in  response  to  Tasha's query  about  the  colonist's
memories, Data replies, "I've always felt  that it was done hurriedly, but  I
know little more."  Next, in act  two, in a  conversation with Chief  Argyle,
Data says, "I've been most anxious to hear the Chief Engineer's opinion,  Mr.
Argyle." Then, in the final act, after the fight with Lore, Picard asks  Data
if he's  ok, in  which  Data replies,  "Yes Sir,  I'm  fine." This  is  quite
surprising, since  this is  one episode  which they  should have  been  extra
careful about using contractions. (V)

"Heart of Glory" - (UV)

"Elementary, Dear Data"  - When Data  and Geordi are  just about to  confront
Moriarty for  the first  time, Data  notices some  scratches near  Moriarty's
secret entrance and he asks, "What's this?" (UV)

"The Offspring"  - In  the Captain's  quarters, after  Picard answers  Data's
question about Admiral Halftel having children, Data replies, "I'm forced  to
wonder how much experience he had as a parent when his first child was born."
(V)

"Future Imperfect" - The future Data uses a contraction.

"In Theory" - When  entering Jenna's quarters,  Data recites several  phrases
with contractions, including "Honey, I'm Home" and "You don't tell me what to
do! You're not  my mother!"  - a  clear contradiction  of the  no-contraction
rule. However,  he was  running a  program in  which he  was simply  reciting
various phrases couples use, and  he was saying them  in a different tone  of
voice than usual. (V)

                           ST:TNG Technical Manual

The "Star Trek:  The Next  Generation" Technical Manual  (Pocket Books,  ISBN
0-671-70427-3) is the complete technical guide to the Treknology used in TNG.
It is written  by Rick Sternback  and Michael  Okuda, who work  in TNG's  Art
Department. Among their responsibilities include making sure that  everything
is consistant in the  technical department from show  to show. However,  they
have been known to clown around a little, and some of that clowning has shown
up in the technical manual. Such as:

11 - In the saucer section, right above the Captain's Yacht, there is a duck.
A half inch to the left and a little bit down, there is a mouse. Slightly  to
the rigt of the mouse,  there is a "Slippery When  Wet" sign. In the  shuttle
bay, there  is  three  big  shuttles, two  small  shuttles,  and  sports  car
(probably from Pontiac ;). To the right of the duck, about one inch, there is
a B-52 Bomber, and, in that same rectangle, there is a symbol of a woman  and
a child (the  symbol for Canada's  "Family" rating for  movies). Also,  right
under the warp pylons, there is a registered trademark symbol.
   Interestingly enough,  if you look at the  ship diagram in Engineering  on
the show, those exact items show up.

                      Wesley Eugene "Gene" Roddenberry
                     August 19, 1921 - October 24, 1991

He created a legend which continues on today, creating a show that has helped
beleive that there was a future worth living for. He showed us that space  is
not just for space battles, but for learning new ideas and ways of  thinking,
and, indirectly, has done  more for civil rights  and the space program  than
Martin Luther King, Jr. and  John F. Kennedy. Gene  will be missed, but  will
not be forgotten.
