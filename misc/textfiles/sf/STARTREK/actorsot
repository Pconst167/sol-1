This list was originally put together by Otto "Hack-Man" Heuer, but is
now maintained by Dan Styer (styer@mtu.edu).

This posting is intended to cut down on the "often asked questions" that
seem to pop up every few months in this newsgroup regarding the other
roles that the Star Trek actors have had.  Feel free to email me any
additions you know of.  A good source for roles is the Star Trek
Compendium by Allan Asherman.  Also, TNG swaps actors with LA Law
regularly.

The format of each entry in this list is:
   Movie/Show Title  (Year Released)  [Role the person played]

The credits for the actors are divided into seven sub-sections:
   TV Series - When the actor has a regular or recurring role in an ongoing
television series.
   TV Guest Appearances - When the actor has a one-shot role in an ongoing
television series. If the name of the episode is known, it's included in quotes.
   TV Movies/Mini-Series/Specials - For television programs that are not
ongoing. This section has three separate alphabetical lists, one for each
distinction listed in the header.
   Movies - This section is for movies first released in theaters. Movies 
first released on TV or on videotape are listed in their own sections.
   Theatre - This section is for live stage performances done by the actor,
whether in plays, touring comanpies, stand-up comedy, etc.
   Commercials/Videos/Misc. - This is a catch-all section, containing 
commercials, music videos, movies released only on videotape, etc. Also here
are items which for one reason or another were never fully completed. (i.e.
movie unreleased due to legal complications, unsold TV pilots, roles in which
the actor left and the part was recast and refilmed, etc.) These entries are 
marked with an asterisk (*) at the beginning.
   Behind The Scenes - This section is for any writing, directing, producing,
choreography, etc. the actor has done.

   There are a few listings at the end of each actor/actress for which I did
not know which category they fell into. If anyone knows about them, please
let me know.
