Hi,

I know I said I'd post them next year, but what the hell....  I got hold of 
them, so here they are.

After "I, Locutus", I got it into my big head that I should try my hand at a 
script.  Actually, I tried two and this is the first.  The second one, "
Heritage", I shall post later this week.

I can see the flaws in it (eg. the humor seems slightly out of place in an 
episode I was planning to be rather dark an ominous), but I still like the 
basic story line (I wrote it, so that figures!).

But I would still appreciate any comments and criticisms that you manage to 
think up, if you manage to wade through the whole thing that is!!!

Oh, by the way, the title is latin for "Remember to die" - if you can't make 
the story pretensious, I figured they may go for the title!

All the best,
Ryan.

And away we go......


       STAR TREK: "Memento Mori" - REV. 8/7/93 - TEASER

                            TEASER

FADE IN:

1.   EXT. ENTERPRISE AND OTHER SHIP (OPTICAL)               1.

     The Enterprise is stationary, alongside a smaller,
     yet fair-sized vessel of unknown design.

2.   INT. OTHER SHIP.                                       2.

     The interior is dimly lit, filled with large pipes
     and power conduits that stretch overhead and large
     metal containers that crowd the deck.  Between the
     large pipes and metal containers, a metal walk-way
     with a railing runs from the ship's upper level at
     right angles to the above pipes.

     A beam of energy, from a phaser, burns a hole in one
     of the large containers, narrowly missing an
     obviously-frightened humanoid, who continues to run
     away between the vast containers and assorted
     machinery.

     Tired, he hides between two containers, pressing
     himself back into the darkness as nearby footsteps
     clang against the metal deck.  He stiffens as he
     sees a figure appearing at the opening which he just
     entered.  After a slight hesitation, the humanoid
     launches himself towards the figure, pushing it
     against the far bulkhead.  He attempts a blow at his
     pursuer's head, but it is blocked.  The other
     strikes back, but it merely glances off the
     humanoid, who retreats hurriedly.  The pursuer, who
     we now see to be RIKER, gets up and continues the
     pursuit.

     As they pass under the walk-way from the upper
     level, DATA, who has just arrived there, drops over
     the side, landing next to Riker.  Taken by surprise,
     Riker drops to his knee and aims his phaser at Data,
     reading himself for an attack.  He stops when he
     sees who it is.

                             RIKER
                           (To Data)
               Come on.

     They chase after the fleeing humanoid, whose escape
     is blocked by WORF.

                             WORF
                         (To humanoid)
               Do not move.



     Their quarry spins around to retreat, but finds
     Riker and Data blocking his way.

     The humanoid's face is caught in a light in the
     otherwise dim surroundings.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
                         (To humanoid)
               Maraan!

     Riker moves forward to grab MARAAN, but as he does
     so, everything but this unusual humanoid seems to
     distort, then vanishes, to be replaced by....

3.   INT. ENGINEERING.                                      3.

     The distortion clears and MARAAN finds himself
     aboard the Enterprise in Main Engineering; he is on
     the second level that runs around the
     matter/antimatter reactor, which pulses a few feet
     away from him.  Momentarily disorientated, he looks
     down to the first level, towards the Master
     Situation Monitor.

     RIKER, DATA and GEORDI are standing near the Master
     Systems Display, facing in his direction.  Before
     them stands an exact duplicate of Maraan, holding a
     phaser that is aimed at Riker, who is unarmed.

     Riker takes a step towards the duplicate Maraan, his
     hand outstretched.

                             RIKER
                      (To duplicate Maraan)
               Give me the phaser, Maraan.

     Maraan watches as his duplicate fires the phaser.  A
     beam of energy strikes Riker in the chest,
     propelling him back into Data, who lowers him to the
     deck.  Data feels for Riker's pulse at his neck, but
     doesn't find one.

                             DATA
               Commander Riker is dead.

     Shocked, Maraan backs away from the railing on the
     second level and bumps into a control panel behind
     him.  A Personal Access Display Device (PADD) that
     had been left on the panel is knocked off and
     topples over the edge, falling to the level below,
     where it shatters as it hits the deck.  All look up
     in his direction.

     Panicking, Maraan moves away from the control panel,
     but doesn't look where he is going.  He hits the
     railing that stretches around the second level and
     begins to fall over it to the first level.  But as
     he does so, he distorts and disappears.  The Entire
     Main Engineering vanishes with him as we.....

                                                       FADE
OUT.

Hi,

Oh, by the way, the line spacing, etc may be a little out, with jumps every 
now and then to allow for page breaks.  Couldn't do much about that when 
posting it.

All the best,
Ryan.



       STAR TREK: "Memento Mori" - REV. 8/7/93 - ACT ONE

                            ACT ONE

FADE IN:

4.   EXT. ENTERPRISE MOVING UNDER IMPULSE POWER (OPTICAL)   4.

                         PICARD (V.O.)
               Captain's Log, Stardate 94015.7. 
               Ship's sensors recently detected
               an intense burst of radiation in
               Main Engineering.  Lieutenant-
               Commander LaForge has been
               alerted, and is currently
               investigating.  We are
               proceeding under impulse power
               and shall continue to do so
               until the warp engines have been
               ruled out as a possible source
               of this leak.

5.   INT. ENGINEERING.                                      5.

     RIKER is standing beside a seated GEORDI in the
     Chief Engineer's Office, studying the readouts on
     the panel before him.  Geordi keys in a few
     additional directives then sits back and frowns as
     the results appear on the screen.

                             RIKER
               That's not an expression I'm
               used to seeing on your face, Mr
               LaForge.

                            GEORDI
               It's not an expression I'm used
               to having, Commander.  But when
               faced with this....  Well, what
               expression would one expect?

                             RIKER
               Not good, then?

                            GEORDI
               "Not good" is an understatement.
                    (Pauses)
               According to these readings, the
               radiation emissions are coming
               from no-where.

                             RIKER
               How is that possible?

                            GEORDI
               It's not.



                             RIKER
               Will it be safe to return to
               Warp speed at this point?

                            GEORDI
               I've ruled out the warp engines
               as a possible source, so there
               shouldn't be any danger.

     Riker walks to the nearest intercom and speaks into
     it.

                             RIKER
               Riker to Bridge.

                         PICARD (V.O.)
               Picard here, Number One.

                             RIKER
               Mr LaForge assures me that there
               would be no danger in our
               returning to Warp speed,
               Captain.  However, I still
               advise caution.

                         PICARD (V.O.)
               Acknowledged.  We'll be
               proceeding at warp four.  Bridge
               out.

     Riker turns to rejoin Geordi, but as he does so, a
     large distortion suddenly appears in the air, near
     the second level railing.  MARAAN is flung out of
     the middle of the distortion and crashes to the deck
     below.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
                (Hitting intercom button again)
               Security alert!  We have an
               intruder in Main Engineering!

     Riker rushes forward and kneels beside Maraan. 
     Geordi moves to the other side of the alien, taking
     out a tricorder.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Don't move.  You're on board a
               Federation starship.

     Maraan's face is filled with tension and fear.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Calm down.  You're going to be
               fine.  We're not going to hurt
               you.



     Geordi opens the tricorder and scans Maraan, who
     tries to move away.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               It's a scanning device.  It
               can't harm you.

                            GEORDI
               He's clearly humanoid,
               Commander.  But my tricorder
               seems unable to get an accurate
               reading of his internal make-up.

                             RIKER
                         (To Maraan)
               Who are you?

     Maraan does not reply, but continues to stare at
     Riker, a mixture of fear and distress on his face.

     WORF and two security guards enter.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
                     (To Security guards)
               Take him to Sickbay.  I'll be
               there shortly.

     The two guards help a dazed Maraan out of
     Engineering.

                             WORF
               Did he attempt anything of a
               threatening nature, Commander?

                             RIKER
               No.  But I'd keep a guard on him
               all the same.

                             WORF
               I would not have suggested
               otherwise.

                             RIKER
                         (To Geordi)
               Carry on with your
               investigation, Mr LaForge; and
               keep me apprised of any
               developments.

     Riker and Worf leave Engineering.

6.   INT. SICKBAY.                                          6.

     PICARD, TROI and Dr. CRUSHER.  RIKER enters.  MARAAN
     is on a bio-bed out of ear-range.




                            CRUSHER
                     (To Picard and Troi)
               I can find nothing physically
               wrong with him, but I'll need a
               more indepth examination to rule
               out any possibility of damage
               caused by that fall.  As for
               internal injuries, all my
               medical scanners are useless. 
               It seems he has some kind of
               internal shield that blocks out
               all scans into his body.

     Crusher moves to the bed on which Maraan is lying.

                            PICARD
               Counsellor?

                             TROI
               He definitely is suffering from
               a recent traumatic experience,
               Captain.  What it is, I cannot
               say, but it is undoubtedly
               causing great mental anguish.

                            PICARD
                         (To Riker)
               Is there any indication of where
               he came from?  Or what he is
               doing here?

                             RIKER
               As far as I could make out, he
               just popped out of no-where. 
               And he wasn't very talkative. 
               We didn't get so much as one
               word out of him.

     Crusher approaches from Maraan's bed.

                            CRUSHER
               He's awake now, so if you can
               make him overcome that inability
               to speak, he's all yours.

     Picard and Riker move towards Maraan's bed.

                            PICARD
                         (To Maraan)
               I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
               the USS Enterprise, the vessel
               on which you are now aboard. 
               And this is my First Officer,
               Commander William Riker.



     Maraan's gaze fixes and remains on Riker.

                        PICARD (CONT.)
               And you are?

                            MARAAN
               Maraan, Captain.  I am called
               Maraan.

                            PICARD
               Well, Maraan, would you mind
               telling me how you came to be on
               my ship and what you are doing
               here?

     Maraan does not answer immediately.

                            MARAAN
               I don't know.

7.   INT. CORRIDOR.                                         7.

     PICARD and RIKER.

                             RIKER
               He's hiding something.  That bit
               about not remembering...

                            PICARD
               I'm inclined to agree, Number
               One.  "Who knows most says
               least", and he's definitely not
               saying it all.  But he's in the
               capable hands of Counsellor
               Troi.  Hopefully she'll be able
               to get something more productive
               from him.

                             RIKER
               Right now, we're still left with
               the question of who he really is
               and from where he really came.

     They stop at the entrance to a turbo-lift.

                            PICARD
               Prepare a conference for oh-
               nine-hundred.  I want some
               answers by then, to this and
               those radiation emissions.

     The doors open and they step inside.





                             RIKER
               I'll let Mr LaForge know.

     The doors close behind them.

8.   INT. TURBO-LIFT.                                       8.

     PICARD and RIKER.

                            PICARD
                        (To Computer)
               Bridge.

                             RIKER
               There's one other thing I've
               been meaning to ask you,
               Captain.

                            PICARD
               Oh?  What's that?

                             RIKER
               You know I've been trying to
               organise a concert.  Well, I've
               finally managed to coax Data
               into doing a peice on his
               violin, with Donaldson, Graff
               and Carter, of course.  And I
               was wondering if you would be
               willing to put in an appearance.

                            PICARD
               An appearance?

                             RIKER
               On your flute.  I've been
               hearing from Doctor Crusher that
               you've become quite
               proficient....

                            PICARD
               No.  No, no.  Absolutely not.

                             RIKER
               It would make a lovely change of
               pace, and I'm sure the crew
               would enjoy....

                            PICARD
               Doctor Crusher has obviously
               been too generous in her
               praises.  I'm simply not up to
               the challenge...

                             RIKER
               Well, if you change your
               mind....




                            PICARD
               The chances of that are very
               slim.

                             RIKER
               ....you know where to find me.

                            PICARD
               Thank you, Will.  It's kind of
               you to ask, but I don't think
               so.  Not one bit.

     The doors open and the two exit the turbo-lift.

9.   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)                      9.

     GEORDI is standing near the viewing panel on the
     wall, indicating a set of readings.  PICARD, RIKER
     and Dr. CRUSHER are seated around the conference
     table.

                            GEORDI
               Now according to these sets of
               figures, the radiation emission
               has no point of entry into Main
               Engineering.  It came out of no-
               where.  And that, Captain, I
               find hard to accept.

                            PICARD
               Our uninvited guest also
               appeared out of no-where, Mr
               LaForge.  Have you and Mr Data
               looked into a possible
               connection between the two?

     Geordi walks towards the table and the viewing panel
     darkens.

                            GEORDI
               We've started to, sir.  In fact,
               Data is working on it as we
               speak.  But we'll need more time
               before we can give you any more
               information.

                            PICARD
               Try and keep that time as short
               as possible.

                            GEORDI
               Aye, sir.

     Geordi sits down.  Picard turns to Dr. Crusher.




                            PICARD
               Doctor, you've run additional
               scans on our guest.  Has any
               additional information come out?

                            CRUSHER
               No; my scans are still being
               blocked.  There is no way I can
               get a look at his internal make-
               up, and he won't tell me what's
               causing the obstruction.

                             RIKER
               Where is he now?

                            CRUSHER
               He's been assigned to guest
               quarters.  Deanna is with him.

                            PICARD
               Well, if no one has anything
               else to add, the meeting's
               adjourned.

     All exit.  Riker and Geordi are the last to leave.

                             RIKER
               Geordi, I know you're not
               musically inclined, but I was
               wondering if you would like to
               take part in the concert I'm
               organising.....

                            GEORDI
               Don't even ask, Commander.  I
               don't even whistle very well.

10.  INT. TEN-FORWARD.                                      
10.

     TROI picks up two drinks from the bar and moves to
     the table at which MARAAN is seated.  She offers a
     glass to Maraan before sitting down.

                            MARAAN
               Thank you.


                             TROI
               I've got the feeling you aren't
               telling me everything, Maraan. 
               You're hiding something.

                            MARAAN
               I don't understand things all
               too well myself......
                                                  (CONTINUED)


                        MARAAN (CONT.)
               So I don't know how to express
               it to you in terms that you
               would understand.

                             TROI
               Try.

     Maraan is silent for a moment.

                            MARAAN
               Those two people I spoke to in
               your Recovery Centre, what were
               their names?

                             TROI
               You spoke to Captain Picard and
               Commander Riker.

                            MARAAN
               Riker.  Who is he?  What is his
               function?

                             TROI
               He's the First Officer of this
               ship.

                            MARAAN
               Enterprise.

                             TROI
               Yes, the Enterprise.  Why?

                            MARAAN
               No reason.
                    (Pauses)
               This Riker, he was the one who
               found me.  He found me when I
               came here, and I just wanted to
               know who he was.

     Troi watches him, sensing there is something more to
     it than Maraan is letting on.

11.  INT. ENGINEERING                                       
11.

     GEORDI is working at the Duty Engineer's Console
     while DATA is analysing a set of readings on the
     Master Systems Display.

                            GEORDI
                          (To Data)
               All systems check clear.  Damn.




     Geordi walks towards Data.

                        GEORDI (CONT.)
               Well, it's not any one of the
               power transfer conduits or any
               of our secondary systems.  Have
               you found anything?

                             DATA
               No.  However, the radiation
               emissions do seem to have
               stopped.  Whatever caused the
               leak, it was temporary.

                            GEORDI
               That doesn't make me feel much
               better, Data.  It happened once
               and it could happen again.  And
               I want to know about it before
               it does happen again.

                             DATA
               I have established that it was
               linked to high intensity photons
               being released into the
               surrounding area.  But as to
               what caused the photons, I have
               no idea.

                            GEORDI
               High intensity photons, eh? 
               Well, let's run through all
               power distribution systems. 
               There may have been a fault in
               one of them.

     Geordi walks back to the Duty Engineer's Console.

12.  INT. MARAAN'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)                       
12.

     MARAAN enters his Quarters, hesitates, then heads
     for the comm-panel on his desk.

                            MARAAN
               Require accessing instructions
               to computer files containing
               specified information.

                           COMPUTER
               Access to certain materials
               restricted.  Appropriate
               passwords and identification can
               be given vocally or manually. 
               Please specify the relevant
               information required for...



                            MARAAN
               Access all files pertaining to a
               Commander Riker, First Officer
               of Enterprise.

                           COMPUTER
               Certain files under given
               specifications are restricted. 
               Please supply appropriate
               passwords and identification
               for....

                            MARAAN
               List files under given
               specifications that are not
               restricted.

     A long list appears on the viewscreen before him. 
     Maraan studies it for a moment.

                        MARAAN (CONT.)
               Access service record and past
               history of Commander William
               Riker.

     New information appears on the screen before him,
     and he waits for a moment, taking in the various
     information before him.

                        MARAAN (CONT.)
               Now list all restricted
               information on Commander William
               Riker.

                           COMPUTER
               Please supply appropriate
               passwords and identification....

     Maraan gently rests two fingers on the comm-panel.

                            MARAAN
               Over-ride.  Identification given
               without voice-commands.  Access
               necessary passwords and
               identification and re-route to
               current directory.....

     Suddenly whole files fill the monitor and Maraan
     moves closer to study them.

                                                       FADE
OUT.

                        END OF ACT ONE

       STAR TREK: "Memento Mori" - REV. 8/7/93 - ACT TWO

                            ACT TWO

FADE IN:

13.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
13.

     RIKER waits for a turbo-lift.  Finally, the door
     opens to reveal TROI inside.  He steps inside.

14.  INT. TURBO-LIFT.                                       
14.

     RIKER and TROI.

                             RIKER
               Deanna.

                             TROI
               Hello, Will.  Where are you
               headed?

                             RIKER
                         (To Computer)
               Deck Ten.
                          (To Troi)
               Ten Forward.  I've got to make a
               few arrangements for the concert
               next week.  Which reminds me,
               it's not too late for you to
               change your mind.

                             TROI
               No, I don't think I will.

                             RIKER
               Come on.  You've got a great
               voice.  And we've got no vocals
               as yet.  It'll add to the spirit
               of the evening.  And from the
               few people I've got, we could do
               with an additional spirit.

                             TROI
               I don't know, Will.  Who else
               have you asked?

                             RIKER
               McPherson, Harold, Geordi and
               the Captain have all refused
               flat-out.  Worf declined, saying
               his rendition of "Aktuh and
               Maylota", a peice of Klingon
               opera I believe, would not
               complement the rest of the
               show....
                                                  (CONTINUED)


                         RIKER (CONT.)
               I've got Data, Sanderson,
               Spinelli, and myself. 
               Donaldson, Graff and Carter will
               be playing with Data.  Not much
               else.

     Riker and Troi exit the turbo-lift.

15.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
15.

     RIKER and TROI.

                             TROI
               Look, I'll think about it.  But
               I'm not promising anything.

                             RIKER
               That's all I ask.
                    (beat)
               So, how is our mysterious guest? 
               It's been three days and he's
               still not talking?

                             TROI
               Talking?  No.  Asking questions,
               yes.

                             RIKER
               What sort of questions?

                             TROI
               Well, they all definitely have
               something in common.  They all
               revolve around you.

                             RIKER
               Me?

                             TROI
               Apparently, our guest has
               developed quite an interest in
               you.  He's been asking me
               questions about what kind of a
               person you are, what function
               you serve on this ship, do you
               work in Engineering on a regular
               basis.

                             RIKER
               Has he told you what the reason
               is for this sudden interest?






                             TROI
               He's kept that somewhat vague
               and he doesn't make a point of
               asking the questions straight
               out.  He did say it's just that
               you were the one who first
               helped him when he arrived here,
               but I think there's more to it
               than that.

                             RIKER
               I haven't even seen him since we
               spoke in Sickbay.

                             TROI
               Maybe you should go speak to
               him.  If he finds it more easy
               talking to you, you may have
               more luck finding out who he is
               and what he's doing here.

                             RIKER
               All right.  I'll pay him a
               visit; find out what's going on.

16.  MARAAN'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)                            
16.

     MARAAN is behind his desk, reading from the small
     monitor before him.  His door chimes.

                            MARAAN
                    (Switching monitor off)
               Yes.  You may enter.

     The door slides open and RIKER enters.

                            MARAAN
               Yes; Commander Riker is it?

                             RIKER
               I've come to apologize, for not
               having visited you sooner.  I
               trust you have been made
               comfortable.

                            MARAAN
               Yes, I have.  Your fellow-
               officers have been very kind to
               me.

     There is an odd moment's silence.

                             RIKER
                    (Indicating the monitor)
               I'm not disturbing you, am I?



                            MARAAN
               No, not at all.  I was just
               going through some matters of
               interest.  Your Engineering
               section, for instance, sounds
               very impressive.  I would like
               to see it some time, if that's
               possible.

                             RIKER
               Certainly.  I'd be glad to show
               you around the ship.

     Once more there is that awkward silence.

                            MARAAN
               Forgive me, Commander.  I'm
               being quite rude.  Please, have
               a seat.

                             RIKER
               Thank you, but I won't be
               staying too long.  I just came
               to see that everything was all
               right.  And please, call me
               Will.

     Riker turns towards the door and is about to leave. 
     He stops and turns around.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               I'll see what I can do about
               that tour.

                            MARAAN
               I would appreciate it.  Thank
               you.

     Riker exits.

17.  INT. READY ROOM.                                       
17.

     PICARD sits behind his desk, looking up to RIKER,
     who stands before him.

                            PICARD
               And it is your belief that you
               can find out what he's hiding?

                             RIKER
               Deanna says that he's been
               asking questions about me,
               computer records show he's been
               going through my service record
               and personal history.  He's
               definitely after something, and
               I think I'm the one who can find
               out what it is.


                            PICARD
               So you plan to show him around
               the ship?  Around Main
               Engineering, the shuttle bay,
               the Bridge?

                             RIKER
               I'll be with him the whole time,
               Captain.

                            PICARD
               That's not the point, Number
               One.  If we begin to show every
               unknown guest the workings of
               the Enterprise, we'd be
               jeapardizing the security of
               this ship.

                             RIKER
               It's been three days since he
               appeared, sir.  We don't know
               from where or how.  If we don't
               find out, this ship could be in
               just as much jeapardy.  Now,
               showing him around the ship may
               give us an idea of what his
               motives are and may help build
               an element of trust.

                            PICARD
               Playing into the hands of the
               stranger?  All right.  But I
               want you to keep a constant eye
               on him.

                             RIKER
               Thank you, Captain.  I intend to
               do exactly that.

     Riker exits the Ready Room.

18.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
18.

     RIKER and WORF.

                             WORF
               I must reiterate my disapproval,
               Commander.  We have no idea who
               he is or what his intentions
               are.  As Head of Security....

                             RIKER
               That's why you're coming along,
               Worf.  To make sure nothing does
               happen.



                             WORF
               Even so, to give him access to
               restricted areas of the ship....


                             RIKER
               Is exactly what we're going to
               do, Lieutenant.

     They arrive at the door to Maraan's Quarters.

19.  INT. MARAAN'S QUARTERS.                                
19.

     RIKER and WORF enter to find MARAAN waiting for
     them.

                             RIKER
               Maraan, if you're ready, we may
               begin the tour of the ship.

                            MARAAN
                     (Looking at Worf)
               I'm quite ready.

                             RIKER
                     (Indicating Worf)
               Lieutenant Worf, our Chief of
               Security, will be joining us. 
               If you'll follow me.

     The three exit Maraan's Quarters.

20.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
20.

     RIKER, WORF and MARAAN.

                             RIKER
               I was thinking, we can start
               from the bottom and work our way
               up, from Main Engineering to the
               Bridge.

                            MARAAN
               That sounds fine to me.

                             RIKER
               Okay.

     The three enter a waiting turbo-lift.

21.  INT. ENGINEERING.                                      
21.

     RIKER, WORF and MARAAN enter from the corridor to
     see GEORDI and DATA still at work.  Geordi looks up
     from where he is working.



                            GEORDI
                         (To Riker)
               Commander, just the person I
               need to see.  If I could have a
               quick word with you....

                             RIKER
                         (To Geordi)
               Of course.
                         (To Maraan)
               Excuse me, Maraan.  Mr Worf, if
               you would begin show our guest
               around, I'll be with you in a
               moment....

     Worf nods reluctantly as Riker moves to join Geordi
     and Data.

                             WORF
                        (To Maraan)
               Behind us is the Master
               Situation Monitor.

     Maraan turns around to see what Worf is indicating
     at, but his interest is clearly elsewhere.

                         WORF (CONT.)
               This allows us to observe and
               regulate all of the ship's
               primary and secondary systems
               and is useful to detect any
               technical problems that may
               occur.

                            GEORDI
                         (To Riker)
               Commander, we've gone through
               the whole of the ship's primary
               and secondary network and we've
               found nothing.  Whatever caused
               that emission of radiation, it
               was not a fault in the ship's
               systems.

     Worf and Maraan move to the Duty Engineer's Console
     and Worf begins to explain its function.

                             RIKER
               Have you investigated the
               possibility of a connection
               between it and Maraan's
               appearance?

                            GEORDI
               As much as possible, but there
               isn't much to go on....
                                                  (CONTINUED)


                        GEORDI (CONT.)
               All medical scans show no
               residual radiation on or around
               him.

                             WORF
                         (To Maraan)
               If you will follow me, I will
               now show you to the Chief
               Engineer's Office.

     Worf and Maraan move towards the Chief Engineer's
     Office.

                             DATA
               The findings were inconclusive,
               Commander.  The radiation we are
               dealing with is similiar to....

     Data breaks off as Maraan and Worf pass them, then
     continues.

                         DATA (CONT.)
               ....is similiar to Cerenkov
               radiation.  The photon bursts
               given off are only detectable
               for a trillionth of a second or
               even less.  Thus the possibility
               of residual radiation being
               found on Maraan would be zero,
               even if he is in some way
               connected to the emissions.

                             WORF
                         (To Maraan)
               Here the Chief Engineer or
               whoever is on duty can maintain
               the level of energy output to
               the rest of the ship.  It is
               also here that the warp engines
               and tractor beam are controlled.

                            GEORDI
                         (To Riker)
               Even if he did cause it, sir,
               there's just no way to tie him
               back to it.










                             DATA
               However, the fact that none of
               the ship's systems are at fault
               and the fact that his arrival
               coincided at the time when the
               emissions were at their peak
               strongly suggest that there is a
               correlation between our guest's
               arrival and the radiation.

                             RIKER
               Conjecture is fine, but I want
               facts.  Keep working at it.

                            GEORDI
               Aye, sir.

     Geordi and Data turn back to their work.  Riker
     joins Worf and Maraan in the Chief Engineer's
     Office.

                             RIKER
                    (To Worf and Maraan)
               Well, are we finished here?

                             WORF
               I have given our guest a
               rudimentary knowledge of the
               basic principles behind the
               engineering systems, Commander.

                             RIKER
               Thank you, Mr Worf.
                         (To Maraan)
               Are there any questions you have
               regarding what you've just
               heard?

                            MARAAN
               No, thank you, Commander.  All
               my questions have been answered
               in full.

                             RIKER
               All right.  Shall we move on,
               then?

22.  EXT. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)                              
22.

     The Enterprise is travelling through space.







23.  INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS.                                 
23.

     RIKER is preparing for the concert by playing a solo
     on his trombone.  Just as he nears the end of the
     peice, culminating on a high note, the trumpet emits
     a painful squeal and Riker winces.

     His door chimes.

                             RIKER
               Come.

     The door slides open and Maraan steps inside.

                            MARAAN
               Will, I'm not disturbing you?

                             RIKER
               No, come in.  I'm just
               practicing for a concert
               tomorrow night.  And there's
               this one note which I've never
               been able to get right.  But
               tomorrow, with a little luck, I
               will.

     Riker positions the trombone against his lips once
     more and begins to play.  Maraan stands aside,
     listening.

     Once again, the peice is played beautifully, except
     for the end when he does not get the last note
     right.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Make that lots of luck.

     Maraan walks around the room, studying the various
     items that scatter it.  He stops when he comes to an
     artist's impression of a small town located in a
     trough among snowy hills.

                            MARAAN
               Is that the place you were
               telling me about?  Alaska?


                             RIKER
               Valdez, Alaska.  My place of
               birth.  I also like to think of
               it as home.
                    (Pauses)
               Where's yours?

     Maraan does not answer.




                         RIKER (CONT.)
               I've known you for just over a
               week, Maraan.  But I still feel
               like I don't know you at all.
                    (beat)
               You seem to have gotten to know
               me pretty well.  I would like to
               reciprocate.  Now, will you give
               me the chance to do that?

                            MARAAN
               Will....

                             RIKER
               Yes, you know my name and I know
               yours.  That is about all we
               have in common, and I want that
               to change.

     Still Maraan does not answer.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               You've been asking people
               questions about me and you've
               been asking me even more. 
               You've been through my service
               record, my personal history. 
               Even files that are restricted,
               though how you managed that, I
               haven't the faintest idea.

     Maraan turns to look at Riker.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Yes, I know about the
               information you've been
               accessing from the computer
               banks.  Now, what's going on?

                            MARAAN
               You wouldn't believe me.

                             RIKER
               Try me.

                            MARAAN
               Will, I've seen the future.  And
               though I don't know why, I know
               I'm going to kill you.

                                                       FADE
OUT.

      STAR TREK: "Memento Mori" - REV. 8/7/93 - ACT THREE

                           ACT THREE

FADE IN:

24.  EXT. ENTERPRISE MOVING UNDER WARP POWER (OPTICAL)      
24.

                         PICARD (V.O.)
               Captain's Log, Stardate 94036.6. 
               I have just been informed of
               Maraan's statements to Commander
               Riker.  A conference has been
               called to review the situation
               and question our guest further.

25.  INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE.                               
25.

     PICARD, RIKER and WORF.  The door to the lounge
     opens, and TROI and MARAAN enter.  Maraan looks at
     Riker, who meets his stare.

                            PICARD
               Counsellor, Maraan.  Come in. 
               Please, take a seat.

     Maraan and Troi join the two officers around the
     table.

                        PICARD (CONT.)
               Maraan, my First Officer has
               informed me of your claims; that
               you are a time traveller?

     Maraan does not reply.

                        PICARD (CONT.)
               He also says that you claim to
               have witnessed his death.  Is
               that true?

                             RIKER
               Maraan....

                            MARAAN
               I saw myself kill your First
               Officer, Captain.  I don't know
               when I will do it and I don't
               know why.  All I do know is that
               I will do it.

                            PICARD
               I must admit to having certain
               doubts regarding the truth of
               you story, Maraan.  Just where
               is your time machine?


                            MARAAN
               It is inside of me.

                             RIKER
               Inside of you?

                            MARAAN
               I understand that your scanning
               instruments cannot probe the
               interior of my body.  It is
               because there is a protective
               screen around the mechanism that
               allows no analysis of it.

                             RIKER
               That sounds a little far-fetched
               to me.

                            MARAAN
                         (To Riker)
               It is the truth.

                             TROI
               Maraan, if you feel that you're
               such a danger to Commander
               Riker, why don't you travel
               elsewhere, to a time and place
               where you cannot harm him?

                            MARAAN
                    (After a slight pause)
               The power cells of the mechanism
               are only powerful enough for one
               or two jumps.  After a journey,
               one is supposed to give the
               mechanism time to replenish
               itself.  On this occassion, I
               jumped twice in a very short
               period of time.
                    (beat)
               You don't believe me.

                            PICARD
               No, Maraan.  I don't believe
               that I do.

                            MARAAN
                         (To Riker)
               Don't you understand?  You are
               going to die.

                             RIKER
               Am I?




                            MARAAN
               I saw it.

                            PICARD
               And just what proof do we have
               that this is the truth?  So far,
               what you have given us is no
               more than mere talk.  Where is
               your evidence?

                            MARAAN
               Evidence?  The evidence will
               show itself in time.

                            PICARD
               Maraan, I suggest you consider
               telling the truth, about who you
               really are and why you are
               really here.  Or you will find I
               have a very low tolerance level
               for liars.
                    (beat)
                         (To Worf)
               Lieutenant Worf, please escort
               our guest back to his Quarters.

     Maraan and Worf exit.  Picard looks at Riker and
     Troi.

                        PICARD (CONT.)
               Those answers he gave us; he was
               clearly trying to rationalize
               his way out of glaring
               inconsistencies.

                             TROI
               I'm not so sure, Captain.  I
               sensed no deception on his part,
               no intention of creating a false
               impression in our minds....

                             RIKER
               Then you believe he is telling
               the truth?

                             TROI
               Not at all.  All I am saying is
               that he clearly believes he saw
               your death.  Whether he actually
               did or did not, I can't say.

                            PICARD
               Do you mean to suggest that he
               may be insane, Counsellor?




                             TROI
               He is feeling very stressed,
               Captain.  I'd say almost near
               the brink of a collapse.  There
               is the possibility that he isn't
               quite stable.

                             RIKER
               I don't know.  I've spent a
               great deal of time with him this
               last week, and he hasn't done
               anything to suggest he's
               unstable.

                            PICARD
               I'll ask Dr. Crusher to prepare
               another examination for Maraan,
               and I'd appreciate it if you
               could keep an eye on him,
               Counsellor; see if you can help
               him in any way.

                             TROI
               Of course.

26.  INT. MARAAN'S QUARTERS.                                
26.

     MARAAN is alone in his Quarters when his door
     chimes.

                            MARAAN
               Come in.

     The door opens to reveal RIKER standing in the
     corridor outside.

     Maraan turns and looks at him.  After a slight
     pause, Riker steps into the room and the door slides
     shut behind him.

                        MARAAN (CONT.)
               So, you've come to tell me that
               my story is a total fabrication
               or the product of a deluded
               mind?

                             RIKER
               No.  I've come for an
               explanation.  Why are you doing
               this?

                            MARAAN
               Because it's the truth.

                             RIKER
               What do you take me for, Maraan? 
               A fool....?
                                                  (CONTINUED)


                         RIKER (CONT.)
               After your indepth
               investigations into me you
               should have known better than
               that.


                            MARAAN
               I wasn't lying.

     Riker turns to leave.

                        MARAAN (CONT.)
               Will, I'm not lying.

                             RIKER
               That you're a time traveller? 
               And you just happened to appear
               on our ship in time to witness
               my murder.  If this is all true
               and you know what is going to
               happen, then why don't you
               change it?

                            MARAAN
               How?  I don't even know why I
               will do it.  That's why I
               started investigating you,
               finding out what kind of a
               person you are to see if there
               may be some clue...

                             RIKER
               Do you really expect me to buy
               that?  Where's your proof?

     Maraan does not answer.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               All you have given me is your
               word.  And that just isn't good
               enough.  I need more.

                            MARAAN
               More?  If more will only suffice
               then more is what you will have.
                    (beat)
               You will soon come across an
               unidentified vessel, and will
               give chase.  You will try to
               catch it, but you will fail.

                             RIKER
               What ship?  Who does it belong
               to?

     Riker waits for an answer, but doesn't get one.



                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Maraan, I'm your friend.  But I
               don't have a clue who you really
               are.  And I want to know.

                            MARAAN
               That's why you visited me;
               that's why you took me on a tour
               of this vessel, Will.  It has
               nothing to do with me or us. 
               You're just following orders,
               aren't you?

                             RIKER
               Do you really believe that?

     Maraan does not reply.

     Riker stares at him momentarily.  Then he turns and
     leaves.

27.  INT. READY ROOM.                                       
27.

     PICARD has just finished ordering a cup of tea and
     picks it up from the slot in which it has
     materialized.  He moves to his seat behind his desk
     as RIKER speaks to him.

                             RIKER
               ....however, he wouldn't give
               any further information.

                            PICARD
                       (Sitting down)
               A ship?  That is pretty vague. 
               And it also changes nothing.

                             RIKER
               I agree.

                            PICARD
               You have spent quite a great
               deal of time with him, Number
               One.

                             RIKER
               Yes, I have.

                            PICARD
               He does seem to be more open
               with you than with anyone else.

     Riker doesn't answer.






                        PICARD (CONT.)
               Your concert still going ahead
               this evening?

                             RIKER
               Definitely.  It should start
               around seven-thirty, if everyone
               is ready on time.

                            PICARD
               Good.  I'm looking forward to
               it.
                    (pauses)
               And perhaps it would be just the
               occassion to which Maraan should
               be invited.

                             RIKER
               Sir?

                            PICARD
               If we're to find out what his
               true intentions are, what better
               place to do so than at a social
               gathering?

28.  INT. ENGINEERING.                                      
28.

     DATA is on the second level, near to where Maraan
     appeared from the distortion, studying the readings
     on the tricorder he is holding.  GEORDI is seated in
     the Chief Engineer's Office, tapping a few commands
     on the comm-panel before him.  He studies the read-
     out, then pushes the chair along the length of the
     office to the opening to Main Engineering and looks
     up to Data.

                            GEORDI
               The readings confirm it, Data. 
               That is where the photon bursts
               were at their peak.  They
               definitely originated in that
               area.

                             DATA
               Empty space?

                            GEORDI
               Right from where our mysterious
               guest materialized.

                             DATA
               Then there is indeed a definite
               link between these radiation
               emissions and Maraan's
               appearance.



                            GEORDI
               Yeah, but what can we do with
               it?  Right now that doesn't give
               us any better idea of who he is
               or how he came to be here.

     Data climbs down the ladder to the lower level.

                             DATA
               At least not yet.  However, if
               my theory that those photon
               bursts were indeed caused by
               tachyons entering our tardyon
               universe is valid, we may have a
               better understanding as to his
               mode of transport.

                            GEORDI
               Well, then let's get to testing
               that theory.

29.  INT. MARAAN'S QUARTERS.                                
29.

     MARAAN is seated, alone in his Quarters.  The door
     chimes.

                            MARAAN
               Yes.  Come in.

     The door opens and RIKER enters.  The two look at
     one another, silently.

                             RIKER
               I've come to invite you to the
               concert this evening.  If you
               are available....

                            MARAAN
               Thank you.  Thank you,
               Commander.

     Riker enters the Quarters and looks around him
     before speaking.

                             RIKER
               I also came to apologize, for my
               abruptness earlier today.  I'm
               sorry.

                            MARAAN
               No apologies are necessary.  You
               had every right to act the way
               you did.

     Riker nods and turns to leave.



                        MARAAN (CONT.)
               Will.

     Riker looks back to Maraan.

                        MARAAN (CONT.)
               What time should I be there?

                             RIKER
               I'll come pick you up.  The
               concert starts at seven-thirty,
               but be ready a quarter of an
               hour early.

     Riker exits.

30.  INT. TEN-FORWARD.                                      
30.

     A fair crowd has gathered in Ten-Forward, which has
     been altered to provide a small stage near the
     entrance.  PICARD, Dr. CRUSHER, GEORDI and MARAAN
     are seated together, enjoying the performances. 
     DATA is busy playing on his violin, accompanied by
     three other violinists.  As he and the other
     violinists finish, they are greeted with loud
     applause.  TROI and RIKER, who are standing near the
     entrance, join in the clapping.  Riker has his
     trombone tucked under his arm.

                             TROI
                          (To Riker)
               I can't believe you talked me
               into this.

                             RIKER
               Why?  You're going to be great.

                             TROI
               Just don't make a big deal out
               of this, okay?  I just want to
               get this all behind me.

     Data and the three violinists leave the stage, and
     approach Riker and Troi.  Instruments suitable to
     the coming event are positioned on the stage and
     various crewmembers assume positions at each
     instrument.

                             RIKER
                          (To Data)
               Data, that was great.

                             DATA
               Thank you, Commander.  I hope
               your and Counsellor Troi's
               performances go just as well.


                             RIKER
                      (Smiling at Troi)
               I think we'll do just fine.

                             TROI
                         (To Riker)
               I'm going to get you for this.

     Riker gives her a final smile as she moves towards
     the stage to pick up the microphone that is in
     position.

     There is a moment's pause, then the band begins to
     play.  Troi, a little nervous, begins to  sing.

                             DATA
                         (To Riker)
               Counsellor Troi did not seem to
               be looking forward to her
               performance.  Is there a reason
               for this?

                             RIKER
               She's just shy, Data.

                             DATA
               Perhaps she is concerned that
               people will not appreciate her
               efforts.

                             RIKER
               Perhaps.

     Troi finishes the song and once more the audience
     erupts into applause.  Troi moves down from the
     stage to rejoin Riker.

                             RIKER
                           (To Troi)
               Nice.

     With a small smile, he moves towards the stage.

     At their table, Dr. Crusher turns to Geordi.

                            CRUSHER
                          (To Geordi)
               Geordi, I'm surprised to see
               you're not in the concert.

                            GEORDI
               Oh?  Why's that?






                            CRUSHER
               Well, I've heard that you play
               the Cello very well.  I just
               thought that....

                            PICARD
               Yes; about that, Doctor.  I'd
               like to speak to you a little
               later, if you don't mind?

     On stage, Riker looks at the band and nods.  They
     begin to play and Riker steps forward, lifting the
     trombone to his mouth.  He begins to play the same
     tune as he was previously practicing in his
     Quarters.

     As the peice comes to an end, Riker hits the high
     note, the one that has always eluded him, and gets
     it right.  As he lowers his trombone to take his
     bow, the crowd breaks out into loud applause,
     getting up to give him a standing ovation.

     As Picard stands up, clapping, his communicator
     beeps, and he taps it in reply.

                            PICARD
               Picard here.

                          WORF (V.O.)
               Bridge here, Captain.  Sensors
               are picking up an unidentified
               vessel in the vicinity, one not
               answering our hails.  Your
               presence is required on the
               Bridge.

     Picard looks at Maraan, who has heard, then at
     Riker, who has just come up from a bow, the loud
     applause reverberating around the room.

                                                       FADE
OUT.

                       END OF ACT THREE

      STAR TREK: "Memento Mori" - REV. 8/7/93 - ACT FOUR

                           ACT FOUR

FADE IN:

31.  INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)                                  
31.

     As PICARD, RIKER, TROI and DATA exit from the aft
     turbo-lift, WORF looks up from his post.  On the
     viewscreen, a smaller, yet fair-sized ship can be
     seen moving away from the Enterprise.

                            PICARD
               Report, Lieutenant.

                             WORF
               Sensors picked up the presence
               of the ship shortly before I
               alerted you, sir.  After
               repeatedly ignoring our hails,
               it began to move off at Warp
               Five on the heading it is now
               on.

     Picard seats himself in the captain's chair, next to
     Riker and Troi.  Data assumes his position at Ops.

                            PICARD
               Warp six, Mr Data.  Engage.

32.  EXT. ENTERPRISE CHASING OTHER SHIP (OPTICAL)           
32.

     The Enterprise shoots to warp speed, after the other
     ship.

33.  INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)                                  
33.

                             DATA
               The other ship has increased
               speed to warp six, Captain.

                            PICARD
               Take us to warp seven,
               Commander.

     Data carries out the order, then notices a reading
     on his panel.

                             DATA
               The other ship is now at warp
               seven as well, Captain.  It is
               matching our speed point for
               point.

                            PICARD
               Inform security to show Maraan
               to the Bridge, Mr Worf.


     Worf complies.

                             WORF
               Captain, I do not detect any
               shields or protective screens of
               any sort on the other vessel.

                             RIKER
               Would we be able to beam an Away
               Team over there?

                             WORF
               There is no sign of a field that
               could block such a beam-over,
               Commander.

     Riker looks at Picard.

                            PICARD
               Make it so, Number One.

     Riker gets up and moves towards the aft turbo-lift
     just as it opens, and Maraan and a security guard
     step out, onto the Bridge.  

                             RIKER
               Data, Worf.

     Riker reaches Maraan and is about to enter the
     turbo-lift.

                            MARAAN
               You won't succeed, Will.

                             RIKER
               Time will tell.

     The doors close, seperating the two.

34.  INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM.                                 
34.

     The doors open and RIKER, DATA and WORF step
     through.  They immediately move to the transporter
     pads, Riker and Worf with phasers in hand.

                             RIKER
               Energize.

     The officer at the transporter console activates the
     beams and the Away Team disappears in a shimmer of
     light.






35.  INT. OTHER SHIP.                                       
35.

     Re-materialization takes effect, and RIKER, DATA and
     WORF appear in the cramped confines of the other
     ship.

                             RIKER
               Life signs?

                             DATA
                (Looking at open tricorder)
               I am getting very confused
               readings, Commander.
                (Indicating ahead of them)
               Coming from that direction.

                             RIKER
               Let's go.

     They move forward, between the large pipes and power
     conduits.  Below them, through the thick iron mesh
     on which they are walking, they can see a lower
     deck, also filled with pipes and metal structures.

     Soon they come to an iron ladder, descending to the
     level below them.  Riker is about to move down it,
     but Data interrupts him as he takes his first step.

                             DATA
               Commander, my readings indicate
               we are very close to whatever I
               scanned before.  We should be in
               visual...

     Data stops as they all spot a figure dash out from
     behind the bulkhead on the lower level and run past
     the ladder, and underneath the gang-plank on which
     they have been walking.  Riker grabs the railing of
     the ladder and launches himself over the side, to
     drop all the way down to the lower deck, landing in
     a crouched position.  In the dimmness, he can make
     out a figure running away between large metal
     containers and assorted machinery.

                             RIKER
               Stop or I'll shoot!

     He hesitates for a second as the humanoid continues
     to run away, then fires.  The beam of energy
     narrowly misses the alien, hitting a container.

     Worf clambers halfway down the ladder, then jumps
     over, to land on the other side from Riker.





                             RIKER
               Data!  Go back the way we came
               and cut him off if he tries
               moving up to your level. 
               Worf...

     Riker indicates for Worf to circle around the other
     side of the bulkheads, then moves off in the same
     direction that their quarry was heading.

     Phaser in hand, Riker works his way past a ruptured
     pipe hissing out gas.  The further into the bowels
     of the ship he moves, the darker it gets.  Suddenly
     he hears a rustle and looks to his left; but too
     late.

     There is a flash of movement to his left and Riker
     is pushed against the bulkhead to his right, falling
     down against it, to land on one knee.  His attacker
     attempts a blow to his head, which Riker blocks and
     then strikes back.  His blow merely glances off his
     attacker, who retreats hurriedly, followed by Riker.

     As they pass under an overhang from the upper level,
     Data, who has just arrived there, drops over the
     side and lands next to Riker, who readies himself
     for another attack.  He stops when he sees it is
     Data.

                             RIKER
               Come on.

     They both pursue the fleeing humanoid, whose escape
     is blocked by Worf.

                             WORF
                       (To humanoid)
               Do not move.

     Their quarry spins around to retreat, but finds
     Riker and Data blocking his way.  His face is caught
     in a light in the otherwise dim surroundings, and
     they see that it is an exact duplicate of MARAAN.

                             RIKER
               Maraan!

     Riker moves forward to grab Maraan, but as he does
     so, the humanoid seems to distort, then vanishes.

36.  INT. BRIDGE.                                           
36.

     PICARD is standing near the Ops console, listening
     to Riker's report, while MARAAN is standing at the
     back of the Bridge, near the security console.





                         RIKER (V.O.)
               ...but as I reached out to grab
               him, he disappeared.

                            MARAAN
               He is now witnessing your First
               Officer's murder, Captain.

                            PICARD
               That is enough!  Security,
               escort this gentleman back to
               his Quarters.

     Maraan is led back into the turbo-lift by the
     security guard who had accompanied him to the
     Bridge.

     Picard turns back to the main viewscreen.

                            PICARD
               Number One, is there any
               indication on that ship that the
               Maraan you saw is the one and
               same Maraan we now have on the
               Enterprise?

37.  INT. OTHER SHIP.                                       
37.

     RIKER watches WORF and DATA as they collect readings
     and examine the structure of the ship.

                             RIKER
               We're beginning our
               investigations down here,
               Captain.  As soon as we find
               anything out, we'll contact you
               immediately.

                         PICARD (V.O.)
               Understood.  Picard out.

     Riker moves to Worf, who is studying the readings on
     his tricorder.

                             WORF
               A worthless pile of junk.  It
               would look outdated even in the
               space depo at Qualor Two.

                             RIKER
               No doubt he bought the cheapest
               thing he could find, to get from
               one sector to the other.





                             WORF
               It did not do him much good to
               escape us.  In so trying, he has
               burnt out his warp coil.  If he
               was not caught by us, he would
               be just as trapped here, with no
               power to go anywhere.

                             RIKER
               Maybe he realized that, and
               jumped, not only into the
               future, but also onto the
               Enterprise, to hitch a ride.

                             WORF
               Commander, you do not honestly
               believe him?

                             RIKER
               Mr Worf, right now I don't quite
               know what to believe.

38.  EXT. ENTERPRISE AND OTHER SHIP (OPTICAL)               
38.


                         PICARD (V.O.)
               Captain's Log: Stardate
               94092.6 - Chief Engineer LaForge
               and a team of engineers have
               beamed over to the unidentified
               vessel in order to carry out a
               complete investigation of it. 
               So far, there has been no sign
               of the other Maraan since he
               disappeared from the other
               vessel a few hours ago.

39.  INT. READY ROOM.                                       
39.

     RIKER listens to PICARD.

                            PICARD
               No sign of where it came from,
               no idea where it was headed? 
               Did you manage to find anything
               over there?

                             RIKER
               Data and Geordi have beamed over
               to carry out certain tests.  As
               soon as they've found out
               anything, I'll let you know.

     Picard is silent for a moment.



                            PICARD
               I'm sorry about your concert,
               Will.

                             RIKER
               These things happen, Captain. 
               At least I managed to hit my
               high note.

                            PICARD
               Before being cut off.  Do you
               believe him?

                             RIKER
               Maraan?  I don't know.

                            PICARD
               Will, just don't let it get to
               your head.  Don't take it as
               irrefutable.

     Riker nods and exits.

40.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
40.

     RIKER walks down the ship's corridor, towards
     Maraan's Quarters.  As he comes to it, he looks at
     the security GUARD standing outside.

                             GUARD
               Lieutenant Worf's orders, sir.

     Riker nods, then turns to face the door.

41.  INT. MARAAN'S QUARTERS.                                
41.

     MARAAN is sitting in one of the lounge chairs, the
     lights turned low.  The door chimes.


                            MARAAN
               Come in.

     The door opens and RIKER's figure stands silhouetted
     in the doorway.  He hesitates, then enters, the door
     sliding closed behind him.

                             RIKER
               Maraan, we need to talk.

                            MARAAN
               I'm sorry, Will.  There's not
               much to tell.  I don't know
               when, I don't know why.



     Riker takes a seat near Maraan.

                             RIKER
               I need to know more.

                            MARAAN
               We were in that same place where
               I arrived...

                             RIKER
               Engineering.

                            MARAAN
               Yes.  You were walking towards
               me, telling me to hand over a
               weapon.

                             RIKER
               And?  What else, Maraan?

                            MARAAN
               I killed you.  In cold-blood. 
               You weren't even armed.

                             RIKER
               What then?  What happened, to
               you?

                            MARAAN
               I panicked.  I was shocked, I
               just wanted to get away.  And
               then I jumped, I don't know how
               far back.

                             RIKER
               You don't know when you will be
               appearing, how far you jumped
               forwards in time to escape us on
               that ship?

                            MARAAN
               No.  No, I don't know.

     Riker nods and gets up.  He exits the room, leaving
     Maraan alone in the dimly-lit Quarters.  A mixture
     of concern and realization crosses over Maraan's
     face.

42.  OTHER SHIP.                                            
42.

     GEORDI and DATA are scanning the interior of the
     ship, near to where the duplicate Maraan
     disappeared.






                            GEORDI
               Yeah, there she is.  The same
               radiation emissions as the ones
               in Engineering.
                     (Looks up to Data)
               We have our link.

                             DATA
               These photon bursts should have
               theoretically stopped by now,
               Geordi.  The Maraan we attempted
               to catch disappeared well over
               three hours ago.  As I said
               before, each burst should only
               be detectable for a trillionth
               of a second after it began.

                            GEORDI
               Well we detected those radiation
               emissions in Engineering well
               before Maraan arrived and well
               after that too.  Same as here.

                             DATA
               Which could indicate that
               whatever method of travel he has
               used, has left an opening behind
               it.

                            GEORDI
               A gate-way?

                             DATA
               If he is indeed a time-traveller
               and tachyons are the cause for
               these photon bursts, it would
               appear so.  However, a specific
               device may be required to enter
               and exit this phenomenon.

43.  INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS.                                 
43.

     RIKER is cleaning his trombone and preparing to
     return it to its case.  A phaser is attached to his
     belt (for all future scenes).

     His communicator beeps and he taps it.

                             RIKER
               Riker here.  Go ahead.







                         GEORDI (V.O.)
               Commander, Data and I have just
               completed our scans of this
               ship.  And we've found similiar
               emissions to those we detected
               in Engineering shortly before
               Maraan's arrival.

     Riker considers this new information.

                             RIKER
               I see.  Mr LaForge, would it be
               possible to rig sensors to
               detect any further emissions in
               Engineering, to alert us as soon
               as any further radiation is
               noticed.

                         GEORDI (V.O.)
               No, that shouldn't be too much
               of a problem, sir.

                             RIKER
               Then get on with it.  Riker out.

     As Riker breaks communication, his door chimes.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Come.

     The door slides open, and Maraan enters.  The guard
     that was stationed outside his Quarters is seen
     waiting in the corridor.  Maraan turns to look at
     him, then enters the room.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               I believe that was our Security
               Chief's orders.

     Maraan nods silently.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               Is there something I can do for
               you, Maraan?

     Maraan remains silent for a moment.

                            MARAAN
               I've come to ask a favour, Will.

                             RIKER
               What is it?





                            MARAAN
               In my Quarters, you wanted to
               know when I would appear, or at
               least when my past-self would
               appear.

     Riker nods slowly.

                            MARAAN
               You want to catch him, don't
               you?

                             RIKER
               I want to question him.

     Maraan is silent again.

                            MARAAN
               Will, if you catch him, if you
               change what happens, you will
               change the future.  But you will
               also change my past.  You will
               change who I am.

     It is Riker's turn to remain silent.

                        MARAAN (CONT.)
               If you catch him, he won't have
               the chance to go back in time,
               or if you distract him in a way
               that never happened before, he
               will not jump back to the
               instant at which I arrived in
               Engineering.

                             RIKER
               Maraan, time is going to change
               whether we catch him or not. 
               I'm not going to die and you're
               not going to kill me.  By coming
               back in time, you changed that.

     Maraan turns to sit down, slowly.

                            MARAAN
               Oh my God, Will.

     Ashen-faced, Maraan looks up at Riker, who stares
     back at his friend.

                                                       FADE
OUT.

                        END OF ACT FOUR

      STAR TREK: "Memento Mori" - REV. 8/7/93 - ACT FIVE

                           ACT FIVE

FADE IN:

44.  INT. TEN-FORWARD.                                      
44.

     The interior of Ten-Forward is back to its original
     state, with the tables and chairs filling its
     bustling area.

     TROI is sitting at a table, talking to another
     woman.  She notices RIKER entering Ten-Forward.

                             TROI
                         (To woman)
               Excuse me.

     The other woman nods and continues to sip her drink
     as Troi gets up and moves to the bar, where Riker is
     sitting.  She takes a seat next to him.

                             RIKER
               Is this where you conduct all
               your business?

                             TROI
               People talk more freely when
               they're relaxing.

     Riker nods a thanks as he is given a drink by the
     bartender.

                         TROI (CONT.)
               Do you feel like talking?

                             RIKER
               I don't know.  Sometimes I do
               wonder if he has seen it all
               before.  His future, my fate.

                             TROI
               You are concerned about it.

                             RIKER
               Concerned?  Yes.  When someone
               expects something to happen,
               they normally find ways to make
               sure that it does.

                             TROI
               How is Maraan?





                             RIKER
               The last time we spoke was two
               days ago.  He also seemed
               concerned about it, asked me if
               I was considering capturing his
               past-self should he materialize.

                             TROI
               Would you?

                             RIKER
               No.  I promised him I wouldn't
               and I won't.  I....

     Riker is cut off by Geordi's voice over the
     intercom.

                         GEORDI (V.O.)
               LaForge to Commander Riker. 
               Please report to Main
               Engineering.

     Riker taps his communicator.

                             RIKER
               Riker here.  What seems to be
               the problem?

                         GEORDI (V.O.)
               Data and I have the results of
               the radiation emission tests
               ready for you, sir.

     Riker glances at Troi, and says:

                             RIKER
               I'm on my way.

     Troi watches Riker as he exits Ten-Forward.

45.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
45.

     RIKER is walking down a corridor, towards
     Engineering, when WORF calls to him from behind.

                             WORF
               Commander!

     Riker turns and Worf picks up his pace to catch up
     to him.

                             RIKER
               Yes, Worf, what is it?





                             WORF
               I have heard it said that you
               now believe Maraan.  Is this so?

                             RIKER
               No, I don't believe him.  I am
               considering all possibilities,
               though.

     They resume walking.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
               I've also noticed that you have
               posted a guard outside his
               Quarters.

                             WORF
               A precaution I thought was
               necessary, Commander.  If what
               he says is true....

                             RIKER
               "If", Mr Worf.

                             WORF
               It was a necessary and valid
               security measure, sir.  We do
               not know who he is or...

                             RIKER
               I'm not disagreeing with you,
               Lieutenant.

                             WORF
               Then if it is not out of line,
               Commander, may I offer one of my
               security guards as protection.

                             RIKER
               Thank you, Worf.  But I don't
               think so.  I can look after
               myself just fine.

     Worf stops and watches Riker, as the First Officer
     continues walking down the corridor.

46.  INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)                             
46.

     GEORDI and DATA are standing next to the Master
     Systems Display, studying one of the readings. 
     RIKER enters from the corridor and walks towards
     them.

                             RIKER
               What have you gentlemen come up
               with?


                            GEORDI
               Not good news, Commander.  We've
               analysed those radiation
               emissions on the other ship, and
               have confirmed Data's theory. 
               They are being caused by photon
               bursts, of a nature which can
               only be accounted for by the
               presence of tachyons.

                             DATA
               Apparently, when Maraan appears
               after a jump, a flow of tachyons
               precede and follow him.

                             RIKER
               Opening the flood-gates?

                             DATA
               In a sense, yes.  Though that
               can not be considered an exact
               analogy.

                            GEORDI
               The only way this makes sense,
               Commander, is if he is what he
               claims to be - a time traveller.

     Suddenly new information appears on the screen,
     over-writing the results of Data's readings.  Data
     turns to analyse it, then sits down and keys in new
     commands.

                             DATA
               Commander, according to sensors,
               there has suddenly been an
               increase in radiation levels in
               Main Engineering.
                     (Turns to Riker)
               Of an exact nature as the one
               that preceded Maraan's previous
               arrival.

                             RIKER
               Pinpoint it.

                             DATA
               It appears to be emanating
               from... nowhere.









47.  INT. MARAAN'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)                       
47.

     MARAAN is alone in his Quarters.

                           COMPUTER
               Sensor readings correlating to
               desired specifications have now
               been detected in Main
               Engineering.

     Maraan looks towards the computer momentarily, then
     moves to his desk and presses a button on the comm-
     panel.

                            MARAAN
               Give description of said
               readings.

                           COMPUTER
               Sensor readings are indicative
               of radiation emissions caused by
               sudden photon bursts in the
               immediate vicinity.

     Maraan is silent for a moment.  Finally, he comes to
     a decision and moves towards the door.

48.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
48.

     The door to Maraan's Quarters slide open.  Before
     the guard can react, MARAAN lunges out and over-
     whelms him.

     He picks up the security guard's phaser, then
     hurries to the nearest turbo-lift, the doors of
     which have just opened.  An unsuspecting CREWMAN has
     just entered.

                            CREWMAN
               Deck Ten.

     As the doors begin to close, Maraan jumps between
     them.  Taken by surprise, the crewman is thrown out
     before he can react to the alien's presence.  The
     doors close on Maraan.

49.  INT. TURBO-LIFT.                                       
49.

     MARAAN looks around him uncertainly.

                            MARAAN
               Computer, over-ride previous
               command.




                           COMPUTER
               Previous command over-ridden. 
               Please specify required
               destination.

                            MARAAN
               Computer, present location of
               Commander Will Riker.

                           COMPUTER
               Commander Riker is in
               Engineering.

50.  INT. ENGINEERING.                                      
50.

     GEORDI and RIKER are standing on either side of a
     seated DATA, who is feeding more commands into the
     console.

                             RIKER
               Well, Data?

                             DATA
               The radiation emissions are
               definitely increasing,
               Commander.  I still do not have
               a location.

                             RIKER
                 (Looking up to second level)
               You don't need one, Mr Data.

51.  INT. MARAAN'S QUARTERS.                                
51.

     The room is empty.  After a few seconds, the door
     slides open and WORF enters, phaser in hand.

     He enters the Quarters and approaches the desk,
     staring at the read-outs that are pouring out on the
     monitor.  He taps his communicator.

                             WORF
               Worf to Bridge.

                         PICARD (V.O.)
               Picard here.

                             WORF
               Maraan is not in his Quarters.

52.  INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)                             
52.

     RIKER stares at the second level that runs around
     the matter/antimatter reactor as GEORDI and DATA
     continue to monitor the new readings.



                             DATA
               Photon bursts increasing
               geometrically.

                            GEORDI
               Whatever it is, it's coming
               through.

53.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
53.

     WORF moves down a ship's corridor.

                             WORF
                    (Into communicator)
               I am going to Engineering,
               Captain.  Worf out.

     He taps his communicator and continues down the
     corridor.

54.

     RIKER and GEORDI both stare up at the second level,
     while DATA maintains his position by the Master
     Systems Display.

                             RIKER
                         (To Geordi)
               I'm going up.  Call security.

     Geordi nods and heads for the nearest intercom.

55.  INT. TURBO-LIFT.                                       
55.

     MARAAN is standing in the turbo-lift, having removed
     a panel.  He has two of his fingers pressed against
     three wire while he manipulates a few others.

                            MARAAN
               Computer, by-pass security
               clearance for ship-board
               operations.

56.  INT. BRIDGE.                                           
56.

     PICARD is seated in his command chair, while TROI is
     beside him.  The intercom beeps and Geordi's voice
     breaks the silence.

                         GEORDI (V.O.)
               LaForge to Bridge.  Radiation
               emissions are increasing and...





     Geordi breaks off suddenly.  When he returns, his
     voice is more sharp, sounding more urgent.

                     GEORDI (V.O.) (CONT.)
               Maraan has entered Main
               Engineering.  I believe he is
               armed.

     Picard gets to his feet immediately.

                            PICARD
               Send a security detail to Main
               Engineering!  On the double!
                    (Taps communicator)
               Mr Worf!

57.  INT. CORRIDOR.                                         
57.

     WORF is standing outside a turbo-lift.  He starts
     back down the corridor, taping his communicator as
     he walks.

                             WORF
               Captain, the doors will not
               open.  The computer is not
               responding to voice commands.  I
               am proceeding to the nearest
               emergency shaft.

58.  INT. ENGINEERING.                                      
58.

     MARAAN points the phaser at RIKER

                             RIKER
               Maraan, take it easy.  No one is
               going to harm you.

     Maraan shifts his aim to DATA, who is moving towards
     him.  Data stops just behind and to the left of
     Riker.  GEORDI moves away from the intercom, keeping
     his distance from Maraan.

                            MARAAN
               Drop your phaser, Will.  Now.


     Riker doesn't move to comply, but stands his ground.

                        MARAAN (CONT.)
               I'm sorry, Will.  I don't want
               to kill you.

     Riker removes his phaser, but doesn't aim it at
     Maraan.




                             RIKER
               But you will.

                            MARAAN
               I've got no choice.  Will, I've
               got no choice.

                             RIKER
               You do.  You don't have to do
               this.

     On the second level, the duplicate Maraan arrives. 
     Riker holds his hand out.

                         RIKER (CONT.)
                  (Taking a step forward)
               Give me the phaser, Maraan.

     Maraan fires the phaser.  A beam of energy strikes
     Riker in the chest, propelling him back into Data's
     arms.

     There is a smashing sound as a Personal Access
     Display Device (PADD) shatters and there is sudden
     movement on the second level, where the duplicate
     Maraan wheels around from the reactor and begins to
     fall over the railing to the deck below.

     Data allows Riker to drop the rest of the way, to
     the deck, and grabs Riker's phaser which has dropped
     beside the dead First Officer.  Kneeling in front of
     Riker's body, Data fires the phaser at the duplicate
     Maraan just as he begins to distort.

     The beam strikes the distortion, resulting in a
     warped scream as it disappears.....

59.  INT. ENGINEERING.                                      
59.

     A large distortion suddenly appears in the air, near
     the second level railing.  MARAAN is flung out of
     the middle of the distortion and crashes to the deck
     below.

     RIKER, who is standing next to the intercom, and
     GEORDI, in the Chief Engineer's Office, are
     momentarily stunned.  And then:

                             RIKER
                (Hitting the intercom button again)
               Security alert!  We have an
               intruder in Main Engineering!





     Riker moves forward and kneels beside Maraan's body. 
     Geordi exits his office and rushes to the other side
     of the alien, taking out a tricorder.

     Maraan remains unmoving, dead.

60.  INT. SICKBAY.                                          
60.

     PICARD and RIKER listen to Dr. CRUSHER.  The body of
     MARAAN lies a few feet away, on a bio-bed.  He is
     covered with a sheet up to his shoulders.

                            CRUSHER
               There's not much I can tell you
               until I've performed a full
               autopsy.  But it seems there are
               considerable artificial
               components within his body.

                            PICARD
               Do you have any idea what they
               may have been used for?

                            CRUSHER
                     (Shakes her head)
               Whatever they composed, it was
               destroyed by the phaser blast
               that killed him.

                             RIKER
               Phaser blast?

     Crusher turns and moves to the head of the
     diagnostic table on which Maraan is lying.

                            CRUSHER
               Who or why, I don't know.  Who
               he was or what he was, I can't
               say.  Neither can he.

     Picard looks at Riker, then back at Crusher

                            PICARD
               I'll expect a full report after
               the autopsy.

                            CRUSHER
               You'll get it.  But to be
               honest, I don't think there will
               be much to tell.

     Picard nods and exits Sickbay.  Riker moves to
     follow him, but turns to take a final look at Maraan
     as Crusher covers his face with a white sheet......



61.  EXT. ENTERPRISE.                                       
61.

     The Enterprise moves away at impulse power,
     surrounded by darkness and the myriad number of
     shining points of light.

                                                       FADE
OUT.

                            THE END
