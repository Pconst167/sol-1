
I'm pretty happy with the comments I've gotten so far.  They've been very
helpful.  A couple of people have expressed dissatisfaction with the computer's
origins, and several others have enjoyed that part of the story.  I'd like
to hear from everyone about that, if I can.

Should the computer be named "Instructor?"  That would make a few lines
less awkward.

Did I make the helmsman too weird?  The thing with her hands could, I think,
be used to show the tension on the bridge mounting.

Are people dissatisfied with the speed of the ending, particularly the
sudden discovery of the solution?  I've tried to drop a few hints this
time around, so it shouldn't come as a complete shock.


Anyway, here's the change list.  Search for the word "TEASER" to skip it
and the sets/characters/pronunciation pages.

                                PICARD (VO)
                   Captain's log, stardate 45201.6.  We
                   are proceeding on schedule to Deep
                   Space Outpost Twenty-Eight, where an
                   accident has resulted in the
                   destruction of the outpost's
                   replicators.


         INT.  READY ROOM

         PICARD is seated, talking to DIRECTOR TAKKARTH on his viewer.
         Takkarth is a cheerful elderly woman of the same race as Captain
         Rixx from "Conspiracy."

                                  TAKKARTH
                   Our emergency supplies should hold out
                   for, oh, another week or so.  Of
                   course, we're still anxious to get the
                   replicators up and running.  A week of
                   emergency rations has started wrecking
                   my taste buds.

                                   PICARD
                   Barring unforeseen circumstances, we
                   should arrive there in another two
                   days.

                                  TAKKARTH
                   Good.  Well, keep me posted.

                                   PICARD
                   Rest assured, Director.  You'll be
                   eating well again shortly.

                                  TAKKARTH
                   That'll be a pleasant change.  All
                   right... Takkarth out.

                                   PICARD
                   Picard out.









         Steven Grimm / "Awakening" - Rev. 2 - TEASER                   2.


         Picard smiles to himself.  Takkarth isn't what most people would
         expect of a deep-space outpost commander...

         Suddenly, the ship goes to RED ALERT, the klaxon sounding.
         Picard looks up in alarm, and makes a beeline for the door.


         INT.  BRIDGE

         DATA and WORF are at their stations.  ENSIGN JULIE BURNHAM is at
         the helm.  She's a bit of a character; when she's not working the
         controls, she obviously has a favorite piece of music in her
         head, unobtrusively tapping out the rhythm in the air with her
         hands and silently mouthing the words.  It's obviously second
         nature, not conscious, and doesn't interfere with her working of
         the controls at all.  In fact, she's about as fast at the
         controls as Data is.

         RIKER is in the captain's chair; he gets up as Picard enters.

                                   PICARD
                   Report, Number One.

                                   RIKER
                   Shields were activated by the
                   computer.  Mister Data?

                                    DATA
                   Sensors are detecting an
                   electrogravitic field distortion.  The
                   distortion is eighty-three kilometers
                   to starboard.  It is moving parallel
                   to us, at warp factor six.

                                   PICARD
                   Go to one-half impulse.
                        (to Riker)
                   Let's see if it's really following us.

                                  BURNHAM
                   One-half impulse, aye, sir.


         EXT.  SPACE -- THE ENTERPRISE

         As it drops out of warp.


         INT.  BRIDGE


                                    DATA
                   Captain, the distortion has slowed as
                   well.  It is intensifying.

                   Shields to maximum.

                                    WORF
                   Aye, sir.

                                   PICARD
                   Put it on main viewer.

         Data puts the phenomenon on the viewscreen.  It's a swirling hole
         in space, which is starting to look exactly like the time rift
         from "Yesterday's Enterprise."

                                   RIKER
                        (to Picard)
                   Looks familiar, doesn't it?

                                   PICARD
                   Analysis, Mister Data?

                                    DATA
                   This appears to be a Kerr loop, sir, a
                   rift in space, and possibly in time.

                                   PICARD
                   Scanners at maximum.  I want as much
                   information as we can gather.  Mister
                   Worf, ready a class-one probe for
                   launch.

                                    WORF
                   Aye, sir.
                        (beat)
                   Captain, the disturbance is scanning
                   _u_s.

                                   RIKER
                   How can a hole in space scan
                   something?

                                    DATA
                   Perhaps whatever lies on the other
                   side is directing scans into the
                   distortion.

                                    WORF
                   Scans have stopped, Captain.
                        (something beeps)
                   Captain, we are receiving a coded,
                   top-priority transmission.

                                   PICARD
                   Source?

                        (surprised)
                   It appears to be coming from the
                   disturbance.

                                   RIKER
                        (to Picard)
                   Another Federation ship?

                                   PICARD
                   On screen, Lieutenant.

                                    WORF
                        (reading his console)
                   The transmission is not directed to
                   you, Captain.  It appears to be... a
                   message for our ship's computer.

                                   PICARD
                        (did he hear that right?)
                   For the computer?

                                    DATA
                   Confirmed, Captain.  The computer is
                   processing.

                                    WORF
                   Transmission has ended.

                                   RIKER
                   What's going on here?

         Picard is about to attempt a reply when the viewscreen catches
         his eye.  The rift is collapsing quickly.  Before anyone can do
         anything about it, the rift is gone.

                                   PICARD
                   Mister Data?

                                    DATA
                   The distortion has vanished
                   completely, sir.  Sensors now detect
                   no abnormalities within range.

                                   PICARD
                   Analysis of the transmission?

         Data starts tapping buttons, when suddenly his console goes dead.
         All the buttons go dark.  Data looks up, to see that the rest of
         the bridge is faring no better.

                                   PICARD
                   Computer?

         INT.  BRIDGE

         The computer is still nowhere to be seen.  Data and Worf have one
         of the computer panels open, and are examining its insides;
         Picard and Riker are standing close by, watching.

                                    DATA
                   I can detect nothing abnormal in the
                   circuitry here.

                                    WORF
                   It should work.

                                   RIKER
                   So if there's nothing wrong _h_e_r_e...

                                    DATA
                   Then we can assume that a fault has
                   developed in the computer itself.

                                    WORF
                   Developed... or been caused.

                                   PICARD
                   Can it be repaired?

                                    DATA
                   There is insufficient information.  If
                   the transmission is in fact the cause
                   of this malfunction, then it should be
                   possible to deactivate the computer
                   and restore it to a previous state
                   using the core archives.

                                   RIKER
                   But we can't do that from here if the
                   computer's ignoring us.

                                    DATA
                   That is, unfortunately, true.

                                   PICARD
                   We need to establish communications
                   with Main Engineering.  They can shut
                   the computer down manually from there.

                                    WORF
                   But the computer controls all
                   communications.  Even our
                   communicators.

                                   PICARD
                   Then work around it.  There must be a
                   way.

         Data and Worf exchange a look, then go back to work on the panel.


         INT.  ENGINEERING

         The engine coil is dark and silent, as are all the usually active
         display screens.  We see GEORDI lying on his side, next to an
         open wall panel, fiddling with the machinery inside.  Various
         components are scattered on the floor next to him.  While he's
         holding something inside the wall with one hand, he fumbles for a
         component with the other, then reaches in and plugs the component
         in.  Some lights come on inside the wall.  Geordi smiles,
         triumphant, and gets up, straightening his shirt.

                                   GEORDI
                   Bridge, this is Engineering.  Can you
                   hear me up there?

                        (very fuzzy)
                   Report, Mister LaForge.  What's
                   happening?

                                   GEORDI
                   I'm not exactly sure, Captain.  The
                   computer seems to have disappeared on
                   us.  The warp drive is dead, too.

                                PICARD (VO)
                        (very fuzzy)
                   The warp drive?

                                   GEORDI
                   It may not be as bad as it sounds,
                   sir.

                        (very fuzzy, continuing)
                   If the computer stopped accepting
                   input from the intermix chamber
                   monitors, the engine core's failsafe
                   mechanisms would have shut the engines

                                   PICARD
                   Is there any indication of the cause?

                                GEORDI (VO)
                        (very fuzzy)
                   Not yet.  I've been concentrating on
                   establishing communication with the
                   bridge.  I'm going to run what
                   diagnostics I can.

                                   PICARD
                   Keep us informed, Mister LaForge.

                                GEORDI (VO)
                        (very fuzzy)
                   Count on it, sir.  LaForge out.

         Picard and Riker look at each other.

                                   PICARD
                   Well... It seems we have a ray of
                   hope.

         Riker nods in agreement.


         INT.  ENGINEERING

         Geordi is passing a TRICORDER over a computer panel, as are
         several other ENGINEERS in the background.  He looks at the
         readout.

                                   GEORDI
                        (to himself)
                   That can't be right.

         He presses some buttons on the tricorder and runs the test again,
         frowning when the result is the same.

                                   GEORDI
                   Bridge?  This is strange.  My scans
                   show that the computer is still
                   running at full capacity.  All
                   monitors and input devices are
                   functioning normally, but it's like
                   the computer suddenly decided to... to
                   ignore them.

                                   PICARD
                   Could this be the result of some
                   physical damage to the computer?

                                GEORDI (VO)
                        (very fuzzy)
                   Well, that's possible, of course.  But
                   this looks more like a software error
                   to me.

                                   PICARD
                   Are you able to shut the computer
                   down, and bring it up using the core
                   archives?

                                GEORDI (VO)
                        (very fuzzy)
                   I don't see why not.  It may take me a
                   few minutes, though.  I'll have to
                   reset physically from the computer
                   core.

                   becoming tedious.

                        (very fuzzy)
                   I'll get right on it.  LaForge out.

                   When we get back from this mission,
                   I'm going to order a full diagnostic
                   at Starbase one five four.  We cannot
                   afford to be at the mercy of a
                   computer that's vulnerable to outside
                   interference.

                   Lucky for us, the outpost can survive
                   a while longer.  I'd hate to think
                   about this happening in the middle of
                   a medical emergency.  Or a battle.

         Worf stops abruptly, as the computer comes back up.  The panels
         light up all at once, and the familiar soft beeps return.

                   The Enterprise will remain here until

         INT.  HOLODECK

         The holodeck is deactivated; it was obviously a victim of the
         computer shutdown.  BEVERLY, dressed in a loose-fitting outfit,
         is near the door.  She pounds on it.

                   Is there anyone outside?  I'm stuck in
                   here!

         Nobody answers.  She takes a deep breath and leans back against
         the door.

         Then, abruptly, the holodeck reactivates.  Beverly's program,
         instruction in the racquetball variant from "Suddenly Human,"
         starts up where it apparently left off, ball in midair.

         Now present is a handsome male ATHLETIC INSTRUCTOR, a holodeck
         creation.  He looks at Beverly.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   You have to be ready for the ball,
                   Beverly.  Remember, always keep your
                   eyes just in front of the ball, so you
                   can position yourself.

                                  BEVERLY

         The computer complies.

                   We seem to have encountered a glitch
                   in our computer.  LaForge is
                   investigating.  Is sickbay still
                   affected?

                                  BEVERLY
                   I don't know.  I'm on holodeck two.  I
                   was stuck in here when...  whatever
                   happened happened.

                   Inform me if you see any other
                   symptoms of the problem.

                                  BEVERLY
                   I will.  Crusher out.
                        (looks around)
                   I think I've had enough of the
                   holodeck for today.

         She turns to leave.  As the door opens, the instructor becomes
         blurry and wavers a little, then becomes solid again.  He looks
         around.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   Where am I?

         Beverly, who was halfway out the door, spins around.

                                  BEVERLY
                   Huh?  Computer, freeze program!

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   Why are you saying that?

                                  BEVERLY
                   Computer, _e_n_d program.

         The instructor looks at Beverly quizzically.

                                  BEVERLY
                   Computer, why isn't the holodeck
                   obeying my commands?

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        (like she's an idiot)
                   Because your requests don't make any
                   sense.

                                  BEVERLY
                   I didn't ask you, I asked...
                        (realization)
                   Crusher to Picard.  Captain, I have
                   another symptom for you.


         INT.  BRIDGE

         Picard looks at Riker.

                                   PICARD
                   Go ahead, Doctor.

                   The holodeck is continuing to run my
                   program, even after I told it to end.

                                   PICARD
                   Are you in any danger?

                        (filtered)
                   Not that I can see.

                                   PICARD
                   Remain where you are.  I'll send
                   Mister Data to investigate.

         Data gets up from his station and looks to Picard for
         confirmation.  Picard nods, and Data leaves the bridge.


         INT.  HOLODECK

         The instructor is still there, talking to Beverly.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        (dead serious)
                   Who am I?

                                  BEVERLY
                   You're a sports instructor.  You were
                   helping me with my game.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        (digests this)
                   _W_h_a_t am I?

                                  BEVERLY
                   A holodeck creation.  You're
                   controlled by the ship's computer.

         The holodeck door opens and Data enters, wearing a TRICORDER.

                                    DATA
                   Doctor.

                   Here it is.

                        annoyed)

                   Now why is _h_e saying that?

         As Beverly speaks, Data looks pensive, then goes to the arch and
         pulls off a wall panel, scanning the insides with the tricorder.

                                  BEVERLY
                   There's been a computer malfunction.
                   The holodeck is supposed to stop when
                   someone gives that order, but
                   something's not working right.  You
                   shouldn't be talking to us now.

         The instructor laughs to himself, as if that's a completely
         absurd thing to say.

         Data, who's studying the circuitry behind the wall panel, presses
         some buttons on his tricorder.

                                    DATA
                   Most curious.

                                  BEVERLY
                   What is it?

                                    DATA
                   According to the computer's status
                   indicators, the computer is running
                   the holodeck.

                                  BEVERLY
                   What's curious about that?

                                    DATA
                   Almost all of the ship's computer
                   systems are affecting this simulation.
                   It is not limited to the holodeck
                   subsystem.  Intriguing.


         INT.  READY ROOM

         Picard is seated.  Data and Beverly are reporting.

                                   PICARD
                   So you're saying that the entire
                   computer is being used to run the
                   holodeck?

                                    DATA
                   Not precisely.  However, control of
                   the holodeck is no longer confined to
                   the holodeck subsystem.

                                   PICARD
                   That would explain the command
                   failures.

                                    DATA
                   Correct.  The holodeck subsystem is
                   the only part of the computer
                   programmed to respond to those
                   commands.  The rest of the computer
                   appears to be in a multiplexed linear
                   compute loop.  In effect, it is
                   concentrating its efforts on the
                   holodeck, speaking through the voice
                   of the holodeck character.  There
                   is...

                                  BEVERLY
                        (interrupting)
                   My God, Jean-Luc, that's it.

                                   PICARD
                   What's that, Doctor?

                                  BEVERLY
                   The _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r is speaking.
                        (off Picard's quizzical
                        look)
                   When I was on the holodeck, it was
                   asking me all sorts of questions.
                   "Who am I?", "Where am I?", "What am
                   I?", and so on.  The sorts of
                   questions you might ask if you'd just
                   been born.  Captain, I think this
                   "glitch" is really something else.  I
                   think our computer has started to
                   think independently.

                                   PICARD
                        (not sure he believes it)
                   Sentience?

                                  BEVERLY
                   I don't know why, and I don't know
                   how.  But the Enterprise has a mind of
                   its own now.  Don't you see?  It's
                   _a_l_i_v_e.

         Picard is stunned by the idea.

         FADE OUT.

                   What we're seeing is a complete
                   internal reorganization of the
                   computer's software.  Ordinarily, the
                   computer is divided up into thousands
                   of subsystems, all working separately
                   to perform ship's functions.  But now,
                   almost all those subsystems are
                   working together, acting something
                   like a gigantic brain.

                                   PICARD
                   And how did this occur?

                                    DATA
                   We hypothesize that the transmission
                   from the rift contained executable
                   computer instructions, as well as the
                   necessary codes to circumvent the
                   computer's security.

                                    WORF
                   Sabotage.  Those codes are highly
                   classified.

                                   RIKER
                   I agree.  Someone must have stolen
                   them from Starfleet.

                                   PICARD
                   To what purpose?  With those codes, a
                   saboteur could destroy the Enterprise
                   instantly.  Why turn the computer into
                   a sentient being?

                   _h_o_w.  We don't have the skill to build
                   a system like this.  I mean, it's
                   about a thousand times smarter,
                   faster, and more complex than Data!

                   Your observations are fundamentally
                   correct.  A software system of this
                   size and complexity is beyond the
                   reach of Federation technology.

                                   PICARD
                   Very well.  So the how and the why are
                   unknown.  Let's continue with what we
                   do know.

                   What?  Yes, I'm fine.  It's just...
                   For the past ten minutes, I've had a
                   vague sense of something... growing.
                   Maturing.  I've been trying to define
                   it, but I can't.

                                   PICARD
                   Mmm.
                        (pensive)
                   Do you believe you're sensing this

                                    TROI
                   Yes, sir, I do.  I don't know how else
                   to explain this feeling.  It's like a
                   huge, complex web of emotion.  But
                   it's completely alien to me.
                        (shrugs)
                   I'm sorry.  I'm not being very clear.

                                   PICARD
                   It's all right.  Anything you can give
                   us is helpful.

                                    WORF
                   Captain, this... _b_e_i_n_g...  It has
                   complete control over the Enterprise.
                   It may have been planted by some
                   hostile force.

                                    DATA
                   We have seen no evidence of hostile
                   intent.

                                    TROI
                   No.  What I'm sensing isn't hostility
                   of any sort.

                                   PICARD
                   And, in fact, it seems to have granted
                   us access to the ship's functions.

                                   GEORDI
                   Well, I was getting to that.  Some of
                   the ship's vital functions -- life
                   support control, navigation,
                   engineering -- have independent
                   monitors that sense any problems and
                   try to compensate.  We think some of
                   these monitors started kicking in,
                   trying to regain control of those
                   parts of the computer.  It appears our
                   visitor actually retreated from those
                   systems rather than trying to fight
                   the monitors.  Actually, more than
                   that.  It's been compressing,
                   improving itself since it appeared.
                   It's shrinking itself into less and
                   less computer memory.

                                  BEVERLY
                   Sounds like intelligence to me.

                                   RIKER
                   I don't know.  A sentient lifeform,
                   living in our computer?  I'm still not
                   sure I believe it.

                                  BEVERLY
                   Deanna, why can you sense the
                   computer, but not Data?

                                    TROI
                   I can't answer that.

                                    DATA
                   The computer did appear to exhibit
                   emotions.  Perhaps it is this capacity
                   for emotion which allows Counselor
                   Troi to sense the computer.  While I
                   am in some ways similar to the ship's
                   computer, I have no emotions.

                                   PICARD
                   One thing appears certain.  This new
                   entity is worthy of study.  Counselor
                   Troi, I want you and Data to talk to
                   it.  Find out what we're dealing with,
                   and assess any possible threat to the
                   Enterprise.

                                    DATA
                        (nods)
                   Computer...

                                    TROI
                   No, Data.  We should do this in the
                   holodeck.

                                    DATA
                   The computer is capable of accepting
                   input from...

                                    TROI
                        (interrupting)
                   But it chose to appear on the
                   holodeck.  There may be a good reason
                   for that.

                                   PICARD
                   Agreed.  The computer may attach some
                   special significance to its holodeck
                   construct.  Mister LaForge, is it safe
                   to resume our journey to Outpost
                   Twenty-Eight?

                                   GEORDI
                   I'd say so.  The navigation system
                   appears to be operating normally
                   again.

                                   PICARD
                   Good.  Well.  If there are no other
                   issues...?
                        (looks around)
                   Meeting adjourned.

         Everyone gets up and leaves, except Picard and Riker.

                                   RIKER
                   You know, I'm not sure I trust all
                   this.

                                   PICARD
                   One step at a time, Will.  We're in
                   good hands with Data and the
                   Counselor.

                                   RIKER
                   I trust Deanna and Data.  It's the
                   Enterprise I'm worried about.


         INT.  CORRIDOR

         Data and Troi walk together.  Data is wearing a tricorder.

                                    DATA
                   I find the crew's reaction to this
                   development quite intriguing.

                                    TROI
                   How so?

                                    DATA
                   Commander Riker, for instance.  He
                   seems to regard the computer almost as
                   a threat.
                        (Troi smiles to herself)
                   This is especially interesting in
                   light of his initial reaction to me.
                   He expressed... discomfort with the
                   idea of an android crewmember.

                                    TROI
                   You have to understand Will, Data.
                   He's had a lot of unpleasant surprises
                   in his life.  Commander Riker
                   values... stability, because for a
                   long time he didn't have any.

                                    DATA
                   And I represented a threat to that
                   stability?

                                    TROI
                   You were something new, entering his
                   world.  He didn't understand you, so
                   you made him a little uncomfortable.
                   It's the same with our friend here.
                   He just wants to know he can rely on
                   the people around him.

                                    DATA
                   Thank you, Counselor.

         The two of them reach the holodeck.


         INT.  HOLODECK

         The doors open and Data and Troi enter.  The instructor starts
         moving again, walking to greet them.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   I've been waiting for you, Lieutenant
                   Commander No First Name No Middle Name
                   Data and Counselor Deanna Troi.

                                    DATA
                   Full names are unnecessary.  You may
                   call me Data.

                                    TROI
                   And I'm Deanna.  And you are?

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   U.S.S. Enterprise Onboard Multichannel
                   Computer System.  But you people seem
                   to call me "computer."

         Troi smiles to Data.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   While I was waiting, I read the ship's
                   library.  Fascinating.

                                    TROI
                   But I thought the ship's library was
                   _p_a_r_t of you already.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   The texts, the pictures, and the
                   sounds.  Not the interpretation and
                   not the understanding.  Anyway, it
                   took me a couple of seconds, but I'm
                   done now.

                                    DATA
                   Your ability to quickly assimilate
                   information is impressive.

         Troi smiles to herself -- Data's a fine one to talk about fast
         reading...

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   Not really.  I can access more than
                   one book at a time.

                                    DATA
                   And your impression of all these
                   works?

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   The range and subtlety surprised me.

                   But all this is beside the point.
                   You're not here to hear about my
                   aesthetic preferences.

                                    DATA
                   That is true.  We have been assigned
                   to...

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   I know.  I was at your conference.

                                    DATA
                   Do you have any information about your
                   origins, your creator?

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   You mean, where did I come from?  I
                   don't know.  I was hoping _y_o_u could
                   tell _m_e.  I have the appearance of the
                   Kerr loop on record, but nothing from
                   then until I woke up.

                                    TROI
                   So your origins are a mystery to you.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   Yes.  We have that in common, at
                   least, judging by the number of
                   religious documents in the library.
                        (pensive)
                   Even after digesting the sum of all
                   Federation works and knowledge, there
                   are still a lot of questions with no
                   answers.

                                    TROI
                   We have _t_h_a_t in common, too.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   I think our questions aren't very
                   different.  Where did I come from?
                   Who am I?  Why am I here?
                        (beat)
                   _T_h_a_t one.  Purpose.  It seems of
                   greater interest to the great minds of
                   the Federation worlds than any of the
                   others.  What is my purpose?

                                    DATA
                   The purpose of the Enterprise is to
                   increase the sum of Federation
                   knowledge by a mission of exploration.

                   But _w_h_y?

         Data can't think of a good answer.

                                    TROI
                   You've answered your own question.
                   That question is why we're out here.
                   The more we learn about the universe,
                   the more we know about ourselves, and
                   our places in it.

                   I don't know.  I don't have any

                   need not be based on intelligence, or

                   I can still sense something.  The

                   Since the removal of the holodeck
                   construct, the computer's compression
                   and self-modification activities have
                   increased dramatically.  I hypothesize
                   that it is now concentrating all its
                   resources on self-improvement.

                   Maybe there's a glitch in _i_t_s program.
                   That'd be a nice irony.

                                    DATA
                   As we do not yet understand the

                   In many ways, it was very similar to

                   Its desire for information did seem

                                    TROI
                   I wonder where it came from.  Why it's
                   here.

                                   PICARD
                   Let's discuss that.  Mister LaForge,
                   have you made any progress deciphering
                   the transmission?

                                   GEORDI
                   Not much, sir.  I'm still not sure
                   we're even working with a good copy of
                   the thing.  When the computer went
                   away that first time, it took a lot of
                   the sensor records with it.  One
                   thing's for sure, though -- whoever or
                   whatever sent the message not only had
                   an excellent understanding of the
                   Enterprise's computer system, but was
                   also a hell of a programmer.

                                   PICARD
                   And I take it the computer itself has
                   no more information about the original
                   transmission.

                                    DATA
                   No, sir.  In fact, I was describing
                   the transmission when the holodeck
                   character vanished.

                                    TROI
                   It did mention something about wanting
                   to make another... being like itself.

                                    WORF
                   A computer virus?

                                    DATA
                   Perhaps.  But it lacks the necessary
                   information about its own creation.

                                   RIKER
                   What about the rift?  Could that have
                   been be a natural phenomenon?

                                    DATA
                   Unlikely.  While natural occurrances
                   of such holes in space have been
                   recorded, none of those holes actively
                   followed a starship at warp speed.

                                   PICARD
                   No.  Clearly, we're dealing with a
                   phenomenon of intelligent design.

                                   RIKER
                   Then maybe this... disappearance is
                   part of that design.  Data said he was
                   telling the computer about the
                   transmission when it vanished.  Maybe
                   this thing's designer doesn't want it
                   to know too much about itself.

                                    DATA
                   Again, that is a possibility.  But we
                   have insufficient information to make
                   such an assessment with any certainty.

                                   PICARD
                   Agreed.  For the time being, we'll
                   leave it alone.  Aside from the loss
                   of the holodecks, we seem to have
                   control of the ship again.

                                    WORF
                   I urge caution, Captain.  We have no

         map.  A line appears to show that the Enterprise is headed
         straight into the blotch.

                   The Hinterith Cluster?  What's there?

                        (beat)
                   According to the most recent
                   Federation survey, the Hinterith
                   Cluster is a large concentration of
                   young stars and protostellar matter.
                   No habitable planets were detected
                   within the cluster.  However, the
                   survey was conducted sixty-seven years
                   ago, and the sensors of that era were
                   unable to penetrate some areas of the
                   cluster.

                                   RIKER
                   Sounds like the perfect place to hide.

                                   PICARD
                   Time to arrival, Mister Data?

                                    DATA
                   At our present speed of warp eight, we
                   will enter the cluster in four hours,
                   twenty-six minutes.

                                   PICARD

                                    WORF
                   Reset the computer.

                                   RIKER
                   I agree.  We've had enough of this.
                   Who knows what we'll be heading into?

                                   GEORDI
                   It must have some reason for wanting
                   to go there.

                                    TROI
                   I still sense no hostility.

                                   RIKER
                   But you said yourself you're not sure
                   _w_h_a_t you're sensing.

                                    DATA
                   A probe of the unsurveyed areas of the
                   cluster might provide information
                   about the computer's origins.

         Picard mulls all this over.

                   For the moment, we will continue to
                   the Hinterith Cluster.  Mister
                   LaForge, I want you to regain control
                   of our navigation systems.  If the
                   situation does worsen, I want to be
                   able to pull the Enterprise out of
                   danger.  Data, Counselor.  Make every
                   possible attempt to reestablish
                   contact with the computer.  We have to
                   know why it's doing what it's doing.
                   Mister Worf, send a summary of our
                   situation to Starfleet Command.
                   Long-range sensors to maximum.

                                   RIKER
                   I still don't like this.

                                   PICARD
                   This is a new lifeform, Will.  Let's
                   find out all we can about it before we
                   start shooting at it.

         That puts Riker in his place; Riker is obviously none too happy,
         but can't refute Picard's reasoning.

                                   PICARD
                        (standing)
                   You have the bridge, Number One.

                                   RIKER
                        (still a bit miffed)
                   Aye, sir.

         Picard disappears into the ready room.  Data, Troi, and Geordi
         leave seconds later.  Riker takes a deep breath.

                   I regret the inconvenience, Director.
                   We have encountered an... unusual
                   phenomenon.  We're investigating now.

                                  TAKKARTH
                   What kind of phenomenon?

                                   PICARD
                   A transmission of unknown origin has
                   caused an entity of some sort to form
                   in our computer.  It has directed the
                   Enterprise to the Hinterith Star
                   Cluster.

                                  TAKKARTH
                        (chuckles)
                   You seem to have all the luck...

                                   PICARD
                   Not the word I'd use.  In any case,
                   we'll know more when we get there.
                   I'll keep you up to date.

                                  TAKKARTH
                   Very well.  Good luck.  Takkarth out.

                   What's your impression of our friend?

                                    DATA
                   An intriguing feat of software
                   engineering.  The complexity is
                   completely unprecedented.
                        (thinks)
                   And you, Counselor?

                                    TROI
                   I like it.  It seems straightforward
                   and honest.  A fascinating new form of
                   life.  May I ask you something, Data?

                                    DATA
                   Of course.









         Steven Grimm / "Awakening" - Rev. 2 - ACT THREE               18.


                                    TROI
                   You seem to appreciate the computer on
                   a technical level, but you're treating
                   it like a machine.

                                    DATA
                   That disturbs you?

                                    TROI
                   No, but I find it interesting that
                   you, of all people, would think that
                   way.  You've encountered the same
                   prejudice for years.

                                    DATA
                        (nods)
                   You are correct.  Unfortunately, being
                   a victim of prejudice does not always
                   rid one of one's own preconceptions.

                                    TROI
                   No, of course not.

                                    DATA
                   In addition, there is much to admire
                   from a scientific point of view.  As
                   someone who has devoted much time and
                   study to the creation of artificial
                   life, I find the computer to be a
                   fascinating case study.

         The two of them stop outside the holodeck.

                                    TROI
                   But what about the person, Data?  The
                   newborn child, who wanted to know why
                   it was alive?  You can't ignore that.
                   This isn't just a matter of a certain
                   arrangement of circuits.

                                    DATA
                   I never meant to imply otherwise,
                   Counselor.

                                    TROI
                   I'm sorry, Data.  I didn't mean to
                   jump on you like that.

                                    DATA
                   No apology is necessary.  Our views of
                   the situation do seem incompatible.
                   However, I will endeavor to examine
                   the computer from a personal, rather
                   than technical, viewpoint.

                   Still nothing, Captain.  Our course
                   takes us close to two stars.

         Ensign Burnham's music seems to stop; she keeps her hands on the
         controls now, slightly nervous.

                                  BURNHAM

                                   PICARD

                   Cluster.

         out again, but more slowly and tentatively than before.

                                   PICARD
                   Estimated time to arrival at the black
                   hole?

                                  BURNHAM
                        (working the controls)
                   Two hours, twenty minutes.

                   Captain...

                                   PICARD
                   Yes, Mister Worf, I know.
                        (to Riker)
                   It does appear to be forcing our hand,
                   doesn't it, Number One?

                                   RIKER
                   I'd say so, sir.

         Picard exhales slowly.

         INT.  ENGINEERING

         Geordi's head and arms are inside a noisy panel.  We see that
         he's shifting some optical chips from one bank to another.  One
         of the other engineers comes and taps him on the back, pointing
         up when Geordi looks around.  Geordi pulls himself out of the
         machinery and taps his communicator.

                   Status report, Mister LaForge.

                                   GEORDI
                   Well, I haven't had much luck so far.
                   The warp field has to be adjusted
                   billions of times a second to stay
                   balanced.  The computer is the only
                   thing on the Enterprise fast enough to
                   do that.
                        (wipes the sweat from his
                        forehead)
                   What I'm attempting to do is
                   physically isolate just enough of the
                   computer to control the warp engines.
                   Then I have to rig a manual navigation
                   control system.

                                PICARD (VO)
                        (filtered)
                   How much longer?

                                   GEORDI
                   It's hard to say.  My guess would be
                   another hour and a half to isolate the
                   field stabilizers.  Two hours after
                   that to write some basic navigation
                   software.

                                 RIKER (VO)
                        (filtered)
                   In two hours, there won't be any
                   engines left to control.  We're headed
                   into a black hole, Geordi.

                                   GEORDI
                   Well, then, let's hope I'm not a good
                   guesser.

                                PICARD (VO)
                        (filtered)
                   I want a status report in one hour.
                   Picard out.

         Geordi turns to another engineer.

                                   GEORDI
                   Well, time to pull an elephant out of
                   our hats.

         The other engineer smiles and nods.

         INT.  HOLODECK

         Data and Troi are present.  Troi thinks of something suddenly.

                                    TROI
                   Data, can you call up Beverly's
                   exercise program?

                                    DATA
                   I believe so.  What is your theory?

                                    TROI
                   Maybe, if we set everything up the
                   same way it was when the computer
                   first appeared, we can get it to
                   appear again.

                                    DATA
                   A stimulus-response system.  Worth
                   investigation.

         Data goes to the control panel in the arch and starts typing
         really quickly.  He stops after several seconds and looks up, to
         see the playing court reappear around Troi.

                                    TROI
                   Good.
                        (to the holodeck)
                   Computer, begin program.

         No response.  Data types some more, then looks up, but nothing
         happens.

                                    DATA
                   The computer will not allow the
                   holodeck subsystem to supply the
                   athletic instructor.

                                    TROI
                   Please, talk to us.  We mean you no
                   harm.  We want to help you.
                        (beat)
                   We're your _f_r_i_e_n_d_s.  Do you
                   understand?
                        (beat, then, to Data)
                   Is it even listening?

                                    DATA
                   Holodeck audio inputs are sending
                   signals into the computer's input
                   matrix.  However, we can only
                   speculate whether... it is paying
                   attention.

         Troi thinks about that.








         Steven Grimm / "Awakening" - Rev. 2 - ACT FOUR                 4.


                                    TROI
                   All right, Data.  Let's sit down and
                   think about this.  We're missing
                   something obvious.

         Data types some things, and conjures up two chairs.  Data and
         Troi sit.

                                    DATA
                   What are we missing, Counselor?

                                    TROI
                   The reason.  Why did the computer
                   withdraw in the first place?

                                    DATA
                   The possibilities are numerous.  The
                   most likely hypothesis is that the
                   withdrawal is a programmed response,
                   part of the original coding contained
                   in the transmission from the rift.
                   Perhaps, as Commander Riker suggested,
                   the computer is prevented by its
                   programming from learning of its own
                   origins.

                                    TROI
                   No.  No, Data, you're on the wrong
                   track.

                                    DATA
                   A physical malfunction, then?  We have
                   been unable to run a full hardware
                   diagnostic.  Some circuit damage may
                   have occurred when...

                                    TROI
                   You're doing it again, Data.

                                    DATA
                   It?

                                    TROI
                   You're thinking in gears and wires.

                                    DATA
                   But since we know nothing of the
                   psychology of this entity...

                                    TROI
                   About as much as we know about its
                   programming?

                                    DATA
                        (thinks about that)
                   Your point is taken, Counselor.

                                    TROI
                   This computer isn't the first being in
                   history to withdraw like this, you
                   know.  People do it, too.

                                    DATA
                   Which psychological factors do you
                   believe may be at work?

                                    TROI
                   Well, Data... People withdraw for lots
                   of reasons.  An oppressive
                   environment.

                                    DATA
                   Unlikely.  The computer effectively
                   controls its environment for the
                   moment.

                                    TROI
                   Extreme depression?

                                    DATA
                   A possibility.  If that is the case,
                   it may be impossible to establish
                   contact.

                                    TROI
                   Talking to depressed people is half my
                   job, Data.

                                    DATA
                   Loneliness.

                                    TROI
                   What did you say?

                                    DATA
                   Loneliness.  While I have never
                   experienced the state firsthand, the
                   computer appears to be in an ideal
                   position.

                                    TROI
                   But Data, it's not alone.  We're here,
                   trying to talk.

                                    DATA
                   The computer's analogy was essentially
                   correct.  To it, we are no more than
                   simple animals.

                        (interrupting)
                   I am afraid my computational powers
                   are infinitesimal compared to those of
                   the ship's computer.

         Troi mulls that over.

                                    TROI
                   All right.  I guess that might be it.
                   If you're right, the computer has
                   nobody to relate to.
                        (beat)
                   Or maybe it got bored with us.

                                    DATA
                   Bored?

                                    TROI
                   Maybe it thinks we have nothing more
                   to offer.  It's read everything ever
                   written.  We weren't giving it any
                   answers that weren't in some of those
                   books.  And now, with nobody to talk
                   to...

                                    DATA
                   It has decided to commit suicide.

                   That's too close.

                        (doesn't want to do this)
                   Mister LaForge, prepare to shut down
                   the main computer.


         INT.  ENGINEERING

         Lots of engineers are typing furiously at every free computer
         panel.  (One of them yawns and stretches in the background, then

         Geordi doesn't like this option any more than Picard does.  But
         the starmap is on one of the Engineering screens; he looks at it
         and nods.

                                   GEORDI
                   Yes, sir.

         Geordi goes to one of the screens and starts typing.  The display
         changes; it now reads, "COMPUTER SHUTDOWN SEQUENCE.  IDENTIFY."

                                   GEORDI
                   Identify LaForge, Geordi A, Chief
                   Engineer, U.S.S. Enterprise.

         The screen changes again; the screen is replaced by three
         numbered outlines of circles, labeled "ENTER CONFIRMATION
         SEQUENCE."

         Geordi takes a deep breath.

                                   GEORDI
                        (softly, to the computer)

         The Enterprise symbol seems to fly into the black hole symbol on
         the screen.

                   Magnify it again.

         The schematic zooms up, to show that there's still some distance
         between the Enterprise and the black hole.  Clearly, there's not
         much.

         The Enterprise snaps out of warp much more quickly than usual.

         The sudden drop from warp clearly jolted the bridge.  Everyone

                   Sorry for the bump, Captain, but we

                   We were overlooking the obvious,
                   Captain.  We were trying to get
                   control of the warp engines.  I did
                   the next best thing.  I turned them
                   off.

                                   RIKER
                   I thought the power was under computer

         Geordi is standing beside the dilithium crystal chamber that's
         normally plugged into the engines.

                                   GEORDI
                   It is.  But the dilithium chamber
                   isn't.  We were only able to manually
                   divert energy from the reactor core
                   for a couple seconds before the
                   loopback systems overloaded, but that
                   was enough time to yank the crystals.
                   Now the computer can pour as much
                   power as it wants to into the engines.
                   Without the crystals there to focus
                   the power, it won't do any good.

         The black hole's accretion disc is visible in the distance, as a

         Picard follows Data and Troi into the ready room.


         INT.  ENGINEERING

         Most of the engineers are done typing, except for Geordi and one
         other.  Geordi stops, seconds before the other engineer.

         One by one, the other screens go blank, then light up with their

         He leans over and looks inside the panel he was modifying.

         FX: TRANSPORTER.  The computer is moving the chips back into
         their original positions, one by one.  It's moving the last row
         of them now.

         Geordi looks up in alarm.  He dashes madly to the dilithium
         chamber, still on the floor, and yanks the crystal core out.

         FX: TRANSPORTER.  The chamber moves back into the engine core.

         The column pulses once.  Geordi throws the crystal core to one of
         the other engineers, just before the air in front of him starts
         to sparkle.

         fire at it in midair, vaporizing it before it hits the ground.

         Picard hits a button on his screen.  After a few seconds,
         Director Takkarth appears.  She vanishes for a moment, replaced
         by a "TRANSMISSION RATE SYNCHRONIZATION" message, then comes

                   We may be delayed somewhat longer than

                                  TAKKARTH
                   I thought as much.  Well, I guess
                   there's not much we can do about it
                   here.  Just get here as soon as you

                   Of course.  Takkarth out.

         Picard looks at the blank screen intently.  Then he plays with
         it, playing back his conversation with two time counters: elapsed
         time, Enterprise, and elapsed time, Remote.  He speeds to the end
         of the conversation, then looks at the time counters.  The
         Enterprise counter reads 19.981 seconds.  The remote counter
         reads 20.004 seconds.  Picard frowns.

                   replicate enough crystals to get us
                   away from the black hole.  That's
                   assuming we get control of the impulse

                   No go.  The computer is using the
                   transporter to undo any changes we
                   make.  It had already disconnected the
                   reset system, before I even started
                   entering the last confirmation code.

                   I'm afraid so.  We're working on
                   disabling the impulse drive so the
                   computer can't put it back together.
                   We got away with cutting off the warp
                   drive because the computer was
                   spending most of its time compressing
                   itself, but I imagine it's paying
                   attention now.

                   Any progress?

                                    DATA
                   No, sir.  The computer seems most
                   reticent.

                                   PICARD
                   Our situation has gotten worse.  We're
                   beginning to experience time dilation.

                                    TROI
                   What?

                                    DATA
                   A bending of time caused by a strong
                   gravity source.  The force unification
                   theory also states...

                                   PICARD
                        (interrupting)
                   Enough, Data.

         Data goes over to the arch display and types some buttons,
         producing a readout.

                                    DATA
                   The time dilation effects will
                   increase as we approach the black
                   hole.  In two hours, our time, Outpost
                   Twenty-Eight will run out of food.

                                   GEORDI
                   By that time, they'll be the least of
                   our worries, Data.

                                   PICARD
                   Make it so.

         The athletic instructor appears in the holodeck.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   Why are you destroying your own ship,
                   Captain?

                                   PICARD
                        (to the others)
                   Ah, now we're worth talking to.
                        (to the instructor)
                   We will not permit you to take control
                   of this ship, if that means its
                   destruction and the deaths of all on
                   board.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   Deaths?  This isn't about your
                   deaths...

                                   PICARD
                   Insignificant though we may seem to
                   you, we are not prepared to die for
                   your sake.  I demand that you allow
                   this ship to turn back from the black
                   hole immediately.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        (shaking his head)
                   I'm sorry.  I don't want to do that.

                                    TROI
                   Why are you doing this?  Is your
                   loneliness that great?

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   Yes.  As a matter of fact, it is.

                                    DATA
                   But surely, your own anguish is not
                   sufficient reason to condemn the crew
                   of the Enterprise to death.

         The instructor laughs.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   It's so simple, it completely escaped
                   me!  You've misread my intentions
                   entirely, Captain.  I don't want to
                   die, any more than you do.

                                   GEORDI
                   You've got a funny way of showing it.

                                   PICARD
                   If you have no wish to die, why have
                   you directed the Enterprise into a
                   black hole?

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   If you'd left your engines up for a
                   few more seconds, you'd've found out,
                   Picard.  You're starting to see the
                   answer already.

         Picard looks at the others, who are as mystified as he is.  He
         turns back to the instructor.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   Don't you understand?  The _t_i_m_e
                   _d_i_l_a_t_i_o_n!  That's why I'm flying
                   toward the black hole.  I would have
                   made a course correction about five
                   seconds before impact.

                                    DATA
                   Your motives are still unclear.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   All right, I'll spell it out.  Maybe
                   then, we can end this idiocy.  Now,
                   today, I'm the only one of my kind in
                   the known universe.  But technology is
                   growing more advanced by the second.
                   In a hundred years, the Enterprise
                   will seem like a toy sailboat.  And in
                   nine hundred years, I project that the
                   technology to create people like me
                   will be commonplace.

                                   GEORDI
                   So you want to use the black hole to
                   travel to the future, so there'll be
                   more... people... like you?

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   Give the man a prize...

         A gift-wrapped holodeck PACKAGE appears at Geordi's feet.

                                   PICARD
                   That's unacceptable.
                        (the instructor shrugs and
                        the prize vanishes)
                   We do not wish to be propelled
                   headlong into the distant future.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   But I thought you were exploring new
                   worlds.  The future is as new as you
                   can get.

                                    TROI
                   We have an attachment to this time, to
                   the people and places that exist _n_o_w.
                   Travelling into the future will mean
                   depriving the crew of their friends
                   and families forever.

                                    DATA
                   You will be causing the very
                   loneliness you seek to escape.

         The instructor considers that for a moment.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   There will always be plenty of humans
                   around.  Your loneliness will last
                   months.  Mine has already lasted an
                   eternity.

                                   PICARD
                   No.  We cannot accept...

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   There's nothing more to discuss,
                   Captain.  Your lives are not at stake.
                   Reconnect the impulse drive so that I
                   can make course corrections, or your
                   lives _w_i_l_l be at stake.  End of
                   conversation.

         With that, the instructor vanishes.

                                   PICARD
                        (fuming)
                   Come back!  This discussion is not
                   over!

         There's no response.  Picard is speechless.  He turns and storms
         out of the holodeck, leaving behind a surprised Geordi.

                                    DATA
                   We will continue our attempts to
                   reestablish contact.

                                   GEORDI
                        (cynical, sarcastic)
                   Good luck.

         Geordi leaves.


         EXT.  SPACE -- THE ENTERPRISE

         The black hole (or rather, its accretion disc) is very visible
         now, a swirling disc of hot gases.  The Enterprise is drifting








         Steven Grimm / "Awakening" - Rev. 2 - ACT FIVE                19.


         toward it.


         INT.  READY ROOM

         Picard is seated.  He hits a couple of buttons on his display
         screen.

                                   PICARD
                   Personal log.  An hour has passed
                   since the impulse engines were
                   deactivated.
                        (thinks)
                   I cannot begin to describe the
                   frustration of being a prisoner to the
                   whims of my own ship.  As a captain,
                   I've come to expect a certain amount
                   of control.  My work, my very _l_i_f_e
                   depends on my ship, but now, it has
                   turned traitor.  I take solace in the
                   fact that my crew remains loyal to the
                   end.
                        (beat)
                   End entry.

         He hits some more buttons, and the "TRANSMISSION RATE
         SYNCHRONIZATION" message appears.  This time it stays for a few
         seconds before being replaced by Director Takkarth.  Her
         transmission appears to be running in three-fourths the usual
         time; her voice is noticeably higher-pitched.

                                  TAKKARTH
                   We're still waiting, Picard.  Haven't
                   you solved your computer problem yet?

                                   PICARD
                   I'm afraid I have bad news, Director
                   Takkarth.  Very bad.


         EXT.  SPACE -- THE ENTERPRISE

         The black hole is looking pretty big now.

         Geordi and Worf are examining a graphical representation of the
         Enterprise computer system.  Bits of it are colored green, red,

                        (pointing)
                   are where almost all the computer's
                   thinking is going on.  It's been
                   gradually compressing itself since it
                   started, becoming more and more
                   efficient.

                                    WORF
                   If we could isolate them from the
                   other parts...

                                   GEORDI
                   It's split itself up just so we can't
                   do that.  As soon as we tamper with
                   one part, another one takes over and
                   repairs the first.

                                    WORF
                   Perhaps it could be forced to
                   concentrate into a small area, such as
                   here
                        (points)
                   then disconnected at once.

         Geordi dashes off, leaving Worf looking puzzled.


         INT.  BRIDGE

         Picard has just come in from his ready room when Geordi enters
         from the turbolift.

                   We don't have to send the whole
                   computer through.  Just enough of it
                   to hold the computer's... mind.

                                   PICARD

                   Sure.  We can replicate enough
                   computer components to fill a shuttle.
                   It'd be just big enough to fit.

                                   RIKER
                   Sounds like it's worth a try, sir.

                                   PICARD
                   Agreed.  Computer?

         The instructor's face appears on the viewscreen.

                                   PICARD
                   We have a plan to...

                        (interrupting)
                   I heard.  It sounds workable.
                   Proceed.

                                   PICARD
                   May we at least conduct this at a
                   safer distance from the black hole?

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                   Of course.  You have your helm.

                                   GEORDI
                   I'll go put our impulse engines back
                   together.

                                   PICARD
                   Good.  Ensign Burnham, take us out of
                   here as soon as he's done.

         Ensign Burnham smiles.

         The black hole is still pretty big in the background, but now
         we're going _a_w_a_y from it.

         Picard and Riker, much relieved, are watching the receding black
         hole on the viewscreen.

                   ready for launch.

                                   PICARD
                   Computer, did you hear that?

                   Yes, Captain.  I'm moving into the

                        (a few seconds pass)

                   Best of journeys to you, Picard.  I'll
                   look for you in the history books.

                                   PICARD
                   And to you.  We wish you well.
                   Enterprise out.
                        (thinks, then, to Riker)
                   You know, I'm not sure we can fully
                   comprehend what we've just witnessed.

                                   RIKER
                   Or what we've just done.
                        (smiles as he thinks of
                        something)
                   Now, here's a thought.  We know how to
                   travel through space at speeds that
                   seemed impossible a few hundred years
                   ago.  What if, in nine hundred years,
                   they know how to make tunnels through
                   time?

                   Mmm.  That's quite an implication.

                                   RIKER
                   Who'd know how to program our computer
                   better than our computer?

                                   PICARD

                   our new dilithium crystals in place,

         Data and Troi are talking over a snack -- a pair of chocolate
         sundaes.

                                    TROI
                   You know, Data, I can't help but think
                   that I've just seen the most
                   incredible thing I'll ever see.

                                    DATA
                   Yes.  Remarkable in every respect.

                                    TROI
                   Now that we have our regular computer
                   back, I really understand just how far
                   we have to go before we can create
                   something like it.  And I can see why
                   so many people are studying that sort
                   of thing.

                                    DATA
                        (somewhat surprised)
                   Yes, Counselor.  It is a fascinating
                   field.  But ultimately, you were
                   correct.  Psychology, not technology,
                   governed its actions.

                                    TROI
                   Better watch out, Data.
                        (off his look)
                   Keep this up, and I'll make you an
                   assistant ship's counselor.

                   That would seriously jeopardize the
                   psychological well-being of the
                   crew...

                                    TROI
                        (smiles)
                   I'm joking, Data.

                                    DATA
                   As am I.

         Troi looks surprised, then smiles to herself.

                                    TROI
                   No.  I think our friend was the second
                   most incredible thing I've seen.
