<H1>Science Fiction Textfiles: Star Trek</H1>
<P>
Star Trek. I should mention that Star Trek is copyright for now and forever by Paramount
Communications, who own not just Star Trek but moral rights on any Science Fiction
with weepy aliens who just want to find their inner humanity they share with the
Federation. Because of the pervasiveness of both the original series that ran from
1966-1969, the many movies, and the three spin-off series that have taken over the
airwaves for the last couple of decades, you can be sure that many, many people might
draw inspiration. Both the BBS world and the later Internet Culture would use Star Trek
as a jumping-off point for fiction, speculation, and bad computer jokes.
