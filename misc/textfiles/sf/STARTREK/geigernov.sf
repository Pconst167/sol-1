Chapter 1
Captain's Log - Stardate 42765.5
        After the Enterprise's latest encounter with Q, which resulted in
18 deaths and some structural damage to the saucer section, we are enroute
to Starbase 197.  Our encounter with the Borg will be added to Starfleet
records for future reference.  Starfleet Command has given extended shore
leave to the entire Enterprise crew while repairs are made to the saucer
section.
        "Mister Data, ETA at Starbase 197," asked Captain Picard, an
imposing, bald man who sat in the center seat of the Bridge.
        "At our present speed of Warp 6 we will arrive in 6.43321 hours,
sir," reported Lieutenant Commander Data from the navigator's station at
the front of the Bridge.  Data's gold eyes and pale skin told everyone that
he was an android.
        "6.4 hours would have sufficed, Lieutenant, thank you.  Status report,
Mister Worf."
        "All departments report maximum efficiency.  Hull sensors indicate
that the damage to the saucer section will not be structurally dangerous
unless we exceed Warp 8," replied the Klingon communications officer and
Security chief from the Upper Bridge.
        "Thank you, Mister Worf.  Keep me informed of any changes."
        "Picard to Engineering," said Picard, tapping his combadge,
"Mister LaForge, any problems to report?"
        "Nothing new to report, Captain," said the blind Chief Engineer,
the pulsating light from the Warp engines glinting off the VISOR that
allows him to "see."
        "Will the damage caused by Q effect our phasers in any way?"
asked the Captain.
        "When Q removed the cylinder from the Enterprise some major
systems were disrupted, including weapons, but we've been able to reroute
most of them.  I have the Engineering staff pulling double shifts running
diagnostics on each system.  So far nothing's been encountered to prevent
us from restoring all systems to their original paths.  I just want to be
sure so that nothing happens to damage the saucer section even more.
        "But to answer your question, Captain, since we'll be at Starbase
197 soon, I've taken the phasers off-line until full scale repairs can be
made.  Q didn't touch the phaser rings but he came awfully close," reported
Geordi.
        "In that case, I sincerely hope the phasers won't be needed,
Lieutenant.  Picard out.
        "Counselor, what is the crew's mood?" asked Picard as he turned
to his left to consult Deanna Troi, the empathic Ship's Counselor.
        "They are tired, both mentally and physically, but that is
understandable.  They are also saddened by the deaths of the crewmembers.
All in all, Captain, I don't think the crew could stand the stress of
another mission.  You should request a shore leave for the entire crew,
yourself included," said the beautiful Betazoid.
        "Deanna, you know how I hate to be away from the Enterprise, even
for a short time.  But I have a surprise for you.
        "Mister Worf, open a shipwide channel," requested Picard.
        "Channel open, sir."
        "This is Captain Picard.  Due to the stresses placed upon both
ship and crew by the time vortex and our encounter with Q, Starfleet
Command has granted shore leave to all crewmembers upon our arrival at
Starbase 197.  Please refer to the schedules posted by the department
heads as to your beam-down time.  Enjoy yourselves.  As the best crew
in Starfleet, you deserve this vacation.  Picard out."
        From throughout the ship, cheers could be heard.  Smiles even
broke out among the Bridge Crew, except for Worf and Data.  Data because
he was an android and the purpose of some human expressions eluded him.
Worf because he was a Klingon and they just don't do that kind of thing.
        "That's great news, Captain, but why'd you keep it a secret?"
asked William Riker, the bearded First Officer seated on Picard's right.
        "Well, Number One, the message came through just before I came
on the Bridge.  How are you going to spend shore leave, Will?"
        "There are some new holodeck simulations I've been wanting to
try out," said Riker.
        "Ah, you mean the survival games," said Worf with appreciation.
  "I too want to see those."
        "No, Worf, I meant the historic recreations.  I've heard they're
extremely detailed."
        "What about you, Captain?"
        "Oh, I don't know.  I have some reading to catch up on.  I'd also
like to work on my painting," said Picard.
        For awhile, they flew on in silence.  Finally Picard said, "Mister
Crusher, steady on course.  I'll be in my Ready Room.  You have the Bridge,
Number One."  And Picard left the Bridge.
        "Was that not unusual?"  asked Data.
        "I'm not sure, Data.  The Captain has been pretty angry about our
inability to deal effectively with Q and the Borg," said Riker.
        "There is that, but I sense something else.  He doubts his ability
to command.  I've talked with him and his mental condition has improved
somewhat.  He just needs time.  The deaths of the crew aren't helping either.
He feels personally responsible.  Combined with the stress of informing
their families, it all adds up to a great deal of strain.  He will get
through it because he is strong.  He just has to understand that it's
not his fault," analyzed Deanna.
        Suddenly, the Enterprise shook violently.  The shocked exclamations
of the Bridge Crew were lost amid the red alert klaxons.
        "Data, shields up.  Ensign Crusher, take us out of warp.  Worf,
damage report," ordered Riker.
        Picard emerged from his Ready Room looking shaken, blood from a
large cut on his forehead flowing down his face.  "Wh-what hit us?"
        "We're working on it, sir.  Worf, where is that damage report?"
asked Riker.
        "Communications throughout the ship were damaged.  In addition,
the damaged section of the saucer has been stressed to the limit.  Any
more shocks like that and the hull could rupture," reported Worf.
        "Mister Data, why didn't our sensors register anything?" asked
Picard.  "And shut off that damn noise!"  The red alert klaxons fell silent.
        "Unknown ,sir, but an unidentified ship has just come within
sensor range."
        "On visual."
        The viewscreen changed from an empty star-field to a crystalline
ship approaching quickly.  It was the shape and color of a huge,
multifaceted diamond.  Spires and antennae projected from numerous points
on the hull.  A huge weapons pod was slung on its underside.
        "Intruder slowing to sublight," reported Data.
        "Mister LaForge, why didn't sensors register the intruder?"
inquired Riker, tapping his combadge.
        "We were in the process of restoring the sensors to their original
paths."
        "Mister Worf, open hailing frequencies, universal translator on,"
ordered Picard.
        "Hailing frequencies open."
        "This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard commanding the Federation starship
Enterprise.  You are intruding into Federation space.  Please state you
business peacefully or we will be forced to take action against you."
        "Captain Picard," sneered a hissing voice as an insectoid appeared
on the viewscreen, "why should we fear you?  This one vessel could
obliterate any ten of your Federation vessels.  I am Skon of the Xin
and I question your right to exist, just as you question my right to
be here."
        A low growl emanated from Worf and Picard shot him a warning glance.
        "Now see here, Skon.  We want no trouble.  Our mission is to
explore the galaxy and make peaceful contact with new races.  We have no
quarrel with the Xin.  In fact, we've never heard of you before."
        "What!  The Xin control seven galaxies.  Our technology is far more
advanced over yours.  We are superior in every way."
        "It would appear not, as the Enterprise still exists," retorted Picard.
        "Ha!  That was merely our weapons system on its lowest setting.
What you would call a warning shot.  I assure you, at their highest setting,
they are capable of shattering planets.  Do not anger me, Picard," warned Skon.
        "I wouldn't dream of it, Skon.  I just want to know what you're
doing in Federation space."
        "I don't have to answer to you, Captain.  But if you must know,
my orders are to collect specimens from the various galactic powers in
order for the Xin to formulate a plan for Universal domination.  You,
Captain, have the honor of being the first Federation starship captured
on the Xin road to glory.  Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command to me."
        The screen reverted to a view of the Xin ship.
        "We're not caught yet.  Worf, send a distress call to all Federation
ships."
        "All frequencies are being jammed, Captain."
        "Damn.  Mister Crusher, lay in an escape course away from Federation
space and engage at Warp 3," ordered Picard.  "Mister Data, scan the computer
banks for any reference to the Xin."  The blood from his wound still flowed
freely, staining his uniform a darker red.
        "Aye, sir," Data acknowledged, walking aft to the science station as
the Enterprise leapt into Warp.  Worf moved forward to take Data's place at
the Ops station.  The stars on the viewscreen lengthened into streaks as the
Enterprise broke the lightspeed barrier.
        "Captain, should I call Dr. Pulaski to look at your injury?  It looks
serious," said Riker, the concern in his voice was evident.
        "Not now, Number One.  I don't have time to get my head examined.
I'm fine," grumbled the Captain, his eyes locked on the viewscreen.
        "Captain, the Xin ship is closing on us at Warp 3.5," the Klingon
reported.
        "Mister Crusher, Warp 5," ordered the Captain.  The stars on the
viewscreen grew into even longer streaks as the Enterprise accelerated.
        "Reverse angle on the viewscreen.  Let's see the Xin ship," said Riker.
The view changed from one of stars accelerating towards them to one of stars
accelerating away from them.  In the center, a white speck slowly increased
in size.
        "The Xin ship has increased to Warp 4.....Warp 5.....Warp 6," said
Worf, astonished.
        "Mister Crusher, increase speed to Warp 8."
        "Sir the hull cannot take the stress caused by such high speeds.
We must slow down."
        "I am aware of that, Worf.  As Captain of this vessel, I take full
responsibility."
        The vibration of the deck, nearly imperceptible before, had become
quite evident.  The red alert klaxons went off again and the computer's
voice warned "Due to extreme speed, hull rupture imminent."
        "Mister Worf, raise maximum strength deflector screens around the
damaged portion of the saucer section.  As close to the hull as possible."
        "Aye, sir.  Deflector screens up."
        On the screen, the white speck had begun to grow in size again.
        "Sir, Xin ship gaining on us again.  It's speed is Warp 9.5," Worf
nearly yelled.
        "Picard to Engineering.  Mister LaForge, can we accelerate to
maximum Warp with the ship in its present condition?"
        "Possibly, but I wouldn't advise it.  The hull could go at any moment.
I have a team working on reinforcing the damaged section of the saucer,
but we're talking about nearly every deck of the primary hull," reported
the Chief Engineer.
        "So noted, Lieutenant.  Picard out.  Worf, raise shields around
the damaged section.  Mister Crusher, increase speed to maximum.  Warp 10."
        "Sir, are you serious?  You heard what LaForge said.  Warp 10 could
destroy the Enterprise!" objected Riker.
        "Number One, if that was just a warning shot, we will need help.
Since frequencies are jammed we must try to find it ourselves.  Mister
Crusher, our speed."
        "Warp 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.85, 9.9," Wes read off the
speed in ten second intervals.  "Holding at Warp 9.9."
        "Picard to Engineering.  Why are we holding at Warp 9.9?"
        "Because of the energy being diverted to the shields and deflector
screens.  We can't go any faster unless we lower them.  But if we do that,
the ship will tear itself apart."  In the background could be heard the
pulsing throb of the Warp engines.  They sounded like a human heartbeat
accelerated to the bursting point.  "Also, there's a slight flaw in the
matter/antimatter containment field.  Maximum Warp would destroy the field
totally and the Enterprise would be obliterated, along with most of the
rest of this sector of space."
        "Very well.  Thank you, Lieutenant.  Picard out.  Worf, what is the
Xin's speed?"
        "Warp 12, sir.  It is gaining rapidly."
        Worf was right.  The image on the viewscreen had almost blotted out
the rest of the starfield.
        "We have no choice then, unless you've found something, Mister Data?"
        "I am sorry, Captain, but there is no information regarding the Xin
in either my own or the ship's memory banks," replied Data apologetically.
        Worf relinquished the Ops station to Data and went back to his
Communications console.
        "Worf, try to call for help again."
        "Sorry, Captain.  We are still being jammed," reported the Klingon
irritably.  He did not like feeling useless.  So far his advice had gone
unheeded and his attempts to send any message at all had been ineffectual.
On top of that, the Enterprise, Starfleet's best ship, was running away.
Finally he said, "Captain, I recommend that we turn and fight.  We will
soon be overtaken and will be forced to fight anyway."
        "Mister Worf, as much as I value your recommendations, this is my
Bridge and I will not have people telling me how to run my ship!"
        Before Worf could reply, however, the Enterprise was hit by a blast
from the Xin ship.  The stars on the screen shortened.
        "Mister Crusher, why are we slowing?"
        "They hit our Warp nacelles, Captain. Warp drive is nearly destroyed."
        "Captain, the Xin ship is slowing to match our speed," reported Data.
        "Mister Worf, scan the Xin ship for some vulnerable location.
It appears we'll have to make a fight of it after all."
        "Captain, unable to scan the Xin ship.  Sensors do not register
anything."
        "It's an awfully powerful nothing then," said Riker.
        "Let's give them a taste of their own medicine, shall we.  Slow
to impulse power, Mister Crusher."
        The Xin ship also slowed to match the speed of Enterprise.
        "Shields at maximum," ordered Picard.  "Mister LaForge, I need
those phasers now!"
        "Way ahead of you, Captain.  Phasers will be on-line in 45 seconds."
        "Mister Crusher, evasive maneuvers.  Mister Worf, try sending a
distress message on all channels again."
        "Aye, Captain," Ensign Crusher and Lieutenant Worf replied in unison.
        After a few seconds, Worf said, "Captain, communications are still
being jammed.  Unable to send the distress message."
        "Damn.  Well, we'll just have to do the best we can.  Mister Data,
have Weapons load the Bridge logs into a disarmed photon torpedo and launch
it in the direction of Starbase 197.  Include a warning about the Xin."
        "Torpedo away, sir," replied Data after a brief pause.  "You do of
course realize that it will not arrive at Starbase 197 for over eight months."
        "It's the best we can do with no Communications.  How long until we
have full phaser power?" asked Picard.
        Data's board beeped and he reported, "We now have full phaser power."
        "Mister Data, arm all photon torpedoes and prepare to fire all phaser
banks simultaneously on my command."
        But before the order could be given, the Enterprise rocked under
another barrage from the Xin ship.  Warning lights began flashing at all
Bridge stations and the Bridge lights flickered.
        "Captain, our shields are down to 38%.  We cannot withstand another
hit of such strength," reported Data.
        "Thank you, Mister Data.  Damage report, Mister Worf."
        "Minor damage to most systems.  Warp drive is irreparable.  Shield
control damaged.  The hull has begun to rupture along the edges of the
damage that Q caused.  There are four dead and twenty people injured,"
reported Worf.  "Doctor Pulaski is on her way with a medical team.  More
technicians are enroute to repair the damage."
        "Let's give the Xin something to think about.  Fire phasers and
ten rapid fire photon torpedoes.  Geordi, what shape are the engines in?"
        "I'm afraid the Warp engines are gone and impulse power is in nearly
the same shape.  Our maximum speed now is one half impulse power and that's
pushing it."
        The viewscreen lit up with the combined flare of phasers striking
home and the detonation of ten photon torpedoes.  When the pyrotechnics
dissipated, the Xin ship was still there, unharmed.
        "Captain, they are preparing to fire again," warned Data.
        "Divert all power to shields.  Mister LaForge, prepare to drop
the containment field on the matter/antimatter intermix chamber.  Commander,
get down to the battle bridge in the stardrive section and set a course that
will take it directly into the Xin ship.  Mister Worf, advise all personnel
in the secondary hull to evacuate to the saucer section immediately."
        As everyone went about their assigned duties, the Enterprise shook
again.
        "Our shields are gone, Captain.  We are now defenseless," reported Data.
        "Picard to Riker.  You'd better hurry, Number One.  We are out of
options."
        "Almost finished.  Separate the ship and beam me over on my signal."
        "Did you hear that, Chief O'Brien?"
        "Aye, Captain.  Transporters are ready.  When you give the word,
I'll lock on to all lifesigns in the engineering hull and beam them over."
        "Do it.  Use the cargo transporters if you have to,  I don't want
to lose any more of my crew.  Energize!  Mister Data, disengage locking
clamps and power up the impulse engines on the rear of the saucer," and
tapping his combadge he said, "Number One, you're out of time."
        "Done, Captain.  Ready to beam over."
        "Mister O'Brien, how many people left in the secondary hull?"
        "Only Commander Riker.  I'll beam him directly to the Bridge."
        "Thank you, Mister O'Brien.  Picard out."
        With a high whine, a tall blue column of light appeared and slowly
coalesced into the form of Commander Riker.
        "Captain, the Xin captain again orders us to surrender," reported Worf.
        "Ignore him, Lieutenant.  Mister Data, secure for saucer separation.
Activate the secondary hull's course programming once the saucer is free,"
ordered Picard.
        Slowly, majestically, the Enterprise's saucer section lifted up and
away from the neck of the engineering hull.  The impulse engines activated
and the saucer section began to move away from the Xin ship.  The secondary
hull turned and headed directly for it.
        By this time, Geordi LaForge had rushed out of the Turbolift to the
Engineering station on the Bridge.  "Transferring Engineering to the Bridge.
Ready to drop matter/antimatter shielding on your command."
        "Much as I hate to say this, detonate, Mister LaForge, for the sake
of the Federation," ordered Picard.
        As the engineering hull neared the Xin ship, Picard said, "Damn that Q.
If we were at full strength we might have had a chance!"
        The engineering hull blossomed into a  gigantic explosion as the full
fury of a matter/anti-matter explosion was vented on the Xin ship.

		Chapter 2
	The blast from the Engineering hull bloomed
yellow and orange against the blackness of the 
surronding space.  Blossomed and -- stopped.  The explosion
just hung there in space.
	"Captain, I cannot explain it, but all
chronometers have stopped," reported Data.
	"Captain, I sense a presence," said Deanna
Troi, who had been silent during the entire encounter
with the Xin.  "It is not so much malevolent as
mischievous."
	"No, it couldn't be...Not so soon after
last time.  It's just not possible," said Picard.
	"And why not, Jean-Luc?  I've grown quite
accustomed to bailing you out of trouble," said
a man in Vulcan religious robes.  He had just
appeared between Wesley Crusher's and Lieutenant
Commander Data's control consoles.
	All of the Bridge Crew recognized him
instantly and groaned in unison "Q!"  Everyone
except Worf, who just growled fiercely.
	"What, you're not happy to see me?"
	"Why should we be, Q.  You've done nothing
but taunt us since we first encountered you!"
shouted Picard.  By now, it was all Picard could
do to sit up straight in his chair.
	"Yeah, why don't you get lost?" added
Riker.
	Worf's growl turned into a roar as he 
launched himself from the Bridge's upper level.
A phaser appeared in his hand.  He landed in a 
crouch between Picard and Q and raised his phaser 
to fire.  An incandescent blue light erupted from
the phaser's muzzle and struck Q.  The beam hit Q
full in the chest, causing his body to be enveloped
in a brilliant halo.
	"Really, Worf, haven't you learned anything
from our past encounters?  You know that won't work.
In fact, I'm insulted that I don't rate higher than
heavy stun."  With a flick of his finger, more for
effect than because it was required, Q sent Worf's
phaser blast arcing back to its source.  The 
phaser couldn't handle the added energy so it
overloaded, sending Worf flying across the Bridge
to smash into the wall next to the Turbolift,
unconscious.
	"Really, mon capitan, I expected anger
from Worf, but not from you.  And you, Will.  I'm
omnipotent, I can't get lost."
	From behind him, Q could sense rapid
movement from Data's station.
	"And just what do you think you're doing,
android?  You of all peop-, uh, beings should know
that nothing you do can effect me," said Q.
	"I was merely summoning Dr. Pulaski from
Sickbay to attend to Lieutenant Worf," replied
Data.
	"Come now, Data, I find you and your
friends too amusing to allow you to be seriously
injured.  Worf will be all right, but you'd better
summon the good doctor anyway.  Your captain looks
ill.  Probably overexcitement at seeing me or else
the accumulated nausea of seeing Worf everyday for
the past two years.  Take your pick."
	Picard had by now lost a lot of blood from
his head wound and was looking paler.  He had been
trying not to show how weak he felt but it wasn't
working very well.  He rose shakily to his feet 
and confronted Q.
	"I have had about enough of you and your
insults, Q," Picard said in a low, dangerous
whisper.  "Surely, you in your INFINITE wisdom can
find something better to do than annoy me and my 
crew."
	"Okay, Picard, have it your way.  I'll 
just go blow up some stars or something.  I'm sure
the inhabitants of the orbiting planets won't 
mind.  I'll tell them Jean-Luc Picard sent me."
And Q started to disappear in a column of rainbow
sparkles, an obvious exaggeration of the Enterprise
transporters.
	"Wait!  Stop, Q!  I already have twenty 
two deaths on my conscience because of you, I
don't need any more," Picard yelled.
	"Oh, how quaint.  I do believe that you're
jealous.  You don't want me to play with anyone
else but you."
	"It's not that, Q.  Obviously you're here
for some reason and I'd like to know what it is."
	"Very well.  I've come to stop you from
making a terrible mistake.  If you look at the
viewscreen very carefully, you'll see that the Xin
ship was not destroyed.  All the pyrotechnics 
you've been throwing around have just made them 
mad," explained Q.  "And one of you science types,
especially the android or the boy," he said 
indicating Data and Wesley Crusher, "should have
realized that since the ship is crystalline in
nature,  any energy you expend on it is magnified
and stored until it is needed.  The Xin captain
lied, Picard.  This is no mere specimen collecting
mission, but an advanced raiding scout.  Even now,
a fleet of over five hundred Xin ships is massing
at the edge of Federation space.  This brings me
to the reason for my visit.  I will help you
defeat the Xin."
	"Why?  Why help us?  Every time you appear,
you torment us," said Riker.
	"Because, if the Xin take over the galaxy,
most of Starfleet will be destroyed in the battle.
That includes the Enterprise.  I've grown quite 
fond of you.  I like visiting with you.  Besides,
I, too, hate to see the Enterprise in pieces.  It
just doesn't seem right somehow.  I will restore 
the Enterprise if you promise to allow me to help
you defeat the Xin."
	At this point, Captain Picard, who had 
been looking worse by the second, collapsed into 
a heap on the floor at Troi's feet.  All of the
Bridge Crew, those who were still conscious at 
least, rushed to the Captain's side.
	"Look's like you're finally first in 
command, Number One," laughed Q.  "I've disabled
the Turbolift carrying Dr. Pulaski and cut the 
Bridge off from the rest of the ship.  Your
captain will die soon.  Agree to my terms and I'll
let the doctor save the Captain and I'll tell you
how to defeat the Xin.  Do we have a deal, Riker?"
	"Yes, though I'll probably regret this, 
damn it, but yes, I agree," said Riker, reluctantly.
	"I knew you'd see it my way.  Okay, I'm a
being of my word.  Zap!"  With a flash, all the
Bridge personnel except Worf and Picard were
returned instantaneously to their proper stations.
In addition, Dr. Pulaski appeared in the center 
of the Bridge, fists raised as if pounding on 
something.  "Let me out--What?  Not you again, Q?"
	"Just attend to your Captain, if you 
please, Doctor, so that we may get on with our
business."
	"Excuse me, Commander, but my control 
panel indicates that we have warp power available
to us, even though the secondary hull was
destroyed," reported Data.
	"How is that possible, Data?" asked 
Wesley.
	"Simple, I undestroyed it.  Matter is so
easy to manipulate if you know how.  Don't worry,
the Enterprise is now fully repaired.  No hull 
stress, nothing," explained Q.
	"Q, we must get the Captain to Sickbay
immediately.  If we don't act now, he will die,"
said Pulaski urgently.
	"Oh, I don't think so, Doctor.  I have
faith in you.  But if you insist."  With a wave
of his hand, Q made Picard and Pulaski disappear.
	"What have you done with them, Q?" asked
Deanna.
	"Yes, where are they, and what about 
Worf?" Riker queried.
	"Why, they're in Sickbay, of course.  And
as for Worf, he's thick skulled.  He'll survive.
Besides, I like him better this way.  The mighty
warrior, reduced to a helpless pile of flesh.
Still, to earn your trust, I guess I'll have to 
remove him to Sickbay, as well."  
	Worf vanished.
	"There.  Satisfied?"
	"No, but I guess I'll have to live with 
it," said Riker.
	"Yes, you do, don't you," said Q.
	"Alright, Q, what do we have to do now?
You've humiliated all of us on many occasions.
Just tell us what comes next."
	By this time Riker was standing toe-to-toe
with Q and staring him straight in the face.
	"Patience, my son," said Q, now dressed 
in the raiments of a priest from Old Earth.  "All
shall be revealed in the Good Lord's (mine 
actually) own time." 
	In a flash, Q was clothed in the garb of a
big game hunter from Ancient Earth's African
continent.
	"I propose a great hunt for a rare,
magnificent beast.  One the Universe has not seen
the likes of for over half a century."
	"Enough with the fashion show, Q.  Out
with it!  What do we have to do to save the
Federation?" Riker shouted.
	"Temper, temper.  All right, since you
insist on the truth, here it is.  Fifty three 
years ago, the last of a race of giant energy 
absorbing creatures died.  They were similar in
nature to the probe that nearly destroyed Earth
around Stardate 8000.  I'm sure you have a record
of it in your memory banks.  You must capture one
of these creatures and use it to attack the Xin 
ships.  It's really not so hard, now is it?"
	"Hold it, Q.  If these creatures have been
extinct for fifty three years, how are we supposed 
to capture one?" asked Riker.
	"Obviously, you must go back in time and
bring one back to the present.  Come on, Will,
use the brain all non-Klingon Starfleet officers
are supposed to have."
	"Q, I admit that on rare occasions, time
travel has been successfully achieved, but never
with a ship the size of the Enterprise.  Our 
chance of success is only one in six million,
three hundred forty five thousand, eight hundred
sixty three," analyzed Data.
	"I know of no way, short of a miracle,
that we could even have a hope of success,"
protested Wes.
	"That's where I come in," said Q.  "Just
as with the Borg, you need me.  I will handle all
time travel.  You need only concern yourselves with
hunting down and capturing the creature.  That seems
a fair division of labor.  Very equitable, I think,"
said Q.
	"If I agree, will you give us time to
prepare?" asked Riker.
	"Of course, as much time as you need.
Just remember, time is stopped only locally.  The
Xin fleet is still gathering.  Your time is running
out.  Decide, Riker!"
	"Alright, Q.  I agree, God help me, but I
must agree," declared Riker.
	"Fine.  Call me when you're ready and we
can get to work," said Q, fading away.
	"You heard him.  Let's get to work," said
Riker.
	Behind him, on the viewscreen, the explosion
had disappeared when the Enterprise was reconstituted
and the Xin ship could be seen clearly.  Slowly,
imperceptibly, and unnoticed by the crew, it moved.
Just a meter, but it moved nonetheless.	CHAPTER 3
	Captain's Log - Stardate 8051.2
	The Enterprise has just completed a mission
taking her dangerously deep into Klingon space. 
Due to the delicacy of the mission, the details
must remain classified.  Commendations to all crew
members, especially Commanders Sulu, Chekov, and
Scott, Captain Spock, and Doctor McCoy for bravery
in the face of life-threatening danger during a
beam-down mission.  These commendations will be
forwarded to Starfleet Command upon our arrival at
Starbase 43 for debriefing.
	"Captain, nearing the edge of Federation
space," reported Commander Sulu.
	"Mister Chekov, any pursuers?"
	"No, Keptin.  Sensors detect no wessels 
following us out of Klingon space," reported the
Russian navigator.
	"Kirk to Engineering.  Scotty, are you 
there?" asked Kirk, depressing the intraship
communications switch on the arm of his command
chair.
	"Aye, I'm here," replied the burly Scotsman.
In the background, Kirk could hear the deep, 
rhythmic pulsations of the Warp engines. 
	"What shape are the engines in, Scotty?
Did they sustain much damage?  They did take a
lot of punishment."
	"Don't ye worry, sir.  Between you and the
Klingons, they've been takin' quite a poundin'
lately, but they're a lot tougher than I make out.
They'll work at their usual 110%, just like always."
	"That's good to hear, Mr. Scott.  Kirk out.
Anyone have anything to report?"  Kirk asked the 
Bridge Crew.  When no one answered, he said
"I'll be down in Sickbay if you need me.  You have
the Bridge, Spock."
	Kirk entered the Turbolift as Spock left
his Science Station and sat in the center seat.
	"Sickbay," Kirk said as the Turbolift doors
closed behind him.  The Turbolift moved both
horizontally and vertically in order to reach
Sickbay.  At one point, his Turbolift car had to
pause for a few seconds in order to avoid a 
collision with another car.
	When he finally left the Turbolift, he
walked slowly to Sickbay.  As the doors slid open,
he heard Doctor Leonard "Bones" McCoy say
"Dammit!  Every time things calm down and I try to
get my equipment operating properly, Jim goes and
tries to get us killed!"
	"Problems, Doctor?" Kirk asked.
	"Hell yes, Jim!  We're none of us getting
any younger, of course we won't get any older if 
you don't calm down!  You're not a Captain any more.
Go back to your job with Starfleet Intelligence.  
As your doctor and your friend,  I'm telling you
to --"
	"Bones, calm down.  What's this all 
about?"
	"I'm sorry, Jim.  It's just that I lost 
five patients,  all of them fresh out of the 
Academy."
	"Bones, it's not your fault.  They were in
pretty rough shape to begin with.  They never
should have tried to complete the mission on their
own.  We were too busy to notice their departure.
Next thing I knew, they were in a crossfire between
us and the Klingons.  We were lucky to beam them
aboard just before the shuttlecraft exploded.
They were pretty far gone when they were brought
back.  Don't blame yourself," said Kirk
sympathetically.
	"I just can't believe that, Jim.  I'm a
doctor.  I should have been able to save them."
	"Bones, listen to yourself.  You've never
been like this before.  Remember, like you would
say, you're a doctor, not a miracle worker.  Have
a drink to calm down.  My job is harder.  I have 
to tell their families why their sons and daughters
aren't coming home."
	"Jim, a drink won't change anything.  And
you think your job's tough?  I have to live with
the fact that they might have been saved if I 
could have begun treating them 30 seconds sooner.
If you don't mind, Jim, I'd like to work through 
this by myself."
	"Of course, Bones.  I'll be in my 
quarters."
	"Jim, before you go -- I'm sorry I snapped
at you.  It wasn't really anyone's fault.  I just
need time to convince myself of that fact."
	"I understand, Bones," said Kirk, who left
Sickbay feeling very depressed.  He entered the
Turbolift at the end of the corridor and said,
"Captain's quarters."
	The Turbolift went up and over from G deck
to E deck.  As Kirk entered his quarters, the ship
shook violently.  Kirk ran to the communications
panel on the wall and anxiously asked, "Kirk to
Bridge.  Spock, what's going on?"
	"My apologies, Captain, but our navigational
deflector was damaged.  A small meteor came too 
close to ensure that we would miss it.  I ordered
Commander Chekov to destroy it with a photon 
torpedo as it was too close to use the phasers.
Fortunately, the shields came up in time to absorb
the majority of the blast.  No damage to the 
Enterprise occurred," reported the Vulcan First
Officer in his typically emotionless voice.
	"Be careful, Spock.  McCoy's on the
warpath.  Any more incidents like this and he's
liable to lead a mutiny and force us all to walk
the plank," Kirk said, laughter in his voice.
	"Captain, could you please explain your 
last remark.  I do not think such a revolution
would be successful and I see no significance in 
Doctor McCoy's forcing us to walk along narrow
pieces of wood," Spock said in a tone approaching
confusion.  
	"Never mind, Spock, never mind.  Kirk 
out," said Jim, closing the channel.
	"I've got to find a way to make him loosen
up.  A project I'll give Bones when he's feeling 
up to it," he thought to himself.
	Kirk took off his red uniform shirt and 
slung it over a chair.  He sat down on his bed,
rubbing both hands over his eyes.  Jim Kirk 
realized that he was more tired than he had
thought.  He lay down and after awhile fell into
a troubled sleep, haunted by the faces of the 
five dead cadets.  He felt guilty over their loss,
too.  For an hour he tossed and turned then settled
down into a peaceful slumber.
	"Bridge to Captain Kirk.  Bridge to Captain
Kirk."  Uhura's voice woke him from a deep sleep.
	"Kirk here," he answered groggily.  "What
is it, Uhura?"
	"Sorry to wake you, Captain, but I have a
message for you from Starfleet Command."
	Kirk walked over to his personal viewscreen
and was welcomed by the words "Starfleet Command -
Highest Priority" superimposed over the United 
Federation of Planets insignia.
	"Computer, this is Kirk, Admiral James T."
	"Voice pattern match.  Prepare for retina
scan," said the female voice of the ship's computer.
A circle of white light lit up Kirk's right eye.
After a few seconds the computer said "Identity
confirmed."
	The computer terminal's viewscreen changed
to show Admiral Nogura, supreme head of Starfleet.
"Admiral Kirk, I have some good news for you.
Please sit down, as this may come as a shock to you.
	"Firstly, the Enterprise is to return to
Earth immediately, where she will repaired and 
become a training vessel for Academy cadets.
	"Secondly, you will be reinstated as head
of Starfleet Intelligence with the same powers and
responsibilities you had before the V'GER incident.
	"Thirdly, inform Commander Pavel Chekov
that he has been assigned to the Reliant, where he
will be the Science/First Officer.
	"Lastly, the rest of your Bridge staff will
become instructors at the Academy because of their 
wealth of experiences under your command.
	"Please inform your crew.   Congratulations,
Admiral.  Nogura out."
	The viewscreen went blank, but Kirk sat
there.  He stared, disbelieving, at the viewscreen.
Kirk was unable to accept the reality of Nogura's
orders, even though they came from a man second 
only to God as far as most people were concerned.
	It was thirty minutes later that he 
arrived on the Bridge.  Spock vacated the command
chair and reported "All systems running normally."
	"Thank you, Spock," Kirk said flatly as he
sat down heavily in the center seat.
	"Is something troubling you, Captain?" 
Spock asked.
	"That obvious is it?  I had hoped to tell 
you this later, but as long as you're all here...
That message was from Admiral Nogura.  This will
be our last mission together."
	Everyone on the Bridge was startled and
showed it.  Most by gasping, but Spock very 
eloquently raised an eyebrow sharply.
	"Let me explain.  I am resuming my post
as head of Starfleet Intelligence.  The rest of
you, including Mr. Scott and Dr.McCoy will be 
instructors at Starfleet Academy.  The Enterprise
herself will be used as a training ship for 
Starfleet cadets," explained Kirk.
	Kirk rose from his chair and walked
around in front of Chekov's control station.
"Congratulations, Pavel.  You are the new science
officer and second-in-command on the Reliant.
You'll be serving under Captain Terrell."
	"You mean it, Keptin?"
	"Yes, Chekov, I mean it."  Returning to
his command chair, he said, "These orders take
effect immediately upon our return to Earth.
Uhura, please inform Scotty.  I'll talk to the
good doctor myself."
	Everyone waited until the end of the duty 
shift to congratulate each other.  Once off-duty,
Kirk went down to Sickbay to talk to McCoy.  As he
walked through the doors, Kirk called, "Bones,
it's Jim.  Where are you?"
	"I'm in my office, Jim.  Come on in."
	Jim stood in the threshold and asked "Is
it okay to come in or do I need to call Security
for a bodyguard?"
	"Everything's fine.  Sit down and have a 
drink."
	As McCoy poured himself a glass of blue
Romulan ale, illegal in the Federation, Kirk said,
"You certainly sound better, Bones."
	"All it took was a look through my records,
Jim."
	"I don't follow you."
	"I saw the list of all the people I'd 
saved while on the Enterprise.  The list was so
long, I lost count.  Then I looked at the list of
people who died under my care.  It didn't even fill
up one screen on the computer.  I must be doing 
something right, Jim."
	"I'm glad you have high spirits.  You'll 
need them once I've told you our new orders."
And Kirk told him.
	McCoy was outraged.  "They can't do that,
Jim.  You're the best damn captain in Starfleet.
Reinstating your command of the Enterprise was the
best thing they ever did."
	"But you said--"
	"I know what I said, but I didn't really
mean it.  I was 'letting my human emotions get the
best of me.'"  He said the last sentence in a 
toneless voice, one eyebrow raised.  This brought
a smile to Kirk's face.  
	"I hope you're going to fight this, Jim.
I'll make a recommendation in my Medical Log if 
you think it'll help.  I can say that a desk job 
would be detrimental to your physical and mental 
health."
	"Thanks, Bones, but there's no way to 
fight Nogura and win.  He IS Starfleet, after
all."
	"I guess you're right, Jim.  I don't 
like it, that's all."
	"You're still mad at him for forcing you
out of retirement."  By now, Kirk had finished 
his drink so he bid McCoy good night and went back
to his quarters.  He cleaned up his breakfast 
dishes and ate dinner.  When he was done, he 
worked on some of the paperwork involved with
commanding a starship.  Funny, he thought, that in
this day and age of computer tablets, it's still 
called paperwork, even though no paper is involved.
	Kirk worked for a couple of hours, until
his vision started to blur.  He noticed that he 
was only about half done.
	"Maybe Bones was right," he said to 
himself.  "Maybe I am getting old.  Used to be,
I could get through a pile of paperwork this size
in one night.  Oh well, there's always tomorrow."
	He rose slowly and began getting ready for
bed.  Then he sat on the edge of his bed and 
thought about his experiences aboard the Enterprise.
Countless battles with the Klingons and Romulans.  
The discovery of Khan after centuries adrift in 
space.  First peaceful contact with the Horta and
the Fifth Empire.  Redjac.  The salt vampire.  
Harcourt Fenton Mudd.  The Gorn.  Tribbles.  V'Ger.
	He'd had a full career, boldly going 
where no man had gone before, but it was all over
now.
	He called up to the Bridge but nothing had
changed, so he went to bed.  For the second night,
his sleep was troubled, this time by a nightmare.
Admiral Nogura was laughing at him.  Then he 
dissipated and coalesced into Redjac and enveloped
Kirk in a bright red mist.  Kirk collapsed to the 
ground and Redjac became a single tribble which 
fell on his chest and began reproducing.  Soon he
was buried under an infinite number of tribbles, 
their ever increasing weight pushing him deeper 
into the ground, suffocating.
	Kirk awoke in a cold sweat to find himself
tangled tightly in his blankets.  He unwrapped 
himself and went over to his mirror.  He looked 
terrible, his face pale and covered in sweat.  He  
knew immediately that retirement from the command 
of a starship would not agree with him.
	Kirk went back and lay down, staring at the
ceiling above his bed.  Other than his vast 
experience, he could see no reason that he should
remain in command of the Enterprise.  Besides, 
Nogura would say that that experience was why he
should head Starfleet Intelligence.  Eventually
he fell into a half-sleep.
	The red alert klaxon brought him abruptly
awake.  He hurriedly dressed and ran for the 
Turbolift.  He burst onto the Bridge and Spock
immediately filled him in.
	"Captain, Starfleet has picked up an 
intruder well within Federation space, headed
for Klingon territory.  Starships of the 
Enterprise and Reliant classes are giving chase.
We, also, have been ordered to intercept.  Our
course is laid in and we are awaiting your command
to initiate pursuit," reported the Vulcan.
	"By all means.  Mister Sulu, maximum warp.
Make any necessary course changes to intercept the
intruder."
	"Aye, sir.  Accelerating to Warp 12,"
replied Sulu.
	"Kirk to Engineering.  Scotty, can the 
engines maintain Warp 12 for any length of time?"
	"Scott here.  Yes, sir.  The engines will
be able to take it."
	"Thanks, Scotty.  Kirk out."
	For hours the Enterprise gave chase, Uhura
relaying sensor readings from the other pursuit 
ships to Sulu, who made the appropriate course
changes.  Finally Uhura reported, "Captain, the 
other ships report that they have lost track of
the intruder."
	"Do not be alarmed, Captain," spoke up
Spock.  "The intruder is now within our sensor
range.  The vessel has slowed to a stop.
Scanning.  There are over 1,000 lifesigns aboard,
predominately human, but many Vulcans.  
Fascinating."
	"What is it, Spock?"
	"There is at least one Klingon aboard."
	"Not Klingons again.  We just got through
dealing with the Klingons.  Scan their energy 
levels and weapons systems."
	"Jim, their power levels are so high that
they don't register on my scanners.  As for 
weapons systems, they outgun us nearly thirty to
one.  In addition, their ship is of a design    
similar to ours, but eight times our mass.  A
confrontation would not be advisable."
	"Thank you, Spock.  Recommendation noted.
Mister Sulu, bring us out of Warp when we're in
visual range.  Mister Chekov, as soon as we drop 
out of Warp put out shields and deflectors at
maximum."
	"Aye, sir," both helmsman and weapons 
officer acknowledged in unison.
	As the Enterprise dropped out of Warp,
the stars on the viewscreen shortened from streaks 
to pinpoints of light.  In the center of the 
viewscreen sat an alien vessel that bore an uncanny
resemblance to the Enterprise.  It looked as if 
someone had taken Kirk's ship, enlarged it to
four times the height and twice the length and 
then squished the saucer, engeneering section, and
engine nacelles flat.
	"Commander Uhura, open hailing frequencies,
visual communication."
	"Frequencies open, Captain."
	"This is Admiral James T. Kirk commanding 
the United Starship Enterprise.  Intruder, please
identify yourself within five minutes or we will
open fire with all weapons."
Chapter 4
Captain's Log - Stardate 42767.3
	First Officer William T. Riker reporting
	Since Q's departure, all crew member's in
all departments have been working around the clock,
checking all Enterprise systems for any defects 
left when Q reintegrated the secondary hull.  So
far, none have been found.  The checks must be
completed soon.  The Xin ship we've confronted
has moved over forty meters since Q left and is
picking up speed.  Lieutenant Commander Data has
been researching the probe Q spoke of and has 
nothing to report as yet.
	Captain Picard has slipped into a coma.
But there is good news.  Lieutenant Worf has
recovered and is back on duty.
	"Commander, I have completed the research
you ordered.  Details concerning the probe itself
are sketchy, as the probe rendered all technology
within range powerless.  Upon reaching Earth, the 
probe sent powerful signals into the oceans, trying
to communicate with Earth's whale population.  As
the whales had been hunted to extinction two 
centuries earlier, the officers of the original 
Enterprise went back in time to the late 20th
century.  Two whales were brought back to the 23rd
century.  The probe communicated with the whales 
and left Earth, restoring power to all stations and
vehicles it had rendered powerless.  No subsequent
contact with the probe or its creators has occurred.
	"I hope this information is sufficient, 
sir," said Data.
	"More than sufficient, Data.  Thank you.
Mister Worf, have all stations reported ready yet?"
asked Riker.
	"Yes, Commander.  There is no measurable
effect of the Enterprise's destruction and
reassembly."
	"Then we're almost ready.  Riker to 
Sickbay," he said, tapping his combadge.  "Has the
Captain's condition changed?"
	"Pulaski here.  I'm sorry, Commander.  His
lifesigns remain strong but he's still comatose.
I will notify you of any changes, though."
	"Thank you, Doctor.  Riker out.
	"Bridge to LaForge.  We're ready to go,
Geordi.  Can you transfer Engineering control to
the Bridge and join us up here?"
	"I'm on my way.  I don't trust Q with the 
Enterprise and I'd like to be where I can see him,
not that it matters with someone of his raw power,"
said Geordi.
	"I'm sure everyone shares your sentiments,
Geordi.   Riker out.
	"Mister Crusher, what's the problem?" asked
Riker.
	Wes had been involved in a whispered 
discussion with Data for several minutes.
	"It's nothing, Commander.  I'm just nervous
about letting Q try something as tricky as time   
travel with the Enterprise," said Wesley.
	"There's nothing we could do about it even
if we didn't want Q to send us back through time.
He's just too strong.  Besides we have no choice.
The survival of the Federation rests with us.  The
outcome of this mission determines the future of 
the galaxy," explained Riker.
	"Deanna, what feelings do you get from the
crew?  How do they feel about this mission?"
Riker had told the crew what they were doing and
why and now wondered if he had made the right
decision.
	"The crew are fearful of such a great 
undertaking, but that is understandable.  They have
confidence in the Bridge personnel and in them-
selves," said the ship's counselor.
	"In that case, I guess we can call --"
	There was a flash of light and everyone
on the Bridge finished Riker's sentence for him:
"Q!"
	"Always punctual, at least when it suits
me.  Now, shall we begin?  Very well.  I have
modified the warp nacelles to facilitate time
travel.  
	"Don't worry, Mr. LaForge," said Q, 
anticipating the Chief Engineer's protest, "they
will function normally as long as you follow my
instructions.  Listen carefully."
	With a flash, a large toggle switch 
appeared in the center of Worf's control board.
	"I'll explain it so that even you can
understand it, Klingon."  A growl emanated from
deep within Worf's throat.  "In order to travel
through time, the Enterprise must achieve Warp 8.8.
Then simply pull the switch back to travel back-
wards through time.  You will automatically stop
somewhere near the middle of the 23rd century.
Once you have captured the creature in a tractor
beam, simply accelerate to Warp 8.8 and push the 
switch forward to return to the present.
	"And now I bid you adieu."  So saying, Q
vanished.
	"Let's get started, people.  Geordi, Data,
gradually bring our speed up to Warp 8.8.  Worf,
pull the switch on my signal.  Mister Crusher,
plot a course to the creatures' most probable
location, using 23rd century starcharts."
	"Mister Worf, shipwide communications.
This is First Officer William T. Riker speaking 
for Captain Jean-Luc Picard.  We are about to 
attempt time travel.  Hang on, I don't have to tell
you how dangerous this is.  Riker out."
	"Mister Data, what's our speed?" asked
Riker.
	"Warp 4.5 and increasing."
	"Commander, I don't know if the tractor 
beam can handle the stress of moving something at
Warp 8.8.  It could overload or rip the Enterprise
apart," worried Geordi.
	"We'll worry about that when we get that 
far.  Mister Data, our speed?"
	"Warp 7 and accelerating," replied Data.
	"Keep me informed in one-tenth Warp
intervals once we reach Warp 8," said Riker.
	"Warp 8 ... Warp 8.1 ... Warp 8.2 ...
Warp 8.3 ... 8.4 ... 8.5 ... 8.6 ... 8.7 ...
Warp 8.8"
	"Worf, the switch!" shouted Riker.
	Worf slammed the switch to the rear position
and nothing happened, at least on board the 
Enterprise.  Outside, however, the Enterprise 
shimmered amid a ball of coruscating blue 
lightning streaks and vanished.  All Enterprise
systems continued to function normally except for
the chronometers, which ran backwards.
	"Mister Data, what's going on?  I sense no
change in our movement," said Riker.
	"Unknown, sir, but the chronometers are
running backwards.  Stardate 20000 and decreasing.
Our velocity is constant at Warp 8.8."
	"Any damage to report, Mister Worf?"
	"None, Commander.  It would appear that Q
knows what he's doing.  But why use technology to
send us back?  Why not just wave his hand or snap
his fingers?  I do not trust him."
	"I don't know, Worf.  Maybe he just wants
to show us how 'inferior' our technology is.
Perhaps he's not truly omnipotent.  Q is an enigma,
we'll probably never know for sure," said Riker.
	"Commander Riker?"
	"Yes, Data, what is it?"
	"We are at Stardate 8053.1, traveling at
one-half impulse power."
	"Thank you, Mister Data.  Now what?  Where
do we go to find the creature?"
	"Q fed a course into the navcomp before he
left.  It will take us to the Vexis Corinhi 
system," spoke up Wes.
	"The star went supernova on Stardate 33071,
destroying all planets in the system," added Data.
	"Well, unless someone has a better idea,
engage course at Warp 5.  Mister Data, ETA to the
Corinhi system?" asked Riker.
	"16.7 hours at present speed."
	"Mister Worf, any transmissions?"
	"I'm picking up various subspace messages.
It appears that we are nearing the edge of 23rd 
century Federation space.  Many of the trans-
missions concern an energy surge at the location
where we entered this time zone.  All available
ships have been sent to investigate."
	"Specifically, what are their orders?" asked
Riker.
	"They are under orders to investigate and 
return to their assigned patrol areas.  It appears 
that tensions are escalating between the Federation
and the ... Klingons?!"  He shouted the last word
in disbelief.
	"Lieutenant Worf, the peace treaty between
the Federation and the Klingon Empire was not 
signed until 20 years before we left, or over 50
years into the future, using this time as a 
referent," explained Data.
	"I'm sorry, I had forgotten," rumbled the
Klingon by way of apology.
	"Don't worry about it.  How many ships,
Worf?  What classes do they represent?" asked Riker.
	"There are 10 ships, maybe more.  Some are
still beyond sensor range.  Most of the ships in
range are from the original Enterprise class.
There are a few Reliant class vessels as well,"
reported Worf.
	"Mister Crusher, evasive action.  We most
avoid contact with those ships at all costs or
risk changing the future."
	"Mister Data, call up the schematics on the
main viewer.  Let's see what we're up against," 
said Riker.
	The first schematic appeared on the main 
viewscreen almost immediately after Data reached 
Science Station 1 at the rear of the raised Bridge.
It showed the standard top, front, and side views,
with important areas marked.  This particular
schematic was of an Enterprise class vessel.  It
showed a large saucer section connected to the 
Engineering hull by a thin neck.  The two warp
engine struts jutted out at a 45 degree angle 
from amidships.  The long warp nacelles themselves
sat higher than the exposed bridge in the center
of the saucer section.  The nacelles seemed 
extremely vulnerable compared to the design of the
Galaxy class starships, whose short warp nacelles
were slung lower to the Engineering hull, tucked
away beneath the saucer.
	"As you can see, Commander, these ships
are vulnerable compared to us.  The shields are not
strong enough to defend against a sustained attack.
Despite the fact that these ships have what was for
this time state-of-the-art Leeding FWG-1 engines,
their maximum sake speed is equivalent to our Warp
1.65," explained Data.
	The Enterprise class starship was replaced
by a Reliant class vessel.  It consisted of a
saucer section with Warp nacelles slung under-
neath on very short engine struts.  The Bridge 
was on top of the saucer section.
	"The design is more compact.  As with the
Enterprise class, the impulse engines on the rear 
of the saucer are only slightly less vulnerable 
than the Bridge and Warp nacelles.  Also, the 
photon torpedo array on the top rear of the saucer
is always open to attack.  As with the Enterprise 
class, this design has a top speed of Warp 1.65, in
terms of our UltraWarp capabilities."
	"Avoiding these ships should not be 
difficult," finished Data.
	"Thank you, Lieutenant.  Worf, are there 
any ships following us?"
	"Yes, Commander," Worf answered as Data
returned to his station.  "Two of the ships have
remained at the point of our arrival, leaving
eight to trail us and more are closing on opposite
headings."
	"You mean there are ships coming out of 
Klingon territory?"
	"At least one.  Others are closing on
courses tangential to the Klingon-Federation
Neutral Zone."
	"Mister Crusher, initiate a spiral
course.  Evasion is our top priority.  Mister
Data, what is our present speed?"
	"Warp 2, sir, due to the stresses involved
in our tight spiral course."
	After a while, Riker said, "Ensign Crusher,
change course.  Come up through the center of our 
spiral.  Warp 6.  Mister Worf, are any ships
persisting?"
	"Yes, Commander.  The ships are relaying
information between themselves.  As long as one
ship knows where we are, they will all continue to
follow us."
	"All right then.  Geordi, can the engines 
handle a full 180' turn at Warp 6?"
	"Based on the tests we've run, the 
Enterprise is in peak operating condition.  No
faults in any systems, including Warp drive.
Reduce speed to Warp 3, just in case there's some
hidden defects we haven't discovered yet."
	"Got it, Geordi.  You heard him, Mister
Crusher, reduce speed to Warp 3 and initiate a
180' turn.  Bring our speed up to Warp 6 again as
soon as possible.  Mister Data, where will our 
pursuers expect to meet us?"
	"Logic would indicate that we should alter
course mid-way down the spiral.  They will converge
there."
	"When we reach 25% of the way down the 
spiral, put us back on our original course to the 
Corinhi system, Mister Crusher."
	"Aye, Commander."
	The Enterprise lurched slightly as the
inertial dampers strove to absorb the shock of a
90' turn at Warp 6.
	"Mister Worf, any pursuers now?"
	"Not exactly.  No pursuers but there is 
still a ship coming in our general direction from
out of Klingon space."
	"Can you identify whose side it's on,
Klingon or Federation?  Any name you can put to it?"
asked Riker.
	"It's undoubtedly Federation, an Enterprise 
class vessel.  Still waiting for the computer to
decode identification beacon."  After a pause, Worf
continued, "Commander, I now have the name and
registry of the approaching vessel.  Registry:
NCC - 1701.  It is the ... Enterprise."
	Expressions of surprise circulated around
the Bridge.
	"Mister Data, how long until they are in
visual range if we drop out of Warp now?"
	"Forty-five minutes, Commander."  
Uncharacteristically, Data kept it at that,
fighting his urge to be more precise.  For some
reason the humans seemed to prefer the inaccuracy
of round numbers.
	"Ensign Crusher, one-quarter impulse. 
Data, I want all pertinent details concerning the
original Enterprise and her present complement of
officers."
	"Aye, Commander.  I will begin immediately."
Data left his station at Ops to walk to the Research
station at the rear of the Bridge.  He was 
intrigued at the possibility of meeting the crew
of the Enterprise.  The ship was the most famous 
in Starfleet history and had spawned a whole series
of ships with her name.  Something must have made 
the original Enterprise special and he was 
determined to find out what it was.
	After Commander Riker informed the crew
of the situation, a silence fell over the Bridge
as each member of the Bridge crew contemplated 
their upcoming contact with the Enterprise.  After
thirty minutes had expired, Data reported that he
had finished his research and was ready to report 
his findings.
	"Proceed, Mister Data," said Riker.
	"This Enterprise was refit circa Stardate
7500.  All her systems were updated and her hull
redesigned.  She successfully dealt with V'GER's
attack on Earth and was assigned to another 5-year
mission.  Afterwards, she became a training vessel
for Starfleet Academy cadets.  On one such training
voyage, the Enterprise was forced to battle the 
evil 20th century madman, Khan Noonian Singh.  Khan
threatened Starfleet with the Genesis device, the 
details of which are still classified.  During this
mission, the Vulcan First Officer, Spock, was killed
saving the Enterprise from the detonation of the
Genesis device, but not before passing his katra
on to the ship's doctor.  When trying to rescue the
First Officer's body, the captain of the Enterprise
was forced to initiate the self-destruct sequence
to keep her from being captured by the Klingons."
This brought a low growl from Worf.  "We are
currently within the time period of the 
Enterprise's 5-year mission, immediately preceding
their encounter with Khan."
	"What's the Captain's name, Data?" inquired
Riker.
	"Jean-Luc Picard," answered the android, 
giving Riker a quizzical look.
	This seemed to lighten the mood on the
Bridge, eliciting smiles and chuckles from nearly
everyone.
	"No, Data," said Geordi.  "Who was the
Captain of this eras Enterprise?"
	"Ah ... James Tiberius Kirk."
	"Kirk ... Kirk ... That name sounds 
familiar," said Riker.  "I remember now.  He beat
the Kobayashi Maru simulation at the Academy.  
Wasn't it also his distinctive style of leading
away teams that caused Starfleet to dissuade all
starship captains from leading away teams into
dangerous or questionable situations?  Something
about a risk to the chain of command and a loss
of Starfleet security if anything happened to 
him."
	"Affirmative, Commander.  Although I must
say that it still takes a considerable amount of 
persuasion for captains to adhere to Starfleet's
directive.  Many of them prefer to be on-site
during away team missions," added Data.
	"Mister Data, I thank you for your insights.
Lieutenant Worf, range of the Enterprise."
	"Still beyond visual range but closing
rapidly," replied the Klingon.
	"Thank you, Worf."
	"Due to the state of Federation/Klingon
relations, when we communicate with the Enterprise
from this time, you shouldn't be on the Bridge,
Worf.  I'm sorry," said Riker.
	"I understand, Commander.  I wouldn't want
to jeopardize the mission," said Worf.
	"Worf, take Mister Data with you.  The 23rd
century isn't ready for an android on a starship.  
Call for replacements before you go.  Best personnel
in your department.  You, too, Worf," ordered Riker.
	"Aye, Commander.  Ensign Gawron is on his
way."
	"My replacement is coming, as well, sir. 
Ensign Harris is the most promising member of the 
Ops department," reported Data.
	"Riker to Sickbay.  How is the Captain?"
	"Pulaski here.  He has come out of his coma
but he's still unconscious."
	"That's good to news.  At least his 
condition has improved somewhat.  Keep us informed.
Bridge out."
	As the Turbolift doors opened to admit Worf
and Data, out walked Ensign Christopher Gawron.  
He was tall, a little over six feet in height, and 
had average length, wavy brown hair.  He had the
light complexion of the Northeastern United States
of Old Earth.  He went immediately to Worf's station
and stood at attention, awaiting his orders.
	"Ensign Gawron, have you been briefed on
the details of this mission?" asked Riker.
	"Yes, sir. And I must say that it is a 
dream come true.  I am something of an expert on 
the exploits of the original Enterprise.  But to
finally meet Captain James T. Kirk --" 
	"Try to curb your enthusiasm, Ensign.  We'll
try to keep all communications to a minimum.  Just
try to prove that we are no harm to the Federation
and complete our mission."
	"Aye, sir.  Commander, the Enterprise has
dropped out of Warp and is closing on impulse power,
shields raised," reported Gawron.
	"Raise our shields, too, and go to yellow
alert.  Geordi, better get down to Engineering,
just in case."
	"Aye, sir."  And Geordi LaForge started 
toward the Turbolift just as the doors opened to
allow Ensign Margaret Harris onto the Bridge.
	"Sir," started Ensign Gawron.  Riker 
acknowledged him and he continued, "The Enterprise
is within visual range."
	"On screen," said Riker.
	As Ensign Harris took her seat, the view-
screen lit up to show the cutting edge of Starfleet
technology at that time: A flat saucer section with
a raised Bridge on top, two Warp nacelles rising
above the saucer, held up by engine struts projecting
from the top of the Engineering hull at 75 degrees
above the horizontal.  The Enterprise gleamed a
brilliant white, reflecting the light from distant
stars.  The navigational deflector glowed a bright,
light blue.  It truly looked the part of the flagship
of Starfleet.
	"Ensign Harris, I assume that you know what
this is all about," said Riker.
	"Yes, sir.  We have gone into the Federation's
past to capture a creature that will allow us to
stop the Xin warships.  After trying to avoid all 
contact with vessels from this era, we are slowing
to confront the original Enterprise, in order to
show our non-hostility."  As she spoke, she
unconsciously played with her long, curly brown
hair.  She was of average height for an Earth woman
and looked like she came from the same area of 
Earth as Ensign Gawron.
	"Very good.  I think Data made a good choice.
Mister Gawron, any communications from the Enterprise?"
	"None yet, Commander Riker," he replied.
	"Sickbay to Bridge. Pulaski here."
	"Riker here.  Go ahead, Doctor."
	"Commander, the Captain has just regained
consciousness and wants to know why we're under a
yellow alert.  Shall I tell him? He's very
insistent," queried the ship's Chief Medical Officer.
	"Do you think it's wise?  One of his dreams
has been to speak with the crew of the original
Enterprise and it could come as a shock that we  
are in a situation where that is required," replied
the First Officer.
	"You're right, Will.  He's in no shape for
such a shock.  I'll give him a sedative, just to
force him to get his rest.  Pulaski out."
	"Sir, the Enterprise is hailing us," 
reported Ensign Gawron.
	"On screen."
	On the viewscreen appeared a boyish face,
made older by deep lines of stress, topped by close-
cropped brown hair.  He was dressed in the old style
uniform of a Starfleet admiral.
	"This is Admiral James T. Kirk commanding
the United Starship Enterprise.  Intruder, please 
identify yourself within five minutes or we will 
open fire with all weapons."
		Chapter 5
	Amused expressions made the rounds of the
Bridge as Riker ordered "Screen off."
	"Is he serious?  Our shields can absorb
all the power he's got and still operate at peak
efficiency," said Ensign Harris.
	"I don't know, Ensign.  Deanna, any
impressions?"
	"Commander, I sense that he is serious.
Admiral Kirk sees us as a threat that he must deal
with," replied the Counselor.
	"Excuse me, sir, may I say something?"
	"Is it relevant, Mister Gawron?"
	"I think so, Commander.  About this time,
the Federation experienced a series of border raids.
Many people blamed the Klingons and Romulans but
nothing was ever proven.  Starfleet's main computer
was even broken into once and some information 
about Starship design stolen.  Captain Kirk may
think that we are actually a Klingon or Romulan
attempt at a Federation Starship."
	"Thank you, Ensign.  Now all we have to do
is prove that we are members of the Federation.
Hmm ... Ensign Gawron, I've got a job for you.  
Get down to Holodeck 3 and program it for a 23rd
century Starship Bridge.  Better make it one grade
higher than this time's Enterprise, just to be 
convincing."
	"Aye, sir, I'm on my way," said Gawron, 
running to the Turbolift. 
	"Not so fast, Chris.  Ensign Harris, you
go with him.  Use the replicators to make appropriate
uniforms for all members of the Bridge Crew.  
Hurry or Kirk may call for reinforcements."
	"Yes, sir.  I'll model them after Admiral
Kirk's," she said, swinging her Ops console out of 
the way.  She walked up the ramp and left the 
Bridge with Ensign Gawron.
	"Mister Crusher, have you had any luck in
your experiments to export Holodeck matter into    
the external environment?"
	"Uh, yeah.  Well, sort of.  I can produce
holograms outside of the Holodeck, but they have 
no substance," answered the Helmsman hesitantly.
	"Could you channel the images through
shield control and use them as a sort of cloaking
device?"
	"Probably, Commander," said Wes.     
	"Get on it now.  Use Holodeck 1 and get
Geordi to help you.  Move it."  Wes left the
Bridge.
	"Ensign Ferrar, summon the replacement 
Bridge Crew up here.  You remain here as well,"
Riker ordered Ensign Gawron's replacement.
	"Okay, Deanna, down to Holodeck 3."
	The Counselor and First Officer entered 
the Turbolift and went down to Holodeck 3, where 
they joined the rest of the Bridge Crew, already
in their 23rd century uniforms.  Riker and Deanna
accepted their uniforms from Ensign Harris and 
entered the changing room.  They soon emerged,
Riker as a Captain and Deanna as a Science 
Officer.
	Riker ran down the corridor to where Wes
and Geordi were working at the wall panel outside
Holodeck 1.
	"Commander, I was just about to contact 
you," said Geordi.  "We need to know what design
to use for our shields.  What should we turn the
Enterprise into?"
	"Change us into the same configuration as
the Hood from our time, hull registry NQ - 3000.
Make sure you center the 'Bridge' on Holodeck 3."
	"Aye, sir.  But NQ?" asked Geordi with a 
puzzled frown.
	"He is the reason that we're here, after
all," Riker said as he turned and jogged back to
Holodeck 3.
	"Well, now we just need a name," said Geordi.
	"I have an idea, Geordi, from my Ancient 
Earth history class," said Wes.
	They set to work.
	In the meantime, the others had taken their 
places.
	Riker turned his chair in Ensign Gawron's
direction.  "Good job, Chris.  Only one thing left
to do.  Link Communications from here to the real
Bridge.  It must appear that this is a fully 
functioning Bridge."
	"Way ahead of you, Commander, uh, I mean 
Captain.  The computer will mirror the main view-
screen on this viewscreen.  All communications will
appear to originate from here.  In addition, there
is a hole in your armrest to accommodate your combadge
so that you can talk intraship normally."
	"I hope you're right because we're out of
time.  Mister Crusher, Geordi, are you ready?"
Riker asked, tapping the combadge in his chair arm.
	"Yes, Commander, just finished," they 
answered.
	"Will your illusion interfere with the
transporters in any way?" asked Riker.
	"No, sir," answered Wes, "it's just a 
sophisticated light show."
	"Then on my signal: 'Lower shields', be
ready with your illusion.  Riker out."
	"Aye, sir."
	"Captain, we are being hailed again,"
reported Ensign Gawron.
	"On screen."
	"Please identify yourself.  This is your 
last chance," warned Admiral Kirk from the screen.
	"Mister Gawron, visual channels open.
Admiral Kirk, this is Captain William Riker of 
the experimental vessel NQ-3000.  Welcome back to
Federation space."
	"I know this is somewhat unusual, but we're
the good guys.  Allow me to explain our presence."
	"By all means, proceed," allowed Kirk.
	"This vessel was built in secrecy because
of recent security breaches.  We were on a testing
mission when we were ordered to meet you in case
you were chased across the Neutral Zone by the 
Klingons.  My orders are to ensure that you reach
Earth in one piece, so you can begin your next
assignment."
	"They don't look like any Federation ship
I've ever seen," said a grouchy voice somewhere 
behind Kirk.
	"Quiet, Bones!" Kirk whispered over his
shoulder.  Turning back to the screen he said,
"I'll need some proof, Captain Riker."
	"Certainly, Admiral.  This ship utilizes 
a cloaking device which both shields and disguises
the ship at the same time.  I will now put an end
to this illusion.  Lower shields," Riker ordered,
leaning toward his armrest.
	In the hall, Wesley Crusher tapped a touch
sensitive wall panel.
	On the Enterprise, Kirk's Enterprise, the 
viewscreen shifted from a picture of Riker to a 
view of the other Enterprise, which shimmered and
appeared to disintegrate.  It then reformed into
a 23rd century vessel of advanced design: NQ-3000,
the USS Houdini.
	"Isn't that amazing, Doctor?  I had no
idea that Starfleet technology had advanced that
far."
	"Jim, I'm still not convinced that we were
talking to a Federation starship.  There have been 
no clues as to where this ship has come from and no 
evidence that shields can be used as they suggest.
Scotty could have done that already if it was 
possible.  And why did the markings on her hull
read NCC-1701-D, USS ENTERPRISE?  I don't like 
this, Jim."
	"Doctor, we have been absent from Earth
for quite awhile, in which time there may have been
a great increase in the sophistication of Starfleet
technology.  As to your question, however, I do not
possess enough data to speculate," said Spock from
his science station.
	"A ruse, perhaps, to scare off any foes
it might encounter," spoke up Sulu.  "Many animals
employ the same idea."
	"Hmm ... Maybe, but I think we'd better
see for ourselves.  Uhura, get me Captain Riker."
	"Aye, sir.  On the screen."
	"Captain Riker, that display was impressive,
but forgive me if I'm still doubtful of your 
authenticity.  May I beam over with a small party
to tour the ship?"
	"Of course, Admiral Kirk," said Riker's   
image.  "I'll relay the coordinates of our Bridge
to your Transporter Room.  Riker out."
	The viewscreen reverted to a dark star-
field, at it's center hung the Enterprise, reflecting
the light of a million stars.
	Ensign Harris looked up in horror.  "They
can't beam through our shields.  We can't even do
that.  They'll be scattered all over this sector
of space!"
	"Calm down, Ensign.  Riker to LaForge.
Geordi, monitor the other ship's power levels.
When they're ready to beam over, drop our cloaking
field momentarily, just enough for them to slip
through.  Can you handle that?"
	"Got it, Commander," came Geordi's voice
from the arm of Riker's chair.  "No trouble at
all."
	"Jim, you're not seriously thinking about
going over there, are you?" asked Doctor McCoy,
incredulously.
	"We must be sure that they are non-hostile
and that they really are members of the Federation,"
Spock said impassively.
	"Are you out of your Vulcan mind, Spock.
We're still here, aren't we.  If their power levels
were as high as you said, they could have blasted
us out of the sky by now.  Our continued existence
is proof enough that they're non-hostile.  Why does
it matter whether or not they're Federation?"
asked McCoy irritably.
	"Because, Doctor, if they are non-Federation,
they still occupy a Starfleet vessel.  Either they 
are from Starfleet, there is a security leak some-
where from which they obtained starship plans, or
they have stolen a Federation starship."
	"As none are reported missing, we can 
eliminate this last possibility."
	"But, Spock, --" began McCoy.
	"Gentlemen, gentlemen, please," interrupted
Kirk.  "We can settle this later.  For now, let's
get down to the Transporter Room.  Come on, Spock.
Coming, Doctor?"
	"Of course, Captain.  I have to make sure
you don't break your fool neck in some adolescent
stunt while trying to save the universe singlehanded,"
said the Doctor grumpily as he, Kirk, and Spock
entered the lift.  The Doctor's grumblings could
still be heard for a few seconds after he had left
the Bridge.
	
	"Do you think that's such a good idea,
Commander?  I mean, we can't let them out of here
 
to see the rest of the Enterprise," objected Ensign
Harris.
	"On the contrary, Ensign.  That's exactly
what we're going to do."  Everyone on the 'Bridge'
looked at Riker, shocked.  They awaited his 
explanation.
	"All the other Holodecks except Holodeck 1
have been programmed to be various areas of the ship.
We can use the intraship transporters to move 
from Holodeck to Holodeck.  There should be no problem
as long as no one tries to enter the Holodeck that
we're in at any given moment.  If we had refused 
to let them beam over, they would have become
suspicious.  By giving them a guided tour, we'll 
allay those suspicions."
	"Mister Gawron, make sure you send the correct
'Bridge' coordinates.  It wouldn't do for the most
famous captain in Starfleet to end up in a wall or
on the real Bridge," warned Riker.  "Better make
sure that you drop our shields long enough to beam
them over.  Cut it as close as possible to avoid any
problems.  Better jam their sensors just in case."
	"I verified the coordinates by computer before
I sent them.  They will arrive in the area in front 
of the command chair.  Our computer is tied in to
their transporter and will drop shields for a 
split-second during transport and block their 
sensors," reassured Gawron.
	
	No sooner had he said that, than three 
columns of light appeared and coalesced into the 
forms of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.
	"Welcome, Captain, Mister Spock, Doctor."
Riker shook hands and gave the Vulcan salute where
applicable.  "I'd like you to meet my Bridge Crew.
Science Officer Deanna Troi, Communications Officer
Lieutenant Christopher Gawron,  Helmsman Lieutenant
Margaret Harris, and Navigator Lieutenant David 
Callari."  Riker pointed to each in turn.  
Fortunately, he had had the foresight to temporarily
promote the members of the Bridge Crew.  Captain
Kirk would have been skeptical of a Bridge full of
ensigns.  David Callari was filling in for Wes, who
was monitoring his cloaking device.
	Kirk and Spock were looking around the 
Bridge attentively, McCoy was looking bored.
	"Doctor McCoy, would you like to see our
Sickbay?" asked Riker.
	"I'd rather see my own Sickbay right now,
but as long as I'm here, why not?"
	Riker surreptitiously hit his combadge and
said, "Doctor Pulaski, teleport to the Bridge
immediately."
	"Aye, Captain, I'm on my way."  Doctor
Pulaski shimmered into existence next to Riker's
command chair.  "How may I be of assistance?"
	"Please beam over to Sickbay with Doctor
McCoy and give him a guided tour," said Riker.
	"Sure thing, Captain.  Come along, Doctor.
We're off to Sickbay," she said as McCoy moved to
stand next to her.
	"What do you mean 'beam over to Sickbay?'
What ever happened to walking?"  McCoy asked
hesitantly.
	"We use transporters to travel throughout
the ship.  It's much faster that way and cuts down
on the need for turbolifts so we can have more room
for equipment," answered Pulaski.
	McCoy had grown noticeably paler by the
time the transporter took effect.  They both 
dematerialized into their component atoms, to be
reconstituted in the bogus Sickbay located in
Holodeck 4.
	
	By now, Kirk and Spock had completed their
tour of the Bridge.
	"Well, gentlemen," said Riker, "are you 
ready to see the rest of my ship?"
	"By all means, Captain, lead the way," said 
Kirk, moving toward what appeared to be a Turbolift, 
but was actually the port side head.
	"Wait, Captain.  We don't use Turbolifts
to get around any more.  As Doctor Pulaski said, we use
intraship transporters.  It's much more efficient than walking.
Mister Gawron, if you'd please send us to Engineering."
	"Aye, sir," said Gawron, his hands flying 
over his control panel.  Most of it was for show.
All he did that mattered was to send a pre-recorded
message to Transporter Chief O'Brien that told him
what to do.
	Riker, Kirk, and Spock became columns of 
light and faded to nothingness as they were beamed
to Holodeck 5 to see the fictional Warp Intermix
Chamber.  After a thorough tour of 'Engineering,'
they went to see the Rec Deck, Computer Center,
Mess Hall, Conservatory, Gym, and Weapons Control
Room.  Finally, they went to Sickbay to pick up
Doctor McCoy.
	The four of them beamed back to the Bridge,
leaving Doctor Pulaski in Sickbay.
	"Well, Captain, are you satisfied that we
are who we say we are?"
	"Definitely, Captain Riker.  I'm sorry I 
ever doubted you," replied Kirk.  "Any problems,
gentlemen?"
	"Yeah, Jim.  I'm a Doctor, not a ping-pong
ball.  I'm tired of being bounced all over the place
by that transporter beam.  Let's just get back to
the Enterprise and go home."
	"As you wish, Doctor.  Well, it appears
that we must bid you farewell, Captain Riker.  I
hope we meet again soon."
	"Me too, Captain Kirk, me too.  Goodbye,
Captain, Commander Spock, Doctor McCoy."
	The three Enterprise senior officers
dematerialized on Kirk's command to Scotty: "Three
to beam up."
	"Well, that's that.  Computer, discontinue
programs in all Holodecks except Holodeck 1," 
ordered Riker.
	The Bridge disappeared to be replaced by 
a small room with a yellow grid etched into the
ebony walls.
	"Come on, everyone, back to the Bridge."
	All of the crewmembers left through the 
door in the far wall.  The Holodeck lights went 
out as the doors closed behind Riker, the last
person to leave.  As everyone else went to the
Turbolift, Riker walked the other way to congratulate
Wes and Geordi who still stood outside Holodeck 1.
	"Good work, gentlemen.  Your illusion appeared to be
very convincing.  May I ask just what this ship looked like?"
	"See for yourself, Commander," said Geordi.
	"What do you mean 'see for yourself'?  How can I see
for myself?  Our cloaking device was just a computer generated
image, wasn't it?"
	"Not exactly, sir.  We needed a physical model to
project onto the outer hull of the Enterprise.  That's why 
I've been using the Holodeck as the basis for my experiments,"
explained Wes.
	"What we've done is in effect to turn the Holodeck
inside-out.  Rather than modeling something from the outside
world in the Holodeck, we've projected something from the 
Holodeck into the outside world.  We still have the image in 
the Holodeck.  Come on in," urged Geordi.
	The doors slid open and Wes, Geordi, and Riker entered
Holodeck 1.  They appeared to be walking on nothingness.  The 
walls, ceiling, and floor had become starfields, stretching
away to infinity.  As the door slid closed behind them with
a faint grinding sound, the illusion became complete, if a
little disorienting.  Directly ahead of the trio hung a long,
low starship.  It had an almost flat saucer with immense
impulse engines at the rear.  A short neck connected the 
saucer to a long, graceful secondary hull.  The warp nacelles,
almost double the length of the secondary hull, rose just 
above the top of the saucer.  They were connected to the top
of the engineering section by narrow, right-angled warp
engine struts.
	Riker walked around the ship and whistled 
appreciatively.  "I'm impressed.  I just have one question:
What would have happened if we needed to fire phasers or
photon torpedos?"
	"No problem, Commander," answered Wes.  "We lined up
the forward torpedo tubes on the Houdini with those on the 
Enterprise.  We lined up the phaser banks on both ships as
closely as possible, too.  Watch."
	"Computer," he said, raising his voice.  "Superimpose
Galaxy class Enterprise onto existing image of the Houdini."
	The light blue image of the Enterprise shimmered into
existence around the Houdini.  The Enterprise's saucer section
dwarfed the Houdini's.  The bridge of the Houdini was located
in the center of the Enterprise's saucer.  As Wes had said, the
photon torpedo tubes lined up, as did many of the phaser banks.
The ships were the same length, but the Enterprise was much
wider, yet still the more graceful of the two.
	After studying the ships for awhile, Riker said, 
"Come on you two, we've got a job to do."
	As the doors shut behind them, the Holodeck went dark.
			Chapter 6
	"You don't mean to tell me that you actually 
believed that?"
	"Now, now, Doctor.  We have no reason to doubt them,"
said Kirk.
	"Indeed, Doctor, your attitude is not logical.  They
have shown us their ship and have not acted in any way 
hostile toward us."
	"But Spock, can your damn green-blooded Vulcan logic
explain away the Klingon lifesign your sensors registered?"
	"Obviously the sensors had a malfunction or there is
indeed a Klingon on the Houdini as a prisoner," said the 
Vulcan.
	"Alright Spock, what about their power levels?  You
said that they didn't register on your scanners.  Don't you
think that if Starfleet had come up with a ship like that 
that somehow we would have heard of it?"
	"Please, Doctor, even you must be familiar with the 
department of Starfleet entitled `Security.'  One of their 
main jobs would have been to keep this ship a secret.  Their
energy levels may merely be a ruse to intimidate their 
enemies, just as their cloaking device is.  All the data on
hand point to this conclusion," finished Spock.
	Chekov turned from his console long enough to whisper
to Sulu, "I bet the technology was inwented by Russians."
Sulu just rolled his eyes and concentrated on his own
console.
	"Captain Kirk, the Houdini is hailing us," said Uhura.
	"On screen."
	"Audio only, sir," said Uhura apologetically.
	"Okay, let me hear it."
	"Captain Kirk, this is Captain Riker.  I regret to
report that we must leave you now.  Starfleet has ordered 
us to investigate reports of a Klingon secret weapon in
the Vexis Corinhi system.  The Enterprise is to return to
Earth as per instructions.  Riker out."
	"You heard the man, Sulu.  Let's go home.  Warp 
factor 5."
	"Aye, Captain, warp 5."
	"The Enterprise slowly moved away from the Houdini
and, trailing a bright rainbow of colors, accelerated to
Warp 5 and was gone.
	"Mister Gawron, did your plan work?"
	"I think so, Commander.  The subliminal message that
Lieutenant Commander Data and I worked on was broadcast with
your farewell message.  Every time their communications system
is used, it will be broadcast ship-wide.  Soon no one on their
Enterprise will remember that they ever met us,"  answered 
Ensign Gawron.
	"And you say that it works like a computer virus,
only in this case, the message will stop being transmitted
after a few months?"
	"That is essentially correct, sir.  Like a 
computer virus, it will move onto any communication system
that comes in contact with an infected one.  It will not only
transmit a message erasing the memories of us from organic
beings, but will also destroy any records of us in the ship's
computer banks,"  answered Data, standing with Gawron and 
Riker at the Communications station.
	"Good work, Data."
	"On the contrary, Commander.  Ensign Gawron came up
with the idea.  I merely wrote the software," corrected Data.
	"I'm sorry.  Ensign Gawron, good work."
	The Turbolift doors opened to allow Worf onto the
Bridge.  He walked to the Communications station and relieved
Gawron.
	"I yield to your experience and skill, Lieutenant 
Worf, and am honored to have been given the opportunity to
serve in your place."
	Gawron entered the Turbolift after Riker dismissed
him.  Data walked down the ramp to the lower Bridge.  He
took the place of Ensign Harris, who entered the Turbolift 
with Gawron.  As an afterthought, Riker tapped his combadge 
and said, "Bridge to Ensigns Gawron and Harris.  Be ready, 
we may require your services again before we're done with
this mission.  Bridge out."
	"Mister Data, status report."
	"All systems operating within acceptable limits.
Shields are not yet functional because of our cloaking 
device.  Commander LaForge is working on it now and 
estimates full defensive capabilities within 10 minutes."
	"Alright, Mister Crusher, resume course and speed 
to the Corinhi system."
	"Riker to Sickbay.  Doctor Pulaski, how's the 
Captain doing?"
	"He's awake and asking questions again.  What should
I do?"
	"If you think he's strong enough, fill him in on 
what's happened up to this point."
	"I think he can handle it, Will.  I'll take the 
chance.  Pulaski out."
	"Now entering Klingon space.  Sensors show no
vessels within range," reported Data as the connection to 
Sickbay closed.
	For hours they flew on.  From time to time Riker 
asked for status reports from the various department heads
including Geordi in Engineering and Pulaski in Sickbay.  
Everything was working normally on the Enterprise, all
systems running at or near peak efficiency.  In addition,
Captain Picard's condition was improving.
	In short, things where looking up for the Enterprise,
when, true to form the ship was struck by a barrage of phaser
fire.  Once again, the red alert klaxons filled the Bridge 
with their grating blare.
	Riker leapt into action immediately.  "Worf, damage
report.  Data, shields up.  Full sensor sweep of the area.
Mister Crusher, full stop."
	"All decks reporting in.  No damage, sir," reported
Worf. 
	"Full sensor scan reveals no ships in the area other
than ourselves.  Shields at full strength," said Data.
	"Pulaski to Bridge.  Can you stop all that knocking
around up there, Commander?  I have some patients in critical
condition and your bouncing around is not improving their
health!  Pulaski out!" snapped the Doctor.
	On the viewscreen, the empty starfield shimmered to
reveal six Klingon Birds of Prey as they decloaked.  The 
Enterprise was surrounded.
	"Commander, the Captain of one of the Klingon vessels
is hailing us," Worf rumbled from the rear of the Bridge.
	"One-way visual.  Don't let him see us," responded 
Riker.
	The viewscreen lit up to show the dark, mist filled
Bridge of one of the Klingon ships.  In the center seat sat
an imposing Klingon, heavily armored for battle as was the
custom among Klingons.  His black hair fell about his 
shoulders, moving as if infested with vermin, which it 
probably was.
	"Federation vessel, if that is what you are, your 
ship is new to me, but I recognize the name Enterprise.  It
shall be a pleasure to destroy our hated enemy, Captain
James T. Kirk.  Respond, Kirk.  I will hear your pleas for
mercy before I open fire," the Klingon commander said in a 
deep, rasping voice.
	"Worf, change into some Klingon battle armor.  Wesley,
help Worf in programming the replicators for this era," 
ordered Riker.
	As Worf and Wesley left, Deanna said, "Something 
doesn't feel right, Commander.  I did not feel any emotions
from the Klingon commander.  No hate, no curiosity, nothing."
	Tapping his combadge, Riker urged, "Get a move on
Worf, Wesley."  Then to Troi, "What do you mean, the Klingon 
Commander had no emotions?  He sounded excited enough."
	"It is as if nothing was there.  I can sense the 
emotions of the Enterprise personnel, but I get nothing from
the Klingons.  At this range I should be able to sense 
something," insisted the Counselor.
	"Mister Data, scan the Klingon ships for lifesigns,
power sources, anything," said Riker.
	After a momentary pause, the android reported, 
"Sensors do not register any ships other than the Enterprise
in this sector.  As far as the computer is concerned, there
are no Klingon ships."
	"In that case, lock phasers on the Klingon ship in
front of us and fire when ready."
	"Phasers will not lock on target, Commander.  Firing
phasers manually," informed Data.
	On the viewscreen, a bolt of searing red light shot
out of the lower collimator ring of the Enterprise.  It 
lanced toward the nearest Klingon ship and passed through it.
All six Klingon ships shrank to nothingness and disappeared.
	"Commander, sensors register an immense energy source
approaching from behind us.  It is on an intercept course."
	"Thank you, Data.  Lieutenant Worf, Ensign Crusher,
to the Bridge immediately," Riker said into the overhead
Bridge speaker.  "Mister Data, reverse angle on the screen
and magnify."
	The viewscreen changed to show a blue and orange
sphere approaching rapidly.  All of the Bridge crew knew
what this meant, so no one had to tell Worf and Wesley what
was happening when they arrived on the Bridge.  Inevitably,
the red mesh of a giant forcefield surrounded the Enterprise.
	In a flash of light, Q appeared on the Bridge, this
time dressed in the ceremonial gown and mortarboard of a 
college professor from Old Earth.
	"You have done well, students.  You have passed two
of the tests that I have set for you.  I must admit that you
humans are very resourceful.  Especially you, Riker.  I didn't
think you were capable of the level of deceit you used on 
Captain Kirk and were about to use on the Klingons.  I'm
really very impressed," said Q, in a tone of voice that 
passed for sincerity.
	"Just what do you want, Q?  Why have you come back 
in time to bother us?" demanded Picard as he strode from the
Turbolift.  The only sign of his injury was a small patch of
synthoskin covering the wound on his temple.  He stopped 
directly in front of Q.
	"Ah, Jean-Luc.  I'm glad to see you again.  To tell 
you the truth, Riker is no where near as much fun to deal 
with as you are," said Q.
	"You mean humiliate and mock!" snapped Picard.
	"By no means.  I find humans fascinating, and since
you've been one nearly twice as long as Riker, I find you 
twice as fascinating," explained Q smugly.
	"Enough, Q.  Why are you here?"
	"Patience, mon capitaine.  I'm here to tell you 
about the next phase of your quest, if you'll allow me a
word in edge-wise," said Q sarcastically.
	"In order to complete your mission, one of you must
go on a quest.  There will be many perils and great danger.
I will choose the questor myself.  Let's see...your Tin Man
and microbrain are too strong, Riker has too much experience,
Picard is too old, and the boy and the Counsellor would never
stand a chance."
	"Q, why not let Lieutenant LaForge go.  He is as   
close as any of us to average human physical condition,"
suggested Picard.
	"No, Captain.  His blindness would be too great a
handicap.  The questor must have a chance to complete the
quest if this is to be a fair challenge," said Q.
	"A fair challenge?!?  You've eliminated all of the
Bridge crew from contention.  Who's left?" asked Riker.
	"I never said it had to be an officer, did I?  You
forget that there are over 1000 people on this ship to chose
from, not just you seven.  My choice is Ensign Cristopher 
Gawron.  I like him for some reason.  He appears to be the
least pretentious of the Bridge crew."
	With a flash, Ensign Gawron appeared on the Bridge,
dressed in his gold uniform and fitted with a tricorder and
hand phaser.  He looked disoriented until he realized where
he was.
	"What happened?  How did I get here?  I was playing
billiards on the Rec Deck and then ZAP..."  he asked, 
looking confused.
	"I am of the Q and you have been chosen to undertake
a quest.  The rules are simple.  Usig only your phaser and
your wits you must find the ships dilithium crystals."  The
ship's entire supply of dilithium crystals suddenly appeared
in a pile in the center of the Bridge.  "They will all be 
located in one spot.  Just touch them and you will be 
instantly transported back here and the crystals replaced.
	"There will be no pressure placed upon you to under-
take this quest.  Just know that the lives of the Enterprise
crew and consequently the future of the Federation depend 
upon you."
	"You can't be serious, Q.  This man is just an ensign.
He has no experience in this type of thing and you have no 
right to subject him to it."
	"Alright, Picard, let me put it this way.  Would 
all the omnipotent beings present raise their right hand? 
There, see.  I only see one hand up, and oh look, it's mine.
Can you beat that?  It looks like you've been outvoted."
	"Be careful, Picard, or I may just decide to leave
you here in the past.  No one tells me what I can or can't
do.  Are you ready, Ensign?"
	Before he could answer, both Gawron and Q vanished.
Q's head reappeared a moment later to say: "I will allow you
to watch Mister Gawron's progress on the viewscreen.  Good-
bye, crew."  Q's head winked out of existence.
	"Captain, the Enterprise has been transported into
orbit around a large planet," reported Data.
	As soon as Q had vanished, the energy field on the 
screen was replaced by a huge brown planet.
	"Sensors show what appears, at one time, to have been
a small town or village.  Reading one human lifesign, and 
many large, primitive animals," reported Worf.
	"Thank you Worf, Data," Picard said.  "Now all we
have to do is watch and wait."
	"LaForge to Bridge."
	"Go ahead, Geordi," acknowledged Riker.
	"Commander, I don't know how, but the dilithium
crystals are missing.  Both Warp and impulse engines are
down.  We have no maneuvering capabilities whatsoever,"
warned the Chief Engineer.
	"Captain," interjected Data, "Our orbit is decaying.
Estimate 8 hours until we enter the atmosphere, and an
additional 3 hours until planetfall."
	"Can our shields handle the atmospheric friction,"
asked Picard.
	"Captain, we have no shields.  If we enter the 
atmosphere, we'll most likely burn up,"  cam Geordi's voice
over the intercom channel.
	"And if we don't burn up, we will be travelling at
an estimated 200 meters per second upon planetfall.  The
Enterprise will not survive," said Data somberly.
	The viewscreen changed yet again.  This time it
showed Ensign Gawron at the edge of an old, tumbled down
town.  He entered, cautiously.

		Chapter 7
	Slowly, Chris started toward the nearest building 
in the town.  Inside, it was dark.  As he crossed the threshold,
he noticed a dank, mouldering smell.  Most of the furniture 
was rotted through with age and dampness.  A few of the pieces
still appeared to be in good shape.  He rested his hand on 
the nearest chair and jumped back, startled, as it disintegrated
into a pile of soft, rotten wood.  In the far corner, Chris 
noticed a pile of what he thought were tattered blankets.
Upon closer inspection, though, it turned out to be the former
occupant of the house.  The bones had yellowed and grown
brittle over the years.
	Since there wasn't anything of use here, he moved 
on to the next building to find an almost identical scene.
Chris moved on, finding each building as dilapidated as the 
last, until, finally, he came to what appeared to have been
some kind of store.
	As he looked through the various shelves, Chris
found little of use.  There were, however, a strong coil of
rope and a long, sharp knife.  The rope was in surprisingly
good condition, compared with its surroundings, and the knife
showed some signs of corrosion but looked as if it could be
used adequately as a cutting tool, and for defense if 
absolutely necessary.
	Slipping the knife into his belt and looping the 
rope over his shoulder, Ensign Gawron left the tumble-down
shop to explore the rest of the town.  Other than the 
decaying bones of the natives and a few rusted through cooking
utensils, there was nothing to see.
	By the time he had reached the last house, Chris had
given up much hope of finding anything that could help him on
his quest, particularly because he didn't know what his quest
would entail.  As he entered the last building, he noticed
that it was the only one to have any kind of floor covering,
this in the form of an ancient rug.  The tattered cloth lay
incongruously in the center of the room.  He tried to move
it, but found that it was firmly secured to the ground and
would not rip, despite its obvious age.  Gawron drew his 
phaser and fired.  The carpet burned away to reveal a 
weathered door, made of some metal he didn't recognize.  There
didn't seem to be any way of lifting it, as the surface was
completely featureless.
	"Oh well, time to get to work," Chris said to himself
and inserted the knife into the nearly imperceptible seam 
between the door and the floor around it.  He pushed down with 
all his strength until the door was up just high enough for
him to kick a rock into the gap.
	He returned the knife to his belt and sat down until
he caught his breath.  He noticed that it took longer than
usual and realized that Q hadn't warned him about this 
planets thin atmosphere.  Then, rising, Chris hefted the door
back and it landed on the floor with a resounding thud. 
There was now a dark, gaping hole in the floor.  The rock
that had been propping the door open now fell in and Chris
counted the seconds before he heard the rock hit bottom.
After an eternity, that was really only seven seconds, the
small crack of rock on rock was heard.  He estimated that 
the pit was at least 250 meters deep.  
	Ensign Gawron hurriedly grabbed some cloth scraps
off of one of the corpses in the corner, but couldn't bring
himself to wrench off a femur.  Instead he found a reasonably
sound chair leg, tied the cloth scraps to it, and lit it with
a low intensity burst from his phaser.  Tying a knot in one 
end of his rope, he lifted the door just enough to slide the 
rope under it, the knot preventing, he hoped, the rope from
sliding down with him once he put his full weight on it.  
The other end of the rope was tossed into the pit.  Grabbing 
the torch with one hand, he started down the rope into the 
hole.  It took about fifteen minutes to reach the floor below.
	Slowly, Chris surveyed the situation.  He was in a large 
cavern with a vaulted ceiling.  Rocks and bones of various 
shapes and sizes littered the cave floor.  Three tunnels 
branched off in front of him.
	Since he couldn't think of anything better to do,
Chris arbitrarily chose the rightmost tunnel and started to 
explore.  He had barely gone around the first bend when he 
was forced to stop abruptly at the edge of a yawning chasm.
He tossed a rather large stone down into the darkness.  Soon
it was lost from torchlight.  He waited five seconds for it 
to hit bottom ... ten seconds ... fifteen seconds ... twenty
seconds passed and still he heard no sound from below.  A 
rocky outcropping projected out over the pit, about halfway
across, well out of Chris' reach.
	Looking beside him, Ensign Gawron saw a broad-
leafed plant.  Curious, he broke off a leaf and examined it.
Some fluid, sap he assumed, ran out of the leaf onto his 
hands.  It was thick and extremely sticky.  Suddenly, he had
an idea.
	Dropping the leaf, Chris ran back to the cavern and
cut off as much of his rope as he could reach.  He estimated
that he had twelve or thirteen feet, as the rope had been just
two meters longer than the depth of the pit.  He scooped up a
handful of rocks and ran back to the edge of the pit, careful 
not to get too close for fear of falling in.
	Back on the Enterprise, a confused look came over 
Riker's face as Chris, on the viewscreen, split one end of the
rope lengthwise, coated the strands with sap, and then wrapped
them around the stones he had picked up. 
	"What the hell does he think he's doing?  This is no
time for arts and crafts!" asked Riker.
	Data, sitting at Ops turned and said, "I believe his
purpose will become clear in a moment, sir."
	On the screen, Chris dried the sap with flames from
his torch, all the while, careful not to set the rope itself
ablaze.  Then, swinging it in wide circles, he let it fly out 
over the pit.  The heavy end wrapped itself around the rocky 
outcropping a few times and Chris pulled on the rope to make
sure it would hold.  Confident in its strength, he picked up 
his torch and swung out across the abyss.  The torchlight
danced eerily on the walls, making Chris unsure where the 
other side of the pit really was.  He tossed the torch as 
far as he could toward the other side of the pit and it
landed about 2 meters from the edge and bounced to a halt.
The light steadied and Chris readied himself for his leap
off the rope.  As his swing reached its greatest length 
toward the far side, he jumped off the rope.  
	Troi gasped in horror as Chris mistimed his leap and
slammed into the edge of the pit.  
	His hands clawing furiously for some purchase on the
hard ground, Chris slowly slid farther over the edge.  Finally,
just as he was about to fall to his death, he found a handhold
and he hoisted himself away from the edge and lay flat on his 
back, trying to regain the strength in his arms.  When they 
were no longer throbbing from the exertion, he got to his 
feet, retrieved his torch, and set off down the tunnel.
Eventually, Chris came upon an underground lake.  It was the 
width of the tunnel and swallowed his torchlight, providing no
view of the bottom, if indeed there was one.  Chris decided to
swim out a little way to see how far he could proceed.  He walked 
in the cold water, torch held high above his head to prevent it
from accidentally being extinguished.  Soon, when the water 
became to deep to wade any further, he began to swim.  For 
a few hundred meters, he swam along easily until the tunnel 
roof sloped down to meet the water, blocking his advance.
	He weighed his options.  He could return to the 
original junction and try a different tunnel or he could
press on.  He decided to keep going, since the other two
tunnels could be false leads and he'd end up back here anyway.
Unfortunately, he'd have to give up his torch.  In order to
provide as much light as possible, at least for awhile, he
jammed the torch into a depression in the rocky wall before
him.  Then, taking a few deep breaths to hyperoxygenate his
blood, Ensign Gawron slipped below the obsidian surface of the
lake.  Luckily, the water was clear, if a little dark, and the 
torch provided ample illumination.  Swimming quickly, looking
everywhere for a tunnel or some other way to proceed, he went
deeper and deeper.  Finally, as he approached the lake bottom,
Gawron found what he was looking for: a tunnel, more than wide
enough for him to swim through.  He was so excited about his
find that he entered the tunnel without noticing the bones of
various other explorers, half buried in the ooze.
	At the other end of the tunnel, he could see a dim
light.  Eagerly Chris swam on.  Ahead, a dark shape separated
itself from the tunnel floor.  There was some kind of 
phosphorescence in the tunnel walls which allowed Chris to see,
barely.  Soon the shape revealed itself to be an alien fish,
mouth open, teeth glinting in the dim light, headed directly
towards him.  It had a long, muscular neck, stream-lined body,
and powerful tail.  Its two forward flippers were spade shaped
and propelled it along at at least ten knots.  On its head
were two short, horn-shaped projections that Chris assumed 
were sense organs, the creature being nearly blind living in
the shadowy depths as it did.
	All of these observations were made while Chris struggled
to slip the knife out of his belt.  Too late he realized it 
was futile.  The creature was on him, twining its neck around
him, trying to squeeze the life out of him.  Sharp teeth gnashed
at him.  
	Chris knew that he was running out of both time and
options.  His lungs already ached for clean air and what oxygen 
was left was being slowly forced out by the creature's reptilian
embrace.
	As darkness fought for control of his peripheral vision,
he remembered his phaser.  The water would diffuse the beam, 
but that would work to his advantage if the creature had even 
rudimentary vision.  Slipping the phaser out of its holster
on his belt, he set it for wide dispersal and fired it directly
into the creature's eyes.  He noted with satisfaction that the
creature's sensory horns suffered slight burns, as did most 
of the thing's face.  Shocked and in pain, the creature 
loosened its grip and Chris kicked free, swimming as hard as 
he could to the end of the tunnel.  He broke the surface of 
the water into the cool, sweet air just as the blackness which 
had battled for the periphery of his vision had won and was
creeping inward.
	After catching his breath, he gave himself a quick
once-over looking for any injuries.  The dull pain in his
side told him that he had bruised some ribs, but that seemed
the worst of his injuries.
	Gathering himself, he started off down the tunnel.  
Again he noted the phosphorescence in the walls and assumed 
that it was some kind of light emitting mineral indigenous 
to this planet.  As time was of the essence, he gave it only 
a cursory examination and continued off down the passage.
	Eventually, the tunnel widened and Chris found himself
in a sort of room, carved out of the rock.  The floor was 
covered in a mosaic of different sized tiles, many of which
were covered with soot and what looked like grease.  In the
wall to his left he noticed several small holes surrounded by
black, oily patches of rock.  Between the holes were larger,
dark patches of soot and ash.  Curious, Chris looked across
at the other wall.  Opposite the larger patches were holes,
similar to those on the near wall.  In addition, the holes
on the near wall were directly across from large, oily stains
identical to those he had just examined.  
	Moving forward to investigate, Chris tripped over
a loose piece of tile and fell, his hand striking a piece of
the mosaic floor.  The tile disappeared into the floor as 
flames shot from the apertures in both walls.  After a few 
seconds they extinguished themselves and Chris stood up.  He
had felt the heat from the flames on his back.  He took out
his knife and tossed it further across the floor.  Immediately
flames shot forth.  Chris waited for them to die down and then
ran as fast as he could, feet barely touching the ground.  
Fortunately, when he did touch the ground, he seemed to land 
only on safe tiles, because the flamethrowers remained inactive,
at least until he was three quarters of the way across.  He
felt rather than saw the flames spring forward to envelope 
him.  With a last, desperate burst of speed, Ensign Gawron
launched himself through the far doorway.  He landed, slapping
at his clothes, rolling to smother the flames.  He had been
lucky, his wet clothes had protected him for the most part.
Now his clothes were dry and he was ready to continue.  He
thought about retrieving the knife, but when he saw how far
into the room it was, he changed his mind.  He walked around
a bend in the tunnel and came upon a blank wall.  
	Just as he was about to give up and turn back, he 
noticed a button below a sign that read "PRESS ME."  Figuring
he had nothing to lose, Chris reached toward the button and
as his finger touched it...he felt his body slowly dissolve.
	On the Bridge, all was confusion.  Worf was fuming
about what he perceived to be duplicity on Q's part.  Picard
and Riker were talking anxiously among themselves, Troi 
occasionally interjecting a comment.  Wesley was scanning the
planet's surface for any sign of human life readings.  Data 
was the only one who did not show any outward signs of emotion.
Instead, he merely looked at the viewscreen, analyzing what
had happened, occasionally glancing at his control panel, where
the time left to them was counting down.
	"We have only seven hours, forty-three minutes, and
fifteen seconds before we impact with the planet," read off
Data.  Immediately silence reigned.  
	"Let's hope that both Q and Gawron know what they're
doing," said Riker hopefully.
	"Gawron has confidence in himself," said Troi.  "Q, as
always, is an unknown.  We must treat him with caution."
	"Agreed.  I have no wish to spend the rest of my 
existence trapped in the past," said Picard.
	"Especially since we may cease to exist if we change
the past sufficiently.  It would be a life of constant paranoia
and dread that our actions may endanger our continued 
existence and that of our history as we know it," informed
Data.
	On the viewscreen, Gawron had reappeared in the 
original junction.
	Assuming that it was Q's work, Chris wasted no time 
and set off down the middle tunnel.  As he did, he noticed 
that the knife had been replaced in his belt.  "I guess Q 
wants me to have some kind of a chance," he thought to 
himself.
	Soon, the tunnel narrowed and Ensign Gawron noticed 
that it was littered with thick, green tendrils.  Not paying
them much mind, he forged ahead.  But as soon as his foot 
touched one of them, they all came to life, twisting around
his legs.  Instantly, the phaser appeared in one hand, the 
knife in the other.  Simultaneously firing and slashing, he
slowly forced his way ahead.  Soon the tunnel behind him was 
filled with burned or bleeding tentacles, many still writhing
spasmodically.  The air was thick with the smell of charred
plants.  Still Chris fought on, swinging away with the knife
and firing left and right.  He had slipped into a fighting
frenzy, firing and slashing wildly, when he noticed that the
charge on his phaser was low.  Deciding to preserve as much 
as possible, he stopped firing and forced himself to calm
down.  He cut his way through the remaining tendrils.
	Finally he was through and, looking ahead, Chris saw
a shimmering pool and realized for the first time how thirsty
he had become.  Slipping his weapons back into their storage 
areas on his belt, Chris ran forward and fell at the edge of 
the pool.  As he bent to take a drink, he noticed the skeleton
of an alien warrior, half in and half out of the pool.  His 
lips were almost touching the surface of the pool when he 
sensed that something was wrong with the skeleton.  It simply
wasn't there below the pool's surface.  Chris kicked the rest
of the creature into the pool.  It sank slowly and then the 
corpse bubbled away.  Soon nothing remained of the alien but
a greasy spot, which soon dispersed. 
	"Acid," Gawron thought.  "I have to be more careful.
Oh well, no sense killing myself over a drink."  Still thirsty,
he continued on.  After walking for what he estimated to be 
an hour, he felt a slight breeze on his cheek and heard a low
whirring sound, as if something was rushing past his ear.
Drawing his knife, he held it up in front of him.  It was 
immediately snatched from his grasp and broken in two by a
seemingly invisible force.  Upon closer examination, however,
Chris saw a razor thin blade spinning at eye level, so thin 
as to be invisible in the dim light to any unsuspecting
traveler.
	"Gives new meaning to the phrase `a little off the
top,'" Chris thought out loud.  Ducking, he quickly moved 
past the blade.  Again he reached a dead end tunnel.  This
time when he tried to move, he found he couldn't.  Looking
down, he saw that he was trapped in some sort of sticky ooze.
Just out of reach was the button that said "PRESS ME."  He 
dared not try to stretch further.  If he fell, Chris doubted 
that he could get back up off the floor.  Drawing his phaser,
he tried to melt the glue to no avail.  Finding only one option
open to him, Gawron threw the phaser as hard as he could at
the "PRESS ME" button.
	As soon as the phaser made contact, he found himself
at the familiar junction.  Directly ahead of him, the phaser
clattered to the floor a short distance into the middle tunnel.
Chris retrieved it, noticing that it was now his only weapon,
as the knife had not been replaced this time.  Remarkably, 
the tricorder which hung over his should had survived unscathed
so far.
	Returning to the junction, Ensign Gawron set off down
the third, and he hoped final, tunnel.  Before he had gotten
far, however, he heard a low rumbling and turned just in time 
to see the cavern roof collapse, blocking off any hopes of 
retreat.  
		Chapter 8
	Chris dodged out of the way of the still falling
ceiling and ran down the tunnel.  After the rumbling had 
finally ceased, he went back just far enough to pick up a 
piece of the rubble that exhibited the peculiar phosphorescence,
intending to study it further after his return to the 
Enterprise.  "That is, if I return," he reminded himself.
	Continuing down the passage, Chris observed no 
remains of any kind.  He found this surprising, until he
realized that Q probably constructed the whole labyrinth.
If Q didn't want it to seem that others had gotten this far,
it was up to him.
	Lost in thought, Chris panicked as the floor fell
out from under him.  Although surprised, he still managed to
leap onto more solid ground.  He rolled and came up facing 
the direction he had come, phaser in hand.  Where there had
been ground moments before, was just a large hole.  Inside,
Gawron could see the phosphorescence glinting off sharp 
sticks covered with liquid that tricorder analysis proved to
be poison.
	"Maybe Q isn't as fond of the Enterprise crew as he
says.  I don't think I was meant to survive."  Resigning
himself to his fate, he ventured on.  Soon, the walls became
less craggy and resolved themselves into a series of sharp
outcroppings.  Chris's foot came down with a sharper click
than his boots had been making.  Suspiciously he looked 
around and saw that the walls had begun to come together,
narrowing the passage.  He could just make out the forward
edge of the sliding walls.  He glanced behind him and saw
that he had not quite come halfway.  Deciding quickly, he
ran down the tunnel towards the far end, occasionally checking 
his progress.  When the passageway, not very wide to begin 
with, had shrunk to half its width, Chris put his head down
in an all-out sprint toward the end of the passage.
	He emerged from the closing walls, panting, and 
turned in time to see them close to eighteen inches and slam
shut.  By now, Gawron's uniform shirt was all but destroyed
and his pants hung in tatters below his knees.
	Looking ahead, Chris noticed a strange glow, stronger
than the walls' natural phosphorescence, emanating from around
a bend in the cave wall.  Approaching warily, he rounded the
bend and saw where the bluish light was coming from: the
ceiling.
	"Captain, sensors indicate a source of hard radiation
has just appeared on the planet," reported Data.
	"Location in relation to Mister Gawron."
        "The radiation is distorting the readings, but he
appears to be standing within it."
	"Must be coming from the ceiling," said Riker.  "How
long can he be safely exposed to it, Data?"
	"Any exposure to radiation is unsafe, Commander, but
there will be no irreparable damage for at least forty-five
minutes.  I cannot be more precise."    
	"Great he has forty-five minutes, and we have two
and a half hours," muttered Riker.
	"Engineering to Bridge, LaForge here."
	"What is it, Geordi?" asked Picard.
	"Captain, we've been in the planet's atmosphere for 
thirty-two minutes and the hull temperature has already 
reached 200 degrees Centigrade.  Without shields, we don't
have as long as we normally would," came the voice from the
intercom.
	"Acknowledged, Lieutenant.  Do what you can.  Bridge
out," snapped Riker, upset at his inability to do anything 
useful.
	"Take it easy, Number One.  We have Q trying to kill
us already.  We don't need anyone else's help to do it for 
him," said Picard warningly.
	"Aye, sir," said Riker, a little too loudly, a little
too formally.
	Taking out his tricorder, Chris aimed it upwards.  
After scanning the tunnel roof for a few seconds, he read the 
results of the analysis.  The ceiling was coated with nearly
pure, energized dilithium.  Prolonged exposure would result
in a horrible death from radiation poisoning causing rapid
decay and massive systems disfunctions.  As he put the tricorder
away, his rock sample fell from his belt and bounced.  The 
stone leapt up to shoulder height, where Chris caught it,
startled.  He put it back into his belt.
	"Reduced gravity.  Sure, why should Q make anything
simple."
	Laying down on his stomach, Chris began a slow,
relaxed crawl through the anti-grav field, careful not to
make any sudden, violent movements which would result in his
being thrown at least partly to the tunnel roof.
	After nearly thirty minutes, Ensign Gawron had made
his way under the fifty foot stretch of dilithium.  Gratefully,
he stood, his uniform shirt falling in shreds to the ground to
reveal his chest, covered in lacerations, both large and small.
His back was covered with bruises and burns.
	Deciding to talk to Captain Picard about combat pay
upon his return to the ship, he proceeded around another bend
and was confronted by a blank wall of rock.  He search 
exhaustively for the familiar button that would return him to
the junction, but could not find it.
	Finally defeated, with no retreat possible, Chris
slumped against the dead end wall -- and fell through it.  
He found himself in a large chamber.  There, on a stone 
pedestal, sat the pile of dilithium crystals.  Rising quickly,
footsteps echoing loudly, he grabbed the dilithium crystals.
In a flash, his rocky surroundings were replaced by the 
familiar environs of the Enterprise.
	Riker was talking to LaForge over the intercom.
"... don't care what you have to do.  Get out and push if you
have to.  We've been in the atmosphere for nearly an hour."
  
	"Commander, hull temperature is increasing.  Fifteen
hundred degrees Celsius and rising.  Estimated survival time
of the Enterprise, assuming temperature increase continues
at this rate is one hour, thirty-eight minutes, fourteen point
eight three five six ni--" 
	"Commander Data," spoke up Chris from the back of the
Bridge, no one having noticed him, "I've got the crystals.
How long will it take to install them and power up the
engines?"
	The channel to Engineering still open, Geordi 
answered: "Installation will take about ten minutes.  Restart
will take an hour and a half."
	"Two minutes too long.  What happens if you bypass
the safety checks?" asked Picard, anxiously.  While he waited
for the answer he turned to Data and Gawron.  "Get down to 
Engineering as fast as possible."  Data and Chris left the
Bridge.
	"Under present circumstances, I was going to bypass
the safety sequence anyway.  That gains us about forty-five
minutes," came the answer from the Bridge speaker.
	"Do it, Geordi.  As quickly as possible," ordered
Picard.  "Bridge out."
	Picard noticed that he was sweating and turned to 
survey the Bridge.  Everyone there had a sheen of perspiration
on their faces.  The humans were red-faced from the heat.
Picard knew that the environmental controls were suffering 
from the heat of the atmospheric friction. 
	He flicked on the intraship communicator.  "This
is your captain speaking.  We have entered the atmosphere
of an unknown world.  The increased heat is from the 
atmospheric friction.  Steps are being taken to remove the
Enterprise from danger.  In the meantime, all non-duty 
personnel and civilians, remain in your quarters and keep
your physical activity to a minimum.  Picard out."
	The Bridge was silent.  Periodically reports came in
from Engineering.  There were no major problems and the restart
process was nearly complete when the red-alert sirens blared.
"Warning!  Maximum safe temperature exceeded!  Total systems
failure imminent!" warned the computer.
	"Bridge to Engineering.  You better have some good
news!" yelled Riker into the intercom.
	"I need more time, Commander," pleaded Geordi.  "The
engines will be back on-line in three minutes.  You have 
shields now."
	"Not good enough, Geordi.  This ship can't hold
together for much longer.  Bridge out."  Riker slapped the
channel shut before Geordi could respond.
	Wesley turned quickly, an idea forming in his mind.
"Worf, what's the minimum safe distance for the Enterprise
to survive the detonation of a photon torpedo?"
	"Two kilometers.  Why?" growled the warrior, his bony
brow wrinkling in confusion.
	"Captain, I recommend that we fire a photon torpedo
and set it to detonate two kilometers in front of our predicted
position."
	"Ensign Crusher, what purpose would it ser--"  Picard's
expression changed as he saw where this was leading.  Turning 
to Lieutenant Aures at Ops, he said "Transfer all available 
power to forward shields."  As she moved to raise the shields,
Picard turned to Worf and ordered him to "Fire two photon
torpedos.  Set one to detonate two kilometers in front of
us and the other to detonate two seconds after, same position."
	All eyes on the Bridge turned to Picard, wondering 
what he could be planning.  The whoosh of escaping air
could be heard as the torpedos were launched.  As the first
one detonated, the blast forced the Enterprise's bow up so
that the lower hull was absorbing the friction of the
atmosphere.
	"Now, Ensign, transfer all power to lower shields!"
	No sooner had her hands stopped moving, than Aures
was thrown from here chair, as were most of the Bridge crew, 
by the second explosion.  The Enterprise was lifted up and
pushed back, out of the planets atmosphere.  It settled into
a high, loose orbit.  Seconds later, the warp nacelles lit
up red and blue.
	"Warp power is now available, Captain," reported
Wesley.
	"Resume course and speed," said Picard, and, tapping
his combadge, "Ensign Gawron to Sickbay, then meet me in my
Ready Room.  You have the Bridge, Number One."
	Picard left the Bridge through the portside doors
into his Ready Room.
	
	As Chris entered Sickbay, Pulaski rushed over.
"It's about time you got here.  Here, sit down," she said,
indicating a diagnostic bed.  "What happened to you, have a
disagreement with Worf?"
	"No, Q," replied Chris.  "I think I won."
	"I'm impressed.  Now lie down."
	Chris lay back slowly, trying not to aggravate his
injuries, especially those on his back.  The scanners in the
bed went to work automatically, displaying their results on
the wall panel beside the bed.
	"Life signs appear to be normal.  Just surface
injuries," diagnosed Pulaski.
	"You mean I'll live, Doc," inquired Chris, only half
jokingly.
	"I'm afraid so."
	Pulaski wheeled over a healing ray: a low power laser
used to graft synthiskin over wounds.  She set to work and 
after about twenty minutes, Chris looked, if not felt, as good
as new.  Except for the burns on his back.  For these, and as
a treatment for his cuts, Pulaski bathed him in a different
ray, one that would help to regenerate his skin.
	"Unfortunately, this will have the side effect of
making you tired and stiff.  I suggest you take it easy for
twenty-four to thirty-six hours.  Consider yourself relieved
of duty, Mister ..." she trailed off, not knowing his name.
	"Gawron.  Ensign Chris Gawron."
	"Pleased to meet you, Chris.  Anyone who can beat
Q is certainly a good person to know.  I'm Doctor Katherine
Pulaski," she said, reaching out to shake Chris' hand,
careful not to reopen any of his injuries.
	The door to Picard's Ready Room chimed.  He switched
off his desk terminal and said, "Come."
	The doors parted and Chris entered.
	"Tell me, Ensign, just what happened to you down
there?"
	Slowly, carefully, not wanting to omit any details,
Chris told Picard about his adventure.  When he finished,
Picard went over to the food dispenser in the corner and
ordered "Tea, Earl Grey, Hot."  As he returned to his chair,
sipping his tea thoughtfully, he said, "Most impressive.
You exhibit tremendous stamina and resilience."
	"I can't really take all the credit for it myself,
sir.  I owe part of it to an old friend," Gawron admitted.
	"He trained you?"
	"No," Chris laughed.  "Putting up with him over the
years convinced me I could do anything.  He was a little hard
to take for an extended period of time.  Had a terrible sense
of humor, too."
	"You mean he took everything seriously?" asked Picard.
	"Just the opposite.  There was nothing that he took
seriously.  Nothing except his friends," he said wistfully.
	"What happened to him?  He sounds like an interesting
personality," said Picard, curiously.
	"Had the wrong psych profile for Starfleet.  He had
what some people call 'spontaneous genius;' brief, unexplained,
unpredictable flashes of brilliance.  Jumped to too many 
conclusions, too many times.  Even though he was right the
majority of the time, he was considered too much of a risk
for Starfleet Sciences.  Wouldn't have lasted long, anyway.
He had no use for authority of any kind," finished Chris.
	"I know the type.  As much as I'd like to continue
reminiscing with you, we have a mission to complete.  You,
however, are confined to the civilian areas of the Enterprise
until Doctor Pulaski or myself tell you otherwise," said
Picard, in a tone heavy with tension, but with relief evident.
	"I see no problem with those orders," replied Gawron.
	"Glad to hear it.  Dismissed."
	Chris exited, followed by Picard.  As Chris walked
toward the Turbolift, Riker turned and said sternly, "Ensign,
is that uniform regulation?"
	Chris stopped and looked down at the sorry state of 
what used to be his uniform.  His shirt was gone and not much
was left of his pants.  His boots were ripped and scorched.
"I think it used to be.  I wonder if this look will catch on."
Almost as an after thought, Chris added, "Sorry, sir.  I didn't
have time to change."
	"That's alright," said Riker, breaking into a wide
grin.  "I just hope it doesn't catch on.  Carry on, Ensign."
	The Turbolift doors closed with a soft his behind
Chris as he sped away from the Bridge.
	Picard took over the command chair from Commander
Riker.
	"Status, Number One."
	"Still orbiting the planet, Captain.  Sensors 
register nothing down there.  No city, no lifesigns at all,"
reported Riker.
	"Strange.  From what I understand of Ensign Gawron's
story, there was a good-sized village and an extensive series
of tunnels on the planet, as well as at least one species of 
large water lizard and a carnivorous plant.  I can see Q's
hand in this.  I wish he'd stay in the Continuum or do 
something useful, rather than continually bothering us."
	Riker turned to look at Picard, eyes bright.
"I know you won't believe this, but after being part of the
Q for a few hours, I think I understand him.  At least a 
little.  Being omnipotent there's not much that challenges
him.  Humans do because we are stubborn."
	"I agree, Captain," said Counselor Troi.  "He sees us
as both superior and inferior at the same time.  He envies us
our mortality and our ability to love others.  Because of the 
Q's immortality and their power, they must always be careful.
We have no such responsibility."
	"Captain, if I may remind you, we have a mission to
perform," reminded Worf from above.
	"Yes, quite right, Lieutenant.  Mister Crusher, 
compute and execute a new course to the Vexis Corinhi system."
	"Aye, Captain," acknowledged the Ensign.  "Course 
computed and laid in."
	"Warp 5, engage."
	"Warp 5, sir," replied Wes.
	"Mister Data, ETA to the Corinhi system."
	"Three hours, barring any further interruptions,"
answered the android.
	"Counselor, how are the crew faring?" asked the 
Captain.
	"For a time they were nervous, but now that the 
Enterprise is no longer in immediate danger, they are again
confident in our ability to succeed," reported the Betazoid.
	"I hope so, Deanna.  But where Q is involved, we're
always in immediate danger," said Riker somberly.
	"I sincerely hope that you're wrong this time,
Number One," said Picard grimly.  "I don't care about Q's
assurances.  Neither the crew nor the ship can take much 
more."
	"I agree, Captain.  Mister Data, dig up any 
information you can on the Vexis Corinhi system.  We might 
as well know as much as possible about our destination,"
ordered Riker.
	"Accessing, Commander."  Data cocked his head slightly
to one side as he searched his internal memory banks for the 
requested information.
	"The Vexis Corinhi system contains fourteen planets
orbiting a G class star.  The fourth and fifth planets are
marginally class M.  The inner three planets revolve around 
the sun in very tight orbits and are little more than molten
lava.  The sixth through ninth planets are solid, but 
inhospitable by human standards.  They are home to perpetual
geothermal and electrical disturbances.  The remaining planets
are lifeless pieces of rock, barely large enough to be 
classified as planets.  At this time, the Klingons have
peripherally scanned the system but have not explored it or
established any outposts.  In our time period, the fourth
planet is known as --" Data stopped, unsure of whether to
continue.
	"What is it, Data?  What do we call it in our time?"
demanded Picard.
	"In our time period," continued Data, after a 
worried glance at Worf, "the fourth planet is known as
Khitomer."
	Worf looked up, startled.  "Khitomer," he said 
under his breath, and more loudly, "My family!  Captain, we
must warn the Klingon high command of the attack on Khitomer."
	"You know we can't, Worf.  If we were to change 
everything that we think went wrong with history, we may 
not continue to exist.  I can sympathize with you, though.
With our knowledge we could prevent the destruction of the
original Enterprise and the death of Tasha Yar, but we can't."
Picard turned back to Data, obviously saddened at his 
inability to change things for the better.  "Where will we
most likely find these creatures?"
	"If the creatures we are looking for energy to absorb
as a nutrient, the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth planets
would be the logical choice," answered Data.
	"Ensign Crusher, when we enter the Corinhi system,
plot a course for the sixth planet at one-half impulse power."
	"Worf, a want a full sensor sweep of the area.  Check
for any potential surprises," ordered Picard.       
	As Wesley started his computations, Worf protested,
"Captain, if Commander Data is correct, we will be unable to
scan the planets because of the prescence of so much energy.
I recommend a shuttlecraft survey of each planet."
	"Make it so, Lieutenant.  When we enter orbit around
Vexis Corinhi VI, take ten shuttles and perform a routine 
search.  Once you find something, return to the Enterprise
and we'll take it from there," said Picard.
	"Aye, sir.  I will select ten shuttle crews and make 
the necessary preparations," said the Klingon.  As he moved 
to the Turbolift his replacement moved to take his place.
	"Good luck, Worf."
	"Thank you, Commander Riker, but Klingons do not
believe in luck."
        The Turbolift doors closed and he was gone.
		CHAPTER 9
	Chris entered the gym looking for something to do.
Looking around, he saw a volleyball game in progress.  In 
other areas, people were lifting weights, jogging, and doing
exercizes, but most of the people there were gathered near
the volleyball court.  Many because they were unfamiliar with
the game, not being native to Earth.  Others because their 
friends were playing.  Still others stood there because they 
had nothing better to do.  Among the crowd, Chris recognized
many familiar faces.  
	As he entered, they elbowed their way out of the 
crowd to surround him.  They all began talking at once,
asking him what had happened.
	Chris chose not to answer until they had all quieted
down.  J'ff, a Tellarite male, bellowed happily, "I'm glad 
you're back, you rotten space scum."  Insults were the way
Tellarites expressed friendship.
	"I'm glad, too, J'ff, you mangy hairball," Chris
tried feebly.  He didn't sound it.
	"You should be happy.  Chris, you're a hero!" said
someone from the back of the crowd.
	"No, I'm not.  I just did what anyone else would have
done in the same situation," he protested.
	"Sure, anyone else would have done it, but you're the
one who actually DID it.  You saved the ship and everyone 
owes you a debt of gratitude," J'ff said, trying to convince
him.
	"Captain Picard already thanked me and Doctor Pulaski
says she respects me for outwitting Q.  That's way more than I 
needed or expected."
	"Well, we're proud of you, if it means anything,"
snorted J'ff, de facto spokesman for the group.
	"That's all I wanted to hear.  See, I'm happy now."
True, Chris' mood had brightened alot since he first entered
the Rec deck.
	Together, they walked over to the volleyball court.
The game had broken up by now, but several people were
playfully hitting the ball back and forth over the net.
Chris and J'ff joined in, the others preferring to watch.
Soon, ten people were on the court.  A game was soon 
organized.  Chris' team consisted of himself, J'ff, Sonya
Gomez from Engineering, the Andorian Theltok, and Mark
Bentley, a Rec deck attendent.  Their opponents were Bill
and Ted Kelso, the twin maintenance cadets, Ray Smith, a
civilian student, and Steve Bennett and Larry Howard,
computer technicians.  Despite a valiant effort, one which
left Chris in serious doubt about his decision to play, his
team lost 19 - 17.  The teams shook hands and left the court
to let others use it.  Chris headed off for 10-Forward for 
dinner.
	"Mister Data, what is our current ETA?" asked Picard.
	"1.75 hours, sir."
	"Mister Worf, status."
	Worf had returned from making the preparations for
his shuttle mission.  "All ship's systems are functioning at
normal levels.  Sensors detect no ships in our vicinity,"
replied the Klingon.
	"I have serious doubts about my perception of normalcy,
Mister Worf.  Keep me informed of any changes," ordered Picard.
	On the screen, three ships shimmered into existence
and solidified.  Their green hulls and stylized markings were
unmistakable.
	"Captain, three Klingon battlecruisers have just 
decloaked and are powering up their disruptors and photon
torpedoes!  Point blank range," shouted Worf.
	"I think we can all see that, Worf," snapped Picard.
"Red alert.  Shields up, Data.  Worf, ready phasers and load
torpedo bays.  Wait for my order to fire."
	"Shields up, Captain."
	On the screen, a sparkling ball of red fire erupted
from the nose of each battlecruiser and sped toward the 
Enterprise.  The ship rocked with each hit.
	"Shields holding at 54% efficiency.  Minor hull
damage.  Shields rebuilding," reported Data.
	"Worf, fire phasers at their engine pods.  Disable
them," ordered Picard..
	Worf hesitated for a moment, then stepped back from
his station.  He stood looking straight ahead.  "I cannot,
sir."
	"Lieutenant, I gave you a direct order," said Picard
dangerously.
	"Captain, these are my people.  I will not fire on 
them," Worf said defiantly.
	On the screen, sizzling disruptor beams lanced out 
at the Enterprise.  Again the ship shook.  "Shields down to
14%," reported Data.
	"Mister Worf, fire those phasers or get off my Bridge!"
	"I am sorry, sir.  But I will not fire."
	"Mister Worf, you are relieved from duty.  Report
to the brig.  I'm sure you know the way."
	"Yes, Captain," said Worf sullenly as he left the
Bridge.  Riker jumped over the railing part way up the aft
ramp and took Worf's position at Tactical.  He immediately
fired tight beam blasts at their attackers.  The Klingons'
engine pods burst open amid the flash of vaporized metal,
leaving behind the sparking arcs of fused electrical circuits.
	"The Klingons have been disabled, sir.  I read their
power levels at 11% nominal.  They have only life support
and limited subspace communications range," reported Data.
	"Thank you, Mister Data," said Picard.  "Damage
report."
	"Minimal damage to forward saucer decks.  Shields at
38% and holding.  Engineering crews are at work trying to
increase power to the shields," stated Riker, reading the 
information off of Worf's console.
	"Open hailing fre--"  Picard was cut off as the 
ship rocked as a blinding light emanated from the viewscreen.
The Enterprise pitched back and forth under the force of the 
colliding debris left from the exploding Klingon ships.
	"They must have done that deliberately.  In order to
prevent us from capturing them," thought Riker out loud.
	"Perhaps they hoped to destroy us in the process,"
hypothesized Data.  "They did succeed in rendering us
defenseless.  Our shields are down."
	"You are both correct.  I sensed great fear and
hatred from those three ships.  They were afraid of us and
of what we might do to them should they be captured," spoke
up Troi.
	"The Klingons used anti-Federation propaganda to 
make their people fear and loathe humans.  The Federation
was made out to be a group of bloodthirsty monsters set on
galactic domination.  In addition, they were trained to kill 
themselves, rather than be taken alive," informed Data.
	"That's all very well, Data, but we still have a 
mission to perform.  I have a feeling that the Federation's 
time is running out, if the information you gave me was 
correct, Number One," said Picard.
	"It was as correct as anything concerning Q can be,
sir.  But the fact that Q can travel through time makes me 
nervous.  He could pop up at any time," worried Riker.
	"It's something we'll have to live with, Number One.
Mister Crusher, resume course and speed to Vexis Corihni VI,"
ordered Picard wearily, tired of having to repeat himself,
tired of the interruptions, and, most of all, tired of Q.
	"Aye, sir.  Warp 5 to Vexis Corihni VI," answered
Wesley.
	After an hour and forty-five minutes had passed,
Wes reported, "Slowing to one-half impulse power."
	"Full range sensor sweep initiated," said Ensign
Ferrar from Tactical.  "No sign of anything out of the 
ordinary."
	"Commander Data, launch a Class-1 probe to Vexis
Corihni VI.  Full instrumentation.  I want as much information
as is humanly possible to get," said Picard.
	"But, Captain, regrettably, I am not hu--"  One look
at Picard silenced the android before he could finish his
lament: "human."  "Probe launched, sir," he reported instead.
	"Ensign Ferrar, anything registering on your scans?"
asked Riker.
	"Nothing, sir.  As far as I can tell, everything is 
as it should be," replied the tall Andorian in the sibilant
whisper peculiar to his race.
	"Mister Crusher, assume a standard orbit.  Commander
Riker, get a survey team together and use a shuttlecraft to 
search the planet for these creatures," said Picard.  "Just
locate them, nothing else."
	"Aye, sir.  Data, come with me."  Tapping his combadge,
Riker said, "Lieutenants LaForge, Rubino, and Aures, report 
to Shuttlebay 1 for a reconnaisance mission.  Riker out."
	Riker and Data left the Bridge together, planning the 
mission.  As they left, Ensign Harris arrived on the Bridge
and slid into Data's chair, swinging the control panel into
position in front of her.  After a few seconds, she reported 
to Picard.  "Information from the probe, sir:  Surface 
temperature sixty degrees Centigrade, wind speed ninety
kilometers per hour, visibility five feet.  The planet is 
just like Earth in it's early history.  Numerous volcanic
eruptions, seas of boiling mud, no lifesigns, emmense
electromagnetic storms."
	"Thank you, Ensign," acknowledged Picard.  "Maybe 
Commander Riker can find some of these non-existent creatures,"
he said to himself thoughtfully.
	In Shuttle Bay 1, Riker's survey team was gathering.
Data, of course, had come with Riker.  Lieutenant LaForge was 
waiting for them when they arrived, followed soon by Rubino 
and Aures.
	"I assume you all know what you're here for," stated
Riker.  When no one said anything, he said, "Good, let's get
started."
	As the five officers approached shuttlecraft 3, DaVinci,
Lieutenant Phyllis Rubino, her black hair brushing the shoulders 
of her science uniform, asked, "Commander, if the sensor readings
are correct, won't the electrical storms interfere with 
communications?"
	Riker looked at Data, signalling him to reply.  "Yes,
Lieutenant, you are partially correct.  We will not be able to
contact the Enterprise, but they will be able to contact us. 
The ship's communications equipment is much more powerful than
any of our shuttlecrafts'."
	"In addition, we'll have to watch out for those volcanoes.
Molten rock is shot nearly to the outer edge of the atmosphere
and then falls back, superheating in the process," added Jill 
Aures.  The geophysicist was short by human standards.  She had
a full head of jet black hair and a slim figure.
	"How dangerous are they to the shuttlecraft?" asked
Riker.
	"On the way up, they could blast a hole through the 
hull.  On the way down, they're hot enough to melt through
the exterior plates of the Enterprise like a laser through 
butter.  The small ones will only shake us up a bit.  I don't
even want to think about what the large one's could do!"
answered Geordi worriedly.
	"See that we don't find out, Geordi," said Riker.
"You'll be our pilot, as well as using your VISOR to analyze
the planet's atmosphere.  Data will assist you.  Rubino, 
you're our xenobiologist.  You'll be in charge of getting as
much information as possible about these creatures, as well 
as trying to classify them.  Aures, this is our big chance 
to study a planet in its infancy.  See that we don't miss 
anything important."
	With that they boarded the DaVinci, Riker in the lead,
and completed the pre-flight checks.  Riker signaled the Bridge,
"Shuttle 3 ready for departure."
	Picard's voice came back "Acknowledged.  Bon voyage,
Number One."
	"Thank you, sir.  DaVinci out.  Okay, Geordi, let's
go."
	"Aye, Commander."  LaForge's hands moved over the
control panel with grace and precision.  The shuttle slowly
slid forward, picking up speed as the doors to Shuttle Bay 3
parted and the warning signal sounded.  The DaVinci flew out
of the neck of the Enterprise, between its hulking warp
nacelles.  As the DaVinci passed, their blue light briefly
illuminated the cockpit, glinting off Geordi's VISOR as they
dipped down toward the planet's surface.
	"Hang on, folks.  Things get bumpy from here on in,"
warned Geordi.  It proved to be something of an understatement,
as the shuttlecraft lurched violently from side to side.
"I'll try to find a more moderate climate," shouted Geordi 
through clenched teeth.
	All around them rocks leapt and fell.  Sending off 
sparks and trailing by streaks of flame, the were almost as
bright as the lightning that burst everywhere, arcing across
the dark sky.
	To Geordi, it appeared beautiful.  He could see the 
magnetic fields and thermal radiation of everything 
surrounding the shuttle.  It took all his effort to take in
the sights around him while fighting to keep the shuttle airborn.
Finally, after many tense minutes, the buffeting died down to a
mild rocking.
	"Good work, Lieutenant.  Everyone alright back here?"
Riker turned to look at Rubino and Aures.  Both were nearly as 
pale as Data, but nodded to indicate that they felt up to the
task at hand.
	Geordi pilotted the shuttle as Data, Rubino, and Aures
went about their tasks.  After awhile, Riker took over the 
controls from LaForge, so that he could join in the analysis.
	Suddenly, Rubino looked up.  "Commander, I think I've
got something.  Come around to course 103 mark 330."
	The shuttle turned as it made the 30 degree dive below
the horizontal.  A flash of lightning pierced the roiling clouds
around them, allowing them to see the creature for the first time.
	"It resembles as Earth sea creature known as a jellyfish.
Its tentacles absorb energy and channel it to the sac on top 
where it is converted into some form of nutrients," reported
Rubino.
	"I don't know if you can see this, but there's more
to that thing than just tentacles and a body/bag," cautioned
LaForge.
	"What do you see, Geordi?" asked Data.
	"It looks like...I don't know exactly what it looks
like.  It keeps changing shape and shifting up and down 
through the entire electromagnetic spectrum.  Everything except 
visible light."
	The creature drifted towards the DaVinci, as if 
curious about the strange intruder into its world.  A
tentacle snaked out in the direction of the shuttle.  As it
made contact with the DaVinci's outer skin, a brilliant flare
of lightning struck the port engine nacelle.  A blinding 
flash lit up the inside of the shuttle, and the creature
recoiled and fled in pain.  Inside alarms sounded and consoles
sparked and sputtered.  Everyone except Geordi and Data had 
their hands tightly clasped over their eyes, moaning in pain.
	"Can anyone see?" Riker managed to gasp, voice weak 
with pain.
	"I can, Commander," answered Geordi.  "My VISOR
protected me from the flare."
	"What about you, Data?"
	"Regrettably, my optic sensors were damaged in much
the same way as yours.  My vision will return eventually, due
to my self-repair functions, sir."
	"Geordi, can you get us back to the ship?"
	"I'll try, Commander.  The port nacelle took quite
a hit.  No guarantees," answered the Chief Engineer, with 
unaccostomed pessimism.  The old saying about the blind
leading the blind crossed his mind, but he didn't speak it.
	Slowly, ponderously, the shuttle spun on its 
horizontal axis.  It limped in the general direction of space, 
struggling to gain altitude and at the same time avoid the
omnipresent showers and fountains of molten rock.  Just as 
it seemed they were safe, a rock the size of a man's fist
rocketed upwards, through the port nacelle, sending the 
shuttle into a violent end over end tumble.  As Geordi's
hands moved rapidly over his control board, trying to 
reestablish control of the shuttle, Aures screamed in alarm
as her station exploded in a shower of sparks and plastic 
shrapnel.  Rubino and Riker felt their way over to her.
Aures was unconcious and Rubino's hands encountered a warm,
sticky wetness wherever she touched Aures.  Still unable to
see, Riker felt his way down Aures' arm until he found her
wrist.  He desperately felt for a pulse.  It was there, though
barely perceptible.  Her breathing was so shallow as to be 
nearly unnoticeable.
	"LaForge!" Riker shouted through the acrid smoke that
was rapidly filling the cabin.  "Get us back to the ship now!
Aures is dying!"
	"I'm trying, sir, but we only have one functioning
engine and everything that's not destroyed is barely 
functional."
	"Are the shields still up?" asked Data.
	"Shields 1, 2, and 4 are at 53%, 2 and 5 are down.
Shield 6, in the rear, is at 89%.  Why?"  A look of puzzlement
settled onto Geordi's face.
	"At what distance would an 89% effective deflector 
screen absorb and reflect the force of a small matter/anti-
matter explosion?" inquired the android.
	"That depends on the size of the explosion.  If we
detonate one of our engines..."  A look of understanding lit
up LaForge's face.  "Yes, Data!  Of course!  If we jettison 
our port nacelle and drop it's containment field, we can bounce
the force of the explosion off our aft deflector and launch 
ourselves out of here.  Brilliant!"
	Geordi set to work on the necessary calculations and
then told Data, "If we channel all power to the aft deflector,
we can survive the nacelle's explosion at a range of 3.738 
kilometers.  If it hits us squarely, that is."
	"What happens if we're too close or it doesn't hit 
us squarely?" Rubino asked anxiously.
	"You remember the story of Icarus?"
	"Yes, he flew too close to the sun and his wings of
wax melted.  He --" she broke off dejectedly, face paling.
	"He fell to Earth.  That's us if this doesn't work,"
finished Geordi.  "I've programmed the computer to drop the 
nacelle's containment field at .4 kilometers just in case.
Before we get started, anyone who doesn't want to do this, I
suggest you get off now."  No one moved or spoke.  "Here
goes.  Ejecting port-side engine nacelle."  The shuttlecraft's
tumble shifted slightly as its weight became uneven.  Geordi
channeled all power except minimal life support to the aft
shield.  Aures was strapped into a chair by Riker and Rubino
before they belted themselves in.  Geordi made sure both he
and Data were buckled in as he read off the nacelle's distance
from the drifting shuttle.  "100 meters, 200 meters, 300
meters, 350 meters, 390 meters, brace yourselves!  Four hun--"
His words were knocked out of him by the force of the 
explosion.  Everyone was pressed back into their seats as they
accelerated.  The last thing Geordi remembered seeing before 
he passed out was the Enterprise shining in the sky.  Then
darkness closed in.
	"Captain!" shouted Maggie Harris.  "Sensors detect
something approaching at Warp 1.2.  It's Commander Riker's
shuttle and its heading straight for the lower surface of
our saucer."
	Chapter 10
	"What the hell!  They can't go that fast.  Their
shuttle was designed for impulse speeds only," pondered
Picard.  "Ensign Ferrar, lock on tractor beam.  Grab them 
before they put a hole in my ship!"
	"Tractor beam locked on, sir.  The shuttle is 
slowing down," answered Ferrar.  "It's being pushed toward
the outer edge of the saucer."
	"Speed down to Warp 1 and decreasing," reported 
Harris.
	"They're too close," warned Wesley.
	"A few more seconds and they'll be clear of the
saucer, Captain," said Ferrar.
	"I hope so, Ensign.  Open hailing frequencies to
the shuttle," ordered Picard.
	"Frequencies open."
	"Picard to shuttle.  What the hell is going on,
Commander Riker?"  A pause.  "Riker, are you there?  Will,
answer me!"  No response.
	"Ensign Harris, life readings on the shuttle."
	"I read four humans, one android.  The humans are
all unconcious," she answered.
	"Speed and range of the shuttlecraft," asked Picard.
	".05 impulse and closing from 500 meters," answered
Wesley.
	"Sir, the shuttle has passed out of tractor beam range.
The lower engineering hull is in the way," reported Ferrar 
anxiously.
	A slight jarring rang through the hull.  A red alert
sounded as the computer calmly reported "Warning.  Hull breach
on level 14.  Loss of atmosphere.  Isolating effected areas."
At one of the rear science stations, a diagram of the Enterprise
appeared, the damaged areas flashing a brilliant orange.
	Picard tapped his combadge.  "Damage control and 
repair teams to deck 14.  Chief O'Brien, beam all five shuttle
occupants directly to Sickbay.  Doctor Pulaski, prepare for 
incoming wounded."
	In Sickbay, five shapes sparkled and materialized
into Riker, Rubino, Data, LaForge, and Aures.  Pulaski and
her staff went to work immediately.
	
	"Damage report, Mister Ferrar," said Picard.
	"Five compartments were opened to space, as well as
many bulkheads being damaged.  There were no casualties."
	"Begin repairs immediately.  Picard to Sickbay.
Doctor Pulaski, what is the condition of the survey team?"
	"Everyone is suffering from mild exposure to space.
Commanders Riker and Data and Lieutenant Rubino are suffering
from temporary blindness.  Lieutenant Aures caught the brunt of
an exploding console.  She seems to have shielded the others 
from the blast.  She's lost a lot of blood and is chock full
of plastic shards, but has a good chance of pulling through."
	"May I speak to Data, please, Doctor?"
	"Of course, Captain," Pulaski acquiesced.
	"Data here, sir.  What do you require?"
	"Please tell me what happened down there," said
Picard.
	Data related their experiences in a condensed form.
When he had finished, Picard asked, "How long until you'll
be fully functional?"
	"My optical sensors are currently functioning at 38%
efficiency.  I estimate one hour until I can safely return to
duty."
	"While you're waiting, formulate a plan to capture
one of these creatures with the tractor beam, keeping in mind
the interference generated by the planet's atmosphere," said
Picard.
	"Yes, sir.  Data out."  The channel to Sickbay closed.
	"Captain, sensors register a large object rising 
towards us from the planet," reported Ferrar.
	"Shields up.  Ensign Harris, analysis."
	"The entity is unscannable, sir.  It absorbs any
sensor beams directed at it.  Range ten kilometers and closing,"
she said.
	"Ensign Ferrar, lock on with a tractor beam as soon as
the creature comes into range," ordered Picard.
	"Tractor lock established."
	"Sir, we're being pulled toward the creature and
power to the tractor beam has increased," reported Wesley.
	"It's eating the tractor beam; forcing it to use
more power," said Picard in wonder.  Then, remembering the 
situation, he ordered "Disengage tractor beam."
	"Sir, I sense intense curiosity and great longing,"
spoke up Troi.
	"It's probably never encountered a starship before,
and certainly nothing as powerful as the Enterprise," said
Picard. 
	"To a creature such as this, we represent a pure food
source.  It must sense our great power and see it as a constant
supply of nutrients," Troi analyzed.
	"No one treats me as lunch if I can help it," stated
Picard emphatically.  "Mister Data, I trust you've been 
monitoring our situation on the Bridge."
	"Affirmative, Captain, but I require additional 
information in order to complete my plan."
	"You'll certainly get your additional data, 
Commander.  I intend to use all our resources against this 
thing to ensure we survive this misson.  Picard out."
	"Power drain on the forward shields," reported Harris.
"Down eight percent."
	"Picard to Engineering."
	"Gomez here," came back Lieutenant Sonya Gomez's
husky voice.
	"We have a power drain on the forward shields.  An
alien being is siphoning off our power.  Is there anything
you can do down there to limit the power drain?"
	"Nothing I can suggest offhand, other than shutting
everything down, sir.  If there's no power, that creature 
won't have anything to absorb," she answered.
	"Captain, if we shut down everything except 10-Forward,
the creature would be drawn to that," suggested Wesley.
	"Your point, Ensign," prompted Picard irritably.
Annoyed that things were not going as planned.
	"If we then brought up shields and hit it with phasers,
photon torpedos, sensor scans, and the tractor beam maybe we
could knock it out, or at least keep it from stealing any more
of our power."
	"Like when a human overeats," came Gomez's voice from 
the Bridge speaker.
	"Make it so," said Picard.
	"Aye, Captain.  Blocking power feeds to all ship areas
except 10-Forward," reported Gomez.
	The Bridge stations' consoles went dark one by one.
Finally, the viewscreen faded to black and the Bridge lights 
went out, only to be replaced after a brief delay by the red
emergency lights.
	In Sickbay, Pulaski looked around franticly as Aures'
life monitors winked out.  The hum of the stasis field which
had been surrounding her open chest cavity faded and disappeared.
As she was enveloped in near darkness, Pulaski tapped her 
combadge.  "Pulaski to Bridge.  What's going on up there?"
	Picard answered her call and told her what was 
happening.
 	"I don't care, Captain!  I need power down here.  Aures
has massive internal injuries that require immediate attention."
	"I sympathize with you, Doctor, but I must weigh the 
safety of the entire ship against the life of one woman.  
Power will be restored momentarily.  Bridge out."
	'Damn that man,' she thought to herself, 'I'm just
trying to do my job.'
	While this was happening, the Sickbay staff had been 
scrambling around Aures' diagnostic bed under the direction 
of the Vulcan doctor, Selar.  They set up portable stasis 
field generators and were running medical scanners up and down
the comatose geophysicist.  As the stasis field came back up 
the medical scanners began to report life readings.  They were 
dangerously low, even nearer death than before.
	Pulaski came back to the bed.  She didn't like what
she saw.  "Okay, Selar, prepare to operate.  We'll need 
to replace her heart and probably her lungs as well.  We
haven't got time to match the replacements to her physiology
so we'll use full prosthetics."
	The Vulcan turned to her with a subdued look of 
alarm.  "Doctor, is that wise under these conditions?"
	"I don't like these conditions any better than you,
but we don't have much choice.  Aures has the same chances of
dying, one way or the other.  Let's get to work."
	On the Bridge, things were going according to plan.
Since the viewscreen was unpowered, Wesley had gone down to
10-Forward to report the range of the creature.  Data, his
vision nearly returned to normal,  was sitting in Riker's
chair.  As none of the Bridge stations worked now, everyone
was sitting back, tensely listening to Wesley's periodic 
reports.  "The creature's just coming into range now."
	"Ensign Ferrar, fire phasers, photon torpedos, and
lock on with a tractor beam.  Ensign Harris, full sensor 
scan of the creature.  Raise shields."
	As Picard finished speaking, blue power lanced out 
from the Enterprise as the phasers hit and a tractor lock 
was established.  The whoosh of photon torpedos leaving their 
tubes could be heard on the Bridge.  When Ferrar had fired
all available torpedos, he restored power to the viewscreen
so that the Bridge crew could see what was transpiring.
White light washed over the faces of the Bridge crew as the
photon torpedos detonated, causing them to look ghostly in the
subdued light.
	After several additional phaser beam followed the 
initial volley, the creature began to expand.  It's glow
increased to a painful incandescence, accompanied by a high
pitched whining that forced itself over the Bridge speakers.
	"Shut that off, Ensign!" shouted Picard as the entire
Bridge crew, excluding Data, covered their ears.
	"I can't, sir.  This isn't coming over subspace 
radio or any intraship channels.  This is a real-time 
transmission from the alien."
	On the screen, the alien had stopped expanding and
its tentacles were slowly being drawn against its underside.
It was no longer moving, just drifting under its former
momentum.
	"Troi, can you sense anything from it?  Is it dead?"
asked Picard.
	"No, not dead.  It appears to have gone into 
hibernation.  It will remain in this state until threatened
or it burns off all the energy it has just consumed," she
replied. 
	"Picard to Engineering.  Who's in charge down there?"
	"Scott here, Captain.  How did yer plan work?" came
back the heavily accented voice.
	"All went as planned.  You can return power to the
rest of the ship,"  replied Picard.  "And Scotty, I'm glad
you're our Chief Engineer.  Otherwise, we might not have made
it."
	"Och, 'twas nothing, sir.  Just doin' me job.  Scott
out."  
	The channel to Engineering closed.
	Chapter 11
	The cubic ship floated through space, slowly
rotating.  The damage had been repaired and the light
at its center pulsed blue-green.  Having no other purpose,
it had continued on its course even after the inferior 
ship had vanished.  Trying to catch it, perhaps.  Even 
the cubic ships occupants didn't know for sure.  Connected
together via subspace net as they were, they were presently
trying to figure out how a ship of inferior design crewed
by an inferior species could suddenly exceed all measure
of velocities.  It had certainly gone faster than its 
engines were designed for.
	The current thread of contemplation across the 
subspace net was why the ship had allowed itself to be 
damaged, almost destroyed before escaping.  Was it to 
analyze the cubic ships capabilities, or was this species so
superior that they can afford to play games with their lives.
	"Energy reading on course 115.54,320.41," echoed 
across the interior of the ship.  After a due nanosecond of
consideration, the ship changed course.  
	"Reading similar to last scan of Enterprise Warp
envelope," came the eerie mechanical voice.  
	As a red, gridlike forcefield surrounded the cube,
a face appeared on the screen.  "I can take you to the 
Federation starship Enterprise," said the face without
preamble.  "I was responsible for bringing them here in
the first place.  Allow me to help you and I'll take you
to a place where there are many lifeforms you can convert
as well as technology you can absorb."
	"Identify yourself," they echoed in unison, after
probing the forcefield for weakness and finding none.  Even
they could not escape.
	"I am from the Q Continuum.  To me, you are 
insignificant.  You cannot escape.  Follow me or be 
destroyed."
	Never having been faced with their destruction 
before, the semi-organic beings on the cube echoed back
"We accept your offer, you of the Q Continuum."
	"Not you, Q.  Oh well, never mind.  Prepare for 
time travel."  Q was gone, followed moments later by the
disappearance of the cube.
	
	The Borg were again hunting the Enterprise.
	"Geordi, are you alright?"
	At the sound of the strange, but familiar voice
Geordi opened his eyes.  Still unable to see, he felt to
both sides of himself for his VISOR.  
	"Here," said the voice again and Geordi could feel
someone press the VISOR into his left hand.  He put it on
and immediately wished he hadn't.  His head began to throb
even more painfully than it had been for the past several
seconds since waking.  After a great deal of concentration 
to tune out most of the extraneous information he turned to
who he assumed was a doctor.
	"Where am I and who are you?" he questioned shakily.
	"You're in Sickbay on the Enterprise, Lieutenant. 
I'm not surprised you're having trouble remembering.  The way
I hear it, you had a nasty fall out of a Jeffries tube.
Something about an explosion in Engineering..." broke off the
gruff voice as someone else, also familiar entered Sickbay.
	"How is he, Bones?  When will I get my Chief Engineer
back?"  asked the newcomer.
	"How the hell should I know?  I'm a Doctor, not a 
prophet!  Lietenant LaForge here took a nasty fall and hit 
his head.  He's having difficulty remembering."  Then, 
looking thoughtful for a moment and examining the readouts
on the diagnostic panel on the wall, "I'd say about 24 hours.
IF he can get some rest.  You know.  No performing minor 
miracles for a day, doctor's orders."
	"Good enough, Doctor."  And to Geordi, "I'll check 
in on you later, okay Geordi?"
	"Fine.  Maybe I'll remember something by then,"
LaForge said as he lay back on the diagnostic bed and closed
his eyes.
	Both Kirk and McCoy left him to rest and entered McCoy's
office.
	As the door closed behind them, Kirk asked anxiously, 
"What's really wrong with him, Bones?  A little fall like that
shouldn't have put him in Sickbay."
	"I don't know, Jim.  This just doesn't feel right.
I mean, ever since the two of us and Spock beamed aboard that
other ship, something has just been out of synch," answered
McCoy, taking a seat behind his desk.  He leaned back tiredly.
	"What do you mean: 'that other ship?'  We haven't 
been on another ship for at least two months.  I think you
need a break, Bones.  You've been working too hard," said 
Kirk with concern.
	"Touche, Jim?  That sounds awfully like what I tell
you all the time.  But I can't believe you don't remember 
the Houdini.  Your physical yesterday showed no mental
abberations, other than a death wish," McCoy responded
sarcastically.  "Are you sure you don't remember the Houdini?"
	"Positive, Bones.  Maybe you should talk to Spock,
see what he has to say."
	"Thanks, Jim, I'll do that,"  said McCoy as Kirk got
up to leave.  He called Spock on the Bridge, but he knew
nothing of any Houdini except for 'a minor conjuror of little
note from Earth's early 20th century.'
	McCoy began to doubt his own sanity when both the 
computer and Captain's Logs showed nothing of the Houdini.
In fact, all they listed were routine patrol missions along
the Federation-Klingon border.
	McCoy poured himself a large glass of Saurian 
brandy and vowed to find out what was going on.
	"Captain, who was that?"  Data had turned in his chair 
to stare inquiringly at Picard.
	"That was Chief Engineer Scott, Commander.  Who did
you think it was," answered the Captain.
	Data considered for a moment, his gaze seeming to turn 
inward as he searched his internal memory banks.  "I know of
no one calling themselves Scott who is also a Chief Engineer
currently serving in Starfleet.  I thought that Geordi
LaForge would be in Engineering, as he has always been."
	"Who?" asked Riker, entering the Bridge from the 
Turbolift.  "Computer...search records for any mention of a
'Geordi LaForge' serving on this ship at any time."
	The computer beeped in acknowledgement and after a
few seconds, its female voice answered: "No record of any
person by the name of 'Geordi LaForge' known to have served
on the Enterprise at any time."
	"Check for any reference to a 'Geordi LaForge' 
anywhere in the Enterprise memory banks," ordered Picard.
	Another pause, longer this time, as the computer
sifted through every piece of information in its possession,
working backwards from the most recent records.  "There is 
record of someone named 'Geordi LaForge.'  He served aboard
the original Enterprise, NCC-1701, from stardate 1510.3 to
stardate 8130.3 when it was destroyed.  He is listed as the
ship's Chief Engineer."
	"Thank you, Computer," acknowledged Picard.  "There,
you see Mister Data, I think that the stress of this situation
has been too much for you.  Some of your positronic pathways
may have been fused together so that you're confusing events
from this time with events from our time."
	"Impossible, sir.  My brain is protected from surges
of the magnitude required to cause the damage you suggest,"
responded the android calmly.
	"Still, at least report to Sickbay and have Doctor
Pulaski examine you," said Riker.
	"Aye, sir, but may I first stop in to see Worf in
the Brig?" inquired Data.
	"Of course, Data.  Just be sure you have yourself
checked out," said Picard.
	As Data left the Bridge, everyone left exchanged 
worried glances.  To think that someone with such strength,
such knowledge, had for all intents and purposes lost their
mind...The fact that Data was a construct made it no easier
to accept.
	
	As Data entered the Brig, he noticed that the force 
field covering the doorway to Worf's cell was not in place.
Yet Worf still sat in the cell.  He looked up upon Data's
entrance.
	"What happened, sir?" he grumbled.
	"We have captured one of the creatures, mostly 
through the good work of Chief Engineer Scott.  The Captain
is preparing to return to our own time with it," replied Data.
	"Who did you say?  What happened to Geordi?" asked
Worf.  Data could see his curiosity straining alongside his 
concern for his friend.
	"You mean you never heard of anyone named 'Scott'
serving aboard the Enterprise, either.  The Captain says
that no one named Geordi LaForge has ever served on this 
ship."
	"We must DO something.  Geordi may be in danger.
What does the computer say about Geordi?" queried the Klingon.
	"Computer records show a Geordi LaForge serving aboard
the original Enterprise in this time period.  It is my belief
that Q somehow caused Geordi and Scott to change places, 
modifying all computer records and people's memories.  I was
not affected for some reason.  You were not either.  Perhaps
it was Q's disdain for your race, or some peculiar physiological
trait of the Klingons."
	"It does not matter 'why.'  What we must do is 
recover Geordi and return Scott to his proper place," 
rumbled the warrior.
	"Do you have any plans for doing this, Lieutenant?"
asked the android.
	"If we separated the Stardrive section and followed
the other Enterprise, the saucer would have to follow us.
Perhaps, when everyone is back in their proper place, every
thing will return to normal," said Worf.
	"An interesting theory, but how could we get everyone
except Scott out of the Stardrive section long enough for us
to separate?"
	"Leave that to me," said the Klingon, coming as close
to smiling as he ever had.  "You secure the Battle Bridge.
I will signal you when I am ready to separate the saucer."
	"Agreed."  Worf and Data walked side-by-side to the 
Brig doors and then parted company, each going their own way.
	Data had gone to Sickbay, per the Captain's orders,
but Pulaski had been unable to find anything physically 
wrong with the android.  She reported her findings, such as
they were to the Captain.  Data had been on his way to the
Battle Bridge on Deck 8 when Picard paged him.
	
	"You are hereby removed from duty until some solution
to your problem presents itself" was all Picard had said.
Data wondered if whoever or whatever had changed everyone's
memories hadn't also put everyone's personalities ever so
slightly off-kilter as well.
	By now, Data had entered the Battle Bridge and set
about all possible preperations for saucer separation that
wouldn't be readily detected on the Main Bridge.  All he
had to do now was sit back and wait for Worf's signal.  Data
sat in the command chair, with a slightly less than straight
posture, his form of physical relaxation.
	Fortunately for Worf, it was near the middle of the
night shift when he entered Engineering.  He waited until
there was no one in sight, then he stealthily crept over to
the main engineering console.  He punched in his special
security codes in order to gain access to the collection
of disaster simulations that were normally used to train 
his security force on the Holodeck.  
	"Computer, run program 'Security8Alpha'," he whispered,
just loud enough for the computer's audio pickup to hear.
	"Proper clearance provided.  Running program
'Security8Alpha'," responded the computer, much too loudly
for Worf's liking.
	On the Bridge, Wesley turned anxiously to Picard 
as the Red Alert klaxons went off yet again.  "Captain, the
magnetic containment fields around the ship's matter/anti-
matter core have begun to dissipate.  Approximately 45 seconds
until uncontrolled matter/anti-matter collision."
	"Thank you, Ensign.  Picard to Engineering, is there
any chance of you getting the problem under control?"
	"Scott here, Cap'n.  There IS no problem...well,
at least no' a one I kin find, sir.  I recommend entering
Warp and separating the saucer.  That way, if she does blow,
most o' ye'll not be in any danger," reported the Chief
Engineer.
	"Prepare for emergency saucer separation.  All hands
to emergency stations," ordered Picard.  "Ensign, how long?"
	"Twenty seconds, Captain."
	"Warp 8, Ensign.  Any heading.  Engage!" shouted
Picard.
	Wesley hurriedly punched in a course that would take 
the Enterprise into deep space, away from any possibly 
inhabited planets.
	"Moving to course 90 mark 136.  Speed currently Warp
4 and increasing.  Fifteen seconds to detonation," said the 
Ensign, somehow finding enough self-control to remain calm.
	"Seperate saucer...NOW!" ordered Picard.
	On the Bridge viewscreen, the saucer appeared to lift
up and away as the larger, faster Stardrive section shot out
from under them.  Wesley counted down the time to detonation.
	"12 seconds...10...9...8...7...6...5 seconds...4...3
...2...1...detonation!"
	Everyone present covered their eyes in preparation
for the blinding flash they knew would soon follow.  It never 
did.
	"Captain, I don't understand," began Troi.
	"The Stardrive section never was in any danger,
fools."
	"Q, what do you have to do with this," asked Picard,
rather more loudly than he would have liked.
	"Tut, tut, Jean-Luc.  I had nothing to do with the
false alarm on the Stardrive section.  You owe that to 
Microbrain and the Incredible Toaster Man."  The voice 
came out of nowhere, Q not deigning himself to become solid.
	"Worf and Data?  Impossible," said Picard.  
"Computer, location of Lieutenant Worf and Commander Data."
	"Lieutenant Worf and Commander Data are not on the
saucer at this time.  Last known positions were in Main
Engineering and the Battle Bridge, respectively," answered
the feminine voice.
	"You see, Jean-Luc.  If I was one to say 'I told you
so'," he trailed off.
	"But you are, Q," muttered Riker, irritated with the 
whole situation.
	"Quite right, William.  Quite right.  So I'll say it.
I told you so.  There much, much better," said Q smugly.
	"Get out of here, Q.  Unless you're going to help us."
	"An ultimatum, Picard.  So unbecoming.  I'm not going
to help you.  Not yet, anyway.  There's nothing in it for me.
Bye now."
	Since Q was not visible, there was no indication that 
he had left, other than a slight whoosh of air and the sound 
like someone snapping there fingers.
	"Ensign," said Picard.  "Trail the saucer at maximum
impulse power.  I want to know what's going on."
	"But we'll never catch them," protested Wesley.
	"Just do it, Ensign!" Picard glowered at the boy.
	Meekly, Wesley obeyed.
	Worf entered the Battle Bridge, carrying an unconscious
Montgomery Scott over his shoulder.  Data looked up as he 
entered.
	"Were you successful, Lieutenant?" asked the android.
	"Yes.  People began evacuating the Stardrive section
as soon as I implemented my simulation.  Only Scott and a few 
others were present.  Everyone except us has been rendered 
unconscious by my phaser set on stun."
	"Good.  I have laid in a course that will parallel
that of the original Enterprise's back to Earth.  We should
catch up with them within the next forty-eight hours."
	On the saucer section, Pulaski was furious.  It seemed
that whenever she really needed the ship to hold steady so
that she could work on a patient, was the time that the Bridge
Crew decided to run the ship as rough as possible.  The power
drain, momentary though it was, when the ship separated, 
almost proved deadly to Aures.  The operation had been at a
critical stage when the ship separated and Pulaski had almost
lost her.  She wasted no time bringing this to the attention 
of the Bridge Crew.  Picard said, however, that if Aures was
still alive to stop worrying about it and get back to work.
This only made Pulaski madder.
	 She was now in the process of removing the stasis
field from Aures' body.  Most bodily functions had returned
to normal, the only major problem being the heart, which 
beat almost tentatively in her chest.  Pulaski's prognosis
was that she'd almost fully recover, if she ever regained 
consciousness.
	"Selar," she said, removing the last stasis field.
"Watch her.  I'm going up to the Bridge to find out exactly
what's going on.  I'll be back shortly."
	"Of course, Doctor," the Vulcan said to Pulaski's
back as the physician left Sickbay.  'Humans,' Selar thought 
to herself.  'Sometimes I don't understand their desire to 
become involved in thing they can't change.'  The Vulcan
continued on about her work, occasionally glancing up at
Aures' readouts.
	"Alright, Captain," said Pulaski, stepping out of 
the Turbolift onto the Bridge.  "What's so important that 
you feel you must constantly endanger the safety of my
patients?"
	It had taken her only a few seconds to realize that 
Picard was not at his customary place in the center of the 
Bridge activity, but that didn't stop her from asking the
question.
	"He's in the Ready Room.  He doesn't want to be
disturbed," answered Riker, turning in his seat to face her.
	"Well, that's too damn bad, because I'm going to
disturb him," Pulaski said resolutely as she headed for the
Ready Room door.
	The door chimed, but Picard just ignored it.  It
chimed a few more times, but he didn't look up, concentrating
on the information on his desk computer terminal.
	Finally, exasperated, Pulaski told the computer:
"Emergency medical overide.  Authorization: Pulaski-Alpha."
The door slid open immediately.
	"What the hell--," Picard started, but Pulaski cut 
him off.
	"Captain, what is going on up here?  I've got a lot
of injured people in Sickbay, three of them critical.  Why 
do you keep knocking the ship around, cutting power to
Sickbay, and otherwise trying to kill us?"
	"Please, Doctor.  This doesn't concern you," he 
answered.
	"Yes it does!  I'm the one who has to put everyone
back together again," Pulaski said.
	"Very well.  Data and Worf are missing.  They took
control of the Stardrive section after simulating a Warp 
core breech.  They took Scotty with them."
	"Who?" Pulaski asked.
	"Not you, too, Doctor," said Picard resignedly.
	"Data told me that he didn't know this Scotty, either.
At the time, it seemed that he was wrong.  Now, though, I have
no memory at all of this Scotty.  What happened to Geordi?"
	"I don't know what you're talking about, Doctor.
Data was ranting about this Geordi, also.  Give yourself a 
psych exam.  Compare your brainwave profile now with the one
on record.  Let's see if we can't get to the bottom of this."
Picard turned back to his terminal screen, signaling that 
this meeting was at an end.
	Pulaski left, her mood hardly having improved since
finding out the reason for the problems in Sickbay.
	On the rotating viewscreen, a white ship was just
becoming visible.  It was traveling at Warp 1.  Slowly, its
image increased in size.
	"Analysis of structure and registry indicate that 
this is the Enterprise," the mechanical voice echoed.
	"Error!  This ship is extremely primitive compared
to the Enterprise," another voice echoed back.
	"Confirm that this is the Enterprise," echoed yet
another voice.
	"Initiating individual Borg sub-processes," echoed
the first voice.
	Slowly, the Borg stepped from their cubicles, full
powered, with only one thought on their group mind.  The
capture of the Enterprise.
		CHAPTER 12
	"How long until we rendezvous with the Enterprise?"
rumbled Worf, from the chair beside Data.
	Data turned to him, looking away from the viewscreen
for the first time in what Worf judged to be hours.  "I
estimate, assuming they remained on their last known course 
and speed, that we will overtake them in 1.342 hours."  Data
turned back to the screen, assuming their conversation over.
	Worf merely grunted, thinking how easy it would be to
just draw his phaser and incapacitate the android.  The way 
would then be open to warn the Klingon Council of the attack
on Khitomer.  To do so would, of course, impugn his honor as
a warrior, but Worf felt it would nearly be worth it.  Instead
of drawing his phaser, Worf turned back to Data and asked,
"Is there any sign of the Saucer Section?"
	Data turned again from the Ops console and said,
"They began to pursue us as soon as they realized out 
deception.  Their progress is hampered by the fact that they
are towing the energy creature behind them.  We will have
sufficient time to rescue Geordi before they can catch up."
	Worf decided, rather than prolong the conversation,
to busy himself analyzing the warp engine traces left by the
Enterprise.  It was these miniscule bits of matter/antimatter
and microscopic dilithium shards that allowed them to be
reasonably certain of the Enterprise's path.  As long as these
short-lived clues were present, their lifetime measured in 
hours, they knew they were on the right track. 
	In the corner Scott, who had been feigning
unconsciousness for the last several minutes, began to stir.
He knew that his chances against an android and a Klingon 
were slim at best.  But if he could only activate a 
communications beam without their knowledge...
	Slowly, Scott moved toward the communications panel.
He took care not to make any sound whatsoever which might 
alert the android's sensitive hearing.  As he was about to 
press the Emergency Beacon control/cell on the comm board,
Data turned around.
	"Ah, I am glad to see that you are awake, Engineer.
You will be glad to know that you are being returned to your
rightful place on the correct Enterprise."
	"Ah'll be wontin' none o' that.  My rightful place 
is servin' Cap'n Picard.  I don' know if he approves o' this,
but I'll wager he doesn't.  Now turn this ship around or I'll
alert every vessel wi' in range and ye'll probably be kicked 
out o' Starfleet," said Scotty bravely.  He was trying to 
bluff the android, as he knew Riker could from their many 
poker/drinking sessions.  
	"You have no hold over us," said Worf, drawing his 
phaser and advancing on Scott.  He made sure that the 
Engineer saw him raise the setting on his phaser from light
stun, up through heavy stun, and finally to kill.  Knowing 
that such a situation was possible, but not expecting it,
Worf had nonetheless activate the Bridge safeguards that
would not allow a phaser blast greater than heavy stun.  He
hoped that Scott did not know this.
	Scott slowly backed away, toward the Turbolift.
"Worf, me friend.  What d'you mean, holdin' me at phaser
point?  Wha' have I done to deserve treatment like this from
me two closest friends in th' universe?"
	By this time, Scotty was on the threshold of the 
Turbolift.  He dove inside before the doors had completely 
opened and shouted "Emergency close!"  The doors obediently
snapped shut.  "Main Engineering, please, and hurry!"
	"All Turbolifts move at a constant speed" was all
the Turbolift said by way of reply as it started its journey
through the great starship.
	Back on the Battle Bridge, Worf was trying to open 
the doors to the Turbolift shift, without much success.  Data
motioned him out of the way and easily slid the doors apart.
Worf rushed forward, expecting a Turbolift car to be waiting.
	"Worf!" Data exclaimed as he grabbed the Klingons thick
gold sash, the only thing keeping Worf from plunging to the 
bottom of the Turbolift shaft, some thirty decks below.
	After being returned to solid ground, Worf turned
thankfully to Data and started to thank him before he realized
that neither he nor the android expected or required such
sentiments.  Instead, Worf went to the far wall of the Bridge,
saying as he went, "He has shut down all Turbolift activity.
We must climb down to Main Engineering.  He will soon 
activate the self-destruct mechanism."
	As Worf opened a recessed hatch revealing a narrow
ladder, Data asked "How do you know he will activate the self-
destruct mechanism?"
	"Because, it is what I would do in a similar situation."
	Worf started down the ladder, followed by Data.
Unbeknownst to either of them, the security console had
begun to register three lifesigns and one android aboard.
Seconds later, another reading appeared, then another.  Soon,
there were close to twenty lifeforms present aboard the
Enterprise.  They were all moving to join the one life-reading
located in Main Engineering.
	"Captain, sensors are picking up a ship approaching
from behind us.  Their readings are like nothing I've seen 
before."  Spock's face was bathed in the blue/green light 
from the Science Station viewer.  
	"Isn't that what you said about the Houdini, Spock?"
asked McCoy.
	Spock gave McCoy a puzzled look.  "Doctor, if you 
persist in these childish delusions about a mystery ship
which no one, including the computer, can remember, you will
be declared unfit for duty."
	"That's enough, you two.  If Bones thinks he saw a
ship, then he saw a ship."  Kirk tried to ease the tension 
on the Bridge.  "Mister Sulu, slow to Impulse power.  Uhura,
hail that ship on all frequencies."
	McCoy looked hard at Kirk.  "Don't patronize me, Jim.
I know what I saw."  Kirk didn't hear McCoy storm off the Bridge.
He was too engrossed in the image on the viewscreen.  A gigantic
ship, cubic in shape, slowly rotated as it followed them.
Its surface was covered with a lattice work of pipes and
conduits.
	"No response to our hails, Captain," reported Uhura.
She turned back to her console, in order to keep trying, when
a face appeared on the viewscreen.  It had a pale-white, 
deathly pallor to it.  The visible part of it, that is,
because most of it was covered be glossy black implants and
wiring.  One eye was gone, replaced by a camera-like appliance.
What could be seen of the body looked to be covered by coal-
black battle armor.
	The face spoke, and yet didn't speak.  The 'voice' 
seemed to be coming from all points on the alien ship.
	"Federation Starship Enterprise, prepare to be
boarded.  All technology and personnel will be absorbed into
the Borg."
	"Who, or what, are the Borg?" asked Kirk.
	"We are the Borg."
	"Fascinating.  A race of techno/biological beings."
Spock had turned from his Science Station to stand next to
Kirk.  The faint whirring of the automatic sensors could be
heard from deep within it.
	"Where do you come from?  What do you want?"  Kirk
hoped he could stall long enough to come up with a plan.
	"Many of your years ago, we evolved at the outer 
edge of this galaxy.  We were created.  Our creators were
absorbed and we continue to absorb and evolve.  During
a great catastrophe, many of the Borg were destroyed.
Those remaining were left without purpose...Until the coming
of Khan."
	Kirk was nearly speechless.  He managed to croak out
"Khan?  As in Khan Noonian Singh?"
	"The Khan came to us badly damaged.  He told us of 
the Genesis device and of how it joined him with Reliant.  
They are both of the Borg now.  They have become one with 
us as you shall.  The past is irrelevant, damage is irrelevant,
you are irrelevant.  Prepare to be assimilated."
	The screen went dark and there was a noticeable THUNK
as the Borg tractor beam locked on.
	"Borg tractor beam locking on," reported Chekov.
	"Mister Sulu, get us out of here, Emergency Warp!"
shouted Kirk.
	Spock, who had gone back to his console, was soon 
joined by Kirk.
	"Spock, have you got anything?"
	"I believe so, Captain.  The Borg ship seems to be
sending out a signal.  It appears to be a combination of 
Khan's brainwaves and the U.S.S. Reliant's signaling beacon."
	"But, Spock, Khan's on Ceti Alpha V and the Reliant's
only been out of drydock for a month," said Kirk.  If he had
heard this from anyone else, he wouldn't believe it, but coming
from Spock, he had no choice.
	"Engineering to Bridge."
	"Bridge here," answered Kirk.  "Go ahead, Geordi."
	"What's going on up there?  I read shield power at
17% and Warp power at 12%."  LaForge's voice, still a little
shaky from his ordeal, held a note of both curiosity and fear.
	"A race called the Borg have locked a tractor beam
on us and are draining our power," answered Kirk.  After he
got no response from below, he said, "Geordi, are you there?
Geordi?"
	No response.  Kirk just assumed that Geordi had 
rushed away to get more power for the engines and shields.
	In Engineering, Geordi had blacked out as soon as
Kirk mentioned the Borg.  He was only now regaining his 
senses as the channel to the Bridge closed.  
	Geordi looked around at the unfamiliar setting.  He
had seen engine rooms like this in his Academy classes, but 
had never really been in the Engineering Section of a 
Constitution Class Heavy Cruiser before.  He took it all 
in, his mind racing with the nostalgia, the sense of history.
	"Chief, what's wrong?" asked Ensign Sumners, new to 
Engineering himself, he had never seen anyone react to a 
comm conversation the way LaForge was.
	"Oh, uh, nothing.  Nothing.  I'll, uh, be right
back."  Geordi headed for the nearest Turbolift at a run.
He had to try to at least stall the Borg until the Enterprise,
HIS Enterprise, got here.  He had no idea where he should even
start.
	"Shields are down.  Warp drive is inoperable.  Jim,
we are powerless," reported Spock from the rear of the Bridge.
	"Well, I guess we'll have to fight then.  Chekov, arm
all phasers and load torpedo bays.  Sulu, bring us about.
Uhura, contact Starfleet.  We need reinforcments!"  Kirk felt
the adrenaline rushing through his system, heightening his 
perceptions.
	"Captain, communications are jammed.  Unable to send 
distress call," reported Uhura from her console.
	"Phasers armed, torpedoes loaded," said Chekov from
the Weapons/Defense Station.  The red alert klaxons and tracer
lights had started as soon as the computer noted the weapons' 
activation.
	"Direct heading for Borg ship.  They are still closing,"
informed Sulu.
	"Chekov, fire when they are within 10 kilometers.  
Sulu, be prepared to get us out of here, maximum possible 
speed," ordered Kirk.
	Sulu and Chekov exchanged worried glances.  Ten
kilometers did not leave much room for error, on either
of their parts.  "Aye, sir," they answered in unison.
	His back turned, leaning over his science viewer,
Spock read off the distance between the Enterprise and the
Borg.  "10,000 kilometers,   8,500 kilometers,  5,000 kilo-
meters,  1,000 kilometers...100 kilometers,  75 kilometers..."
	Everyone on the Bridge watched as the Borg got 
closer and closer.  Kirk hoped that his plan of playing
possum would work.  Everyone else hoped he was right.
	"25 kilometers,  20 kilometers,  15 kilometers,
12 kilometers.  Borg tractor beams and weaponry powering up,
10 kilometers.  Borg tractor beam locking on."  The ship 
trembled as the tractor beam latched on directly to the hull,
no shields intervening this time.
	The Borg cutting beam, fully energized, began slicing
a swathe of destruction across the wide saucer of the Enterprise,
just above her registry numbers.
	"Chekov, Sulu, what are you waiting for?  Fire, get
us out of here!" shouted Kirk.
	Chekov looked worried.  "Sir, I vas about to fire,
when control vas diwerted to somevhere else on the ship.  
The veapons cannot be fired from the Bridge."
	Sulu spoke up, "Same here, Captain.  The course and
speed were laid in and then nothing."
	The ship shook again and damage reports started coming 
in from all areas of the ship, especially the saucer.  The 
Bridge lights flickered and went dark, as did the viewscreen.
	A Borg soldier appeared on the Bridge and started 
advancing toward Kirk, followed by another, and another.
Soon, the entire Bridge crew was being advanced upon by a
small army of Borg.  Then, they stopped.
	"We are under attack.  Return to Borg ship."
They all seemed to echo it and at the same time none of
them made a sound.  They vanished in that swirling pattern
peculiar to the Borg transporters.
	The viewscreen had come back to life, albeit dimly, 
as had the Bridge lighting.  On the screen, they saw a strange
looking ship attacking the Borg.  Then they saw their own 
phasers and photon torpedoes firing.  The other ship, closely
resembling a duck, wove a complex, seemingly random, pattern
around the Borg, firing as it went.  Both the Borg tractor
beam and cutting beam lanced out, but to no effect.  The new 
ship just was not where the Borg had aimed, no matter how fast 
they retargeted the beams.  
	Kirk and the rest of the Bridge crew just stood and
watched the fight, powerless to do anything.  Just as it 
appeared the Borg were finished, the blue/green glow at their
center pulsing feebly, two things happened in close succession.
First, the new ship stopped moving and firing and hung dead in 
space.  This proved insignificant compared to what happened 
next.  The Borg ship split in two pieces, both smaller than
the original, but no less deadly.  
	As Kirk watched in horror, the Borg ship closest to
the new ship oozed completely around it, absorbing it and its
crew.  Then both Borg ships advanced on the Enterprise.
	
	On the Battle Bridge of the Stardrive Section,
Data was instructing the computer as to how and where to 
fly the ship, while he, Worf, and Scotty, stood with their 
backs to each other, surrounded by an ever growing number 
of Borg.  Each of the Enterprise crewmen had a phaser in
each hand, held at the ready.  As the Borg advanced, Scotty
began firing wildly, while Data and Worf each fired controlled,
accurate bursts into the advancing wall.  
	"Lieutenant Commander Scott, you must be careful 
what you shoot.  You may hit something..."  Worf paused 
wearily as a console exploded in flames.  "...important,"
he finished.
	"Och, sorry," the Scotsman replied sheepishly.
He turned to fire at another advancing Borg, but it was too
late.  The Borg were upon them.  They were dragged over to
an Engineering monitor that had been hooked up to the Bridge
viewscreen.
	
	The view was of the Borg ship, tractor beam firmly
holding the gleaming white hull of the Enterprise.  As Data
watched in fascination, and Worf and Scott in fear, the Borg
ship split into two roughly equal sections, the nearer of the
two advancing on the Enterprise.  It opened up, like a great,
ragged maw, Borg soldiers in their cubicles clearly visible,
and engulfed the Stardrive Section.  The viewscreen went
blank as the Borg herded the three Starfleet officers to the 
nearest airlock, and away from the useless Starship.
Here is Chapter 13.  Only three more to go and they'll probably be posted
Saturday.  (Have to see Bill&Ted's Bogus Journey on Friday #B-)


			CHAPTER 13
Captain's Log, Stardate: the past.
	We are in pursuit of the Stardrive section of the 
Enterprise, after it was commandeered by Lieutenant Commander
Data, Lieutenant Worf, and Chief Engineer Scott.  To add to 
the problem, we are being slowed down by towing the energy
creature behind us, but it is necessary.  Engineer's 
Assistant Gomez assures me that we will be able to make the
time jump as soon as we reconnect the sections of the 
Enterprise.  On a more ominous note, more and more of my 
crew are either unable or unwilling to remember that Scott
is Chief Engineer.  They remember someone named Geordi
LaForge at that post.  I am going to look into the matter.
	Picard got up from behind the desk in his Ready
Room.  He was disturbed by everyone's insistence that they
had never heard of anyone by the name of Montgomery Scott.
And now Pulaski was becoming more and more convinced that
he was the head of a conspiracy to deceive everyone on this
ship.  His supposed purpose for this conspiracy eluded
him.  Wearily, he stepped out onto the Bridge.
	No one seemed to notice him enter.  All eyes were
on the forward viewscreen.  On the screen, this era's
Enterprise hung motionless in space, flanked by not one,
but two Borg ships.  One ship was larger than the other by
about a half.  Even from this distance, Borg were visible
walking along the hull of the Enterprise, stopping every
so often to remove a section of the hull for further 
analysis.  
	'Not again,' thought Picard.  'Now I have to deal
with the loss of the Stardrive, the Borg, and possibly the 
death of every lifeform from this era.'
	Riker was about to tap his combadge to signal Picard
when he noticed the Captain standing just outside the Ready
Room doors.  "Captain, the Borg just came into range.  Sensors
indicate that the dilithium trail left by the Stardrive Section
ends right where the large Borg ship is.  There are no traces
of either the ships destruction, or damage to the Borg."
	"I sense Q's hand in this," said Picard gravely.
"Is it possible, that he pulled a switch?"
	"'A switch.'  I don't understand."  Riker's 
puzzlement was evident, due to the lack of his ever present
grin.  Picard sympathized with him.  He didn't quite 
understand either, it was just a dimly formed idea in the
back of his mind.
	"What I mean is, do you think it possible that Q
switched the Stardrive Section with the Borg ships, sending
the Enterprise home to our time?"  
	"Knowing Q, anything's possible.  I would say that it's
probable, considering that the Saucer can't reach Warp speeds
and we'd have no way to get back without his help," answered
Riker.
	By now, the distance between the Enterprise and the 
Borg had decreased to less than 10,000 kilometers.  "Arm all
weapons," ordered Picard, even though he knew that only 
phasers were available.  He also knew, as did most of the 
Bridge crew, that they would have to be extremely lucky with
the few phaser shots available to them before the Borg fully
adapted.  'Not the most promising of situations,' Picard
thought to himself.
	Aboard the Enterprise, Geordi had already expended 
all photon torpedoes and drained all the phaser banks into 
the smaller Borg ship.  Nothing worthwhile had happened.
Most of the firing had been due to a feeling of revenge 
over the fate of the Stardrive Section.  He knew that there
was no hope left for any of its occupants.
	He just sat there, staring blankly ahead, not noticing
when the Borg soldiers walked into view of the camera.  He
couldn't help but think that it was all his fault, somehow.
'If only I had been on the Enterprise...'  Then the more
realistic part of him answered, 'You'd be a Borg by now.
Besides, this is the Enterprise.'  The fact that it was an
inferior design to the one he knew didn't matter.  The name
meant something, and he had watched the most recent bearer 
of that name be destroyed.
	Slowly, in the back of his mind, an idea took shape.
It was, admittedly, a long shot.  And, he'd need some help to
pull it off, but at least it was something to do.  He only 
hoped that there was someone left alive on the Stardrive 
Section, and that it had not yet been incorporated into the 
Borg.
	On the Bridge of the Enterprise, Kirk stared at the
viewscreen, speechless.  If a ship of that size could so
easily be captured by the Borg, how could his ship, his crew,
hope to do any better.
	If he was unprepared for the absorption of the
Stardrive, he was definitely surprised by the face that 
appeared next on the viewscreen.  It stared out at him
with the cold, steely malevolence that he remembered over
fourteen long years.  The face was a computer reconstruction,
he realized, by the way the image wavered and the mouth 
refused to move when it spoke.
	"Kirk.  I have waited nearly a century to defeat
you, to punish you for what you did.  My crew are all gone,
destroyed by your treachery, but I still have life, of a 
sort.  On two occasions have you sentenced me to death,
but I have survived.  I now impose sentence on you."
	"Khan, what do you want.  And what do you mean, a
century.  It's only been 14 years."
	"Jim, sensors indicate that the transmission is being
broadcast from the Borg ship, but not from one specific
location.  It is as if the entire ship were hailing us,"
Spock reported.
	Kirk turned back to the screen as the voice spoke 
again.  "To you it has been years, but to me, to me it has
been a century.  First Marla, my wife, then Joachim, then,
nearly, myself, Kirk.  But no, I held on and now, you die."
The transmission cut off and Kirk looked at Spock.
	"Clearly insane, Captain.  His years of isolation 
must have effected his mind."
	"I hope you're right, Spock.  I also hope that he's
powerless to carry out his threat."
	Kirk's only answer was a shudder running through the
ship, as two tractor beams locked onto the twin engine nacelles
and began pulling them off.  The Borg did not engage their
cutting beam, just pulling the engines closer and closer.
Kirk at first wondered how only one ship could do that, without
just pulling the Enterprise closer.  Then he realized that the 
larger ship had locked onto the Enterprise's forward hull while
the other ship pulled at the rear.
	'Like an interstellar game of 'Tug-o'-War',' thought
Sulu to himself, unable to do anything to prevent the 
destruction of the Enterprise which would ensue, should the 
hull rupture when the nacelles were removed.
	"Any suggestions," asked Kirk.  
	No one said a word.
	Geordi ran along the corridors of the Enterprise,
but everyone was concentrating on finding a solution to the 
Borg so no one noticed him.  He ran into the Transporter 
Room and began to reprogram the console.  The Transporter
Operator turned from where he had been recalibrating one
of the wall panels, but was phasered before he could raise
the alarm.
	Finished, Geordi stepped onto the platform and 
prepared to beam out.  The console was locked and his would
be the last normal beam-out.  Further, the console could only
be reactivated by his voice command.  No one else would be
able to get it to function correctly, anyway, after Geordi's
reprogramming.
	The Transporter Room shimmered around him, and was
replaced by the familiar confines of the Engineering Deck,
deep within the Stardrive Section.  He cautiously checked 
to be sure that there were no Borg anywhere near Engineering
before he set to work.
	He had accessed the ship's computer and set to work
rerouting a myriad of control circuits before he heard it.
At first he thought he had imagined it, but then he heard it
again.  The dull thud of a footstep.  It echoed hollowly in
the empty ship.
	'Empty except for me and who, or what?' wondered
Geordi in the back of his mind, as he hurriedly tried to 
finish what he was doing and get into hiding.  
	He was more than three quarters of the way done
when the next footstep came, unnervingly close.  Geordi 
worked faster.
	He was about to press home the final modification 
when behind him, he heard the whisper of a movement, the 
soft padding of a footstep on carpeting, and a large
shadow fell over Geordi's shoulder and across the panel
where he was working.
	Without thinking, Geordi turned, drawing his phaser,
and fired.
	Kirk's spirits had been buoyed somewhat by the 
arrival of the other ship, the one McCoy kept calling the 
Houdini.  Then he saw how ineffectual the other ship was 
against the Borg.  Its phaser bursts lit up space and its
photon torpedoes created dazzling explosions, but did 
nothing to even slow the Borg down.  The Borg ship that had
swallowed the first Starship had now begun to advance upon 
the disc-shaped newcomer.
	"Captain, sensors show what may be a power build-up
on the larger Borg ship," reported Spock, looking into his
viewer.
	"Can't you tell for sure, Spock?" asked Kirk.
	"Impossible at this time.  The Borg on our hull have
damaged some of the primary sensor equipment and their 
individual readings are interfering with what sensors are
still available to us."
	"We've GOT to DO something!" shouted Kirk.  He was
used to fighting machine intelligences, having done so on 
many occasions in the past, but they had been nothing like
the Borg.  If something did not conform to their purposes, it
was either assimilated or termed 'irrelevant' and ignored.
He had a feeling that most of his ship and crew, unfortunately,
fell into the former category.
	"Keptin," Chekov spoke up, trying to get Kirk's
attention.  "One of the transporters has just been actiwated.
Internal scans also show that vun of the shuttlecraft has 
been transported somevhere else, not vithin current scanner
range.  Vait!  There goes another vun."
	The lights on the Bridge began to dim.
	"Spock, what's going on?"
	"Captain, main power has been diverted to Transporter
Room 3.  Also, life support and 75% of emergency power.  
Total Warp energy is now being beamed somewhere.  The power
output is too high to register on my scans.  I would estimate
that it is in the 1,000 to 2,000 GigaWatt range," reported 
Spock, calmly.
	"Spock, do you know what you're saying?"  McCoy's ice
blue eyes seemed to pierce through the Vulcan.
	"Indeed I do, Doctor.  Someone in this vicinity is
using 97% of ship's power for an unknown and presumably 
hostile purpose."
	Kirk was concentrating so hard on finding a solution
to this latest threat, that he just let McCoy and Spock go on
verbally sparring, barely registering in the back of his 
mind.
	Ensign Gawron dove out of the way of the phaser blast.
Geordi, seeing who it was, had tryed to throw his aim off at 
the last second.  He succeeded in moving the phaser beam just
above where Chris's head used to be.  By now, Chris was 
peering out from behind an Engineering console, phaser in 
hand.
	"Sorry, Chris.  Just a little jumpy I guess," said 
Geordi, trying to force a laugh.  "What are you doing here,
anyway?  I thought the Borg would have rounded everybody up
to make ready for the assimilation process."
	"They did.  I was hiding in the auxiliary dilithium
store.  Between the radiation and the shielding in my rad
suit, they couldn't detect me.  What are you doing here?"
	"I've come up with a plan to defeat the Borg, or
at least the Borg ship that has us trapped."  Geordi went
on to explain his plan to the young Ensign, who volunteered
to do what he could to help.
	Geordi put him to work, rerouting the power couplings 
on the Warp Drive circuits, while he crawled into a Jeffries
tube to check the actual power conduits.  After working for
twenty minutes, the modifications were complete.  
	They looked at each other in apprehension when Chris
asked, "But will it work?"
	Geordi answered, "Cross your fingers, just in case,
'cause here goes nothing."
	Geordi slammed home the button that would send out
the pre-recorded signal to the original Enterprise and 
start siphoning off its power.  Behind them, as they studied
the control readouts, the Warp Core began to grow brighter.
Along with the brightness, came the high whine of power.  
Soon, the Warp Core was pulsing with the combined power of
two Starships, the pulses coming so fast, that the eye could
barely discern them from a solid, incandescent glow.
	The monitor screens began to change.
	On the Saucer, Picard was giving what may be his 
last order.  "All hands to stations.  Prepare for collision
course!  All non-essential personnel to the escape pods.
Disengage tractor beam from the creature and jettison the
log buoy."
	Riker, like the rest of the Bridge Crew, looked at
Picard in astonishment.  'He can't be giving up,' he thought
in disbelief.  "Sir, are you sure?  I mean, couldn't the 
creature just eat the Borg's energy like it did to us,
rendering them powerless?"
	"We could, Number One, if the creature was 
conscious.  It is not.  It appears to be hibernating now,
while it 'digests' our energy,"  Picard said with resignation.
	"Course laid in, Captain," stated Wesley Crusher.
"Maximum speed at an angle of 45 degrees to the closer Borg
ship."  Picard had told him to lay in the course that would
damage the Borg the most, giving no regard to the safety of
what was left of the Enterprise-D.
	"Why 45 degrees, Wes?" asked Riker.
	"Because of the orientation of the Borg ships, a 
collision at 45 degrees with the nearer of the two, will send
us directly into the other Borg ship, currently dissecting 
the original Enterprise," he answered matter-of-factly, as 
if it were apparent, or should be, to everyone.
	"Captain," said the Lieutenant at Ops.  "Reading a 
power surge from the closer Borg ship.  Its center is the 
exact geometric center of the Borg ship, and it radiates
outward from there.  There is also a subspace link of some
sort with the original Enterprise."
	On the viewscreen, the Borg ship had stopped moving.
Impossibly, it was still growing larger, expanding as its 
surface began to split and tear.  Glimpses of bluish-grey
metal could be seen fleetingly through the crackling of 
static and the flare of explosions.  
	The disturbance on the screen was so bright, so
violent, that the viewscreen shorted out, filling with 
static.
	On the Borg ship itself, all was in a well-order,
cybernetic panic.  The loss of atmosphere did not concern
the Borg, whose self-contained life support systems made 
the need for air unnecessary.  The major concern was the
immense power being generated.  It wreaked havoc with the
Borg subspace net, cutting off communications within the 
Borg mind itself.  Only the occasional, half-completed
thought made it anywhere, usually not where it was intended,
however.
	The three Enterprise crewmen were running through the
Borg ship, Data directing them back along the path they had
come while escorted by the Borg.  The Borg were paying no
attention to them now, and they took full advantage of the 
fact.  Many times, their path back to the Enterprise was
blocked by airless regions which had been sealed off.  The
group lost valuable time by retracing their steps and going
around the damaged areas.
	Occasionally, the local light dimmed, or flared 
brilliantly as an explosion blasted a section of the 
Borg ship, or a Borg soldier, into hundreds of component
parts, not all of them inorganic.
	With the Enterprise in sight, however, their progress
was halted by a wall of solid energy.  It advanced on them 
slowly, backing them up against a section of the Borg ship.
Immediately, the wall started to flow around them, trying to
assimilate them.  It had been the group-mind's last coherent 
order and the ship still tryed to obey.  
	The trio could feel metallic probes plunging through
their skin, examining their internal structure.  The wall
released Data immediately, convinced by his robotic workings 
that he was already a Borg.
	Realizing that someone in the Stardrive Section was 
responsible for their predicament, he tapped his combadge, 
the only one the trio had left.  
	"Data to Enterprise.  Do you read, Enterprise.
Three to beam up immediately, these coordinates."
	Someone on the ship heard him, because just as the
wall of energy began to singe the front of Data's uniform,
the wall disappeared and a transporter beam yanked them 
aboard.  A split second later, the wall was back in place,
advancing outward, forcing the ship to retreat before it.
	The Borg ship exploded.


	Here is the next Chapter of my epic #B-)


			Chapter 14
	From out of the midst of the explosion, came the
Enterprise's Stardrive hull, shields flaring brightly where 
debris from the Borg ship passed through them.  Even more
surprising, the shields were clearly visible, pulsing with
energy.
	On board the Stardrive module, Geordi was hurriedly
explaining his plan to Data, Worf, and Scotty.  "...So I had
the Enterprise transporters lock onto anything in the 
cargo bay or the raw material store for the replicator and 
beamed the energy directly into the Warp chamber, without
materializing it into matter.  This energy was fed directly 
into the shields and used to push the Borg ship apart around
us."
	Scott and Data were listening intently, but Worf was
ready to fight.  "How much power is left for the weapons?" the
Klingon asked.
	As they entered Engineering, Chris looked up and 
answered, "Enough for you to indulge yourself, Lieutenant."
	This brought a slow smile to Worf's face, and he 
turned to Data, "Permission to attack the Borg, sir."
	Data tilted his head to the side as he thought it
over, gold eyes reflecting the energy surges in the Warp 
core.  "Granted, Lieutenant, but only until we reconnect the
sections."
	"Aye, sir."  Worf turned and hurried to the Battle
Bridge.
	"Data, I have a plan," said Gawron.  "And I'd like 
to see what you think of it."
	"Proceed, Ensign."
	"Since our shields are still at excess power levels,"
he looked at Geordi, questioningly, who nodded, then continued,
"why don't we execute a series of suicide runs at the Borg
ship?"
	"Ensign, why should we wish to kill ourselves?" asked 
the android.
	"No, Data," said Geordi.  "What he means is to fly over
the Borg ship so that the lower part of the shields is actually
inside the Borg ship, ripping it away.  If Worf fires phasers
simultaneously, we could do a lot of damage before they can 
adapt."
	"Very well, Geordi, implement this plan.  You also,
Ensign."
	As they left, Scott turned to Data.  "An' what about 
me?  I dinna belong here."
	"You mean you remember where you belong, now?"
	"Yes, sir.  I belong on the Enterprise, but not
this one.  At least not yet," he finished hopefully.
	"We will return you to your ship at the earliest 
possible convenience," replied Data.
	"Kin I at least have a look around, first?" 
	"Of course, Commander," Data nodded.  "Be my guest."
	Scott gleefully ran from station to station, examining
readouts.
	On the Bridge of the Saucer, Picard was thrown off 
his feet and everyone else was knocked off their feet by the
force of the explosion.
	In Sickbay, Doctors Pulaski and Selar were just 
helping Aures out of her bed, to walk around Sickbay, when
the explosion came.  The diagnostic panel above the bed 
ripped free from the wall and crashed down on Aures.  Sparks
danced across the back of the unit, and the smell of burnt
flesh and melted hair came from beneath the medical scanner.
	Because of the free electricity, neither Pulaski nor
Selar could get near enough to check Aures' life signs.  Not 
that it would have mattered anyway.  If she had been at the 
best hospital in the Federation, with the best surgeons, it
wouldn't have mattered.  Aures' body was little more than a
piece of charcoal.
	As they both knew that Aures was done for, Pulaski
and Selar left her where she was for the moment, and began 
making preparations for the wounded they knew would soon
arrive.  Unseen by them, a brief flash of electricity arced
up one of the electrical pathways that was still connected
and disappeared into the wall.
	"Spock, what in the hell do they think they're
doing," screamed Kirk, as the Stardrive roared low over the
Borg, apparently headed directly for the Enterprise.
	As the Stardrive passed over the Borg, a layer twenty 
meters thick appeared to dissolve.  Large pits were created 
by the withering phaser fire, every one of which found its 
mark at such great power, that for now at least, the Borg's
adaptational abilities were useless.
	"It would appear, Captain, that that ship is on our
side, and making an attempt to free us from the Borg tractor
beam," answered the Vulcan calmly.
	"Captain, Warp engines back online and under helm 
control," Sulu reported, surprised, as his console returned
to life.
	"Veapons fully functional, as vell, Keptin," reported
Chekov.
	"Whoever took control from the Bridge, must have set
a time delay before he beamed out," mused Kirk, out loud.
Then to Sulu, "Lay in course 90 mark 174, get us above the
action as quickly as possible, Mister Sulu."
	"Aye, sir," the Asian replied.  "Course laid in,
maximum speed."
	
	The Enterprise limped and struggled to rise.  Slowly
it picked up speed, faltering because of the Borg damage.
Although the Warp engines were online, the engine nacelles
themselves were so damaged and out of alignment, that Warp
speed would have been impossible.
	The Stardrive section turned to make another pass, but
this time, the Borg erected a force field and the Enterprise 
shields dropped down to 50% of normal as the ship passed through
it.  Worf's phaser barrage was now shrugged off, as well.
	On the Battle Bridge, Data was opening a channel to 
the Saucer Section.  "Data to Picard.  I suggest we reconnect
the Enterprise."
	"Agreed," came Picard's voice over the comm-channel.
"Rendezvous with the Saucer at 176 mark 265 in 60 seconds."
	"Aye, sir.  Data out."
	"Course 118 mark 53, speed .2 impulse," reported 
Ensign Gawron, anticipating Data's orders.
	"Lieutenant Worf, cease fire.  Damage report of
Stardrive Section and Borg ship."
	"Aye, Commander.  Minor damage to lower four decks
of Stardrive Section.  Shield power increasing to normal.
Scanning the Borg now...  Energy levels down 15%, subspace
activity 56% of normal," reported the Klingon calmly.  Then,
with some surprise, "Sir, the Borg ship has been reduced in 
size by 12%.  Reading no atmosphere...wait, they are rebuilding.
Reading minimal atmosphere."
	"Acknowledged, Lieutenant," said Data.  "Prepare to
reconnect the Enterprise."  Data tapped out all his commands
on the control pad mounted into the Command Chair's armrests.
The Saucer grew larger as it seemed to drift across, then be
centered in the forward viewscreen.
	"Distance 250 meters and closing," Data counted off.
"200 meters...decreasing speed to 10 meters per second...100
meters...50 meters...decreasing speed to 5 meters per sec--"
	The saucer spun crazily on the viewscreen, as the 
Borg ship pummeled it under a disastrous barrage.  All 
occupants of the Stardrive and Saucer had been so intent on
reconnecting the Enterprise, that they forgot the Borg's 
ability to fight while they heal themselves.
	The Bridge exhaust fans began to clear the smoke
from the sparking, smoldering consoles.  On the Enterprise
schematic on the rear wall, large sections of the Stardrive
section flashed read, damaged.
	"Warning!  Hull breached on decks 14 through 19, and
decks 25 through 31!  Severe structural damage on decks 12
through 33!"  The computer's voice could be heard over the
red alert klaxons.
	"Computer, projected time until total structural 
failure," requested Data.
	"Five minutes and 14 seconds, if no further damage
is incurred," the computer responded, matter-of-factly.
	"Chief Engineer," said Data, activating his combadge.
	"Yes," answered Geordi and Scott simultaneously from
Engineering.
	"I require the Enterprise shields to be reconfigured
to 'form-fit' the Enterprise.  Use all available power, except
life support and weapons."
	"Aye, sir."  Again, they both answered in unison, as 
the link closed.
	"Ensign Gawron, plot a course to the nearest planet
with an atmosphere within 10% of Earth's," ordered Data.
	"Yes, sir.  Wolf 359C is within 5 minutes of our
present position at Warp 2," Gawron answered.
	"Lay in a course and engage.  Also contact the Saucer
and have them follow us."
	"Aye, sir."
	The Stardrive section turned and entered Warp space,
followed, on impulse power, by the Saucer and its burden.
Seeing the Stardrive section as the main threat, the Borg
decided to chase the Engineering hull and to destroy the 
Saucer later.  Soon all was quiet, except for the Enterprise's
emergency beacon: "Help.  U.S.S. Enterprise, to any ships in
range.  This is Captain James T. Kirk.  Need assistance.
Hurry."
	"The shield is reinforcing the hull, but I still
don't think it will withstand the strain of entering a planet's
atmosphere," said Geordi concernedly over the intercom from
Engineering.  He had heard what Data had in mind, and even 
though it would in all likelyhood destroy the Borg, it could
do the same to the ship.
	"Understood, Geordi.  Your objection is noted.
Proceed with modifications to the navigational deflector
as per my specifications," answered the android from the 
Battle Bridge.
	Chris turned from the navigator's station, looking
questioningly at Data.  He had never heard of the android 
so cavalierly disregarding such a strong warning as Geordi
had first expressed.  Still, his was not to question, but for
now, to fly the ship.
	Worf was once again manning tactical, even though he 
had nothing to do for the moment.  Data sat in the command 
chair, concentrating his thoughts on Captain Picard.  'Why 
hadn't he said anything about my freeing Worf and stealing
the Stardrive Section?  Did he now remember who Geordi was?'
He knew none of the answers for certain, which to Data was 
as good as not knowing the answers at all.  
	"Now entering orbit around Wolf 359C," reported 
Gawron.  The planet on the viewscreen, third from the red
star, was mostly brown mottled with a sickly grey/green.
Small oceans or lakes of molten rock dotted the surface.
What water there was, evaporated into the atmosphere as
soon as it fell on the still boiling surface.  The planet
may have had an Earth-like atmosphere, but it was the 
Earth of three and a half billion years ago.
	"Geordi," Data called down to Engineering.  "How
long until we will be ready to implement?"
	"Give me one more minute to fine tune my adjustments,"
the Engineer replied.  In the background, Scott could be heard
cursing loudly.  Helping Geordi, he had reversed the polarity 
on the shield bypass circuit.  Final result, a set of scorched
fingers and jangled nerves.
	"Mister Gawron, plot a course to insert us into the
planet's atmosphere at 75 degrees to the surface."
	"Aye, Commander Data," the young man replied.
	"Mister Worf, status of Borg ship?"
	"Sensors show they will arrive in 35 seconds.  
Energy readings are 89% of normal.  No exterior damage
evident," the Klingon said simply.  Of all the foes he 
had faced, the Borg scared him the most.  He did not like
to admit it, but he was terrified by their emotionless
natures.
	"Mister Gawron, is course laid in?" asked Data.  The
android was nervous, if such a thing was possible.  He alone,
after much analysis, knew the Borg's full potential for 
destruction.
	"Course computed and laid in.  Ready on your command."
	On the arm of Data's chair, a light flashed, 
indicating that Geordi, also, was ready.
	In a ripple of space, the Borg ship appeared, dropping
out of Warp space less than 5 kilometers.  As it rotated, 
everyone saw the truth of Worf's sensor scans.  They could 
see no damage.  In fact, the Borg ship looked more powerful
than before it was damaged.  Slowly, almost warily, it 
advanced on the Enterprise.
	The tractor beam lashed out, but the Enterprise was
no longer there.  It had retreated into the planet's atmosphere.
The Borg fired again, seemingly reluctant to follow the 
Stardrive Section.  Another clean miss.  This time, however,
the Enterprise's tractor beam fired, locking on dead center 
to the face of the Borg cube nearest it.  
	The Borg entered the atmosphere, having no choice
other than to enter Warp again and risk losing the Enterprise.
As the two ships moved deeper into the cloud of swirling 
gases, the glow of the Enterprise's tractor beam dimmed,
atmospheric particles interfering with its intensity.
	
	On the Bridge, Data watched with satisfaction as the
Borg were drawn ever deeper toward the planet.  Geordi's 
status report had not been encouraging and the computer
kept reminding them that the Enterprise would experience 
fatal structural failure if they did not leave the planet's 
atmosphere.  Data thought back to his plan.  It seemed 
foolish now, but in theory it would work.
	Data had reasoned that if the Borg could adapt to
a purely energy attack, then what was needed was a more
physical approach.  Unfortunately, in space, such a physical
assault would be impossible, short of colliding the Enterprise
with the Borg.  No, instead he had opted for a different
approach.  He theorized that if some kind of connector 
between the Borg and the Enterprise could be set up, and 
the correct vibrational frequency found, that the Borg
could be destroyed.  The best connector he could think of
that was nearby, was a planetary atmosphere.  And, because
of it's content of water vapor, an Earth-like atmosphere was
sufficiently thick to conduct the sound vibrations he intended
to use.
	When Gawron reported that the Borg were fifteen 
kilometers from the surface, Data press the control studs on
the right chair arm without looking, eyes intent on the 
viewscreen.  The image on the viewscreen, the Borg ship in
pursuit, swung quickly sideways and had to be reoriented to
face forward once the spinning had stopped.  The Enterprise 
was now facing the Borg at a range of one kilometer.
	"Mister Worf, fire," ordered Data.
	A deep, basso rumbling filled the Bridge, deafening
all on it.  Data knew that it must be worse for those in 
Engineering, closer to the deflector.  The power continued 
to build up, threatening to tear the ship asunder.
	Geordi lost consciousness first, then Scott.  Gawron
was next, followed quickly be Worf.  They just slumped over
where they were sitting or standing, dead to the world.  
	Data did not notice however.  He, too, was suffering
under the onslaught from the sound waves.  Although more
resilient than the others, his hearing, so much more 
sensitive, went first.  Then his optic and vocal circuits
were interrupted.  Finally darkness closed in and Data's
last thought to himself, trying to speak and failing,
"So, this is death.  Intriguing."  Then Data slumped over
sideways, too soon to hear the computer.
	"Warning, forward progress not abated.  Planetary
collision imminent.  Five minutes to impact."
	These warnings joined the ones about structural
failure, the computer talking to itself in stereo, yet
with the same voice.
	The Enterprise continued its descent, followed by
the Borg cube, until, sufficient power built up, a beam of
solid sound erupted from the navigational deflector dish and
slammed into the Borg ship.
	"Mister Callari, how long until we reach Wolf 359?"
asked Picard.
	"About five minutes, sir," the young officer replied.
	"Preliminary sensor scans?" queried Riker.
	The young blond lieutenant at Ops spoke without 
turning, "Sensors show a massive energy discharge deep 
within Wolf 359C's atmosphere.  Sensors unable to detect
any ships in the area."
	"None whatsoever?  That does not bode well, Number
One.  Surely, after the saucer, we're next.  All hands to
emergency battlestations.  Red Alert."  
	The red tracer lights flashed and the klaxon 
sounded as Picard grimly sat down in the command chair,
contemplating what was almost certainly to be a battle to
the death, with his side coming up short.
	"Captain, life support falling below minimum,"
Spock reported calmly, face neutral.  If Spock feared 
death, he did not show it.
	"Dammit, Spock, show some emotion for a change!"
shouted McCoy from his customary position behind the 
Captain's chair.  He was perhaps a bit more irritable than
usual because, now that Geordi LaForge was no longer on the
Enterprise, McCoy was the only one who remembered him.  He
knew Scotty belonged on the Enterprise, but he had vanished.
	"Calm down, you two," Kirk said wearily from where
he had been pacing up and down in front of the viewscreen.
Spock raised an eyebrow, not realizing he had shown any 
emotion, because he indeed had not.  
	McCoy continued to bluster.  "But, Jim, if we don't
do something soon --"
	Kirk interrupted, "I understand, Bones.  I've got
Spock working on the Science angle and Kyle and Leslie
working in Engineering to get us up and running."  
	Kirk seemed pleased with himself, but McCoy would
not be distracted and finished his proclamation, "We're
dead, Jim.  Or as good as dead."
	"Thank you, Doctor."  Kirk realized, too late, his
unintentional and exagerrated emphasis on the last word.
	McCoy turned on his heel and stormed off the Bridge. 
	"The good Doctor's concern is overly emotional, but
it is also logical, Jim," said Spock, for once siding with
McCoy.  Spock felt fortunate that McCoy would never learn 
of it, or he would chide Spock about it for the rest of their
days.  As they only had four hours left, however, it would be
barely tolerable.
	"I know, Spock, but I had to get McCoy off the Bridge
so that we could concentrate.  Uhura, have all off-duty personnel
return to their quarters and tell them to take it easy, conserve
as many resources as possible.  Also, have someone distribute 
the oxygen tanks from the space suits to all on-duty crewmen."
	"Aye, sir," Uhura answered and went to work at her
console, giving the appropriate orders to the appropriate 
people.
	"Mister Sulu, get us as close as possible to an M class
planet.  Mister Chekov, prepare to abandon ship."  Kirk turned 
to Spock.  "Spock, I'll need your help, when the time comes, 
with the self-destruct command."
	"Unwise, Captain, but I will assist."
	The crew set about their given assignments, trying 
to ignore the steadily decreasing readouts on the life support
monitors.


Well, what do you think?

Enjoy...


	Here is the next to last chapter of my book.  I am planning to
(eventually) write a sequel of sorts.  The sequel is set up in Chapter 16,
along with some interesting details which make BOBWII more plausible, at
least in my mind...But that's a tale for another day, or maybe this afternoon.



		Chapter 15
	Captain's Log, Stardate 8330.5:
		We are towing the energy creature through
space in pursuit of the Stardrive Section.  Commander Data
has come up with a plan to defeat the Borg, and I have 
given him my permission to implement it.  For some reason,
I find myself with an uneasy feeling concerning Data and
Worf, and how they came to be on the Stardrive Section by
themselves, but no one can remember how they got there.
I am assuming Q's involvement.

	The Saucer dropped came to a slow stop just outside
of the Wolf-359 star system, the tractor beam glowing brightly,
connecting the Enterprise and the energy leech.
	"No contact with the Stardrive Section or the Borg,"
reported Ensign Callari.  "Sensors do, however, register a
tremendous power discharge well within the Wolf-359C's
atmosphere."
	"Thank you, Ensign," acknowledged Picard.  
Picard turned to Riker.  "If there is no sign of the
Stardrive hull soon, we must at least return to the future
with the energy creature."
	"What about Geordi, Worf, and Data?" asked Troi,
concerned.
	"We have no choice.  If we cannot contact Data, we
must assume that they have been destroyed by the Borg."
Then, speaking to the ceiling of the Bridge, "Picard to
Engineering."
	"Gomez here, sir," came the reply.
	"Prepare impulse engines for the slingshot effect,
using Wolf-359 as the center of the orbit," said Picard 
gravely.
	"But, sir--" Gomez began, and was cut off.
	"I don't like the idea any more than you do, Mister
Gomez, but the safety of the Federation must take precedence
over any three officers," the Captain almost whispered.
	"Understood, sir." 
	The connection was broken.
	"One question, Captain."
	"Go ahead, Number One."
	"What if the Borg did destroy the Stardrive, but
still survived?  What if, by traveling into the future,
we condemn the Federation in the past?" Riker asked pointedly.
	Picard thought a moment.  "A chance I'm willing to
take, Will.  We are here, we exist.  That, at least, makes 
me think that the Federation of this era does indeed survive.
We have no such knowledge of the future."
	"Still, I would like my objections logged, sir,"
Riker requested stiffly.
	"Of course, Number One.  But if we don't succeed,
there will be no one to hear them.  Ensign Callari, lay in
an elliptical course for Wolf-359.  Distance, 1 AU," Picard
ordered.
	"You do realize how close we'll come to the star's
surface, don't you sir?" asked Callari.
	"Affirmative.  Plot the course.  Our maximum speed
with the creature in tow is three quarters the speed of light,
so calculate distances accordingly."
	"Aye, sir."  Then, after a brief pause, "Course 
plotted and laid in."
	"Very good."  And, with a flick of the wrist, Picard
ordered, "Engage."
	The Saucer moved off in its wide, but ever-decreasing
orbit of Wolf-359.
	The beam of solid sound shook the Enterprise, which
was shielded from the brunt of the force.  It was infinitely
worse for the Borg.  The beam pummeled its way through the
leading face of the cube, disintegrating the ship at the
molecular level.  The beam continued through to the other
side of the Borg ship, erupting out the far side of the 
cube and out into space, where the absence of an atmosphere
soon rendered it powerless.
	The Borg, unable to adapt to the strength of the
invisible onslaught, were helpless before it.  As the cube
still continued to rotate, more and more of the ship was 
eaten away by the sonic disruption.  After being subjected 
to it for nearly three minutes, the Borg ship was sliced
in half, the upper and lower forty meters floating freely
in the planets atmosphere, the contents of the Borg ship
falling out to land on the planet's surface or being
dispersed by the Enterprise's weapon.
	Soon, the upper portion of the cube was gone, 
fallen into the deadly vibrations emitted by the Enterprise.
The remaining pieces of the Borg ship landed in the liquid
rock surface of Wolf-359C.
	Data regained consciousness just as the computer 
announced "Warning!  Imminent planetfall!  Altitude 100
meters and decreasing!"
	Data hurriedly rose from the Captain's chair and
rushed to the navigator's position, shoving Ensign Gawron's
comatose form out of the way.  His hands played a surreal,
staccato rhythm over the navigational console.  
	The great warp engines once again became illuminated
internally as the catastrophic power of the matter/antimatter
anhilation once again powered the ship.  
	The ship slowed its descent, stopping just as the 
downward facing end became embedded in the roiling surface.
The warp engines throbbed and the Enterprise was torn free
of the rocky embrace, sprinting for open space.
	Behind them, the few remaining Borg soldiers stirred,
dragging themselves out of the magma slowly, painfully, and
moving toward the remaining section of their ship, now
scarcely visible.
	With what little conscious thought was left to them,
the Borg communicated among themselves "Enterprise will be
destroyed"  "Time"  "Patience"  "Patience is irrelevant"
"Predicted time to repair: 80 Earth years"  
	The Borg mind faded into silence, its many disparate
parts employed in the long task of rebuilding the great ship
from the exstant ores that could be extracted.
	"Computer, estimated time of repair," Data queried.
	"Three hours and twelve minutes," came the concise 
answer, the computer already devoting its energy to the 
automated repair systems.
	Gawron stirred, followed by Worf.  Each sat up
groggily, head in hands.  Moaning softly, they returned to
their stations and began running diagnostic programs.
	"Engineering to Bridge.  Is everyone alright up
there?" came Geordi's voice over the comm channel.
	Data looked from one to the other, receiving curt
nods of affirmation.  "Yes, Geordi, we are all functional.
And yourself and Commander Scott?"
	"We're okay down here.  We've begun repairs to the
Warp engines.  Should be completed in about an hour."
	"What is the top safe Warp speed we can use, Geordi?"
asked the android.
	"Uh, Warp Four," the Engineer replied slowly.  "Why?"
	"We must return Commander Scott to his rightful 
place on board the Enterprise of this time."
	"Oh.  Yeah, forgot about that.  Engineering out."
	"Ensign Gawron, lay in a course for the Enterprise,
Warp four," instructed Data.
	"Aye, sir.  Course laid in," Gawron replied shakily,
still suffering from the sound blast.
	"Execute."
	Data sat back in his chair as the stars on the 
viewscreen elongated into streaks, flashing by.  Fifteen
minutes later, the stars compressed to their normal size
as the Enterprise dropped out of Warp.
	There before them lay what was left of the Enterprise.
Its hull pierced, plating pealed back, it looked as if it 
were rotting.  Electrical arcs were visible through the 
gaping holes.
	The Enterprise moved slowly, its engine struts
twisted, Warp nacelles mangled.  The glow of power in the
engines was barely detectable, as was the light coming from
the portholes in the ship's side.
	The Stardrive section moved in closely, sending as
greeting the communications worm that had worked so well 
before.  An audio only signal was transmitted, telling
Kirk that help was on the way.  Data also said that Scott
was beaming over, fresh from monitoring the shakedown 
cruise of the new U.S.S. Excelsior.
	Memories of this shakedown cruise had been implanted
into Scott's mind, obscuring any thought of the Stardrive 
Section and it's technological advancements.
	Reporting that "A maximum speed trial is yet required,"
Data closed the connection and the Stardrive Section left the
Enterprise behind.  Out of range, Data did not see the four
Federation ships shimmer into existence, dropping out of Warp
just as the Enterprise entered it.
	
	"Set course one one three mark two five, Ensign," 
ordered Data. 
	
	"Aye, sir.  Course laid in," responded the young 
officer.
	"Very well.  Engage, Warp 8.6."
	"Commander, Q told us that we must travel Warp 8.8 
to achieve time travel," argued Worf.
	"I have recomputed the necessary equations and have
found that we need travel only Warp 8.6 because we now lack
the mass of the Saucer Section," Data rattled on, talking
about mass/density relationships in 4th dimensional space
as opposed to 3rd and 5th dimensional space.  He had just
started in on 6th dimensional space when Gawron reported:
"Warp 8.6, sir."
	"Worf, pull the switch," ordered Data.
	When Q had 'installed' the first switch on the Bridge,
he had also put one here, on the Battle Bridge.  Worf eyed 
it suspiciously, but pulled it as ordered.
	The Enterprise leapt forward, as with triple the
acceleration, attaining relative speeds of Warp 19.  The 
Enterprise left it's present time continuum at Warp 10 and
moved forward through time, faster and faster.  
	When it finally dropped out of Warp, it was presented
with a startling view.  On the viewscreen, they watched as 
the Enterprise, somehow whole again, separated, the Stardrive
Section floating toward the Xin ship and detonating.  They 
watched as it was resurrected and propelled through time.
	As the Enterprise left this timestream, the Xin ship
began moving.  In the three hours between the Enterprise's
departure and the Saucer's reappearance, Data, Worf, LaForge,
and Gawron watched as the Xin ship crept through space.
	It had traveled no more than 1000 kilometers when 
the Saucer appeared, dragging the energy leech behind it.
	On the Main Bridge of the Saucer, everyone had been
knocked unconscious by the trip through the ages.  All that 
could be heard was the faint whisper of breathing and the 
computer's voice.
	"Re-entry into proper era established," it spoke
mechanically.  "Disengaging tractor beam."
	The energy leech, already awakening from it's 
artificially induced hibernation, hovered confusedly in 
space.  Finally, rather than attacking the Xin ship, it
advanced on the food source closest at hand, the Saucer.
	
	"Mister Worf, fire a single photon torpedo between
the energy creature and the Xin ship.  Set it to detonate
at one hundred kilometers from the creature," ordered Data.
	"Aye, sir," Worf responded reluctantly.  He would
much rather have fired at the Xin himself, pointless as it
was, than waste a photon torpedo as bait.
	As the photon torpedo flared to life, it's explosion
illuminating the scene, the creature hesitated.  It sensed 
more power, more food, from the explosion.  But that was far
away and this food source was close at hand.
	Finally, it opted for quantity over ease of access
and moved off toward what radiation was left from the explosion.
	Worf fired eleven torpedoes in all to lure the creature
after the Xin.  The Xin ship had never regained full temporal 
motion and, to the Xin, the action seemed to move at well over
ten times it's normal rate.
	The energy leech sidled up to the Xin ship, 
investigating.  Then it began feeding, siphoning off all 
the Xin's energy.  
	The crystal surface became cracked and dull, the
soaring antennas crumbled away, interior lights dimming, 
as the Xin ship died.  Nothing the occupants did mattered.
The weakened hull ruptured as the energy leech disengaged
it's tentacles.  The Xin crewmembers were sucked out into
space, along with any equipment that was not tightly 
fastened down.  
	The Xin's bony carapaces helped to protect them from
exposure to the hard vacuum of space, but could not prevent 
the rupturing of their internal structures.  They bled from
joints and oozed crushed organs from orifices.
	Finally, the Xin ship disintegrated, it's molecules
joining the vast population of interstellar matter.
	Still hungry, the energy leech now turned on the 
Stardrive Section.  Worf launched more torpedoes, but the 
creature was not fooled this time.  It continued it's 
advance.
	"Lock on tractor beam, Geordi," Data ordered into
the intercom.
	"Tractor beam locked on.  The creature's leeching
our energy again, Data.  Better make this fast."
	"Affirmative, Lieutenant.  Ensign Gawron, plot course
two one six mark four seven," said Data, consulting a read out
on the arm of the command chair.
	"But that'll take us into the heart of Star 452M5,"
protested Gawron.
	"We will not be entering the star, but stopping 
just short of it, Ensign.  Engage course at Warp three."
	"Aye, sir.  Warp three," Chris replied dubiously.
	"Arrival at Star 452M5 in fifteen seconds," reported
Worf, from his station at the rear of the Bridge.
	"Drop out of Warp .1 seconds before entering the heart
of the star and release tractor beam," Data ordered.
	"Aye, sir.  Whatever you say."
	"Carefully, Ensign Gawron.  You must not overshoot,"
warned Data.
	"Dropping out of Warp...NOW.  Tractor beam disengaging."
Then with surprise, Gawron reported, "The creature is moving
away, toward the sun.  Distance 123 meters and falling, 100
meters...90...60...15...2...it has entered the sun.  No longer
reading any lifesigns."
	With what could have been sadness, Data ordered,
"Return to the Saucer and reconnect."  Then Data just sat
there, neither responding to his friends, nor noticing that
they were even there.



On the next EXCiiiiiTing episode of Q and A, the big finale...

Enjoy, and what do you really think?

	Finally, at long last, the book is done. (Actually, it was finished a
couple of weeks ago, but I'm  just finding the time to post the thing.)
Following this last chapter, in a seperate post, is an author's note (hushed
silence, but then what other kind of silence is there?) telling about various
things that some people (including me) found unclear.



		CHAPTER 16
Captain's Log, Supplemental:
	We have returned to our own time and Mister Data
assures me that the Xin ship has been destroyed and also 
that we have had no noticeable impact on our own past.  I
only hope that he is correct and that our interference has
not caused some difficulty that will come back to haunt us 
in the future.  
	As far as Commander LaForge's defeat of the Borg,
he reports that such a weapon is not now, nor ever has 
been physically possible.  I feel that Q planted the idea
in his head and then allowed the weapon to be implemented.
	Data and Worf have explained to me why they stole
the Stardrive Section, and I believe them, even if no one
except them has any memory of the events leading up to it.
I have also dropped all charges against Worf for refusing
to fire on the Klingon ships, citing as my reason that
he was displaced in time, and as such, may have reverted 
to the behavior of Klingons at that time.
	We are currently proceeding to Starbase 
Andreievitch for repairs and debriefing.

	Picard looked up from his computer terminal, feeling
a tingle at the base of his skull, as if he were being 
watched.
	"Come on out, Q.  I know you're here."
	"Indeed, Captain.  I'm everywhere," said Q, as he
appeared, now wearing the uniform of a Starfleet Fleet 
Admiral.  "You've done remarkably well, Jean-Luc, but 
remember, I can always come back." 
	"I think not, Q.  You see, the Borg know of you now.
They know of the Continuum and your powers.  They'll find a
way to adapt, Q.  Then they will come looking for you and 
maybe you will be absorbed into the Borg."
	Q, a look of terror on his face, pleaded, "No!  It
can't be true.  I don't look at all good in plastic and steel.
You've got to help me."
	"No, Q.  It is because of you that the Borg know of
us.  It seems fitting that they know of you for the same
reason."
	"Alright then, if you're not going to help, I'll just
have to have my fellow Q help me."
	"If they don't kick you out before you get a chance 
to explain it to them," Picard retorted ominously.
	"What do you know, Picard?  Now it's my turn to give
out bad news.  You remember that Borg ship at Wolf-359C.  
Well, it wasn't destroyed.  Heavily damaged, perhaps, but 
not destroyed.  It will be fully repaired in little more 
than a year, but don't think of warning anyone.  Your
memory is now blocked.  You have the knowledge but are
unable to give it to anyone in any form.  
	"Ariva derci, Jean-Luc."  Q vanished from sight.
	In 10-Forward, Geordi and Data were discussing their
experiences in the past.  
	"Now I understand some of the things Admiral McCoy 
said to me when he was aboard.  We were in orbit over Farpoint
Station, and he said that he had lobbied heavily for the 
construction of the Galaxy Class series of starships.  He 
also said that he had a vague memory of you and I, but did
not know from where."
	Geordi turned to look intently at Data, the subdued 
light glinting off his VISOR.  "You don't mean--"
	"Yes, Geordi, the amnesia program did not work.  Out
of all his shipmates, he is the only one who remembers us."
	"And he never said a word, keeping it to himself for
over eighty years.  Unbelievable," whispered Geordi, in awe.
	"I shall have to meet with him again and discuss our
experiences on the Enterprise and the," Data faltered, 
"Enterprise," he finished.
	Geordi turned back to his drink, thinking ahead to
the shore leave that they had once again been promised and
knowing that something would come up to keep them from 
getting it.
	And on Wolf-359C, the vague outline of a cube 
dragged itself free from the hardened rock encasing it.
It was by no means repaired yet, but a signal had been
received.  Another Borg ship was on it's way to Federation
space, and this ship wanted to be ready.
	A year, perhaps, was a good estimate.  After 79 years
of repairs, what was one more, when the heart of the 
Federation lay open to it?




	Well, there you have it...
Enjoy, and let me know what you think of the thing, now that it's finished...
P.S. E-mail me for any missing parts that you need.

	And finally...

				Appendix

			Author's Note: Explanations


	Some of you may be concerned about Worf's behavior, Re: Not attacking
the Klingons.  This behavioral change is not unprecedented in Star Trek and
is of the same form as Spock's abnormal behavior in "All Our Yesterdays," where
he reverts back to the behavior of Vulcans of that time period.  Klingons of 
the time period Worf and crew were in would not, in my opinion, fight against 
someone who they saw as doing their duty.

	McCoy's advocacy of the Galaxy class starships stems from his not
knowing what time period (stardate) the "Houdini" comes from.  He knew it was
really named the Enterprise and wanted to speed up development of it so that 
it could go back in time to destroy the Borg.  (See below.)  This is the reason
for the lack of an extensive testing program.  (Captain of the "Yamato," 
"Contagion.")

	The Borg were included in the book to put an extension on Khan, add
something about the effect of the Genesis wave, and fix something I found
hard to believe about "Best of Both Worlds Part II."  I did not think that
one Borg ship alone could defeat 40 Federation starships.  It made sense to me
that their was another Borg ship somewhere.  This ship, stranded for many years
on Wolf-359C, beamed Locutus aboard just as the other Borg ship was destroyed,
finished off the Federation fleet, and then headed for Earth.  By this time,
Khan's personality had been purged by the Borg.

	And that's all I wrote, but before I go, thanks to friends and family
members for their support, and to everyone who consented to appear in this 
work: Chris Gawron, Jill Aures, Maggie Harris, Dave Callari, Phyllis Rubino,
and any others I may have forgotten over the past year of writing.

	Hailing frequencies closed.  Live long and prosper, as we watch the
human adventure continue into the 3rd century and beyond.

	What's left to say...
	Time permitting, I'll start on a sequel soon...
The Borg in the Q continuum, Q as a Borg, what a concept...
Anyone got a good title? ("Q and A" is a bit lame, need something good for the
next book. #B-)
Enjoy...
