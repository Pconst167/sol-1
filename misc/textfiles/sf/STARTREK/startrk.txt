COMPILED BY   S * P * Y * K    . WITH SPECIAL THANKS TO GYM
QUIRK, WHO WE GOT THE IDEA AND MANY OF THE RULES FROM, AND TO
GENE RODDENBERRY, FATHER OF ALL TREKKIES.


Following in the tradition of all true trekkies, we will now
lay out the designs for the Star Trek Drinking Game.  And
don't forget, Phaser`s on KILL, Mr.  Sulu...

(Make sure you`re using something POTENT!!!)

And take one drink every time someone says...

     ..."Bridge."

     ..."Ah`m sorry, captain, that's all the power she`s
         got!"

     ..."Phasers on stun"

     ..."Ahead warp factor 4" (or one drink per warp factor)

     ..."Highly illogical, Captain."

     ..."Standard orbit, sir."

     ..."Captain's Log..." (Twice if it's a supplemental)

     ..."He's dead, Jim" (This is the one that kills!)

     ..."This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship
        Enterprise"

     ..."Fascinating!"

     ..."Energize."

.."Weapon Systems/Shields inoperative, Captain."

     ..."Sensor indicate ________."

     ..."Tricorder readings, Mr. Spock?"

Also take one drink every time...

     ...Spock raises one eyebrow

     ...The camera tilts at a crazy angle and everyone falls
       out of their seats.

     ...The captain calls Dr. McCoy 'Bones'."

     ...The bosun's whistle sounds.

     ...A direct order is disobeyed.

     ...You see a styrofoam planet.

     ...Kirk kisses someone.

     ...Sulu does a countdown.
        (Optional 1: Drink once per number)
        (Optional 2: Use time for a breather)

     ...Kirk gets his shirt forcibly removed.

     ...Kirk destroys a computer.

     ...There's a fist fight.
        (Optional 1: One drink per person in fight."
        (Optional 2: One drink per PUNCH in fight."

     ...Uhura looks knowledgable and hold her earpiece.

     ...Spock relays data from his "peep-show" machine.

     ...A landing party arrives at a planet`s surface.
        (Optional 1: One drink per party member.)
        (Optional 2: One drink per styrofoam rock you see.)

     ...Something smokes, sparks, and explodes.

     ...Number 4 shield is damaged.
        (Optional: One drink for each shield #.
         i.e. #3 shield - Three drinks, etc.)

     ...Any time there is a reference to logic.
        (Optional: Twice if it's not from Spock.)

     ...The Enterprise is scanned by an 'omnipotent' force.
