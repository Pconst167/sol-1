Star Trek: The Next Generation
Speculative Chronology Version 1.4
by Scott Hollifield
Last modified on 10/1/93

NOTES: This chronology was written with the full account of information
presented in the series and in _Star Trek Chronology: The History of the
Future_, by Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda.  Any exceptions will be
limited to instances where the original information appears to be
mistaken; such instances will be noted in the footnotes.

Information that appears in [brackets] is generally NON-canon, and is
presented in the spirit of fictional elaboration, to "fill in the gaps"
as it were.  Much of it is in fact based at least partly on trivia from
the series or Okuda chronology; other information was created
independently.  The intent here was to provide the characters and their
world with a more of a fully-developed history than the one we have now.

Some information given here has been established by the series, but the
year in which it happened as not been officially established.  Such
information also appears in [brackets].

This is a "living" chronology in that it can always be added to, or
modified.  If you have any suggestions or corrections for future
updates, feel free to send them my way at:
scott.hollifield@the-matrix.com.

Footnotes are indicated with a karat and parentheses, i.e. (^1), (^2),
etc.

With one exception, this chronology does not include information about
the characters of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.  A DS9-inclusive revision
is planned once the episodes "Homecoming", "The Circle" and "The Siege"
have aired, and implications arising from the events in those episodes
are made clear.


2293    The crew of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A) is ordered to stand
down.

2299    [The construction of a new Excelsior-class Enterprise,
NCC-1701-B, is complete at the Antares shipyards and is
commissioned.  Her first commanding officer is Captain Spock.]

2301    [Amanda Grayson dies at the age of 93.  Her son, Captain Spock,
relinquishes command of the Enterprise, and resigns from active
duty, spending the next several years living alone on Vulcan.]

[Captain Vincent Cabot takes over command of the Enterprise.  He
proceeds to lead her on an expansive tour of exploration
which rivals that of the original Enterprise.]

2302    [Dr. Leonard H. McCoy is promoted to the rank of admiral and is
appointed to the position of Surgeon-General of Starfleet.]

2305    Jean-Luc Picard is born to Maurice and Yvette Picard in LaBarre,
France, on Earth.

2307    [The Enterprise-B begins an eighteen-month survey of the
uncharted space beyond the Gourami sector, resulting in six
successful first contacts with intelligent civilizations.]

2315    [Katherine Pulaski is born to Richard and Uriel Pulaski in Saint
John's, Newfoundland, on Earth.]

2311    The Tomed incident occurs.  [The Romulan Empire stumbles upon a
devastating new application in cloaking technology, which is
used initially to "cloak away" enemy ships to a parallel
dimension, but begins to inexplicably destroy lifeforms in the
vicinity, Romulan and otherwise.  A mad Romulan praetor embarks
on a campaign of attempted genocide by using the new weapon
against Federation outposts and ships in the Tomed sector,
along the Federation edge of the Neutral Zone, despite evidence
that the weapon's power is supplied by an uncontrollable alien
force. This results in a brief but bloody skirmish in which
thousands of lives are lost on both sides.  Most of the crew of
the ravaged USS Enterprise, including Captain Cabot, are
included among the casualties.  The conflict comes to an end
when the praetor's power is wrested by saner internal factions
on Romulus, and the praetor himself executed.  The new Romulan
leadership vows an isolationist policy toward the Federation
which lasts for 53 years.]

2322    Jean-Luc Picard applies to Starfleet Academy, but is rejected.
However, his admission test score is sufficient to allow him to
reapply the following year.

[Cyberneticist Dr. Noonian Soong drops out of the public eye and
secretly relocates to the colony on Omicron Theta Four.  He
continues to submit and publish articles in cybernetics
journals, as he progresses with his work on the positronic
artificial brain.]

2323    Jean-Luc Picard enters Starfleet Academy on his second
application.  The superintendent of the Academy is a full
Betazoid.  As a freshman cadet, Picard passes four upperclassmen
on the last hill of the 40-kilometer run on Danula Two, becoming
the only freshman ever to win the Academy marathon.  One of
Picard's interests is archaeology, and he studies the legendary
Iconians.

2324    Beverly C[heryl] Howard, the future Beverly Crusher, is born in
Copernicus City, Luna, to Paul and Isabel Howard.

2325    [Jean-Luc Picard's interest in archaeology is nurtured by
Professor Galen, the Academy's chair of archaelogical science.
The two form a close academic relationship.]

2326    [Lwaxana Troi, of Betazed, marries an human Starfleet Officer,
Ian Andrew "Alex" Alexander.  Alexander assumes Lwaxana's
surname when married, and is thereafter known as Alex Troi.
(^1)]

2327    Jean-Luc Picard graduates from Starfleet Academy.  He is class
valedictorian.  He spends a portion of the remainder of the
year on Farspace Station Earheart, awaiting assignment.  While
here, he is injured in a brawl with three Nausicaans which
requires him to undergo an artificial heart operation.  [By the
end of the year, he is assigned to be a helm officer on the USS
Yukawa.]

[Ambassador Sarek of Vulcan takes a second human wife, Perrin
Duvall of Earth.  The ceremony is held privately on Vulcan.]

2328    [The Cardassian Union] (^2) begins their occupation of the
Bajoran homeworld.

[Leah Brahms is born to Warren and Zoe Brahms on the Federation
colony world of Raitlae Two.]

[Jean-Luc Picard transfers to the USS Lemnitzer and is promoted
to the rank of lieutenant (j.g.).]

2329    [Lt. Picard attends the wedding of Ambassador Spock on Vulcan,
as a member of the Starfleet Diplomatic Corps honor guard.
Later in the year, he is promoted to full lieutenant.]

[While approving of his son's choice of wife, Sarek reacts
coldly to the marriage itself, believing it to be an attempt by
Spock to upstage Sarek's own recent wedding.  As an indirect
result of the disagreement, Spock emerges from retirement and
joins the diplomatic service.]

2332    [Cmdr. Picard transfers to the Stargazer, where he serves as
First Officer under Capt. Keel.  While on the Stargazer, he
becomes good friends with both Keel and an officer named Jack
Crusher.]

2333    Jean-Luc Picard [is promoted to the rank of captain and] assumes
command of the Stargazer, embarking on a historic mission of

ever to captain a starship.  [He replaces Captain Keel, who
takes time off from starship duty to teach classes at the
Academy.]

[Katherine Pulaski enrolls in Starfleet Academy medical school.]

[Vash is born on Saris One, a pre-Federation human colony.]

[A new line of starships, the Ambassador class, is initiated
with the commissioning of a new Enterprise (NCC-1701-C), on the
the 100th anniversary of James T. Kirk's birth, at Earth Station
McKinley.  The Ambassador class is intended primarily to be a
starship of diplomacy rather than exploration, although the
Enterprise-C and her crew become accomplished in both.
Ambassador Spock and his wife are present at the commissioning
ceremony.  The Enterprise is given over to the command of
Captain Rachel Garrett, who has just completed a successful
five-year mission on the Nebula-class USS Yamato.]  (^4)

[Starfleet creates the office of Ship's Counselor to accomodate
the needs of the crew on mass-personnel ships like the new
Ambassador-class line.  This position relieves the psychology-
related duties of the Chief Medical Officer, and will become
even more important when the Galaxy-class program, designed to
include accomodations for entire families, becomes active 24
years later.]

2334    [Yuri Sergeyovich Rozhenko is born to Sergey and Helena Rozhenko
in Babruysk, Byelorussia, on Earth.  He is their only human

2336    Deanna Troi is born on Betazed.  She is the child of Lwaxana
Troi and Starfleet officer [Alex] Troi.

The science colony in Omicron Theta [Four] is destroyed by what
is later known as the Crystalline Entity.  All life-forms on the
planet are absorbed or destroyed by the Entity, apparently aided
by the errant android Lore.  Scientist Noonian Soong, who had
constructed a second android, Data, manages to record the
memories of all the colonists in the new android.  Soong
conceals the still-dormant Data in an underground location, then
escapes from Omicron Theta, although it is believed at the time
that Soong was among the casualties at the colony.

2336    [Sergey Rozhenko joins the crew of the USS Intrepid as a warp
field specialist.]

2340    Worf is born on the Klingon homeworld of Qo'noS, the son of Mogh
[and Mura].

Ro Laren is born on Bajor [to Ro Seval and Dirla Farys].

Geordi La Forge, aged five, is caught in a fire.  His parents
rescue him after a couple of minutes.  Although he was not hurt,
Geordi would later recall that these were the longest couple of
minutes of his life, and that it was some time before he would
allow his parents out of earshot.

[Sixteen-year-old Beverly Howard moves back to Earth following
the death of her grandmother.]

2341    Data enters Starfleet Academy.  The Academy had ruled that Data
is a sentient life-form and thus was eligible for consideration
for entry, a decision objected to by [Lt.] Bruce Maddox. (^5)

[Katherine Pulaski graduates with a medical degree from
Starfleet Academy.  Her first assignment is as a medical officer
for a deep space exploration mission on the USS Chamberlain.]

[Five-year-old Deanna Troi is "bonded" with an Earth boy, Wyatt
Miller.]

2342    Ishara Yar, younger sister of Tasha Yar, is born on Turkana Four.

Tasha Yar, aged five, is orphaned when her parents are killed by
crossfire between rival gangs.  She is left to care for her
younger sister, Ishara.

development project.

[First contact is made with the Pakleds, a race of technology-
scavengers who do not have a regulated government of any real
kind.  The contact, between the Pakled vessel Rangar and the USS
Rayleigh, begins well, as the Pakleds seem intent on being
"friends" with the Rayleigh's crew, but ends on a sour note
following an unsuccessful attempt on the Pakleds' part to steal
replicator technology from the Starfleet vessel.]

Geordi La Forge, aged eight, gets his first pet, a Circassian
cat.

2344    The USS Enterprise (NCC 1701-C), under the command of Captain
Rachel Garrett, is nearly destroyed defending a Klingon
outpost on Narendra Three from a Romulan attack.  A few members
of the Enterprise crew are reported to have been captured by
the Romulans following the battle.  One of them, a 29-year-old
Natasha Yar from an alternate future, is chosen as a consort
by a Romulan official.

Lt. Riker was part of an USS Potemkin away team on Nervala
Four when, unbeknownst to anyone, a transporter fluke created
a duplicate of Riker who remained on the planet while the
original left with the Potemkin.

[Riker is given a promotion to lieutenant commander and decides
to stay on the Potemkin instead of meeting Deanna.  He later
transfers to the USS Hood, where he serves as Capt. DeSoto's
first officer for a year and a half.]

Tau Alpha C.  He takes on the Traveller as his assistant, which
enables him to advance his work in warp propulsion
significantly.]

[Lt. Data gets the opportunity to observe a wormhole while
serving on the Trieste.  It is, in fact, the first unipolar
wormhole (i.e. with one stable pole, or end) discovered by
the Federation.]

2363    Ens. Geordi La Forge is a member of the Victory away team, led
by Lt. Susanna Leijten, investigating the disappearance of
49 persons at the colony on Tarchannan Three.  Five years later,
all five members of this away team are mysteriously compelled to
return to the same planet.  (^10)

[At the age of 26, Tryla Scott becomes the youngest Starfleet
officer in history to attain the rank of captain, due in part
to both early admission to and early graduation from the
Academy.  She is given command of the USS Renegade.]

40759.5. (^11)

[Ambassador Spock speaks publicly in favor of peace talks with
Cardassia.  His father disapproves of the open airing of Spock's
opinions, believing Spock to be motivated by disrepect of
Sarek's more moderate position.  The dispute proves to be the
final one between father and son, and Sarek breaks off all
communication with Spock.]

2364    Cmdr. Will Riker (^12) is offered the opportunity to command the
USS Drake but declines the assignment in order to serve on the

Cardassian Union is signed.

2368    Ro Laren is released early from prison by Admiral Kennelley, and

crucial diplomatic mission invoving Bajoran terrorists.  Picard
requests a stay of duty for her on the Enterprise.

The Cardassian occupational forces on Bajor are finally driven
off by the Bajoran resistance.  Though chaotic and unstable,
a new Bajoran government is installed on the planet.  (^13)

begins administration of an orbiting station around Bajor,
which the Federation rename Deep Space Nine.  It is commanded
by Commander Benjamin Sisko.

FOOTNOTES:

(^1)    This explains why we've been given two seemingly conflicting
names for Deanna Troi's father, Ian Andrew ("The Child") and
Alex ("Conundrum").

(^2)    The Okuda chronology refers to the "Cardassian Empire", but in
"Chain of Command", the actual Cardassian soveriegn entity is
referred to as the Cardassian Union.

(^3)    Picard's highly accelerated rate of promotion is made necessary
by the established fact that he made captain at the age of 28,
six years after graduating from the Academy.

(^4)    There have been six ships to bear the name Yamato in Starfleet
history to date; the sixth, NCC-1305-E, was the Galaxy-class
sister ship to the Enterprise-D.  Its predecessor, the Nebula-
class NCC-1305-D, is the Yamato referred to here.

(^5)    Bruce Maddox is a commander in "The Measure of a Man", but since
the hearings at which he was present for the question of Data's
sentience happened over twenty years earlier, Maddox was
undoubtedly of lower rank.

(^6)    Graduates of the eight-year medical program at Starfleet Academy
typically emerge with a rank of lieutenant (j.g.) at the time of
graduation.

(^7)    The Okuda chronology specifies that "one of" Geordi's "first
assignments is aboard the USS Victory", but there's no evidence
that the Victory was one of his first postings.  In fact,
evidence seems to point toward the Victory as being Geordi's
*last* ship before the Enterprise.

(^8)    If Worf's human foster brother traveled with his parents, which
is a safe assumption, then his home would be on Earth, not
Gault.  The show specifies neither.

(^9)    This explains why Troi was a "psychology student" when she met
Riker, as established in "Menage a Troi".  Without further
information, this knowledge alone would seem to suggest that
she had not yet entered Starfleet; yet, given the continuity
from "Second Chances", Troi would have had to enter the
Academy at an unusually late age, and undergone an unusually
rapid level of promotion, under those circumstances.  Ocaam's
Razor prevails in this chronology.

(^10)   The Okuda chronology places this event in 2362 instead of 2363.
This is incorrect if one goes by the Okuda's chronology's
assumption that the beginning of each season (41000.0, 42000.0,
etc.) coincides with the beginning of a calendar year.  The
justification for the Okuda date is Susanna Leijten's remark
that the original Tarchannan mission took place five years
prior, when it would have been four years going by the "1000
stardates=1 year" system.

(^11)   The pre-"Farpoint" Enterprise mission to Carnel, where Picard
meets Tasha for the first time ("Legacy"), is regarded as
out-of-continuity for the purposes for this chronology, even
though the Okudas regard it as canon.  Such an assumption
would require the Enterprise to have gone on a mission before
Riker, LaForge and the Crushers came aboard.  This chronology
works with the premise that "Farpoint" was the Enterprise's
first mission.

(^12)   "The Icarus Factor" establishes that Riker was a lieutenant
commander when approached by Picard to be a first officer on
the Enterprise.  Presumably, some time passed between Picard's
offer and Riker's final transfer to the Enterprise, during
which he was both promoted to commander and also offered the
command of the Drake.

(^13)   This date is largely conjectural.  It is established that the
Federation presence at Bajor (at the beginning of Star Trek:
Deep Space Nine) is put into place shortly after the Bajorans
regain power on the planet; it stands to reason that the
provisional government would have to be present at least six
months or so before the Federation would feel it prudent to
install representation.  This would place the overthrow of
the Cardassians in the previous calendar year, 2368.
