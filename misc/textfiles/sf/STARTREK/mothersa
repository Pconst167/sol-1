This is a reposting of my story from a couple weeks ago.  I removed a lot of
extra spaces and stuff, so this is a lot shorter.
	I got this idea last winter while daydreaming rather than paying
attention in class.  Anyway, it's a Next Generation story concentrating
on Troi.  I'd appreciate any comments or suggestions:)  (no flames
please).  Please e-mail me at jlp7831@ultb.rit.edu.  Thanks and enjoy!

	INT. HOLODECK



	RIKER enters the holodeck.  PICARD and DR. CRUSHER are
	already there, clad in 1940's apparel.


				RIKER

		Sorry I'm late.



				PICARD

		Are you ready for the adventure
		of a lifetime.

	
				RIKER

		I certainly hope so.



				DR. CRUSHER

		Where's Deanna?



				PICARD

		I don't know.



				RIKER

		It's not like her to be late.
		Picard taps his communicator.



				PICARD

		Picard to Counselor Troi.
		There is no response.



				PICARD
			(continuing)
		Picard to Counselor Troi.


	INT.  COUNSELOR TROI'S QUARTERS

	Troi is crouched against the wall next to her bed,
	hugging her knees.  There are flames all around her.
	Debris from the fire falls from the ceiling.



				TROI

		Captain!  Help!  The fire's
		everywhere!


	A large panal falls from the ceiling.  Troi lets out 
	a startled SCREAM.

	INT. HOLODECK

				RIKER
		What fire?  Why hasn't the ship's
		censors detected it and put it out?


				TROI (o.s)
		I don't know.


	Troi begins to cough uncontrollably.


				TROI
			(continuing)
		Please help.


				PICARD
		We're on our way.  Picard out.
		Picard to LaForge.


				LaFORGE (o.s)
		Go ahead Captain.


				PICARD
		Counselor Troi's quarters are on
		fire.  I want you and Mr. Data
		to go to engineering and check the
		sprinkler systems for any malfunctions.


				LaFORGE (o.s)
		Aye Captain.


	Everyone exits the room.


	INT. COUNSELOR TROI'S QUARTERS

	The door slides open as Dr. Crusher, Riker, and Picard rush 
	inside.  The room appears perfectly normal.  They begin to 
	look for Troi.


				RIKER
		Deanna?


	INT. TROI'S BEDROOM

	Troi looks very dishevelled as she sits against the 
	wall.


				TROI
		Wil?


	She COUGHS loudly.  Riker walks over to the bedroom door 
	and peers in.  Dr. Crusher starts to walk across the room 
	when Troi suddenly becomes agitated.


				TROI
		Beverly, no!


				DR. CRUSHER
		Deanna, what is it?


				TROI
			(coughing)
		The panel it's about to fall.


	Riker and Picard look around the room.  Dr. Crusher 
	continues to look directly at Troi.  To their eyes, 
	everything appears normal.


				DR. CRUSHER
		What panel?  Deanna, to all of us,
		this room appears completely normal.


	Dr. Crusher walks over to Troi and kneels beside her.  She 
	removes her tricorder from her pocket and quickly moves it 
	around Troi as she has another coughing spasm.  Riker 
	walks over and kneels beside her.


				RIKER
		Deanna, what's going on?


	Troi looks up at Riker.  Through her eyes, the room is 
	full of thick black smoke.  Everything is on fire and 
	debris falls from the ceiling.  Terrified, Troi places
	a shaky hand on Riker's arm.


				TROI
			(coughing)
		I see flames all around me.  The smoke
		is so thick, I can barely breath.
		Please help me.  I don't know what's
		happening.


	Troi begins to cough uncontrollably.  Riker puts his 
	arms around her to stop her shaking.


				RIKER
		Doctor, is there anything you
		can do?


	Dr. Crusher sits back on her heels as she places the 
	tricorder in her pocket.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Amazing.


				PICARD
		What have you found?


	Dr. Crusher removes a syringe from her other pocket and 
	places it at the base of Troi's neck.  After giving her 
	a shot, she places the syringe back in her pocket.  
	She puts a hand on Troi's shoulder.


				DR. CRUSHER
		That should help the coughing.


	Dr. Crusher stands up and looks at Picard.


				DR. CRUSHER
			(continuing)
		Though there is clearly no fire
		in here, Troi has massive amounts
		of smoke in her lungs.


				RIKER
		How is that possible?


				DR. CRUSHER
		I don't know.  The shot I gave her
		should eliminate the smoke.


	Troi begins to cough uncontrollably again.  Riker again 
	tries to stop her shaking by holding her.  Troi's coughs 
	turn into choking sounds as she gasps for air.	Dr. Crusher
	kneels back down beside her.  Troi suddenly	passes out.
	Dr. Crusher runs her tricorder around Troi.


				DR. CRUSHER
		This is bizarre.


				RIKER
		What?


	Dr. Crusher removes the syringe from her pocket again 
	and gives Troi another shot.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Her lungs are full of smoke again.


	After a moment, Troi regains consciousness.  She blinks 
	as she tries to clear her head.  She sits up straight 
	and looks around the room.


				DR. CRUSHER
			(continuing)
		How do you feel?


	Troi begins to stand up.  Riker jumps to his feet and 
	helps her up.


				TROI
		Aside from a slight headache,
		I feel fine.


				PICARD
		Counselor, just a moment ago,
		you were afraid of the fire
		that was in this room.  Do you
		still see flames?


				TROI
		No.  (pause)  Captain, I know
		you must think I've gone insane,
		but five minutes ago this room
		was on fire.


	Picard and Riker look at each other.  LaForge enters
	the room.


				LaFORGE
		Captain, what's going on here?
		Data and I checked everything.
		There is nothing wrong with any
		of the sprinkler systems.


	Troi sighs as she walks over to her bed and sits down.  
	She drops her head into her hands.


				TROI
		Maybe I am losing my mind.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Everything you think you saw did
		exist in your mind.


				PICARD
		I'd like to see everyone in my
		ready room.
			(beat)
		I'm going to go change into something
		a little less casual.


	Dr. Crusher looks at Picard, and then at her own clothes.


				DR. CRUSHER
		I almost forgot.


	Everyone begins to leave the room.


				TROI
		I'll be there in a minute.


	Troi stands up and walks over to a window.  Riker walks
	over and stands behind her.  He gently places his hand on
	her shoulder.


				RIKER
		Do you want me to wait for you?


	Troi hesitates before she answers.


				TROI
		No, I'll be fine.  I just want
		to freshen up a little.


	Riker walks towards the door.


				RIKER
		If you need anything, just holler.


	Troi weakly smiles to herself.  Riker leaves the room.


	INT.  READY ROOM

	Picard sits at the head of the table with Riker to his 
	left, Dr. Crusher to his right, and Geordi and Data across 
	from him.  Troi suddenly walks in and sits down.


				PICARD
		Counselor, can you tell us exactly
		what happened.


				TROI
		I got up for this morning's meeting.
		I got dressed, made myself a cup of
		hot chocolate, then put the mug down on
		my night table.  I turned around and the
		whole room was in flames.  I thought it
		was kind of odd for this fire to suddenly
		appear, but when I tried to leave the room,
		I got burned.  Then I started to choke from
		the smoke.  I was about to ask the computer
		why it hadn't put the fire out when you
		contacted me.


				PICARD
		Hmm.  Perhaps it was something you
		ate or drank.  Mr. LaForge, run a
		level one diagnostic on the counselor's
		replicator.


				LaFORGE
		I'll get right on it.


				PICARD
		Doctor, have there been any other
		similar incidents reported?


				DR. CRUSHER
		No, not to my knowledge.


				LaFORGE
		It is possible that it's an isolated
		problem in the counselor's replicator.


				RIKER
		Could anything else be causing this?


				DR. CRUSHER
		I have an idea, but it's too
		early to speculate.


				LaFORGE
		Counselor, are you just seeing things
		or are they actually real?


				TROI
		They seem real.  I know that panel I
		touched was certainly hotter then it
		should have been.


				DR. CRUSHER
		And the smoke that you inhaled was
		certainly real.  That's what worries
		me.  It's one thing to have hallucinations,
		but it's another thing entirely when
		those hallucinations try to kill you.


				PICARD
		Counselor, has this ever happened
		to you before?


				TROI
		No, never.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Troi, I'd like to see you in sickbay
		to run some tests on you.


				TROI
		Alright.


				PICARD
		Until we figure out exactly what is
		going on, I think we should all keep
		an eye out on the counselor and also
		for any other similar reports.


				RIKER
		I agree.  There's no telling
		what else could crop up.


				PICARD
		Are there any questions?


	There is no answer.


				PICARD
			(continuing)
		Dismissed.


	Everyone stands up and walks to the door.

jlp7831@ultb.isc.rit.edu

	INT. SICKBAY

	Dr. Crusher and Troi enter sickbay together.  Troi walks
	over to an examining table and sits down.  Dr. Crusher
	picks up her tricorder and another small instrument.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Do you have any idea why this is
		happening to you?


				TROI
		No.  None at all.


	Dr. Crusher takes the small instrument and moves it around
	Troi's head.  She then presses some buttons on the tricorder.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Hmm.  There's a lot of neural
		activity in your solar cortex.
		(beat)  I wander...


				TROI
		What?


				DR. CRUSHER
		Have you been able to converse with
		people telepathically?


				TROI
		No, I've never been able to.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Well what about right now.  Can you
		read my mind?


	Troi closes her eyes.  She concentrates for a minute or
	two before opening her eyes again.


				TROI
		Nothing.  Beverly, what is this all
		about?


	Dr. Crusher walks over to a table and places her 
	instruments down.


				DR. CRUSHER
		I just had an idea of what might be
		going on, but it was just a hunch.


	Dr. Crusher walks back over to Troi.


				DR. CRUSHER
			(continuing)
		There is nothing wrong with you.
		I can't figure out what could be
		causing this.


	Troi smiles.


				TROI
		That's alright.  I trust you.  I
		know you'll figure it out.


	Troi hops off the examining table.


				DR. CRUSHER
		I think you should take it easy for
		the next couple of days.


				TROI
		I think you're right.  I am exhausted.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Why don't you go back to your quarters
		and rest.  I'll check in on you in a
		couple of hours to make sure you're
		alright.


				TROI
		Sounds like a good idea.


	Troi walks towards the door.


				TROI
			(continuing)
		I'll see you later.


	Troi leaves the room.


	INT. TROI'S QUARTERS


	Troi walks over to the replicator.


				TROI
		Hot chocolate...never mind.


	She walks into her bedroom when the doorbell rings.  She
	walks back into the livingroom.


				TROI
		Come in.


	The door slides open and LaForge and Data walk in the room.


				LaFORGE
		Sorry to disturb you counselor,
		but the Captain wants us to check
		your replicator for any malfunctions.


				TROI
		Go right ahead.


	Geordi and Data walk over to the replicator and remove its
	front panel.  Troi yawns.


				TROI
			(continuing)
		If you two don't mind, I'm going
		to take a nap.


				LaFORGE
		Alright, we'll try not to disturb you.


	Troi walks into her bedroom and lies down.  Geordi and
	Data examine the replicator.  They speak in hushed voices.


				DATA
		Counselor Troi said she had hot
		chocolate this morning.  Perhaps
		that specific drink caused her
		illusions.


				LaFORGE
		It's possible.  There's one way
		to find out.  (beat)  Computer,
		hot chocolate.


	The replicator whirs for a moment before producing a
	mug of hot chocolate.  Geordi picks it up and smells
	it.


				LaFORGE
		Smells alright.


				DATA
		May I see it?


				LaFORGE
		Sure.


	He hands the mug to Data who smells it.  He then fills
	an eye dropper with the liquid and places a small drop
	on a pad on his tricorder.


				LaFORGE
		Well, what does it say?


				DATA
		It says it is made of coco beans,
		milk, sugar...


				LaFORGE
		I know what's in it.  Does it
		say what might be causing the
		counselor's illness?


				DATA
		No, it does not.


				LaFORGE
		Well I ran a level one diagnostic
		on the replicator and came up with
		nothing.


				DATA
		Perhaps it is not the replicator
		that is causing the counselor's
		hallucinations.


				LaFORGE
		Yeah, that's what I'm beginning
		to think, too.


	Geordi puts his tools back in their box.


				LaFORGE
		Come on, let's go tell the captain
		what we found.


	They stand up and leave the room.


	INT. CORRIDOR


	LaForge and Data walk down the corridor.


				LaFORGE
		Do you have any idea what could be
		wrong with the counselor?


				DATA
		Is it not common among Betazoids to
		experience similar symptoms as the
		counselor when a loved one dies?


				LaFORGE
		Hmm.  I've heard of that happening
		before, but only on rare occasions.


	They stop in front of the turbo lift.  The door opens
	as the two enter.


	INT. TURBO LIFT

				LaFORG
		Bridge.


				DATA
		Yes, but it is possible.


				LaFORGE
		But you're forgetting Troi's
		only half Betazoid.  If she
		were fully telepathic maybe.


				DATA
		Yes, but still it is possible.


	The turbo lift slows to a complete stop.  The door slides
	open and Geordi and Data enter the bridge.


	INT. TROI'S BEDROOM


	Troi awakes and sits up in bed.  She grabs a robe and 
	puts it on.  She then stands up and walks into the 
	other room.


	INT. TROI'S LIVING ROOM


	Troi picks up a computer date book.  She looks at it for
	a moment before dropping it back down on the table.  She
	looks around her room, then walks over to the window and
	stares out at the stars.  Smoke softly billows into the
	room from under the doors.  Troi continues to look out the
	window.


				LWAXANA (o.s)
		Little one.  Help me.  I'm dying.


	Still looking out the window, Troi speaks to her mother 
	telepathically.


				TROI
		Mother?  Where are you?  What's
		happening?


				LWAXANA (o.s)
		The consulate is on fire.  I've
		been trapped in here for over
		an hour.


	The smoke continues to fill the room.


				TROI
		Why hasn't the fire been put
		out yet?


				LWAXANA (o.s)
		I don't know.  (pause)  Little
		One...I'm scared.


				TROI
		It'll be alright.  I'm sure they're
		trying to put the fire out.


	Silence.


				TROI
			(continuing)
		Mother?  Mother?


	Troi turns around and sees the room filled with smoke.  She
	starts to walk forward and immediately begins to cough.  
	She takes a few steps and stumbles, falling to the ground 
	and passing out.


	INT. SICKBAY

	Dr. Crusher pulls up her chair and sits down.  She 
	types something in the computer and begins to examine 
	some records.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Interesting.


	INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE TROI'S QUARTERS

	Dr. Crusher rings the doorbell.  There is no answer.  
	She rings it again.  No answer.  She touches her 
	communicator.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Crusher to Troi.


	No answer.


				DR. CRUSHER
			(continuing)
		Computer, where is Counselor Troi?


				COMPUTER
		Counselor Troi is in her quarters


				DR. CRUSHER
		Crusher to Security.  Emergency
		enterance to Counselor Troi's
		quarters.


	The door suddenly opens.  Dr. Crusher rushes inside.
 

	INT. TROI'S QUARTERS

	Troi is unconscious on the floor.  Dr. Crusher kneels 
	beside her and checks for a pulse, then taps her 
	communicator.


				DR. CRUSHER
			(continuing)
		Crusher to Transporter Room 3.
		Two to beam directly to sick
		bay.


	A moment later, Dr. Crusher and Troi begin to fade 
	away.


	INT. BRIDGE

	Picard and Riker sit in their chairs.  Data and Geordi
	walkover to them.


				PICARD
		Did you find anything?


				LaFORGE
		No sir.  The counselor's replicator
		is fine.


				PICARD
		That means something else is
		causing this.


				RIKER
		Do you have any ideas what it
		might be?


				PICARD
		No, I don't, but let's hope the
		good doctor does.


	Picard taps his communicator.


				PICARD
			(continuing)
		Picard to Dr. Crusher.


				DR. CRUSHER (o.s)
		I'm a little busy captain.


				PICARD
		The counselor?


				DR. CRUSHER (o.s)
		Very unconscious.


				PICARD
		We're on our way.


	Picard and Riker run towards the turbo lift.


				PICARD
			(continuing)
		Mr. Data, you have the bridge.


				DATA
		Aye, Captain.


	Data sits down in the Captain's chair.


	INT. SICKBAY


	Dr. Crusher moves the tricorder around Troi's body.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Damn!  It's the same thing as
		before.


	Dr. Crusher runs over to a cabinet and picks up a 
	syringe.  She gives Troi an injection in her neck.  She 
	moves the tricorder around Troi again.  After a minute,
	Troi slowly begins to regain consciousness.


				DR. CRUSHER
		How do you feel?


				TROI
		More scared and helpless then I've
		ever felt before.


	Tears begin to well in Troi's eyes.


				TROI
			(continuing)
		I know what's causing this to happen.


	INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OF SICKBAY


	Picard and Riker stop in front of the door to sickbay.
	The door quickly opens as they enter into the other room.

	INT. SICKBAY

	Picard and Riker walk over to where Troi is lying.  Troi
	turns to face them.


				RIKER
		How do you feel?


				TROI
		Tired...and scared.


	Dr. Crusher looks at Riker.


				Dr. Crusher
		Well, we know what the problem is.
		We just don't know if there's a cure.


				PICARD
		You know what's causing this?


				DR. CRUSHER
		Yes.  I had an idea, but actually,
		it was Troi who confirmed it after
		she regained consciousness.


				RIKER
		Well, what is it?


	Dr. Crusher looks down at Troi.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Do you want me to explain it, or
		do you want to?


				TROI
			(weakly)
		Why don't you.  I'm still a little
		tired.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Basically, Troi has established
		some kind of link with another
		Betazoid who is in either grave
		danger or who is actually dying.
		She is experiencing events as that
		other person experiences them.


				RIKER
		Do you know who she has established
		this link with?


	Dr. Crusher does not answer.  She slowly looks at Troi.
	Troi hasitates before slowly answering.


				TROI
		My mother.


	Riker looks at Picard who has a shocked look on his face.


				PICARD
		Have you tried to contact Lwaxana?


				DR. CRUSHER
		Yes.  We're too close to an asteroid
		belt.  We couldn't make a clear
		transmission.


	Picard pauses for a moment before he taps his communicator.


				PICARD
		Picard to bridge.


				DATA (o.s)
		Bridge here.


				PICARD
		Set a new course for Betazed.


				DATA (o.s)
		Aye Captain. 


	Troi sighs and looks up at the ceiling.  Riker places 
	his hand gently over Troi's.


				RIKER
		I'm sure everything will be fine.


	Troi looks at Riker.


				TROI
		She's scared Wil...and so am I.


	Riker smiles weakly.


				RIKER
		You'll both be fine.


				PICARD
		Doctor, is this common in Betazoids?


				DR. CRUSHER
		No, actually it isn't.  That's why
		I was hesitant to diagnose it.


				TROI
		Sometimes families are so close,
		they establish these links without
		even realizing it.


				RIKER
		Is there any way to break this link?


				TROI
		No.  I just have to let it take
		it's course.


				RIKER
		But if Lwaxana dies, what will
		happen to you?


	Troi turns her head away from Riker.


				TROI
		I will again experience everything
		she does.  This time it will be so
		intense that I will go into a coma.
		The coma will only last a day or
		two, then I'll wake up and everything
		will be back to normal.


	Everyone is silent for a moment.  Picard steps next to 
	Troi and places his hand over hers.


				PICARD
		Counselor, I'm sure your mother
		will be fine.  Lwaxana is a very
		strong woman.


	Troi looks at Picard with tears in her eyes.


				TROI
		Yes, but even she can't live forever.


	INT. BRIDGE

	Picard enters the bridge from the turbo lift.  Data stands 
	up and walks over to his computer.  Picard walks over to 
	his chair and sits down.


				PICARD
		Mr. Worf, how much time before we
		can contact Betazed?


				WORF
		Approximately thirty minutes, sir.


				PICARD
		Mr. Data, how long before we actually
		reach the planet?


	Data swivels around in his chair to face Picard.


				DATA
		At warp nine sir, it will take
		approximately two hours.


				PICARD
		Make it so.


				DATA
		Aye Captain.


	Data swivels in his seat again to face his control 
	panel.


	INT. SICKBAY

	Troi sits up in her bed.  She swings her feet off to 
	the side of the bed and tries to stand up.  Dr. Crusher 
	and Riker grab her before she is fully standing.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Where do you think you're going?


	Troi sits back down in her bed.


				TROI
		I have a lot of work to do.  Besides,
		I feel fine.


				DR. CRUSHER
		You may feel fine now, but who knows
		about ten minutes from now?


	Troi sighs.


				RIKER
		Dr. Crusher is right.  What if something
		else happens to you and no one's there
		to take care of you?


				TROI
		I appreciate your concern, but I'll
		be fine.


				DR. CRUSHER
		No you can't.  I think until this
		whole thing is over you should stay
		under observation.


	Troi sighs as she lies back down on the bed.  Dr. Crusher 
	walks over to a computer and begins typing.


				DR. CRUSHER
			(continuing)
		I'll be over here if you need me.


				RIKER
		And I'll be on the bridge.


	Riker leans over Troi as he brushes a stray hair from 
	her forehead.


				RIKER
			(continuing)
		I'm really worried about you.


				TROI
		I'll be fine.  It's my mother that
		I'm worried about.


				RIKER
		I just hope that both of you will
		be alright.  (beat)  I'll check
		on you later.


	Riker stands up and leaves the room.  Troi closes her eyes


	INT. BRIDGE

	Picard sits in his chair.  Worf stands behind him while 
	Data sits in front of him.


				DATA
		Captain, we are now far enough
		away from the asteroid belt to
		make a clear transmission to Betazed.


				PICARD
		Thank you Mr. Data.  Mr. Worf,
		would you hail the consulate?


				WORF
		Hailing frequency open.
			(pause)
		Do you want it on the main viewer,
		sir?


				PICARD
		Yes.


	Riker walks in and sits down next to Picard.  The main 
	viewer suddenly switches from its display of stars to a 
	worried TECHNICIAN.


				PICARD
			(continuing)
		This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
		of the Enterprise.  I have reason
		to believe Lwaxana Troi is in grave
		danger.  I was wandering if that
		were true?


				TECHNICIAN
		Ah, hold on.


	The Technician leans over and checks a computer off screan.
	After a moment, he leans back into frame.


				TECHNICIAN
			(continuing)
		Yeah, it is.


	Picard looks at Riker, then stands up.


				PICARD

		Is there anything we can do to
		help?


				TECHNICIAN
		No, evrything's fine, thanks.


				RIKER
		Then why isn't Ambassador Troi
		safe yet?


				TECHNICIAN
		Well, ah, we're doing the best we
		can.  The fire took out all of our
		main systems, so it's gonna take a
		little longer than usual.


				RIKER
		Can't you beam her out of there?


				TECHNICIAN
		No, ah, our transporter beams were
		damaged by the fire.  Our people
		are trying to fix them, though.


				RIKER
		Would it be alright if our people
		tried to beam the Ambassador out
		once we're in range?


	The technician shrugs.


				TECHNICIAN
		Sure, why not?


	Riker looks at Picard.  Picard takes a deep breath.


				PICARD
		How did this fire start?


				TECHNICIAN
		Ah, we're not sure.  We're looking
		into it.


				PICARD
		Perhaps it would be helpful then,
		if I did send some of my crew down
		to help.


				TECHNICIAN
		That's really not necessary sir.  As
		I said before, ah, we're already doing
		everything possible.  If we need any
		more help, we'll contact you.  Okay?


	Picard looks at Riker who rolls his eyes.


				PICARD
		That'll be fine.  But in the meantime,
		please contact us with any progress.


				TECHNICIAN
		Sure thing Capt'n.


				RIKER
		Is this your regular position?


				TECHNICIAN
		No sir, I'm the barber.  Hal is
		normally here, but he's helping
		with the fire.


				RIKER
		I see.  Well your doing a fine job.


				TECHNICIAN
		Thank you sir.


	Picard turns towards Worf and makes a cutting gesture.
	Worf nods and ends the transmission.  Picard turns to face Riker.


				PICARD
		The barber?


	Riker shrugs his shoulders, then sits down.  Picard looks at
	Worf for a moment, before returning to his seat.


	INT. SICKBAY


	Troi lies on the bed with her eyes closed.


				LWAXANA (o.s)
		Little One?  Are you there?


				TROI
			(without speaking)
		Yes Mother, I'm here.  How are you?


	INT. CONSULATE/ OFFICE - DAY

	Lwaxana sits on the floor under a desk.  Pieces of the
	ceiling hang down.  Heavy girders block the exits.  The
	flames cover the rear wall and portions of the ceiling.
	Lwaxana speaks telepathically.


				LWAXANA
		I could be better.  It's so damn hot
		in here.


				TROI (o.s)
		Is the fire out yet?


				LWAXANA
		No, not completely.  I can hear them
		working though.  I'm afraid they won't
		reach me in time.


				TROI (o.s)
		Don't say that Mother.  They'll be
		there soon.  Just hold on.


				LWAXANA
			(crying softly)
		I'm scared.  I just want to go home.
		I just want to see my Little One one
		last time.


				TROI (o.s)
		You will Mother.  You'll be fine,
		I promise.


	A ceiling beam falls in front of Lwaxana.  The flames 
	quickly climb up the beam, spreading to the ceiling.  
	Pieces of debris begin to fly around the room.

		Do not let this parting grieve thee
jlp7831@ultb.isc.rit.edu

	INT. SICKBAY


	Troi is covered in perspiration as she tosses and turns in 
	bed.


				TROI
			(mumbling)
		Mother?  Mother?


	Dr. Crusher turns away from her computer and sees Troi.  
	She runs over to her and places a hand on Troi's forehead.


				DR. CRUSHER
		You're burning up.


	Dr. Crusher pulls out her tricorder from her pocket 
	and moves it around Troi.  She grabs a syringe and 
	gives Troi a shot.  She then removes Troi's blanket.
	Dr. Crusher GASPS as she looks at the burns covering 50% of 
	Troi's body.


				DR. CRUSHER
			(continuing)
		Ensign, get me the burn kit from
		the cabinet over there.


	ENSIGN PALA opens the cabinet and removes a small gray 
	box which she brings over to Dr. Crusher.


				DR. CRUSHER
			(continuing)
		Thanks.


	Dr. Crusher holds the box over each burn.  A faint blue 
	light from the box shines over the burns as they slowly 
	disappear.  Troi slowly becomes more alert.


				DR. CRUSHER
		How do you feel?


	Troi rubs her arms.


				TROI
		Tired.  Sad.  Scared.


	Riker enters sickbay.  He walks over to Troi and
	Dr. Crusher.


				RIKER
		How's she doing, Doctor?


				DR. CRUSHER
		Not too well I'm afraid.  She just had
		another incident.


	Troi sits up in bed a little.


				TROI
		I'll be fine.


				RIKER
		I came down to tell you we managed
		to contact the consulate.


				DR. CRUSHER
		And?


	Riker looks down at the ground momentarily before 
	looking back at Troi.


				RIKER
		It doesn't look good.
			(beat)
		They're doing all that they can
		to free her.


	Troi smiles weakly.


				TROI
		I know.


	There is a brief moment of silence.  Riker looks at Troi 
	whose eyes are welling up with tears.


				RIKER
		You look like you need to talk.


	Troi brushes away some stray tears as they glide down 
	her cheeks.


				TROI
		That would be nice.


				RIKER
		How about a walk?


				DR. CRUSHER
		I don't know.  There's no telling
		what's going to happen next.


				RIKER
		I promise, I won't let her out of
		my sight.


	Dr. Crusher looks at Troi.


				DR. CRUSHER
		It's up to you.


				TROI
		Let's try ten-forward.  I could
		really use a chocolate sundae.


	Riker helps her out of bed.  They walk towards the door.


				DR. CRUSHER
		Take it easy.


				TROI
		I will.


	They leave the room.


	INT. TEN-FORWARD

	Riker and Troi walk over to a table and sit down.  A
	WAITER walks over to them.


				RIKER
		Nothing for me.


				TROI
		I'll have a hot fudge sundae.


	The waiter walks away.


				RIKER
		So you've spoken with Lwaxana?


	Troi nods slightly.


				TROI
		She really is scared.  She thinks
		she's going to die there.


				RIKER
		What do you think?


	The waiter returns with Troi's sundae.  She picks up the
	spoon and plays with it briefly before answering.



				TROI
		I don't know.
			(beat)
		I don't know.


	Riker puts his hand over Troi's.


				RIKER
		You have to hope for the best.


	Troi puts the spoon down on the table.


				TROI
		But I have to be prepared for
		the worst.


	Troi leans back in her chair and looks out the window.



				RIKER
		Your sundae's going to melt if
		you don't eat it soon.


				TROI
		I'm not very hungry anymore.


				PICARD (o.s)
		Picard to Riker.


	Riker taps his communicator.


				RIKER
		Go ahead Captain.


				PICARD (o.s)
		We should be approaching Betazed
		shortly.


				RIKER
		We're on our way sir.


	They both stand up and walk towards the door.


	INT. BRIDGE

	Picard, along with the rest of the crew, are in their 
	regular positions.  The turbolift whirs to a halt as 
	the door quickly opens and Riker and Troi enter the 
	bridge.  Picard stands up and faces them.


				PICARD
		Counselor, how are you feeling?


	Riker and Troi both walk to their chairs.


				TROI
		I'm alright Captain.


	Troi sits down in her chair.  Picard looks at Riker 
	before they both sit down.  Data spins around in his 
	chair to face the captain.


				DATA
		Sir, we should approach Betazed in
		approximately eight minutes.


				PICARD
		Thank you Mr. Data.


				LaFORGE
		Once we're in range, I'll try
		to lock on the Ambassador's
		signal.


				PICARD
		Good.  Mr. Data, please inform
		me once we're in transporter range.


				DATA
		Aye, captain.


	Data turns back around in his chair to face his 
	computer.


				RIKER
		I'm sure your mother's going to
		be fine.


	Troi gets a distant look in her eye.  Voices begin to 
	fade.


				PICARD
		Lwaxana always seems so invincible.
		Troi begins to waver in her seat.


				RIKER
		I know what you mean.  She certainly
		has done some unbelievable things in
		the past.


				LWAXANA (o.s)
			(weakly)
		Little One.  This is it.  I know this
		is the end.


	Troi stands up.  She is very dizzy and begins to stagger.  
	Sounds begin to blur together with the images of the 
	bridge.


				TROI
			(telepathically)
		Mother?  Hang on!


				LWAXANA (o.s)
		There's so much smoke.  And the
		flames are so hot.  (beat)
		Goodbye Little One.


	The voices of the bridge crew are still fuzzy and 
	distorted.  Lwaxana SCREAMS.


				TROI
			(out loud)
		Nooooo!!!!!!


	Everyone stops talking as they gaze upon Troi.  She begins 
	to collapse.  Riker jumps up to catch her.  He grabs her 
	and gently helps her to the ground.  She is unconscious.


				PICARD
		Picard to Dr. Crusher.


	EXT. SHOT FROM SPACE OF BETAZED


				PICARD (v.o.)
		Captain's Log supplemental:  It has
		been nearly a day and a half since
		Counselor Troi entered her coma.
		Though Dr. Crusher says it is a
		natural event in this situation,
		I can't help but be concerned.  I
		also dred telling her of her mother's
		death when she finally awakens.


	INT. SICKBAY


	Riker is asleep in a chair next to Troi's bed.  Troi
	slowly opens her eyes.  It takes them a minute to focus
	before she looks over at Riker.  She smiles weakly,
	then SIGHS as she looks up at the ceiling.  Dr. Crusher
	turns from her computer and looks at Troi, then walks
	over to her.


				DR. CRUSHER
		He's been here all night.


	Troi smiles again, but does not respond.  Dr. Crusher waves
	her tricorder around Troi.  Riker stretches, then opens 
	his eyes.  He smiles when he sees Troi awake.



				DR. CRUSHER
		How do you feel?


	Troi takes a deep breath before answering.


				TROI
		Alone.


	The smile fades from Riker's lips.


				RIKER
		You know, don't you?


	Troi's eyes begin to tear.


				TROI
		She was so scared.


				RIKER
		There was nothing we could've done.
		She was already dead by the time we
		were in transporter range.


	Troi closes her eyes as a few scattered tears roll down 
	her cheeks.


	INT. BRIDGE


	Picard sits in his command chair with Riker sitting on 
	his right.


				PICARD
		Did you tell her about her mother?


				RIKER
		I didn't have to.


	Picard looks at Riker.


				RIKER
			(continuing)
		She already knew.


	INT. LWAXANA'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Troi stands in front of a table, putting things in 
	boxes.  Riker stands in front of the fireplace removing 
	photographs from the mantle.  Neither are in uniform.  
	The room is silent.  Riker picks up a photo in a gold 
	frame.  He LAUGHS.


				RIKER
		Remember this?


	He turns and walks over to Troi.  She finishes placing 
	something in a box.  Standing behind her, Riker places 
	the photo in front of her.  A large smile spreads 
	across Troi's face.  She takes the photo from Riker and 
	gazes at it.


				TROI
		I can't believe she framed this.


				RIKER
		Look how short my hair was.


				TROI
		What hair?  You can barely see it
		under all that whip cream.


	The two laugh briefly.


				TROI
			(continuing)
		She loved you so much.  She wanted
		me to marry you.


				RIKER
		I know.  She was always looking out
		for you.  You were the most important
		thing to her.
			(pause)
		She was a very special woman.  And
		she has a very special daughter.


	Tears begin to form in Troi's eyes.


				TROI
		I wish I could've been with her.


				RIKER
		But you were.

	Riker puts a hand on Troi's shoulder and gently turns
	her around so she faces him.


				RIKER
			(continuing)
		You were lucky enough to be able
		to speak to her the whole time.
			(beat)
		I know when my mother died, I
		wasn't allowed anywhere near her.
		I would've given anything to have
		been able to say goodbye.


	For the first time, Troi begins to cry.


				TROI
		I'm going to miss her.


	She begins to cry.  Riker wraps his arms around her as
	she cries into his chest.
