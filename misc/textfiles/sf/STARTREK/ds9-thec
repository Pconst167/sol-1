12/16/93      Deep Space Nine, "The Chip"(v#4)By Glen Johnson
FADE IN

ESTABLISHING SHOT - STAR FILLED VIEW OF DEEP SPACE

The frame is filled with stars. The following words fade
into the screen.

                      STARDATE 46399.2
               Within weeks of its discovery,
               many small scout ships started
            conducting precursory sweeps of the
               area beyond the wormhole. . .

Words fade, giving way to the stars.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL a star filled view screen of a small
Federation scout ship. MADISON and KEMP are at their
stations.
          
                            KEMP
          We've dropped out of warp. . . Final
          approach to the wormhole plotted.
          
                          MADISON
          (Pause, looking at readings on console)
          Are your readouts showing a large free
          asteroid heading in our direction?
          
                            KEMP
                (Working out trajectory data
                     for the asteroid)
          I see it.
                   (Pause, then continue)
          Data indicates that it'll pass wide of
          the wormhole and us. Nothing to worry
          about.
          
                          MADISON
          I'd like to ignore this thing and get
          back to DS-9 right now, but if we don't
          scan it they'll just send us back
          through to track it down. . . Set an
          intercept course.
          
                            KEMP
                      (Setting course)
          That's all I'd need. I got a hot time
          planned and don't want to miss it.
          
                          MADISON
          I don't plan on pulling you out of jail
          like the last station where you had a
          'good time planned.' If you wind up in
          one again, you can rot for a while.
                           (MORE)
                       MADISON (Cont)
                (Brief pause, ribbing Kemp)
          I hear they haven't updated those
          Cardassian jail cells to the luxurious
          Federation standards yet.
          
                            KEMP
          It can't be as bad as the last time. . .
          That Klingon cellmate they gave me had
          an attitude against Humans.
          
                          MADISON
                        (Sarcastic)
          He looked so disappointed when I bailed
          you out. . . Like a kid that had his
          favorite toy taken away.
          
                            KEMP
          We're within optimum sensor range.
          
                          MADISON
          Bring'em all on-line. There is no sense
          leaving any unanswered questions.
          
A panel alarm will sound.
          
                            KEMP
          Sensors are detecting some kind of
          irregular object on the surface.
          
                          MADISON
                    (Operating controls)
          Bringing it to main screen.
          
Show the wreckage of a small ship on the view screen. Only
small parts of it are intact and recognizable.
          
                            KEMP
          Scanners show no radiation above
          background. . . If it is a ship, it's
          old. Too old to be Federation in this
          area.
          
                          MADISON
          Materials aren't consistent with any
          known starship construction. . . No
          unusual materials, just old technology.
          
                            KEMP
          I think we better report this
          immediately. They're going to want a
          team of experts on that rock before it
          goes too far.
                          MADISON
          Get a quick scan, then we'll come about
          and head for the station.


                                                   CUT TO:

EXT - STARBASE AND DOCKED SHIPS - ONE YEAR LATER

Show the base with a few docked ships, a ship emerging from
the wormhole in B.G. Lettering will fade in stating it's one
year later.


SISKO'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

Commander SISKO will be at his desk looking at the list of
items that arrived and is in the middle of discussing them
with CHIEF O'BRIEN.

                          O'BRIEN
          That list shows everything that arrived
          for us on the last supply ship. The only
          passengers are Dr. Holdon and two of his
          assistants. He's a cybernetics engineer
          from Earth Research Complex. . . He says
          he needs to speak with you right away.
          
                           SISKO
          Did he say why?
          
                          O'BRIEN
          He'd only say that it was important.
          
                           SISKO
          Where is he now?
          
                          O'BRIEN
          He is probably halfway here from the
          docking area.
          
                           SISKO
          When he shows let me know. . .
              (Noticing something of interest
                        on the list)
          I see the relay we ordered finally
          showed up.
          
                          O'BRIEN
          If we can get it to work.
          
                           SISKO
          What is wrong with it?
                          O'BRIEN
          The component's fine, but the Cardassian
          systems don't match with what Starfleet
          sent.
                           SISKO
          Can you make it work?
          
                          O'BRIEN
          I may be able to rig it. The trick will
          be doing it while keeping all the
          components balanced. This thing can
          output fifty times faster than what it's
          replacing.
          
                           SISKO
          Give it a try and let me know if it
          works.
          
                          O'BRIEN
                     (Turning to leave)
          If you hear a bit of an explosion from
          the switching grid area, you'll know it
          didn't work.
          
                           SISKO
                          (Smile)
          
PORTAL  - POV SISKO

As O'Brien leaves DR. HOLDON will enter uninvited.

                          O'BRIEN
             (Look back at Holdon as they pass)
          
                           HOLDON
          Sorry to disturb you Commander, but my
          mission is very time sensitive.
          
                           SISKO
             (Giving Holdon a suspicious glance
                     and sarcastic tone)
          Ah! Dr Holdon I presume. I was just
          about to make a note to call you at my
          earliest convenience. But since you're
          here. . . have a seat.
          
                           HOLDON
                      (Finding a seat)
          I know this is a bit abrupt, but I need
          your help with a rather delicate matter.
          I need to contact the Pal people to
          negotiate for the services of a Dr.
          King.
                           SISKO
                       (Astonishment)
          The Dr. King arrested by the Pal for
          murdering ten of their people? He's
          accused of conducting illegal
          experiments on them.
                       (Brief pause)
          You must be joking.
          
                           HOLDON
          That's the one. . . and I'm not.
          
                           SISKO
          He almost caused them to break all
          relations with the Federation, and you
          want me to help get him out? They were a
          rather reclusive race before, but now. .
          . no chance!
          
                           HOLDON
          Not just arrested, he confessed, and
          he's sentenced to death. But I don't
          want him free. . . I want him for an
          experiment.
          
                           SISKO
          What kind of experiment?
          
                           HOLDON
          Do you remember about a year ago, when
          the first organized charting missions
          where being conducted beyond?
                     (Standing to pace)
          One of those missions found the wreckage
          of an alien ship on a free asteroid.
          
                           SISKO
          Yes, inside were the remains of two
          aliens of unknown race. They were
          remarkably well preserved in their
          environment-suits, a substantial find.
          
                           HOLDON
          Yes, quite remarkable, but that was only
          part of it. Inside of each of their
          brain cavities was a microchip of some
          kind. We've tried to assess the purpose
          of it, but so far we haven't been able
          to make any headway. . . They've been
          hooked up to every computer available,
          with every imaginable test run. Nothing
          has given us any information about the
          things.
                           SISKO
          Well and good, but how does that effect
          Dr. King? He is a toxicologist. I don't
          see how he can offer any knowledge that
          will help.
          
                           HOLDON
          I don't want his knowledge, I want his
          body. . . before he's executed.
          
                           SISKO
                        (Perplexed)
          His body?
          
                           HOLDON
          We were at a loss and couldn't think of
          how to proceed.
                (Pause to sit, serious tone)
          Eventually, someone came up with the
          bright idea of implanting the chip into
          a living organism. Perhaps it would
          activate. A bit far fetched I admit, but
          we had nothing to lose. . . We immersed
          it in a vat of cloned tissue and slight
          electrical activity started around the
          chip. Not much. . . but more than we
          actually expected. From there we planted
          it into the brain of a rat.
                         (Excited)
          The results where remarkable. For a
          short time the chip stimulated the
          growth of new neural pathways.
                       (Brief pause)
          Later we planted it in the brain of a
          chimp with about the same results.
          Except this time the growth was far more
          extensive, and much more rapid. . . But
          again the growth stopped with no real
          results beyond that.
          
                           SISKO
          Your theory of what the thing is?
          
                           HOLDON
          My guess is it's a memory chip that
          would assist its host in mnemonic
          functions. . . basic data storage.
          
                           SISKO
          And now you want to implant it into Dr.
          King? Experimentation on humans like
          that is illegal.
                           HOLDON
          Not if the subject gives knowing and
          informed consent. Besides, it would be
          poetic justice. . . wouldn't it?
          
                           SISKO
          Yes. . . it would. . . But since the law
          says you need his consent, what makes
          you think he'll give it? Or that the Pal
          will let him even if he wants to?
          
                           HOLDON
          As for King, do you have any idea how
          the Pal execute someone?
          
                           SISKO
          They give them a lethal injection of
          sorts.
          
                           HOLDON
          It's not some humane poison that kills
          you quickly.
                          (Pause)
          They inject you with a very insidious
          virus that kills you slowly, and very
          painfully. It eats the tissue of the
          body. As it does, it releases a
          byproduct that's acidic into the
          bloodstream, a tenderizer of sorts. This
          pre-digests the tissue it contacts,
          allowing for faster digestion. Thus
          releasing more of the acid faster, and
          so on. . . Death can sometimes take over
          a month, each day you suffer knowing
          that the next day's pain will be even
          worse than what your presently
          experiencing. It's not a very pleasant
          way to die. . . If he accepts being my
          guinea pig, I intend to offer him a
          quick, painless death as opposed to what
          he now faces.
          
                           SISKO
          I can see where that would get his
          attention. . . But what about the Pal?
          He's under their jurisdiction, not mine.
          What if they don't want to accept?
          
                           HOLDON
          They're a race dedicated to the quest
          for knowledge, and have tied up great
          amounts of their planet's resources to
          that sacred quest. I'm hoping that
          they'll see how much knowledge may be
          gained by this experiment and allow it
          to proceed. . .
                           (MORE)
                       HOLDON (Cont)
          Besides, you were the great negotiator
          that convinced them not to break
          relations when he was arrested. I have
          faith that you can perform the same kind
          of miracle for this.
          
                           SISKO
          I'm glad you have faith, but I had to
          make a lot of promises to pull it off.
          And one was to allow them to prosecute
          without Federation interference. Now you
          want me to intervene.
          
                           HOLDON
          I've been doing my homework. The treaty
          with the Pal clearly gives them the
          right to arrest, try, and punish him. It
          also states that whenever practical,
          they are to do so with consideration to
          Federation laws, standards and values. A
          small hold, but it should give you some
          grounds for compromise in the matter.
          
                           SISKO
          Perhaps it's worth a try, but understand
          this. . .
                      (Speak sternly)
          I will not compromise the relation with
          the Pal to get this deal made.
          
                           HOLDON
          Fair enough. I contacted them and asked
          that the execution be postponed until I
          arrived. They gave me until tomorrow.
          
                           SISKO
          You do know that they will only
          negotiate face to face, an old and still
          honored tradition of their people? We'll
          have to go to their planet to discuss it
          with them.
          
                           HOLDON
          Yes, but you'll have to go without me. I
          don't want them to know I arrived yet.
          That way if they don't agree . . . I'll
          have until tomorrow to try and think of
          something else.
          
                           SISKO
          I've some things to finish before I can
          go, but it won't take long.
                           HOLDON
          Good. In the meantime I'll be sampling
          what Mr. Quark's establishment has to
          offer.
          
                           SISKO
          How did you find out about his place so
          soon? You must have come straight here
          the from docking areas.
          
                           HOLDON
          Mr. Quark met the ship and personally
          invited passengers and crew to join him.
          
                           SISKO
          I give him credit for quick thinking. I
          just made him remove a bunch of notices
          he had in all the locks. He's supposed
          to keep his advertising in the
          promenade.

          Have a ship readied, I'm going to be
          going to the Pal system.
          
                            KIRA
          Pal? Why there?
          
                           SISKO
          I'm going to negotiate the method of
          execution for Dr. King.
          
                            KIRA
          You mean you have a more sadistic method
          of death than what they've planned?
          
                           SISKO
          No. . . I'm going to try and negotiate a
          more humane death for him.
                            KIRA
          What? I thought that after what you went
          through to keep relations with the Pal,
          your only regret would be that he could
          only die once.
          
                           SISKO
          Something like that, I'll explain when I
          get the chance. Just have the ship
          prepared and standing by.
          
                            KIRA

QUARK'S - FEW HOURS LATER

PAN the clientele to find Dr. Holdon sitting, nursing a
drink. Hold on him until QUARK comes to sit with him.

                           QUARK
                      (Confidentially)
          I have been told you are seeking
          transport off of DS-9. . . You wish to
          leave soon?
          
                           HOLDON
          As soon as my cargo arrives.
          
                           QUARK
          Where do you wish to go?
          
                           HOLDON
          Earth.
          
                           QUARK
                         (Confused)
          Ships leave for that area often, one
          leaves tomorrow in fact. Why don't you
          book passage on one of them?
          
                           HOLDON
          I don't intend to go all the way to
          Earth, and I do not want to be traced.
          I'll need to leave on short notice, so
          it'll have to be standing by.
                           QUARK
          To tie up a ship that can make that kind
          of journey is expensive. How much do you
          intend to pay for this service?
          
                           HOLDON
           (Handing Quark a small readout device)
          This should more than cover it.
          
                           QUARK
          This is a nice figure, but it is in
          Federation currency. Easily traceable
          out here. . . I will need twice that to
          cover costs of filtering the money.
          
                           HOLDON
          You must be joking! That's twice what
          you should expect to get.
          
                           QUARK
          If the cargo was an honest one, yes. . .
          But this smells of something not quite
          so honest.
          
                           HOLDON
                          (Upset)
          Will it be ready in an hour?
          
                           QUARK
                          (Pause)
          Yes, I am sure I can have something
          standing by.
          
                           HOLDON
          Just make sure I get what I pay for.

                           QUARK
          It would seem that commander Sisko is
          returning from a visit to the Pal. I
          think you may be interested in his
          arrival.
          
                           HOLDON
          What makes you think that?
          
                           QUARK
          I make it a point to keep informed. It
          keeps me in business. . . and out of
          jail.
                           HOLDON

BAY AREA - CDR SISKO'S RETURN

A runabout class vessel is unloading. Sisko will come off
and be met by Holdon.
          
                           HOLDON
          How did it go?
          
                           SISKO
          Your expectation of them was quite
          correct. They wish you great knowledge
          from your quest.
          
                           HOLDON
          King? Did you explain it to him?
          
                           SISKO
          Yes, but he wouldn't give any kind of
          answer. He wants to speak to you first.
          
                           HOLDON
          I'd guess he would have some questions.
          

POV HOLDON - SHIP DOOR B.G.

Holdon will be facing Sisko and the ship, with the door of
the ship in b.g. Over Sisko's shoulder DR. KING will come
out in restraints.

                           HOLDON
                  (As King exits the ship)
          This must be Dr. King. How nice of you
          to consider my offer.
          
                            KING
                        (Resentful)
          It's not like I had a choice, I was
          forced into this.
          
                           HOLDON
          How so? I can't force you to do this.
          
                            KING
          Coerce is more the word for it. Besides.
          . .  when you're sentenced to death by
                           (MORE)
                        KING (Cont)
          the Pal you officially cease to exist as
          a being. I'm damaged property that's
          been given to you for disposal.
          
                           HOLDON
          That's not how it is here though. If you
          don't want to accept my offer, then you
          simply return to the Pal for execution
          of your sentence. . . Excuse the pun.
          
                            KING
          Some choice. Die a hideous death back
          there, or be dissected here. But only
          after my brain is fried by some kind of
          electrical device. Wonderful!
          
                           HOLDON
          It will not fry your brain. In all of
          the experiments the subject suffered no
          pain. Other than the growth there should
          be no symptoms of any kind.
          
                            KING
          What makes you think this thing will act
          any different than it did with the
          chimp? Their physiology's enough like
          ours to pass.
          
                           HOLDON
          It seemed like the growth patterns were
          looking to establish a link with the
          higher functions of the brain. When it
          couldn't find adequate functional
          capacity in its host, it discontinued
          the growth.
          
                            KING
          What if this thing links as you put it,
          then what?
          
                           HOLDON
          The odds are that even if it establishes
          a link, you probably won't be able to
          decipher the data since it will be in an
          alien thought pattern.
          
                            KING
          That's if I choose to do it.
          
                           HOLDON
          The option is yours. You basically have
          to choose either a slow, painful and
          useless death, or die helping to further
                           (MORE)
                       HOLDON (Cont)
          the base of knowledge. Being a scientist
          yourself I think you'd rather choose the
          latter. . . Would that be a fair
          assumption?
          
                            KING
          Like I pointed out before, some choice.
          . . when do we start?
          
                           HOLDON
          As soon as I can make arrangements for
          the trip to Earth, we'll start work
          there.
          
                           SISKO
          Unfortunately that won't be possible.
          The Pal traditions require that sentence
          be carried out within a set time.
          Otherwise the accused must be set free.
          That's their law.
          
                           HOLDON
          How long do we have?
          
                           SISKO
          Just over three days, that's it.
          
                           HOLDON
                        (Pondering)
          That does pose some problems. I didn't
          bring some of my team members that are
          critical for the project. The most
          important one is the surgeon who would
          implant the device. It'll take weeks to
          get them all here.
          
                           SISKO
          We have a surgeon here. He may be able
          to do it if you give him the needed
          information. The facilities here may be
          small, but I think with a little work we
          should be able to give you anything
          you'll need.
          
                            KING
          You seem awfully helpful after the cold
          treatment you gave me on the trip here.
          You wouldn't even acknowledge my
          presence. Why the interest?
          
                           SISKO
          I gave my word that I'd return you to
          have sentence carried out. I don't
                           (MORE)
                        SISKO (Cont)
          cherish the concept of capital
          punishment myself, but I do value
          relations with the Pal.
                          (Pause)
          Besides, the more information that can
          be gotten from that chip, the better
          prepared we may be for what's beyond the
          wormhole. So I definitely have an
          interest in how things go.
          
                           HOLDON
          If it works I'll need time to study it.
          That may require resources that only the
          Earth Research Complex can provide, what
          then?
          
                           SISKO
          If it comes to that we may be able to
          work something out with the Pal. We'll
          have to deal with that when the time
          comes.
          
                           HOLDON
               (Pause pondering the problem)
          Let's give it a shot. . . I'll draw up a
          list of what's needed. I'll also need to
          speak with your surgeon to see if he can
          do the job.
          
                           SISKO
                   (Jesting with Holdon)
          Oh! He is good, fresh out of school.
          
                           HOLDON
                        (Not amused)
          You must be joking. You expect me to put
          the fate of the project into the hands
          of someone with no practical experience.
          
                           SISKO
          He's really quite good, but you can talk
          to him yourself and decide.
          
                           HOLDON

          In the meantime, I'm going to treat you
          as I promised the Pal leader. You are to
          be a non-person while you're waiting for
          the work to start.

                            KING
          Being a nonentity here can't be nearly
          as bad as where you picked me up from. I
          could have died just from the cold cell
          they had me in.
          
                           SISKO
          Keep talking and I'll make arrangements
          to simulate that cell exactly. Perhaps
          even adding a few rats to the picture.

QUARK'S

Quark will be siting at a table with a HUMAN, the entrance
to the place will be in the B.G. Dr. Holdon will walk in and
look over the crowd, looking for someone. Quark will gesture
to get his attention.

                           HOLDON
                (Arriving at the table, look
                 suspiciously at the human)
          We have to talk. . . in private.
          
                           QUARK
          You can speak in front of him, he is the
          Captain of the ship you have hired.
          
                           HOLDON
            (Pause as he looks the person over)
          There's been a change of plans. I may
          not be able to leave for three days.
                           QUARK
          That does present a problem. A ship
          costs whether you use it or not. The
          longer you wait the more you will have
          to pay.
          
                           HOLDON
          How much more?
          
                           QUARK
           (Leans to discuss something privately
                 with the Human then speaks)
          An additional twenty-five percent each
          day.
          
                           HOLDON
          That's outrageous. How can you expect to
          get that kind of money?
          
                           QUARK
          Simple, I have cornered the market for
          this kind of business. If you don't deal
          with me you'll have to take a regular
          passage out. So. . . is it a deal?
          
                           HOLDON
                     (Very distressed)
          That ship had better be standing by
          waiting!
                         (Walk out)
          
                           HUMAN
                   (After Holdon is gone)
          What happens when he finds out I don't
          have a ship?
          
                           QUARK
          It is just a hunch, but I have the
          feeling that he will not be needing it.
          Rumor has it that what he's doing is
          quite illegal, and will land him in
          jail. . . I just want to get his money
          before that happens.

TRACKING SHOT - HALLWAY GOING TO THE MEDICAL FACILITY

Holdon and Sisko will be heading to speak to Dr. Bashir
about the procedure, and his ability to perform it. They
will be discussing other arrangements that are being made.
                           HOLDON
          I've been making arrangements with your
          staff. They've assured me that we can
          have everything we'll need set up by
          tomorrow.
          
                           SISKO
          Good! I've informed Odo to make security
          arrangements for the proceedings.
          
                           HOLDON
          I don't see much chance of him running,
          but it can't hurt. I've consulted with
          my staff about Dr. Bashir. We feel he
          should be able to perform the procedure
          with a reasonable chance of success.
          With a few precautions, I don't see how
          he could damage the chip. According to
          his file, this Doctor of yours seems to
          have his feet planted firmly on the
          ground.

OVER SHOULDER - POV SISKO AND HOLDON - MEDICAL OFFICE PORTAL

They will be facing the portal as it opens. Inside they will
see DR. BASHIR practicing fast draw with a replica of an old
six-gun.

                           HOLDON
                     (Turning to Sisko)
          My estimate on King's chances of
          surviving the surgery just dropped
          dramatically.
          
                           BASHIR

                            ODO
               (Voice only over communicator)
          Odo to Commander Sisko. We need your
          assistance at Mr Quark's place.
          
                           SISKO
          What now?
          
                            ODO
               (Voice only over communicator)
          It would seem that he is accusing
          someone of cheating.
          
                           SISKO
          I believe the term would be 'The pot
          calling the kettle black?'
                           QUARK
                (Voice only in background of
                     Odo's communicator)
          I heard that, whatever it implies I'm
          sure I should not like it.
          
                           SISKO
          I'll be there shortly. Sisko out.
          
                           HOLDON
          I just need to discuss a few details
          with the Doctor. So if you need to go,
          be my guest.
          
                           SISKO
               (making it obvious he doesn't
                    actually want to go)
          All right then, your sure you won't need
          me here?
          
                           HOLDON
          Mr. Quark has quite the place there. It
          must keep you amused.
          
                           BASHIR

                     (turning to leave)
          Yeah, that sums it up nicely.

              (Noticing Holdon looking at the
                     gun, embarrassed)
          This is not as bad as it looks. . .
          Major Kira saw a reference to it in a
          book I was reading once. She gave it to
          me as a practical joke and I just
          thought I'd have a little fun with it.
          
                           HOLDON
          A joke?
          
                           BASHIR
          The first time we met I made a comment
          about frontier medicine way out here in
          the wild. She did not take kindly to the
          accidental inference to her people. I
          guess I irritate her a bit sometimes.
                           HOLDON
          I understand. . . How would you like to
          do some real frontier medicine?
          
                           BASHIR
          I've heard a bit of what you have in
          mind. I'm not sure if I can do what you
          ask.
                       (Put gun away)
          
                           HOLDON
          It shouldn't be too bad. You've been
          trained on similar procedures.
          
                           BASHIR
          Yes, but you are asking me to do
          something using methods that haven't
          been used in years. If I had a little
          time I could modify the equipment to do
          it properly.
          
                           HOLDON
          Time is something we don't have a great
          deal of. Once the chip's implanted it
          will take a few days for it to grow its
          net and give us any idea what we have.
          And that's all the time we have.
          
                           BASHIR
          And what if he dies because we didn't
          take the proper precautions, then what?
          
                           HOLDON
          We'll take every precaution possible in
          the time we have. But I'm sure you are
          aware of Dr. King's predicament. His
          survival is not a major concern.
          
                           BASHIR
          Perhaps it's not for you. But it make a
          big difference to me if a patient dies
          while in my care.
          
                           HOLDON
          I don't foresee that as being a problem.
          In fact I can reasonably assure it.
          
                           BASHIR
          How? We're going to be cutting into his
          brain with slightly better than
          scalpels.
          
                           HOLDON
          Actually it's much less appalling than
          that. We simply have to plant it deep
                           (MORE)
                       HOLDON (Cont)
          enough to allow contact with the outer
          layer of the brain. The chip will do the
          rest.
          
                           BASHIR
          And if something goes wrong?
          
                           HOLDON
          From the minute we start King will have
          a small device around his arm. It will,
          on my command, administer an overdose of
          anesthesia to kill him. I'll have this
          in place in case something goes wrong
          that may endanger the chip. . . He'll be
          dead by my hand, not yours.
          
                           BASHIR
                         (Disgust)
          That's a bit cold.
          
                           HOLDON
          Perhaps, but he is dead no matter what.
          It's better that we get some benefit
          from his death.
          
                           BASHIR
          Perhaps. . . but I'll have to talk to
          Dr. King before I decide.
          
                           HOLDON
          That's fine, just decide soon. I have to
          make other arrangements if you can't, or
          won't do it.
          
                           BASHIR
          I'll talk to him shortly and give you my
          answer right after.
          
                           HOLDON
          Thank you. . . I'm sure he'll be
          cooperative with you. I'll be waiting
          for your answer.

QUARK'S PLACE

SAM will be seated at one of his tables, a stack of chips in
front of her. She's in a semblance of a Starfleet science
uniform. It will be devoid of normal markings and covered by
a light jacket. ODO will be standing behind her. On the
table will be a circle with a deck of cards scattered face
down inside it. Quark will meet Sisko.

                           QUARK
                       (Slight anger)
          I demand you do something. The constable
          will not make her return what she has
          stolen.
          
                           SISKO
          What's been stolen?
          
                            ODO
          From what I can tell, we simply have a
          case of someone beating one of Quark's
          games on a rather consistent basis.
          
                           SISKO
                     (Looking at Quark)
          What proof do you have that she's
          cheated your game?
                           QUARK
          Just look in front of her. To have won
          that much money she must have been
          cheating.
          
                           SISKO
                 (Looking at her winnings)
          Impressive. . . how did you manage to
          win such a large sum?
          
                            SAM
          A rule of this game is that on your
          exit, or last hand,  you can bet all of
          the money you have on the table. You bet
          before you look at your cards, and the
          house gives you double payoff if you
          win. I decided to do that. . . and won.

          She still must have cheated.
          
                            SAM
          Or I'm simply a better player than you.
          
                           QUARK
          That is not possible.
          
                            SAM
          Perhaps you'd like to play me yourself
          then.
          
                           QUARK
          Let you play me with my own money, I
          think not.
          
                           SISKO
          I don't see any indication that she
          stole anything. I'm afraid unless you
          can give me some proof, there's nothing
          I can do.
          
                           QUARK
          I can see this is going nowhere.
          
                            SAM
                    (Challenging Quark)
          Come on. One draw of the cards, double
          or nothing, high card takes all. You
          draw first, and you win if we tie. . .
                       (Insinuative)
          Or are you afraid someone is going to
          cheat?
          
                            ODO
          Sounds fair to me. Doesn't it seem that
          way to you also Commander?
                           SISKO
          Quite.
          
Quark will draw,  doing it defiantly, being pressured into
it. Sam will draw, hiding hers slightly with her hand.

                           SISKO
          Not quite yet, I have a few questions
          for you. Like who are you, and how you
          come to be wearing what looks like a
          Starfleet uniform?
          
                            SAM
                         (Annoyed)
          My name is Samantha Ryan. I used to be
          in Starfleet and was an archaeologist
          assigned to cataloging samples on
          Brightens Planet. Things just got a bit
          boring for me there, so when my term was
          up, I left.
          
                            ODO
          How does someone like you manage to
          afford a luxury ship like the one you
          have?
          
                           SISKO
                       (Inquisitive)
          Luxury ship?
          
                            ODO
          A Xebec class yacht. Her ship is being
          detained for safety violations because
          she does not have the minimum safe
          complement of crew for it. It would seem
                           (MORE)
                         ODO (Cont)
          that she wants to travel through to the
          other side by herself. We are also
          checking her registry to see if it is
          valid.
          
                            SAM
          First off, my ship is no longer a yacht.
          I've stripped most of the cabins to
          allow for cargo and lab space and it's
          now classified and registered as an
          advanced scout ship. Second, it has
          special modifications that make it
          perfectly safe to fly solo.
               (Shoot Quark a sour look when
                      saying 'Ferengi')
          And third, I won it fair and square from
          some rich kid Ferengi who inherited a
          fortune and wanted to lose it in a card
          game.
                       (Brief pause)
          He couldn't keep his eyes or his hands
          off me long enough to play the game. So
          you have no reason to hold my ship.
          
                            ODO
          Regardless of the configuration, you
          must have at least two people on board
          to legally pilot a ship of that size in
          this sector.
          
                           SISKO
          Why did you strip out the cabins? And
          why would you need a lab?
          
                            SAM
          When I got bored with my job I decided
          to go freelance. . . I intend to go
          beyond the wormhole to chart and
          explore. And perhaps find my own
          archaeological discoveries to work on.
          
                           SISKO
                       (Insinuative)
          And sell them to the highest bidder?
          
                            SAM
          I won't need to. The Federation will pay
          plenty for valid data from deep
          exploration excursions. They would
          rather pay good money to a free-lancer
          like me than tie up their own resources
          this far out. That will pay well enough
          for me. Anything else I find will be
          turned over to the proper organizations
          for study.
                           SISKO
          If you were an archaeologist in
          Starfleet, how did you learn to pilot a
          starship?
          
                            SAM
          My father was a free-trader, and a bit
          of a gambler. When my mother died I had
          to travel with him. We flew by ourselves
          for years and I had two choices, learn
          the job and help, or be in the way. . .
          So I learned.
          
                            ODO
          Did you learn to fly as well as you
          learned to gamble?
          
                            SAM
          Better!
          
                           SISKO
          Why didn't you become an officer when
          you joined Starfleet. . . Then you would
          have been able to use your skills.
          
                            SAM
                   (State with a bit of
                    resentment, bitter)
          I didn't have enough education to become
          an officer. They would put me through
          school in the field of my choice if I
          took an assignment of their choice. It
          was my best offer.
          
                           SISKO
          Now what do you plan to do?
          
                            SAM
          Use the money I just won to hire some
          schmuck to go along for the ride. That
          way you'll have to let me go.
          
                            ODO
          That schmuck, as you put it will have to
          be more than just an observer. I'll be
          checking credentials to see if he. . .
          or she can fill the position
          requirements.
          
                            SAM
          There must be some stray crew types
          around here, I'll just have to do a
          little looking.
                           SISKO
          I just hope you find someone you can
          trust.
          
                            ODO
                    (Glancing at Quark)
          That leaves out anyone you can find in
          this place. . . I believe you owe this
          lady some money.
          
                           QUARK
           (begrudgingly counting out the money)
          And trusting you is supposed to be any
          better of a proposition?
          
                           SISKO
          I'll make you a deal. If you leave Mr.
          Quark here alone and don't cause any
          other trouble, I'll help you find a
          suitable crew member. . . Deal?
          
                            SAM
          Fair enough. I've a few minor changes to
          make on my ship and supplies to
          purchase. I think I can keep busy enough
          to stay out of trouble.
          
                           SISKO
          Good, that should make Mr. Quark breathe
          a little easier.

          You cheated?
          
                            SAM
          No, I baited him. I know the Ferengi. .
          . they can't resist an easy mark. So I
          came in with a lot of money and acted
          like I had no idea how to play. When
          they saw that, they took out a marked
          deck. . . I won't cheat an honest game,
          but once the marked cards came out,
          anything goes.
          
                            ODO
          He must have some new way to mark the
          deck, I check them regularly and have
          not found any marked cards in some time.
          
                            SAM
          Same old marks. He probably has spotters
          watching to make sure they pull them off
          the table when you or your men are
          coming.
          
                            ODO
          Why was the deck still there when I
          arrived then?
          
                            SAM
          I noticed the dealer was getting a
          little nervous about something. As a
          rule. . . 'when he gets nervous so
          should you.' I just made a lot of noise
          so people would look my way and call
          security. It didn't allow him enough
          time to move them.

                         SAM (Cont)
                       (Brief pause)
          I had no idea you were the reason he was
          getting nervous. You must have been
          really close.
          
                            ODO
          I was just coming in when I heard you
          making noise.
                          (Pause)
          If the cards are marked, why did he draw
          the holder? It's only the second highest
          card. . . He could have drawn the ace.
          
                            SAM
          It would be suspicious. Besides, he
          needed to see if I was on to him.
          
                            ODO
          Ferengi don't give money just to see if
          they are right about something.
          
                            SAM
          No, but if I knew the cards where marked
          and he drew the ace, he has to figure
          I'd turn him in. . . By allowing me the
          ace to win he could buy me off. And it
          would let him know for sure that I was
          on to him.
          
                            ODO
                         (Big grin)
          Well done! Now that I know what he is up
          to I can go in disguised and catch him
          in the act.
          
                            SAM
          If you do I'd like it if you could wait
          until I've been gone for a few weeks.
          That way he won't know I let on. . . But
          he'll just find another way to cheat.
          
                            ODO
          True, I'll have to give it some thought.
          In the mean time I'll just make a few
          extra known visits to his place to keep
          the marked cards off the table.
          
                            SAM
          That will irritate him a bit. The marked
          cards will only be out when there's a
          pigeon with a lot of money playing.
          
                            ODO
          A pigeon?
                            SAM

                           HOLDON
                   (Cutting Bashir short)
          You've made up your mind then?
          
                           BASHIR
          Yes!
                          (Pause)
          It would seem that Dr. King is in favor
          of it and has made an informed decision
          about the matter, and so. . . I'll do
          it.
          
                           HOLDON
          I assure you he knows perfectly well
          what's at risk. And he also knows what
          he will get if he doesn't do it.
          
                           BASHIR
          That sounds a lot like blackmail to me.
                           HOLDON
          Not blackmail. I'm simply offering him a
          choice. One that may benefit humanity in
          the process.
          
                           BASHIR
          He believes that himself. I don't see
          how he could have killed those people,
          he's a decent person.
          
                           HOLDON
          I'm sure he's done a bit of soul
          searching since his arrest.
          
                           BASHIR
          Perhaps.
                          (Pause)
          In any case I'll be ready tomorrow. . .
          I have things to prepare.

EXT OF STATION - DR. BASHIR'S LOG ENTRY

He will be making a somber entry into his personal log.

                           BASHIR
                        (Voice only)
          Personal log; medical officer Bashir. I
          am still not sure if it is morally
          correct to do this procedure. This
          concern with the moral dilemma of live
          testing is perhaps part of the reason I
          didn't enter the research field. There
          is one more dilemma here to face. . .
          Before the cures for cancer, many people
          where faced with the prospect of a long
          and painful death. They were denied the
          option of suicide because of the moral
          implications. Is this any different?
          Unable to come to a conclusion, I
          proceed in dismay.

                                                   CUT TO:


OPERATING ROOM - KING IS ON OPERATING ROOM TABLE

Bashir and his assistant, LIEUTENANT BROOK are about to
proceed. Holdon is observing, standing ready with the device
to execute King. King will have the band on his arm.
                           HOLDON
          It would seem that everything's ready
          Doctor, I hope you're feeling up to the
          task?
          
                           BASHIR
             (Looking at Holdon then making eye
                     contact with King)
          
                            KING
          It's all right. Think of it like leaving
          an organ donor clause in a will. Only
          I'll get the chance to see what benefit
          will come from my donation.
          
                           BASHIR
                   (Taking a deep breath)
          Lieutenant. . . Administer three units
          of Clortridean, then keep a steady point
          five units per fifteen minute cycle.
          
                           HOLDON
                         (Agitated)
          That is not what you were directed to
          give. It calls for. . .
          
                           BASHIR
                (Cutting off Holdon, blunt)
          My concern here is for the survival of
          the patient. What you directed me to
          give would not block the activity in the
          area to be operated on. Complications
          would be likely to cause brain damage.
          Now either stand there and let me
          proceed as I see fit, or find someone
          else to do the job.
          
                           HOLDON
          It would take too long to get someone
          else sent in. You know that.
          
                           BASHIR
          Then I proceed?
          
                            KING
                     (Smile at Bashir)
          
                           HOLDON
                          (Sedate)
          All right then, proceed.
          
                           BASHIR
          Lieutenant!

                       (As he starts)
          Start a timer. We can only have him
          under this anesthesia for an hour. Any
          longer and he may have a reaction to it.
          
                           HOLDON
          Can you finish in that time? We set
          aside much more.
          
                           BASHIR
          It may or may not please you to know
          that I couldn't sleep last night. So I
          spent the time calibrating the equipment
          to do this right. It'll let him walk out
          of here instead of spending days in
          recovery.
          
                           HOLDON
                 (Showing obvious concern)
          We'll see.

          Good.

                           BASHIR
          You can start withdrawing the dosage now
          by twenty five percent each cycle.
          
                           BROOK
          Yes Doctor.

          the incision.
                           BROOK
                   (Brief pause, concern)
          Doctor. . . I'm getting some very
          unusual readings. . . neural activity in
          the brain is unusually high.
          
                           BASHIR
          Let me see. . . this can't be. Neural
          growth has already started.
          
                           HOLDON
          How long until the incision is closed?
          
                           BASHIR
          Just over three minutes. It will kill
          him if the closing process is
          interrupted by the growth.
          
                           HOLDON
            (Reaching for the triggering device)
          That's enough, I can't risk the chip.
          
                           BASHIR
              (Violently ripping the arm band
                      off king, angry)
          He will make it. . . Lieutenant, give
          him one dose, fifty units of Noradine
          followed immediately by five units
          Calnoradine and continue it every five
          minute cycle.
          
                           HOLDON
          That will destroy the growth.
          
                           BASHIR
          The fifty units would if it had time,
          but the Calnoradine will control the
          absorption of the toxin to just keep the
          growth in check for a while.
          
Brook will inject the dosage, then there will be a pause to
let it work.
          
                           BROOK
                     (After the pause)
          The growth has reduced to acceptable
          levels.
          
                           BASHIR
          Good, we don't want to kill the growing
          cells. Just keep the flow of the
          antitoxin balanced to slow it until the
          incision is closed. Then adjust it to
          control the process.
                           HOLDON
          How did you know Noradine would work?
          
                           BASHIR
          Dr. King and myself had a little talk
          last night. Toxins and how they can be
          used beneficially is his specialty. We
          came up with it together.
          
                           HOLDON
          All I can say is that it better not
          damage the chip in any way.
          
                           BASHIR
                          (Anger)
          All I know is that you seem a little
          quick to not see him make it. I had
          better not find any improprieties in
          these proceedings. . . Lieutenant, see

          about all this though.
          
                            DAX
          What seems to be the puzzle?
          
                           BASHIR
          It's Holdon. He's not acting with good
          ethical judgement. For a scientist, he
          seems to be awfully willing to kill Dr.
          King without giving a chance to let the
          test run its course.
                            DAX
          I don't know much about the two. Perhaps
          he has something to settle with King.
          
                           BASHIR
          According to King they've never met
          before.
          
                            DAX

                            DAX
          I could bring up both of their files and

          I earned this death. I did kill those
          people.
                      (Stand to pace)
          It's funny. . . The fine line between
          being a hero and being a criminal is so
          slight.
          
                           SISKO
          Explain.
          
                            KING
          Those people I killed where terminally
          ill. I was looking for a cure for a
          disease that was killing them.
          
                           SISKO
          Why did you kill them?
          
                            KING
          The Pal are a reclusive people. They
          will not use anything that isn't from
          their world. Federation technology would
          have easily eradicated the disease, but
          the cure must come from their planet,
          with their technology. So I set out to
          do just that. . . and it worked. I cured
          twenty-five of the thirty five
          volunteers. The problem is that ten of
          them had an allergic reaction that was
          fatal. . . The disease made them so weak
          they couldn't take the reaction. I
          solved the problem with the medication
          before they arrested me.
          
                           SISKO
          Did you explain that at your trial?
          
                            KING
          Yes, but their law doesn't allow for
          this kind of testing. . .Those people
          who volunteered were near death. They
          where so desperate that they were
          willing to risk everything.
          
                           SISKO
          Why did you take this kind of risk? You
          must have known in advance that you were
          breaking the law.
                            KING
          In the culture of the Pal you are judged
          not just by your own actions, but the
          actions of your family and friends. Each
          member is responsible for the actions of
          everyone within their circle. To be
          invited into a circle is the greatest
          honor a person can be given. . . I was
          invited into one two years ago. . . The
          person who invited me was dying from the
          disease. . . I had to do something.

                          (Pause)
          A very close friend.
                          (Pause)
          Anyway. . . That's why I'm ready to die.
          The circle is now blemished and I must
          be punished to allow it to be cleared.
          
                           SISKO
          I'm sorry. . . I wish there was
          something I could do.
          
                            KING
          You spared me from that method
          execution.
                     (Pause, pondering)
          There is something you could do though.
          Give me something to record my formula
          on. If you could take it to her family
          so they can use it on her son. She
          adopted him after his mother died from
          the same disease. . . I love him like my
          own.
          
                           SISKO
          I can do that. . . but why don't they
          have it?
          
                            KING
          I was doing something illegal and had to
          hide my records. They'll find them
          sooner or later, but he may die by then.
          
                           SISKO
          I'll have what you need sent here. . .
          Have you told Dr. Bashir about this?
          
                            KING
          No, he has enough to deal with already.
          . . It's funny. . . I had this formula
          almost a year ago, but I couldn't get
          permission from their government to test
          it on chronically ill patients. They
          wanted to volunteer, and knew the risk.
                           (MORE)
                        KING (Cont)
          More than a hundred of them have died
          since then. They would be alive if they
          had let me test it. . . but they
          wouldn't give them the choice.

LIEUTENANT DAX'S OFFICE

Lieutenant Dax will be working at a station running through
files. Dr. Holdon's picture should flash past to show it's
his files she is looking at.

                           BASHIR
                        (Walking in)
          How is it going, have you found anything
          yet?
          
                            DAX
          I'm working on it. How is your patient?
          
                           BASHIR
          He is alive, no thanks to Holdon. He's
          been back in his cell for a few hours
          now and is doing well, considering. I
          still can't believe how quick Holdon was
          to write off Dr. King.
          
                            DAX
          It seems that Dr. Holdon is under
          investigation for ethics violations. The
          files are still closed because it's an
          active investigation, but Odo's working
          on that. He sent a special request to
          have the files opened, and we should be
          hearing back soon.
          
                           BASHIR
          I'm surprised it's not a criminal
          investigation with as little regard as
          he has for life.
          
                            DAX
          There's more. I have no idea where he
          intended to take Dr. King for study, but
          it was not the Earth Research Complex.
          It would seem that he's lost his
          permission to work there until the
          investigation is complete. He must have
          been planning to re-route him in flight
          somewhere.
          
                           BASHIR
          He was going to kidnap him!
                            DAX
          Odo plans to question his aides and see
          if they had any knowledge of the
          situation. With the possibility of a
          conspiracy to kidnap charge hanging over
          them, one may talk.
          
                           BASHIR
          I'm willing to bet that he had a few
          unsavory plans for how to use  Dr. King
          once he got him out of sight. I had
          better warn Dr. King and get some
          protection for him.
          
                            DAX
          Odo has already posted a permanent guard
          on King. He also has someone watching
          Holdon, just in case.
          
                           BASHIR
                   (Stepping to the door)
          Great. I think I'll go see how King's
          doing then. Let me know if you hear back
          on the investigation. I want to know why
          it's happening.
          
                            DAX
          I'll call you as soon as it comes in.

DR. KINGS CELL

Bashir will be entering the area where King is being held.
Dr. Holdon will be in the cell with King (King will be
wearing a brown jump suit) taking readings of the progress.
A security person will be just outside of the room watching
Holdon.
                           HOLDON
          It's remarkable, I can't believe the
          amount of growth present. You have had
          no side effects of any kind?
          
                            KING
          None.
          
                           BASHIR
          According to you, he shouldn't have any.
          So I don't see why you are surprised at
          the results.
          
                           HOLDON
          I don't expect any. I just hope that
          none occur.
          
                           BASHIR
          On the way here I ran into one of your
          cohorts. It seems that you're planning
          to do an exploratory surgery to see the
          progress first hand and he wanted some
          advice.
          
                           HOLDON
          Does that surprise you?
          
                           BASHIR
          It would seem that you and your
          assistant were going to perform it
          yourself. Considering that neither one
          of you is capable of performing this
          type of surgery properly, I was
          wondering how you expected Dr. King to
          survive it.
          
                           HOLDON
          I don't. You must keep in mind the facts
          involved here. Your friend Dr. King is
          scheduled for execution tomorrow. Do you
          think I'm going to allow it without
          getting as much knowledge as possible
          first?
          
                           BASHIR
          I was under the impression that if this
          went well you were going to try to
          negotiate something to allow for the
          time to study it.
          
                            KING
                (Getting a little agitated)
          That's what I understood also.
          
                           HOLDON
          That was an assumption on your part.
                           BASHIR
          I think it was an assumption based on
          what you told us. It just seems like you
          are very willing to get this execution
          under way.

                           HOLDON
          No! This isn't supposed to happen yet!
          
                           BASHIR
          What do you mean 'yet'?
          
                           HOLDON
          It took weeks last. . . Quick, sedate
          him before the spasms get worse!
          
                           BASHIR

          Give him 30 units of Bialimine. . . now!
          
                           BASHIR
          That would kill him.
          
                           HOLDON
          The spasms will kill him, and damage the
          chip. It must be saved.
          
                           BASHIR
                 (Completing the scan and
                     preparing a shot)
          What are you trying to hide by killing
          him? We simply have another accelerated
          neurological growth. Probably stimulated
          by his agitated state. . . Both of you
          hold him down while I give him
          something.
Both Holdon and the guard will try to restrain King as
Bashir administers the shot. King will make a broad swing
that the guard will duck but catch Holdon full force,
knocking him into the wall. He will then make another swing
at the guard that he doesn't duck. He will be knocked into a
shelf or bunk and rendered unconscious. Bashir will make an
effort to administer the shot but be knocked back also. King
will stand. Getting a puzzled look on his face as he
examines his body, then looks at Bashir. King must look
bewildered, especially when he looks at Bashir. They will
make eye contact for a moment. Then King will run out the
door.

          Bashir to security, Dr. King has
          escaped. He seems to be suffering some
          kind of emotional breakdown and may be
          unaware of his actions.

          Perhaps not me, but it does concern Dr.

                           HUMAN
          Let's get her inside, quick.
          
TRACKING SHOT as they drag her into the ships lock.
          
                          FERENGI
          I hope we didn't kill her. She's strong,
          and could fetch a good price on the
          market.
                           HUMAN
          We're not here for her, we're here for
          her money. Look around, it has to be
          here somewhere.
          
                          FERENGI
                   (Looking at the ship)
          Do realize what kind of ship this is?
          This is the fastest civilian ship on the
          market. Some say it is perhaps as fast
          as the Galixy-class starship, and able
          to maintain top speed for longer. It is
          worth a fortune.
          
                           HUMAN
                        (Irritated)
          We are looking for the money.
          
                          FERENGI
          If we take the ship, we can find the
          money, sell her and the ship. I
          guarantee nothing could catch us. We
          will be far from here before they can
          even send out a ship to look for us.
          
                           HUMAN
          The ship will be to easy to trace, no
          one will buy it.
          
                          FERENGI
                  (Moving to the console)
          Perhaps they will not buy the ship, but
          they will buy its parts.
          
                           HUMAN
                        (Pondering)
          Can you fly it?
          
                          FERENGI
          Let me look.
                (Activates the control panel
                      and examines it)
          Yes, she has done most of the work for
          us. She has already preset an emergency
          escape flight plan, right through the
          wormhole.
          
                           HUMAN
                         (Annoyed)
          We don't want to go there.
          
                          FERENGI
          No, but all I have to do is defeat her
          password for launch. Once we are in
                           (MORE)

          flight we can re-route the ship easily.
          She even has it programmed to override
          the space station's security
          authorization systems. I just need a few
          minutes to defeat her password.
          
                           HUMAN
          That's all we have, so hurry.

out, then Technician Hall. Hall will move out of sight away
from the lift. King will move towards Sam's ship.

SAM'S SHIP - CABIN - FERENGI AT CONSOLE - SAME TIME

The Ferengi will be working on the console, the Human will
have just finished tying up Sam.


                          FERENGI
          That's it, I've done it. All we have to
          do is press this. . .

              (At the same moment stumbles in,
            not noticing the thieves in the room
            and leans against the wall, in pain)
          
                           HUMAN
          That's a security alert, we've been
          discovered. RUN!
          
                          FERENGI
          What do we do with her?
          
                           HUMAN
          Leave her! Let's get out!
          
Both run towards King who had not noticed them at first and
is startled. They then run past him and out the door.
          
DOCKING AREA - POV FROM LIFT AREA - SAME TIME

(Timing and positioning are critical here) Hall will be
working on a panel in an alcove across from the lift and be
on one side of the frame. He will not be able to see Sam's
ship. There will be a stack of crates next to the lift that
screen that area from seeing Sam's ship and will be on the
other side of the frame. Sam's ship door will be visible in
B.G. through the center of the frame. Lift door opens.
                        SECURITY #2
               (Stepping just out of the lift
                    and questioning Hall)
          Have you seen anyone get off the lift
          wearing a brown jump suit?
          
As Hall answers, the two thugs will run unseen across the
open area in the B.G. from Sam's ship to a hidden area
across from the ship. Three more security people come out of
the lift.
          
                         TECHNICIAN
               (Gesturing towards Sam's ship)
          Yeah! Rather creepy type, he went over
          there somewhere.
          
                        SECURITY #2
            (Going in the direction of the ship)
          Thanks!
               (Activating his communicator)
          Security this is team two, he was seen
          on this level and should still be here.
          Request accesses to this level be sealed
          off.

the area towards Sam's ship. Security #1 is about to enter
Sam's ship when he hears a noise behind some crates. He
moves to look around them.
          
                        SECURITY #1
          Over here, someone is in the air duct.
          
PAN to show duct and a shadowed figure slipping out of sight
inside. All the security people will run up to the grating
and try to open it, but it will not give.
          
                        SECURITY #2
          Security, this is team two, we've lost
          him. He somehow got into the air duct
          system and we can't follow.
          
                            ODO
          Leave one there to guard that portal.
          The rest of you get to the next level
          down and try to secure them before he
          escapes.

Rest of team runs towards the lift.
          
FLIGHT STATION - SAM'S SHIP

The flight station will be active, left that way by the two
would-be thieves. There will be a red flashing button on the
console. King will look the thing over and press a few
buttons with no luck and then see that one. He will then
cautiously press it.

                        (Voice only)
          Station log, Commander Sisko reporting.
          It's been four days now since Ms. Ryan's
          ship crossed into the wormhole. By the
          time we could get a chase ship through
          to follow, her ship was well out of
          sensor range. With the execution of Dr.
          King not completed, the Pal are very
          distressed, and there is nothing I can
          do. I received an anonymous message that
          Dr. Holdon is about to leave on a
          freighter. My guess is that Quark was
          the one who sent it. I've asked Dr
          Holdon to come to my office before his
          departure.
          
SISKO'S OFFICE - POV SISKO

There will be two security men on each side of the door.
Also present will be Odo, Sisko, and Bashir.

                           HOLDON
                          (Enters)
          You called for me?
          
                           SISKO
          Have a seat.
          
                           HOLDON
                   (Noticing the guards)
          I feel as though I should stand, thank
          you.
          
                           SISKO
          My people have brought some interesting
          facts to my attention. And these facts
          bring me to some even more interesting
          questions and conclusions that I need to
          discuss with you.
                           HOLDON
          Such as?
          
                           SISKO
          Such as, why you are under investigation
          by the Federation for ethics violations?
          And since you have been banned from
          using the labs at Earth Research
          Complex, where were you planning to take
          Dr. King when you left?
          
                           HOLDON
          I don't need to answer any of your
          questions.
          
                           BASHIR
          What are they investigating you for?
          
                           HOLDON
                      (Arrogant tone)
          Ethics investigation, not criminal. That
          does not give you the authority to hold
          me. Now if you will let me catch my
          ship. . . though I do hate these space-
          available flights on freighters.
          Quarters are poor, and no services of
          any kind.
          
                           BASHIR
          Willing to take what you can for a quick
          getaway?
          
                           SISKO
          Our inquiries to the Federation sparked
          some interest. They were not aware that
          one of the chips still existed. They
          were under the impression that the one
          was destroyed while you where attempting
          to open it. And the other was destroyed
          in a freak accident that they still
          can't explain.
          
                            ODO
          An accident that killed one of your
          assistants. Tragic loss. . . so tragic
          that you didn't even stay around for the
          funeral.
          
                           HOLDON
          You still have nothing to hold me for.
          
                           SISKO
          I'm afraid that is where you're wrong.
          When they got wind of what you where
          doing out here, they decided that they
                           (MORE)
                        SISKO (Cont)
          could take some action. It may not be
          much, yet, but they've authorized us to
          hold you for the theft of the chip until
          they can finish reviewing the records of
          your research.
          
                           HOLDON
          They don't have any records. They were
          wiped clean by the assistant who died in
          the accident. He was stealing a chip he
          had in his possession.
          
                            ODO
          It would seem that he copied all of the
          files to a separate database. The only
          reason it's taking this long is that he
          encrypted them and took other measures
          to keep you from finding and deleting
          the files. They have assured me that
          they've broken the guards, and will be
          pressing other charges soon.
          
                           HOLDON
          You're bluffing, there was no way I
          missed any files.
          
                           SISKO
          One of your assistants here told us
          where to find them and is willing to
          tell us more as soon as all the files
          have been recovered. . . I would offer
          you a deal if you talked and saved the
          investigators some time. Perhaps they
          would have gone easy on you, but I don't
          think that's an option anymore.
          
                           BASHIR
          Seems like you don't get the quick,
          painless way out like you offered King.
          Or are you getting just what you offered
          him? To suffer to the bitter end.
          
                           HOLDON
                       (Sit, somber)
          He's not suffering.
          
                           BASHIR
          I suppose he is dead by now.
          
                           HOLDON
          No. . .  well. . . in a matter of
          speaking yes. By now he will be gone,
          his consciousness replaced by another.
                           SISKO
          What do you mean?
          
                           HOLDON
          That chip is a lot more than it seems.
          It's not just the alien's data storage
          device, it contains his conscious soul.
          Once it's implanted it grows pathways to
          connect to the brain's higher functions.
          It actually takes control of the brain.
          
                           BASHIR
          You killed your assistant to keep him
          from stealing one, just so you could
          steal one yourself?
          
                           HOLDON
          I didn't kill him, not intentionally
          anyway. Besides. . . he was dead
          already. He was not stealing the chip. .
          . he was the chip.

          He planted one of the chips in him
          against his will!
          
                           HOLDON
          Not against his will, he was as
          fascinated with it as I was. He wanted
          to have it done. At the time we still
          thought it was just a storage device.
          
                           BASHIR
          Why the spasms?
          
                           HOLDON
          The subject has spasms when the chip
          makes its final connection to the higher
          functions and takes total control of the
          brain. It takes it a few hours for it to
          get orientated after that. Once the
          other one did, it gained access to the
          learning programs in my computers and
          mastered communication skills in just a
          few days. It was remarkable. . .
          Consciousness at the speed of a
          computer. Total recall of anything it
          read, heard, or saw, yet with all of the
          functions and emotions of the brain.
          
                            ODO
          Why did you kill him?
                           HOLDON
          It was an accident, he was escaping
          through the transporter. I just tried to
          divert him to a holding cell, but I
          failed to maintain control and lost him.
          
                           SISKO
          Why did he need to escape? He should
          have been turned over to the Federation.
          They could have helped him adjust to his
          surroundings and allowed him his
          freedom.
          
                           HOLDON
          I was going to remove the chip and he
          refused to accept it. I didn't realize
          how much he had learned in that short
          time. He learned to bypass the security
          systems, and while I was preparing the
          surgery he escaped. He had already
          reached the transporters when I found
          him.
          
                            ODO
          What where you going to do with it
          anyway?
          
                           HOLDON
          I had planned to learn how to reproduce
          it. Use it to enhance our brain's
          capacity.
          
                           BASHIR
          When your assistant came and asked my
          advice about the removal and biopsy he
          made a remark that he wouldn't explain.
          Now I get what he meant. . . He said 'He
          didn't want to help in your quest for
          immortality.' You intended to try and
          erase the chip so you could implant
          yourself in it. You had to kill King
          before the chip took hold to keep us
          from knowing the truth. You needed to
          learn more before you tried it on
          yourself.
          
                           HOLDON
          It is a moot point now, both chips are
          gone.
          
                            KIRA
                 (Voice only over intercom)
          Commander, a Xebec class ship has just
          emerged from the wormhole. It would seem
          that Ms. Ryan is well and at the
          controls. . . She and Dr. King have
          asked to speak with you as soon as she
          docks.
                           SISKO
          Ask her if it is actually Dr. King. I
          think she'll catch the reference.
          
                            KIRA
                      (After a pause)
          She says it is the actual Dr. King.
          She's asking that you meet her ship and
          she'll explain everything then.
          
                           SISKO
          Shall we go everyone?
                   (Standing, then pause)
          Oh yes, why don't we put Dr. Holdon here
          in restraints so he doesn't get any
          ideas about escaping.

          Ah, Dr. Holdon, how nice of you to come
          and see me. Come in everyone, we have

          It's good to see you're both safe. We
          were starting to get a bit worried.
          
                            SAM
          We're fine, a lot has happened in the
          last few days. I know there's a lot to
          explain, but before anyone asks any
          questions, you should see this first.
          
Sam will turn to face the view screen and activate it. The
image of Dr. King sitting in the same chair that Sam is in
now will appear on the screen.
                        KING (Aaros)
          My name is Aaros. For some reason my
          central processor has been removed from
          my body and placed in this alien one. I
          am not certain why this has happened,
          but I can not consciously take the life
          that should inhabit it. So I am closing
          all of my operational functions before
          the transformation becomes irreversible.
          I have left instructions in this file to
          allow your medical staff to reverse the
          process. I have also left instructions
          on how I would wish my funeral
          arrangements as you term them. Ms. Ryan
          has assured me that they will be carried
          out. I have no wish to die, but have a
          moral obligation to return this body.
                          (Pause)
          There was a great deal of damage to my
          memory banks because of the extended
          time that my systems were inactive. The
          damage is mostly in my technical banks.
          This data area is nearly completely
          erased. Other areas have partial loss. .
          . I have searched the available
          Federation files for references to my
          race but have found none, so I believe
          you have a great deal of questions to
          ask about us. Ms. Ryan has explained to
          me that your Federation is a peaceful
          organization and has convinced me to
          give what information I can regarding
          myself and my race. I have only one
          request in exchange. . . Please bring
          the names of our dead back to be
          remembered at our home. . . if it is
          found. This remembrance is the final
          step in our funeral rites. I have listed
          the names of all on board my ship for
          this purpose. Finally I must apologize
          for the trouble I have caused in my
          escape. I was confused and did not know
          what to do. I hope I did not hurt
          anyone.
          
          Aaros, Commander of the ship Trazol. . .
          Good bye.
          
As the view screen clicks off Sam will turn to the rest and
speak.
          
                            SAM
          Two thieves attacked me, apparently
          planning to steal my ship and he
          interrupted them. He nursed me back to
          health while we were in flight.
                           BASHIR
          He learned the language very quickly.
          
                            SAM
          When I woke up he was pouring over the
          computer stations. His language wasn't
          the best then, but he was learning. In
          the next few days, with a little help,
          he perfected it.
          
                           HOLDON
          I don't understand why he gave up King's
          body. That seems to be why the chip was
          made.
          
                            KING
          Their race doesn't use the chip to gain
          immortality. When the body of a person
          is dying the chip is removed and passed
          on to their child. They then surrender
          the pathways of the device to their
          offspring after helping them to learn
          how to use the chip. The data is
          maintained for the use of the child,
          only the former consciousness fades
          along with any strictly personal
          memories. This basically eliminates the
          need for a great deal of schooling, and
          gives the child the accumulated
          knowledge of his ancestors to draw from.
          It makes for very close ties between
          parents and children.
          
                            SAM
          He's a very good person and deserves
          better than what he is getting.
          
                           SISKO
          So it would seem, but I wonder. If the
          chip survived this long with his mind
          intact, why won't it survive until some
          other option could be found.
          
                            SAM
          The chip has a small power cell inside
          that maintains the memory circuits and
          powers the growth. It's been drained to
          the point that he couldn't survive the
          transfer. The only way for the cell to
          recharge is for him to finish linking
          with King. But that would wipe out
          King's consciousness forever.
                            KING
          If the chip had been planted correctly
          we would have been able to co-exist
          until it re-charged. Dr. Holdon
          apparently needed me to figure out how
          it was supposed to be placed.
          
A somber bit of silence among them.
          
                            KING
          Do you remember the discussion we had
          Commander?
          
                           SISKO
          About your circle of friends?
          
                            KING
          Traditions call for me to surrender
          myself and receive the punishment
          ordered, even if the time has passed.
          It's a matter of not dishonoring the
          circle, and accepting the punishment.
          
                           SISKO
          Do you want to return to the planet?
          
                            KING
          Not exactly. I was offered an alternate
          death sentence, that being to take part
          in this experiment. I chose to have it
          continue. I chose to die by surrendering
          my body to Aaros. If I'm to die, why not
          let him live.
          
                           BASHIR
          You heard him, he can't take your body.
          
                            KING
          He chose not to take my body. He didn't
          know I would give it.
          
                            SAM
          How can we re-activate it? You saw the
          tape. He  shut down the chip.
          
                            KING
          I seem to remember Dr. Bashir saying
          that the growth was stimulated by my
          emotional agitation, or as it were, the
          accelerated chemical and electrical
          activity it caused in my brain. That was
          the last thing I heard before he took
          over my mind. . . If that condition
          could be stimulated in me again then
          perhaps it would reactivate.

          We are about to stimulate Dr. King's
          brain and its chemical activity in hopes
          that it will activate the chip implant.
          Dr. King has left a message to the Pal
          people of his decision. Commander Sisko
          and Major Kira are here to act as
          witnesses. . . This is another one for
          the moral dilemma category. . . Am I
          killing Dr. King, or saving Aaros? And
          is Aaros alive. . . Dr. King has been
          convincing me that this is what he
          wants. If I don't do this he insists he
          must go back to the planet and be
          executed by their methods. . . I don't
          cherish the thought of that on my
          conscience. . . I have set control drugs
          to allow for the transition to be
          painless for Dr. King. . . Dr. Holdon is
          here at the request of Dr. King. King
          says as a witness, but I don't think
          that's the reason why.

          It would seem that Dr. King no longer
          has a use for it, and wants you to have
          it.

          Dr. King learned how to access my memory

          explaining the situation.
                       (Brief Pause)
          And he left a message for Dr. Holdon. .

          Holdon wanted, but turned it down.

          The Federation stopped it and parked it
          here. They put a beacon on it to allow
          ships to get their navigation aligned
          instantly upon their arrival through.
          They also made it a shrine. Both to

          I'm glad for the chance to say goodbye
          to them, but I have no idea what I'll do
          now. I have no home, no family.

          I've discussed that with Commander Sisko
          and he agrees. You could join me as part
