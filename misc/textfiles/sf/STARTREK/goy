Last year, Eric Klien worked with me to help me take a story idea
that I had and turn it into a script that we could submit to Paramount
for consideration.  As those of you who've seen the posting of the
rejection letter in RASI are already aware, it was turned down.  I
thought that some of you might find it interesting to read a fan
script that was actually read by Paramount.  You can make your own
judgements as to how well it compares to stories that have been
selected for use and airing.  Because only a small percentage of sites
are able to receive alt.startrek.creative, I will post it in
rec.arts.startrek as well, but to avoid posting a single large file
all at once (and to drag things out interminably for those who want
to know how it ends! :-) I will be posting the script one act at a
time at about one act per week (or maybe slightly faster).  So,
without further ado, here begins, for your enjoyment `The Ghosts of
Yesteryear.'

           STAR TREK:  THE NEXT GENERATION

              "The Ghosts of Yesteryear"

                              TEASER

FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

The Enterprise is orbiting a blue-green planet below.

                    PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Log, Stardate 44103.9.
          We are in orbit around Alpha
          Centauri where the Enterprise has
          come for a much needed rest and
          relaxation period.  We have made
          full use of the time off to
          regenerate sagging spirits and
          tired bodies.  I almost feel,
          though, that our time here has
          been too short.


INT. TURBOLIFT

PICARD and RIKER are present.

                    PICARD
          You should have been there to see
          it, Will!
               (beat)
          It was near the end of the final
          chukker and the match was tied.
          There were three defenders between
          myself and the goal.  I lined up
          to shoot, but instead I tapped the
          ball beneath my mount to Smythe,
          who made a clean shot on goal.
          They never had a chance to block
          it.  Ah, Number One, it was
          exhilarating!

                    RIKER
          Better than the match you played
          on the holodeck last week?

                    PICARD
          The holodeck's a fine toy, but
          nothing can quite take the place
          of reality.  To strive against
          real players with real horses is
          infinitely more satisfying in the
          long run.

The turbolift comes to a stop and opens onto the
bridge, where everyone is present except BEVERLY and
WESLEY.  Picard and Riker step out.

                    WORF
          Captain, I'm receiving a Priority
          message for you from Starfleet
          Central.  It's from Admiral
          Raintree and it's marked Captain's
          Eyes Only.

                    PICARD
          Thank you, Lieutenant.  I'll take
          it in my ready room.

Picard exits the bridge.  Riker sits down in the
center seat, next to Counselor Troi.

                    RIKER
               (to Troi)
          I hope it isn't anything serious.
          It's been too long since I've seen
          the Captain relaxed and enjoying
          himself.

                    TROI
          I agree.  The Captain tends to let
          the stress of his job build up
          inside of him.  He so rarely has
          an opportunity to just relax and
          be a person like everyone else.

                    RIKER
          It sometimes seems like the
          Captain actually thrives on
          stress.

                    TROI
          Still, he needs to leave it behind
          from time to time.

Picard reenters the bridge.  He looks pale and
disturbed.

                    TROI
               (to Riker)
          Something's very wrong.

                    RIKER
          Even a non-Betazoid can tell that,
          Counselor.

                    PICARD
          Number One, please call Doctor and
          Ensign Crusher to the bridge.
               (beat)
          The message and the mission we've
          been given portends of difficult
          times ahead for the Enterprise and
          her cap--- her crew.
               (slight pause)
          The Crushers are particularly
          affected by this and will need to
          be aware of what's transpiring.
          Please review the message with
          them and the senior staff, then
          come see me.

Picard is heading towards the turbolift.

                    RIKER
          Of course, Captain.  Where will
          you be?

The turbolift doors close.


EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

Still orbiting the planet below.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

Everyone but Picard is present.  Riker signals to Worf
who puts Admiral Raintree on screen.  The Admiral is
an elderly woman of Native American ancestry.  Her jet
black hair has begun to take on a salt and pepper
look.

                    RAINTREE
          Hello, Jean-Luc.  Your bridge crew
          will need to hear this, but I owed
          you the privilege of hearing it
          first.  About two weeks ago, a
          Tyrolean Swifter on a special run
          found itself passing near the
          Anjinn star system.  They'd been
          having communications troubles,
          and were performing tests when
          they intercepted a beacon signal
          in the old light speed bands.  The
          time stamp in that signal was only
          five years old.
               (beat)
          Considering the delicate nature of
          this issue, I wanted you to be the
          one to investigate.  Be careful,
          Jean-Luc.  You know what happened
          the last time a Federation ship
          was in that area.

Viewscreen goes off.

                    RIKER
          I suppose I should already know,
          but what's so special about the
          Anjinn system?

                    BEVERLY
          Ten years ago, Captain Picard was
          in command of the science vessel
          Beagle on an Academy training
          mission to the Anjinn star system.
          During the mission, the Beagle was
          attacked and forced to defend
          herself.  When it was over, there
          was a single casualty -- Science
          Officer John Andrew Crusher.

                    RIKER
          Starfleet couldn't think this
          message means your husband is
          still alive out there.

                    WESLEY
          I don't see how they could.  I saw
          them bury my father.

                    BEVERLY
          I'm afraid, Wesley, all you saw
          was an empty casket.  The burial
          was a symbolic gesture on the part
          of Starfleet.

                    RIKER
          There was a Starfleet cover-up?

                    BEVERLY
          There was no attempt to hide the
          truth.  But there was no attempt
          to publicize it either.  Wesley,
          you were too young to understand
          the difference, and I never could
          bring myself to tell you the
          truth.

                    WESLEY
               (quietly, to himself)
          I can't believe she lied to me!

                    RIKER
          Helm, plot a course for the Anjinn
          system.  Be ready to leave orbit
          on the Captain's orders.
          Computer, where is the Captain?

                    COMPUTER VOICE
          Captain Picard is in holodeck
          four.

                    DATA
          Commander, may I join you?

Riker waves for Data to join him.  They leave the
bridge.

                    BEVERLY
          Wesley, we need to talk.

                    WESLEY
          You should have talked to me about
          this years ago.  Right now, I need
          to think about things to myself.

Beverly starts to speak but pauses, then leaves the
bridge.  After she leaves, Wesley also leaves.

                                             FADE OUT.

              "The Ghosts of Yesteryear"

                             ACT ONE

FADE IN:

INT. MAIN BRIDGE

Geordi is sitting next to counselor Troi.

                    GEORDI
          Do you think Jack Crusher could
          still be alive out there?

                    TROI
          I don't know, but someone had to
          send that message.

                    GEORDI
          Could a man survive alone for ten
          years?

                    TROI
          We don't know that he has.  The
          message was five years old.

                    GEORDI
          I'd go crazy if I found myself all
          alone with nothing to do for even
          five years.

                    TROI
          You'd be surprised what a person
          can endure when necessary.
          Survival is the strongest instinct
          there is in humans, as well as in
          many other species.  Remember when
          you were trapped on Galornden
          Core?

                    GEORDI
          I was only on the planet for a few
          hours, and I wasn't alone.

                    TROI
          Ten years IS a long time for a man
          to live with no one but himself
          for company.  If we do find Jack
          Crusher alive, he may not be the
          man who was left behind.

                    WORF
          When the Romulans attacked
          Kittemar and left me to die, I
          survived without adverse effect.

                    GEORDI
          You'd just come through the middle
          of a war zone, Worf.  And you'd
          just seen your parents killed.
          That couldn't help but affect you.

                    TROI
          Jack's experience was much the
          same.  He'd been through a battle,
          and just as the Captain assumed
          that Jack had been killed, for all
          Jack knew, the Beagle had been
          destroyed and the Captain killed.

                    GEORDI
          It must be hard on the Captain,
          knowing he may have to confront a
          man he abandoned like that.

                    TROI
          Though I've sensed some guilt from
          the Captain, he knows what command
          responsibility means, and he knew
          it then.  He'll be fine.

                    GEORDI
          Well, I certainly don't envy him
          right now.

                    TROI
          Nor do I.

                    WORF
          A true warrior always finds
          strength through adversity.


INT. CORRIDOR

Riker and Data are walking from the turbolift to
holodeck four.

                    DATA
          Commander, do you believe this
          transmission came from Commander
          Crusher?

                    RIKER
          I think if Starfleet and Captain
          Picard didn't believe it possible,
          the Captain wouldn't have looked
          so upset.

                    DATA
          I do not believe I have ever seen
          the Captain so disturbed.  Do you
          think he will be all right?

                    RIKER
          We'll know in a minute, Data.

They arrive at the holodeck entrance.

                    RIKER
          Computer, request permission to
          enter holodeck.

                    COMPUTER VOICE
          Simulation is not secured.
               (beat)
          You may enter when ready.

Riker and Data look at each other briefly then enter
the holodeck.


INT. HOLODECK

It is a recreation area filled with gymnastic
equipment, duotronic games, and a small juice bar to
the side.  Seated alone at a small table by the bar is
Picard, nursing a pulpy orange colored drink.

                    RIKER
          This looks like the Rec Bar at the
          Academy.

                    PICARD
          It is, Number One.  I suppose I
          wanted to be in an old familiar
          place to think about the past.

                    DATA
          No people, Captain?

                    PICARD
          At the time, Data, I felt more
          like being alone with my thoughts.

Picard swirls the juice in his glass and takes a sip.

                    RIKER
          It's not like you to brood,
          Captain.

                    PICARD
          Being reminded of the death of my
          closest friend is not something I
          have to deal with every day,
          Number One.  Jack Crusher and I
          spent a lot of time here going
          through the Academy together.
               (beat)
          It's also where Jack and I spent
          our last few planet bound hours
          before leaving on his final
          mission.

                    RIKER
          I'm afraid I'm not as familiar
          with the details of that mission
          as I should be.  What happened out
          there?

                    PICARD
          It was just after the Stargazer
          had been lost in battle.  There
          was a hearing to determine the
          extent of my culpability, and I
          was exonerated.  They even ended
          up giving me a bloody medal for
          bravery, though I never felt
          comfortable with that decision.

                    DATA
          Starfleet does not bestow
          citations without reason, Captain.

                    PICARD
          Afterward, I was given command of
          the SS Beagle for a cadet training
          mission to the Hirgato sector.  We
          were to identify and study the
          source of Beckett waves coming
          from there.

                    RIKER
          You were exonerated, yet they only
          gave you a small science vessel on
          a cadet training mission?

                    PICARD
          There were no ships of the line
          available at that time.

                    RIKER
          Jack Crusher was also assigned to
          the mission?

                    PICARD
          Jack was at the Academy, giving a
          guest lecture series on the
          quadrature variant of the
          superstring theory.  I knew he had
          an interest in Beckett waves, and
          I needed a good Science Officer so
          I asked him to join me.  That was
          my first of several decisions that
          would ultimately lead to his
          death.

Picard pauses for a moment, looking at his drink.

                    RIKER
          But he may not really be dead,
          according to Starfleet.

                    PICARD
          We had no way of knowing that at
          the time.  Upon arriving at the
          Hirgato sector, we localized the
          source of the Beckett waves as
          coming from the Anjinn star
          system.  Jack wanted to get some
          preliminary measurements away from
          the ship to avoid the interference
          produced by the warp chamber.  He
          took a shuttle craft out, away
          from the ship, and was setting up
          his instruments when it came.

                    RIKER
          It?

                    PICARD
          The Ghost ship.  It came upon us
          without warning.

                    DATA
          A ghost ship, Captain?

                    PICARD
          A figure of speech, Mr. Data.  We
          could see the ship on visual, but
          none of the other ship's sensors
          could pick it up.

                    RIKER
          The ship was cloaked and yet it
          didn't affect visual sensors?

                    PICARD
          You can't assume all alien
          technology is either better or
          worse than ours, Number One.
          Sometimes, it's just different.
          When you come across the
          different, you take precautions.
          I signaled to Jack to pack up and
          get back as quickly as he could,
          and I ordered shields raised just
          to be safe.  An overly eager cadet
          energized ship's phasers as well.

                    RIKER
          And the mysterious ship sensed
          that and attacked you?

                    PICARD
          Yes.  It wasn't a strong attack,
          really only a good shaking.  But
          those cadets were just children,
          they weren't prepared for battle.
          I suppose after the Stargazer, I
          wasn't much in the mood myself.
               (beat)
          I'd wanted to wait for Jack to get
          back but there wasn't enough time.
          So I ordered a tractor beam locked
          onto the shuttle and we left as
          quickly as we could without losing
          tractor lock.

                    DATA
          Pulling a shuttle craft in tractor
          lock, even at low warp, is highly
          unusual, Captain.

                    PICARD
          It was a calculated risk.  One
          unfortunately that failed.  The
          Ghost ship came after us.  They
          fired again, stronger this time.
               (beat)
          I knew we weren't going to escape
          cleanly so I ordered the phasers
          fired at the enemy vessel.
          Apparently, we scored a lucky blow
          because the viewscreen was filled
          with a blinding flash of light.
          When the smoke cleared, so to
          speak, they were gone.

                    RIKER
          The Ghost ship?

                    PICARD
          The Ghost ship, and the shuttle.
          Ship's sensors were damaged and we
          had only limited visual
          capability.  We searched for
          nearly a full day but without
          luck.  We finally had no other
          choice but to return to Starbase.

                    RIKER
          And so you had to leave your
          friend behind, not knowing if he
          was alive or dead.

                    PICARD
          But knowing that if he wasn't
          dead, he likely soon would be.
          Which is why Starfleet declared
          him dead and ordered a memorial
          service.  They didn't want too
          many people asking too many
          questions right after the
          Stargazer incident.

Picard picks up his drink and swirls its contents.

                    PICARD
               (continuing)
          I've often wondered if things
          would have turned out differently
          if I'd waited just the minute or
          two longer it would have taken for
          Jack to get safely back to the
          Beagle.  The first attack wasn't
          that severe.  Perhaps if we'd
          waited; if I'd tried to reason
          with the other ship instead of
          fight.  Perhaps ...

                    RIKER
          You can't let the ghosts of the
          past continue to haunt you,
          Captain.  You can't change what
          happened.

                    PICARD
          No, but I mustn't fail to let it
          teach me how to deal with the
          future either, Number One.

                    RIKER
          I've had a course laid in for the
          Hirgato sector.  It's waiting only
          your orders to proceed.  But we
          don't have to go.  Admiral
          Raintree gave you the opportunity
          to answer the call.  She didn't
          order you to.

                    PICARD
          No, Number One.  A good captain
          not only must never second guess a
          decision once made, he must also
          be able to face up to the
          consequences of that decision and
          never run from the
          responsibilities it entails.  We
          will go.

                    PICARD
               (downing the remaining liquid)
          Now, I think it's best we all get
          back to work.

Riker nods and they all leave.

                                             FADE OUT.

                          END OF ACT ONE

FADE IN:

INT. TEN FORWARD

Wesley is seated at a table near the windows looking
out at the stars going by.  Troi enters and comes over
to him.

                    TROI
          Need some company?

                    WESLEY
          Can we talk?

                    TROI
          You should be talking to your
          mother.

                    WESLEY
          I can't talk to my mother about
          this.  Not after what she did.

                    TROI
          You know you're going to have to
          talk to her eventually, Wes.

                    WESLEY
          Even if she hadn't lied to me, I
          still don't think I could talk to
          her now.  It's too personal.

Troi sits down with Wesley.

                    TROI
          Then tell me all about it.

                    WESLEY
          I hardly ever talk about him, and
          I guess I never really knew how to
          express it to him, but I did love
          my father.  He was my role model
          for wanting to learn all about the
          sciences.

                    TROI
          Your father was a great scientist,
          Wes.  He was an inspiration to
          many people.

                    WESLEY
          Captain Picard was a close friend
          to both my parents, but he would
          always avoid me when he came to
          visit.  I had to sneak around so I
          could hear him tell my parents all
          sorts of wonderful tales of space.
          It was the Captain that gave me
          the desire to serve on board a
          Starship.

                    TROI
          And then, one day...

                    WESLEY
          My father told us he had the
          opportunity to serve on a mission
          with Captain Picard.  I never saw
          him again after that.  And until I
          came aboard the Enterprise, I only
          saw Captain Picard one other time.

                    TROI
          When he came to bring the news of
          your father's death.

                    WESLEY
          It felt like someone had kicked me
          in the stomach.  At first I hated
          the Captain for bringing the news,
          and I blamed him for killing my
          father.  It was a very long time
          before I understood it really
          wasn't his fault.

                    TROI
          And now that word has come that
          your father might still be alive
          out there somewhere, all those old
          feelings have returned.

                    WESLEY
          I feel like I should be looking
          forward to seeing my father again,
          but instead all I feel is a sense
          of dread and fear.  Why is that?

                    TROI
          Wesley, how old were you when your
          father disappeared?

                    WESLEY
          Eight.

                    TROI
          And how long ago was that?

                    WESLEY
          About ten years.

                    TROI
          Wesley, you've lived more years
          since your father left than you
          knew him before.  That's a long
          time.
               (beat)
          Remember back to the year your
          mother spent at Starfleet while
          you stayed here on the Enterprise?
          How did you feel when she came
          back after that year?

                    WESLEY
          A little strange, I guess.  I was
          glad to see her back, but I felt
          awkward around her for awhile.

                    TROI
          Exactly!  Wes, when we love
          someone very much and we don't see
          them for awhile, it's a little
          strange seeing them again for the
          first time.  You don't feel
          strange around your mother
          anymore, do you?

                    WESLEY
          No.  In some ways, we're closer
          than we've ever been.  At least I
          thought so until today.

                    TROI
          The same thing will happen with
          your father, if we find him.  But
          it's going to be harder for you
          because you were much younger when
          he left and it's been a much
          longer time since you've seen him.

                    WESLEY
          I think I understand, but I'm not
          sure.

                    TROI
          It's all right to be confused.
          Just don't let it get in the way
          of living your life.

Wesley stands up.

                    WESLEY
          Thanks.

                    TROI
          You really should talk to your
          mother, Wes.

Wesley nods and leaves the room.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

                    DATA
          Entering the Hirgato Sector now,
          Captain.  I am receiving the
          beacon signal, originating from
          the second planet in the Anjinn
          system.

                    PICARD
          Estimated time to orbit?

                    DATA
          Five minutes.

                    PICARD
          Very good.  Please notify me in
          the transporter room when we make
          orbit.  Worf, Counselor, you will
          accompany me to the surface of the
          planet.

Picard glances at Riker out of the corner of his eye,
but Riker merely looks back at him with an expression
that clearly says "I'm not about to argue you on this
one, Captain."

                    PICARD
          Wesley, if you'll call your mother
          to the transporter room, the two
          of you will be joining us as well.

                    WESLEY
          I'll notify my mother, Captain,
          but I think I'd rather stay on
          board.

Picard starts to say something, but Counselor Troi
puts her hand on his arm and speaks softly so that
only he can hear.

                    TROI
          It's alright, Captain, he's just
          not ready yet.

                    PICARD
          Very well.  Data, I want every
          visual sensor on full sweep.  I
          don't want any surprises like the
          last time I was here.

                    DATA
               (pressing controls on his panel)
          Aye, sir.

Picard and the rest of the away team leave the bridge.


INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

The away team and CHIEF O'BRIEN are present.  Beverly
is just entering the room.

                    BEVERLY
          I don't know why I bothered to try
          to make myself look more
          presentable.  It didn't do any
          good.

                    PICARD
               (matter-of-factly)
          Don't worry.  You look beautiful.

                    BEVERLY
          Really?

                    O'BRIEN
          Captain, I'm reading a small
          structure at the source of the
          beacon.  I can put you down behind
          a small rise nearby.

                    PICARD
          Very good.  Energize!


EXT. GRASSLANDS

This is a semi-barren world, with mostly scrub for
vegetation.

                    WORF
               (studying tricorder)
          This way.

They go around the small rise.  Picard and Worf lead,
with Beverly and Troi behind.  In front of them is a
small white hut glistening in the bright sunlight.
Next to it, about twenty feet away, is a small garden
plot with corn, tomatoes, beans and other fresh
vegetables growing in neat little rows.  The hut has
an open doorway but it is too dark to see inside.

                    PICARD
          Hello, in the hut, is anyone
          there?

                    JACK
               (from inside the hut)
          I know that voice!

A man appearing to be in his mid-fifties emerges from
the open doorway, squinting and shading his eyes with
his hand.

                    JACK
          Jean-Luc?  Is that you?  Could it
          really be you after all these
          years?

                    PICARD
          Jack?  Jack Crusher?

                    JACK
          My God!  It IS you!  It's been so
          long I'd given up hope anyone
          would ever hear my signal.
               (beat)
          I lost the subspace radio when I
          crashed but I was able to patch up
          a lightspeed transmitter attached
          to a marker buoy I found in
          storage.  I was afraid I'd die of
          old age before anyone heard it.
          Yet, here you are.  And what of
          Beverly?  Have you kept up with
          her, Jean-Luc?  Do you know how
          she's been doing?

                    PICARD
          I think there's someone else who
          should answer that question for
          you.

Beverly steps forward.

                    JACK
          Beverly?

Beverly runs toward him.

                    BEVERLY
          Jack!

They embrace and kiss.

                    PICARD
               (quietly)
          Counselor, what do your empathic
          skills tell you about this man?

                    TROI
          Considering what he must have gone
          through these last ten years,
          everything he's feeling now is
          completely normal, and completely
          human.

                    JACK
          How?  Why are you here?

                    BEVERLY
          I've been serving under Captain
          Picard, off and on, as Chief
          Medical Officer aboard the
          Starship Enterprise for a little
          over three years now.

Jack gives a brief glance to Picard, then turns back
to Beverly again.

                    JACK
          What about Wesley?  Is he alright?
          What's he been up to?  He must be,
          what, eighteen or nineteen by now?

                    BEVERLY
          He's on board the ship, Jack.
          He's serving as an ensign on the
          Enterprise.  He's done so many
          things and learned so much, Jack,
          you'll be very proud of him.

                    JACK
          He's on the ship?  Why didn't he
          come with you, Bev?  I want to see
          him!

                    BEVERLY
          Be patient, Jack, this whole thing
          has been very hard on Wes.  Just
          give him a little time and a
          little space and I know he'll come
          around.

                    JACK
          Captain, I'd like to leave for the
          ship now, if you don't mind.  I'll
          come back and gather the things I
          want to take with me before we
          leave orbit.  Do we need to leave
          right away?

                    PICARD
          You know what happened the last
          time we were here, but I suppose
          we can stay for a little while.
          The Enterprise should be able to
          give a much better showing of
          herself than we were able to with
          the Beagle.

INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

Wesley, Riker, and O'Brien are here.

                    WESLEY
          I don't know.  I'm still not sure
          this was a good idea.

                    RIKER
          Come on Wes, you're going to have
          to face him sooner or later.

                    O'BRIEN
          You're lucky to have known your
          father.  Mine was lost in the
          Lamdovan Riots before I was born.
          My very pregnant mother barely
          managed to get on the last
          transport out and she wasn't able
          to bring anything with her, not
          even a single picture of my dad.

                    RIKER
          A second chance isn't something to
          throw away, Wes.  They don't come
          along that often.  I nearly lost
          the one chance I had to make
          things right again with my father,
          but I finally came to my senses.
          Don't throw away this opportunity.

                    WESLEY
               (tapping head)
          I know here what you guys are
          trying to tell me.
               (placing hand over heart)
          But I just don't feel it here yet.
          I promise you, though, I won't let
          myself lose it.

                    PICARD'S COM VOICE
          Enterprise, five to beam up.

                    O'BRIEN
          Acknowledged.

The away team and Jack are beamed up.

                    JACK
          Wesley?  Is that you?

Wesley just stands there.

                    BEVERLY
          Yes, Jack, this is our son.

                    JACK
          Wesley, just look at you!  You've
          grown into such a fine young man.
          Come greet your long lost father.

Wesley just stands there.

                    BEVERLY
          Wes!  The least you could do is
          say hello to your father.

                    WESLEY
          I lost my father ten years ago.  I
          don't think I can just welcome him
          back like nothing happened.  This
          man is a stranger to me.

                    BEVERLY
          Wes!

                    JACK
          It's alright, Bev.  I've waited
          ten years, I can wait a little
          longer.
               (to Wesley)
          Wesley, although I'm still your
          father, I guess you really have no
          reason to think of me that way.
          If you're not quite ready to deal
          with that and to accept me back, I
          can live with that, for awhile.

                    BEVERLY
          In the mean time, Jack Crusher,
          I'm going to get you to sickbay
          where I plan to give you a
          thorough, and long overdue,
          checkup.

                    PICARD
          I'm afraid that will have to wait,
          Doctor.  I want to convene a
          debriefing session before we leave
          orbit, and I'm not sure I want to
          stay any longer than necessary.
          Do you feel up to it, Jack?

                    JACK
          I'm a little beat but I'd rather
          get it over with so I can spend
          some serious time sleeping and
          being with my family without
          interruptions!

Jack turns and winks at his wife.  Everyone but
Beverly and Wesley leaves the room.

                    BEVERLY
          You may be a Starfleet officer,
          young man, but that doesn't excuse
          you from being rude.  How can you
          treat your father like that?

                    WESLEY
          How can you act like the last ten
          years never happened?  I can't
          just pretend things are the way
          they were before.

                    BEVERLY
          If I've learned one thing in life,
          it's that you can't depend on
          things going the way you want.
          Time is too precious a thing to
          waste, and now that I've got your
          father back, I'm not going to run
          the risk of losing him again.

Beverly turns and leaves the room leaving Wesley
standing there.

                                             FADE OUT.

                          END OF ACT TWO

                            ACT THREE

FADE IN:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

Everyone including Jack is present.

                    PICARD
          After the destruction of the
          unknown vessel, we retraced our
          path and spent a full day
          searching for you before we were
          forced to give up.

                    JACK
          When you first started dragging me
          out with the tractor beam, I
          honestly thought you were crazy.
          I had barely enough time to try to
          hold on with bare knuckles.  When
          the ship came after us and opened
          fire the second time, I was thrown
          from the seat, struck my head and
          blacked out.

                    RIKER
          Then you had no idea what had
          happened with the Beagle?

                    JACK
          When I came to, the shuttle was
          tumbling out of control, headed
          directly for the planet where you
          found me.  I just barely managed
          to land in one piece.

                    RIKER
          So you had no idea how long you
          were out or where you were?  Did
          you try to make contact with the
          Beagle?

                    JACK
          The subspace radio was but one of
          many casualties.  I found an old
          locator buoy, but without a
          functioning subspace transducer
          coil, it seemed pretty hopeless.
          I managed to get it transmitting
          on the old broadband frequencies,
          but I knew it would be a long time
          if ever before anyone heard it.

                    PICARD
          If the Tyroleans hadn't passed
          through the area, we still
          wouldn't have heard your signal.
          You were very lucky.

Jack turns to look Picard squarely in the face.

                    JACK
          Sometimes luck is all you can
          count on.

The Enterprise personnel sit in stunned silence as the
meaning of the veiled accusation sinks in.

                    JACK
               (continuing)
          With the matter of calling for
          help out of the way, I decided to
          do a little exploring.  My only
          functioning tricorder gave no
          clues so I picked a direction that
          looked promising, and took off.
          Just over the ridge I found
          another ship about twice the size
          of my own.

                    DATA
          Could you describe the other ship?

                    JACK
          It was boxy, no struts or legs to
          hold it up, sitting flat on the
          ground.  I tried checking it out
          with the tricorder, but it didn't
          even register.  Yet my own
          shuttle, back over the ridge, did.

                    DATA
          That does correlate with a similar
          phenomenon mentioned by Captain
          Picard concerning the ship that
          attacked the Beagle.

                    PICARD
          I don't know if we destroyed that
          ship or not, but from your
          description, I'm certain it was at
          least ten times the size of the
          one you found.  They must have
          launched a shuttle undetected
          during the commotion of battle.

                    BEVERLY
          You never found any inhabitants
          from the ship you found?

                    JACK
          Absolutely none.

                    RIKER
          That's curious.

                    DATA
          But possibly not unexpected.

                    PICARD
          Explain, Mister Data.

Data starts to speak, then looks at Jack and stops.
Finally he looks back at Picard and continues.

                    DATA
          I have yet to complete my data
          analysis, and am not prepared at
          this time to report on my
          findings.

                    PICARD
          Very well, but please do so as
          quickly as possible.  We're in
          dangerous space.

                    DATA
          Certainly, Captain.

                    JACK
          By cannibalizing both ships, I was
          able to construct the hut you
          found me in down below.  It's
          mostly just the main body of the
          alien ship.

                    RIKER
          Our transporter chief had no
          trouble in locating your hut with
          ship's sensors.  How could that be
          if what you told us is true?

                    JACK
          I don't know.  Maybe the effect
          wears off with time.  Maybe it
          stopped when I pulled the thing
          apart.  To be honest, I never
          thought about it again.

                    BEVERLY
          I think you should have all the
          information you need for now,
          Captain.

                    PICARD
          Yes, quite.  We can let Jack go
          for now.

                    BEVERLY
          Now I'm going to get you to
          sickbay for that checkup.

                    JACK
          I'm very tired, Bev.  Can you give
          me an hour's nap before we get
          into that?

                    BEVERLY
          Very well, but don't think for a
          moment you're going to get out of
          this!  I've got some lab work to
          finish, but I'll join you in my,
          in our cabin shortly.

                    PICARD
          Lieutenant Worf, please escort
          Commander Crusher to the doctor's
          cabin.

                    WORF
          If you'll follow me, sir.

Worf and Jack leave through the door out into the
corridor.  The remaining people leave through the door
to the bridge, but Riker holds Picard back for a
moment.

                    RIKER
          Shouldn't we have Worf put a
          security guard outside the cabin?

                    PICARD
          I don't think that will be
          necessary, Number One.  Jack
          Crusher is not a threat to this
          ship.

                    RIKER
          Until we know for sure what
          happened on that planet, I don't
          think it's wise to make any
          assumptions.

                    PICARD
          Commander, I was forced to leave
          Jack Crusher behind to die ten
          years ago.  I will not now insult
          him by treating him as you
          suggest.

Picard turns and leaves for the bridge.


INT. TURBOLIFT

Worf and Jack are in the turbolift.

                    JACK
          You know Lieutenant, it pleases me
          to see a Klingon warrior aboard
          the Enterprise.  It could prove to
          be very useful.

                    WORF
          Sir?

                    JACK
          Ten years ago when I was marooned,
          the Klingon-Federation Alliance
          was very young, and the years of
          conflict preceding it were many.
          It wouldn't have taken much to
          turn an uneasy truce into a costly
          war.  Yet here you are, serving
          aboard a Federation Starship.

                    WORF
          Even today there are those who are
          not pleased being in the alliance.
          Many still live who served during
          the conflicts.  Memories sometimes
          die harder than those who fought
          in battle.

The turbolift comes to a halt and they exit to the
corridor.

                    JACK
          Ghosts of the past.

                    WORF
               (indignantly)
          Klingons do not believe in ghosts,
          or spirits.

                    JACK
          It's just a figure of speech among
          humans, Lieutenant.  It means that
          memories live on, even after the
          times and people are gone.

                    WORF
          The Klingons do have a saying:
          SuvwI' Heghpu' 'ach bortaSDaj
          ratlh.  (shoov-WEE khegh-poo, uch
          bor-TASH-dooj rah-TLL.  A warrior
          dies, but his vengeance remains.)

                    JACK
          Tell me, Lieutenant, how is it you
          not only live with those ghosts,
          but can also work so closely with
          humans without having the memories
          affect your work?

                    WORF
          My parents were killed in a
          surprise attack by the Romulans
          who left me to die a slow and
          honorless death.  A Federation
          scout found me and I was taken to
          be raised by a human family.  It
          allowed me to see both sides.

                    JACK
          Having the experiences of many
          lives can make a very powerful
          warrior.

Worf stops outside a door and Jack follows suit.

                    WORF
          We have arrived at the Doctor's
          cabin.

Worf opens the door and Jack enters the room and turns
to face the Klingon through the open door.  The camera
perspective changes to be from inside looking out to
Worf.

                    JACK
          Thank you, Lieutenant, for the
          company and the conversation.  We
          must find time to talk again.

                    WORF
          Yes.  I would like to learn more
          of Captain Picard's past, and his
          ghosts.

The door closes and we see now only Jack.

                    JACK
          Before we are done, my warrior
          friend, the entire crew will learn
          more than any of you bargained
          for.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

Data is seated at the science station at the back of
the bridge viewing records on the console.  Wesley
comes and sits down next to him.

                    WESLEY
               (quietly)
          Data, do you remember Dr. Soong
          very well?

                    DATA
          I remember all of my experiences
          in perfect detail.

                    WESLEY
          That's not what I mean.

                    DATA
          Ah, you are thinking of Dr. Soong
          as my father and wishing to equate
          your experiences now to my own.

                    WESLEY
          Something like that.

                    DATA
          While I spent time with Dr. Soong
          during the few weeks before I was
          shut off to save me from the
          crystal creature, I can not really
          say I knew him.

                    WESLEY
          What if you suddenly found out he
          was still alive out there
          somewhere?  How would you feel?

                    DATA
          I would not feel anything.

                    WESLEY
          If you met him again, what would
          you say to him?

                    DATA
          I would first ask him what had
          happened to him during the last
          years, and then I would ask him to
          tell me more about myself and his
          motivations for creating me, and
          my brother Lore.

                    WESLEY
          What would you call him?

                    DATA
          I would call him Doctor Soong.

                    WESLEY
          Data, no, you don't understand.

                    DATA
          I am afraid I do not, Wesley.

                    WESLEY
          When my father left, I was only
          eight years old.  I called him
          Dadaw.  But that's a child's name
          for a father.  I'm an adult now
          and it wouldn't be appropriate.
          Calling him Father seems too cold.
          I'm having trouble feeling close
          to him anymore, but I don't want
          to exaggerate the problem.

                    DATA
          You could call him Doctor Crusher,
          or perhaps just Jack.

                    WESLEY
          Data, you're no help.

                    DATA
          I am sorry Wesley.  Counseling
          humans in emotional issues is not
          an area in which I am proficient.
          Perhaps Counselor Troi can help
          you find the answers you seek.

                    WESLEY
          We've already talked.

                    DATA
          Then perhaps you can find them
          within yourself.

Wesley gets up and leaves and Data goes back to
studying his computer readouts.


INT. DEANNA TROI'S CABIN

Deanna is sitting and reading on a sofa amid several
large overstuffed cushions.  The door chime rings.

                    TROI
          Come in.

The door opens and Riker enters.  Troi smiles as she
sees him.

                    TROI
               (continuing)
          Hi, Will.

Her smile quickly fades.

                    TROI
               (continuing)
          You're worried about the Captain,
          aren't you?

                    RIKER
          Deanna, I wish you'd stop telling
          me how I feel before I have the
          chance to tell you.

                    TROI
          I'm sorry.  You ARE worried!
          What's wrong?

                    RIKER
          I'm worried about the Captain.  I
          fear he's letting his personal
          feelings for Commander Crusher
          cloud his judgement concerning the
          safety of the ship.

                    TROI
          I have sensed a certain amount of
          guilt from the Captain.  It's
          possible he's overcompensating for
          those feelings by treating the
          Commander with extra care.

                    RIKER
          I've never seen him let personal
          matters get in the way of ship's
          business before.  I'm worried it
          may endanger the ship.

                    TROI
          Have you talked with him about it?

                    RIKER
          No, I wanted someone to tell me
          I'm not imagining things before I
          go accusing him of anything so
          drastic.

                    TROI
          I've never seen the Captain
          intentionally endanger the lives
          of those around him.  And I've
          never seen him refuse to listen to
          constructive criticism.  You need
          to talk this out with him, to
          clear the air.  Both of you will
          feel better for it.

                    RIKER
          I suppose you're right.

Riker turns to leave and the door opens to let him
out.  Riker exits, then turns to face Deanna again.

                    RIKER
               (continuing)
          And I hope I'm wrong, about Jack
          and the Captain, for all our
          sakes.


INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM

Picard is sitting at his desk looking at something on
his display which we cannot see.  He is pondering.
The chime for his door sounds.

                    PICARD
          Enter.

The doors open and Riker enters.

                    RIKER
          Captain, why haven't we left yet?

                    PICARD
          Commander Crusher has been too
          busy to bring up his belongings
          from the surface.

                    RIKER
          We could have gathered his things
          for him hours ago without having
          to bother him.

                    PICARD
          That wouldn't be polite, Number
          One.

                    RIKER
          Permission to speak candidly, sir?

                    PICARD
          Always.

                    RIKER
          I don't think this has anything to
          do with politeness.  I think
          you're feeling guilty for having
          left Jack Crusher behind all those
          years ago, and now you're bending
          over backward to be nice to him,
          even if it endangers the ship.

                    PICARD
          What is it you're really trying to
          say, Commander?

                    RIKER
          Captain, I don't feel comfortable
          staying here with the possibility
          of another Ghost ship returning.

                    PICARD
          I almost hope they do.  I'd like
          another chance to talk to them and
          find out more about them.

                    RIKER
          Do you think that's wise?

                    PICARD
          It may not be wise, Number One,
          but it IS the reason we're out
          here.  We could have the
          opportunity to interact with
          beings completely unlike any we've
          met before.  And even if there is
          a confrontation, I believe the
          Enterprise can take care of
          herself.

Neither man says anything for a moment.

                    PICARD
               (continuing)
          Is there anything else, Commander?

                    RIKER
          No, sir.

                    PICARD
          Very well.  Dismissed.

Picard returns to looking at his display and Riker
leaves.

                                             FADE OUT.

                         END OF ACT THREE

                             ACT FOUR

FADE IN:

INT. DOCTOR CRUSHER'S CABIN

Jack Crusher is sitting at a computer studying
something on the viewscreen.  A door behind him,
leading between the Doctor's cabin and her sickbay,
opens.  He turns off the computer display before
anyone can see what he has been looking at.

                    BEVERLY
               (entering through the door)
          I thought you were going to get
          some rest.

                    JACK
          I guess the excitement of being
          rescued was more than I thought.
          I just couldn't get any sleep.
               (motioning to the nearby bed)
          Come, sit, let's talk.

                    BEVERLY
          We really should get you to
          sickbay for that exam.  That's
          what I came here for.

                    JACK
          The exam can wait, Bev.  I haven't
          had the chance to talk to you for
          ten years.  There's so many things
          I want to say, so many things I
          need to ask.

Beverly hesitates for a moment, then sits.

                    BEVERLY
          Where do we begin after ten years
          apart?

                    JACK
          Tell me, what did you do to try to
          deal with my death?  And how did
          you end up here, on the
          Enterprise, with Picard?

                    BEVERLY
          I left the University to set up a
          clinic in a small town in Iowa.  I
          had to get away from the coast,
          the University, Starfleet, and
          anything else that reminded me of
          you or of him.

                    JACK
          But you didn't stay.

                    BEVERLY
          No, I couldn't really get away
          from your memory.  And Wesley was
          suffering.  He had such a
          voracious appetite for learning
          and he was being stifled by the
          very small town limitations I had
          gone there to find.  He was
          growing up and I could see the
          same wanderlust in him that I'd
          seen in both yours and Jean-Luc's
          eyes so many years before.

                    JACK
          You were afraid of losing Wesley,
          weren't you?

                    BEVERLY
          I couldn't stand the thought of
          losing him after having already
          lost you.  He was the only part of
          you I had left.  When he started
          talking of wanting to join up with
          Starfleet I knew the only way I'd
          keep him was to go myself and
          bring him with me.

                    JACK
          But why the Enterprise?  Why
          Picard?

                    BEVERLY
          When I heard Starfleet was about
          to launch a new Galaxy Class ship,
          with families on board along with
          the officers and crew, I knew that
          was where I needed to be.  And
          when I found out Jean-Luc was
          going to be her Captain, I
          realized I finally had to face
          him.

                    JACK
          I'm not sure I understand why
          you'd want to put yourself through
          that.

                    BEVERLY
          The Captain didn't understand it
          either.  When he found out I'd
          been assigned to the Enterprise,
          he graciously offered me the
          opportunity to transfer to another
          ship.  You should have seen the
          look on his face when I told him
          I'd requested assignment to the
          Enterprise.

                    JACK
          So there was nothing between the
          two of you, then?

                    BEVERLY
               (laughs)
          Is that why you've been acting so
          cold around Jean-Luc?  You know he
          feels badly enough about what
          happened as it is.
               (shakes her head in disbelief)
          I won't say I haven't thought
          about it from time to time.  He's
          an attractive man and you were
          dead as far as anyone knew.  Was I
          supposed to just shrivel up and
          die?  Anyway, the Captain's too
          busy with his ship to pay
          attention to a woman.
               (beat)
          Most of the time, anyway.
               (beat)
          But now you're back in my life,
          and I still love you, Jack
          Crusher, and I always did no
          matter what you may think.
               (stands up)
          And we've spent enough time
          jabbering.  It's time for your
          physical.

                    JACK
               (yawning)
          You know, Bev, all this talk has
          used up all that nervous energy I
          had before.  I think I WILL take
          that nap now.  I'll see you later
          for the exam, OK?

                    BEVERLY
          Jack Crusher, you may be my
          husband, and Jean-Luc Picard may
          be Captain of this ship, but when
          it comes to medical matters, I'm
          the boss around here.
               (points to doorway)
          Now move it, Mister!


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

Picard reenters the bridge from his ready room.

                    DATA
          Captain, I have finished my
          records search and I believe I
          have found information relevant to
          both the Beagle mission and our
          present situation.

                    PICARD
          What is it, Data?

                    DATA
          A search of Starfleet records for
          related material turned up nothing
          beyond your own report.  I also
          found nothing in the Federation
          Science records, as well as those
          of the Klingon Empire, the Nordane
          Protectorate, the Bryzantean
          Syndicate, the---

                    PICARD
               (interrupting)
          But you did find something.

                    DATA
          Yes, sir, in the Federation
          Archeological Archives.
          Expeditions to two different
          planetary systems by unrelated
          archaeological teams reported
          similar mythos found among the
          remains of the civilizations on
          their respective planets.  Each
          civilization had expired more than
          a thousand years before the Beagle
          contact, and neither civilization
          had ever made contact with the
          other.  Yet each team reported
          information closely matching that
          from your report.  Each system was
          within twenty-five light years of
          the other and of the Anjinn
          system.

                    RIKER
          Do you think there's a connection
          between the dead civilizations and
          the Beagle encounter?

                    DATA
          The research teams reported
          numerous accounts of visitations
          by alien ships which seemed to
          appear out of nowhere without
          being detected by planetary sensor
          systems.  And although widely
          discredited by the official
          planetary governing bodies, there
          were claims that aliens were
          merging themselves with some
          citizens.

                    RIKER
          Merging themselves?  Do you mean
          the aliens were replacing the
          natives?

                    DATA
          I do not know, Commander, I am
          only able to quote from the
          reports.  A few of the people who
          were supposed to have been taken
          over were examined, but no
          evidence was ever found they were
          not who they claimed to be.
          Eventually, all those who had made
          the claims recanted them as having
          been an elaborate hoax.

                    PICARD
          You say these things happened in
          nearly identical fashion in each
          of the two lost cultures?

                    DATA
          It appears each civilization died
          out without explanation within one
          century of the first alien
          reports.  They simply ceased to
          exist.

                    RIKER
               (to himself)
          Merged?
               (aloud)
          What a horrible way to die.  To
          exist and yet not exist.  To no
          longer be you, but some alien
          creature.

                    DATA
          Captain, assuming this to be true,
          it is possible Commander Crusher-
          --

                    PICARD
               (interrupting)
          Might not really be himself, but
          an alien from the Ghost Ship.

                    DATA
          Commander Crusher did say no
          evidence was found of any being in
          the other ship.

                    RIKER
          Surely the Enterprise' instruments
          are much better than those of the
          two dead civilizations.  I'm sure
          we'd be able to tell if Jack had
          been taken over.

                    PICARD
          He has seemed to display some
          reluctance to participate in a
          medical examination.
               (using communicator)
          Sickbay.  Doctor Crusher, are you
          there?

                    BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
          Yes, Captain, what can I do for
          you?

                    PICARD
          Has Jack come by for his checkup
          yet?

                    BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
          It took some convincing to get him
          here, but yes, he has.  In fact he
          left here just a few minutes ago.

                    PICARD
          Any results, yet?  Did anything
          out of the ordinary show up?

                    BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
          Everything was completely normal.

                    PICARD
          Anything too normal?  Any old
          injuries that don't show up?
          Anything like that?

                    BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
          Well, there was that old fencing
          injury, but the scar was still
          there.
               (sounding worried now)
          Why, Jean-Luc?  Is something
          wrong?

                    PICARD
          One moment, Doctor.

Picard pushes a control on his arm rest control pad.
Picard and Riker then turn to look at each other for a
moment.

                    PICARD
          Computer, please locate Jack
          Crusher.

                    COMPUTER VOICE
          All ship's personnel accounted
          for.  Unregistered person located
          in Main Engineering.

                    PICARD
          Picard to Engineering.  Jack, are
          you down there?
               (pause)
          Lieutenant LaForge, can you
          respond?

After a long pause, Worf heads for the turbolift.

                    PICARD
          Worf, I want you here to
          coordinate security activities.
          Mr. Data will check out
          Engineering.

Data gets up and leaves.  Picard pushes the button on
his arm rest again.

                    PICARD
               (continuing)
          Beverly, it appears there's some
          trouble in Engineering, your
          services might be needed.  And
          yes, something could be very
          wrong.  We now believe the man we
          brought back to the Enterprise is
          not really Jack Crusher, but an
          alien who has taken over his body.

                    BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
               (hesitantly)
          I see.

                    PICARD
          Well, Number One, it looks like we
          were both wrong.  Apparently, our
          sensors aren't any better at
          detecting these creatures than
          those civilizations' were.  I only
          hope my indulgence in accepting
          the creature as Jack Crusher won't
          prove to be fatal.


INT. MAIN ENGINEERING

Data is just arriving.  He finds several engineering
personnel laying sprawled on the floor, and Beverly
kneeling over Geordi who was in the same general state
as his fellow engineers.

                    DATA
          Are they all right, Doctor?

                    BEVERLY
          They're alive.

                    DATA
               (using communicator)
          Captain, I am in Engineering.
          Doctor Crusher is here
          administering to the needs of the
          engineering crew who appear to
          have been attacked.

                    BEVERLY
               (so as to be heard)
          They're all in a state of heavy
          stun.  It's similar to a phaser
          stun, but appears to be more long
          lasting.

                    DATA
          Several of the engineering panels
          appear to have been tampered with.
          I cannot at this time assess the
          damage.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

                    PICARD
          Doctor, is Lieutenant LaForge
          there?

                    BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
          Yes, Captain, I'm looking after
          him now.

                    PICARD
          Can you bring him safely back to
          consciousness?  I need him to
          assess the damage.

                    BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
          I'll do what I can.

                    PICARD
          Worf, alert your security teams to
          be on the lookout for the alien.
          Use extreme caution, he's
          apparently armed and dangerous.

                    WORF
          They're already on their way.


INT. CORRIDOR

Wesley is walking down a corridor mumbling to himself,
trying to decide how best to address his father when
he sees him.  He is nearly run down by Jack coming in
the opposite direction as he rounds a corner.

                    WESLEY
          Dad!

Wesley turns and follows his father who is walking at
a good clip.

                    WESLEY
               (continuing)
          I was just coming to see you, to
          apologize for the way I've been
          acting since you came aboard.

                    JACK
          That's alright, Wes.  I know you
          must have been filled with so many
          confusing thoughts and emotions.
          Soon all that will be over.  Soon
          you'll understand everything.

As Wesley and Jack round a corner, they run into two
SECURITY GUARDS with phasers drawn.

                    WESLEY
          What's the meaning of this?

                    GUARD ONE
          Orders from Lieutenant Worf.
          We're to locate and detain Jack
          Crusher until the Lieutenant can
          interrogate the prisoner.

                    WESLEY
          Prisoner?

Camera follows as Jack pushes Wesley away from him and
onto the floor.  Phaser blasts hit above Wesley where
Jack was.  Then the camera pulls back to show that the
guards are stunned and Jack is gone.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

                    WORF
          A security team in sciences has
          reported they are closing in on
          Commander Crusher.

                    WESLEY'S COM VOICE
          Captain Picard?  This is Wesley.
          I was with my father when two
          guards stopped us and claimed he
          was a prisoner.  The next thing I
          knew, he pushed me down to the
          floor, they were stunned and he'd
          disappeared.  What's going on?

                    PICARD
          Wesley, the man you were with is
          not your father, but an alien.
          Your report, however, may be of
          critical value in helping us deal
          with him.  Worf, please pull your
          security teams out between the
          science labs and transporter room.

                    WORF
          Sir?

                    PICARD
          Jack, or whatever he is, is headed
          in that direction and I don't want
          anyone else hurt.  We're not ready
          yet to face him.
               (to com)
          Chief O'Brien, Jack Crusher's
          headed your way.  I want you out
          of the way.  Whatever happens, do
          not interfere with him.

                    O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE
          Will do, Captain.

                    RIKER
          If this man, or whatever he is, is
          so dangerous, why are we letting
          him leave the ship?

                    PICARD
          It's precisely because he IS so
          dangerous that I want him off the
          ship.
               (beat)
          Mister Worf, I want you to
          accompany myself and Commander
          Riker to the planet.  Select two
          guards to accompany us.

                    RIKER
          Captain, I said nothing before
          because Jack Crusher was such a
          close friend of yours, but I must
          strongly object to your going
          after him now.  It's too
          dangerous.

                    PICARD
          Your objections have been noted,
          Commander.  But I believe I'm the
          only hope we have of stopping him.

Picard goes towards the turbolift.  Riker is not
following him.

                    PICARD
               (continuing)
          Coming, Number One?

                                             FADE OUT.

                         END OF ACT FOUR

                             ACT FIVE

FADE IN:

INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

Two new security guards are ready for beam down.
O'Brien is at the controls.  Picard, Worf, and Riker
are entering the room.

                    O'BRIEN
          I kept out of sight as ordered,
          but was able to see what happened.
          Jack Crusher transported himself
          and a bundle to the planet.

                    PICARD
          What coordinates?

                    O'BRIEN
          They're still set to the structure
          where we beamed you up earlier.

                    GEORDI'S COM VOICE
          Captain, I have a preliminary
          report on engine room damage.

                    PICARD
          Glad to hear you're feeling
          better, Mr. LaForge.  Let's hear
          it.

                    GEORDI'S COM VOICE
          Whoever did this knew what they
          were doing.  The main warp engine
          coupling circuits have been taken
          out.  Also the primary backup, the
          phaser couplings, and the shield
          control circuits.

                    PICARD
          Can the circuits be fixed?

                    GEORDI'S COM VOICE
          Not without Starbase facilities.
          This guy did a real professional
          job.  Shields and weapons are
          definitely out for the duration.

                    RIKER
          I think we may have overstayed our
          welcome.

                    GEORDI'S COM VOICE
          We may still have one chance left
          with the Warp drive, but I haven't
          been able to check it out yet.

                    PICARD
          Do what you can, Geordi.  If you
          can't get Warp working again, then
          get everyone in the saucer section
          and we'll leave on maximum
          impulse.

                    GEORDI'S COM VOICE
          Yes, sir.  Oh, and Captain,
          there's a subspace transducer
          assembly missing.  It's not
          critical, but I thought you'd like
          to know.

                    WORF'S COM VOICE
          Captain, I'm picking up a ship at
          extreme range, but on visual scans
          only.  It's traveling toward us at
          Warp three point four.

                    PICARD
          How much time, Lieutenant?

                    WORF'S COM VOICE
          Fourteen minutes.

                    PICARD
          Geordi, forget the impulse
          engines, get the warp drive
          working any way you can!  Mr.
          O'Brien, reset transporter to our
          original beamdown coordinates.

                    O'BRIEN
          Got it.

Worf, Picard, Riker, and the security guards are
beamed down.


EXT. GRASSLANDS

Worf silently directs the security guards to take up
positions on two low hills overlooking each side of
the encampment.  Picard takes out his phaser, and
leads the remaining three around the embankment and
into sight of the hut.  He points the phaser at the
hut.

                    PICARD
          Jack, or whatever you are now, we
          know you're here.

Jack strolls out of the hut.

                    JACK
          Do you really think you can stop
          me?  Your ship's disabled and I've
          repaired my subspace radio, thanks
          to the generosity of your
          engineering department.  My people
          will soon be coming and there'll
          be no way to stop us from taking
          the Enterprise and her crew.  With
          that, the galaxy will at last be
          ours.

                    PICARD
          You have no right to do this!

                    JACK
          We have the right to survive!

                    PICARD
          Not at the expense of other
          sentient species.  You've already
          killed off two civilizations that
          we know of, and what has it gotten
          you?  You're still looking for
          victims.

                    JACK
          They were weak.  They couldn't
          help us to survive.  You humans
          are strong, though.  We'll make it
          this time.  And I know enough of
          your human heritage, Jean-Luc, to
          know that your race hasn't always
          abided by those lofty sounding
          words of yours.  You're just as
          guilty as we are.

                    PICARD
          Whatever evils the human race has
          perpetrated, it's in the past.

                    JACK
          Yet you hold those two
          civilizations from the past
          against my people.

                    PICARD
          Then let's talk of the present,
          and the future.  The Federation
          will help your people in any way
          we can.

                    JACK
          There's nothing your Federation
          can give us, Captain, except your
          bodies and your souls.

                    PICARD
          Not if you're not willing to sit
          down and negotiate, no.

                    JACK
          It's the only way we can survive,
          Captain.  We will take what we
          need to survive.

                    PICARD
          Not if I stop you.

                    JACK
          You?  How?  You don't know what
          you're up against.  I'm too good,
          too fast.
               (beat)
          You don't believe me?  Watch!

He quickly pulls out a weapon and stuns the two guards
up on the overlooks with two shots.  Special effect
should show blurring motion too hard to follow.

                    JACK
               (continuing)
          Oh, don't worry, Captain, they're
          not dead.  We'll need all the
          bodies we can get.  Can't you see
          your position's hopeless?  There's
          nothing you can do.

                    PICARD
          I don't believe that, because I
          believe there's still some small
          part of the real Jack Crusher left
          in you.

                    JACK
          I have Jack Crusher's body, right
          down to the cell structure and
          DNA.  I have all his memories, a
          knowledge of his likes, his
          dislikes, every one of his
          emotions and every bit of his
          personality at my recall if I need
          them.  But I'm not Jack, he's been
          gone for ten years.

                    PICARD
          I believe you may have done too
          good a job of assimilating Jack.
          I think there's enough of him in
          you that he and I together will
          defeat you.

                    JACK
          Then you're a fool, Captain.  The
          moment you begin to thumb the
          trigger on your phaser, I'll take
          you out just like the guards.  And
          before your two friends can help
          you, I'll take them out too.
          Then, there'll be nothing left to
          do but wait for your replacements
          to come and claim your bodies.


ON PICARD'S THUMB

Picard moves his thumb closer to the phaser trigger.


WIDE ANGLE

Jack looks nervous.  Picard looks calm.


ON PICARD'S THUMB

Picard's thumb twitches.


WIDE ANGLE

Suddenly, a large discharge of energy envelops the
space between the two men and they are thrown to the
ground from the resulting blast.  For a few seconds,
it is unclear who has won the battle.

                    PICARD
          Am I still here, Number One?

                    RIKER
          It appears so.

Riker helps Picard up and they walk towards Jack's
body.  Then the body is surrounded by a glowing area
and it slowly dissolves.  For several seconds, they
all stare at the now empty ground without anyone
speaking.

                    PICARD
          We must destroy that transmitter.

Picard points his phaser at the hut and the other two
follow suit.  Together they fire and destroy the
structure.

                    PICARD
               (using communicator)
          Enterprise.

                    DATA'S COM VOICE
          Data here, Captain.  I trust you
          were successful.

                    PICARD
          The creature is destroyed and the
          transmitter disabled.  Do you have
          a status report on the engines?

                    GEORDI'S COM VOICE
          Our one chance panned out,
          Captain.  The creature apparently
          didn't know about the secondary
          Warp backup system in the
          auxiliary engineering room.  It's
          still intact and we've coupled it
          into the main reactors.  We will
          have to limit ourselves to Warp
          four, though, until we can get to
          a repair dock.

                    PICARD
          Good work, Geordi.  We'll need
          every bit of engine power you can
          deliver to outrun that incoming
          ship.

                    WORF'S COM VOICE
          Captain, the ship is now less than
          two minutes away from our
          position.

                    PICARD
          Then we have no time to waste.
          Enterprise, beam us up.  And
          notify Doctor Crusher her
          professional skills will be
          needed.

The three standing and two guards on the overhangs are
all beamed back to the ship.


INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

As the away team beams back in, Dr. Crusher is waiting
for them.  Picard and Beverly look at each other
without speaking.  Then Picard shakes his head and
speaks.

                    PICARD
          I'm sorry, Beverly.

She tries to speak but only nods in return without
saying anything.  She wordlessly goes to the injured
guards on the transporter and begins to tend to them.
Picard leaves the transporter room.


INT. MAIN BRIDGE

Picard enters the bridge and sits in the command
chair.

                    PICARD
          Status, Mister Worf.

                    WORF
          We are pulling away.


ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN

The ship is getting smaller.  Suddenly, it appears
confused, turning first one way then the other in its
attempts at pursuit.

                    WORF
               (continuing)
          We appear to be beyond their
          sensor capability.

                    PICARD
          Good.  They won't be able to track
          us to Federation space.  Notify
          Starfleet of their last known
          position and mark it in our logs.
          We must return and try to find
          them again when we're back to full
          strength.

                    WORF
          Aye, sir.

Picard stands and prepares to leave the bridge.

                    PICARD
          Notify me if the situation
          changes.


INT. DOCTOR CRUSHER'S SICKBAY OFFICE

Beverly is sitting at her desk trying to attend to
paperwork type matters but is not able to concentrate.
The outer door opens and Wesley enters.

                    WESLEY
          I guess it's too late to have that
          talk, huh?

                    BEVERLY
          It's too late for a lot of things,
          Wes.  You were right, not to
          bother wasting your time with that
          thing.

                    WESLEY
          No, Mom, you were the one who was
          right.  For a few hours, in your
          own mind, you had Dad back.  It
          doesn't matter that he wasn't
          really Dad, he was to you.  I'm
          just sorry I never really got to
          know my father.

                    BEVERLY
               (smiles)
          There's an awful lot of him in
          you, you know.

Beverly and Wesley hug.


INT. HOLODECK

Same simulation as before.  Picard is here and Riker
is entering the room.

                    RIKER
          May I join you, Captain?

Riker sits down at the little table where Picard is
seated.  There is a second glass of fruit juice at his
place.

                    PICARD
          I suppose I owe you an apology,
          Number One.  I'm sure you were
          wondering about your captain,
          waiting around for dangerous
          aliens to come back again.

                    RIKER
          Captain, I---

                    PICARD
               (interrupting)
          There was another part of
          Starfleet's message that you
          didn't see.  I was to locate and
          make contact with the aliens if at
          all possible.  The Federation
          wanted to determine if friendly
          contact could be made and
          maintained between our cultures.
          But I was to prevent them from
          locating Federation space at all
          costs if negotiations were
          impossible.
               (looking down)
          They're all gone, Number One.  The
          only close friends I had at the
          Academy.  Jack Crusher, Walker
          Keel, Harrison Palmer.  The best
          men I've known during my career
          and my life, and they're all gone.
          Yet I'm still here.

                    RIKER
          You can't feel guilty for
          surviving, Captain.

                    PICARD
          But I did feel guilty about what I
          did to Jack ten years ago.  Even
          though I did have orders to stay
          and make contact, I got careless.
          My feelings for an old friend
          nearly got us all killed.  The
          only thing that saved us was pure
          luck.

                    RIKER
          Some say ships named Enterprise
          have always been blessed with luck
          enough to save even the most
          foolhardy.  When fortune smiles on
          you, you don't question it.  You
          learn from your mistakes and move
          on.

                    PICARD
          But what a cost those mistakes
          sometimes exact, Number One.

                    RIKER
          I know how you must feel.

                    PICARD
          Do you?  Have you ever given an
          order knowing it would result in
          the death of someone you loved?
          Have you ever actually killed
          someone you cared about?
               (beat)
          Yes, I suppose you have.  But tell
          me, have you ever had to kill your
          closest friend?

                    RIKER
          That was ten years ago, Captain,
          and you didn't kill him, you only
          did what you had to, leaving him
          behind.

                    PICARD
          I'm not talking ten years ago,
          Will, I'm talking down there, on
          that planet, today.

                    RIKER
          That thing down there wasn't Jack
          Crusher.  It was something that
          had taken him over many years ago.

                    PICARD
          You still don't see it, do you,
          Number One?  I knew as soon as we
          got Wesley's report.  That's why
          my going down to the planet was
          the only hope we had.
               (beat)
          Wesley said Jack pushed him out of
          the way before the fire fight with
          the guards.  There was something
          buried deep in him that didn't
          want Wesley getting hurt.  You saw
          how fast he took out the security
          guards on the planet.  They
          outflanked him and had nearly
          perfect defensive positions.  Yet
          he took them out without the
          slightest problem.  You don't
          think I was any real match against
          that, do you Number One?

Riker remains silent and Picard stares into his glass.

                    PICARD
               (continuing)
          If there hadn't been a bit of Jack
          left in him, to slow him down just
          a little, we never would have made
          it.  Jack gave his life down there
          for us today.  And I'll have to
          live the rest of my life knowing I
          was the one to take it.

Riker picks up his glass and holds it toward Picard.

                    RIKER
          To old friends!

Picard hesitates for a moment, then clinks his glass
against Riker's.

                    PICARD
          To new friends.
               (beat)
          You know it just doesn't feel
          right for this place to be so
          empty.  Computer, some people
          please.

The room is now filled with noisy, playing, laughing
people having a good time.

                                             FADE OUT.

                         END OF ACT FIVE

                             THE END.
