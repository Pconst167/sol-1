YET ANOTHER TV SERIES IN THE WORKS?

The 28 June 1993 issue of Broadcasting and Cable (considered the bible for
the broadcasting industry) has an article titled "Getting an early start on
'94-'95" on page 8 column 3 under the heading "A piece of the
action-adventure":

In the weekly action-adventure arena, station rep sources say Paramount
officials have told them a third syndicated Star Trek series is going to be
developed for the 1994-95 season to fill time periods vacated by Star Trek:
The Next Generation, which they said will end production after next season.
(TNG's cast will be trasitioning into a series of motion picture releases
for the studio.)

This seems to be talking about a fifth TV series (1=TOS, 2=TAS, 3=TNG,
4=DS9).

Tim Lynch reports that a person in contact with Brannon Braga, (a story
editor for TNG) said:

...he also says the net rumors about a new Star Trek series are
"completely unfounded."  The staff talks about such things from time to
time, but there isn't anything in the works."

Of course they might just be feeding false rumors out (either about there
being a new series or about there NOT being a new series).

In the weekly action-adventure arena, station rep sources say Paramount
officials have told them a third syndicated Star Trek series is going to be
developed for the 1994-95 season to fill time periods vacated by Star Trek:
The Next Generation, which they said will end production after next season.
(TNG's cast will be trasitioning into a series of motion picture releases
for the studio.)

Mid-July 1993:  This agrees with what Peter David and Archie Waugh said at
DragonCon.  They did add that it would be a ship-based show.  As to who
would be on the show, and what ship it would be, they had no details.
(Personal note: He got this information from me!! - Dirk)

29 July 1993:  "Daily Variety" had a front-page article that stated that TV
station programmers say that Paramount has confirmed in meetings that TNG
will end with 93/94 season; they also report a new Trek series for the
following season.  However, a Paramount spokesman termed "purely
speculative" reports of a new Trek series.

29 July 1993:  "Entertainment Tonight" mentioned that the studio said that
a third show would be added.

End-July 1993:  A UK Satellite magazine's gossip column mentioned that
Paramount was thinking of adding a 3rd series "StarFleet Academy" aimed at
younger audience than DSN/TNG.

3 August 1993 CNN's Larry King Live:  Patrick Stewart responded to Larry
King's question of another Star Trek series that "I've heard talk, yes; and
there is absolutely no reason why it shouldn't go on forever."

Early August "Science Fiction Age Magazine" stated that Paramount is
working on a new series to replase TNG when it goes to the movies.  All the
detail they had was that it involved a starship travelling around and
getting into trouble (more like TNG and TOS than DS9).

Early August 1993 Cinefantastique Annual Star Trek Issue (vol 24) reports
that according to Rick Berman, "There have been preliminary discussions of
a new series."  The new series would be one of the following:
- A spin-off of TNG with a new crew.
- Riker is promoted to captain, either continue the voyages on the
Enterprise or a new ship.  Frakes loves the idea, as does Sirtis, and both
would jump at the chance to do it.
- Ron Moore suggests a Klingon show or one that goes back before Kirk's
time.  [would they be able to find enough people that would volunteer
to endure all that time getting into and out of makeup each day? --hm]
- Starfleet Academy (possibly with Wesley Crusher in the lead).
Brannon Bragga (TNG Story Editor) said he would "Probably go to another
starship.  I'd get out of out galaxy and continue the exploration.  My
impulse would be to stay on a Starship of different design and magnitude
and continue exploring the universe."  He also said that it would be
"interesting to do a show 20 years from when the cultural and political
climate have changed and see what the show is like."

11 August 1993 Daily Express (mid-range UK newpaper) mentioned that the
captain of the ship (the Excalibur) will be "a glamourous woman".  Casters
are searching as we speak.  Among the actresses being suggested for the
role are Uma Thurman, Rachel Ward, Michelle Pfeiffer, Laura Dern, and Meg
Ryan.  Paramount Pictures executives have given the go-ahead to the new $50
million television series drama which will take over from ST:TNG.  As
filming on the Excalibur starts later this year, Captain Picard - British
actor Patrick Stewart - and his crew will be filming a Star Trek movie.
The fourth [live-action] Star Trek series will set off on its space journey
at the same time.  A Paramount Pictures insider revealed:  "writers have
been contracted to prepare scripts for the new series, and casting agents
have been told to look for a beautiful young woman to captain the
Excalibur.  There is no sex discrimination in the 24th century and a
female can command a ship as well, if not better, and any male."  The
series will be filmed on current Next Generation sets at Paramount Pictures
and will be screened in America in the autumn of next year.

Mid-August 1993 San Jose Creation con:  David Rossi, the Assistant to the
Line Producer of TNG reports that the new series will have an Enterprise as
the ship (I don't know which letter).

16 August 1993 Broadcasting & Cable:  "One of the leading candidates,
according to a source close to Paramount Domestic Television, is a series
premise revolving around the Star Fleet Academy (based in a futuristic San
Francisco), where actor Wil Wheaton's young cadet character (Wesley
Crusher) would provide a transitional link from TNG.  Another has Jonathan
Frake's William Riker being promoted to captain of the 'Enterprise' or
another starship."

16 August 1993 Broadcasting & Cable:  "Paramount Television Group Chairman
Kerry McCluggage confirmed to Broadcasting & Cable that ...  Paramount
executives are hard at work on yet another spin-off for early 1995.
Several different proposed series formats have, in fact, begun to surface.
One has actor Wil Wheaton, who played Wesley Crusher in _Next Generation_,
returning as a young cadet in a series based out of the Starfleet Academy.
Another concept would have Jonathan Frakes transition in the new series,
but as a slightly different character from his current William Riker role
on _TNG_, according to a source close to Paramount.  [Lt Tom Riker] is
posted to helm the starship _U.S.S.  Gahndi_, leaving the storyline open
for possible development as a series.  'Frakes and Marina Sirtis ...  have
expressed strong interest in continuing with the new series,' said the
source."

Late August 1993:  CNN had a sound byte that seems to confirm that the new
series indeed will star Wesley at the Academy.

Mid September 1993 reports from CompuServe confirm the new Star Trek
series, to debut in the fall of 1994.  The strongest rumors say it will be
a starship-based series.  Its tentative name is "Star Trek:  The New
Frontier."

25 September 1993 SD Creation con:  The new Star Trek series that will be
coming out sometime next year will be led by Michael Piller, Rick Berman,
and Jeri Taylor.  The creation host said that the new series will be
Enterprise-based (if this is the case, any of the current TNG characters
that didn't want to continue would no doubt have to move off the ship).  A
TNG extra mentoined later in the same con that the new series would *not*
be Enterprise-based.  They also say that the characters will be younger.
Wil Wheaton may be on it.  (He's currently working for NewTek in Kansas
city.)

Early October 1993 TV Guide:  Rick Berman said that there is always the
possibility of a new Trek series.

25-26 October 1993:  CNBC reports that Paramount will starting a new
netwrok (a la Fox) in 1995.  A new Star Trek program (according to the
report) will debut with the name of Star Trek Voyager. 

26 October 1993:  Clarinet news service posted an announcement by
Paramount officials regarding the formation of a fifth television network
for January 1995.  One of the four hours of programming was said to be a
program named STAR TREK: VOYAGER.

26 October 1993:  Entertainment Tonight (Paramount's mouthpiece) reported
that Paramount plans to start up a new network with Chris-Craft, starting
with four hours of programming per week (similar to PTEN).  One of the
hours would be a new series called "Star Trek: VOYAGER".  Slated to begin
airing January '95.

27 October 1993 Cincinnati Enquirer:
PARAMOUNT TO CREATE FIFTH NETWORK
Plans to premiere in January, 1995
Bloomberg Business News
New York - Paramount Communications Inc. said Tuesday it would form a
fifth U.S. broadcast television network with Chris-Craft Industries Inc.
Paramount, which has been considering a fifth network for some time, said
the network will premiere in January, 1995, with two nights of programming
each week on 10 stations.  It would be the first new U.S. broadcast
network since News Corp. created Fox Broadcasting in 1986.  The network
gives Paramount a guaranteed outlet for its television shows.  Initially,
the lineup will be anchored by a spin-off of Paramount's popular "Star
Trek" space adventure series, to be called "Star Trek: Voyager."  The
network also will acquire original programs from other television
producers.  Controlling the network's scheduling ensures Paramount's shows
will get prime-time exposure.  Time-Warner Inc., the biggest producer of
prime-time programming in the United States, has reportedly studied
creating a network over the past year for the many of the same reasons.
"What it's basically providing is another avenue to make sure the programs
Paramount produces get good air time, especially since the networks have
their own programming agenda, said James Goss, an analyst for Duff &
Phelps.  The new "Paramount Network" will be jointly owned and operated by
Paramount and Chris-Craft, a New York-based company headed by longtime
media investor Herbert Siegel.  Through 70%-owned subsidiary BHC
Communications, Chris-Craft owns six independent stations and two network
affiliates.  Combined with Paramount's four independent stations, the
company estimated that the stations reach more than 27% of U.S.
households.  The companies said the venture has been approved by Viacom,
which is in a bidding war against QVC Network Inc. for Paramount.

27 October 1993 New York Times:  "...The Paramount Network would begin in
January 1995 with four hours of programming over two nights, using as its
foundation one of Paramount's most successful programming franchises, "Star
Trek."  A new series "Star Trek Voyager," is the first program to be
scheduled..."

26-27 October 1993:  Toronto CTV affiliate business report talked about
Paramount announcing that they are planning on starting their own
television network with another company.  The network is set to start
operations in January 1995 and in order to give the new network exposure
they are planning on producing another new Star Trek series.

26-27 October 1993:  An article in the New York Times on the announcement
seems to indicate that Paramount's going to try and get on some
"Superstations" like WOR, WTBS, or WGN as a way of reaching areas that
aren't covered by Paramount/Chris-Craft stations.

Late-October 1993 Saramento Bee reports the same news about the new Trek
series being the anchor of the new Paramount network.  They also reported
that none of the current Trek programs would be yanked and moved over to
the new network (TNG should be done by then and DS9 will continue as it
currently is).

Late-October 1993:  USA Today reports that areas that won't have a
Paramount station will likely show the Paramount shows on cable stations;
meaning the regular FOX/ABC/CBS/NBC/Indpendents are probably out (unless,
of course, they join the network; it isn't unheard of for one station to
carry TWO networks).

27 October 1993 Atlanta Journal/Constitution:  "Details are still very
sketchy, but Paramount Communications Inc., the prize in a major
acquisition battle says it will collaborate with station owner Chris-Craft
Industries to launch a fifth TV network in 1995.  The network will begin
with four hours of original programming over two nights anchored by a new
"Star Trek" show, the company announced.  While four hours doesn't sound
like much of a network, Fox started at roughly the same level in 1987.
Eventually, the still unnamed network hopes to compete against ABC, CBS,
Fox, and NBC."

off-network programs.  By aligning themselves with The Paramount Network,
the affiliated stations around the country will create a valuable franchise
in their markets."
