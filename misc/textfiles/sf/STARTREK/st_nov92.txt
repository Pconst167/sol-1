     Well, this newcomer to the Trek novels certainly gets points for
an innovative approach to an old topic.  But apart from the premise,
this novel just doesn't work out.  The dialogue is stilted, and the
characters are nearly flat.

     A lot of people have a preference as to writing styles, and so
many dislike Mr. Friedman's work.  Personally, I don't care what kind
of style an author uses as long as it works for him/her and keeps me
interested in the story.
     I enjoyed this one.  Characterization of the central characters
was better than average, and the basic premise and plot handling
were very good.  I also consider it a plus when a novel shows some
continuity between itself and the series or the other novels, and
seeing Carol and David Marcus here falls into the category of an
interesting tie-in.

     As most of you probably already know, Margaret Wander Bonanno 
"has disclaimed ownership to this novel because of the changes 
imposed by the powers-that-be and the 'editing' done by Pocket 
Books to 'bring her novel into line'."
     Faced with this fact, I think one word accurately describes
this release: FRAUD!  This is not, by far, the worst Trek novel
written this year, but it certainly comes close.
     This one is average fare from beginning to end, and that is
nothing but a travesty; the original is a fascinating, enthralling
read from the opening moments to the last sentence.  
     Don't bother reading this one; attempt to get your hands on
the original.  You won't regret it.  I'm going to give you a
comparison of _Probe_ and _Music.._ here just to show you how 
far apart the two really are...

Next: Chains of Command


>TNG #21 Chains of Command                     Copyright April 1992 
>Author:    Bill McCay and Eloise Flood
>StarDate:  UNKNOWN

>Plot Summary:   
>   While exploring a group of devastated class-M planets in a remote sector
>of of space, the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise is shocked to discover a group
>of human slaves on a forbidding, glacial world.  When the slaves revolt 
>against their human overseers, Captain Picard and his crew sympathize with
>the slaves plight but cannot interfere in the conflict.
>   After the revolt is a success, Captain Picard learns that both the slaves
>and the overseers were controlled by a mysterious bird-like race called the
>Tseetsk, who are coming to reclaim their property.  With time running out,
>the rebels kidnap Captain Picard and Counsellor Troi -- drawing the U.S.S.
>Enterprise into the middle of their deadly plan of vengeance.

     Well, this makes two TNG novels in a row dealing with a race of slaves.
This one works no better than the last one.  The narrative and dialogue are
uninvolving, and the plot is choppy.  Unless you're a die-hard Trek-novel
collector, this is one to avoid buying.. if you must read it, wait and get
it from the library.

Next: The Disinherited


>TOS #59  The Disinherited                      Copyright May 1992
>Author:    Peter David, Michael Jan Friedman and Robert Greenberger
>StarDate:  3034.6
>
>Plot Summary:
>   Gamma Xaridian -- a peaceful Federation research colony that 
>becomes the third Federation world to suffer a brutal attack at 
>the hands of a mysterious alien fleet.  With Lt. Uhura gone on an 
>important mission of her own, Captain Kirk and the U.S.S. Enterprise 
>are dispatched to investigate the attacks, only to find the planets 
>completely devastated.

>Mr. Spock makes a startling discovery about the purpose behind the alien  
>attacks -- a purpose that, if realized, could have deadly consequences 
>for the Federation and the U.S.S. Enterprise...

     Despite its multiple-authorship, this one comes out as a fairly
good read.  What we have is basically a good mystery.  Who are the
raiders, and why are they attacking Federation colonies?  
     The plot is involving, and the dialogue is entertaining.

      Characterization:  3 
               Premise:  4

Next: Imbalance


>TNG #22 Imbalance                             Copyright June 1992
>Author:    V.E. Mitchell
>StarDate:  44839.2

>Plot Summary:   
>   The Jarada are a mysterious race of insectoid beings with an extreme   
>devotion to protocol.  When this usually reclusive race offer to open 
>diplomatic relations with the Federation, Captain Picard and the U.S.S.
>Enterprise are quickly ordered to Jarada to negotiate the exchange of
>Ambassadors.
>   When the ship arrives, the Jarada seem uncharacteristically friendly.
>The invite Picard to send down members of his crew and negotiations proceed
>both quickly and smoothly.  Suddenly, however, the Jarada change.  They cut
>off Commander Riker and his away team from the U.S.S. Enterprise and initiate
>an unprovoked attack on the ship.  Now Picard must unravel the aliens'
>mystery before it's too late for the away team -- and the U.S.S. Enterprise.

     Ms. Mitchell has a good premise here: another encounter with the
Jarada, a race of insectoid beings last seen in the TNG episode 
'The Big Goodbye'.  It's also good to be seeing more of O'Brien and
Keiko, but there are problems with that...
     This was quite a good novel, but one big thing kept detracting
from the story.  O'Brien and Keiko have a spat near the beginning of
the novel, and for most of the rest of it, the two engage in what
becomes extremely tiresome and annoying bickering...  This would
have fared slightly better if their dispute had been resolved more
quickly.
     
      Characterization:  3 [too much fighting between Keiko and O'Brien] 
               Premise:  4
         Plot Handling:  4 
             Narrative:  3 [ditto]

>tears itself apart!

     I mentioned earlier that _Probe_ wasn't the worst Trek novel
ever.  Well, it is saved from that distinction by this novel.
The characters are two-dimensional and paper-thin, the plot is
a transparent roller-coaster ride that only goes down, and the
premise is nearly ridiculous.  Add to this the terrible portrayal
of the central characters, and you have the makings of a total
disaster.... I would urge you to not only avoid reading this,
but burn any copies of it you may find. :-)

>Plot Summary:

>Riker -- an adventure that will take him across time, pit him 
>against one of his closest friends, and force him to choose between
>Starfleet's strictest rule and the one he calls Imzadi.

     Finally, Peter David returns.  I see some people say that
his plots are transparent and predictable, that the conclusion
can be seen after the first two chapters.  I certainly don't
agree with that.  And even if it were true, I think I'd still
enjoy PAD's books, because the narration is so well done.
     This novel is a great one for fans of time travel.  The
part about the early history between Riker and Troi does tend
to get thick, slow and wearying at points, but that is a minor
sticking point.  I really enjoyed this one.

>Plot Summary:
>   The planet Sanctuary -- A fabled world in unexplored space which is
>thought to be the last refuge of the persecuted, home to both the justly
>and unjustly accused.  Though its name has been translated into every

>   When the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise is assigned to capture a

>of the planet, Sanctuary.  Soon, Kirk and his crew are locked in a life
>and death struggle on the mysterious planet, which harbors deadly 
>secrets and never releases its visitors.

     John Vornholt seems to have tried to do just a little too much
this year.  Two novels published within two months of each other
leads me to believe that both got short shrift.
     This is a passable story, but not more than that.  The obviousness
of the plot, and the way the readers are treated as if they are stupid
bothers me quite a bit.  Was it really necessary to *SPELL OUT* for
us the method which the native species uses to reproduce?  And how
many people were surprised to learn that the girl the landing party
meets in the woods is Auk Rex?  I certainly wasn't.
     Other than those points, this worked pretty well, but it still
comes out as just average or less than average.

     Vornholt's second offering in as many months, this one fares con-
siderably worse than _Sanctuary_.  If you're sick of seeing Worf por-
trayed as a buffoonish wimp, then avoid this one...  I mean, come on;
Worf has difficulty defeating a teenage Klingon boy in hand-to-hand
combat??  Ridiculous.
     I was gratified to see Ensign Ro finally get a place in the novel
series -- until I read the novel, that is.  She seems to care quite a
bit too much what the colonists think of her...  And there are other
characterization problems.  Look at Guinan.  She is talking to Ro
in Ten Forward and says "I have a feeling you're desperately needed
down there"... NOT.  Wouldn't happen.  If a writer can't use a 
character well and correctly, they shouldn't attempt it.
     Vornholt's last two novels are decidedly disappointing after 
his outstanding work in _Masks_ and the slightly less equivocal 
_Contamination_.

     Diane Carey revives some of her characters from _Final_Frontier_
in this novel.  We get to see what James T. Kirk was like at the
age of sixteen, as well as some of the events that shaped him into
the Starship Captain we know.  
     The heavy Gothic focus on Kirk-as-god is noticeably absent here,
thankfully.  You won't get the impression from this one that she's 
in love with Kirk, either...  All you get is a fantastic journey into
Kirk's past.

     L.A. Graf strikes again.  The characters this time out are
just as flat as in _Ice_Trap_.  After two of these fiascos from
Graf, I think it's time we oust Kevin Ryan, and start publishing
novels ourselves... I've seen fan fiction over in alt.startrek.creative
that is better than this by a long shot...

     I have quite a bit to say about this one, but this is supposed
to be a quick review :-).  The characterization is lousy, the
premise is rather tired, and the dialogue is completely forgettable.
Add to this the plot that's about as deep as a cookie-sheet, and
you've got a real loser of a novel.  Avoid this one, everyone.
