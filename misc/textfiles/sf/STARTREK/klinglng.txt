1.  So you want to speak Klingon.
    vaj tlhIngan Hol Dajatlh 'e' DaneH

  All those neat harsh-sounding words, saliva flying everywhere,
and no words for "please" or "thank you".  You knew you just 
*had* to learn this language, if only to weird out your friends.

  You need to get a hold of some serious resources.  This document
will tell you all about those resources.  Plan on spending some
money.  And getting a large supply of napkins.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  The Klingon Dictionary.
    tlhIngan Hol mu'ghom

  This is the first reference any student of the Klingon Language
should purchase.  Half of it is a Klingon-English / English-Klingon
dictionary containing approximately 1850 words.  The other half
is an explanation of Klingon grammar.

  Make sure you get the 1992 version.  This version contains an
addendum.

  Purchasing information follows:

    Title:               The Klingon Dictionary
    Author:              Marc Okrand
    Publisher:           Pocket Books / Simon & Schuster Inc.
    Year of Publication: 1992
    ISBN:                0-671-74559-X
    Price:               US $10

3.  Klingon Language tapes.
    tlhIngan Hol qawHaq

  Yes, S&S realized the financial potential of all those
weird Trekkies.  Instead of saying, "Get a life!" they said, "Get
a tape!"  And so we now have two fine cassette tapes, "Conversational
Klingon" and "Power Klingon".

  "Conversational Klingon" is a humorous, extremely condensed form 
of The Klingon Dictionary.  Nevertheless, given that you get to actually
hear Marc Okrand, the inventor of the Klingon language, get a sore
throat over his Klingon consonants, and given that Michael Dorn, who plays
Worf on Star Trek: The Next Generation, narrates, this is one tape
not to be missed.

  "Power Klingon" is the successor to "Conversational Klingon".
While CK taught the basics of the language, "Power Klingon" moves
ahead to provide you with rich details of Klingon cultural events
and rituals.  My favorite part was the one about mating rituals --
Hey!  Slow down!  It'll still be there when you get there!

  Purchasing information follows:

4.  The Klingon Language Institute
    tlhIngan Hol yejHaD

  Rather than describing the KLI myself, I'll let this excerpt from
the introductory letter of the KLI do the job:

    Now in its second year of operation, the Klingon Language
  Institute continues its mission of bringing together individuals
  interested in the study of Klingon linguistics and culture, and
  providing a forum for discussion and the exchange of ideas.  Our
  membership is diverse, including Star Trek's fans with curiosity
  and questions about Klingon language, RP gamers wishing to lend
  some authenticity to a Klingon character, as well as students and
  professionals in the fields of linguistics, philology, computer
  science, and psychology who see the Klingon language as a useful
  metaphor in the classroom or simply wish to mix vocation with
  avocation.  Though based in the USA, the Institute is actually an
  international endeavor, presently reaching thirteen countries on
  six continents.

  Now doesn't your heart speed up when you read that?  The KLI's director 
is Lawrence M. Schoen, PhD.  The KLI publishes the Journal of the Klingon 
Language Institute, HolQeD. It is sent out four times per year.  Various 
other things, such as sponsored projects, are available through the KLI, 
and are mentioned elsewhere in this document.

5.  The Klingon Language Postal Course.
    tlhIngan Hol navHIjghach SoQ

  The Klingon Language Institute is sponsoring an excellent free course
by mail.  Here's the way it works.  To begin, send a self-addressed
manilla envelope, big enough for 8-1/2" x 11" papers, stamped with enough 
postage for a little over one oz. to David Barron, whose address is below.  
You will get back Lesson One. Learn the lesson, and answer the questions 
at the end.  Send your answers, along with another SASE, back to Mr.
Barron.  You will get back Lesson Two, along with your corrected answers
to Lesson One.  The cycle continues until the lessons run out.  There
are currently about ten lessons.

  This course presents much of the material of The Klingon Dictionary
in a more "bite-sized" form, allowing students to gradually increase
their knowledge of Klingon rather than giving it to them a la fire hose.

6.  Other Klingon Language Institute sponsored projects.
    tlhIngan Hol yejHaD numlu'ta'bogh jInmolmey pIm

  The KLI currently has four sponsored projects other than the 
Klingon Language Postal Course.  They are the Klingon Writing
Project, the Extended Corpus Project, the Klingon Bible Translation
Project and the Klingon Shakespeare Restoration Project.

  The Klingon Writing Project accepts fiction, nonfiction, and poetry
written in Klingon.  There is a proposed annual supplement for KLI
members, which presumably will contain the best works.

  The Extended Corpus Project is "an effort to compile a comprehensive
glossary of a Klingon names, terms, and phrases from the multitude of
canonical fiction published."

  The Klingon Bible Translation Project is a project to translate the Hebrew
and Christian Scriptures (AKA Old and New Testaments) into Klingon.

  The Klingon Shakespeare Restoration Project seeks to translate
Shakespearean prose from English into "the original Klingon".

  Information on these projects follows:

7.  Klingon Language mailing lists.
    tlhIngan Hol HablI'mey

  A Klingon Language mailing list is available for those with access
to Internet mail.  Send e-mail with Subject: subscribe to

  tlhIngan-Hol-request@klingon.east.sun.com

  The FAQ for the mailing list will be mailed to you upon subscription.
Information relating to translation is present in that FAQ.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

8.  The Klingon writing system.
    pIqaD

  There have been several Klingon writing systems published, but
there is really only one which is correct.  Basically, there are
three types of writing systems -- the Mandel set, the Paramount set,
and everything else.

  The Mandel set is reputed to be the first Klingon writing system.
It is in one-to-one correspondence to the English alphabet, which
makes it unsuitable for writing in Klingon.  It is solely used for
artistic appeal.  This set should not be used.

  The Paramount set is the correct Klingon writing system.  It is in
one-to-one correspondence with the Klingon phoneme set.  As such, 
it can be used for writing in Klingon.  The KLI supports the use
of this set.  Displays in Star Trek movies and ST:TNG which use this
set don't really say anything in Klingon -- the letters are used
for artistic appeal.

  Everything else is basically a sorry attempt to fit the English
alphabet to Klingon.  They never work, and should not be used.

  A Postscript font on disk of pIqaD -- both the Mandel set
and the Paramount set -- is available through the KLI for US $13.
Mac/Type I and Mac/TrueType are also available.

9.  Klingon language translation programs
    tlhIngan Hol mughwI'mey

  No, really.  They're very difficult to write, especially for us
amateur linguists ;-)  There are several translation programs being
worked on.  I am working on a C++/yacc E-to-K version in my spare time.
Too bad I have had so little spare time recently...

  If you would like to be listed as a translation program developer
here, please e-mail me.  Try to use the format for developers below,
but don't restrict yourself to it.  If you have something which 
doesn't fit easily into the format then break out of the format to
tell me about it.

  Developer information follows:

  Name:         Robert Baruch (baruch@nyenxst.com)
  Direction:    English to Klingon
  OS:           UNIX
  Program Name: parse (so far)
  Summary:      Uses C++ and yacc to parse English sentences.  Can
                handle ambiguous translations by outputting multiple
                translations for each interpretation.
  Devel. Stat:  v0.1 complete.  v0.2 under development
  Archive:      habli.tamu.edu(128.194.170.67):/parser/etok01.tgz
  Most impressive sentence translated:
    "my definite friends can not see your supposed big blue serpents"
    gharghmeyqoqraj tIn SuD leghlaHbe' juppu'na'wIj
    gharghmeyqoqlIj tIn SuD leghlaHbe' juppu'na'wIj


  Name:         Rick Klement (rick@infoserv.com)
  Direction:    Klingon to English
  OS:           UNIX (but pretty much generic C)
  Program Name: mugh (of course)
  Summary:      Uses C and a data file with the words (by type) in it.
                I started in lex but the compiles were getting too long.
                It understands verb prefixes and all verb and noun
                suffixes in order, and tries for the best match.
                It makes no attempt to produce good English, but just does
                the lookups for you.
  Devel. Stat:  Complete; adding more words.
  Archive:      none
  Most impressive sentence translated:  N/A

10. How to handle disparaging or obviously non-Klingon related posts

  I know, what is this doing in a Klingon language FAQ?  Because too
often I've seen net.flame.wars erupt over trivialities, and the
'fan' newsgroups usually bear the brunt of it, because fans are
*very* easy to rile.  A typical disparaging post on this newsgroup 
could be a "Klingons suck" post, or a "Get a life" post.  You know 
what non-Klingon related posts are -- the Jesus-is-coming posts, 
the recent "Blacknet" post, etc.

  Flame wars aren't fun.  They are unpleasant for others to view,
even though they might be fun for the participants.  So, here
are some suggestions which I've seen actually work:

A:  Ignore.  This clearly works with non-Klingon related posts.
    It is *true* that eventually the poster will go away -- what
    fun is it to bait net.readers who refuse to bite? No replies,
    and no mention of the post at all in any other posts.

    A disparaging post will often not contain any rational basis.  
    Hence, there can be no rational reply.  Ad hominem arguments 
    do not form a rational basis, and so cannot be replied to
    in a rational way.

B:  Respond in Klingon.  If a disparager wants to, he can learn
    Klingon to find out what was said.  Do not include a single
    word of English -- otherwise a convenient handle is given
    to continue the silliness.

C:  Don't be too quick to take offense.  When emotions run high,
    so will the mud-slinging.  Ignore the mud-slinging; stick to
    the subject at hand.  A discussion can degenerate all too
    easily because of a single off-hand statement.

    Similarly, some people will post remarks which can give
    offense but which have some indicator which shows that
    the remarks are given tongue-in-cheek.  Emoticons are the
    correct netiquette here, but it's not reasonable to assume
    that every user knows netiquette.

  In summary, don't do the expected, responding at the same level.
Always remember that there are at least hundreds of people watching 
you.  Some will choose to make fools out of themselves in front of
an audience; that is their problem, not yours.

  Finally, these aren't edicts.  They have been proven to work
(except for 'B', and theory is sound).  Try them!
