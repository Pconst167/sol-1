The date is the first date of satellite uplink.  Paramount's official 'week of'
   is two days later.  Stardates will be added when known.

Stardates
~~~~~~~~~
After the random stardates in the original "Star  Trek", the powers that be
decided on a more logical way to determine a stardate. Thus, the following
came about.

EXAMPLE: "Captains Log: Stardate 44502.7"

The first "4" represents that the series takes place in the 24th century.
The second "4" represents approximately one year in the trek timeline, or the
   season number of TNG without exception.
The "502" represents the portion of a year that advances during TNG.  Thus,
   each day represents 2.73 in Stardate.  In actual terms, this part is
   arbitrarily chosen, and advances during a story and a season.
The ".7" represents a portion of a day thereof.

Of course, the amount of time advanced in the TNG timeline is only a rough
   guess.

Picard violates the Prime Directive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"The Drumhead", it is recorded that Picard violated the Prime Directive nine
   times while in command of the Enterprise. This is what is believed to be the
   violations:
"Justice" - In order to save Wesley from the death penalty for(accidentally)
   violating one of the Edo laws.
"Angel One" - The crew barely managed to save the survivors of a Federation
   ship from death for trying to change the society of Angel One.
"Pen Pals" - Data communicates with a girl whose planet was slowly
   self-destructing.
"Up the Long Ladder" - Picard essentially forced the clone race to live and
   breed with the Bringloidi,  despite the strong resistance of the clone race
   and the fact that this would completely destroy the non-sexual nature of the
   clone race.
"The Ensigns of Command" - The Enterprise manages to delay a Sheliak vessel
   from destroying a Federation colony on Tau Cygna Five, even though the
   planet is part of the Sheliak Corporate.
"Who Watches the Watchers" -  The Enterprise treats a Mintakan person for
   serious injuries as a result of a Federation observation's post's hologram
   device's failure, ending with that race believing Picard was a God.
"The High Ground"  - The Enterprise engages in a commando raid in order to
   rescue Captain Picard and Beverly Crusher on a warring world.
"Legacy" - The commando raid might have radically changed the balance of power
   on the planet.
"First Contact" - The Enterprise contacts a planet in order to rescue Cmdr. 
   Riker.

Command Offered to Cmdr. Riker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
USS Drake     - "The Arsenal of Freedom"
USS Aries     - "The Icarus Factor"
USS Melbourne - "Best of Both Worlds"
(Riker was also given a field promotion to Captain and command of the
 Enterprise in "The Best of Both Worlds - Part 2", but return to Cmdr. and
 Second Officer of the Enterprise in "Family")
