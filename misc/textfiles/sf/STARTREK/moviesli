                        Star Trek Movie Lists of Lists
                            compiled by Mark Holtz
                          (Revised January 2, 1992)

DISCLAIMER: "Star  Trek",  "Enterprise",  and  all  other  related  items  are
copyright and  trademarks of  Paramount  Communications. Any  infringement  of
these lists  on Paramount's  legitimate copyright  and trademarks  are  purely
unintentional, and will be corrected upon proper notification. These lists are
for the enjoyment of the reader only, and may not be sold.

This is the Star Trek Movie Lists of  Lists. It contains a listing of all  the
"Star Trek" movie series,  plus some added notes.  This list comes out  around
the 1st every month. However, a posting may not come out due to events  beyond
my control.

If you are  wondering why I  compile these lists,  it is strictly  out of  the
enjoyment of "Star Trek", and enjoy a wealth of information from other  people
who post  on  the electronic  networks.  After  being irritated  by  the  ever
constant requests for episode lists on  Usenet, I decided that, in the  middle
of 1990, to  post a list  of episodes on  a regular basis.  It soon grew  from
that, and, with the  contributions of other people,  these lists grew to  what
you see today.  (And still  growing). The  only payment  I ask  is thanks  and
contributions, I am not making a dime off these compilations.

Special Requests for  Lists: This  list is NOT  available from  the author  at
sactoh0. However, FTP sites and  a mail server are  currently being set up  to
handle requests.

NOTE: This is the first editiion, and many changes still have to be made.

Did you know . . .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. . . That many of the sets  constructed for this movie have been re-used  and
re-dressed for the subsequent films and has been used (albiet painted over) on
Star Trek: The Next Generation.

. . . The  initial set construction  was originally supposed to  be for a  new
series that was going  to be a  flagship of a  proposed Paramount 4th  network
titled "Star Trek II"?

. . . The recreation  deck briefing consisted of  mostly Star Trek fans.  Word
leaked out that they needed  a lot of extras for  a day of shooting, and  many
fans showed up, on word  of mouth alone, for this  day of shooting. A  casting
call was never issued.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* During the climatic scene outside of the Enterprise (inside of V'ger), Kirk,
  Spock, and McCoy are all wearing jackets  with a colored band on the  sleve.
  Just after they  re-enter the  Enterprise and are  back on  the bridge,  the
  colors on Spock's and McCoy's jackets are switched.

Did you know . . .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. . . that  all of the actors  who played Khan's men  were, at the time,  male
strippers of Chippindales?

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* One of the best known SNAFU's is when Khan says to Chekov, "I never forget a
face". "Space Seed" aired  during the first seasion  of Star Trek, and  Chekov
joined the  crew during  the second  season. It  was known  before  production
started that this was an  error, and yet, the powers  that be did not want  to
leave out Walter Koenig.

* The blood stain on Kirk's jacket is constantly changing.

* When one of Khan's injured men is injured and says, "Yours is superior",  he
then dies with his eyes open. However,  when Khan hugs him, his eyes  suddenly
close.

"The cast and  crew of Star  Trek wish to  dedicate this film  to the men  and
women of the spaceship Challenger, whose  courageous spirit shall live to  the
23rd century and beyond. . . ."

                                Star Trek IV:
                               The Voyage Home

Movie Opened:

Stardate 8390: Kirk notes in his log entry that they are beginning their third
month of exile on  Vulcan. This means  that this film  takes place two  months
after the end of Star Trek III.

Did you know . . .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. . . In the scene where Uhura and Chekov are looking for the nuclear vessels,
a woman  passes by  and  says "Across  the bay,  in  Alameda." The  scene  was
originally written with noone responding, and  the woman was just passing  by,
unaware of any shooting that was going in.  They had to track her down to  get
her release on the film, and she just asked for a day's pay.

. . . Part of  the reason whales were featured  in this film was because  both
William Shatner  and  Leonard Nimoy  are  members  of the  "Save  The  Whales"
organization.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* In the dinner scene between  Kirk and Gillian, the  candle in the middle  of
  the table is constantly changing position.

                                 Star Trek V:
                              The Final Frontier

Movie Opened:

Did You Know . . .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. . . That  the shuttlebay in  Star Trek V is  the repainted royal  throneroom
>from Eddie Murphy's "Coming To America."

. . . Industrial Light and Magic was unable to do the special effects work for
Star  Trek  V  because  they  were  overloaded  with  the  effects  work   for
RCA/Columbia's "Ghostbusters II" and Paramount's  "Indiana Jones and the  Last
Crusade." A stock shot from  Star Trek IV was used  in Star Trek V, and  thus,
ILM has to receive credit.

Operation SNAFU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* In the opening sequence,  when Kirk falls off  the cliff, Spock catches  him
  before he crashes  into the ground.  Right after he's  caught, take a  close
  look at his shirt. One part of it is puffed out where wires are attached  to
  keep Shatner from swaying back and forth.

* Starfleet Headquarters is  in the  same time  zone as  Yosemite, when  Kirk,
  Spock and McCoy  leave Yosemite, it's  dark, yes, when  they are aboard  the
  Enterprise talking to "Bob" from Starfleet, it's daytime in the background.

* When Kirk, Spock,  and McCoy  shoot up  the accesway  aboard the  Enterprise
  while escaping Sybok's men, watch the  deck numbering. They pass by deck  52
  twice.

                            "For Gene Roddenberry"

                                Star Trek VI:
                           The Undiscovered Country

Movie Opened: December 6, 1991

TNG Sets
~~~~~~~~
- Look closely at the warp engines in Engineering. Straight out of TNG.

- Also,  look at  the presidents  office. Where  the view  screen is  where  a
certain bar is located. Also, look  at the windows. The president's office  is
Ten-Forward.

Operation Snafu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The Klingons on the bird of prey  have purple blood, but the Klingon at  the
end has red blood, which is seen on the spike on his shoulder. (UV)

- The closing credits  have Uhura listed as  "Uhuru". Oops, althouhg Uhuru  is
the proper Swahili spelling for "Freedom".

                       Wesley Eugene "Gene" Roddenberry
                      August 19, 1921 - October 24, 1991

He created a legend which continues on today, creating a show that has  helped
beleive that there was a future worth  living for. He showed us that space  is
not just for space battles, but for  learning new ideas and ways of  thinking,
and, indirectly, has  done more for  civil rights and  the space program  than
Martin Luther King, Jr. and John F. Kennedy. Gene will be missed, but will not
be forgotten.
