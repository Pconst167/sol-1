       1.0 INTRODUCTION TO NCC-2000 
            The USS Excelsior is  the  Federation's  newest  Battleship. 
       With  it's  state-of-the-art  TransWarp  Drive  and M-8 computer, 
       Excelsior is proven to be the most  powerful,  fastest  and  most 
       heavily armed ship ever constructed. 
            Now commanded by Captain Hiraku Sulu, the Excelsior has just 
       finished  it's  3-year  voyage exploring the Renevarian sector of 
       the Beta-Alpha quadrant. It was just refitted  and now going on a 
       8-year  mission.  This  ship,   along  side  the  USS  Enterprise 
       (Enterprise  class)  played  a vital role with the success of the 
       Khitomer conference. 
 
       1.1 MISSION OUTLINE 
 
            Excelsior is designed as a cruiser and explorer as well as a 
       battleship.  If a hostile situation  rises,  Excelsior  is  heavy 
       armed and well equipped of powerful Phasers and Photon Torpedoes. 
       Normally, Excelsior is a Mark XIII Heavy Crusier with an enormous 
       sensor capacity. 
 
       1.2 DEVELOPMENT OF NX-2000 
 
            On  September  16,  2278 the devolpment of the most powerful 
       ship was approved by Starfleet and began designing the NX-2000, a 
       prototype starship with a unique propulsion system that  will  be 
       able to break the Warp 10 barrier with ease. Here is a summary on 
       how the construction proceeded= 
 
       2278- Excelsior project approved, Design centers begin working on 
       design. 
       2279- Design work continues,  Dr.  Mornay, Sarda and Perren begin 
       work on TransWarp Drive. 
       2280- Design work finished, construction of space-frame begins in 
       Antares Ship Yards. 
       2281- Space-frame completed, Hull construction begins,  TransWarp 
       design completed and is beginning construction on Computer cores, 
       TransWarp engines and Impulse drive. 
       2282-   Hull   construction  completed,   all  systems  beginning 
       construction. 
       2283- Ship construction completed, tests begin on new technology. 
       2284-  Testing  continues,   TransWarp  Drive  is  sabotaged   by 
       Enterprise. TransWarp drive repaired and completed. 
       2285- Trial runs, Excelsior breaks Warp 10 barrier and breaks the 
       speed record set by USS Enterprise at Warp 16. 
       2286- Excelsior is Commissioned, Misc. Assignments 
       2288-  Excelsior  given  to  Sulu  at given it's registry number= 
       NCC-2000. 3-year mission begins. 
       2291- Excelsior returns from 3-year mission.  Khitomer  confrence 
       insident. Refit begins. 
       2292-   Excelsior   finishes  refit,   now  undergoing  a  8-year 
       exploration mission of the Unknown  areas  of  space  beyond  the 
       boundries of Alpha-Quadrant. 
       2300- Excelsior Returns fro 8-year mission, refit begins. 
 
  
 
 
       2.0 SPACECRAFT STRUCTURE 
 
            The Excelsior's structure is well-designed and very strong. 
 
       2.1 SKELETAL STRUCTURE AND DESIGN 
 
            Excelsior  uses  a  tritanium\duranium interlocking skeleton 
       structure and is plated over with  a  tritanium\titanium\duranium 
       filaments  that  weave  together  giving  it an enormously strong 
       armor.  This armor can withstand  Phaser  blasts  and  will  have 
       little damage done from Photon Torpedoes. 
 
       2.2 HULL LAYERS AND MATERIALS 
 
            The  outermost  of the hull is a tritanium\titanium\duranium 
       alloy that weaves and interlocks with each other.  On  the  outer 
       surface  of  this  plating  is  the  Deflector  shield  grid that 
       projects a material of diburnium\osmium that acts as a solid. The 
       next is electon bonded duranium,  then the radiation  attenuation 
       which  provides  protection  from  radiation  in  space.  Thermal 
       insulation and tritanium truss framework follow. The innermost is 
       a ceramic fabric chemically bonded with tritanium foil. 
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
       3.0 COMMAND SYSTEMS 
 
            These  follow=   Bridge,   Auxiliary   Control,   and   Main 
       Engineering. 
 
       3.1 BRIDGE 
 
            The  main  bridge  is located in deck 1 on top of the saucer 
       section.  Going left from the viewing screen there  are=  Weapons 
       sub  systems,  Environmental,  Turbo-Lift,  Sciences  and Library 
       Computer, Tactical, Master Situation,  Tactical,  Communications, 
       Turbo-Lift,  Engineering,  and Navigational sub systems. In front 
       of the commanding officer is the Helm  and  Navigation  stations. 
       Here are the stations and there functions- 
       WEAPONS  SUB-SYTEMS-  This  controls all weapons and shields.  It 
       also displays the enemies potential. 
       ENVIRONMENTAL-  This  controls  all  life-support,   gravity  and 
       environmental systems. 
       SCIENCES   AND  LIBRARY  COMPUTER-  This  controls  all  sensors, 
       scanning and the library computer. 
       TACTICAL-  This  controls  all  defensive  systems  and  starship 
       security, displays enemy and controls all systems. 
       MASTER  SITUATION-  This large wall display features a cutaway of 
       the starship show key systems and hardware. 
       COMMUNICATION- This controls all  sub-space  radio  and  internal 
       communications. 
       ENGINEERING-   This  controls  all  TransWarp  systems,   Impulse 
       systems, and all related sub-systems. 
  
 
 
       NAVIGATIONAL SUB-SYSTEMS- This controls all navigational  systems 
       and  course  controls.  It  also  has  access  to  a navigational 
       computer. 
       HELM- This controls all ship movement and control. 
       NAVIGATION- this controls all course plotting. 
 
       3.2 AUXILIARY CONTROL 
 
            Located on Decks 8 and 19,  these control rooms operate  the 
       same functions as the main bridge.  These rooms are used in heavy 
       combat or the main bridge is unihabital. 
 
       3.3 MAIN ENGINEERING 
 
            Located on decks 20,21,  and 22,  Main Engineering  controls 
       all Excelsior's systems and power distribution. Deck 20 is mainly 
       for   the  control  of  the  ship's  engines,   Deck  21  is  for 
       Environmental and life-support  systems  and  22  for  everything 
       else. 
       --------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
       4.0 COMPUTER SYSTEMS 
 
            There  are  2  computer  cores  on  the Excelsior,  1 in the 
       primary hull, and 1 in the secondary. These computers contain all 
       known information of the federation. It also controls all systems 
       and sub-systems. 
 
       4.1 SYSTEM AND OPERATIONS 
 
            The M-8 computer is designed exclusively for  the  Excelsior 
       to control it's new TransWarp drive and systems.  It is a monster 
       computer,  the largest ever constructed.  It  is  also  the  most 
       advanced. 
 
       4.2 DESIGN AND MISCELLANEOUS OPERATIONS 
 
            With  a  response  time  at the speed of light,  there is no 
       longer the  computer voice; "Working.....".  The response time is 
       instantaneous. The Billions of Megabytes contain all Knowledge. 
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
       5.0 TRANSWARP PROPULSION SYSTEMS 
 
            TransWarp  is the newest is Warp technology.  It has changed 
       the course of the  federation.  Although  the  concepts  of  this 
       engine  is poorly understood,  some say the designer's aren't for 
       sure.  Excelsior's TransWarp Drive is a FTWA  class.  They  weigh 
       78,000 metric tons each. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
       5.1 TRANSWARP THEORY AND APPLICATION 
 
            TransWarp  drive  was invented by Dr.  Mornay and the Vulcan 
       physicists Sarda and Perren.  They  invented  a  small  TransWarp 
       drive using Trilythium crystals and transporter technology.  When 
       they tested it with a computer,  they found that  ship  would  be 
       propelled  to  an  amazing Warp 14.  They were astonished because 
       this speed had never been reached.  They provided their notes  to 
       Shuvinaaljis  Warp  Technologies  and  produced 2 FTWA which were 
       mounted on the Excelsior. 
            The basic theory of how the TransWarp drive really works  is 
       this= The engines and transporters work in Tandem. Basically, the 
       ship  puts  a transporter field around the ship's engines,  which 
       have the ability to use this field in conjunction with  the  Warp 
       Envelope,  with  the  ship  in effect beaming itself ahead in the 
       Envelope.  As long as the transporter field is activated the ship 
       can  attend  phenomenal speeds,  reaching Warp 23 in an emergency 
       and Warp 20 for  a  indefinite  cruising  time.  The  Transporter 
       technology  is  similar  to the Personnel and Cargo transporters, 
       the field generator mounted in the Nacelles is much  larger  than 
       has ever been constructed. 
 
       Warp 11- 1,331c     Warp 17- 4,913c     Warp 23- 12,167c 
       Warp 12- 1,728c     Warp 18- 5,832c 
       Warp 13- 2,197c     Warp 19- 6,859c 
       Warp 14- 2,744c     Warp 20- 8,000c 
       Warp 15- 3,375c     Warp 21- 9,261c 
       Warp 16- 4,096c     Warp 22- 10,648c 
 
       5.2 MATTER\ANTIMATTER REACTION ACCEMBLY 
 
            To  provide  the  TransWarp  drive  with  it's  Energy,  the 
       Designer's had to come up with a new  kind  of  M\AM  reactor  to 
       fulfill  it's  power needs.  So the designer's came up with a new 
       Reactor that would create  much  more  power  than  the  previous 
       transfer  conduits.  This  new  reactor would place the Deuterium 
       tank in the upper secondary hull and the AntiMatter tanks in  the 
       bottom  of  the  secondary  hull.  The reactor would transfer the 
       matter and antimatter together to meet in the Trilythium reactor. 
       This energy is transferred to the EPS power  distribution  center 
       were then it is transferred in conduits to the TransWarp engines. 
 
       5.3 TRILYTHIUM CRYSTALS 
 
            Trilythium is the only known substance that can be used with 
       the TransWarp Drive.  Dilithium, the normal fuel reactant for the 
       Warp Drive,  will not the TransWarp drive operate.  Although this 
       is Unknown why the TWPS make this so,  some experts say that it's 
       molecular  pattern  disrupts  the  Transporter  field  Generator. 
       Trilythium  is so rare,  that many people have never heard of it. 
       Trilythium is found on vey few planets in the known galaxy.  It's 
       molecular pattern is Undetermined. 
 
 
  
 
 
       5.4 NACELLES AND TRANSWARP ENGINE 
 
            In the front of the nacelle is the Hydrogen\Bussard ramscoop 
       that transfers Hydrogen atoms into power. The rest of the nacelle 
       is  were  the  standard  warp engines are.  In the aft-end of the 
       nacelle it where the TransWarp  Transporter  Field  Generator  is 
       mounted.  Outlining  the Warp Field Grid is the Transporter field 
       outputters.  This  projects  the  Warp  Field  Envelope  and  the 
       Transporter  field  that  surrounds  the  Engines.  The TransWarp 
       Engine is mostly made up of pure Nuetronium,  the strongest known 
       element. 
 
       5.5 FUEL\STORAGE\GENERATION 
 
            The USS Excelsior uses Deuterium and Anti-Duetrium to create 
       it's enormous power needs.  When Matter (Deuterium) collides with 
       Anti-Matter (Anti-Duetrium)  it  totally  annihilates,  producing 
       energetic  gamma  rays.  Other Anti-particles and Particles pairs 
       produce sub-atomic particles and energy. Anti-matter is stored is 
       Electromagnetic tanks within the secondary hull of the Excelsior. 
       The Deuterium (as with the Anti-Duetrium) is stored in  a  plasma 
       ("slush")  state  in a very large tank contained in the secondary 
       hull.  If emergency fuel is needed,  and the Excelsior is too far 
       away from a StarBase or a Fuel tanker,  it can generate Deuterium 
       by collecting Hydrogen atoms,  or it  can  use  it's  Anti-matter 
       generator to generate small amounts of fuel.  This is only for an 
       emergency for it cannot generate enough to run a long  period  of 
       time (more than 3 days). 
 
       5.6 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 
 
            If the TransWarp drive has sustained enough damage, they can 
       be  shutdown or jettisoned at a rate of 150 meters\second.  After 
       shutdown,  all personnel attempting to repair damage  within  the 
       Nacelle  are required to wear Rad Suits.  The M\AM reactor can be 
       jettisoned,  but only in  a  life-threating  situation.  Usually, 
       shutdown  is the best way,  for the M\AM reactor fuels the entire 
       starship. 
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
       6.0 IMPULSE PROPULSION SYSTEMS 
 
            All  principal  Sublight  propulsion  and  auxiliary   power 
       generating operations are handled by the Impulse Engines.  Fed by 
       Fusion Reactors,  the Impulse Drive moves the Excelsior to  .9125 
       times  the  speed  of  light.  The  class of the Impulse Drive is 
       FIG-2. 
 
       6.1 IMPULSE DRIVE 
 
            Using Deuterium and Fusion Reactors,  the Excelsior produces 
       power  to  drive the ship SubLight speeds.  The Impulse moves the 
       ship when it is not in the TransWarp field. The Impulse engines 
  
 
 
       also produce Auxiliary power for emergency  uses.  Although  this 
       not enough power to run the TransWarp drive, but it can provide a 
       short punch of energy to run the Warp Drive for 3.2321673 hours. 
 
       6.2 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 
 
            If  the  Fusion  Reactor is damaged,  it can be shutdown and 
       repaired.  Jettising the Impulse Drive can be done,  but as  with 
       the TransWarp drive, only in life-threating situations. 
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
       7.0 MISCELLANEOUS SYSTEMS 
 
            This is on all the other systems on the Excelsior. 
 
       7.1 NAVIGATIONAL DEFLECTOR 
 
            The  Navigational  Deflector is a "Shield" that protects the 
       Excelsior from derbis,  asteroids,  etc.  Using Graviton Polarity 
       Source  Generators,   the  flux  energy  output  neutralizes  all 
       material infront of the Excelsior.  This also acts  as  the  Main 
       Sensor Dish and can scan with enormous detail and accuracy. 
 
       7.2 LIFE-SUPPORT 
 
            Life-Support is what produces the gravity,  air, water, food 
       and light to keep us alive. It is the most durable system, for it 
       can keep going even if there is very  little  power.  The  Graviy 
       generators produce the gravity (at .92 g's),  the air-replicators 
       recycle the the air, the water generator produces the water,  and 
       the food-replicators produce food. 
 
       7.3 PHASERS 
 
            Phasers are PHASed Energy Rectifacation, which use energy as 
       a weapon.  The Excelsior's phaser banks,  Type FH-11 are the most 
       powerful in Starfleet.  There are 8 of them in banks of  5  each. 
       They are located at= 2 front port,  2 front starboard, 2 front, 2 
       aft.  They can be Pulse or Steady-Stream,  Thin  or  Wide,  Stun, 
       Heat, Disrupt, Dematerialize, or Explode settings. There are also 
       8 FH-5 banks that provide more protection. 
 
       7.4 PHOTON TORPEDOES 
 
            Photon Torpedoes are Matter\AntiMatter Explosion device that 
       can  be  used  at  Warp  Velocities.  They  contain Deuterium and 
       Anti-Duetrium held in suspension,  and when the torpedo hits  the 
       target,  the  field  is  released and annihilation occurs with an 
       enormous impact.  The PhoTorp,  was originally developed  by  the 
       Romulans, is the Federation's best weapon. It can be used at Warp 
       velocities.  Excelsior's type is FP-4,  with 6 banks,  1 front, 2 
       front port, 2 front starboard, 1 aft. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
       7.5 SHIELDS 
 
            Defensive Shields,  like  the  Navigational  Deflector,  use 
       Graviton   Polarity   Generators.   These  generators  produce  a 
       Diburnium\Osmium that acts as a solid.  But,  when it is hit by a 
       weapon,  it  dissipates.  If the shields are hit too many and too 
       much times, the Deflector Shields will fail. Diburnium and Osmium 
       were discovered at StarDate 5978.2, this substance was created by 
       the lost Kaladan race, and was recorded by science officer Spock. 
       Type FSS. 
 
       7.6 TRACTOR BEAMS 
 
            Tractor Beams are designed to pull an object to or  hold  it 
       in  place.  If  the object is bigger than the Excelsior,  it will 
       pull  the  Excelsior  closer  to   it.   Tractor   Beams   employ 
       Superimposed  Subspace\Gravaton  force beam.  There are 3 Tractor 
       Beams on the Excelsior, 2 to the front, 1 in the rear. 
 
       7.7 TRANSWARP RADIO 
 
            TransWarp  radio  is  the  only  practical  way  to  send  a 
       transmission.  The  Excelsior will easily outrun normal sub-space 
       transmissions,  so the TransWarp Radio was designed,  tested  and 
       approved.  It is similar to sub-space radio,  but this radio uses 
       Ionized Graviton Flux Transmissions (IGFT).  The IGFT uses a High 
       frequency and travels around 18,000c, an enormous speed. But even 
       at  that speed,  a transmission may take days,  even weeks if the 
       ship is far out enough. 
 
       7.8 SENSORS 
 
            The Sensors aboard the  Excelsior  are  the  most  accurate, 
       detailed   and   sophisticated   ever   designed.   They  include 
       everything= heat, light, radiation,  spectral and thermal,  life, 
       physical,  spectro,  flux,  gamma,  graviton,  stellar, particle, 
       sub-space, quark, sub-atomic, photon, optical, and magnetic. With 
       all these sensors,  Excelsior is the most advanced starship  ever 
       constructed. 
 
       7.9 TRANSPORTER 
 
            Transporter is the only practical way to transport away from 
       the ship. The Transporter is what makes the TransWarp Drive work. 
       Objects are recorded, dematerialized, transported and reassembled 
       at the destination.  There are 6 personnel(6),  6 emergency (22), 
       and 3 cargo transporters on  the  Excelsior.  Unfortunately,  the 
       Transporter can't be used in TransWarp or through Shields. 
 
       8.0 MISCELLANEOUS 
 
 
 
  
 
 
       8.1 SHUTTLEBAYS AND SHUTTLECRAFT 
 
            The  ShuttleBay is located on top of the secondary hull.  It 
       uses a forcefield to keep in  the  ship's  atmosphere  while  the 
       shuttlebay doors are open.  It also has a tractor beam that locks 
       on and pulls in the ShuttleCraft.  On the Excelsior,  there are a 
       total of 20 ShuttleCraft, here are the types- Type 15, 16, 6, and 
       7. There are also 7 work bees for ExtraVechilar work. 
 
       8.2 CREW-SUPPORT 
 
            Each  person  on board the Excelsior has 90 square meters of 
       living  space.   This  is  luxurious,   compared  to  most  other 
       starships.  Crew  Quarters  consists  of  a  sleeping area with a 
       Queen-size bed, a dresser,  a Walk-in closet and shelves;  living 
       area with a table,  a booth,  food-dispencers, a work area with a 
       library computer terminal and a desk;  and then the  head,  which 
       contains a jucuzzi,  sonic shower,  sink,  toilet,  bathtub and a 
       cabinet for toiletry objects. 
 
       8.3 MEDICAL FACILITIES 
 
            Located on Deck 8, Sickbay contains state-of-the-art medical 
       facilities and equipment.  The finest in Starfleet,  there is the 
       Intensive Care Units,  the Examination room,  ICP unit, Operating 
       rooms, and dozens of office's and labs. Almost any disease can be 
       analysized and identified even if it was never encountered.  With 
       a .1863% failure of not finding a cure. 
 
       8.4 RECREATIONAL FACILITIES 
 
            There  are  many  facilities devoted entirely to Recreation. 
       There is an Officer's lounge, Crew Lounge, 3 Rec. Decks with many 
       games including Racquetball courts, Volleyball courts, Tennis and 
       Badminton courts and a Bowling Alley;  4  Simulation  rooms  that 
       produce holographic images of whatever the person desires;  and a 
       Botanical Garden with many varieties of Trees,  Flowers,  Plants, 
       Fish and Animals.  There are also 6\3-d theaters with movies from 
       the 20th, 21st, 22nd, and 23rd centuries. 
 
       8.5 TURBO-LIFTS 
 
            Turbo-lifts on the Excelsior are  Voice-Activated  and  will 
       take the user under 10 seconds to reach any destination. 
 
       8.6 MODES 
 
            There are typically 5 modes on the Excelsior- 
            Cruise Mode- Normal Operations 
            Yellow Alert- Alert Operations 
            Red Alert- Emergency Operations 
            External Support Mode- Docked at Starbase 
            Reduced Power Mode- When power drops below 26% of Normal 
 
  
 
 
 
       8.7 EMERGENCY OPERATIONS\SELF-DESTRUCT 
 
            If the hull aboard the Excelsior is punctured,  safety doors 
       aboard the Excelsior will  automatically  close  and  seal  until 
       repairs can be made. If a person or persons are trapped between 2 
       safety doors, there is enough food, water and air to support them 
       until  help arrives.  If the Excelsior gets into Enemy hands,  it 
       can be self-destructed by the code of the  Captain,  1st  Officer 
       and   the  Chief  Engineer.   There  are  3  different  modes  of 
       self-destructing, here they are- 
            Code 1- All Matter and Antimatter come together to create an 
       enormous fireball that will engulf any  near  planets,  ships  or 
       moons. 
            Code  2-  The AntiMatter tanks are ejected and the explosive 
       bolts throughout the ship will destroy the ship. 
            Code 3- AntiMatter tanks are ejected and  the  ship's  bolts 
       destroy some of it, the rest to crash on a planet, star or moon. 
 
       8.8 SHIP CONSTRUCTION 
 
            There are currently 94 Excelsiors commissioned. In gratitude 
       for  the  Khitomer  conference,  a  Excelsior-class  ship will be 
       registered as NCC-1701-B in honor of the USS Enterprise.    Ships 
       constructed are listed in the appendix. Currently there are 94.

       APPENDIX 1               SHIP HISTORY 
 
            On  StarDate 2/2210,  the first of the new battleships,  the 
       USS Excelsior,  was commissioned.  This vessel is the  newest  in 
       Star  Fleet,  and  it  incorporates  many  experimental operating 
       systems.  Since that time,  93 more have been  commissioned.  All 
       these  Battleships  are  being  constructed  at  Sol  III  and IV 
       shipyards. 
            The Excelsior has been called "The Great Experiment" by many 
       in influencial circles. These ships are the newest of any in Star 
       Fleet and incorporate experimental  technology  in  most  of  its 
       components  required  to  operate  a  warship.  With  so many new 
       systems aboard these vessels,  the process of  testing  them  has 
       been  slow.  Prior  to  being installed,  each component has been 
       tested and re-tested until it met standards.  Nevertheless,  when 
       the USS Excelsior was taken out for trials,  the evaluation teams 
       were constantly faced with primary system malfunctions that would 
       not allow any of the secondary or back-up systems to  be  tested. 
       This caused the evaluators to deal with these new components on a 
       one-at-a-time   basis,   and   thus   creating   time  delays  in 
       commissioning of the class.
