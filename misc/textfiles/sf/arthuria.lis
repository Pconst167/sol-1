New category: "Magazines and Articles" and "Organizations" added.

This is a reading list involving the Arthurian legend.  For its
original inception, I would like to thank the readers of the Camelot
mailing list (address is listed in Organizations).  I wrote a good
many of the original reviews when I was a member, but since then a
number of people have submitted additional references for inclusion
into this list.

My criterion for these books is that it be concerned with the Arthur
legend in some way.  I have several categories:
  * Fiction: novelizations of the Camelot legend, or novels that use
    elements of the legend.
  * Poetry: poetic renditions of the legend.
  * Non-Fiction and research: includes research into the origin of the
    legends, speculation on who the original characters might have
    been, studies and critiques of medieval sources, literary
    criticism, etc.
  * Medieval and Early Texts: original or modern translations of texts
    written before 16th century or so (an arbitrary divison point I
    used).
  * Magazines and Articles: references that appear in magazines and
    articles.  These are typically research notes.
  * Arthurian references: novelizations that use the legend in a minor
    way or as secondary characters.
  * Celtic Fiction: reworkings (novelizations) of traditional Celtic
    stories.  I suppose I could have a category for research into
    celtic fiction, but the ones I consider relevant are in the
    non-fiction and research section above.
  * Organizations: finally, I provide a list of organizations dealing
    with the Camelot legend.  This is not meant to be exhaustive.

In general, related stories are acceptable (such as Tristam and
Iseult).  Out-of-time stories are acceptable as long as they still
center on the Arthur myth (Kennealy's _Hawk's Gray Feather_) or are
talking about his return (_Sir Machinery_ and others).  References to
Arthurian elements are also acceptable, but I do not put all of them
in (a complete listing would be very large!); only the ones that seem
interesting.  The Celtic works are included, because many of them
apparently provide an early genesis for the Arthurian stories, and
others are stories derived from minor characters in the Arthurian
stories (or perhaps the other way around, characters from well known
stories got honorable mention in these later stories --- who can
tell?).

Disclaimer: I have not vouched for the accuracy of each and every
entry in this list.  If you find mistakes or have additional
information on a reference, by all means, let me know.  I likewise
appreciate any additions to this list.  Send them to the addresses at
the end of this posting.

1. Fiction

_The Romance of King Arthur_ (Mayflower, 1979.  Reprint of 1917
Edition.  ISBN 08317-7460-6.)

Ashley, Mike, _The Pendragon Chronicles_ (Peter Bedrick Books, New York,
1991.  ISBN 0-87226-228-6.  paperback.)  Anthology includes stories by
Andre Norton, John Steinback and Jane Yolen.

Berger, Thomas, _Arthur Rex_.  Berger is the author of _Little Big
Man_, _Neighbors_, and a number of other books.  This retelling of the
Arthur legend is somewhat reminiscent of the movie "Excalibur" in
feel.

Bradley, Marion Zimmer, _The Mists of Avalon_ (Del Rey.  Ballantine
Books, New York, 1982.  ISBN 0-345-35049-9.  Hardcover and trade
paperback.)  A female oriented and positive rendition of the Arthurian
legend.  Considerably more sympathetic to pagan religions (although
depicted as modern neopaganism) than to Christianity.

Bradshaw, Gillian, _Hawk of May, _Kingdom of Summer, _In Winter's
Shadow_ (Menthuen Paperbacks, Great Britain also Signet Books, 1980
also hardcover by Simon and Schuster.)  The story of Gwalchmai, one of
Arthur's Knights.  He is god-touched with fighting madness and is one
of the brothers of Medraut (Mordred). _Down the Long Wind_ is the single
book volume version of the three books.

Bulfinch, Thomas, _Age of Chivalry: or, King Arthur and His Knights_
(John D. Morris, Philadelphia, 1898, many reprints).  Published in
their own right, also found in _Bulfinch's Contains long summaries of
the Camelot legends and of the French Charlemagne legends.

Canning, Victor.  _The Crimson Chalice_.  Originally published as _La
Leggenda del Calice Cremisi_.  Translated by Patrizia Rognoni, Codice
Libro 22 006 CN, Casa Editrice Nord S.r.l., via Rubens 25, 20148
Milano, Italia; Copyright by Victor Canning 1976, 1977, 1978, and for
the Italian edition by the publisher in 1990 (first edition, of the
Italian translation, June 1990).  An "Arthur as Celtic Chieftain"
book, with nice twists.

Carmichael, Douglas, _Pendragon: an Historical Novel_ (Blackwater
Press, New York, dist. by Exposition Press, 1977).  Arthurian
romances -- adaptions.

Chapman, Vera, _The King's Damosel_, _The Green Knight_, and _King
Arther's Daughter_.  Out of print.

Christian, Catherine, _The Pendragon_ (Warner Books, 1978.)  A story
told by Bedivere (the original lover of Guinevere before Lancelot
was added to the legend by the French in the 14th century or so).

David, Peter, _Knight Life_ (Ace Fantasy, 1987.) A comedic book
about Arthur's return in modern day.

Gemmell, David.  _Ghost King_ and _Last Sword of Power_.  A fictional
account of the life and times of Arthur, bearing little resemblance to
the usual myths.

Gross, Gwen, _Knights of the Round Table_ (Illustrated by Norman
Green, Random House, New York, 1985).

Finkel, George, _The Twilight Province_ (London: Angus & Robinson,
1967.)  This is an excellent "young adult" tale about a late Roman,
northern Arthur based on the Bamburgh Castle, Newcastle/Tyne area of
northeastern Britain.

Fraser, Antonia, _King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table_
(Illustrated by Rebecca Fraser, Knopf, Random House, New York, 1970).
First published under title: _King Arthur_. Retellings of seventeen
tales about King Arthur, Lancelot, Gawaine, Tristram, and other
knights of the Round Table.  Juvenile.

French, Allen, _Sir Marrok, a tale of the days of King Arthur_ (The
Century Co., New York, 1902).

Frith, Henry, _King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table_ (G.
Routledge and Sons, London/New York, 1884).

Frost, William Henry, _The Court of King Arthur; Stories from the
land of the Round Table_ (Illustrated by Sydney Richmond Burleigh, C.
Scribners Sons, New York, 1903).

Gloag, John, _Artorius Rex_ (New York: St. Martin's, 1977.)  This is
the final volume in a late Roman trilogy with two "pre-Arthurian"
novels titled _The Caesar of the Narrow Seas_ and _The Eagles Depart_.
_Artorius Rex_ is another Romano-Celtic tale which attempts a
historical reconstruction.

Godwin, Parke, _The Last Rainbow_, _Fire Lord_, _Beloved Exile_
(Bantam Books).  His characters are terrific, the sense of time and
place eye opening.  Arthur in the beginning is a native officer in the
Roman legions guarding the northern borders.  

Godwin, Parke, _Invitation to Camelot_ (Ace, 1988.)  An anthology
including stories by Tanith Lee, Morgan Llywelyn, Elizabeth
Scarborough and Jane Yolen.

Haar (Hoar?), J. T.  _King Arthur_ (New York: Crane Russak, c.1967,
1975.)

Hanratty, Peter, _The Book of Mordred_ and _The Last Knight of Albion_
(Ace Fantasy and Bluejay Books.  ISBNs 0-441-07018-3 and
0-312-94271-8.  Paperback and trade paperback.)  A retelling of the
Arthurian legend in a bizarre mix of modern and ancient times.

Hanson, Charles Henry, _Stories of the Days of King Arthur_ (With
illustrations by Gustave Dore, T. Nelson, London/Edinbugh/New York,
1898).

Hastings, Selina, _Sir Gawain and the Loathly Lady_ (Lothrop, Lee &
Shepard Books, New York, 1985).

Humble, William F.  _A Tale of Arthur_ (Anthony Blond, London, 1967).

Jones, Courtway, _In the Shadow of the Oak King_.  It apparently
tries to tell the story in a historically 'realistic' setting (i.e.,
without grafting the high middle ages onto sixth century Britain).

Jones, Mary J., _Avalon_ (The Naiad Press, ISBN: 0-941483-96-7, 1991).
This is set in the closing days of King Arthur's reign and mostly
concerns the Lady of the Lake at that time (Argante, whom I don't
believe appears in any legend; her predecessor is Nimue), with some
recounting of her childhood.  Definitely a feminist reading, and not
as well done as _Mist of Avalon_, for example.  It is also curiously
incomplete.  More books may be planned.

Katz, Welwyn Wilton, _The Third Magic_ (Groundwood Books/Douglas &
McIntyre, ISBN (bound): 0-88899-068-5 (pbk): 0-88899-126-6, 1988).  A
"young adult" book, this one has one of the more imaginative
retellings of the Arthurian legend.

Kennealy, Patricia, _The Hawk's Gray Feather_ (ROC (division of
Penguin Books), ISBN 0-451-45053-1, 1990). First in _The Tales of
Arthur_, a series in which the later books have not yet been
published.  Builds upon the world of _The Silver Branch_, _The Copper
Crown_ and _The Throne of Scone_ in which the Sidhe were aliens.  This
book is set much earlier.  A good fantasy/SF blend.

Lanier, Sidney, ed., _King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table_,
(Grosset & Dunlap, 1950. ISBN 0-448-06016-7.)  A reasonable children's
version.  The Scribner, New York edition is illustrated by N.C. Wyeth.
Original copyright in 1924.

Lang, Andrew, _Tales of the Round Table_ (London, New York :
Longmans, Green, 1923).  Based on the tales in the _Book of Romance_
edited by Andrew Lang.

Latymer, Baron Francis Burdett Thomas Coutts-Nevill, _The Romance of
King Arthur_, (London, John Lane; New York, John Lange Co.  1907).

Lawhead, Stephen, _Taliesin_, _Merlin_, _Arthur_ (Avon Books, plus
British and Australian printings. 1988).  _Pendragon_ is supposed to
complete this series, but I haven't seen it in print yet.  Lawhead is
an excellent writer and these stories make a very good read.

McDermott, Gerald, _The Knight of the Lion_ (New York : Four Winds
Press, c1979).  Juvenile: a retelling of the adventures of Sir Yvain
and his faithful lion, as the young knight goes through several
trials to prove himsself worthy of a great triumph.

McGowen, Tom, _Sir Machinery_ (Folet Publishing Company, Chicago, 1970.
ISBN 0-695-40167-X hardback, 0-695-80167-8 trade paperback.)  An amusing
children's tale set in modern days.  Based upon the notion that King
Arthur will come back to save Britain again.

Marshall, Edison, _The Pagan King_ (Garden City, N.Y., Doubleday, 1959).

Matthews, John, ed., _An Arthurian Reader: Selections from Arthurian
Legend, Scholarship, and Story_ (Aquarian Press, Sterling Publishing
Company, New York, 1988).

Monaco, Richard, _Parsival or a Knight's Tale_, _The Grail War_, and
_The Final Quest_ (Berkley Books, New York, 1983.  ISBN 0-425-05143-9.
Paperback).

Munn, H. Warner, _Merlin's Godson_ (1st Ballantine Books ed. New York:
Ballantine Books, c1976). Originally published as 2 separate works:
_King of the World's Edge_ and _The Ship from Atlantis_.

Munn, H. Warner, _Merlin's Ring_, (New York, Ballantine Books
[1974]).  Sequel or related to _Merlin's Godson_.

Newell, William Wells, _King Arthur and the table round : tales
chiefly after the Old French of Crestien of Troyes : with an account
of Arthurian romance, and notes_ (1897).

Newman, Sharon, _Guinevere, The Chessboard Queen_, _?_, _Guinevere
Evermore_ (New York: St.  Martin's, 1981).

Norton, Andre, _Merlin's Mirror_ (Daw Books, 1975.)  Merlin is a half-
breed: human and space alien, and the war between light and darkness
is recast into a war between two space going races.  The premise is
bizarre, but Norton makes it work well.

Philip, Neil. _The tale of Sir Gawain_ (illustrated by Charles
Keeping. New York : Philomel Books, 1987).

Powers, Tim, _The Drawing of the Dark_.  Ambrosius and the Fisher-King.

Price, Robert, _The Last Pendragon_ (Walker and Co. NY 1991) Telling
of Bedwyr, last of the Knights after the Fall, and Irion, son of
Mordred, and the Saxon threat to what's left of old Britain.  Arthur
himself appears only in the prolog.  "Tactics" oriented.

Pyle, Howard, _The story of King Arthur and his knights_ (New York :
C. Scribner's Sons, 1904, c1903).

Seare, Nicholas, _Rude Tales and Glorious_ (Clarkson N. Potter, Inc.,
New York.  Hardback).  Classic rendition.  Title says it all.  This is
a retelling of the Arthurian tales.  Merlin is a two bit con
artist/pimp, Gwen is a whore that enjoys giving out free samples,
Arthur is Merlin's assistant.  It is a riot.

Service, Pamela F., _Winter of Magic's Return_, _Tomorrow's Magic_
(Atheneum, New York, 1987). Five hundred years after the Devastation
destroys modern civilization, the young Merlin and two friends
succeed in bringing back King Arthur to Britain in the grip of a
nuclear winter and together they struggle to build a new and better
society despite the evil plotting of Morgan Le Fay.  Juvenile fiction.

Stone, Eugenia, _Page boy for King Arthur_, (illustrated by Rafaello
Busoni.  Chicago : Follett Publishing Co., c1949).

Stone, Eugenia, _Squire for King Arthur_, (illustrated by Rafaello
Busoni. Chicago : Follett Pub. Co., 1955).

Stafford, Greg, and others.  _King Arthur Pendragon_.  (Chaosium Inc.,
950-A 56th Street, Oakland, CA 94608. ISBN: 0-933635-59-1.)  Other
books in the same series: _The Boy King_, by Greg Stafford, ISBN
0-933635-78-8; _The King Arthur Companion_, by Phyllis Ann Karr, ISBN
0-993635-17-6; _Knights Adventurous_, by Greg Stafford, ISBN
0-933635-70-2.  This is part of an excellent role playing game, but
the books are worth reading by themselves as well.  There are several
books the game is made of, purchaseable separately.  Most of it is a
very detailed glossary of people in the various versions of the saga
(with primacy to Mallory's), but almost half of it is spent on similar
glossaries of notable places, of special "things", and many other
fascinating tidbits, such as an attempt at a self-consistent
chronology of Arthur's reign, and so on.

Steinbeck, John, _The Acts of King Arthur and his Noble Knights_
(Del Rey.  Paperback.)  Rendition of Le Morte D'Arthur into modern
day English.  Not complete.

Stewart, Mary, _The Crystal Cave_, _The Hollow Hills_, _The Last
Enchantment_, and _The Wicked Day_ (Fawcett Crest.)  A modern 
retelling of the legend.  The first three are narrated by Merlin,
and the last in third person.

Stone, Brian, translater.  _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_.
(Penguin Books, many reprints.  c1959.  ISBN 0-14-044092-5.)
Beautiful translation.

Sutcliff, Rosemary, _Sword at Sunset_ (Coward-McCann, Inc, New York,
1963.  Hardcover and paperback available.)  A telling of Arthur as he
might actually have been, a local Celtic warlord.

Sutcliff, Rosemary, _The Light Beyond the Forest_ (1979) and _The
Sword in the Circle_ (1981) (London: Bodley Head.)  You can see from
the dates that these are somewhat later than her adult novel _Sword at
Sunset_.  They are technically "young adult" titles.

Sutcliff, Rosemary, _The road to Camlann_ (1st ed.  New York :
Dutton, 1982). The evil Mordred, plotting against his father King
Arthur, implicates the Queen and Sir Lancelot in treachery and brings
about the downfall of Camelot and the Round Table.  "Young adult."

Talbott, Hudson, _King Arthur : The Sword in the Stone_ (New York :
Books of Wonder, 1991).

Tolstoy, Nikolai, _The Coming of the King: A Novel of Merlin_ (Bantam
Books, 1989.  Trade paperback.)  Very closely based on the Welsh
mabinogion -- poetry rendered into prose.  Makes no attempt at
"realism": the grotesquely fantastic has its day here.  Lyrical
writing, worth reading.  Long.

Treece, Henry, _The Great Captains_ (New York: Random House, 1956.)
This is another sort of Celtic late Roman novel with characters such
as Artos the Bear/Artorius, dux bellorum, Bedwyr, Cie, Medrawt, and 
Drostan.  An excellent story, but not one for the squeamish.  

Troughton, Joanna, _Sir Gawain and the loathly damsel_ (retold and
illustrated by Joanna Troughton.  1st ed.  New York : Dutton, 1972).
Adapted from an anonymous fifteenth-century poem, The Weddynge of Sir
Gawen and Dame Ragnell: in order to obtain the answer to a riddle
that will save King Arthur's life, Sir Gawain must marry the ugliest
maiden in the world.  Juvenile.

Turton, Godfrey, _The Emperor Arthur_, (Garden City, N.Y., Doubleday,
1967).  This is another late Roman historical reconstruction.  Highly
recommended.

Twain, Mark, _A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court_ (many
editions).

White, Terence Hanbury, _The Once and Future King_ and _The Book of Merlin_
(Berkley Books, ISBNs: 0-425-06310-0 & 0-425-07282-7, respectively.
Original copyrights in 1939 and 1940). A retelling of the legend from
the earliest stories.  More comedic than some of the other versions.
Be warned, _The Book of Merlin_ rehashes many themes and stories from
TOFK.  It's good, but if you experience deja-vu while reading it,
well, that's why.  _The Witch in the Wood_ [???]

Wolf, Joan, _The Road to Avalon_ (Onyx Novels, a subdivision of
Penguin Books.)  A romantic retelling, casting familiar characters
into startlingly different relationships.

Woolley, Persia, _Child of the Northern Spring_, _Queen of the Summer
Stars_, _Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn_ (Poseidon Press, New York,
London, Toronto, etc.)  The story of the life of Guinivere, from her
point of view.

Yolen, Jane, _The Dragon's Boy_ (Harper and Row, New York, 1990).
Children's fiction. Young Arthur meets a dragon and comes to accept
him as a friend and mentor.

Yolen, Jane, _Merlin's Booke: Thirteen Stories and Poems about the
Arch-Mage_ (Berkley Publishing Group, Ace Fantasy, New York, 1986).


2.  Poetry

_Lancelot of the Laik_.  A Scottish metrical romance, about 1490-1500
A.D.  Re-edited from a manuscript in the Cambridge University Library,
with an introd., notes, and glossarial index, by W. W. Skeat.  London,
New York, Published for the Early English Text Society by the Oxford
University Press [1965].

Carley, James P., introduction.  _Mathew Arnold and William Morris_
(_Arthurian Poets_ series, Woodbridge, Suffolk, and Rochester, NY:
Boydell Press 1990, ISBN: 0-85115-544-8).  Arnold's "Tristram and
Iseult" is the first modern English retelling of the Tristram legend,
a melancholy interpretation of the theme; Morris' different approach
apparent in the rich sensuality of his "The Defence of Guenevere."

Carley, James P., ed., introduction.  _A.C. Swinburne_ (_Arthurian
Poets_ series, ISBN: 0-85115-546-4).  Some of Swinburne's most
important poetry recreates the Arthurian legends from a modern
perspective.  Includes _Tristram of Lyonesse_.

Carley, James P., ed., introduction.  _E.A. Robinson_ (_Arthurian
Poets_ series, ISBN: 0-85115-545-6).  Robinson's Arthurian poems,
published between 1917 and 1927 won him a Pulitzer Prize.

Dodds, David, ed., introduction.  _Charles William_ (_Arthurian Poets_
series, ISBN: 0-88115-291-0).  Contains _Taliessin through Logres_ and
_The Region of the Summer Stars_, as well as twenty-four of William's
earlier poems on Arthurian themes from his collection _The Advent of
Galahad_ (many never published before), and fragments designed to form
a sequel to _Region_ which also appear for the first time.

Hole, Richard, _Arthur; or, The northern enchantment_ (GGJ and J
Robinson, London, 1798).  A poetical romance, in seven books.

Lupack, Alan, ed., _Arthur, the Greatest King: an Anthology of Modern
Arthurian Poems_ (forword by Raymond H. Thompson, Garland, New York,
1988).

Lytton, Baron Edward Bulwer, _King Arthur_ (London, Henry Colburn, 1849).

York, Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907).

Robinson, Edwin Arlington, "Merlin"(1917), "Lancelot"(1920) and
"Tristram"(1927). Verse retelling of the Arthur legend.  The last one
won the 1928 Pulitzer Prize for poetry.  

Tennyson, Lord Alfred,  _Idylls of the King_ (Signet, 1961.) 

About the _Arthurian Poets_ series: A volume on John Masefield is in
preparation. All the volumes contain the complete Arthurian poetry of
each author; for example, the Charles Williams volume has much
previously unpublished poetry.


3.  Non-Fiction and research

"Bulletin of Bibliography" (July-Sept. 1981, 38(3):128-138,149).
Contains an Arthurian bibliography.

Modern language association of America, _A bibliography of critical
Arthurian literature_ (New York City).

Modern Language Association of America. Arthurian Group. _A
bibliography of Arthurian critical literature_ (v.1-2;
1922/29-1930/35, New York).

Books, Alexandria, VA [USA], 1986).

Documentary evidence of King Arthur's historical existence.
Alcock has also published much work concerning archaelogical
excavations of Glastonbury (speculated site of Camelot).

Andronik, Catherine M., _Quest for a King: Searching for the Real
King Arthur_ (Atheneum, New York, 1989).  Surveys the legends
surrounding King Arthur and examines the historical evidence behind
them.

Ashe, Geoffrey, _King Arthur's Avalon: The Story of Glastonbury_
(Dutton, New York, 1958, reprinted).  Glastonbury is the legendary
Avalon, site of Arthur's grave and source of much fanciful speculation
and scholarly interest.  The author reveals Glastonbury's distinctive
character in the dark ages as the meeting place of Saxon and Celt; the
glory of its Abbey as the center of English and medieval civilization;
and the significance of its legends in the mystical theory of the Holy
Grail -- a primary factor in the development of European religious
thought.

Williams, Charles and C.S. Lewis, _Arthurian Torso_.  Two long
essays.  The first, by Williams, is a lengthy history of the
development of the Arthurian legend, discussing the entry of the
various great themes (i.e., courtly love, the Grail, etc.) and how it
affected the legend that had existed to that point.  The second, by
Lewis, is an indispensible guide to Williams' own Arthurian poems
(cited in the Poetry section).  These essays, along with William's
poems, can be found in trade paperback from Eerdmans' Press, Grand
Rapids.

4.  Medieval and Early Texts

_Gawain and the Grene Knight_.  Many translations, including one by
JRR Tolkien (_Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_, Clarendon Press,
Oxford, 1930).

_Lancelot of the Lake_.  Available in pb from Oxford's "The World's
Classics" series.  Anonymous, Arthurian cycle: _Lancelot of the Lake_,
_The Quest of the Holy Grail_, and _The Death of Arthur_.  Available
in pb from Penguin.  Most later Arthurian texts (especially Mallory)
are based on these, the same way most texts after Chretien derived
from Chretien.  The first listed, the "short" or "non-cyclic prose
Lancelot," is a very interesting point in the development of the
legend: Lancelot is not yet involved in the Grail quest (indeed, it is
implied that it has already occurred by the time he comes to King
Arthur's court).  The "cycle" is the first (existing) text, or set of
texts, to unite all the fundamental themes of the mythos.  Also
available from Penguin is a single volume edition with two long poetic
"morts d'Artu," under the title _The Death Of King Arthur_.  One is in
rhymed verse, the other in alliterative.

_The Mabinogion_ (many translations.) The Mabinogion is the collection
of Welsh stories and legends, where elements of the Arthurian legend
can be found.  These probably form the basis for the legend as we have
it today, though scholars seem to revise their opinions every now and
then.

Blackmore, Sir Richard, _An Heroick Poem (London, printed for Awnsham
and John Churchil, 1695).  In ten books.  Probably out of print.

Chretien de Troyes, _Arthurian Romances_ (Everyman's Library #698).
Various translations.  He was a 12th century writer/poet and the
single most improtant influence on the development of the Arthurian
mythos: it was he who linked Lancelot to Guinevere and who introduced
the moral question of their affair (in _Lancelot, Or the Knight of the
Cart_) and it was quite possibly he who brought the story of the Grail
Quest to Arthur's court (in _Perceval_).

Chretien de Troyes, _Ywain, the Knight of the Lion_ (Translated by
Robert W. Ackermand and Frederick W. Lock, Unger, New York, 1957, plus
other translations).

Chretien de Troyes, _Perceval, The Story of the Grail_.  (English
translation by Nigel Bryant, ISBN: 0-85991-224-8).  The story of the
making of a knight in both worldly and spiritual terms, and the source
of some of the most dramatic and mysterious adventures of romance.

Geoffrey of Monmouth, _History of the Kings of Britain_ (Penguin, 1966.
ISBN 0-14-044170-0.)  Fourteenth century historian.

Malory, Sir Thomas, _Le Morte D'Arthur_ (many editions).  The classic
15th century rendition of Arthurian legend according the French
tradition.  About where Lancelot in his romantic, very French, form
was added, and where the search for the Grail was put in Christian
terms.

Matarosso, translator, _The Quest of the Holy Grail_ (Penguin, 1969.
ISBN 0-14-044220-0.)

Middleton, Christopher, _The famous historie of Chinon of England_
(to which is added The assertion of King Arthure, translated by
Richard Robinson from Leland's Assertio inclytissimi Arturii,
together with... London, Pub. for the Early English Text Society by
H. Milford, Oxford University Press, 1925).

von Strassburg, Gottfried, _Tristan_ (Penguin, 1960. ISBN
0-14-044098-4.)

Wace and Layamon, _Arthurian Chronicles_, (with an introd. by Lucy
Allen Paton.  London ; New York : Dent, Dutton, [1921?]).

Wolfram von Eschenbach, _Parsival_ (Penguin, 1980.  ISBN
0-14-044361-4.)  Allows great insight into the mind of Chivalry for
those with the patience.  Modern translation of a medieval text.

5.  Magazines and Articles

Lambides, Freya Reeves, pub., _Avalon to Camelot_ (Debra N. Mancoff,
ed.)  A quarterly journal started in Fall 1983, lasted for four regular
issues to Summer 1984 before the publisher folded.  Two more issues
came out, but are not generally available.  It had some excellent
articles, and was well illustrated for a non-color production.
Surviving copies may be collector's items.

6.  Arthurian references

Coney, Michael Greatrex, _Fang, the Gnome_. (Signet/New American
Library, ISBN 0-451-15847-4).  The main characters are Fang, Nyneve,
Avalona (the non-human who teaches Nyneve) and Merlin (Avalona's son).
Arthurian characters who appear: Tristam and Iseult, Arthur, and
Galahad - with the other characters appearing only in "the Game"
played by Nyneve, Avalona and Merlin.  The Game is used to enter an
alternate reality and influence the characters there. Eventually the
other reality merges with that of Earth and the Arthurian story
becomes a reality.

Baigent, Michael, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln.  _Holy Blood, Holy
Grail_. (Corgi, 1993, ISBN 0-552-12138-X, many reprints.)  What it did
was propose a revolutionary theory about what the "San Greal" was (a
deliberate distortion for "Sang Real", the bloodline of Jesus - not
just through lots of hints, such as the obvious reference through
"Fisher King" with the Greek connection of the fish for Jesus, as well
as the "I shall make you fishers of men" phrase in the Gospel, etc -
but also through meticulously detailed research).  Not directly about
Arthur, but Arthur's connections with the Holy Grail myths are too
strong to ignore.

Bradley, Michael.  _Holy Grail Across the Atlantic_.  1988.  Bradley
carries on where Baigent, et al, leave off.  As well as utilizing
their book, he directly cites further details about an apparent
conspiracy to introduce 'clue-books' in famous libraries in France and
around Europe, over many decades. Bradley traces the Holy Grail from
'Before the Flood' - to Arthur - and from there across the Atlantic, -
to Nova Scotia - (before Columbus), its possible residence in Montreal
for many years, and then supposed return to Europe.

Cooper, Susan, _Over Sea, Under Stone_, _The Dark Is Rising_, _The
Green Witch_, _The Grey King_, _Silver on the Tree_.  Celtic derived
fantasy, some references to Arthur.  While these are "children's
books," they present good reading for adults as well.

|Drake, David, _The Dragon Lord_, (Berkeley Pub. Group, 1979.  ISBN
|0-399-12380-6).

Kay, Guy Gavriel, _The Summer Tree_, _The Wandering Fire_ and _The
Darkest Road_.  Also known collectively as "The Fionavar Tapestry."
Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere are, in various forms, called back to
assist in defeating The Unraveller in the one True World, Fionavar.
In addition, the tale is steeped in Celtic mythology and part of the
fun is matching characters back to specific myths and legends.

Knowles, Sir James, _The Legends of King Arthur and his Knights_,
(London, New York: Warne and Co., 1895).

Lewis, C.S., _That Hideous Strength_ (part of a three book set).
While it does have much non-Arthurian material, it does deal a good
bit with the line of the Pendragons and one of the characters is the
awakened Merlinus Ambrosius.

Matthews, Caitlin and John, _The Arthurian Book of Days_ (New York :
Macmillan, c1990).  Contains Arthurian events related to a particular
point in the year.  Illustrated with copies of rare paintings and
illuminations.

Spenser, Edmund, _The Faerie Queene_.  An excellent work and is
Arthurian at least in some of its sections, and should be
comprehensible to anyone who can read Malory.

Walton, Evangeline, _Prince of Annwn_, _The Children of Llyr_, _The
Song of Rhiannon_ and _The Island of the Mighty_ (Del Rey, 1970).
Modern reworkings of _The Mabinogion_.  Excellently written.  May be
hard to find.  Recently reissued in large tradeback, but is out of print.


7.  Celtic Fiction

_Irish Fairy and Folk Tales_ (Dorset, 1986.  ISBN 0-88029-073-0.)

Alexander, Lloyd, _The Book of Three_, The Black Cauldron_, _Castle of
Llyr_, _Taran Wanderer_, _The High King_.  Based on Celtic mythology,
these are excellent "children's" books.

Bedier, Joseph, _Romance of Tristan & Iseult_ (Doubleday Anchor, 1945.)

Flynn, Casey, _The Gods of Ireland_ (Bantam/Spectra).  This is a
series of books which retell the mythic cycle of Irish legends.  The
individual books are short and do stand alone, at least the first two
do.

Gantz, Jeffrey, _Early Irish Myths and Sagas_  (Penguin, 1981.  ISBN
0-14-044-397-5.)

Humphreys, Emyr, _The Taliesin Tradition_, (Black Raven, 1983.  ISBN
0-85159-002-0.)  Boring.

0-14-044247-2.)

Jacobs, Joseph, _Celtic Fairy Tales_  (Dover, 1968.  ISBN 0-486-21826-0.)

Llywelyn, Morgan, _Red Branch_ (Ivy Books, Ballantine Books, 1989.
ISBN: 0-8041-0591-X.  Retells the story of the Irish warrior-hero:
Cuchulain, the Hound of Ulster.  Has also written _Grania_, _The Horse
Goddess_, and _Lion of Ireland_.

Paxson, Diana L., _The White Raven_ (Avon Books, 1988).  Retelling
of the Tristan/Iseult legend, from the point of view of Iseult's
slave/maid.  A pretty, romantic sort of tale.

Peacock, Thomas Love. _The Misfortunes of Elphin_ (c1829; many
reprints).  An irreverent take on the Mabinogion.

Rolleston, T.W., _Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race_  (Constable, 1911.
recent reprint, no date.  ISBN 0-09-467720-4)

Weston, Jesse L. _From Ritual to Romance_  (Anchor, 1957.)  A work on
the grail.

Yeats, Wm. Butler, _The Celtic Twilight_  (Signet, 1962.)

Yeats, Wm. Butler and Lady Gregory, _A Treasury of Irish Myth, Legend,
and Folklore_ (Avenel Books, 1986. ISBN: 0-517-48904-X.  Irish tales,
