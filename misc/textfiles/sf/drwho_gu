            This guide contains information in the following form: 

Story Production Code  (SPC):  Each story had a unique  code associated with it
  that was used for filing purposes.
Title:  Stories `A' through `Z' had  individual titles for each episode, but in
  the interest of organization and for saving  space, only the collective title
  is given.  After each title,  the number of episodes is given in parentheses,
  and if a Target Books novelisation exists, that fact is noted by the presence
  of an asterisk  or a caret if  the book's title  is radically  different from
  from that of the episode.  (The book's title is given in the notes section.)
Writer: This column lists the author(s) of each episode.
Archives: This column lists all episodes  that are held by the B.B.C. archives,
  in black &  white and  colour.  The  symbol "a-<n>"  means that  all episodes
  except those listed exist in the B.B.C. archives.
Notes: This column records any changes in the Doctor's companions, and mentions
  any other interesting information.
In addition, the  season headings  show the beginning  and ending  dates of the
  original broadcast  of the season, and  the Producer(s) and  Script Editor(s)
  for that season.
