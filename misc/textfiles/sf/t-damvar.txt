These are the variants that I use in my TORG campaign. Most of them were made
when I was trying to use some Phoenix Command rules in Torg. I know that TORG
is supposed to be totally generic, but even fights between Core Earth
characters using CE weapons were pretty unrealistic.
	Mostly, the shock and wound rules are there because I wanted to take
full advantage of TORG's logarithmic scale, so we could have titanic battles
or fights with Godzilla. This way, if you have a large number of 'soldiers'
you can either roll separately or lump them logarithmically into one damage
value. 
	The crippling rule is there like it is because, 1)like I said, I wanted
more realism, 2) I didn't want to have to roll for hit location, and 3) the 
players were really bugging me by removing more than one wound. It just seemed 
so unrealistic to not be wounded and yet be knocked out by a bullet.
	The bleeding rule was the toughest. As I was trying to convert Phoenix
Command, I saw a fundamental difference between TORG damage and Phoenix Command
damage. When you write down that you have taken two Wounds, you are guaranteed
right there and then that you will live as long as you don't take any more
damage. When you take damage in Phoenix Command, even a single point, you won't
know whether you will live or die for up to 25 days. I *have* had a character
die from a single point of damage.
	If you're interested, here are the 'sort of' conversion numbers that 
these rules are based on:
1 point of TORG shock is 2.5 points of PC damage, Wounded is 100 DT, Heavy
Wound is 201-300 DT, Mortal Wound is 1001-2000 DT, 4Wnd is 5001-6000, and 5wnd
is 16,000. To my joy, I discovered that DT and RR for a TL 13 Trauma center
are fairly linear for up to 1000 points of damage.
	The disconnection rules are mostly untested, and there isn't any 
'reality check' for them. If you use them, please let me know what you think.
	Most of the rules sound like legalese because I was trying to plug
all the loopholes I could think of. I was going to put some summary tables at 
the end, but you are probably bored out of your mind by now and will never make
it past the rules, so I'll put the tables here.

2) New wound accumulation rules, above.
3) Split TOU 
4) Stormers who spend a possibility to remove more than one wound suffer a
crippled limb.
5) Healing-TOU+9 for 1Wnd, TOU+6 for higher levels. Reduce Healing miracle by
1 level, and First Aid and Healing take 1 minute.
6) Bleeding-see table above

TORG Rules Variants
by Grant Davis

Refer to p.18 of TORG rulebook.

1)Wound and KO damage are the same, but all targets take the Effect value of 
the damage result points in shock. Characters fall unconscious after taking 
their TOU value in shock.
	Possibility-rated characters divide shock by 10 instead of subtracting
3 when they spend a possibility, and when a character takes shock for any other
reason (like fatigue), multiply the listed shock by 5.

1b) Ords who are unconscious or out of combat heal 5 shock per turn, and must
heal all shock before waking up. Possibility-rated characters may (instead) 
make a roll; the 'Attribute' is the Effect Value of time (in seconds, rounded
down) since the last roll, or since falling unconscious if this is the first
roll. The Difficulty Number is the Effect value of shock taken, or 7 for an
O result, whichever is higher. Success means the character wakes up with all
shock and O removed. If the result total was higher than 15, a K may also be
removed.
[Note: This allows Storm Knights to spend Possibilities and cards and 'save up'
time for the dramatically appropriate moment to awaken, rather than say 
'Admiral Calavicci will regain consciousness in 8.2 minutes':-]

2) Wound levels do not add. If the old and new wounds are equal, raise the
character's wound level by 1; otherwise, use whichever level is higher. 
	Wounds less than the character's current level are ignored, but in this
case a Storm Knight has to remove at least one wound level if she spends a 
possibility. (closin' them loopholes :-(

3) I don't like 3, so I won't post it (It's another 'fix' due to rule 1.)

4) Crippling limbs- Possibility-rated characters suffer a disabling injury if
they spend a possibility to remove more than one wound level at a time. Roll
a die: 1-6 is a disabled arm, 7-20 is a disabled leg.
	If there was no wound damage after the possibility was spent, the 
disability is a 'pain injury',  and will be removed when all shock and KO
are healed. If the knight takes one or more wounds from the attack, it is an
actual broken bone, which will be healed when all wound damage is healed.

5)Healing-roll against TOU+6 for Heavy or Mortal wounds, and TOU+9 for Wounds
[no, that isn't a typo]. The Healing Miracle heals 1 wound level on a Minimal
or Average success, and 1 addl. level for each addl. level of success. Medicine
rolls contribute +2 on a Spectacular success, and +1 on any other level of 
success.
5b)   First Aid and Healing take at least 1 minute; Medicine takes at least 1 
hour. [I made this rule and the disability rule because the PCs were taking
hundreds of shock points, spending a possibiliy to remove the wounds, and then
having the other PCs remove all their shock next turn with First Aid or 
Healing]

6) Bleeding (sort of):
	Care Level 1-If a characer is wounded, she must receive a successful
First Aid roll (difficulty numbers on p. 55) from a person with a Tech axiom of
19 or greater within 1 min. (6 rounds) or make a TOU roll (DN 8 for wound, 11 
for Heavy Wound, or 15 for Mortal Wound). Failure increases the wound level by
one; success means the character has another minute to recieve First Aid, or
she must roll again, and so on until either a successful First Aid roll or a 
failed TOU roll, which advances the patient to Care Level 2.
	Inspiration counts as successful First Aid (if the PC is in real danger
of dying, the GM may continue flipping cards even after combat is over).
	Care Level 2-Roll each hour until a Medicine roll is made with minimum 
equipment of a Tech 21 hospital, a Tech 23 ambulance, or a tech 26 medkit
(Medicine DN is same as for First aid, and TOU DN is same as above, based on
*original* wound level). Again, failure increases the wound level by one, and
success keeps the patient at Care Level 2 for another hour.
	Care Level 3-After the second successful Medicine roll or failed TOU
roll, roll each day until a successful Medicine roll at a Tech 22 Hospital,
Tech 26 ambulance, or Tech 30 medkit.
	If this last level of care can be reached, no further rolls need be
made and wound levels due to bleeding can be immediately removed (blood
transfusions, etc.). If it cannot be reached, the character stops rolling
after failing a TOU roll at this point or succeeding at a natural healing
roll, but then the wounds due to bleeding must be healed naturally.
	Note that Care Level 2 can be skipped, but Care Level 1 cannot; a 
character must receive First Aid, even if she is shot in a hospital.
	A Healing miracle stops bleeding completely if all wounds (blood
loss first, then original damage) are healed immediately, otherwise the
character only advances to the next Care Level.
	A successful medicine roll at a Tech 26 hospital can 'bring back' a
patient with 4 wounds, or 5 wounds at a tech 30 hospital (if there is a 
chance of this, continue using the bleeding rules even after 4 or 5 wounds
are taken).
	If a First Aid or Medicine (or Healing miracle) roll fails, it may not
be attempted again until the next time period (the patient has to make at least
one TOU roll).
	[Note: most of these bleeding rules rarely come into play; the priest
simply heals all the party's wounds right after combat. When he started doing 
it *during combat, I made the rule that it took at least a minute.]
	[Don't let your players con you by saying that their opponent's laser
guns cauterize the wound, because these wounds aren't *exactly* due to 
bleeding. You see, my numbers only held up for the initial wounds if a person
was shot in a Tech 23 hospital, so I created these rules to show what would
happen if they didn't get the best medical care immediately.]

7) Reconnection-the first attempt to reconect may be made after (9+bonus)
Effect value in seconds have passed, the second after (18+bonus) seconds,
and subsequent rolls after (25+bonus) seconds. This averages out to one roll
after one minute, then after an hour, then each day. When generating the
bonus, roll again on 10s and 20s. No matter how short the time, the roll may
not be made until the next turn.
