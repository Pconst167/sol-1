Re: Apollo 11 encounter UFO's
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Did Apollo 11 encounter UFO's on the moon?
 
  I received secret documents on such an event.   I am taking a risk by 
making this public, but I figure it's worth it. . 
 
  According to  hitherto reports,  both Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" 
Aldrin  saw  UFO's  shortly after the historic landing on the  moon  in 
Apollo  11   on July 21/  1969.   One of the astronauts referred  to  a 
"light" in or on a crater during a televised transmission, folllowed be 
a request from mission control for further information.   Nothing  more 
was heard. 
 
  According to former NASA employee Otto Binder,  radio hams with their 
own  VHF receiving facilities that bypassed NASA's broadcasting outlets 
picked up the following exchange in the next letter.

 This is a transmission received from Apollo 11 after the lunar landing. 
 
 MISSION CONTROL:  What's there?  Mission control calling Apollo 11. 
 
 APOLLO 11      :  These babies are huge, sir...enormous....Oh, God, you 
                   wouldn't believe it!  I'm telling you there are other 
                   spacecraft  out  there...lined up on the far side  of 
                   the crater edge...they're on the moon watching us... 
 
                  -- This  is  now  a classified interview  between  an  
                     anonymous  professor and Neil Armstrong  referring 
                     to the above event. 
 
 PROFESSOR      :  What really happened out there with Apollo 11? 
 
 ARMSTRONG      :  It was incredible...of course,  we had  always  known 
                   there  was  a possibility ...the fact  is,   we  were 
                   warned  off.  There was never any question then of  a 
                   space station or moon city. 
 
 PROFESSOR      :  How do you mean "warned off"? 
 
 ARMSTRONG      :  I  can't  go into details,  except to say that  their 
                   ships  were  far superior to ours both  in  size  and 
                   technology-Boy, were they big!....and menacing....No, 
                   there is no question of a space station. 
 
 PROFESSOR      :  But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11? 
 
 ARMSTRONG      :  Naturally  -  NASA was committed at that  time,   and 
                   couldn't risk a panic on earth....But it really was a 
                   quick scoop and back again...
