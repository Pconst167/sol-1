Clouds 
by Mary Jane 
 
 
     Mulder watched as the clouds rolled into place.  There were 
dark, forboding clouds; white, fluffy clouds; smokey, grey 
clouds.  Since he was a child, Mulder loved the rain, especially 
the smell of rain.  He heaved a sigh and let the blinds fall back 
against the window.  He didn't love the rain this time.  The 
emptiness flowed through him and filled him.  It had been a month 
since the X-Files were disbanded... a very depressing month.  He 
hadn't seen Scully since they cleaned out their office and he 
missed her dreadfully. 
     He sat on the windowsill and watched the rain hit the ground 
outside.  After a restless moment he lifted the phone out of his 
lap and looked at it intently, almost as if he expected the 
number to dial itself.  Mulder hesitated for a moment and then 
dialed.  Ring... ri... 
     "Hello?" 
     He was shocked that there was an answer.  It had been so 
long since anyone picked up that line that he hadn't really 
expected anyone to this time. 
     "Hello?" 
     "S-scully?" he asked shakily. 
     "Yes.  Who...?  Mulder?" 
     "Yeah, it's me."  There was a long silence as they both 
waited for the other to say something.  Mulder finally took the 
bull by the horns and spoke.  "It's good to hear your voice."  He 
mentally kicked himself.  Good one, Mulder... keep it up and she 
might even hang up on you. 
     "It's been a while, hasn't it?" she asked rhetorically.  
"How have you been?" 
     "Busy.  Skinner hasn't let me have a minute to breathe.  
How're you holding up?" 
     "Oh you know me.  I'm always busy."  She answered far too 
quickly.  She fidgeted for a moment, knowing what was about to 
come. 
     "Bullshit.  I know you better than that.  Come on, Dana, 
spill."  Mulder knew that after they had been separated, Scully 
had been assigned to push papers for the forensics department.  
She hated to be stuck behind a desk instead of getting her hands 
dirty, so to speak. 
     "I'm fine, really." 
     "Who are you trying to kid?  I've seen your psyche profile, 
Scully.  You're not fine.  You're stuck in a job you hate.  Your 
nightmares are getting worse.  And to top it off, you haven't 
returned any of my calls.  That isn't like you.  Can we meet 
somewhere and talk?" he asked hopefully.  Mulder didn't want to 
be alone on this bleak Sunday afternoon and he knew that Scully 
probably could use some friendly company. 
     "Oh, alright.  But I'm warning you, I'm probably not very 
good company right now," she said. 
     "That's okay.  Where do you want to meet?" 
     "You pick." 
     "How about The Park?" 
     "Okay.  I'll see you in an hour."  She hung up before he 
could say anything else.  He stared at the phone for a minute and 
then clicked it off. 
 
     Scully was sitting on a bench by the water, watching the 
patterns the rain made.  She didn't see Mulder walk up and was a 
little surprised when he sat down next to her. 
     "Hi," he said quietly. 
     "Hi, yourself."  They sat in silence watching the rain.  She 
was glad she agreed to meet him.  His presence filled her with a 
feeling of security and comfort. 
     "God I've missed you," she whispered.  Her eyes filled with 
tears.  Mulder put his arm around her shoulder. 
     "I've missed you too."  Mulder pulled a thermos out of his 
briefcase and poured them each a cup of coffee.  She took a sip 
and leaned against him.  She wondered why she had ignored his 
calls for so long.  She kept all the messages he had left on her 
machine and played them back whenever she was down.  These days, 
that was more often than not. 
     "Penny for your thoughts," he said softly. 
     "I was just thinking about all the cases we worked on and 
how much I miss it.  Do you think you'll get the X-Files back?" 
     He wanted to tell her yes, but he couldn't bring himself to 
be so optimistic.  "I don't know.  But if I do, you'll be the 
first to know, partner."  He was thoughtful for a moment.  "Hey, 
Dana?" 
     "Yeah?" 
     "Do you think we could do this more often?" 
     "I'd like that."  They sat in silence on the bench just 
drawing strength from each other.  The clouds parted slightly and 
the park was bathed in a single ray of light.
