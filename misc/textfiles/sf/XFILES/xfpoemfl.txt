Christmas Thoughts
(Tune: Silver Bells)

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas.
Children laughing, people passing
Beaming smile after smile
And I think, as I do every year.

Samantha, Samantha
It's Christmas Time and I miss you
Samantha, Samantha
I know the truth is out there.

D.C. street light, even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And the ache hurts more every year.

Samantha, Samantha
It's Christmas Time and I miss you
Samantha, Samantha
I know the truth is out there.

One last cry
And vanishing into the light
The echo rings in my soul
I could do nothing
And I cannot rest
I will never rest
The truth is out there
And when I find it
I pray you will be there

Where do we go when we dream?
What worlds lie locked inside the mind?
Preacher walks the line 
between the dream and the real.
Where is that line?
Do I dare to cross it?
And if I did --
Would Dana and Samantha be there?

Blood cries for blood
Life fears death
When fear goes beyond reason
Madness takes over
I have tasted the blood of a believer
And the flames burn
Black - edged desire into my soul
Oh Kristen --
What have we done?

Blood cries for blood
Love conquers darkness
And fear fades into a mid-day shadow
You chose no longer fearing
You tasted the blood of a believer
And the flames burn
Blood - red into a black smoke sky
Oh Kristen --
What have I done?

She says I can touch you,
But I can't see how.
Isn't that a laugh?
I was always the believer -
and now I'm lost in doubt.

What should I say?
What dare I say?
The words won't come
and the shadows are closing in.
Fight or flight
If I kill --
Who am I serving?

She says you need me,
But I can't see how.
It hurts too much,
I was always the believer,
But now I'm lost in doubt.

And then you opened your eyes.
