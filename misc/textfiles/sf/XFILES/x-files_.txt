Cast of Characters (alphabetically by actor's name)
===================================================

Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)
        Dr. Dana Scully plays the skeptic, insisting that everything has a
logical scientific explanation, although her exposure to the X-Files
certainly has given her cause to question her own beliefs.  She was assigned
to work with Agent Mulder to keep an eye on him and determine if his
activities are worth the time he spends working on them.  She was recruited
out of medical school and saw the FBI as a place to distinguish herself.

Agent Fox "Spooky" Mulder (David Duchovny)
        Agent Fox Mulder is one of the FBI's greatest detectives with his
photographic memory and his background as a psychologist which has helped
him to profile many serial killers.  His interest in the paranormal made him
dig into the X-Files and also gave some higher officials in the bureau cause
to believe him eccentric, reinforcing the nickname "Spooky" which he
received in the academy.  His fascination with extraterrestial life began in
his childhood when his sister disappeared - Fox claims she was abducted by
aliens.


Other Important Players
=======================

Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi)
        One of the heads of the FBI who seems to be under orders to
eliminate the X-Files division and is searching for a way to hinder
Mulder's efforts at every turn.

"Smoking Man" (William B. Davis)
        A quiet man of whom little is known, but he does seem to hold a
position of power even though much of his job entails storing top secret
items in the Pentagon.
(Note:  The name "Smoking Man" was taken from the credits following
        "Tooms.")

"Deep Throat" (Jerry Hardin)
        This mysterious and influential man first appeared to warn Mulder
about Ellens Air Force Base.  He has provided Mulder with a lot of
classified information, and in doing so, places his own life in danger.  His
reasons for helping Mulder are his own, but he claims that it is a form of
penitence.
(Note:  The name "Deep Throat" was given to him by the writers and was first
        spoken aloud in "The Erlenmeyer Flask.")

     fellow UFO enthusiast whose appearance seems rather coincidental.  And

        Mulder and Scully check out the curious murder of a man in
     Connecticut.  When they discover that another man in California was
     killed simultaneously in the same manner, the uncanny resemblance of
     the two men's daughters seems more than coincidental.  So, when the
     first child disappears, the two decide to keep an eye on the remaining
     child.  What they find isn't alien, but rather something much more
     familiar.

        A series of sexually related killings confound the two agents who

        During a trap set for a bank robber, a fellow agent and friend of

        The shooting of a Native American draws Mulder's attention as the
     murderer believed he had shot an animal of some sort.  But an Indian
     myth and some strange evidence seem to indicate the possibility of
     lycanthropy, the very phenomenon which opened the very first X-File.

        Mulder pulls some strings to be assigned to a case involving the
     disappearance of 30 loggers in Washington state.  They discover that
     the loggers, in illegally cutting down a tree, faced a punishment far
     worse than what the judicial system would have done.  Now the two
     agents must try to avoid the same dark fate.

     w: Glen Morgan & James Wong        d: David Nutter
        Eugene Tooms, a mutant killer brought in by Mulder and Scully, is
     released based on psychiatric re-evaluation and lack of evidence.
     So, Mulder sets out to prevent Tooms from killing for the fifth and
     final liver he needs, while Scully attempts to locate more definitive
     evidence.  Both tasks made more difficult by their superiors
     insistence that they work by the book.

     w: Howard Gordon & Alex Gansa      d: Jerrold Freedman
        A little girl is tied to the deaths of two Buffalo policemen, but
     the possibility that she is the murderer is ludicrous.  So Mulder and
     Scully begin an investigation of the eight year old, turning up
     evidence that may help to solve a nine year old murder case.  The
     case which Mulder believes was the death of the girl's past life.

        A mentally handicapped janitor seems to be the only suspect in
     the murders of two members of a propulsion research team.  Yet the
     evidence of advanced theoretical work seems to eliminate the
     possibility, until Mulder and Scully uncover his relationship to a
     scientist whose brain has been cryogenically preserved.

     w: Chris Carter                    d: R.W. Goodwin
        When Deep Throat points out a news story about a fugitive who
     apparently drowned, Mulder and Scully cannot see what makes it
     special.  But with his insistence, they discover evidence of secret
     government experimentation with extraterrestrial DNA.  However, the
     evidence and everyone who has seen it is quickly being eliminated.

     w: Glen Morgan & James Wong        d: David Nutter
        Long after the shutdown of the X-Files division, Mulder finds his
     own belief in the truth waning.  So when an old friend gives him a
     new reason to believe, he goes alone to an abandoned SETI program site
     in Puerto Rico.  Concerned, Scully tries to contact him before someone
     or something else does.

     w: Chris Carter                    d: Daniel Sackheim
        A man's decomposed body is found in the sewers of Newark, NJ and
     Mulder is given this supposedly routine murder case.  But after
     Scully's autopsy turns up a parasite living inside the body and a sewer
     worker is attacked and bitten by something, it opens up a whole new
     can of worms.

     w: Glen Morgan & James Wong        d: David Nutter
     original story: Darin Morgan
        A recent rash of killings in the small town of Franklin, PA brings
     Mulder to profile the murderers.  A task made more difficult by the
     fact that none of them had any previous history of violence and all
     died at the end of their berserker rages.  The only clues he has is
     some destroyed electronics and an unknown organic substance.
