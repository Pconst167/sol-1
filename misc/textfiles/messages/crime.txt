What is Copyright?
------------------------

>From a May 16, 1994 magazine column (Network Curmudgeon) in INFOWORLD page 45 
by David Strom titled; "Who owns your E-mail messages? 
'Netetiquette' for business"

I do not agree with the article that e-mail copyrights are an open issue.

As I understand it, the copyright law gives the original author of a written 
piece exclusive copyright to that written piece.  The copyright law does not 
specify the written piece be on paper, stone, nor electronic form, just that 
the written piece is tangible.

Defining tangible may be another problem.  I looked up the word in two different 
dictionaries and got basically the same result as one of the definitions;

"Discernible by the touch; capable of being touched; palpable."

"Capable of being understood or realized"

"Capable of being valued monetarily"

As I understand these theories, touching characters on a piece of paper isn't 
going to be much different than touching characters on a computer monitor 
display - both can feel very smooth.

I am sure the intention of the law is very clear on this, and I am as sure that 
if I write an e-mail to somebody, I am the sole owner of that information unless 
I specify otherwise.

I also am very sure the intention of the law is to protect innocent people not 
criminals.




However, after declaring copyrights to e-mail, I will now attempt to explain my 
concerns about when a persons copyright is violated and when a person would 
lose their copyrights.

I feel, as I am sure how many honest people feel, that the minute somebody 
begins planning and plotting any criminal activities to act upon, or to be 
acted upon, those people give up their civil rights, and any copyrights to 
materials used in their crime development.


What I am alluding to is a real world example I incurred.  I run a small 
computer bulletin board system (BBS) in San Francisco called "the Home 
MultiMedia Hobbyist" (415/771-1788) and it is aimed at MIDI Music, MultiMedia, 
and Virtual Reality.  The purpose of the BBS is to give people with similar 
interests in these areas a simple and affordable common ground for discussions, 
information, and provide a library of programs and data files for the related 
subjects.

Typically, when I am walking near the PC running the BBS and see activity 
lights on the modem and hard disc drive, I will turn on the monitor to peer 
in to see who's on line and see where their interests are focused at.  
Recently when I did this I noticed a user reading his e-mail discussing 
selling stolen credit cards.

I immediately contacted the local police and informed them of what I was 
viewing on the screen, and that they should investigate this and stop this 
criminal action.  About three or more hours later, two officers came by my 
apartment and I showed them the e-mail I had seen between these two users.  
The police requested a print-out of the e-mail for evidence.  I gave them a 
print-out of the e-mails, and also the user information I had on the two 
users engaged in the illegal activity.

I explained to the police the user information I had may not be legitimate, 
and that I was reasonably sure the user information would be fake as is 
typical of so many users on BBS's.  Generally, on a BBS like mine, users 
don't give their real names, but use alias'.  I didn't expect that anybody 
who is involved in criminal activities would ever give their real name, 
address, and phone number for verification or registration either.

After a few day's I was again walking past the BBS system when I again turned 
on the monitor to see who and what was happening again out of my basic 
curiosity.  I again saw one of the previous users having discussions via 
e-mail with another user concerning payments for stolen credit cards, pagers, 
and even about robbing somebody's house.  I again called the police, after 
about thirty minutes a single officer came by, I showed him what I had, told 
the officer about the previous police visit.

This officer made a report, called the report in, got a case number assigned, 
and told me the case would be assigned to the fraud unit.  He also told me to 
contact the fraud unit and keep them continually informed so that they might 
follow-up on this case.

After a few day's of collecting       's as the users kept posting back 'n forth.  I called the local police fraud unit to give them further information and see what can be done.

The officer who answered the phone had me speak to another inspector.  The 
following is the actual data transmissions of this case no. 940592272 from 
me to the officers who were investigating.

As you will see, justice plays a blind hand using civil rights as an excuse...




Dear Mr. Secret Service Agent,

I was asked to send this FAX by the Duty Agent today.

I need help to either get a telephone tap on my computer BBS line, or 
Caller ID so I can help catch two or more criminals who seem to be two 
kids using my BBS as a E-mail drop for criminal activity negotiations and 
conspiracy.

The following pages are intercepted E-mail's from a computer bulletin board 
system (BBS) that I run here in San Francisco.

I first noticed the activity last Thursday April. 28, 1994 about 6pm.  
Typically, when I see activity on my BBS I will turn on the monitor to see 
who and what is going on the BBS.  Last Thursday night I had noticed 
somebody reading their E-mail referring to stolen credit cards.  

I promptly called the local San Francisco police and explained to the 
dispatcher what was happening.  The dispatcher said she would send somebody 
out to take a look.  About four hours later two officers I showed them what I had 
seen in the E-mail and they asked for a print-out as evidence.

I gave them the print-out including the personal data I had for each of the 
two perpetrators that was left on my BBS.  I don't know if the personal data 
is accurate or not, but a phone trace could prove either way, and be easy to 
pin-down the two kids anyway.

Next I again saw similar E-mails between these two on May 4, 1994 early in 
the morning when I was getting ready for work about 6am.  I called the police 
again and a single officer  came by, I gave him a print-out 
of the current E-mail, he called in and gave me a case no. 940592272 and told 
me to contact the fraud department at 553-1521.

Next I saw the continuation of E-mails last night May 5, 1994 about 6:30pm.  
As I watched the user (The Macdaddy #625) writing his E-mail, I noticed he 
was even talking about a plot to burglarize somebody's (named Peter) home.  
I immediately called the police again to report this new current action.  
I was asked to call back in the morning, and was unable to get any interest 
to try and catch the culprit on line.

By this time I am capturing all the E-mails I can from these two users.  I 
made some print-outs to keep for pick-up by the police and my own records 
to try and track what's going on.  

Then I called the F.B.I. today, asked what they could do.  I was told to 
contact the Secret Service because stolen credit cards is an issue the 
Secret Service can handle.  After talking to the local San Francisco Police 
(Inspector SF Police of fraud division) I was informed that it is difficult 
for local police to get telephone line taps and traps.  I was also informed 
that it was easier for federal agencies can get telephone taps and traps 
much more easily.

That is why I am writing this letter now.  So that perhaps the Secret Service 
can work with the local police, and perhaps even the F.B.I. to catch these 
two kids, perhaps others they refer to in their E-mails and stop some crime.

I want a telephone tap/trap on my BBS telephone line (415/771-1788) and 
perhaps even get me caller-ID so I can better protect my BBS from other 
jerks who try to screw-up the system.


The following is the actual E-mail's sent on my BBS;

card and ran.  Did you keep the card?  well give me back the card.  I am gonna 
give it back to my friend and tell him that the card sucked, well, I will TRY 
to get you another card, no garuntees, in the meantime try to get me my money,

RE: sure

Alright...here's the problem.  Getting cash is a problem.  Getting the
merchandise is not.  What I can do for you is get you the merchandise and then
you can sell it or keep it or do whatever you want.  If you sell it, it will
be better for you cuz then you might be able to sell it at a higher price than
what I can.  That's the only thing.  The only way for me to get cash is to
sell the merchandise and that's pretty hard when you try to sell something hot
and most people don't carry arounda  lot of money, unless it's car stuff.
Well, tell me what kind of merchandise you want.  If you don't want clothes,
then that's cool.  Just tell me what you want, and I will see if any of my
friends work at a store that sells it.  I don't have your money, because my
friends havne't sold it yet.  I asked my friends when they are gonna do
peter's house, and they said soon.  They will eventually do it, and you will
get your share.  It will be worth the wait.  Cuz they want to clean it totally
out.

Oh yeah...just because the pager is supercomm, doesn't mean that it's pagenet.
 They also have pactel, metromedia comm, pagemart, and a whole mess of others.
 And if they pagers's locked by the store(that happened once), then I have to
pay the guy $20 to get it unlocked.  All this stuff complicates it, but the
absolute best and very least it will cost, will be $7/mo. or $21 for three
months.  You can't get two months.  It has to be either $21 for three or $6.50
times 12 for one year.  If it's locked, you can add $20, or if it's not
pagenet, then same thing.  It has to be one or the other.  NEVER both.

But wait about the house.  i keep on bugging my friends about it everyday, and
they're pretty pissed at me.  So, just wait and they will tell me and I will
tell you when everything is done.

want anything else, just in case I can't get anything?  If I really do him up
good with a whole mess of deals, how many more can he get me?  Well, Tell me
other stuff that he might want just in case I can't use it at Oaktree.  I can
use it at Aeropostel for SURE 100%, because I already made a deal with my

can't get unhooked pagers either.  It's really way to hard to get caught with
