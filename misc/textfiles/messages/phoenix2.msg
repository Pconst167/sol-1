Hackers Charged with Selling Computer Codes to Soviets on Trial<
                CELLE, West Germany (AP) _ Three West Germans ``hackers'' went
on trial Thursday charged with selling Western military computer
passwords and codes to the Soviets.
                Dirk Brzesinski, Peter Carl and Markus Hess were arrested last
March after an investigation by U.S. and West German officials
revealed they had obtained information giving them access to key
military and research computers in the United States, Western
Europe and Japan.
                A fourth man, 30-year-old Karl Koch, who was also arrested in
the case, committed suicide in May.
                Brzesinski, 30, a computer specialist, told the court that Koch
had come up with the idea of selling the information.
                ``We decided in 1986 to sell the information to the Soviets for
1 million marks ($605,000) to help them even out the technical
know-how advantage of the West,'' Brzesinski said.
                Carl, 35, said he was responsible for contacting the Soviet
trade mission in East Berlin, where he dealt with a contact
identified only as ``Serge.''
                Carl said he did not want to reveal anything more about the
Soviets in court for fear of reprisals.
                Court records show Carl made at least 25 contacts with the
Soviets and received a total of 90,000 marks ($54,500) for the
information.
                According to Brzesinski, Koch before his death claimed he had
managed to gain access to the U.S. Defense Department general
databank known as Optimus.
                After the arrests last year, U.S. and West German news media
reported that other computers the hackers entered included a NASA
and a ``Star Wars'' research computer, as well as computers linked
to nuclear weapons and energy research in Los Alamos, N.M., and the
Fermi Laboratory in Illinois.
                However, U.S. officials said last year that although the
hackers
obtained sensitive codes and passwords to enter the computers, they
were stopped short of obtaining any highly classified information.
                Investigators have said that codes and passwords from computers
in Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and West Germany were
also obtained and sold to the Soviets.
                A verdict in the trial, scheduled to be completed in 12
sessions, is expected Feb. 8. The men face up to 15 years in prison
each if convicted.

AM-Computer Worm,0518<
Berkeley Programmer Says Worm Hid Itself From Victims<
By WILLIAM KATES=
Associated Press Writer=
           SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) _ The ``worm'' program that paralyzed a
nationwide computer network in November 1988 was designed so its
victims wouldn't know how they were being attacked, a computer
expert testified Thursday.
           Robert T. Morris' rogue program used several methods to worm its
way into the Internet network, said Keith Bostic, a program analyst
at the University of California at Berkeley.
           ``It was designed to break into as many computer systems as
quickly as possible and escape detection as it was doing so,''
Bostic said on the second day of testimony in Morris' computer
tampering trial in U.S. District Court.
           Morris, 25, of Arnold, Md., is charged under the 1986 Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act with ``hacking'' into a federal computer
network. If convicted, he faces as many as five years in prison and
a $250,000 fine.
           Prosecutors allege he devised and unleashed a program that
replicated wildly, immobilizing an estimated 6,000 computers linked
to Internet, including those at NASA and several Air Force
installations and universities.
           Defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni has said that Morris created
the worm as a computer security experiment, but that he made a
programming mistake that let the worm go berserk.
           Guidoboni said during opening statements that once Morris
learned of the problems his program was causing, he tried to stop
it, and when that failed, he tried to alert network users.
           But Bostic testified that no one in Berkeley's computer science
research group received any warning about the worm from Morris.
           Four top computer programmers worked 16 hours to crack the
worm's defenses, he said.
           According to Bostic, the worm entered the school's computer
system by using two defects in the software used by the system and
by solving passwords, either through a list built into the worm or
by checking possible guesses against the computer's own internal
dictionary.
           The worm also took advantage of the computers' ``trust'' for one
another on the same system, a process by which a second computer
will allow access to the system after seeing that an account
already has been authorized by another computer on that system,
Bostic said.
           The rogue program hid itself in four ways, he told jurors.
           It traveled via binary code, rather than a more easily read
source code, and those parts of the program that could be read by a
literate user were encrypted to further mask what the worm was
doing, Bostic said.
           Morris' program also was set up so that it provided phony
identification names when Berkeley's scientists were trying to
trace it. The worm created more deception by periodically changing
the program identification number attached to it by the Berkeley
computer system, he testified.
           Bostic said the ``quick and powerful attack'' by the worm left
no computer on the university system untouched.
           ``It would break into as many machines as it could, even
machines it could not run on. It was completely indiscriminate,''
Bostic said.

10/132: Another update.... the case continues....
Name: Phiber Cut #34
Date: Sun Jan 14 08:06:59 1990
        SYRACUSE, N.Y. (UPI) -- A graduate student said Friday it was
``pretty amazing'' to watch classmate Robert Morris break into a
computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a program
that could land the computer whiz in jail.
        Dawson Dean III testified that five days before Morris allegedly
unleashed a destructive program called a ``worm,'' he showed Dean he
could enter an MIT computer without the machine acknowledging the
intrusion.
        ``The machine didn't know that he was logged in,'' said Dean, an
MIT graduate and doctoral candidate at Cornell Univesity. ``It was
pretty amazing.''
        Morris, 25, of Arnold, Md., is the first person to be prosecuted
under a portion of the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
        He was indicted in July on a charge of causing financial loss by
intentionally introducing a program into a military and research
computer network without authorization. If convicted, he faces up to
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
        Dean said the incident on Oct. 28, 1988, was preceeded by Morris
allowing him to look over his shoulder at a computer terminal on
Cornell's Ithaca, N.Y., campus and scan a list of more than 400
passwords Morris had discovered. The passwords had been translated from
an ``encrypted,'' or coded, form into English.
        ``There are 4,096 ways to encrypt a given password,'' Dean said.
``He said he had done it basically to see if it was possible to do.''
        Dean said Morris gave him the ``impression'' a computer at Cornell
spent four days running a program the defendant had designed to find the
true spelling of the encrypted passwords.
        ``I asked him, `Is mine in the list?''' Dean said. ``I also asked
him if the password of this other really obnoxious graduate student was
(listed).''
        Dean confirmed for Justice Department trial lawyer Ellen Meltzer
the list he read that night was similar to one investigators found in
computer files Morris maintained at Cornell.
        Dean testified Morris told him he would pursue a doctorate and
career in computer languages and, although he already had extensive
experience in computer security, did not plan to write his thesis on
security issues.
        ``He told me he had hacked around with computers before,'' Dean
said.
        Under cross examination from defense attorney David O'Brien, Dean
said he thought the suspect's efforts to break computer security systems
was the result of an inquisitive mind.
        ``He was a graduate student of computer science. You're learning to
do research. It's a real natural instinct to want to learn how the thing
works,'' Dean said.
        Earlier, William Johnston, a computer systems manager at the
Lawrence Berkely Laboratory in California, said the worm did not at any
time endanger cancer patients at the research center, but cost the lab
in excess of $10,000 to purge the system.
        Morris was a 1988 Harvard University graduate attending his first
semester of graduate school when, prosecuters argue, his program
replicated out of control Nov. 2, 1988, and froze about 6,000 computers
linked to the major military and research computer networks Internet and
Arpanet.
        A Cornell investigation found Morris, who has been suspended from
the university until September, worked alone on the program, which it
termed a ``juvenile act that ignored the clear potential consequences.''

Well, it wasn't the overwriting that caused a problem. He put a mechanism in 
it that "queried" a target system - if the worm was already installed, it 
would ignore the system. But he decided that this would be an easy way to 
defeat it, so set the thing to go ahead and re-install on about 1 in 1000 
systems. He figured this would hit a couple a day - it turned out that it 
could be several hundred per hour. This clogged up the internet lines and 
slowed things down massively. (Yes, there were other symptoms - but this is 
the most obvious.)  
There are a couple of people on here who are testifying at that trial. We'll 
have to ask them for a summary once they're done.  (Yes, I know they can't 
talk about it until it's over.)

Welp, Phrack magazine is dead. Those of you who pay attention to BITNET know 
that the phrack accounts at U of M have been shut down. The story is as 
follows...
Government agents (not sure of the dept., probably SS) have apparently been 
monitoring the e-mail of the Phrack kids (Knight Lightning & Taran King) for 
some time now. Apparently, a portion of a file sent to them (and subsequently 
published) contained copyrighted information. This is all they needed. They 
have now seized the entire Phrack net mailing list (over 500 accounts), plust 
every piece of information that Randy & Craig have (and they have a *LOT*) on 
real names, addresses and phone numbers.
This is evolving directly out of the busts of three LOD members (Urvile, 
Leftist & Prophet). The Prophet (who is on probation) is apparently being 
threatened with a prison term if he doesn't cooperate. We don't know for sure 
if he cooperated or not, but what would you do in the same position?
The same officials are apparently *VERY* interested in our co-sys, Mr. 
Bloodaxe. His net account is being watched, etc. I'll let him tell the story.
Anyone wishing to communicate with Erik or myself should do so through the 
board only. I will be adding a secure (and I mean fucking secure) encryption 
routine into the e-mail in the next 2 weeks - I haven't decided exactly how to 
implement it, but it'll let two people exchange mail encrypted by a password 
only known to the two of them. Hmmmm... carry this conversation to the 
programming board.
Anyway, I do not think I am due to be busted, but then again, I don't do 
anything but run a board. Still, there is that possibility. I assume that my 
lines are all tapped until proven otherwise.
There is some question to the wisdom of leaving the board up at all, but I hae 
(have) personally phoned several government investigators and invited them to 
join us here on the board. If I begin to feel that the board is putting me in 
any kind of danger, I'll pull it down with no notice - I hope everyone 
understands.
It looks like it's sweeps-time again for the feds. Let's hope all of us are 
still around in 6 months to talk about it.

Break-In Shows Military Computer Vulnerable _ Prosecutor<
           SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) _ Three Silicon Valley computer workers
have been charged with breaking into government and telephone
company computers in a case that prosecutors said Thursday
demonstrates the vulnerability of those systems.
           The three are accused of committing what may be the first
electronic invasion of a military computer network, according to
one expert. A federal indictment charges them with obtaining flight
orders for a military training exercise, of eavesdropping on
private telephone conversations and getting FBI information on
associates of the late Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos.
           The case ``does signal a vulnerability'' in the Pentagon's
computers, U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said Thursday at a news
conference in San Francisco.
           The indictment, unsealed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San
Jose, is one of the first in the nation to use federal criminal
statutes directed at computer crime, said assistant U.S. Attorney
Robert K. Crowe in a news release.
           The charges, Crowe said, reveal ``the extreme vulnerability of
the phone network.''
           Charged were Kevin L. Poulsen, 24, a former employee of SRI
International, a Menlo Park computer consulting company; Mark K.
Lottor, 25, a current SRI employee; and Robert E. Gilligan, 31, who
worked for computer-maker Sun Microsystems.
           ``Poulsen could do whatever he wanted to do with the telephone
system as well as with government computers,'' Crowe said Wednesday.
           The three are charged with 19 counts of conspiracy; computer
fraud; fraud involving computer access devices; using fictitious
names or addresses; possession of electronic wiretapping devices;
falsely repesenting a social security number; interception of
electronic communications; embezzlement and theft of public
property.
           Poulsen is named in 17 counts involving all of the offenses;
Lottor is named in five counts and Gilligan named in seven counts.
           If convicted, Lottor and Gilligan face 20 years in prison and
fines of $30,000. Poulsen could be sentenced to 37 years in prison
and a $50,000 fine.
           According to the indictment, Poulsen used common burglary tools
including surgical gloves, powdered graphite and lock picks, and
forged a Pacific Bell employee card to steal the telecommunications
equipment and access codes from the regional phone company's
offices.
           Gilligan and Poulsen are accused of trafficking in codes that
allow access to government computers through electronic mail.
           The pair got access to the Army's Masnet Computer Network, the
indictment said without detailing uses of the computer.
           In late 1987 and early 1988, Poulsen got air tasking orders for
a military exercise at Fort Bragg, N.C., called CPX Caber Dragon,
the indictment said. The information, secret at the time, has been
declassified because the event has already taken place, Russoniello
said.
           The Marcos information was a computer list of phone numbers and
cable assignments of Marcos and others that related to an FBI
investigation, the indictment said.
           Peter G. Neumann, a computer security expert at SRI, said this
was the first case he knew in which classified information was
allegedly obtained by computer break-ins.
           The indictment accuses Poulsen of using his computer knowledge
to obstruct the investigation into his alleged activities.
           Gilligan and Lottor were expected to surrender voluntarily.
Poulsen, who called federal authorities but manipulated the
computer so the call couldn't be traced, remained at large.
           Poulsen quit SRI in 1988 and took a job at Sun but later moved
back to Los Angeles to live with his parents, said Donn Parker,
security expert and senior management consultant with SRI.
           Poulsen was hired by SRI despite company officials' belief he
once broke into a computer at the University of California, Los
Angeles, Parker said.
           ``The people who hired him did know he had some hacker
experience in his background, but he was a very bright guy,''
Parker said. They considered the earlier incident youthful excess,
he said.
           The indictment doesn't indicate what authorities believe the men
intended to do with the military secrets, but Parker said Poulsen
told him several years ago that his youthful exploits were
motivated by curiosity.
           ``I knew him as a typical young hacker. At least in past
conversations he told me he was motivated by curiosity and the
challenge to get into systems,'' Parker said.

Name: Ripper #51
Date: Sat Jan 20 21:05:55 1990
Well-
 
A copyright infringment isn't all that major that the SS would bust them for 
just that.  I'm willing to bet they intercepted something bigger than a simple 
copyright piracy case.  Although they would be interested since the 
information is being transported accross state (and quite likly) national 
boundries.
About the San Jose case, sounds like they just got access to the TAN 
(Technical Access Network), and went from there.  Along with their other 
antics, they'll prob get a prison term, because they are really strict on the 
wiretap bit.  I don't get the part about the false names and addresses.  The 
courts have said in the past, you can just pick a name out of the blue and use 
it, and you can give any kind of information (like a false address or phone 
number for instance) as long as the documentation is not for an official 
purpose and is not intended to defraud someone.
I noticed Peter Neumann in there, he's a guy to listen to, and many of you 
might reconize him from the Risks forum on the net.  He is one of the few 
public figures involved in computers that knows which way is up.
Recap-
Phrack will most likly get a slap on the wrist, but will have a sober look at 
the world, and won't be inclinded to be as high profile as they were.
The San Jose case, I'm betting it'll turn high profile, and there will be alot 
of pressure for a nice long lock up.
Most of this is based on my dealings with local, state, and federal law, as 
well as experience I gain while working for the County of San Diego.

We can now expect a crackdown because of the shit wiht the virus,the boys in

The phrack boys were just the start, i'm sure of it..
I just hope that i can pull through this one..and that my friends can also.
This is the time to watch yourself...
No matter what you are into.. whether it's just codes,cards,etc...
Apparently the government has seen the last straw in their point of view.
Unfortunately with all of this in the news now, they will be able to get more 
government money to combat hackers.
And thats BAD fucking news for us.
I think they are going after all the "teachers" etc/.. people who educate 
others into this sort of thing..
(which i didn't need to say because it's obvious after what happened to randy 
& craig)
i wonder if they think that maybe these remote cases are linked in any way..
The only way they can probably see is that we are hackers..
And so that is where their energies will be put..
To stop ALL hackers..and stop people BEFORE they can becomea threat..
After they wipe out the educators taht is.
Just a theory.

Craig was very upset when I talked to him a few days ago.
The Secret Service had been to their school and had taken all information off 
of their public accounts through the university...this included the ENTIRE 
phrack internet mailing list, future files, old issues, various lists of info 
on people they knew, etc...
Craig assured me that they didn't go through his room, or even mess with his 
pc, but that didn't matter, as they got enough from the system at school.
The problems stem from various articles published through Phrack, most 
specifically an article dealing with E911 that was written by The Prophet.  
They have said that this was stolen from a computer system, and was accepted 
and distributed knowing that it was illegally obtained propriatary 
information.  
(The Prophet was one of the 3 LOD members busted this summer in Atlanta)  This 
led to various questions dealing with LOD in general and a great deal of 
hazing towards Craig.  
For the most part, they pulled the same crap:  "We know what you did, so if 
you're smart you'll talk, or we'll make your life shit."  And the other 
approach, "Look, we know you're a smart kid with a bright future and we really 
 wouldn't want to see you fuck things up."  Basic cop bullshit.
Craig was visited first by 3 agents, and Randy was supposedly to be visited 
the following day.  (They are at different schools now)
They were interested in the Telenet Directory, The EFT Files, which by now, 
everyone knows that I wrote, since they had been grabbing the boys e-mail.
That pisses me off greatly, as Electronic Mail is supposed to be covered under 
the same protection as regular mail now, or so I understood.  I thought it was 
a felony to interfere with peoples mail.  Can you commit a felony, to stop a 
suspected one from occurring?  I hope not...hell, maybe Noriega is in charge 
now...
In anycase, I think I'm in for a world of shit...

Name: Erik Bloodaxe #2

I do not live in a fascist country...or so I thought.
INformation is withheld, people are threatened daily by an elite group of 
Government thugs who operate above the law, hell, what do you call that kind 
of bullshit?
I'm growing more and more pissed by the minute...if I do get nabbed, which I 
semi-expect to, so you SS boys take a good look at this, I am dangerous.  
Maybe not in a physical manner, although I'm kinda suicidal, and don't know 
how I'll be on any given day, and I've only tried to kill my roomate once with 
a big knife, and I've only broken wine bottles over two people...
But, I am dangerous in that I'm quite eloquent and VERY outspoken on topics 
about which I feel strongly.  Guess what?  I kinda have a personal leaning 
towards computer crime.  Think carefully about reprocussions world-wide when 
reporters find out just how insecure your precious Internet is, or think about 
the stock fluctuations on Fortune 500 companies when their shareholders find 
out just how easily the company cuuld be shut down for a few days with a few 
keystrokes, or consider the implications following just a few choice comments 
about the lack of security at large banking institutions...hell, How fucking 
skilled does someone have to be to sit on a nua and capture every fucking 
Saudi Visa?  (No offense Par) but that shit is totally rediculous.  Security 
is pathetic, and the ones who can fix it, or at least point it out are 
supressed, and placed in jail.  
Fuck that.  If that's what you expect to do to me, then you had better be 
prepared to blow my fucking head off when you kick in the door, because I will 
be heard.

Kill 'em all..as I like to say.  Seriously, what can they prove if you are a 
safe hacker?  (hacking via outdials, phreaking with divertors only..no codes 
etc.  nothing traceable)  They can't prove a damn thing.  So what do they do, 
but nail you on something trivial like copyright violation.  All that shows is 
that they have such a weak case that there is nothing solid to bust on.  
Enough rambling for this paragraph...
What we need to do is set up a hackers network where everyone has their hands 
in a few systems.  That way, we have this sort of insurance that Phoenix 
talked about:  if one hacker gets busted 2 systems _die_.  2 hackers get 
busted 4 systems bite the dust.  3 hackers...9 systems.  They need to quit 
messing with people who wouldn't otherwise be harmful to the computer world.

as to the copyright info. try to get it through the library or the

    Erik, what's wrong with the continual releasal of Phrack.  Why not go 
ahead and release Phrack 31 (32?).  I mean seriously, what more could piss of 
the feds (or whoever).
 
    I mean it.  Seriously, if we just start some new newsletter, its not going 
to be any different, but by their viewpoint, they'd have destroyed a 
publication that is dated as far back as 1986 or 1985.  If we continue to 
release Phrack's, and I mean put some HARRY shit in there, we would show them 
that they cannot just pull us down.  We're unified, we're strong, and we're 
willing to stand up to them.
 
    [Of course, I don't mean personally.  grin.]

And, I was just wondering, because my account went bad just 2 days 
(approximately) after I had just finished discussion with TK about setting up 
an FTP site for the phracks... I know I was on it because I got some letter 
(to 2 of my accounts, which both are dead now) talking about a pirate-oriented 
newsletter organized like phrack... I just thought it is very much a 
possibility that that is the reason it got deleted.

Name: Pain Hertz #84
Date: Sat Jan 27 01:43:38 1990
Okay, I haven't been on for a few days and I just went through a slew of 
messages.  First off, I happen to know a guy who is security at TK and KL's 
school (TK's ex-school).  This guy, he says that he knows nothing about the 
mess and seemed to think it was a big story.  I don't know if he is just 
blowing hot air up my ass or what...probably.  He said he would keep his ears 
open for me, probably back stab, we shall see.
 
I agree with all of those that say Phrack (or another newsletter/magazine) 
should continue.  Those close to KL and TK should talk to them about a name.  
I had written an article for Phrack 31, which I am willing to submit for this 
new venture if it gets off the ground.
About distribution, I know of a few anonymous FTP sites that will let you PUT 
stuff.  Usually folks use these to swap .GIF files, but they could be used for 
whatever.  Perhaps a 'girlie' magzine could be created.  PUT the newsletter, a 
text file, as a name like FATBABE.GIF.  Those that GET it either know what it 
is or think their .GIF viewer is fried.  Anyone who GETs it not knowing what 
it is and finds out, so what?  It doesn't have to have anyones addresses in 
it.  Whats your opinion friend?
 
About gettting even/back, blackmail etc.  Being destructive is not good for 
previously posted reasons.  How about us collectively writing a story and 
sending it to the AP or something?  We, as a team, can get the story better 
than any reporter.  I seriously thought about calling the damn SS saying i'm 
Dan Rather or something and asking what the deal with Randy and Craig is.  
What the FEDS did with this pseudo-bust is only gain information about who is 
*who* and where etc.   This is the easiest information for them to get 
anyways.  Often thats because of p/h -ers narcing on each other (read the 
PHRACK circle trilogy if you haven't).  If the SS knew that Joe Hacker did 
something and they found out that Joe Hacker's internet address is such in 
such.  They know that some one calling themself (lves?) Joe Hacker used that 
account.  Whether it was the real owner or not remains to be proved.  The 
burden of proof is on them.  Still, if handles didn't matter, no one would use 
them anyways.
well shit. this is getting long....

Well, it looks like everyones pushed the UT administrators to disabling all 
links from off-campus... We can no longer telnet to off-campus sytems thru 
network... For awhile you could use UTAUS, but know logins there are disabled 
because they are turning off the cabality to telnet off-campus. I was on EMX 
just a few minutes ago telnet'ing to frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu when I was 
kicked off, and I keep getting kicked off (same thing that happens at the 
annex when you tryo telnet off-campus). All those people shouldnt have used 
the systems to hack so much and (mainly this) play GAMES like TINYMUD! The UT 
administrators were getting tired of all the annex ports always being full.

First off...if the "BUST" you are referrong to is Mark & Joey and some other 
Queens punk, I think that is bullshit.  A friend of mine talked to  Mark a few 
days ago (after the reported bust) and Mark said nothing about it.
Programming switches, hacking LMOS...busted...well, we'll see.  If it is true, 
hell, chalk up another LOD bust and we'll scratch Phiber Optik off the active 
list...

Mark?  You been busted boy?
Another thing...Dark Sun:  you little thug...I didn't change the pw on your 
fucking act account, so stop your incessant whining about it...accounts on the 
disney suns are terribly easy to run through a dictionary hacker, so do that 
if you so desparately want back on them...there is NOTHING there...and if a 
CHAT thing ends up on there and I find it, I'll be  pissed off...run that off 
of ugwa, or whatever.
Why do you want on there anyway?  Why do you have to make such a big deal with

I'm not talking about safety.  When you're on the system and things are 
getting logged, it's not worthwhile to be playing games.  You can do that

Criminals Have Discovered Computers<
           WASHINGTON (AP) _ Criminals have discovered the value of
computers and are using them ``in crimes of unprecedented economic
cost,'' the National Instiute of Justice said Friday.
           The institute cited a recent accounting firm study that
estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in thefts each year by high-tech
criminals.
           ``Increasingly, computers are being found in the illegal
activities of drug networks,'' said Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh. ``Drug traffickers use them to communicate with each
other, record their transactions and transfer and launder money.''
           The crimes include electronic funds transfer fraud and theft of
commercial inventories.
           The report mentioned a former insurance firm employee in Fort
Worth, Texas, who used a program to delete more than 160,000
records from the company's computer and also a prostitution ring
that had a data base of more than 80,000 clients, their credit card
numbers and sexual preferences.

Well, I have been interested in running a BBS on VM for sometime.  I have the 
code for such and am quite capable of writing it anyway.  Anyone else a REXX 
phreak?  Anyways, it has been quite difficult to find a safe VM account on 
Bitnet (or any net running RSCS/JNET/JES2 and its compatibles).  The 
requirements are that it is TELNET-able, has at least 2 cylinders of disk 
space, is able to run in DSC indefinately, and that the admins don't care 
about RSCS traffic.  If you have such an account and are interested in running 
a BBS/Chat/Fileserver plz get im touch with me.

Man Arrested in Alleged Computer Extortion<
           CLEVELAND (AP) _ A zoologist accused of unleasing a computer
virus that crippled computers in England and other countries two
months ago was arrested on a fugitive warrant in Ohio.
           Joseph W. Popp was arrested Thursday and is being held on a
federal fugitive warrant. He is charged in warrants issued by
Scotland Yard in London with blackmail and extortion.
           During an initial court appearance here today, Popp, 39, told
U.S. Magistrate Joseph W. Bartunek that he is under a
psychiatrist's care and must take drugs for a mental condition.
           Bartunek said he would schedule another hearing after two
psychiatrists evaluate Popp to see whether he is competent to face
further proceedings. A date was not set.
           Popp, a zoologist who worked for the World Health Organization,
is from Willowick, about 10 miles east of Cleveland, said defense
attorney John P. Kilroy. It was not immediately clear whether Popp
is still affiliated with the organization.
           The warrant alleges Popp distributed about 20,000
computer-crippling disks from London around Dec. 11. The disks were
labeled ``AIDS Information Introductory Diskette.''
           The U.S. attorney's office in Cleveland said the disks had
information on acquired immune deficiency syndrome for use by
hospitals, researchers and others.
           But authorities said the disks, when inserted into personal
computers by unsuspecting recipients, halted accessibility to any
other information in the computer.
           At the end of the program, the disk asked the computer user for
a leasing fee of up to $378, then printed an invoice with a Panama
address where money was to be sent, federal prosecutors said.
Computer owners were told that the rogue program they had inserted
in their computer would stop the machine from functioning unless
the money was paid.
           At the time the diskette began causing problems in early
December, authorities in London said it had been received by users
in Norway, Sweden and Denmark as well as Britain. Scotland yard
said at least 10 British computers were affected.

PM-911 Hackers,0462<
^Two Charged with Breaking into Nine-State 911 Emergency Phone
Network<
^By PAUL A. DRISCOLL=
^Associated Press Writer=
           CHICAGO (AP) _ A computer hacker broke into the 911 emergency
telephone network covering nine states in the South and another
intruder passed on the access data to other hackers, authorities
said.
           Robert J. ``The Prophet'' Riggs, 20, of Decatur, Ga., and Craig
M. ``Knight Lightning'' Neidorf, 19, of Chesterfield, Mo., were
indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury and accused of computer
crimes, said acting U.S. Attorney Ira H. Raphaelson.
           He said Riggs was a member of the so-called Legion of Doom
hackers group, whose members are involved in numerous illegal
activities.
           Riggs and two other alleged members also were indicted Tuesday
in Atlanta and charged in other computer break-ins.
           The government would not say if any emergency calls were
disrupted or whether other damage was done during the tampering.
           ``These were not teen-agers playing games,'' Raphaelson said.
``They are thieves, they're reckless and they're dangerous.''
           In the Chicago case, Riggs is accused of entering Atlanta-based
Bell South's 911 system with a computer, stealing a copy of the
program that controls the system and publishing this data on a
hackers' computer bulletin board in Lockport.
           Neidorf is accused of transferring the data to his computer at
the University of Missouri in Columbia, where he allegedly edited
it for a computer hacker publication known as PHRACK.
           There was no immediate comment from either defendant. Directory
information had no listing for Riggs, and there was a recorded
message at the Neidorf residence. Neidorf's attorney, Art Margulis,
said he had not seen the indictment so he could not comment.
           Raphaelson said industry specialists estimate that $3 billion to
$5 billion is lost yearly to computer fraud. He said this is the
fourth hacker case brought by the federal government in the past
year.
           Bell South's 911 controls emergency calls to municipal police,
fire, ambulance and emergency services in Alabama, Mississippi,
Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, South
Carolina and Florida.
           ``People who invade our telecommunications and related computer
systems for profit or personal amusement create immediate and
serious consequences for the public at large,'' said Raphaelson.
           He said the 911 data was valued at nearly $80,000, but would not
say how a hacker could profit by stealing this data, other than by
selling the information to others.
           Riggs, if convicted on all charges, could be sentenced to 32
years in prison and fined $222,000. Neidorf could be sentenced to
31 years and fined $122,000 on conviction.
           Riggs and Neidorf are charged with interstate transportation of
stolen property, wire fraud and violations of the Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act of 1986.

I'm sure most of you have probably heard or given this speech(?) at some time 
or another.  
         It seems to me that many of the hackers problems today stem form 
disunity.  Most hackers tend to be loners, and very intelligent compared to 
the rest of the "A car a house 2.2 kids and a dog" society.  Because of this, 
we tend to do things alone, or in very small groups.  If you think about it, 
and I mean REALLY think, not just in passing thought,  if the hackers had a 
bit more unity we could accomplish quite a lot more.  At the current rate, all 
(well, most) of todays hackers will have quit or been busted within 10 years.  
The newer generations are faced with more and more problems in learning how to 
hack, so the population is rapidly decreasing.  What if we were able to put 
away all the petty bullshit and bickering and really go at this?  The more 
experienced ones of us could teach the new people that show potential, and 
therefore continiue the society.  A unification of the computer underground 
would more than triple the effectiveness, and allow us to explore more and 
learn more than if we continiue to go our own way.  
Just a thought, and not to coherent after 40 hrs no sleep, but I think you 
will get the idea here...
Oh, and one more thing...Its obvious that every day more and more things 
become computerized...The more control we have over computers, the more 
comtrol we will have over our lives...After all, Big Brudder isn't my favorite 
guy....

Ayn Rand does have a well structured viewpoint that is well worth 
reading/listening to...I also suggest "The Fountainhead".
 
One addition reason for the individualtiy  of most hackers...and in my mind he 
the most important one is as follows:
 
The fewer number of people that are involved in a certain 
orginization/society/group..etc...greatly edcreases the likelihood of an 
information breech.  I am not just talking about "group secrets" (although it 
certainly applies), but rather am appling this TRUTH to the entire H/P 
community.  I usually stand by a few general rules...one of which is "If I do 
not know you I do not trust you"...with the strong option for "I know you 
THERFORE I do not trust you".
 
Yeah it would be just peachy if the entire "underground community" could bind 
together into one big close knit LOYAL happily Cleaver-esque family.
Realistically though..this will not happen...nor do I think that I want it to. 
 I for one HAPPEN TO LIKE a certain amount of indivduality in my life.

hm...got some attention.
I, being a MAJOR Libertarian in my beliefs, although not quite as radical 
publicly as I'd like to have the nerve to be, relate strongly to the needs 
people have when dealing with a totally overbearing and somewhat outdated 
method of government.
Unfortunately, being in america, we no longer have minds in power capable of 
reaching decisions that would mold this country into something worth dieing 
for.  People like that are now held back by the good-ol'-boy system of 
government.  It's not what you know, but who you know, and how much money you 
have.
I am kind of radical in my ideas about what I'd do with an ounce of power, but 
a lot of the things I feel strongly about are shared by a great number of 
mainly conservative types.  Like cutting defense of Japan, nationalizing the 
health industry, legalizing drugs, starting a whole wide-range of social 
programs for everyone from the elderly to the homeless...etc...
But, again, this IS America, where the attitude is to kick back and let things 
happen.  We are no longer the new kid with the zest for life...we are the 
tired old redneck who likes to sit at the gas station drinking a beer and 
watching kids play while  we talk to others like us about the good old days.
Bullshit.
But, until people like myself who are disgusted with this situation come into 
a position (or age) to do something about it, or at least let our voices be 
heard, the disgusting current state of affiars will continue.
I just hope that by the time that happens, we all won't have fallen prey to 
the unbelievable degree of sloth that our leaders have fallen victim to.

Name: Psychedelic Ranger #80
Date: Mon Feb 05 03:22:34 1990

Some of EF!'s opinions (at least the ones held by the people such as
Dave Foreman - the so-called "founder" of Earth First!) are dogmatic
and one-away-from-the-real-issue. For instance, their main idea is that
the earths problems are due to the fact that the earth is overpopulated,
and that excess population is bad. Dave Foreman, or someone similar,
said once "If AIDS did not exist, it would be responsible for the
radical environmentalists to create one" which I think is bullshit.
They need to look back at the cause of the overpopulation, which, in
my opinion is the fact that our whole economic system and social
system seems to be based around sex. Of course there are al ot of other
factors involved as well. But I would still call myself a member of
EF! even though I don't belive in some of their ideas. I agree with them
that the earth needs to be protected and that people must learn or
pay. But, as far as some of the stuff, "throw a brick through a plate
glass window of some corrupt corporation" well, what happens then
to the shattered peices of glass? They get picked up, and thrown
away, or worse yet, just lay there. Either way, this is contributing
to the garbage and waste level. The company will just buy another
window, which pumps out more money into the economy, and puts more
money in uncle sam's pocket (taxes for instance) which propogates the
shit even further. So I think some of the "radical" actions are
(at least time-scope wise) just another part of the problem. But
there are a lot of variables here too....
I read an article in Live Wild or Die about a "puke-in" held by
protesters at a local mall during christmas season. As a protest
to consumerism, and shopping in general, several people ate a lot
of strange, colored food with various textures. Things like
yogurt, yellow jelly donuts, etc. were consumed. Then the group
each drank some syrup of icepac (dont know if that is the right
spelling) and took their positions in the mall by the Santa
setup. Before they puked, someone yelled "Shopping makes me puke"
and then puked all over the mall ground in front of everyone.
Other members in this group of people held signs sayiing things like
"The earth is dying and your shopping" and "shopping makes me puke"
while they puked and raised a fuss. However, mall security ended up
nabbing one of them, who puked in their office. THey all ended up
getting off with nothing though. Kind of an interesting story.

Someone want to find out?
I think one of these days we Austinites should get a few tapes made of
random calls, and take a case or three on a drive out to the country, 
and look for places on step, or places with xbar toll offices and 
goddamn well find us a route to box again.  I miss the hell out of
boxing.  I used to find ALL kinds of great stuff hidden away
on the 0XX & 1XX prefixes.  
I remember one time me and a guy named MOB*RULES were scanning away
in 512, roaming the tandems, finding all kinds of strange things
that would wink and await further MF...he had some kind of MF DNR on
his line though (because of some previous entanglements) and ended
up getting a nasty call, saying to stop scanning, because
one of the things we were playing with was some kind of GSA owned
link from FTS to Bell or vice versa...kinda neat.  (At least that's what
he said was told to him...he lied a lot)
I did find both the Houston and Dallas alliance bridges...when everyone
thought there were only White Plains & Los Angeles...YES that was ME.
Houston disappeared after 4 months...and Dallas was the chosen site.
So what we need is the translate the 0700's and find a route that will allow
us to box again, so I don't have to worry about getting my Long Distance
bill ever again.

The problem isn't where you box from, it's where you box to, and the
route it travels to get to a final destination.
Our problem seems to be that our trunk routing to boxable areas,

OK - does the following... pick up a line and it completes a loop, places you

through thi common equipment shit, and that will only acccept dtmf tones. It 
then translates your tone, sends them to exchange <CCITT #5> and the rest you

second you break out of the CEPT <common equipment..> it breaks your loop, and

re: wardialing
first off, i seriously doubt anyone will complain about someone harassing them

do you call ma bell when someone calls and doesnt say anything just once?
secondly, i just said fuck it and started from scratch on a non-sequential 
wardialer for my 64, i just need to come up with a decent algorythem that will 
eventually do all numbers in a prefix, while not doing the set sequentially.
re: datataps
i got mine working virtually error free upto 1200 baud.  i've not tried 2400 
baud yet, but will soon.  300 baud is damn easy and doesnt really require 
quality equipment, but noone uses 300 anymore, at least noone who has a

the vcr idea is a good one, but as Dark Sun pointed out they're rather hard to

46/77: random..
Name: Phelix The Hack #89
Date: Mon Jan 29 12:15:30 1990
The problem with simply gerating random numbers is that the seed is likely to 
generate the same number more than once and some numbers not at all.  Ex: a 
random number generator is told to generate 10000 numbers between the numbers 
1 and 10000...it is certainly "possible" that all of those numbers will be the 
same.
 
Here is a basic algorithm which will allow a non repeating FULL random number 
scan.
   
NOTE:  most of this example will be written in PASCAL with occasional explain 
nations in C.  I will also assume that this is used to scan a certain prefix 
so the boundaries will be 1 to 10000  (or actually 0 to 9999...to save word 
space...we must be FRUGAL!)
 
ok..define the following structure:
 
TYPE
    hackrec = record of 
         hackattmpt : integer
    end;
VAR
^^^ whoops ...ignore that
    
    hackarray = array[0..9999] of hackrec;
VAR
    hack : hackarray;
 
ok..now initialize ALL elements "hackattmpt "to the array index..ex:
 
    for count = 0 to 9999 do
         hack[count].hackattmpt = count;
when a number is randomly generated it is substituted as the index for the 
particualr array location..ex: the randomly generated number is in the var 
rand...hack[rand].hackattmpt  would be the reference to the actual number 
displayed.FD
    
Every time a number is used ..the field hackattmpt is changerd to hold the 
number of 9999 (or whatever the last element is); and the filed at index 9999 
is changed to the original index + 1.
 
A chck is made to see if a randomly gernated index holds a value of 9999..if 
it does it will make its new index hack[9999].hackattmpt...and will continue 
...
 
its that easy...any questions?

ESS: Electronic Switching System...  my understanding (from a tech at SWB) is 
that the 7ESS can handle over 40 million simultaneous transmissions (i.e. data 
or voice or video), and I beleive over 4 million independant phone circuits. 
Theoretically, one 7ESS could handle central Texas...
After I beleive 3ESS, they made a drastic move towards more ISDN support, and 
the 5ESS is the most popular here in Austin, I think there are 5 of them (not 
including redundant units, usually 2 per setup)
Something that I remeber from working for a legal newspaer locally is showing 
people how to use their TRW terminals to search our online legal database.  
Those 300 baud pieces of termal paper fueled shit... but they worked... I 
remembered (luckily) a few of the accounts, but all are now invalid... oh

key hashing algorithms. you may be able to break the big array of numbers 
down into smaller groups. you could then select the two groups based on
two seperate keys, group and member. this would mean that at any one time
you would only be hashing one small group of keys. since very few search
algorithms are linear but rather logarithmic a simple halving can have
quite a bit of effect. just a thought.

Pick a random number, 0 - 9999.  Pick another random number 0 - 9.  Say the 
first number is 3849 and the second is 3.  We are dialing the 512 exchange so 
dial...
   512-3849   add the 3 to first place of last 4 digits...
   512-6849   add the 3 to 2nd place of...
   512-6149   add the 3 to 3rd...
   512-6179   add the 3 to 4th...
   512-6172   
 
follow?  if the sum is greater than 9 just subtract 10.  Count how many youve 
dialed, store the last number, position 1-4, and the number 3. and you can 
start and stop whenever...
 
Also, this is going from left to right.  If im not mistaken, you can choose 
the digits to add to in 24 different ways (4!)  so pick another number 1 - 24.
This algorithm won't repeat until youve gone through all the numbers.  How 
many different orders are their to dial using this method?  Well a bunch...
 
I hope everyone can follow this...  if not perhaps Ill write something a bit 
more formal.                 -PHz

Name: The Inspectre #63
Date: Tue Jan 30 23:15:24 1990
  Somebody asked about slowing tape recorders a while back.. 
  It's really easy to do on standard portable sized tape recorders, just open 
the thing up, find the motor (it runs the tape motors via a rubber band over a 
large wheel), yank off the small wheel on the motor and replace it with a 
piece of heat-shrink tubing or other soft rubber tube. Then put the drive band 
back and see what recordings sound like. I've can get about 250 minutes on a 
C-120 with decent (but not great) sound quality with this method. 
  There's a way to get much longer play times with decent quality recordings, 
but it requires taking out the drive band system and rebuilding the link with 
a slower gear drive system, but most recorders are hard to convert easily and 
usually a VOX is a better investment.

can be controlled directly by using a 555 timer to control a 2n2222 transistor

control w/o a loss of torque, a problem w/ varying the diameters of the 
pulleys, except at the very lowest speed. total cost is about $10.

Is this 7ESS brand new? I have not been up on the latest technology
as far as switching systems go, I have been concentrating on VAX/VMS.
The ESS versions I am familiar with are as follows:
1,1A,2,2B,3,4,5. The 5E, along with the Siemens EWSD, NTI's DMS-100F (dms
100 family of switches) are generally setting up the stages for ISDN.
The 4E's are set up in toll switch applications in most cases. The 1,
1A,2,2B, and 3 are set up for different areas, they have different
traffic capacities, different configurations, links to SPCS's, etc. etc.
If you would like, I can post several msgs. about switching systems,
just let me know and I'll post a bunch of specs. if you want them.

plant engineers do not have to learn anything terrible different from what 
they already know.

for ISDN, apparently is is already equiped for ISDN, whereas 5 needs to be 
interfaced somehow.  However what all this means on a basic level is nothing 
realy, other than that you will have a lot more places on the same switch 
under 7...Nice, so you dont have to find a different test number dial up for a

Kermit is a 7-bit transfer protocol that is used to transfer files to/from

NAxx, MFxx, FMxx, and possibly COMx but I think those are usually
defined to be logonable from certain devices only if I remember right.
Or can be defined that way (Message and all that).  If you are looking
for WC's, you can get them a shitload of places. Just go trashing
and you'll be likely to get some CLLI codes (common language location 
identification) which contain the WC. The breakdown for some CLLI
codes is something like this: BSTNMABS61T. I think this is the right
number of digits. SO this would be BSTN = BoSToN, MA = Massachusets, BS = Wire 
Center name, 61T = office designation number. So if you are on the
COSMOS that serves this WC (of course COSMOSes dont have to be in the
same NPA as the numbers they "serve", for instance the COSMOS systems
could be centralized in a major city, corp. HQ or something, or some
big MMOC or something...and all the NPA's in that state can then
dial in (or have a hardwired terminal in some cases) to the centrzlied
cosmoses. This happens, and goes contrary to the outdated file on
COSMOS by Lex Luthor and LOD/LOH from 1984. But there is still come

One in particular, although not terribly wild, was to put up an

First off, does anyone have access to their local bell computers?  If so, say
so.  I would love to tell you all what to do on these things, but I
really don't want to just pass on theory, I'd rather see it put into use.
I'm planning quite a dandy COSMOS file sometime, which should make anyone

Another point:  The various bell packet networks.  You all should know by now 
about the RBOC's venture into the packet game.  SBDN, Pulse-net, Microlink II, 
et al...in any case, there ARE wonderful things on these systems.  Most of

Also, SIR is fantastic for finding ALL phone company computers.  SIR is good

Maybe it's just a database, and nowhere near as interactive as LMOS, and maybe
you can't really change or find out personal shit, like you can through
CRIS (that is what that's all about right?) but it's terrible easy to

Not to nitpick, but an LMOS CP is an IBM S370 (3270 is an SNA, used to get to 
BANCS through LOMS for instance).
CRIS, as mentioned, the Customer Record Information System is a dandy little 
IBM system whose main purpose is to house customer records. There are a small 
handful of "CRIS" systems, like LCRIS (Local), and ICRIS (Integrated, which 
should be noted is used by the Residential Service Center). Here in NYNEX, the 
only way to reach these systems  (we obviously aren't hardwired hackers) is 
through BANCS, a bisync network. BANCS is not direct dialable, but IS 
available through a 3270 link on the LOMS system, used by LDMC (LAC or FACS, 
depending where you live). And LOMS IS accessible. A host of systems are also 
available through FACS (which can be reached through LOMS on BANCS) such as 
CIMAP, LMOS, SOP, TIRKS, the COSMOS-PREMISE interface, etc. So as you can see, 
rather than going after any specific system, going after the RIGHT system will 
pay off greatly (LOMS in this example). Oh, waitta-minnit, those mentioned 
systems are off of BANCS, sorry. You can reach FACS on BANCS, and access a 
couple 'o things like some of those mentioned, COSMOS (certain wire centers 
only), etc. OK, enough rambling. Let's hear someone else's input.

First of all, that's MicroLink II, not "datalink". And 3270 IS SNA. 3270 is 
the Synchronous Network Adapter to connect an async terminal to a sync or 
bisync mainframe...
OK... On LOMS, you run the command "3270dsp" which is I believe in /usr/bin. 
Before doing that, you have to run an environment profile (and also READ it in 
order to get the BANCS logon and FACS name).
I believe the proper one is /loms/profiles/BANCSloms.env, or something 
similar. Once the 3270dsp is run, you will be connected to BANCS. Enter "%log 
xxx" where xxx is the logon from the env file. Then, connect to FACS. This is 
also in the env file. Just type what the variable points to. You will then be 
on FACS. I think FACS is easy enough to use without an explanation. 
Now aren't we elyte?

may a minor correction to Phiber's post:
3270 is underlying protocol on the 3274 terminal multiplexers that all IBM 
mainframes use (or some other model like a 3276 that does other things nice 
to).  3270 is aterminal implementation that will only run syncronous (for some 
assenine reason), and is wide spread. The 3101 is a comparable async 
implementation of that standard. 
SNA is System Network Archetecture and was developed and used within IBM. It 
is influential elsewhere, both in layering and in specific protocols, such as 
SDLC (the link data prto.) which have influenced CCITT and ISO.
BTW, 3270 and SDLC are intertwined, and one usually can be associated with the 
other.

when you try and do it...it asks you for the number,...then the callback 
number.  it then hangs you up and calls back the number you entered...anbd 
hooks you into the number you plan to monitor.   Loops would be useful in this

  You can monitor lines via LMOS, but it dosn't hang you up.. You enter the 
IBM via the hicap (High Capacity Front End Processor) or various UNIX front 
ends (ex. ARSB).  It is possible to get to LMOS from other systems, but that 
is for later discussion.  Once in the IBM you enter a special mask (which I 
will not mention) and then you enter an Employee code, Printer, Call Back 
Number, TN You want to verify, and a few other things.  Then you type the
monitor command.  LMOS will respond with "Request In Progress" the number
you gave as a callback will ring, you pick up the phone and dial "0".  Now
the conversation on the busy line is on your call back too.. You can rase or
lower the volume using "+" and "-".

have some test numbers, 1000 Hz, and another one used for checking static.

a whole lot of shit thrown in there. I have found many nice things from
TIRKS printouts (WORD documents actually, Work Order Records and Details)
including dialups to systems, translations to 800 numbers, etc. etc.
And if you xlate the PL (private line) feature code included on the
WORD, you can learn more about the circuit which can lead you to something
you are looking for, perhaps. If anyone has any PL codes they want
xlated, I can do this..but other people can too, it is no big deal.

A typical PL circuit ID is of the form  nnXXXXnnnnnn, such as 27LGGX123456.
What is the signifcance of the LGGX in the above?  I'm guessing it is related
to the class-of-service of the PL (two-wire, four-wire, voice-grade,

You are correct in your guess that the LGGX code is related to the
class of service of the PL. The different positions mean different
things....I don't have my translation of PL codes in front of me
(but I will find out what LGGX is and let you know), but I do have
some old output from something else that has PL's. Here are a few
samples:
TP HIDF-0117  ST WK
SE CLR  ST WK
TP HIDF-0234  ST WK
CP 7-0123 ST WK
PL 7.TLNC.104496..LB  ST WK

PL 7.OSNZ.99944..LB  ST WK
PL 3.TTDZ.151434..LB  ST WK
As if you couldn't tell, these came from a COSMOS system that I
have obtained printouts from. The TLNC, OPNC, OSNZ, and TTDZ are
the codes you are referring to..I am not sure about COSMOS
formatting of PL's since TIRKS carries most of the data on PL
circuits, but you can fish some from COSMOS. But these 4 char
codes are the same as on the WORD documents.

I'm not sure where I read this, but you can follow the wire that comes out of

since you will always have enough recording time to call anywhere in the 
world...you have to think about the long-term:  50 quarters is not that big a 
price to pay for free calls until you get busted!

If you need to get a recording of the coins, just dial a silent termination 
test number and insert quarters while holding a suction cup thingie to the 
mouthpeice of the phone. We did this and it worked great, clean recording.
Other times I have gotten really shitty recordings though and they
only partially work, or not at all, and probably are noticeable due to the 
abnormal call processing. But the other times I was trying to do this, there 
were other factors involved the changed the recording quality.
Then just hit the coin return slot and you get all your $ back..and have your 
pretty musical recording that you can bring to your music class
and play as a representation of such-and-such Milliseconds of such and such 
and so on.

   Well here are a few of my experiences with redboxing... First, some phones 
dont let YOU hear the tones.. They usually let the CALLED person hear them (I 
have never found one that doesnt), so call home, and have your bro record 
them..you can get a VERY good recording that way..
     My main problem with red boxing is that MANY fones in my area MUTE the 
mouthpiece untill the call goes through!  It is VERY stupid because I cant 
even use my pocket dialer (which is a necessity for all payfone 
hackers.heheh)..So you almost always end up putting in a quarter..However, yet 
get it back.. no big deal...
     there are nice ways to "synthesize" the coin tones, but I have had a lot 
of problems with those.. I found that the BEST way to do it was to make a 
small Digitizer with playback..I then digitize it, and just push a button and 
play back into the mouthpiece.. It works very well, and is VERY small..I could 
use SMT to make it even smaller.  I could even dump the ram, and burn an EPROM 
and sell it..hey.. now theres an idea..hehehe

I've been scanning the fuck out of Telenet.

It's kind of interesting.  Systems seem to live exclusively in the
0-1000 range, and a few others lie scattered through the 50000-70000 range.
The systems that hide WAY up there have proven to be QUITE virgin territory.
You have NO idea how virgin.  
I have also come to some kind of conclusion about the ENHANCED NETWORK 
SERVICES NOT AVAILABLE message...  It seems that WAY up there I've found a
ton of systems that connect and ask USER ID, and then PASSWORD, and then 
respond with the identical error message givn when you enter a bad NUI.
It's my guess that the "ENHANCED" services are some kind of closed user group
application, but one that allows a user to connect from any terminal, rather]
than from just one that had been specified, and possibly with an ID not
specifically designed for that CUG.  Dunno about that last part though, as I
don't have any more damn NUI's.

Ok, what you do is connect to another person's pad as they attach to the 
network. When they think they are typing to the network, they are actually 
typing to you. When they attempt a connect, you consult your directory and 
give them a prompt appropriate to the system they're trying to connect to - if 
you don't know what type of system, just give them a login: prompt - as The 
Leftist always says, people are like sheep!
They then type their account name to you. You give them a Password: prompt and 
they type that. You then give them a "INVALID ENTRY, RETRY" and disconnect. 
They assume that they typed the pw in wrong and try again. You should have 
logins for a half-dozen or so systems on hotkeys so that you just hit alt-v 
for vax (or whatever).  Simplest way in the world to snag stuff.

problem has been present on more than one type of software, so although 
possible, it is unlikely that software was problem. Thereore that leaves us

of doing it. but the ideal way would be to run it to a tape deck for later
decoding. while you do have to cut the outer sheath no splicing is done,
this would interrupt the cable and set off security. the sheath incision
can be done in a black bag like those used for fiels film changes. total

From what I know, it's no longer possible (except in VERY few and far between 
systems anyway) on Telenet and I don't know about Tymnet.  Here goes my 
attempt at describing it...
When you call Telenet you type @D^M and get a prompt looking like
512 011B
TERMINAL = 
and you just hit enter for the terminal prompt.  Above the TERMINAL = line 
there is an NUA of your pad.  It's not a private pad that accepts reverse 
charging, but it is a packet-assembler/disassembler.  Pad2pad is when you 
connect to one of these public pads and immitate Telenet.  
Say a user calls up Telenet in NYC and Telenet decides to put him on the next 
available pad...BUT you are already connected to it so what he types goes to 
you.  When he types "ID blahblah..." and his password, you give him the proper 
response.  You also have his NUI.  When he types "C 51359" you have to look in 
your handy-dandy scan directory and then find that it's a VAX and give him the 
right prompts.  You now have his login/password.  Isn't this fun??
Too bad it doesn't work anymore.  Try to apply this concept to other things 
such as phone interception and stuff like that.  THAT'S hacking.

well the basic technology is available in any engineering library. the one
here at ut has several good books on them. a lot of them are connected by
secure dedicated land lines to the banks and s&l's. some of the newer ones
use a coding scheme based on the trap door algorithm which was broken by
the isreali's. but it takes a big machine a long time. nothing even

Hehe...I bet a lot of you didn't know that.
Um...things:
On many tymnet hosts, you can specify different routings, and different
sub-addresses by adding a number after the username.
IE:  username:200 will connect to the host connected to that username at 200.
(if one exists)  This is VERY cool on usernames that go into a subnet.  
For instance, the Veteran's Administration has a subnetwork on Tymnet (Which
I should still be heavily entrenched, if anyone knows a few wounded Vietnam
vets who need extra money in the Disability check) and you can connect
to literally hundreds of different systems by specifying the nubmer after
the colon.  Waycool, eh?
In the case that many of you are familiar with, adding the g and dnic after
the username, ala username:g2624, etc...  That is telling tymnet to rout
the packet connections through whatever gateway needed to complete the call...
SO, when you call france through fradec, you get ftcc, when you call germany, 
you get sf.  Neat.
Also:  the standard for tymnet "Nui's" is a t.  followed by a username, incase
any of you want to hack away.  I'm eventually going to scan ALL usernames
from a to 99999999 when I get around to writing the damn program.  NUA scans
of Tymnet have been done, and a ver recent one should be floating around, 
as Phoenix has just finished it.  The problem I have with NUA's is that
I can only get to them from Canada!  (Or other places) Which is a bitch, 
since I need to figure out a way to do it from Tymnet.  Anyone
know an nui on tymnet that will allow for connections back into 3106?

(in my opinion)
it is the username for the barbados (maybe it was bahametel. don't remember)
the username for their test diag s/w
i think it's a little option we can take to our advantage (the :g )
It seems to work on any username that connects specifically intl (as far as 
i've seen)
thought maybe it meant "global" and then looked thru the DNIC HOST tables and 
prompted you for the rest of the address after looking to see if it was 
actualy in the tables.. there by bypassing the actual address it was supposed 
to connect you to and allowing you to specify one.

Uh, scanning tymnet, if you won't do it nua-wise through DPAC, try doing all 
the combinations, but on each 3rd time, type a username that does connect to 
something so that the error count resets...like old lovable t.fradec02 or 
something...
For you outdial hungry kids...I suggest you get a job and do this:
On tymnet, STARLINKINFO  it will connect you to starlink's information service 
so you can find out all you need to use this...It's tons better than 
pc-persuit, cheaper, and more locations served...
not bad

umm...anyone have any notes to compare on xray (hint hint erik?) I have found 
quite a few VERY interesting "things" (for lack of a better non-descript 
word), and any additional help on PDP-10 /ISIS would be helpful as it gets 
real old learnig from online help mans...

no that will just get you the local number to call for access. the rest
is up to you. i read the intro.
 
isis was also used by intel on the intel mdl 800 development system 
so give them a call and get some manuals on it.
 
we have a bunch of manuals for the pdp 11's, but more are appreciated
what will eventually happen in the next year or so is this, we will 
expand to six phone lines, use novel net to network the 3 pdp's and
about 40 other machines with an i-net node and a compuserve feed 
(it is great being non-profit). this will give us at least 600M
disk space, 2 9 trk for offline stores, and two different international
feeds out of the network at local cost.

Arg...I will send you the whole xray manual if you want...
There is an option to attach to a node and print ascii dataflow...although I 
can't get it to work right, (but I haven't dicked with it seriously at all)
This is good to learn, as I have XRAY access on a ton of TYMNET subnets!  Even 
a bank or two...hehe.
Also, if anyone can get me a TMCS or PROBE or NETVAL manual, or can find 
somewhere where I can get it online...(I know that trw has tem online 
somewhere) I would REALLY appreciate it!

Mentor:  ok..on a PDP-10..running RSTS/TOPS...each sub directory is treated as 
a "user" of the system; regardless of whether or not that is the case.  I can 
list out these directories (FILES/DIR) IF and only IF I know the name of the 
directory...how can I get a master "root" listing of ALL avaialble 
directories?  As of right now, I have to keep scrounging around until I find a 
new one (new to me) mentioned in mail or in I/O...
 
EB: yeah..send me everything you have on xray..about the node option are you 
doing it by ex: loginid:XXX..where xxx is the particualr node in 
question?...that is the only way that I know of specifing..as far as 
ASCII..hell, just buffer it in Hex and run it thruogh a connvertor ...

    As most of you know by now, Barbados is now off the network.

    Someone was mentioning things they found on Tymnet.
 
    Here's no login's with no passwords:
 
    pcinet
    alascom
    
    And of course, some public information is:
 
    dpac; 3020xxxxxxxxxx
 
    It will do some other DNICs.
 
    I have some other stuff, but I'm not too sure where I put it.  <That's 
safe.>

cna is also an acct....needs a pass though..
I find it hard to believe that since trt died ALMOST EVERYONE has stopped 
calling the chat lines (other than QSD)..god...what a bunch of incometent 
fools... shit.  I'm sure ANYONE can use fucking Pac*it plus...right?!?!

43/49: Or.

    Yes, since "trt" died everyone is gone.  A lot of those people were "MDA" 
(some Phreak groupie band in trhe midwest).
 
    I was online for two minutes last night, thanks to whoever informed me 
that the "fradical" accounts could still do it, even if they were barred from 
DNIC's, by doing the following [in case you missed it]:
 
    fradical:gDNIC;password
 
    Of course fradical is merely a made up name and has nothing to do with 
real life, or my dreams.  And DNIC is, of course, a number, and password, 
silly, that's not real either, but it sure would make life easier.

    Can an outdial dialup DNIC's?  Like normally, or for instance this is how 
I call Phoenix Project:
 
please log in: dialout:1306;password
                       ^^^^\
                            Tymnet Dialout Port
    (I use 1306 because that way Phoenix is not a long distance call, wah la).
 
    Now, if I were to do something like:
 
    dialout:g2342;password
 
    would that do anything for me.    Is there a text file that explains all 
the Tymnet little keyword/keycharacters?

yeah...you can type "information" from tymnet logon...it might be of use... 
also... the acct:gdnic method wont work for USA dnic's for some reason..i 
dunno why... it connects THROUGH USA gateways though....hmmm

There is some kinda "regulated" gateway between tymnet/telenet (and may be for 
the other nets like TRT)... I guess the only way to connect to one of those 
NUAs is to go thru that specific gateway...
