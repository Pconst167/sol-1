One night when I was terribly bored I went to the nearest payphone, dialed
0, and said, "Yes, operator TSPS maintenance, could you tell me what number
I'm coming in on." after about a seconds pause she rattled off the number
of the payphone. The odd part about this was that it was a Saturday night
about 11:00. Not too useful information but interesting. Does TSPS Maintenance
actually do test at all hours of the night??

Gee I left some messages concerning RO

Type 1 or 2 ROTL's, directly accessable
either from lineside, or (as you proba
bly are sick of hearing me say) Trunk
side from the Terminals on the Metallic
Facility (NOT SLIC or SLC!). ROTL canno
t "verify" a sub line! It has no connec
tions to lineside unless Central MTCE
for your CO is using them for such (
rarely, as it is unnecessary). ROTL's
are used by CAROT (everyone brings up
these questions now. Check back on my
messages on CAROT- If I remember I
Briefly described its connection to the
RTTU circuits, via ATME and the other
links) (Maybe the messages were before
their time?). The ROTL's are automatica
lly cycled into use by the CAROT ctrlr
and its TU connections. According to
Bell, the linelinked Dialups are only
there for manual attempts, and the 
CAROT ctrlrs are finding themselves
direct-linked to the ROTL frame.

the account that jumped to wc?
was just a defaulted account..
usually you can't do inquiries
on circuits and the like but
you probably can change dir's
to just about anything.

try a command

% cat  /etc/passwd

note that you should be on the /usr dir
to get useful results..
or use the pwd command
or Print Working Directory
you will get something like /usr/tmp

if you get "/" you're on root 
(superuser)

wish ya luck

To all users,

	Here are a few answers to your
questions.
	1) on the "osl", did it mention
"rolm" anywhere? my experience is that
that is a programmable/computer pbx
system.
	2) no matter what you try at
the prompts, you won't get an invalid
login until after all the info is
entered on a cosmos. Same thing happens
on the 817-787-1234 one i use. (call 
often, you usually can just pop into
someone elses acct)
	3) as for trw, i'll post a
different message for that. i realize
that the article in 2600 is good, but
sometimes clarity is the best thing.
	4) as for CBI, i'll relay what
i personally know. Certain floridans
have spread the word i was not to get
this. I don't know why! here, the
person who had tca2, 3319122nxk <sears

A phew things I came by in reading
some computer magazine which may be of
interest:

Some of you may have heard about
"The Instant Yellow Pages" which is a
service which lists 6 million businesses
and has about 40 people working day 
& night  entering information. Their
goal is to have every yellow page title
in the country listed.
The service costs $100.00 initially, 
and $15.00 per month PLUS $1.00 per
minute while on the system. I think 
this is rather outrageous. Anyways,
the system is located in Omaha, Nebraska.
This is all the info I have at the moment,
but I am sure someone who has more
time than I will engineer the dialup or
some other information out of them so
we will be able to attack and infiltrate
the system.

--

There is a system similar to Compuserve
called "People Link" which has a phew
different types of conferencing systems.
This system looks perfect for holding
LOD and other group conferences. They
also have a BBS type section. Since they
are relatively new to the business, compared
to CIS, there must still be a phew bugs in the
system for us to find out.

I have recently been looking into home
banking services, and it seems that
more and more large banks are getting
into the business. BANK OF AMERICA in
California has the "HomeBank" system
and has over 25,000 subscribers. Chemical
bank offers "Pronto" banking. I would
appreciate any info you have on this.

EXTRA NOTE: I WAS DOING SOME TAPPING IN AN AREA SERVED BY GTE (GENERAL TELEPHONE). DAMN, THEY HAVE A SCREWED SWITCH. IT IS THE GTD-5 EAX I GUESS, BUT IT TAKES 2 SECONDS AFTER LOOP COMPLETION FOR THE RELAY TO GIVE YOU A DIAL TONE! I HAD THE SET IN 'MONITOR', AND WHEN I LISTENED THROUGH THE TAPE RECORDER, THE LINE WAS PICKING UP A RADIO STATION! IT WASN'T ON THE RECORDER, AS IT HAS NO RADIO. EVIDENTLY, A RADIO SIGNAL WAS PRESENT ON THE LINE WHEN THE LOOP WAS CLOSED (MONITOR PICKED IT UP), AND WHEN A PERSON AT  THE SUBSCRIBER'S HOUSE PICKED UP, THE MUSIC WOULD STOP. HMM.
