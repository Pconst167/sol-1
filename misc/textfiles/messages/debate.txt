IT'S TIME TO KNOCK SOME SENSE INTO THOSE WHO ARE REGISTERED VOTERS THIS YEAR
FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.	HOW ANYBODY COULD VOTE FOR REAGAN IS BEYOND ME.
JUST LOOK AT WHAT HE'S DONE!  SINCE REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT, THERE HAVE BEEN *NO*
ARMS AGREEMENTS WITH THE SOVIET UNION.	WHEN ASKED WHY HE TURNED DOWN A TREATY
THAT THE SOVIETS AGREED TO, HE SAID "BECAUSE IF THE SOVIETS LIKE IT, THERE MUST
BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT".  HE ALSO REFERS TO THE SOVIET UNION AS THE "CENTER
OF EVIL IN THE WORLD".  REAGAN DOESN'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT THE SOVIET UNION.  HE
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THEM.  I KNOW A FAIR AMOUNT ABOUT THE SOVIETS AND THEIR
CULTURE, LANGUAGE, ETC., AND KNOW THAT THEY ARE FAR FROM THE "CENTER OF EVIL".
REAGAN PUTS WEAPONS AHEAD OF EDUCATION IN TERMS OF FUNDING/IMPORTANCE.	HE WENT
INTO LEBANON, DID NOTHING, ALLOWED SOME 300+ AMERICANS TO DIE THERE, NEEDLESSLY
AND THEN* PULLED OUT.  HE IS WELL KNOWN FOR BEING RACIST TOWARD BLACKS, HE
WANTS YOU TO BE FORCED TO PRAY IN SCHOOLS, HE DOESN'T WANT WOMEN TO HAVE A
CHOICE IN THE ABORTION ISSUE, HE MAKES TAX CUTS FAVORING THE RICH...

REAGAN IS RE-APPOINTING ANNE BURFORD!  WHAT IS HIS PROBLEM?  LOOK AT HIS
ADMINISTRATION- JAMES WATT, HAIG, AND ALL THOSE LOSERS WHO WERE SO INCOMPETANT
IT'S SICK...

PEOPLE SAY MONDALE/FERRARO IS "TOO LIBERAL".  WHAT THE HELL IS THAT SUPPOSED TO
MEAN?  TELL ME WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT THEM!  SAYING THAT THEY'RE TOO LIBERAL
IS LIKE ME SAYING OH, BUT REAGAN IS "TOO CONSERVATIVE".  THAT SAYS *NOTHING*.

TELL ME YOU LIKE WHAT REAGAN IS DOING IN CENTRAL AMERICA.  TELL ME HE'S NOT
PUTTING TOO MUCH INTO WEAPONS.	TELL ME HE'S GIVES ENOUGH MONEY TO EDUCATION.
THE ONLY PEOPLE I CAN THINK OF WHO CAN REALLY* VOTE FOR REAGAN ARE

THE ANTI-ABORTION PRO-SCHOOL PRAYER LOONIES, AND THE VERY RICH WHO DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANYONE ELSE.

Republicans may be all right, but they have some strange habits.  Consider
Ronnie who has requested and signed budgets with the highest deficit ever,
requested a constitutinal amendment requiring a balanced budget, castigated the
Democrats for the lack of such an amendment, and finaly claimed that from some
source there will be found enough money to balance next years budget without
raising taxes.	Republicans are all right.  Some of my best friends are both
dedicated to fantasy and all right.

     the views of each individual
	 --------------------

so what if your a libreal or conservative.  every human being has there own
view of the world.  it is all based on the environment where a person is born
in.  if a poor dude was born in the ghetto.  (s)he would most likely be a
libreal.  ig a rich dude wwas born to be spoiled, (he)no she)would most likely
be a conservative.

(unless your born in the archie bunkers family..it would then be totally
different)

libreal-conservative issue..

the teachers gonna by it..

as to mondales quote; "...teacher on the shuttle....thats fine, but why doesn't
he do something for the teachers and kids on earth."

doesn't he know that he can't bribe a teacher...unless they themselves have
brain damage!!!!  if he wants to do something for the teachers..he should cut
the defense budget, and train the teachers to disipline the kids..boy..if
reagan don't...we america will be third in the world..behind japan and russia..

so elect mondale and ferraro...  so we can kill the big space between the u.s.

Subj: abortion...it's legal!!!
From: FRIENDLY MAN
Date: 08-31-84 at 12:21 AM



of course, abortion is legal.  when abortion is performed, youy don't kill a
human being.  the fetus don't even have the 5 senses, or even the nervous
system of the fetus are not function able.  the fetus can't even breath.  what
do you dudes mean that abortion is murder.

many poor people have abortions is to stay away from hospital costs.  most of
them have no insurance.  even teens that have abortions have a good reason, if
they don't have the money to support a child, then why give up a life for a
child!!!!

you people that are against abortion has no right to interfer in peoples life.
the only reason that you guys are against it is that most of you will never
experence it, so if you will not experience it..so why not make others suffer.
isn't that the view that you havew when you think of anti-abortion..  to make
people suffer..

The ugliest scum-of-the-city-women crawlout from their dirt holes just to go to

Hey, you know what?  I bet you don't.  So, I just got back from First Avenue &
7th Street Entry at the all ages Replacements concert.

The crowd was made up of stiff people suffering from rigor mortis or something.
There where only like 30 people dancing at all (out of maybe 300 or more), and
only about 10 people had the nerve to slam dance, and I was the only one to
"dive" of the stage, and I didn't even dive, I ended up jumping cause all the
preppie losers who moved away!!

That concert was NOTHING like the Suburbs.  What a drag.  The Replacements were
alright though.

And I asked all the bartenders and managers if they knew Apple Avenger (his
real name though), and none of them did, even though he said he was working
there.	hmmmmm.

Well, off to a party if I can get over there...
