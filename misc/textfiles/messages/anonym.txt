Ok all, this board was cleared to make room for a new board, and I am not sure
if the subject of it is a secret or not, so just leave it dead until the mighty
Manager gets around to changing the title and clearing the previous messages...

Later all.

Hi folks,
   Update from good ol' California....

Anyone here heard of the death squad????  Me and the rest of the 'good' hackers
are after them...  they've crashed too many boards to let 'em get away.
Actually, we're trying to enforce "Honor among Theives" but what the fuck!!!!

   Call the Ghost ship and send mail to THE HABERDASH!!!!!

It's a crappy system, but what the hell?!!!!!  Oh, one more thing call BYTE
BANDITS in cambell (you can slander Haberdick there too...)

     What's that? You want Phone Numbers? oh,

	The Ghost ship			   Byte bandits
	 408-259-7194			   408-374-3974


Anyways, this has been one hell of a waste of disk space so I think I'll kind
of end it right here!!!!!

I JUST HAVE ONE THING TO SAY.  THE BOARD WAS NOT THAT BAD AND THE SYSOP WAS A
NICE GUY.  I AM NOT TRYING TO PUT ANYONE OR ANYTHING DOWN, BUT THE SYSOP IS NOT
A KID!	HOWEVER JUST BECAUSE HE IS A LITTLE RASH IN PIRATE USERS ON THE BOARD.
THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF HIS ADULT STATUS HE CAN GET TAXE VERY HARD.
