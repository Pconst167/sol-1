he is a antheist, I AM not going to pray to him.  Also if he prays to someone
higher, that means he isnt God.  So think about that..

Just a few minutes ago, a strange thought hit me.  Titles on boards like this
are not only completely useless, but also quite unecessary.

Whenever a title is contemplated, by me, that has any purpose or meaning
what-so-ever, it is immediately rejected by, shall we say, this cheap (no:
inexpensive is a better adjective) software.

You shall also notice that the above sentence was quite lengthy.  However, if
you have an intelligence level higher than that of an orange golf ball, you
probably understood it without much pondering.	This goes to show that my
grammatical correctness is indeed superior.  That is not to say it is good,
contrary to popular belief.

that you are auto-dialing it for 3 hours.  This bbs is not here, hence these
messages and users are not here.  That also means that Computer Courier is not
here and hence it was never written and Apple Bandit is not selling it.

And if BBS'es arn't here that means pirating is not here and there is not such

DO you actaully think that mondale is going to make it into the whitehouse?  no
way!  that milk sap cant even do stuff right.  Reagan has pulled the economy
around and saved everyone there jobs.  If we still had jerk off jimmy in there
we would be in the worst depersion since 1930's and I dont think anyone* on
this bbs remebers that at all.

About the missles.  I am agaist them but I understand why we need them.  It is
stupied to think off the soviets and american techs climbing up on ladders and
tearing the shit out of there missles.	We have them to prove that we are the
strongest, that we take no* shit from no one.  I dont think us or the soviets
are stupied enough to use them but a jerk like khomeni will use on if he gets
it.  What I say is this, accept what is happening but look for a new and better
way to defend ourselves.  you people want to rip everything down and leave us
defenceless, well first develop something better than nukes and then take the
nukes down.  I dont see what you are worrying about, a milli second of a flash

 reagan is stupid.

a) he acts likes a wimp on tv b) half of his staff has left in disgrace c) his
ideas come from post-world war ][ anti-ruskie excitement d) he is an actor but
not an intelect

 destruction is imminent

a) president reagan and russian leaders are on the same mind level and are the
same age, therefore his problem of shortsightedness is compounded with russian
ideals.  b) up until now (election time) he has been preaching about mx,
'winnable nuclear war'.  etc.  c) foriegn relations have been deteriorating.


a couple of things to note:

 -19 & 20 year-olds: this guy wants to
  take away your booze.
 -time and not reagan has brought us
  out of this past economic crisis as
  with all economic crises in u.s.
  history***. furthermore, at a time
  when business should be booming,
  construction is on the downfall
  again.

to all reagan people:

  you believe in this guy because:

a) your parents are too old.
b) your parents are very rich and
   stingy.
c) you like his movies.

i welcome any mail on this subject, because i think this board is getting too
cluttered with things like this.

Tim,

if you knew your ass from a hole in the ground you would know that if you are
19 and 20 already then 21 year old drinking age does not apply to you.	it
applys to the youngsters who havent turned 19 yet (like if you have noticed you
keep your provisional license till you are 19).  it isnt ronnie who is making
the law it is your* senators and the damn MADD (mothers agaist drunk drivers)
who are making this bill go through the senate and the house.  also a state
can* boycott the bill but all that means is they get less of the feds money for
the highways.  Also, if we still had carter in office we would either 1) be at
war 2) be nuked by now 3) be really f*cken broke.  SO I suggest you look over
your facts before you open your mouth.	Also, I believe that we will have
another 4 more years of ronnie buddy.  Mondale is a whimp and all the other
jerks are just as bad as he is.  But enough of this, lets start some serious

come to think of it, it would be nice if reagan got elected:

according to the 20 year cycle of presidential deaths, he would be knocked off
in office.

mr.  avenger, i have no major quarrel with you,

but, i fail to see any proof in carter giving a nuclear war or taking one.

ron here, is the one for the $200 bil.	defense budget, mx, & crap.

 was ike a bad president?

before you answer, consider there was a major economic crisis in 1957.	ike is
even on our money!

(my point is that a president serving through a crisis that is bound to happen,
shouldn't get crap for it.

reagan, being the know-nothing that he is usually doesn't do anything, except
sign things and ride horses.  his advisors do all the work.  for instance,
david stockman obviously has more control over the economy than reagan.  (he is
a carry-over from carter)

if you want to get subtle over the drinking thing, reagan has a big part in
whether this becomes law.  i don't care who doesn't get to drink, it's just
that for one, he is just following congress with out a viewpoint of his own (it
might hurt his brain) as he always does, and another is that he is not
disputing whether the national government has a right to do this.  (another
case of this was 'his' prayer in the school folly just a while ago.  he didn't
have any knowledge of what he was doing or he probably would have dropped it in
the first place) i beleive this guy is starting to worry about whether his
constituency is beginning to see through him, so he is going after moral issues
(although now he is more into talking about talking with the u.s.s.r.  i don't
think mondale is a great leader, i think he's a jerk.  vote hart!

I, myself, plan to for for Reagan and the GLOP becauseOP, because I
belive that Reagan has the right idea for population control.  I mean, what
could be better for population control then a full-scale nuclear war with the
Soviets?  And at this rate we sure seem to be heading that way!  I urge all of
you reading this to write letters to Reagan and whatzisface in Russia, urging
them to nuke each other at the next opportunity!  Just think, 1/2 of the
Earth's population wiped out in less then a half hour!  This would end food

If you are a lone lumberjack in the forest, and you cut down a tree, and it
falls on top of you and you die:  Did it make a sound?

Pretty awesome.  Written by two very famous shrinks.
I just tested my recallation and by my percentage was 59.9%

how many hotdogs are in a regular pack
or
how many matches are in a average pack
or

An interesting book, also a room on a private board called "Citadel".  This
topic is quite complex, but interesting as well.  Pick up the book.

Because of over population in the computer tele-communication systems, there
seems to be many alias that are being used a lot. The most popluar alias is
Grim Reaper. I know of 5 Grim Reapers in this country, Could be more. We need
creative minds for alias, no Dr. ??? or you know. Use something that nobody
wil ever think of. Maybe

The Cat skinner
Islambu Kalismari
Cow droppings
Great Alias
The Unfriendly Man
Pencil Biter.

Use an alias that fits you, not anything like Happy Hacker when you have never
phreaked or hacked before. Never use the word crack in your name if you never
cracked a protected game before( If you use pirates sign. to modify stuff,
that don't count)


There should be a contest for the most creative alias in this country, th n
maybe this alias prob will be fixed.

Me Friendly Man cause I'm such a nice
Guy! If not  _blank_ off!

Whaddya mean, no Dr. xxxxx? I happen to be proud of my ORIGINAL alias, which
does contain a Dr. Would you prefer Mr. Discord, Lord Discord, or maybe King
Discord? I thought not.

Oh well, had to get that out. Use "Dr." in your alias if it goes good with the
last name.

Doc/High Lords or Revelstone
Troublemakers
