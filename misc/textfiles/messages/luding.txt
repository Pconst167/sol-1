"i am going to lude southdale", he says holding his head high and gazing some-
where over the horizon...

"no, please, don't do it", she cries, "you're young and have such a promising
future, why must you flirt with disaster like that?...."

deep down inside he knew he had to do it...  there was no real choice.	but he
was torn between the two great loves.  there was she, crying at his knees, and
there was the all-consuming passion for luding burning deep within him....

......and as she clings to his pant leg, he looks endlessly into the sky, to
him its challenging, to her its dangerous. When he looks at the rope that cries
for him, and also at the woman of his life, he ask's himself, "is it worth it,
falling to an endless death"? But he also looks at the other side, it is a
glory that no other man could feel. Just then he decides, he goes for the rope,
he pushes her aside, and walks toward the giant that touches the clouds. As he
is ready to grab the rope, his only love screams........?

...he wavers for a moment, thinking of sherking his resposibility.  Then he
know what meus be done, he must lude Southdale, its in his destiny.  He bravely
grabs the lude rope screaming that he must be King of the luders.  As he is
abou to break the reacord on one of the most dangerous ludes ever he hears a
scream.  It's the lady he longs to be near the rest of his life.  Upon hearing
this scream he looks up and sees.....

AS HIS FEET LEAVE THE CONCRETE EDGE OF THE SOUTHDALE LUDITORIUM, HE REALIZES
HIS HORRIBLE MISTAKE!  COULD IT BE TRUE THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 'SWISH-
SWISH' OF LITTLE LUDERS AROUND THE HOUSE (ESPECIALLY AFTER THAT GONAL STRADDLE
BACK IN '82!)

IN ONE LAST DESPERATE DISPLAY OF SELF-CONTROL, HE LASHES HIS ARM (THE ONE NOT
IN THE OFFICIAL AIR-FORCE 'WILD BILL' DEATH GRIP) AROUNG THE LUDE-PIN AND PULLS
HIMSELF AGAINST THE 'TOWER OF POWER'.  THERE, HEARING HER WEEPING OVER THE HOWL
OF THE WIND, HE TRIES TO PULL HIMSELF UPWARD, FINGERS CLAWING THE CONCRETE
RETAINING WALL, FINGER- NAILS PEELING BACK LIKE WET DECALS, BUT HE COULDN'T
LUDE, NOT NOW, NOT LIKE THIS....

ANYONE WHO CAN FIND A LUDE POLE THAT IS BETTER THAN V.A.  SHOULD WIN *TWO*
NIBBLE MAGAZINES...  I PROBABLY HAVE ONE FROM 1982 OR THEREABOUTS...

SERIOUSLY, IF ANYONE CAN FIND SUCH A POLE, I THINK THEY DESERVE A T-SHIRT THAT
SAYS "I FOUND THE AWESOME LUDE POLE" OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.  MAYBE THE
FIRST Lude CREW T-SHIRT OR A PAIR OF LUDE GLOVES.
