From: LORD FOUL
Date: 05-19-84 at 01:15 AM

As a long-time trekkie (treker again for Crackon) I've noticed a few things
about the series:

Most used phrase (besides "Kirk to Enterprise")..."He's dead, Jim"

Also, whenever there was a landing party (and there usually was), it was
interesting to count the dead before they died.  When was the last time you saw
a "red shirt" survive a landing party?  Talk about expendable..

Trivia (one question):	Behind the control panel Sulu and Chekov used, there
was a circular object that looked like a radar.  Whaty was it's function?
Hint:  Not a radar.

I need warp drive in four minutes or we're all dead...

etc steal the enterprise (which is still shot up from the fight with Khan) to

AA, You may have a good idea for the next Star Trek movie:

SULU:	Captain, I'm tracking an unknown object, but it keeps fading in and out
	of my screen.
KIRK:	Analysis Mr. Spock?
SPOCK:	Insufficient data to draw a conclusion at this time Captain.

(Kirk thinks:screw the logic Spock, what is it?)

KIRK:	Put it on visual when it comes back on scanners.
SULU:	Aye,aye, captain.
CHEKOV: Captain, there it is. It, it looks like a storage box.
SPOCK:	It is, in actuality, a police box dating from the early 20th century.
KIRK:	It's gone again.

(a high pitched whine is heard on the bridge and the police box is blocking the
exit)

KIRK:	Phasers on stun.

(the door of the police box opens and out steps a man in a coat with a very
long scarf draped around his neck)

DOCTOR: Would anybody care for a Jelly Baby?

Well, what do you think folks?...
Imagine Spock's reaction to this highly illogical creature...
Can't you see The Doctor and Kirk discussing 20th century Earth?...


OK, enough of that, here's an interesting bit of trivia:

I think it was during the filming of the first movie (not too important) that
this happened.	Sulu and Checkov in their years of work on the show had, in
their mind decided what each button on the control panel was for.  When the new
director told Sulu to press a button he said,"No, that one blows the ship up!"

Well, Avenger, I would like to see a list of all the episode titles, and a
short description of each episode, in checklist form, so I know which ones I
haven't seen...

Lets see...  I have a question.  Spock and the rest of the Vulcans have no
emotions.  According to one episode, a guy named Cerak was the founder of the
peace/no emotion social system; according to another episode, Vulcan at one
time was warlike.  My question is, is the no emotion thing just behavioral or
is it inborn.  Yet another episode, Spock was forced emotions, and Bones said
he would die.  This would imply that he physically could not have emotions, but
at one time they did...  I know that did not make too much sense, but someone,
please attempt to clarify...

I would like to know all the characters' full name and job and place of origin,
ect...

Here's some TRIVIA:

1) Name the only actor ever to play a Vulcan, a Romulan, and a Klingon.
2) What prop from "Where No Man Has Gone Before" was listed in the Writers'
   Guide during the whole run of the series, but was never used again?
3) What is the name of McCoy's daughter?
4) What is the only line that Uhura says during "The Corbomite Manuever"? (She
   says it 5 times!)

Let's see if you guys out there can answer these questions!

I think Mark Leonard was the actor to play a Vulcan, Romulan, and a KLingon.
Warp 1 is the speed of light. Warp 2 is 2 times the speed of light. Warp 3
is 2 times Warp 2 or 4 time the speed of light. Warp 4 is 2 times Warp 2 or
8 times the speed of light, etc..........................................

THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD, BUT THERE WAS NO DR.MCCOY, LT.  SULU WAS *NOT AT THE
HELM, NO MR CHECKOV, INSTEAD IT WAS LT.  KELSO.

THEY PROCEEDED TO THE EDGE OF THE GALAXY, THEY BURNED OUT MOST EVERYTHING WHEN
THEY TRIED TO GO THROUGH, TO PEOPLE WERE ELECTRICUTED AND THERE ESP POWERS WERE
MAGNIFIED GREATLY.  THEY PROCEEDED TO DELTA VEGA...YOU KNOW THE REST.

I WISH I COULD REMEMBER THE PEOPLES NAMES.  INSTEAD OF MCCOY THEY HAD AN OLD
GUY, I DONT REMEMBER WHO HE WAS.

Well, the answer to that question would be 'The Trouble With Tribbles,' one of
the most classic 'Trek episodes ever done.  If you looked closely in the bar in
Star Trek III (ST3:TSFS), there were some tribbles on a table.	These little
critters like to multiply like mad!
