The front doors are opened but the sign above the door says keep out.

Staying in a coffin type hotel called "The Vampires Live Better"
Late in the night see woke up to a thud next door.  When see peeked out her 
door, she saw this Gigantic man with a steel spear raised to plunge into the 
chest of a much smaller man, who stood with a cyberdeck in his left arm.  The 
smaller man was cowering in fear, and the room behind his looked like it was 
on fire.

I a previously deleted post, Leesan poke her head out of her room and threw 
one of her poisoned daggers at the man, then ducked back in and barracades the 
door  <With the bed, as it is the only things and there are no locks here>

Just as she closed the door, she noticed the dagger only made a glancing blow 
as her partially dodged out of the way.

    She waits near the doorway - listening for the sounds of the fight and 
silence. she is also waiting to here the thud of the big man's body as the 
poison does it's work and he falls to the ground. she has her gun out - and is 
really to shoot should anyone attempt to open the door.

What leesan here is a thud, but it isn't the thud of a body hitting the 
ground, sounds more like that spear hit something.  and the wall shakes a 
little.

There are no more sounds outside here door for 15 minutes.

    does not want to open the door - so she looks around the room to see if 
there are any holes that she can look out to see what's going out. if there 
are none, she checks to see if she has the equipment needed to make a 
peep-hole to look out of.

A vibrobalde can cut through just about anything, the only problem is that it 

    probably not. i guess from that that there aren't any peepholes in the 
room. o.k. this calls for plan b - (now if only i knew what that was). o.k. 
leesan walks cautiously over to the door, moves the bed about an inch away 
from the door. she then sits quietly for a while to see if there are any 
further noises in the hallway. she has her gun out - aimed at the door, and 
would shoot immediately at anyone who attempted to open it.

She hears a soft moaning, then... nothing, the sound has stopped.

shown that 6 forms can arrise: 1. Appearance of an elf  2. Elf 
appearance/psionic aptitude  3. troll like appearance and mentality   4. 
stunted growth <dwarf> normally what happens when affects children.  5. The 
being melts away  6. the person dies due to shock during the mutation

4) The description fo an alien race that one corporation has underobservation  
<the coroporation is not specified in the article)

5) Blowtorch level 15

6) Tech House Mortar Level 10

you dive down into the blackish, brackish water just as the gunfire ignite the 
air.  the fireburst singes your back before you are completely convered and 
the pain is pretty unbearable.  You swim as abley as you can through the 
almost opaque sewage water and pop you head up a little later.  You are not 
certain where you are though

up in (whatever city this is going on 
in, I forget)...  I got some training 
in martial arts when I was 21...  I 
really enjoy fixing things, in fact, 
it's almost a habit... If I find 
something broken, I will probably try 
to fix it.

is currently is a sleazy dump by the name of Vampire's live better.  He spent 
his last $5 on a room for the night.  The coffin is still filled with the 
cinder's of what was probably the last bed, and the comm link is destroyed.  
However you have the added attraction of a man impaled on your door, which the 
the local body banks refuse to accept due to its rather burned nature.
