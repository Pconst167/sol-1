The lines *ARE* bad so make sure you get there early!  I don't agree with the
first review because I think it is *SO* awesome!  Yes!	I loved every momen't
of it...(sept the snake sur- prise) [you'll see].  Anyways...I give this movie
a 10!  Go see it now!  It's worth the money!

p.s.  A.A, want to get a crew together to see Star Trek III????

From: St. Paul c64 & IBM
Date: 06-04-84 at 11:38 AM

trekkies, don't waste your money -- the search for spock is boring, not really
believable, and by far the worst of the three.	the only high point is seeing
christopher lloyd ('jim' from taxi) dressed up in monster makeup and costume,
still talking like a spaced druggie.  score now:  1 for 3 on trek dreck -- only
the wrath of kahn was any good!

To the above ruggie:


I found that Star Trek /// was far the best* of all of them. Star Trek / was to
much special effects and no story. Star Trek // was great, but the ending was
stupied (play 'amazing grace' at spocks funeraul was stupied!). I found star
trek /// at times boring, but the actors got to play the roles as they wanted.
The other 2 movies the directors ran the characters. Star trek /// was more for
the characters and the people that play them.

The movie gave us a new way to think about star trek. Is it totally over for
the entire crew? Will they get a new enterprise? Will spock fully return to us?
This we will never know or maybe we will soon know because paramount studios is
talking about star trek ////.

From: THE SPLITTER
Date: 06-09-84 at 11:01 AM

I WENT TO SEE THE MOVIE, "GREMLINS", YESTERDAY AND IT WAS GREAT!  I THINK THAT
THIS MOVIE WAS AT LEAST 10 TIMES BETTER THAN E.T.  THE MOVIE IS ABOUT THIS KID
WHO GETS A GREMLIN FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT.  THERE ARE 3 THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE
CAREFUL ABOUT GREMLINS:  (1) DON'T GET THEM WET (2) DON'T FEED THEM AFTER
MIDNIGHT (3) I DON'T REMEMBER THE OTHER ONE!  OH YA!  THEY DIE IF THEY ARE IN
BRIGHT LIGHT.  YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS COULD TURN INTO AN INTERESTING MOVIE,
ESPECIALLY IF THEY ACCIDENTLY GOT WET....OR ACCIDENTALLY WERE FED AFTER
MIDNIGHT!  I RATE THIS MOVIE AN "A".  ONE LAST NOTE...IF YOU GET THEM WET, THEN
THEY REPRODUCE!

Ooh.  That makes me mad.  I finally decided to get off my ass and go se Streets

Did anyone see this movie?  Was it good?  Will it ever be in Stereo on cable?
It damn well better be.

Subj: THE LAST STARFIGHTER
From: THUFIR HAWAT
Date: 07-23-84 at 11:13 PM

Or at least let's hope it's the "last" starfighter, the ending leaves it wide
open for a sequel.  The plot for this movie was horrible.  It was a
not-too-original blend of Star Wars,Close Encounters, and E.T. and you could
tell.  This movie is certainly not worth $4.50. The only thing that saves this
movie is the computer graphics which are FANTASTIC.  If you go, don't expect
too much from the movie.  Go for the computer graphics.  Unfortunately, the
compter graphic segments are too far between to make it a worthwile movie.

From: THE BARNSTORMER
Date: 08-07-84 at 03:25 PM

Paul, you really shouldn't have to ask for a review of Ghostbusters.  It has
every element for an excellent movie.  Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, and good
special effects.  Anyway here goes:

   Ghostbusters is a movie about three guys who go into busines for themselves
catching and storing troublesome ghosts in New York city.  When the city is
threatened by a ghost takeover it's the Ghostbusters to the rescue.  I can't
realy say much more without giving away some of the really funny parts.  Go see
it, it is one of the best movies of the year.  Bill Murray is hillarious.  He's
the greatest.

Not necessarily lator,

1 JOINT MEANS THE MOVIE IS GREAT BUT HAS SOME PROBLEMS
2 JOINTS MEANS THE MOVIE IS OK BUT YOU MUST BE IN A GOOD STATE OF MIND
3 JOINTS MEANS THE MOVIE IS REALLY BAD AND YOU SHOULD NOT SEE IT UNTIL IT COMES
OUT ON CABLE.

Star Trek 3: a one joint movie, to help with the special effects.

Revenge of the Nerds:4 don't waste your money, will be on cable very soon!!
Gremlins:2 joint movie, don't be too stoned some scenes are to intense.
Red Dawn: Haven't seen that yet either. I am guessing a 3 joint movie or 2 to
hard to tell. Depends on quality of film
Purple Rain: 1 joint movie to really appreciete Prince's music..

Ok that is the system, of course each person has thier own tolerance level.

THIS MOVIE SUCKED!  NOT ONLY DID THE WRITERS STEAL PLOT LINES FROM "CLOSE

THE ACTING WAS JUST AWFUL.  ANYWAY, THRU THE WHOLE MOVIE YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW

END.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  DO NOT GO SEE "THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT"..

I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS PRETTY GOOD.  A LITTLE PHONY AT TIMES, BUT STILL
RELATIVELY GOOD.  IT STARS HENRY THOMAS AS DAVEY OSBORNE, A PRECOCIOUS LITTLE
KID OBSESSED WITH GAMES; AND DABNEY COLEMAN IN A DUAL ROLE AS "JACK FLAK", AN
IMAGINARY SECRET AGENT, AND DAVEY'S FATHER.

WELL, THE ACTION BEGINS WHEN DAVEY IS HANDED A "CLOAK & DAGGER" ATARI CARTRIDGE
(CONTAINING SECRET PLANS) BY A DYING MAN BEING PURSUED BY THE SINISTER SECRET
AGENTS.  ANYWAY, THEY CHASE DAVEY THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE, AS DAVEY TURNS TO
JACK FLAK FOR ADVICE.  WELL, I WON'T GIVE OUT THE END; WHICH WASN'T TOO
SUSPENSEFUL ANYWAY, BUT I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT MOVIES
EVER GIVEN A PG RATING.  HOW THIS FILM ESCAPED THE DREADED 'PG-13' I DON'T
KNOW..	BUT SEE IT FOR YOURSELF AND FIND OUT.  "CLOAK & DAGGER" IS A WORTHWHILE

DREAM.	WELL THE ACTION PICKS UP WHEN WE LEARN THAT THE DREAMSCAPE PROJECT IS

Well, I saw "Dune" last night and it was pretty good..  The special effects are
terrific and the story is quite faithful to the original text by Frank Herbert.
Newcomer Kyle MacLachlan is convincing in the role of Paul Atreides the Kwisatz
Haderach..  and Sting comes off the screen as a very stylish villain.  Some
other cast members include:  Jose Ferrer as the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV,
and Kenneth McMillan as the vile and disgusting Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.
Anyway, the movie was good, so I'd recommend seeing it..
