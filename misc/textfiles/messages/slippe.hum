  Good, Good, Great D.S. why not use b00g as a universal advective and 
fill-word to cover that fact that you don't knmow what's going on. 

  86Apr29 23:46 from Tom Hackerman
  So what is going on?

Like the smurfs using the word smurf in place of real words? 

  86Apr30 14:16 from Dirk Stanley
Ha! But I DO know what's going on! Don't forget, it's 1986, and Big Brother is 
STILL watching! Until he stops, though, we should work on finding Captain 
Goodnight!!

     What's with thes Captain Middrift? I feel like a TURNIP, and I feel HAPPY! 
When everyone sits down and thinks about it, we set  things on fire with our 
minds. Don't tell ME what a Scrimp is, I KNOW... Or at least I think I think I 
want to think that when I think I'm sure that I'm positive I know....

  86May04 19:27 from Gimly Gnarly
OK, I have a few questions I would like answered: 
  1) Why does the word 'schleggilemelch' 
   seem to have some deep, inner meaning 
   (most probably sexual) that I can't 
   find. 2) How does one go about starting one's 
   own religion (based on finding out 
   the secret of the schleggilemelch) 3) Is it true that the Ayatollah 
screams 
   out 'schleggilemelch' during orgasam? 4) Why can't I think of the other 3 
   fucking questions based on that word 
    we've all come to know and love: 
  
           SCHLEGGILEMELCH 
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
  Hmmmm, well I hope someone can answer this... 
           Gim. 

  86May04 20:29 from Tom Hackerman
  Well you sure picked the right room... 

  86May05 13:34 from Milo Phonbil
That's "Schlegelmilch" anyway, and transliterated from German, it means "milk 
of the Schlegel". 
 Besides that, I can only think of the famous mobile home manufacturer... 

  86May06 19:54 from Gimly Gnarly
Very good Milo. Hmmmm, so now lets see if we can  get one. 
  By the way: 
  Why do people TAKE a shit instead of LEAVING one? 
  Why do you have to PAY to use a  FREEWAY? 
  Why do you DRIVE on a PARKWAY and  PARK on a DRIVEWAY? 
  Its a mad,mad,mad,mad world....

Or do we REALLY know that the earth rotates around the sun? Maybe the sun and 
all of the other planets rotate around the earth!     
   Or who is the guy who stamps the little "m"'s on the m&m's??    
   Or who counts to make sure that there are an average of 16 chocolate chips 
in every Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookie?      
   
 J'ever think about them?

Who looks inside band-aid packages to make sure they are sterile? Also, what's 
the point of guarenteeing sterility until you open it if you must open it to 
use it?

  Jeezuz! Have you all gone MAD!!!?![D 
  
    The ONLY way to validatie one's existence is with a fucking ICE PICK! 
(Gaddamn Ice pick, does better than I do) and the ONLY way to destroy 
communism is with Waldbaum's on your side. With Waldbaum's on your side the 
world is a fucking PANCAKE!

    Did you ever notice that floppy disks are hardly "Floppy"? 
   
    And did you ever notice that Magic Markers generally don't have any traits 
that would indicate myticism in them?

Well, I smashed a mailbox, and it did absolutly nothing. 

  86May08 10:08 from Milo Phonbil
 I'd rather they put the wrappers for soda straws on the INSIDE, because 
that's the only part I'm going to be using anyway...

Defeat text formatting? Why... Hmmm... Don't you have to defy the theory of 
cubism and three-dimensional space to do that?

  86May15  1:01 from Ed Hollywood
    How?  How do you defeat Text-formatting? 

  86May15  1:04 from Ed Hollywood
    Hay... How did I get in here? 

  86May15  1:59 from The Datamaster
You simply do not use text formatting, and let the BBS do the work. 
  Which is what you are supposed to do in the first place.
