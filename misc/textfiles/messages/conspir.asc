HACKER: We should work to make America great again, etc. etc.
 
ME: Sure...  there are good reasons why we work, and none of them have to do
with making America great... what they have to do with is the formation of a
circle of Capitalism and dependence on income that forces people to work in
order to get money to buy the things that they "need".  And who benefits from
the fact that people everywhere find themselves forced to work as a
Wage-Slave?

Not if it was fairly fast acting...

Perhaps this is why they're always telling us not to drink the water abroad.

 Ah...........  I guess that if you taint the water with chemicals, you are
affecting nearly every single beverage that includes water in some portion
(and most foods as well...)  Perhaps the clouds are seeded with this same
chemical.. then it wouldn't matter if a person went out of "range"  :)

Try a simple old activated carbon filter.  Plus the fact that the water
has chlorine or chloramine added to it.  This may react with the
LSD & break it down.  Now if you can get it in past the purification
step........  Ahhh,  You'd need a hell of a lot to get the right
concentration.  Waste of some good dope.

 Heh...I had forgotten all about that thing.  How exactly is one supposed to
tell if there's a tap on the phone by the tones it gives?  I used to know how
these things were supposed to work but I seem to have forgotten.

Its in the number of tones returned when you call....

I had the most interesting phone call today. Some woman claiming to have 
gotten my address & phone number from city hall called to complain that my 
other BBS node was prankdialing her in the wee hours of the morning.

Subsequent investigation of her claims that she had reported this 
"harrassment" to both the phone company & the police proved false...

I began to grow suspiscious of her when she started asking if I knew people in
Edison/Metuchean or who worked at Community Memorial Hospital... she also 
asked me what I did for a living and if I was from the south...

From the way that she used my mother's name (whom the phonelines here are 
registered to), it was obvious that she'd either trashed the place or had 
gotten info direct from the phone company.

All in all, it was pretty amusing. :)

How many tones indicates a tap?
Where does this number come from?

I have this really far out suspiscion, but I can't prove it yet. I'll make a 
few "discreet" inquiries of my own before I go making accusations.

Actually, I have 2 really far out suspiscions. One of them simply ranks far 
higher than the other.
