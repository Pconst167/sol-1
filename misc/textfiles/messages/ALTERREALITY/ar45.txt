Here's a message for you...
This is a true story of something that happened to my sister in PA.
 
When Robin took her car in for servicing, the mechanic found a mouse's 
nest made of dog kibble, dog hair,and bird seed in the air filter.
Here's the wierd part...
The only access to the air filter that the mouse had was through a hose!

The AK is really a lousy weapon, too heavy, not that accurate, and
you need a truck to carry any quantity of ammo. 'Twas designed by
socialist engineers for combat, which should adaquatly describe it
oops, it's suitability as a hunting weapon. Perhaps collectors have
a reason for buying an AK, but any real hunter knows you would get
more bang for your buck (a better weapon for less money) sticking
with a Marlin or similar rifle.

The AK-47 workalikes in this country (they aren't AK-47's, which *are*
full-auto weapons; they're generally Chinese clones or AK-47's that have
been modified for semi-auto-only) are not good hunting weapons. They are
too light caliber for hunting things like deer or elk, and they're not
as accurate as, say, a .30-06 or a similar rifle you'd more normally
think of as a hunting rifle. They are, on the other hand, very good for
assaulting people (fancy that--could be because that's what they're
designed for). They're faster than anyone needs a hunting rifle to be,
and the extended clip is a telling feature--you don't need 30-round
clips when you're hunting deer because if you miss with the first couple
of shots it's gonna be a while before you're in range again. I don't
really think the citizens of this country are going to find themselves
trapped in an opressive totalitarian regime just because they can't buy
assault rifles, arguments about "it's a HUNTING rifle, honest!"
notwithstanding.
 
Tell me...would an AK-47 be YOUR first choice if you were going after
a prize buck?

Drag racing is a TYPE of strip racing. Strip racing is just that--racing
on a strip, in a formal setting. Drag racing, ET racing, and the like
are all forms of strip racing. (Actually, there's about a dozen
differrent types, but I don't feel like getting into it...)

Well, it sure sems like it, although it also seems that it's a rather
unseemly thing to do--coming apart at the seams in public. Seems to me
you wanna pull yourself together. Perhaps if you really feel like you're
coming unhinged what you need to do is find the doorway to your inner
self--self-discovery is the key. Just stick with it and you'll stop
coming unglued in no time.

I dunno if Tyler has Akira or not...he said at one point he could get
it, but that's all I've heard. Of the ST:TNG episodes: well, my favorite
is "Yesterday's Enterprise," but bring 'em if you want.

You put fifteen hundred lights on one Christmas tree???!!! Damn, dude!
Now I'm gonna have to put a similar amount of candlepower on OUR tree
just so I don't feel left behind. Hmm...I only got a couple of lights,
but one of them's two hundred thousand candlepower...and I got half a
case of these really nifty twelve-volt floodlights upstairs in th
attic... :)

Good luck finding Akira. I don't think the English version has been
released yet, and when it is it probably won't be at your local
Blockbuster. The Japanese version is available through some comics
stores and the like, but it's hardly mainstream material...

A rutabaga (that's the real spelling) is a large, rock-hard
vegetable that no sane person would ever want to eat, but they sell
'em in grocery stores anyway. Don't run over one with your car; you'll
hurt the car...

   Last time I checked, you ate meat. Just curious: what's the 
difference between butchering and hunting according to your morals?
Even if butchering weren't for "fun," most of the deer hunts I've
heard of wound up eating the venison.

Thumper One and Max --
   I disagree with you. I once lived out in the "wilds of Florida," in
a tiny town called Loxahatchee. There were at least three species of
poisonous snakes on my property. 
   At least ten poisonous snakes were shot on my property. Snakes bit
my dogs three times (at least); they were found in my pool and my
shower. They weren't killed for food or for fun; they were killed for
safety's sake.

though.  I got it through work, a direct factory order.  The one I got 
we don't even sell.  Its a top of the line model, but thats nebulous,

   (One thing I love about BBS's: you not only can't tell the skin
color on the board; there's very little about the outside of a person
that you CAN tell from these messages. Just what counts: what's on the
inside.)
   I'd love to hear their reasoning about that idea: that artists are
censored because of the color of their skin. First of all, who (or
what) are trying to keep them from exhibiting their work? Secondly,
how do they know the color of the artist's skin at all? Third, how
do they know one has to do with the other?

   A dragonfly buzzed merrily by as the Turtle and the Quaid (not quite
sure WHAT a Quaid exactly is, but assuming it has appendages suitable
for pummeling with) pummelled Thumper One.
   Dragonfly: What are you doing?
   Turtle: We are pummeling this Thumper One, for he has predicted the
       End of Bank America.
   Thumper One: Leave me here to be pummelled, O wise dragonfly! For I
       am lost! But, O dragonfly, save my bass!
   With this, the dragonfly looked and lo! There was a bass! Buzzed the 
dragonfly to the bass swiftly, but lo! he could not move it. And all
marvelled at the Olde Englishe in which the dragonfly began writing.
   Switching back to Modern English, the dragonfly said a quick "pardon
me," and tripled his size. Unhindered by the square-cube laws, he 
quickly picked up the still-heavy bass and began flying away with it.

up when they see them. The time when I can point out tom my own 
kids just how rediculous business can make a joyful time appear. Time
for me (us?) to examine our roots and discover the bonds between us
and our heritage and relatives that has been erroded away during a year
of doing battle against the system. A time to look at where I am and
decide if I want to change course or keep straight ahaead. A time to
sit back and be thankful (just thankful, not necessarily towards any
religious symbol), just thankful for my kids, my health and my whole
family. Sure, business has taken a religious holiday and made it a sales
event, but they haven't taken away the REAL things that come from the
holiday...and they have only the religious extent that each of us
individually give it.

grow them yourself.)
 
      Herbal Endeavours
      3618 S. Emmons Ave.

      $2.00 catalog (refundable with your first purchase)
                            
  Also get the book, "Incense, Oils, and Brews" by scott cunningham at
most waldenbooks. It has good info on how to find or buy some of the 
harder to find herbs in its appendix. (but you have to ignore the 
mystical overtones, its one of those Metaphysical Books.)

>>More likely the result of a Copy Guard or something....
Actually I've seen that result from both bad copies AND Copy Guards.  
And Copy Guards are easy to break.  It can be done in a coupla ways:
   1. Digitize the signal.
   2. Purchase a copy guard 'buster'
Results are usually satisfactory.  Unless you're an audio/videophile who
will settle for nothing less than a perfect copy.  Which is practically 
impossible to get without some pretty expensive equipment.

   There was one huge difference between the movies: Life of Brian did
NOT claim that Brian was Jesus. In fact, Jesus showed up twice within
Life of Brian.
   Life of Brian was parodying the Church; not Christianity. And a

   When Pablo talked about 'artists,' I wasn't thinking about performing
artists. Considering the ONLY artist mentioned was not a member of
2 Live Crew, I was thinking about exhibiting artists.

What software are you using? If you're not going Fido and you're not
using a really pathetic excuse for a BBS package (Opus, say), 30
megs will be more than you could ever use. This system's message base
is on one 720K floppy disk, amnd has room for over a thousand messages.

The following software packages for MS-DOS are free or very cheap
ShareWare: Opus (free), RemoteAccess (shareware, I think the
registration fee is $35), QuickBBS (shareware), Wildcat (shareware,
but the "evaluation" version is better than the registered version,
and faster too), TP-Board. All except TP-Board and Wildcat are FIDO-
capable. OPus is one you ought to stay away from unless you like your
message base ALONE taking up 20-30 meg of storage space. QuickBBS is
very flexible, but very difficult to set up; if you aren't a programmer
you're likely to have a rough time getting it installed. RemoteAccess
is a good, reliable, easy-to-install system, bt one without a lot of
features. Wildcat sucks eggs.
 
Other systems you might look into: BBSX (I don't know if this one is
commercial or not; it doesn't do FIDO but it's fast and weird as hell,
which are two things in its favor), TBBS (one of the best packages
on earth, but commercial and pretty damn expensive to boot).

While we're on the subject (kinda), I just read an article in an
industry magazine about a new sound system for 35mm movie film called
Cinema Digital Sound. Six tracks of CD-quality digital sound and one
"control" track that automatically controls the sound system, projector,
and the like...it's actually in production now and being released to
theatres equipped to handle it. Imagine...a CinemaScope film with
six-track digitized sound...yeah!

Wrong on both counts. You need to spend more time on the CandyNet Debate
Echo. One of the reasons Cheryl Mathison used to use the handle "Dr.
Mabuse" is that when she posted under the name "Cheryl" people would
come out of the woodwork with derogatory remarks about the fairer sex,
or passes, or both. A /lot/ of females who BBS use either false names
or gender-neutral handles, and I've even talked to a couple of users
on this board (who I shan't name) who claim that BBSing under a
female name is an invitation to harrassment and unwanted attention by
sysops and users alike. Racism is more difficult, sure, but try calling
a bunch of boards with the name "Willis Alfonso" sometime and tell me
if you don't get any reaction at all based on your apparant race.
People can be just as prejudiced and just as ignorant over a phone line
as they can in person.

  Yeah. Most new movies, no matter what title, are out if you just walk

  When you finally see the movie (title not mentioned for those who are 
sick of hearing it, like maybe Turtle...), let me know what you think...
watch Tim Curry, he's a pretty good actor. He's been that, "The Hunt For
Red October", "IT", and other movies, all playing different types of

Yeah that would be something.  Probably be awhile before it becomes part
of most movie houses.  I was pretty happy with dolby.  Which if you 
remember is a hell of a lot better that what used to be in movie houses 
when we were younger.  Remember?  Some of the useres on this board were 
born into the age of high quality sound.  And to get off the subject a 
little bit, I went to a Kodak semoinar the other day.  It gave a demo of
silver halide photo transfer onto compact disc.  Yes thats right, 
compact disc.  This system will bemarketed in 1992 for a mere 100,000.00
Targeted for the retail finisher, it allows a trained technician to 
TOTALLY manipulate a photo.  The info is read into a (Yuk) Apple
computer.  Then the tec. can chang e every aspect of the photo.  
Change eye color, duplicate subject matter, remove people or other 
subjects, erase and then duplicate patterns to cover  the area erased, 
you can paint with any color from within a color library or from a color
on the photo.  All this and a lot more.  After completing the adjusted 
image, you can resave it to disc or get a thermal print.  If you want to
view the disc, it can be viewed on a TV or monitor via a CDplayer which
can plya these special discs or audio CD's.  About 100 low resolution 
images can fit on a disc or 30-40 high res. images.  The lower quantity 
is due to the great deal of added information.  The projected price of a
disc will be around $20.00.  About the same as your better photo labs.  
What really fascinated me was about (get this) 30 meg could fit on one 
side of one disc.  (Same size as a standard audio CD).  Pretty neat 
stuff...huh!

   Well.. this isnt my co=hoice of a machine... I like to think of it
as the beta-prototype of my Amiga 3000... just needs some bugs worked
out, like an operating system would be nice!  at any rate Radio Shack
can kiss my a$$ when it comes to buying their stuff... ill hacksaw the
back of my machine to make something fit! and these drives are internal
that are going to be mounted externally... not very asthetic but 
at least its something! (at least 100 megs of something)

It appears to be a less-than sign, a period, and a lowercase l, sir.

   All of the 'bestial' names on this board (including yours, mine, and
others) are completely gender-neutral and color-neutral. I still 
maintain that it is easier to keep from gender and color harassments
over a phone line than it is in person. (And hopefully there's a larger
number of people who are intelligent enough NOT to harass.)

   Making paper from hemp is not a bad idea... if hemp were legal, it
would be one of its uses. Same for clothing.
   And, of course, it would spawn one whole bunch of conservatives
burning books.

   If it makes you feel any worse, later this month, there's going to
be about two or three weeks without posts from me.
