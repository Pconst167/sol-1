have the slightest idea what 	I can do.  I want to get out of this damn
state, and into California, BUT, I do not want to leave Lisa here.  I 
had said that I loved her, and I do, but I really want to get outa this

Agreed...but what does that have to do with the ability to love more
than one person at a time? It is also possible to /be/ loved by more
than one person at a time.
 
While I see, and agree with, your point that if you start loving
everyone around you, or if you love easily, that love doesn't mean very
much, that /doesn't/ mean that you must therefore love only /one/ person
for the love to have meaning, it means your love should be an uncommon
commodity. To extend your own plutonium-vs-dirt metaphor, if you got
/two/ handfuls of plutonium that don't suddenly make it as worthless as
dirt...

   Actually, I was thinking over "four levels" of morality:
    
   Crowley: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law."
   Wicca: "As it harms none, do as thou wilt."
   Buddhism: "Do not do unto others what don't want them to do unto you"
   Judaism: "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."
    
   (I consider Wicca and Buddhism approximately the same moral law,
one stated positively; one negatively.) 
   I'm not sure what "sophisticated" would mean, for a moral code.
If you mean "knowing" or "worldly-wise," I would disagree.  (Of course,
this depends on how one defines to "harm another."  For example, eating
beef in India would "harm" no other person, so would be allowable under
Wicca -- but would not be "worldly-wise.")  If you mean "intellectually
appealing," I can't argue in manners of taste.
    
   Again, I'm not sure how you'd define "useful" for a moral code.  Any
action allowed (nay, required) by the Jewish law would be allowed by
Wicca -- but not vice-versa.  Therefore, if your definition of "useful"
were based on freedom to choose, it would be more "useful."  If you were
to refer to how people think of your moral character, the Jewish one
would probably make people think more highly of you.
    
   I'm kind of surprised at your phrase "There are too many things the
Golden Rule doesn't cover that are immoral."  The biggest difference
between the Wicca rule and the Jewish one is permission versus
requirement.  I believe that if the Jewish moral code does not cover
a certain immoral act, then neither would the Wicca one.

DF>[Moral preaching]
 
Well, let's take this one step at a time. Of the four moral codes you
mentioned, the Wiccan "As it harms none, do as thou wilt" and the
Buddhist "Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto
you" are /not/ the same. The difference is fairly subtle, but I'd still
expect someone who spends as much time as you do contemplating this sort
of nonsense to grasp it. All the other codes (except Crowley's, which is
hardly a "moral code") govern /specifically/ the way you behave toward
other people. They make no mention of any action and do not pretend to
cover any action that does not directly impact on other people. The
Wiccan code does. Also, the other codes (this is the subtle distinction)
prohibit /doing things TO other people/ which you would not have done
unto you. The Wiccan code prohibits doing /anything/ which harms others.
Even incidentally; even indirectly. While the others can /by extension/
be considered to prohibit those actions which might harm people
incidentally, they do not /specifically/ prohibit those actions; they
only tell you not to do something which you wouldn't like someone else
to do to you. If you do something which doesn't involve others directly
and hurts others only incidentally, you are not "doing unto" others what
you wouldn't want done unto you. There are many people in this country
who consider themselves good, upstanding Christians, who in their
conduct to others obey the Golden Rule, who still dump CFC's into the
air, bury toxic waste, etc. The Wiccan rule /specifically/ forbids these
actions.
 
By "more sophisticated" I meant "more complex; more subtle and well-
developed". That should not have been that difficult to figure out...

Tampa eyed Shandra a moment, considering her suggestion. "Yes, I think

hated when she did that. 
Reluctantly, Jarvis set down the tumbler he was shaking and stepped out 
from behind the bar. "Yes?" His voice was lined with irritation.
"I want you to have some of the boys go over and bring those crates of 
firearms over here." Seeing the shadow cross Jarvis's face, Tampa 
lowered her voice another notch. "The less said the better, but I think 
we may have some problems... better safe than sorry." 
"But.." Jarvis started to complain. 
"Just do it." Tampa cut him off and turned away without waiting for his 
reply. 'Damn, I wish Korelyan was here.' she thought to herself as she 
scanned her eyes over a pair of newcomers entering the bar. Anyone here 
could be dangerous.... with so many strangers coming and going.. even
with Louis checking them at the door, all it would take was one well

   No, I don't think it's a silly question, and I still don't.  There's
a lot we can do on this board, mulling over concepts.  But when our
conversations reach the real world -- and things which affect our 
lives -- then I like to have a corroboration with the real world.
     
   Also, even if there's medical documentation backing up a position,
it ain't necessarily so.  Only over time and a fair amount of experi-
mentation can we know whether something works or not.

T> [Moral preaching]
   
   Well, let's take this one step at a time.  I never stated that the
Wiccan "As it harms none, do as thou wilt" and the Buddhist "Do not do
unto others what you would not have them do unto you" were the same. I
said they were "approximately the same..., one stated positively, one
stated negatively." 
    
   Your argument seemed to shove together the Buddhist position with
the Jewish one: the Jewish rule makes NO mention of prohibiting 
anything.  Only the Buddhist one does.
    
   Even still, your argument seems to be: The difference between the
Wiccan rule and the Buddhist rule is that of indirect versus direct 
harm.  The Buddhist rule only prohibits direct harm to others; the 
Wiccan rule prohibits any action that can, directly or indirectly, harm
another.  Sounds like a good summary?
    
   You yourself destroy that argument.  "If you do something which 
doesn't involve others directly and hurts others only incidentally,
you are not 'doing onto' others what you wouldn't have done unto you."
In other words, indirect harm is also part of the Buddhist rule.
     
   (The difference, as I see it, is that the Wiccan rule promotes 
activity, and supports the human will.  The Buddhist rule promotes
passivity, and makes no mention of the will.)
     
   I see the Jewish rule as the superior one.  If you saw a child 
about to drown, only the Jewish rule would ask you do save the child.
Inaction could be justified in Wicca: the child is harming herself,
you are not harming the child.  The Buddhist rule is worse: you are
not doing anything to worsen the child's problem.

Your point about the drowning child is well taken; only the Golden Rule
/mandates/ that you take action to save the child in that situation.
Obviously, none of the rules we are discussing is in and of itself a
complete moral code. You can't really put an entire system of ethics
into a single sentence; I still believe that the Wiccan effort is more
broad and hits closer to the mark than the Golden Rule, however.

"Compromise." (Heh, heh, heh.) That reminds me in an offhand way though
of an article by Douglas Hofstadter about compromise; it's not always
the appropriate solution to a problem. If Jimmy and Sammy are arguing
about dividing a cake, with Jimmy saying he wants half of it and Sammy
demanding all of it, a rational person would not say, "Okay, now you
two compromise. Jimmy can have one-third of it, and Sammy can have two-
thirds." It's dangerous to assume that compromise is the solution to a
problem you don't have any direct knowledge of; people have an annoying
habit of believing justice must lie halfway between two opposing points
of view, and in reality t'ain't always so.

   I agree completely that not everyone will agree with the assumptions.
But "logic" -- to me, at least -- does not deal with the assumptions,
only with how the assumptions are put together.  For example:
    
   The Armadillo is God.
   All armadillos are purple.
  -------------------------------
   God is purple.
     
   Completely correct logic: but most people would disagree with both
assumptions and the conclusion.  This is what happens in religious 
discussions.  Logic might be flawless, but assumptions are shaky.

   I don't see how your sentence ("If you do something which doesn't
harm others directly and hurts others only incidentally, you are not
'doing onto' others what you wouldn't want done unto you.") could be
taken to mean ANYTHING but both direct and indirect harm is prohibited.
     
   Changing the topic slightly, you said, "You can't really put an
entire system of ethics into a single sentence."  My question: Do you
feel you can put an entire system of ethics into English?  Is ethics
completely describable?
    
   I agree that the Wiccan rule is more broad than the Jewish rule.  I
also agree that Crowley's rule is more broad than the two of them. So
what?
     
   Which of the two comes "closer to the mark," of course depends on
your full system of ethics: I'm sure the two of us would disagree on
a huge number of points on what's ethical.

    I sat down the other day and had a strange idea, I figured I would
share it with you.
 
     Everyone has certain traits that seperate him/her from other
hims/hers. (Hair Color, Eye Color, Height, etc...)
 
	     So I asked myself, I wonder in color perception is differnt to 
people, and since it is impossible to describe colors (How do you tell a
blind person what red looks like?) we may never know, here is my idea.
 
      Everyone views colors differntly from everyone else, For Example
let'sgo down to the three basic colors Red, Blue,  and Yellow.  Now I
was wondering, How do I know that my yellow isn't your Blue, and your
red my blue?  If you are brought up that grass is GREEN you'd always
think green was the color of grass, but I might see grass to be a 
differnt color, but I would still think it was Green since everyone has 
me it is green.  
 
       So, this means, that some people may see the world in the 
reverse of what I, or anyone else, perceives it to be.
  
       The same concept can also be applied to White and Black.. 
 
       So did ANYONE understand what I'm trying to say???  I sure would 
like to answer this some day, before I pull ALL my hair out!

If you do something which does not harm anyone directly and harms others
only indirectly, you are not 'doing unto' others what you would not have
them done unto you.
 
That means:
 
If you do something which harms others only indirectly, you are not
doing unto others what you would not have them do unto you. The part
you are not interpreting correctly is the clause 'you are not doing unto
others...' What I am saying is this: If you do that which harms others
only indirectly, you are not doing anything UNTO OTHERS; you are doing
something which is not directed at other people but which involves them
only incidentally. You are not 'doing unto others what you would not hav
them do unto you'; you are not violating the Golden Rule. If you re-read
the sentence again, you will see that in interpreting it as you are you
are losing the negation in the last clause.
 
>Do you think you can express a complete set of ethics in English?
 
That's an issue that has nothing to do with what I was discussing, and
frankly I'm not that interested in getting into a discussion on
semantics and linguistics. Sufice it to say that I don't think there's
anything terribly mysterious about ethics, or even anything intrinsic-
ally different from any other complex belief sets. I certainly don't see
any reason why a complete set of ethics can't be stated in any
particular language you care to name.

The idea you state about color perception is hardly a new one; I came

That question also came up in a college neurophysiology class I had

radically between individuals, and we'll leave it at that...unless you

I don't think you quite have the Buddhist moral position down very well;
one of the problems is that Buddhism is like Christianity in that there
are dozens - hundreds! - of Buddhist "churches" (organized groups).
For instance, one group (well, probably alot more than one) believes
that one should not kill, or cause to be killed, any living thing. Dick
Gregory had (has?) this position. He eats only "parts" of vegetable
matter -- nuts, fruits, etc.  From about 8 years of research, my sense
is that most Buddhists believe that if the results of any action are
"bad" (and if one knows this), the action is wrong, and a good Buddhist
would not perform that action (Karma and all that). 
An interesting aside is that the 10 Commandments are supposedly God's
word on what one should not do. In Buddhism (or at least some groups),
there are almost exactly those same 10 "commandments", but they are
prefaced by:   A Buddhist has no reason to:
                1 - Kill
                2 - Slander
                3 - (etc.)
Nontheless, with Buddhism arising from a very "old" civilization, the
moral precepts tend to be (in my opinion) rather well-followed....

independent thing: it's a "conglomeration", and we, each of us,
play our part in it as well! No one of us can control it, but
we can take responsibility for doing our creative best to aim
its values in what we think are good directions. I remember a
number of musically proficient friends who got some excellent
musical insights when high (usually grass); should we negate those
insights by saying "Drugs Are Bad", "Don't Think: Just Say No"...????
Yet no one (or few) of us will change those social beliefs, and they

You bring up an interesting point... take color blind people for 
instance. Colors cannot be described with words, they must be viewed. 
If a blind person from birth suddenly regained their sight... they 
would not know that Green was the color of grass.... but they would 
be able to see the grass.... and the color... just not know what it was 
called.

   Well if my black looked liek white to you, and your nlack looked
like white to me, then our perceptions WOULD be changed, and our 
ideas of what is light or dark would also be reversed.
 
     Here's an example, let's say your brain is programed like this:
  
                 With ColorThatISaw do
                    If X length of Light Waves then color = Blue;
                    If Y length of Light Waves then color = Green;
 
 	   
     May I should rephrase that.
 
	   Learned Colors = Green, Red, Blue
 
           With Color That I Saw do
                 If X length of light wave then color = 1;
                 If Y length of light wave then color = 2;
 
 Now, If you saw Color 1, then you saw what you have been told is green.
 
So, let's say someone else has
                                                                   
                If X length of light wave then color = 2;
		                If Y length of light wave then color = 1;
 
  What you are told are the colors (Green, Red, Blue), haven't changed,
but the way that person B's brain figures them out HAS chnaged, now why
can't it be possible?
 
   BTW, did the above example make any sence at all?

   And you later say that you're not interested in getting into a d
discussion on "semantics and linguistics"?  I was considering "unto"
as a synonym of "to." 
       
   (By the way, if you must refer to the rules by metals: the Buddhist
rule, "Do not do...what you would not have them..." is called the Silver
Rule.  The Golden Rule drops the "nots" -- and is therefore quite 
different.)
    
   I see your point, though, how "unto" implies not doing anything
which directly hurts others, but allows for the possibility of doing
things which indirectly hurt others. 
     
   To change the topic, no, I DON'T believe all of ethics could be
stated completely.  There's too much situational ethics that's necessary
in the world to define ethics.  If you accept the commandment: "Thou
shalt not murder," I'd ask you to define murder.  Is killing in self-
defense murder?  What about animals?  And how does one define self-
defense?  The circle goes on.

(This is what you get for not quite understanding what was being

   Your note was, well, appreciated, though it was way off the mark.
One of the sayings of the Buddha, which applies quite well to Western
ideas, was the so-called "Silver Rule": "Do not do unto others what you
would not have them do unto you."
   
   Turtle and I were debating about the differences between Buddhism's
"Silver Rule" and the rule the Wiccans believe ("If it harms not others,
do as thou wilt.").  This kind of splintered from a conversation about
which simple moral rule, if taken alone, would lead to the "best" --
and most useful -- morality.
     
   We weren't at all trying to set down either the complete Buddhist,
Wiccan, or Judaic moral philosophies.  Just which "base rule" came the
closest to morality.
   
   About your "interesting aside:"  You might find it interesting to
check out the 10 Commandments, and figure out how many of them are of
the form: "Thou shalt not..." (Hint: Not one of the first five
commandments are negative.  They all command you to DO something.)
And at least four of the commandments could NOT translate over to 
Buddhism, even if they wanted to.

   Well, we disagree on the definition of logic.  I consider logic to
be a kind of computer -- utterly incapable of determining what's 
applyable to the real world, but able to make good judgements, given
good data.
     
   Also, I take issue with your idea: "correct" or "proven".  How do
you know when something is "proven"?   I prefer the concept of "useful"
to describe the world.  Scientific theories change as new data enters.
(Newton's laws of motion are still extremely "useful" theories -- even
though they've been "proven" wrong.)

     O H ,   P L E A S E ! ! !  Spare me, Turtle.  I thought you were
much more intelligent than that.  Do you REALLY think it's possible to
have a discussion -- ANY discussion -- without some sort of faith?
Even if it's called a "shared world view" (which presupposes that 
reality exists, and that we usually perceive it correctly) there's a
leap of faith.  There was a leap of faith when you sat down on the
chair you're sitting in.  (Even if you've sat in it thousands of times
before, inductive reasoning proves nothing.)
     
   All of mathematics depends on "leaps of faith."  And frequently,
mathematicians disagree about those "leaps of faith," or axioms. 
Because all physical sciences depend on mathematics, those leaps of 
faith find their way into just about everything.
    
   Well, what's the difference between these mathematical axioms and
religious axioms?   Only one thing: verifiability.  There's nothing
wrong with leaps of faith. Period.

   Within a mile of the Tampa Radiation belt, his Geiger counter started

was once a city.  Some of the smaller islands there had natives trying

   He had heard from some older folks about the Den of Decadence: a

   Wesley is, simply, a spoiled brat.  His parents own UraniCo, the
largest supplier of uranium in the world.  (They're centered in New
Atlanta, though most of their mines are elsewhere.)
      
   He is, of course, armed with three knives: one in each boot, and
one strapped under his left sleeve.  They shouldn't be too hard for
the guards to find, but he'll be REAL upset when they're taken from
him.
     
   He is fifteen years old, and looks it -- though he THINKS he looks
older.  He has long, black hair, dark brown eyes, and is one hundred
percent human.  
   
   One of the more unusual items he's carrying is a 'coonskin hat with
a nice, long tail.  This will figure more prominently later.  He has a
fake I.D. saying he's twenty-one (though I doubt that will be used.)
And the hovercraft is of a model that it's REAL easy to pick the locks

One has the same problem with "useful" as with "correct" or "proven":
in fact, ANY concept which relates to absolutes (and "useful" - having

Color-blind people have a physical problem with the receptors in their
eye or in the circuitry that processes color information in the optic
chiasm or the brain that results in information from some of the color
receptors not getting processed correctly. As a result, some of the
color information is missing. If the system works, it works the same way
in every member of a given species. If part of the system doesn't work,
you get color blindness or some other visual defect. Very simple, no?

When someone tells you that color X is called "blue," it does not have
any effect on the /way/ you perceive that color. It doesn't matter
/what/ sound you attach to that color, you perceive it in a given
way that's totally unaffected by the color's name. If you told a baby
that red was called "blue" for his entire life, he'd still SEE it as
red; he'd just use a different pattern of sounds to describe it, that's
all.

way one interacts with the real world ("Thou shalt have no other god

simply because it's difficult to build a society without them.

Oh, please. I thought you were more intelligent than that. That is
exactly what I was talking about. If I drop a hammer and expect it
it fall, that is a "leap of faith" of a completely different order
than if I drop dead and expect god to be waiting for me when I'm

discussion of the intrinsic differences between religious debates and
other types of debates.

   Huh?  I thought "useful" would NOT relate to an absolute.  There may
be many "useful" theories which can explain an event: proving which one
was "correct" would be nearly impossible.  No absolutes necessary.
     
>And Newton's laws were not "Proven wrong": they were just shown to be

   Something is "proven wrong" when a counterexample is found.  At 
speeds approaching light, force does NOT equal mass * acceleration.
But, very few people want to worry about the infinitessimal correction
Einstein's laws give when we're dealing with, say, the speed a car is
going.
   Newton's laws are a fantastic example of what I'm talking about. 
They provide an extremely accurate picture of the world, for some
world views.  BUT -- at really large speeds, or really small distances,
it breaks down, horribly.  (If Newton's laws were true, for example, 
every atom would be radiating light.)

   Manifest Bullshit (tm) to two points:
     
   The second, and easiest, first:  It's very easy to build a society
without all the remaining six commandments.  Capitalism as a system is
based around breaking the tenth commandment: "Thou shalt not covet."
     
   Now, on to your first point:  Again, complete and utter bullshit.
How one views God has a great bearing on how one interacts with the
real world, especially if you feel that doing well will bribe God
into a better place in Paradise (or get you out of Torment.)  If you
feel that certain actions (dying in a jihad, going to a certain
building every Sunday, not eating pork) will bribe God further, you
will also do those things. 
   Those first four commandments put the real power behind the last
six. Very simple, no?

leap of faith buried in there somewhere....try as you might to conceal

the different forms of the media.  Try this experiment the next three
weeks: The first week, get all of your news about the world from the
T.V. (Any station, any channel) and none from any other source.  The
next, get all your news from the radio.  The final week, just get your

   At the end of those three weeks, ask yourself: Where did I get the

No, I was saying that religious debates contain or involve a leap of
faith that is manifestly different from the "faith" involved in a
statement like "If I drop a hammer it'll fall." My dictionary defines
"faith" as "Faith, n. Belief that is not based on proof." Semantic
quibbling, hairsplitting, and existentialist bullshit aside, I think
it's accurate to say the differnce between a logical argument and a
religious argument is that the latter will always involve some sort of
leap of faith that is inherently unprovable and therefore not subject to
rational analysis. Religious discussions can borrow the tools and
techniques of logic, but they are not logical.

   I still don't rest well, knowing Georgie is in the White House.  He's
still worried that he's perceived as a wimp, so he invades two 
countries.  He's right: he's no longer perceived as a wimp.  Just a

   Turtle, do you accept mathematics as rational?  Do you consider math
to be subject to 'rational analysis'?  ALL mathematics -- even 
arithmetic -- depends on "leaps of faith that are inherently
unprovable."  They're termed axioms, and frequently mathematicians
debate whether axioms should or shouldn't be included.  (Different
schools of thought use different axioms... even down to logic!)
    
    My other argument, that logic is NOT based on the validity of the
presuppositions, but is just a 'mechanism' for creating new statements
from old, has been said before.  
   
   Have you ever talked with a true solipsist, or someone who pretended
to be one?  You can't disprove his/her idea that the world is imaginary
because they won't admit any of your assumptions.  After you've talked
with someone like that, you realize that nearly EVERYTHING you say
depends on 'unprovable assumptions' -- even just a shared world-view.

No, "proven wrong" is not when a counterexample is found.  Newton's
laws ARE correct (which is why they're still taught!) in local
timespace. There's nothing "wrong" with them in that context: 
Relativity just jumped to another context. It's much like saying
the temperature here is cool (I'm inside), while someone else says
"I just saw the weather report: the temperature is 93!")
Re "useful", I know you attempted to avoid absolutes, but useful as
a concept is still "absolute", in the sense that it is interpreted
to mean "absolutely of use"....in fact, "useful" is a poor choice of
concepts re theories, because it has the same problems as you find in
Newton's Laws: they are true, but only for particular contexts. Same
with "useful". And worse, "useful" is a subjective term (tho most
people don't use it that way). What is useful to one person (or one
theorist) is NOT useful to another. A theory does not have inherent
usefulness: people may attempt to find use for one, and in certain
circumstances may be useful (but in others may be destructive!)...

Mathmatical axioms do not share any significant relationship to
religious faith because even though no sufficiently complex mathmatical
system is entirely provable, the system as a whole (a) is self-
consistent and (b) the axioms have consequences which are observable
and provable. Religious models can sometimes approach condition (a)
but not condition (b). This is the sort of semantic hairsplitting I
was talking about: no matter how you slice it, there is still a
quantifiable, qualitative difference between a leap of fath of a
religious nature and a 'leap of faith' that is not religious. Belief in
God is fundamentally a leap of faith that by its nature cannot be proven
or disproven in any way whatsoever. This belief is quite different in
kind from acceptance of a mathematic axiom.
 
Your second point falls into the 'existentialist bullshit' category.
Sure, you can argue that nothing outside yourself exists until Hell
freezes over, but it doesn't get you anywhere; if your 'imaginary' next-
door neighbor throws an 'imaginary' brick at your 'imaginary' head with
sufficient velocity, I guarantee you'll perceive 'imaginary' pain.
What's more, the phenomenon is repeatable (if he does it again you'll
still percieve the same imaginary pain) and verifiable (all your
imaginary neighbors will agree that they are all perceiving you lying
in a pool of your own blood). Therefore, all such arguments are irrele-
vant; the universe behaves as though it were /not/ imaginary, so
believing that it is is pointless.

..... how else on ya gonna keep up with where Elvis really is now... 
UH, let's see, at last count, he was flipping hamburgers in some small 
town at a Burger King and he planned to sing at the Super Bowl.... 
.... hmmm, I guess he stepped aside for Whitney Houston though.. You 
KNOW what a gentleman he is...

DF>(suggesting listening to the TV, the Radio, and the Newspaper and 
   comparing)
 
Well, the radio would lose big time... the news you get there is sketchy
at best.... CNN tends to get stuck on a continuing subject and pretty 
much fast forward through anything else... I'd have to say it would be 
the newspaper...... but I don't like getting that damned ink all over 
my hands...(that was a joke).. I actually prefer CNN but I think the 
Newspaper probably would tell you more "in depth".

Yes, Yes, Yes.... I know my comment about men NOT cooking was sexist. 
It was meant to be sexist..... I was merely taking a "female" hostility
out on that message... that's why I said, No offence...... You are all 
hereby excluded from /that/ post.

Continuation of that last message, I hit save by error.... 
 
Actually, having smoked On and Off for several years... I really didn't 
notice any difference... I can still taste quite well... but I have 
seen smokers who pour salt and pepper on everything they eat to enhance 
the taste.... but I'm not one of them.

backed away like it was poison...... hmmm, maybe they read the page long

SB> ....I start in with some Wayne Newton and slowly evolve into

Ah.... You left out a song, that's all... you forgot the theme to the 
Brady Bunch..... right between Stairway and Gilligan.... if you skip 
that one..... you're wasting your time.

Many thanks! That's just what I needed!
(Re questions, yes, the the outer portions revolve more slowly - current
theories - well, some of them - attribute most of that to "dark matter")
 
Thanks again - chas.

Much truth here: tho I'm not sure that belief in God _by it's very
nature_ is unprovable. There could be a scenario where God
_proves_ him/her-self -- maybe on Channel 4 (Public Access Channel)..:)
