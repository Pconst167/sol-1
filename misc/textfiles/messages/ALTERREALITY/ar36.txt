Reagan increased the deficit he "inherited" from 2 billion dollars to
2 *TRILLION* dollars.  Despite what Reagan would like you to believe,
that can't be blamed on previous administrations.  If he was so great
at running things, he would have at least levelled off the sucker.
 
While Carter killed a few defense programs, at least one of which he
shouldn't have (the B-1), he hardly sent the military to hell in a
handbasket.  Reagan gave us new programs, all right -- the resurrected
B-1, at about 10x the original cost and half the efficiency, the
wonderful Bradley anti-tank gun that shot the reviewing stand on its
first roll-out, the Abrams tank that can't fit on tank carriers, and
personnel carriers that can be destroyed by a well-placed hand
grenade.  This is an improvement?

   Carter had one major fault, one which should have kept him 
permanently from the presidency: he was a genuinely nice guy. He
actually was a born-again Christian who actually believed... (And to
all you pagans out there, nyeeeh! The previous statement does not imply
you're not nice... nor that all B.A.C.'s are. Just that Carter is.)
   Reagan on the other hand was... well, uh... not all there.

And now you do /them/ of all people an injustice. Toward the end they
were just sitting tight so they could wait for a new President to
release the hostages--saved face, and generated negative publicity for
Carter, whom they simply didn't like. The new President was utterly

>A cat is a cat.
 
Okay, let's start with that one. A cat is a quadraped; Reli is a biped.
A cat has paws; Reli has hands. A cat does not have an opposing thumb;
Reli does. Reli is a cat in exactly the same sense that you are a
chimpanzee.
 
>The thing that separates us [from chimpanzees]..is the # of chromosomes
 
No, actually, it's the information coded on the chromosomes. I believe
that humans and chimps have the same /number/ of 'em, but they're notr
the same chromosomes.
 
>If Reli could be crossed with a housecat...
 
No. She is sufficiently different from cats to indicate that, genetic-
ally speaking, she is not a cat.
 
>...Reli could be crossed with a human...
 
Again, almost certainly not. Reli is almost as different, genetically,
from a human as she is from a cat.
 
In any event, all of this is probably irrlelvant. I personally would
say that the key ingredient in an act of bestiality is the fact that the
non-human involved is a /beast/; ie, a non-sapient animal. Reli is no
more a beast than George Bush, at least not in any sense of the word
that really matters for this sort of thing.

Of /course/ we would win a conflict with Iraq. They're in a position
that's a logistical nightmare--fighting a desert war with supply lines
that cut across a recently subjegated nation, no economic base to
support a prolongued war effort, an army plagued by aging and obsolete
equipment, surrounded by hostile neighbors...I did not mean to imply
we couldn't, er, "kick their asses." What I was trying to say is that
the function of the front-line Army units currently stationed on the
Saudi border is to act as a human tripwire. They could not withstand the
initial thrust of an invasion; they would die dramatically and provide
the catalyst for a popular counterattack. Nothing personal against
any of 'em, but they're horribly outnumbered and in the SHORT RUN that's
what counts.

Nixon presided over a corrupt government. However, Nixon didn't end up
with a significant number of his underlings in jail, Nixon didn't
preside over the sort of open, flagrant criminality that went on in all
levels of Reagan's government and even involved entire institutions and
industries...and Nixon knew selective expenditure. Reagan, your personal
hero and god of the "strong defense" (the overriding consideration that
will, to a conservative, excuse absolutely ANYTHING) gave money to every
schmuck that walked up to him and said "I have this great idea for a
neat new weapon that'll let America kick them Commie asses! Gimme a few
billion and I'll prove it!" As a result, we ended up with piles of crap
in our armories (like the missile guidance systems that were supposed to
end up in the MX that can't tell Moscow from Des Moines), no money in
the defense budget, airplanes that fly into the ground, three hundred
dollar toilet seats, flammable armored personel carriers that go up
like Roman candles when some dipshit with a grenade wanders by...
 
Boy, that Reagan. Strong Defense. I bet our various opponents on the
world stage would like to see him in charge of defense for about ten
more years.

Gramm-Rudman would have gone a fairly long way to stopping the deficit.
If it had been implemented correctly, the deficit would have levelled
off by now.  If it had been implemented correctly near the beginning of
Reagan's administration, it would have been reducing the deficit by
now.
    There is an IMMENSE amount of waste in the federal government.  Do
you realize that the amount of money spent by all the government
branches just PROCESSING FORMS is greater than the GNP of most of the
world's countries?  A lot of it was in the defense department, and
still is.  Reagan built up our defenses, all right, but he did it by
saying "sure, go ahead" to any contractor who tried to sell the gov't
anything.  If the DoD ROUTINELY pays over $800 for a PAIR OF PLIERS --
which is what they have been charged by some companies for Milspec
tools -- apply the same proportional waste to, say, the Stealth bomber
bomber program, and realize that we've bought about 60 of them.  One
of those bombers costs MORE than the budget of every environmental
agency in the Federal government put together... and they're already
effectively obsolete (technological advances in Soviet military combined
with the fact that the specific missions they're designed for are
unlikely to be necessary now that they're not likely to be used against
the Soviets when/if they go into combat makes them fast B-52's with
about 20% of the B-52's payload capacity).  Now figure that that entire
program is an insignificant part of the DoD budget.
   If we revamped our defense system, we could not only make it MORE
effective for the types of combat it's likely to go into in the future
(guerilla tactics or armies like Hussein's, large but technologically
less than impressive, and chem/bio weapons instead of nuclear ones), we
could probably spend about 50% what we're spending now.  Cutting lots of
programs may not be a good answer, but neither is writing blank
checks.

The hostages were not freed due to ANY actions of either Carter or
Reagan.  Most political analysts, including conservative ones, will tell
you that.  Giving Reagan credit for freeing the Iranian hostages is,
well, inaccurate.  Carter most certainly did not sit around with his
thumbs up his ass; if the desert rescue mission had been executed
competently (it was screwed up due to the expert efficiency of the
American military, who didn't realize complicated tactical details like

SCREENS INSTALLED), Carter would have been a national hero and would
have gone on to another term.  Because it didn't succeed, he was a
national joke, and would have lost no matter who he was running against.
   I don't agree with Turtle's "the American forces are there as cannon
fodder" argument, and yes, the American military is well-trained.  I
would dispute your claim that they're the best military force in the
world (I'd give the Israelis that distinction), but they're certainly
pretty high on the list.
   And no, it's not our war.  That should be patently obvious.  I said
in the message that started this thread, "we're there solely to protect
our economic interests."  At least this time we do have a vested
interest in the region, but we are involved as a third party pretending
to come to the rescue of a smaller guy being beaten up by the bully.
While that is, in fact, what we're going, rescuing Kuwait is kind of
incidental to the issue.
   By the way, before you spew any more at me, you might have noticed I
never said we shouldn't be there.  I wish there was a way to avoid it,
and I certainly wouldn't WANT us to be there (nor would I want any of
my friends going there, although I suspect at least two may be), but it
is economically necessary for someone to keep Iraq from controlling too
much of the oil in the region.

Well, I said sex with her /might/ produce offspring.  Writing about the
overrated joys of family life, regardless of what race/species/whatever
comprises the family, has never appealed to me.
   Yes, she probably /would/ qualify as a different lifeform; the
premise of the story (or one of them) is an alternate earth where the
dominant life evolved from felids instead of from primates.  There
wouldn't be a direct analogy to her people on our planet, by definition.
   The same could be said for all the anthropomorphic species in Ranean
Tales, although a lot of the 'morphs there were originally magically
created from the "normal" animals.  While I've seen them referred to
as animals in stories, and I've probably done it myself, Reli -- and
Wezip, Juka, and for that matter, the character Turtle -- are animals in
the same sense humans are animals.  When people make a distinction
between humans and animals, though, all of those 'morphs would probably
meet all the metaphysical & philosphical requirements for humans, they'd
just be a true different race, like Dungeons & Dragons elves or dwarves.
   Speculating on the difference language makes is kind of interesting.
If you call Juka a fox, the question of bestiality comes up; if you call
her an Altani and describe her as a furry alien with vulpine features,
then it probably doesn't.  (Of course, questions relating to being
attracted to aliens would take their place, but at least you'd be
discussing two sapient beings responsible for their own actions, not a
human making dovy-eyes, or worse, at a confused animal.)

I identify with the "liberal" banner more closely than "conservative"
because of the issues involved.  I see far too many people on both sides
who haven't really thought about anything and who do, in fact, believe
that the ACLU is a bunch of bleeding-heart liberals whose only purpose
is to fight conservative thought (despite the fact that they have aided
in the defense of both Oliver North and Tammy Faye Bakker), that
"Robert Bork's Amerika" would have meant the end of freedom as we know
it (he may have been so strict a constitutionalist that instead of
reading things into the law that weren't there, he was missing things in
the law that were taken for granted, but he still wasn't Satan), or that
merely calling someone a "liberal" (or "conservative", albeit in much
fewer circles) immediately negates anything they have to say.  I don't
like a lot of what's going on 	with social programs under Bush, and I
certainly don't think he's going to win any Critics' Choice awards as
the best leader of the 20th century; he's just not a crook, a klutz, a
smile with nothing to say or an actor riding the crest of the religious
right and sound-bite conservatism, which -- sadly -- probably makes him
the best president we've had in 20 years.
   Although the fact that he WANTED Quayle as his VP still disturbs me.

You're too serious on occasion Max... I should sincerely hope that my

My friend Harold is Jewish and fits the stereotype so perfectly that it

Sorry Max - that wins a NonSequitar stamp.  The federal deficit is
powered in ways that even professionals aren't sure of and to assume
that with the limited powers of the President, held in check by the
Senate and House, can halt a financial juggernaut of these proportions
is silly.  Not only that but it is absurd to even contemplate changing
the course of something that started rolling long ago and has built up
and almost unstoppable inertia in a mere 4 to 8 years.  We need LONG

CPU>Pray tell, how can you know...kind of sexuality a person is? 
 
Well, not to go into a long-winded explanation but there ARE a lot of
non-verbal cues that I learned to pick up on from my friends in S.F.
The most prevalent is the lack of a "positive" gender reference when
referring to "close" friends.  My friend up in Utah was shocked that
I had known he was gay from about the second week I knew him.  My clue
was that in referring to his lovers he would inevitably end up using
a neutral phrase such as "this person".  He was consious of the fact 
that in discussing this person that the "beans could get spilled" and
was consequently over-careful.  Hopefully that's clear.  I want to 
poo-poo any ideas that it had to do with any limp wrists and lisps.
My friend is a very masculine person and in fact "takes" a woman on
occasion to keep the "image" up.  Hell he gets laid more often than
I do! :>

I was involved in a brain weight to body ratio and gastrointestinal

empty the gastrointestinal tract and check the contents. You CAN learn
the stuff hands on if it is presented properly and you are accomplishing
something, but most school projects turn into a Veg-O-Matic style of
dissection with nothing being accomplished. 
   Oh yeah, you should try to put a surgical knife through the hide of

The belly was softer, but the back was IMPOSSIBLE to stick ANYTHING

First and foremost, your basing of beast/humanity on the number of
chromosones is next to useless. At least some mammals (Ghods -- I've
got to look up exactly which ones!) have more chromosones than humans
do. Does that make them super-human?
     
   Second of all, what makes you so certain that creatures like Reli
have genetics based on chromosones?

   Hmmm... reminds me of an incident with my parents and someone who's
occasionally on these boards. (Call him Igor.) Igor is somewhat shy,
he has a fairly high-pitched voice for a male, and he is always quite
clean-shaven. When my parents met him, their comment was, "He seems 
like such a nice boy... you DO know that he's gay, don't you?" 
Quite far from the truth, in this case.

The idea of a lack of gender reference when talking about lovers
might help pick out pure homosexuals from the rest of people, but it
does not give one whit of information about bisexuals.

And desperately outnumbered. A quick and dirty Iraqui invasion of
Saudi Arabia would have certain predictable results: the American and
other forces in Saudi Arabia would be steamrollered, there would be a
fairly large-scale counter-offensive, the Iraquis would not have the
resources or the supplies to dig in and fight a protracted battle, the
Iraquis would lose. You could almost make it into a paint-by-numbers
thing. The long-term success wouldn't help the poor schmucks on the

   What front lines? The Iraqis have fantastic (over a million) ground
troops -- they're following the blitzkrieg strategy. But -- they have
a front line. But, the Americans have extremely few ground troops --
most of their power comes from the air.
   Any general who'd send American ground troops and expect them to
survive is hopeless... We'd need at least twice the number of troops
the Iraqis have just for a "fair fight." For some reason, the Americans
sent over lots of air-based and sea-based troops; not land-based.
Where the heck is our "front lines" in this case?

   Yup! I heard about it the next day. Ya know, what's really 
interesting is that the Republican Conference has predicted the
fall of Jesse Helms from the Senate... privately, of course. It
would be a good thing.
     
    From the department of Even Worse: (Note: the following is NOT
a TurtleSpew (tm). This is completely serious.) Senator D'Amato (R-NY)
has a spiffy new way to cut off drug trafficking. Why not one day
just change the color of money? Everybody can then go to the bank,
prove the money is theirs, and voila! they get spiffy-keen new-colored
money. But if they're a Bad Guy (tm) who sells drugs or can't prove
their money was gotten legally, then <POOF!> it disappears.
      
    If this is impossible, the senator continued, then why shouldn't
we have two forms of currency: one for legal use inside the country,
and a second for legal use outside the country? That was if the Mean
and Nasty Drug Traffickers tried to use some of Our currency outside
the country, they'd be caught instantly.

   Meanwhile, back at the Monocerous embassy, the lonely unicorn
picked up some of his last things with his mouth, and tossed them
into his bag. "Good shot," he muttered to himself. And he didn't
have to aim too hard with his horn. The unicorn had seen several games
of basketball -- and though he'd be better than most professionals.
Volleyball might be another story.
   Two thuds at the door broke his chain of thought. With a flip of
his horn the door unlocked, revealing a young raccoon messenger. 
Chip recognized him as one who the embassy employed. 
   "Two messages for you," started the raccoon. "The first is that the
Wa-Mar'am Explorer Shu-Wen wants to see you before you leave. And the
second is that your tickets have arrived. You'll be leaving three days
hence, on the starship Picard, at eight chimes." He turned as if to 
leave.
   "Wait a second," started the unicorn... what was his name? Oh,
Bobby. "Bobby. Wait." The raccoon stopped, glancing at the unicorn
strangely. Chip was feeling generous. Looking at the money piled
on his desk, he floated a silver coin toward the messenger. Tips
were rare on Ranea, but they were appreciated.
   Bobby caught the coin from the air, and smiled his thanks. He then
left for his other rounds.
     
   The Wa-Mar'am Shu-Wen? Chip remembered him somewhat. The short,
furry fellow was another non-human race -- but he blended in much
more easily with the furries around than Chip did. Covered with 
long, brown hair, he appeared to look more like a beaver or mole
than anything else. Another quadraped, but his four paws were all
able to act as hands. A great improvement over hooves, Chip thought.
   The Explorer was in Ranea to try to learn as much as possible about
extra-Universal politics -- and to meet as many people as possible.
He remembered some of his discussions -- an intelligent fellow. Chip
wondered where he had learned about Chip's leaving -- but that would
be a good start for conversation.

Yes, they are _hot_ but aside from that they are not uncomfortable and
certainly not unwieldy.  Given, you couldn't do acrobatics in them, but
for the purpose they were designed for (protect while in combat) they 
are quite effective.   Besides, how the hell would you know?  YOU ever 
had to wear one in field conditions?   Apparently not, since you don't
even know what they are made of....  When used properly (and there 
ARE proceedures which everybody uses) they are an effective WORKABLE 
responce to chemical attack. The only effect is that we would be 
hindered in our efforts, but the idea of a chemical attack (aside
from killing men) is to make area unusable for battel.  If an
area gets gassed, the NBC proceedure is followed, (^SP battle) the
unit withdraws to an NBC Decon site, and is re-supplied and ready fr
combat again.  In the meantime, another Decon crew goes out, sets up 
markers (NBC markers, to set area limits) so that the area won't be
crossed by another unit.  
  
  Even though Amercian Forces are prepared for such a battle, I don't
think that Hussien will use his Chems...remember, he's gotta cross that
space, too!  Given there's not a lot of space there that'w worth any-

These ALONE do not indicate anything.  now the timbre of his voice

is an indicator, exactly.  I am shy, but I'm not gay.  I don't think
that clean shaven is much of an indicator, either.  Probably about
80% of what give a gay away is his demeanor.  Other clues, like

conflicts.  The new army tactical strategy is called "Air/Land Battle"
(A/L B).  This is where a war is fought on many fronts, all with thier 
own Air support (which can range from Chinooks to A-10's).  Essentially,
in A/L B all the fighting is done from the air by area attacks (40 mm
grenades from helis, tank attacks and bomb attacks from A-10's).  This
keeps our troops from harms way while still leaving them there for 
clean up operations.  Clearly, the US has the tactical advantage on 
air superiority, and with this, we can conduct A/L B all day long.
  
Oh, by the way...while Iraqi troop strength is (over) estimated at 
about 1 million troops, actually only about 200,000 of them are of 
any use (trained soldiers).  This puts the US in a more favorable light,
seeing as how ALL of our troops are well trained.  (While not in actual
combat...even though they got as close as they could without killing 
each other.)
  
  We can make up the difference with tactical nukes.  Heh, heh, heh.

   No, the term happens to have been more of a psychological term,
similar to Anglophobe, agoraphobe, or pedophobe -- without reference
to the morality (or immorality) of homosexuality, English people,
wide open spaces, or children. Yes, it was taken by the homosexual
community to describe their attackers; but it remains a good
psychological term.
   
   Even if you were a forthright individual, and morally opposed
say... computer criminals, there is no need to be afraid of them.
Even if you fulfilled all of the Ten Commandments, there is no need
to fear covetous people. 
     
   That, sir, is the difference between a "morally upright" person
and a "homophobe."

   Don't worry about the typos. You're doing fine.
   
   First and foremost, I don't want to debate the morality (or
immorality) of homosexuality. What I have found disturbing about
you is that you seem to feel that homosexuality immediately negates
any "good points" for a person. That is, a man or woman might be a
wonderful member of the community, giving generously to churches and
civic organizations, be a wonderful speaker and an easy person to
get along with, be unselfishly devoted to children and pets, and
yet keeps up the schedule necessary for a doctor in the emergency
ward -- and be homosexual -- therefore, the person is scvm. That,
my friend, seems to be homophobia.
      
                  
   Prove me wrong. Say that one's sexual preference is not the most
important thing about oneself.

>And desperately outnumbered...
 
1. Being outnumbered is of little consequence in the type of battle that
   will probably occur (hit fast, and don't clean up afterwards). 
   The Afgahn rebels admirably demonstrated the ability of small fanatic
   forces to fight a prolonged battle, even if dramatically outnumbered
   and outclassed (with regard to weaponry), neither of which apply to 
   the Iraquis.  The length of the fighting depends entirely on how long
   S.H. wants it to.
 
2. The Afgahns had significantly fewer resources and supplies (but were
   admittedly fighting on home territory, wheras the soviets were not)
   than the Iraquis do.  The Iraquis are more familiar with the area, 
   and the military tactics that desert fighting requires than the US or
   allied forces.
 
3. I believe that Nam was considered a 'paint by numbers thing' as well.
   This is too close a conflict for the outcome to be determined before 
   the fact.  I ferverantly hope that the Iraquis back down (thus 
   avioding the other neccesities of a prolonged war), but I do not feel
   that predictions can be accurately made at this point.

There's one thing you're leaving out: food. The Iraqis are most 
certainly not self-sufficient. (Neither are the Kuwaitis.) IF the
economic blockade is successful (which it may not be), then the
Iraqis will have to stop fighting once their reserves of food run
out. We can survive without the Iraqi oil (though it will hurt!), but
they can't survive without our food.

     Few patrons notice the man who enters the bar.  When I see him
pull out a gun I say "Nuuhh...Huuh....GUN!"  Mulligan spins around to
face the man just in time to have the bullet graze his right hip. 
After making a nasty mess of Mulligan's hip, the bullet goes through my
coat, the bar behind, and stops with a shattering of glass.  Mulligan,
with a trickle of blood running down his uniform, ignores the minor
wound and heads toward the rude guest.  Turtle comments, "He sure
doesn't look happy.  You know, this reminds me of a heavy metal song."
     "Arrghh!  My coat, my nice coat" I say, adding "They need some gun

Sir...
  
  I am aware of the origin of "-phobe" words...as anyone else who uses
the English language is.  
  To use the expression "bullshit term" is rather of a crude way of 
saying that the term described (in this case 'homophobe') is a 
nonsense word.  The word has little semantic value...other than what
the gay community can glean from it.  
  Let me elaborate on what I mean.  The word was made up with the 
specific intent to make those who oppose abnormality (in this case
the normal people) look like there was something mentally wrong with 
them, rather than the ones who were morally devoid and mentally 
deficient to start with.  
  
    I don't even know why you brought that word (for lack of a 
better expression) up.

  The lifestyle you described is an admirable one, indeed.  If you

As a matter of fact I don't recall using the word scum.  Although, if
I have, I probably was describing another type of individual.

  What?  How would that be proving you wrong?  I see that you are

  More garbage.  If we go to war, there will be no extended war.  We

(we didn't want to rile the USSR).  As a matter of fact, the Tet

We did NOT do "very well" in Vietnam - despite what your D.I.'s or T.O.
or whatever the hell the Army calls them these days told you.  We got 
our asses kicked for many reasons ( including political considerations )
the most important of which was the 365 day rotation policy.  We kept
reinventing the wheel every 365 days.  Just when our troops became
accustomed to the situation and figured out how to fight the damn war
(oops! that's "police action") we sent them home and shipped in a new
bunch of cherries who couldnt cross a rice paddy w/o stepping on their
dicks.  Of course there was also the problem of inept officers who were
more concerned with getting their CIB than getting the job done...and a
civilian population that hated our guts...and the fact that we were sup-
porting a corrupt government...and then there was the ARVN...well, let's
just say that to blame the final outcome of the Vietnam conflict on
political considerations alone is about as informed as Raven's comparing
the current Middle East situation with Vietnam.

That's manifest bullshit (tm). There can be someone who is a perfectly

I left this message on Rufus' Bbs but since it crashed I'm leaving it
here also to make sure you get it.
   You made a comment on Uncle Bob's that said "homos arent human."
For the last couple weeks you've been arguing that homosexuality is
an illness.  With that comment, I can't help but wonder if you would
also say that epileptics are not human or that cancer patients are not
human?  Or has your insistence that homosexuality is a "sickness" been
merely manifest bullshit (tm) ?
   If you are saying that anyone who suffers from an illness doesnt
qualify as "human," well then bud you just joined the ranks of Saddam
Hussein in the "Pissing Off The Wrong People Dept."
   If it was merely bullshit manifested in an attempt to lend legitimacy
to your arguements then I guess maybe you are just another ignorant
homophobe.
                                    The Yngling
P.S.  In case you're wondering - do I like homosexuals? Not particularly
      .  Do I persecute them? Nope, I just keep my distance as long as
      they keep theirs.  Personally they turn my stomach but I don't
      tell other people what to do in the privacy of their own homes.
      I'm willing to bet there's people that would be outraged at some
      of the things I've done in my bedroom but as long as I don't
      force 'em to watch or do it on the concourse at Desoto Square

Actually, I must apologise...sorry.  I read my message when I logged on
and found that part of a word that I wanted to leave out was still 
included....  
  
  The only reason that I even posted that was because I was trying to
make a joke...again, sorry if I implied the wrong thing.  
  
You are quite right...I don't know you well enough to comment on your 
personal life.  It just strikes me as humorous that you have such a 
good flirtatious rappore with a lot of the guys.  
  
  By the way, the sentence that I was going to write was:
"Promiscuity is not what I am referring to."  But my backspace key and
my return key are close together, and I hit the return by mistake so I 
just decided to leave the line out (it was late and I didn't fell like
(SP FEEL) like messing with it).  
  
"Please understand...I hold you in the highest respect."
  
P.S. to all the guys:  Look guys, don't jump on my case about this...it
was an honest mistake.  I'm sure that many of you will come to BM's 
defence...

OK.  That's it.  EVERBODY LISTEN UP.
  
(THis includes Beatle, Ken, Chip, Max, Turtle, Spellwind, BM, Raven 
and every other ASSHOLE who's been on my case!)
  
1.  I am not a homophobe.
2.  I do not like homos.  I think that they qualify for the "less than
    human award"  for acting less than human (in ways which I will not
    bother to describe in detail).
3.  I have never TOLD any GAY *not* to be gay...I have told them what I
    think of thier actions (and everybody else) and will CONTINUE to do
    so.
3.  I am sick and FUCKING tired of having to argue my position, which is
    based on OPINION and EMOTION.  (Not on logic, mind you, because my
    position SURE as HELL is not LOGICAL.  So stop trying to pick it 
    apart with logic; you can't argue with a crazy man!)
4.  I am not going to change my OPINION in the future, so stop trying to
    "explain
    "explain" your respective points of view to me!  (Explain-hah!  You 
    are badgering me to death!)
  
PS: Raven, did you enjoy this particular blather? I hope so, because it
is the last time I will say anything further about the issue of 
homosexuality. Period.   
  
5.  So if you guys like the term, homophobe, use it to your hearts 
    desire.  I am confident in the knowledge that I am not.  
  
  
Have fun!

   Hmm... this opens up a new line of thought. What's the difference
between 'playing' an instrument and just 'running' one? For example,
you said you just 'run' a drum machine. What about synthesizer? Most
of 'em (Well, the good ones, anyway) have one-key "harmony" sections
where they keep a moving base line, play chords in the rhythm you
choose, and usually keep a full percussion sound afterwards. Are you
really 'playing' anything there?

First and foremost, the term 'homophobe' is neither a bullshit term,
nor does it lack semantic value. For this, I refer you to my original
letter.
Second, it was not created by the homosexual community. It was 
appropriated by the homosexual community (much as the word "furry" has
been by ours), but the original, psychological meaning still lies at
its root. (That is, one who fears homosexuals.) For this, I refer you
to my original letter.
Third, as a psychological term (which is how I wish to use it), it
makes no value judgements about either homosexuality or the fear 
thereof. For this, I refer you to my original letter.
Fourth, some moralities in the world condemn homosexuality. But, so
far as I know, none literally fear it. That is, if you were a perfectly
moral person, it would still be morally proper to be acquaintences --
even friends -- with a homosexual, in the same manner as being 
acquaintences with those who break laws, are disrespectful to their
parents, or disagree with the prevailing opinion. For this, I refer
you back to my original letter.

NBC suits are expected to withstand 30-60 minutes of "intense" exposure
to chemical weapons, so it'd be closer to what Raven is saying, not what
you're saying.  /This/ information comes from Dwight Dutton, a chemical
warfare engineer with Special Forces who's on his way out to Saudi
Arabia now.  100 minutes is possible, but it sounds decidedly
optimistic.  Of course, gas would be likely to dissipate within an hour
after use anyway, so it's not (necessarily) as bad as it sounds.
   Also, of course, a caveat is that those suits have never been tested
against BIOLOGICAL weapons, and the Pentagon doesn't really think they
offer any serious protection against germ warfare (this according to the
newest issue of Newsweek).

I'd assume that Reli /is/ based on	 chromosomes, as I can't imagine any
life form being that close to humans (especially seeing as how we're
talking about an alternate earth story) yet possessing a completely
alien structure.  Chip's argument makes a good devil's advocate line,
but the best response is still, "the author says she ain't a big
housecat, even if she looks like one."  It's easier to think of her as
a cat, just like it's easier to think of Vincent from Beauty & the
Beast as a cat-person (or a whatever-person) than to wrack your brains
trying to work out what his relations to humans, and felines, really is
at a chromosome level.

A long and very nasty spew I wrote to you on Uncle Bob's crashed with
the hard drive.  This is probably just as well.  You got off your
parting rant -- allow me the courtesy of saying something, in a non-
ranting, and hopefully non-offensive way, that hasn't occurred to you.
 
Some of my friends are gay and bisexual.  Every time you posted some
absolute bullshit about "faggots," as far as I was concerned you were
insulting them.  You say you didn't call them "scum," but you pretty
much implied it, didn't you?  You said point blank that you KNEW that
nothing good could come from "them."
 
All my point is that unless you /are/ willing to talk to "them," to see
whether or not your point is right, you don't have any business making
it.  Whether you choose to believe it or not, I /did/ have the same
attitude you did, and I know from experience that a refusal to challenge
your own assumptions is a kind of fear -- it's easier to hate than to
admit that maybe, just maybe, you're overstating things a bit.
 
If I kept your attitude, I wouldn't have some of the friends I have now.
Some of them mean a lot to me.  If I have seemed personally offended by
some of the things you say, it's only because I was.  I know for a fact
you're more intelligent than you've been acting.  Quite frankly, your
"homos aren't human" comment pissed me off a great deal because the
"homos" that I know act a great deal more human than you have been
through this little spew.  Continue in your blindness if you like, but
do NOT continue insulting friends of mine whom you are unwilling to meet
because they are (gasp) different from you.  They deserve better.

  In my opinion, when you sit down and tell a machine to play something
over and over, that is not so great, and I don't /really/ care for it. 
It can be useful, but I don't want to do it. If you can get a thing to 
play back rhythms or melodies and you physically do something to play
accompaniment, then you are playing an instrument. 
  I don't want to program a drum machine. I don't consider some types of
electronic  drums "drum machines." While they may literally be machines,
they have drum pads, and you can  hit them with drumsticks. On a 
computer, you "play" the drums by hitting the keys.

I posted that message before I found out it was changed to Perkins.  You
know, the anime group is much more organized than the furry group.  The
anime folk warn you the day before of changes.  The furry group might
mention it an hour before.  The anime group ORGANIZES things, the furry
group doesn't.  It's a wonder Mythagoras gets off the ground.  Just how

   Yes, but do you see how much more relaxed the furry group actually

BTW - I saw a book, "The Search for Turtle's Navel" (no shit!) at

TS>As a matter of fact, casualties of the VC side weremore than ...
 
Well, to set the record straight, for the most part we got our asses
kicked but good the *duration* of the war.  Matter of fact = we were so
humiliated and upset by our staggering losses in this little "police
action" that a special committee was established to find out why.  To
put it bluntly we
A) Put too much faith in our technology and got our butt kicked by
   weaponry that was modified from the Korean war and we passed off
   as "obsolete".
B) We thought that we were hot shit and had the best damned army/air
force around.  Our /attitude/ lost us a lot of good men.
 
We have fixed a lot of these problems but still must guard against the
fallacy of being the best.  Those people sincerely believe that if the
war is declared a holy war, then if they die in a heroic fashion they
are /guaranteed/ a spot in heaven.  They are acknowledged to be one of
the most fervent followers of any religion on the planet.  I would be
awed by the committment alone.  Besides, even with what the other Arab
leaders say now, what happens when they get told by their religious
leaders that we are bad for what we did?   Hell, it's no secret that we
are doing this for economic reasons.  Personally, think about it...
we are invading another country because we lust after a mineral that
happens to lie under their particular soil and /economically/ it would
be bad for us if they wouldn't let us have any.  One hell of a reason to
throw away thousands if not maybe millions of lives, eh?
BTW - as for where I'm at... I spent 8 years in the Air Force, my dad
spent 25, my uncles spent 25 each in both the Marines and Army.  I
love this country and will go to war for it and the /freedom/ to say
I think that we are warring for a bullshit reason.

I really like Van Halen since they teamed up with Sammy.  I do wish
he would quit trying to /sound/ like DLR tho... I undersatnd that it
is probably in the interest of maintaining a somewhat trademark sound
but you can hear him coming apart on the loud high ones...
