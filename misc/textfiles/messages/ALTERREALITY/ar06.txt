How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop?
This is one of the greater mysteries of Life. The answer, if you're
interested, can be found engraved on a bronze tablet from the ancient
Phoenician empire, now located at the bottom of the Marianas Trench,
where it was cast to prevent it from falling into the hands of the
barbarian invaders during the Great Tootsie Roll Collapse of about 1070
AD. By all means, feel free to go look. I, of course, know what it is,
but I'm not going to tell you.
                       --A guru Turtle
Oh yeah--the answer on the tablet is, for some reason, in octal, not
decimal.

   Well, I consider Pente a very challenging game. You are right, about 
Go-Moku being a more "Well-rounded" game, but there is a LOT of strategy
involved. as for the first person having a definite advantage, BAH! You
just have to know where to place your stone on your first move as the 
second to go. As you recall, the challenger gets the middle crosshair,
automatically, and the next turn can be a move anywhere on the grid.
Like I said, this can be to the second players advantage, depending on
the placement of your stone.

Appears your terminal program and PBBS didn't get along all that well.
/I've/ uploaded messages to Alter Reality, so it is possible, but it
looks like the right edge got lost in translation.
 
Incidentally, I have seen one or two extremely cool QBBS systems.  It's
not all that difficult (it has all the flexibility of Dragonfire coupled
with, well, not having all the kludges of Dragonfire!), it's just that
several sysops locally went out of their way to make it look boring.
Incidentally, the Rendezvous (the prime example of What Not To Do With A
QuickBBS) is down; Mike Talbert sold the entire set-up to somebody else,
apparently without telling anyone ahead of time -- thus screwing up a
lot of echos that were being routed through him.  Ok, so you were right,
he /was/ a bit of an asshole.  (Sorry if there are any Rendezvous fans
out there, but hey, cutting off the Hotline's echo feeds without any
warning was dickish, no two ways about it.).  Corwyn's board might be a
good example of what to do with a QBBS system, although I haven't called
it yet; Thoughts & Images in California is an incredible example of what
you can do with QBBS if you put your mind to it.  (Of course, T&I is
switching to TBBS as soon as he gets the money, because QBBS is a bear
to maintain and he wants to be able to go multiline.  He will also be
the /first/ multiline TBBS in the country to be completely free, so all
those people who thought John Zimmermann was nuts for charging access to
his multiline board should be aware he had lots of company.  In fact,
nobody I've talked to, including sysops on GEnie, is aware of /any/
multiline board that doesn't have at least a one-time access fee--at
least none that stayed up for very long.  Most of them didn't sell their
computer and go underground like Zimmermann did, but that's another
kettle of donuts entirely... :) )

Standard protocols are V.22 for 2400 bps and Bell ...? 212 for 1200.
V.22 for 1200 is used occasionally, but not in this country.  Some
modems are simply picky about different signals; the modem Turtle is
using for this board is usually extremely nice about connecting with
anything remotely resembling a carrier (I know, it was my modem and
still is when I'm in a really bad mood because the modem I'm using is
broken, even though Turtle doesn't see it that way), but it's possible
yours just isn't...

I (masochist that I am) decided to try it out.. I made myself type
"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog." ect.. and even though
I've been /really/ touch typing for about three years on Qwerty keyboard
-'s I was surprised at how easy a lot of the typing was. It just seemed
a lot more logical to use.  The Qwert layout was actually designed to 
slow typists up, and prevent typewriters from jamming... but this layout
seems /so/ superior I'm surprised that it's efficiency hasn't won out 
over qwerty's popularity. Do many professional secrataries use the 
layaout?  Hmm I wonder... Of courst I type this not on my old layout not
Dvorak.. I don't learn that quickly...

Thursday are really useless.  There's never been anything special about
'em.  Rarely does anything exciting happen.  Just what purpose do they
serve?  There's nothing good on TV on Thursdays ( or Friday-Wednesday
either ) except for Mission: Impossible which I watch for no reason.
Of course, if they keep up with the really far out stuff, then I could
go back to the usual toe nail clipping collectors club.

The fastest typists in the world are on Dvorak keyboards, not the
standard "QWERTY" type.  However, since QWERTY was the first one to
become widely popular and had several big companies pushing it back
when typewriters were curiosities rather than accepted business tools,
it became the standard.  The only personal computer I know of that has
a standard Dvorak layout is the Apple //c, which has a switch to toggle
between QWERTY and Dvorak modes.

What would be nice, is a keyboard which has the keyboard letters in the
Dvorak layout... or one w/ removeable keycaps - that can be /put/ in a
Dvorak keyboard layout. Unforutately, my keyboard is neither, so either
I learn the Dvorak layout /quick/ or give up the idea.

You could always repaint the letters on your keyboard.  I know someone

they were forced to learn where the keys were.  I'm just a two finger

isn't all bad for the first few days... it's that or look at a chart, if
you simply /don't/ know where the key is. And it would be those first
few days I'd have to get through... mayber after Christmas when I won't

You can upload to the message base at full 1200 baud, as long as you
pause between lines. (DragonFire won't let you send anything at full
speed.) What you should do, if your term program is capable of it, is
either send the file line by line with a pause at the end of each line,
or send it line by line and have the term program wait for a ":"
character (since PBBS puts one after every line number) before sending
each line.

In assembly (8086 or otherwise) you don't "declare" a buffer, you just
pick a spot in memory that you know isn't being used for anything and
put the characters there. The memory address immediately following the
end of the program is usually a good choice; pick a register, point it
there, and every time a character comes in put it in the byte addressed
by the register and increment the register. Is simple, no? To read a
byte, pull it off the first address in the buffer, move the remaining
buffer down one byte, and decrement the register. Is trivial, really...

That would screw things all to hell; the buffer is still in the same
place, but the 2nd byte has become the first, the 3rd the 2nd, etc., and
you just changed the pointer to point at one byte below the buffer.
What people with working brain cells do is point something at the start
of the buffer (i.e., a register), read the first byte, do something with
it, and then INCREMENT the pointer and keep reading the bytes until you
get to the end.  Doing it by moving the entire buffer would work if you
kept reading the byte at the buffer's bottom -- it would, in effect, be
doing the same thing -- but you'd have to know how big the buffer was
to start with, which isn't always possible, and it'd be a lot slower and
potentially a great deal more complicated (it'd already add overhead if
you use LDIR--what if you're using a CPU without block moves?).  You
know all of this already, so where'd you come up with that tripe?  Wakey
wakey, Mr. Toitle.

And OF COURSE you know how big the buffer is. It's the difference

Greetings! Welcome aboard! Run into you a few times on the gossip
echo, glad you finally decided to call! Pity it wasn't a couple of
minutes later, though; I'd have been around for chatting...
   Anyway, at the moment there's not a whole lot going on in the
Social Issues department. In the Men With Dark Glasses department,
well, my phone line is being monitored by a person or persons
unknown, presumably because somebody somewhere believes I'm a sub-
versive element who's damaging our children. Oh well. Presumably
nobody's going to knock on your door and drag you off by the heels...I
mean, gosh, things like that are only supposed to happen in those
Commie countries, right? Of course, you'd think that things like
incessant phone bugging is only supposed to happen in those Commie
countries, too, but that's a kettle of donuts of a different color...

Dear Miki,
   First of all, tapping is ILLEGAL for the government to do without
a court OK. Secondly, if they have asked the court about a permit to
tap (which I sincerely doubt!), they need to say what, specifically
they are looking for. Unless you are typing messages about hacking,
pirating, or phreaking, I doubt you'd be sent off to Neanderthal land.

   As I've said, abortion is the worst method of birth control. I,
personally, hope that in the future it will NOT be necessary -- that
everyone in the future will be well enough educated in methods of

scientists will develop another 'pill' with fewer side effects. In the

And that it'll get FDA approval, presumably. How about RU-426? Works the
same way ordinary oral contraceptives do, can be used a few weeks after
conception to prevent the zygote from attaching to the uterine wall,
and to date has no known serious side-effects. I defy you to even TRY
to get it approved over here.

Actually, two of those yells were really funny...the one where he meets

Well, actually, he's not. I talked to him about 3 days ago; evidently
he has some sort of job lined up elsewhere, or MAY have some sort of
job lined up elsewhere, or some such thing. At any rate, the upshot of
all of that is he isn't planning on coming down here any time in the

yea, well, I was going to leave you a message last night, but seeing how
our friends at FiPiL denied us power for 2 hours, I couldn't.  I was in 
the middle of that message when the power went phoomp ( yea, it actually
went phoomp ).  I'll see if the folks say O.K. and call back here 
before 5:30 p.m. ( you have my # if you need to call )

From the looks of things, you, Sir, wouldn't know a hacker if one bit
you on the ass. I have to wonder about a person who spells "cracking"
"krackin'", in a public message on a bulletin board WHOSE LOGON SCREEN
TELLS YOU THAT THIS PHONE LINE IS BEING MONITORED!! Quite frankly, Sir,
I am amazed you can actually work a computer. It is gentlemen like you
who give us REAL hackers a bad name.
 
Have an amazingly pleasant day, Sir.

Well, I never believed I would actually see it, but as of RIGHT NOW 
Sat Dec. 23 at 8:20 PM it is SNOWING out side my door! Yes, here in 
Sarasota FL! The flakes are small, and not very well formed, but it IS
only 8:00 with a promise of -10 degree wind chill factor for tonight
here in this area. I hope that everyone around here gets to see the snow
falling here, as it is a VERY rare happening, but it is expected to 
happen for several hours on into the early morning. Well, I'm going now
to go watch it somemore, as this is the first time in my life that I
have seen it snow here, this far south. Hope everyone sees it!

Well, first of all, nothing was meant to offend.
2nd:  "Cracking" has two spellings, in the pirate world...
3rd:  You cannot get arrested for talking about a subject, only if you 
partake in the subject being discussed.
4th:  I am a Computer Science major at a rather reputable engineering
school.  Beleive me, unfortunetly I know what a hacker is...
5th:  I'm sorry for being interested in a rather taboo subject. In
my younger years I was very active and knew many a famous pirate, I
was just wondering if there was anyone "active" around here... It would
be interesting to hear some "stories".
 
Don't worry, you won't get busted for just talking...  I wanted to raise
some eye-brows and I see I did!!
 
Merry Christmas,

I saw it to.  In fact, I collected enough snow to make a very small snow
ball, which I used to hit my dad.  Boy, if it woulda been any bigger, I
coulda caused some real damage.  My dad ( who's been here for 28+ years)
says this is the most he's seen in Sarasota.  I think it has snowed 
twice before in Sarasota.
And to think Bart Fox went to Ohio for a white Christmas!

Me 'tinks ets time t' move further south.  I moved here from Oregon, and
as find this weather to be a pain in the ass.  Cold & dry I like, Hot
and either dry or humid is good, but this cold and humid crap is a real
pain in the arse!  (Oh, by the by, my grandmother, who grew up in
Bradenton, did not believe that it was half their temperature here, and
David Kone's jaw hit the ground when he called last night).  A HEAVY
sbowfall would have been wonderful (what would SRQ do w. it?); imagine
all these people who have _never_ had to deal w. icy roads, and have 
problems w. wet ones. . .

Well, I'm departing soon to go down to Fort Myers and do the "spend your
Christmas with friends and family" thang, so the board will be on
autopilot for a while. Anyway, have a good, if cold, wet, miserable,
damp, SNOWY, freezing, gray, gloomy, dreary, grim, harsh, windy, chilly,
wet, wretched, and not terribly sunny Christmas, y'all, and I'll be back
in a few days!

Hot, with a very heavy, nah, torrent like, rainfall!

And I hope your BBS will set itself up if the power goes, cause FPL may
or may not continue (sp?) with "Let'

about 12 power outages within 5-6 minutes.  I'm glad I didn't have my
computer on or I woulda been really angry.

Actually, no.  RU-426 needs to be administered with another drug to
obtain high success rates (can't remember what the other one is, I'll
look it up -- but THAT must be administered intravenously).  Without
the interaction of the other drug RU-426 has only about a 60% success
rate.

Well, All, it's been an interesting Christmas season. While busily
unwrapping gifts and doing the Christmas dinner thing, I hope you all
had time to reflect upon some of the finer points of Christmas, like:
 
Why are all Christmas cards you see in Hallmark stores either trite or
banal, or at worst can only aspire to triteness or banality? I swear, if
I see one more card with the phrase "special friend," the words "Holiday
cheer," "Yuletide cheer," or anything "Spirit," I'm going to scream
and put the cat through the wall. Yeech! Shopping for Christmas cards
is a nightmare. I am thinking of starting my own line of unorthodox,
CREATIVE holiday greeting cards, Death To You All Enterprises, to 
combat the evil scourge of sappy holiday yeech. (Look for them wherever
Bill the Cat stuffed toys are sold.) Our product line is, of course,
confidential, but here's one guarantee: you won't see a fat man who
plays with elves on any of 'em!

Well, sorry I took so long in replying to your last post; I've been out
to lunch for the last several days. One at a time, from the top:
>...when can I get my tape back?
By all means, come over and pick it up. My car is dead; you see, it
gallantly sacrificed its life to rescue this innocent young lady from
these Hells' Angels bikers, and...well, no, I'm making that up. Actually
it has a broken clutch.
>I hope your BBS can set itself up if the power fails...
Nope. Sure 'nuff, I came back the day after Christmas and the 'pooter
was patiently waiting for someone to type in the date. If you called
on Christmas and didn't get anything, well, it serves you right for
calling on Christmas instead of digging for loot in the first place.
Bleah.

Well, I don't know about Awqk, but Yarg is a way of saying "The pre-
ceeding flame is high in sarcasm and should not be taken seriously by
members of Congress, the Moral Majority, or anybody else, for that
matter." As in:
 
Assembly is the only TRUE computer language! Real men use Assembly for
everything! Anyone who would use anything else is a semi-intelligent
putz who wouldn't know a real program if it bit him on the ass! People
who use high-level languages are worthless and weak! People who WRITE
high level languages are illiterate anal retentives who were potty
trained at gunpoint! Assembly is best for /everything/! NO self-
respecting person would EVER even CONSIDER using some wimpy inferior
language! Yarg! Yarg!
