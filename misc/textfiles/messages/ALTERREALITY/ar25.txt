It's rather easy to hold a potluck in a chemistry room.  Just have
people bring food into the room.  That's it.  Why have it in there?
I suppose it would be easy to heat stuff, what with all those bunsen
burners [lemme tell ya, it does wonders on fondue!].  And the Chem.
room may have been the only one with a fridge and oven and stove.

I believe Sigourney Weaver was contracted to appear in Alien III, but I
don't know whether or not she's starring.  I haven't heard anything
about the project since the writers' strike in 1988, during which
William Gibson had stopped working on the script.
   Incidentally, Sam Hamm (scripter for BATMAN) also stopped working on
the second draft of ol' Bats during that strike, and the "co-writer"
of the screenplay in the credits never worked with Hamm at all -- he was
essentially a "scab."  A lot of the boneheaded ideas in the final
version as compared to the original screenplay, most notably making the
Joker the murderer of Wayne's parents and the removal of Wayne's more
psychotic elements -- along with some of his characterization -- came
from this co-writer, who had a decidedly more Hollywood bent than Hamm
does.

Xanadu was a song by ELO, sung by Olivia Newton-John.  It was about a
divinely ordained roller skating rink and had nothing to do with the
poem "Kubla Khan", despite what this weird paper about rock versions of
Colerige poems I read at New College claimed.  The paper complained
that the song was really bad and had nothing to do with the poem.  It
WAS a fairly lame song (beastly complicated music that you wouldn't be
able to tell by listening to it, but the lyrics, er, weren't), but it
wasn't SUPPOSED to have anything to do with the poem.  I hate it when
people misinterpret classic literature by soft rock/country crossover
artists from Australia, especially when they're really pretty soft
rock/country crossover artists from Australia.

Of course, I should talk.  I had a dream within a dream last night.  I
woke up from one dream to discover I was lying on my futon (footon?

it a moment later to find myself lying on my futon with Tyler, Dan,
Bart and Wratt all asleep around me.  This, however, was reality, or
what passed for it.  The original dream was gone by this point, but I
could remember only two vague impressions from the top level of the

> Libertarianism is usually considered more right-wing than left wing...
 
Depends on who you ask.  Libertarianism runs the gamut from Abbie
Hoffman to Atilla the Hun, as its political philosophy isn't inherently
connected to the subjects liberals and conservatives usually find to
disagree on.  It's "conservative" in the sense that liberals are usually
presumed to like big, intrusive government and conservatives aren't,
but the Reagan era seems to have shown that conservatives can be just as
good as making government big -- they just concentrate on different
parts.  People on	 either side can come to the conclusion that a minimal
government in ALL areas might, in the long run, be better than a huge
one, regardless of whether or not more is spent on defense or welfare.
Those people are libertarians, or potential libertarians.  You are
quite likely to find libertarians who are pro-choice and anti-gun
control, which is something "conventional" liberals and conservatives
are often confounded by.
   Of course, since you're unlikely to see this message, sending it to

This is something I'd /heartily/ agree with.  If you stick your nose
into a subject in what would sure as heck SEEM to be a serious fashion,
especially if you do it in a manner directly attacking another BBS user
(or his messages, or even general beliefs), you have to be prepared for
people to take you seriously.  Coming on after the fact and saying,
"Gosh, it's sure nice to see all these people posting, you weren't
really taking me literally, were you?" is, if nothing else, kind of
odd.  This nebulous concept of "tone" DOES come through in writing, and
if you're writing a fairly long message on	 a fairly touchy subject --
especially if you're being critical of somebody else, for Pete's sake --
making sure you're saying it in the way you intend it is only logical.
A cynical person would say that a "ha-ha, I wasn't serious" post is just
a way to back down and try to save face after you've decided that you
were either wrong or came across a lot more strongly than you had
intended, but don't want to apologize for fear it'll make you look like
you're changing your position.  But, not being a cynical person in the
least, I wouldn't think that.  Ever.

Orcs are short, too.  Depending on who you ask. Some books and games
have them at dwarf size; others have them up to 7 feet tall.  The world,
even in the realm of Generic Fantasy Adventure <tm>, does not revolve
around products from TSR.  You will eventually learn that plots and
ideas that make great Dungeons & Dragons adventures make kind of bad
stories if you're at all concerned with things like, oh, character
development, originality, etc.  Hell, even Weis & Hickman left the
realm of AD&D.  They still need to work on one, JUST ONE, book that's a
cyberpunk sf novel or some such, but the stuff that they're doing now
in things like DRAGON WING is stuff that TSR would never do.  DRAGON
WING is reasonably well-written from a technical standpoint, and from
an imagination and characterization standpoint, it's pretty damn
impressive, even in spite of kludgy narration problems.
   ...of course, it's still in a lot of trouble when compared to
anything by Orson Scott Card, or even Barbara Hambly.

That was a joke, Son. The John Birch society is a hyper-paranoid,
hyper-conservative organization that's centered around a blinding
hatred of the Soviet Union. They constantly publish propaganda
explaining why we are actually at war with the Reds, and why Commies
and liberals should be executed or driven out of the country. Anyway,
they are named after a U.S. soldier (John Birch) who was accidentally
killed by Soviet troops at the end of World War II; the John Birchers
claim that he was actually the first casualty of WWIII rather than
the last casulty of WWII. All in all, a remarkable bunch of

 That may be true about Star Wars and Star Trek and Dr. Who and Star 
Trek, but to say Star Trek and the Next Generation can't be cross 
referenced like that is stupid. They are almost one and the same. That's
the way the creators saw it: as an extension of the Trek universe. That
term universe used as a reference to a body of fictional characters and 
incidents related. Such as the Star Wars universe is not the same as the
Doctor Who universe.

I've only read three books by Barbara Hambly (the "Time of the Dark"
series) and they didn't impress me THAT much.  They were fairly good,
but the Dark was completely unmotivated -- nebulous evil-for-evil's-sake
as an antagonist generally bothers me (Card & Tolkien can get away with
it, but they're also writing in a much more mythically-conscious way
than Hambly was), and I couldn't shake the impression	 that the main
character was a shadow of Hambly herself; wish-fulfillment stories, even
when well-done, make me twitch just a little.  I've also grown to be
suspicious of books with the general plot skeleton of person-from-this
world-goes-into-a-high-fantasy-world-and-discovers-his/her-hidden-powers
in-a-battle-against-ultimate-evil stories; I've seen it done really well
exactly twice, once in Marion	 Zimmer Bradley's "House Between the
Worlds" and once in Stephen Donaldson's "Mordant's Need"--the latter of
which wasn't, actually, against ultimate evil.  I also think he did it
really well in "Thomas Covenant", but I seem to be among the minority on
this BBS in believing the series' good points outweigh its problems.
Most of those problems went away in "Mordant's Need", although it wasn't
as grandly theologically metaphysically mythical as "Covenant" was (some
might say that's a change for the better, of course).

That's because they are not in the same universe when you are speaking
in a creative sense instead of an obstinately literal one.  Technically,
none of them are in ANY universe because they're fictional.  Remember?
Both "Star Trek" shows are in the same universe because they're created
by the same writer(s), share the same history, and one is supposed to
take place a few generations after the other one.  Look at it this way:
Spider-Man's story is set on	 modern-day earth.  So is the CBS sitcom
"Murphy Brown."  But that alone doesn't mean they're going to be
connected in any way, shape or form; for practical purposes, they are
in different universes.  Likewise, just because "Star Wars", both "Star
Trek" series, "Battlestar Galactica" and Ken Mitchroney's "Space Ark"
funny animal comic all take place in space doesn't make them in the
same universe.
   As for the Star Treks, /obviously/ they have a plot relation.  They
are in the same Federation, the same "universe" in any sense of the
word.  Do you think "Alien" and "Aliens" had no relation and didn't
refer to one another?  They are SEQUELS.  Likewise, "Star Trek" and
"The Next Generation" are SEQUELS to one another, in much the same way
"Battlestar Galactica" and the decrepit "Galactica 1980" were sequels.

The deadline for submissions for issue #2 of MYTHAGORAS is June 14.
We are looking, especially, for artwork and any certain stories that
involve fox morphs that female BBS users talked to Mythagoras' own fox
morph, Bartholomew, about.
 
Stuff to look for in issue #2 that we already have: an 8-page comic
story, "Deception," by Chuck Melville; the beginning of a hard sf
serial by the mysterious mad professor, Lawrence Schoen; a fantasy
horror short, "Of the Father, Upon the Son," by Kevin Higgins; art by
Juan Alfonso, Maggie de Alarcon, Eric Blumrich and others.  Other
subjects to-be-written or submitted & under consideration include a
response to Franklin Veaux's "Object-Oriented Environmentalism" from
issue #1, an article about environmentalism and animal rights as
viewed through science fiction	 and comics by, er, Watts Martin, and a
certain story involving fox morphs that a female BBS user talked to
Mythagoras' own fox morph, Bartholomew, about.

Sheesh did I say that?!!!  Sorry - I get really fritzed trying to 
banzai thru here and make sense at the same time.  I get the impression
that Chip thinks I wasd referrin to him when I said no one was inter-
ested in a philosophical conversation - I gotta clear this up but first 
I gotta catch up!  I use the NIV which has been critically called a
"design by committe Bible, a Ryrie and the KJ versions with the
Thompson chain reference and the Schofield study systems.  Alas , I 
consider myself truant the last couple of years in my studies.  As
a small sideline - continued reading and meditation on the Bible can
be interesting in it's own right (ie non-religious).  As an example
the book of Job isn't really understood to be either factual (there
is evidence that says it is) or allegorical (plenty to belive here!).
A small interesting study is on the background of Jobs three "friends".
Their ancestry says that they probably had no love for any of Yahweh's
"chosen".  So what is their true relationship and how does this affect
the general "plot"?  Stuff like this interests me when I have the time
to dig around.  I think a lot of people find the Bible a "hard" book.
I was really turned on to it in a new light when I took it as an 
advanced Literature course (graduate level) in college.

Do you have the /slightest/ idea of that which you mumble?  The Mormons
are considered a cult by "mainstream" Christian groups.  They have been
beating their drums for the past 150 years or so and isn't anything
new.  I have no idea of where you gleaned the fact they kill their
relatives to "save" them unless you refer to their practise of research
into their family tree and baptism by proxie for those that did not
hear their beliefs here on earth.
Also: what 10 rules do you refer - the ten commandments?  The entire 
book of Leviticus consists of Jewish law - the 10 commandments were
the "catchy" phrases.  The entire Christian belief as taught by Christ
was stated as the Golden Rule - "Love thy neighbor as you love yourself"

Sheesh - it had nothing of ther ring of "commandment" tyo it at all.
It was merely a clever way to make the Pharisee's look like the dweebs
that they were and to emphasize the spiritual nature of God.  The
Pharisee's (and the Jewish culture in general) had this belief that 
God's pleasure with you was directly reflected in wealth.  This is
why Job's neigbors and such really figured he had done something 
really terrible to be in the shape he was in (he lost it all).  Jesus
was merely pointing out to the Pharisee's that Taxes had nothing to do
with the kingdom of God.  Essentially the thrust was to trick Jesus into
either being a traitor (pay taxes like a good roman citizen) or a
rebel (refuse to pay tribute!).  Hope this made sense,,,

This is also true of many (most) theistic religions.  Wicca isn't
supposed to be an attempt to tune into the cosmic consciousness all
religions are based on, it's just supposed to be The Truth, Q.E.D.
That doesn't necessarily mean that it's true.  And, the common threads
between it and Christianity don't necessarily mean it's a "shadow" of
Christianity in some Lewis-ian sense; if it could be construed that way,
the reverse (Christianity as a Wicca shadow) could also be true.
   I've also never completely bought the "well, Christianity has to be
true because its claims are so outrageous they have to be" line of
reasoning.  That's a patently hokey argument if you use it to defend,
say, advertiser claims or any run-of-the-mill crackpot religion.  No,
actually, I've /never/ bought it.  It just doesn't hold water; by making
outrageous it's-this-or-nothing claims, it makes people pay attention to

"House Between the Worlds" was a really good--and BIZZARE--book. It
seemed to have set out to turn a lot of the "person-from-our-world-

I /love/ the scene where the main character uses a bootleg drug to

I've read her "Dark Tower" "The Silicon Mage" and (hmm can't remember
the name of the last in the trilogy) but it wasn't as good as her 
'Witches of Wenshar' in my book. She took the theme of a Wizard who 
didn't want to be. I the first trilogy, (The Dark Tower) the evil is 
quite well represented as a greedy guy who get's ahead of himself, 
he's pretty powerful, but not nebulous at all. Like I said, It's hard
to think of anyone doing better than Card (for me anyway) There are 
books I like, (Like the Myth-Adventures series) and there are books 
which really impress me.. and they don't necessarily coincide. 
 Anyway.. Read her series on Sun Wolf, I've got the book club "The

The KJ Bible itself is something of a problematic beast...it was
TRANSLATED by committee, and one that frequently took an ad-hoc
hit-or-miss approach to translation. It also doesn't help that the
KJV is in several places a third generation translation--the translators
frequently didn't have access to the Hebrew texts, and had to translate
from the Latin Vulgate bible and the Greek scriptures. (The Vulgate
itself was rife with errors, and some of 'em managed to creep into the
KJV; for example, the name of the Christian devil is not "Lucifer."
The word "Lucifer" appears only in Job and the passage in which it
appears is a study in translation error.) It also doesn't help that in a
few places the translators /deliberately/ garphled the text to avoid
offending King James...

Until he was a big bunny
and he ate Mr. Funny.
Soon, the townspeople asked how

had died.
Until, one night, he was eyed.
The rumor was spread
why so many were dead.
Most folks got read to run,
but Mr. Jones got his gun.
Mr. Jones saw the bunny and blew off his head.
And finally, the bunny was dead.

A change on the deathbed, however, is of little signifance as it only 
applies to one's last few hours, and has no bearing on how one has lived
one's life.  Deathbed conversion is the ultimate form of hypocracy, as 
one is denying everything one has held true, and claiming that this will
make it all better now.  
 
I do not believe that a life-long sadist could absolve himself by merely
'converting' to a religion for the last few hours of their life.

I think we are given a warnin after death, but before whatever comes
next.  My mother was clinicaly dead when she was having my sister.
She relates the story of seeing herself from above, very peacefully.
But she had a great longing to be back with her daughter.  So she
went away from this light that she had seen, and back into her own
body.  I believe her experience to be true.  She was dead for a short
time.  Now you can choose to believe what you want.  But I think it
was a choice she had to make.  So perhaps we can't change our religious
views before death, but maybe we can postpone death for awhile.  
(There is an interesting article in June '90 "Discover" on the
>the search for eternal youth< very plossible.  Anyway, since this
isn't really controversial stuff, I leave the rest to the "GLOBE"...
 
            By for now,
                    Tree
P.S. my sister is three years older than me.  My mother made a good 
desision, otherwise I might have been born an EAR MITE, or something
equally noxiouse.

Okay...there was an episode whose name I don't know which involved a
bunch of renegade Klingons attempting to overrun the Enterprise...Whorf
displayed admirable fighting skills there...
 
Of course, it /still/ doesn't really matter all that much; Kirk may have
been the best barroom brawler in the galaxy, but he was still a lous
(oops, LOUSY) starship captain. His ship was taken over, overrun,
diverted, and wrested away from him by a bunch of hippies so often
it's a miracle he wasn't court-martialed. You'd think he would have
learned not to let everyone who beams aboard his ship have access to
the auxiliary bridge...and the manual "How To Take Over the Enterprise
Without the Lech and the Pointy-Eared Fellow On the Bridge Catching On"

Yes, the Enterprise should have a cloaking device, for what it's worth.
Cloaking technology doesn't really seem to be all that far advanced
in the 23rd century (like I should talk...we got the Stealth bomber
that can be picked up by a ground radar installation twelve miles
away...); how often does it really seem to matter that the various
nasties are cloaked? "Captain, the Romulan ship has cloaked, but I think
I can compensate by patching the sensor system into this Ginsu
combination alpha-wave integrator and toaster oven..." Still, it'd
probably be helpful against some of the Federation's dumber opponents,
like, say, the Ferengi and Ken Ober...

No big thing, and it adds little to this discussion, but there are 
several organisims more advanced than planaria which are asexual. There 
are a number of amphibians and reptiles which are totally parthinogenic.
Every single member of the species is a female, and the exact genetic
copy of each other (the posibility of mutation exists though). This is
true of several geckos (lizards) and some newts. I don't know how they
feel about violence but they are carnivores even if they don't vote.

Yes, but for the wrong reasons--and he was acquitted. Kirk should

and for using a Federation Starship for personal ends (Amok Time)...

That's because it's a Godawful bad translation. I don't think there
are /any/ translations of the Bible other than the KJV and its
offspring that mention Lucifer, though...that would be totally
against the entire Hebrew belief system. The ancient Hebrews believed
that to know a thing's name is to have power over that thing (hence
God asks Adam to name all his earthly creations, thereby giving Adam
power over them); to know the name of God or Satan is to claim to have
power over them, which is blasphemy.
 
"Lucifer" is Latin for "light giver," and is the Latin name for the
Eastern Star. That particular word is an artifact of the Vulgate
Bible and no analog of it can be found in any older document. (Think
about it..."Lucifer" is not a Hebrew name by a long shot!)

#1 - I happen to be *extremely* busy at this time.  I've rapped with
Turtle about how hard it is to keep up when the stuff is flying fast
and furious and I can't get on the board for a couple of days.  If
this is "running" from the issues - sorry for the perception but I
have a hell of a lot of programming to do at work (some even at home).

Actually - It doesn't really matter WHAT you think - you and I are not
in a position to determine the sincerity of the persons belief or in
fact anything about the person.  The traditional Christian viewpoint
that even many Christians have trouble understanding is that grace
and absolution of sins really is free.  I have heard more people grumbel
that "such and such" couldn't possibly deserve it and couldn't possibly
get it at the last minute like that - wrong!  It is a free gift so why
begrudge it to someone else?  It doesn't affect you so ditto.  Matter 
of fact - the whole process is not dependant on anyone except that 
individual and Jesus.  Kinda like complaining that since your
neighbor is a jerk flowers should die in his flowerbed...

Aborting a message only lets you take back something before anyone else
has seen it.  If you've already put your foot in it and people are
jumping on your ass -- either because they don't agree with your point
or because you phrased your point in a way that pissed them off,
intentionally or not -- it's too late to abort the message; you're
either stuck defending the point you made badly (or even defending a
point you didn't mean to make at all), apologizing, or trying to find a
way to back away from the stance without apologizing, like, "Gosh, how
could you all take that so seriously" or "It's so nice to see my trick
of getting conversation	 going again worked."  This, of course, can piss
people as much as the original message did.

The tests used to determine IQ are gaged to whatever age you are testing
It is not likely that an IQ will change much over someone's lifetime.
It is a measure of how well you can learn and how well you will retain
it....it is not a quantitative measure of knowledge as you may be
implying. I know people with high-100's IQs that couldn't get a

Yes, lots of problems with the KJ translations.  But considering the
times and the limited amount of time allotted the committee, they
did tolerably well.  Despite many flaws in accuracy, in my opinion
it's still the most beautiful translation available in the English
language (that's from a literary standpoint).  I have problems
reading many of the contemporary translations.  I guess I'm old-
fashioned, but I don't really want to read that Mary was preggers,
I prefer her being 'with child'.
   What really irks me are the churches that use the paraphrased
Bibles as their main texts.  All the generations of scholarly
research to try to get the most accurate translations ... and some
bozos come along and paraphrase it any old way they want just to
make 'their' interpretation the ONLY one.  And generally these are
the same churches that preach the Bible is 100% accurate and
infallible and handed down directly from God.  Argggh!

I find it interesting that your third choice re:controversial posts
is the only one you say will 'piss people as much as the original
message."
   Seems that point one (defending your position) is pointless after
three rounds... worse, it's BORING and people get tired of it.  Point
two, apologizing, would be hypocritical if you truly believed in your
original message.  This might not piss-off people who like to be
kow-towed to, but hypocrisy from a friend I find unacceptable and
insulting.  Choice three is trying to get past the unpleasantness
with good spirits.  Would you truly prefer arguements with no

You are correct... not all death is can be postponed.  But I was not
refering to tramatic deaths.  A cardiac arrest is tramatic, but it
is not do to unforseable circumstances.  Nor does it usually have any
thing to do with massive hemoraging.  Nearly all deaths are directly
related to the heart stopping.  The only death I can not think of
that is not caused by the heart stopping in some way or another
is a severe head trauma.  Anyway, our mind can control our involentary
muscles such as the heart, the diaphram ect.  Studies in biofeedback
have shown that our mind can do many things... yes it is
> /neat/ 
what our brain can do.  So, if we can control those muscles in a 
relaxed situation, why couldn't we control them when our bodies are
dead, but our brain is still barely functioning.  Who knows what our
brain is capable of doing.  Most people don't even use 75% of their
brain, so who is to say what we can a can't do.
One thing we can do to postpone death is not to step out in front of
an onrushing train!

I meant 3 books a week.  But that aside,  when I read a book, I do
not look at the individual letters, or even the individual words for
the most part.  Rather I look at groups of words, sometimes whole
sentences.  Even then, I am looking for concepts and Ideas.  Syntax
is important to be sure.  But when one reads quite a bit and writes
rarely, one tends to overlook things like spelling. 
   By the way, the only valid IQ tests deal only in symbols... universal
symbols.  People should not judge other people by how they speak, if
the people who are judging do not know the people language who they
are judging, then it would not matter how inteligent the person was,
the person would sound like a gibbering idiot.  Use of Language is
not a valid indication of IQ.   But I agree that it can help get an
Idea across.

I agree, some of it *sounds* pretty weird.  Like there are several books
listed that purport to be "messages" from a "wise, kind, loving etc ad
nauseum" race that live "in the future/past/galaxy/alternate universe"
that want to show us the way.  The "message" is usually received by
telepathy which I guess is still more *respectable* than channelling.
Lemme see - oh yeah one race is cat people (morphs!!!), another kinda
resembles the Mayans but are "much older" - sheesh.
 
Some other strange reading is to be had if you pusue Kabbalism.  I got
interested in the allegation that when Christ impressed the Rabbis at
the age of 12 he was indoctrinated into the Essene sect.  Now the Essene
sect are known as the Jewish Mystics and Tarot cards, and Kabbalism
(orders of like - The Golden Dawn) claim to be related and descended
from the Essenes plus teachings that are far older than recorded
Hebrew faith.  Anyway - you wanna see some strange stuff about treading
the universe in the spacecraft of your imagination - it's all there.

Screeeeetttttttccccchhhhhhhhhhh!  Slam on the brakes whoa!!!!
#1 - While there may well be "snobbish geniuses" in MENSA, that is NOT
     what it is for.  It is simply a social forum for intelligent people
     along with some research into IQ and the gifted plus some work
     with young people (like in school).
#2 - I seem to recall that I stated my IQ did not qualify me for DIDDLY
     except MENSA membership.  My common sense, wit, panache and general
     aura of benevolent charisma is what qualifies me as "better".
#3 - being short and not good at any sports hardly qualifies as faults.
     They are simply conditions that shaped your life in ways that 
     reflect *your* perception of yourself and *your* attitude towards
     coping with life.
#4 - Dropping out of High School was a decision on your part that is
     a direct indicator of a lack of common sense on your part - and
     frankly puzzles me in a discussion on IQ.
 The whole intent of my message was simply to state my belief that the
figure of "180 IQ" was:
A) Some really weird test that gives outrageous numbers to stroke your
   ego. (let's see... if I  use pi as a multiplier does that give it the
   blessings of the ancient Greeks?)
B) You made it up to try and impress/intimidate someone.  Bad course of
   action on a board where most of the denizens really are of a higher
   mental calibre than J.Q. Public.

I sincerely hope that Turtle gets off his butt and starts the Best of
Altered soon or I will have to volunteer.  That line about Mary deserves
to be in it...  I think the whole idea behind the paraphrased Bibles is
for people that complain about how hard the language is and how they 
can't understand it.  These are the Pablum Christians that are waiting
for someone to spoon-feed them what they should believe. This is how
jerks like Bakker get into power and unfortunately tragedies like
Jonestown happen.  The Bible is one of those books that has to be read
in the context of what you are trying to get out of it.  You wanna read
a story - there are a lot of pretty good ones - some pretty racy.  Take
, for example, after the flight from Sodom & Gomorrah and Lot's wife
was turned into a pillar of salt.  I will leave it an an exercise to 
the interested to read what Lot's daughters decided about dear old dad.
Remember that they are a product of the environment of Sodom & Gomorrah

I beg to differ sir.  Why do you think that it apparent to all on this
board?  Reading is fundamentally an exercise in pattern matching.  If
the pattern is flawed then the reading process is interrupted while the
offending bit of ink gets studied an extra millisecond or so.  To do
this - the brain calls on higher level functions and thus it is "noticed
If what you say is true - you don't notice - then your lower level
functions are either in control totally , in which case they should be
sent to Siberia to do time for their impudence - or the higher functions
are playing golf/looking at pretty girls and should be locked in a
closet with an abacus and not let out until they have computed pi to
the 90'th decimal place.
   All recognized IQ tests have MOSTLY symbolism as the vehicle.  MENSA
even goes to the extent to give you at least 2 supervised tests one of
which (in my case ) was British - I guess to measure what effect 
cultural differences made in the administering of the test.

dancing - mostly because I never learned (I was always in the band or

I like to walk/hike/camp out, bike ride/sunday drive, I even like

     Pattern matching, hmmmm.  Correct, i'm sure you are right.  But
the fact is, I am an artist.  If I were to look at each individual
brush stroke every time I looked at one of my paintings, I would never
get finished.  This is not to say that It does not take a long time
to do a piece of art, because it does.  Now as to how this relates to
what you were speaking of,  the fact is that most artist start with
broad, bold strokes.  They try not to limit themselves until the very
end of the picture.  Now, that is not to say that our higher brains 
are out to lunch, but it does mean that both conscience, and un-
conscience  parts of the brain are working in tandem.  Many people
deny their sub (not un)conscience  completely.  And many criminals,
habitual drug users ect. deny there conscience or upper brain level
functions.  Now, when I read a book, I let both my conscience and
subconscience absorb the words.  (and or patterns which are actually
SYMBOLS)  Now think of your brain as a spellchecker on Word Perfect.
Suppose you were typing along at a furiouse pase.  Now this typing
is actually the relating of a thought.  Spellchecker is trying to
keep up with you.  It could not possibly, as you said the brain 
slows down and tries to call on a higher brain function.  But the
higher brain says "Wait Im trying to think about my own thought here
(the sentence), leave me alone, well do lunch or something), so the
brain merrily passes over the misspelling and continues to type out
the Idea.  Ahhh, now we get to a period, the brain says hold on, I
have time for a Ham and Cheese sandwich, maybe I'll check my spelling!
Nahh, my Ideas are to important, I have to get them out of my head
before they fragment!  Now this, I believe is why I have trouble 
spelling, and why it does not bother me if someone else is a poor
speller!  Perhaps you did hit on something when you mentioned a
culteral difference.  Spelling and use of word could be directly related
to ones culture.  Not a new thought!

Co-existing with all creatures and co-existing with science and

destroy us any more than a dolphin's dolphin-ness can destroy the race
of dolphins, and reverting back to pre-technological days (assuming this
is what you're implying) will not help things.  After all, we weren't
aware of how badly things were going for the planet until we had enough
scientific knowledge to learn the damage we were doing to the biosphere,
and until fairly recently, we didn't have the technology to reverse it.
If the planet had the same population level it does now -- or even the
same population	 level it had in, say, the '50s -- and we had the same
*knowledge* level that we had before the industrial revolution -- well,
we probably wouldn't have made it to the '90s to begin with.  What can

I've seen debates (not necessarily on this BBS) where people end up
saying things they don't really agree with because they start feeling
defensive; this usually happens because they jumped into an discussion
in a way that immediately turned it into an argument.  Sometimes
apologizing for what has been said is the most logical option, but it's
one that almost nobody ever takes.  Also, as I (think I) said, the
apology may well be for the way the point was made, not for the point
itself; a lot of people would rather duck the issue with a "gosh, I was
just kidding" type line than say, "I guess I said that a little too
strongly, and I'm sorry about that."

I've seen some of those; I think it's generally better to erase the
entire message and start over if you get to that point, assuming you
think the point is worth saving.  It is very easy to be over-strident
in debates, especially, it seems, in BBS debates.  This might be because
you can't gauge how others involved are reacting to what you say while
you're saying it, and it's very easy to post long stretches of purple
prose passionately defending your point when nobody can stop you in
process to say, "you're going overboard here."  Despite the fact that
you have a lot longer to compose responses, it is paradoxically a lot
easier to put one's paw in one's mouth on a BBS, too -- and, it seems,
a lot harder to remove it.,

Humanity won't last forever; eventually the world will in fact be free

of the indigent life on this planet when we go, but that's no biggie;
mass extinction is nothing new (no land animal with a body mass of over
about 13 kg or so survived the dinosaurs...) We may also physically
destroy the planet itself, but that's unlikely, and in any event is
a risk any planet runs anyway...we may work out our differences and
get splattered into eternity by a rogue asteroid (just like in the video
game). No big deal; just wait around long enough and you'll get your

That's not true; while that's the way the theory goes, it seems that
the younger the testee the more likely he is to get a higher score. My
IQ was tested at around 150 when I was in 1st grade and at 132 in
junior high...figure at that rate it should be about 76 now (applying
statistical formulae upon those two points, of course). I am inherently

Not if the heart has stopped functioning because its blood supply has

commands from your brain very well any more.
 
>Most people don't use 75% of their brains...
 
I /HATE/ that!!! I see it everywhere, and I HATE when people say that!
It sounds neat, but it just plain isn't true. That statistic came from
early research involving training rats to run through a maze, then
removing chunks of their cerebrum and seeing if they could still do it--
the point being to try to localize the center of memory. Well, it turns
out that there is no center of memory...you can remove tissue from
about three-quarters of the cerebrum (as long as you don't hit
anything immediately involved with sustaining life) and the rat will
still remember the path through the maze. It'll limp or stagger or
show some other defecit, but it can still get through the maze.
 
In humans, the visual association cortex, audio association cortex,
and motor areas together account for more than half of the processing
power of the cerebrum, so it's obviously and /provably/ untrue that
"people only use a quarter of their brains." Even very localized damage
anywhere will cause /some/ sort of functional impairment in people.

The tests are screwed up -- I think the younger you are, the more
accurate the test is -- When you get older, IQ tests become a 
combination of academic & learning potential tests -- One moment
they are asking you "What's Missing In This Picture?" and then the
next "Who was the vice-president of the 14th President of the
United States?"  Whereas if you are younger, you aren't expected to know
the 2nd question, so they give you a certain amount of information
to learn from or utilities to use, and you have to figure things out.
 
BTW -- My IQ was tested at either 134 or 136 when I was in 5th grade,
I forget which one -- I'd like to take one again and see how much it
has "changed."

thought I'd share a section from writer's guidelines from Asimov's
SF Magazine:  "Another common cause (all too common, we're afraid) of
rejection is the obvious lack of basic English compositional skills on
the part of the author.  By this we mean that the writer has misspelled
or misused everyday words, and/or mispunctuated same.  Stories are
rejected on this basis because a writer _must_ be familiar with the
tools of his or her trade, just as an electrician or carpenter must."
Or, as in your example, an artist must know his tools.  You say your
"Ideas are to important..." in that case, I would think you would
want to make sure they were communicated so that everyone could
understand them.

No, thank you.  I rather like the advent of modern medicine.  I don't
long for the good-ole-days of the black death, and routinely
quarantining entire towns for bubonic plague, or burning the homes
of small pox victims, or the annual yellow fever epidemics, etc.
I still remember two summers as a child when no one was allowed to go
swimming anywhere because of the fear of polio.  The combination of
black wreaths and yellow quarantine placards on front doors is a
nostalgic treat I would wish to avoid.

Considering the way you are interpreting my messages of late, allow me
to clarify my last post.  It is NOT insulting, derisive, meant to 
offend or any other nasty connotations anyone may wish to read into it
It is simply a question by which I am seeking information.  Namely,
what is your problem [i.e., in regards to me].  Frankly, I am baffled.
Is there animosity between us that I should be aware of?  You seem to
be indirectly requiring an apology from me.  For what?  What have I
done to you that I am supposed to apologize for?  How have I hurt you?
Please tell me.  I, at least, will tell a person when I am offended,
and why, and then leave it at that.  I try not to leave a friend
guessing, or have a third party try to extricate an apology for me for
the unspecified offense.
     If this is a board where a person cannot express unpopular
opinions, why bother to communicate at all?  And, honest to God, I
don't know what you are upset about (I know which message you are
upset about, but what the heck was in there to trigger anger?  None
was felt here when I wrote it.  And don't tell me that that is
cop-out.  It's the truth.  And, Donthen, the message wasn't even
addressed to you.  The person it was sent to, has not publicly
required an apology or even in the text of his messages, seemed at
all upset; it is YOU who says he is upset, yet YOU are the only one
expressing that emotion.)  In the original message, I expressed
respect for Turtle and his intelligence.  I think he's more than
capable of fighting his own battles.... do you think he is not?
     Whatever problem you have with me, address it TO me, not to
someone else.  Why do you think I'm lieing in my posts (I read
'cop-out' as a pretty euphemism for 'lie')?
Is there really any point in discussing anything with you in regards
to this subject if I am not to be believed?  How long do we continue
in this stalemate with YOU convinced you're RIGHT (capitals) and I'm
wrong?  This is your territory, if you wish me to disappear, tell me.

But don't talk around me.  I'm not used to being dealt with in so
round-about a fashion.  And you have always struck me as a direct
individual.
    This is getting quite long, but I'm trying to be up-front with you.
And, to be honest, you're starting to piss me off.  What the heck is
going on?  Please, tell me.

I don't think I deserved that flame.... did it occur to you that the
reason those messages were "round-about," not directed at you and
pretty general in nature was because THEY WERE INTENDED TO BE?
 
Yes, I was mildly annoyed at the posts both you and Jonboy made after
setting off your respective flamechains (his about Christianity, yours
about conservative-bashing) that were essentially "Gosh, I was just
amazed at the reaction I got, let's sweep it under the electronic rug
and go on."  And yes, I still believe you took Turtle's post far too
seriously and shouldn't have been nearly as surprised as you were when
people told you that, considering you wrote a very vehement spew about
it that would have been very difficult for anyone on this board NOT to
take seriously.
 
However, I was writing about general debating tactics because, well,
that's the subject that came up.  The statements could have as easily
been applied to Jonboy's "It's so swell how I got things going again"
message.  They also could be extremely easily applied to cartoonists
Dan Flahive and Chris Grant, whom I frequently get flamed by on the
Rowrbrazzle BBS -- in fact, some of it (the part about continuing to
defend a point, becoming more and more volatile, even when other
people are only attacking the way the point was stated) was written
with them in mind more than anyone on this board at all.
 
I apologize if you thought my message to Jonboy was a veiled attack
against you, but that reaction is somewhat mystifying to me.  You
already knew I thought you were guilty of weedy debating tactics, but
that's hardly a devastating complaint.
 
As I said, my message sounded general because it WAS general.  I'm sorry
it offended you; it should have, at most, expressed a distaste for
a method of "debating" I see too often on BBS's.

  Well, evidently they didn't have any problems with Kirk, since they 
performed the ancient ceremony of transfering the katra into a person

 First of all, I was told by Ken Ober that a bunch of people will be 
heading up to Tampa on the 16th to see "Akira"(sp?) and I was sort of 
invited to tag along. Anyways, if I'm going, I need to know if the date 
above is correct, what time everyone will be meeting at the car pool 
location, when we'll all be back, and (most important) how much it will 
cost...
 
  Another animation thing I heard about was that the new film "Rescuers 
Down Under" (out this summer) weill be the first ever animated motion 
picture fully computer-colored. I assume since cartoons are a different 
matter than live action, the result will look MUCH more impressive than 
a colorized movie... they also use more colors.

If we could find some extension cords, an electrical outlet, and find
a way to keep all the bugs away, and cool the beach down, it would be
fine.
