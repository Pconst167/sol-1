I never was really into Christian rock, to tell you the truth, but
I *do* enjoy Van Valen (and Van Hagar) and Def Leppard.  I play 
a little, too (mostly acoustic guitar). As you know, can't really play
a great deal of Def Leppard too well on accoustic, so I go for the older
stuff, America, Bread, Boston, Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin.  I have an 
electric, tho, and I aspire to actually learn how to use it properly.

  As a matter of fact, when I first went in the Army, (1983) I was 
sent to Fort Jackson, SC...and the slow twang of a southern accent 
drove me up the wall.  (At the time, I had absolutely NO accent...other
than I spoke a little rapidly.)  But as time went on, I spent more time
around people (there's a good cross section of the country in the 
Army) and got used to the southern accent.  Now that I've been living 
down here for about three years now, I have gotten used to it (my girl

  Because that isn't all.  The bible is filled with things you must

I like the way you put that.  You are giving totally unrealistic and
improbable scenarios and trying to make your point in that fashion. 
While it seems unlikely that the entire world will shift in that 
direction, (deciding homosexuality is normal) it is admittedly possible
that if enough people considered it normal, than it could also become
moral.  (Not to me.)  The way this could be accomplished is that the
"herd" could impose it's Moral Majority viewpoint on the Moral Minority.
(As we've seen happen many times before (ie bumper stickers).)  nd
And I like the way you called sexual preference trivial and compared it
to eating eggplant (which I like deep-fried eggplant, by the way).  
Sexual preference is trivial.  So is my opinion.  So is everybody elses.
When thier opinions all are the same, they can influence other people.
Enough people opinions can dictate to the crowd, politically, and 
socially.   What is morally right is a matter of public opinion.  If
public opinion said Homosexuality was ok, then it would no longer be
considered immoral (by mass opinion)...even though individual opinion
might say it is.  Like mine.  WHat is perverse...same logic.

actually IS if you look at it from the viewpoint of propagation of
the species - obviously a tough proposition at best.  It is also
calssified as aberrant behavior by shrinks by the simple virtue the
majority of homo sapiens have heterosexual relationships.  The
connotations that we must avoid are the ones that classify these
people as less than human or otherwise undesirable.  They have every

Interesting line of thought - it could be directly applied to the 
question of drug & alcohol regulation in this country which I believe
you stood in direct opposition to on the same grounds that you now
seek to put forward...  My point was that the abuse is a result of
the prohibition causing the substances to have more glamor appeal -
you argued against this point.
There are many things that I see as indicators.  Evading the trappings
of debate (which I attempted to do before with my flag of no-contest)
I will state that my "gut-level" feelings say that people have undergone
a change for the worse.  It is very difficult to support this sort of
thought because you can get mired in the trappings of the language and
bogged in the LeBrea of semantics.  "Worse" as used in the last sentence
can carry vast riches of overtone and nuance and is hence a very un-
defendable word.  I don't want to defend it.  I throw it forth as a
gasp for comprehension.  It would be wonderful if it were an easy
situation to understand on the cognitive level - but - I am reducd to
the level of blind groping and touch.
   Personally I feel that the banal imitation of entertainment that
pervades our society has produced a society riddled with confused
and misinformed people.  We no longer have a valid concept of love,
sharing, committment, honesty or ideals of almost any kind.  They
have become twisted parodies of themselves in the hands of people that
make their living from sensationalism and glamorizing the mundane.
Listen to any sappy rendition of a "love" song to get an idea of what
starry eyed prepubescents are fed as "the way things really are".
Anyone heard - I think it's Bon Jovi - "Live an die for you ..." ad
nauseum "love ballad" making the rounds?
   I'm sorry = I really think that we have lost the way.  Our divorce
and suicide rate speaks for itself - especially with our young people.
They are disillusioned.  They have grown up expecting what TV and radio
promise and then reality hammers them down...

You misunderstand - over 2000 years pass - the message is still the
same the promises remain and they are fulfilled.  There are no signs
that Jesus was a meglomaniac and in fact was a highly respected 
teacher.  The Kabbalists maintain that Jesus was removed from the 
temple when he made his great debut at 12 years of age.  he impressed
them so much with his knowledge that he became an Essene- which is
a very strict sect that some people refer to as the Jewish mystics.
This is where they would have us believe he went - the point I try to
make (tho sidetracked) is that he was a) intelligent b) respected
c) sane.  He stated for the record that he was the Son of God, the
Christ.  Written record by three of his disciples bears testimony that
he rose from the grave after three days to fulfill prophesy.  This
measly written record would have hardly excited and infused a populace
that had only recently demanded his blood and refused to set him free
in fact it was put down years after the resurrection.  Now - with 
nothing apparent to gain and his life to lose can you see him give his
life with no attempt at defense?  Can you see generations of people
suffering great hardships and persecution for the sake of a charlatan?
Can you see ordinary people with nothing to gain personally dying
for this sort of system?

I see; because homosexuality and bisexuality are supported on this board
(as the majority of the users believe in freedom of choice) then within
the context of this board they are just as 'normal' as heterosexuality.
The opinion of the public at large does _not_ really matter to many
people (thank the gods), and even in your theoretical case there would
be dissidents.  The more opressive a society is of a particular group
or groups, the more rabid they and their advocates will become.  
Eventually a vocal enough group will be able to sway public opinion (as
is evident by such groups as the 'moral majority', gay rights
organizations, and the various ecological groups, eventually eating away
at the cause of the opression.

I'm not sure how you can call homosexuality a "mental defect." You don't
feel attracted to other people of your sex; you don't understand how
anyone else could; therefore, your lack of comprehension constitutes a
"defect" on the part of someone else? I don't understand your prejudice,

Say WHAT?? And what, pray tell, is the "usual run of the mill butch" who

objective notion of what you're talking about here, or is this your
stereotyped prejudice speaking for you? I hate to intrude in your cozy

person who matches your cute little stereotype.
 
I can understand the fact that you and I have different views on this
particular subject, and I can even understand that you find homo-
sexuality offensive and immoral, but please: Don't automatically assume
that all homosexuals, or even a significant portion of them will fit

of homosexuality is a matter of opinion, in this particular aspect of

If you concede that morality is determined by popular opinion, then
isn't it meaningless to hold a moral opinion that differs from that
of the masses? You seem to use the statement that most people find
homosexuality immoral to buttress your belief that it is, in fact,
immoral; yet you also say that if public opinion changed, you would
still find it immoral. Is your morality dictated by public opinion or
not? If it is, then this is a contradiction; if it is NOT, then you
are acknowledging that moral opinions are not predicated on popular
opinion and that therefore popular opinion does not directly decide
questions of morality.

Sorry, frayed knot. Hades in Greek mythology was the place to which
ALL souls, not those of the damned, went after death. The word "Hades"
is Greek, not Hebrew; the Hebrew word for the place of the dead is
"Sheol." Depending which translation of the Bible you are reading and
which passage it appears in, this word is translated as Hades, Hell
(from the Nordic word "Hel," the title for the queen of the under-
world), or the Pit. (The Anchor Bible leaves the word "Sheol"
untranslated.)
 
In case you're interested, here's what Isaac Asimov has to say about the
matter:
   "Sheol was visualized by the early Isrealites as an underground
world to which the souls of the dead departed. It was thought of at
first as a dim plac where there was no particular torture, but where
there was an absence of joy. Nor was there any distinction between good
and evil; all human beings went there after death...The moralization
of Sheol, its conversion into a place of torture for the wicked, came
later in history."

Jesus was undeniably intelligent, wise, selfless, and truly dedicated
to making the world around him a better place. That doesn't make him
the Son of God, though he may have believed that he was. Yes, it is
possible that he believed himself to be the Son of God and was wrong;
that doesn't have any bearing on the validity of his teachings or make
him insane. (I don't understand why Christians assume that Jesus
couldn't possibly have been a megalomaniac on the basis of the fact that
he was a good person; being a megalomaniac does not preclude being
wise, giving, caring, etc.) Would he have died without offering any
defense? Yes, if he truly believed in and lived by his ideals; you
don't have to be the son of god to live and die by what you preach,
as Ghandi can attest. Did Jesus really rise from the dead? Hard to say;
with little more than the written record of some of his most fanatic
followers to go on, it's a contention that can't be tested, and in any
event medical technology wasn't really up to today's standards two
thousand years ago, and sometimes WE have trouble telling when someone's
dead. In any event, I still don't really grok how forgiveness for our

I think you may still be missing my point, though. It's very simple: I
believe torture is wrong. This is a moral decision I've made, and one
I feel strongly about. Deliberate infliction of pain upn a sapient
being is wrong. If there is a diety who engages in that sort of
activity, that deity is immoral. I think it's a moot point, since I

  The turtle was an interesting one - with his uncoodinated movements

I'm not sure that defining perverse as deviant from the norm works too
well.  After all, since a statistically insignificant number of people
like funny animal comics, publish their own small press 'zines or still
use CP/M or TRSDOS machines, going solely by that definition I'm one
serious pervert.
    At any rate, being "deviant from the norm"--as those examples show--
doesn't necessarily make one mentally aberrant.  And I will reiterate
my original point--if someone is a homosexual, that should not
constitute grounds for immediately refusing to associate with them,
listen to what they have to say, and give them any credit for anything
whatsoever.  I find advocating such a concept considerably more
disturbing than homosexuality.  And on a more practical level, I think
it can deprive you of knowing people who are -- gasp! -- homo/bi and
still worthwhile people.
    Of course, you'll immediately tell me that if they are homo/bi,
they're not worthwhile people.  Since you'll never be willing to give
any of them a chance to prove you wrong, you'll always be able to
believe that.  It's a beautifully circular system, quite elegant in the
complete unwillingness to ever challenge your assumptions (and let me
tell you, you've already thrown out a lot of them which I can tell you
are either shaky or flat-out wrong).  At any rate, I'm not going to be
able to change your mind, nobody on this system is likely to, and you're
never going to allow yourself to be put in a position where anything
COULD change your mind because you don't want to face that possibility.
Perhaps the fear in "homophobia" isn't fear of gays, but fear of having
your cherished assumptions knocked down.

Ordinary, no.  That doesn't necessarily imply divinity.  I've seen the
"Jesus must be telling the truth" line before, saying that the only
other choices were that he was an evil deceiver or a basket case, and
it doesn't really seem to hold water.  The people needed a messiah; he
gave them one.  This has been tried in modern times, too, just without
success... but most people in modern times aren't in nearly as{
desperate conditions.  At any rate, the none-of-the-above line leaves
out the possibility that he was, in fact, consciously lying for
altruistic reasons.  Someone might challenge that as improbable, but
it could be pointed out that it's certainly no less probable as the
idea that he was God incarnate -- really, it'd be arguably more
probable.

I myself prefer milk in cartons, not plastic.  The milk in cartons 
should always be bagged with orange juice or other milk, if possible.
If not, stick it in with other cold items.  The same goes for 1/2 gallon
plastic containers of milk.  The gallon containers should only be bagged
if the customer asks you to, and then only in the big plastic bags.

Maybe the character of Hell was only related at a later time.  I have

good ones (procurable) that you are aware of?  while Dr. Azimov may
be our honorable chairman - he and i differ substantially on the issue
of religion.  It is the one area that I feel he is close minded on.
I might point out that the ancient Greeks did not consider hell a very
desirable place either - otherwise Persephone would not have been in
such a tither about being abducted there - what with a three headed
hound to ensure visitors got theirs and Charon refusing to take
souls that could not pay - effectively making them the early equivalent
of restless spirits doomed to wander unsatisfied.  Death has always

My thoughts were more in lines of generality on purpose.  Over generaliz
is simply a way of saying that I am not factoring in all the elements
of the complex equation that is our society.  A simplified equation is
useful in modelling the dynamics of a system.  As I have learned in
chaotic systems sometimes complex behavior can be modelled with simp-
licity.
Look at the restriction as a statement of policy by the powers that be
in that it is a guideline and manifesto of the game rules.  It 
serves a purpose in that it causes more mature minds to examine the
provision with an eye to comprehending the whys and wherefores.  Maybe
even come to the conclusion that these are wise and fair rules for the
majority of the people that it serves.   To many people see themselves
as society and are selfish in their desire that society echo their
views.  When it doesn't we see the foul flag waving madly and the demand
is made that it is an unfair provision.  This is necessary to the 
operation of the machine for without such movements, society would
most likely leave out any considerations of minorities in the grand 
scheme of things.  However, it would be impossible to come to a balance
that serves everyone.  Foul and "obscene" language is used for the 
purpose of shock and attention getting.  It was the judgement that this
was inappropriate on the bumpers of cars where it could offend people
that considered it "obscene".  Where are the masses to counteract that
assumption that these "do-gooders" are the bulk of society?

Let me start at the end first - the reason that Jesus did what he did
and why it was necessary is pretty deep theologically and involves the
idea of the perfect scarificial lamb to atone for the first (and thus
greatest) sin.  I would have to agree that megalomania is consistent wit
Jesus' teachings as he stressed humility as the desired posture.
Megalomania by definition is a desire for the adulation of the masses
and thus he should have recapitulated to Pilate in the face of 
overwhelming public disapproval - which by the way came from the 
jewish peoples' belief that the messiah would be a king and bring an
end to the opression.  They WANTED him to be king and he turned it

YOU believe it is wrong - and within the framework of what you are 
and the society that spawned you - you are correct in abhorring
torture.  But you have also admitted that it is equally wrong to 
inflict your ideas of right & wrong on other cultures that may 
perceive things somewhat differently.  I maintain that God is
unknowable and outside your concepts of right and wrong.  For the
sake of argument - assume there is a god.  As he creates the cosmos
for his pleasure he decides to populate it with some sentient and
not-so-sentient beings.  For whatever reason - he decides to let
these beings know that he's responsible for their existence.
I digress - the question I wish to pose is - given the constraints 
of the materials at hand it would be possible to make either:
a) a sentient that is capable of reproducing and thus dynamic.
b) a sentient that is not capable of reproducing and thus has the
   tendency to stagnate.
This necessitates the concept of death to recycle the materials and
maintain a balance that can be supported by a carefully planned out
interaction of effects.
The question is: what are the moral implications for the creator?
IS it cruel for allowing death, or beneficient for opting for the
dynamic system without stagnation?

>Maybe the character of Hell was only related at a later time.
 
By whom? God? If you believe that the Bible as written by the Hebrews
is in fact the Word of God, then you cannot believe in the conventional
Christian Hell unless you /also/ believe that God didn't get the message
right the first time around and had to wait for the Bible to be trans-
lated into Greek to rectify the situation. It's more reasonable, I
think, to assume that the Christain Hell came about as a result of
efforts to translate the Hebrew scriptures into an already-existing
Greek framework rather than simply leaving the Hebrew untranslated--a
process that tends with every generation of translation to garble the
original message a little more. (The KJV represents in some places a
third-generation translation!)
 
Regardless of Dr. Asimov's personal views on religion, I think you would
find "Asimov's Guide to the Bible" a fascinating and thoroughly-
researched work on the subject. There is certainly nothing in there
which states that the Bible cannot be the Word of God, and it provides
a great deal of background information about the cultures from which
Judiasm and Christianity arose. Haven't really found any comparable
secular works floating around, and I tend to approach works which start
with the premiss "The Bible is absolutely correct and all our research
is going to be undertaken with that overriding consideration in mind"
somewhat suspiciously.

That's the answer that's found in most science texts, but it isn't
correct. The path appoximates a parabola for short throws, but in fact
it's a fragment of an ellipse--if the object could suddenly gain the
ability to pass through the ground, it would go into orbit around the
planet's center of mass. The object is /trying/ to go into orbit; the
ground gets in the way.
 
For something like a baseball, the difference between a parabola and an
ellipse is going to be negligable for all practial purposes. If you're
dealing with a larger flight path, a parabola becomes increasingly
inaccurate as a way to describe the path--if you're talking about, say,
the flight path of an ICBM, then a parabola won't even be close. Of
course, if the object is travelling fast enough to get out of the way of
the ground, its path becomes obvious...

Not necessarily. It's equally possible that Jesus believed himself to
be the Son of God and behaved accordingly, and was wrong. The fact
that he was wrong would not invalidate his teachings, or his wisdom;
the fact that he was a man of integrity would demand that he behave
as he did, consistently with his belief.

It is dangerous to ascribe moral values from one culture onto another;
that doesn't always mean it can't be done. From where I stand, outside
the cultures, I can say that the Third Reich, the Thuggee faith in
India, and the persecution of people of Korean descent in Japan are
immoral. Yes, it's hard to defend the claim that there is any universal
moral code, but it's also hard to support any system which advocates
the wide-scale persecution, torture, or murder of large numbers of
people as moral as well.
 
To answer your question more immediately: It is not immoral to create
a race of sentient beings with limited lifespans. If you want your
creation to thrive and grow, it's necessary. That's not my objection.
My objection is with the philosophy that everyone who isn't properly
reverent or is reverent in the wrong way will suffer through an eternity
of physical torture. I won't even go into whether or not god has the
/right/ to engage in that sort of thing--I'd argue that if you create
something that is sapient and has free will, you no longer own it
absolutely and have the obligation to treat it with respect--the fact is
most people who believe in hell don't really have a firm grasp of the
concept of eternity. Eternal, everlasting punishment--does even a
monster like Adolf Hitler actually DESERVE that? The things he did
/ended/; the suffering he caused was finite. Would he still be the same
man after ten thousand years of torture? After a million? ten million?
a billion? There is no justice in torture on that scale; it's simple
viciousness.

I'm afriad this reply may be a bit dated, but it is in regard to 94.9
vs 97.9 in the radio world.  I concur with you, 95 is more interesting
to listen to.  98 has struck me, recently at least, as being a somewhat
harder version of 106.3, or a bit heavier than the piggie.  I listen to
95 almost exclusively.  The fact is that the radio scene in the T-Bay 
area is rather dismal.  Classic rock formats can be extremely oppressive
to new music.  I don't know if it's an improvement to hear the same 
music from twenty years ago over and over as opposed to moronic current
music, over and over.  Innovation is a hard thing to find, I'm afraid.

I'd like to say that I had a Les Paul or a Statocaster...but no, just
some cheapie...well, both are.  Actually, I paid $150 for my acoustic, 
and the electric is borrowed...so I don't know how much it cost.  It 
doesn't sound that great anyway.  My acoustic sounds really good, 
despite that it's a Korean Samick 2300F.  (Whew!)
  I think that's a great idea, a get together.  What songs do you know?
In the acoustic field, I mean...

  You must mean Ken Ober's "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Retromutagen
Ooze" (I am NOT making this up!)
  The ooze comes in a little trash can, and it has a little glow in the 
dark turtle in it. It says things on it like "Mutate like a real Ninja 
Turtle!", "Non-Toxic" and "Will not stain carpets, but willstick to 
human hair, some carpets, and certain breeds of household pets. May 
cause hands to be covered with a layer of slime." Of course, I slightly
exaggerated the last quote. I am however really upset that the label 
does not inform you that the colloid slime inside actually will LIQUIFY!
  I discovered this unique property  one day while trying to open the 
ooze, which was oddly stuck shut. As you may guess, when the lid of a 
container holding liquid is quickly jerked off, some of the contents 
will splatter, namely on to my shirt.

I have just read the message reguarding "Homosexuality", your statement 
says that you believe Homosexuality to be a "sickness"??  I beg to 
differ with you, and YES, I have the Medical Background to prove I am
more than qualified to answer this question.  I have been in the Medical
field for over eight years with me specializing in Pysch.  Labeling some
one a "Homosexual" is not only dangerous, it is also un proven.  How can
you tell if someone is really a "homosexual", unless you are one?  Now I
dont mean to imply that you are one, just that there is no clear outline
avaliable to man to detect a "Homosexual" in our society.  Being Gay,
of Homosexual, is a choice and a choice some make themselves.  True ther
e are some influences in society, but all in all its a personal choice.

> Homosexuality is not a "preference", it's a sickness.
 
*** FACTS AHEAD ***
 
Nobody knows what "causes" homosexuality.  The only definition that goes
beyond the surface (ie, attraction to people of the same sex) is that
put forth by the American Psychatrists' Association, which in effect
states that it's a mental sickness if and only if the person afflicted
with it is dissatisfied with his/her condition.  This is, by their
own admission, a pretty useless definition.  Scientists have put forth
their own theories as to what "causes" it; sociologists have put forth
other theories, as have philosophers and theologians.  There is NO
evidence that any one of them can present to make it an open-and-shut
case.
 
Therefore, everything about homosexuality, and what it is, that you,
Turtle, me, or anyone else has said here must be an... OPINION.  When
you say that it's a sickness, that's your opinion.  Likewise, when
Turtle says it's a preference, that's his opinion.  Who's right?  Who
knows.  Obviously neither one of you are going to convince the other
one they're wrong.  (And as you know, Turtle's opinion is pretty much
shared by me on this topic.)
 
My objection to your views on this subject, from the start way back
when, haven't been based on the fact that you have an opinion different
from mine.  They've been based on the fact that I consider abusing
people on the basis of their sexual orientation, regardless of whether
they were born with it or came to it by choice or if they will burn in
hell or whatever it is you believe, to be discrimination, and I find
discrimination to be as morally repugnant as you apparently find
homosexuality to be.
    Incidentally, on what basis DO you condemn homosexuality to a degree
that it's morally correct for you to dismiss everything someone who is
homo/bi could ever do, say, or think and treat them as subhuman?

it's a weird white cement-like substance with a VERY low melting point.

I tend to stay away from secular books also - too much bias that I am
capable of myself is built in.  As far as later elucidation on the natur
of Hell - how can God change his mind if as you say - it was never 
really spelled out?  I was going on the premise that it was never 
really understood or expounded upon in the OT days and that it wasn't 
until the minor prophets and Jesus that more of its nature was revealed.

I have a book that you may find fascinating as it contains much fact
and a minute amount of religion - I loved it ; Og Mandino "The Christ
Commission".  The premise is that of a writer that started out to
prove that Jesus rose on the third day as a "good Christian"  He stated
for the record that as he searched he became convinced that in fact it
had been a hoax.  The imaginary stage for this is a Johnny Carson show.
I won't spoil it but he gets the chance to investigate himself.  This is
a truly interesting book.

A lot of Christians have gripped with the "problem" that you state.
Many believe as you and theorize that after a "taste" of hell they can 
be given another chance.  My question is: who would be so foolish after
to get it wrong again - sounds nice in theory.  I just have to file it
away under "the nature of God" sort of philosophy.  The entire book of
Job deals with this question (coincidentally it is my favorite book)
and is a real puzzle to understand.

I really wonder about the strength of the habits that lead to smoking
or are developed while a smoker.  I used to light 'em right and left
and just let 'em burn to a stub without ever puffing on it.  Man I would
be hauling ass on a mental problem (like programming) on a rare occasion
that it required extra mental effort I would grab the smoke and just puf
away till I had it sorted out.  Now I believe those were "props" and I
have a hell of a time getting things done right now because I have 
removed my "cue cards".  It is like the predictable behavior stimulated
a certain type of behavior from myself - now I'm semi-lost as I attempt
to forge new work habits.  I actually have a pack of smokes to 
deliberately temp me and remind me.

I would still maintain that the advent of the Christian concept of
Hell is more likely to be the result of the efforts of theologians
from non-Hebrew cultures attempting to "map" the Hebrew religion onto
a framework of beliefs that already existed in the non-Hebrew culture
than to a new revalation by God--even if you take the Bible at face
value, there still isn't anything in the New Testament to suggest that
all sinners who die unsaved are condemned to an eternity of torture.
In fact, in a lot of ways that idea doesn't really seem terribly
congruous with the early Hebrew view of the universe at all; throughtout
the Bible, it's suggested (and stated) several times that the favor or
displeasure of God is expressed /on earth/, not in the afterlife, and
the concept of Hell just doesn't jive with that philosophy. Even to a
person who does, in fact, believe in Christianity, it seems it would
be more logical to view Hell as a cultural artifact rather than a
late-breaking revelation by God that somehow missed getting transmitted
the first time around. (In fact, according to several sources I've run
across, including both an article about religion appearing in Time
magazine and Asimov's Guide to the Bible, most Christian theologians
do not believe in Hell.)

If the ball were capable of somehow passing through the ground and
continuing along its path, it would describe a stable orbit that was
nowhere near to being geostationary--by the time it came back up to its
apogee, it'd be nowhere near the point on the planet's surface from
whence it was thrown. Most decaying orbits, in fact, decay because of
external influences--friction from the central body's atmosphere being
the number one cause of an unstable orbit to begin with. On an airless
body, that presumably wouldn't be a factor.

Plato created the cave analogy to explain his concepts of "perfect
form." It goes something like this: Imagine yourself in a darkened cave
with a 90-degree bend in it which you can't see around. If there is a
light source in that section of the cave and someone were to hold a
chair before it, from your vantage point you could see the shadow of the
chair cast upon the wall but not the chair itself. The chair represents
the "perfect form" of that object, and the shadow is that which exists
in the real world; ie, all existing chairs are but shadows of the
"perfect form" of a chair, which we can never see.
 
As a philosophy, this one is untestable, has no particular consequences
which can be expected to manifest themselves in the real world, and has
the unique signature of Plato's--it's both slightly silly and BORING.

Myxomycophyta--the common slime mold. My all-time #1 favorite fungoid
life-form. They're just so utterly weird, you almost have to wonder if
the blasted things evolved on this planet. Part plant (sorta), with
definite animal characteristics (kinda), and if they get tired of
behaving like a single organism they just kinda fall apart into a mass
of indipendant amoebas with no particular predelection for one another.
And they can reproduce either way.

>Last /I/ heard it was a hell of a case for pro-genetic causes...
 
Really? Last I heard (psyiological psychology class two years ago) the
genetic model was falling out of favor--nobody's been able to find a
gene or set of genes that's linked with homosexual behavior yet, plus
it seems to follow a pattern that's not in any way similar to classical
inheritance patterns (even if you assume it's double-recessive). It
also doesn't seem to occur at any particular point in a person's (or
other organism's) development and there doesn't seem to be any
particular set of environmental triggers that will cause it to express
itself. On the other hand--it /does/ appear that sexual preference is
largely (not always) involuntary and that it's usually (not always)
associated with predictable changes in the hormonal makeup of the
individual in question, although it's not clear if that /causes/ the
behavior or is the /result of/ the behavior. I think the jury's still
out on this one.
