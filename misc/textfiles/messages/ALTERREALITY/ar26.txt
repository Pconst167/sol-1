The ship in ST IV was not the Enterprise.  The Enterprise 'bought the
farm' in ST III.  They 'borrowed' that ship from the Klingons (or was
it Romulons?).  Heck, the Enterprise can't even enter the atmosphere
and land.

I agree with you.  I was just not being verbose on the subject of heart
attacks.  But a factor that you may not have considered is that the 
heart stoppage does not necessarily mean that the heart muscle is
beyond chance of recovering.  A strong burst of adrenalin (controled by
the brain) and nerve firings may cause the heart to restart.  I am not
an MD, but 3 people in my imediate family are doctors.  And I know what
can happen to a muscle, or a group of muscles  have an excess of 
adrenalin.  They can do amazing things.  Consider the example of a 
women lifting up a car to save her baby.  An amazing feat in itself,
considering that most people can barely lift a volkswagon bug from the
front end up barely an inch.  This feat is can be acconmplished do to
adrenalin, and the fact that the body can do amazing things when it
does not realize what it can not do!
      Now, about the humans only using 3/4 of their potential.  I am
not talking just about their automated functions.  For instance the
fact that sometimes we blink many times a second.  Yes, a portion of
our brain is being used to do this.  As are many that allow us to 
drive a car down the road at 55 mph and not get killed instantly.  
But the fact is that we really are only begining to find out what parts
of our brain are used at certain times.  Now, consider a person looking
at a rock.  I agree that that person is using quite a bit of their brain
to look at that rock.  But not all of it.  We know know this due to
radioactive isotopes and advances in CAT scans.  Now what if all the
synapses were firing, 100% of our brain is firing synapses telling our
heart to start beating.  It is my belief that our heart would be able
to restart.  
       Now would be a good time to get into an arguement as to when we
are actually dead.  The law says it is when our brain is dead.  Yet 
when the state executes a prisoner, the doctor checks for pupil
dialation and a heart beat.  That is not necesarilly death.

Thank you for the clarification.  Could you go a few steps further.
I am still confused by what you are referring to as the method of
debating that you have a distaste for.  And what does "weedy" mean?
    I still do not see how my message could be construed to be a
vehement spew.  I'm not copping-out, I'm still baffled.  Since
starting this, I've been told I am behaving in certain ways that I
am not seeing from this side, and no one is giving me any concrete
examples.
    Generalities aside, what is the exact nature of your objections.
Unless I know, I will continue doing it.  Most of you on this board
are experienced at this kind of communication, and possess a wealth of
background from previous exchanges to draw upon.  My experience is
almost totally limited to AR and the Den.  You have shorthands for
conversations that I'm not aware of, and have phrases that trigger
certain emotions because of linkages to past experiences that are
beyond my knowledge.
    As far as the sweeping under the rug and cutesy replies...you say
that annoys you because you've seen it far too often.  I haven't.
When the only specific objection to my post was that of not
appreciating or possesing humor ---- well, I thought the next 
response you were soliciting from me was one of humor and light-
heartedness.  And I provided that.  It was not a cop-out.  It was
a sincere effort to try to mend fences, one that I thought you were
cueing me into.  An invitation to lighten things up, was taken as a hint
to let things drop, or, as you put it "sweep it under the rug."
    There seem to be some unwritten rules here that I have violated.
And I still don't know what they are.  I'm not going to learn until
someone tells me.  References to other conversations that I have not
been privy to are not enlightening.  Come on, Donthen, help me out here.

In an imperfect world, we are stuck dealing with people's bigotries.
And, unfortunately, people's intelligence is often judged by their
written skills.  It's not right, but it's a reality.  No need to grab
your thesaurus and dictionary.  I'll struggle through any number of
errors to get at the meaning.
   But I can't accept the attitude often expressed (by others, not by
you) that spelling and grammar just are never important.  And it's
especially sad to hear this from would-be writers.
They just can't comprehend that an editor can't be wasting his/her
time wading through their errors in hope of discovering an obscure
brilliant thought.

Well, saying you were pissed off at me in those words was probably the
main reason	 I took your message as a "vehement spew."
 
I think you may be reading more into this entire message chain than is
actually there.  I did say this was a personal distaste on my part, I
said that it wasn't really that big of a deal, it was just something
that bothered me, and to top it off, in the message to you that I'm
assuming triggered this, it said that it wasn't necessarily about
conversations on this board to begin with.
 
There are no "unwritten rules" for BBS's; what is and isn't allowed is
up to the sysop.  Very few /users/ will appreciate ad hominem attacks
or anything that seems to be directed personally at them, but that's
not something unique to computers.
 
The only thing I was expressing annoyance at was the "tactic" in online
conversation of saying something in an extremely inflammatory fashion
and then expressing baffled surprise, genuine or not, when people take
your original message as extremely inflammatory.  Your original message
to Turtle that started this whole nonsense took his message really
personally when it wasn't even to you, responded to it in a way that got
him more agitated than I've seen him in a long time, and you followed it
up with a "Who, me? How could you take it seriously?" when the way you
had put things made it quite serious.  (Not having "body language" on a
BBS debate may be bad, but neither do essay writers, and the tone still
comes through.)  My only point had been, that sort of reaction bugs me
because when you do say something that strongly, you should be prepared
for those sort of responses.  That wasn't anything personal, it was only
critical of your message.  NOT YOU.  It seems you did the whole thing
again with this message chain, though, flaming me out for something that
wasn't particularly nasty and expressing surprise when I get hurt.  Go
back and read your message to me.  Surprise!  It hurt.

It would be hard for the Enterprise to land on the ground and stay

The same place insects, amphibians, and homonids are from, dude!
Viruses and pathogenic bacteria evolved right alongside all the other
forms of life, and in fact /most/ human diseases are not human-specific.
A Rhesus monkey can die of typhoid or bubonic plague just as well as
any old human can. Personally, I'll take technology with its longer
life span and higher standard of living over "getting back to nature"
and dying of something nobody's seen in a developed country since 1832.
 
On a slightly related topic, it's kind of interesting that America's
inner cities are turning into miniature third-world countries in more
ways than one. I just today read an article that says tuberculosis,
typhoid fever, and other "archaic" diseases that you simply don't see
in affluent countries are starting to become a big problem in
a lot of inner cities...everyone was cheerfully predicting that
TB would be extinct by the end of the 1980's, yet right now it's at
the highest point it's been in this country since the '20's. Does this
bother anyone besides me?

Hmm. Okay, since we seem to be developing this discussion quite nicely,
here's a few points I'd like to mention about your post, both trivial
and not. 
   First of all, feats like people lifting Volkswagens over their heads
to save their babies are due to the release of large quantities of
endorphins, not adrenaline. Adrenaline can cause an increase in muscle
efficiency, but the upper limit of muscle functionm is imposed by the
action of gamma motor neurons, which are attached to stretch receptors
in the muscle and act to inhibit motor neuron function when they're
firing (in a classic spinal reflex arc, only an inhibitory one rather
than an excitatory one). Endorphins (and some drugs like PCP) can block
the activity of gamma motor neurons (that's why people who are dusted
are such a pain to arrest...they just rip apart the handcuffs and any
stray policemen they can get their hands on). Of course, what you
generally /don't/ hear about is what happens to these people, and to
people who toss Volkswagens around...they generally end up with torn
muscles and ligaments, cracked or broken bones, and the like.
   Yes, it is true that a heart attack victim oftentime has not
suffered catastrophic failure of the heart muscle, and with a proper
impetus it can be forced to beat again. This isn't going to happen if
all the neurons in your brain fire at once, though; most of 'em aren't
in any way associated with motor control, much less heart control, and
if all of 'em fire simultaneously you die. (Epileptic seisures are
caused by massive, uncontrolled neuronal activity in the brain.) The
only thing which allows a brain to function is the fact that 
neuronal activity is a /controlled, patterned/ sequence of firings; if
you lose the pattern of activity (ie, if all your nerve cells fire
at once or stop firing at once) organization is lost and the organ stops
working. (Continued)

(continued)
   That doesn't mean that autonomic functions aren't subject to acts of
will, or that death is a process that doesn't respond to the person's
wishes. If your willpower is strong enough, you CAN force your body
to continue working under circumstances where it would normally
quit, and vice-versa; witness the effectiveness of placebos and
shamanism, and the number of people in hospitals who have died from
what should have been non-terminal conditions simply because they
gave up. The mechanisms by which that sort of brain/body interaction
take place are more sophisticated and subtle than you suggest, though.
 
Finally, saying that every part of your brain isn't active at all times
is NOT the same as saying you don't use your entire brain. The brain
is a specialized, differentiated instrument; it's not homogenous
all the way through like a potato, and parts of it are dedicated to
performing specific functions. When those parts aren't active, that
doesn't mean they are available for other tasks--if you're not
talking, you haven't just freed up your speech centers to help you
tackle a calculus problem. Saying that people don't use their brains
to their maximum capacity because not all the areas are active at
once is kind of like saying people don't use their cars to their
maximum capacity because they don't have the heater and air conditioner
running at the same time.

>You know, I can'ty picture the Enterprise taking off.
 
/I/ can't picture the damn thing LANDING! In addition to a troublesome
lack of certain vital components of a reentry craft (heatshields,
some sort of manuvering system strong enough to hold it up against
a steep gravity gradient so it doesn't fall down go boom, aerodynamic
grace...) I strongly suspect that if you subjected it to one gee in
any direction other than parallel to its normal direction of motion when
it's under acceleration it'd fall apart under its own weight. That
thin neck is NOT going to hold that saucer up! The Enterprise was
designed for zero-gee, built in zero-gee, and clearly not ment to stay
in one piece under full gravity. The only direction it was designed to
take any sort of stress in is longitudinally from stern to nose, and
the designers probably didn't anticipate the engine supports actually
supporting the weight of the engines or the saucer support holding the
saucer up in a gravity well...
 
Besides, it doesn't even have any landing skids!

I've had tofu that ISN'T bad.  Tofu is basically the sponge of the food
world.  If it's done right, which usually involves marinating it in
something strong or otherwise imparting strong flavors to it, it can be
pretty good -- I've had tofu that tastes pretty good in lasagna, stir
fry, and even a pseudo-cheesecake (the consistency and texture was right
but it wasn't quite sweet enough, but that probably wasn't the tofu's
fault).
   If it's done wrong, though, tofu tastes like sponge.  Very few people
are creative enough to keep that from happening, too.

On the contrary, I think Pat MacDonald did a pretty good job with this
BBS, considering he chose the worst language possible to write a
string-intensive application in I can think of, with the exceptions of
Pilot, Logo and Tiny BASIC.  There are a lot of very nice things about
PBBS -- the commands are logical, the response is fast, the formatting
for messages, headers, command prompts, etc. is much nicer than a lot
of other programs, it has a hyper-efficient message storing system,
and all the executables and support files (PBBS, PBBSH, SYSOP and the
control data files) take up less than 80K, not too much more than the
original Greene Machine required (and less if you added the size of
BASIC and its overlays to GM).
   Of course, the stupidest thing about PBBS is what you keep wanting me
to carry over into FOX.  Very odd indeed.

You'll have to back that one up a bit.  Even if you can, it's still a
long way from substantiating the claim that we'd have fewer diseases
if it wasn't for modern technology -- the circumstantial evidence is
still strongly against that (like, say, the fact that a lot of
diseases that are almost gone now, or easily treatable, were almost
always fatal 100 years ago, like polio and turberculosis).
 
[Turtle: this isn't discounting your comment on TB; it /is/ still easily
preventable and, if enough people were getting the vaccine, it would be
almost gone by now.  Whatever breakdown may be occuring there, though, i

(yes really) of boards and haven't seen anything untoward in any of 
your remarks.  They may not make everyone (Donthen in particular)
happy but there are no real "unwritten" rules that are punishable
by crippling your home keys :).  I'm surprised myself at some of the
statements that he has made.  As far as "weedy", I think he was 
referring to the pratice of posting an inflammatory remark and watching
the sparks fly.  Gee, sometimes that's fun and it's up to your personal
standards how provokative you get - I would be ashamed of myself if I
ever posted a remark which could be construed as slamming another
person's ethnic/sexual background.  We are what we are and have to make
do - what we believe however is fair game (to me)  I think Donthhen
objects to the argument structure "I am righteous because"  Well - I
don't because an intelligent person can use this as bait to get someone
involved in a really good discussion.  Unfortunatly sometimes people
get dogmatic as the bait was and then factions destroy any hope for
meaningful dialog.  In my case I reply to posts that appear to carry
on the spirit intended and let the others lapse - in this case with
the religion - i let it die...  there was no progress other than petty
snide remarks that impart nothing of value.  Some people get tired of

that sort of response.
   Again, what "things"?  Again, back to original message to Turtle...
I used no offensive language; I did not engage in name-calling.  Is
the mere statement that I find something offensive, offensive to you?
   Perhaps these "things" that I am saying are so patently obvious
to you that you have trouble communicating the concept to someone
like myself who is having difficulty grasping it.  I need specifics.
Because, right now, it just seems that I can't see how anything you
are saying applies to me.  I can comprehend how you dislike the
insincere "Who me?"-attitude.  But that is not my attitude; and I
know my own state of mind better than you do.
   If there are no specifics you can give me, than I can only assume
that this whole controversy exists only in a negative interpretation
of what I have said.  
   I am asking for your assistance in this ... genuine, sincere,
non-lieing, anti-copping-out, still-baffled, yet-not-reluctant-to-
admit-still-pissed, despondent, and exasperated, and in need of your
aid.  'Cause the only lesson learned so far is that only happy
emotions can be expressed here, if you are offended; keep your mouth
shut; if you are pissed, don't let anyone know.  And I'm sure that
really isn't the message you are trying to convey to me.  I'm sorry
that you were hurt when I said I was pissed; but I'm not sorry for
my emotions, or the expressing of them.  Saying I am angry because
of your actions (but not angry AT you; that is not a cop-out, there
is a distinct difference) is not an insult.  Nor, do I consider it

The Enterprise probably wouldn't /need/ a hook on the front so that
the little Airport Mobile could pull it into the hangar; all it needs
to do is latch onto the Airport Mobile with a tractor beam and let it
drag it right in.
   ...course, it'd tear up the turf really bad, since the Enterprise
doesn't have wheels. Dragging starships around on the lawn is kind of
hard on the grass. A better solution might be to get one of those
dollies that people use to move large objects of furniture around;
you know, the kind with little wheels on it and the thing in front that
you shove under the piano or whatever so you can lift it up and make
it tip over.

I'm not convinced that the fact that tofu doesn't taste much like

shredded cardboard doesn't taste like very much either, but I still
wouldn't want to marinate it and serve it at a formal dinner, or serve

You know, your argument could also be used to justify legalization
of /all/ recreational drugs--"you are accountable to yourself for
yourself," and if you end up with cancer or a cocaine-induced heart
attack or whatever, tough. Trouble is, we live in a rather complex
society and there really isn't a good way to isolate one person's
actions from all the people around him. I don't want to share the
road with a person who can't drink responsibly, I don't want the
guy in the cockpit of my passenger liner coked out of his head--and
whenever I spend money, I'm paying for absenteeism, lost time, and
company insurance that goes to pay for the dip on the assembly line
who's smoked himself into chronic bronchitis.
 
Mind you, I'm /not/ suggesting that smoking should be outlawed, or
that we need tighter control (governmental or not) on recreation,
or anything equally silly; I really hate governmental intrusion into
anything, and really don't feel I need somebody watching over me all
the time and telling me what I should and shouldn't do. On the other
hand, I am pointing out that your chain of reasoning is somewhat flawed.
Whether I like it or not, almost all of my actions are going to affect
other people in some way or another; and when you multiply that by
tens of thousands or millions of people who may be doing whatever
boneheaded thing I'm doing, you have quite a significant impact.

<Continuing>  (Gosh I'm long-winded these days!)
 
Moving right along...I am also vaguely bothered by the implication that
the responsibility to deal with people's health-related problems belongs
not to the government but to the individual's friends and family. This
strikes me as being a particularly suburban white middle-and-upper-class
ethic; people who don't fall into these boundaries frequently don't have
a network of friends and relatives who are capable of assisting them, an
people who don't have any relatives and don't have any network of close
friends don't have anything to fall back on at all. While it can be
argued that that isn't bad--it acts as a form of social Darwinism to
weed out antisocial elements from an increasingly crowded society--I
don't think that's what you were even remotely driving at... :)
 
The United States is the only developed country in the world with
no public health-care structure at all. It is also country with the
most expensive health-care infrastructure in the world, even though
we do not enjoy the highest standard of health care. I think these two
facts may be connected...and whether people like to admit it or not,
health care is something EVERYBODY pays for, regardless of whether it's
done directly (by the government) or indirectly (through higher hospital
bills to offset lost profits when hospitals treat indigent people,
through lower economic growth when people spend money on hospital
care that could go to "hard" goods, through higher insurance prices,
and the like).

putting together PC clones, something I didn't have any experience with
up until the 2 whole days I spent on	 that job (not that it was terribly
mind-numbing activity, just really tedious).  Maybe something else odd
will come along.  Right now I have a pseudo-job at Pelican Press filling

That's not a disease, technically speaking.
    You are guilty of romanticizing the past, ignoring the fact that
in, say, medieval times, life expectancy was around 40 years and about
80% of the population	 died of disease and starvation before the age of
5.  Most people couldn't spell "medicine" (being illiterate, of course),
and even the ones that could had little idea what it really WAS.  The
best herbal remedy is pretty useless against most viral infections.
While I could produce a lot of philosophical and ethical objections to
the methods of modern medicine, I'd have to be wearing blinders not to
realize that for humans (and domestic animals), it's done far more good
than harm.

....or if you write a new BBS program that doesn't require forward,
backward, header-to-text and text-to-text links in every message.  OSBBS
got along with just a simple text pointer and only "wasted" an average
of 20 bytes per message (text was saved in blocks of 40 characters),
compared to an average of 127 for PBBS, which saves them in blocks of
254.  And, OSBBS was faster for looking up messages; you asked for
message 20, no problem, it was there.  If it had been written in ML or
compiled code, it would have been appreciably faster than PBBS, which
is no slouch itself.
    -- Of course, OSBBS just marked messages as deleted instead of
really removing them, and you needed to run a maintenance program to
free up their space, and the maintenance program required about 10-15
minutes to run and about 50K of workspace on	 the message drive.  I
thought not having to do that with PBBS was a big advantage; after
seeing my system and yours running with it for over a year and about
10,000 messages, many lost messages, lots of unexplained errors and
an average of one catastrophic message base crash every two months, I'm
beginning to think that El Klunko maintenance program may not have been
such a hardship.

And before any one says it, yes, it was not a direct quote.  Ok, so
now we got a Klingon ship, in San Francisco, parked.  He had to use a
Klingon vessle, Because the federation does not have a research ship
with a cloaking devise installed, and Kirk is too cheep to pay the 
extra for them to install it.  Ya know kinda like when you go into a
car lot to buy a car.  Well I do, ya know when all you need is something
that has four tires, rear and front bumpers.  You even say Ok, to use an
umpbrella on rainy days.  And you beg them not to make you pay on it for
the rest of your life.  Then they tell you for only X much more money 
you could have a roof too.  They know you want one, because its hard
drive on rainy  days as it is without trying to stear and shift and 
watch for other cars, and hold an umbrella, all at the same time.  So 
you say yes to letting them put a roof on the car.  Then you find out
how much money you have to pay them and you can't even fly it out of 
orbit that same day.  Ya know the more I think about it the more I think
Kirk should have got the Enterprise at a tent sale.  Then the ship he 
would have signed for would have been sold out from underneath him and
he could have got a ship with a cloaking devise in so then he would not 
have had to steal one of Darth Vaders Ships to land in Miami.

> a white-middle-and-upper-class ethic
  It's hardly isolated to that group.  The attitude is almost
universal in Japan.  When I worked for the Senior Friendship Centers
we had contact with a group in Japan that was trying to deal with the
problems of the family-less elderly.  It is standard there that the
family cares for their own elder members; there are almost no services
or avenues of aid for those left on their own.
  Are you equating the term white-middle-and-upper-class
with the term insensitive?

When RR left office, there was also impending financial crisis at the
S&L's that is still tying up billions of federal dollars because of his
administration's wheeling-dealing and a larger percentage of people
living under the poverty level, and a track record showing absolutely
no attempt to control the deficit that increased exponentially under his
terms (except for Gramm-Rudmann, which the administration repeatedly
sabotaged rather than be forced to make its supposedly unavoidable
budget cuts).  There might not have been as many visible signs of
economic hardship, but he still didn't do any better than Carter as far
as money handling goes -- deficits may be abstract to the average
citizen, but unless something is done about our current one real soon
(if it's not too late), we'll be in a recession that will make the
Carter years seem downright hospitable.
    After all, we have concrete proof that the idea of spending borrowed
money and pretending nothing's wrong is going out of style... "The
Donald" may be forced into bankruptcy and "Trump: The Excess" is most
certainly going the way of the dodo bird.  The 80's are over, and even
the most die-hard proponents of "trickle-down economics" are taking

Ghi! I wasn't suggesting that that ethic (people should be cared for
exclusively by friends and family) as being /confined/ to the white
middle and upper classes; I'm saying that that ethic is only effective
if it's /applied/ to the white middle and upper classes. In this
country, friends and family of other classes and racial groups are
frequently nonexistant or not in a position to assist. The tightly-knit
nuclear family is the rule rather than the exception in middle-class
America 8although we're working to fix that); and the exception rather
than the rule in the inner city.
 
I wouldn't say most members of the middle and upper classes are
/insensitive,/ but I have noticed that they tend to have a somewhat...
um, narrow world and tend to re-create all of American society in their
own image.

I could point out that it might not be a bad idea to put your writing

more slowly.  If your work isn't polished enough -- which could mean
anything from being too first-draftish to violating too many technical

Commodore "blocks" on	 the disk are 255 bytes long.  An XMODEM "block"
is 128 bytes long.  Hence the difference.
   As an item of hacker curiosity, most disk blocks -- what most 
computers call sectors -- are a multiple of 128 bytes long.  The CP/M
standard was originally 128-byte sectors, later changed to 256, 512
or 1024, depending on the specific machine's format; TRS-80 DOS's use
256-byte sectors, and MS-DOS generally uses 512-byte sectors.  Question
of the week: if Commodore 64/128 blocks are 255 bytes instead of the
more obvious 256, where did the other byte go?
   (Answer: damned if I know, and I haven't been able to find anyone

The best way to send a download is by XMODEM Checksum.  If you want to
know the best way to ARCHIVE it, I'd suggest LHARC.  Turtle will
probably say something different, though.  (ARC is the most universal,
followed by ZIP -- but I can't get things out of all types of ZIP
libraries, whereas I can get them out of LZH, ARC and ZOO files easily.
ZOO is pretty much useless except under Unix and AmigaDOS, and doesn't
save any space over the other ones anyway).

Indeed they are. An XModem block is 128 bytes long. A c=64 disk block
is (get this) /255/ bytes long. Of course, every other computer on
earth that uses sectors approximately that size uses 256 byte sectors;
I'm baffled as to why Commodore format uses 255...Anyway, 128 bytes is
the length of a logical record in CP/M, and XModem originated with CP/M.
There is also an XModem 1K standard that uses 1K blocks, which is kinda
neat since a lot of CP/M formats use physical record sizes of 1K. If
you break the big blocks into little blocks, you get 8 logical blocks
for every physical block, which is a whole lotta blocks. Then you
you scatter 'em all over the floor and Mom gets mad, even though you
explain to her that that's the only way you can find the long, skinny
red ones because they never put enough of those in a bag of blocks
and that's always the kind you need to build a castle.

ARC or ZIP files are preferred if you want to send stuff here, since
most people in the computing universe can deal with both of those
formats. Almost nobody other than Amiga hackers uses Zoo; LHARC
can't always be extracted by everyone; and whatever you do, don't
send me LZC ("vaporized") files. Nobody on Earth except Amiga and Unix
people can deal with LZC, despite the fact that it's an eeensy-teensy
tiny bit more efficient than LHARC and therefore is a good candidate

that it raised the adrenalin level.  Well, I was misinformed.  (Shows

I believe we will be more able to control our bodies to the point 
were we can actively will most diseases away.  (People have done it
with cancer, and other melignant diseases with a positive attidute,
and will power.)  Allthough, I doubt we ever will be able to stop
death completely unless we can figure out prosthetic brains!  Because
there is a general cellure breakdown wich can be slowed but not stopped.
        Say the a body starts out with enough energy to make a person
live for 200 years.  Now, if we were not equipped to have children,
we would be able to use all our energies toward fighting disease, rather
than the energy intensive childbearing routine, we might be able to live
for those 200 years.  With childbearing, we would have a 100 or less
lifespan!.  Take a look at certain mammels who have children every
2 to 10 years.  I think you will find that they have a much longer
lifespan.  In the opposite childbearing arena, look at mayflies.  They
live for only a few weeks at most.  Dying as soon as they breed.  So,
if we can slow down the childbearing process, we could put a lot more
energy into fighting off diseases, thereby living longer, and have a
slight population leveling.  (I know that if people lived longer, then
there would be a greater population, but with controlled breading, it
would soon level off)  It would mean not only survival of the species,
but also a better life!
       And less doctors!

some quite beautifull pictures.  (I hope that batiking is the dying of
cloth over wax, cause if it isn't then she doesn't and I don't)  Any
way, I love to draw, and I paint with watercolors, oils and guasche.
I paint and draw in a large format, and someday I hope that they perfect
LCD displays so that they can be flat and as large as a wall (what a
wonderfull media to work with - electronic)  I have done some sculpture
which I enjoyed the process, but did not like the finished product!

Hmmm, depends on how you view suicide.  I would say that I do not know
of one christian religion which does not say that suicide is a mortal
sin (ie, you will go to hell!)... now, could not Jesus dying on a cross
be considered suicide?  He had powers and his father had powers by
which he did not have to die on a cross... Is this suicide?  He chose
to die for us (if this is what you believe)... (I personally don't know,
I would be gratefull if there was a logical answer to this) Now, this
is why I can't handle most religeons-- too many loopholes!  So, if one
were to throw out the religeous aspect, then people should have the 
right to take their own life.  And as far as Dr. Death (as you call him)
(I can't remember his name either) is concerned, he did nothing wrong.
If you blame him for developing the suicide machine, then you have to
blame the original maker of a gun for every suicide that has ever
been done with a gun!       ^the
     As far as I am concerned, the suicide machine is a safe and
effective means of dying (It won't make yu a vegetable nor will it
put you in a mental institution).  I do not believe that suicide should
be even conteplated, much less have help doing for a person who is 
drunk, insane, or not in control of themselves... (Same as a will, sound
mind and body)  There is also something called a living will..  It means
that if you die, or are dying, and you have a living will, the doctor
and or paramedics will not try and revive you.  In this I believe whole
heartedly.
      Suicide is rarely the right answer, but in certain cases it should
be allowed.  Just like the death penalty is allowed in some states.

Hmmmm - you wanna re-read your post and point out which of the maladies

YOU pay.  I feel that insurance is the biggest scam before or since

As far as drugs being legal - why not?  Time and time again the studies

you say about kids getting high on Toulene?  They banned airplane glue
sales to minors for awhile!!  Big friggin deal!!!!  The attitude those
kids had was the problem to begin with - not the damned Tolulene.
SO what do we do?  Ou government in it's ever-broadening quest for more

gives 'em lots of guns, boats, planes, radars and legal powers that 
boggle the mind - for what?  To keep certain alkaloids and their chemica
derivatives out of the hands of a group of people that are hell bent on
self-destruction anyway.  The real vicious loop is the high price the
stuff commands (from being illegal) that allows the successful dealer
to have an enviable lifestyle to the fellow inner-city inhabitants who
figure that this is where the real money and success is to be made by
people in their social strata.  Take out the big bucks and make it

Hmmm well, our best "modern" medicine doesn't do too well on viral
infections either.  Were you aware that the best we can do is to put it 
in remission?  ANY virus...  Also - many respectable scientists are goin
back to nature to find what many ancient herbologists knew - plants can
in fact effect cures and remidies for many illnesses that have baffled
doctors for years.  My personal opinion of the "average" doctor is that
he has at best a 10% advantage over a witchdoctor or shaman in the same
room and I would PROBABLY prefer their company!
Ok to play devils advocate:
MSG - food flavor enhancer - source of the sometimes fatal Chinese 
       Restaurant syndrome.
Thalidomide babies: enuf said of a real tragedy.
IUD's : birth control touted as "extremely effective and safe" by the
        modern medical community.  They are still reeling from the
        damages inflicted on females by this device.
While not exactly diseases - they are indications that our doctors are
sometimes no better than fools drunk with their own importance and 
infallibility.  Modern medicine!  Most of the "advances" that we have
made are ones of hygiene and not of any miraculous wonder drugs.  Every
year they come out with something new and the doctors prescribe it 
simply because it is new with no thought as to it's effects.  There is
usually a shotgun approach in the medication just so all bases are 
covered.  I personally have been prescibed a drug that was used for
a gram negative bacterial infection when the problem was diagnosed as
viral!!!!  But the doctor assured me that this was being used to treat
it.  What I did was a: never went to a doctor ever again if I can help
it by trying to eat right and stay healthy b: Made some chicken soup
with lots of garlic and cayenne pepper.  Sweated for about 1 hour and
felt fine the next morning.  Bah!  doctors.

Just thought I'd let you know my first impression of Mark Williams
new UN*X clone, COHERENT.  I've only had it up and running for about
two days, but here's what I've found so far.  First of all,
installation was a breeze.  I gave it an 11 meg partition and it only
used about 6 meg and that includes the on-line manual and spell 
checker!
The package seems to fairly complete.  It includes a C compiler (K&R
only, not ANSI and only SMALL model), MicroEMACS, nroff, awk, uucp and
a host of other utilities.  There is a kermit comm. program also.  This
is a much better OS than I had expected for $100.  Mark Williams claims
that COHERENT is very System V compatible and from what I've seen that
appears to be the case.  My only complaint is that their implementation
of MicroEMACS is a bit on the anemic side.  Oh yeah, and I wish the C
compiler supported some other memory models on Intels brain-dead
segmented memory scheme.  Anyone else out there playing with COHERENT
yet?  I've used other REAL UN*X systems and I can't tell a lot of
difference yet.  Oh, by the way, COHERENT was wriitten from scratch so
that Mark Williams could avoid the hefty licensing fees from AT&T and
so that it would run on 286 machines with 640k.

While I may be forced to share the highway with the occasional drunk
and cokehead as it is, I'm really somewhat suspicious that the number
of 'em won't significantly increase if hard drugs are legalized. I
don't see any problem with legalizing drugs like pot--hell, it's a
safer intoxicant than alcohol!--but selling heroin in the local
drugstore and then saying "don't worry, we'll educate everyone so it
won't be a problem" seems like a kind of insane course of action to
me. Do you really think that problems with drug abuse will lessen
if you can go down to the local Circle-K and buy a hit of crack for
$1.95?
 
On the other hand, the money we're spending to keep it out of the 
country isn't doing two shit's worth of good (obviously--the price
of coke in Miami is STILL going down!), so interdiction isn't an
answer either. Perhaps keep drugs illegal AND spend money on
education rather than wasting it on interdiction? I'm eager
to hear anyone's solutions, although I'm not really keen on the
"make 'em legal and cross your fingers" approach.

Yes, the tax structure in a number of European countries is rather
outrageous compared to that in this country, but I'm not convinced
that that's due strictly to the fact that those countries have public
health care. (That's kind of misleading, too...if taxes here were higher
but we had public health care, we wouldn't have to spend anything on
medical insurance and similar expenses; I wonder what teh REAL net
economic impact would be?) In any event, I'm not proposing to model
a system of public health care after Denmark's or to force the hapless
John Q. Public to shell out twice as much to Uncle Sam as he does now.
However, considering that Uncle Sam has a great deal of my money
as it is, I'd rather it be spent to, say, make American cities
less closely resemble Lebanon than to purchase, say, large and
obscenely expensive bombers that are awkward, slow, not radar-invisible,
and cost literally more than their own weight in gold. The money that
certain factions of the militart/industrial complex would like to see
getting blown on the aformentioned flying elephants could quite nicely
clean up a few of America's more embarrassing messes, and it wouldn't
be completely lost when some yoyo teaching his kid how to shoot a .22
rifle accidentally shoots down the most amazing piece of flying hardware
on earth.

If I have a severe streptococci infection, I'll take penecillin or
E-mycin over chicken soup every day. It's easy to exaggerate the
effectiveness of modern medical treatments, sure, but it's also real
easy to go overboard the other way; diseases that were almost inevidably
fatal even sixty years ago are fairly trivial today. Personally, I'll
take the doctor with the obnoxious attitude over the shaman with a

If you know anything about programming in BASIC, it should be really
easy to write a program that will convert between PETASCII and
standard ASCII. To go from ASCII to PETASCII, all you need to do
is open the file to translate and create a new file for the PETASCII
stuff. Then, read the characters in one at a time from the input
file. If the ASCII value of the character is 10 (that's a linefeed),
throw it away and get the next character. If the value is between
65 and 90 (these are upperase ASCII letters), add 128 to the value
and put the new character into the output file. If the value is
between 97 and 122 (these are lowercase ASCII letters), subtract 32
from the value and put the new character into the output file. I don't
know how C= machines handle files or anything like that, but here's
pseudocode to do it:
Get the character;
A=ASC (character);       <--Put the value of the character in A here
If a=10 then loop back to the beginning;
otherwise, if a>=65 and a<=90 then A=A+128
           else if a>=97 and a<=122 then a=a-32;
write CHR$(A) to the output file;
loop back to the beginning

The legal definition of "obscene" (are you ready for this?) is
"that which violates the community's standard of decency."
How's that for a clear-cut, precise definition? Aah, the keen,

At any rate, the controversy ovr "2 Live Crew" is /really/ starting
to piss me off. Some counties are actually sending undercover deputies
into record stores to try to buy the album, and if the clerk sells it to
them he gets arrested. I thought this sort of shit only happened in
places like Kentucky -- you know, states where it's practically a
crime to smuggle books into the state (assuming anyone there knows
what a book is). Time magazine had an interesting comment to make
about the whole 2 Live Crew thing, in their typical underhanded
way; the brief article appeared in one of their recent issues about
Governor Martinez, and had a paragraph that ran something like "Since
his attempt to pass stricter abortion laws backfired and Martinez
has steadily lost popularity and credibility with members of both
parties, he has attempted to improve his image by attacking an unlikely
target: the rap group 2 Live Crew. Martinez seems to feel that if he
can make a show as a force for morality, he can shed his weak and
indecisive image and gain popularity with Florida's older, conservative
population." So, thank you, Governor Martinez, for your selfless
dedication to the cause of re-establishing the moral values of this
great state.

annual budget is less than one-half of one percent of the military's

I'm not aware of anyone who's advocating homosexuality on the grounds
that it's natural and should therefore be allowed, although I /am/
aware that some people think it should NOT be permitted on the
grounds that it's "unnatural" (as if you could really legislate it
out of existance, and as if, say, city dwelling is natural); to these
people I would say if your definition of "natural" is "that which
occurs in nature," then homosexuality is natural by definition.
   I hope you aren't seriously placing homosexuality and eating one's
children on the same plane; yes, both of them occur in nature, but
one of them occurs between consenting individuals and does not
cause harm to innocent bystanders, and the other doesn't. I'll leave it
to you to decide which one is which, and whether or not this difference
is significant.
   I also don't see why you are making homosexuality into a "we must
protect our children" issue. It's certainly a good idea to let
children know about the hazards of taking candy from strangers, but
what on earth does that have to do with explaining that not everyone
has the same sexual habits? You mentioned the need to protect them from
AIDS--do you think they will contract it by being told that homo-
sexuality exists? That isn't an issue unless they are sexually active,
in which case they absolutely need to be told about that possibility,
regardless of their sexual orientation.
   It still sounds to me like what you're saying is "I'm uncomfortable
with this thing; therefore, it should not be permitted." In the end,
though, trying to prohibit homosexuality (or oral sex, or female-astride
intercourse, or what have you) is an absurdity. You can do just as well
passing a law prohibiting droughts or floods...in the end, you only
make a mockery of the law. Regardless, this thing exists, sooner or
later your children WILL be exposed to it; deal with it. Hey, nobody
ever said being a parent was easy!

 I must have missed some of the previous messages on homosexuality. I 
was speaking to someone the other day about it, and they have an opinion
that homosexuals should not have intercourse with one another and should
abstain. Actually, I don't think that's the right attitude, but at the 
same time, I like the idea that this person is not going to out and 
force them to do that. And she certainly isn't passing that attitude 
down to her son. I hate people who think they should make their kids 
believe homosexuality and racism is okay. If they don't say anything, 
that's even worse than expressing the attitude in front of the child. My
parents are both prejudiced against blacks and homosexuals. I plan on 
not carrying on the attitudes. What I would really like to know now is, 
how can I live and speak with my parents if I don't like their beliefs 
or habits? I want to jump out and say "This is hurting me and you, and 
you should stop. If I do, they will ignore it or get angry..." Ugh,

say "Ohhh, they were pretty" or "Verryy interesting".  The one I hate
the most is "My 4 year old could do that".
    The basic principle is fairly simple.  Take cloth (Cotten) and paint
wax on the portion wich you wan't to leave negative, then dye the rest.
With each succesive color, you must wax the erea that you want to remain

If you reread that, I was not holding christ up and waving him about.
I merely used it as an analogy in order to say that religion does not
really have a place in the discussion of suicide. 
 
    Why are for Mercy killing, and against the death penalty?
           ^you
 
     Anyway, Dr. Death is not a mercy killer.  The women killed herself.
 
    I'm for the death penalty, and mercy killing (with permision befor
hand) 
          For one reason, the death penalty could be considered a 
mercy killing.  Another thing is that the few people who do get the
death penalty are killers.  Many times multiple killers.  (Who can
not be reformed)  75%of the people who enter prison, then get paroled,
will reenter prison.  So, suppose we let a killer loose.  Chances are
that he will kill again!  Suppose we just give life in prison... It 
costs us over 30,000 dollars a year to keep a prisoner.   Multiply that
by 50...  Thats very expensive.
     
       When I die, my soul to keep...

Whadda ya think vcrs are for, shellhead? TNG is the ONLY tv show I catch
every week - most other tv is dreck (exept ball games of course) The 
show when Damon didshit decided FE'males are not worthy to wear clothes
was on June 3rd. Unfortunately, this past Sunday, I learned once again
that fathers never win, as I gave my daughter a talking to about leaving
lights/tv/radio/nintento/etal on, then when I programmed the vcr to 
record TNG, she noticed it at about 6:30 and obediently killed the power
  God help anybody who interupts me when they play it again on Sat.
   Who knows what could happen in a TNG movie. In ST V, they had a fifty
year old, overweight communications officer do a fan dance on a sand
dune, and that seemed to distract the sentries ( I wouda shot her for th
feathers)
   'Tis getting tough to get on the board in the evening.

Well, you can't accuse channel 44 of being the big time. The best
solution I see is that you quit work/school/crime/whatever and get
a satalite dish and scan channels 24 hours a day until you find it.
what the hell, we're all getting rectangular eyebballs looking at our

hours of the day, and Bud Lite nonstop for the other 12. Otherwise, 
you couls screw up your system.

There was a ST when they had to beam down 100 miles (or 10 or 98000) int
a cavern, a Spock specuted on the unpleasentness of beaming into solid

 On TNG, they have used filtering devices to eliminate nasty bugs from 
beaming aboard - like when DR. Pulaski/Roddenberrrrry got the old age
blues and when Data was beaming aboard with a disrupter the Chief just
filtered out the weapon.

A lot of furries (= furry fans, but extremely so) seem to do that more
or less automatically.  I've noticed that I've started responding to
startling or confusing questions with catlike noises, and I'm not really
doing it consciously.
    But as for "real" roleplaying, it's an interesting idea.  Knowing
most furries and their inclination against rules, referees and the like,
I'm not sure what you'd end up with.  (There was a storyboard on a BBS
in California based on a military sf furry story called "Empires," which
was run with the "moderator" running things a lot more tightly than any
other storyboard I've seen.  When RDK was being echoed between a few
BBS's out there, it ended up almost collapsing because of the perceived
"authoritarian" attitude of this moderator.  This story does, of course,
change dramatically based on which side you ask and there's also some
other personal conflicts under the surface, but it seems that it's very
difficult to sustain something furry that isn't also, well, anarchistic.
I suspect furry roleplaying at a party would simply end up being the
different fans' characters interacting with each other at a party, which
(as I said) has been known to happen without any prompting anyway.

I too have a tale of VCR messing with.  I programed the VCR to tape
Max Headroom on Friday night and some show on Saturday morning.  The VCR
taped Max Headroom, but in the middle of the night my dad came out, saw
the blinking lights (even though the lights were not blinking) and 
hit a bunch of buttons.  The alleged blinkers ceased their blinking, but
the tape also rewound itself, so I was without Max Headroom.  After that
I carted the VCR off to my room.  :)

   Well, so far, only 4 counties in FL have declared the album obscene,
and someplace in Texas ordered the album taken off the shelves today. 
The only place the album is illegal is where it's declared obscene, so 
most of FL is still selling it, but I have a feeling more judges are 
hopping on the bandwaggon. There was a debate over 2 Live Crew on 
Nightline last night. The guy who is leading the attack feels that 2 
Live Crew is obscene and other thigs on the market (Guns & Roses and 
Andrew Dice Clay were mentioned) are not. Well, they're desprately 
trying to put a racist angle into it, and I think that's wrong. 
Unfortunately, the people on Nightline last night kept refuting each 
others facts and taking potshots at each other, so now I'm more confused
than ever... take the law out of the hands of the idiots and get some 
inteligent people in to debate this.

Not as tame as some might think. Lots of corruption and foul play abound
, not to mention that the book takes place in the present, unlike the 
film (which evidently was LOOSELY based on the book)... I think the

That's a good question. Until last week, I'd have said that you can't
sell them to minors, but there was a record store owner arrested
recently for selling it to an undercover porker who /wasn't/ a

Huh? I missed that one...I suppose some people might find death
preferable to, say, life in prison, but I don't really think the
individual in question gets to make that choice. In any event, I would
tend to think that mercy killing doesn't apply to individuals who
don't especially want to be killed.

I don't think race has a whole lot to do with 2 Live Crew's album,
frankly. Have you seen it? More than half the song titles include the
word "fuck," and the lyrics themselves don't stint much in the 
profanity and explicit sexuality themselves. If ever there was an album
screaming "Hit me! Hit me!" that one is it, and I think it probably
would have run into trouble if the people producing it had been
white Southern Baptists. While I don't approve of censorship in /any/
form, it's groups like 2 Live Crew who make it very difficult to
remember why.

...but he'd really rather not. The whole transporter is kind of a
fuzzy can of worms. When you beam down onto a planet, what happens to
the air you displace? Easy to forget about, but it's a significant
volume of air...think about the shockwave produced by a gunshot, and
the volume of displacement there is trivial compared to the volume of,
say, a pointy-eared walking computer. What happens if you appear two
feet off, or under, the ground? For that matter, when you are in orbit
there is a huge relative difference in kinetic energy and potential
energy between yourself and the ground (we're talking a few thousand
miles per second of kinetic energy and the force of a several-hunderd-
mile fall in potential energy, here), yet you don't promptly turn into
mush or a glowing ball of plasma when you re-materialize. Then you get
into the philosophical implications--what would happen if you could
record a transmission and replicate the person transmitted a few dozen
times? What if you figure out a way to send someone to a planet without
destroying the original copy of that person in the transporter? For that
matter, is the person who arrives on the planet the same as the person
who entered the transporter? Is his consciousness the same, or do you
effectively die when you are transported, and get replaced by a new
individual with all your memories and all your personality traits?
I don't /even/ want to get into it...

the only time I get some peace and quiet. Wait til the day your
daughter is giggling on the phone for three hours, and then 5 minutes
after you log in starts with "Daaaaad, are you STILL on the phone"
She thinks she's getting a new phone for her BDay - in reality, I'M
getting a new phone in my den for her birthday, and she can have the old
one.
   This concludes my grumbling for the day.

I know what you mean - sometimes, to be cute, my daughter calls me
'dad' instead of 'dad' - and you wouldn't believe what she calls her
mon. Ah well, Able was I ere I saw Elba.

But don't you see?  2 Live Crew's music makes people want to steal
wallets, so by stopping the sale of the music, you stop the cause of 
these people becoming thieves.

 Hey, "Family Feud" is a pretty interesting game show! Anyway, I didn't 
know you could find the "Ropers" with a dish (not that I'd want to!) but
you could just go down to Channel 40 and ask, and they'd probably show 
you their tapes of the show...

  I did! (Like that's something special?) It wasn't too hard. Did you 
see that unsold pilot she did about a year back? Anyway, you'll also 
notice that the brother and sister in that show were also both in the 
film "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids", but they were in different families 
there...

  If you are coming to the Star Trek series at Litchfield Cinemas this
Saturday (the 16th) at 10AM, then do the following:
 1) Send me mail and inform me you will be there. I want to take a count
 2) Be at the theatre BY 9:45!! I need to collect money and get tickets.
 3) Bring $1.50 for admission. We will not pay for you if you forget the
money. Bring money for food and drink if you want any.
  We will meet to the LEFT of the theatre entrance. I will be there 
wearing a red/white striped shirt and a Star Trek button.
 
 Live long and prosper.

TNG, yes; the Simpsons, yes; ball games, no. Nothing is more tedious
than watching overdeveloped Neanderthals grunt, sweat, pick, spit,
and bash each other for two hours. For some mysterious reason, I noticed
that your list is missing "Married...With Children;" just an oversight
on your part, I assume.

Well, if 2 Live Crew's music is responsible for people turning to a
life of crime, then by all means ban it!
...I wonder what sort of music turns people into Yuppies.

   My point exactly.

   Thats right.  They gave up that choice when they committed first
degree murder.  That is usually the way criminal get the death penalty.
People in prison give up almost all of their rights... as well it should
be.  Prison is no country club, but if certain elements had it their way
it would be.
     There is a knew idea that is being implemented that would save the
taxpayers a lot of money (I don't know the exact figures)  Its called
Boot Camp.  It is for first time offenders, and it is just like the
army version.  They say the repeat offences are down to 25% with this
program.  In ten years who knows?  But it works now!

With the air displacement problem, all that would have to happen is
the person would replace the air, and the air would materialize on the
ship.  Or better yet it would be put into outer space.  The vaccum would
probably take care of it (Near Vaccum).

Punky Brewster... recht.  I can't stand cute kids!  The only reason I
like Bart Simpson is that he is not a cute kid!
     4 HOURS?  Wow, if I had 28 hours in a day, I still would not
watch 4 hours of T.V. Thats 870,000 hours of tv in your lifetime!
