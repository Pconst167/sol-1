Dear Turtle,
     
>Why clutter up your language with unnecessary impediments?
    
   Why, indeed. And I see that you're not programming with reduced-
instruction set chips, either. (Even though it might be a trifle 
faster.)
   Face it, Turtle -- EVERY language is designed to make it somewhat
easier than programming outright in machine language. Not everyone
is of the philosophy that "If it wasn't done in ML, it wasn't done
right." Sure -- it might be slower; it might take up more memory, but
when the programing is done just for onesself, speed doesn't always
m,atter; I just needed to get one of my ideas for a music program from
an eighteenth-century book that I was reading into the computer's
memory. Strong typing would have saved me about two hours of debugging
time.
  
  Going back to the original topic, a language is meant to be as
general as possible. If there are "impediments" that are unnecessary
to you, the perfect language would "turn them off" (and not have them
as part of the .EXE code.... unlike many of the languages written 
for the IBM.) But let others use that crutch!

Dear Turtle,
    "Prelude and Fugue 1 in C major" is EXACTLY what I am talking
about. It is made almost entirely (except the ending) of major and
minor arpeggiations. The ONLY intricacies are from the choices of
chords that Bach used -- NOT from any "rhythmic" or "melodic"
intricacies. In fact, Paula Abdul uses MUCH more intricate rhythms.
    If you don't believe me, I'll have Steve Miles get a copy of it
on tape.

Dear Beatle,
   If you're searching for a list of banned books, there's a book in
the New College library (check the Z-section for it...) listing all
the books the U.S. has banned for import over the years. Fascinating
reading!
    
   By the way, there's been a lot of books that are allowed in to the
U.S. that are banned from some public libraries. That's an even more
interesting list -- including Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, the Bible,
the Wizard of Oz. (There's a heck of a lot more; I can't remember them.)
Banning books is good for children's minds? I doubt it.

Gee.  You seem to imply that the S100 bus was faster than the At-bus.  
I am by no means a hardware "dude" but it seems to be that the S100 bus
barely supports 32 bit mu-processors, if at all.  It was designed for 
use with 8/16 bit processors.  I used to own an S100 computer and it
never mentioned 32-bit capability.  Now on the other hand, the S200
"standard" supports up to 128-bit (I think, 64 at least).  Now THAT'S

Just some thoughts about what you said about TeX or Scribe.  It seems
that most people do not realize that TeX is in the Public domain.  It
is not shareware, or anything like that.  Don Knuth (the author) could
be considered one of the greatest computer scientists there ever was.
Those of you who have read "The Art of Computer Programming" should
know that it was typeset using TeX.  In addition, three commercial
versions of TeX exist: PCTeX, TurboTex, and someother one.  Plus, 
Stanford university has had the sources converted from Pascal to C.
This version, CTeX, should work fine on a PC.  The tricky part about
porting TeX to PC is simply writing the .DVI file converter that
converts the Device Independant stuff to instructions for your printer.
Finally, there exists a public domain IBM-PC version of TEX.  My 
professor at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology has it.
 
 I'm sorry I will not be able to answer any replies made to me for
another month.  I am on a VERY short easter break and I will be
returning to graduate.  However, I have found the quality of convers-
ation on this board to be superior.  I hope that I may have cleared up
some ideas about TeX with this little note.  Thanks.

My recent acquisition of the SB-180 has put me in the embarrassing
position of actually /wanting/ an MS-DOS machine. I've given it a 
whole lot of thought, and come to the conclusion that an XT or AT clone
is the ideal terminal for the SB-180. The 180 can read and write to
MS-DOS disks, the MS-DOS machine is fast enough to keep up with the
180 as long as you slow the 180 down to 9600 baud, the MS-DOS
machine is capable of doing rudimentary processing of its own off-line
while the SB-180 is busy, and if nothing else, the MS-DOS machine is
cheap...less expensive than, say, a reasonably good DEC smart terminal,
even if it is rrreeeaaalll ssslllooowww. All in all, a fitting front-
end for the SB-180.

Accounts usually go away in 30 days, but if you're going to be back I
can see to it that yours sticks around. This system is most likely
going to be switching software and/or hardware very soon; I'm thinking
about (a) running an RCP/M on this computer; (b) running OS-BBS on the
Model I to my left; (c) running an RCP/M on the SB-180 next to me;
(d) converting this system to BYE4 once it gets written; or
(e) experimenting with a couple of other software packages I have for
this machine in native mode. PBBS is beginning to drive me bonkers;
any time I want to change something, it's get out the debugger, find
the spot I want to change, stick in a Jump instruction to a higher
spot in memory, get out the assembler, write the new routine, ...
The Scanning for mail, Last Visitor, Sysop is/is not in attendance,
and logoff screens were all done that way by Donthen & myself...you
gotta wonder at that sort of dedication to a software package that's
as bad as this one. *sigh* Anyway, the idea of an RCP/M is beginning
to appeal to me more and more as time goes by, so who knows.

PBBS will respond to XON/XOFF but doesn't generate any handshaking
codes of its own. I've had a few other QModem users complain to me
about really weird problems when they call this board, though, so I'm
not convinced the problem is strictly PBBS's fault. It's possible that
line noise is the culprit, as well. Sorry I can't be more helpful...

it does a great job of swapping, as long as you are only running

but the vt-102 emulation takes a little getting used to (backspace, et a

It works with 20m hdds (ie st225) and I am not certain about either
availibility , pricing, or compatibility with other drives.  But it

a feild where sometimes a lousy band can get a great producer and make
something worth watching....and a great band can get a lousy producer

   Try putting the stereo on and turning the TV down (ie-MTV), you'd

Just a hint. Most Road Rallies tell you where to go, so all you need
is a map and a good sense of direction. In THIS one, you get clues, NOT
directions. First you must figure out the clue and THEN go there. The
more in a vehicle, the better your chances of figuring them out quick.

Chip, you've got a laptop right? What are you doing using Qmodem?
I've got a copy of Telix 3.12 and a logon script that puts the BBS
name in the left hand corner of the screen... such neat stuff!
Anyway, as far as I can tell, Qmodem does nothing Telix doesn't 
(and /doesn't/ do a few thing's, like internal Zmodem) and takes
five times the disk space, and twice the memory!

Look at it again. I single-stepped through the video in a VCR; it's
animated at a full 24 fps, and the integration of animation and live-
action is totally seamless. Pay particular attention to the sequence
where Paula and MC Scat Cat are walking in opposite directions on the
staircase and the sequence where MC Scat Cat is lying on top of her on
the car seat...in the latter, if you freeze the frame you will notice
that Paula's fingers are interlaced /perfectly/ with the cat's. I can't
say about the sound synchronization, though; I've never seen the entire
video with the sound on.

The "lot of line noise" stems from the way PBBS/H handles baud rate
checking. PBBS/H sends its "Press <Return>" message first at 1200
baud, then waits for a CR from the modem port; if it gets a character
that ISN'T a CR, it assumes the baud rate is incorrect, switches
to 300 baud (or 2400 baud, depending on how fast the sysop's modem is)
and sends "Press <Return>" again. It will keep cycling like that
until it finds a CR at one of the baud rates. If there's a way to do
it in Q's script language, you might write the script to keep sending
CR's after every input stream until it "sees" the PBBS/H Connect
message, then continuing with the script. (Of course, there's probably a
better way to do the baud checking, but I can't think of one...)

Only if it's easier than manually relocating your bootstrap routine into

interesting piece of code that you're trying to look at that doesn't
want to be looked at...I've done it both ways. (Of course, a patch

Dear Beatle,
   2001: A Space Odyssey was banned from some libraries due to (*SIGH*)
Christian influences. How so? The ending of the book strongly implies
the creation of a new god out of what was once Dave Bowman. (2010
confirms it.) This is entirely against the First Commandment: "Thou
shalt place no other gods before Me..."
   I wonder: how many people, after reading 2001, decided to start
worshipping David Bowman?
       
   Oh yeah -- it not only implies that humans can become gods, but also
a hierarchy of gods (who created the god/being that was once Dave) that
are entirely outside the Christian religion.

>...what 'zactly are furry *parties*...
 
Parties of furfen, of course! A furry party is a social gathering of
people who are interested in furry fandom; they usually include a
bunch of animation, a whole lot of talk about computers and furrydom,
weird movies, ritualistic abuse of vegetables, seminars on bondage
techniques, that sort of thing. Don't know when the next Furry Party
is scheduled, although it'll probably be happening sometime toward the
end of April by the looks of things...RufusCon '90 is right around the
corner...

Dear Chip,
   I never said I watched the video for "Cold Hearted" for the song, nor
did I specify that the dancing was what I was watching (although that's 
part of it)
   And, yes, you probably are the only one here who hasn't seen 
"Opposites Attract", unless some of us have gone out of their way to NOT
see it. If you watch MTV for a couple hours this weekend (make it about 
three, and not in prime time) you will see the video.

   Furry *parties* are a "come as you are," extremely informal kinda
thang... If these were real furry parties, we'd have several animators
drawing quick sketches in books as part of the thang.. unfortunately,
not many of us can do that on the fly.

showing my wife something a blew away a whole directory of data files), 
and the main recovery part (NU) would only allow me in with Maintanance
Mode ON, which means you can only look, NOT recover. And then later I
ran POP-DOS (Logitech's pop-up menu driven DOS assistant) and whenever
I would format a disk, it would end with a DOS ERROR and either lock my
system up or when I'd switch to the drive I was formatting in, it would
give me the C: directory for a listing on B: (nothing was on B:, just
formatted). So I switched back to MS-DOS 4.01 and everything worked
again. I also found out that I can boot-up in MS-DOS and then use the
EDITOR program from DR-DOS, other DR-DOS commands may work under MS, but
I haven't had time to try yet...........seeeee ya'..

It's /much/ more difficult to ban a movie than a book. Technically, they
don't actually /ban/ books very often; they just don't put them in
school or public libraries. You can still buy the books if you want; you
just won't find them in the library lest an unsuspecting child read them
and become twisted into the ways of Satan. A movie house, on the other
hand, is a private enterprise and it's rather difficult to tell the
people who own it what movies they can and can't show. (I was working as
a projectionist when "Last Temptation of Christ" was released, though,
and got /really/ pissed off when a memo came down from the home office
saying that no theater in the chain I worked for was allowed to carry
it...)

11 frames-per-second doesn't work, I don't think (not divisible by
either 24 or 30, which are the max rates for film and video
respectively).  A lot of limited animation is 10 per sec, and sometimes
only 6.
   The original 5 episodes of TMNT were done by Toei Animation, which
usually seems to do 10 or 15 (acceptable for most things) and also does
really nice painted backgrounds and character shading/shadowing, etc.
Whoever took it over from them for the actual series needs help.

DR-DOS is, in fact, not MS-DOS; it's smaller and faster, but it isn't
likely to do all the I/O in the same way Mush does. If it were me, and
(Heaven forbid) I were running an Intel machine, I'd probably use Mush
only for specialized things like Norton and use DR-DOS for everything
else, simply because DR-DOS is a /lot/ more sophisticated and generally
more powerful. (I'm accustomed to weird O/S compatibility problems; I
have about 6 or 7 different operating systems for the Model 4, not
counting CP/M and Z-System...) Of course, if I didn't care about Mush
compatibility at all, I'd probably run CP/M-86 on this hypothetical
Intel machine and forget the whole blessed thing.

It depends on what they eat.  Lekai, Juka, Omaha, etc. wouldn't eat
any more than a human would.   Erma might eat a little less, although
she's athletic enough that it might make up for her smaller size.  I
have no idea how much Tundra would eat.  Sheila would be another
problem entirely, but even if you didn't know she was a bit bonkers,
feeding a 7' tigress could strain any budget.

Sorry, you are indeed wrong my friend.  Ask any blacks that you
know that are from up north (ie Yankees) and ask where they have 
experienced more prejudice.  It is way too much to get into here but
in fact racism has been most persistant and harsher in the north.
Most Northerners didn't even know why Lincoln made such a big deal
out of making Emancipation part of the War - they didn't feel like it
had a damned thing to do with the war and in fact - it didn't!
The War Between the States was fought over the issue of State Rights
and independant government.  The South was fighting for the original
intent of our founding fathers to implement a REPUBLIC - NOT a 
democracy.  If you wanna read some real hairy stuff that makes Nixon
look weak - check out even a Yankee history book about the atrocities
of the Lincoln administration.

   As with many tribal societies, the primitives that now inhibit the

the only correct one. Most members know that "other religions are

contradicts the others. Or even if they agree in parts.

For all I care, you can be carbonized when you play. But I prefer
to be lightly heated for about five minutes at 400 degrees F, myself.

Dear JonBoy,
   In my message, I was trying to explain why some Fundamentalists
were trying to ban the book 2001: A Space Odyssey. I wasn't trying
to make a statement about whether or not there existed a hierarchy of
gods; I merely meant to state that Fundamentalists do not believe in
one; therefore, they do not wish for anyone else to believe in one.

Hmm. I have a 20-slot S-100 machine with a /really/ bad floppy
controller (hard sectored floppies only, natch) and a fairly bad
Z-80 CPU that I'd love to yank out of there and replace with something
I can use...got any single-board S-100 processors or other neat-O 
S-100 cards kicking around?? S-100 isn't really "rated" at a specific
clock speed, since depending on what kind of processor you have in there
the processor may have a self-contained clock and its own memory
bus and whatnot, but I believe it handles data transfers at up to
20 MBytes/sec (I could be mistaken) and a master bus clock of 20 MHz.
Interestingly, the S-100 architecture puts such low overhead on data
transfers that a 20-MHz MS-DOS 80386 card in an S-100 backplane is
capable of data throughput that's just under twice as fast as an EISA
386-33 machine (like the Compaq Deskpro 386) and almost three times as
fast as Micro Channel. Go figure.

DEC? Slow? naaaah...it's just that the SB-180 prefers to talk to its
terminal at 38.4 Kilobaud, will grumble a little at being forced to
run at 19.2 KBaud, and /really hates/ 9600 baud. Unfortunately, the
only terminals I have are a couple of DEC VT-52's (9600 baud max),
a VT-100 (ditto), and a TVI-920C (it claims to be able to run at 19.2,
but has a habit of dropping characters during cursor positioning
sequences and annoying things like that). Of course, if you're using
a VAX or some such thing, then 9600 baud is perfectly acceptable, since
you're not likely to be doing much full-screen stuff (unless you're
using EMACS or DECwindows or some such silly thing, in which case you
ought to be on a hard-wired VT-302 in the first place). *sigh* I could,
of course, modify the Televideo TCAP so that it delays briefly after
a cursor positioning sequence...but that's too much like work...

Historically speaking, the deep south has had more of a problem with
men in sheets toasting crosses and minorities than places like
Idaho have...although you're correct in saying that the war between the
states had little to do with the issue of slavery. Idealists--especially
Southern idealists--may say that it was a battle to determine the
direction the country would take on the issue of state's rights or
some such thing, but more directly it was fought to preserve a way
of life in the south that was being threatened by northern industrial-
ization. The south just didn't /want/ to industrialize. (Kinda like
what's going on in Ireland--you can find six or seven hundred
perfectly logical reasons why Ireland is having the problems it's
having, but in the end what it boils down to is they're still fighting
the Protestant Reformation.) Of course, you can argue that it was
fairly foolish for an agricultural, loosely organized conglomeration
of states with no real "hard" industrial base and no resources other
than soft goods to go to war with an industrialized, strongly
organized nation with more resources and more manpower--and you'd
be right. It isn't surprising that the north won; the only surprise
is that it took as long as it did. A testament to the south's willpower
and some rather remarkable military commanders, but still a futile
endevor from the word go.

going to be getting a Hard Drive, but I don't exactly have all the money
needed to get exactly what I want -- I'm calling the Briwall tech
support people tomorrow, but who knows if I can get straight answers,
so, I'm also asking here....
 
First off, I can purchase one of four hard drive controllers for the
Amiga 500:  FastTrak (Told it was junk) for $346, Supra-500 (Told it
was great and this is the one I would like to purchase) for $315,
Snergy (Never heard anything about it) for $313, and Trumnpcard 
(No RElation To Donald -- Told it was junk) for $510....That's
TRUMPCARD, not TRUMNPCARD!  ehhehe ANyways, here is my problem,
they have the choice of Hard Drives to place in 'em here...
Seagate 20 Meg - 20ms.....Quantum 40 meg - 11ms etc etc etc...
The cheapest one that i can find that looks good is a Supra w/ a
48 MegaByte -- 40ms Seagate 3.5 HD for 
woops.... $662.00  ..... Now, is 40ms too slow?  There is a 28ms
version for $684 .... Is it worth the extra $$$, tho?  What does
everyone think!?  Or should I just get the controller and find the 3.5"
drive to go in it from another source!?  Here's something interesting,
it says here:  Deduct $110 if you don't want the case and cable...
Okay....I can set it up on a Maxell box like Turtle's PC/Z!  hehehe
I'll have to ask the Tech peopel about it tomorrow.....anyways, any
input I can get from a knowledgeable person would be helpful...

Fortunately, the twentieth-century advent of chaotic math has given
us more rational people the tools to prove that order does /not/ imply
intelligence. The only people left clinging to that line of reasoning
any more are people who have never played with fractals or chaos
math. (For $39.95, you, too, can buy a Mush fractal program that can
demonstrate how order arises spontaneously from disorder...and if you

Turtle,
   While I dont disagree entirely with your assessment of the Irish
problem and its root cause, I think I'd like to add that as long as
certain groups are reaping enormous financial benefits from the con-
tinued unrest on the Isle of Man then those groups will continue to
stir up the young hot-headed masses who are being led to slaughter
and murder under false pretenses.  In many ways this is reminiscent
of the Vietnam War, where the average grunt /believed/ he was there to
halt the spread of communism while those in power (in both MACV and the
S. Vietnamese Government) became rich.
   Certain individuals and governments are abusing the desire of the
Irish people to "captain their own ship" in order to line their own
purses, and unfortunately a lot of blood is being spilled in the process
.

None of those listed (though I wouldn't turn any of them away [actually,
I'd be at a disadvantage trying to fly the F-20, not to mention that
it is only a two seater, and I'd have trouble fitting the unicorn in
the back seat]).
 
Still, if I pull this off, it will be better than other options I've
mentioned before (it looks slim, but there is still some hope).

> Is it bigger than a breadbox?
 
Depends on who's breadbox you're talking about. Merita makes some
pretty big breadboxes, complete with wheels!

The hard drive that the Wyvern's Den ran on (and will run on again, with
any luck) was at most a 40ms drive, and might have been slower--and it
was /still/ running about as a fast as a 386 board with a 18ms access
time from the user's perspective.  When you're reading messages from a
BBS, a difference in milliseconds is no difference at all (it's still
going to be slowed down to the modem's speed).  A 28ms drive will be
more than fast enough for a BBS, and it'll also be fast enough for
anything else you try to do with it....

It'd be nice if you took my BBS number out of your logoff screen.  It's
been down three weeks now.

The case probably includes it's own power supply, so you'd have to find
another one. if it's only $22 more for the 28ms drive I'd spring for it,
but then, it's your money!

Hovercraft already can be used on Public roads, just not Freeway's. 
State Highway's are perfectly legal. I've talked to a guy who works for
Scat.. a commercial hovercraft company (actually the hovercraft is 
called the Scat.. and I think the company's named something else) And he
said he drives one of the things down from North Carolina on small high-
ways, and then crosses the gulf over to the Bahamas. I wouldn't do it,
but I suppose he lived to tell about it!

wish I still had mine, I could have more storage space.

No, she wasn't. Go back and read Message #3690. The seven were:
Lekai, Juka, Tundra, Cassie Burma, Gadget, Omaha, and Erma Felna.
Dip.

Why? On a macroscopic level, the universe /is/ ordered. (On a quantum
level, of course, it isn't, but such is life.) Interestingly enough,
I've also seen at least one article that describes the universe as a
gigantic fractal system...

Not really, but it's a lot better than 40ms. 40ms bites hefty wookalar
wong. (Me, I'll stick with my 6ms Radio Shack floppy drives...and /20ms/
IBM drives...)

The Martian Chronicles is fairly straightforward, if a little weird. The
reaction to it that's been displayed by more than one Fundamentalist
Christian group baffles me.

The problem with using hovercraft on public roads, of course, is...
no brakes! You can always toss an anchor overboard, though...
