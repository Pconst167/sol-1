Naah. Dee Snyder (Twisted Sister's lead singer) is about as straight
as they come. He's also really, really intelligent, remarkably
articulate, and in general the living antithesis of the rest of the
group. Last I heard, after he testified in front of the Senate during
that 'ban nasty rock music' flap a few years back, he got a real estate
license or some such obscure thing and started selling houses. Go

Nope, bad argument. To tell you the truth, I'm a bit disappointed in you
for raising it...I didn't expect that outa you. A child is not sexually
developed, and a child's sex organs are not capable of sexual activity.
Sex with a child generally results in injury to that child. Also, a
child is BY DEFINITION absolutely **not** capable of giving informed
consent to any sexual practice. Therefore, your argument doesn't work.

Not at all. The key phrase is "willing people". Someone who cannot give
***informed consent*** can reasonably be said to be 'unwilling' even if 
it is, say, a child who's been browbeaten into it. And in the other
cases you mentioned (flashers, peeping toms) the person who's BEING
flashed or peeped most likely did not give consent and is therefore
not "willing". Your argument /still/ doesn't hold any water, I'm
afraid.

  And you can keep a "kitty litter" box's odor to a minimum by changing

   Amazingly fun things to do with cats:
      1. Teach it to surf.
      2. Feed your baby sister to one. (Thanks, Max!)
      3. Tie tails together. Bet on tug-o-war.
      4. Put it on a leash.
      5. Try to teach to roll over, or play dead.
      6. Put cat-nip in a pit bull's collar.
   
   I mean, what can be done with cats? They sleep, they eat, and they
take the best seat in the house.  Sheesh.

You're weird. Obviously, the Wandering Aardvark of Unrequested Silly

are unconditionally guaranteed not to melt in your hand or your soul is

Cat urine is the most vile thing to come out of a living organism

Reasonably clean my arse.  
 
I like cats, though.  You have to >>persuade<< them to get out of your

What you need, Turtle, is a dog with a personality.
First, find a stray dog that someone has tried to kill at least once.
Instant psychotic.  Then, Take said dog and convince him that his nose
beeps every time it gets touched.  This is accomplished by following it 
around and making a beeping noise every time its nose touches something.
Trainging time is critical.  You MUST beep every time in the first few 
hours, this is critical.  Then, after he recovers from this, you have a 
dog with a sense of humility, a bit of curiosity (how, for instance, did
his nose stop beeping???) and finally, a little bit of an attitude, dogs
can hold grudges.
                    
It's all in the owner.

   Huh? I thought we were arguing whether "Anything's okay -- provided
nobody gets hurt and everyone agrees."  Granted. Children can't give
informed consent to sexual practices.  But a child might agree.
     
   All I'm saying is that the above statement seems too broad for my
ethical tastes, and I chose three fairly easy examples of why I 
disagree.  A child CAN say he/she agrees to be photographed nude (or
whatever... that doesn't physically hurt the child.) What do you
think of my other two points?

If the consent is not infomed and voluntary, it's not consent. Figure

individuals want to do, that does not involve harm to anyone involved.
If the consent is not informed, however, it should be immediately

Milord Scott Steel --
    The Pantheon of the Ghods, Ghodesses, Ghodlings, and Ghodnauts
contains not only the Aardvark, but also many creatures from Armadillos
to Zybbuks. (Unfortunately, no human has yet reached the Cosmic Stage
of Truth, Wisdom, and Incredulity to become more than a demiGhodnaut's
Personal Washroom Attendent.) There most certainly is an Armadillo of
Happines, just as certainly as there is a Gryphon of Pride.

dogs aren't the only creatures that tend to sniff genitals.
At my high school, there was a disproportionate number of 
jocks to non-jocks.  through observation(when not sleeping)
they tend to scratch their gonads just as, if not more, often
as their K-9 buddies.  not only that, but the (human?) species
sniff their hands when done.  it may of course be part of a sacred 
ritual which i have never been asked to participate in...but even
if asked..i think i'll decline.

Has anyone out there ever tried to imagine the concept of existence 
as being detached from conception.
* In other words:  The universe exists.  Everything in the universe 
exists.  How did all inside this universe come to exist?
The big bang.
How did what was inside the big bang get into that little singularity?
If you said "God"
           Where did God come from
     If you said "He is infinite"
                Imagine that.  Think about it.  If (S)(H)(s)he just 
                'is', then said deity exists, but was not concieved.
If you said "it formed from matter outside this universe"
    What exists there?  Under what rules?  Is it just there, or did
    IT begin somewhere too?  If it did, where did THAT come from?
 
Essentially, the two trains of thought are pretty similar.
 A) we don't know
 B) most people don't CARE
 
BUT hell, it's late, I'm tired and I figger I can make Rufus' brain
explode if I do this long enough.

i do understand that it was just a very long and drawn out
attempt at sarcasm, but it was simply turning out a little too 
long.  (i didn't want another hampster episode).  As for chastisement,
for being a false prophet, you are doomed to spend an enternity
in a run down mall speedwalking to try to keep legions of old people 
from running you over with their shopping carts

That was the old, stressed out Rufus.  My new outlook on life is that

to be tolerant and figured that he just needed to get it off his chest..
... it also occured to me that he might be pulling my leg..... 
 
But after 15 minutes of solid preaching.... I knew it was no joke, I 
had flashbacks to the Jehova (sp) visits. I tried to reason with him

I don't think he'd just do it  to anyone..... I dunno. But I'm not going
to plaster his name and number all over and embarrass the guy.... after
all, if everyone thinks his bbs is just a front for "witnessing" he's 
either going to get No calls or crank calls. I dunno why he picked me 
to "preach to". Maybe because of my age, the fact that I'm married with
children and he didn't place me in the same slot with the others that 
would give him peer pressure for "expressing his beliefs". I'm sure He
thought he was doing Gods work.... but jamming something down someones

I took the "pill" for several years. Yes it's true that some women 
may experience problems after being on the pill for several years. 
I did, but I stopped taking it as soon as I developed some of the first
symptoms (brown spots on skin, absense of menstration) and everything 
returned to normal quite quickly.... 
Almost any form of birth control has side effects with the exeption 
of the "rubber" and a "diaphram". 
There is only one "natural" method of birth control..... the Rhythm 
method,,,, it has one "Big" side effect.

I haven't seen either of those. Have you seen the NAPA ads?
They're the best I've seen in a while.
 
This year's 'Rediculous ad' award goes to the ziplock bag company.

<This is Dragonfly, NOT the False Prophet, talking about religion. Yes,
this time I'm serious.>  If you really feel it's your calling to witness
to people -- if you really feel God has told you to preach the Word --
then the best thing to do is to talk gently with everyone else, learn 
their own religious viewpoints, and make it very easy for them to change
them to the viewpoint God gave you.
   In other words, let them take the 'easy road' of slowly changing 
their beliefs -- not cramming it down their throats.

No problem.  I understand why you don't want to say whose board it was.
But, from your description, it wasn't one of the Christian boards around
the area (Solomon's Portico and the half-gone Victory Life Line) -- 
which was what I was expecting.

   Every kind of birth control has side effects.  Can they be lived 
with?  Even condoms sometimes cause problems: one friend I know is 
allergic to Nonoxyl-9.  That's why you should get your information from
a reliable source.

Yeah, I did say the Pill has side effects, not everyone has them, and 
with regular visits to the Doctor (as all sexually active women should 
go at least once a year anyway) any side effects can be detected before
they cause any serious problems. The human body is a wonderous thing. 
It usually lets you know well in advance if it isn't liking what you 
are doing to it.....  The Pill is a very good form of birth control is 
used correctly and if you regularly visit your physician....

DF>BC (Birth Control) it's a nasty thought, (killing a living being) 
 
Whoa!!!!!!! Wait a sec..... Birth control is meant to avoid such things.
..... for instance, the pill stops a woman from ovulating, therefore, 
the sperm never finds an egg and conception never takes place..... 
And both the condom and the diaphram prevent the sperm from reaching 
the egg, so therefore, again, conception never takes place..... 
Birth control isn't murder, it's prevention of pregnancy....
