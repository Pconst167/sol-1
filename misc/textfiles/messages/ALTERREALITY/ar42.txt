 Speaking of 2 Live Crew, I think we should all celebrate the fact that 
they've been found not guilty in their obscenity trial. I would rather 
retch in a gas chamber than listen to their album, but I follow the idea
that "I might not like what you say, but I will defend your right to say

  Yeah, well, I go to school and get excellent grades and all the idiots
with shitferbrains get everything. 
  Actually, I can see your point, but it takes all sorts to make up a 
world (now isn't that a cliche if ya ever heard one?). We happen to have
those who don't like something about the government. Ifthe whole reason
for having the government like it is, why should we keep those from not 
liking it. Those who are degrading it only want to change it.

  Okay, we'll get someone else's. Like you said, I wouldn't do anything 
that hurts someone. Burning a flag doesn't hurt anyone, and if anything,
it's only going to affect someone else's opinions. Maybe the burner will
have second thoughts about it later. But it doesn't hurt anyone.

  Which sounds fine to me. Now, it's forced. Every day we do it. The

morning. The same people who think flag burning is wrong (not all, but

Aha! I think I finally understand the Specialist's position! You
CAN'T burn the United States if you disagree with it -- you can't 
destroy it. But, you can destroy the thing which has become closest
(in the minds of people) to it -- the symbol representing the U.S.
In his mind, those that destroy the symbol are those that want to
destroy the nation as a whole.
    
   Personally, I kind of doubt that logic. The last time I checked,
most of those flag burners only wanted to make major changes in the
government. Not destroy it entirely.

  Absolutely true, but I don't get /your/ metaphor this time. We don't

  Bad idea to quote that. There's only one version of Revolution that

  Well, it might make you feel better to know that if I was wearing a

  No, they wouldn't, but /I/ would!! If they're complaining about the 
country, silencing them would be stupid. You're going to stir up more 
trouble that way. And to just say "those who are right and those who are
pathetic" is REALLY out of line, since there is no "right" or "wrong", 
it all depends on what you think. You're not totally wrong. Sure, doing
something about flag burners would be right to some extent, but it would

The original convertees changed from fear? Of what or of whom? As far as
I recall, the Roman Empire was not very tolerant of the early
Christians. If they would have been fearful, who would they have feared
more: the powerful Roman Empire, or the fledgling Church?
     
I don't want to debate your second point ("Human nature is the same

Okay. It's a '72 Baja bug (engine sticks out the back, with a roll
cage around it), grey with black fenders and swords on the sides,
with two fog lights on the roof (like Mickey Mouse ears) and two on
the bumper and a floodlight on the back. The hood is silver, and it
comes complete with digital tach, digital clock, and James Bond
control system that operates the various weird accessories and whatnot.
Thje engine itself has a stinger exhaust that comes out /sideways/;
it's kinda odd-looking. What it doesn't have, sadly, is a battery
that works and an operational fourth gear--problems that a hundred
bucks or so could fix, bit it's a hundred bucks I don't have.

Christianity is not alone in believing that the diety "saves" his
worshippers by either leaving or dying--but Christianity is the only
one I can think of where the diety dies by being murdered by the people
who are sinning against him in the first place. Notice that I only
referred to Christianity as "slightly silly;" the entire New Age
movement qualifies as "extremely silly"... I would still maintain that
historically Christianity has done more harm than not. Christianity
brought us the burning of the library at Alexandria, the Spanish
Inquisitions, the Crusades (a total unmitigated disaster for most
of Europe), and an entire period in history we now know as the Dark
Ages. Christianity stands squarely opposed to reason and science--they
excommunicated Galileo seven hundred years ago, and warned Dr. Stephen
Hawking to stop research into the Big Bang theory two years ago (on
the grounds, get this, that the beginning of the Universe is "not for
man to know"). Even Islam, ofr all its bad press in the Western world,
is not that reactionary; Muslim societies invented astronomy, higher
mathematics, and history, and during the period Christianity was
"maintaining order" in Europe most of the Middle East was united under
the Persain Empire in a period noted both for its stability AND for
its tolerance of other cultures and other faiths (something you'd
be hard-pressed to say about Europe during the same period, no matter
how much you value "stability"). On the whole, Christianity doesn't
strike me in any way as having /anything/ that sets it apart from any
of a hundred other religions, other than its size 8which is hardly
a compelling argument in favor of it), and actually actively UNimpresses
me with its history--you'd think that the living religion of the God of
Love wouldn't be noteworthy primarily for the number of people that
it's killed and the amount of suffering that it has caused.

That7s the sort of thing I'm talking about. You do have a valid point:
most people who profess a religion are professing the one they were
raised with, and relatively few people of *ANY* religion have either
thought objectively about their beliefs or even bothered to become
acquainted with other belief systems before deciding that they have
The Truth. However, phrasing it the way you did kind of clouds your
point with emotionally-charged language, and it's not likely to

   You've left me even more confused. Are you seriously saying that
all male-influenced rules (let alone simply all male rules!) are
virtually identical? Have all male rulers throughout history been
almost identical? Or, better yet, have all rulers that have been
influenced by males (whether they be male or not) been virtually
identical? The answer seems obvious.
    
    Even in religions, male-influenced religions are not the same.
Buddhism is not Islam; Taoism is not Stoicism. Calling the worship 
of Jupiter nearly the same as the worship of Christ is, well, 
unusual and anachronistic.

   Would all cars stop running if the Department of Transportation
shut down? Would we lose our stomachs if the FDA closed? Neither of
those government agencies produce the cars we drive or the food we
eat; they only regulate it. 
   If the Federal government shut down completely and permanently, we'd
have some problems (Sinclair's The Jungle comes to mind), but not
insurmountable ones. Other non-government watchdog agencies would
come into existence to watch over our food and autos. Airlines would
begin to pay for the control tower if they had to.
    
   Granted. There would be a lot of shifting and changing if the 
Federal government closed down permanently. And I'm not saying it
would be a good thing. (I would miss the Post Office as well! Could
it survive without a Federal government constantly pumping money 
into it?) But -- mankind would survive without the Federal government.

to keep our police forces.)

Granted.
    
T> ...but Christianity is the only one I can think of where the deity

   Christianity is also the only religion I can think of which adds
one more piece of guilt: it claims that any sin committed is also 
against God. Because of its broad definition of sin, everyone is a
sinner. By Christianity's own logic, if Christ were killed, He must
have been killed by someone who was sinning against him.
    
T> I would still maintain that Christianity has done more harm than

T> Alexandria...
     
   There haven't been revolutionary Muslims? Indeed, I recall that at
least one group of Muslims had the belief about books "If it contradicts
the Koran, it's heresy and should be burned. If it doesn't contradict
the Koran, it's unnecessary and should be burned." If you're interested,
I'll find where I got that from.
    
T> the Spanish Inquisitions...
    
   That, I agree, was a blotch against Europe for the first part of it.
It did a lot of evil in the Americas as well, but it did at least a
smidgeon of good. 
     
T> the Crusades (a total, unmitigated disaster for most of Europe)
    
   Wait! I wouldn't claim that. Certainly, some of the Crusades were
hideously cruel, especially the so-called "Children's Crusade." But
without the Crusades, Europe would have remained the closed world
it was during the Dark Ages, with little interaction with the Arab
world or the world of the Orient. It broke Europe of its provincial
mentality, and they began to create the mindset which flourished in
the Rennaisance. They introduced Europe to new and old ideas, and
began to break the overwhelming power of the Church.

T> ...and an entire period we now know as the Dark Ages.
    
   Again, I disagree with your historical analysis. It seems to me
that Christianity was not the cause of the Dark Ages; it merely filled
the vacuum left by the destruction of the Roman Empire. No power
existed at the time that was strong enough to fill the shoes of the
Empire, so the Church tried to create a spiritual empire. Without
the Christian church, it is quite possible that the Dark Ages would
have been even darker.
    
T> Christianity stands squarely opposed to reason and science.
    
   I disagree strongly with the first statement, but I agree with the
second. Christianity has never opposed reason. One of the greater
things to emerge from the Dark Ages was the entire system of logic
we now use, the so-called "classical logic." However, their premises
are not and have not been based on science, so they disagree strongly
with science.
     
>Even Islam, for all its bad press in the Western world, is not that
>reactionary. Muslim societies invented astonomy, higher mathematics,
>and history...
    
   Astronomy was invented well before the Roman Empire, in Persia, I
believe. Well before the Prophet came out of Medina. History has 
existed nearly as long as writing has existed: indeed, much of the
Old Testament could be considered folk history. Higher mathematics
was also created along similar lines in China.
    
>On the whole, Christianity doesn't have anything which would strike me
>as particularly noteworthy, except for its size...
     
   I won't argue in matters of taste.
    
>...you'd think that the living religion of the God of Love wouldn't
>be noteworthy for the number of people it's killed and the amount
>of suffering it's caused.
     
   Again, I disagree that's what Christianity is noted for. But, in the
annals of human record, suffering and death is much more interesting
and much more likely to be recorded than life and love.

   Actually, you have my argument there, but backwards. Let me 
rephrase it better. One of your users (who has since recanted) said
something like, "I think people should be allowed to do what they
want to do." I then gave extreme examples of what that statement is
saying: if someone wants to murder another, should s/he be allowed
to do it? Most people -- including him -- said no, that should not
be allowed. Therefore, that idea wasn't a very good one.
       
    I never have argued for any activity X that if X were permissable,
then people would also feel they have the right to murder others.

   Geesssh. I'm too moral for that (and stupid, in one sense)... I
probably should charge money for that. Then I won't always be broke :)
 
  I did learn something yesterday, though. You can't hook an IBM VGA 
monitor to a Tandy 1000 SL...

If you take a person's shoe size and divide it by the caliber of a 
bullet fired at him, you'll get the distance (in centimeters) that 
person can move before being hit.
 
hhh don't forget the inverse relationship between the shoesize/calibre
is related to the square of the pucker factor and directly related to 
the inertia stress of initial evasive manuevers.

  Buddhism is different... Not ALL male gods, just the bad ones.
   There are two incarnations of male deities. For instance, Take
 the Anibus..and Osiris. these are the example of the different.
  Dionysus and 'God' are the same. Give patronage to Dionysus for joy
and happiness or find that your life takes a bad twist(This is a bad 
example)  there is an incarnation of a good male god, and an evil male
god. In other words, there are two male gods, and they represent the two
didderent types of gods. They ARE the same god, figuratively, in diffe-
rent incarnations...

Um, the effectiveness of private watchdogs aside (do you really believe
that without the authority of law behind them, a private watchdog
could force changes on GM?), without the Department of Transportation
I-75 would soon be in even worse shape than it already is. We need a
Federal government to provide services that span states (like: fund
the interstate system), to provide services that the states are not
equipped to provide (international relations, defense, and the like),
and to arbitrate matters between states (ie, arbitrate laws (hence,
the Supreme Court) and the like).

Yes. That's what I just said. Astronomy was a Persian innovation;

The science of history, I believe I credited to the Muslims. That is,
an approach to history that is not based on folklore and championing
of the "right" side. Ibn' Khaldun is generally regarded in most circles
as being the world's first true historian. A guess as to his faith,

Sorry to take so long to get back to everybody.  I've been VERY busy the
last few days.  To answer your    question,  I dont't know whether that 
bothers me or not (even if it may or may not be true).  Even if it is 
documented in some book(s), that 
of course does not make in necessarily true.  You on the other hand can 
use that same argument regarding  the Bible.  But I respond to that with
'all religions are matter of faith'.  I would like to believe 
christianity  is the product of a group of people who know what they are
pushing.

  Well, I am, but I don't like the sort of social situations it provides
... Combining my physical appearance and my personality seems to total 
up to a social outcast (or as I like to sayone of the "strange medium

  My problem is that I often appologize for everything, I'm kinda
passive, and I often miss things that have been said and/or put my foot 
in my mouth. 
  
  In other words, I am pretty happy with who I am when alone or with 
people I'm comfortable with, but extremely flustered and self-conscious 
when dealing with others...
 
  And, as you may see, I feel a need to share my problems and try to get
solutions from just about anyone. That's another of the problems.. (that
is unless I'm mistaken in assuming most people don't really want to hear
about my problems.)

a different angle on the problem needs to be tried. I'd like to see what

Yes I generally agree with that, However, people are also a product of

fearful of christians fearing I might become a victim.  If I never saw 
the same about blacks, whites, hispanics, etc I would not be fearful of 
them. My point being, as I said
