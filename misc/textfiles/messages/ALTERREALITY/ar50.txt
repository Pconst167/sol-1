>It is still a nonsense word. Who would be afraid of a pansy?
    
   ALL phobias are irrational, including homophobia. That doesn't mean
they're not real. 
    
   A mix 'n match collection of phobias:
    
pedophobia (fear of children);  hagiophobia (fear of saints);   theo-
phobia (fear of God);  ailurophobia (fear of cats);   vermiphobia (fear
of worms);   anthophobia (fear of flowers);   aulophobia (fear of 
flutes);   eisoptrophobia (fear of mirrors);   chrometophobia (fear of
money);   trichophobia (fear of hair);   doraphilia (love of fur);
barophobia (fear of gravity);   cymophobia (fear of waves);   eoso-
phobia (fear of dawn); dikephobia (fear of justice);  chromophobia (fear
of color);   agyrophobia (fear of crossing a street).;..
    
   The list just goes on and on... All of those are REAL fears, caused
by irrational reasons. Nobody in her right mind would say that there
is anything terrible to fear in any of the above...

I doubt ANYONE could be as far from the point as your last message.
     
>You don't want to fight, you criticize those who would, yet you
>enjoy all the benefits of a country that has fought many times
>to maintain it's freedom... am I right?
    
   First of all, I doubt the most dedicated soldier in the field
WANTS to fight. (Unless he's a psychopath...) Nobody wants to die
for their country. Most soldiers have resigned themselves to the fact
that they may have to die, that's all.
   Secondly, this war is NOT about the freedoms of this country. It is
strictly a war for economic reasons. Our Illustrious Leaders have de-
cided that it would be cheaper in the long run to fight this war (and,
incidentally, pull this country from its recession) than it would be
to pay higher prices for oil.  Kuwait is not a democracy. In fact, it
doesn't have the equivalent of our Bill of Rights. This is NOT a war
to save the country.
     
   It seems you're dividing all of us into black and white: pacifists
and 'True Americans.' Not only is it simplistic, it's wrong. Almost
all Americans will fight bravely if our nation is attacked physically.
Not all Americans feel it's worth the sacrifice of our soldiers to
keep the cost of oil down.
    
   Let me phrase it to you this way: If by suiciding, you know that
oil will sell at $15/ barrel for the next five years, would you
suicide? Is YOUR, personal life worth it to know that the cost of
oil will be low for the next few years? If not, why would you send
thousands of others to their deaths for that purpose?

  I don't think that's the main thing that was floating around here. The
Specialist is always opinionated, and he just stated that he didn't like
the song. His expanded comments, including the one about money going to 
the artists, came after Turtle and I claimed that the song wasn't a 
piece of junk.
 
  BTW, where did you hear about where the money goes? I saw a couple 
reports on TV about the making of the song, and they NEVER mentioned 
where the money is going. I'm not trying to disagree with you, but if
they aren't more forthright in telling where the profit goes, more 
people might assume what The Specialist did.

it really an irrational fear (phobia) if the poor sucker that aquired
the fear did so because he was pursued and subsequently ravished by

Oh yes he would - The Specialist really is a nice guy (I've met him)

that he doesn't really give a shit if anyone agrees/disagrees with him
just respect his position as his right to have the one that he does.
*that* is the part that most folks have real trouble with.  You can see
that gay people have a right to their lifestyle and system of beliefs
but you have to also give the bigots the same rights.  Ain't it a
marvellous country?  Dave is entitled to despise gay people and have any

The "women are more emotionally stable" and "women have more stamina"
bits come from a long and, in the end, fruitless career in psychology
and physiological psychology I had in college while still pursuing a
combined degree in neurobiology and computer science. There's ample
evidence out there that common American sexual stereotypes are myths,
including a few societies where men are considered to be too weak to
do any real work. Anyway, the upshot of all this is: Women, in general,
react to stress better than men. (Think about it--you don't often
hear of female Type A personalities getting stress ulcers or having
heart attacks at the age of 35.) Women deal better, on average (note
the phrase--it does NOT imply ANYTHING about particular men and women)
with physical pain, with emotional trauma, and with constant stress--
all important considerations in a battlefield. Crying has nothing to
do with it.

Thank you. And I would like to explain a little bit about statistics.
On the average, men are better than women at standardized math tests.
However, from that you cannot make any predictions about the relative
performance of an average male plucked at random from the street vs.
a random female plucked from the street. Group samplings apply to
GROUPS, and don't allow you to make specific statements about specific
individuals. If I find you a woman who can do better than you, or
than I, on a standardized math test--and believe me, I can--it doesn't
change the fact that men, on average, do better than women on standard-
ized math tests.
 
I say again: Women, on average, have better stamina than men.

Good for you.
 
By the way, where did the subject "various" come from? I was just
digging through the message base doing maintenance, and noticing that
messages with that subject line were cropping up over three months ago.
Anyone remember where "various" came from??

  I know you said it was a bad example, but a lot of guys wouldn't cry 
in public because they wouldn't want to be seen. Its an old thing, but 
it still holds true for some guys. There are probably some REALLY 
emotionally unstable guys who wouldn't EVER cry in public and keep their
problems to themselves. Of course, if you carry this out, it could make

  I don't believe that if you advocate non-violence, it doesn't mean 
that you wouldn't fight.  Most people would rather have peace than war, 
so does that mean that they wouldn't fight if they had to? I don't 
really want to get into the war, or any conflict because a) I wouldn't 
like it b) I wouldn't be very confident that I would do very well and c)
I hope the war wouldn't be that serious. This doesn't mean that if I was

The Gap is a mall clothing store. The average, run-of-the-mill person
with little experience is more likely to take a job at a shopping mall

The songs Give Peace a Chance and We Didn't Start The Fire are
/nothing/ alike. The lyrics to We Didn't Start have EVERYTHING to
do with the chorus. That song is a response to something one of Billy
Joel's fans told him one day, along the lines of "All the world's
problems started after the 60's and if everyone were today the way they
were then we wouldn't have these problems. They are all the fault of the
current generation." The song is a litany of the social and political
problems that occurred before or had their roots in the 60's and 70's,
and the refrain "We Didn't Start the Fire" is directly related to those
lyrics. What he's saying is "Hey, look, we didn't start all these
problems; look at this, this, and this, all of which were not the
respnsibility of the current generation." If you don't think that
the lyrics and refrain have anything to do with each other, you don't
get the song.

My point was this:  What good is a pacifist's opinion, when it comes
to anything war related?  All they can tell you is that you shouldn't
fight.  
 
And one more thing...this war is not for the sake of convenience. It 
is a necessary war.  Petty dictators like Hussien, left unchecked 
turn into Hitlers.  And whether you like it or not, this country runs
on oil, and isn't likely to change in the near future.  So if it means
sending troops over there to stop a mideast takeover, then it needs to
be done.  Bush made a choice, the lesser of the two evils.  You saw how 
people got riled when the oil companies raised thier prices 15 to 20 
cents; what if they'd raised it a dollar, not because they wanted to,
but because that's what they were paying?  Figure the odds.  If we let
Hussien do what he wanted, then that's what'd probably happen.
 
Furthermore, don't chew me out because I am willing to bear out my
responsibilities to this country and someone else doesn't want to do
SHIT for his country.

Depends, I suppose.  If he was introduced to me and didn't act like a 
flaming faggot, and didn't show any telltale signs, and no one told me
that he was, I imagine I'd treat him like anyone else.  
 But if he was introduced to me, acted like a flaming faggot, I'd be 
...I'd stay away from him as much as possible, and if he approched me,
I'd warn him that I am the violent type, and if he didn't go away right
away, I wouldn't hesitate to demonstrate.  I absolutely HATE that type 
of behavior.
  But, if someone told me he was a faggot, and he didn't act like one
at all, then I'd reserve my judgement until all the facts were in. 
Kinda stay back but watch closely.  Can't automatically assume someone
is a fag just because you are told he is.  Unless, he admitted it. Then
in that case, I'd stay away from him, and treat him as if he were a 
flamer, like in example one. An admitted fag is almost as bad as a 
flamboyant flamer.
 
  There are exceptions to the above, like for instance if an admitted
fag who was not a flamer needed my help and I was the only one who could
help him then I guess (depending on the severity of the need) I would
help.   This is an extreme exception.

<Sigh.> This conversation sounds familiar. 
   What good is a war hawk's opinion on anything war related? All he'll
(or she'll) tell you is you should fight.
   Face it: for good or bad, we live in a democracy. If there's enough
popular support for a war, we fight. If enough pacifists come into the
scene (especially if enough voting pacifists come into the scene!), we
withdraw. Politicians care only about one thing: staying in office. If
withdrawing troops from the Middle East will keep them in office, so muc
the better.
    
   My personal position on the war is that it is not a just war. Yes,
we have an excellent reason for starting the war (the takeover of Kuwait
is more than sufficient reason.) We have an international organization
on our side as well. My fault with the war: we did not try out all 
possible other measures to prevent the need for war. You know that I
don't feel the sanctions were given enough time! Five months' sanctions,
and you expect Saddam to fall to his knees? No way.
   
   I feel the greatest of all goods would be to starve Iraq out of 
Kuwait.
   
   Finally, not one of the users of this board (that I've noticed!) has
claimed that they would be draft-dodging, should the war come down to
that. I certainly would have the easiest time of it: not only do I
speak Spanish, but my parents own a house in Mexico. Much better
climate than Canada, no? 
   Even still, I would mention my several physical problems. When I
scored within the top 10 percentile on the pre-ASVAB, I got calls from
all the U.S. armed forces... I mentioned my problems to each, and they
stopped calling.

I'm not asking whether or not a homosexual chooses whether to sleep with
another of his/her same gender. I'm asking whether a homosexual chose to
have the sexual interests he/she has.
    
Another question for you in the same vein:
    
   If a homosexual never slept with someone of his/her gender, would 
you still consider that person a homosexual?

   In an effort to be Politically Correct, and create a Non-Gender
Specific English (herein referred to NGS English), Dragonfly is adding
a new word to the a/R lexicon... or, at least Dragonfly's dictionary.
     
   The word is "thon," short for "that one," meaning "he, she, or it."
    
   Why bother? I've said several times before that English needs a non-
gender specific pronoun. 'Thon' was one of the most successful, back
in the 19th century. I'm giving it a second shot.
    
   Instead of saying something like,
'...with another of his/her same gender...", I'll be saying:
    
'...with another of thon's gender...' 
    
   Instead of saying:
'God lives! He, She, or the Divine It still brings people closer to
Him, Her, or It!", I'd be saying:
    
"God lives! Thon still brings people closer to Thon!"

Welcome him to the wonderful world of institutional Fascism, then..he's
being tapped. The modem won't pick up the phone most likely because the
tap has caused a drop in line voltage that's large enough that his modem
can't detect the ring signal. Using a different modem might help; he
can also bitch at GTE, but that probably won't accomplish anything.

I would have to agree with you, that a person's sexual preference makes
no difference as to how well they do at thier jobs (or whatever) in 
society.  
 
However, I would not hire one, and I would not work with one.
 
As for skin color in the army, there were several of difference races
and backgrounds that I liked and disliked.  And of religious preferences
too, but that makes no nevermind to me.
 
However, being black is a genetic thing.  Being homo is a matter of
choice.  I see no reason to prefer the same sex over the opposite sex.
It is contra-survival.  Anti-instinctual.  Sick.  Abnormal.  Sick.

TS>I will amend my definition of homoperversity: or wanting to.

   Do you really feel a person has the ability to control thon's own
desires? How?
   When you have a craving for chocolate (or a good German beer, or 
whatever), you might ignore the craving, but I doubt you'd deny it
exists. You might choose not to yield to the craving, or you might
choose to only partially yield (carob instead of chocolate; Busch 
instead of Beck's), or you might decide to completely yield -- but
you don't deny the craving. 
  In the same way, a homosexual might agree thon's desires are wrong
(and, yes, I've met at least two people who feel that way!) and decide
never to succumb to them again. But thon still feels the desire!
   BTW, have you ever taken a course in psychology? You might find
some of the concepts... interesting. (Including that everyone has
'homopervertual' desires.)

No. Actually, it's simply wax. The heat of the light bulb melts it,
causing it to expand and become less dense than the liquid (a heavy
oil, I think) that it's in, so it floats. When it cools, it contracts
slightly and sinks.

Nope, that's not true. There is a fair amount of evidence to suggest
that sexual preference is NOT a matter of choice, and that it DOES
have a genetic component. Think about it...do you /choose/ to be
attracted to women? If (Heaven forbid) you actually wanted to, do you
think you could /choose/ to get turned on by guys? Choice has very
little to do with it. You can CHOOSE to act on the attraction, but
you can't choose who you're attracted to.

"The Enterprise Incident." The Enterprise deliberately violated the
Neutral Zone and tangled with a Romulan heavy cruiser, pioleted by
a female commander. The Enterprise surrendered to the Romulan ship,
and Kirk, disguised as a Romulan, transported over to the ship to
attempt to steal its cloaking device. He was caught; Spock (who the
Romulan commander had a crush on) transported over to that ship and
confronted Kirk, who attacked him and was "killed" by the "Vulcan
death grip." Now, with Kirk safely "dead," he had an opportunity to
steal the cloaking device and return to the Enterprise with it...
at least that's pretty much how I think it went. It was sort of a cool
episode.

Manifest Bullshit (tm). You might find that certain aspects of
homosexuality are normal, but that doesn't mean EVERYONE has them,
just that a LOT of people have them. You cannot truthfully say
"Everyone has two legs," so how on Earth can you say "Everyone
has this or that complex psycho-emotional motivation" or some such

you have just erred. You can't even say everyone has two brain

Education?  I guess not.  Not that I have any objections, but with the
current budget cuts, I think the first thing that needs to go is the 
sports program (or at least reduce it to one or two basic p.e. classes).
Call me silly, but I always thought school was for education.  I've hear
(d) that one local high school will have between 40-50 students in each
class.  I'm glad I'll be escaping the school system this year, but I

Well, they won't stick to the ground, but that's only because they are

ground, but when you peel it up it leaves no sticky residue.  Did you 
know Post-It fish were originally developed to be a bookmark that 
wouldn't slip out of your book or lift the printing off?  They ditched

If schools were really for education, do you think they'd spend more
money on say... computer equipment than athletic equipment? Really, now.
    
   Seriously, sports has a place in the school system, of course. But
I notice that newspapers all over the state were reporting on the best
high-school athlete -- and which college he was going to. I've never
once seen a report about the best student in the state. 
   Our society places sports on a pedestal: you can become a SOMEBODY
if you're good at sports. What no one says: it's ten thousand times
more difficult to become a somebody through sports than it is to 
become somebody through education.
   What effect will it have on future students? Learning will become
harder, so many students won't put out the effort. The athletes will
still be praised, the academics thrown in a corner. And the rift will
widen.

You have a good point there, Dragonfly. I have rarely seen students
with good grades praised over good athletes. And it's easier to get a 
scholarship in sports than in grades. And what happens to all the
college educated athletes after the ball drops? A lot of them barely 
made acceptable grades, only a few come out ahead.

   Huh? That one I'm not so sure of. Yes -- there are BIGGER 
scholarships for sports than for academics (the average player can get
his entire tuition payed for...), but I'm not sure it's easier.
   I was unusual: several Christian colleges were so desperate to get
me, they told me to just show up on the first day of classes. My
education was already payed for, and if I showed up, I'd be automat-
ically enrolled. 
   New College didn't quite go that far: I still had to register. But
they payed for food and housing for my first three years (until I
broke the terms of two of my scholarships.)

Well, a marked tendency to scream loudly while slamming with great

Nope, as a matter of fact, I didn't. I thought Post-It fish were
developed to combat the problem of fish sticking to the ground; that's
why they always come in packages of two, so if you get two Post-It
fish and a fish the Post-It fish will stick to the fish and the fish
won't stick to the ground. Of course, it's also a more humane way to
fish, since you can tie the Post-It fish to the line and when the
Post-It fish stick to the fish you got three fish that can be
reeled in very tidily.

About the best educational scholarship I've seen was offered by the
University of New Orleans.  Any National Merit Finalist would get
1) Room, board, books, tuition for four years.
2) $2000 a year bribe, err I mean spending money
3) A computer and printer in the dorm room.
4) A Summer in Europe to 'study.'
 
We checked out the school.  With a 98% acceptance rate, and something 
like 52% leaving after the first year, we figured it safe to say the
school wasn't very good.

   Look, I know you don't know me but I would really like to meet you. 
Shit, I like to meet anyone who is as engrossed by Star Trek as I am.
   The reason for the caution in this letter is because now I know you
are female.  Few females last on this BBS. Also, with the stigma of 
today's society, if you decide to come over, I would want you to feel
comfortable, not uneasy.  
   So I propose a plan.  Write to the boards or call me today, Thursday.
If you feel it's necessary, we can meet someplace neutral.
Be fore the marathon, or tonight or today between 3:30p.m. and 6:00p.m.
(^that's before not be fore) I hate typos.  
   So, what do you say?

Agreed, although I don't think you'll find a textbook anywhere what
says "everyone has homosexual (homopervertual, whatever) tendencies."
It can be argued that homosexual tendencies can b considered "normal"
in most people, but I'm not even sure I'd go that far. I will venture,
though, that they're more common than most people imagine.
