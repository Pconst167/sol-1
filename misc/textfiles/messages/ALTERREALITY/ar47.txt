	     Well it'll be Multi-Node.....(It'll only be able to handle 4 nodes
though....).. It won't be Fido-Bet.. there is a bulletin board system 
out there called WWIV that is VERY popular.. there are over 17 of that 
type of board in the WWIV net in the 813 ac.  The way it works is when 
you goto logon if you input -@!NETWORK!@- as your name it'll run the net
program...blah, blha blha.. no fronbt end is required.. and this is a
very popular system.. there are over a few thousend around...(the 
including ones in Mexico, Germany, and Austraia..(those are the only 
other countries that *I've* sent mail to.. anyway it is a good system 
and that is how I think I'm gonna set it up.....  But right now with
the release of Turbo Pascal 6.0 and Turbo Vision it has been delayed
so I can work on ym Multi-tasking windows program.. hopefully to be done
soon.. BETA copies are on Suncaost City if interested.

As a caveat, I would strongly recommend doing a FIDO capable system
over a WWIV-capable one. For starters, FIDO is larger than WWIV by
an order of magnitude, and there are more echoes on more topics
for FIDO and FIDO-like networks (of which there are probably over a
hundred, each of which uses FIDO software and transfer protocols). If
you are planning to release or market your program, if it supports
WWIV but not FIDO you will, I fear, find MUCH less demand for it.

Well... speaking on a strictly existential basis - don't we all?
Of course we should take our personal dogma (whatever it may be as
a "religious" belief) as the basis of comparison.  What actually annoys
you so is the fact that they believe in a superior being and you don't.
If you *really* wanna have fun - ask them why you shouldn't believe in
the "Little People", changelings and the rest of mythology that has
been a matter of certain "knowledge" of years past..  My trouble is

Making a BBS package only capable of networking with itself isn't
all that good an idea if you're planning to distribute the software,
for no other reason than because Fido's been around for as long as it
has and it's as big as it is (and if you don't like FidoNet, there
are literally dozens of other networks that use the same software...)
FidoNet, for all its problems, kludges, and bizzare hacks, has also
become established enough that it's capable of doing all sorts of things
that aren't likely to occur to someone who's working on his own
networking from scratch, and for that matter there is even software out
there that will connect FidoNet to UseNet and InterNet; obviously,
there's a lot of people dedicating a lot of effort to Fido software
(grin). Fido protocol is a royal pain in the ASS to implement, but you
are not likely to find all that much interest in your software if it
networks but can't do Fido.

No, at least not to the same extent the Jehovah's Witnesses do.
Speaking in a strictly NON-existential, practical basis, they
interpret literally everything they see in terms of their religion.
There is **nothing** which has no religious overtones to some of these
people. Their religion colors the way they listen to music, the way
they interact with everyone from McDonald's counter people to their
co-workers, the way they read the newspaper... I have a Jehovah's
Witness pamphlet that explains how clean a JW should keep his house
(too clean is vanity, not clean enough is disrespectful to God)
and even (I am NOT making this up!!) how many times per day a proper
Christian should wash their hands. These people literally cannot wash
their hands without perceiving religious overtones to the act. THAT
is what I am talking about when I say they see the world in terms of
their religion, and nothing /but/ their religion. It is not a matter
of their beliefs not coinciding with mine at all; I don't agree with
your beliefs, but I don't accuse YOU of being unable to interpret
events in anything other than religious terms...

Well, actually, I'm referring to an article about "how clean to
keep your house and clothing" in an issue of the Watchtower. It's
really fascinating stuff--seems a proper Christian washes his hands
exactly three times a day, excluding special circumstances (changing
the oil in his car, presumably, which the Bible tells us must be
done religiously every 6,000 miles). More than that is a sign of
vanity. The article also explains how much proper Christians ought
to spend on their wardrobe, how often proper Christians will wash their
car, and other profound stuff. (I have another issue that explains
why a proper Christian must never, ever watch a movie that has an
"R" rating. That more than anything else has convinced me that the
organization behind the Jehovah's Witnesses is more interested in
control than in moral purity...surely, from a moral standpoint, every
movie ought to be rated on its own merit. There are some R-rated movies
which attempt to make a moral point, and PG movies that'd curl the
toes of these people...)

   My worthy opponent has claimed, without giving any reasons other
than emotional, that smurfs deserve rights. Although I also find smurfs
to be "cute," even a glimpse of the facts wil prove his position
unbtenable.
   
   1. Smurfs infest mushroom patches, making them unsuitable for
      human consumption. In some cases destroying up to half of a
      farmer's crop, smurfs house themselves with no respect for
      human boundaries.
   
   2. Although they appear human-like, the near 30-1 male/female
      ratio of smurfs belies their unusual sex lives. Young children
      may be morally scarred for life by their ritual "banging up
      Smurfette."
    
   3. Smurfs are an excellent source of meat, providing wonderful
      flavor for soups, stews, roasts, and all other traditional
      ways of cooking meat. Their light, veal-like flesh is a 
      delightful, low-calorie alternative to chicken or fish.
    
   4. They are a known cause of noise pollution, magic pollution,
      and more than several have been implicated in mischief.
     
   In light of these facts, I propose that the Smurf hunting season
be extended to year-round, until such a time that the Smurf population
be reduced to managable levels.

Most BBSes you come across will be in 80-column format. There aresome
80-column terminal programs available for the C64.

  If you could show me one, I would be grateful. I have one, and it's
annoying. The font is hard to read, and the screen won't scroll or clear
 it just keeps going back to the top and clearing and writing line by 
line. At least if it does that, it should put some space between the old
and new.
 
  I hope Roberto understands that you don't have to only call Commodore 
boards and you can read 80 coulumn boards with 40 columns...

Tink's Place 8which may be down). There are 80-column terminal programs
for C=64 machines out there; perhaps findong one of them might be

I've been on Zimmcomm BBS.  They can use both 40 or 80.  I /used/ to    
have a C64 but I grew up into the 128.  80 Column is much better.  Now
I'm looking for a couple of 81's.  I also think Courts of Chaos is a 
commodore board.  If so, you should be able to get the 40 column there
too.  BTW  Zimmcomm is a multiline system.  The numbers are 924-0499, 
921-1148, 921-1412, 921-1912.  One of those lines are for 2400-9600

I've got one of those 80 column programs for the 64.  Yes it is not very
good either.  The reason for that is because the text goes thru the 
graphics chip.  It also loads into ML.  I tried loading the 80 column
program and then loading the term program on top.  All f it would load,
but part of it was overwritten.  We all can guess what happened then....
it didnt work.  If you can get someone (like turtle) who knows more 
about ml/6502 programming,  then they may be able to alter the starting
and ending addresses so they dont overwrite each other.  In theory, it 
should work.  I have the 128 now so I dont need to fool around with that
anymore.  If you get one working, lemme know, I'd be interested in
running it up to see how it works.

TS>Hmmm?   Come again?
    
   It's a long story. To shorten it up, Turtle, Rufus, and I met some
California furries, and one of them was discussing a new modem he was
the head designer for. Anyway, we were joking that the thing had 
enough extra memory and CPU power on it that we could bypass having
a computer -- just run your BBS off the modem itself.

   I used to do 6502 programming on an Atari 800... don't know how
much good that will do you.  If you have a technical reference manual
lying around (that is, how the computer physically writes to disks
the machine language programs...), I'd be willing to give it a shot.
   (Sure! I LOVE relocating code in memory. I'm lying through my

All that is not needed.  All you have to do is find the starting and
ending address for the term prg and the 80 column prg.  After locating 
them, alter them so they dont overwrite each other and then re save them
just like any other file.  I dont have the utility to list a ml prg. so
the address can be found.  I dont think you need to find out HOW the 
computer writes to disk a ml prg and all that stuff.

  I'm on courts, and it runs on an Amiga (I guess you could call that a 
Commodore board), and it does conform to your terminal, which isn't a
feature of a lot of IBM BBSes. You have to look at a word wrapped screen
with half on one side and half at the end of the last line.
 
  BTW, Zimmcomm is private, or something like that. I tried logging on, 
but it told me a user had to "sponsor" me. I don't need it anyway, I 
only wanted to read an echo which I get off Jos' Lounge.

Changing the address a program loads to also involves changing a
whole lot of stuff in the program itself: jump addresses, data
storage addresses, etc. Moving a machine-language program generally
involves doing a /lot/ of work with a debugger, and a lot of time.

...and the program you move stops working. If you move the program by,
say, 200 bytes, then suddenly all the branch instructions will be off
by 100 bytes, any internal data buffers will not be where the program
expects them to be, data storage areas will be in the wrong place, etc.
A machine language program jumps to memory addresses, not to labels or
line numbers or whatever. So if the program jumps to a subroutine at
address 7FB0, say, when you move the program it will still jump to
address 7FB0--and Heaven only knows what will actually /be/ there
when it arrives.

No direct attacks on other users. (Note, however, that to attack a
user's IDEAS is not the same thing as to attack another USER, and is
certainly permitted and in some cases encouraged.) Do not take offense
at another user's posts when it is not clear that the offense was
intended. Other than that, this system is fairly relaxed and informal;
there are no specific rules concerning language (except that you keep
it rational; nobody likes to read messages with a print density of
four profanities per inch), or topics for discussion, or any of that
sort of bureaucratic doo-doo (to borrow an expression from our
illustrious leader). Welcome aboard!

An easier way to get an 80 col terminal would be to find a small term
that is written in basic, and just put the terminal as a gosub in the

If you have a machine language program without source code, relocating
it on ANY system is fairly difficult.
   As for Z-System, it depends on	 what source you have the file as.
If it's a Microsoft .REL file (the standard relocating assembler output,
also found for regular CP/M, TRSDOS and MS-DOS), relocating it is
pretty easy.
   Of course, you can always write a routine to be relocatable, but the
bigger the routine is, the more difficult it is....

Modern Politics, lesson one: you can support the soldiers without
supporting the government's reason for sending them into battle. 
 
Question	 for you, Specialist: why is America over there?  "No Blood for
Oil" is right, since we only get 5% of our oil from Iraq and Kuwait
combined.  We must be fighting for something else.  To get Hussein out
of power?  Unlikely -- he's been there for quite some time, you know,
and we were tacitly supporting him when Iran was the great enemy.  To
"liberate Kuwait"?  Why bother?  Kuwait was created by a bureaucrat in
Britain, who arbitrarily broke it off of Iran after World War II; they
have a monarchy which has a record on	 human rights only slightly better
than Iraq's (and a less modern outlook on life than Hussein's); and to
top it all off, they weren't American allies to begin with.
 
If the premise that we must liberate Kuwait is correct, then attacking
now isn't a bad thing.  Hussein's response to sanctions has been to dig
in deeper; his response to all diplomatic entreaties was to tour his
troops and shout jingoistic slogans at American reporters.
 
The question, therefore, is whether that premise is valid.  Those who
disagree with the President are not "pinkos," Dave, and if you honestly
believe that questioning authority is anti-American, you're even more
stuck in the '60s than the most recalcitrant bare-footed, tie-dyed
hippie singing "Give Peace a Chance" in front of the White House.

Dear Burney,
   Ha! Changing the addresses of a machine language program is a lot
more complex than just changing the starting and stopping addresses.
That would be something like changing the line numbers of a BASIC
program without changing the line numbers the GOTO and GOSUBs talk
about... but much, much worse.

Actually, one of the best things to do if you ARE drafted, want to

with the U.S. government...
    
   If and when a draft shows up, and if your name comes up, and you
don't have a good excuse not to sign up, sign up with LOTS and LOTS
of draft boards. As many as you possibly can. It might be illegal to
not show up if you're drafted, but they can't stop an over-ambitious

 First of all, I've found that while ABC's coverage has been reasonably 
comprehensive (they were the first to report it also), the whole thing 
has been REALLY hectic and Peter Jennings is NOT handling it well.
 
 Second of all, I talked to someone about what was going on in Iraq. 
Someone else asked why not drop nuclear bombs. If the fallout were to 
drift in any direction, it's going to infuriate some country or it's 
going to kill our troops. BTW, did you actually mean "Nuke Iran." or did

All I am saying is we have given Iraq enough time to cooperate with the

First lesson:  Loose your patronizing attitude, and you might find me
much more receptive to your reasoning.
 
Why are we in Kuwait?  Couple of reasons.  First, naked aggression, left
unchecked, could be disastrous later down the road.  Second, I don't 
know if you are aware of it, but this is a free country...naturally, we
hate to see other countries get subjected to dictatorship.  (That is,
at least, *I* do.  I don't know if *you* give a damn.)   This Hussein,
he is dangerous. 
  Actually, I am not so concerned about Kuwait and it's lot as much as
I am about Hussein.  This is not to say that I don't care about Kuwait,
I *do*.  But I am more concerned about Hussein.  Kuwait, while not 
extremely humanitarian in it's own right, doesn't use chemical weapons
indiscriminately, and doesn
indiscriminately, and doesn't go around invading other countries. 
  Besides, the man is incredibly arrogant.  (That's my personal opinion,
and yes, it's another of *my* reasons why he should be neutralized.)
  And of course, there is the humanitarian issue.  Brutal, yes.  The
man is simply a cold bastard.  He is a king of propoganda, and runs a
puppet parliment.  He is is own administration.  He takes over Kuwait,
simply for the sake of doing so, and then claims that it belonged to him
to begin with!  Bull!  That'd be like England reclaiming all the states
on the east coast, and saying that they belonged to them.  Bull. 
 Pinkos.  The term is "Ad Hominem".  Actually, I used the term because 
I wanted to insult the people who were there, and that seemed the mose
(SP most) fitting I could find.   Those people didn't support the 
government.  Why not?

Yeah, good idea. Maybe we should take out Iraq while we're at it.
Seriously, though, I'm not entirely convinced that that's such a
good idea...not only would it get everyone in the region really pissed
off at us, it'd also make us the A-1 target of every would-be terrorist
and crazy Iraqi with a bomb and a desire to die for Allah, and it
doesn't take too many maniacs with bombs in their backpacks to take
down Wall Street or blow people up in Times Square...

Meow! There is a big difference between being willing to fight for
your country and being willing to fight for the Emir of Kuwait's
country. Kuwait can go to Hell; I don't see the need to play bad cop
to Bush's good cop and blow up every two-bit foreign dictator with an
attitude. Get serious. If Saddam is truly the worst monster to come down
the pike since Ho Chi Mihn, I guess our illustrious government (you
know, the government that all patriotic Americans KNOW can do no wrong
and should ALWAYS be supported in EVERYTHING it does) shouldn't have
created him in the first place, hmm? I'm not gonna put my life on the
line for some Emir, and I'm not gonna put my life on the line because
our government found it convenient to support some goddamn maniac
like Hussein and is finding him inconvenient now.

*snort* Yeah, yeah, right. Sure we do. Countries like Chile, say,
or Uganda, or Iran (before it went hyper-conservative), where we
work diligently to bring prosperity and freedom by supporting
bloodthirsty dictators who get off on torturing and murdering their
citizens. Uh-huh. I don't buy it. It is, like you say, a free country,
though, which means that its citizens are free to demonstrate against
war on street corners without being Communists (the technical term for
"pinkos"). (Actually, since Communism seems to be falling apart all
over the world, it7s kind of difficult to call anyone a "pinko" these
days; the number of Communists left in the world can be counted on the
fingers of one thumb. Shouldn't you be trying to come up with a better
epithet?)

T>Kuwait can go to Hell
   
Harsh words.  Seriously, Hussein had no right to march into Kuwait and 
declare it his. Period. I'm not so patriotic that I would intentionally
blind myself to what the government is doing, right or wrong. We the 
people voted Bush and Congress into their respectively positions but 
that doesn't make them immune to error and bad judgment. But you will 
find a 3X5 American Flag hanging on the livingroom wall of The 
Specialist's and my apartment. And I will personally throw out anyone 
who would like to burn it.  
  Look, I don't like war, no one does.  But the citizens of Kuwait have
just as much right to their country as anyone else would. If, by some 
remote chance, someone /was/ able to take over the U.S.A. as easily as 
Hussien took over Kuwait I'd hope like hell that another country would
get involved and help /us/.  Something has to be done to restore Kuwait.
Just because their country is small doesn't make it insignificant.(sp)
They're human beings.  And when one insane son-of-a-bitch decided he
wants to rule over more people and stole their capital reserves he 
has to be stopped.  It was his choice to ignore the United Nations 
(SPELLED out for the emphasis) sanctions.  He basically f*cked 
himself. He knew the terms. He knew what would happen if he ignored 
the sanctions.  No more time should be given, if he was going to pull 
out willingly, he should have pulled out the FIRST day the sanctions
were put into effect. END OF STORY!

Awesome, dude.  How old are you? I'm twenty-three. I've been a Trekkie 
since I was about eight years old.  
I wish you had been around for the war between Star Trek and ST:TNG
I got beaten by overwhelming odds.  It took place on this board about
4 months ago.  
There's nothing I like more than Star Trek Trivia. BTW, yes I remember 
the episode very well.  It was so awesome been Kirk told Nomad in 
engineering that It had made a mistake and thereby tricked into 
destroying itself. 
My favorite episode is the one with the Romulans.  The battle of wits
was awesome.  Playing dead in space and all that. Remember when the 
Romulan commander, at the end, told Kirk. "In another time, I could have
called you friend."? Then the poor bastard self-destructed.
  
Know any good trivia?
Here's a few for you. All from the episode where Spock got the Vulcan 
fever. 
1.)What was the name of wife-to-be?
2.)Waht was the name of the woman in charge of the ceremony?
3.)What was the name of the Challenge?
4.)What was the name of the Vulcan that his wife-to-be wanted to marry?
Just a note, spelling doesn't count. 
Good luck.

BZZZT!  Wrong, Turtle.  The average 'Stang has a 5.0 liter, which

Combined with a rear end diff of about 4:10, and a very lightwieght

  Now, I figure with an engine that's rated for about 335 hp and is
440 ci with a 3:54 (Sure grip) diff, I should be able to do much 
better.  Unfortunately, with extra volume comes extra weight, and
my car is about 300-400 lbs heavier than a 'Stang, so it'll require

countries, not all against one.  I don't believe that it's going to be
like in the movies, "World War III" nukes and all that other bulls*it.

So, you're saying my premise of "we hate to see dictators" is Bull?
So, ok, lets leave Hussein in Kuwait...and then, let him take over the 
middle east.  Oh, yeah, that's better.  I maintain that getting rid of
Hussein could only be an improvement.  Gotta go with the least of all
Evils.  And the Emir in this case, *IS* the least of the evils. 
Obviously, Hussein is the worst.

  Yes, possibly, BUT, will this really go down in the record books as e
the third world war?

>I'm not as much concerned about Kuwait...as I am about Hussein.
 
 Then you're supporting the wrong war, dude.
 
  It's been asked MANY times over the last couple days wether they'v
been targeting Hussein himself, or if they know where he is. The repl
is ALWAYS that this action is to get Iraq out of Kuwait and NOT to
target any individuals.

I know Rufus, and I don't think it is a matter of being chicken...
War is very serious.  I find it to be difficult to fight in a war 
which one might not totally believe in...but I do know that calling
Rufus a draft0dodger and a chicken are a bit childish...if he's such
a draft-dodger, then what are you, my friend?  Why aren't you in the 
Gulf fighting?  Are you AFRAID?

>The citizens of Kuwait have just as much right to thier country
>as anyone else would.
 
I agree wholeheartedly, absolutely, 100%. The citizens of Kuwait
have the right to be a self-determining body. So do the
Palestinians. So does the South African majority. So do the
Lebanese. Your point, please?
 
While you can argue that what Hussein did was wrong, illegal, etc,
etc, you can ALSO argue that the United States has no business being
the world's morality police. If we MUST insist on doing this sort of
thing, though, is it too much to ask that it be done consistently?
We as a country are all for democracy and freedom, WHEREVER IT'S
CONVENIENT. If an ALLY of ours moves into another country, takes it
over, and starts killing the citizens, we don't give two shits.
If an ENEMY starts doing the same thing, it's "Oh my goodness, we
have to stop this evil man. Oh, look, he's taking over other people's
countries! Naughty, naughty. Let's go teach him a lesson." Get real.
