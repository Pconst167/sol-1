 On the subject of the metal music that advocates satansism, etc.:
  I think that it may be a very valid type of music, considering the 
fact that besides the lyrics, there is music. I know sometimes this 
isn'ttrue, and I know sometimes the lyrics are really important. BUT, 
why don't people sometimes just listen to the MUSIC, and not the words..

  Well, I am all for belief in anything, but I don't like those who f
force it upon others and such... I know that, in laws, we are forced to 
take one over the other, but religion is free, and we have the right to 
choose which religion, or none, that we wan
  What I mean to say is that beief in something is important, but a 
person shouldn't let a belief rule every aspect of their life.
 
  One thing I have noticed about religios people: Those of us who don't
really go for religion, or those of uwho question it, seem to be more
open minded and intelligent than those who make a deal out of telling us
to believe...

We've had to do some storyline editing, usually after Spellwind posted.
Sigh.  Anyway, any "quests" develop strictly on the volition of the
characters involved.  There are things that are going to happen with my
/own/ characters; a story that's starting to be serialized in a fanzine
called YARF! takes place in another part of Ranea over a timespan of
two months or so before when the storyboard is set at, and the end of
that story overlaps the storyboard in both time and location.  However,
I'm not planning to do anything with the characters I'm running now in
relation to anyone else's characters as of yet... if that happens, it'll
just develop, much like it'd probably happen in a real-life (albeit
fantasy world) situation).

Actually, I've been writing about that with regards to a current song
by Heart.  I find demeaning songs as least as offensive, if not more so,
than violent songs.  "Hot Blooded" I find difficult to take seriously;
as for Def Leppard, well, you could get offended at "Pour Some Sugar
on Me" but it probably wouldn't be worth the energy.  Considering those
two are generally the worst nowadays (barring wonders like "Lips and
Hips," or at least hoping they are flukes and not omens) in heavy metal/
hard rock, things are looking up.  Over the last decade or so, the
songs have gradually moved away from the size of the lead singer's dick
and towards usually coherent, and sometimes even thoughtful, songs about
not just relationships but political & social concerns.  You'll find a
lot of fluffy love/lust songs in hard rock and metal just like you will
in "pop" and rap music, but you're not likely to find Janet Jackson or
M.C. Hammer penning equivalents to Don Henley's "Heart of the Matter" or
Metallica's "One."

Again - Catholicism is a wj=hole different ballgame.  There are many
many things that hard-core Catholics believe that stirred the Protestant
movement to begin with.  Another that really stirs a lot of people is
the doctrine that infants must be baptised to atone for "original sin"
otherwise they teach * That infant will go to hell !!!!!!  Now this
is kinda personal for me 'cause a well-meaning (but still a stupid
insensitive clod) priest told my mother this shit after my infant
brother died of a heart defect 2 weeks after he was born.  She knows
that this is not true but still it upset her very much.
    You have to also understand that the Catholic religion, because of
it's glaring n0n-adherance to the Bible, has practised a policy of
repression throughout the centuries.  It used to be punishable by DEATH

have contributed to the rise of divorce as people are filled with
pure romanticised trash about "luv".  John Cougar Mellencamp has always
been a favorite for meaningful songs as also Simon & Garfunkel.  Tracy
Chapman is vastly overrated (but I DO like her tunes) as far as social
awareness.  Actually I consider Henley's "Heart of the Matter" to be
a giant cliche' from one end to the other.  I listened to it several
times to make sure it wasn't a joke!  As far as songs like Metallica's
"One" and stuff like White Lions's (umm what was that tune about the
children?) anyway I look at is as a passing fad.  Metal has been under
so much criticism for lack of finesse' (they call it Thrash y'understand
that now we see many groups throwing in a token acoustic piece just to
prove they can.  How silly.... "look ma - no pickups!".  Metal music
has a place in the world and sex will continue to be a driving force

That's a very black-and-white approach to "the way heavy metal works."
Metallica has never, to the best of my knowledge, recorded any song that
could be considered a love/lust song.  Social consciousness is not a
passing fad in music, even popular music; when you look at the the most
popular artists of the '80s, most of them at least had some socially
aware songs, even, yes, Michael Jackson -- and some of the biggest acts
were U2 and Bruce Springsteen, hardly icons of the "Boom I've Got Your
Girlfriend" audience.  Hard rock/metal is not all lyrically vapid, and
for the most part, it's more intelligent than pop counterparts.  Hell,
even the ones that ARE love songs, like Kiss's "Forever," are often
more interesting than top pop bop schlop.

Different part of the Bible have continually been used throughout the
ages to support two different sides of arguments with no middle ground,
such as abortion or creationism-vs.-evolution.
    And furthermore, very few people on here have actually been quoting
the Bible per se; we have been talking about the overall way it has been
used throughout history.  If the way Christians interpret the Bible
differs from group to group, it is neither the non-Christians' fault nor
the Bible's (or its writers').  If a group says they believe one way but
consistently live as if they do not, what is an impartial observer to
decide they /truly/ believe -- what they profess, or what they actually
do?

A lot of Catholics do read the Bible.  A lot of non-Catholics are also
blindly led by sheep, either in other Christian denominations, other
religions or political movements.
    I've noticed Catholic-bashing is quite fashionable among Christians
who don't follow that denomination, and there are certainly things in
the Catholic belief system that other Christians could find
questionable.  There is also a tendency to blow the perceived negatives
of Catholicism far out of proportion, and further, to respond to most
challenges against Christianity's past actions by saying, "Yes, but
that was the Catholics."
    Look around Christianity.  All denominations have their good points
and bad points.  Many of the negatives I perceive in Christian actions
originate in Southern Baptist churches just as often, if not more so,
than Catholic ones.  The argument, "Well, at least we didn't start the
Inquisition" isn't a terribly good one for convincing an atheist to
become a Protestant.  He'll probably wonder why these groups that all
claim to follow the same God and to know the One Truth <tm> spend as
much time bashing each other as they do bashing non-Christians and 
telling their followers what in secular society is Good and Evil,
and how anyone coming strictly from outside the Christian tradition can
truly believe that /any/ of them are following a "God of Love."

Not always. Every person carries with him his own set of beliefs that
define what is or is not immoral (even people who claim not to). That
doesn't mean that there is any code of morality that is universal or
applies equally to everyone, though; it only becomes a problem when
someone says "What you are doing [what you are listening, what you are
watching, what you are saying, etc, etc, etc] is immoral, and if you
don't stop I will force you to [torture you, kill you, etc, etc]."
The only moral value that seems to be universal is that it is not
immoral to murder people who disagree with your morality.

I think the Southern Baptists will be dealing with the fallout from
the Scopes Monkey Trial for more than 700 years, frankly; as a rule,
Catholicism is about 700 years behind reality, and Fundamentalists
are about 200 years behind Catholics. (Look at the number of Fundament-
alists who /still/ try to force school districts to preach--er, teach--
the absurdity of "creation science"!) I never fail to be astounded how
quickly people will disbelieve any evidence that disagrees with their
own little worldview, even if the evidence is right before their eyes.
Aristotle taught that a heavy object will fall faster than a light
object, a belief which persisted for thousands of years despite tens of
thousands of demonstrations that it isn't true.
 
Of course, Aristotle also taught that the brain exists merely to cool
the blood and is not involved in the process of thinking--something
which is only true of some people.

[Actually, this is to the Specialist's unnamed friend]
 
If one defines "success" as "peace, love, and joy"; and one defines
the "Kingdom of God" as "peace, love, and joy," it still doesn't
follow that all success comes from the kingdom of God. A correlary
to that belief would be that people who don't believe in the
Christian god, or in any sort of god at all, would not be capable
of finding peace, love, and joy; this is demonstrably not true. The
only two people I have ever met in my life who I can honestly say are
truly, deeply happy are not Christians; I have, however, met a large
number of faithful, loyal, devout, and miserable Christians. Faith in
God is neither necessary to nor sufficient for peace, love, and joy.
 
Saying that all good works come from God would likewise seem to say that
someone who does not believe in God cannot either be a good person or
perform good works, which is also not true. Just as there are Christians
who are selfish, mean-spirited, vicious, and inconsiderate, there are
atheists and non-Christian theists who are kind, compassionate, caring,
and loving people. Would your friend consider that a contradiction?

I see a visit to Sarasota Electronics in my future...figure this Qubie's
giving me enough weird problems to qualify for a Government grant. It
doesn't seem to get into the spirit of 1200 baud with the proper
enthusiasm, for some reason; it won't talk to a few 1200 bauds, but it
also doesn't seem to have any way to tune the carrier. Oh, well...maybe
it's a technical problem, maybe it's just surrendered to the dark side

I have a TI-99/4A keyboard...it's really a nice keyboard (good feel,
good layout, CONTROL and FUNCTION keys, which is almost as strange as
CONTROL and ALT on the same keyboard), but it isn't anywhere close to
ASCII. It uses some really bizzare matrix encoding that passes the
row and a multiplexed BCD of the column out to the edge of the
keyboard (yep, it's got a decimal-to-BCD encoder IC on the board!)
Pity; I'd like to use it in something.

Sometimes you have to be kinda careful with 'em, though. A couple
programs seem to have trouble going from .MAC to .GIF; they
convert it to /something/, all right, but they seem to mess up the
header information so's you can't tell how many lines the resulting
.GIF is. It doesn't matter to a lot of IBM ShowGIF programs 'cause they
get that information from the file itself, but GIF viewers for other
machines can't deal with a GIF whose header is messed up very well.
You end up seeing things like "WINNOW.GIF: File resolution 4096x200,
2 colors."

Not really. It still makes a statement about non-Christians; it implies
that they are /not/ forgiven. If you don't buy into Christianity, you
probably don't believe it, of course, but it's still kind of obnoxious
to be told "we're both imperfect, but at least I'm forgiven and
you're not, so there." A bumper sticker that says "Soccer players
have leather balls" makes no statement, expressed or implied, about
people who don't play soccer.

The Bible does not talk about Hell, particularly as a place where the
condemned go. The closest it gets is saying that the unrighteous
will be cast into a lake of fire after the battle at Armageddon. In
fact, most Fundamentalist sects don't believe in Hell at all; they will
tell you the wages of sin is DEATH, not eternal torment. (The concept of
hell has always given me problems with popular Christianity; I for one
WILL NOT worship a diety who sees the necessity of keeping a private

That doesn't help much, because what if the religion you choose has as
a central tenant that people who subscribe to other faiths should be
killed, or people who subscribe to other faiths will certainly die
unless you use anmy means at your disposal to convert them? Then a
cornerstone of your faith becomes the belief that others do /not/ have
the right to choose their own religion; so do you have the right to

That's a REALLY annoying statement...and belief. Metallica, to take the
example you dismissed so lightly, has ALWAYS played acoustic music,
and in fact every member of that particular group has a degree in formal
music theory. "Thrash" metal is a sub-set of heavy-metal music in
general, and it's rather unfair to make sweeping statements like the
one you just made and to judge all of metal by the thrash you hear
pouring out of oversized stereos belonging to young children. You also
didn't address the central point, which is that there is a good deal
of meaningful, interesting, and impressive music being generated by
heavy-metal groups--and not just as a "passing fad" (Dio has performed
heavy metal with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra--when he was with Rainbow
in 1976. Yngwie Malmsteen writes long, elaborate instrumental pieces,
inspired by some of the classical masters he's dedicate a great deal
of time to studying, and it's 1990. Fourteen years is a hell of a long
passing fad.) Yes, the percentage of good heavy metal is very small; the
percentage of good music of ANY kind is very small. The fact that
90% of it is crap doesn't make the 10% that's good any less good.

The Qubie combined with the blasted Migent modem Raven has let me borrow
is a match made in Hell.  I dial up your number and 75% of the time, the
modem just sits there listening to the carrier, and I have to try to
jump back to terminal mode and start slamming RETURN... half of the
time, the modem transmits it anyway (even though it hasn't transmitted a
CONNECT 1200) and PBBS starts, apparently over the modems' objections.
 
Anyway, IMP itself is pretty nice.  Very CP/M (it's a command-driven
terminal program like MODEM7 is), but powerful; it lacks DTERM's or
FastTerm's script capability, but does just about everything else, well,
more elegantly than the other two combined.  It's also the only term
program I've seen that pays attention to 2400 bps modems' return codes;
you can leave it set at 2400 bps, and if you call a 1200 bps board the
terminal will drop down to match it.
 
Incidentally, whoever wrote the Superbrain overlay remapped the command
key from ESCape to the SB's "HERE IS" button.  It's nice to give the
thing a use in life, but I wish he had let me know ahead of time.
 
Another thing interesting.. IMP implements transfers the way JMODEM
thinks it does.  If you start out with 1024-byte blocks, it will keep
track of the # of bad blocks; 4 consecutively, or a ratio of bad to
good over a certain number (which is different for each baud rate),
will make it drop down to 128-byte blocks.

Well, Vafthrudner was a Nordic frost giant that asked everyone who
tried to cross his land a question - if they got it right they passed,
if wrong they died by the club. The only exception was Odin, who got
the question wrong, but wasn't so easy to kill. So i used Vafthrudner

Read it again - I was referring to the acoustic number. To clarify -
a lot of groups feel like the soulfull acoustic number is a gotta have
on their albumn - like the wailing lead solos that you hear in "normal"
rock-n-roll. Personally I thing that many of the solos should be left
out as they are not there as a support for the tune but rather a 
showcase for the guitar hero to show us how fast he can burn off a 
scale (* yawn *).  The "socially meaningful" acoustic number is 
approaching this point also.  Face it - most rock-n-roll bands 
are groupies themselves - look how many wanna-bes Van Halen and
Led Zepplin spawned.  This is why I call it a fad.  There are
genuine tunes out there (U2) that are really the product of a 
social consiousness but most are simply a train of brown-nosers.

That's mainifest bullshit!  Everyone in the world would be a pitiful
hypocrite if that is truly the way the cards fall.  #1 what is the
definition of "living a belief"?  Should you dedicate your life &
funds in the quest for a free south Africa since you made a stand on
your board that the adjective "sand-nigger" offended you more than
anything else?  Would you be living a lie since you would not be willing
to go that far?
Truth is we are quite capable of perceiving high moral standards but 
still acknowledging that we can fall short of the IDEALS.  Let's not
get black and white here but rather leave room for being human.

Typically I find that "outsiders" do a far better of job of laying
the "infighting" rap on Christian denominations.  Truth is they 
agree on the most of the high points and it is trivial stuff that
actually comprise the various schisms that you percieve as Christianity.
By definitian a Christian is one who believes in Jesus the Christ as 
the risen Son of God who died for mankinds cumulative sins.  No more
no less.  When you get into the "mechanics" of actually being a 
Christian then you have various beliefs as people try to make sense of
the various writings.  The Church has always been defined as the
corporate body of belivers and has not a thing to do with a building or
any group in particular.  The groups that Christians traditionally
do battle with are a) non-believers that feel theirs is the One True
Way (tm) and Shame on Christians for being such back-water louts that
they actually think that they are entitled to their beliefs when Right
Thinkers can see the world evolved as a cosmic crap game and B) those
people that feel they have a strangle hold on the kingdom of heaven and
they hold the only key (fringe groups like the ones that dug in in
Arizona).  Most Christian groups have many dealings with one another 
at both the community and national levels and have multi-denominational
meetings.

Ok - enuf of THAT stuff too.  Has it ever occurred to anyone that there
are TWO explanations for this behavior - neither of which involves
a stupid and misrepresented belief that God is the source of all good?
1) Psychologists have a saying that there is NO such thing as altruism
and that all "good" or selfless acts can be attributed to a desire
to forward the interests of the "altrusistic" person.  Could it be that 
the persons are simply participating in a "Holier than thou" contest
whereby the "winner" is the most percieved holyman?  Hmmmm?
2) Since the "Born Again" Christian is a "new creature" shaped by the
Holy Spirit - can he not in all honesty within the framewortk of his
beliefs say that because of hios relationship with God and because
of God's influence in his life that the good works are possible and 
thus give credit where he honestly believes it is due?
Let's see a little less mindless slamminmg and a little more thought...

I was referring to the "emotional content" of the folks that would
be morally offended by the sexual innuendo.  IE a giant stereotype
of the "typical" Christian family out for a Sunday drive.
Speaking of perceptions - then what about bumper stickers that proclaim:
"Of I drive like I own the road - I do!"
"If you don't like the way I drive call this number 1-800-EAT-SHIT
etc etc?  Isn't that a rather rude and self centered group of 
statements that imply you have NO rights as far as they are concerned
and your comfort and safety on the roads is of secondary importance to
their supreme indifference?  
Of course I don't let them bother me! And letting a Christian bumper
sticker bother you is an indication that you are somehow (to use
shrink jargon) sensitized to these type of messages - kinda like the
mythical red flag.  This would put the "problem" in your backyard.

>Moral or immoral is determined by society's opinion.
 
No, I'm sorry, that simply doesn't work as a definition of "moral."
Social opinion will determine what is socially acceptable, not what
is "moral;" it would be difficult to support the premiss that
the white minority regime in South Africa or the extermination of Jews
in the Third Reich is "moral," regardless of the fact that public
opinion supported both activities. You also seem to be pretty convinced
that homosexuality (and anyone who's sick enough to believe that people'
private sexual practices are their own business, presumably including
myself) is immoral; if you were to find suddenly that a majority of
the public disagreed with you, would it suddenly become moral? By saying
that the sole determining factor in morality is public acceptance, that'
exactly what you would have to say.
 
Incidentally, why /do/ you feel homosexuality is immoral, anyway?

I dunno...I have a large quantity of propaganda from a large number of
Christian sects (from the Assemblies of God to the Southern Baptists,
neither of which is terribly "cultish") that claim Roman Catholicism is
anything from an innocent pawn of the Devil's to the embodiment of
Satan's church on Earth. These people are Christian, yes, but the bit
about "Christian brotherhood" seems to have eluded them. In general, it
seems as though fairly trivial differences in belief will cause more
problems between groups than will profound differences; you don't see
Muslims and Shintoists going at one another with the same enthusiasm
as Shi'ites and Sunnis, and conservative Fundamentalists seem to hate
Catholics with a ferver that surpasses their hatred of, say, Buddhists.
That sort of behavior isn't conducive to convincing an objective ob-
server that Christianity is The Truth; and it does kind of make one
wonder why if this is in fact the living church of an omnipotent god
it doesn't hang together any better than all the other religions
wandering around together. It is the religion of the one true living
god, and that one true living god can't even keep his own house in
order, neh? Not an impressive edifice.

Tsk, tsk, tsk. I'm sorry, but there are in fact people who believe,
quite literally, that no man acting on his own can ever do anything
good, period; /all/ goodness comes from god. It is one thing to
attribute your own actions to the Holy Spirit working through you; it's
quite another to gaze heavenward and say "Thank you, Lord" when someone
yanks you from the path of a speeding car, and then arrogantly tell the
person who's just saved your ass "What do you mean, thank /you?/ That
wasn't your action, it was God working through you!" (NB: This is an
actual case history, not a hypothetical example.) The "god is
responsible for all good" mentality diminishes everyone to the level
of a helpless automaton that can't do anything right, ever, without
the direct and immediate control of god. That's an annoyingly
arrogant attitude that quite simply sets my teeth on edge.

the test. I did, in fact, delete six messages he posted; each was an
exact duplicate of the preceeding post.
 
I have no idea who George Williams is or why he chose to vomit all over
the message base. I have attempted unsuccessfully to reach him at the
number he listed in the userlog to find out what his problem is. At any
rate, the man has shaken my faith in the BBS users' community; I have
acted as a sysop for two different boards, and in the two or three
years I've been operating a computer BBS this is the first time anyone
has abused my policy of totally open access, but it's still rather
distressing.
 
I apologise for Mr. Williams' unacceptable behavior and sincerely hope

would profoundly regret the necessity to institute a new-user-

I can't speak for Turtle; I happen to like Tina Turner.  My objection to
"pop" isn't with a song's popularity, or with it not being hard rock,
or what-have-you... it's when a song is musically and/or lyrically a
wasteland that I get disturbed.  I don't mind electronic music, but I do
not like tinny mechanical rhythms tracked under essentially meaningless
words... it has nothing to do with, say, what radio station is most
likely to play a song.  I still like John Denver's "Rocky Mountain
High," even though it's got nary an electronic instrument in it,
because it's musically nice (if not overwhelming) and the lyrics show a
fair amount of thought, not just  "what rhymes with X" construction.
(This song gets dumped on by a whole lot of people who seem to be
trying to stick it in the same class as, say, Chris Cross's "Sailing,"
but I bet almost none of them could say exactly what's going on in
"Rocky Mountain High"....)

least one of them miserable -- two, if her husband finds out.  It WAS
a one-night stand, and the song is painting it in pretty, "isn't this
an absolutely wonderful night we've had" pictures without even touching
subjects like, well, how she's using this guy, how she really doesn't
care for him except as a lust object, what his feelings might be when
she leaves before he wakes up, or anything about her husband at all.

What is the similarity?  In one case you are describing two people of
the same sex attracted to one another -- which, despite the stereotype
you seem to be operating from, does NOT mean they have to be promiscuous
or exist in a non-monogamous relationship; in another you are describing
one partner cheating on the other one, i.e., having sex with someone
else without her ostensible "lover" at least knowing about it.  I am
full aware of your prejudices against sexual activity that doesn't fit
your definition of what is "moral" and "immoral," but that is not the
issue at hand.  A relationship built on trust is the same regardless of
who is involved; one built on lies is the same regardless of who is
involved.  The lying is what I am objecting to, not the sexual activity
in and of itself, whether you are talking about homosexuality, group
sex, or what-have-you... I am of the belief that if everyone involved
is a consenting adult, it's their business, even if it's business I
don't like and would never be involved in myself.
    But I believe we've already went through this.  I believe that a
person's sexual life, as long as it doesn't demonstrably harm others,
is their business (in fact, that can be said of their entire life in
general); you believe that if a person's life doesn't fit your idea of
moral purity, it makes that person worthless scum, correct?

Hey, I've seen George Michael's girlfriend (the one in the video for
"I Want Your Sex," in fact).  Personally, I think Georgie left Andrew
Ridgely because Ridgely has no discernible talent whatsoever, but even

I am not talking about becoming a monk, I am talking about acting in
ways which are directly contrary to your stated belief systems.  That
crosses the bounds of "leaving room for being human" and moves over into
blatant hypocrisy.  And I stand by my "manifest bullshit": Christianity
has a long history of saying one thing and doing quite another.  The
Crusades, the Inquisitions, and the centuries of witch-hunts in Europe
were not too bloody "Christian" in my book.  Going up to a village of
pagans and saying "We worship the God of Love.  You do it, too, or we'll
kill you" would sure qualify as a direct contradiction to someone who
wasn't actively trying to defend the Christian tradition.
 
   "If ever the book which I am not going to be write is to be written,
    it will be a full apology for the acts of Christiandom.  We have
    shouted the name of Christ and enacted the service of Moloch."

I know what the definition of Christian is.  I also know some
Episcopalians who have been told, point blank, by Baptist ministers that
they are going to Hell because they do not believe the Bible is the
literal Word of God.  Personally, the last church service I voluntarily
attended was a funeral for a friend of mine.  Upon entering her Catholic
church, we were all handed programs bearing a note that non-Catholics
were requested not to partake of communion until "doctrinal differences"
between Catholicism and Protestant denominations were resolved.
    This sort of horseshit may be more damaging to organized Christian
religion rather than Christianity itself, but I have been lectured by
several people from varying denominations on the importance of not being
a loner, i.e., if you're not a member of a church group you're missing
a whole lot of Neat Stuff (or you're not really a Christian, depending
on which denomination you ask).
   At any rate, this nonsense is part-and-parcel of Christianity, for
practical purposes.  You can argue all you want about it not touching
the deep meaning, and you can be perfectly correct... but organized
religion is probably one of the biggest contributing factors to atheism
and agnosticism in the modern world.

in the Up & Coming Stuff area from him; its "value" as an example of
what he did may be counterbalanced by its obnoxiousness, not to mention
the effect it might have on intelligent new users -- when I call a BBS

As the sun moves just slightly westward, but still remains blazing hot,
a grim bearded figure, dressed in a flamboyant red-and-orange shirt and
annoyingly bright peach-colored pants appears, framed in the doorway 


, a spectre of colors from the low end of the spectrum, a hideous
conformist's nightmare. On his head, a worn and floppy beige fishing
hat. In his hands--and bound on a strap round his neck--he holds a pair
of small linked drums.
 
"Ha ha!" he cries in a ringing voice. "This is the moment you have all
awaited for so many long months! I have returned!"
 
"A bold challenge, stranger," says Thrud, "such as I have rarely heard
from humankinde. But could ye not donne an overcoat, for verily ye
doth afflict my eyes with the loathesomme glare of frost blindness.
Comme then, sit beside me and tell me sommewhat of yourself. Your name,
perhaps."
 
"Are you sure you want to know?" one of the bar old-timers observes--
perhaps it was Turtle, but he's busy these days and may have hired
someone to make his wry comments for him.
 
"Aye, and surely," says Thrud. "For I am big man, and can spare a bit
of my time to learne of this most peculiar stranger."
 
"Very well," proclaims the man in orange and peach as he takes a seat
and the bar and plunks down his drums with a ringing slam. "I am

"I don't have any such ice," Wezip says matter-of-factly.
 
"That," declares Thrud, "was the coldest ice I have ever held in my
horny hand, and well would it suit the throat-splitting drink we now
watch poured for us. Nay, fox-man, pour a flagon for each here who 
will have it; I feel generous!"
 
"Anyway," says Bongo-Man, rapping on his drums for attention, "you
must all be wondering where I've been for the last year and a half."
 
"Not really," says the wisecracking bar old-timer who was suspected of
being Turtle.
 
"I traveled far in search of the man wearing the invisible earring, who
I suspected of being the assassin who assaulted that...most curious 
unicorn who was here. But when I finally tracked him down, it seemed he
was actually a trader named Cyrano Jones, who was trying to avoid Star-
fleet by hiding in another dimension. It had something to do with a 
little creature just like this one." From his pocket, Bongo-Man produces
a small, r	ound, furry creature with no head, no arms, and no legs, that
produces a soothing furry sound.
 
"Geez," says Wezip, "don't bring a tribble into the bar! It took a year
to get rid of them last time!"
 
"Excuse me?" says Bongo-Man as he casually tosses the purring tribble
into an inaccesible spot. "Did somebody say, 'blatant and annoying 
ripoff of an overdone idea?' Sorry, I wasn't listening. So anyway, I 
left Cyrano Jones alone and started to make my way back to this dimen-
sion, but along the way I ran into a fellow by the name of Werdna, and
...excuse me," he says to Angel, "but I couldn't help noticing that
you're wearing an eduzra skin?"
 
"No," says Angel.
"Oh-kay," says Bongo-Man. He grabs his flagon of Rumpleminze on the
rocks and downs it. See you guys." Banging on his drums, he withdraws
from the bar.

 What scares me is that if you tune into MTV's daily request countdown,
it turns out to be mostly metal and such. Some of it could be good. 
Groups like Poison make me wonder... some of the stuff is better. The 
sons of Ricky Nelson formed a semi-metal group that isn't that bad. But,
to see that up in the same countdown with a group who shows a fish 
gasping for oxygen bugs me...

 Discression? I don't think so. I think you mean discrimination. Think,

  Better opt for voluntary recycling. Some sicko is bound to pop up and 
say that someone telling him he HAS to separate his trash to recycle 
violates his rights...
 
  I'm for recycling though. I wish it were easier. They should have us
separate the trash into aluminum, glass, paper, etc., and then then, 
they can pick it up  for you. Of course, then you don't get paid for it,
you pay for them to pick it up.

  Now that I have a Dolby processor, I have listened to a lot of stuff, 
and in my opinion, the mixing blows George Michael away. Stuff like Paul
McCartney's "Flowers in the t" has a good front/back separation that is 
quite apparent and nice. The B-52's "Cosmic Thing" has some nice effects
but they could have used more.
  Older stuff, like the Beatles' collection, worked surround from four-
track masters, so you get some apparent surround effects, such as full 
vocal backing and a whole bass section, or an orchestra, and my favorite
-- double tracked vocals out of the rear channels...
  That's just me, however. I also found that my setup produces a more 
noticable effect. When I hear your system, everything seems a bit ddled

don't find ANYTHING perverse. Shall we consider someone perverse because
they like to watch gory movies? You might get some psychological 
evidence that watching gory movies is perverse, but I've never heard 
anyone say  that homosexuality is perverse. I think it stems from the 
fact that people are uncomfortable around them. I personally don't know

  In your first case, you are asking the difference between homo-
sexuality and not being monogomous. There, there's a heap of difference.
In your second case, there is NO difference. If a person has multiple 
lovers, it's the same thing if they are heterosexual or homosexual.
  The question about how Donthen can approve of homosexuality and dis-
approve of one-night stands frankly makes no sense to me. Evidently, you
consider both acts immoral, but he doesn't. It's all your prerogative, 
but I think you'll find that a lot of people here don't find ome-
(oops) homosexuality immoral.

My point was that the regimes of both South Africa and (particularly)
the Third Reich had popular support; does that mean that in the context
of those societies, their actions were moral? Or is morality determined
on a WORLDWIDE scale? (If that's the case, I bet you'd find that
polygamy is moral...)
 
In any event, Sir, you disappoint me. Trying to equate homosexuality
with child molestation just don't work. Or does it matter to you that
the one is an action between consenting adults and the other is an
attack on an innocent person? If the difference is irrelevant to you,
then would you say that rape and sexual intercourse are on the same
moral plane? You have placed yourself in the unenviable position of
making a comparison I think even /you/ won't attempt to defend.
 
Speaking of morality, which we are, would you consider oral-genital
intimacy an immoral act? I have here in front of me a magazine article
which states that two months ago in Lincolnton, North Carolina, a man
was sentenced to ten years in prison for engaging in oral sex with his
wife. On the same day, the same judge sentenced a man convicted of
murder to five years in prison and a convicted arsonist to eight years
in prison. I'm curious if there's actually anyone I know who would
say justice was served in that particular case, and the most likely
person I can think of is you (no offense). Incidentally, the law
calls oral sex a "detestible and abominable crime against nature and
mankind" and sets a maximum sixty-year sentence for the act.

The "we're all going to heaven and you're not" attitude is not nearly as
common in religions that aren't Judeo-Christian.  A lot of early
European religions, like Wicca, and most Eastern ones believe that all
religions are potentially paths to the truth and their chosen religion
is merely the best one (i.e., Christianity and Buddhism may both lead to
enlightenment, but it's the difference between taking an expressway and
a narrow footpath through the Andes).  Also, many of these religions
don't have concepts that are analagous to "heaven" and "hell" to begin
with.  You are not likely to find any Wiccans accosting you with the
information that if you don't join their coven, your soul is doomed

Yes, like I said, you seem to believe it makes them worthless scum.
    One of the major differences between homosexuality and other
"perversions" you list is that it is "victimless."  The people engaged
it are all doing it of their own free will, by their choice.  The same
cannot be said of rape, incest, child molestation, wife beating, or
if you take the animal's point of view into matters, bestiality.  Why
won't YOU acknowledge OUR point -- even if you don't like homosexuality,
and don't condone it or approve of it, it doesn't make the homosexual
in question into a child-molesting perverted monster?  It only makes him

music, the appeal of "Epic" (the song in question) escapes me; musically
it's not all that impressive, and even if it's a spoof of rap, it's done
in a way that sets me on edge as much as the current masterpieces by
Public Enemy and Ice-T do.  Luckily, it is not representative of the

take up space in our land fills.

Five computers, if you count the Vic.  I could let you have one if I
can find them.  They are so small, you can lose them between the pages
