   There most certainly is a need. Without a form of transportation,
people cannot get food. Starvation might be a longer form of death, but
it's death nonetheless. (Not many people live close enough to a 
supermarket that they can walk there. Bicycling in Sarasota is a joke.
And the public transportation system here isn't that great.)

Why do you believe God has any sex whatsoever?  As there's no proof
either way, it would seem to be a rather suspect statement.  If there
were a "supreme being" who created the universe, it would be a great
deal more logical to believe that s/he has aspects of both male and
female, as s/he would be both mother and father to creation.  (There is
a fairly long and interesting defense of thinking about god as a male
being I've read that argues it from a metaphysical sense, but I have
seen defenses of thinking about god as a female that are just as
well thought-out.)  Why in the world would a supreme being literally
have a sex at all?  It's not like s/he is going to have another
supreme being to have sex with, at least in a monotheistic cosmology....

Allowing elderly people (as a group) to retain their independence does
not seem too feasible when they are not, in fact, independent.  Bodies

America's Funniest Home Videos presents...WEEKEND AT CLUB FLED!
There's Noriega and Marcos, hamming for the camera...and look!
Pinochet on the rooftop, what a silly boy. And the deposed royalty of
several dozen MidEast nations...what for are they here? Because they
represent a system of government that has no place in modern times? Nah..
for the last 200 years, everyone's loved royalists, right, Mr. Washington?

Hey, take a look. Communism, pah. America, believe it or not, comes
closest to any Communist role model--at least in the early years. Think
about it--a government of The People..for The People..BY THE PEOPLE.
Anyone can become president. A leader is elected by popular mandate.
America was founded on the ideas of individual freedom and rights and
liberty--government interventionism was rebuked.

Now we have self-righteous Pharisees running about burning books and
records that are "of the devil". They do not hold up to their twisted
ideas of "Christianity". When was the last time bands of toughs roamed
streets and burned "subversive" material in the name of the Greater
Good. A hint: "Heute Detschland, am Morgens die Welt! SIEG HEIL!"

Wasn't religious and governmental persecution the original drive
behind the American rebellion? A system of kings telling Americans how to
run their lives? They wrapped that up in the church as well, to make it
seem like thay had divine backing.

The Soviet Union is closer to America's original goals than America
is. As the gov't encroaches more and more upon our lives, the
pressure to conform is obvious. America was not about conformity. It was
about breaking away, setting new rules... It used to be about individual
initiative and drive and courage, now it's "don't rock the boat, be like
the rest".

And now, the American poor is going to supply the blood for the
princes' baths. While the gov't tells us, "it's okay, it's for the
Greater Good".

Sieg Heil.

In what sense of the word? Does he have a divine penis? If so, what
does he use it for? After all, you claim to be a monotheist.
 
Debating the masculinity of god is pointless. It is quite obvious that
a divine being most likely would have no particular sex as we understand
the word. Figure sex exists in the first place as a mechanism for
promoting genetic diversity, which is presumably something god doesn't
have to worry about. Ascribing sex to god is even farther off-base than
ascribing sex to an amoeba.

stay inside the box and observe, can they?  That would be cheating; it
would also be frighteningly similar to being trapped in an old 
refrigerator.  Then one couldn't tell whether or not they would die
either unless he knew what setting it was on or whether or not it was
plugged in, but then it would not really be a random experiment, would
it?

  Well, actually, it seems to me that it would depend on how hard 
you strike it.  I have never struck one with a hammer, though, so
I wouldn't know.  I can, however, tell you that it is a myth that
they always land on thier feet.  I can also say that when spun and

that it is possible for them to land on thier heads.  In addition to
these interesting facts, cats can get dizzy.  When rolled laterally,
(such as when rolled up in a long narrow carpet and unrolled at high
speeds, or when stuck on a Lazy Susan, covered with a pot and spun
at high speeds) they have a tendency to run into walls.  (Literally:
they run away but cannot tell where they're going, thus, into walls.)

When I was working up north at one of my first jobs,I ate at The Paoli

for about $5.60 you would get 3 pancakes,3 pieces of bacon,coffee (I
got tea instead at no extra cost),and 2 eggs any way you liked them. OJ
was also included. The quality was always really good,and you got your

I really don't understand why the argument about driving competence
rages on - there's been a simple solution for years. In the army I
took a test - simulated drivers seat, red light, green light, gas
pedal, brake peddle, speedometer, steering wheel. When the light was 
green, you accelerated to a given speed. When the light turned red, you
hit the brake (tough, huh) If you didn't react in x amount of time, you
didn't get a license. If a defensible standard of reflex and reaction
times were established, I would give up my license if I could no longer
pass the test. 'Course the ACLU would see this as a facist plot......

You got an honorable discharge hanging on your wall bud? I've got one
on mine, my older brother is a 1st Sgt in the army, currently in 
Saudi Arabia, and my youngest brother is in the Navy in the Med, and
speaking for the three of us, you obviously don't know a damn thing
about being an American fighting man. One of the things that sets our
services above others (I hope) is the ability to think, reason, and see
the morality of given actions. While in a tactical situation, it's only
natural that commands must be obeyed promptly and without question.
However, it is incumbent upon good soldiers (and good Americans - 
-actually, good people) to use their own minds and hearts to determine
what is right and wrong - there are MANY provisions within the Uniform
Code of Military Justice for disobeying an unlawful order. Turtle said
that CG wrote that message prior to deploying overseas. That means he
utilized his right and responsibility to analyse his situation or 
would you rather that we had an army of automatons? I'm sure CG knows
what his dutys and obligations are, and will accomplish same while
people like you cr You've got a lot of opinions on a lot of
subjects that I don't think you think through to the end. I joke with
Turtle about liberalism vs. conservatism, but no thinking man should
allow himself to be so totaly polarized on the issues as you seem to be.
There's a lot of gray area between good and bad. However, if you would
like to join the service and be unthinking cannon fodder, go for it.

Probably not. There's nothing in the Constitution guaranteeing /anyone/

On the other hand, the AARP would have fifteen kinds of screaming fits
about it. They already oppose mandatory periodical driving tests on the
grounds that the tests are "discriminatory." Why? Because more old
people than young people fail the exam, of course, and that's dis-

>Orders are orders and they should be followed without question. Get it?
 
You seem to be deviating from the point here. Lawful orders should be
obeyed, but that doesn't mean that the person receiving the order
doesn't have the right to question them. You seem to be equating 
expression of skepticism about American policies with mutiny, and that
isn't the way it works. Last time I looked, there wasn't anything
that says a military man is required to check his brain at the door or
no longer has the right to hold and express political views of his own.
The fact that Chris doesn't agree with American polocies in the Middle
East does not mean that he does not obey orders; nor does it have any
bearing whatever on his merits as a soldier. I think the main problem
you seem to be having stems not from the fact that he isn't a good
soldier but from the fact that he holds an opinion that's different from
your own.
 
BTW, the "seig hiel" is perfectly appropriate in the context of this
discussion. Why did the atrocities of Nazi Germany take place? Because
the Nazi army was overflowing with people who were willing to blindly
follow orders without question--the course of action you seem to find
appropriate for our military, as well, I would also point out that the
orders to exterminate Jews and the like were, in Germany, perfectly
lawful. That doesn't make them /right,/ but they were perfectly lawful.
I don't need to feed you any "liberal bullshit" about what happens
when people behave like sheep--history does that for me.

Well, maybe gods do, er, ... other things.  The act of creation would be
a sex act of some sort, in some sense.  In that light, perhaps two gods
representing male & female makes a great deal more philosophical sense.

You realize that if nobody ever questioned orders from higher-ups, there
would never have been an America in the first place.  If people HAD
questioned higher-ups, there would not have been a Nazi Germany.
 
If sent over there, Chris will fight.  He just doesn't believe that our
goals in this fight are quite as noble as they're being made out.
 
As to your "fuck you" ... I have not seen your post on	 Uncle Bob's, but
I have had it described to me.  At the most, I attack your arguments.
You have called me an asshole, a pinko liberal faggot, and continually
insult my friends -- you did it through the entire "debate" (quite a
stretch of the word, considering that you repeated the same thing for
six months and refused to listen to ANYTHING that anyone said), and
now, you've just done it again.  Chris is, incidentally, one of the
most conservative people I know, he just doesn't equate it to being
brain-dead.  He also doesn't equate debate to personal attacks bordering
on slander, or just being out-and-out juvenile and nasty.  If you want
to debate on	 subjects, fine.  I respect your opinions even when I don't
agree with them (most of the time, at least), but you show absolutely
no respect for anyone else's point or view, or apparently anyone else,
period.  Quite frankly, you owe several people on	 this board -- and
now, at least one person off of it -- an apology.

  Have you seen those King Arthur commercials for marine recruitment?
 
 
     The marines: We're looking for a few good men....to destroy.
 
I spent a year in Army JROTC and even then I felt dehumanized. I'm
not a soldier to be called to battle to kill and die, I'm a thinker,
I prepare, I would NOT kill like I stated before, and I think anyone 
who believes the crap they're pumped when the US doesn't like someone 
has to be a marine...
   Take WWII, they aired alot or crap about how ruthless, destructive, 
and all around evil the Japanese were, they showed alot of footage and 
said alot, and some of it was false, to make the 'enemy' look like a
demon to be slaughtered. Now, they're showing junk about Hussein, theyX
they are doing the same thing....remember, they're of another religion
and that'll be enough to spur good little christian soldiers into battle

It seems to me that I do...(owe several people an apology).  But it 
also seems to me that blatant disrespect for the military deserves an
apology.  "Pinko-faggot"?  "Asshole"?  The terms are descriptive. 
Quite simply, if the shoe fits, wear it.
  
  As for questioning orders from superiors, fine for civilians.  It has
no place in the military. Nuernburg...not relevant.  The situation in
Nuerenburg cannot paralell current military, because current military 
are told and trained not to be "automotons" and not to accept orders
which are not lawful.  Todays military are intelligent thinkers, not
blind followers. They know the differnce between right and wrong.
 
  As for Chris Grant, my initial reaction to his imported message
was knee-jerk (which would better be described as simply jerk), I'll
admit.  And I have posted to him. (On Armadillo Connection.)  I don't
know if he'll get the message in time, but I did post.

I get very defensive, illogical, and downright rude.

T>I'll stop ranting now before I REALLY get going.  
 
I have to agree with absolutely everything that you said.  I have 
personally been the victim of two "marriages" in which the females 
involved demonstrated nearly every point that you brought up.  My first
was absolutely convinced that I was having an affair with a fellow
airman(woman) in the service and filed for divorce when I was overseas.
I discovered when I returned that she had become quite the party animal 
while I was away and had several affairs.  While I was of sufficient
committment to try further - she was not.  The second acted as though
as soon as the vows were spoken I was personal property and accorded the
same rights as the pet cat - less actually.  The one thing I asked for
my own sanity was a 30 minute wakeup with a cup of coffee and silence.
Could I have just this brief respite from the bustle of the day?  Hell
no!  She started nagging from the word go about what all *I* had to do
that day which usually involved doing 75% of her chores in addition to 
my 14 credit college schedule and working a full 12 hour day. And, yes
in theory the chores were split and I helped with groceries, laundry etc
In a nutshell, now I play by fisherman's rules.  I catch 'em and if 
they aren't worth the effort, I throw 'em back in the hope that someday
they'll grow up and be a fine catch for some lucky fisherman.

Seems that this is a very common thing.  My best friend has a "hot"
post going with a frustrated housewife in San Antonio who is originally
from here and calls for "old time sakes".  I think that we can be more
of who we would like to be over the modem because lacking eye contact,
you can be a bit more brash and daring.  Now if I could get Black

Actually that particular programming style was started by Modula 2
programmers.  Pascal was originally (stil is?) case-INsensitive.  Modula
is case sensitive and thus some way to delineate long identifiers was
needed.  It is a proven fact that long words that are all upper or lower
case cause erroneous readings with humans.  The Upper case letters break
up the monotony.  I use this style exclusively now with my C programs
instead of the infinitely ugly and error prone underscores.

Actually, several of the OT names of God contain both male and female
gender components.  I know of more than one Jew who were not knowledgabl
enough in their faith and thought these were "translation errors".
Trick is - what do we make of this (if anything).  The Mormons believe
that God has a wife and bears Him spiritual children who must be born
into a mortal body to progress.  (of course I endorse this theory with

The "face value" of attacking people rather than their arguments is to
make you look like a schmuck, no two ways about it.  I honestly think
you need to get off Turtle's case; when he disagrees with somebody, he
tells them in a direct, blunt (and often tactless) way.  That does not
make him an "asshole" or a "Pinko-faggot" and you know it.  Especially
the last one.  Believing in the first amendment rights of ALL Americans,
including the ones in the military, and occasionally being cynical
about the government and its motivations, does not make one a communist
sympathizer ("pinko") and it certainly has no bearing on one's sexual
orientation ("faggot").  If disagreeing with someone makes you an
"asshole," so be it, but it's a specious claim and one that makes the
name-caller look a lot worse than the, er, name-callee.
 
And you hit what Turtle has been trying to say when you said, "Todays
military are intelligent people, not blind followers.  They know the
difference between right and wrong."  EXACTLY.  Someone in the military
should be intelligent enough to question authority.  Not doing that
DOES lead to situations like Nazi Germany.  (I disagree with your
contention that the two are not related.  Does that make me an asshole?)

If they tried to hire ANY military person, he should have immediately
reported it to the highest-up person he could get to, either in the
military if the "employer" was civilian or in the civil government if
the "employer" was another soldier.
 
Marines are also not trained as assassins.  A battle situation is not
the same thing by any stretch of the imagination.  A Special Forces
trained soldier, possibly, but the paragraph above still applies.
 
Incidentally, if today's military people are bright enough to question
illegal orders, they should be bright enough not to quibble about which
branch of the armed services is the most gung-ho.... :>

Nixon was a genius AND a crook.  The two are not mutually exclusive.
   Also, he was really only a "genius" at international relations.  As
for Carter having a certain "knowledge" of America, so does Charles
Kuralt.  What's your point?  Kennedy was inspiring, yes, but so is
Jesse Jackson -- that doesn't qualify him as a good leader.  A lot of
analysts don't think Kennedy was any great shakes, although it looked
like he was actually getting a great deal better (which could, in some
way, be responsible for getting him killed -- a disquieting thought).

to the fact that I just got the IBM about a week ago and I'm still 
trying to find my way around MS-DOS.

You attack the idea instead of the person, eh?  So, if I refrain from
direct attacks like "asshole" or "liberal pinko faggot-lover" then I 
can use snide remarks instead with words like "wander" right?
("I do not wander around bulletin boards..." which would imply that
I'm lost and don't know what I'm doing; generally incapable of any 
intelligent actions...)
  Or I could use other indirectly belittling remarks like "you poor
unfortunate individual, if you really believe that" (which would imply
that the person in question really knows nothing, since he believes 
what is *obviously* wrong.).
  Or how about "the word you are so desperately seeking" [implied "you
illiterate moron"] "is..."  Now, there's a winner.  Well, everybody, 
make sure that you all know THIS guy doesn't even know the simplest 
of words!  Hah!  And he had the nerve to debate with me!
  No, you are right...you do refrain from direct attacks.  But your
indirect attacks are still pretty bad.
  
  If it's any comfort, I went back and deleted all the stupid posts
I put up.  (Stupid, unjustifiably rude, directed obscene attacks,
ect...).  I didn't delete the spew about "what an ingrateful snot",
(I don't remember now, I might have) but attacking the Marine Corps 
was totally uncalled for.  (Ok, so were mine...no excuse.)  And that
message was true.  I can't believe that you don't appreciate them. I 
can't believe that you put them down.  They "amuse" you?  (Shakes
head) Those same guys...defend this country.  And you don't appreciate
that.  It's just *so* *hard* to believe.

Turtle occasionally is belittling in his "blunt and tactless" way.

  You are right...that doesn't make him a pinko-faggot lover or an

Seemed like he brought in CG's commentary for the simple purpose of 
saying "See, everyone in the military doesn't think we should be there,
and I'm sure that CG's opinion is more prevalent in the military than 
yours, Specialist.  Isn't it neat how his opinion happens to be the
same as mine?"  And that opinion is *not* more common!  It can't be, 
because everyone in the military has been WAITING for a war!  They 
train and train and train just for this eventuality!
   At least most of the guys that I know want to be there...to "fight
for thier country" (if you'll pardon the time honored cliche') and WIN!
  Any way, it seemed it was what he was doing, and I took the message 
out of context, and lost it...Jerk reaction.  But, damn, that pissed me

True...but they do anyway.  The Air Force for the most part pretends 
not to care, offering thier own watered-down version of special 
services (I mean Special Services) who (ooh!) "went to Army Special
Forces school".  Woopie.  The Navy offers thier Seals, and the Army
offers Airborne Forces & Special Forces.  The Marines are one big 
bunch of Bad Asses (if you ask any Marine) because they have the 
toughest training.  
  So, (with the exception of the Air Force, like I said) each service
is convinced that it has the best soldiers....  Personally (like I've 
said) I think the Marines *are* the baddest, followed by Army Airborne
Special Forces, followed by Seals, and then...Air Force Special Forces.
  Course, if I was in combat, I'd prefer to have ANY of them protecting

A 286-based machine with VGA and a 52MB HD for $1300 is a pretty damn
good buy, even if it does run Mush. It's not exactly top on my list,
but you can certainly do worse than Tandy machines, and that price is a
real big plus. If it were me, of course, I'd likely spend the money on
some other computer (most likely an Amiga or something obscure like a
PC-Z), but you aren't going to find a machine with a decent hard
drive in that price range for that much money. If it's worth it to you
to have a lot of mass storage (and a wide base of programs), I'd say
go for it. If the hard drive and program base isn't that important,
go with an Amiga 500 (and possibly a smaller HD).

Tandy machines are easily serviced, widely supported, and 100%
IBM compatible. They're not cheap Taiwanese clones; they are, in fact,
generally considered to be about the best PC-architecture machines
on the market, at least for the home market (Tandy doesn't make
anything along the lines of the Compaq Systempro). All things considered
I'd say a Tandy machine is probably worth the money, at least as far as
any IBM compatible is...

import it to suggest that everyone (or most people (or for that matter

it because I think the message raised some pretty damn good points in an
interesting (and very literate) way, and I wanted to see if anyone had
any reaction to the /ideas/ he expressed. Of course, to date nobody's
said word one about the CONTENT of that message; sure, there's a lot of
flaming going on as to whether or not Chris has the right to express
any opinion that isn't his commanding officer's, but not word one

States to stay OUT of the Middle East.

I do not have any ideas on why the US should stay out of Saudi Arabia;
however, I do believe it is time for us to retaliate and UNDO Hussein's

rescue of hostages, but to bring into force the international community 
against a "man" who could alter the map by violent means.  The best way
to stop this bully is an international mobilization against him.

For what it is, the 2500XL is a very good computer.  $1380 is a fairly
reasonable price for a 286 (still a little high, but you do get a 1-yr
warranty and it's from a company that's everywhere instead of in one
small building in Korea), especially with the hard drive.  You wouldn't
be able to beat that price with a comparable Amiga system unless you had
another brother who worked for Commodore.
   So what you need to do is ask yourself, is running Amiga stuff, and
having the extras the Amiga has that the 2500XL doesn't (stereo sound,
better animation, a considerably more powerful operating system), worth
the extra money?  The MS-DOS world's strongpoint is business programs
and even there, you can find programs that do the same thing for other
systems.  Generally I wouldn't recommend MS-DOS machines to people unles
they have a need to run specific applications that ONLY exist for MS-DOS
and it's necessary (say, for compatibility with their office) that they
be running the real McCoy instead of a "workalike" for another computer.
I would like to have an 8-MHz 8086 (not 8088) machine myself, but mostly
just so I can (1) read other people's MS-DOS disks easily, (2) have a
better machine than the Intertec Superbrain for modeming & word
processing (actually, the Superbrain is a better computer than a lot of
low-end MS-DOS machines, but it has a lot of pecularities I'd rather
live without), and (3) run Aladdin, the GEnie front-end program that's
the best argument for owning a PC compatible I've seen.  ("I use a
TRS-80 for all the serious stuff, the PC is just there so I can call
GEnie and download LS-DOS and Z-System programs more efficiently.")

know, though.)
 
Yes, a highly trained ex-sniper would make a great assassin, as he'd
probably fill in the 'gaps' of training.  My original point was that
an AVERAGE soldierguy isn't an assassin type.  I'd much rather see a
few Marines, or SEALs, Delta Force or whomever (normally it seems they
use SEALs and give Delta Force credit, although they've stopped trying
to pretend the SEALs don't exist -- which they were up until about two
years ago, kind of like pretending the Stealth bomber was top-secret at
the same time there were plastic models of them available at Eckerd's)
go in and try to assassinate Hussein and key Iraqi military leaders than

JFK's assassination, but there's nothing there to link them, or anyone
except Oswald, with the crime.  The fact that Oswald was himself killed

People in the military are training for a war, but not (hopefully)
wishing for one.  CG's opinion on a lot of things most assuredly does
not reflect either mine or Turtle's -- Chris and I have had some rousing
debates about all sorts of subjects on the now-defunt Rowrbrazzle BBS in
California.  You do need to call Armadillo more often, as Chris has
responded to your messages and you haven't received them yet.  Actually,
several people have responded to them, and one of them pointed out that
the trials at Nuremburg held the soldiers directly responsible for NOT
questioning orders.  Gosh, there's that name again, from someone who
isn't me or Turtle this time....
    The wisdom of Turtle's importing CG's message over here not
withstanding, the point was questioning our motivations for being over
in the Middle East, and the justification for putting American lives on
the line so that we can have lower prices at the gas pump.  You really
should call TAC fairly often (say at least every other day?) now that
you're a participant in that debate.
 
I don't think Chris is a complete enigma, although there are some things
I don't understand about him -- but I'm sure the reverse is also true.
The first part of a graphic novel by Chris will be the cover feature for
Mythagoras #4 (not the upcoming issue, but the one after that).

"Putz" and "schmuck" are both Yiddish for "penis," I believe (fairly
sure that's what schmuck translates as, not as sure about putz).
They've been in common enough usage for the past, well, several decades
that I wouldn't think many people would get sensitive over them, but I
suppose you can always find a few worrywarts out there in TV-land.

Wrong - they are drilled with the idea that esprit de corps overrides 
anything else.  All branches of the military is capable of gross
stupidity.  Almost all members are discouraged from individual thought.
The ones that refuse to be submerged are at best unhappy as they fight
for air in a sea of repression.  You are told that you should obey
orders without question.  They are casual about making the delineation 
between lawful and not - and imply that any questions in a war situation
should be brought up later.  Battlefield require immediate and un-
questioned obedience.
 
This is what they are told.  Common sense returns to most folks that 
have gone through the initial brainwash but there are a few that having
no spine ofg their own, incorporate the rigidity of the military as the
prop in their life.

BTW - I haven't forgotten you - I got yer call but work is an absolute
zoo.  The damned MetraByte people neglected to clarify an implication
that led to a rewiring job on my interface panel.  I work with a guy
that has training in /electrical/ work - he feeds me 24 volts DC and
5 VDC.  He used red & black for the 24 VDC but only had white and black
available for 5 vdc.  Not bad except that he reverted to AC color code
and I hooked the 5 volts up backward and fried a few thousand dollars 
in interface boards.  Sighhhhhh.  Behind schedule now and I had to 
totally rewrite the user interface because the graphics library that I
used has some sort of conflict with either the network drivers (likely)
or dies from being too much of a memory pig.  In any case this damned
thing locked up even the new Borland Debugger.  THEN the assembly
interface for the DtoA card fails to clean up the stack (leaves the 
passed parameters on the stack) so I have to send for the source and
modify it for the large memory model (A big fuck you to Intel and their
twisted joke of segmented architecture!!!!) so the poor brain dead thing
knows that it is talking to C now and not (!gag! <barf> GWBASIC).  Wow
today was a milestone as my computer successfully shook hands with the
Allen Bradley SLC500 for the first time (oh yeah - I had to design an
interface board because the friggin digital card that reads the switches
thinks that an open is a valid high ).  Anyway... then I had problems
with the windowing library because the idiot implemented a simple taskin
scheme whereby a function can be called in the keyboard loop.  He wrote
it into the windowed menueing functions and * failed* to allow for 
someone else to open a window while in the menu.  Shit!  I had to 
write what amounts to a small task switcher that watches resources
while in the task loop.  It's been a week!

I proposed a few *before* the post as did a few others.  I object to a 
country being invaded because they threaten to kick you in the balls
economically.  I just cannot equate dollars and cents with human life.
I think that the flames about economic upheaval and world economic 
collapse are Manifest Bullshit (tm).  We have plenty of reserves right
now and we have capacity in our offshore rigs.  Temporarily we would
be pressed really hard.  My blood runs cold when I hear people talk
about sending soldiers over to participate in a war that is not our own
for the sake of maintaining the status quo with regards to the world
economy (read US interests).  Those soldiers are human beings and are
being asked to give their lives for a monetary system that is over-
burdened with excesses, balanced to favor the wealthy and in desperate
need of radical surgery.  Hardly the noble cause of freedom and/or
human rights is it?

Well the text that the Jews use is derived from the same sources that
we get ours with  te exception of the NT of course.  There is an 
ancient form of Hebrew that has a few phrases and such that are a 
minor mystery to even Hebrew scholars.  Not to mention that Babylonian
tablets are consulted to verify the historical record (cuniform).
Thus the "errors" like the male/female components of the texts is 
wondered at by modern Jewish scholars - all the ones I have talked to
can't/won't guess at anything.  Not to mention the actual name of God
is NEVER written or spoken (so how in heck does it get passed down?
I've heard in a special cerimony in the temple)  All of the other names 
are really titles and descriptive names for God.

A lot of Yiddish pithy saying are pretty graphic sexually speaking.
putz is better know to you as "dick" or "prick" and involves the
person's character - not his tool.  Also it seems that most Yiddish
sayings are very denigrating of the victim.  Call someone a prick and
there can still be some machismo salvaged - a putz however is

   I know that "Schmuck" in Yiddish means "penis" (even though in
German it means "jewel") and THAT'S still a censored word... I'm not
sure where "putz" comes from...
    
    But, speaking about meaningless censorship: at one elementary
school, a kid wanted to read the poem "Trees." Anyway, the school banned
it immediately. Not only did it make reference to God, but the words
"breast" and "bosom" both appear in it! Scandalous.
     
   Seriously, what do y'all think about teaching religion in the public
schools? Should it be completely left out? Or is it possible to teach
about religion without implicitly nudging students toward a state 
religion?

   Believe it or not, I was trying to build up to that last line, and
I wasn't being serious about wondering what language the OT was really
written in. To be specific, it was Aramaic -- a branch of Hebrew. 
Except for a small portion of a few of the OT books (I believe Daniel
has a few lines in Persian, and the oft-quoted phrase "How shall we
worship the Lord in a foreign land?" was also in another tongue.)
   Personally, I believe any errors in the OT were due to scribes and
copiers -- not from any translation. (But they were doing amazingly 
well. It used to be the earliest copies of the OT were from the seventh
or eighth century -- until the Dead Sea Scrolls. And they were 
remarkably close to what we have now.)

Chip --
Religion should be taught in schools, but only in as many forms as it 
exists, and with no particular bias.
..
In other words, probably not, cuz I don't know a single person who can
teach that subject (or any) without their biases naturally coming 
through.  Maybe they could convince the kids to look past it, but then
how many people WANT to teach young kids to ignore their philosophies.
... but kids really do need to know the variety out there.  It would 
help, I think.   (Maybe if it were taught in private, not public schools
 - so the state would not be responsible, or could be blamed...)

I think that if the basics of religion are combined with courtroom
proceedures that you could teach it effectively.
  
  "And in the alleged Garden of Eden, there were supposedly tow
people, who were reputed to be Adam and Eve.  Now, circumstancial
evidence shows...
  
   Or something like that.  But I would hate to see religion taught
by a preist or rabbi or something like that.  
  
  "YEYESS!  Can you hear me students!  And so GOD came down from 
HEYEVEN and said to HIS PROPHET MOSES...I AYAM that I AYAM."
  
I wouldn't take a class like that...utter bullshit.  If religion cou;
could be taught on an informational basis, with all sides looked at,
(Muslim, Hinduism, Judism, Catholisicm, Confusianism, Buddhism) then
it would be a good learning experience.  (Plus it would allow
students to learn religion without all the extra slanted bullshit they
pump into you at a church or synagogue...and let them make an 
intelligent choice about a religion.  None of this, "If you believe it
in your heart..." bullshit...that leaves too much to the emotional
part of the mind and not enough to intelligent decision.  Besides,
if you believe enough with your heart, you can believe any bullshit,
because you simply don't have a grip on reality anymore.)

Point of message: Those are not all the religions of the world, nor
                  is it a listing of all major religions of the world.
       
   Those are simply NOT "all sides" looked at. First of all, you missed
Protestantism -- the religion most people of this board would probably
call themselves (if not simply "agnostic.") Protestantism was as much
of a branching off from Catholicism as Christianity was from Judaism.
(Luckily, Catholicism shifted toward Protestantism.) The Southern 
Baptist Coalition is still either the largest or second largest 
denomination in the U.S.
    
   Secondly, in order to get "all" the viewpoints, one must catalogue
"all" the religions. Not only is this a nearly impossible task (I have
the view that every person in this world has a slightly different view
of God -- or the Gods. Even athiests.) but it's insurmountable.
Religions change with time slowly or quickly, and what was once 
fashionable fades. 
     
Point of message, pt. 2: A proposed solution.
    
   Instead of trying to teach every religion in public schools, teach
students means of critiquing religion. Teach students how to think for
themselves -- and how to apply this freedom to religions. All religions
make assumptions about the world: teach students to critically examine
those assumptions (as well as find them!) Only a "few" religions would
need to be taught under those circumstances.

a floating-point instruction pipeline that must be kept full in order to

Tandy actually learned from the 1000 and is now in the habit of making
real honest-to-God PC architecture machines, at least in every aspect
save video (the Tandy line actually emulates the PCjr in video modes;
its standard is CGA resolution but with more colors). The Tandy 2000
was a special case; it was an 80186-based machine that was designed to
be MS-DOS compatible but *not* PC compatible (in a lot of ways, it was
what the IBM PC-AT /should/ have been--Tandy looked at the PC bus and
said "fuck that noise, we'll design our own"). Since PC architecture
caught on, though, there isn't really much call for MS-DOS machines that
aren't standard architecture, even though the standard architecture
is /slow/. Guess people want a home computer they can plug their
new 2400 baud Zoom modem into, and forget decent design. Personally, if
I were to design an MS-DOS machine, it'd probably be a 186 computer; it
has the same instruction set that the 286 does, minus some special
multitasking modes that you can't get to in PC architecture for various
arcane reasons, plus a whole bunch of neat-O high-speed I/O functions
the rest of the iAPX-86 family just doesn't have.

Yes, I've read Farenheit 451.
451 degrees is the temperature at which paper burns. Have you read 'the

After the individual has made his choice of religeon,then he has to 
choose a bible. 
There are so many versions out there. I own the KJV. There's also the 
New amplified version,the english revised version,the revised standard 
version,The New american bible.......and the list goes on.
What are the differences in all of these? Oh,and don't forget Mary Baker

to be a bible itself.

I know I'm late jumping into this but....Kennedy is an inspiration NOW,
due partly to his immortalization and canonization upon his unfortunate
death. However, had he lived, we might have seen what 'warmonger' really
means, and there's no telling where we'd be now. Nixon was a genius - 
kind of like Lex Luthor. Lot's to like there, but genius without guiding
morality can be dangerous. Grant ? Get serious. He was an good soldier, 
had the good fortune to be in charge when the northern industrial machin
was getting into high gear and the south was starving. But was a truly
dreadful president - cronyism and corruption at it's worst. And the 
only redeeming factor I can see in Jimmy Carter is that he seems a 
truly sincere Christian and do-gooder - that doesn't equate to being a 
leader of men.

If a good soldier is given an order he feels is wrong, he has several
options - the first and best is to say "Sir, with all due respect..."
and then voice your objection - respectfully. I don't mean attack an
officers decision and get belligerant - that'll get you nowhere. But 
officers are not omniscent, and a good one will accept intelligent 
input. If this fails, and you think the order is illegal, you may 
refuse an unlawful order (murdering civilian, eg) However, you better
be ready to prove it was an unlawful order at your court martial -
and if you do, you can testify at his court martial. There are other
options for dealing with truly poor leaders, who might endanger my
life unnecessarily, or go on felonous binges - but that would be
a tactical decision, and we're talking stategy here....

The 'what would I do if I won the lottery' conversation came up last
week, and I said that I would go back to school fulltime, perhaps to
a prestige school like Duke. One caveman looked at me like I was crazy,
wanted to know what the hell I needed school for if I had all that
money. I tried to tell him that 90% of school is fun, accomplishment, 
knowledge, etc. That got a condecending snort disbelief - from a guy
who takes twenty minutes to read a paint label. His plan was to buy
a desert island and stock it with pretty women. Not a bad idea, but
after 300 hours of wild sex, I'd want my 'puter. I occasionly bring

   True. I don't think the censors are really sure about what they want
on TV. They evidently weren't paying attention to what was going on when
editing "Little Shop of Horrors" since they substitued something else 
for "up yours" that didn't rhyme correctly in the song... It's odd too, 
since "up yours" has been said on television. Then there are times when 
"damn" is replaced by "darn". Only thing I can  think of is that a film 
with violence has to tone down the language... other  than that, the 
censors' policies puzzle me.

  I think speaking of or any other such activity involving religion in
schools is fine, as long as the
students are not made to choose anything.  I don't wish to have any push
in school to worship or such, but discussion of it is fine. A student 
should not be forced to listen to it, orbe forced to not talk about it.
 
 If it would come to making kids feel guilty for having or not having
something to do with religion, that would be wrong. I remember going to 
church with some friends years ago, and this guy laid a guilt trip on 
someone for missing church for a family outing. Anyways, I felt that was
quite stupid.

  I agree somewhat with your comments. It's a shame many people in the 
world today just don't give a
damn about knowledge and such. I don't like the pressure of school, and 
I certainly don't think it's too much fun, but I am discovering this 
year more than before that learning things is pleasurable. I have 
written stories, and I'd like to  learn more about how to write better. 
Then again, I don't really like literary criticism and poetry.
 
  I spoke with a person once. After this conversation, I felt real sorry
for him. It went like this:
 Him: (looking at me reading "The Resaurant at the End of the Universe")
  You reading that for school?
 Me: No.
 Him: What are you reading it for?
 Me: Because I like reading it.
 Him: I don't read anything unless my teacher makes me.
 Me: Haven't you ever read anything because you wanted to?
 Him: Yeah, I read a book on the Rolling Stones once.

the Tandy (whatever the numbers and letters that are suppose to follow

was looking for a reason to get an Amiga and not the Tandy.. well, the
mush people say that IBM has the most software support, but how many 
word processors can a person have? and seems to me that Amiga has just 
about every kinda program that IBM has.... (cept for the ones that 
certain people hire programmers to write them up a special mush prgram)

I thought that a smuck was a term used by Milton Burel to refer to 
people who were somewhat less than of the genus statue. It is like
the polish jokes today.
Puts was a rear end. The DeSoto commercials when they were live
had an announcer who used that term for the rear of a car. The girl
who modelled the car got offended and sued. She thought the anouncer
was referring to her rear end.

that he was throwing money down a rat hole if I was not for real. My

   Maybe I've lost the train of this message string, but did anyone
actually claim that Kuwait WAS a democracy?  Besides the U.S.'s
dubious record of propping up dictatorships, we also have a history of
bailing out monarchies.  For being a society that supposedly is proud

would have to have a big advertising blitz.
  
 Don't ge me wrong...as good as the Amiga is, too many people just 
don't care...they don't know the difference, so they buy IBMs and

It does appear that the same rules for objections to an order, go for
the business world as well as the military. Diplomacy is always
required, even during times of "peace". 
   So many of my fellow engineers have bit the big one because they
felt THEY were right and their BOSS was wrong, and rather then playing
office politics , they ATTACKED the decision and ended up working
somewhere else. One person CAN make a difference, as long as they know
how to apply their political strength to obtain their goals and don't
get macho and foolish and think management will do what is RIGHT....HA!

Oddly enough, this is exactly the /opposite/ argument that the Chris
Grant the Specialist & Yngling were reviling made recently -- that one
of the advantages of our military structure & training is that our
soldiers are a great deal more flexible than most, and that soldiers are
often rewarded for taking the initiative in a situation that requires
it.  And as has been pointed out several times in this discussion, the
Nuremburg trials completely discounted the "I was just following orders"
line as a valid excuse for doing things you could intuit are morally or
ethically bankrupt.
   At any rate, the military people I know have never been "submerged"
and out of six (counting the Specialist), only one of them came away
from the military with bad impressions -- not as much because of a "sea
of repression," but because of bureaucratic incompetence through the
chain of command.  I am sure there are many who /do/ fit the description
you gave, and there are probably far too many who believe that following
orders really does equate to turning off one's brain.  Saying that
everyone believes that, and that they are all "trained" to believe that,
is stretching things.  The few COs I have spoken with briefly all gave
me the impression that the higher up one goes, the more likely one is to
have demonstrated personal initiative -- which seems to be a strong
argument against the "you are rewarded for being an idiot" picture.
   Chris and I had a discussion about perception of the military, and it
seems a lot of people's ideas come from two schools -- typified by the
movies "Top Gun" and "Platoon."  According to a lot of soldiers, they ar
BOTH equally unrealistic.

Tandy peripherals have never been non-standard on the IBMs -- the Tandy
specific cards are ones that are shorter, as a lot of the Tandy models
don't accept full-length IBM cards.  Most of the 1000 series except for
the originals (1000 and 1000A) aren't all that bad, just not all that
good... :)

Not true.  The reason that most games have specific Tandy switches is
that the Tandy CGA mode supports 16 colors instead of 4, and a lot of
games will have improved color if you tell them you're running on a
Tandy.  Also, most Tandy machines have a built-in 3-voice music
synthesizer, and some games (although far too few) will also take
advantage of that if you tell them to.  If you buy an IBM version and
run it on the Tandy, or run them without specifying a command-line
switch to tell it you're a Tandy machine, they'll still run, but they'll
lose the extra graphics & sound capabilities.  You don't HAVE to buy a
Tandy version ... but given a choice, you should.
 
> You can still build your own clone for cheap.
 
This is Raven's argument, too.  The proper response is, "No, YOU can
still build your own clone for cheap" -- 99% of the people in the world
would rather have it come ready-to-run out of the box, a brand name they
know on the case and a 1-year warranty supported by a company that has
stores on every street corner, even if it means paying 40% more for the
product.  If that wasn't the case, Heathkit would be the world's largest
electronic/computer chain....

Actually, the most valid reasons for being over there may be to (a)
protect our allies, and (b) to contain Saddam Hussein.  Kuwait was never
a great friend of America, although they weren't antagonistic, and they
had the sort of monarchy that America was founded to get away from.  If
Saudi Arabia wasn't in danger of being invaded, and Kuwait wasn't a
significant source of oil for the Western world, I sincerely doubt we
would be over there.  The risk is obviously NOT minimal, despite what
some people would like to think (hell, it's still a battlefield
situation even if shots haven't been fired yet), and despite what OTHERS
would like to believe about President Bush, I don't think he would send
troops into a situation where the potential return for the risk of war
is essentially neglible.  (That's the biggest argument against our
involvement in Vietnam, IMHO -- people can argue about whether or not we
could have won or what we should have done differently until time ends,
but even if everything had gone splendidly, we still would have lost
thousands of soldiers merely to uphold the image of America as Champion
Of The Oppressed, regardless of the fact that neither side in Vietnam
was particularly admirable.)

There are comparative religion classes -- one could theoretically take a
few of those, along with some more in-depth classes.  I'd add a class
in Paganism to the major religions, just to round things out (and
because the various Pagan religions are really some of the more
interesting ones out there, and in some ways more logical, or at least
consistent, than any of the major, established ones).
 
Of course, from my own experience and from talking with others, taking a
few good courses in comparative religion generally leads people to
atheism or agnosticism, or occasionally to a religion that does not
demand believers follow it as "the one true path to salvation."  It's
very difficult to "know" something completely and utterly in your heart
when you realize there are a lot of other people out there who know
something completely and utterly CONTRADICTORY with the same degree of
certainty.

Actually, the impression he gave you (obey or be repressed) is 
sometimes true...it depends largely on what field you are in and 
who your CO is....  Also, personal initiative is rewarded only when
it is along military lines.  (Re-structuring to streamline, which
benifits the military is a world apart from debating the wisdom of
troop movements with your CO, or ordering your troops to a different
positions in contradiction to the CO without a damn good reason [like
endangerment of life and limb].)

Personally, I'd get an Amiga as my next computer if I was going to spend
over $1K on a machine.  (You can get Amigas for less than that, I know,
but if I got an Amiga I would want it to be an Amiga 3000 -- the stuff
I'd want to use it for would require several megs of memory and a 68030
w/math coprocessor.)  There are a few programs I'd like to be able to
run that so far only exist on the IBM, like a text editor called VEDIT
(actually, VEDIT also exists for Z-System machines -- not for Amigas,
though) and GEnie's "front door" program, Aladdin, and WordStar, my
favorite word processor next to AllWrite.  However, those programs
aren't sufficient justification to not get an Amiga -- I'd learn to make
do with Excellence 2.0 for word processing, and live without Aladdin.
(Or just see if I could get a used XT for $200 or so just to run
WordStar & Aladdin on it, which would probably blow a few fuses 'round
the IBM boards in Sarasota.  I already told somebody at Computerland
that I only use MS-DOS for modeming, and do everything serious on a
TRS-80 or CP/M machine.  He looked at me like I had just flown here from
Pluto.)
    At any rate, unless you have to give price a significantly higher
weight over performance, or you need to run programs that only exist in
the MS-DOS world, I'd still suggest going with the Amiga.

I certainly wouldn't.  Only full IBMs can display them, and writing a
TCAP driver for a BBS that knows the extended characters for most
terminals and does two-way translation would be a great deal more
trouble than it's worth.  (Being an egalitarian weenie, I figure that
if everyone on the system who has a terminal capable of doing an action
isn't allowed to do it by the BBS software, the BBS software isn't
doing its job.  PBBS gets around this, of course, by knowing absolutely
nothing about any terminals at all, and treats everyone equally badly.)

rule of thumb is at work.  But presumably, that wasn't the sort of thing

Arthur C. Clarke won the Hugo and Nebula awards for the novels
RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA and CHILDHOOD'S END, and also wrote the short
story "The Sentinel," which Stanley Kubrick based the movie "2001: A
Space Odyssey" on.  Clarke also wrote the novel for 2001, along with
two sequels (a third and final one is in the works), and most recently
wrote RAMA II and CRADLE, co-authored with Gentry Lee.  He is also
considered, along with Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, to be one of
the "old masters" of science fiction, which is probably why Turtle and

Yes -- Reagan had the ability to choose a good staff, which took over 
when he fell asleep at meetings

Now let's examine this closely:
>if the phone company...they'd probably do a better job of it
Do you obtain your phone service from the /same/ GTE that I do?  Man,
that's like a quantum leap in logic.  The poor quality of the tap in-
dicates that it's /probably/ the Phone Police.
>you'd think the cops'd be able to do a competent job...
Yes, you'd think so - but we know better don't we?  But unless you're
involved in some illegal activity I'm unaware of, I can't see locals
maintaining the tap for so long.  
 Again, assuming you're not a Soviet dupe or an Iraqui, I can't see the
Feds maintaining interest in A/R or your private conversations for this
long.
  And for a private concern to attempt a tap, let alone maintain it for
so long, especially since it would involve monitoring a carrier wave,
would be awfully expensive.
  This leaves two probabilities:
     1) GTE
     2) You are not the interest of the monitoring agency.  Perhaps the
        interest is in someone who uses this bbs regularly - which might
        also explain why other local bbs'es appear to be monitored on a
        regular basis.
  And one possiblity:
     1) A smartass who's just doing it for kicks, for practice, or as 
        part of a personal vendetta against you.
Of course, there are always options which I might have overlooked.

I was /not/ astounded at MMA's "knowledge gap."  Apalled, dismayed,sad-
denned,sickened,shocked, and surprised...but not /astounded./  I havent
been /astounded/ since I was about 10 years old and found a VERY hard 
core pornographic magazine by the side of the road, the very title of
which is enough to either arouse or repulse (depending on the individual
of course) the average male American.

Well said, except I would have said "on the *sole* grounds".  Believe

I agree, but most of his stuff is good enough that I can say that I like
most of his work...

Hmmm.  Possible, but who could *stand* being married to one?  Ugh!
Scarred for life.

Seems to me it would depend on who was in the jury.  Course, I guess
that it wouldn't matter, though...you are supposed to be tried by
"a jury of your peers".  There is not a yuppie alive who is "peer"
to me, so I'd probably get off free on it. 
  
  
...unless the judge was a yuppie...Oh, NO!
