S>Mopars make me sick...
  
Ah, yes, I used to get sick every time a Mustang would beat my Camaro.
I have the ability to identify any Mustang, make and year from the
tailights....  I am rapidly forgetting them, though...now I can identify
them from thier headlights...the ones that always receede in my rear
view mirror.  (And Camaro's too.)   My dear lady, perhaps you should 
obtain a Mopar.  Then you can avoid being sick from being defeated.

Well, Turbo's random number generator isn't all that good to start
with, but it /shouldn't/ be doing what you describe...if
BPower<YPower to start with then after you add a random number to each
BPower should still be less than YPower about as often as you'd expect
given how much they were different by to start with. If you send me the
code you're using I'll take a look at it...
 
...you know, it just occurs to me that Randomize always reseeds the
random number generator the same way. Try doing it without using a
Randomize function between the two calls to Random. If that changes your
outcome significantly, you might consider only using Randomize once, at
the start of the program.

Depends on your theology. Personally, I won't worship a diety that
sees fit to keep a private torture chamber for his mistakes, but issues
of faith aside, it's not all that logical to assume that any divine
being would see fit to consider suicide an unforgivable sin when crimes
against other people are generally a trivial matter to absolve. 'Course,
you gotta expect that injunction form a faith that preaches life on
earth is the misery before the Great Beyond; can't have all the faithful
going to their final rewards by their own choosing, can you? Otherwise,
you got no faithful left to lead, you know?

Did you ever see a movie called "Dark Star," by any chance? In it, this
guy ends up teaching existentialism to a smart bomb in an effort to keep
it from exploding while it's still attached to the ship; the bomb is
convinced that its purpose in life is to explode, and the guy is saying
"How do you know? How do you know there's anything out there to even
give you a purpose?" Great movie.

Not at all. Jill's birthday and Lori's birthday fall almost exactly
one week apart. I was responsible for the goings-on at both parties,
both of which were not anticipated by the birthdayees. Well, I believe
no birthday should go unnoticed, and if that means kidnapping the

I don't think so; if something's posted in a public forum that's
owned by a third party and obviously intended for public consumption,
I don't think you need special permission to reprint it (so to
speak). I don't think the copyright courts have addressed this one,
though.

Not really. Things do occasionally go right, but only so they can go

Legally, a sysop is absolutely responsible for anything appearing on his

They're not the only Christians who believe that. The Jehovah's

About suicide, I agree with you Saavik.  Too many won't allow people 
to show their true emotions.  Therefore, people can't express their 
need for help.  I've tried to make sure my friends know that they can
call me at any time for any reason, just so they know they've got

admire strong men. No, I'm not just talking muscles here. My husband and
I have a relationship built on trust and respect. But in the end, he is
the boss. He wouldn't make a major decision without me, and he respects 
my opinion. But, I look to him for help more than he looks to me.

She tried taking pills one time and after a short trip to 5 north, she 
seemed to get her life together. Then she tried again. This time, she 
was diognosed as a manic depressive and given medication. Again, she 
seemed to get her life together. She didn't call me for a long time. 
When I called her, she sounded cheerful and had nothing but good things 
to say. Then, not much later..... a got a call from a mutual friend 
telling me she was in the hospital after jumping off the Skyway. She 
never regained conciousness. She just wouldn't open up to me after she 
started taking the medication. I felt so........., helpless.

My dear, who in the world told you that being rude was not allowed by th
the rules?  They are most assuredly inserting themselves into your life
with no other purpose than to attempt a subtle reoraganizing of your

Damn!  It cleared up after all right when I had committed myself to

dropping everything and boogiing over to check out but....  duty called
I did get to play raquetball tonite tho... I had to get nasty with one
of the jerks I played partners with.  He's one of those morons that 
starts screaming everytime you screw up and rants about winning.  I
finally lost it and said that /I/ was here for fun.  He wasn't winning
and I wasn't having any fun so the hell with it!  He decided to cool 
off and we finished anyway -- I just thought I'd share that since Lori
and I were discussing that sort of thing and it's precisely that
sort of thing that discourages people from wanting to do stuff like 
play a sport on a non-combat level.  Sighhhh why can't people learn

>But that's not fair.
 
Nope, but it's the law. There have been cases of sysops who have been
arrested and prosecuted for information left on their systems. Legally
speaking, if you run a BBS you are liable for it, period. In fact, on
my advice another BBSer recently did a little research about BBSes and
the law and produced a list of all applicable Federal and state laws
that apply (the two most restrictive states? Florida and Pennsylvania--
the two states in which I have run BBSes). Turned out to be a LARGE
text file. For example, did you know a sysop can be prosecuted under
obscenity laws if the information on his system (including, but not
limited to, text, machine-readable graphic images, etc) can be construed
as being obscene? Or that a sysop can be held accountable if a user
who is a minor runs into anything remotely questionable? Or that
electronic mail left on a BBS to another user /must/ be made accessable
to that user, and the sysop may read such mail but may not disclose
its contents or refuse access to it? (Believe it or not, there actually
has been a court case to test this one, but not in this state.) Cool
stuff.

I generally welcome Jehovah's Witnesses with open arms (so to speak)
and am more than happy to invite them in for protracted periods of
time. I can argue theology with the best of them, and have the advantage
of formal instruction in logic and philosophy (or, 1,001 Ways To Shoot
Down the 'Argument From Design' Proof of God's Existance)--and I'm just
nasty enough that if someone barges into my house with the intent of
persuading me that whatever view I have of the cosmos is wrong and I
must be converted, I feel any moral obligation on my part to respect the
beliefs of others is null and void. There was one person in particular
who returned (with several others) several times for these little
discussions, and for all the arguments they produced in favor of their
rather peculiar cosmology I was able to produce a rebuttal or a
counterexample. She actually started wavering--which prompted the quick
termination of the discussion and a refusal on the part of the Witnesses
to return. They'll still leave me with various bits of propoganda, which
I add to my collection (I now have over a thousand pages of religious
propoganda on file, mostly Fundamentalist, Southern Baptist, and
Jehovah's Witnesses) but they won't come inside or talk to me. *sniff*
I guess my soul just isn't worth redemption.

Want some counterexamples? I would state that as a general rule a
stable relationship should have two equal partners, but that's just
me. I will also state that in most of the relationships I've seen
which have one dominant member, it's usually an ego thing or (more
often) an insecurity thing rather than a "mutual trust and respect"
thing. But then again, I think jealousy is one of the greatest forces
for evil known to man, so what do I know?

But can't really hold a candle to real conversation when discussing
sensitive subjects, yesno? The bandwidth is too small (no body
language, no tone of voice information), there's too much chance for
misinterpretation, and unless you're in real-time chat it lacks
a certain sence of immediacy. Not to say that chat mode can't be an
interesting thing...*ahem*.

Sorry to hear of your friend's death.
I myself have contemplated suicide when things were really bad. 
Sometimes people feel that there's no end to the misery they endure,
whether it be the loss of a loved one or the hardships that life throws 
at them.
  My reason to continue is because I have a sister that I love very much
and that things would eventually get better. I have learned of the
self-preservation that is so necessary to continue living.
 
It helps to talk about your problems, no matter what they are. I've done
it before, and it has always made me feel better, and sometimes has 
given me a new perspective of the problem at hand.
 
I do, however, believe in euthanasia when there is no chance for 
recovery. (a whole separate subject for further debate if you wish)
SEE YA!

Most assuredly a simple bid for attention and not a serious act of
self-annihilation.  I read somewhere that true suicides research the
subject very carefully so that they /will not fail/.  I have also been
told by a homicide (forensics) expert that a true suicide inevitably
leaves a suicide note.  Scariest thing I ever went through was my
buddy called one night (from three states away) and told me that he
had been sleeping with his .357 magnum but couldn't find the guts to
pull the trigger.  Ahhhhh sheeeeyut!!!  Now what do you do when you
really might make a difference?  As I recall I said something like;
"Gee I would think that it's obvious".. (buddy) "what's obvious?"
(me)"You weren't looking for courage - you were attempting stupidity
which is out of reach for a person of your great inner strength"
(or some such crapola that apparently worked or helped).
Scared the shit right out of me because I *couldn't* get to him on a 
personal level - just that friggin phone and the sound of him twirling
the cylinder...
