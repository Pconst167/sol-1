Just something that'll restrain without causing physical damage, you

limit to their uses. Some types of belts work quite nicely as well...the
kind with the buckle that grabs hold and doesn't need holes in the belt.

Yeah. If the person on the other end isn't intelligent and creative, it

seen a few people who can do an adequate job of chatmode sex, but it's

There has been some questions on the Hovercrafts on the Island. 
 
There are two, one belonging to Robert, one belonging to Korelyan
and his father. The hovercraft (owned by Korelyan) is used 
for emergencies, and for Korelyan to travel back and forth from
his parents home on the island of Jax.  
 
The hovercrafts run on alcohol fuel which is aquired by trade from
visiting ships. It's very expensive and the person bringing a 
good amount of it to the Den can expect "royal treatment" and 
lot's of credits toward "good times". 
 
In the Northern clusters, north of the Florida Chains, the fuel
is produced by a network of large land owners. These "fat cats" 
pretty much have the monopoly on fuel production. This was the 
fuel of choice even before the Trogs ruined the world as it is
non polluting, easy to produce and ship. 
 
Due to lack of communications, news does not travel fast to the 
Den. The islands use a short wave radio system to communicate with
each other. 
 
Most of the ships and craft coming in to the Den are privatly 
owned. There aren't many large corporations around anymore due
to the lack of telecommunications in the World. 
 
There is a form of currency on the Islands that is traded for 
at all trading posts in the Florida Chains and is good on any 
of the islands within that domain. 
 
Currency from other goverments (and there are many throught out
the world) have little value. Currency can be gained by trading
goods at the trading posts or by rendering services. 
 
Beware the S.A.G. They are a supremist movement against the Furries
and Morphs. They are world wide in groups.
 
A few notes on staff:
 
The bartender at the main bar in the Den 's name is Jarvis. 
Correct me if I enough... so lets
now on.

Madam of the Brothel is Tampa, a fox Morph. And the bar owner

Fennec, those "home" test are ok, but the clinic tests are much more 
accurate. When I was pregnant with my first.... I had a bunch of 
symptoms... I was /sure/ that I was pregnant, but the home test said 
NO. I took it again a week later    NO. I went to a clinic.... NO. 
Then about two weeks later.... I went back to the clinic..... Yes. 
Same thing with the second child. I got a YES then a NO then I went 
to the Doctor and he said even before the test YES.

There are only 256 gates on the Way, and many, many side paths which

   Are we talking about the same Kelly here?  Poor, I'd admit to.
Deliciously sweet, yes.  But 'innocent'? (Cherub I'm not touching.)
    
   Kelly is a wonderful hostess, fantastic friend, and gives superb
backrubs. She is an extremely loving person, with many fantastic
qualities.  But 'innocent' isn't one of those qualities.  (Though
she fakes it extremely well.)

I've had relationships that work both ways, and I couldn't disagree with
you more. Open relationships only work if they're built on a pretty
solid foundation of trust, and sometimes the only way to /get/ that
trust is to be involved in the relationship for a while and let it
develop before you involve other people. Trust is something that's
/learned/. Relationships that start out open usually have all kinds of
weird stresses built into them from the outset, and like a bridge that's
built with stressed steel they may look solid for a while but they
can collapse without warning.

   I've never been married, so I'm no authority.  But, I've had two
serious proposals.
   Some people say the idea of marriage is so that you don't ever need
to date again.  Some people say marriage is so two soul-mates can live
together, for the rest of their lives.  Some say marriage is a secure
place for children.  They're all right.
   Marriage is, mostly, what you think it is. Think to yourself: why am
I getting married?  For love alone?  For financial reasons?  (Heck! At
NC, there was a rash of marriages for financial aid reasons alone.  That
was a third marriage proposal I had...) 
   Now that the pressure is off, look long and hard at your relationship
and decide: can it stand up to the daily pressures of marriage?

Well, if you /really/ want to hear it.......... it was a complete 
travesty and quite by accident that I got "involved" with barbed wire. 
It was during a romantic interlude in the loft of a barn (I know I know.
Typical...) Anyway, things were getting.....*hot*.....when we rolled 
over and managed to get entangled in a roll of barbed wire. Well, 
we both had our shirts half on and the barbed wire was all caught up in 
them and no matter how we twisted and turned..... we were sort of stuck
together by this sharp wire digging into our flesh..... 
 
Picture this........ someone heard us from down below..... 
"Ouch ouch. Damn it that hurts~!!!! hold still. There. A little to the 
left." 
"OUCH, I can't get loose.... Hold still!!!! Take your shirt off!!!!" 
 
Worse part about it was after we got our shirts off which was no easy 
trick because we were both tangled up big time.... then we couldn't 
get our shirts out of the barbed wire.    Meanwhile, there's someone 
down in the barn hollaring. "Hey! What's going on up there!!!!!" 
  
It's one of those things you laugh about later, like, after you get done
applying the iodine to all the scratches......

Well, I am willing to make thoses concessions. Yes, Peeping Toms are 
wrong.... they are invading someones privacy and same with flashers. 
They /are/ hurting someone else.... 
As for child pornography. You say it's wrong even if the child is 
willing..... I assume you are talking about young children and that goes
without saying..... A young child would probably be /willing/ just to 
please the adult.... that is child molestation, my friend and that is 
/also/ hurting someone.

I called a BBS the other night and the Sysop (who will go unnamed) got 
me in chat mode and preached to me for 20 minutes. He said that the only
reason I had called was because God had planned it that way. It was his 
last ditch effort to save my soul..... Yeah, now I'm gonna burn in hell 
because after 20 minutes of listening to this... I hung up.

Dogs are good therapy too. 
 
don't laugh now...... I used to be a member of Sarasota Obediance 
Training Club (Dog obediance not wife obediance), one of the things we 
used to do (and the club still does) is go to Nursing homes with the 
dogs and let them visit with the people there. It's called "Animal 
Therapy".  The folks loved it....... the dogs? Well the dogs, for the 
most part, really liked being allowed to mug and slobber on people and 
not get in trouble for it.

Is that a common problem???? Modem vs Software???? You see, I have an 
external Zoom at home and an Internal Zoom at work. I run both PcAnywher
and Crosstalk at both places... but at work I have all kinds of problems
I'm almost sure it has more to do with the network (not to mention that 
it's a Compaq computer) than the modem.

>I still don't understand the Porcupines wading in the stream behind
>the Prophet.
      
   That one's easy. The Eternally Green stream represents the
Faith's attempt to seek out its own level: to follow gravity, where
it may lead.  The Eternally Green stream also represents purity and
clensing -- kinda sorta.  (Did you notice the toxic waste dump at the
beginning of the stream?)  The Stream is Green, for that is the color
of Lime Jello, one of our twelve Sacraments.
   Did you notice the ribbons in the porcupines' hair? There are five
kinds of porcupines in the water.  Those with the black ribbons are
the zealots of other religions, trying to snatch our porcupines from
the water.  However, these 'blackies' always forget that our True
Believers are also porcupines, and they usually get stung.  Those with
yellow ribbons are afraid to enter into the water. In every poster, at
least one points to the toxic waste dump.  The ones with blue ribbons
are those who are merely testing the waters of the Path, afraid to
float in the Mercies of Our Armadillo. (All hands, hooves, and paws 
make the sign of the Armadillo.)  Those with red ribbons can be safely
ignored, until you've dived deeper into our True Religion. But those
wearing the Four Ribbons: one white, one brown, one purple, and one
silver, are those who have learned to float upstream, and are those who
know Our Armadillo.
