Hey, I thought you liked IBM!  hehehe  Anyways, naw, BMW's are fairly
nice-looking (I think) .. They go faster than my Toyota .. The new one
has 12 Cylenders, and they are well-built ... No, the IBM of the car
market would be a company that charges $100,000 for a new car, and when
a belt breaks, you have to replace the entire engine for $70,000 instead
of the $25 belt!

just talking about this last night) ... some furries I know who shall 
remain nameless (actually a few of them) ... you kinda have to talk to 
them like you'd talk to a sprinkler.  Whenever the head is pointed in

don't worry about it.  Go to the furry party and have fun.

Why??!! Sex is a part of every normally functional adult's life, and
it makes little (read: no) sense to treat it as somehow unspeakable
or intrinsically different from any other type of experience. I can
understand finding conversation about something you don't happen to
enjoy distasteful, but why would it be a problem to talk about?

Ding, yourself!!!!! So I am a little uptight when it comes to discussing
sex. It comes from having parents who were 40 years old when I was born.
Sex was something you DID NOT talk about in my house. Now that I am 
older, (and wiser?) I can talk about it, but I still get embarrassed. 
I'm working on it......, I would probably be a "real" prude if it hadn't
been for the surrogate family I had as a teenager. 
Sex is something that lots of people have trouble discussing. It doesn't
mean that they are UPTIGHT!!!!! I can fling induendos with the best of 
them.... but a serious sexual conversation is a little harder for me.

   The gentleman in question had made a habit of literally bashing

some HIV-positive blood of a homosexual got mixed with his blood while

   I think what he was talking about was conversation. On a BBS, there
can be a large number of conversations going on all at once, and every-
one has time to respond or not to everyone else. In real life, it's
hard to "butt in" on a conversation without being rude; on a BBS, it's
extremely easy. Also, on a BBS, you have time to type long expressions
like this withou boring the other person; that doesn't happen in real

Things to do around the Sarasota/ Bradenton area:
    
1. Practice your jogging. Go to the center of the New College Palm
   Court and shout, "YOU BUNCH OF HIPPIE FREAKS! DON'T YOU KNOW THE

2. Practice the fine art of spoon-hanging.
    
3. Try to pickpocket a policeman's gun. (Always wonderful for some 
   laughs!)
    
4. Start a new religion.
    
5. Skinny-dip in the ocean and shock the retirees.
     
6. Practice your jogging. At midnight, take a leisurely stroll down
   MLK drive with a T-shirt reading "David Duke for LA governor."
     
7. Try to find a store that sells sealing wax. (I'm serious!)

   It's easier to discuss sex when the words are just "blips on a 
screen" than when you're discussing it face-to-face. Over a modem,
there's not much of a chance the person is trying to seduce you.
In person, it's often a thinly disguised attempt.

   The strongest alcohol we've had at furry parties have been "Hot and

   Bring alcohol if you feel like it: use your judgement who to offer

I disagree there, too. There's a difference between 'discussing sex' and
'bragging about your sexual exploits'; the latter is more likely to
be a thinly (or not) disguised attempt at seduction.

That's true, but one of the worst habits to get into is getting 
yourself into a situation, realizing you can't deal with it and 
then evaporating.  Trust me, I know.  Talking about things like sex
on a bulletin board might FEEL safer, because you never have to 
look who you're talking to in the eye, you can spend time between 
question and answer thinking about the "truth" of a matter and whether
or not you want to let it out, and you DO have an alias, or an option
to keep anonymity.  
 
 In any case, using a BBS for those kinds of discussions can be a 
sort of therapy, because once you tell a 'secret' and you get a 
response to it, you can let your guard down because you know what
to expect as a response.

Hmmm.  Would I feel good?  No, but I would feel vindicated. 
 
Look at it like this.  I hate fags, because they are sick, and they 
act strangely, and they just repulse me.  So, if a fag comes to me and
propositions me, then I have to look at it like this:  he looked at me,
and figured that I looked enough like a fag to come and proposition me.
Therefore, he thinks that I look like a fag.  Keeping in mind that I 
find fags utterly repulsive, by association, he has just insulted me.
If someone insults me, usually I can pass it off, or let it slide.  Some
men can't field insults about thier mothers without "going off" on you.
I can't (WON'T) field insults which insinuate that I'm gay.  
 
Besides, if someone you didn't like came up and gave you the most 
blatant insult you can think of, what would you do?  I think you would 
find it difficult to ignore....

I've had that happen before. A friend & I were discussing something of a

After numerous attempts to get him to reply, I hung up. We re-connected 
later, and it turned out that his keyboard locked up on him.
Needless to say, I was panicking in the meantime, thinking that I may

No...George Bush is merely guilty of putting self-interest before the
good of the nation. He doesn't really want to tackle the country's
myriad of domestic problems because, to paraphrase one of his advisors,
"the situation in the country right now and the problems it is
experiencing are ideally suited to keeping the Republicans in power
indefinitely." Jesse Helms, on the other hand, honestly and truly
believe that he has God personally behind him, and that makes him
much more dangerous...and much more sickening.

No. Ward was running the original CBBS until about three years ago,
when he turned it over to someone else and decided to pursue different

You really should stop attaching labels to people. EI: This one is GAY,

    together. 
 
Now, there's a very debatable subject. I happen to think they should be 
banned. And that not a prejudice statement. ANY chance of passing AIDS 
on should be avoided. Certainly a Doctor, of all people, should agree 
with that. Even if there's only one in a million chance.

which was intended for gays never would have gotten any farther.  But 
no one bothered to filter out the diseased individuals, and "people who

Funny you should wonder - my buddy in Ca. was training to be a 
paramedic and they made him pull several stints in the E-room to see
what range that human suffering could take (weeds out the idealists
in a hurry).  Jim was absolutely amazed at the range of articles that
the doctors had to remove from the human (not just male!) anus.
The most common article was the common soda bottle.  Turns out that the
warmth of the rectal tract will cause a partial vacuum and literally 
suck that puppy right up there and it takes a *very* strong pull to
get it back out.  The second most popular (???!!!) object is the
common light bulb - now /that's/ scary!

Well, after conking out on me the night of Turtle's birthday party, I 
am pleased to announce the Smog-Monster (which it has become 
affectionately known) is back in running order...turns out that when 
I put the 440 in, I neglected to switch the ignition over to point 
ignition---I just hooked up the point distributor to the electronic
ignition and started it up.  Well, it ran so I went with it and decided
(someday) to put an electronic distributor back in it.   
  Not having the correct voltages to work with results in a shorted out
electrical system...which I found out the hard way.  So, I ended up 
replacing not only the distributor, but the ballast resistor, the 
starter relay, the electronic voltage regulator and (last but not least(
the alternator.  Not to mention a few fused and separated wires. 
Expensive?  Not too bad, the whole cost of the switchover was around
$70...and when he put in the new ignition, he also adjusted the idle 
and the timing.  
  The upshot of this whole thing is that it's back, and badder than e
ever...so maybe it wasn't such a bad thing that it died at 8:30 on a
Saturday night stranding me out on 301.  But it sure sucked the big one
at the time. 
  Course, I won't be doing any heavy duty racing for a while...seems 
that the Smog-Monster is also a Torque-Monster, and I've broken an
engine mount.  Shit.

You're running an IBM clone, right? I'd suggest checking out TP-Board
or RemoteAccess, both of which are Shareware and will only put you out
about twenty or thirty bucks to register. The more expensive BBS
packages (like Wildcat, which is a couple hundred bucks, I think)
are howling dogs that you don't want to come near (if someone offers
you Wildcat, run, don't walk, in the other direction). The only
commercial BBS package I've seen for the IBM that's any good is
TBBS, and it costs about $900 to set up...and you've got to be a pretty
good programmer, too, since it's actually a /language/ for writing
BBS systems.

Well, since it's hard to actually do anything other than leave messages

much younger than the types who simply come on to everything with a

Yes and no. Sometimes the long turnaround time in the message base is
a drawback rather than an advantage. Chat mode is a little more direct
and a little more immediate than conversations in the message base,
so it's closer to, say, a telephone conversation (only without the tone
of voice being communicated). Hmm...I think chat mode is actually

Therefore, by extension, since fags kiss one another, the act of

Your belief of banning Drs. that have contracted AIDS is quite Valid,
Rubber gloves just don't cut it.
 
On the other hand (no pun intended), what if you were a doctor... let's 
say 20 years inpractice, and you contract AIDS from a blood transfusion
necessary from a recent operation that you had?
Who would pay for your re-training for a new career? The taxpayers are 
burdened enough with welfare, etc... .
One solution that I see would be to put a special tax on medical & 
surgical supplies...let's say .05%. The half-percent is small enough not
to produce sticker shock and the volume of supplies sold is plenty to
enable the fund to be functional.
The fund would be used to assist afflicted doctors in training for a new
career.
 
What do you think? Despite your belief [which I agree with], you can't 
just drop 'em on the street corner.

Again, you are assuming that AIDS is a "gay disease". From what I have

It would be a shame to see a Doctor lose his career because he has AIDS.
But what about the other thousands of people who lose their careers and 
lives and loved ones to the diesise. You can't compensate them all, and 
indeed, why should it be the responcibility of the tax payers to do 
this? It's a rough subject........ I know. But throughout history, there
have been plagues.... this is just another chapter, hopefully not a 
final chapter. The statistics are frightening world wide. I've only 
known, personally, one person who died of AIDS. Before his death, he 
lost his job, his friends, most of his family (they were afraid to see 
him and even more afraid to touch him). He was left alone. He died in 
the hospital and only three people other than the Nurses and Doctors 
ever contacted him before he died. It was really a travesty.

Y'know, my whole problem with homos is what they do...not just that 
they are abberant, contra-survival lifeforms.  Women "getting it on
" (%#&@$$!! quote keys!) with other women and guys "getting it on
" (ARRRGH) with other guys is pretty disgusting; the variant forms 
of how they do it can be even more disgusting.  First of all, I wouldn't
play with shit, niether would I put my dick into an orfice which 
contains shit.  And I find anything sexual that has to do with 
excrement (including urine) exceptionally disgusting.  Don't try to 
"Therefore, by extention" on the particular trend I mentioned because
it was exclusive to what I mentioned...obviously, hetros kiss and
undress each others...and some wierdos even get into anal sex.  But when
I say "sickeningly gay", I was referring to that particular act of 
homosexual anal intercourse.  (Which seems to be common among fags.)
Your extention, while maybe valid, bears no impact on what I said 
originally...that shoving something up the anal canal sounds sickeningly

gay...to me.

shops.  Besides - a wrap-around torque chain has /always/ been a viable
means of ensuring that a broken mount will not cause you to twist

keep up but sometimes I can't help but feel "inadequate". I found 
myself wishing (at the Furry Party) that I'd stayed in college. But it 
was impossible for me to continue my Ed. due to funds. I will always 
regret this..... and I will always feel "inadequate" among others who 
are more intelligent than I.

I am afraid of bigots, TS. They scare the hell out of me. Because they 
are so blinded by whatever drives them to hate so completely another 
human being, I don't trust them. Bigotry really scares me. It brings 
vision of the KKK and burning crosses. It brings memories of cops 
wailing on long haired college students. It makes me remember a young 
guy who was my friend lying in a pool of his own blood because he dared
to date a white girl, and he was black. Yeah, I'm afraid of bigots.

TS: Ah, bingo! Now do you see how I feel? 
 
No. And I never will. Sticking a light bulb up yourself can hardly 
compare to pleasurable sexual perversion. Of course, I guess, one person
pleasure, might be another person's nightmare. 
 
I guess as long as the light bulb isn't plugged into the wall socket,

Well, maybe not...but at least she did have the proper response, even if

For those of you out there who consider yourselves to be behaviorists,
take heed: An organism's responses to its environment do not always give
an accurate indication of that organism's mental state. Here we have a
behavior (saying the New Kids concert "sucked") which would normally
indicate at least a moderate amount of intellectual development in the
test subject, yet in this case it does not ncessarily indicate such
development.
 
That's not rude, is it?

Yeah, but you have to bear in mind that quite often the people chatting
on Terran Trace are (a) very young and (b) not always terribly profound,
so some of the limitations with chat mode may be more because of the
people doing it than with the medium itself. I'm sure a phone conver-

>Did you read my post on people who don't care?
 
The nature of disease is such that a communicable disease will *never*
confine itself to one part of a population. Even if everyone on the
planet had the same attitude you do toward gays, AIDS would not be con-
fined to the gay community, simply because the pattern of disease spread
in a given population doesn't work that way. You will always get trans-
ferrance through non-sexual means, transferrance from bisexuals to
people who do not know their partner is bisexual (and there's no way
you will ever convince me that anyone can know with 100% certainty any-
thng about his or her partner's past if that person is willing to lie
about that past)...and in any event there is no evidence that AIDS
even /started out/ in the gay community to begin with; only that it
initially spread most quickly in the gay and Hispanic community.
Referring to AIDS as a gay disease, or even as a "primarily gay"
disease, is ludicrous, just as referring to syphillus as a "black
disease" is absurd even though outbreaks are most common in areas with
a large population concentration of blacks. It flies in the face of
everything we currrently know about disease epidemology.

That would be a very good argument except for one flaw: there is a
difference between being against Characteristic X and being against
people with Characteristic X. The fact that Saavik and I will continue
to associate with bigots indicates a difference of kind with people
who will not associate with people who are gay. QED. [As The

In case you hadn't noticed, I am "against" homosexuality in the sense
that the thought of buggering some guy turns my stomach and I'd
rather be trampled to death by water buffalo than find myseld
in bed with some other male. I am not, however, "against" gays (or
against bigots); I am, therefore, not a homophobe...or a "bigotphobe."
