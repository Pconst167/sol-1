Sorry...old movies weren't shot in Cinemascope, sure, but they weren't
ever shot to the same proportions of a television screen, either.
The screen ratio of old films is still considerably wider than a TV,
and letterboxing is still a good idea if you want to see the entire
picture. (I don't think I could stand to watch a videotape of, say,
Fantasia, unless it was letterboxed...)

The screen ratio for movie screens was always slightly higher than that
of television (TV has a ratio of 1.2:1, I think, and conventional movies
had one of around 1.25 or 1.3:1.  Letterboxing would help movies such as
"Snow White", too.  "Peter Pan" and "Bambi" were both made in the 50's
if I'm not mistaken, which means they had already gone to the modern
screen ratio.  In fact, Walt Disney made all of their animated movies in
Cinemascope when the process became available, and before that, did a
lot of work on 70mm film -- both of which widen the width-to-height
ratio considerably.

Evidently, you don't know how Disney movies were originally made. (grin)
Some of them used a 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  The rest used what was common
at the time, which is still wider than television (which is something
like 1.2:1... I'd hafta look it up and I'm 100 km from my room, so that
would be dificult).  Once cinemascope came out, Disney went with it.
Letterbox would make any of those look MUCH better, but I doubt Disney
(Inc) would do that... the way it is, people will still pay to see their
movies in the theater at re-release for the larger, wider-aspect screen
and big sound.  Arf!

        have been a lot easier for me to make up nametags. (No
        offense, Angel!)
     2. Actually pulverize the rutabega. And actually have the syn-
        chronized jumping contest. And, PLEEEEEZE bring some foxes
        for the juggling foxes.
     3. Bring Bart and me together more for questions; he can chirp
        "yip!" while I whinney "neigh!"

  I can understand taking out California (must destroy those left-wing

but why just Seattle and not the whole state of Washington?  Seems a
wee bit too discriminating for nuclear weapons.  But, a good choice,

No, "letterboxing" is preserving the screen aspect ratio of a movie on
its TV version by putting black bars at the top and bottom of the
screen.  The total image is smaller, but you don't lose the sides like
you do in a normal TV edit.  There are a few companies that produce
letterbox versions of movies on laserdisc (always in Dolby Stereo,
Surround Sound, etc., etc.), although it's extremely uncommon on major
commercial videotape releases -- "The Color Purple" comes to mind as
one, but I can't think of any others offhand.  A Japanese company has
produced letterbox versions of "2001," "Star Wars," "Close Encounters,"
"Blade Runner" and several other sf classics, but they're not widely
available in the US.

The phrase "intelligent women" is a meaningful one, as any well-adjusted

Case in point: the person who used to live next door to me; she is now
23, has a master's degree in psychology and a couple of bachelor's de-
grees in clinical psych and human physiology, and who was in 1985 the
top-ranked amatuer chess player in Florida (she learned to play the game
in 1982). Presumably, this particular individual could be called 
"intelligent" with a fair degree of certainty. Are you still with me?

   Chip introduced me to GO when he was rather new to the game himself;
now that we're both about equally experienced, our games can go either
way depending on our frame of mind.  For the most part, I am more of a
two-player game freak than he is, and will arrive early at GoCon. 
 
   Turtle - How about it (with maybe a little chess)?
            The DEN game will continue very shortly.  Do you need a
             a record of the moves so far?  You may well have thrown
             them out - sorry for the delay.

GoCon, hmmm? I dunno; never played the game myself. (I keep meaning
to talk Chip into teaching me how to play, but I never seem to
have time...) Well, I suppose a gaming get-together is not totally
out of the question, but for the sake of my continued residence here
at Shadowood it should probably be somewhere else. I still have the
board with our Wyvern's Den game set up; so I guess we just pick
up where we left off. I'll have to give this GoCon thing some

I don't know if I necessarily agree with that; I would tend to argue
that a statement is valid or invalid regardless of the language used to
express it, or even the personality of the person making it. And, like
I said before, I refuse to start policing this board because some
people can't watch what they say. If the problem gets to be TOO
serious I may be forced to start editing things that appear here, but
I sincerely doubt things will get that bad. (I don't approve of
gratuitoius swearing, but I also don't approve of censorship, and I tend
to have a certain amount of scorn for those people whose sensibilities
are so delicate that they run screaming in terror whenever they see a
four-letter word on a bumper sticker, or a T-shirt...or a BBS.)

Yes, I know!  Because the number has been disconnected!  I got home at
7:00 today and somebody had been on the BBS about a half-hour before.
I did some fiddling around and tried to call a BBS at around 8:00, and
the line was dead.  While I'm eternally late with my phone bill, the
last one I got said it wasn't due until December 6th.  Nevertheless,
this screws me up in a rather serious way, since I won't have the money
to /pay/ that phone bill until the 6th comes around, unless there is
some cash lying around somewhere I'm not aware of.  I will probably be
stupid and try to pay all of it in full tomorrow, which will cause
problems with other creditors because it screws up the pitiful excuse
for a payment schedule I was working on.  Shit, shit, shit.  This is
all, of course, assuming they did disconnect it around 7:00 pm today,
which seems like a mighty weird time to be doing it -- but I don't see
any alternative explanation, barring a horrendous screwup on	 GTE's
part.
    Oh yes.  The Wyvern's Den is down until further notice.

   Thpt.  I do not have any manuals on the Caro-Kann Offense, because 
no such opening exists.  I can let you borrow a few on the Caro-Kann
Defense, though.  And there is a King's Indian and a Queen's Indian
Defense, but no Red Indian Defense.  And I can teach you any one of 
them.  Hell... you say you want to beat Kasparov?  No problem.  Just
send a check or money order for $139.95 to...
   I'm not egotistical, just great.
 
   (The little horsey moves in an "L" shape, one or two squares horizon-
tally or vertically, and then one or two squares perpendicular to the
original direction of movement.  It should always be the first piece to
come out after the center pawns have advanced, and are best places at 
the squares c3 and f3 for white, c6 and f6 for black, except in some 
variations of the Queen's Gambit and King's Indian Defense where it is 
fatal to develop the king night as white before castling queenside.  Of
course, remember not to capture the QNP with your knight of queen if
castles kingside - it opens a file directly, ripe for a bishop sacrifice
on h3 or h6.  
   Remember:  even the knights are better, since you found me.)
