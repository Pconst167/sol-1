Date & Time: 03/23/90 15:08:26
Message Number  2963

Well, that's true.  ST's are popular business computers in Europe
because they haven't had to compete with IBM as a ubiquitous, almost
mythical marketing force; over there, they're just another computer, and
are usually in the same price range as the Atari and Commodore 16-bit
machines, as the IBM is the "imported" brand there.  A West German
businessman will be a lot more likely to make a decision between, say,
an IBM with WordPerfect 5.0 and Clarion vs. an Amiga with Excellence!
and Superbase II based solely on the price/performance ratio of the
product rather than the "yes, but everbody /else/ uses PC-compatibles"
mentality common over here (which really does seem to be an overriding
consideration with buyers I have talked to).  From an American marketing
standpoint, IBM's are wonderful.  I'm currently working at RightSoft,
the place that makes RightWriter; they're just now making a Macintosh
version of their program.  To them, MS-DOS is a perfect environment: not
because it's technically very good, but because they'll sell truckloads
of their program in it.  That doesn't mean that a RightWriter for the
Amiga would be a worse program, or that the Atari ST isn't fully
capable of running it, too.
    When you said marketing has plenty to do with it, that was my point
exactly.  Your original message implied Atari ST's make lousy business
computers.  This isn't true; the software to make an Atari ST do all the
major "business things" a 286 machine will do is already there.  They
have their Lotus 1-2-3 and dBASE compatible programs, and have at least
one DTP package which "Desktop Publishing" said rivalled PageMaker 3.0.
Businesses don't use Atari ST's because of the image, plain and simple.

Actually, their most popular home computer (such as it is) is a really
bad Apple II clone.  Nevertheless, that's not a terribly convincing
argument in making one want to run out and buy a PC compatible when you
get right down to it, is it?

This one is organized by the social committee where I work but I've

It will most likely be the first Sat. in May. It will be the kind where
you get a bunch of clues in sealed envelopes and numbered. At the start,
you will be given a number, you open that envelope, figure out where the
clue is telling you to go, and you go there. Then you'll find a sign
with another number telling you which envelope to open next (some will 
be phonies to make sure no-one cheats). There will be a help line if
you get lost and a picnic at the last location....get it???

   Burning the flag is about the strongest way one can show one's

still merely a means of expressing one's right to extremely free

You know what fascinates me? Cotton swabs. You know, the little
things that come in neat boxes with the flap at one end that lets
you take the swabs out without spilling them all over if you drop it.
Take the culmination of two hundred years of chemical engineering
and materials research, some nasty black stuff that's pumped at great
labor and expense from miles beneath the earth's crust and shipped
across the world in gigantic sailing vessels, and apply the one to
the other to make the funky blue plastic shaft (a complex hydrocarbon
polymer which doesn't occur naturally anywhere in the known universe,
or in orange groves either.) Then, spend an entire year and a lot of
effort growing cotton plants, so the seed heads can be carefully
harvested, combed, and spun into cotton. Apply tufts of the cotton
to the polymer shaft, package a bunch of these things together, and
sell them. Why? So you can stick them in your ear and throw them
away. Isn't that neat?

Hey, yo, Javelin Head!  Your right about BASIC (note:BASIC, not Basic)
As long as your talking about origins and not destinies.  Todays
BASICs and ForTrans are completely different animals from their arcane
beginnings.  Both are proceduralized and paramitized - thats a new one
on BASIC; And ForTran's actually got primitive (very primitive) string
support!  Overall, however, even full implementations of both of them
lack the real gusto of say "C" to do serious applications programming.
    Pascal is an excellent beginners language, and in experienced
hands has the power to be a full applications language.  I'm referring
specifically to Turbo Pascal 4.0 or later - Borland is after all the
standard in that arena. There's a variable type: "Absolute", which
lets you state the exact memory location of any object (int,array,record
or whatever).  With this it's posible to do very powerful direct memory
programming.  Another high powered ability is Pascals method of handling
strings.  Because the str's len' is held in arraypos[0], very fast str'
opperations can be performed.  Knowing the len of a str' allows the
fastest posible chip level instructions to be used for data movement.
    In final analysis however, "C" is my only choice, for I can write my
own perfectly optimized string library that's len' based if I need that
extra milli-second, and with "C", I usally don't need it

To answer "why do I find myself..." I have to turn the calendar back
about 6 years, to when the MiSeryDOS PC was new.  At that time, the
only other computers in common existence in the under $5000 price range
were the Apple 2's and Vic's, and a somewhat later the Atari 400/800's.
(Those wern't the only ones, but they'll do for the argument).  At the
time, the I-Been-Moved MiSeryDOS PC was a resonable choice for a bus-
iness computer.  The others, just didn't quite have the kick needed.
However, since that time, those machines have dominated the American
market while not evolving at all.  The business world is terrified of
new things, and that has allowed the MiSeryDOS PC itself to stagnate.
If the business world in general new more about computers, I might be
using an ST at work, or I might be using an AST that ran like an ST!

I'll give you a good reason to switch...
	I've been having fun with my new Atari Laser Printer of late,
and I've discovered something about using it... It's incredibly fast,
much faster than the HP Series II I use at work.  Printing fully
formatted pages at work with text and graphics often takes over a minute
per page (not the advertised 8 pages per minute that you only get with
straight ASCII text).  That time costs a great deal of money.
Using the setup I have at home, I get 18 seconds for the first page OF
ANYTHING and 8 TO 9 PAGES PER MINUTE OF ANYTHING after that!

computers to people who are about to bye, I tell them go look at ST's,
Amiga's and Machintosh's, because while I prefer the ST, ther're all
good machines.  The problem is that the insistance that the worst
choice is the best has caused a tremendous stagnation in computer R&D.
Without competition, why make it better?  It was the Machintosh the
caused the AT to be released.  It's Motorola that's causing Intell to
come out with the 286,386,486.  If that compitition had been stronger

I heard a company called Pecan was trying to snap up all of the 
compilers for this variant of Pascal and is actually quite good.  It
defines the entire operating environment including editor, filing system
system utilities etc etc.
I also prefer C, I do wish that some languages that are available were
"full-strength" like their main-frame cousins.  I love Quintus Prolog
on the VAX under VMS and could actually learn to prefer it over anything
else for some applications.  Sighhh - not to be tho we are stuck with

"Best" and "better" are not purely subjective.  A Z80 is better at I/O
than an 8086, no matter /what/ way you look at I/O.  I understand what
you're getting at, but I think you totally missed my point.  A compara-
tive judgement /can/ be made between two different items (in this case,
computers with a specific task--which, by the way, in a way is what you
said in the second message).
 
Taking into account "means" in meaningless and clouds the discussion.
I'd be impressed if you found a task the VIC-20 does better than, say,
and Amiga 500, but even if you could, the Amiga is undoubtedly better
than the VIC-20... as a computer... as an appliance... and for at least
90% of task-speecific examples.  As for means, I know the ON! is a
better machine than an XT clone.  Just because I could afford the XT and
not the ON! does not change the fact the ON! is a better machine.

That "arguement" (which is technically an informal fallacy of logic) is
meaningless.  VHS is by far more popular than ED Beta (video tape), but
that makes the Beta tape no less capable at video recording applications
(in fact, the Beta is better... /far/ better than the VHS is just about
eveery conceivable aspect of A/V recording).  The Atari may well be an

Heh-heh.  The reason, of course, is simple.  I mean, after all, the
Amiga is just an over-glorified C=64.
 
You hit on a point (SFP--self-fulfilling profecy) which so few of those
entranced with the Big Grey comprehend, but the sad fact is that it is
true.  Even at thee outset of the "Blue Revolution" we can see the 
initial effects, and the power of the letters I-B-M.  No one in their
right mind that knew anything about computers thought much of the first
IBM PC... except, perhaps, that it was bad.  And now wee have a world
standard built around this nasty box, intel iAPX86 CPU's (bad to begin
with, but worse strapped into minimum mode as they are in IBM-type
architechtres), and a bad 8-bit DOS.  Scary, huh?

No, no, no.  The original IBM PC was introduced in 1981, not six years
ago.  At the time, the VIC had not been released.  For under $5000, you
could get a TRS-80 Model III, TRS-80 Model 16 (the 68000 Xenix machine),
Apple II, Apple III, Commodore PET, any number of good CP/M machines

the TRS-80 Color Computer, the Exidy Sorcerer, Northstar Horizon,
Cromemco CDOS machines, Altos OS-9 machines, and probably several others
that escape me.  Recall that in 1981, the TRS-80 line was the best-
selling computer on the market, even though it's all but forgotten now.
And back then when people talked about running an application under

any length of time I would die. (I still haven't figured out why so
many people are fascinated with the HP-series laser printers; it seems
to me the biggest arguments in favor of laser printers are their speed
and graphics capabilities, and the HP printers don't have either one
to speak of. Not only don't they "do" PostScript, they aren't even
terribly flexible printers unless you want to buy a whole stack of
font cartridges...and font cartridges for a laser printer always seemed
somewhat silly to me to begin with.)

Weird thing: Borland made (briefly) a Turbo Modula-2 for CP/M, which
they never released for MS-DOS. If you call and ask them about it now,
they will strenuously deny that there ever was a Turbo Modula-2 for
any operating system, ever, despite the fact that there is a GEnie
RoundTable for Turbo Modula-2 programmers and a good deal of Z-System
program development is done in Turbo Modula-2... I wonder if that means
Borland has placed Turbo Modula-2 in the public domain by refusing to
be associated with it. If so, I should find someone who has it ands copy
it.

I will take the liberty of answering your question for Rufus.
 
AP stands for "Advance Placement"; it indicates a high-school course
for which you can get college credit. AP courses involve an Advance
Placement exam at the end of the school year, which is generally
quite rigorous; the exam is graded on a numeric scale from 1 to 5.
People who receive either a 3 or better or a 2 or better, depending on
which college they attend, will receive college credit for the
class; the AP class "transfers" to the college the same way a transfer
credit does.

AP stands for Advanced Placement (or Anal Pain (pain in the butt)).
This means you can take this test at the end of the year, and depending
what you score on it (one to five points), you can earn credits for
college.  Most schools like a 3 or above, and some schools offer more
credits for a higher score.
I hope (fingers crossed, tail knotted) that I get an externship.  It
would be a wonderful learning experience (sounds like the essay I
did!), and fun to boot.
A bit more, APs and Honors courses are weighted, which means you
an A is worth five, a B is worth four, etc.  Some schools look at this,
but most of them have their own weighting system.  I'm looking for the
system that says "We'll ignore the D average in Spanish."

When I looked at the computer market back then, contrary to popular

there were fewer people using computers back then, and MS-DOS was
already very popular when Atari and Commodore made their serious
computer pushes.
 
Also, as I recall, IBM was almost _instantly_ supported with the release
of their PC. Perhaps all the computer had going for it was marketing,

All of the support IBM had for their computer originally was CP/M ports,
plain and simple.  If you couldn't find support for CP/M machines back
in 1982 you weren't looking very hard; I've seen CP/M software catalogs
from back then that were well over 400 pages.  Most of the major
business programs that are still either in use under the same name or
changed names (such as Multiplan into Excel, when they switched it to a
GUI) came from CP/M--WordStar, dBASE, Condor, Grammatik, Turbo Pascal,
Vedit Plus, up to the first microcomputer DTP packages back when they
were just called page formatters, such as TeX and Magic Series.  TBBS
and RBBS both started in CP/M.  Almost all the languages, ranging from
C and Pascal to Forth, Algol and even Ada, have CP/M incarnations.
There are multiuser versions of CP/M, and LAN operating software for
CP/M.  And, even now--when the operating system is supposed to have
been dead for years and years--there is /growing/ shareware support,
and a lot of those "big name" packages are still available, albeit
quietly.

I've also seen benchmarks between a Model 4 and an Everex 286/16, and

as anti-IBM as Turtle is (admittedly, it'd be real hard to be any more
anti-IBM than Turtle is) but I have yet to see ANY "superiority" of the
IBM architecture over the 4's other than the obvious advantages of
having a 16-bit CPU in the 286/386 platforms... and I'm not really all

I recall reading somewhere that it costs about $100,000 to raise an
infant from birth to the time when he or she gets his/her first job
and starts generating income, adjusted for inflation, of course. Since
most families that have children have two of 'em, that's about $200,000.
Figure with that money you can raise a kid or sock it away for a

The Wyvern's Den has been abruptly disconnected due to a profound lack
of GTE payment.  Luckily, my total bill ($170 spread over three months,
$53 of which is a mysterious installation fee that's been following me
around for seven months or so), in addition to the $18 reconnect fee, is
not only more than I have, it's more than I'm likely to get in the near
future now that my job at RightSoft has also come to an abrupt end.  So,
while I do plan to put the board back up, it is quite likely to be down
for several weeks.
    Please spread this message to other local BBS's!  I will still be
calling other boards (hopefully) from Turtle's but don't know how
often it will be possible.
    If anyone is working at a place that needs help, please let me know.
I have given up looking for jobs that require higher qualifications than
opposable thumbs, but I am still trying to avoid going back to a fast
food establishment unless there is no other alternative.

merely responnding to your post about getting the silent treatment from 
your boyfriend.  Barb disliked my comment about it sounding like here,
and attacked.  What clarification is needed?  Oh, never mind, I see that
you called shortly after midnight.  Or would such things matter to a
lady who goes by 'black magic' and 'The Lady in Black' Oh, well I am
rambling.  Perhaps should remember to call after sunset from now on.

Eeek, don't remind me about that school project.  And it's "Aardvarks
in Bondage."  Aardvarks (a.k.a. ant-eaters) are cute and furry, and
have long tongues (popular with other aardvarks).  Armadillos have
hard shells (which isn't always bad), a rat-like tail (which isn't
always bad), and often get hit by cars or trucks (which /is/ very bad).
Anyways, the story will have to wait for some while, but one day, maybe,
you'll see it.

Thank you for the offer.  While normally I refuse donations, I suppose
I'm beginning to get desperate.  However, I'm going to work on getting
some sort of job by the end of the week more permanent than Kelly
Services--if nothing else, a part time evening burger-flipping deal that
leaves my days open for the few times when Kelly comes up with something
for me.  If I can't get something quick, the BBS will probably be down
for an extended period of time, as I have a sneaky suspicion GTE will
require a security deposit from me before they reconnect things, and I'd
rather not take a donation until I'm sure the board will be back up in
some reasonable amount of time.  But, thanks again.

I think you're the first person I have ever heard refer to bondage as
"cute." There is a big list of adjectives I normally associate with
bondage, but blast if I can find "cute" on it anywhere. "Cute" makes
me think "Smurf," and frankly it's hard for me to juxtapose the
concept of "Smurf" with the concept of "bondage"...although I suppose
it might be possible...

"And there is a catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down
into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invis-
ible in the sunny places.  And even if he forever flies within the gorge
, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the
mountain eagle is still higher than the other birds upon the plain, even
though they soar."

"The World" is a hard concept to grasp. I saw Bob Seger last on
March 11, 1981 at Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, NC (about 18,500
in attendance). It was the last concert I went to before I moved down
here.

If you have ever felt this, then in some way we DO know each other
from the REAL WORLD....and I am a Seger fanatic (also Lynyrd Skynyrd,
Little Feat, George Thorogood and the Destroyers and many more.....
really like good ol' Southern Rock 'n Roll (sometimes south Detroit)).

Actually, there are two buttons which you need to press to get her
started [new safety feature, seems the last model would start on its
own and wreak havoc on the townfolk].
You have to jab your index fingers into her sides about 2 inches under
her rib cage.  You know she's started when her torso stretches about
4-6 inches upwards.  Kinda funny.  She'll also let out a "Yeep....Damn

Hmm. Don't know if I follow that one, actually; if yo let that sort
of thing get out of hand you can quickly end up in some really touchy
areas. Past a certain point, the bondage has ceased to be a simply
enjoyable activity and become a tool for dominance in other (non-sexual)
areas of the relationship, and that type of thing is poison to a
healthy relationship. If you get the point where what goes on in the
bedroom starts determining what goes on outside the bedroom, look out...

Full LOGO (which, by the way, you rarely see outside of mainframe
implementations) is actually a fairly impressive language. It's a
procedural list-processing language (kinda like RLisp on drugs), only
with silly graphics commands. LOGO has all sorts of built-in primitives
for fairly sophisticated string, list, and mathematic functions,
and even defines its own operating environment, kind of like Forth does.
Plus it's got turtles, and anything with turtles has to be worth
/something/...

I have a social life, but I hate it...usually I lay in bed if I'm not 
on the board...talk on the phone (voice)...watch my boyfriend sleep (hey
don't knock it, his eyes roll around and he sighs like a baby)...listen
to Pink Floyd, The Smiths, Sex Pistols, Violent Femmes, The Cure, Cat
Stevens (though he's turned Arab...not that I have anything against Arab
people), and other misc. music...
Aren't you sorry you asked? :>

There is a convalescent center up here that has advertised for data
entry help, and was looking for someone with dBASE experience. I've
asked, and programming ISN'T what they want (I often contact these
ads and talk to them about hiring a consultant, instead).
 
The place is called Mediplex Rehab. Call them at 753-8941.
 
It will NOT help to drop my name (this time), since they don't know
me from anyone else who called them. Good luck.

I saw Seger in Orlando a few years back. It was a memorable concert
in that my then wife decided to join me there at the last minute...
the show wasn't sold out... she bought tickets after the show started...
walked in and right to me (and this was general admission... I could
have been anywhere!).
 
It's a shame we didn't think alike more often.

Now there's a good reason ("just can't do it...").  Methinks MyLady
needs to take a respite from the world - perchance to sit on a beach
at dusk and watch the horizon sink placidly into the sea. I find that
the proper setting helps to get the ol' brain cogitating on the issues
that are hard to face in our lives.  I was married for three years 
longer than necessary because it was easier to face the known pain of
a shitty relationship than the "cold world" by myself - not to mention
I was such a nice person that I didn't want to inflict any emotional
distress on my mate.  Trust me - ain't nobody worth your own peace of
