Hey...congrats on quitting smoking.   I just quit, and I've been smoking
since I was 15 years old.  (I'm 28 now).  I tend to agree with you that 
it might be a psychological addiction.  That is what it was for me.  So 
far, I havent smoked in 5 weeks.  Dropped it cold turkey.  And to date,
I've had no /real/ withdrawal symtoms.  Oh yeah, I've wanted one once
in a while, but not so I *HAD* to have one. Of course I dont know what 
you smoked, but I was somewhat health consious(sp?) the last 10 yrs.
(Kinda a contradiction in terms...health consious and smoking huh)
I used to smoke the fads...Marlboro, Winston, Kool, Salem, but the last 
10 yrs, I've smoked Carlton..the lowest of the low in tar and nicotine.
That probably had something to do with my nicotine dependance..or lack 
of it.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!

Don't worry.  Even if you're being words and obfuscative, I get your
drift.
     
   I was about to argue your points, when I realized something: It 
     
sounds like all we're doing is arguing over the definition of "correct."
You seem to use "correct" and "useful" as synonyms: something is 
"correct" when it can be demonstrated -- even when the demonstration
must have certain limits (including limits of accuracy!)  I tend to
use the word "useful" there.
    
   Of COURSE any "useful" theory is true for only particular contexts,
and of COURSE "useful" is a subjective term.  Newton's laws only work
for particular contexts, and they might not be useful for, say, someone
piloting a spaceship (or just building a T.V.)
   That's the reason I use the term "useful."
     
   Do you have a counterproposal for a term to mean: "Verifiably correct
in all situations; universally provable"?  (Personally, I believe 
any rule like that must be fictional.)  For the time being, I use the
term "correct" for it -- except in mathematics, where I'd use the term
"assumed" or "proven."

   First of all (and you may disagree with this), I classify ethics as
a part of religion.  You might think that religion supplies the power
to ethics ("if you're not nice to your neighbor, you'll go to Hades..."
etc.) and you might point out that there are people with no religion
who act ethically, but I still claim it as a part of religion.  And it
has consequences which are directly observable consequences.
     
   I believe the way one view God can have a very directly observable
consequence on your life.  If you believe there is no God and no 
punishment for sins after life, you will act differently than one who 
believes in both.  If you believe God can be bribed to forget sins,
you will act differently than one who does not believe this.  I say:
if you believe there exists a God, and if you believe God is watching
your life, and if you believe God will take action on you depending on
what you do in your life, you will act differently.  
    
   You're right: a mere belief in the axiom "There is a God" or the
axiom "There is no God" doesn't mean a thing.  Just as there's no branch
of mathematics with just one axiom, there's no religion that believes
only that.  
    
   The next message will address your second point.

   Some religions, including Christian Science, disbelieve in pain.
Some of their members would NOT agree that they perceived pain when
you threw the brick at them.  (Fortunately, I'm not one of them.)
Going on to mathematics, Hamiltonian algebra does NOT agree that 
1 + 2 = 2 + 1.  Only a "shared world view" comprised of assumptions
jointly made by two (or more) people makes it possible to communicate.
     
   If something is not repeatable, does that make it ficticious?
If something isn't verifiable, does that make it ficticious?  I doubt
both of those questions.  (But I also very strongly doubt anyone who
uses those questions as a lazy way out to explain a phenomenon.)
    
   To tie in with the conversation I'm having with Chaz, the belieft
that the universe is real is an extremely useful proposition.  But not
everyone shares it.

"If I were President, I'd..."
   
   be sure to have the best advisors.  (If it were possible, I'd get
George Bush as Sec. of State.  The man knows nothing about internal
affairs, but he knows the world REAL well.  But I'd keep him far from
the military.)
   
   National Debt?  Cut one HELL of a lot of the loopholes from taxes,
and simplify the taxes even more... maybe even just a simple percentage
of what you make.  (Companies get a certain percent; individuals get a
certain percent.)  (With one exception: there must be a lower limit to
who gets taxed.)  The two groups who will grumble and complain the most
are the rich and the accountants.
     
   Erosion of freedoms?  Heh, heh... I'd say that everyone by law, 
everyone must exercise their freedoms at least once a week, or they're
thrown in jail.  More seriously, I had felt that it was the Supreme
Court who had most of the cause of the erosion of freedoms, and that
Congress had been waffling about creating new laws.

Some _very_ good points. I think there's an underlying continuum we're
both referring to, and it relates to the basic question "How to we
'know' something"... so, for instance, we may use the word "useful" or
"correct" or "true" to describe a point on that continuum, but you're
position and mine may be some distance apart. I use "know" or "true"
to describe something such as "the world is (more or less) round",
being aware that some physicist may do some study of alternate
realities to "prove" that the earth is a torus, but in an additional
dimension which we don't directly perceive...and at that point I would
have to say that what I thought I knew, I didn't! Or I may feel that
it is "useful" to believe that the earth is more or less round, etc...
So though I use "useful" much as "true" (or at least as a subset of
"true"), I still may find some items useful/true which you don't.
And so the upshot may well be that as interesting as this discussion
is, it may well lead nowhere! Which is ok, too. After all, I think it
is useful/true that we all are born and we all die and the only 
question is what to do in between, and discussions sure seem "usefule"
to me!! :)

(Ain't it amazing what a simple comment like "Religious discussions,
by their very nature, cannot be 'intelligent' or 'logical'" can lead
off to?)
    
   Now that we have an idea of what we mean by "useful" versus "true,"
(and an idea of what something means to be 'proven'), what about tying
it into religion.  Simply put:
    
   How 'useful' is religion?  (There's no way to show most religions
to be 'true'.)  Do religious people live 'better' than non-religious
people.  (Watch out for that word 'better'...)  And, is one particular
religion more 'useful' than any others?
   
   I'm going to try to keep from preaching at anyone who jumps in on
that topic.  (If I do, PREACH BACK!)

   Thanks.  It was a bit verbose, no?  A simplified version:
   
   You will do whatever actions you believe will make God act better
toward you.
     
   If you don't believe in God, the statement holds (though vacuously.)
If you believe in God, but don't believe actions affect God, the state-
ment still holds.  If you believe actions affect God, you'll do them.
And that is how religion affects the real world.

   Amen!  Although I'd even more rather have marked on the package the
taxes broken down: the net price, PLUS all of the 'hidden' taxes clearly
marked on the package.
     
>3. All bullets must be made of silly putty.
    
   No. Absolutely not.  It would be very easy to smuggle in guns and
ammunition: the police would be at the mercy of the international crime
rings.
     
>4. Universal full, free health care.
    
   How are you going to pay for that?  And how are you going to get
high-quality doctors to go for that?  TANSTAAFL, friend... and there's
no such thing as free health care.  
   The solution to high-costing health care?  Simple.  Why is health
care expensive?  One of the biggest reasons is insurance.  Why is
insurance so expensive?  People can sue doctors for any amount -- and
get it.  Set a limit to the amount people can sue for doctor's mistakes.

I'll be blunt: I'm beginning to get somewhat tired of this discussion.
Yes, you're right: if you believe in God it can have an effect on your
behavior. That is not what I was talking about. The point I was trying
to make is this: You cannot prove or disprove the existance of God.
There are no observable phenomena which go on in the real world which
must be attributable to God. There are no physical, direct consequences
which are a result of the existance or lack thereof of God. Belief in Go
is an act of faith which is quantifiably different from belief in a
mathmatical axiom. If you wish to continue to believe that faith in
God is tatamount to belief that a hammer will fall when dropped or that
one plus one is two, that's fine, but I will point out that if it were
truly that simple there would not be such a widespread lack of consensus
on the issue. So, just to flog this dead horse one more time, I will
say again: There is a quantifiable difference between a logical dis-
cussion and a religious one. The former will always, ALWAYS contain some
leap of faith somewhere that is different in kind from any similar so-
called leap of faith in a non-religious discussion.
 
As to your second point: Religions generally include ethics as part of
their code, but ethics do not derive exclusively from and
do not depend on religion. Ethics can exist without religion. Therefore,
religion is not the source of ethics. Point dismissed.

What, pray tell, does the phrase "smoker's freedoms" mean? Surely
you aren't suggesting that people have the /right/ to smoke...or
even the /right/ to smoke tobacco products only. I don't recall that
being anywhere in the jurisdiction of any of the rights guaranteed
in the Constitution or anywhere else, and it's a certainty that people
don't have the /right/ to smoke non-tobacco substances. The fact that
society condones it does not mean it's a "right." I don't have the
"right" to dump poison into the air through a smaokestack; do you
suggest I have the right to dump poison into the air through a rolled-
up paper tube? If any "freedoms" are at stake here, they're freedoms
connected with the right to privacy, which doesn't extend to public
places (and that argument can easily be applied to a host of drugs
besides tobacco, too...)!

No. The FDA has no jurisdiction whatsoever to regulate tobacco products.
In fact, it is SPECIFICALLY STATED in the FDA's charter that it has no
jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. Regulation is performed
solely by the ATF (the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms).
 
Philip Morris attempted to market their smokeless cigarettes in several

   Dude!  I had just gotten into a discussion with Chaz trying to
define 'true' as 'verifiably correct.'  Because something is NOT
verifiable, that does NOT make it illogical to believe.
    
   We've gone through this a number of times.  Religious arguments ARE
'logical' -- you have assumptions, and conclusions derived from the
assumptions.  Whether or not the assumptions are reasonable is another
question entirely.
     
   Not once have I ever said that religion was verifiable.  I have 
stated that religion does make a difference in people's lives.  I have
stated that it is not a contradiction to believe in God.  However, I
have not said (except in jest) that anyone knows undeniably that God
exists.

Heheh....I think we can keep from preaching, and keep the "preachers"
out of this discussion. One way I see the problem of using "useful", may
well be it's non-absoluteness (yes, I know I argued its opposite 
before! So what!?)...what is useful to someone or to some group, may
NOT be useful to others. The German Nazi movement was useful to many
(I say this as a partly Jewish person who lost 10 2nd cousins in WWII) -
trains ran on time, employment up, most Germans becoming well-focused
on working together. It was certainly NOT useful to Jews, Catholics,
Blacks, and later Allied Forces. Some medications are useful to some
patients and deadly to others. Re religion, it _appears_ to be useful
to some (perhaps many), but my feeling is that the further from "truth"
one gets, the less useful in the intermediate to long run the idea,
perception, belief becomes (to humanity in general). What
blows me away is that some people still believe that religions "prove"
supernatural events occur. A friend believes the universe began in
4004 BC. No use telling him about how dates are figured; he just says
that "God set it up" to make it _look_ like the earth and universe are

that we're dealing with those really weird creatures, human beings.
They DON'T always act as their beliefs indicate they should! There
are MANY God-believers who believe their actions affect God - and

Re health care, gotta say you're wrong. First of all, the costs of
health care are NOT determined (well, less than 5%) by lawsuits.
That accounts for an insignificant costs. And "good" doctors should
be determined by ensuring good medical schools who will only graduate
those who demonstrate appropriate competence. Look at Canada, England,
many other countries: not that they don't have funding problems for
health care, but the free health care system works! The real reason
for escalating health care costs is the costs of modern diagnoses and
treatment. NMR's are outrageously expensive. Brand name medications
are incredible: I needed an antibiotic (available for at least the
last 10 years), which costs $150 a month!! And no generic!! Therefore
no competition!! My bro is a bigshot hospital finance person - I'll
talk some more with him re costs (tho of course hospital health care
is only one facet of it). BTW and only slightly related, have you ever
wondered why health insurance almost invariably covers dental checkups
but NEVER medical checkups?? Wouldn't one think that they would help
keep longrange medical costs down by catching disease earlier??
 
If there were free health care, where would the "good" doctors go? Maybe
some would go into research, a couple, perhaps, overseas (but they
don't want to leave this country any more than you or I, even when we
disagree with a variety of political/social trends).... We know that
private practice of professionals is just as much based on greed as
private industry - and I for one don't think medicine should be.

   Hold it right there.  In his world, he has a reasonably complete,
non-contradictory system.  (I'll WAGER that if I hadn't thrown in this
parenthetical aside, Turtle would jumpin to this discussion, demanding
that I prove creationism to be true, that I explain the dinosaurs within
the system, and that I counter-explain every scientific detail that
points to a much older universe.  All I say to that: God made it that
way.)
   What are the faults with it?  Unlike with evolutionism, one cannot
make any predictions about the future.  Creationism says that at one
point, God created the universe very close to the way things are today.
On the other hand, evolution can make a prediction: that creatures will
grow better at survival with time.  (Note: there is a school of thought
which says that God set the wheels of life in motion, some unspecified
time ago, and is now using evolution.  This theory makes the same
predictions as evolutionism...)
     
   Anyway, what does this have to do with our subject: "Is religion
'useful'?"  Simple: religion can hurt and help scientific development.
    
   How can it help scientific development?  All science assumes the
universe has an order; that experiments are repeatable; and that there
are a finite number of laws which if discovered would explain 
everything.  These assumptions actually came out of Christian ideas
(although, as Turtle will invariably point out, they can exist 
independently of religion.)

   That's another topic entirely.  I've never heard a convincing proof
that supernatural events DON'T occur.  (Continued next message.)

   Yes, I'm skeptical of anyone who makes claims of supernatural 
events; but I don't utterly rule them out.  I'll do my best to debunk
anyone who claims, say, ESP -- but not because I don't believe it could
happen.  I'd do it because the vast majority of people who have claimed
something like that have been fakes.
     
   Oh yes -- about the German Nazi movement.  I remember in my World
History course that Naziism actually helped Germany from its depression,
but Fascism actually hurt Italy.  Mussolini made things look better:
the trains were on time for the only part of Italian history.  But it
didn't improve the GNP.

Nope!  They simply believe God can be bribed, later... by really
LOOKING repentant at Church on Sunday.  Or, they think that God's
not really looking -- or that God will just allow them this "one
time."  
     
   Sure, there's a large number of hypocrites in Christianity.  But
they also figure they have (or will have) a fire escape.

My comments:
   
   I'm somewhat out of my league, here.  But I'd really like to talk
with some doctors, and ask them what their biggest expenses are...
then see what can be done about cutting costs, BEFORE a 'national
health care' would be set up.  Making it nationalized will NEVER
solve the problem of the expenses of health care; all it will do is
make it much more difficult for there to be any real reform.
     
   Again, I'd like to know if Canada and England really have no problems
paying for the national health care.  Remembering that they have a
MUCH reduced militia (even on a per person basis), I remember that
England has a much higher tax rate than we do.  (Even after the reforms
of Maggie Thatcher.)
    
   You came up with one of the problems with the cost of medicine: no
competition!  When it's something as important as your life, there MUST
be competition between companies.  
     
   By the way, speak for yourself when you say you don't want to leave
the country.  I HAVE lived in other countries, and have no intentions
of staying in this country the rest of my life.  My Spanish is good, and
I'm learning German... that opens up much of Europe and South America
for any business.

How do you get Cockatiels to mate????? Well, heh heh... it's kind of 
like this... you get two cockatiels (of obvious sex, of course) and put
them in a cage together with a breeding box attached. You introduce them
to each other.... Mr. Bird meet Mrs. Bird and visa versa,... if they lik
(that's like) each other, they'll do the rest. Once in a while, the two 
birds simply will want nothing to do with each other, but most of the 
time, they are more than happy to cooperate. 
 
When the babies are about 2 to 2 	1/2 weeks old (little fuzzy bald heade

At about three weeks old.... they turn into these creatures that look

I mean, my 7 year old hears these songs, then starts singing them....,

even know what they mean.... and when he DOES find out... then it's this
big giggle session and he'll do it just to annoy me.... "Opps, Mom. I

My 3 year old sings constantly..... and she makes up the words, but some
of those songs...... she'll sing the tune and hit a word like fuck and

An example of that would be a parent saying something like "you'll never

   Okay:  If you were President, would you try to get a law passed that
forbids "children" from listening to "certain types of music"?  And, if
so, what would determine whether or not a child could listen to the
music?  Merely containing certain words?  Describing certain concepts?
(Just curious: What concepts?  If all you said was "sex," would an 
child be allowed to listen to an extremely graphic song about a multiple

   Where?  I see only intelligent Vulcans around here.
   
   It's been mostly a debate about words, and semantics.  The three
words debated have been "logical,"  "true" (sometimes "correct"), and
"useful."  I've been defining the words in this way:
    
   Logical:  Applying logic to a set of assumptions.  It makes NO 
      difference how reasonable the assumptions are, so long as
      good logic has been applied.  My example:
    
      All Armadilloes are Green.
      God is an Armadillo.
    -------------------------------
      God is Green.
    
      This is a perfectly logical sequence, although I'd be hard pressed
      to find anyone who either believes the assumptions or the
      conclusion.
    
   True (or "correct"):  Able to be verified.  It's a true statement 
      that my shirt is blue, because I can verify it.  It's not a true
      statement that, say, a pink elephant exists.  That does NOT mean
      the same as "there does not exist a pink elephant," though -- it
      just means that it has not been verified that a pink elephant
      exists.
     
   Useful:  An assumption which, though it may not be verifiable -- and,
      indeed, might be wrong -- still explains a portion of reality.
      For example, a useful assumption would be: Water boils at 100 
      degrees Centigrade.  It's true, here in Florida, but not in 
      Denver.

   Now, I expect both Turtle and Chaz to jump over me when I write
how I've seen their opinions:
    
   Turtle jumped into the middle of the discussion with the quote:
"That's why religious discussions are not logical."  (I.E. They're not
verifiable, therefore they're not logical.)  All I've been saying is
that a religious discussion CAN be logical (i.e. it can have logic
being applied to it), but the assumptions might not be verifiable.
    
   Chaz and I have been hammering out our differences of definition.
He (and Turtle, I might add) seem to think "logical" means the same
thing as "true."  In other words,  something isn't "logical" according
to him, if the assumptions aren't verifiable.
    
    (One thing that surprises me:  No one has tried to jump on me for
saying that something wouldn't be "true" if it's not verifiable.  Praise
Occam for that!)
    
--------------------------------
    
   There's another discussion with Turtle that seems to have petered 
out.  It was (at one point) about different moral viewpoints.

No, religious arguments borrow the techniques of logic and put their
statements into logical terms. That's not the same thing as saying
they're logical. Any argument that can be phrased as a syllogism is
not necessarily 'logical' because of it.

   Fine, Turtle.  PROVE, or in some way, VERIFY that the world is
more than six thousand years old.  Indeed, PROVE, or in some way, 
VERIFY that the world is more than five minutes old.  Dude, you do
NOT listen to my definitions.  A Creationist's stance is non-
contradictory, but it DOES make some strange assumptions.  (I.E.
That God made the universe "old," and created bones of creatures which
never really existed, colloquially called the dinosaurs.)
    
    It is VERY possible for neither a statement nor its negation to
be VERIFIABLE.  And I have stated at least three times that I equate
truth with verifiability.  
     
   
    Even still, I apologize.  You're right:  the ideas of experimental
science did come from Greek thought, and were appropriated by 
Christianity.  Or at least two of them did: that the universe has an
order, and that a finite number of laws will explain everything.  The
repeatability of experiments I'm not so sure of -- most Greek
intellectuals were more interested in experiments of the mind than 
of the physical realm.

Random House New English Dictionary:
Logic (log'-ik), n. The science that investigates the principles
governing correct or reliable inference.
 
If you start with a premiss that cannot be shown to be correct or
reliable, a premiss that you believe simply because you want to believe
it or you think you will go to Hell if you don't believe it or your
parents told you to believe it when you were very young, then what
you have may be phrased like logic but it ain't logic. It's "I believe
this because I want to." That's not the same thing.

Yeah, and it's been a ridiculous statement all three times. A statement
is true if it describes a real phenomenon or event or condition, not if
some highly evolved monkeys can /prove/ that it describes reality. The
statement 'The world is essentially spherical, rather than flat' is
true now and it was true two thousand years ago when nobody could prove
it, and it was true when there weren't any sapient beings around /to/
priove it. (Or would you suggest that that statement has only just
recently become true?) The universe exists in a particular way and
behaves in a particular way, and it doesn't give a damn whether or not
some BBS user in Sarasota, Florida can demonstrate to the satisfaction
of his peers that it behaves that way. Once again: If the world was not
created six thousand years ago, and you believe that it was, the thing
which you believe is not true. Since you seem to be making up
defintions that suit your argument wherever it's convenient, though,
I will once again turn to the Random House dictionary and tell you
what it has to say about truth: "True or actual state of a matter; state
or character of being true; actuality or actual existance." Of the
word "True," it says, "In accordance with or not contrary to fact;
being really such; authentic." Damn, I do believe that means statements
about the world's age or the existance of God or the like can be true
or not true /by DEFINITION/ without regard to your ability to /prove/ it.

I'm a fanatical fan of his. Have a book at home that is the "Pre-history
f the FarSide" and it even has a lot of his work that was originally
turned down to be published. He's quite an animal fancier. Travels to
Africa and all kinds of zoos and stuff to research his work. Even
occasionall investigates things stuck to the bottoms of his shoes. 
According to the book some scientist/fan of his even named a type
of myte after him..."*******  garylarsonus"....for real!!!

I would rather think of some of us as Mental Body Builders. Just
go to the beach and flex that large, gray muscle. 
   "Heeeey babe. How 'bout me doing some trig calculations for you.
    See that whimp...I'll go kick pi in his face...hehe"
Anyway, I don't think verbal abuse takes much gray matter, just a 
loud mouth and a stripped clutch for a brain. I guess at some time 
or another we're all guilty of that....gulp!

Verbal abuse can be found anywhere... and usually is. Look at all 
the mental abuse in the workplace.... in the schools..... (sigh) in 
the world. 
"You'll never amount to anything worthwhile." That's gotta be the 
worst thing that /anyone/ can say to /anyone/... but hearing it year 
after year as a child... god, it's got to destroy the last shred of 
esteem in a child. And certain children are more sensitive to this 
than others.... 
But ya know, there's all kinds of abuse.... there's outright neglect... 
ignoring a child can do as much damage as verbal abuse to his/her self
image.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a debate that'll never be lost or won. Because 
it all falls back to a dirty word called censorship. No, I don't want
my children listening to songs with graphic lyrics of any kind, but 
would I support a ban against that music.... No... because I think 
censorship can be abused too easily. One mans poison is anothers ...you
get the point... 
If you allow one group of people to decide whats acceptable in music, 
then they;ll sooner or later be dictating in other areas.... 
it'll snowball...... always does. I certainly think they should put 
some kind of rating label on certain music, just like they do movies. 
And perhaps they could restrict what ages can buy certain music... I kno
kids could work around that just like they do the cigarettes and beer 
laws but it could help that parent who doesn't know any better. Like 
the kids ask for Two Live Crew and they go out and buy it, not realizing
what's on the tape.

look at some of these kids on candid camera. True this is to be a

The things that are withheld from kids, including curse words, graphic

. By that I mean that parents, and special interest groups have made the

Allese things that are witheld amount to nothing but what exists, but
isn't acceptable in open conversation or acts. 
 
Granted, in time the children will learn of sex, etc. but there are also
things that will remain taboo for their lifetime as they have in ours.

CD> Republicans ... What they did to the country is what bugs me:
 
Well hell Charlie - I'm one of those weirdos that believe the whole
damned system is about due for an overhaul.  Too bad alternate parties
have such a hard time breaking ground.  What I find intrinsically 
stupid about people (not referring to you personally I should qualify)
is that they will vote a line without ever once considering the actual 
issues.  Example: most southerners vote democrat even though the party
espouses a line that is in direct opposition to what promted the war
between the states (state rights, strong state governments, a true
republic structure etc).  How'd this come to be?  Well what the democrat
party used to be resembles the Republicans of today and vice versa with
an emphasis on the vice.  I seem to recall the Whigs had something to do
with it.  Anyway - the system stinks right now.  The demos want more 
social programs and spending which costs money (read taxes) and the 
repblicans want less social programs but more industry aid (read
pork barrel politics and favoritism).  Bah!  Fire 'em all.  Problem 
with government is people.  They ain't happy just running the country
and providing for the welfare of the citizenry.  They have to play 
power games.  I'm all for the Sci-Fi writer that had the system whereby
the people in power were te ones who least wanted it.  Or has anyone
read the book by Piers Anthony - Triple Detente'?  Theory being if
you let your enemies rule your country they will be hindered in their
government by the realization that *you* are ruling their country.

Real chocolate should be hard, not plastic or soft; should break
cleanly; and should be an even dark color. The taste should be
sharply defined, sweet and slightly bitter, with no trace of a sugary
or milky taste and no aftertaste at all. The sick joke Hershey's has
perpertrated on the American public under the misnomer of "chocolate"
ought to be a crime.

>I certainly think they should put some kind of rating label on certain
>music...
 
Well, getting that to work would be very difficult. The agency that
rates movies is voluntary and industry-wide; producers don't have to
submit their films to be rated if they don't want to, and in any event
setting up an organization like the CARA in the music industry would be
very, very difficult. Prohibiting people under a certain age from buying
certain albums simply wouldn't work. It would be intellectually danger-
ous, as it would make producors unwilling to produce or distribute music
that might not be easily marketable (and what would such a law be based
on? Sexual content? imagery? certain words?). It would be an essentially
unenforcable law. It would not serve society in any clearly-defined way.
It would not serve the function of keeping objectionable albums out of
circulation--do you /really/ think 2Live Crew's last album would have
been so popular if nobody had attempted to censor it? No chance. And
would you seriously suggest that the record store clerk who sells Jimmy
a copy of a naughty album and thereby breaks the law should be jailed?
Finally,. it'd have the same problem laws based on movie ratings do:
they would certainly be struck down on an appeal. A fact few people are
aware of is that it is /not/ legal to pass a law that makes reference
to the Motion Picture Association's ratings, because those ratings are
(a) voluntarily and (b) given by an organizationm that is not a legal
entity and has no legal oversight. Finally, of course, it's just good
old-fashioned censorship, which is morally wrong.

he'd giggle like crazy at all the "bad words" he could recognize, then
he'd hum the songs to see if I knew what they were, then he'd sing them 
leaving out the words.... and sooner or later, he'd start slipping the 
words in.... you know, he's almost eight... and it's his job in life to

Oh, there are still plenty of people out there who take advantage and 
abuse Workman's comp by exaggerating an injury... but more than not, 
an employee gets screwed because he suffered in silence.

I know you can't shelter your child from the world and all it's evils...
.... but it's just that at certain ages, children get so damned 
independant... anything that ticks you off, they like... and those damne
Rap songs with the nasty lyrics seem to be the trick. 
God, I sound like a parent in the 50's screaming about the evils of 
rock n roll.

Heh. Too true about CNN.... During the Persian Gulf Crisis, however, 
CNN was on my TV 24 hours a day.... but since then, it's on for about 
an hour.... yeah, that's about how long it takes before they start 
repeating themselves.

T> (Telling the facts of life about labels on records) 
 
Well, it was an idea anyway...... I guess there is no solution. You 
made a good point about the labels.... they /would/ make them appeal 
all the more to the kids who /couldn't/ buy them. (sigh)

I'm not really fond of our local library.  They waste money on these
really neat moving magazine shelves that don't save all that much space.
Their new computer system bites moose dung, and they need to go after 
the people with books that are a year late.  I'd be more than happy to
form a force to go door to door beating up those people with books that
are a year late.
"Sarah Conner?"
"Yes."
"You have an overdue library book.  Prepare to die."
BLAM!
 
Sticking it in Maas would give them more space, more parking, easier
access, and people would probably spend time in the downtown area.

    Hello.  This is going to be a short letter, for I only have but a
few things to say.  I am going to be leaving for California on this 
coming friday.  I want to say goodbye to all of the people that I cannot
say goodbye to in person.  So, to all of you that will not be able to 
see me off, I want to say goodbye to you all.  I will call HERE whenever
I can, and I will write to those of you that would like to speak with 
me.  Although it would be really cool if Turtle got more than one line 
on this thing so that two people can talk to each other at once.  So, I
will speak with some of you later on.  C-Ya, all! :)

  Not in the slightest f*cking way could one of those d*mn songs
ever get me to cuss. No d*mn way, you must be outta your *ss. Oh,
I see what you mean, I agree with ya also. It does happen. Kids hear
the words in the song, sing the song to themselves, hear others
singing out loud and wammo....
