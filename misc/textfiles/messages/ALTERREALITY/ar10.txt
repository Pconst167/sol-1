I have never been one to "force" my beliefs down the throats of others.
However, if I witness a homicide in progress, I will do what I can to
prevent it - and until someone convinces me otherwise I consider
abortion murder.  I dont believe in sitting around bitching about the
state of the world around me - I believe that it is my right to do
whatever I want to recreate the world in my image (and it is everyone
else's right to try and stop me if they wish).  Now, I know there ap-
pears to be a contradiction within this message but there really isnt.
I continue in my efforts to change things but I try not to be obnoxious
about it.  And by the way...I may not be willing to adopt every unwant-
ed child on the planet but I would be willing to provide contraceptives
to any who could not afford or obtain them by themselves.

Dear Chip:
     I'm sorry but I cannot view dismemberment of a living being as a
"necessary evil."  If there were a more humane method of aborting, or
if legislation would place a restriction re: the age of the fetus so 
that dismemberment abortions were prevented, then I might consider
changing my support.
     Don't worry - I have never been one to use abstention as an
arguement for prevention.  It doesn't work on ANY scale.

4096 colors is only 16 levels for each primary color.  The difference
between each level may not be astounding, but it's quite noticeable,
especially the brighter the colors get -- if you take a picture that's
been created with 256 levels per color (a 16 million color palette) and
display it side-by-side on a Mac II and an Amiga, the Mac II one will
have perceptibly smoother shading.  Minor quibbles, to be sure, but the
human eye can distinguish around 2 million distinct hues.

This follows my earlier message re: the killing of dolphins by tuna

   I received a letter today from the president of Van Camp Seafood
(Chicken of the Sea) which was a reply to a letter I had sent him.  In
it he stated the following:
   "...only about 3.5% of our tuna purchases was yellowfin tuna caught
by foreign sources...we strongly believe that a complete cessation of
these purchases would have eliminated any desire of these parties to wor
k with us to further reduce dolphin mortality."
   He also sent me some "information" which he felt I should have which
included the statement: "The purse-seine fishing method...is the only
known technique known which can catch the quantities recquired by the
international canned tuna market."
   After reading this I feel like coughing up a hairball.  But now I
understand...we HAVE to slaughter the dolphins or else we cant have
tuna cassarole on Saturday.

   Not to quibble, but the average human eye can distinguish more like 7
million distinct hues.  Of course, that hardly matters since we rarely
are presented with all 7 million hues at the same time.  Sure, we can 
see them, but we certainly don't need them.  4096 or whatever is plenty
of variety for me, thank you very much.
 
   Anyway, one can't even look at a single object like a sheet of paper
without being exposed to different hues.  Perhaps the eye can distin-
guish them, but if they're all from the same entity, the brain doesn't
bother to say, "HEY!  THESES ARE DIFFERENT COLORS," because it will
confuse itself - even though the different percepted hues are caused
entirely by an uneven light spread or by slightly different inks used
in the same sheet of paper because they ran out when they were halfway
through manufacturing the sheet (surely you must buy that one.)
 
   Of course I don't have the sources handy to back that up, but trust
me - it's true.  If I spent all of my time looking back through every
piece of information I've ever read in order to correctly document my
sources, they I simply wouldn't have the time to grace this board with
my presence.  I also wouldn't be able to stand doing so, because then 
I could not afford to enter these rambling, extremely confused states

To the best of my knowledge, your earlier response is correct, but it
overlooks the fact that we evaluate a picture both conciously and
unconciously. A 16 million color (Sun Graphics Terminal) will "seem" to
be  more realistic than an 8 million color version on the same screen.
You may not be able to distinguish 2 shades when they are put side by
side, but by using the incredible variety available to reproduce shading
and textures, a picture will give an impression of realism.

Donthen recently pointed out that this entire conversation thread is
the equivalent of placing Jerry Falwell and Madeline Murray O'Hare
in the same room together...it generates lots of verbiage, but not
a lot of persuasion. Still, it is kind of interesting to watch.
 
On the topic of sentience: I'd say it's probably pretty obvious that a
zygote is not sentient by any stretch of the imagination. On the other
hand, it's also pretty clear that a 8 1/2-month fetus /is/. At what
point does sentience magically appear? Good question. I'd say on
the outset not before the central nervous system starts forming, and
possibly not for quite some time after that. Before that point, it's
hard to talk about "homicide" when you're discussing abortion; I still
maintain that destruction of an undifferentiated--and non-sentient--
group of cells does not qualify as murder any more than extracting
a tooth is murder.

Why, yes, as a matter of fact, this board /does/ have more to offer
than two files areas. It has over 1700 messages, to start with. As
I'm sure you've probably noticed, there are no games here. There are
almost no files here (it was with reluctance that I put up the
two areas that are here, in fact). That's because it's a /computer
bulletin board/. People call it and post MESSAGES. But wait, it
gets better! They also /read/ messages. Pretty cool, huh? That way, you
see, people can have CONVERSATIONS! And people can exchange messages,
too! It's kind of like...well, it's kind of like a BULLETIN BOARD!
But hey, if I ever decide to stop running a bulletin board and start

   For human purposes, 8 million colors (or shades thereof) is overkill.
We can't distinguish that many, and it makes the monitor a whole hell of

million at the most.

Of course, getting it won't be easy.  If'n you bring it to the next

1) You probably can't distinguish more than 4 million hues anyway, so
   the 16 megacolor display will look no different than the 8 megacolor
   display (in most cases, you can be a ddweeb about it, tho)
2) Does that display even have 8 million pixels?  You can only display
   a number of colors equal to or less than the number of display points
   available, n'est pas?

USPS, eh?  Dude... but that'll cost you $2.40 plus the cost of the
tape itself.  Maybe I should just get you a tape one of these days
(probably through Donthen, Turtle, Rufus, or Chip) and get it back
at somee unspecified time (like, oh, maybe when your district dude
or myself drops off your MSTF app).

   According to the person who was supposed to send the YARF copies to
Bart Fox (this person being Lance Rund), the responsibility for mailing
the suckers out has been shifted over to Jeff Ferris, the publisher of
YARF, who will supposedly be sending a "bundle" of both YARF #0 (the
preview issue) and #1, which has already been printed.

I assume, then, that you're also rabidly opposed to destroying the
integrity of such a classic work of art by, oh, say, transferring it
from 35mm film to videotape, and thus ruining subtle nuances of timing
(and destroying the resolution of the original film) by presenting it
in a media which is presented at 30 frames per second instead of 24
frames per second...or is it all right as long as the person watching
the videotape has had the brightness and contrast controls on his 
television checked, set, and approved by an official member of the
Organization To Enforce Subtle Nuances of Shadow and Light in Early
Film Classics...?? Heaven forfend that some ignorant Philistine
should watch it in black and white and destroy the effect by turning his
contrast down too far!
 
By the way, as long as /you're/ watching a black and white copy of the
film, why all the fuss over what your next-door neighbor might be
watching? Just a question.

As an artist I am offended by the alteration - in any way - of the
vision of another.  I work mostly in pen and ink (usually a black and
white medium) and would hate to think that sometime in the future some
asshole might come along and take his Crayolas and alter my creation
to "improve" its asthetic value (especially if he were to limit himself
to three or four colors!!!).  I should think you would be able to
understand that...but maybe not.

We're not talking alteration of an original work of art here; the
black and white 35mm copies of Citizen Kane are not being attacked by
armies of people with paintbrushes. To extend your analogy a little,
would you start screaming if some asshole took a photocopy of your
work and started filling /that/ in with crayons? The piece as you
created it is still untouched.
 
I'm not especially impressed by colorization of old movies, but I'm not
going to start flaming about it either; if I want to see the original
version of the movie, I can. No problem. So call me a Philistine.
