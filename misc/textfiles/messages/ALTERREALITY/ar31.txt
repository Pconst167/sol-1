Do not use credit cards as such. I use them for id if I have to
I do not suggest that anyone use them. I have read 1984 and
believe that big brother could use the records to make a profile
I did it once to see if it could be done. It can. IU learned more about
a friend than I wanted to know. I feel sorry for him so I am loyal
to him when what he did really turns me off. I am trying to say
that normally I would run with all my might away from a dude who
did what he did but because I know his secrete I will remain loyal.

The only logical response is, "huh?"  If it's a secret and you're really
not intending to talk about it in any depth, then why bring it up?  If
it's something that would normally make you stop associating with the
person why is the fact that you know about it enough to make you keep
associating with him?  Regardless of whether or not the "secret" is
sufficient grounds to stop associating with him, there appears to be a
fundamental contradiction up there somewhere...?

   No, these groups back-up their beliefs by scripture, the same
scripture you use.  If you want a whole new perspective on the Good
Book, next time invite one of the Jehovah Witnesses inside when next
one knocks at your door.  What you term "mainstream" Christian sects
consider them "cults", only because they disagree with the "mainstream"
interpretation of scripture.  And I also question your use of the word
"mainstream".  My own church does not consider the two groups I
mentioned (JWs and Seventh Day Adventists) to be "cults", just two
seperate approaches to God.  But then, again, perhaps you consider
the Episcopal Church to be a cult as well.

The Bible was not written for outsiders.  (Excluding the message of
salvation.)  Taking this into consideration, if you have not been born 
again, as the bible puts it in John 3, "Being born of the water and
of the spirit."  If your spirit has not been born again, you cannot see
the Kingdom of God.  Seeing is understanding.  
  Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the things not seen.
It kinda works like this:  you get a new spirit that has faith toward
God.  And, a new spirit that understands (or sees) God.  
  I don't expect anyone who has not been born again to understand (or
see) God.  
  Let's take truth, for a minute.  I'm glad that you don't just accept
the Bible to be truth based on the fact that it says it's truth.
Truth will prove itself.  Jesus was truth, a a pretty nice guy, too.
You don't have to believe that the bible is truth, to find some helpful
guidelines for life.  (Not to steal, cheat or lie.)

    The Giant's mention of gold definitely caught Angel's interest.
"Ah, I appreciate the fine offer of assistance in outfitting my ship.

my ship is bound by the winds and tides of this place.  I cannot bring

    Angel's speech ended in a strange word that sounded oddly like
"ARGHOUUMPHH!" as she was knocked from her feet by the blast that
destroyed Rufus' briefcase.  "What was that?" she exclaimed as she
struggled to rise from the floor.  She left further questioning to
others as she suddenly noticed her cape was aflame.  Tossing it to the
floor, she started jumping up and down on the burning cloth, in a
rather credible imitation of Turtle at his most agitated.  "Well,
that's 20 credits shot to hell.  Now, what is happening and ... NO!"
     "Hey, Angel, did you know ---" Turtle tried to get her attention,
but her interests lay elsewhere at the moment.
    The ex-harper rushed to the piano in the corner of the bar.
"Angel, you really ought to --" Turtle tried again to no avail.
Passing the Giant, she grabbed the mug of Sliva from his hand and
tossed the drink at the smoking hole in the center of the instrument.
Unfortunately, the potent drink merely burst into flames.  Going back
for the trodden cape, she used it to beat out the fire in the piano.
"Bloody 'ell!  What is it wi' this place and musical instruments.
Wonder if this can be fixed, or if'n I'll need another burial."
     "Angel!"  If nothing else, Turtle was at least persistant.  "Stop
running around Angel.  Did you know you're bleeding?"   Rather
surprised, she glanced down at her left shoulder and was amazed to see
blood swelling from beneath a tear in her garment.
     "Oh, well, now that you mention it ... Nothing to worry about."

him up, roll him in coke and shove him us your ass. Only this guys
mouse chewed his way into the guy's gut (good for the mouse). Now in

Let's see, I don't 'think' (implying opinion) that sex with animals
(assuming consenting animals) is 'normal'. If an adult con's a child
to have sex with them, does that make the child 'consenting'? If not,
is that just your 'opinion'? In any case, I do not 'think' this is
'normal' either (consenting or not). I also don't think that sex with
small appliances is 'normal' either (even consenting appliances). I also
do not think that sex between consenting adults of the same sex is
'normal' (especially males...ooops, nail me for that comment!!!). I'd
just assume stick it in a blender then in an orifice that was meant to
pass human excrement (only). Why???? Well hell, I don't find ANY men
sexually attractive (and a lot of women around aren't too attractive 
either).....tah-dah!!!! My opinion!!!!! I think I'm entitled to
it, and I'm entitled to profess it. Beastiality is NOT WRONG because
I think it is. There are things that are naturally unnatural (or
should I say, unacceptable by human standards). If everyone can do as
they please as long as it doesn;t 'bother' anyone else....you MUST 
define 'bother'.  
  
Oh yeah, If a gay guy is looking at YOU with 'that' look in his eyes

I read your reply, and I agree with you that these unfortunate crimes
do happen in our society....I will correct a couple of facts for you
though, whereas not to misleed or give only a one sided conversation.
It is true that Rape, Incest,Child Abusers,and having sex with animals
DOES happen in the world today that we live in...however your facts make
direction towards Homosexuals, with the feeling and asumption that all
Homosexuals are the ones doing all these crimes....I beg to difer with 
you....if you would like check with the local NAACP and the GALA and
ACLU and Sheriffs Association for "statistics" on rates and race of
a majority of the crimes that you mentioned....I wish I could help you
better understand us as "Homosexuals"..but I can tell from your creative
writting that it would be useless....for that I am sorry.  Some people
in the world today cant grasp the fact that Hetrosexuals, Black Men and 
Women, Teenagers, and YES Homosexuals are all aty fault and should have
fingers pointed to them for the awwwful crimes that they commit.  I am
one who refuses to single out a "classification of ones sexual desires"
to ease my conscience whereas not to have to deal with the real world.
 
I enjoy these comments, and welcome with open arms more...helping

direction as my career for the past eight years.

Just the only honorable course that could be taken, as the information

The social security number is equally revealing, as it links all
education, medical, employment, and credit records under one id number,
but like cc#s this info. is generally misused.  Of late I have thought

   "What the hell--?"  Wezip lets go of Xon's shirt at the sound of
the explosion.
   "Funny, just what I was going to ask you," Xon says crossly.
   "Oh.  Right.  Well, I need to get you to do a favor for me."  The
fox absently watches the tribble pop out from behind where Bongo-
Man threw it.  Cute little whatsit.  It promptly falls onto the floor
and out of sight.
   "Tell me about it in a minute," Xon says, crossing over to where
Rufus is standing.

   "I saw, I saw," Mulligan says in response to Turtle.  He says this
at the same time he's dashing out of his seat and racing for the
door; he gets there and stops, apparently determining that the
assassin is too far away already to be pursuable.  He then heads
back to Rufus, ignoring the reptile.
   "You have any idea why someone would be trying to kill you?"  His
expression is a little skeptical, somehow suggesting that he over-
heard Rufus' explanation of a few moments ago.
---
   "I have these houseguests coming," Wezip mumbles to the air where
Xonzoff had been standing.  Then he thrusts his hands in his pockets,
sighs melodramatically and heads toward Angel and the piano.
    His expression changes to one of dismay when he sees Angel is
bleeding, and the thought of his impending houseguests is temporarily
driven out of mind.  "That doesn't look like 'nothing to worry about,'"
he says reproachfully.  He looks over at the bar as if hoping a
bandage will appear magically; Xonzoff is digging around behind it,
perhaps looking for the fox's theoretical first aid kit.

> I'm not sure, but I THINK you don't believe the Bible to be truth.
 
If you mean that I don't believe it to be the infallible, literal Word
of God, you're absolutely right.  Your comment that the Bible was not
meant for "outsiders" is incomprehensible on the surface, by the way;
if all humans are meant to be saved through Christ, then none of them
should be "outsiders".
 
> If not, what part don't you believe? Maybe I can help.
 
Help with what?  If you mean convincing me that it's the literal word
of God, or even convincing me that a 'supreme being' would incarnate
himself as a human being and allow himself to be killed on the grounds
that doing so would absolve all humanity of their sins if only they
took the leap of faith necessary to accept the premise of this sentence,
then you may have a tough time of it.  My ultimate objection to the
philosophy of Christianity, apart from the practice, is that this just
doesn't make any SENSE philosophically.  (I won't even get into my
objections to the ACTIONS of Christians in the name of their divine
scapegoat.)

That fad is a homosexual variant of one that heterosexual females have
been doing, too.  Yes, it's perverse, but it's equally perverse whether
the person doing it is straight, gay, or bisexual, isn't it?  If
bringing this up is meant to suggest that all homosexuals are 'perverse'
in this fashion because of this fad, then logically all heterosexuals
are perverse because some of them do it, too.  Yes, it's sick.
    My point is, again, that what you describe has a victim -- in this
case, the mouse.  If you take what most people would consider a normal
heterosexual relationship and do not change it in any way other than
flipping the sex of one of the people involved, you haven't made it into
a stinking morass of child molesting, animal-raping human slime.
    At any rate, there is NO EVIDENCE to support that a homosexual or
bisexual individual is more predisposed to molesting children, raping
other individuals, or, yes, sticking small furry animals in body
cavities than a heterosexual one is.  There is, indeed, evidence to
support that homo/bi people are likely to be more promiscuous than
heteros.  I consider this unfortunate at best (and dangerous at worst),
but my moral judgment on the matter comes from the promiscuity, not the
sexual orientation.

This is, in the words of the Specialist, manifest bullshit.  In point of
fact, I didn't say I discriminated against people who discriminate; I
just disagree with them.  I've known the Specialist for about two years
and have known his intense hatred of homosexuality for almost that long;
I don't agree with his opinion, he doesn't agree with mine, but that
doesn't mean we've stopped associating with each other or respecting the
other one's opinion & judgments (even - gasp! - when there's a
disagreement).
    It sounds to me like you think I can't be prejudiced against anyone
else who's prejudiced, because then I would be prejudiced against
myself.  By this logic, I must have to agree with everyone who says
things I don't agree with.  This doesn't work to begin with.  And if you
think I have no grounds for "discriminating" against members of the
American Nazi party or the KKK, you are the one who needs to re-examine
your thinking -- not me.

     "Really, I'm fine.  Don't worry about it."  But Wezip ignored
Angel's remarks.  The fox took the first aid kit that Xon finally
discovered behind the bar.
     "Angel, be quiet, let me take care of you."
     "You don't have to -- Hey, don't! ... Too late."  Angel was
unable to stop Wezip as he took hands to the small tear on her blouse
and ripped it wide open to get a closer look at the wound.  "It's not
just musical instruments, you guys are tough on clothing, too."
Cleaning the blood from the wound, Wezip had to agree that it really
was a minor injury.  There was a gash in the upper arm about three
inches long, but very shallow, with no major blood vessels torn.  No
longer concerned about her safety, he was more disturbed by the action
of the wound.  It seemed as if the wound was repairing itself before
his eyes.  Very slowly, the sides of the open cut seemed to move closer
together, trying to make whole the damage.  Looking up at her face, for
the first time he noticed there was no trace of the cut there that she
had received the night before.
     "I thought you knew no magic," Wezip said.
     "It's not magic.  It's just me.  How do you think I've lived all
these centuries?"
     "All these centuries?" asked Sam.  "Strange, you don't look a day
over one hundred."  Sam seemed undamaged by the explosion, a situation
Angel considered rectifying.  Fortunately for the little ragamuffin,
Wezip stood between Angel and _her_.
     "So, Wezip, you're having visitors?  How nice.  And how many

Really? I find it hard to believe that the sole purpose of the Bible is

I'm fascinated by your assertion that the only way to become convinced
of the authenticity of Christianity is to become a Christian--that is,
to be convinced of the authenticity of Christianity. Unfortunately, I've
heard the line before--"you won't understand until you become one of
us." That's a really popular line of reasoning that's been used to
support a number of rather ghastly institutions. In any event, your
reasoning isn't going to impress anyone who's not a Christian already
(someone who is will, presumably, nod sagely); if there is, in fact, no
way for a non-Christian to believe in the tenants of Christianity, then
it's going to be pretty hard for Christianity to spread, isn't it? It
also has no bearing on the truth of the Christian tenants; to say that
you can only understand them if you believe is rather like saying "only
a believer believes this." Yes, that's true, but I hardly think the
assertion that only one who believes in Christianity can truly under-
stand it is the best argument in favor of Christianity I've ever heard.

I would say that using a living organism as a sex toy, in a process
is likely to kill the organism, is animal abuse, which is immoral
regardless of the sexual orientation of the person performing the act.
It also has nothing whatever to do with the morality of homosexuality.
 
(If you're really interested, I've heard of this practice before. It's
called "gerbiling," and it is /not/ limited to homosexuals. The process
is almost invariably fatal to the animal in question. Yes, I consider
that "sick." What's your point?)

By definition, a non-sapient animal can not give informed consent to
anything. Bestiality is animal abuse.
 
>sex with children (assuming consenting children)...
 
Likewise. A six-year-old is not capable of giving "informed consent"
to something of this nature, and in any event (1) most child molestors
don't ask for permission first and (2) children are not physically
developed to the point where they are capable of sexual behavior. Child
molestation is a particularly savage form of rape.

As long as that's /all/ he did, absolutely nothing. He's not affecting

that it simply wouldn't bother me. On the other hand, I wouldn't /sleep/
with him, either. There is a difference between another person's thought

The religious ceremony that I attended this morning is a mixture
of the Catholic and Episcopalian services. There was a priest doing the

If you do not do the Euchorist(ms) you could obstain. I did and

    Ah, strange and wondrous.  Actually, from what I've read from their

just an opinion that he doesn't like the fact that they are prejudiced. 
You can't really apply the definition anyway, since he isn't judging a 
group that has members that are different. By saying "prejudiced people"

The argument is biased.  It is not fair for any one person to label a 
behavior "normal" or "abnormal"...there are types of behavior that we
choose to accept and types that we choose not to accept...that does not
necessarily make them "right" or "wrong".  I choose to accept homosexual
ity...I've been given no reason not to...it doesn't affect me in any 
negative way...I can go on having a heterosexual relationship without
being offended or bothered by someones' homosexual relationship...it's
simple...it's not my business.  Who am I to tell a gay man that he has 
no right to sleep with another man...should he be allowed to tell me tha
t I am not entitled to sleep with a man?  NO.  It's not his business.
Morality is in the eye of the beholder...you make it what it is...I 
do not approve of rape or incest, but that is for an obvious reason...it
is a forced behavior...We live in America...what happened to freedom of
speech?  What happened to a persons right to privacy?  WE are all so

completely immoral.  Freud would love to see how the chain of messages

Hold on, hooooollldd on - whoa I say!  Lemmee do some more in depth
research - I got kinda sidetracked on some neat stuff in Isaiah but
I'm still trying to find some stuff out about it.  For now - it appears
that you are correct in a couple of respects.  I'm tracking down and
rounding up a few thinks in Luke that seems to agree with what you
maintain with it not being intended as a place of punishment.  There are
a few anomolies that I would like to clear up about references in the OT
where contrary (?) to a staement you made, Sheol is mentioned several
times - HOWEVER - it is rendered as "the grave" for some arcane reason
I am trying to fathom by the translators.  It seems to be one of those
things that the intent is modified by the context and not due to any
desire on the part of the translators to map the text into an existing
theology.  I must say thanks for a rewarding line of research!  
Question: how, if any, would a revelation that God doesn't keep a 
personal torture chamber affect your perceptions?  I really get the
impression that the objection to hell was a sideline to the real issue
of a decided non-belief in a creator.

Huh?  Waitadamminite!  It was quite ok for YOU to assume a passage thru
terra-non-firma.  Assume therefor a black hole or some other mass
that is capable of exerting a gravitational attraction upon the ball.
Assume also a passing trajectory that causes the ball to become entrappe
by the gravitational field.  Air resistance et al has nothing to do 
with a decaying orbit from the rsults of insufficient escape velocity.

I'm not gonna nibble - Episcopals have a lot in common with the RC
church whatever your group wants to call them is fine by me but I will 
stand by my statement.  They in fact ALL purport to have obtained 
"special" revelations that supercede the Bible.  The Mormons even have
their own books that supposedly chronicle the ministry of Jesus here in
the New World - calling the Book of Mormon and the Pearl of Great Price
biblical books is stretching it.  The Seventh Day Adventists assert that
everyone is wrong (pretty stridently I might add) because by George, if
God wanted to worshipped on Sunday He would have said so!  As it is -
your worship is invalid and unrecognized in the eyes of God because it
doesn't fall on His holy day which any idiot knows the Catholic Bishop
whatshisname screwed up when his calculator fritzed during some 
right ascension calculations necessitating some rough figures and he 
slipped by a whole day - the Jews still have it right!
Sorry - these people are guilty of what everyone tries to accuse

they are the true "keepers of the flame".  MAybe its these people that

Maybe I expect (or hope) too hard that people can see apoint that to 
me is obvious (of course! and no - I'm NOT that naive).  Church
history is rampant with persecutions of the early christians.  For 
hundreds of years these people lived in the sewers of Rome for
their beliefs they lived year in and out in an atmosphere that was 
heavy with the possibility of death at the arena or crucifiction.
Think about it... our entire nation hasn't been around as long as 
a SHORT section of these persecutions (which came in waves).
I'm sorry - Hitler's influence lasted not even throught the war as 
silly things like lack of food took their toll on the moral of
the people.  We are talking a faith that sustained generations of
people through unbelievable hardships and in the process still
managed to get converts to the faith.  It is estimated that there
are over 40,000 christian graves in the underground catacombs of
Rome and untold hundreds of thousands were burned alive, crucified
and thrown to the wild beasts.  Even the Roman jailers were awed by the
determination of the christians.  One slave girl was repeatedly raped
and tortured day and night until she died. When asked to turn against
her fellow christians she would only say "We are Christians and do
no evil amongst ourselves."  These people finally won over some of
the emperors and finally the killing ceased.
Can you think of another culture that has not only endured such 
treatment but have overcome in the process?  Only one I know of andf
that is the Jewish people.  Full-Circle.

You've really lost me on this post.  I'm not sure what you're talking
about.  Please define "mainstream" Christianity; from your posts I'm
beginning to think that you define mainstream as any group that shares
your beliefs, and "cult" as any Christian group that doesn't.  If I
am wrong, please enlighten me.
>Maybe its these people that are causing ALL the ruckus and
>sharing the blame?
    Huh?  Really can't follow this one.
Oh, other day couldn't find my dictionary, but have it now.  According
to Webster "cult 1. a system of religious worship or ritual 
2 a) devoted attachment to, or extravagant admiration for, a person, 
principle, etc., esp. when regarded as a fad b) the object of such
attachment.  3. a group of followers; sect"
    General definition does not mention Christianity at all, as your
definition particularly cited.
    Oh, and thanks for informing me that there are many similarities
between the Episcopal Church and the RC church.  Wow!  What a news
flash!  Personally, I like to think of it as "Catholic Lite".  You
get the neat ceremonies, but you don't have to worry about the

Yes, the immediate group to come to mind are the Jews.  But next comes
the followers of Islam, who certainly have overcome in the process.
I, too, am awed at the serenity and faith of the early Christians.
But, the point of this was, you are trying to use the faith as an
arguement about the validity of their beliefs.  The fact that many
have suffered and died and overcome, does not really give credence
to the belief, just to their longevity.  And if you try to use shear
numbers as an arguement ... that won't really work.  Christianity is
not the largest religion practiced on this planet.
    I do see your point ... I just cannot agree with your conclusion.

This is part of the problem with a totally self-contained belief system
of any sort. I'd say that Christianity suffers from the same problem,
although it's not quite so bizzare--or so perfectly defined. A
system such as Christianity (or in fact almost /any/ religion) is
hermetically sealed from the real world--it can neither be proven nor
disproven from without, and if it avoids any gross errors with self-
consistency it can't be disproven from within, either. Of course, I
wonder what value such a system has--when it comes right down to it,
it's not terribly helpful if you're trying to understand the universe
around you. I can fabricate the existance of s divine being with any
characteristics I choose, create a whole detailed theology around this
deity, and as long as I make sure it dovetails with the general
conception, viola! A brand-new religion that absolutely cannot be dis:
proven by any feat of logic whatever.

Well, yes, it was a rather big step to assume that the ball could
pass through the ground--I threw that in because it illustrates more
clearly the path the ball is /trying/ to follow. It wouldn't try to
describe a spiral because the path it's trying to follow is an
ellipse around the planet's center of mass--it'd only start spiralling
if it did, in fact, make it into orbit, in which case what it's
trying to do is assume an elliptical orbit that's closer to the planet's
surface, only before it can make it the planet gets in the way. When you
throw it up, it /starts out/ in a stable orbit--but the planet gets
in the way before it gets very far.

those who were unfortunate enough to admit that they were Buddhist?

  Well, it all depends. I, myself, would pay $30 to see the backlot 
where they filmed "Back to the Future"... unfortunately, that's still 
standing in California, and not here... 
  The rides at Universal aren't big "rides" like rollercoasters, but if 
you're interested in film and such, then it doesn't really matter. When 
I went, the ride part of "Earthquake" was closed, and "Kongfrontation" 
was closed totally. The "Jaws" ride is fun. The "E.T." ride is really
spectacular, and I felt compensated for the two 1/2 hours waiting the 
first day (the next day, we got through in ten minutes, being in front 
of the line)... 
  
  If you're into memorabilia, there is a shop that has authentic items 
valued at hundreds of dollars, pluss they sell just about anything 
related to Universal films you can think of... (the novel from "Back to

     I stand up and look at the remains of my briefcase, which reminds
me of the time my toaster blew up.  From the smoking remains dangling
from the chain around my wrist, I can hear the words "index phagocytic
low" being repeated over and over.  I bash the briefcase on the counter
and it finally stops.
     "Angel, you should really stop running around like that," I say
and add "Uh-oh" as Mulligan walks towards me. He asks me the dreaded
question.  "Why's somebody trying to kill me?  Uh....errr, job hazards,
I guess.  I dunno anyone pissed enough to send a robot after me.  Those
things /are/ expensive, and my death's not worth that much," I respond.
 Mulligan, looking less than happy with my answer, was about to respond
when Turtle walked over, sat down, and promptly met the floor with a
loud crash. 
     Mulligan turns to address the reptile and I slip over to Angel.  I
watch as the wound finishes repairing itself and comment, "Ya know,
that's a pretty neat trick.  Did you happen to mention this on your
insurance application?  You'd get 8% off.  I'm lucky I didn't get
wounded since the briefcase /did/ blow up on me."  I quickly reach
behind my back and feel my left shoulder, or what remains of it.  Damn,
damn, damn.  This is not good.

You are absolutely right (what is the definition of that?)  The word 
normal is not the word I wanted.  It is abnormal only to me, meaning 
that is not a part of what I believe in.  And, what "should be and 
shouldn't be" are only personal opinions, which I can accept the 
opinions of others and I love to disagree, based again on what I think
is normal.  Do you realize how far a conversation could go on just
the definition of normal?  I do stand corrected and yet, still can't
think what word I really wanted to use.  I did check and somebody else
told me that "gerbiling" is an actual practice.  I guess I'm still

Believe it or not - you probably have been oogled by a male homosexual
and never even knew it.  Further, if you are even suspected of being
hetero the chances are slim that he will attempt to contact, talk or
in any way deal with you on any other that a very shallow layer.
Most homosexuals realize that their position and lifestyle are open to
critique and minimum and violent opposition at worst from their fellow
human beings - they have learned to be careful when out of their
"element".
As far as other "deviant" sexual practices.  Women are sexually mature
at various ages between 10 and 15 years of age.  I personally know of
a lady that actively *encourages* her 14 year old daughter to have
boyfriends stay over and share her bed.  She is a very "normal" 14
year old in every way and I can't say that early sexual experience has
hurt her one bit.  Her Mom's rational: I would rather have her under
the roof of a safe house than groping around who the hell knows where
and I would rather have her know about and USE contraceptives than have
a surprise for me someday".
I also knew of a man and his wife that had the same attitude in Calif-
ornia.  His daughter climbed into bed with my roomate and he almost
had a cow "You're only 13!" he hissed!  She left and came back with
her sleepy dad who said " Be picky Mark - but please don't be a prude!".
He was concerned about his daughter feeling rejected and rather approved
of her propensity to take older lovers rather than "rash youths" as he
phrased it.
Now - what narrow little way are YOU going to prescribe as "normal"?
Should a lot of Japanese and Hindu writings and art be burned as 
pornographic because it deals with sex in many forms between consenting
adults?

of people really feel that way.  What is truly meant is that questions
that you may have had on /many/ subjects thru the bible will be made
clearer to you after you are a Christian.  I mean - what are the
references to "gods" in the psalms?  The answer will make more sense to
a Christian - but also you have to study hard and understand a LOT to
get to the root of the matter.  The Bible has many minor plots and

Cults as I tend to use the term are Christian sects that their beliefs
depend on some special revelation and/or dispensation.  I ignore the
fringe groups like Baha'i and the followers of Yogi Rajaneeshjaphur
who advocated sexual freedom and promiscuity in his kingdom that they
were booted out of in Oregon.  There are books published by recognized
Christian publishers, accepted by all faiths as guidelines to these
cults.  I simply would rather refer you to the fact that this is how

Yes, that is absolutely true. I don't think that means that you have
to /be/ a Christian in order to understand them, though; were that the
case, the Bible'd be pretty useless as a method of gaining converts
(or "convincing people of the Truth," if you will). Seems to me that
the direct word of an active and living god would be more universal than
some Christains would think--the pronouncements from On High which are
supposed to be good news to all humankind are not going to be accessable
only to those who already buy into the faith to begin with, now, are
they? A poor revelation indeed /that/ would be! It sounds to me that
this is more of a case of "Once I believe with all my heart then the
mysteries of Christianity go away because I no longer have to think
about them rationally. Pity the poor people who haven't seen the Light
yet and still think rationally about this stuff."

The arguments are certainly there for convincing us that the triune god
is a singular entity, but they're kinda awkward and kludgy. Proof?
Depends on who you ask. A system of faith is not generally subject to
"proof" at all. It all depends on whether or not you're convinced by
the eloquence of the argument.
 
Speaking of which, another quote from the same man got me thinking
last night. Dr. Snyder also said "We follow the Hebrews, who struggle
and struggle and eventually come up with monotheism. Then they turn
around and give it to the Indo-Europeans and what happens? Bang! They
invent the Trinity." The concept of the Trinity seems to be a fairly
recent invention, one that post-dates the branching of Islam from
Judiasm (Muslims consider the Trinity to be the rankest form of
heresy), and it originated in a place whose dominant religion of the
time was Wicca, which has (are you ready for this?) a Trinity of its
own--the three faces of the Goddess (maiden, mother, and crone).
Hmmmmmmmmmm....it wouldn't be the first idea Christianity borrowed
from Wicca...

Simple proximity to the source has never been shown to be of any value
in determining a religion's authenticity--lookit all the various
beliefs wandering around, from Dianetics to the followers of Sun
Moyen Moon (or whatever the hell his name is), and you'll see that.
A highly charismatic individual can get people to do, say, or believe
almost anything--and the fact that you're standing right next to him
doesn't mean you're more likely to decide he's a fake. The fact that
Christianity has managed to survive for as long as it has speaks more,
I think, for its history of...aah, how to say? brutal approach to
gaining acceptance than it does to any intrinsic value; hell, there's
a lotta faiths older than Christianity (Shinto, Wicca, Hinduism, etc,
etc) that are still doing quite nicely, thank you very much.

> California seems to breed some really sick bastards doesnt it?
 
Perhaps, but I suspect no worse so than a lot of big cities in this
country and across Europe.  They just don't have the reputation that
CA does -- most of which is, one suspects, exaggeration.  I know a lot
of people in California, and a lot of them are weird, but
proportionately no more so than people I know in other parts of the
country.  A lot of European countries are a lot more accepting of sexual
behavior "out of the norm" and, it seems, a little less sensitive to the
rights of others (even, as in the sick example at hand, of animals) as
Americans are, perhaps especially Californians.  If CA is more accepting
of behavior that the rest of the country finds "weird," it's probably
for the better, not the worse.  And I suspect very few Californians woul
be tolerant of 'gerbiling' for the reasons a few people on this board
have raised -- it's effectively torturing animals to death.

Homosexuals can be classified as sick by comparison with any other

himself - the note here is that even back then they refer to this entity
as Lord.  The best example of this is where the three visitors come by 
and visit Abraham on the way to destroy Sodom & Gomorrah.  Since we have
testimony that the face of God the Father may not be looked upon, we

is the occasional beatings from rednecks, irate travellers in airports
and the occasional security guard or so.  Followers of some of the low
level cults (like the gurus) are even more casual about dropping their 
mentors with little thought.  Groups like the moonies actually are a 
slightly different case because they practise mind altering techniques
akin to brainwashing techniques developed many years ago.  There is a

 > ...can't seem to get that FACT thru your head.
 
  I got the fact through my head, and I still stand on Turtle's side. 
The whole subject is touchy. I think you've made a great point, but the 
fact that we are not hermaphrodites doesn't mean homosexuality is a 
sickness. I find the point very convincing... but it leaves things open.
By the logic I think you are following, sex is strictly for reproduction
of the species. Following that idea, any sexthat does not produce 
offspring can be equated with homosexuality. This still leaves the idea 
of the "sickness" unproved.

> IT FOLLOWS!  LOGICALLY.
 
  No, the fact that something is done different than intended doesn't 
indicate a sickness.

  Just because someone exhibits an odd behavior doesn't mean they're 
sick. If someone sticks their finger up their nose in public constantly,
I believe that's the fault of the parents for not making sure the child 
didn't do that. It /could/ be a symptom of a sickness, but not always.
 
 > Didn't your mother teach you anything?
 
   Yes, she taught me the way to think the way I do, which has gotten me
pretty far. I also have learned how to take care of myself and be mature

And L. Ron Hubbard created the Word and saw that it was good.  And on
the seventh day he rested in order to tabulate the proceeds...

Thanks for the descriptive journey through Universal.  You didn't notice
if they had piano music in the memorabilia store, did you?  Anyway,
sounds like a place I'd enjoy, darn it!  Why don't I like cheap places?

> Okay, let's not get nasty.
  I wasn't getting nasty.  I said if I was wrong, correct me...and made
sure to end the post with a joke.  How far do I have to go to demon-
strate to yourself (and others) that I am not angry when I disagree.
As far as considering a cult any group that depends on some
"special revelation and dispensation"... that applies to all religions.
Certainly being born-again is "special revelation".  And Christ's death
on the cross is the ultimate dispensation.  You keep using vague terms
to make your points, such as "the fact that this is how they are viewed
by the religious organizations that be."  Well, my religious organiza-
tion exists, and it certainly doesn't view what you call "cults" in that
way.  Specifically, what groups are you referring to?  You make claims
that mainstream Christianity thinks in these ways, however, I return
examples of Christian groups that don't feel that way and you reject
them.  I can have no objection with you saying "this is how I feel" or
"this is the view of my church", it's when you claim that your view is
held by all Christians, I can't let it stand unchallenged; since I am
a Christian, and I (as well as my church) disagree
   Please allow me the freedom to question your statements without
you claiming I am somehow lacking in manners.
