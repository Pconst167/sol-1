Actually, he's turned Muslim, and in his particular case /I/ have
something against him. It really annoys me that the man who wrote
music like "Sad Lisa" was quoted in Newsweek as saying Salman Rushdie
deserved to be murdered in the most henious way possible for his book
"The Demonic Verses" and that all non-Muslims are damned. He has
become everything I despise in people, and I have lost every shred of
respect I ever had for him.

I figure PV will be self supporting.  It'll have a hospital, shopping
malls, it's own TV & Radio stations (education, of course).  Those who
get under a 3.75 will most likely end up at the PV McDonalds, or haul
garbage.  The administration will be a monarchy.  There will be no

Hey, if you have them on any semi-usable MFM disk format, I can probably
read them.  If you're interested in giving away copies (or even getting
odd CP/M stuff back, if you have anything capable of running it now),
please let Turtle or me know.  If you don't have Z-System, then give

I'm supprised to here a good review of UCSD!  It's the first one
I've ever heard.  Long ago, when I was fairly new at this I wanted
to learn Pascal (knowing only BASIC and having heard of the strong
points of Pascal), so I got ahold of the nearest (only) available
Pascal package; And I gave it a good try...  All in all though, I
found it quite irritating.  Why should I have to learn a whole new
environment (I know because MiSery DOS sucks), when I only wanted
to learn a new language???????
Right now, I'm looking foward to learning C++.  I use C at work
every day, and I like what I've read about ++.
I can understand to a certain degree why micro Prologs have to be
somewhat stripped down.  While I must confess I know very little
about the language, what I do know suggests that just to execute
a Prolog program requires a great deal of run-time system services,
but don't worry.......   THE RISC-TRANSPUTERS ARE COMMING!!!! AND
BELL LABS JUST DEMONSTRATED THE FIRST OPEN INTERIOR OPTICAL PROCESSOR!!!

I'm glad somebody blasted me on that one.  I didn't have my facts
straight.  I must say though, the only machine in the list you
supplied that really has any power (a piece of junk with 512K is
sometimes better than a good computer with 16 to 64K) is the
TRS Model 16 (which I found out about this week).  Are you sure
they were available for under $5000 in '81 ?  The 68000 itself was
still a rare and expensive chip back then.
It's too bad things didn't go well for the Model 16; We might all
be using 68000 family machines today.

things waiting for me, like an IRS auditor or a dead walrus in the

understood by man, a small blob of unidentified sticky substance
invaded a disk drive, and promptly proceeded to smear itself all
over the message index file, and Beatle logged on and tried to
save a message, and the system put the header on top of the little
blob, and, well, have you ever seen what happens if you drop a
watermelon off a school building onto the pavement? That's kind of
what the message base looked like. The system was kind of up this
afternoon. Sort of. A little bit. Unfortunately, it kind of forgot
where it put a few of the messages...like most of them above #3272.
As a result, anybody who read new messages over #3272 probably
didn't see all of them...*sigh*  Well, anyway, things are kind of back
to normal now. Sort of. Didn't even lose any messages...just about four

I'm pretty sure it was around $4000.  As for it being "the only machine
on the list with any power," well, it depends.  I've seen a lot of
applications that do more with a Z80 and 64K than with a 80x86 and 640K;
the 68000 programmers don't seem to be as susceptible to such things,
but you still get things like 300K 16-bit CPU word processors that don't
have any major new features over 30K 8-bit CPU ones.  I have nothing
against 8-bit CPU's, despite the conventional wisdom that says that I
should throw all of them out.

Lemmee see - most of it is in the Apple CP/M format but I can always
drag it out of it's cubbyhole and transfer it over to MSDOS where I 
can send it out - reason for the strange round trip is no decent
term program under CP/M!  I have an old Osborne that I never got around
to making a "standard" rs232 plug for...  but I have a program that can
read those floppies - I'll see if I can find my goodie list.... later

Whaddya wanna know - it's 
a super datbase with an inference engine attached - it has the interesti
ability to "fill-in-the-blanks" with any and all information that fits
a given query - math is a pain in the butt.  Most Prologs will not allow
you to dynamically alter a database - Quintus would allow you to declare
the database as DYNAMIC and then you could do neat things.  Better to
get a book on Prolog and one of the PD versions of the language to play
with - there are a few if you have a MSDOS machine.  I just picked up
a shareware C++ front end for Turbo C.  Now if I can squeek some learn
time in between fires at work maybe I can use it for this big project
I have coming up (like they want it done by June).

Glad to hear it!  There's a certain section of Cochina Beach that I've
been dying to talk a stroll on - I just moved up here last Nov and have
not had a chance to really get out like I should.  That section of beach
looks truly beautimus with a couple of sand spits out a bit like a 
sheltered tropical cove (Hmmm I gues that's because that's what it IS)
Anyway - I agree with the marriage sucks statement - I would be happy 
with a soul that doesn't feel a need for that sort of possession (which
is what I feel is the root of the problem with marriage).  But I'm not
gonna wear myself out looking so I just busy myself with learning about
me - which is a job! and what makes me tick.  Funny that I have no

Killing (again, just a personal opinion...) is obscene, while sex is
whatever anyone wants to classify . I consider a lot of things obscene
and very few of them would be (to me) pornographic, but then again I'm

Ok -- if you can get them onto MS-DOS format it'd be easier, as the two
major formats that Montezuma Micro CP/M /doesn't/ know are Apple CP/M
and Commodore 128 CP/M, due to the weird disk formats they use.  Also
the "major" CP/M type formats like Osborne, Kaypro 2/4/10, Ampro, etc.
are all readable (and actually easier than either MS-DOS or TRSDOS
disks when it comes to transferring them onto our CP/M format).

Of course Pascal has strong points! Why, for example, it isn't
COBOL...that alone must be worth something. And of course EVERYBODY
knows strong typing is better than that silly messy undeclared-
variable time...it forces you to be conformist, rigid in your

Probably not. Civilizations don't really advance; they just replace

I had to work on a gen-u-swine IBM termional once that felt like it 
was firing a 50 cal. machine gun everytime you pressed a key - it really
shocked my poor nervous system working on that damned thing.  My evening
has been pretty mundane.  Friday nite I went to my best friends house 
for his birthday party - I took him and his wife to Alvarez at the Quay
last nite - then I stayed up till 4 calling my friends and favorite BBS'
in California.  Downloaded a lot of new stuff - mostly programming stuf.
Tonite I had to pay the piper by preparing meals for the coming week
(a disadvantage of  being single) and cleaning up my mess.  I went out
side with the intent of playing my 12 string in a cool spot but the
neighbors decided to have a domestic squabble.  Made me glad and sad in
the same moment.  Now I'm talking to you (provisionally speaking oops
these damned metaphors in the modern media! - of course) and listening
to King Crimson.  Shortly I will bow to the fact I won't be worth a shit
tomorrow if I don't get some sleep and wander off to the couch.  Oh yeah
I forgot another exciting part of the evening - calculating my moving
expenses for taxes (due too soon!)
The beach I speak of is right at the bridge between Cochina Beach and

Ok as soon as I find my list (that'll make it much easier!) must admit
that it isn't REAL high on my priority list but I NEVER forget.  By the
way there is a board in California that still has tons of CP/M stuff - 
now if I can find THAT number!!! Actually it should be in my Apple term
program as I called it all the time - something CAVE was the name. If
there is a real need on your part I could stir my bod just a tad harder 
to get started - otherwise when I get around to peering into that box
of stuff is when it will get done.

Well, the system went down again today; unfortunately, fixing it ment
restoring a backup copy of the message base, which was one day (and
about seventy messages) old. Every message posted on 02/04 was lost.
It appears that constant operation for the last several months without
a single break has caused a few problems with one of the disk drives;
the drives are in desperate need of cleaning and realignment. Therefore,
aLTER rEALITY will probably be going offline in the near future for
system maintenance; probably for about two days. I will try to post
a message in the logon screen telling you about this before it happens.
In any event, while AR is down the modem will probably be connected to
another computer running a simple host/feedback program; I may be
around for chatting, but you won't be able to read or post any messages.
More on this as it degenerates.

The reason people are "so fascinated" with Hewlett Packard's laser 
printers is quite simple, they cost about one fourth the price of a 
Postscript printer, will print a 20 page document that uses only 3 
different fonts (which is fairly common, if you know what you're doing)
almost twice as fast as Apple's slow $8,000+ Laserwriter IINTX. The
HP Laserjet III has variable size dots and anti aliasing routines which
boost the output quality to a 400dpi level, scalable fonts, and HPGL/2 -
plotter graphics language support with a street price of under $1,700.
An "upgrade" to postscript will come in the form of a cartridge, (with
2 Meg of internal memory recommended) for ~$600. Frankly I don't know
of anybody but LaserMaster who can top HP for price vs. resolution and
speed.  LaserMaster makes a 1000x1000dpi typesetter that comes w/ 201
scaleable typefaces which will print Mixed text and Graphics at better
than 7 pages a minute.. all for the same price as Apples IINTX - $8,000.

Uh, I don't know where you got your information, dude, but if you're
just printing pure text PostScript is about 2% /faster/ than HP's
laser printers. Besides, if you don't have PostScript you might as
well save the bucks and buy a nice, cheap daisy wheel; for any sort of
intensive graphics work at all (which is the ONLY reason I would ever
own a laser printer; using them for nothing but text and line graphics
is kind of silly) your serious choices are PostScript or PostScript.

Wrong-oh buddy... 1 - download 12 & 18 pt Times Roman, 10 pt Helvetica
(for footnotes) all of which are proportional fonts.. (n/a on a daisy
wheel printer) /and then/ churn out 20 pages which use those fonts 
faster than a Laserwriter can scale the fonts and print the pages.
 
If you're /really/ doing high level Desktop Publishing, 300dpi isn't 
going to cut it anyway... and you're definitely not going to want for
a postscript printer to turn out your mixed text/graphics stuff.
For someone who seems to hate overpriced and inefficient standards, I'm
surprised that you support Postscript..  An HP laserjet II w/ a LX6 
professional card will give you all the features of postscript, and 
up to 800x800 dpi resolution(depends upon how much RAM is on the card)
including font scaling(of course) rotation,shading,outlining, a choice
of opaque or transparency (not available w/ postscript) you can even
specify crosshatched characters if you want (or any other fill pattern)
it provides all the power, and over (way over) twice the speed of Post-
script for almost half the price. I understand Raster Devices also makes
a very similar card but doesn't provide (to my knowledge) the 201 
typefaces (all scalable) which come w/ all the LaserMaster cards.

"New Age", "Fusion" etc really went stale a few years back but the

by a guy named David Lanz - Great stuff.  I've always liked artists like
Vangelis (especially the ones he made with his friend Jon Anderson 
of YES), Kitaro, Jean Michael Jarre and Jean Luc Ponty.
Anyone else have any favorites in this musical realm that I might enjoy?

HP LaserJets are about 60% the price of a PostScript printer, not 25%.
A LaserWriter IINTX will print a 20 page document that uses only 3
different fonts at around 15 pages per minute; take my word for it--I
spent about a week shoving 75 documents through a IINTX several times
over.  The LaserJet II can only do that at 10 pages a minute when it
has a strong wind at its back.  PostScript only bogs down when you give
it lots of graphics or font changes.
    The LaserJet III impresses me a fair amount, but its language is
still--by Hewlett Packard's own admission--not as advanced as PostScript
is.  For office work, an HP is fine; for publishing, it isn't.  The
difference between HP's PCL and Adobe PostScript is roughly the same as
the difference between Forth and .BAT files: you can do a lot with .BAT
files, to be sure, but it ain't a programming language.

You might also look up Mike Oldfield, if you haven't already.  And, for
less "techy" classical/folk/rock fusion, Renaissance is very good, if
sometimes a little pretentious (also extremely hard to find now,
although their first two albums are available as a double-length CD).
Their lead singer also recently released a self-titled solo album,
"Annie Haslam," which is kind of pop but pretty impressive.  Anyone with
a five octave range impresses me to begin with, of course... the album
was produced by Larry Fast, who was the producer/songwriter/etc. for
Synergy, another fusion-type group you might have heard of....

Yep, the JD distillery is still in a dry county, and is likely to
be that way for quite some time. The county doesn't have the population
to call for a referendum to change things...kinda dumb, huh? I thought
Prohibition was something everyone had pretty well given up on as being
a legal disaster 'bout sixty years ago, but I guess not...

I spent about half an hour today listening to a song by the Indigo
Girls over and over, just before I went to work. The reason I was
doing this thing was to try to unwind a beastly complex guitar
section with several different themes superimposed on one another,
without notable success. The problem with this behavior was the fact
that I engaged in it just before going to work. Upon arriving at
work, I was subjected to pop music--a singularly painful transition.
After listening to music like the Indigo Girls, I go through a
refractory period where I really can't take most music, because it
ends up sounding really simplistic and crude. A piece of music
in which there are two distinct themes, each theme of which has a
direct 1:1 mapping phrase by phrase onto the other and each of which
is capable of acting as a harmony for the other, impresses me.
"He's a cold hearted snaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake" does not. The transition from
the former to the latter in ten minutes' time is an assault upon my
audial association cortex. Paula Abdul doesn't "do" complex music,
or complex thinking, for that matter. Oh well...at least I didn't suffer
the ignomy of being forced to listen to "Ooh I've got your girlfriend,
uh-uh I've got your girlfriend" at high volumes with mondo bass
distortion (yes, now you too can get 7% Total Harmonic Distortion for
a mere seven hundred dollars!), as has been known to happen in the
past...

What price are you using for the LaserWriter IINTX? I'm using the price
quoted by Elek-Tek in chicago last week for the HPIII - a little less
than $1,600 multiply that by 4 = 6,400.. and while I haven't been in the
market for one, I thought IINTX's were there or above.
Anyway, if you can do everything that needs to be done w/ .BAT files, 
and you will probably be able to buy a Forth compiler for 1/10th the
price in a couple of years, I'd stick w/ the trusty batch files and
keep watching the developments.

This is true.  However, I should take issue with your '300x300 dpi is
not suitable for serious publishing' comment.  That is commonly held, 
but there have been books like "Whalesong" published using actual
run-of-the-mill LaserWriters that have won all sorts of design awards
in the publishing industry.  Also, for "serious" publishing, the only
page description languages you're likely to find in use are PostScript,
and if they're using non-PS mainframe systems, TeX and Scribe (TeX is
set up to use Compugraphic outline fonts, and I suspect Scribe does,
too, although I'm not sure).  Do recall that PostScript is a completely
descriptive language and is completely hardware independent: it is not
a 300x300 dpi language.  Most non-PS laser printers for micros have to
use their own languages to do more than 300 dpi resolution, but if you
have a Macintosh, PageMaker and a PostScript driver, you can connect
it to a Linotype typesetter with an effective resolution of 2540x2540
dpi.
    I suspect once Phoenix Technologies' PostScript clone gets put into
use--removing the biggest monetary cost for the language (i.e., Adobe's
license fee)--it'll be in use a lot more.

A dry county is a county where it is against the law to sell, buy,
or consume alcoholic beverages. There are a few scattered areas of the
country, notably in the deep south, where Prohibition is still in
effect; the county where Jack Daniels is distilled and produced is
one of them.

  Okay, everyone, I have a challenge. I want you to read and understand
an essay in the May issue of Starlog. It's called "The Return Of The 
Other Marty McFly". Before I go further, yes, this IS about "Back to the
Future".  It's presented as a school report, and check out the purpose!
 "We'll not only be searching for mutltiple Martys, we'll be seing 
alternate futures, alternate presents, alternate pasts, alternate 
/alternate/ futures, quadruple DeLoreans, umpteen Einsteins and more Doc
Browns than even /we/ can keep track of."
  And check something like THIS out!
 "As the time chart...shows, even though we only saw [one] reality at 
the [first] film's end, /both/ realities continued to exist-since 
nothing happened to bring them back together..."
  Or THIS!
 "But most importantly, it /also/ means that Doc has been committed to 
an insane asylum-before he could invent the DeLorean time machine!
  So, Doc, Marty, and Jennifer have travelled into the future in a time
machine that was never even invented!"
 
  Well, I found this 6 1/2 page article a nice piece of altered reality.
It's amusing reading, too. I just want to see if anyone can UNDERSTAND 
it all! Also, if you CAN read and understand it all, I have a 260 block 
file on Star Trek warp propulsion you can help me understand... I can't 
make it past page one.

The term dry county refers to an area whereby the inhabitants profess
not to indulge in the evils of alcohol and thereby prohibit the
selling of said alcoholic beverages within their domain.  You can spot
these arid oasis' by a proliferation of liquor stores on ANY section of
public or private road that crosses into a non-dry county.  AS
As a interesting side-light, the local gendarmes and other local 
officials are usually the major uphoalders of the laws that keep the
county dry - reason?  There is a lot of money to be made in running
moonshine and other alcoholic beverages.  Y'see... these folks actually
figured out that prohibition was very very good for clandestine business
opportunities - not so dumb if you think about it.

Yeah - the cost is the big thing - I still have a lawyer checking out
Adobe's stipulations on the use of PostScript to see if I can "program
around it".  Another outrageous (and I mean outrageous) publishing
gimmick is the BitStream fonts at $250 a pop... Get real!  At that price
I'll carve my own lead letters and build a print press.  Sheeeeeiiiiitt!
I do like PostScript tho - the slowness comes from the interpreter that
has to be built into each printer (HP uses a cartridge).  For the first
copy it has to build a bit map in memory of the sheet.  By definition
any lines, curves or whathaveyou overlays whatever was there before.
This is why the first copy is kinda slow - for 2 or more pages the 
printer can crank 'em out at full speed.  More and more graphics images
are being done in Encapsulated PostScript (EPS). I got a couple of megs
of this stuff with a new package called Corel DRAW! the other day.  It's
for the IBM of course (whadda waste!). I had to break down and buy yet
another system this weekend - I picked up a barebones 286 from Amelia

Well, the reason was because there was no software...I just had the
modem answer the phone to let people know that the BBS is still up,
and that I haden't died, and so that the phone ringing wouldn't drive
everyone in my house crazy!  :)   
 
The drive still is causing a few minor problems, and I have to ask 
Turtle about them.....It looks as if when I get the BBS running off
of the AMiga, I'll be able to hook into these echos:
 
The Eagle's Nest
Multiversal Party Line
Other Suns
Furry Echo
Furry Bios
Thank God Its Furry
Furry Tech
Furry Magazines
 
If anyone wants a specific echo, please let me know!  Also, does anyone
know who the local FIDO host here in town is?  I know it /used/ to be
Rendez-Vous, but they went down...I have been told that is the 
Above Board, which is still up, but the guy in California says the
official updated FIDO list says AUB is, but the number he gave me that
the list had seems to be disconnected -- Doies anyone know the correct
number for AUB?  Thanks....
 
On to more important things, who all is showing at the ROAD RALLY, and
has anyone planned teams yet?

around in the program at once; (all distinct, and not interchangable,
of course...) and I kept confusing myself as to which function converted
which byte format to which one... Anyway, an idea for a REALLY useful

Dear Turtle,
    I am neither tone-deaf, nor do I hate Paula Abdul. Sure -- her
rhyhms are simple-minded, but the same can be said to, oh... say
most fugues by Bach. Heck -- same with the chord structure for his
"Prelude to Fugue #1"... That doesn't necessarily make for boring music.
    (My Ghod! Did I just compare Paula Abdul to Bach?)
    Her music is just "pop" -- little or no depth to it. There are
heavy-metal bands with about the same amount of depth. Hell -- there
are bands of ANY kind with the same amount of musical depth. (But
most of them seem to be Country/Western.)

None to speak of.  I was planning to write a remote host system for
the BBS to run under (the BYE4 that Turtle was speaking of), but I may
just write a "mini-BYE" at first and then start trying to code the BBS,
which will probably be a lot easier to write than BYE4 (or even the
mini-BYE) will be.

AUB is the official FidoNet host here but it is currently down,
hopefully to return soon.  I suggest you also try and get in touch with
Dr Pepper to see about carrying the TOONS-N-MORPHS echo, which is
another furry echo not associated with Nicolai Shapero.  If you getg
involved with both, you will learn that a lot of people really don't
like Mr. Shapero, and a lot of the animosity towards him came from his
handling of the FURRY echoes between the Rowrbrazzle BBS (which no
longer speaks to his board, and the sysops don't speak to one another
either) and with Noel Tominack on the Lighthouse Project BBS, a person
that Nicolai kicked off the echo--Noel ended up starting his own echo
with Dr Pepper's help, hence the start of TOONS-N-MORPHS.

The Furry Tape ][ is now completed and is of /much/ better quaility
than the first one....This tape has a running time of aprox. 60 
minutes....It includes:  AArdvark (SP?) Bondage
                         The latest Furry Party
                         Turtle Cam ]I[
                         Another Furry Music Video
 
It has been edited with less tape transfers, and with the help of my
Amiga and an RF Modulator -- I also used an Audio mixing board.
 
Thanks to Rocky for the RF Modulator and the Mixing Board...
 
The Furry Tape ][ costs NOTHING if you give me your own tape, and 
costs $3 if you want one of my tapes....

Dear Lady -
   I tried to call you the other day (I guess its been about a week now)
but you werent home.  I will continue in my efforts to get these books
to you (jeez...after all this they better be good).
   Yes, Ive read Les Miserables.  I enjoyed it very much.  Of course I
was forced to read it by some foul creature calling itself an English
teacher, but despite that I liked it.  I hate it when that happens!  I
liked A Tale of Two Cities by Dickens, too.  In fact, in retrospect (and
we all know how painful that can be) most of the classics were pretty 
damn good.  With the noticable exception of Wuthering Heights - it 
sucked.
   Until next time......

The Science Fiction Book Club accidently sent me a copy of Anne McCaf-
frey's latest "Renegades of Pern."  When it arrived I said, "Oh ghod
not another dragonriders book." However, having finished it I must say
it was worth reading.  Its not /great/ but its not bad.  The ending is
particularly interesting.  Best of all, you can read it even if you 
havent read a Pern novel since "THe White Dragon" - although the ending
will make a little more sense if youve read "DragonDawn" according to a
friend.  I havent read DragonDawn and it made sense to me.  So anyway,
I give it a thumbs up and a seven because its got a beat but you cant

I know of some "serious" publishers using LaserMaster controllers with
Canon-engine laser printers. It can be done, since LaserMaster allows
scalable dots as well as scalable fonts to improve apparent resolution
beyond the 300x300 norm.
 
FYI, LaserMaster uses their own, proprietary pdl, but the file is
converted "on the fly" so time is not wasted in numerous edit-print-edit
sessions. The output still exceeds Postscript speeds.

A good source of information on censorship is People for the American
Way. They are a non-profit coalition of bleeding-heart liberals whose
sole purpose is to catalog instances of censorship and attempted cen-
sorship in the United States. I don't know their address (can anyone
help?), but if you write to them they will send you their list of
censorship acts that's updated yearly. (Penthouse magazine prints the
entire year's list when it comes out in December, I believe). I will
warn you, though, it's kind of depressing reading...1989's list was
fifteen pages long. I'll look around for their address and post it here

>...until you see the output of the LaserMaster system, you better

Frankly, I doubt I'd be impressed, but that has nothing whatsoever to
do with the merits of PostScript or HP's page description language.
The first laser printer I ever used printed with a resloution of
1720x1240 dots per inch at a throughput of three pages per second...I
kind of got spoiled, and now it's /real/ hard to impress me.
The problem I have with HP's products isn't that the output doesn't
/look/ good; all laser printer output looks good. The problem is that
(a) I don't like the idea of a laser printer that requires font
cartriges (!) and (b) HP's PDL is amazingly primitive when compared
to PostScript--so much so, in fact, that it would be very difficult
for me to do the sort of work I normally do on a laser printer with an
HP product. (Of course, HP's laser printers also have other problems,
like the fact that they store a complete bitmap of the page so if you
print a solid black page you need at least a meg and a half of RAM
if you don't want only half the page printed on two sheets of paper...)

I would agree with (a) if it were true. The HP doesn't require font
cartridges; you can use downloadable fonts, too (like those from
Bitstream). I agree with (b), which is why I like LaserMaster. They
have a better approach (in my humble opinion) at a pdl (they have one;
so it _has_ to be better than HP, right?).

What's a LaserMaster?  Comparing PostScript to PCL--the language in
normal HP LaserJet printers--Turtle is correct.  If you're comparing it
to something /else/, then obviously he'd be wrong.  Of course, you could
turn around and compare it to a professional typesetting system running
Scribe or TeX and say both PostScript and PCL suck.  (And sure, you
/can/ connect such a machine to a microcomputer: the first two or three
years of Creative Computing were produced by entering everything into
Electric Pencil on a TRS-80 Model I which was interfaced to just such a
typesetter.)  But, doing that is taking the comparison far out of the
league it was originally set in.

Well, I'm sure you can do 'serious' publishing without PostScript (like
the TRS-80 Model I thing I described last message).  But, PS is one of
the most flexible PDL's out there and is completely device independent;
from your description of LaserMaster, it sounds like it fudges to get
beyond 300x300 dpi.
    I also suspect the Model I system up there was faster than both
PostScript and LaserMaster, but it probably cost 5 or 10 times as much
(and had 5 or 10 times better output quality, and was 5 or 10 times
harder to use).  You can find exceptions to every "rule."  I'd still
pick a PostScript system for doing any microcomputer-based DTP with any
popular hardware/software setup, ranging from the Mac or IBM running
PageMaker to the Amiga running Professional Page or the Atari ST
running PageSetter, or even the CP/M machine running Magic Series... all
of them let you plug your LaserWriter IINTX right into the RS232 port
and print away.
