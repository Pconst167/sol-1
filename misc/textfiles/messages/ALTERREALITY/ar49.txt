Firstly, you're looking at a brand new key presser. I have the modem set
up at work, so, until I get a computer for home, I can talk only during 
the daytime. And, since I am a newcomer, I started reading the messages,
happened upon your unfriendly message. Thought to myself, "Hey, this guy

Umm....I got it from someone on the BBSs.  He called up my system, 
left a message saying "I'm using a model 100...etc."  In fact, he has
a model-200, his model 100 which is as 'souped up' as you can get it,
and the one I got from him.  It only has 8k and I really wanna get some
more installed.  Bart said it was non-standard ram.  Do you know what 
kind it uses, where to get it, and how to install it without repeating
the Heathkit episode.  It's amazing that two very computer literate 
people walked up and started going "Oh wow, neat, lemme see," and a
teacher goes "Radio Shack...nice toy."  Hmmpphhh...if my friend, who 
wants one now, gets one, we're gonna hook 'em up with a long RS-232
cable and talk in class.  "Us?  Taking notes.  The cable?  Umm..shared
ram network, yeah, that's it.  Umm...increases the speed too...yeah."
Ask Raven if he still has that acoustic modem he got at the auction.  If
he does, I want it.

Actually, we were running TurboDos or some derivative thereof. We had a
TeleVideo 816 File server and 5 dumb terminals. I think three 506's (??)
Is that right? Another was a bigger one with two floppies on the side,
and the last was (I think) a TPC 1??? S'been so long I forget a lot of
it. Even had an external 300 baud (fast, eh?) non auto dial auto answer
U.S. Robotics that I used to steal and take home to my TPC 1 and call
around with. That's how I got hooked on BBS'ing. I can remember when 
CompuServe wanted $6.00/hr for 300 baud and an OUTRAGEOUS $12/hr for
anything faster!!
We started out with a non-multi-user database called Condor. Every time
one girl went into the same file as another, KA-BOOM!! Shit flew 
everywhere and we had to stop and do a backup restore. Then we went to
an 8-bit version of DataFlex, multi-user and all. It was great. That's
when I quit and went on my own programming in DataFlex. They refused to
change my job description to include programmer and pay me a bit more, 
so I left. Best move I ever made.

Your pardon, I said I've never seen an MS-DOS machine running
multiple **terminals**. Networking microcomputers is not the same
thing as running several terminals--and several jobs--off of one
microcomputer. MS-DOS is emphatically NOT a multiuser multitasking
operating system, Novell or no. A good rule of thumb: if all your

Yep. Model 4 Monochrome Hi-Resolution Graphics Adaptor thingie
whatsit. There was a color graphics card for the Model 1 that offered
320x200 resolution in 64 colors, but nobody bought it, either.
There was also a (get this!) /vector graphics/ card for the Model I,
like THAT'S supposed to be useful for something...you had to have a
special monitor for it that was more like an oscilloscope than a normal

Sure you can. Florida doesn't have seasons, it has weather. The
same thing, day after day, year after year...high in the too-high-to-
be-comfortable zone with a chance of late afternoon rain.
 
Funny you should mention Loveland Pass in Colorado; I used to live
in CO, and every winter we'd go skiing in the Rockies (Aspen and Vail,
mostly). Well, this one year we were all piled in a VW microbus (me
parents have always had a thing for VW's) and had to get over Loveland
Pass in the middle of a blinding snowstorm...and the only way the bus'd
do it was in reverse. One of my less-than-fond memories of Colorado.
VW's aren't noted for their effective heaters.

The RAM in a Model 100 is in this weird bastard plug-in thingie with
its own little battery on board...it uses 8Kx8 pseudo-static RAM
(can you say "about as standard as a circular doorframe"?). You're
pretty much stuck with going through the Rat Shack for more RAM. 
The Model 100 is a toy if you're using it as your only computer, but
it's the dandiest thing since sliced bread if you got one at home...you
can take the 100 around with you, use it to write letters or whatever,
then u/l it to the big 'un. The most impressive review I've ever seen
of the 100 was in a Mac User magazine; they said "Forget about trading
your Macintosh in for a Protable Mac, just get a Model 100 and it's the
same thing, basically."

   Really? (Very interested look on Dragonfly's face.) You mean the
Congressmen and Senators aren't nearly paranoid about staying in office?
   Let's face it -- the declaration of war only barely passed the 
Senate. (I think it was by five votes, at least three of which were
uncertain.) If there had been more protesting before the war, it would
never have been declared.
   Senators are paranoid about bad press, and will unusually vote with
what they think their population would like. The more protestors stir up
BEFORE a vote, the more likely their voices will be heard.

Two questions: How much extra hardware are we talking here, and when
you hang the terminals off of this thing, do you end up with one
/processor/ controlling multiple /jobs/? Is it actually a multiuser,

I would be very surprised if it were more than 640K, actually. The
IBM expansion bus is too slow for very large memory cards--you end up
having so much trouble getting the refresh signals out there to the
RAM that you have to throw in a gadzillion wait states for it to
work. That's why most upper-end IBM machines use SIMMs these days
...they've almost evolved a separate memory bus.

>Now, I have no facts to truly decide wether the war was good or bad.
     
   How can you decide if ANY war is 'good' or 'bad'? Is a war 'good'
is our side is winning? If we're involved? What justifies a war?
   Personally, I feel no facts will ever make a war 'good' or 'bad.' 
The morality of a war is subjective; facts are objective. For example,
was the Civil War 'good' or 'bad'?
   
> From what I heard, we couldn't have "won" it or "lost" it, but my

   "Winning" and "losing" a war, on the other hand is NOT subjective.
If the country that goes to war achieves the objectives it set out
BEFORE the war, it has won. If it doesn't, it lost. Simple, no?
   Our objectives in Vietnam were to prevent the Communists from
taking over all of Vietnam. Question: did we win or lose the war?
    
   Any comments from y'all?
                   /Dragonfly/
     
   By the way, winning or losing a war has no relevence to the morality
of the war, of course. Don't confuse the two issues.

  Of course. When you throw a real jelly sandwich against the wall, it
doesn't bounce back. Nobody has ever played marbles with real jelly
sandwiches. Jelly sandwiches squish when you toss them from hand to

   Even still, jelly sandwiches are much more fun to stuff down a

Hussein will continue to fight regardless of protests, or lack thereof,
in the United States.  You are right: what Hussein is banking on is
that the American public's opinion will grow so strongly anti-war that
the government will be forced to withdraw for political reasons, whether
or not the goal has been achieved.
 
This point granted, it is not sufficient reason for me to SUPPORT the
"war effort."  Look, bub, I have friends over there, and quite frankly,
I don't think this conflict is worth them dying over.  The soldiers who
have died there have NOT died for THEIR country.  They have died because
their government finds this war politically convenient.
 
Incidentally, "my protesting is what is giving him that hope!"?  The
only "protesting" I have done has been to question	 our country's
motivations.  Hussein has seemed genuinely surprised in past interviews
that Americans are ALLOWED to question	 their government.  I *do*
support our soldiers, but if I wasn't allowed to be less than supportive
of their Commander In Chief's reasons for sending them there, then
there wouldn't be a reason for them to fight in ANY war.

Ok, this is what I know about Viet Nam:
 
Originally, that part of Asia was called Indo-China.  When they kicked
the French out, it broke up into the individual countries.  The country
that was Viet Nam contacted the US and asked for some assistance setting
up a government, so we set up a govnt in South Vietnam.  (Not a US run
government, exactly, but a puppet type deal with one of them in office.)
Obviously, there were resources there that we could use, like rubber, an
a few others, I forget.  So we had "intrests" in the region.  Now, North
Vietnam was communist and turned on South Vietnam, which promply cried
to the US.  So, we sent "military advisors" over there, and then troops,
and then MORE troops.  
  Now, back home, Johnson was instituting a plan for "social overhaul" 
which supposedly was supposed to solve all of the problems for "under-
priveledged" peoples (poor folk).  Now, this all came right after the 
"Civil rights" movement, when blacks demanded to be treated as equal
citizens, and got it.   Well, that movement still had a lot of momentum.
  At the same time, the draft was on, to get more troops for Vietnam.
There were ways you could get around the draft, and the people who could
afford it, did.  How?  By going to college.  Black people, who were 
poor, got drafted more often than whites, because no money=no colledge.
No college=free trip to Vietnam.  So, the blacks were understandably
pissed.  The few draft dodgers who could afford college stirred up 
public resentment by protesting the war from thier sanctuarys.  So what
you got, was blacks rallying against the war (because they were going
the most), college people rallying against the war (because they didn't
want to go), and also college professors, who conspired across the 
country to stir up other campuses.  
  Now, local law enforcement athorities (who mostly came from blue
collar families), thought of the protesters simply as "hippies" and

"Pinkos" (kinda like that term) and tried to handle the first protesters
with "strong-arm" tactics...excruciatingly stupid social blunder.  Thier
crude methods of "protest control" not only did not *stop* the protests,
it created *MORE* protesters, because the ones who were indeciscive 
decided to side with the Anti-War movement after watching the brutal 
"Riot Control" methods the police used.  (So, you see, not everyone was
against the war; some were just radicals who wanted thier "right" to 
protest...and this was as good a cause as any....) 
  So by the time 1968 rolled around, Johnson was in a world of shit...
both domestically and on foriegn shores.  We were getting our asses 
kicked in Viet Nam, because of the stupid policy of "matching forces",
and at home there was real trouble.  The nation was rapidly separating
into Peace, man... vs.  Kill the Commies! (tm).  His "Help the Poor" 
and supporting the war was tearing the hell out of his budget (couldn
afford both).  Gen Westmooreland was lying through his teeth, the media
was telling on him every night on the six o'clock news.  Johnson didn't
want to pull out of Viet Nam because there were a lot of dead men 
already...and if he had pulled out without winning, then there would be
hell to pay, and besides...General Westmooreland says we're winning....

advance of Communism (which all the military advisors thought was going
to happen; the stupid Domino Theory, which went like: One country falls,
then another country falls, and so on. (...and he told to friends, and
he told two, and so on...)) (gee, aren't nested parentheses fun?).
Meaning, that if we'd gone in full force, as if it were a war, then we
could have defeated the Viet Cong.  Until they came out of hiding in
Cambodia.   
  But we didn't go in full force, it was a police action, which means
following the Rules Of Engagement.  Match force with force.  
  Why did we do that?  Well, people were concerned about the political
ramifications of declaring war on NVM.  We were concerned about what 
the USSR might think.  Besides, really, that was supposed to be a 
civil war.  We should have stopped with military advisors.... 
  I think that you will find that opinion colors a lot of what people 
say about the Viet Nam "conflict". 
 
My point was this:  Not all people who were protesting originally were
concerned about why we were there.  They couldn't have cared less, they
simply didn't want to go, theelves.  Then the blacks added thier
momentum from thier Civil Rights movement, and the Anti-War Movement
got stronger.  Then the police created all kinds of new protesters. So
by that time, it was really out of control, snowballing.  Nixon really
screwed up, when he "called on all the patriotic Americans out there
who support this war...the Silent Majority..."  All he did was polarize
a nation between Yes war and No war.   
 
  And then there was Woodstock.  What was the goal of Woodstock?  To 
promote peace.  Can you think of a more *popular* event in the last 
50 years?  So Anti-War became popular.  And the rest is history...
 
Turtle?  Care to clarify or dispute?  I realize that this was sort of a
slanted summation...but it was accurate, historically, as far as I can

Well, the terminals in question have to have special ROMs and cards
to interface to Ethernet or whatever LAN system you use.  The main
computer *is* the *only* processor to handle the jobs, and the software
is the multitasker.  It works rather well, or if you don't believe me,

I have described.  I understand that all the main has to have is
the software and the LAN card.  'Cept you have to have a powerfull

   Although I haven't read the original message, it seems the Specialist
agrees with the message: "If you're not absolutely supporting the war
in the Gulf, you're utterly opposed to it and our soldiers." Dualism,
though it might be convenient, is rarely right. 
    
   I'm curious: What do you mean by, "...if I wasn't allowed to be less
than supportive of their Commander in Chief's reasons for sending them 
there, then there wouldn't be a reason for them to fight in ANY war."
There would still be reasons to fight for a war, of course. They just
might not be for freedom or democracy. Then again, this was isn't being
fought for freedom or democracy, either.

   <Mouth hanging open in despair.> Did you really mean that? Do you
really mean to say "if it's popular, it would be silly to protest it"?
Whether or not it's popular has nothing to do with whether it's a good
idea to protest it. The best one can say: Not many people will be 
converted. 
    
   Should the war be protested? There's a fair number of people who
feel blood should not be spilled for oil, and that the sanctions 
should have been given more time. Should the war NOW be protested?
People don't want to see their loved ones die for oil. As soon as
body bags start flying in from the Gulf, the war will become much
less popular.

The new version of "Give Peace a Chance" isn't making ANY money for the
artists involved; all profits are going to various charities the
Lennons support.  It seems a fair number of people 'round here are
dismissing the song solely because it doesn't seem to support the
"popular" war.  Whatever one can say about lyrical consistency (a bit
of a red herring, since the song was never WRITTEN to be lyrically
consistent) or musical merit, dismissing it as a greedy way to stir up
protests just doesn't cut it.

To borrow one of your favorite phrases, "bullshit."  What stopped the
war in Vietnam was lack of support, both from the American public and
from the South Vietnamese themselves.  Public opinion	 was turned
against the war, more than anything else, by the havoc wreaked UPON the
protesters -- not the protesters themselves.
 
As for the claim that protesters were just there because they wanted
something to protest (something that I believe you've claimed repeatedly
in this thread), you're entitled to your opinion -- but there's not a
shred of evidence you can offer to support that.  All the protesters I
have ever talked with, whether from the '60s or the '90s, were sincere
in their beliefs.  There may be people who were "hangers-on" in the
movement who were only along just to be part of something, but the same
can be said for ANY movement -- including the current "pro-war"
demonstrations.

That's not necessarily true.  If he had taken over the United States
(a not terribly likely scenario, although possible), that wouldn't
necessarily change people's /attitudes./  A conquered country does not
develop an immediate love or respect for their conquerors; in fact,
I'd suggest the opposite would be more likely.

You might notice that I'm not out there protesting.  I see your point,
but I'm not particularly sure I agree with it.  For one thing, about the
troops "seeing the protesters and being discouraged"... if they have
any access to news media at all, they'll notice that 86% of the public
IS supporting the war effort currently.  I have been supporting the
troops, but I have not been supporting their commander in chief and
will continue not to do so.
 
It is also, perhaps, important to note that we DON'T KNOW what's going
on over there, when it comes right down to it.  The only reports we
get from the front are cleared by IRAQI censors, because the Pentagon
is less cooperative with our media than they are.  Caution	 toward the
press is understandable, but they're pushing it a bit too far; you must
wonder whether or not things are going quite as well as it's made out.
 
Last but not least: give the American public about three weeks after the
ground fighting starts in earnest.  The Pentagon right now has two
goals, to have the fighting be as short as possible and to have the
smallest number of casualties possible.  These two goals may be in
conflict, and if they go for one they risk botching the other.  When the
casualties start being reported not in one or two lost a day but in one
or two hundred lost a day, the "hippies" will not be the only ones
beginning to question our government's motivations.  As I see it, the
protesters aren't the radicals pissing in the wind they're made out
to be -- they're just a few months ahead of the rest.

It's not twisting words at all.  When you quote something, it's
generally because you thought it was said eloquently, and usually
because it said something you agree with more eloquently than you've
seen it stated before.  I don't normally believe in mincing words, but
I like the way Chris Grant said it: "Beating around the bush only gets
you sorry-looking shrubbery."  I have to question whether or not your
dismissive, sneering "so what?" in response to the Spider Robinson
quote, followed by a "who cares what a Canadian thinks?" comment, has
less to do with the source or the quote than the fact you just like
being derogatory and dismissive of ANYTHING said by anyone who dares
hold an opinion	 contrary to yours.  (If this isn't the case, it's
certainly the way you present yourself, and it tends to make any
"debate" with you fruitless, because your mind is already made up --
when evidence against your position is presented that you can't
attack, you dodge the question by attacking the person or some other
part of their message unrelated to the point.  I honestly wish you'd
consider this criticism SERIOUSLY instead of responding to it with
a flippant flame, hmm?)

   What do you think about women in combat? 
   Right now, women are allowed to take part in all non-combat duties
in our armed forces, but they aren't allowed any combat roles. Should
they be allowed to? If a woman is drafted, should she (like men) be
forced into a combat role? (Sub-question: Should women be drafted?)

   "If Hitler had taken over the U.S.... wouldn't necessarily change
people's attitudes." Let's quit talking abstractions, and talk reality:
the Baltic countries, taken over in 1945.
   The Soviets DID re-write the history of the Baltics. There are a
fair number of people from the Baltic states (and not merely the
Russians who have moved in!) who do not support independence from
the U.S.S.R. That's partly due to the forty-five years since the
war, partly due to economic reasons (oil from the U.S.S.R. has been
extremely cheap.) Face it: peoples' attitudes HAVE changed due to the
war: from hatred to resignation.
   Yes, the protests show there's still a lot of support for indepen-
dence. (And Gorbachev allowing there to be martyrs for the cause will
hurt him much more!) But I doubt anyone could claim the attitudes of
the Baltics haven't changed from over forty years of Soviet rule.

Homophobia is accepted as a word by Miriam-Webster. (Irrational fear of
homosexuality or homosexuals.) Even if it were at one point "made-up,"
the same can be said of every word.

Boy, you /do/ write some tough questions.

What do I think?  I don't like it. Scratch that, I hate it. 
  
NOTHING against women.  I /do/ believe women should, for the most part, 
be treated as equals.  This doesn't include combat. 
Just as a footnote to all female BBSers and liberalists. 
Nothing in this message is meant to be chauvinistic. 
Point #1.) Women are not as physically strong as men. 
Point #2.) Women are not as endurate as men. 
Point #3.) Women are more emotional than men, therefore are not 
susceptible to brain-washing and more likely to break under torture. 
Point #4.) Women are more likely to be raped.
Point #5.) Psychologically, as far as society is concerned, the 
brutalization of women is more enraging and more disgusting. Therefore,
the war would be more likely to turn into a blood bath.  Soldiers would 
attack with ruthless abandonment in retaliation. War, as ugly as it is, 
is fought by strategy too. 
Point #6.) Finally, I'd hate to see a woman hurt or killed.  I just rubs
me the wrong way.

Right.  Whether or not someone is gay is not be a reason to be firends 
with someone. I've had one gay friend that like to dresses and owned
over three-hundred Barbie dolls.  Very, very strange, but still he was
a friend.  At least, until he wrote me a love letter the day he moved
out-of-state.
I don't have any gay friends at this time.  But if I did, the SP4 would

>What do you all think about women in combat?
 
Well, women enjoy the benefits of our society, and do so essentially
as equals; therefore...
 
I don't buy a lot of the arguments that people use against the idea of
introducing women into combat roles. Women generally have better
physical endurance than men, even if they don't necessarily have
the brute strength (which isn't that much of a liability in modern
warfare); women tend to be more stable under stress than men; and
femenist myth aside, the "women=peaceful, men=aggressive" stereotype
doesn't have all that much validity. On the other hand, I don't think
society is likely to deal very well with the idea of women in combat
roles, and in wars which are large-scale to the point where they
involve a significant fraction of the younger population (like, say,
WWII) there are excellent arguments of a strictly continuing-the-
population nature against the idea. A given gene pool can more readily
lose a larger number of its male members with less damage than it
can lose a large number of its childbearing members. (But hey, if
women had been more involved with WWII, we might not be faces with
the problems the baby boom brought upon us...)

>...and more likely to break under torture. 
 
I'm not aware of any studies that have been done to address this point,
but I'd be willing to bet that women would actually deal with torture
*better* than men. No evidence to support either assumption, though.
 
However, you do have a good point about women being more likely to be
raped (in a battlefield 
type of psychological environment, a distinct
likelihood I hadn't thought of), and that brutalization of women is
likely to cause a stronger emotional reaction...and would therefore
be likely to cause problems of a completely different sort.
 
Finally, I don't like to see /anybody/ killed. It rubs me the wrong way.

Yes.  Of course, we were talking about the "validity" of quotes when it
comes to illustrating your point more eloquently than your own words do,
not whether or not a particular quote is "valid."  My point was only
a small and humble one: using quotes from people in an argument is not a

How about this for a comment on "hatred" vs. "fear": the former is a
more extreme degree of the latter.  All hatred is BASED on fear, even if
it is just a fear of the unknown.  Every person I have met who hates a
particular group -- whether that group is homo/bisexuals, or blacks,
Jews, women, or whatever -- generally neither understands them nor is
willing to take the time to do so.  In many cases, they're not willing
to get close enough to a known member of that group to see whether or
not the assumptions they base their hatred on	 is valid.  "Homophobic"
IS as good a word as any to describe someone who hates gays.
 
And, incidentally, it was created by psychologists, not homosexuals,
as the Specialist would like us to believe.

It is a philosophical question of just what fighting for your country

defending your country or its allies, but I don't think they hold much

Promoting pacifism.  Horrors.  What IS the world coming to?  I might
point out that the new version of "Give Peace a Chance" was recorded
BEFORE the war broke out, making the argument its sole purpose was to
protest this war a bit shaky.  It is true that the people who recorded
(and wrote) the song aren't supporting U.S. involvement in the
"liberation" of Kuwait.  So what?  The message of the song is inherent
in the title, and as trite as it may sound now (and may have sounded
when it was first recorded), I don't think it's a bad idea.  All of
history tells a tale of countries that are more willing to kill one
another's soldiers and citizens than to give peace a chance; in fact,
it suggests that a lasting peace is a great deal more difficult to
achieve for ANY length of time than simply beating each other's
brains out until somebody cries "Uncle!".  I don't particularly like
the song, but I appreciate the message, and I wish more people would
wake up to the fact that war is simply the path of least resistance--
not necessarily the best solution to political conflicts.

Ah.  Was the main system running PC-MOS rather than MS-DOS?  I have
seen true multi-user PC installations running under that system using
Arcnet cards.  I believe Novell is just software, although they make
both Arcnet and Ethernet cards (which can run on any LAN or multiuser

Well, here's an opinion.  Women in the military should be allowed into
combat positions.  Women, on the average, have /more/ stamina and
agility than men do -- they're just usually not in jobs where that
shows through (due to the same societal bias about "proper female roles"
that keeps them out of combat currently).  The only reason they are not
in combat now is because of lingering pseudo-chivalric ideas of menfolk
protecting their delicate women.

The economic factors for the Baltics would not hold true for a nation
trying to conquer the United States.  Point one: we're halfway around
the world.  We are as close to economically independent as you're likely
to get in our geopolitical system (yes, I am aware of the trade deficit,
but compare our self-sufficiency to that of most second-world nations).
During WW2, we were in a much better position to be self-sufficient than
we are now.  Point two: we're big.  We're REALLY big.  We're bigger than
all of the Axis powers put together.  I have a great deal of trouble
believing that the United States /could/ be conquered in its present (or
WW2) form: it simply wouldn't be possible for the conquerors to hold it
together for that long.  We aren't talking about the USSR taking over
the Baltic states, we're talking about the Baltic states taking over the
USSR.  The logistics problems, especially with 20th-century combat
mechanics and technological realities (not present in the histories of
the great "world conquerors" of the past), would be close to
insurmountable.  The "conquered" U.S. would always be on the brink of
revolution, and the North American "empire" would probably have a great
deal of trouble lasting past the '70s -- if it could ever be forged to
start with.

I would like to interject with a story about endurance as far as men 
compared to women. 
When I worked for Winn-Dixie warehouse in Sarasota I saw, first hand, 
the trouble women have keeping up with men.  
Let me set the stage. 
It's five o'clock in the morning, you've just punched-in. 
At the front shipping desk you're assigned to an aisle.  
In these aisles are pallets of merchandise. 
Bear in mind, that you have to throw 551 cases per hour to keep your 
job.   Also, these cases weigh between 5 and 45 lbs. 
So, if you figure an average case weighs, let's say, 20 lbs. 
And you throw 551 case per hour, eight hours a day. 
In one day, you've thrown approx. 10000lb/day. Or 80000 lb/week.
Now, we all know that lifting 5 to 45 lb is not /that/ difficult 
even for a woman.  But when I came down to throwing average, I never 
saw a women throw average consistently.  And, yes, we did have a few
female employees, most didn't last two days.

No.  Women should not be allowed into combat zones. 
Couple of reasons.  One, women would be allowed to "get over".
In other words, an NCO who was in charge of a squad might not put a
woman on point as much as he would put a man on point, simply because
he favors the woman, or the woman offered him favors.  Two, men have 
a tendency to act irrational around females.  Two soldiers out ther
have been shot.  Who is the first a man would rescue?  A female soldier.
Why?  Why being gallantly stupid, of course.  Or any situation like 
that, where a female was in danger, and probably would be perfectly 
safe, a man would risk his life (gallantly) to save her before saving
another male soldier. Three, men would compete over the woman, causing
problems within the squad, and reducing morale and efficiency of the
squad.  Yes, I've seen it happen in garrison, so don't tell me it 
couldn't happen out in the field (and over some of the gawd-awfulest
lookin females ya ever did see!). Four, there is the matter of female
physics.  Some females (not all, I've met a few to kick anyones ass) are
simply not strong enough to face the rigors of combat over an extended
peroid of time.  AND, speaking of periods...need I say more?

   Something gives me the impression that whatever caused you not to
like them had nothing to do with their sexuality.
    
   This topic reminds me of someone I knew: one of the best bosses I've
ever worked under was a lesbian. (This one's for you, too, Specialist!)
She was an extremely good business-person, utterly bilingual (with
staff that generally only spoke English or Spanish), and a fantastic
editor. She was a tough, determined lady who turned the newspaper
into something worth reading. So what if her lover was another female?
    
   On the other hand, I've known several gay men who were constantly 
'hitting on' anything male that moved. (Haven't noticed the equivalent
in females.) But, the majority of gay men I've met have not been pushy
about their sexuality.

To be honest, i have mixed feelings on the topic as well. Personally, I
feel NO ONE should be forced into combat. (Leave soldiering to the
professionals!) But, if women want to be treated as equals, I feel there
can be no exceptions: not even combat.
    
   It's true that on the average women aren't as strong as men. But,
NASA has shown that their endurance is about the same as men. 
(Surprise!) 
   Sad but true: Nowadays, brainwashing is nearly an exact science.
Thanks to wonderful chemicals we have now, the strongest-willed man
can be reduced to tears. 
   It's true women are more likely to be raped. But I don't feel that's 
sufficient reason to keep them out of combat: men can be raped, as well.
   Finally, your last two points seem to be the same: It would be horrid
to see a woman die in combat. To me, it's horrid to see anyone die in
combat.
     
   There are other issues, of course: sexual relations between the
soldiers. Would that increase or decrease morale? (Especially when
some soldiers get possessive of 'their guy' or 'their gal.') And what
about maried men in the military: wouldn't that place a strain on their
marriage? There's a lot of questions, and I have few answers.
