Welcome to aLTER rEALITY! This system is in the throes of startup,
and is somewhat hampered by the fact that the computer it's
running on is lacking certain vital organs (like a SCREEN!),
so any peculiar problems you may experience are going to have to
be suffered along with for a while...
 
Anyway, this section is for general chatter of an indeterminate
nature. (This, of course, should be obvious.)
 
Oh yes... the system hours are 11PM-5PM 7 days a week. Try not
to call between 5 and 11.

Should this country continue its current plan to produce the

...may be found all sorts of oddness, much like, say, Lassie, only
much, much different; perhaps like what Lassie would be if he
were a twelve-foot-tall fire-breathing toaster oven instead of,
as he is more commonly depicted, an excessively cute and lovable Collie,
which he in fact is, and therefore can't really breathe fire
at all, which is kind of too bad as it could present all sorts
of neat plot developments to the TV show's script writers; but
perhaps that's a good thing after all, since it'd look really

A  peculiar problem with Stealth-type weapons in general is that they
can't be radar-guided--the radar signature they would emit would nullify
any advantages the Stealth design presented in the first place. So that
pretty much leaves out "smart" weapons (unless they're laser-guided, an
idea that hasn't worked out terribly well in the past), as well as
terrain following radar (unless it's /really/ low power, in which case
you do what the B-1 does and "execute a controlled flight into terrain"
a lot...), active EW devices, air-to-air radar...

Nope; that'd be a real bad idea. The computer, as it is right now, is
a bare PC board connected to a rack of disk drives and a whole bunch
of wires and stuff. Until I get a replacement for the screen chip, I
won't bother to put it all back together. (It's sort of a post-modern,
deconstructionalist statement; it reduces the notion of "computer"
to its bare elements...) The VT-52 sitting next to it is, of
course, simply an artistic counterpoint.

If you tend to have difficulty logging on to this system, like only
receiving garbage characters, try waiting until the system sends
Press <Return> before hitting anything. Once you get a carrier, there
will be a pause of a couple of seconds before you get the "Press
<Return>" message; sometimes if you hit return during that time you'll
screw up the baud rate detection routine. I'm working on a new version
of PBBS/H Front Door that may correct that problem.

Hypothetically speaking, of course, if I were not a good father,
I could see it grow up in poverty and misery...or I could beat
it to death...or I could simply never see it at all. There's still
adoption, of course, if it's a healthy, WHITE baby; if it's born un-
healthy, or if it's black, it's considered "unadoptable." Then, of
course, the child can look forward to an endless series of foster
homes, in which if it doesn't get abused it's doing pretty well. And
anyway, when it grows up, if it grows up, it can be excused for not
being ecstatic over its lot in life.
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

on a new version of PBBS/H Front Door that's SUPPOSED to make
logging on easier but seems not to like letting people on at all;
partly it's the result of running a system blind (but that should be

seems less and less likely each year that you'll discover... never

   No statistics can ever be completely verified. During the middle
ages, unicorns were believed to prance all over the globe -- except,
of course, the part you happened to live in. Fortunately, many unicorns
were caught, and their horns were proudly displayed among the riches
of many kings... indeed, a unicorn's horn once fetched five times its
weight in gold. Unicorn parts were used as the supreme tonic, but
especially as a talisman against poison. However, as the middle ages
wore on, and more people began learning more about the world, the
lower the population of the unicorns. Oddly enough, the cost for
alicorn (the unicorn's horn) dropped tremendously, in direct violation
of the supply/demand principle. As the middle ages dropped to a close,
no one wanted anything to do with the very-existant horns of the
non-existant beasts.
    That's logic for you.

Pininfarina made a concept car with a "seat" like that. It's a 
convertible with two rounded "benches" from back to front; the driver
and passenger straddle it as though they were riding a motorcycle,
and lean on handlebars positioned in front of the things. The foot
pedals which operate the vehicle are located on either side of the
driver's saddle, slightly /behind/ the point at which he sits...

     Abortion has got to be looked at from all sides. It does not only 
involve the woman, It also involves the man and naturally the child.
I can honestly say that being faced with that as an option is not any
more soothing then not having it at all. If the child is healthy and
has the luck in being adopted that is the decision I would make. 
However If the child is not healthy, Or the Mother is not healthy,
the child will say be abused, (in any form) then yes the child should
be aborted. I still promote the use of contraceptives!!!!

are actually the toes of the increasingly endangered Pimen bird of
southeast Asia. This bird, noted in the wild for its spectacular
plumage and its eerie mating call, is being ruthlessly hunted for its
delicious red toes, which are cut off, put in little glass bottles,
and stuffed inside green olives for consumption in the States. 
As this ruthless activity increases in scope, the Pimen bird is
being hounded into oblivion by the greed of man. I say, ACT NOW!

The storyboard on the Den probably won't 'come to an end'... something
else will happen.  That's one of the points of having a free-form
storyboard rather than a conventional "Once upon a time lived Fred and
Agatha" story, where everybody adds another chapter to the saga of Fred
and Aggie until about 5 chapters down the line when somebody gets bored
and completely changes the setting, and the plot immediately goes into
dribble and slops all over the disk drive until somebody says "Then they
all die, let's start over."  Since characters are free to come and go
in the Den (after all, it _is_ a Pub, and it's still open for business,
although any newcomers might not get served immediately!), any new user
could come in and start making trouble.  It is possible Spellwind might
come up with a coherent plotline, as hard to believe as that is.
Assuming, of course, he doesn't try to screw up the current plotline and
get his access level bounced.

   Having your style of storyboard simply makes more sense than the
"chapter" type of storyboard -- if one wishes to add another plotline,
it's fairly easy to do (either by adding a twist to a character's
background, or by adding another character...) but most importantly,
there are lines to what can and can't be done with the storyboard.
Other people might not like your idea to ...say, journey into the 
Abyss, and might prefer to... say, cuddle with a nearby barbarian mouse.
You can't (or, at least shouldn't) force others to do your bidding --
this is quite a bit more like real life... (except, of course, having
a certain unicorn spontaneously attack a certain Angel -- which WILL
have serious consequences to Chip...)

> Most Copulatoriums are species-specific!
 
Cute word, but its accuracy depends strictly on which setting you happen
to put it in.  If the variance in species is as wide as the Cantina in
STAR WARS, point granted.  If, however, things more closely resemble
the alternate earth that the Tyel Hyatt Regency and "Fur Le Dance"
nightclub (from the storyboards on Kyim's Scratching Post and the
Tiger's Den, respectively), then you're a little off-base.  If you
don't want to go to California for examples, there's Sheba the Cheetah
coming on to every male in the "Ace of Spades", Murr & Turtle's
quickly warming relationship in the "Double Edge Tavern" and Juka &
Xonzoff on the Pub, who have certainly done more than cuddle cutely in
the corner, even if they haven't done it "on camera" like the Calif.
furry boards occasionally do.  None of those are set in a bordello, but
given an atmosphere where cross-species matches aren't thought of any
more oddly than an elven/human couple in your average Generic High
Fantasy, it wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary (at least, not
necessarily).
    The barrier for Chip would be the fact that he is a quadraped in a
world of bipeds.  There are "furry" centaurs running around, though,
both in Ranea and through 'Furversion', so a cross-species match
wouldn't necessarily be impossible for him, either, depending on his
own whims about such things.  Of course, it's YOUR fault he's not a
biped.  Empress Alicia from "Xanadu" is a unicorn, too, and she's a
humanoid (and one who'd have absolutely no difficulty attracting
lovers of any species or sex, as long as they're living).

It is starting to look like the storyboard currently on Outland,
"Black Devil Saloon," will eventually move over here to aLTER
rEALITY, in a somewhat larger format (new! improved!). The basic
premiss is this: the board is a "furry" storyboard set in a
Wild West town similar to any of a zillion or so seen on any
bad western you might find late at night on some obscure cable TV
channel. The story will probably be divided into three discrete
settings: a tavern (of course), a casino, and a hotel, each of
which will have its own conference on this system. Although
activity will focus on these areas, it is not restricted to them (for an
idea of what I mean, simply consider the Wyvern's Den Pub on that
other PBBS system...) Users will be given free access to the
tavern area, but will have to request access to the casino and
hotel. In theory, three separate but related storylines could take
place in the same town with this arrangement, and one player may have
characters in all three. We'll see how it works. The tavern area will
most likely be a "conventional" wild west furry story, if that isn't
an oxymoron; the casino may be a PG-13 area, and the hotel an R area.
We'll see how that goes, too. Anyway: That's the general idea. Comments?

Hmm. It seems that Congress still has the general idea that Ronald
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars" to you and I) is
basically a good idea, even if they are willying about trying to decide
how to pay for it. As you probably know, the idea calls for building
a system that will use lasers, particle beams, and other bits of
wizardry to zap enemy missiles before they arrive. That may or may not
be a technological possibility, but in any event it is certain to be
very expensive. Also, if technology develops on both sides of the
Great Divide, as has always been the case before, it can be stated that
any system we get working today, the Russians will be able to get
around tomorrow, unless we upgrade, which of course will make them
upgrade their upgrade, etc... So given that the system is likely to
be prohibitively expensive and at best only temporarily effective, I
say: BUILD IT. Why? Read the next message.

OK, so why do something that's (a) expensive and (b) not likely to
work very well? Simple. Defense budgets on both sides of the fence
are limited, and getting more limited all the time. So, here's
what's likely to happen:
Flunky: "I've got some bad news, sir. The Reds have just announced
development of a new hyper-shielded supersonic-boost missile that can
survive our Omni-Zap Destructo Ray. They'll start building them
Tuesday."
General: "Didn't we just pay $120,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 for the
Omni-Zap?"
Flunky: "Yes, sir. The research people say they can fix it so that
it'll take out a Russkie hyper-shielded missile for only $6,000,000,000,
though."
General: "Great. And our new omni-invisible super-missiles can get
through the new Commie hyper-blast particle gun, too. We're doing well."
Flunky: "Not really; the Reds have just announced an improved hyper-
blast that'll nail our missiles. We can fix the missiles, though,
for only $45,000,000,000."
...And so on. Sooner or later even the most pinheaded Pentagon
peon will notice that everyone's spending gobs of money on missiles
and systems that probably won&t ever work. Since moral, logical, and
ethical arguments have so far failed miserably to get the superpowers
to sit down and admit that ICBM's are a pretty bad thing, perhaps
economic considerations will do the trick. If it can be demonstrated
convincingly that they are far too expensive and far too unreliable
to be effective weapons, we'll finally legislate the bastards out of
existance...
         ...but probably not.

Well, the centaurs are also running thru Furversion #18--most of what
Michael Higgs draws, for example, and some of Mary Hanson-Roberts'
depressingly cute creatures qualify, too.  Of course Chip is from a
different race--but so are elves and humans.  In "Only With Thine Eyes,"
the species differences are of extreme importance, but that may be due
to social taboos more than anything else.  In Ranea, it's treated
(mostly) like mixed marraiges on earth, or in slightly less tolerant
areas, like human/elven crosses in some D&D worlds (in some really
intolerant areas, it might be considered bestiality, but in the state
that the Wyvern's Den is located in, it would at best raise a few
eyebrows).  By the way, how did this come up again?

I'd have just one character who travels between the three storyboards.
Assume they're separate locations that you can move between.  Fred

Well, let's see here. First off, a crocodile character would be
perfectly acceptable...might even make for an interesting "Billy the
Kid" type of character. It is also certainly possible that one
player might like to have a character who "hangs out" in each of the
three locations, but since they're all in the same town a single
character could appear in all three with relative ease. I am also
considering mandating that ALL characters be non-human, but haven't
decided yet. (It's kind of a shame PBBS doesn't draw a clearer
distinction between message conferences...unless you pay attention to
the conference storyboard messages are posted in, things could
conceivably get confusing...) I will probably set things up and
start the ball rolling in the next week or so, barring unforseen
disasters (knock on Billy Graham).

Well, maybe it was Furversion 17, although I count 2 in #18 (p. 1 and
p. 44).
   Cross-species mixes aren't fertile, except for the Sidhe, who can
breed successfully with anything (possibly literally).  The Sidhe are
the local equivalent to dryad-types, and are magic  (I'm speaking more
of the classical dryad who was considered to be a minor deity, not the
wimpy D&D variety).  It is possible you could have a more humanlike
furry with wild magical powers who was the offspring of some furry and
a Sidhe, and it's not completely impossible you could end up with
someone who looks like Alicia from "Xanadu" from a Sidhe/Unicorn mating.
These offspring are occasionally fertile (at least amongst themselves,
although very rarely with anything else except Sidhe) and it's possible
that several of the furry races running around got their start that way.

Turtle, of course, is an ANTHROPOMORPHIC reptile. 'Morphs are not
human-animal crosses, they are simply bipedal, humanoid alterations
to basic animal stock, just like humans are bipedal, hairless monkeys.
Turtle has no human blood in him whatsoever. He does, on the other hand,
have two legs, two arms ending in 4-digit hands with opposing thumbs,
and a REAL BIG gun.

<Staring at the gun> Well... maybe you're right. (If the gun weren't
there, I might say that you proved my point exactly; that you are
a "bipedal, humanoid alteration" of a turtle -- and therefore not truly
one hundred percent turtle... and the most likely reason you are bipedal

>"If the beagle sits next to your luggage, you're doomed -- B. Fox"
   
    Interesting quote. My stableboy was coming back from Mexico this
summer, and one of the guard dogs (an English Spaniel, actually) fell
in love with his legs... The dog sat down on his feet at least four
times, and would not leave his legs. (A second dog also came by to
investigate his legs...) The stable boy was waiting for one piece of
baggage to arrive --- and had this "nice chat" with the officer. Well,
he eventually was detained for a full hour while he was "inspected,
detected, Inspected, Defected... and they left no part untouched" as
the Arlo Guthrie song goes. From the evidence of the two dogs, the
officers were convinced that this was going to be their biggest "haul"
for several months. Finally, the strip search came. When the "bare 
essentials" were removed, he says he's NEVER seen officers more
shell-shocked.
     Oh. The reason the dogs were following him around. My stable boy's
parents had a small dog in Mexico. It appears she was just getting 
into heat.

The beagle looks for apples and animal products.  It's an awfully cute
puppy.  Not at all like the six-foot, 300 pound, snarling German
Shepards with the six-inch drool-covered fangs that greet you at most
European airports.  The beagle wears a cute little green jacket, too.
"Beagle Brigade," of course.

Yep, if you'd-a seen this place about a year ago, you wouldn't think
anythin' short a levelin' it woulda cleaned it up.  Miz Sable sure seems
to have a way with a business.
   Take the bar itself.  Nobody but Georgia woulda been able to get a
mahogany top--well, that ain't true, but nobody but her woulda been able
to /keep/ one in such good shape, considerin' the folks who usually come
through these parts.  That's the way she does everything--nothin' but th
best.  Don't know if the curs around here deserve it, ya know?  People
still call the Black Dog  a  dive, but it ain't one.  Ya can tell that
just by lookin' around.
    Georgia Sable herself is in the back somewhere, I suppose.  Right
pretty woman for her age, but if you're a man, it's her daughter you
better look out fer.  Sherry's about the cutest thing in a dress you've
ever seen, and if she's feelin' playful, she'll drive everythin' out of
your mind except wonderin' if she's the cutest thing out of a dress, too
I hear tell she--no, Georgia'd kill me if I spread that.  'Sides, Sherry
would tell ya herself if she likes you.  Heh.
    The piano player?  Don't know much about him.  Calls himself Butch.
Don't know where he got the eye-patch, either.  Doesn't say a whole lot,
but plays the keys pretty well.
    By the way, I'm Ralph.  So, what'll it be?

     The tall, lanky raccoon glares at the noonday sun with a sour
expression as he strides down the dusty street toward the Black Dog
Saloon--a common destination for him, particularly seeing how's it's
a fairly quiet Saturday and the place should be open any minute now.
He is, naturally enough, feeling quite hung-over and is therefore in
an even grouchier mood than usual, which is right remarkable, consideing
that he's got a legendary temper 'round these parts--not to mention
being one of the fastest draws around. (It's for the latter reason
that folks don't usually call him a grouch, 'ceptin if they have maybe
50 other people with them...)
     Stripe gives the world one more glare before pushing into the
Black Dog, which at the moment is totally deserted save for Ralph.
Exactly the way he wants it... The raccoon sits heavily at the bar and
without preamble orders a whiskey--straight up. "Rough night, Stripe?"
Ralph says without sympathy as he pours the drink. The raccoon grunts
and tosses back the dark brown liquid, then orders another. "Stagecoach
due in today," he thinks to himself as he idly fingers the silver star
pinned to his vest. "Things'll be picking up before too long. Should
be an interesting day..."

The Black Dog Saloon is now open for business! Step right up, git
yerself a character, have a drink! Here's some background info for you
to help get you started...
     The Black Dog Saloon is located in the town of Hell's Bluff, a
typical middlin' large settlement out west somewhere. Hell's Bluff
don't have much to reccomend it to anyone, 'cept for its location
(seeing how 'least two major stagecoach paths intersect here).
The saloon is owned by Miss Georgia Sable, who also owns the Aces High
Casino 'cross town, and the Gentleman Stranger hotel, the only one
worth talkin' about for at least a hundred miles around. (More
on these establishments later...) Georgia and her daughter Sherry are,
naturally enough, sables.
     Some of the other characters around here may need a little intro-
duction, too. Butch, the piano player at the Black Dog, is a canine
type; looks rather like Spuds Mackenzie with an eyepatch. Ralph, the
bartender, is a genial, outgoing silver fox And, of course, you've
already met Stripe...

[from the Crocodile Roc'namus]
   Walking by the Black Dog Saloon, I glance in. The only customer is
Stripe, so I walk in.
   In a town where most folk wear fur, a crocodile is a rare enough 
sight -- and usually avoided. There ain't no crocodile that doesn't
look gruff: having as many teeth as we do helps with the image. 
Though I've never done anything to dispell the image of "rough and 
ready," I've made a few friends in the town. What th' hell. If I'm
gonna try and be social-like today, might as well stop in at the
Saloon.
   As I walk through the doors, I tip my brown Stetson to Ralph.
For some reason, whenever I enter, he always changes his song to one
I don't recognise, muttering something about "early Elton John."
I mosey up to the bar.
   "Ralph, pour me a beer." Silently, he turns around and pulls me a
mug. It's gulped down in a few seconds.
   I turn to Stripe, fingering his badge. "So, when's the coach
runnin' through town?"

The external program needs to check for carrier drop on its own; there
is a flag in high memory now to check for local logons.  Yes, you'd have
to modify the door programs to do that.  Big, fat, hairy deal.  If you
think you can write a short high-mem routine that PBBSH can install
that can do carrier check as a background task, and reload PBBSH (or if
PBBSH protects itself, just jump to "START" so it reloads PBBS from
that point), I'll be glad to integrate it in.  Making the door two-way
would be massively tricky, though; PBBSH would need to save all the
current user information in CURRENT/USR somehow, *and* modify PBBS to
look for a CURRENT/USR file after it initializes--if it's there, it
would read it in, kill the file, and jump to the main menu.  It could be
made "one-and-a-half-way" by letting people reload PBBS and relog on;
the door supervisor program (i.e., the menu of things to do) could keep
its own mini-userlog maintaining a last call date and time limit, and
thus make sure people only spend a certain amount of time in the door
each day.
   Aforementioned background task ^ could also check the keyboard for
F1, a key that ostensibly couldn't be sent from the modem, and go to a
mini-chat mode when it's pressed.  The carrier detect routine would be
fairly simple, but /you're/ the one who says he knows how to make the
computer drop what it's doing and reload the program on the advice of
a measly little background task....

Subject: 'Trit' machine 
Date & Time: 11/12/89 15:14:25
Message Number   272

Some comments about your 'trit' (trinary digit) machine:
   Let's call the three states possible on the machine 'T' or 2 for
absolutely true (corresponding to 1 on a binary machine), 'U' or 1
for an uncertain response (no correspondence, of course), and 'F' or
0 for absolutely false (corresponding to a zero on a binary machine.)
   I've only come up with one major advantage for trinary machines:
there would only need to be one flag for compare and for zero. (Instead
of Donthen's idea: zero, not zero, and kinda zero) After a compare
statement, the 'compare' flag is 2 for x>y, 1 if x=y, or 0 if x<y.
This is logical, and reduces the flags necessary by one.
   'AND' and 'OR' statements, of course, will have to be scrapped,
with a 'LEAST per trit' and a 'GREATEST per trit' statements taking
over. What do I mean? Try '012012012 LPT 222111000' = 012011000,
and '012012012 GPT 222111000' = 222112012. LPT can still 'mask out
trits' (very useful, indeed!) and GPT can force trits to be set.
Even still, I don't think there's a correlation to the logical NOT
command. (Is NOT F defined to be U or T?)
   If this were the only change to the system, (having trinary), I
don't know if it would be worth the hassle (except, of course, to have
a system that CANNOT be compatible with anything else on the planet.)
But 	I'd still like to talk with you sometime about the instruction
set of such a machine (not too many changes, actually!).
   By the way, if you're trying to write an emulator (I might be...),
to keep from losing much memort, store five trits in eight bits. (values
from 0-242 in memory that can store values from 0-255.) If memory is
reall important, a better scheme is storing 17 trits in 27 bits. (The
first loses about 5.35% of your memory, the second, 3.93%. These are
the best for under thirty bits.)
   If you're really feeling weird (and want to be hassled), 
Robert A. Heinlein thought of the same idea. He suggested three-phase
A.C. to represent the states.

Well, a trinary machine's greatest single advantage would lie in the
fact that you can achieve greater information density with trinary
encoding than with binary encoding...an equivalent number of storage
units would store information with a 50% greater density in trinary
than binary. (Thiat would allow you to use, say, six-trit "trytes"
instead of eight-bit bytes, or simply to use an eight-trit tryte and
code more information per tryte.) Obviously, the machine's instruction
set could be larger and still use only single-tryte instructions
(you could get an instruction set almost as rich as the Z-80's
without resorting to two and three tryte instructions.)
   "Not" operators and other Boolean operators obviously wouldn't apply
to trinary arithmetic; obviously, you'd have to invent a new symbolic
algebra for dealing with trinary. (I like the "greater of" and "lesser
of" operators, by the way.) Many of Watts' objections simply aren't
valid, since he was attempting to make binary operators work in trinary.
Instead of a "compare" and "jump if zero" instruction sequence, for
example, you would probably get (as you pointed out) a "compare" and
"jump if less than/equal/greater than." (I could point out to Watts that
this would save programming effort...in current systems, in order to
compare magnitudes you have to use both the zero and carry flags: after
a compare, the zero flag is set (and the carry is irrelevant) if they
are equal; otherwise, the carry is set for A<n and reset for A>n...)

"Bambi" is a fairly good movie, but not as good as what I've seen of
"Fantasia" (never seen the entire thing; I keep waiting in vain for
it to be re-released...) "The Land Before Time" looks entirely too...
cute for my tastes. The animation in it is amazing, even if some of the
effects remind me very strongly of the video game "Dragon's Lair" (not
surprising, since they were both animated by Don Bluth, who incidentally
has a /new/ movie out now...) As far as touching, sentimental films
go, though, "Blade Runner" and "Alien" are more my cup of tea.

How exactly do you plan to model this thing, anyway? You can certainly
store the trits as a series of bits with X bits representing Y trits,
but man, would the algorithm for extracting a trit stream from a bit
stream be beastly! If you're only going to emulate a 4-trit micro-
processor with limited memory, it might be better to use a simple
two-bits-equals-one-trit scheme. Sure it'll waste prodigious amounts of
memory, but if you're modeling a 1 kilotrit machine on a 640 kilobyte
computer, so what? It will speed things up enormously and make the
program MUCH simpler to write. I'd only worry about more efficient
storage if I were modeling a /big/ trinary computer, and doing it in
assembly so encoding and decoding trinary digits would still be
fast.

The Land Before Time, like everything Don Bluth has ever done, was

My thoughts exactly. But -- and here's the real question -- would it
really be possible to shrink a trinary machine to the size that 
microchips are headed? (There's talk of using the spins of individual
atoms as the binary mechanism; not much chance of changing that to
trinary.)
   I was (and still am) a bit sick at the time, so I may not have
explained myself perfectly clearly. I realized that standard binary
logic would not work in a trinary machine, so I "invented" new operators
that would do the work of AND and OR of stripping trytes. (And they
keep much of the original flavor of AND and OR!) I was saying that
there would probably NOT be a logical way to transfer a computer
scientist's idea of NOT into a trinary machine.

Eight bits = Five trits isn't all THAT hard for a computer to figure
out; if you have memory to waste, use a 243-place table in memory.
(In the interests of speed, you'd probably need 486 bytes for the
table.) If one were to simulate a large trit machine, using a table 
would waste only a little bit of memory (instead of wasting four
bits for every trit), and still run relatively fast. (It might lose
maybe a few clicks looking up the equivalents...) Even in a three-K
simulated tryt machine, the simulation with table will use less memory
than yours.

Me? Subversive? Not recently. (I have been seen comparing Dan Quayle

has been tapped is that I run a bulletin board system...no doubt
somebody somewhere thinks I'm operating a phreakers or hackers system
or some such rot. (Or it's kosher in Florida to tap BBS's for the
hell of it...which wouldn't really surprise me; Florida is one of
the strictest states in the country when it comes to bulletin board
regulation. There's a list of laws as long as your arm concerning
how you can and can't run a BBS in this country, and they all end with
things like "Failure to comply with this law may result in a 10-year
prison sentence and a $25,000 fine.") Anyway, it's a fairly annoying
state of affairs; I was one UNHAPPY reptile when I verified that my
phone is indeed being monitored.

Two answers:
1) I imagine the BBS laws are available at any city records office; I
   /believe/ that is where one picks up copies of state laws.
2) Well, I suspected my phone was being tapped when I lost a dial
   tone one morning at 3 AM but still had voltage on the line; that
   simply doesn't happen. So Bart Fox was kind enough to play around
   with it for a bit, and coerced it into producing a funny tone that
   indicated the line was indeed tapped...with a tap that resonates
   at the frequency I was hearing. Since then I have been plagued by
   "double-clicks" (a sound like an extension being picked up, sort of)
   every now and then when I place a call, and other minor bits of
   randomness that annoy me no end.

Well, it uses serial ports for the terminals, and special controllers
for any mass storage devices it may have. It also has a 9600-baud
132-column line printer that uses a funky 50-pin connector...Its
speed against a PC would depend heavily on what kind of job it was doing
and how many active terminals it was keeping track of. (Under RSX/11M,
the thing is capable of running 128 jobs simultaneously!) It'd be

Bugs Bunny flying to the North Pole, getting involved in a plane wreck,
and finding an underground civilization where everyone used gold for
EVERYTHING. The book was about 4" by 5" and about 3" thick...it only had
maybe 50 words printed on each page. The most remarkable thing about
it was this really amazing flip-it cartoon in the corner..since the book
was pretty near a thousand pages, it was a /long/ cartoon (even flipping
at top speed). Can't remember what it was called or where it disappeared

retreat into ones shell (no offense, Turtle), while writing in all
capitals gives the impression of one trying to bulldoze through life
without waiting for other people's feelings. The proper mixture of the
two implies a healthy mind, devoid of either inferiority or superiority
complexes (which, of course, are the same thing.)

Personally, I believe those who are tapping your board should log on,
just for the heck of it. They've already seen that this board is not
a phreaker's board. Yes, it's a hacker's board -- in the old sense of
the word. We're not interested in destroying other computer systems;
our technical talks have been about building new systems (or improving
old ones...)

Does anyone out there know for certain whether dolphin red blood cells
have a nucleus? If you do, please respond and note your reference
source. The reason for this request is for a research project (so far,

 The light from the doorway is now blocked by a large bear, and four
smaller bears, two of them wait outside, near the door. The large bear 
spots Stripe and his hand edges closer to one of his guns. the two brown
bears sit at the bar, facing Stripe. Enter Benn, loan bear, extortionist
, murderer, stagecoach hiester. He runs the illegal outfits in town, 
prostitution, casino rigging.. from his own little casino on the outside
of town. His hoods 'convince' people they should stop at his casino...
(The authorities haven't been able to connect him to these crimes...
 this echoes an old west 'morph Al Copone huh? haha) He approaches 
Butch and drops some money onto the piano,and noone hears their 
conversation about the stagecoach hitting town soon...

Reminds me of this Cyber 760 I had the misfortune to use for a time.
Its greatest claim to fame was the ability to run 90 terminals at once,
each of them doing several jobs; but when more than about 10 people
were logged on it got   r e a l   s l o w. Took me 15 minutes just
to log on once...no exaggeration, I timed it. And NOS has got to be
the most pathetic O/S I've ever seen...it doesn't even know XON-XOFF.
Just keeps sending "Please Wait" when it wants you to slow down, and
ignores any ^S characters in its input stream. (Yeech! Hate it hate

Stripe looks up as the bear enters the tavern, with a decidedly ugly
expression. "You get out of this tavern right now," he says very, very
quietly through gritted teeth, rising slowly from the bar. "I am in no
mood to deal with you or your cronies, and I WILL NOT have you causing
problems in my town. Especially not today. I'm going to be real friendly
and give you fair warning...if you want to keep your mangy, flea-ridden
body in one piece, take it out of my sight before it gets damaged."
His conversation with Talon seems to have faded into the background
as the raccoon glares at the bear with a go-ahead-make-my-day look.

   Seeing Benn, Emilio, and Louie enter the bar, Roc' decided that
was the best place to be. He dropped his cigarette, stomped it out,
and entered the bar.
   The four were sitting down around a table, with Stripe looking
uncomfortably surrounded. Heck -- Stripe might be the best shot in
town, but anyone can be out-shot when it's three against one.
   When Ben pulled out a deck of cards, Roc' pulled up a chair between
Stripe and Louie. "Deal me in," he says. Stripe glares at Roc', but
says nothing.

  To digress; another neat thing about 40's comics were those neat 
one page text inserts a lot of them had. A mini story-no pictures
sandwiched between two normal stories.
  One of remembered favoriteswas a clown called Jon Jarl. ( of the Space
Patrol - I shit you not )  who was featured in every issue of PLANET 
comics. Sometimes his tales kind of interspersed with the flagship story
of PLANET, which was 'The Lost World'  a pretty damn good story, conside
