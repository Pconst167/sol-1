I get your point about the Illiad but the copies that we have are 
acknowledged to be copies.  We also believe in the existence of Socrates
even though we only have ONE piece of text that asserts his existence!
Now are scientists and philossophers that naive?  Of course not.  You
acknowledge that the Old Testament is much older than 2000 years.  
Correct almost 4500 years old by our best dating methods.  The Old 
Testament documents God's dealings with His creations and the fact that
we "drifted" away from a close relationship with him.  It also points 
to the solution to the problem which is what the New Testanment document
I get kinda tired of people saying that the entire text of the Old
Testament is subject to doubt.  As far as authenticity (ie not a 
fabrication by a later generation or an outside group) it is the best
documented book ever.  The subject matter is what is in doubt in many 
peoples minds.  Ok - that is faith.  The point that I like to make is ]
that in this well authenticated book there are certain claims made that
jive with the real world.  Nah - I really don't hsve the time to
delve into the predictions or whatever.  Really I'm kind of tired of 
this discussion because most of the folks involved aren't interested
in pursuing any sort of philosophical or truth-seeking sort of discus-
sion --- they simply want to argue their point blindly.  Oh yeah back
to the point I started to make - we have copies of Old testament books
that are dated to the time they were actually written (ie originals or
near enough)  which we cannot claim for most Greek and Roman works.
Hell even Shakespeare's stuff is in doubt as to the author!!

Dear Lady - you really have hit a major part of it square on the head.
God really isn't an abstract concept to be bandied around with an
expectation of learning anything (if it happens - great!  Just don't
expect it).  Religion is a very personal thing that to truly get 
comfortable with - you have to ask yourself questions and then look
for answers.  Maybe it sound kind of stupid - but I think Chip will
agree with me that religion is merely a political manifestation of
belief.  In other words if we are all gonna get along we need some rules
Thus I believe most are inherently wrong to various degrees.  Your 
relationship to God is actually a personal one that you must develop
on your own, within your own framework.
BTW when ya wanna get together?  Ever been to Mulcahey's AKA the 
Doghouse?  I usually haunt the place Mondays (Buffalo Wings nite!)
and Wednesday (Taco Nite).  Sometimes I can drag along the guy I work 
with - but I go to just eat and relax.

If 2000 years from now somebody had a perfect copy of "Stranger in a

give for the OT.  As for people here "simply want[ing] to argue their
point blindly" and not being interested in philosophy, I disagree.  If
you'll notice, most people's objections to your arguments don't come
from Biblical historical accuracy or lack thereof, but from the
underlying beliefs that Christianity is based on (or the beliefs that
most Christians act on, as the two are not necessarily identical).  It
would seem that out of all the debaters, excepting C.C.A., you are the
very one most open to the accusation you're making.  As a former New

Well, actually, I /did/ know who Dejah Thoris was once, but seem to have
forgotten.  Flash Gordon's girlfriend?  Or am I in the wrong serial?
   Dejah Thoris, or something very close to that (maybe Delilah, now
that I think about it--no, it was Dejah), was also the girl the player's
character was trying to rescue in Automated Simulations' 1980 computer
game "Rescue at Rigel", which still stands as one of the best spacegoing
computer RPG's written to date.  Automated Simulations later changed
their name to their most famous "imprint"--Epyx--and started producing
goop; their two best programmers left and formed Freefall Associates,
responsible for Archon I and II and, very recently, a new RPG from
Electronic Arts which looks very promising.
   I may not know 1930's serials, but I know obscure computer games
real well.

The Wyvern's Den is a pub occupying the first floor of an old three-
story building in downtown Raneadhros, the city-state capital of the
Ranean Empire.  The Den is run by an irascible, cigar-chomping balding
fat man named Donthen Varinn, who is said to be a retired wizard,
although few people have seen him do more than parlour tricks.  The
assistant barkeep is another human named Xonzoff, who may or may not be
Donthen's apprentice.
   Ranea itself exists on	 a world that straddles a pecularity in the
time-space continuum (that's right, not a singularity, a peculiarity).
Many dimensions exist in the universe--some with worlds very similar to
our own, some almost unrecognizably different.  All of these dimensions
"touch" at one, and only one point.  That point is the dimension where
Ranea sits.  From Ranea, it is possible to cross into any of the other
dimensions (with the appropriate magic/technology, of course); from the
other dimensions, you can only get to Ranea.  Many, or most, travellers
don't realize they are crossing through Ranea's plane of existence in
cross-dimensional travel... unless, of course, something goes wrong.
When it does, they usually end up there.
    Ranea itself exists on a world whose only native races (as far as
anyone can tell) are humans and the mysterious, magical Sidhe.  Over
the centuries, hundreds of other races have arrived here, either by
space or dimensional travel.  These races run the gamut from what we
would call elves and dwarves to "furries" (highly evolved, sapient
animals, usually bipedal and built quite similarly to humans, albeit
with pointed ears and fur), and occasionally to more off-the-wall types.
---
"Ranean Tales" is a free-form role-playing game where participants have
characters, but there is no referee.  The world has appeared in stories
in "FurVersion" and shortly in "YARF!" and this storyboard existed on my
own BBS, "The Wyvern's Den", for about a year.  Well, we're back.
I'll be posting "catch-up" summaries shortly.

Dear Turtle,
   In a sense, you're absolutely right: Christianity doesn't force any
moral code on its believers. But, it's easy to overlay just about any
moral code onto it.
   "If you love Me, follow My commandments" is a really wonderful 
general clause with which one can do almost anything. If it's Eco-
Christianity one wants, add Genesis 2:26-28 (about man's dominion over
the earth) and take off from there, adding verses about being a
"good steward" ("It is required that those who have been given a trust
must prove faithful." -- I Co 4:2), and such... Voila! Instant Eco-
cChristianity (tm) (Just add water.)
      
    Then again, almost any other moral system can be gotten from other
passages of Scripture... (especially if one uses verses from Eccles-
iastes.)

Dear Jonboy,
   As to some of your claims and comments:
     1. I am willing to "pursue philosphical or truth-seeking dis-
        cussions." As I've said, I have doubts about my religion which
        I'd like to clear up. BUT -- I'm sick of meeting people who
        ask me to have an open mind, and keep theirs closed if I point
        out valid objections.
     2. Although only one piece of text asserts Socrates' existence,
        it's, umm... a rather lengthy piece of text. (How long does 
        Plato rave about his master?) Then again, you would have to
        say exactly the same things about characters of the Bible...
     3. The "original" Illiad never existed: Homer was most likely
        illiterate. 
     
  Breaking off for a second, most Christians claim that the Bible (OT an
NT) is the Spoken Word of God, and that every single word comes directly
from God. Though the Illiad and the works of Plato have a longer time
between the original copies and what we have, variations aren't that
important.
     
      4. I don't believe we actually have copies of the OT from that
         early. I recall that the Dead Sea Scrolls were a thousand years
         older than any of the previously known OT manuscripts -- and
         they date from about 100 B.C.
      5. The prophecies are a doubtful way of "proving" the OT. If
         you don't believe me, read some of the early Martin Gardner.
         ("The prophecies that succeed are remembered. The ones that
         fail, aren't." Also, people have an incredible ability to
         "read into" prophecy.)
      6. Is Shakespeare's authorage really in doubt? Only by a very
         few crackpots. There's enough documentation about Shakespeare's
         life to know he wrote the plays.

Mr. Donthen-
    Thhhhhhhpt on you. "Rescue on Rigelis" (pre-released name "Rescue
on Fractilis") was created by a subsidiary of LucasFilm. They made
exactly two games: "Rescue" and some excellent 3-d soccer game which
I can't remember the name of. They were released FIRST for the Atari
home computers... (In fact, when they came out, there was a cash
prize for the first to send a copy of the game to the company: they
were that certain the program was unpirateable. Unfortunately, there
were some pre-publication copies that had escaped LucasGames, and it
died real quickly...)
   Unfortunately, due to the overwhelming number of Atari pirates,
Rescue and BallBlazer (that's the name!) made a tiny profit -- or no
profit at all. The rights to the games were sold to Epyx.
     
   Hmph! Next thing I know, you'll be telling me that the CrystalWare
games were originally Epyx...

That was by John Muir *publishing*, if I recall.  The John Muir that it

followers was a man named Edward Abbey, who wrote a book called "The
Monkeywrench Gang" that made "monkeywrench" into a transitive verb, as
in the title of the book you refer to) died in the early 1900's, long
before either credit cards or underground comics were around.  He did
contribute greatly to the formation of the Sierra Club and the U.S.

Well, you're wrong.  "Rescue at Rigel" is NOT the same as "Rescue on
Fractalus."  "Rigel" was the first game in the "Starquest" series, a
companion to Epyx's "Dunjonquest" game series.  It used a similar
display and command system to the Dunjonquest games (unlike the other
game in "Starquest," which was a lot closer to "Crush, Crumble and
Chomp"--I think it was called "Star Warrior").  "Rescue at Rigel"
predates "Fractalus" by at least four years and is a straight RPG,
plot and all, unlike Lucasfilm's insipid arcade game.  I used to OWN
both "Rigel" and "Star Warrior," in legimate copies, no less--Automated
Simulations was one of the few companies that produced stuff I was
willing to pay money for.  Their $25 "Temple of Apshai" and sequel,
"Hellfire Warrior", still stand as the two best real-time graphic
fantasy games written, as far as I'm concerned.
   At any rate, make sure you have your facts straight before trying to
rag me about computer game history.  Just because both games start with
the word "Rescue" does not make them remotely similar.

The Wyvern's Den opened for business about an hour ago, after some
rather nasty business last night involving two murders.  One of them
was a mad sorcerer married to Angel, a possibly immortal bard who may
or may not possess a Cockney accent; the other one was a cat morph who
looked like a skunk [for the uninformed, "morph" and "furry" are both
terms, informal and even less formal, for anthropomorphic, fully
sapient animals].  Captain Mulligan, the Ranean Guard officer assigned
to investigate the murders, took away the ambassador for Crickersworld,
the man who killed Angel's ex-husband; he came back this morning to
get cold-cocked by Lt. "Acapulco" Gold, a dimensional traveller from
what appears to be a future Earth.  Lt. Gold came to Ranea by mistake
and as yet isn't convinced that everything in the Wyvern's Den isn't
an illusion.  Meanwhile, some of the regulars--including Chip P.
Unicorn, ambassador from some planet of horned horses, and Turtle, a
hyperactive morph turtle with a somewhat limited attention span, have
also shown up.  Angel herself left hurriedly a few minutes ago, much to
the dismay of Wezip, a fox morph who developed quite an affection for
her throughout the events of last night.
    Meanwhile, a recap of the last few messages, retyped in excruciating
slowness by yours truly:
----
    Donthen, under extreme pressure, goes slightly beserk when Gold
announces he's knocked out Mulligan.  He charges the Sgt. (whoops, not
Lt.--so sue me) with a broom, but is stopped by Wezip, who knocks all
his wind out.  Turtle endears himself to the barkeep by saying something
stupid; Donthen wants to make him into an ashtray.
    Gold apologizes for any trouble he may have caused and decides that
he might want to do a little "research."  Meanwhile, a fifteen-year-old
girl wanders through the door, asks for help, and faints.  Chip points
out that firearms are illegal on Ranea and Gold might want to hide his.

    Turtle, who had been listening to Chip tell everyone how he had been
recalled by his embassy, is distracted by Donthen's broom-waving and
Gold's gun.  He responds to the gun by telling a rambling story about
a Metallica concert and a man yelling something about his grandmother
crawling up his leg with a knife in her teeth; then he goes over to the
girl and picks her up.  She recovers, shocked by the fact she's being
carried by a reptile, but introduces herself as Deva.  Acapulco puts his
.45 in his holster and stashes it in a portable hole Xonzoff produces,
much to Gold's bewilderment; Gold says he's from Michigan and asks
for a Bud light.  Chip thinks he's talking about flowers.
   Meanwhile, Turtle calms down Deva, who is about 19 years old and from
somewhere offworld, and is trying to remember something about someone
(or something) named "Greywing."  She remembers, finally, that Greywing
is the name of a spaceship she was on; they had tried a dimensional
travel system, and she ended up... here.  She stops talking, presses her
fingers to her head, and starts glowing pink.  Chip, wandering back to
Acapulco, deduces that the sergeant doesn't believe in magic.  The
sergeant, for his part, decides that Chip is a delusion, along with all
the other talking animals.
   Turtle starts bouncing up and down at Gold's references to "the Team"
and "classified information" and correctly guesses (apparently) how Gold
got here, to which Gold makes no reply.
   Xonzoff brings coffee to Gold, telling him that magic and technology
are not exclusive; the man seems skeptical.  Then he goes over to
Mulligan, who was brought inside the pub but is still unconscious.
   At this point, Mulligan sits up and blinks, focusses on Turtle, then
on Gold, then on Donthen, who is now sitting quietly on a barstool,
calm except for an occasional twitch in his left eyebrow.  He asks 
Donthen for a reasonable explanation of what's going on, which the
barkeep is unable to supply.

   Mulligan examines Gold's uniform, deduces it's from offworld, and
further assumes that Gold arrived by non-standard means (i.e., not
through official channels).  This, he decides, places Gold as the one
most likely to have knocked him out, because he's the least likely to
recognize the Guard as a theoretically beneficial police force and most
likely to assume uniform = possible threat.  He introduces himself to
Gold.  Gold returns the favor, trying to look as non-threatening as
possible.
   Someone named Lord Valar comes in the story, starts making goo-goo
eyes at Deva, and they wander off together never to be seen again for
practical purposes, as Valar doesn't call here and Deva moved to Nevada.
   Mulligan explains the concept of dimensional displacement to Gold;
Gold admits it's kind of logical but still seems skeptical.
   Angel comes through the door without speaking, instead guiding a
group of three or four men who proceed to set up a piano, much to
Donthen's consternation.  Turtle makes the observation that the barkeep
is turning a funny shade of red again.  Angel puts a paper roll into the
piano, evidently a player model, and "Feelings" starts playing.  She
gets a pained expression and rips it out.  As everyone seems to be
preoccupied, she gets herself a drink.  Chip gets some sort of message
about a shape-changing something that eats people, and unicorns too.
   Donthen crosses over to Angel and says, "I can't help but notice
you've brought a large, ugly musical instrument into my tavern."  She
whirls on him and spews, "This is the finest I could find in this
miserable little town.  I wouldn't settle for some tinny, second-rate
pian o.  NO!  Nothing but the best would do for my heroes.  You
miserable little twerp!  Hah!  Men!  And Turtles, too!"  Donthen turns
a dramatic shade of purple, looks like he's about to say something, and
then walks behind the bar and out of sight with a peculiarly baffled
expression.

    Certain religeons are more painfull to deal with than others,  but
certain realigions such as born again are just plain a pain in the ass.
I believe in freedom of religion, as long as it does not harm someone
else... Walden, Witman, ect. all.  One of the least harmfull are the
Wikka (sp.)  And I don't mean to pick on any one group, but I believe
born again christians, and christian scientists are the most harmfull.
Many christian scientist's don't believe in MDs.  There have been 
several cases where their children have died of illness because they
would not take their childdren to the Doctor.  Sacrificial lambs I
guess.  Now the problem with Born again christians is that the church
tries to influence our goverment and us.  There should be a seperation
of church and state.  I know that that is not completely possible, but
every one should do their best.  I have dated many women (and girls) of
different religeons, including Born Again, Jahova Witnesses and a
(supposed) witch, a catholic, and a protestant.  My stepfather is a
Reincarnationist and my mother is an Episcipal.  Myself, I am Agnostic.
I believe that when it's time, I will find my own personal god.  And
I will not force him or her on anyone.  Discussion is fine.  In fact
without anyone elses view, we all would live in a very ignorant world.
I'm glad you believe in reincarnation.  In fact, I think that every
one should be what, and who they want.  As long as they harm no one 
and persecute no one else!
     If you want to find God, perhaps you should look at nature.  It
might be refreshing, unless there is a smog alert.

    There's a huge difference between Christianity -- the personal
belief in Christ as "Savior from Sin" -- and the Christian Church.
Granted: the Church has been extremely political throughout history.
But -- the personal belief has never had to do with politics... in
fact, the Bible indicates that one should be content no matter which
political system you live in...

"Render unto Ceasar what is Ceasar's," hmm? The Jehovah's Witnesses in
particular take that particular commandment to believe that it is
actually wrong for any "true Christian" ("true" being defines as 
"believing the way we do," I imagine) to participate in any political
activity at all that's more involved than voting. True Christians of
the born-again variety, on the other hand, generally seem to believe
that that particular commandment has about as much relevance as a dead

in question. Ahh, the political complexes of a slave religion...

What the hell dictionary are /you/ using, Chip? The Random House
Dictionary in my lap right now defines "Pagan" as "One of a people
or community professing a polytheistic religion; a person who
is not a Christian, Jew, or Muslim." Interestingly, it also defines
"Pagan" as "an irreligious or hedonistic person," meaning (I guess)
that it's possible to be an atheistic Pagan, something I find

Generally, one becomes a "hacker" when someone who is already a hacker
says "Dude! You're a pretty good hacker!" In any event, anyone who
has ever (1) written an operating system; (2) hand-assembled a piece
of code because it's faster than using an assembler; (3) disassembled
someone else's operating system to see how it works; (4) written
an assembler because he thought the ones on the market weren't
good enough for his own use; (6) ported uucp or yacc or something
equally ridiculous over to the Timex-Sinclair or some other equally
ridiculous platform; (7) ported Unix over to some ridiculous
platform; (8) written a routine to give him access to operating system
core in FORTRAN-66; or any similar feat along those lines, is probably
a hacker regardless of whether he's had the title conferred to him or
not. In any event, the driving force behind the hacker mentality is that
nothing should stand between him and full use of the computer he's on--
which is why hackers /never/ delete other people's files, damage the
operating system, lock other people out of the computer, or crash
computer systems; after all, if you've just formatted all the hard

I wouldn't call that a terribly covert activity, although I'm not
sure I'd call it an attack either. On the other hand, the Pope did have
the monumental gall to travel to Ethopia in 1988 and tell the people,
starving because in most places their country can't produce enough
food to feed everyone, that birth control is a sin. (Incidentally,
that one won the Non-Sequitur of the Year Award for 1988. (I have to
wonder why so many Non-Sequitur of the Year Awards go to religious
statements...I've only been keeping them since 1985, and three of them
so far have gone to statements of religious faith...))
   On the other hand, to be perfectly fair I have to admit that the
actions of people who claim to be Christians does not necessarily
have any bearing on the validity of the Christian faith. People who
profess to be one thing while actually being something else have been
around for a long time.

At the top of my objections to Riker is the fact that he's just too
damn pretty (but not as gorgeous as he thinks he is).  That face
needs to be mauled or scarred.  And for heaven's sake keep any

Okay, here's what I've been able to find since yesterday re: oldest
surviving biblical manuscripts...
 
Prior to the Qumran (Dead Sea Scrolls) discoveries, oldest Old 
Testament manuscripts was the Leningrad manuscript of the prophets,
dated A.D. 916.
Oldest surviving New Testaments are the Codex Sinaiticus and
Vaticanus (both approximately A.D. 340).
Oldest surviving fragment of New Testament is a portin of Gospel
of John coming from Egypt, usually dated before A.D. 150.
 
What has so far been identified from Qumran are manuscripts dating
from between 200 B.C. and A.D. 68.  Portions of all Old Testament
Books except for Esther have been found at Qumran.  One fragment of
the Book of Leviticus tentatively dating back to the 5th century
B.C. was also discovered there.  The Leviticus fragment may be the
oldest Biblical manuscript in existence.
  
Okay, that's what I was able to come up with.  Have you got some
more current information, or perhaps a few 'original' versions
of the gospels or the Pentatuech in your attic?  
     As far as Biblical scholars are concerned, there are at least
several centuries seperating our extant copies of Biblical texts
from the 'originals'.

Don't get me wrong, Kirk had some good points. After all, he did save 
the earth, the federation,this dimension and the entire universe at 
least half a dozen times. On the other hand, he's been duplicatied,
replicated, possessed, lost in space, split in half, had his mind 
float around in a lava lamp and made to wear an ugly dress while
inhabiting a womans body. Toss in the times he had to wear belts\
wristbands/collars of control (SILENCE, THRALL!) and you'd have to
be a god (or at least a Danish frost giant) to not go off the deep
end.

Well, "Total Recall" is directed by Paul Voerhoven ("Robocop"), written
by Dan O'Bannon & Ronald Shussett ("Alien", "Dark Star") and based on
a novel by Piers Anthony which was, in turn, an expansion of a Philip
K. Dick story called "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale."
Schwartzenhefferhooferheifer has proven he can be a good actor when he
doesn't get a chance to be involved with the script (even more so when
he doesn't get to say anything, like "Terminator", which wasn't really
an Arnie S. movie despite his top billing); with people like that
behind him--especially Voerhoven, who seems about as likely to knuckle
under to a star as David Lynch would be--it has a lot of promise.  It
has a good chance, in fact, of going completely over the heads of the
normal action/adventure audience and disappearing pretty quickly for a
big budget, big name flick.

Dear Spellwind,
   Romania has been suddenly invaded by Christians? (Incredulous
glare...) Stop for a second -- for how many hundreds of years has
Christianity been existing in Romania? (At least fifteen hundred --
maybe seventeen or eighteen...) It came real close to having been
visited by Paul... (within one hundred miles, in fact...)
   My point: if anything, the Christians are helping bring back the
culture that was taken away by the Russians' invasion of about
fifty years ago...
      
                  Chip P. Unicorn
     
   Yes -- I know. It's probably a different kind of Christianity than
what they had fifty years ago... But from it, they can easily re-
construct -- and pick and choose.

No need to be concerned, no new violent streak has appeared ... I want

long since given up trying to diagnose weird problems IBM users have
this board--half the users I talk to have all sorts of bizzare problems
that seem to be confined to the world of MS-DOS, for reasons that
are remarkable in their crystalline opacity. Just at a guess, I'd say
you didn't have Telix set to 8N1 (8-bit words, no parity, one
stop bit), but I dunno. Several users here use Telix without difficulty,
though, so the problem shouldn't be a terminal one...

was how they were going to send so and so to DC to rally for
anti-abortion.  And when a president of the united states claims
to be born again, I think it's gon a little to far.  Free speach

Make sure the baud rate is set for 1200 in the dialing directory, and
comm parameters are set of N-8-1,  your old term may have had auto-buad
detection as the default.. you can turn it on again in telix if you like
-- it's turned off so poeple with high speed modems locked at 9600 buad
won't have problems.. anyway, to turn it on:
 
  Hit Alt - O  (For options)
  Select "Modem and dialing"
  Hit 'M' for Auto Baud detect
  Change to 'Yes' and telix will set the current baud by reading the 
'Conect xxx' string. 
 
BTW I assume you're using Telix 3.12 - if you're not, call The Shadow @

The New Age philosophy seems to be, "Well, maybe if we all worship
whoever we want, then maybe we can all call it a religon." Nice "feel-
good" idea -- but terrible if you want some meat mixed in with the
milk and honey.
   The problem I've had (yes -- this was even before I moved in with
Todd) with B.A.C's is that they might have SOME basis for their 
religion -- the Bible -- which they insist is provably true, and never
examine the facts closely enough to check their proofs.

Give Wesley a break already.  He stopped being a twit at the end of the
first season (when Wil Wheaton went to the producers and said "if my
character saves the Enterprise once more, I'm leaving"), and has, on
occasion, shown signs of being a pretty interesting character--on most
of the shows of this season when he's had anything to do, in fact, and
on the episode where he and Picard had to travel to the same planet in a
shuttlecraft.  Wesley is more of an actual CHARACTER than Tasha Yar
ever was -- the only episode she ever did anything interesting in was
after she was dead, and that episode wasn't good because of any dramatic
revelations about her: when your character is cardboard, you can't look
into it too deeply by definition....

No, I said I was confused.  I never really did the Barsoom thing, to use
a Turtle-ism, so it's not something that would come to mind all that

Golden Age of sf?  _Burroughs?_  Next thing you'll be telling me that
Hugo Gernsback did a GOOD THING for the field by starting to publish it
in his predecessor to Radio-Electronics, and firmly establishing it in
the "penny dreadful" writing category with cheap printing, lurid covers,
and a pulp image it's still fighting to escape from some sixty years
later.  And what did sf fen do?  They went and named the third most
important sf award after him (behind the Nebula and the Campbell award,
at least in my ranking).  For the sort of thing ERB was writing, it's
really good, but it's still barbaric fantasy ala Conan in sf trappings.
Olaf Stapledon, Ward Moore, Alfred Bester, Ted Sturgeon--these were the
ones pushing sf's envelope forward.  Stapledon was doing it at the same
time Asimov was starting his writing engine with the first "Foundation"
books, too.
 
P.S.: and if you're looking for barbaric fantasy, Fritz Leiber still did
it better with "Fafhrd & Grey Mouser" than Burroughs & Howard could have
done in a collaboration.

Nahhh - sorry Donthen - I really *am* tired as hell this week and have
been boogiing trying to keep from getting too far behind on the board.
I undferstand all the problems that people have with Christianity.
#1  - It really is a free lunch in the respect works can't buy you
into heaven
#2  - Just because of #1 don't get the idea that you can get away with 
murder - you develop an excruciating consciencve that bothers you if
you are naughty.
#3  - The whole story is one of faith - don't just look at one small
part and say "it ain't true!".  The story is 4000 years old with
a very consistent "plot" and a dramatic ending.  It's pretty tuff to
keep a fake philosophy going that long over that many authors.  And
what is so bad about the message?  You don't need to end it here.
Believe in Jesus - who preached brotherhood and love for your fellow man
and yu will live forever.  So what eternal flames is the other route?
As a non-believer the option is a void.  What is worse?

I associate myself with liberals, Michael Dukakis not withstanding.  Not
necessarily with Jane Fonda; a lot of liberals are idiotic, I just think
there are proportionately less idiotic liberals than idiotic
conservatives.  Even so, I refuse to buy the Jane Fonda = Antichrist
line a lot of people have tried to hand me (on several BBS's, no less),
and I've also never seen why people can't separate an artist's (i.e.,
writer, illustrator, actor, whatever) work from the artist's personality
or politics.  Even if Fonda had done most of the things she's accused
of (there's evidence for about half the stories people spew, if that)
and was completely unrepentant and hadn't changed her mind about
anything as far as political ethics go (which she has, publicly, but
people like to forget that, too), it has absolutely no relation on how
well she can act.

> It's pretty tough to keep a fake philosophy going that long over that
> many authors.
 
It's not the philosophy that most people have problems with, it's the
practice -- and, also, the central tenet that unless you believe the
Supreme Being not only exists but became incarnate, was killed as a
criminal, rose from the dead and in doing so, absolved everybody else of
all their sins as long as they truly believe in the preceding premises,
that a lot of people (myself included) have problems with.  I am not
comfortable with a scapegoat, divinely ordained or not.
    Also, of course, it could be pointed out that Wicca, Buddhism,
and Shintoism all have followers today -- the total number most likely
exceeding all the Christians -- and each of those theologies have been
around over 4000 years, through just as many authors.  If that quote
above can be used to support Christianity, it can be used to support the
others equally facilely.
    And, no, the idea of an afterlife isn't somehow "bad."  It can be
accused, however, of being a cosmic dog cookie: follow us and you'll be
rewarded with eternal life.  This is followed with the cosmic dog
paddle: if you don't, you'll be punished with eternal damnation.  A
truly cynical analysis of a theology that effectively sold itself that
way would, perhaps, conclude that it used such tactics because its
teachers didn't feel it was attractive enough without a carrot/stick to
"convince" people, something that The Great Cosmic Truth, one would
think, wouldn't have a problem with.  As someone else said on here,
Christians assume all other religions are like spectacles looking at the
Truth with varying degrees of optical accuracy.  They dismiss the notion
that Christianity itself may not be the Truth, but merely one more pair
of glasses.
