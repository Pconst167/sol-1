Without Imagination, this world would get pretty damned boring. The 
trick is to know when you're thinking fantasy or not. Too many people 
can't separate it. They use their imagination and then let it run their 
life. Imagination is a tool we all have, (Hey) it's kind of like a 
Snap-On tool....comes with a lifetime warranty. (shrug). I know, that 
was lame. 
By the way, I like that statement....."Imagination should be exercised, 
not exorcised." Cute!

So they don't think your souls worth saving, eh? They probobly don't

children running and playing in this utopia. (grimace) Give me a break!
One lady actually had the nerve to direct her merry little speech at 
my son, who was 5 at the time. He listened with big eyes as she talked 
about Heaven on Earth, ect, ect. 
My son attends a Baptist Church and it confused him. I don't confess to 
know much about religion so I can't knock 'em out like you do. I wish 
I could have said something "smart" to her, though.... 
Personally, I think there should be a law against door to door salesmen

I agree (Yick) with you. I prefer a one on one conversation to posting. 
I enjoy body language, something lacking in posting or "chat mode". 
It's easy to misunderstand a post without hearing the tone of someones
voice. BUT! It's easier to post certain things when you are basically 
anynomous (so my spelling sucks, sue me). It's easier to start a 
conversation and it's easier to recover from sticking your foot in your 
mouth (something I do often). A shy person could post messages where 
they might not be able to have a open conversation with a stranger. 
And it gets pretty strange around here........

I believe in euthanasia, too. It's a hard subject to debate because both
sides are right. It's like the abortion debate. 
  
If a person is suffering mentally and physically and there's no chance 
for improvement, then I can understand why they might want to end their 
life. If it were me, and someone MADE me live against my will...... 
what kind of life could I have? 
  
I don't believe in this "suicide machine" thing, though. Euthanasia 
should be performed in a controled environment by qualified physicians. 
Not in some van in a driveway......... 
  
Not much of a comparison, but I used to work for a veteranarian. We used
to council people with old pets before they had them put to sleep. It 
was very hard for them to let go. But in many cases (well, in all cases)
the animals quality of life was nil and once the people realized that 
they were hurting their pet more by letting it suffer, they would 
tearfully agree. It was sad, but at the same time, it was the last act 
of love. They said their goodbyes then the animal quietly went to sleep.
It didn't suffer like it would have if it had just been left to slowly 
die day after day.

Really? You know, I've wanted for a long time to talk to someone who
was in the midst of actively considering killing himself--not
necessarily out of any noble aspirations, but because I don't "get"
the mindset you'd have to be in to do something like that. It's kind
of an alien state of mind to me--I don't grok it, I don't under-
stand it, so I'd like to talk to someone who was actually IN it
to see what it's like. Pardon the lack of sensitivity, but
it's hard to sympathize with someone when you have absolutely no
handle whatsoever on what's going through his mind.

Of course there are--but they're less common, since you can read cues
into what the other person is saying. On a BBS, it's difficult to tell
sometimes when the other person is joking, or being sarcastic, or
whatever. I can think of at least one major blowup that happened right
here on A/R (betwixt Angel and Max) that was 100% the result of such
a misunderstanding.

Ding ding ding! That's why so many BBS's don't allow handles and think
that handles would only be used by immature little twits--you go to
a system where most of the users are teenagers or below that
allows handles and all you see is little kids swearing at each other.
It's unfortunate, because there are a lot of otherwise reasonable people
who as a result will not call any system that allows handles. Same
goes for setting up "adult" areas on a BBS--in many cases, it's doomed
to fail. (Give people the right to say what they want and you'll find
many people have nothing to say but insist on saying it in the crudest,
most vulgar way possible). Oh well...I'm glad this system doesn't
suffer from those problems. There's always a counterexample, though.

Well, that kind of reaction is not unusual.  I wouldn't even call it

strain on the support person involved.  I had to call that girl everyday
because, if I didn't I'd start worrying.

I've been calling that system since it was first running on a
Commodore 128 as "Courts of Chaos." Rocky Kinsey (Random, the sysop)
is a friend of mine. I like the software a lot, and I'd like the system
a lot more if some of the users weren't so...sad. (I was moderator of
the Courts of Chaos storyboards once upon a time, and my character ended
up in bed with a six-foot barbarian mouse, but that's another story.)

Nope. Turtle arrived home just scant moments before Mr. Steel got to
the fateful message number. I looked at the screen, read #13332,
figured out what he was up to, and did a nasty. Had I had the monitor
off (as is normally the case) or come home two minutes later...

Because those aren't the first five digits of my lucky number, of

3271225497265020071970960.) The '32712' is significant promarily
because it's the start address of Radio Shack's keyboard debounce

Yeah, but the Amiga in question is running AmigaDOS rather than Unix.
Someone actually ported uucp over to run in the Amiga's native mode.
(Hey, someone wrote a full uucp implementation for CP/M...and he was
making noises on GEnie like he wants to give /me/ the source code
and have me port it over to LS-DOS. Mind you, we're talking ten

Nope - she and Max patched up their differences and worked things out
a while before she vanished. The software company she was working for
dissolved about six months ago leaving her unexpectedly without visible
means of support, though, so that may be why she's not around any more.

STOP THAT! I MEAN IT!  No one, and that includes you, can take the blame
for something they had no control over.  You  could only help her as 
much as SHE would let you.  You couldn't make her put into action 
whatever you advised her to do or not to do.  If she lacked the strength
to do what she knew was right than how can you be responible?  You
couldn't really impart strength.  You could only give support, nothing 
more.  Try comparing it to your children and, let's say, a rainy day. 
You're children want to go out and play, but they can't because it's 
rainy out.  Now, they look to you to fix the weather.  You can't. 
Yes, I'm sure, you feel bad for the children, but are you to blame for 
the weather?  Of course not.  In the same way you're not to blame for 
her taking her own life.  
 If she had called you, which you're not sure if she did or not, if you 
had turned her away, then maybe, you could feel partly responible. 
But you can't be expected to sit home every night in case she called. 
 You did your best.  You did more than most people would have.  Maybe 
your guilty of caring too much, but beyond that, NO WAY!

Crimes of Passion has kind of a lame plot in places but the real
playoff is that Anthony Perkins plays a real twisted sicko street
preacher that is out to "save" the whores - espoecially China Blue
(Kathleen Turner).  The movie is very unique in that the sordid
scenes are very realistic - like the room with peep holes where 
guys can watch the stripper dance - or people make love.
The scene where the business man and his wife pick her up for
a threesome is kinda contrived but funny.  There are a lot of
s
small scenes that make this a really good movie.

We TRS-80 hackers used hex, too, except for when the machine was first
turned on. A familiar sight to TRS-80 hackers is the old familiar
 
Memory Size? _
 
that appeared on power-up; it's BASIC asking how much high memory to
protect for interrupt routines and the like. If you were using
KBFIX (which I was, being one of the lucky ones who got one of the
original bouncy keyboards before Radio Shack fixed the problem) you'd
enter 32712 to protect 55 bytes of high memory for the debounce
routine.

Last I heard that expression went out with AmyDOS 1.2; 1.3 fixed a lot
of the problems and now programs like Gomf can intercept the odd stray
guru and prevent the system from going down in flames due to a stray
hiccup. AmyDOS 2.0 removes the guru completely (thank God)...like it
really matters now that Commodore's decided Unix V.4 and Open Look is
the way to go with their top-end machines.
 
Intuition is still kinda kludgey as GUI's go, though...I'd almost rather

Click! I thought I knew the movie, but now I'm /certain/ I do, although
when Cindy and I rented it it was called "China Blue" rather than
"Crimes of Passion." Same movie, though. I wasn't that impressed with it
although it did have its moments.

applications are the biggest damned programs I've ever seen in my

into the GUI so that you have acess to all those nifty toolbax functions
and Windows manages all the resources like memory - why in the /hell/
are those programs so BIG?????  Seems to me all that's left is pure
program logic with minor calls to external OS hooks.  I have always
maintained that MSDIOS (< intended!) is the most bloated code around
if for no other reason than the necessary code for segment arithmetic.
Ah well - see what ya started!!!

Finally one day I happened to start talking about some mild B&D and

I became obsessed with discovering any kind of new "perversity"

would start to bug me.  He even went to the commander and told him
that I was so sick I should be locked up or kicked out.  I was

Man, you ain't kiddin'. You ever hear of one called "Seven Knots to

different from the Western one--they see it as more of an art form
than a form of recreation. (And I have a weakness for Oriental women,

Yeah, suicide COULD be an ethical discussion but it would always bring 
back bad memories for anyone who's had a close encounter with it. 
Whether directly or not. If you've ever attempted suicide, it's got to 
have been a very dramatic memory and if you
have ever had a loved one who tried or suceeded suicide, well, that's 
pretty tramatic too.

Don't mind the Tandy bashers. There are plenty of them around. There are
also plenty of us who cut our teeth on Tandy's in the early days and
have a strange appreciation for the early models and their simplistic
design and programming. I can remember thinking I was big stuff 'cause 
I had a Model 1 with 16k of RAM and all my friends only had 4k. I was
big stuff back then!!
I was amazed to get a sealed bid notice forwarded to me from the GSA
(Government Services Admin) back home. They are selling off all kinds
of Tandy stuff from all over the northeast sector that was in use in 
govt. offices. Lots of good old memories for sale there.

You REALLY wanna hear this???? 
  
Ok, here goes. After my father died, I took his gun collection down to 
the Bullet Hole in Sarasota to be sold on consignment. Well, after about
a week, the Bullet Hole called me and said they had a buyer. So I hopped
in my Camaro (you know the one, blazing down mainstreet squealing tires)
and went to Bullet hole. The guy at the counter told me to stand by and 
he'd cut me a check. While I'm standing there waiting (spending the 
money in my head) This BIG guy walks in the front door and eyeballs me. 
He (very nonchalontly) walks up by me. He's got this look on his face, 
nervous somehow. The other guy walked out of the back room and nodded to
him, so this big guy grabs me by the shoulder. What did I do? Well, what
do you think.... I kicked the shit out of his knee and pulled away. 
Suddenly there's cops everywhere and the BIG guy has me bent over the 
counter and cuffed. "You have the right to (bullshit speech). 
  
I'm standing there with my nose flattened against the glass counter, 
staring at dead rattlesnakes and this guy is breaking my arms. 
That's no exageration. He finally decided to introduce himself, Detectiv
Fairmont, or Fairchild, hmmmm. something like that. On the way out the 
door, I'm yelling "what did I do???" 
He stuffs me in the car and on the way to the station he's real quiet, 
ignoring my questions. 
Turns out, one of the guns in my Dad's collection was "hot". When they 
checked it, seems it had been stolen from a guy who had been murdered 
during the robbery. The dead guys wife had told the cops that one of the
perpetrators (sp) was a woman. 
Didn't take long to clear things up but what a trip that was. I didn't 
get much of an apology either. "Er, Sorry for the mix up, Mam." 
Then they kept me for hours (and my mom) trying to find out who my dad 
got the gun from.

GR> If you ever want to discuss something on an intelligental level
GR> (without having someone humping your leg /Scott/, just leave me 
GR> a post. 
 
Listen bub.  Saavik and I are very close friends, we just leave the 
/intelligental/ personal topics off the main board.  We converse 
seriously over voice at least twice a week, and write E-mail 
pratically everyday.  
 
As usual, you're spewing in ingorance.  
Also, your very first post I and others found insultive.  (saying that 
the caliber of this board was sub-standard as far as you were concerned)
I, personally love this board and appreciate Turtle's efforts to keep 
it on-line. That me give you some advice, (and this is serious, not 
just retatilation) didn't sign-on your first time to a board and 
insult the board and it's users.  Again, saying to was below your 
standards.

SA> YOU want acces? I thought you were the President of this zany corp. 
SA> Hell, you're the boss, Scott.  You got it. 
  
Well, Turtle gave you the permission to decide who has access, not me. 
So, I thought it would be polite to ask, and not just assume. 
  
Do you want me to decide who gets access?  Or do you wnat a join effort?
Of course, you'll have to clear it with Turtle, but I'm willing to 
take the responsibility, so to speak, for who gets access.

Since this was in reference to someone I don't know that well, I didn't 
it would be right to attempt a reply that would either: A) Slam 
someone about their sexuality or, B) even try to draw a comparison 
(again, hothing to base it on.)

We'll discuss the matter of acess & such in E-mail or by phone but 
we have a lot to decide. I would rather do this as a "joint" venture,

Ah, you were using your bean, sorry, I pushed on that. You are right. 
It's not nice to "slam" anyone, unless it's in fun and they can take 
a joke. Ever notice it's easier to come up with a "slam" when posting 
than make a valid "nice" comment???? 
 
Guess it's that beast inside of me, clawing to get out.
