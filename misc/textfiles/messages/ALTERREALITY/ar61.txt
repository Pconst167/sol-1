Yes, that is certainly true. It's DEMENTED, but it's definitely a
life. :)
 
>And so does Dragonfly...
 
Yep. There are some really fascinating people in the SCA, and there are
plenty of SCA-ians(?) (like Dragonfly) who have lives. Unfortunately,
the SCA has the same problem Dungeons & Dragons does...it acts like a
crutch for people without lives. I've met D&Ders who have no life of
their own; ditto for SCA-ians. And accountants.

Robert leans back in his chair again as Kyara makes her move. "Well,
now, truth be told, the idea of, ahem, 'having you' is fascinating.
Still, that's 'hardly a sporting wager, now, is it? It 'ardly matters
who wins, now, doesn't it?" He advances his king's knight to her king's
knight 4. Almost immediately, she advances her rook's pawn to attack
the knight. "There, you see? Aggression. Splendid!" Robert moves the
knight again, this time bringing it down on Kyara's king's bishop's
pawn. "We still 'haven't discussed terms, though, 'ave we? Should I win
this wager...", he says as he examines her captured pawn, "what might
there be in it for me? And should you prove victorious, 'ow might you
take advantage of your victory?" Robert notices Kyara seems somewhat
frustrated by his two-pronged attack. She hesitates for a moment, then
decides on a queen move, bringing her queen to her king's 1. "A game
this interesting needs stakes. Something to play /for/." That said,
he captures her king's rook with his knight. She responds by attacking
the knight with her queen, bringing it in to her king's bishop 1.
Immediately, Robert moves the knight to Kyara's king's knight 3;
after a brief moment she advances her queen's pawn to queen's 4.
"Tsk," Robert says as he captures the pawn with his king's pawn.
Kyara moves her queen to king's bishop 2. "Persistence," Robert
says, "is an admirable trait. If you want it, it's yours." He shrugs
and moves his king's pawn to her queen's bishop's 3, capturing her
queen's knight. "So," he says as he removes the knight from the playing
field, "the game is wide open. Your move, an' your wager."

  Kyara, not seeing the error that she had made in leaving her queen

powerful piece (meaning the bishop).  She moves her queen from king's

     Robert, for his part, promptly advances his king's pawn again,
capturing Kyara's queen's knight's pawn. He sets the captured piece
carefully next to the other pieces waiting on the sidelines, and
steeples his hands together in front of him. "'ardly seems fair,
negotiating terms when I have the advantage," he says, indicating the
board before them. "Shall we discuss terms? Seems pretty straightforward
so far, victor to 'ave 'is way with the vanquished, yes? For a length
of time to be determined by both parties...shall we say, two days?"
Kyara captures Robert's kings pawn with her queen's bishop as he
continues, "Conditions to be met by the vanquished in bed and out,
naturally." He reaches down without looking at the board and moves his
knight to capture Kyara's king's pawn. Kyara moves her queen from
queen's bishop's 5 to queen's 5; Robert responds with a queen move,
moving his queen from queen's 1 to king's 2. He smiles slightly at
Kyara's evident frustration; she does not appear to realize the position
she is in. Her queen's bishop captures Robert's pawn at his king's
knight's 1; an excellent tactical move, he thinks, if a little late.
With the barest smile, he moves his knight from king's 5 to queen's
bishop's 5. "Check," he says. Nope, she doesn't see the danger of
his attack; she moves her king to queen's 2. Robert's knight captures
Kyara's queen. "'Ave yourself at a bit of a disadvantage 'ere, Mate."
Robert says. "Care to resign the game? Or shall we play for the other
for three days?"

  Kyara moves her pawn from her bishop's 2 to bishop's 3, this way she 
can block Robert's rather imposing queen.  Robert effortlessly moves 
his queen up two spaces and takes Kyara's knight's pawn.  For crying 
out loud, I never got to move the damn thing, she thinks, and to top 
it off he just put me in check again.  She moves the king back to his
starting position.  Robert nonchalantly captures Kyara's rook.  Another 
piece dead where it stands, and again, Kyara's in check.  "Robert, I 
want you to understand something," she begins, "Two days is fine, but 
nothing degrading, like wanting to tie me up.  I won't go for that. 
I assume that, if you win, I'll be your servant as well?  Would you 
consider having that be the terms of the next game?  You have me at 
quite a disadvantage as it stands now."  Seeing that Robert seems to 
be concentrating on the game, yet confident that he did indeed hear her 
she moves her king to king's bishop's two.  Robert moves his king's 
rook over to where the knight started out.  Obviously, he's attacking
my bishop, so she moves it in front of his rook's pawn.   Well, the 
tension of the game has seemed to relaxed some, so she decides to 
ask Robert again, "Robert, how about next game?"

livewd in Utah where the Mormons literally run the state.  It is no
coincidence that there is an Mormon "Institute of Religion" next
to every school in the state.  It is an "optional" class but it is
also widely known as a easy "A" so that most people take advamtange of
it to boost their grades.  Next to the colleges and Universities there
are grown up versions of these same institutes.  Then the other
extreme is where folks that are firm believers in the sciences without
religious faith ridicule, hound and lambast those that are so
"ignorant" and "foolish" to believe in a divine being.  Bahh!  We 
for the most part are at the mercy of opinionated fools whatever

Whoa there Hoss!  Jeez bub - I really hate to be a literary critic

ninja pulling up a raft and starting to eat lunch first.  She complains
about eating fish?  Man the orientals subsist on fish!  That would be
a most unusual thing for an oriental.  Then she stashes her raft and
tries to camoflage it.  In character she would have stashed it first,
surveyed the area, THEN made camp and ate lunch.  As far as relief
at finding a path... in a strange country a path is the LAST thing that
someone that was trained in stealth would consider taking.  Then
you have her ordering steak and eggs and /milk/ in the bar.  Now
personally I have a tough time seeing the steak and eggs but the
milk is a definate faus pas.  Most orientals lack the necessary
enzymes needed to break down milk - it makes them physically ill
to drink milk!  Matter of fact caucasians are the only race that
can consistenly drink milk as adults.  Then before she even eats she
butts in on a partially finished chess game and starts seducing the 
guy even though she has to be pooped.

some things are much more appealing then they at first may sound.

only 17 years of age, in sept. I shall be 18.  Anyways, she has had a

females around here are not mature enough (never thought I would hear me
saying something like that!) and I would really like to have a good one.
But it seems that this has just occured, since I was over there tonight,
and she told me this while we were in the pool together, and BOY, I was
kinda stunned, 'cause I was kinda thinking that she was kidding, but I
guess that we shall have to be together.  BUT I LIKE HER A LOT!  And I
would not really mind being with her the rest of my life, and she asked
me tonight, if I would mind marrying her, and I kinda said, Not really,
'cause I like you a lot, and as I went under, I heard her say 'I would-
n't mind marrying you', although I acted like I didn't hear her.  So, 
anyways, that is my most wonderful story, and I think that I am going to

     To all of you :  I have a serious problem that I would like some
feedback on...I am only 17 years of age, I am going on 18 fairly soon,
and there is this slight problem of me getting a female pregnant, and I
don't know if this is such a good idea, because of the fact that she 
wants to keep this child.  I am in a very intense situation that I am 
not completely ready to handle.  I TRULLY do want a relationship like 
this one, although I am not really sure that it is the right thing to 
do. She is also 17 years of age, and she still thinks that she wants to
keep it.  I have no problem with that, except the fact that /WE/ will 
not be able to run a normal life with a kid.  She asked if I would 
be likely to marry her, and I said, of course, I like you a hell of a 
lot, and I would do anything for you, (as I have before.), and I would
not mind marrying her, except that I think that I am too young, and, I
am not sure of this.  So /PLEASE/ if you have anything (NICE) to say
towards this problem, then please help me out here.  I picked this BBS
because I thought that all of you were very inteligant, and people that
I could concur with.  So please, write me...::sigh::...Thank you...

Well, let me tell you something about Mormons.  FIrst of all, I can;t 
(can't) stand them.  I doesn't surprise me that they would have an easy
A type class just to expose more people to their twisted religion.  
  When I was a strong Christian I was witnessing to this guy I worked 
with.  He was considering Mormonism, and was trying to convert him to 
Christianity.  He asked me if I was willing to meet with him and some 
mormons.  I said that I would and when I got there.  I was facing off 
against three mormons.  Not just your run-of-the-mill mormons, mind 
you, these were ELDERS!  Me, sixteen years old, if that, trying to argue
mormonism with three mormon elders.  The incredible thing was that I 
won.  After I had done some more research, I discovered that the entire 
Book of Mormon (which they believe is even more divinely written than 
the Bible) was supposely written by the seed of Ephraim.  (Ephraim was 
one of the twelve sons of Abraham, who were supposed to lead the Israel-
ite people.)  Well, I found a passage in the Bible that said, "I 
shall cast you out of my sight, you and the entire seed of Ephraim." 
That was God speaking to Ephraim.  Well, I called the mormon elder and 
told him what I had found.  He was like "er.....um.......er......hmmm...
.....er....uh.....well,.....I'm sure there's a explanation for that."
 
He never called again.

My girlfriend and I had the same situation.  She had the test but 
didn't wait long enough and it came out positive.  A little while
later, she looked at it and it was negative.  The test your 
girlfriend had was one of the self quick tests, wasn't it.  If it
was, those things are sometimes have specific directions and if 
you don't do it exactly, it goes out wrong.  If your positive she's
pregnant, and she wants the kid, just stay with her and don't leave
her.  I think it's kinda silly keeping a baby at 17 though.  I'm
not saying that you're wrong or anything(hell, I'm only 1? myself)  but
do you know how much it's going to cost?  What do your parents think of
all this... if they know.  And will they help you with the money and 
everything?  Whatever happens,  I hope you and she are happy toghther

This here message is 15000.  It is the best message as I am typing.
Just because I got it, doesn't mean you cant get the next one.
It took me years of school to learn how to get great messages like this
one. If you try hard enough, you can have anything.  The next good

Well, lesse here. A simple cost/benefit analysis might be in order.
First, Suicide. Disadvantages: Well, it's permanent, nothing good can
ever happen to you again, the kid gets raised without a father, every-
one you know gets pissed off, you don't get to see how things turn out,
the world goes on without you. Advantages: None.
Staying alive. Disadvantages: Diapers, income tax. Advantages: walks on
the beach, the thought that raising a kid doesn't take forever, trips
to Disney World, computers, sunsets, driving fast to the middle of no-
where in the middle of the night, Mountain Dew, loud music, cool movies,
good friends, roller coasters, pizza, Christmas, full moons, Furry
Parties, hot horny foxes, good books, The Far Side, George Carlin,
voting against George Bush, and the disadvantages from #1 above
do not apply. Plus, you still have the option of doing something more
interesting than decomposing, ya know?

Not much, truth be told. I used to have a model 4P, but those machines
have some really bizzare problems and tend to eat power supplies. No,
I don't know of any anywhere.
 
You want to talk weird ancinet computers? Sitting next to my Model 4 is
an Apple Lisa that thinks it's a Macintosh. It'll kinda run Mac
software, sort of, as long as the program is reasonably well-behaved
and follows all of Apple's guidelines religiously. Games, of course,
generally don't do to well on the Lisa.

"Kheblan, huh? How did you get here? Who attacked you?" If anything,
the little morph is looking even more incoherent than before, and
thoughts of serious brain damage are running through my head.
In the rear of the bar, I notice the young human I vaguely noticed
before climbing all over Robert. "Oh, God," I think. Under my breath,
I mutter "I say, what subtlety!" in my best Cockney accent. In response
to the morph's questioning look, I shake my head and say "Never mind."
My tail is twitching again; with an effort, I stop it. "Do you

"I say, 'ow subtle!" Robert says when he gets the opportunity. "I may
assume you 'ave decided to resign the game, then?" He shifts to one side
and slides the young lady off his lap. "Seems like restraint is a con-
cept you should become acquainted with." He straightens his suit and
adjusts the lapels with exaggerated care. "By the terms of our agreement
I rather think I should be making the next move, don't you? An' I
think that I still 'aven't eaten my breakfast yet." He signals to the
barmaid, and orders two eggs, toast, and coffee. With another grin,
he waves his hand over the board and says "While we wait, 'ow about
another game?"

(On dogs vs cats)
 
Well - I like just about any critter (and I mean ANY) but my buddy
Captain has been with me for 9 years now and a more trustworthy
companion you couldn't find anywhere.  Cats are Ok, but I really
prefer the company of my dog because we can /do/ things together
and he /wants/ to.  Cats are pretty indifferent and absolutely
refuse to participate in outdoor events.  Besides - I have three 
neighbors that have been broken into but my neighbor that has a
dog and myself were not even considered (or they changed their
mind very rapidly!).  For sheer versatility and a buddy/buddy
relationship - dogs can't be beat.

Wonderful, I'd love to be there when he tells them about her being 
pregnant.  I love reminding "Christians" of their obligation to love
and forgive endlessly, and how they need to be support their children, 
no matter how bad to behave.  I swear that parents love to quote teh
(the) scripture that says, Children obey your parents.  But they seem 
to ignore the scripture that is right next to it.  Parents don't do 
anything to cause your child to be angry.  (Not these are not exact

  With a frustrated, sarcastic tone Kyara retorts, "I say, you are so 
stuffy.  I guess we can play another game though."  She reaches down and
starts picking up the pieces, and realizes that Robert hasn't move, she 
says, "What, are you dead?  You could help me here?" 
  Robert leans down and assists Kyara with gathering the pieces. With 
that done, they reset the game.  "Well, I believe that you have the 
first move this game."  She has a look of frustration and comtempt that 
is intentionally obvious.

You didn't /really/ use that shock collar did you?  I heard of a guy
in town that uses one. He guarantees that a dog will be trained after
you get him back.  Of course, the dog has NO personality other than
wimp and is afraid to do anything!  I also heard he feels as though
he needs to break a dogs spirit in the training process....denies them
food, keeps them in a cage in the sun..without water, etc.  I'd like him
to go to jail for cruelty to animals.  He IS legal though...has food and
water on property.  Also he has high friends too!

  Actually, I can show you at least one breeder that /yes/ does make a 
living out of show, raising, studding, dogs...but does NOT make a
BUSHEL of money.  It is my personal opinion that it all depends on the
popularity of the breed and geographical location.  Ex: a Husky or 
similar breed would be a poor investment in florida, but in Alaska,
that might be a diifferent story.  Also, the general popularity of the 
breed itself.  A chiuawa(sp) might not ba as financially rewarding
as lets say a german shephard or doby.

OOOOOhhh boy.  I really wish I could've got a doby.  But my wife and I
were going to look at a doby pup and she suggested tthat we go the the 
animal shelter to see if they have and /doby/ pups first.  After
arriving at the shelter, we saw a cage with no dog in it.  After my wife
inquired, the attendant let us in and out waddled this REALLY cute
Old English Bulldog pup...5 weeks old.  Needless to say, thats what 
we brought home that day.  She just fell in love with it.  After looking
at it, and after looking at me, I knew I was out voted.  Oh well!

I guess you could say I got hooked on it like some people get hooked on

   You obviously didn't have it in the right restaurant.  If squid is
overcooked, it's rubbery and tasteless.  If squid is undercooked, it's
slimy.  But if a real chef gets ahold of squid, and prepares it right,
it's one of life's greatest pleasures.

I've know trainers whose methods make my skin crawl. both dog and horse
trainers. The "no bark" collar was the last resort for a dog that simply
would not "shut up". The only step beyond that is surgery. 
It may sound inhuman....(both the surgery and the "no bark") but it's 
better than the only other alternative is putting the animal to sleep. 
A dog that will not stop barking is usually a very nervous and hyper 
animal anyway.

Dobies are peculiar (sp?) critters. They are very faithful and loyal but
they don't take disapline well..... they are very insecure. You can 
break their heart with one mean word or a dirty look...... that is, if 
you are their person. As far as strangers are concerned, most dobies 
are instantly suspicious and mistrusting unless "their person" is 
there and doesn't seem alarmed by the stranger. 
My dogs can instantly sense how I feel about a person who visits us.

You don't gotta excercise 'em, they don't come whining up to you with

Well, they're sturdier than silk scarves, but they're also too short.
Two of 'em knotted together work pretty well. Silk scarves are for
wimps...clothesline works best. (Actually, there is a really big

not random at all. Military? He mentioned reporting for duty somewhere,

might be in order. Robert might recognize the tattoo, if it is
military; he's a storehouse for that sort of information...hmm. I notice

that made me leave my house, like my step-father.  He used to beat me,-
and so I have been scared of what he may do, he is an asshole (pardon),
and I don't like him.  And if I told him without knowing for SURE, then
he would really kill me.  Anyways, this is not going the way that I had
expected it to.  Hmm.  Although I love her, and she loves me.

S> So? What's so special about 15036???? Just another number. Isn't it?
     
   Hah! Obviously you don't know the mystical experiences of 15036.
   First of all, if you remove the zero (which, metaphorically speaking,
is removing nothing) and you express the number in the Sacred 
Hexadecimal Code (God herself speaks in Hexadecimal.), you receive the
number 600, one-third of the Biblical Beast, representing the Antichrist
Himself.  If that doesn't shock fundamentalists, little will.
   Secondly, the number (again separated by that mystic zero) is 
composed of two composite numbers: the product of the first two odd
numbers, and the square of the first non-square composite number. This
represents the Armadillo's desire for Her followers to be extremely odd
and square.
   Thirdly, the fifteenth book of the Bible, third chapter, sixth verse
reads, "On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt
sacrifices to the Lord, though the foundation of the Lord's temple had
not yet been laid."  This gives us a new number of 17, which in base
14 arithmetic is a divisor of the mystic number 42, the answer to life,
the universe, and everything. (This verse also contains mysteries which
I can't reveal to the uninitiated.)

   Your stepfather sounds like a hideous person.  One idea: when you
confront him, could you bring along a friend? (Even your girlfriend
would be support.)

Well, there ain't no point in moving on, until you've got somewhere to 
go.  And the road that I have walked upon, well it filled my pockets
and emptied out my soul. 
And all those insecurities that have held me down for so long, 
I can't say I've found a cure for these, 
but at least I know them, 
So they're not so strong.
You look for your dreams in heaven But what the hell are you supposed 
to do when they come true? 
Well there's one year of my life in these songs
And some of them are about you 
Now I know there's no I can write those wrongs 
Believe me I would not lie you've hurt my pride 
And I guess there's a road without you. 
But you once said there's a way back for every man, 
So here I am, 
Don't people change?  Here I am. 
Is it too late to try again
Here I am.

Tell your parents when you are POSITIVE that she is indeed pregnant.  
If you tell them now, you'll worry to hell out of them for what might 
be mothing.  BTW, a girl being 16 days late on her period isn't that 
big of a deal.  It's not totally unusual for a woman to skip a period 
do to stress or a cold or just about anything.  Just relax until you
