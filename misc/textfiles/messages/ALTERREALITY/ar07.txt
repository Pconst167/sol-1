Am I the only one who seems to think they've weirded-out on us?  I've
always enjoyed it, if only for the fact that it is one of the few mass
publications that is written above an eighth grade level.
I forgave them when they added the UFO update section; at least they
prominently advertised the section as belonging to the bizarre, and
psuedo-scientific.  But their choice of interviews lately has seemed
less than inspired.  I suppose that in ten plus years of publication
you run out of great scientific minds to interview, but please...
an interview with an astronomer who now supports portions of astrology,
followed by an interview with Richard Dawkings re: his 'selfish gene'
theory of evolution.  Granted, it's a fascinating theory -- but he
came out with it 1974.  Hardly the cutting edge of scientific

And you must always be careful to keep your dog on a leash whenever you
walk him in a city. Interesting observation; also, TOTALLY IRRELEVANT!
When one talks about capital punishment, one is normally discussing an
individual who deliberately and maliciously murdered someone else, not
someone who served an unfortunate individual a meal which he
subsequently chokes on. Presumably, the trivial and insignificant fact
that murder is a deliberate act may put a small kink in your analogy.

In what sense?  The same way wildlife management is a branch of praying
to dryads?  Astronomy is based on observable facts--Astrology is a mix
of observable facts (taken from Astronomy) with a lot of mysticism
trying to connect astronomical observations with human behavior.  It's
a fascinating idea, but it's somewhat like predicting the movement of
subatomic particles with a wind sock.

Hey, Spellwind, propose to me a system by which the apparant position
(not the real position by a long shot...stars are, like, lots O' light
years away and like, they move around and stuff, and they, like, aren't
really where they seem to be) of a group of astral bodies--you know,
balls of fusing hydrogen and helium, the occasional mass of dirty ice--
can have any influence on my business contacts today. Lessee here. I
was born in a closed hospital room, so their light didn't reach me.
Their gravity did, but so faintly that the gravity field around the
doctor's body utterly overwhelmed it. No radiation from that star
reached me, none, zip. So how did it determine what sort of person I
would be? Last time I looked, it was genetics and familial environment
that made me what I am today, not the position of Jupiter in the
seventeenth house of the eleventh conjunction of Mars and some small,
insignificant solar body that would be utterly unregarded but for the
fact that it'd be a good place to build a hyperspace bypass...

 Their movement is controlled by the gods. Whatever faith you have,
(except cChristianity, which tosses out anything that is not the same as
their god.) There is always a god that controls the heavens, and
therefore controls men's lives from afar, the ancient egyptians had
astrology, first astrology, each sign represented by a lesser god, and
then astronomy, which in actuality was part of the use of a pyramid, 
though if an egyptian was buried in a chamber with that hole to the top,
it might have been for an easier trip to the heavens.

Buddha is not a god and has absolutely nothing to do with the stars.
This all still has very little to do with astrology.  Astrology was
around before astronomy?  Depends on the way you look at it.  There was
no separation at first.  However, the only provables in astrology are
the foundations of astronomy.  It could also be pointed out that
chronology is somewhat irrelevant; the geocentric view of the solar
system came long before the heliocentric view, but that doesn't make the
people who believe the other planets revolve around the earth rather
than all of them revolving around the sun correct.  You may personally
believe that the movement of the planets and stars is controlled by some
nebulous "gods", but there is no more (in fact, some would say there is
considerably less) evidence to support that than there is to support
Christianity's suppositions of the Holy Trinity and the Virgin Birth.

The movements of the stars are controlled by gods? Last time I looked,
they were controlled by certain observable--and provable--laws of
physics, and their motions were regular and predictable. They can
no more influence my destiny than the observed path of a baseball
that's just been knocked out of the park...both the baseball and the
stars move according to the same laws.
   You also still haven't addressed the point that apparant astrological
configurations are, for the most part, illusory. THE STARS ARE NOT WHERE
THEY APPEAR TO BE. To make an observation like "Saturn is within Orion"
is meaningless; the stars in that constellation haven't been in that
particular pattern for millions of years, and in the case of Orion it's
highly likely that at least one of those stars has been burned out for a
very long time. So by what mechanism can this particular configuration
possibly influence me?

       toast to your pirate-hacking adventures? What is the significance

       the ground. And, most importantly, what did you do to the
       French toast after it was dropped?
    6. What happened to the pirate after the escapade? Did he seek
       revenge? Or, had he allowed the hacking to take place? Did he
       seek a secret sexual thrill from the experience? Was he paying 
       you for this experience? Or, did you receive the sexual thrill
       from this? Is neither correct?
    7. Why, precisely, was the pirate also a phreak? Had he been a
       phreak before, after, or concurrent to his time of piracy?
       What prompted him to become a phreak or pirate in the first
       place? Had he seen the error of his ways? Has he converted to
       Christianity/ Buddhism/ Wicca/ The Great White Pumpkin?

Dear Angel,
   I, too, subscribed to Omni, but left them when they began to "weird

people more than the scientific community -- it's aiming for pseudo-
science, and trying to make it sound scientific. It's no longer a
magazine that tries to branch science fiction with science fact; it's
now more of a magazine for pseudo-science. (Though I do like their

> Astronomy is a branch of Astrology.
     
   Absolutely false. Astrology and astronomy have little, in reality,
to do with each other.
   Astrology was based on the ideas of the heavens before about 1600.
(Actually, well before that... Try the Babylonian times.) It is based
on a geocentric idea of the universe -- the Earth is the center of the 
universe, and everything goes around it. It's not terribly accurate
for predicting the positions of the real planets (especially Pluto,
but also Mercury.) Its predictions for human lives are necessarily
vague. (One of my friends as a birthday present gave me an astrological
chart of myself, and tried to explain how it fit my personality.
Unfortunately, he only knew one the facets of my personality, and his
explanation fit that facet perfectly. It did NOT fit my whole
personality terribly well.)
   Astrology cannot tolerate change; it has remained virtually the same
since the time of the Babylonians. Astronomy continues to change.
Astrology is terrible about predicting positions of planets; astronomy
predicts their positions with near perfection. (Notice I didn't say
total perfection.) Although astronomy pretends to be a science, it is
not. Astronomy is the only science of the two.

he thinks of astrology."

   Excellent rebuttal, Spellwind. (Pardon me if I'm dripping sarcasm
on your keyboard...) I agree that astrology is older than astronomy,
and I agree that astronomy stole at least one idea from astrology 
("wisdom can be gazed by studying the stars.") So what?
   I disagree with the idea "Older = better." (I also disagree with
the idea that "Progress = good." Some new ideas, shouldn't survive,
and some old ideas should be scrapped.) Do we farm by the same methods
our forefathers used? Do we still use whale-oil in lanterns to read
at night? Do we still write with quill and ink?

Rufus enters the small room, looking around for Turtle.  He spots him
in the corner screaming for some more Mountain Dew.  He walks over
to the reptile.  "Hiya Turtle, how's it going."  Turtle notices the
evil grin on Rufus' face and says "Don't tell me you let another non-

reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a tape with the word CALART

Basically, it not in the least bit IBMPC compatible, but rather a true

  It's tempting to give a 9-paragraph reply to that message, but would 
be far too tiresome.  What with Fem Lib, NOW, Alan Alda, TV in general,
Oprah, Sally Jesse, M.A.D.D, and a constant bombardment 24 hours a day
from all sides attempting to complete the emasculation of the American 
Male; I think maybe at least a small whisper ought to be heard in 
retaliation.
  If anyone wants to think of me as the ultimate Chauvinist pig - fine.
Actually I kind of relish the notoriety. ( I mean, who wants to be 
AVERAGE)  
  The fact is, I was happily married for 19 years, have enjoyed the 
company of quite a few ladies since divorcing, have a great relationship
with my ex-wife, have a daughter who is my chief pride and joy, have a
sister who I both love and respect, and am continually in a state of 
lust to meet more persons of the female persuasion. (not for conquest -
but because I LIKE WOMEN)
  Does that give you an idea where I'm coming from? I sure hope so.
  Having said all that, you can look for zero change in any outrageous
statements I might make on this subject. It's a terrible burden to have 
to be the advocate for vanishing male honor but hey - someone's got to 
do it.{

   Every 2.5 minutes a dolphin is killed!  For some unknown reason the
huge yellowfin tuna, also known as "chunk light tuna" in the little 
round cans at your local grocery store, swim beneath the schools of 
dolphins (dolphins stay together in "families").  The canneries pay a 
premium for yellowfin tuna, because they are cheaper to process.  So,
for the last three decades fishermen have used a method known as "set-
ting nets on dolphins" to catch them.  The fishermen spot the dolphins 
leaping above the waves, round them up, capture them in nets a mile
long and 100 feet deep, throw out the dolphins and keep the tuna.  Some
of the dolphins drown, some are killed by the boats, some fatally injure
themselves trying to escape, and most of the few who do escape die from
the shock of being separated from their school or from exhaustion.
   In 1972 the Marine Mammal Protection Act excepted the tuna industry,
in 1976, when a lawsuit forced the fishery service to determine the 
status of the dolphin population, the figures were falsified (proven
fact! not paranoid rhetoric), and in 1981 Congress set a "kill quota"
on dolphins at 20,5000 annually (the foreign fleet kills an estimated
100,000 plus).  A "body count" on marine mammals...another undeclared
war.
  Keep in mind that only 95% of the world's tuna is caught WITHOUT
"setting nets on dolphins!"  We are exterminating a species for 5%
of our total tuna consumption!
   PLEASE DO NOT BUY OR EAT CHUNK LIGHT TUNA!!! I know it is more 
expensive to buy albacore/fancy white tuna but isn't it worth it?

Cheer up, it could have been worse. You could have been learning RPGII
on a system/36 under SSP, the most evil, vile, festering, hideous
mound of dung masquerading as an operating system I've ever seen in my
life. SSP makes MS-DOS look downright useful. A typical SSP command
is an incipherable acronym followed by a dozen commas and non-sensical
parameters, but at least there are a whole bunch of commands that
don't do very much. Plus it comes on thirteen eight-inch disks, and
the last version I installed had five disks' worth of "Program Temporary
Fixes" (translation: bug patches) that didn't fix all the bugs. It's
pretty amazing; when the manual starts talking about using MSRJE
(Multi-Station Remote Job Entry--ie, the modem program) under DSPT
(Display Station Pass-Through), you want to throw the entire heap
of garbage out the window...which is probably why the machine is
about the size of a small refrigerator and weighs a thousand pounds.
Lord knows it's not even as powerful as a microVAX 3100 that sits
on a desk. Oh well, I'm rambling. I'll stop now, and let you count

Dear Spellwind,
   Okay! That's it! That quote did it! THIS MEANS WAR!
    
> What in the goddesses name is wrong with astrology!!!!
    
   Gee, I'm glad you asked. There are many things wrong with it.
   First of all, what does one's "sign" mean? If you are an educated
astrologer, you would say that due to the planet revolving around the
sun, the sun appears to travel through a portion of the constellations
called the zodiac. Whichever constellation of the zodiac the sun was
in when you were born, you'd say, is one's "sign."
   Okay, I'd reply, that was the original intention of astrology.
Unfortunately, the "days" which the signs correspond to were determined
more than two thousand years ago. Since then, the sun has seemed to
shift position, and where the sun is in relation to the constellations
has changed. In other words, one's sign really has less than nothing
to do with the original idea.
   Less than nothing? Yes. If one had nothing to do with the other, then
occasionally they'd be aligned: ones "sun sign" would occasionally 
match where the sun really was. This is now impossible.
   This is true for ALL of the other signs: if you claim that the 
moon was in Libra when you were born, it really would have been in
another sign (probably Virgo.) 
    
   Okay, what's my point? Simply this: astrology isn't even self-
consistant. It doesn't deal with real planets; it only deals with
imaginary ones. Even if a "mysterious force" eminated from the planets
which could determine our lives, astrology hasn't found it. It's too
busy dealing with imaginary planets.
   (This is entirely due to having formed astrology several thousand
years ago... and not having changed one iota of it, since.)

   I'm not so strongly opposed against either the Tarot or the I Ching
as I am against astrologt. The Tarot and I Ching are fabulous for
calming a person down, and forcing him to look at his problem in a 
different light. They're too general to try to specify exact routes
to try -- all they do is give a random message which one's intuition
can try to make into something coherent. Their real value is forcing
one to stop and think before acting.
   Notice I didn't say that there's any mystical power behind them.

Dear Rufus,
   Fortran isn';t that bad of a language. Basically, it's a precursor
to BASIC that was extremely useful for working with math formulae. If
you speak BASIC, you should be able to read Fortran with no problems.

.LBR is one of the very first archiving formats. It's dramatically
different from ARK, ZOO, PAK, ZIP, etc, etc, in that a library
file is structured kinda like a "virtual disk"--it has space reserved
in the file for a directory, and stores files in the library the same
way files are stored on a disk. ARChives et al store the files as a
linked list...each file's header is stored immediately after the file
before it.
   The .LBR format is less flexible han ARC, etc, because there's a
limit to the number of files you can put in a library. (I believe .LBR
directories only have room for 128 files...some limitation.) On the
other hand, you can get a directory of a library without scanning
the entire library; all you need to do is look at the directory. Also,
if a file in a library is damaged, only that file is lost; if a file
in an archive is damaged, frequently an unarchiving program will not
be able to locate the start of the file after the damaged one, so
all of the remaining files in the archive are also lost. Finally,
to clinch the argument in favor of .LBR, there are Z-system utilities
like VLU (Visual Library Utility)--a screen-oriented, powerful, point-
and-shoot library and file management utility that simply has no
equivalent in the ARC-ZIP-PAK-CHOKE-DIE world. (There are .LBR
programs available for VMS, MS-DOS, UNIX, etc, but for the most part
they're bad--about at the level the CP/M programs were when file
archiving was a brand-new idea.)

>Just how bad is FORTRAN compared to Pascal?
 
It isn't. No comparison at all. FORTRAN can actually be used for real-
world applications outside the sterile world of CompSci classes; Pascal
generally can't. FORTRAN is the first high-level language ever, and at
first glance doesn't seem that powerful (it reads like a brain-damaged
dialect of BASIC); however, it allows variable types like complex
numbers, recursion, subroutines with parameter passing, and other
generally neat-O things. It's also infinitely more flexible than Pascal,
doesn't require everything to be forward-declared, doesn't require you
to declare all your variables beforehand, and allows for some amazingly
efficient code. A skilled programmer can also use FORTRAN to modify the
operating system in a mainframe environment, do direct device I/O and
direct memory swapping, and other tricks that would make Niklaus Wirth
foam at the mouth and come chasing after you with a meat cleaver,
despite the fact that these are all things a computer program might want
to do. The Voyager and Viking spacecraft were both guided by very large
FORTRAN programs (in the case of the Voyagers, their guidance systems
alone were over two million lines of FORTRAN code).  If you're
really curious, download the file REAL.TXT from here (I think that's
what it's called; the file about "Real Programmers Don't Use PASCAL.")

Unfortunately, that is absolutely true, and not uncommon. I've talked

You have a TRS-80? My high school BASIC class used Model III's. Those
computers suck! Yuck! Get away!" It's the same sort of reaction you

ability to speak of, its language specs call for an inefficient one-

Although to be fair, FORTRAN sucks eggs compared to BASIC for doing
string-intensive work (yes, I know there are languages better than that
than BASIC is, but they're usually weaker than BASIC on math, harder to
use and at any rate, aren't from the same era--FORTRAN and BASIC both
are very close in age).
    That considered, you have to wonder if Patrick MacDonald--not to
mention Crowthers and Woods--are Real Masochist Programmers, or just
brain-damaged.  Hard to think of more string-intensive applications
than a BBS and Original Adventure....

Actually, VGA graphics /are/ pretty good, it's just that most of the
software out there doesn't take advantage of it.  In resolution and
color it's pretty close to the Amiga (around 640x400 resolution, often
up to 800x600, w/256 colors out of 4096 on-screen at once [I suspect
the hardware can do a hold-and-modify mode--almost every computer with
that type of graphics processor can--but knowing MS-DOS designers, they
probably didn't leave any way to get to it from software]).  It falls
flat on its face compared to the Amiga when it comes to update speed,
which is probably why nobody makes games for VGA.  (As to why nobody
makes games for EGA, which is somewhere inbetween a 128 and an Amiga and
is about as fast as a 128, well, because they're stupid?).
    Of course, a bozo thing about VGA is that most of them have all
sorts of neat extended modes, but every company's products use different
extended modes so almost nobody writes software to use them, except for
one or two paint programs.
    Another neat bozo IBM "upgrade": the Apple II has a sound board
called the Mockingboard that adds 16-voice stereo sounds, and about 95%
of the games for the Apple made since '81 will use it.  IBM PC's finally
followed suit, except there are no less than three incompatible sound
adapters out there being pushed by their respective companies: all of
Sierra's games use the Game Blaster and nothing else; Activision uses
some other one but not the Game Blaster; Epyx has their own which will
only work with their games; etc.  You can get sound better than the
Amiga's, but only on 10% of your games.

Not really. The newer enhanced VGA cards actually give you slightly
better resolution than standard Amiga graphics, and just as many colors.
Problem is, in addition to being a LOT more expensive, they simply don't
have the software support that the Amiga does. I see IBM zombies whining
all the time about this or that VGA card and how trhey can't understand
why anyone would get an Amiga for graphics work when their VGA is
better; they simply don't realize that programs like DigiPaint 4 and
Sculpt-Animate 4D just plain don't exist for the IBM, and you can't
get all the nifty graphics-intensive hardware and professional video
editing systems for the IBM that you can for the Amiga. There are
public domain graphics programs for the Amiga that are better than $200
IBM graphics packages I've seen. The IBMers who whine have never used an
Amiga graphics package and are totally ignorant of what the Amiga can
do.

turn them upside-down, you just don't get the same satisfaction.

Having the worst time trying to download TELEGEN.ARC.  Can't get my
system to even start accepting the file.  Ah, well.  Noticed Donthen's
got the text version available on the DEN.  I'll have to try there
when I've got a LOOOOOONG time to sit in a download loop.  Thanks for
putting the ARC version up there for me.  I appreciate the effort.

Dear $User,
   There is nothing wrong with pre-declaring all variable names before
using them, $User. All that Fortran can do, Pascal can do... albeit
more slowly, and possibly with a different method.
   REAL Pascal is able to use recursion, $User. Turbo Pascal is not
Pascal. 
                 Sincerely,

There is nothing wrong with either IBM's or Pascal; if you compare
them with Atari 800's with Atari Basic.

BASIC is extremely similar-looking to Fortran. In fact, BASIC is a
simplified and interpreted version of Fortran. If one can read one
language, one can read the other.

If anyone enters a movie theatre after seeing Lance Rund pictures,
outside, that person is a true furry. Especially if he enters a Disney
flick after seeing them.
   On the other hand, we'd better not cover the movie poster. Someone

The first objection is TERRIBLE! The world NEEDS more comic strips!
    
By the way, one conversation in that era:
   "Hi! I'm George. What's your sign?"
   "Liberty General Hospital."
   "No... no... I mean, under what sign were you born?"
   "Liberty General Hospital. I was a premature birth by twelve

LISP is even better with string (and list-) intensive work, AND was
the second programming language ever to exist. Scheme, a close
relative, is fairly good with math.

Dear Sauron,
   I believe the whole quote was something like astrology is no better
than a coin toss to decide a war. I assumed you meant that astrology
might have been used to try to decide a war beforehand. (Astrologers,
I assumed, promised their kings that if they entered war, they would
gain victory.)

That's because they weren't VGA graphics. There aren't too many games
out there that actually use a VGA card in VGA mode; most of them use
CGA (4 colors, 320 x 200) or EGA (16 colors, approximates C= 128
graphics) mode instead. And sound effects on an IBM are essentially
non-existant, unless you want to get one of those weird Incompatibility
Devices (tm) sound board that will only work with certain software
and WON'T work with anybody else's sound boards at all. *sigh* IBM
Zombies never could get /anything/ right.
