Patent Applied For - except we all know that the US patent office 
refuses to patent ANY perpetual motion machine - so I hereby donate my
Perpetual Maytag Motion Machine concept to the public domain.  You rig
it exactly the same as the communicators  with the added benefit that 
you can still use them for that purpose - and you start one up.  When 
the string gets wrapped so tight that it causes it to stop the unwinding
action will start the other one.  Since we know all about the superior
operating lifetime for these units we have in essence a perpetual motion
machine.

Righto!  You wouldn't bel;ieve how many married women that I'm supposed
to be having affairs with at work.  My buddy Kim happens to be a very
good-looking young blonde.  We happen to like each other a lot and go
out together for lunches, dinner, bowling, movies etc etc WITH the 
blessings of her husband Jeff.  We give each other hugs a lot because
we genuinely care a lot about each other.
As you can imagine tho... everyone else tries to drag a beautiful 
personal relationship into the mud.  Good thing we don't care.

I like it! I like it! You should add to every post..... that would drive

   Several questions for you:
   1. What does fighting for a monarchic government that has NO equiv-
      alent to our Bill of Rights (theirs was cancelled in 1985, I
      believe...) have to do with saving our rights? I've never seen a
      connection.
   2. When did I (as a person) agree to those rules? I never agreed to
      fight for the U.S, so far as I know.
   
   I've lived in another country, and I've spent time in many other
countries. Not one of them has the religion of "rallying around the 
flag" that the U.S. seems to. Several may rally around a charismatic 
leader. Many are drawn into patriotism through their religion. But
none have made the State into a religion.

   I'd say it's nearly IMPOSSIBLE to tell what a person's sexual pref-
erences are from how they act. Psyche has a rather high-pitched voice
for a male, yet he's completely hetero. There's a whole bunch of
Spaniards who lisp (speaking Castilian), but most are hetero.
   There's a California furry who has two (I believe) black belts, and
is bisexual.  Another of my friends was a power-lifter (used to work
moving whole kegs of beer) and was bi. You simply can't tell.

Me neither (either, ah, back to grammar school!!). I found something in
all of them that interested me. But there are some I can watch again and
again, and then there's some I've had enough of. I think it's kind of 
strange that they (meaning the syndication) seem to show the same ones
over and over. For instance, they might air one episode 3 times and 
never air another episode. Maybe that wasn't the way to put it (tongue
tied today). What I mean to say is that they don't just air the 3 season
consecutively. Know what I mean?

Yeah, I've noticed that too. Usually I can identify a show within about
five to ten seconds, but occasionally I'll be stumped. Simply because 
I've seen almost all of them five or six times, while others almost have
me convinced that I might have missed one.  They should give all the 
episodes equal air time.  You know what I'd like to see, a network air 
every Star Trek episode in sequential order.  Whether it was

I agree completely about airing the shows in sequence. Not just ST but

(sigh) well, heaven forbid they do anything that makes sense. I know 
what you mean about getting stumped occasionally on a St episode. 
Sometimes it takes me 10 minutes in to recognize the show, usually it's
something like a certain phrase that tips me off (I'm into diologue).

C'mon Dave - or I'll take back my nice guy award.  Maybe you take my
wording at some other value.  Maybe I should spell out my metaphors
so that you can grasp them more readily.  Icing is a superficially
sweet condiment that is very thin and insubstantial to the bulk of
the final product.  Got me so far? Or are you too busy trying to look
self-righteous.  The yummy cake part refers to the idea that this in
fact is the bulk of the product and is what is actually the most filling
ie the part that isn't readily visible and covered by a thin veneer of
what we arbitrarily call "beauty".  You are dead wrong about the
curiosity - I would like to meet many of the people on the board so I 
can attach a face to a string of ASCII text representing the "soul" of
that person as I have gotten to know them second hand.  "What" they
look like as far as a silly concept of beauty and other equally 
repugnant (to me) biases such as sexual persuasion - has absolutely
no place in MY life.  If someone is pleasing to the eye - then that
really is icing on the cake if they are pleasant, respectful of others,
and intelligent enough to carry on a coherent conversation.  
Now - hey! I can leer with the best of them under the proper circum-
stances - like when it is a very impersonal thing directed towards 
some gal that is dressed sharp, looks great and is out to show the
world.  I ain't saying I'm dead and my hormones don't work.  But I am
saying that "looks" are not what I look at or even consider when it
comes to building ANY kind of relationship.  I didn't give two hoots in
hades about anything when we had our dinner awhile back.  I didn't have
any conceptions about age, fanaticism (on several topics) or what have 
you.  I still happen to think that fundamentally you are a nice guy
but you just don't think, and you really need to open up the empathy
part of your psyche a bit - in short - grow up Dave.

be avoided.  If you do not build up the efficiency then weights can 
cause muscle deterioation from lactic acid concentrations - the cells
simply can't flush themselves fast enough.  Also keep in mind that as
far as metabolizing fat cells - the body breaks down the tissue 50-50.
You also lose muscle mass at the same time as fat so you have to make
sure that you are eating properly to avoid stuff like ketosis.  
As far as aerobic exercise - I like raquetball - I HATE running but
swimming and fast walking are excellent.

Phonies - hmmm yup there's a bunch of them out there but since they are
so easy to spot - not much of a bother.  I really hate the sorriest
of the lot - the "sophisticate".  The ones that right off the bat ask
what you drive and look at your clothes to see if they're "label".  Bah!
The second worst are the ones that come on as really decent humans and
then after you start getting into the swing - they decide that there
are things that need to be changed.  I just got over one of those -
she decided that I really should start liking Chinese food best and stop
drinking sodas because they'll rot my guts.  Sheesh!  Maybe she should
call up the source and custom order one next time.  There are many other
variations to toads and toadettes - I guess ya just have to weed them 
out. So far my resolve to remain a bachelor (after 2 disasters) has
remained firm.

Twinkies are bad for you? Twinkies are bad for you? Hmph. Somewhere
near an ant pile, put a bit of the cafeteria's mystery meat, and a
bit of the Twinkie filling, and see which one the ants run towards.
See? Even they know how good it is for you!
    
   Twinkies have lots of preservatives. Just think: you can stay your
current age as long as you want!  Also, Twinkies make a wonderful
metaphor for life: you have to dive in, and get to the heart of things
before you can really enjoy it. Also like life, it's meant for big 
bites.
   Twinkies make the almost perfect post-nuclear holocaust (sp?) food:
they will last for hundreds of years. (At least the fillings...)
  What more could you ask for? Besides, they contain one of the Four 
Basic College Food Groups: Sugar. (The other three are, of course,
caffeine, pizza, and alcohol.)

Any of those groups use thier riffs just to show off how fast the lead 
guitarist can hammer on and pull off on his guitar...not to add to the
song.  They may be fast and good...just not with the pariticular son
that everone else is playing at the time.  By the way, WINGER is an 
excellent example of the lead guitar playing along with the song instead
of just showing off.  "Headed for a Heartache" has a lead in it which is
not always "ripping up the frets" but still comes off as a fantastic
riff, *with* the added bonus of going with the song that's being played.

Weed them out, I like that. But you know, almost everyone has something 
good about them...... Even the plastics and the phonies, it just takes
a little longer to get past the bullshit and down to the real person. 
Persistence and patience sometimes do pay off, but it's a gamble. 
Plastics usually have false expectations from life and relationships and
they don't have the patience or fortitude to "get to know" anyone past 
"like you said" what year Beamer they drive or what boutique they shop 
in. This goes for relationships in general, not just man-woman. I'd
rather have 1 good friend than 20 plastic friends. But I must admit, 
I considered some of my friends plastic when I first met them (but

Well, like I wrote earlier, I've been engaged twice and screwed over 
hard.  Do you want to hear this?  It is a long story. I've just found it
virtually impossible to get to really know most women.  Not that I have 
a hard time communicating with women, but they just won't open up. They 
play their games and dance around questions.  Arrrrghh, honesty do you 
really want to hear this?

That sounded pretty concieted but I knew what you meant. True friends

Of course you doubt it; otherwise you wouldn't have called him a coward
in the first place. I'm not debating with you, since once you have your
mind set on something it doesn't change and I suspect you'd still call
Max a coward even if you saw him in the front seat of a tank. My point
was not to argue about it, I simply state that you are wrong.
 
As to who I'd rather have in Kuwait, certainly not Hussein. It still
doesn't take 200,000 troops to kill one man. This is simple stuff,
fingers-and-toes arithmetic, you know? "But that would leave his
army intact." So? It's not like squashing it is going to keep Hussein's
successor from building military power, and it's not like Hussein's
successor is gonna use it like Hussein did to begin with. Squashing
Hussein would have caused his occupation of Kuwait to fall apart over-

Only 80%? There are good Motley Crue songs, but I'd say they comprise
far less than 20% of that group's works to date...and most of the Crue
stuff I like isn't terribly popular. My opinion: 80% of their stuff is

Yes and no. Yes, that is true; no, it's nothing new. Human beings,
the rational beings they are, will make rational decisions about almost
every aspect of their lives EXCEPT THE MOST IMPORTANT, which has
always been something that utterly baffles me. When it comes to
dealings and interactions with other people, especially the intimate
kind, people in general switch off the ol' forebrain and run on
instinct...let knee-jerk reactions like jealousy or posession or
security or territory or simple fear make their decisions for them.

ANSI is a cursor-positioning standard (baserd on the DEC VT-102
terminal standard) that has nothing to do with graphics. A lot of
people confuse ANSI cursor positioning with IBM graphics characters
and if you want one you get both. A terminal which emulates ANSI
(like mine) still will not be able to produce IBM graphics characters
unless your computer has an IBM character generator or a software driver
of some sort. Your best bet is just to leave it turned off, since
ANSI is as slow as frozen molasses in zero gee anyway. There are BBS
packages (Telegard comes to mind) that let you switch ANSI and
IBM Graphics on and off independantly, but most BBSes don't (I suspect
because most IBM programmers don't know that ANSI and IBM graphics are
not the same thing).

Much as I loathe to say it, once again I find myself in The
Specialist's camp on this one. If there were no reasonably consistent
behavioral traits, there would be no stereotype associated with "gay
behavior;" after all, stereotypes are based, however loosely, on fact.
There ARE traits that some gays exhibit which identify their sexual
preference; if you deny this I invite you to look around campus some-
time. I don't believe these traits are as common among gays as The
Specialist seems to believe; they certainly aren't universal, nor are
they always accurate. They do undeniably exist, though.

Not this person. Lyrics are the most important part of a song, although
by themselves they can't make up for truly atrocious music. I don't like
the sledgehammer approach to lyrical writing that most people seem to
employ, though; you know, the "If ya got something to say it say it
directly" philosophy. Subtlety is a good thing; for example, I wonder
how many people know the Don Henley song "All She Wants To Do Is

it is possible to meet "real people" /anywhere/. You just have to know

know what to do when you recognize it...and in this sort of situation,
"he who hesitates is lost" holds true more often than "look before you

begin a real intimate (as opposed to physically intimate, which is easy)
relationship is concerned. Nothing to it.

I'd put them at number 3. Number two are the people who come on like
decent human beings until the magical instant you start having a
Relationship, at which time you become part and parcel of their
property...they suddenly feel they have the right to control
who you see, where you go, what you do and when, etc. I've known a
couple of people like that, although never had to deal with any on
any sort of a "going-out" relationship. Speaking of which: I never 
could grok the distinction a lot of people see between relationships
(ie, close friendships) and Relationships; to me they seem to be on
a contimuum, but a lot of people I've talked to seem to see them as
qualitatively different. Ditto for attitudes like "I love you; I'm just
not 'in love' with you," as though emotional intimacy comes in different
flavors. Manifest Bullshit if ever I saw it.

An observation I made a long time ago. It's a male-dominated society,
still, and if you're male the thought of two women sleeping together
is not likely to have the same gut-churning impact as the thought of
two men sleeping together. Pick up any 'Penthouse Forum' type magazine
and you'll see all sorts of two-girls-making-it stories, but never, ever
a two-guys-making-it incident. I even know some rather...opinionated
anti-gay bigots who are actively turned on by the prospect of two
women sleeping together. Go figure.

No, there is a difference. I love you means (or should mean) I accept 
you and I want to be with you and only you. I love you; I'm just not
in love with you means I care for you, I don't want to lose you're 
friendship but you just ain't doing it for me. It's the last thing a guy
says before he never calls you again (unless it's to get your sisters 
phone number). Not actually true. Haven't you ever had a intimate 
relationship with someone that wasn't going well for one reason or the 
other but you didn't want to lose them???? You loved them, but you 
knew that this wasn't "it".

Yes, that's true. I've met people who were very cold at first impression
but they usually turn out to be very nice people once you get past the
defence shields. Most people won't make the effort to melt the ice, 
however. It's the same with shy people, they're branded as snobs because
they don't leap into conversations or look people in the eye.

I haven't come across it yet. I haven't been posting all that long,

calling people (both male and female) Darlin' and Babe. I suppose I

S>[remarks on men don't think "lesbian" about two women...but two men
S>turn women off...]
 
Actually, I do think "lesbian"; actualy, the word that comes to mind
is "dyke".  
  I think that the reason men don't feel so bad towards woman-woman
is that they don't think that both women can be as homely as mud
covered fences.  Most men think beautiful woman with a beautiful
woman, and this appeals to them--because if one beautiful woman is 
a pleasure to watch, then two is twice the pleasure!  
  Now with this in mind, take a look at the stereotype there--a 
beautiful woman is a pleasure to behold.
 
  On the flip side of the coin, a woman (or most women, excuse me if
I am dead wrong but figger the odds) looks for masculinity in a man.
So one man who is masculine is a pleasure to behold (to a woman).  Two
men together...well, it kinda blows that masculinity away.  (Excuse the
pun.)  So, naturally a woman wouldn't be interested in non-masculine 
men.  (And you CAN'T tell ME that a man who does sexual acts with 
another man is in ANY way shape or form masculine.  He may have the 
physique of Adonis but if he sucks dick (pardon) he is NOT masculine.) 
 
  As for myself...I am against homosexuality anyway....

being gay.  Me, I don't care if someone thinks that of me. Like I said
I'm not a bigot.  I believe that homosexuality is wrong I'm not going to
try to tell someone how to live, and kill them if they won't go straight
And yes, the Specialist and I have had several talks about homosexuality
and we simply have agreed to disagree.  Because he knows he won't chang

True.
 
>Instinct is all ya' got.
 
Not true. The fact that you can't predict the other person's thoughts
or actions is no excuse for allowing instinctive and irrational
reactions like jealousy or posessiveness to interfere with good old 
fashioned understanding and communication, ya know? jealousy is
an evil, destructive force that has no place in any relationship
between any reasonable people and has no more redeeming merits than
bigotry, selfishness, or any of the other petty little concerns that
more appropriatley belong with lizards than with any being posessing a
central nervous system more sophisticated than a brainstem. Leave the
instinct to snakes and skinks; they get along just fine with nothing
else. I won't model my relationships on their example, though.

Yes. I also think that people with a traumatic childhood who learned
no social skills whatsoever during adolescence can become secure,
well-adjusted adults. insecurity has more than one sorce, and a bad
childhood is not necessarily an irreversible condemnation.

I thought we were talking about "real" intimacy here. Physical intimacy 
is easy, but that's not what /I/ was discussing. In any event, AIDS is
a controllable threat, and throughout all of human history there has
only been a span of about twenty years (between the discovery of
antibiotics and the appearance of antibiotic-resistent strains of
social diseases) where you did NOT have to worry about a sexual
liason killing you. That's something I think a lot of people have
forgotten; everyone is almost outraged that the race is faced with a
fatal, incurable social disease, totally forgetting that that is
simply business as normal. In, say, 1852, syphillis was almost 
invariably fatal, and it takes years and years to kill ITS victims,
too.

You seem to be basing that assumption on the idea that you can only
be "in love" with one person at a time. I catagorically deny that
assumption.
 
>Didn't you ever have a relationship with someone that wasn't going
>well...but you didn't want to lose them?
 
Yes, but I don't see your point. I still love those people. I do not
"leave" a relationship. The nature of the relationship may change, but
that does not mean I no longer love that person or am no longer "in love
with" that person or whatever catch phrase you want to use. It sounds to
me a whole lot like you are using the word "love" to mean "affection"
and the phrase "in love with" to be "involved with a monogamous
sexual relationship with," and if that is the case I still say the
distinction between the two is Manifest Bullshit. You can still be "in
love with" someone you're not sleeping with, you can be "in love with"
more than one person at a time, and you can be "in love with" someone
you aren't even living with. I can make these statements with absolute
certainty; I know them for a /fact./

The hippie episode is called "The Way to Eden." The Enterprise picks up
a band of hippies who are searching for Eden; these hippies play an
impromptu concert in the ship (with Spock on some weird triangular
stringed instrument) and then suddenly decide that Eden is located in
the Romulan Neutral Zone, hijack the ship by means of a device which
produces a nasty, obnoxious sound that renders the crew inert, and
head off for parts unknown. They steal a shuttlecraft, land on a planet,
discover that all the vegetation in the lush garden they have discovered
is toxic, and are majorly bummed out, dude.

Your are against homosexuality as a life  style for yourself, that's 
fine. But you can't stop nor should you want to interfere with what

women. They are, with one execption, bitter towards men but in their
very behavior, they are men. The one exception is a very sexy, attractiv
woman......, I believe she is bi-sexual but I am not sure. She dates 
men occasionally but she prefers women as lovers. She is very out-
spoken about it.

   the only distinctions ('flavors') I've ever made in my relationships

I've known many women who I've been very close to, mentally and emot-

of love, will be an adult who doesn't know how to love. Just because 
parents don't get along with each other, doesn't mean they don't get

My son is doing fine now. It was rough going for a while. After the 
incident (for lack of a better word), he had counceling from Matt 
Donavon's family unit (I can't remember the name, but it's connected to 
HRS). They made video tapes of his sessions for the trial but the 
defence attorney tried to get the tapes ruled inadmissable. Months 
passed, and then my Son was subuenaed (sp? you know what I mean) for 
deposition. So that dragged the whole thing up in his mind again. Then 
months later as the trial drew close, the defence tried the trick with
the video tape and wanted to call my son to the stand. I said "NO WAY". 
The asst. state's atty. Bob Lee (at the time) fought them tooth and 
nail. Luckily, we won that battle and the tape was ruled admissable 
evidence. The day of the trial (in fact it was during jury selection), 
the defence realized (by the responces of the prospective jurors) that
they didn't have a snowballs chance in hell. He plea bargained and 
accepted 30 years on a lesser charge. If he had been convicted of 
Sexual Battery, the mandantory sentence is LIFE. Well, at least he's

It's a cop out. It means that you want out of the sexual, monogomous

TS> squashing Hussien would be that easy.
 
Actually - it's my thought that killing Hussein was never a goal of our
military planning. 1) it would make the jerk a martyr 2) They want to
humble the man publicly so that it will discourage similar actions in
the future.  Also it would discredit his remarks and support of 
a free Palestein and defuse any aid from that quarter ever again.

SS> But I survived, and didn't resort to becoming plastic.
 
Well, against my better judgement (yes a real oxymoron!) here's a little
blurb that is paraphrased from a workshop that one of profs organized
in years gone by in dealing with dysfunctional families.
Typical of children raised in a hostile environment is the feeling that 
they are merely a pawn in a game of who's right with each parent trying
to get points by having more players on their side.  The struggle for
dominance is so intense that the children suffer in their sense of
self-worth because they percieve that they have no worth outside of
the power struggle framework.  These people in turn become dysfunctional
as they attempt to gain a feeling of worth by attaching themselves
to someone that will dominate them as this is what they have been 
conditioned to associate as "love".
Now I'm not trying to say anything about you personally because I don't
know you.  I do know that you have remarked on several failed relation-
ships and this may or may not relate to those.  A typical remark from
a girl that backed out of a realtionship may be that you were "hanging"
on her all the time.  Enough of the Pop-Psychobabble - What I guess I 
would really like to say is that there are many workshops that are
organized to help people that come from dysfunctional families and they
can help you understand how to cope with your feelings about it and
yourself.  I would recommend that you investigate and it may turn out 
that you will benefit in ways you never imagined.  Good luck bud.

Well, I admire what you are trying to say if you acknowledge that gay
people are in fact PEOPLE and deserve to be treated as such.  I don't
really know what to make of the staement that you beleive it is "wrong"
as that is usually associated with a moral judgement of sorts.
The message that I replied to came across as strong as most I have

Not a valid sylogism and you know it.  I agree with what you say tho..
you did leave out a very important one that is responsible for an
awful lot
of hangups.  It is possible to go to bed with someone without being in
love with them.  Recreational sex if you will.  You realize of course
that you are walking on really shaky ground in American culture.  I
don't know why, but so many people confuse the word "love" with anything
but.  My best friend gets so uncomfortable when I tell him that I love 
him and his wife and kids.  He can accept the kids and his wife, but he
has a real problem with himself.  I can see it on his face.  Lest this 
statement cause any misunderstandings (not that it /should/ matter), I
am not either gay or bi - I'm as hetero as they come (or a die-hard
breeder as my gay friend puts it).  The word "love" has unfortunately
become tangled with the concept of sexual relationships and most
people don't know how to handle that on a social basis very well.
The greeks had three different words to describe the varying degrees
of the concept.  I wish we had delineations along those lines.

That's see if I can proper ly clairfy my stance on homosexuality. 
I think homosexuality is wrong morally.  But I believe homosexuals are 
also human none the less. Human's are prone to mistakes. The err is 
human....  I don't approve of discrimination as far as jobs and rights 
are concerned.  At the same time, I don't approve of homos adopting, 
being able to marry. Again, because of my moral standards.  But, agai, 
just as much human. I don't discriminate against them.  Like I said, 
I have had gay friends and gay co-workers.  As long as they respect me
and my sexual preference I have not problem with them.  One guy I 
worked with really pissed me off, he was always hitting on me.  He was 
a fairly new employee and needed direction.  I told him to go help 
some other employee because I would be done before him.  So he needed
to assist him so that the work would get done approximately at the same
time.  His response was' "yeah, and the next thing you're going to 
want me to do is, bend over and grab my ankles." Sick. sick. Sick.

You must have seen it......, remember, one of the women in the "hippie" 
group was an old flame of Chekov's? The "hippie" group was running 
around the Enterprise trying to "corrupt" the crew into following them. 
It was one of the earlier T.V. shows that addressed "Cults"..... There
have been many since but not ST. Dr. Sevrin was the "hippie" leader. 
A brilliant but insane man. (evil genius). Sevrin had a deadly 
diseise that threatened anyone who wasn't immune to it. Spock took 
over the search for Eden. The last scene of the episode showed Dr. 
Sevrin hanging dead in a tree after taking a bite of a toxic fruit.

No, the Wiccan idea is much more sophisticated than the Golden Rule.
The Golden Rule applies ONLY to the way you interact with other people;
for example, if you are burying toxic waste outside some town somewhere,
it can be argued that you aren't doing anything to anyone else (at least
not directly), where the Wiccan idea would very clearly consider this
behavior immoral. Ditto for cutting down rainforests. The Wiccan ideal
is both broader and better able to guide interpersonal interactions.

Ding...back at ya. 
I hate using this term again and again, but "plastic people" are usually
self centered. Love is great, but it can get pretty boring compared to 
the "newness" of infactuation. I think thats why certain individuals 
might coin that phrase "I love you but....". Love is a bond that grows 
with time and doesn't fade because somebody "better" comes along. Lust 
is a flash in the pan, once it's satisfied and everyday reality seeps 
in, it's too cold to hang around.

Is that strength merely a hard shell to keep the world out?  The word
strength carries a lot of connotations and unfortunately in our
society the male is expected to be the "strong silent type".  I would
that men in this country could learn to hug as a good start.  Americans
are considered to be a very cold impersonal people by the erst of the
world.  American men have a personal space of about 18" for friends
and about 25" to 36" for strangers.  Europeans reduce that amount by
half for interpersonal communication and Arabs get right in each others
face.  They say that they need to "share breath" as a sign of friend-
liness.  Arab men also hold hands with their friends which has caused 
more than one misunderstanding with Americans.  Heck with it.  My 
personal campaign is to hug anyone that is dear to me and f*ck anyone
that feels it isn't manly.

AGAPE' - transcendent love used to describe the type of love that God
         has for man or man for his fellow man.
THELO' - love ascribed to things - like women love shoes, the fella 
         that is in love with his new corvette etc.
Phileo - Love between friends, family, acquaintences.
 
It is helpful anytime (if you read the Bible) you see the word "love"
to look up in a good concordance exactly what type of love is being
referred to.
