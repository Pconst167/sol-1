   From what I've heard, the grammatical theory behind Japanese isn't
that bad. BUT, not only are there huge problems learning the different
pictographs (I know about fifty -- and that's tough), but also
the spoken Japanese is extremely colloquial. In other words, they have
and use a lot of expressions. (They've had some three thousand years
to do it in... unlike English.) 
   I'm sticking with Spanish, German, and maybe (in the future) Arabic.

I don't think we would end up with something with significantly
better sound reproduction and higher resolution, actually.  By today's
standards of digital recording they /aren't/ that bad, and the
difference between, say, the sampling rate of CDs, DAT and a NeXT
computer looks much better on paper than it does in practice, which was
my original quibble.  I don't think CDs are the be-all and end-all of
sound reproduction, but I expect them to be around, in basically the
same form, for the same length of time that LPs were.  The difference
between the sound recording on a 1989 LP and a 1959 one was significant,
but they were essentially the same format, and you could take a '59
LP and play it on an '89 turntable without a problem (or, in fact, a
'39 LP), and for the most part, you could take a '89 LP and play it on
a '59 turntable without many ill effects (you'd lose some of the
fidelity and the record would wear out faster due to a larger stylus);
the same will probably happen for CDs.  In fact, it already has; there
are audiophile CDs, like Mobile Fidelity's, with higher repro quality
than the original specs for CDs maintained was possible, and there are
CDs out there running around with 80 minutes of music on a medium whose
original specs said 74 was the maximum.  CDs have the advantages of
being flexible, "upgradeable" in the way LPs are, and, unlike their
nearest competitors, already in wide use.  If you wanted better repro,
you could be using a reel-to-reel with metal tape, but don't look for
the new Billy Idol album on a 2400-ft reel at Camelot.  (Not that I
have anything against reel-to-reels; if I had the money, I'd probably
get one to make the masters for silly mixed tapes I like doing.)

Not really. You cannot, say, offer greater frequency response from a
standard-format CD, because the bits just aren't there. Conceivably
you could develop a new format for storing data on a CD and then create
a player that could distinguish between it and the older format, but
such a disc would be unplayable on a conventional CD player.

    First and foremost, in this "democracy," less than half of all
registered voters choose to use that right. Less than half of us are
making decisions about our "various governing bodies," and apathy rode
high in the last Presidential elections. (BTW, how many of y'all
voted in the primaries?) Unfortunately, the youngest and the oldest
voters tend to be the ones who vote the least. 
    
    Secondly, let's face it: the bus system in Sarasota is terrible.
In some communities (like Washington D.C.), people are lucky enough
to have subways and busses that go for forty miles outside of the
city. We don't. With the extremely rich elderly used to being very
independent, what do you suggest they/we do? (And how about the poorer
elderly?)

   Actually, heavy metal really started in the late '60s. There's
always several kinds of rock on the scene. And you'd better believe
they're going to get stranger and stranger. 
   My crystal ball is broken, though. My best guesses for the music of
2030:
   By 2030, the basic structure of pop music will have moved on, 
finally. (Basically, believe it or not, all rock music is based on
18th-century composers -- changing the instruments, of course.) It'll
have finally caught on to the ideas of Debussy and Ravels, and there
will be at least one group aflame with ideas from them. 
   Instruments: I'd say the electric guitar is here to stay. (Though
it will be even more warped -- and finally a decent electronic one
will be around and used.) Keyboards will become even more warped.
Perhaps they'll be adding quarter-tones -- or just intonation -- for
more neat dischords. I'll say this: ere will be at least one completely
new instrument by then that doesn't exist now -- and it'll be
popular.

Had to change the Subj:, "Animalism!" just didn't seem to fit this topic
any more. I think I realized there was more to school then just 
socializing when my daughter started. The thing I have a hard time with
is when she does something at home (ie- makes "those" faces and sounds
when you ask her to do something she doesn't want to do..) and you 
reply "Is this the way you act at school?", to which she replies "No!".
To which you reply "Why do you act like that here?", to which she 
replies "If I acted like that at school I'd have to go to the principle
to get a paddling", to which you stare at her going "Huh?!?!?!?" because
you know damn well she KNOWS that you're getting ready to "paddle" her
for it at home.....social pressures!!!! I think I'll invite a few of
her best friends over for her next spanking <grin>

Great play....let's produce it!!! Put the kid in a business suit and

Reminds me of the ol' National Lampoon joke with the same players but
with the parents raising hell with their son because they found him
"sneaking" up to his room to do his homework. How hard is it for kids 
to raise up above the level of their parents? Appears that in most cases
the kids are either less then or equal to what their parents are....

I've heard this argument before as it relates to the elderly driving.
It's Manifest Bullshit (tm). You wouldn't give a license to a 14-year-
old, or a blind man, or anyone else, because that person is "used to
being independant." Allowing an elderly individual who is obviously
incapable of driving to drive on the grounds that he/she "needs his
independance" is a crock--and a dangerous one. In Cape Coral about
three years ago, a nice elderly gentleman ran over and killed three
small children and kept going--he believed he'd hit some trash cans.
He was blind. He had a license. He "needed to get around." What utter,
complete, unmitigated, ghastly bullshit. If you are capable of driving,
you should be allowed to drive. If you are not, you should not. No
mitigating circumstances. No exceptions.

Kinda interesting thing happened to me the other night: I was talking
to a friend of mine, and she said something along the lines of "God only
knows." I said "I don't believe in God," and she replied "Neither do I,
but I know there's a Goddess" with the sort of absolute conviction you
normally see reserved for statements like "I know you hate this cough
syrup, but..." As much as it's refreshing to see someone who knows,
absolutely and surely, that there's a diety that's non-Christian as
someone who's a Xhristian claims to "know" that /his/ god is real, it's
still kind of disturbing. The nature of religion is such that ain't
nobody can /know/ diddly-shit. Otherwise, there wouldn't be more
religions than Oral Roberts has ill-gotten goods.
 
Her arguments were more convincing than anyone else's I've heard so far,

   Of course! I've forgotten about our resident playwright! I'm
not really sure what kind of music the band "JonBoy and the Biohazards"
might wind up doing (though the name has a vaguely heavy-metalish
sound, I've only been involved in jazz and medieval bands before.) 
   As it stands, all we have is a name -- and which instruments people
play. As far as I know, no one showed up for the first meeting (due to
the animation festival in Tampa...) We'll have a second meeting
sometime. If we play well enough from written music (and we decide on
a style -- like jazz, maybe? -- that requires it), I'd be more than
glad to ask your advice on songs.

   I'd love to have heard them.
    
   Ya know, the problem with proofs about God's existence is that 
most of them can be twisted into the proof of gryphons' existence...
or into a proof of the supremacy of Bob. <Aack! Pphthp! Bob-ism: JUST
SAY NO!> I've been convinced -- even when I went to a Christian high
school and they were spewing these proofs left and right -- that the
existence of God could never be proven; otherwise She would not be
separate from the world; She would be a part of the creation.
   (For those wondering why I sound like a feminist with referring to
God as a She: two reasons. Neither gender really applies to God. God
neither has a penis nor breasts. The Bible even mentions: "God made
them in His own image: male and female He created them." Because
God has neither gender -- and it seems horrible to me to call God an
"it" -- in this message, I refer to God as "She." Secondly, women
(especially mothers) are traditionally associated with love, while
males (especially fathers) are traditionally associated with justice.
I'm trying to use that assumption. Now, back to the religious debate.)
   
    Anyway, you've never met a person who is as convinced of their
beliefs as most "born-again Christians" are? Tell me: have you ever
met a Muslim? Many of them are willing to die for their beliefs; and
it looks like many of them will get their chance. I would say that in
every religion, there exist fanatics who are convinced it is the "only
way." Then again, in every religion, there are reasonable people as
well who are fascinating to talk with. (I once had a fascinating
conversation with a Hare Krshna. She had a doctorate in Indian cultures,
had become fascinated by the worship of Krshna, and eventually joined
the movement here. She got ten dollars -- and I never give to cults.)

   Going back to the knowledge of God, even though I firmly believe
Her existence can't be proven, I don't believe this means we shouldn't
believe in Her. I can neither prove nor disprove intelligent life
exists, but I can believe it does. 
    
   Anyway, why am I a Christian (though I do make fun of preachers)?
Mostly due to love of the Bible -- though I get sick when I see people
misusing it. Partly due to my upbringing.

Well, there's always the SCAT, the Senior Friendship bus (yes, I know 
it's had problems), other friends who can still drive, and family.  Most
retirement homes have bus trips almost every day.  I'm sure some sort of
volunteer service could be set-up, where people drive old folks to where

   My personal favorite are the fries at the county fair sprinkled with
vinegar.  I always look forward to those great fries cooked in the open
sandy air filled with dust deep-fried by a person with a huge goiter
on the neck.  Nothing like it.

Public transportation.  Yes, it's not as convenient as being able to
drive anywhere you want, but people who honestly are unable to drive --
regardless of age -- shouldn't be allowed to "inconvenience" others by
behaving in a hazardous (and sometimes fatal) fashion	 in the name of
personal freedom.  Somebody's going to get the short end of the stick
no matter which way you choose (their independence versus protecting
other drivers from the danger their independence may cause), but there
is at least a potential for them to find other ways around.  There is
no potential left for someone killed in a traffic accident caused by
someone who has forgotten the rules of the road, has no defensive
driving skills and who expects everyone to bend over backwards to let
them continue being behind the wheel without so much as a refresher
course on	 the grounds that it's "age discrimination."

On the big french fry box, the contents are listed as Idaho russet

using inferior supplies, but from what I've actually seen, they use the
best stuff they can get in the restaurant business -- usually a grade or
two higher than most fast food places do.  It's a mystery as to how they
make most of their food taste so bland, given what goes into it.

Eh eh eh.  We are not talking about a feminized Christianity, we are
talking about a different RELIGION.  You can't prove what sex the
Christian god is -- in fact, you can't prove he exists at all.  The same
argument can be made for the Wiccan Goddess, or, for that matter, for
any other religion.  There's nothing to say that the ancient Greeks
didn't have it right and the only reason we don't all worship a pantheon
led by Zeus is because Christ had better public relations people.

For the most part, McDonald's fries are very good. Occasionally, some
bonehead screws 'em up by sticking them in a fryer that isn't turned
on or some other such mind-bogglingly stupid thing, but that isn't the
fries' fault. When cooked /correctly/ they're about the best fast-food
non-curly fries in existance.

I don't see any need to do anything of the sort. I simply stated that
people who can't drive shouldn't be allowed to. It's that simple. You
can't drive safely, don't. No ifs, ands, or buts. Your "need for in-
dependence" has no bearing whatsoever on your ability as a driver; if
the ability isn't there, you don't drive. Hey, it isn't like everyone
who can't drive a car withers and dies because of it. On the other hand,
people /do/ die when incompetent assholes take to the road.

TS> God is male. Goddess... what bullshit!
     
   First and foremost, define "male." To me, male means the presence
of penis and scrotum. Though Jesus was undeniably male, it remains to
be seen whether God, as a whole, is male. (Because God has no physical
body, I doubt he has either physical attribute.)
     
   I see no fault -- nor anything in the Bible -- that contradicts the
statement "God is sexless." Because of this, it is equally inaccurate
in our language to refer to God as He than to refer to God as She. I
will switch between the two whether I wish to refer to God, the father-
like Divine source of justice; or God, the mother-like Divine source
of love.
