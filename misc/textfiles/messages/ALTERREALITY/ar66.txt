Perhaps what Turtle is trying to say is that a relationship does NOT 
have to be a monagomous one to be sucessful.... that may well work for 
some people but I believe that most people desire a one on one 
relationship.... a non monogamous relationship could only work if BOTH
parties agreed to it and were very secure with themselves... I mean, if 
you truly love someone.... you tend to want to keep them to yourself...
it's hard to think of them being intimate with anyone else... at least, 
it is for me.

No shit. If I were involved in such a relationship, I would be
absolutely faithful to my partner--and I would have /no/ tolerance for
lack of faith on my partner's end. The point I am trying to make is
simply that an open relationship can work, and if your prospective
partner would like such a relationship that is not immediate grounds
for terminating all contact with that person. The attitude that a
relationship must, or even "should," be founded on sexual fidelity is
Manifest Bullshit--especially when the people involved will /claim/
that their relationship isn't based on sex while still behaving as
though it were.

I can say with absolute conviction, based on years of personal
experience, that that statement is patently, iredeemably false. I am
quite proud of the fact that Kelly and I have not only outlasted most
marriages as a couple, but we also share more intimacy than anyone else
I have ever met, and we still behave like a couple of newbies--very
affectionate, you know? Well, guess what...we've both had other lovers.
Surprise! It's done a lot of good for us, too; I can honestly say we're
both more intimate with one another and more solidly together because of
it. Your statement sounds nice in theory, kind of like "you can only
love one person at a time" or "if s/he wants other lovers it must mean
I'm not adequate/not good enough/whatever"...all those statements that
sound so good because they reinforce preconceived ideas that have been
hammered into us since day one...but in the real world, it just ain't
so. Yes, you CAN get hurt in an open relationship. So what? You can get
hurt in a closed relationship. Yes, an open relationship can be abused.
So? So can any other type of relationship. But when it comes right down
to it, an open relationship is not "virtually guaranteed" not to work
by any stretch of the imagination, as long as it's put together in such
a way that no violation of trust occurs on either side. Is it really
that difficult to conceive of a situation where your partner can take
another lover without any violation of trust?

Whoa there! I see a serious error in your line of reasoning...although
given that sentence suddenly a whole lot of your argument is a lot
clearer to me. First off, having a commitment and having other lovers
are not mutually exclusive; you can do both. If you've never actually
/done/ it you will have to take my word on it, but having multiple
lovers does not preclude a deep emotional commitment. Secondly, and
most importantly, having an open relationship does NOT mean your
partner can "sleep with whomever" s/he chooses. In fact, lemme say that
a little more emphatically:
 
HAVING AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP DOES *****!!!>>> NOT <<<!!!***** MEAN YOU
CAN SLEEP WITH WHOMEVER YOU CHOOSE!!
 
If you try to work it that way, you're right, you're just asking to get

I am afraid you missed my point. Yes, I believe that a "good" marriage,
one that involves two people who are truly committed to one another,
and are trusting, and so on can exist. I also believe that such a
relationship can exist without marriage.
 
My point had nothing to do with an inability to conceive of a good
marriage. My point is just the opposite, in fact: Marriage is primarily
a social convention. In a society where that convention holds little
or no meaning, there is simply no reason to get married. Why, pray
tell, should I get married? To demonstrate my commitment? Marriage is
no longer functionally a demonstration of commitment. To ensure that
my children, should I have them, grow up in a stable environment? There
are enough people out there, and even enough people ON THIS BULLETIN
BOARD, who have grown up in the splinters of a fragmented marriage to
demonstrate that marriage is no such thing. So what does that leave?
As a tax break? No; I have too much respect for what a marriage /should/
be to get married for economic reasons. Why, then, should I marry?
Marriage is a social artifact that has, functionally, lost its meaning.

Naah. In my experience, the above mentioned 'acts' are 'given'
because the people involved enjoy being physically affectionate, not
for any 'reasons'.

I was referring to those 'acts' on an either-sex basis.
 
Ours is a very strange society, where physical contact is automatically 
assumed to be a part of sex.
 
I talked to a friend last night about this very thing. If you look to 
other cultures of the world, same-sex physical contact is not taboo.

   It sounds like sex overshadows everything else in your relationships.
Would you agree with the statement: If she's not going to be monogamous
to me, she's not worth being close to?

I didn't want to get married (yet), she dropped most of the touching.
And when it looked like we wouldn't be having sex, she quit allowing me

I think an non sexual intimate relationship is /any/ relationship where 
you are very close with a person, (mentally linked, so to speak) but you
do not share sex with them... I have a few male friends whom I hug 
freely, kiss (I mean, we are talking pecks, here), share secrets with, 
we can talk about /anything/, but we are not nor have we ever been 
sexually involved.... but I'd say that we are as close if not closer 
than men that I /have/ been sexually involved with in the past... (yeah,
the very distant past).

I know open relationships can work, at one point in my marriage, my

because we eventually decided to go back to monogomy because we were 
both starting to feel the twinges of jealousy....(yeah, I know, I know).
 
If I were to become single again.... I believe that I would prefer an 
open relationship.... at least for a while.... I like the feeling of 
having my lover as my good friend as well, so I prefer to have a intimat
lover (not a bunch of one nighters) but variety does keep things 
interesting..... I dunno..... I just see your point.

     So you do understand.  Except for the slight tinge of jealously you
are correct.  You do have an honest relationship.  That is important. 
Also the fact that he would come and talk to you about it first is a 
plus and that is even more important.  Comunication, honesty, trust, 
love, respect, friendship are all very important they all rank number
one, none is more important than the other. A couple must have all of 
those 100% before the relationship is opened.  You can not begin a 
relationship open, then try to build the other stuff.
     It took Turtle and I two years before we began talking about 
opening our relationship.  It was easier for him because the only way I
knew was monogomy.  To be honest, I did not believe it could work, and
I just knew that would not work, then I saw it happen.  First I was with
a friend of his.  I learned from this experience that Turtle did not see
me as a slut, (feel free to inject any other word of your choice) and 
the incident not only improved communication but now I could tell him 
anything.  But I was not sure I could do the same for him.  But I did 
anyway.  My problem was not with him, but with the girl he chose.  I 
was not sure she could handle it.  And well I was correct.  And when she
got out of hand and hard to deal with, I just asked Turtle to stop and 
that was fine with him.  That told me I was important to him. And 
although he did want her phisicely he would not do anything to jepordize
us.  That is, I found out that with out a doubt I am the women he wants
to spend the rest of his life with, and no one is going to come between
us. Thats the way we are.  We don't do anything the other one does not
agree with.  And If one day, for some reason we choose to close our 
relationship again, then It will be something we both decide. But now it
is working for us so it will stay open.

I too, have friends to whom I emotionally linked. One of them is male, 
and its absolutely non-sexual.
 
Today's society treats sex as acommodity, taking it for granted. More 
often than not, it tends to seperate peop.
 
It would be interesting to learn the 'touch' custom, and their origins

SS>Ding. 
 
But that doesn't mean that I don't believe that an open relationship 
can't work..... there's just a different attitude involved there. 
I mean, if you had a friend, whom you really cared about and shared your
life with, you wouldn't mind them having other close friends, right? 
Well, if you had the same attitude about sharing sex with them and them
sharing sex with others...... that would be ok..... but if the attitude 
isn't right.... It isn't going to work.

It was the same way when my husband and I opened our relationship.... 
the problems started with "other" partners (they became jealous first) 
and that bled over into our relationship, when we saw that happening, 
we decided to call a halt..... As I said, we have been monogamous for 
many years now, and I'm not certain that I could return to an open 
marriage.... but I do know that if my husband wanted that.... he would 
talk to me about it.... 
Usually we communicate very well.... but he is a moody person and some-
times he builds these walls around him that I can't penetrate.... this
I can not learn to deal with no matter how I try... I always take it 
personally. I think that this is one of the flaws in our marriage. 
Whenever he puts that wall up, I start harping on him trying to get 
through, this agravates him further and I get my feelings hurt.... when
my feelings are hurt, I cry.... and when I cry, it makes him even more
shut off and angry...... so a small situation becomes a major stress 
bath until we finally talk...... which is sometimes a day or two later.
Meanwhile we both go around moping and feeling miserable...stupid eh? 
Except for when the wall is up, (which happens more and more lately) we
can talk about anything.......

Simply because I know that I will develop too strong of feelings for her

No.  Not really.  I'll explain that with your other question.

As far as monogamous goes as it pertains to whether or not I'd think
she's worthy of getting close to:  I don't decide someone's worth 
by their sexual orientation; whether it be straight, gay, bi, with
or without monogamy.  I would not date someone in a relationship
where she wanted an open relationship, and I wanted a monogamous one, 
because I would just be setting myself to get hurt.  (If I want a

TS>"physically intimate, close, non-sexual relationship"?

KO>The above mentioned 'acts' are usually given for assurance,

Kinda catch all, ain't it?  It may be physically close but intimate it
ain't.  Intimate implies something more serious than "Oh, it's so good 
to see you!" or "Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your dad...." or other
situations like that.  (The word intimate is difficult for me to fully
describe, so here goes:)  Intimacy is more of a "I am fond of you more
than anyone else." or "I care for you more than I care for anyone else,
more than I care for myself."  type of thing.  It follows that if you
feel that way for someone (and they for you) that sexual relations 
between thon should be exclusive...or else, you have cheapened what you
feel for the first one by doing the same thing with someone else.
 
Physically close, yes, this implies position.  But intimacy is something
else altogether.

That your best freind was screwing your girlfriend.  Some friend.  Tell

you like a rock?  Oh, surely, this could never happen between you and
Kelly, but for us other "abnormal sexual relation" type people, this

  You may be quite proud of the fact that you and Kelly have been 
together for a long time, and I congratulate you heartily. (Seriously.)
But almost NO ONE else is as set in that particular mindframe which you

Hmmm.  Depends largely on what type of commitment you're talking about,
I suppose.  If there is a very vague commitment, then I can see what you
mean.  But if you have a serious commitment, you have to define the 
terms of your commitment.
 
T>...haveing multiple lovers does not preclude deep emotional commitment
 
Oh, certainly not.  You simply diminish the amount you devote to each 
one.  There is just /so much/ emotion that you can give, without
getting bland about it.  You can't have "something special" with many
people, otherwise, there's nothing special about it.  It's cheapened.

You say that you can have a great time with a woman, kissing, touching,

   Ya know, that statement says one hell of a lot about society.  And
I'm not sure I like it.
     
   Let me be honest: I'm a relatively physical person, when I feel safe.
I don't mentally equate touching with sex. I was really, really shocked
when one of my dates showed me how much she equated the two: when it
came that it would not be a good idea for the two of us to have sex, she
also wanted to stop kissing, hugging -- even holding hands.

made it clear that she didn't want sex with me.  Even still, we stayed
extremely close friends, hugging and kissing occasionally. Well -- 
hugging lots. (She's getting married in December.)
   Many of my closest friends have been female... and most of them, I

   Yes, but that had nothing to do with an open or closed relationship.
We ddid *NOT* have an open rel;ationship (as in, we were not supposed
to have sex with anone ... uh, anyone else.) but we had close friends
of both genders outside the relationship.

what's your point?
    
   Seriously, the sentence I stated I still feel is excellent. If you
really want to knnow if your partner loves you,  if you truly want to
find out if she loves you, and if you're willing to face the fact that
sge might not love you, the best way of finding this information out
is by setting her free.  If you want to hold someone forever, if
you want to possess her forever -- it's not a good idea to set her
free.

Well, you got part of it right.  We never had sex.  (To be honest, she
seemed waaaay too eager -- I was internally flashing *caution* lights.)
    
   "Typical" woman, indeed!  Might be typical to your culture -- but
I'm used to New College types... and most of the women I've known
outside New College have also been relatively "physical."

   Yes, I would (and have!) told my girlfriend if/when I had sex with
another person.  And, yes -- I've taken the consequences.  Then again,
she did the same for me when she cheated on me.

Now I will try to not want to talk about it, but as soon as I here,
"Ok, do you want to talk about it, or pout about it?"  Then I usually am
ready to discuss it.
  
Although I will say, about the particular incident I was refering too, 
we have both learned and are more careful about who is aproved and who
is not, and why.  Then if we both are not satisified with the decision 
we have made, then the other person has no physical contact with the 
outside person.  ( I am not sure if I made any sense here or not. )

If that is the case, monogomas relationships also run this risk.  And

Yes he did do it with pryor aproval.  And no he was not a better lover
then Turtle.  But so what if he was.  Turtle means more to me then just
an excellent fuck any way.  Tim however was, at that time a friend, r
roomate, and a person that I slept with a few times, and yes it was just
a few.  Tim and I did not sleep together to begin a relationship, we 
slept together to have fun, and it was fun. But that all it was, now 
when Turtle and I sleep toghther it is fun plus a whole lot more.  The
whole lot more part is what keeps us together.  That is the part I have 
never shared with any other partner.  At least we are honest about our
needs, and when we are atracted to other people we tell each other, we
don't hide it.  We discuss it, If one of us does not like something 
about an outside party then the rules are set and followed.  An example
I am interested in someone. I tell Turtle.  He says no.  I say Ok. And
life goes on.  It can only be exciting if he would not be upset about 
what I was doing.  This is where you don't understand, I think, I do
believe you think an open relationship is constantly everyone having sex
with everyone else.  No.  It only works if everyone involved is happy.
If I am not happy about someone, then nothing happens.  If he is not
happy about someone , then nothing happens.  In the last 4 1/2 years
between the two of us we have had a total of 5 lovers.  Now that is 
Turtle 3, other then me, and Crystal 2, other then Turtle.  Now, how
many people, maybe yourself included, have had more monogomas 
relationships then that.  My sister is a good example, she is strictly
monogomas.  She became active at the age of 17.  She is now 20.  In this
time she has had 7 monogomas relationships.  I became active at age 18.
I am now 25.  I have had 6 lovers.  Three of them were before Turtle.  I
don't know weighing the odds, my sisiter has a greater chance of 
catching something then me.  Now what are your, or your friends odds?
Anyway I am running out of space.  Think about it.

(by Turtle and you) and Turtle had someone who was approved (by you

each other?  And what about the lovers that those two may have had?

Yes, there are types of love.  There can be love bewteen freinds,
and there can be love between relatives, and there can be the special
love shared between two people...this is intimacy.  Love is not
predicate on sex, of course.  But I feel that sex is connected with
love.  And that type of love is something to be shared between two
people...if you try to distribute it, you end up cheapening it.  It is
FINITE.

Yes, I can't agree with you more on the STD worries, however, when you
jump from one monogomas relationship to another, you risk the same.  
And one thing you seem to be missing.  When Turtle and I are with 
anyone else We Are Using condoms.  It is only when we are with each 
other we do not use condoms.  We met each other early enough in our
active sex lives that we know we are clean and want to keep us condom 
free.  However when we take on other partners extra precautions are
taken.  Can you say, with total conviction, that you are as cautious
with all your monogomas relationships?

Turtle I feel it.  BUT when I sleep with someone else it is different.
It is more of a deep caring thing, it is intimit.  I also believe If you
keep falling deeply in love with people over, and over again.  And the
relationships keep going sour then the depth of your love gets shallow.
And you never find happiness.

whatever reason, then the deals off... that's because you two are still 
"together" and anyone else whom you make love with is still basically 
an outsider and not "part" of Your relationship with each other. 
 
As for the walls issue. I don't know how much longer I can handle this 
situation, my husband just refuses to talk it out. It's like, "Nothings
wrong, I'm just tired." Or "Nothings wrong, why do you keep asking me 
that?" Both said with a pissed off tone of voice... I don't know... 
Everything was fine until I got the cyst... then came the surgery, and 
I really felt alone during that time.... It was like, the whole affair

He's never been like that before. He seems so preoccupied with "what

Maybe something is going on that I should know about... I only hope that
he'll come to terms with it and discuss it with me.... if he doesn't

C>Yes, I also feel sex is connected with love.
 
No, not just connected. They are interlinked.
 
C>...keep falling in love over and over again...you love gets shallow.
 
And if you don't bother to love the one you make love to, that's just
as shallow.  (Looks around, notes thin ice, backs up a few steps...)
I mean, yes, naturally you feel as if you care deeply for the person
you are making love to...some sort of a hormonal thing, I guess.  But
you said it yourself...it's different from the kind of real love that
you feel for Turtle.  It may be intimate, but it's a really ersatz 
type of intamacy.  It's a...surrogate---substitution type of intamacy.
It's fake...it's nothing more than simple lust in disguise.
 
Oh, shit...listen to me...  "Ah, yes, ye sinners!  Cast away the Lust
from you and only indulge in the love sanctified by the Lord!  Can you
say, Hallejula?" 
 
Well, anyway, I'm serious...it's not really love.  And news flash: I 
don't fall in love too often.  Love is a really serious thing, not for
casual use.

   Oh, so the person with the most love is the person who holds love
inside the most?  In other words, the person who is perpetually grouchy,
has no friends, few acquaintences, is the person who has used up the
least amount of his (or her!) finite supply of love, and should there-
fore be the most deserving of love?
     
   Give me a break.
     
   <Ghods, this will sound corny!>  There's no limit to the amount of
love, joy, or happiness a person can give, or receive.  There's no limit
to the number of fond memories a person can have.  Love isn't a 
commodity to be hoarded away; it is possible to love many people at 
once.  (Always expressing this physically isn't a good idea.)  
   
   Read Leo Buscaglia... he says it much better than I do.
     
   Again, I don't believe that loving one person lessens the amount you
can love another... provided you love each person for their own
individuality.  (If you love someone because they remind you of someone
else... that's a different story.)  Love's not a concrete object that
can be withered away.

   HIV can be tested for within six months. But point taken.
    
   Let me try to summarize my position... would you do the same?
    
Love:  It is extremely possible to *feel* love for many people, so long
       the love is unique to each person.
   
Sex:   An open relationship can work -- if the two partners are 
       extremely secure with each other.  But that's rare.  And diseases
       today are one of the best reasons not to make a relationship
       open.... but it still can work.

Aha! Thank you, Saavik.  Even you found it strange that when we weren't
going to have sex, she wanted me to stop holding her hand...
     
   As I've said before, when I trust someone, I can be very physically
affectionate (if she also enjoys such.)  I do NOT let people get
uncomfortable, and I understand the word "Stop." But to go from an
physically close relationship (long hugs and kisses; short backrubs 
only...) to a "hands off" relationship completely confused me.  I 
wanted to hear y'alls reactions to it.

   Touche!  Jenn knew that she was always free to leave our relationship
when she chose, without hassle.  (Okay.  With some questions about why,
yes.)  But I made sure that she knew that I would (and, DO, dammit!)
miss her.
   
   "Setting them free" doesn't necessarily mean opening the relationship
in the way Turtle and Crystal have.  It just means (well, this should be
done BEFORE marriage...) that either one can leave the relation with few
hassles.  If they stay with you, you know you've got something real.

It certainly does. I am happy with a relationship that is either open

Same thing that would happen if she chose to break off the sexual part
of our relationship for any /other/ reason. It would cause a significant
change in the nature of our relationship, although I doubt that it would
end the relationship. If Kelly decides to do something which affects our
relationship, it doesn't matter /why/ she made that decision; the only
thing that's significant is the fact that she /did/ make that decision.
If she chose to stop being my lover, it wouldn't matter two squats if
it was because she were monogamous with another man or she simply
decided to be celibate or she became a Jehovah's Witless; the simple
fact is that we would no longer be lovers, and our relationship would
change accordingly.

Now that is just plain silly. Real damn silly. But at least it's also

Why the hell do people insist on tangling love and sex into a big, nasty
knot that can't really be sorted out? I never could figure that one
out. Sex is a matter of biology; love is a matter of psychology; the
two are not necessarily related. Predicating the one on the other is

Well, to start with, it simply doesn't work into the big branching
pyramid that you describe. That sort of situation is inherently
unstable. It's nice in theory, but you won't see it happen in the
real world...human sexual interactions aren't that tidy.
 
Also, let us assume that someone in this mythical pyramid of yours
contracts a social disease. You seem to keep using that as an argument
against sexually open relationships, on the grounds that disease will
propogate through such a relationship...I got news for you, if
sexually transmitted diseases propogated that way, almost every sexually
active human being on the planet would be infected by now. Simple
epidemology shows that disease propogation through a given population
falls off as a function of 1/logn(x), where x is the number of
intervening steps between case 0 (the original point of infection) and
the point of interest, presumably yourself. If it fell off as a function
of 1/x like you seem to imply. the human race would have long since
ceased to exist...but it just plain don't work that way. AIDS, in
particular, is a very difficult disease to transmit; unless you engage
in homosexual sex or share contaminated needles or blood products, it's
only moderately transmissable, less so than hepatitis or any of the more
familiar STD's. In short, your argument doesn't hold up to reality
very well.

I agree with your point, but I have something to add:
Not all intimate relations, though intimate, are sexual.
Two people can care for each other, and sex isn't part of the picture.
 
Some examples would be trust, confiding in someone, or just being there 
in a time of need.

C> Can you say, with total conviction, that you are as cautious with all
C> your monogamous relationships? 
  
This question wasn't directed toward me, but I decided to answer it 
because it will help me make a point for the Specialist and myself. 
  
Remember the "she has two lovers and those two lovers have two lover, 
and so on, and so on," situation that the Specialist brought up? 
Well, I haven't quite had that but lets just go with a similar situation
 
Lets say that I have AIDS (just for the sake of making my point)  I will
use one actual case,  I meet this girl, and give her AIDS.  She is now
planning to marry her fiance and father of her unborn child. (Because 
of me, she has it, her fiance has it, and now her unborn child has it.)
......I meet another girl, (I give her AIDS too), she meets this guy, an
(and) he and I became friends.  (she gives him AIDS.)  My friend at 
school has this girl that he sleeps with on occasion, I became her lover
for a while.  (I give her AIDS)  He, later on, slept her again. (He 
now has contracted AIDS from her.)  During the time that I was with this
girl, I was involved with a threesome, with her and her friend. (So now,
her friend has AIDS too)  My friend (from school) now has a new
girlfriend.  (He gives AIDS to her.)  The girl that I had the threesome 
with now has a new boyfriend. (so, he gets AIDS too.)  I have had two 
lovers since her, and, lets just say the gets AIDS for me as well.
  
To the best of my knowledge I don't have AIDS, but if I did have AIDS fo
(for) the past 10 months you can see the number I people I could have 
infected.  (BEAR in mind that these are only the people I know of, there
may be more people involved than I know about.)  So, if I have had AIDS 
(hypothetically speaking) for the past 10 months, I have given it to 
AIDS to NINE people that I know of.  If you ask me, that's pretty 
heavy, nine people, all people I know personally, infected with AIDS 
because of me.

You're absolutely correct.  I had a friend (or so I thought) tell me we 
weren't friends anymore.  He just said it out of the blue one day.  He 
said we were just aquaintences(sp).  I asked why, he said I was a bright
guy, I should figure it out.  What in heavens name is that supposed to 
mean.  Well we parted company.  After thinking about it, I concluded 
that we were never friends to begin with. After all, a friend would at
least give you the chance to make it right if you did something to 
offend.  To this day, I dont know what I did...if anything.  So I say
SCREW him.  I dont need friends like that.  I asked, begged him to tell 
me what I did.  Nope...he refused to tell me.  So fine.  He never
wanted a friendship.  He didnt want to try either.

New College is at the very northern tip of Sarasota, just west of
the airport.  When you stop at Turtle's, you're real close to it.
     
   There's a few problems: New College is also a very closed society.
It does NOT like "outsiders" (or "townies") invading its ground...
Until you get to know a fair number of the students, expect some cold

   Yes, but as Turtle points out, it's not so easy to catch AIDS as
you might think.  If you have unprotected sex (i.e. no condoms...),
you're more likely to catch it -- but even if you have unprotected
anal sex with a known AIDS carrier, you're not guaranteed to catch it.
(Of course, you'd be quite stupid to try that stunt.)

>Let me...make a point for The Specialist and myself.
 
Nice try. It doesn't really work that way, though; the situation you
describe has nothing to do with "open" or "closed" relationships, and in
any event an AIDS carrier does not give AIDS to everyone he/she sleeps
with. AIDS is actually only ,arginally communicable; there are
documented cases of people having unprotected sex with an AIDS carrier
dozens of times without contracting the disease themselves, and the
risk becomes much smaller if you have /responsible/ sex to begin with.
No disease--NO disease, none, not one, not even Lhasa Fever (the most
communicable disease known to man), /no/ disease is transmitted every
time an infected person comes into contact with an uninfected person.
It would be much more difficult than you think for you to infect all the
people in your list, and if you're using a condom it would be an order
of magnitude more difficult. If that weren't the case, there would
be many hundreds of times more cases in the United States than there
actually are.

after a week of asking "What's wrong?" and getting.. "Nothing, nothing 
is wrong." yet he went on being silent and unresponsive... I just blew
last night... I told him if he didn't talk to me I was going to scream..
soooo, he pulled out his guitar and played for hours... (typical 
musician trick when they don't want to deal with reality), we finally 
did talk, but by the time he was willing to talk, I was so upset..... 
there were so many things on my mind... I just told him everything I was

The "built-in picks" were WONDERFUL for classical guitar.  I don't
normally play with normal, separable-from-finger picks, though... you
can really only play one melodic line at a time with them.
      
   Of course, picks are also wonderful for teasing hair, and they do
in a punch as a very strange army (wearing only a little blue paint...)

   Tantric Yoga is a meditative technique involving sex.  The woman
involved gets multiple orgasms.  The man... well, he gets to meditate.
    
   Tantric Yoga teaches men either not to cum -- or, if he does, to,
well... cum inwardly, into the urine sac. (It's not that great for the
man.)

Love is something palpable.  It can be withered away.  And trying to 
distribute something which should be reserved for someone special (note:
some ONE! not some PEOPLE) can only lessen the emotion -- loving becomes
commonplace.  Ordinary.  Then it;s not love anymore.  It's just "Hey,

There's nothing strange about it.  The typical woman "leads a man on"

   I'm not denying it's possible to screw people indiscriminantly --
without really caring for the person.  "Push-ups with a friend" as the
phrase goes.  That's not what I'm talking about.
     
   I have close friends, both sexes, who I love.  That has nothing to do
with intercourse... I simply feel I can share anything with them. (I
wouldn't consider having sex with most of them... that's not the way our
relationships are.)  My relationship with Jenn did not subtract from my
love for them, though it might have taken time away from seeing them.

one person more than another -- but it ain't necessarily so.  Love is
a poset (as Turtle might put it.)  
     
   Given two different people that I love, I MAY love one person more
than another, but I always love one DIFFERENTLY than I love the other.
To phrase it bluntly and selfishly, each of my close friends serves some
emotional need I have... no one person I've found has shared all of my
interests in the same amount as my own interests.  No one person I've
found has exactly fit my emotional needs perfectly, so I search out a
balance among my friends.  And I do the same for my friends...
   (Ghods! What a computerized way of sounding!  But it's how I think.)

Because I CAN'T.  I can't FLY either...and neither can you!  
 
I can go out and grab a handfull of dirt.  There's plenty of it.  It's
cheap.  On the other hand, plutonuim is rare.  
I can go out and love many people (subjectively speaking), and my love 
would be pretty easy to come by.  But if I love only one person, that 
love is very special.  It would be the rare thing.

Yes, that is true.  For instance, when referring to your father, do you
call him "elderly gentleman" or, "old man"?  I would refer to my father
(given those two choices) as "old man" [:)] but not in front of him! 
In front of him I would use "elderly gentleman"...therefore that 
expression (or word) is better than the other.
You could also use numbers.  If one number is not the other, then one
must be greater or less than the other.  
 
What is a poset?

   If you really believe that love is "lost" once it's given away, then
you must accept the person you should try to get to "love" you is she
who has not "loved" yet.  She who has "loved" the most is useless to
your definition of love.
     
   I doubt that.  Love is a resource renewed daily.  One can give away
all the love you "have" -- and still find more love to give.
     
DF> I have close friends, both sexes, that I love.
TS> I think that you have confused love with close friendship.
    
   The only difference I've ever felt was in degree, not in kind.

Let me take these out of order:
   
TS> What's a poset?
   
   A poset is a "partially ordered set," and it's a part of lattice
theory.  Basically, if you take a set (say, the set of all living 
people), and you take an "ordering relation" on the set (say, X is
a parent or an ancestor of B) that does NOT need to operate on all
possible pairs (that is, we don't need to assume that Jimmy Smith,
in Sarasota is either an ancestor or descendent of Hoo Wang Chao,
in Beijing.)  Does that make sense?
    
   You might consider all the words or phrases in English for the 
best one to call your father at a certain time, as an "ordering
relation."  You'd probably rather call him "elderly gentleman" than
"old man" when he's around.  (Take the nnext sentence seriously.)
But would you rather call him "blue suede shoes" or "Altoids 
peppermints"?  Neither, of course. 
    
   Going on to your second example of numbers, sure: you can impose
an ordering relation that makes it into a "completely ordered set."
But there are other relations that don't.  (For example, let a < b
if a factors into fewer primes than b does.)
      
   What does all this have to do with our topic of conversation?
Continued, next message.

   What does this have to do with love?  That was a very complicated
way of saying that though I might "love" one person more than I do
another, most of the time, I simply can't compare how I feel to one
to how I feel for another.
   
   It is impossible to, say, rank Crystal among my other close friends.
Or Barbara.  Or Wolf.  I love them all in unique ways, for their unique
characteristics.  (And I do NOT accept the idea that if you have an
ordering on a set, there must be a "highest" element in the set.)

Part of Tantric Buddhism has to do with experiencing Life in the
context of Enlightenment. This includes sexual activities which
"enhance" the participants' "depth" of experience. This isn't really
the place to discuss this subject, but I do find it fascinating: I'd
suggest reading a book on the subject....

Basically, you're right, EXCEPT for the part that "It's not that great
for the man." Tho I've never practiced it, I've read that it is
an enlightening experience for the man, both spiritually AND sexually!

Whew!! This is a FASCINATING conversation (no, debate)!
My 2 cents: if each of us were to free ourselves from
limiting beliefs, we could let ourselves be who we more
deeply are, love who we love, do what we do, dream what
we dream...
           ...and rarely become constipated!
