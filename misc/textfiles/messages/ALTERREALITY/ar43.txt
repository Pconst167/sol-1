I haven't heard of any external line filters for computer systems, but
I'm sure such a device isn't impossible. BYE does it in software by
weeding out certain characters and character combinations, like
curly braces and things of that nature, but the result is you can't
use those characters in messages. In theory, it should be possible
to build some sort of line filter, although I suspect it'd be of
somewhat limited usefulness, since it wouldn't be able to fill in
missing information that wasn't simply obscured by static...

On the subject of drug legalization: Depends on which drugs we're
talking about. Drugs like pot, it'd be a damn good idea; when it
comes right down to it, weed is a safer intoxicant than alcohol, it's
easy enough to produce that you can't really control it effectively
by outlawing it (unlike things like heroin or PCP, you don't exactly
need a full-fledged lab to produce it), and the money we're wasting
to fight it could be used for other things. Harder drugs like PCP
and crack: No way. They are simply too dangerous and too destructive.
On the other hand, I think we're fighting them in a totally asinine
way; as long as there is a demand for them they will be supplied,
period, and no force known to man is going to prevent that from 
happening. Only by attacking the root of the problem, by way of
things like drug education, Federally-sponsored drug rehab programs
(most private programs cost between four hundred and a thousand
dollars a day, for Christ's sake!) and other efforts aimed at the
demand are we likely to see significant results.
   Incidentally, while the DEA is crowing over the fact that a price
of a key in Miami has gone up from $16K to about $24K in the last
year, it appears that that's more because all the Columbian drug lords
are in the process of moving to Brazil than because the interdiction
program is actually /working/. It also doesn't really mean a whole
lot from the street point of view; the price per gram's been hovering
at around $120 for a long time, it's just that it's heavily stepped-on
now whereas a couple of years ago it was commonplace to find 85% pure
coke on the streets. That's rather uncool from a public health point of
view, since the stuff tends to get cut with everything from Borax to
fiberglass filler...thank you George Bush, you always have the well-
being of your citizens in mind.

There is more than a little evidence to suggest that fear and hatred
of people who are different from yourself is biologically-based,
rather than learned. From an evolutionary standpoint, people who are
not members of your group represent competition for the same resources
you need, and are therefore potential threats; also, the best way to
ensure the survival of your own genetic line is to eradicate other lines
that share the same ecological niche as you do. It's an outdated and
obsolete instinct, but it's still largely instinct.

While I'll admit there's a certain apropriateness to buying a PS/1 in

people who own them are for some inexplicable reason insufferably proud

can't even spell "PS/1" to begin with, much less "8086" or "68000,"
become a rather significant market force that encourages the develop-
ment of tens of thousands of bad PS/1 word processors and other
dippy applications at the cost of development for more interesting
machines. Then you start to see bad prots from IBM's cropping up on
Amigas and other, more powerful computers, and you see whole
industries grow up with the entirely unfounded notion that only by
developing applications for IBM hardware to the exclusion or near-
exclusion of all other machines can they stay in business, which only
increases the arrogance of the people who spent too much on PS/1's

Gosh, you mean there's grey in these pictures, too?  Got to change that
dithering algorithm.  Rats.
 
The idea that there's more than two sides to most issues seems to be
quite beyond a lot of people; the idea that there's more than one way of
looking at the /same/ side is fuzzy to even more.
    If someone burns the flag, they are symbolically burning the
country.  If this wasn't the case, there wouldn't be any reason /anyone/
got upset over it.  But are they being disrespectful to the ideals of
the Constitution, or are they being disrespectful to the practice of it?
    As a case in point, there was an art exhibit here a while ago which
had an American flag partly dipped in a pool of oil.  Everyone was
outraged over it; the museum was broken into twice, and eventually the
exhibit was removed.  The artist's point, however, was that American
ideals are being held hostage to the interests of big business (such as
oil companies), and that as the environment is destroyed by such lack
of foresight, America goes with it.  It sounds to me like the "flag
desecrator" was more patriotic, perhaps, than those denying him the
right to make that comment.
 
Most flag-burning cases can't make the same claim, but even so, the
reason that America was actually founded was because English citizens
were tired of having no ability to voice their criticisms of their
government.  This is why freedom of speech, with /no/ conditionals
about patriotism, was guaranteed in the Bill of Rights to begin with --
to make sure that American citizens have the right to criticize their
government.
    Whether or not you violently disagree with flag-burning (or it makes
you violently ill, even), the day that the flag-burners absolutely
cannot make their point in that manner is the day they have won.

was sent into battle because the original commander was stuck on another
planet and she was the highest-ranking qualified officer left, and she
ended up becoming a hero of the battle, something the higher brass
wasn't too pleased with).  It is about the furthest thing from Conan
that I can think of in terms of philosophy, characterization, writing
and (especiall when you talk about the Marvel Conan) overall quality
I can think of.  This friend also happens to be a Green Beret.

The fall of the Roman Empire cannot be blamed on Christianity.  That the
Catholic Church was the institution that tried to fill the gap could be
considered unfortunate, or at least the attitudes (primarily the one
that knowledge is reserved for priests) that came with it.  However,
it moved in, one suspects, because it was the only institution around
that was able to.
 
> In any event, I'm not convinced that going out and killing your

It isn't.  However, the Crusades were, in a sense, latecomers to a long
legacy of killing your neighbors in that region.  Your earlier comment
about the Islamic nations being kinder to strangers only holds true if
those strangers aren't a perceived threat, just like Chrisitanity -- or
a lot of other "empires."  The fight over the "holy lands" of Islam,
Judaism and Christendom was around before the Crusades and has persisted
long, long after.
   While it's certainly not a defense of Christianity, I suspect that
the reason the list of "charges" against the religion is so long is that
it's been the predominant institution in the Western World and thus has
had the time and power to screw things up to a much greater extent than
other institutions.  Assuming that a state of anarchy can't exist in a
region for too long, since it's really a fundamentally more unstable
situation than an empire beset by enemies, I have serious doubts as to
whether any of the likely alternatives to the Holy Roman Empire would
have a significantly better track record.

> I mean, their popularity has to say something for them.
 
The Commodore-64 is still the best-selling microcomputer of all time,
yet its heyday came and went during the MS-DOS reign.  "Rambo" was also
an immensely popular movie, and in fact, all of the top 5 money-making
movies with the exception of "Batman" are sequels.  So, it would seem
that (a) popularity is not an indication of quality, and (b) people
would rather stick with the known and trite rather than the new and
(potentially) daring.
    The PS/1 is new, but only in terms of case design.  People are
impressed with it because it's a "low end" 286 machine with IBM's name
on it and VGA graphics inside.  That's all fine and dandy, but you can
get true 16-bit machines with comparable graphics for less, both in the
MS-DOS architecture and out.  It is still bundled with business
applications -- fairly mediocre ones, by MS-DOS standards -- and has
a rather boneheaded GUI to make things almost, but not quite, as easy
as a Macintosh.  (As Byte magaztem a direct question and get a

Their popularity doesn't say a bloody damn thing about /them,/ it says
something for IBM's marketing muscle. Popularity and quality are two
totally unrelated concepts. Yes, some people are impressed with them.
Most of those people have never used another computer, or never used
another computer more sophisticated than a C=64. Again, has nothing
to do with the quality of the machine itself. I don't like it because
it's not expandable, it's outrageously overpriced, it's based on a
slow and not terribly well-designed architecture, it runs an eight-bit
operating system that was obsolete in 1984 on a sixteen-bit processor
that was specifically designed for a bus it's not using, it's con-
structed with surface-mount technology that makes it, essentially, a
throwaway computer (you can't service or repair the motherboard), it
claims to have VGA graphics but is limited to a tiny color palette,
it's billed as the ultimate easy-to-use machine but in actuality its
user interface is neither as sophisticated nor as intuitive as the Apple
interface it was ripped from, it's underpowered, particularly for the
price, and its sole purpose in life is as a marketing ploy to wedge
IBM farther into the PC market (and even IBM will tell you that).
Other than that, the only thing I object to about it is that it's
built on a pathetic bus and it's ugly.

   It's been mentioned around here many times that the sales of a 
computer have no bearing whatsoever on the quality of said computer. I 
mean 2 Live Crew sold tons of records, and their music is the worst 
thing I've ever heard called "music". Also, most people might buy a PS/1
because the support is good or they just don't want a different computer
and don't know what else is out there...
 
  I myself don't trust a computer in which you must replace a large 
portion of the machine any time a smaller part breaks down.

  Well, if you are taking some sort of drugs (like was implied earlier 
in the message), stop, and it should help. I know someone who was taking
drugs quite often and considered herself a manic depressive. Now she's n
not taking drugs anymore (I believe) and she's no depressed anymore.

Astrology existed well before Islam existed. Such astronomy as was
necessary for the pursuit of astrology also existed. According to my
Islamic Studies professor, though, both astronomy as a pure (ie,
unconnected with fortunetelling, "the will of the gods," and similar
nonsense) and history the way we understand the term were Islamic
innovations. There is a HELL of a difference (pardon the expression)
between the off-the-cuff fast and loose "history" as it appears in the
Bible and history as a serious discipline, and Ibn Khaldun is generally
regarded by pretty near everyone to be the world's first true historian.
There's more to history than saying "King Izod raised his taxes
yesterday; man, that ticks me off!"

   It's one of my idealisms. Basically, I'm saying that people the world
over have to become aware of the cultures outside their own. In other
words, one of the roads to peace is global understanding and acceptance.
We're afraid of that which we don't understand, so we must make 
ourselves and others aware of other cultures; other ideas. The United
States has tried to make itself isolated from the world for too long --
then it tried to become the global policeman. Neither solution will help
the world (especially including the U.S.) grow together. Nothing 
terribly profound there, really.
   Basically, for the U.S, it means an acceptance that we're no longer
"number one" in everything -- and that we're now receiving some of the
same exploitation we once gave to other countries. It means that we
don't operate in a vacuum; that other countries, other ideas, other
basic philosophies do exist. And without a knowledge of them, we'll
fall further and worther behind in the world's eyes.

   I did. The four <or maybe six or seven> least logical "mathe-

universes before, why did it take them so long to figure out they were
jumping from fiction-universe to fiction-universe?
   
   Both of those were some of the worse, most "escapist" Heinlein.
(They weren't his worst novel, however. His very last novel was.)

Hmmm... it seems to me that politicking (that is, telling your voters
how good of a job you're doing) and being a politician (that is, making
sure your voters' interests are being served) are entirely different
skills. We have many fine actors in Congress and the Senate who act

Okay.  You have a right to say that IBMs are really trashy computers. 
But don't expect me to share that view.  Sure, there are better systems
on the market, some prices a hell of a lot more reasonably, I might add.
But IBM still sets a lot of precedents, are still VERY well respected
(at least among SOME), and really deserve credit for being what they are
in the computer world.

With that I hAve to agree.  Japan is a perfect example.  They killed
people who came to there shores.  After many years under the daimyos 
(spelling) and various warlords   and ultimately the shogun, they 
realized that if they were to     rule the world (which was the goals of
the emperor) they would have to   learn the ideologies of the world and 
glean from them what they thought  was needed to rule the world. (ex: 
learned from german army until defeated in ww1 then I believe they went 
to French(?)...not sure)

No. That "cancer drug" is actually an extract of apricot pits; it's

Well, the closet only contains objects which are not being illuminated.
If you shed light in the closet, the objects would be illuminated and
therefore they would no longer be in the closet. Sometimes, just for
fun, I turn the closet light on and off and on and off...
 
Of course, when I turn the light on, the objects inside are being
illuminated so they aren't in the closet. But when they aren't in the
closet, they aren't being illuminated any more, so they are. It's
kinda fun to watch other people's stuff simultaneously exist within and
not within my closet...

... What I don't like is that a lot of rap uses the same un-musical beat

idiots. They look like they've been drinking and are about to fall over

You got it. Although I'm not absolutely certain about Oriental history
and culture (yo, Turtle!), what you've said sounds similar to my ideas.
Except, of course, the bit about ruling the world. The easiest way to
do that, of course, is to have the biggest armies and weapons -- which
the U.S. already has.

   Having to listen to ANY song once every fifteen minutes would drive
me a little crazy, myself. I'd be about to ask how you manage to sell
such things to people of fixed income, but I thought of what I was 
doing last summer -- a position straight out of Doonesbury. Trying
to "sell" the Republican Senators to the Hispanic community. (I speak
Spanish fairly well.) It's convinced me never to vote for Connie Mack.
       
   Anyway, the only early Heinlein that I remember is "Stormship 
Troopers" -- a fairly good book. But the person I've just been sold
on was Mercedes Lackey. Try her out, sometime!

UltraSheep merchandise is actually a real possibility...Wratt is working

Ron Jon/Bad Dog surfer shirts wandering around. It'll probably be some
disgusting flourescent color, with an "UltraSheep" logo on the front
and a huge Da-Glo pic of UltraSheep himself on the back. They should
be rather cool (and expensive, but oh well).

product that will control the itch.  It is not a cure, but if you stop

  Okay, concern #1 has been settled. I /did/ pay the right amount. Now, 
nobody has concured on /why/ I paid that much. Mike Hickmon said it was 
because I didn't get the "neat-o plastic bag" and Tyler said it was

AH but we don't have the biggest  army (china w/200 million). Also the 
Soviet army is larger. That is why we are nuke loaded in the persian 
gulf.  It is no secret the US will go nuclear early if things go badly. 
I knew someone who was in the     armed forces in Viet Nam.  We were 
nuke loaded then too.  Didn't knowthat did you...

I've tried it, it don't work on mefor some reason.  I finally had to go 
to the clinic and get a shot of cortizone.  That took care of the 
swelling but not the itch.  I finally went to the market  and got a tube
of cort creme.  That took care of the itch temporarily.  After 2 weeks 
going on three, it is finally going away....YEAH HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE 
AGAIN...

 Naw. he doesn't even eat a lot. He just got that big by himself. Got

Funny, I wrote a paper for English on a cat that stayed with us for a

paper up, and named the cat Omaha. <snicker>

  I have here in my hands a TV Guide report on "Is TV going too far?"...
I seem to get the impression that the article is a bit biased. I'm also 
upset that they consider talking to five families a genunine "survey" to
find out what offends people on TV. Anyone else read this article??

Not really. Cyberpunk was invented by Bruce Sterling ("Islands in the

Contrary to popular belief, the answer is not "42" as previously
suspected. Rather, the answer is "three cups of lima beans, two ounces
of guacomole, sixteen small flightless birds, and blue."

>I called several times, but it was never answered.
 
Sorry 'bout that. My computer was busy doing kinky links with an
Amiga 2000HD; I dragged this 'puter over to a friend's and hooked
'em up at 19.2K baud so I could transfer a bunco of files back and
forth. It ended up taking longer than I'd anticipated, since I also
ended up calling some Amiga BBSes from her 'puter and downloading a
bunch of stuff from there, too.
 
...aah, Amiga. Where else can I do a batch file transfer as a background
task, and as each file comes in fork off a new process that works on
translating the file from .GIF format to .IFF format while I have a
Mountain Dew and relax? 'Course, with only a meg of memory things
start getting a little cramped after you've got four or five programs
running at once, but oh well...

No, "The Cat Who Walks Through Walls" is about a singular cat (Pixel)

They're currently fielding over a million soldiers; that's not small,
dude. They don't spend very much on their army, and as a result it's
underequipped and badly trained, but it's very, very large.

Well, New College is setting up a screen-printing outfit right now.
There are three shirts I'd like to make: an A/R T-shirt, an
UltraSheep T-shirt, and an "I Visited Sunny Beiruit, God's Own
Paradise on Earth" T-shirt (the latter wuld be burned, scorched, and
shot full of holes before wearing). Of the three, the Beiruit one is the
most likely to appear first, since Wratt and I are nominally working on
the art now. The UltraSheep shirt would likely be /very/ expensive
(probably around $18 a pop), so making that one may have to wait for
more financial resources to avail themselves.

Laetril, although calling it a "drug" is kind of stretching the
definition of the word. "Drug" is a term usually applied to sub-
stances which are physiologically active.
