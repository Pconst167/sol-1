>All that Fortran can do, Pascal can do...
 
Sorry. Wrong. Have you ever really gotten in to FORTRAN? Oh well.
FORTRAN lets you do direct memory swapping and direct editing of
low memory, Pascal emphatically does not. (Wirth would have a stroke
if he thought anyone was trying that sort of trick in Pascal.)
FORTRAN lets you declare numeric variables as Integer, Real, and
Complex, Pascal doesn't. You might be able to kludge something in
Pascal to deal with imaginary numbers, but it'd hurt. FORTRAN lets
you declare double-precision and extended-precision variables that are
64 bits wide; not Pascal. FORTRAN allows implied DO-loops; Pascal
doesn't allow implied anything. FORTRAN allows the programmer to change
the index in the middle of a FOR-NEXT loop; Pascal does not. (That
itself leaves out a lot of really efficient programming techniques).
If Pascal could really do everything FORTRAN could, do you really think
FORTRAN would be as immensely popular as it is?

Well, I know this guy who took an Atari 800, built a bank-switched
memory module and a really weird expansion box for it, and connected
a meg of RAM and 6 disk drives to it...so thpth! And what's wrong
with Atari Basic? So you have to dimension a string variable before
you use it. So? pascal makes you use Packed Arrays, which are the
same thing...THPTH!

Dear the ever-Pascal bashing Turtle,
   Pardon me. We're talking about different levels here. Okay -- 
GRANTED: Pascal does not have an "imaginary number" type. GRANTED:
Pasccal cannot self-modify in the middle of itself. GRANTED: Pascal
is slower, requires all variables to be previously defined, and, in
general, is not an efficient way of writing programs.
   Also, GRANTED: Fortran was used to encode the Voyager spacecraft.
   However, there is NO computation that Fortran (or any other major
imperative language) that Pascal -- or any other major imperative
language -- couldn't do. (Now -- whether or not they could do them
in real time is another question.) Programming techniques differ widely.

Atari Basic is completely unlike any other Basic known to mankind.
   1. There ARE no string arrays, and strings have a maximum length
      of 255. (Not much of a chance of simulating them, either!)
   2. The computer has an OFF (or BYE) command, dropping you to the
      "Atari 800 -- Notepad" mode.
   3. All error messages were encoded ("ERROR 37 IN LINE 500") -- I
      wrote an automatic code to take care of it.
   4. ML programming on the Atari was a BITCh, requiring one to go
      from the TOP of memory -- making sure one doesn't accidently
      re-draw over the screen, and tricking the 'pooter into thinking
      you have less memory, and lots of other things...
   5. The Atari THOUGHT it could only have three colors (okay -- four,]
      including the background) on the screen at once. To change this,
      one must change the colors using a special interrupt while
      the TV screen (or monitor) is in mid-flight between lines. You
      have EXACTLY enough time to change colors... if you bitch a lot.
   6. The 6502 processor has three registers. Three.
          (Geeez -- I'm getting away from the Atari Basic into the
           Atari in general. Now returning to your regularly scheduled
           program, already in progress.)
   7. Atari Basic regularly clocked in as the slowest Basic available
      for microcomputers in its price range.
   8. Because Atari Basic was etched in ROM, there was no easy way to
      fix the two major bugs (known since about six months after the
      computer was created) in it. By then, programmers had employed
      the bugs as part of their programming style... so fixing them
      would destroy their programs.
   
   I'm glad someone found a use for his Atari. I enjoyed it while it 
lasted; but I've moved on.

Tsk, tsk, tsk. As a theoretical computer scientist, you should know
better than that. Machine language is, of course, the lowest level of
programming, and absolutely anything the computer is capable of can be
done in machine language by definition. High-level languages are
essentially constructs designed to take a finite set of expressions
and convert them into machine code; however, since there are a finite
number of expressions in any high-level language and there is not a
corrosponding one-to-one mapping between the high-level expressions and
every possible meaningful sequence of machine-language instructions,
the high-level language MUST represent a subset of all meaningful
sequences of machine-language instructions. Simply put, there are things
you can do in assembly that you can't in a high-level language.
   Now then, when we compare two high-level languages, there is one of
two possible conditions. Either the high-level languages have equivalent
sets of expressions which will generate equivalent sets of machine-
language instructions, in which case the languages are essentially
identical, or they don't, in which case they're not. Given two languages
which are NOT identical, then, there are three possible conditions:
the expressions generated in Language A are a complete subset of those
in Language B, the expressions generated by Language A have no points
in common with those of Language B, or the expression sets of A and B
intersect. Given that neither Pascal nor Fortran contains the other
as a subset, but they do have expressions which are the same, the
conclusion is that the machine level instruction sets generated by
Pascal and Fortran are intersecting sets. Therefore, there must exist
a program or program segment which can be implemented in one but not the
other. QED.

This is understandable.  The only real thing they have going for them
is software support.  I've noticed that only about 10% of the commercial
and shareware/PD stuff for the IBM is really good, whereas it seems
about 25% of the stuff for CP/M and TRSDOS is... but that's 25% of maybe
20,000 programs as compared to 10% of 200,000.  Still, if being able
to run the latest version of Brand-Name business programs isn't the
most important thing in your computing life, they lose most of their
appeal.

The Amiga's hi-res mode does go up to around 768 x 440 or something odd
like that (it's the 640x400 mode in overscan), but it still "only" has
4096 colors onscreen at once.  A lot of the digitization programs for
the Amiga advertise themselves as digitizing in 2.5 million colors,
which they do... but the built-in hardware can't display it that way!
They use 24-bit color (instead of the normal 4-bit color the Amiga uses)
so it will match high-end graphics devices used in video production.
Some of Digiview's products will use dithering to get 100,000 "apparent"
colors onscreen in the HAM mode, but it's by alternating colors, the
same way Apple ][ games get 64 colors onscreen instead of 4 or 8.  It's
just a lot less noticeable if you start out with 4096 colors than if
you start out with 8 on a 280x192 screen, or whatever the Apple uses.
    There is a graphics coprocessor card coming out for the Amiga soon
that uses the same processor the Macintosh II does, and gets 259 colors
out of the 16 million color palette onscreen at once.  It's probably
slower than the normal Amiga mode is, but since most professional video
work is done capturing each image to a frame buffer instead of trying
to do real-time displays, it's not a disadvantage.  It is also capable
of doing built-in overlay processing and scrolling/wipe effects, which
the Macintosh II can't.

IBM XT compats can be had for around $400. An interesting thing about
most of the really cheap IBM's is that they come with DR-DOS instead
of MS-DOS (since licenses for DR-DOS are cheaper)...and DR-DOS is by
far the better operating system. It's still got a lot of the stupid
boneheaded MS-DOS misfeatures (like no hash index table in the directory
and that really moronic "everything above 640K is video RAM, right?"
design flaw), but it's smaller and faster than Mush-DOS, doesn't have
all of Mush's weird bugs, and has a few more commands...

I didn't know one was requested until just now!  But besides that, the
press is down still (it got cold, and once it was finally warmed up,
the power company decided a rolling blackout would be a really nifty
thing to do to people who left computers running while staying in Ohio
for a month).  There'll be an administrative session after the MSTF
get-together on the 20th (which I haven't announced yet, so, hey, there'
will be an MSTF get-together on the 20th! -- details later) at which
time some revisions to the current application will be discussed...
perhaps shortening it from its current 14 page mass to something a bit
less unreasonable.  Once they're re-done, a unit will be moved to
Sarasota, so you can get an app from Turtle after that.

Well, that's a sad and tragic thing. You see, he was in the mountains of
Ceylon hunting white leopards, which he usually does on weekends, and he
stumbled across this top-secret communist military base where they're
testing this new ultimate weapon that turns everyone in the world into
clones of Dan Quayle, and so naturally he tried to steal the plans for
it and bring them back to the civilized world so our scientists could
start working on one for OUR side and once again achieve Quayle Parity
and restore the balance of power and stuff, only he forgot about the
eighteen German shepherds and the 500 soldiers with automatic weapons,
and his stolen MiG-23 ran out of fuel, see, and he crashed atop this
illegal drug lab, and... Don't worry, though, he's all better now.

Case in point: Try the Commodore 64 version of Test Drive, and listen to
the awesome audio tracks produced by only three voices.  Then try the 
IBM version of Test Drive, with only one voice, with the sound of a
terribly tuned clarinet.  Quite a difference.  THEN, try the AMIGA 
version of Test Drive, and throw BOTH the other machines away.  And as 
for graphix, well, the IBM doesn't have much better graphix then the
commodore 64,  at least with the Hercules graphix adapter, but the 
Amiga, WOW!  The scrolling of the graphix is totaly without competition
(Except for that awsome game at Sarasota Square Mall, called, oh, I
forgot, but the 3-D data base is AWESOME!)  Anyway, anyone who has
made such comparisons will (unless there brainwashed by the IBM 
communist movement) undoubtedly realize that there is a lot to be said 
on this subject.  As for prices, well, buy an IBM, stock. Then by an
Amiga.  With the IBM, you would have to buy the graphic card, for 
whichever monitor you have, be it CGA, VGA, Amber, or whatever, then 
you would of course need the Sound interface device to be able to even
get marginal music to listen too.  Meanwhile, the Amiga is well on it's
way down the course, playing in full stereo, and the graphics make you
swerve in your seat.  I ask you, which is the more worthwhile machine.
Also, with a bridge the price of a cheap disk drive, you can have 
complete IBM compatibility, whithout the need for all the other cards
for color monitors, audio, etc... What'll it be, boys?

The IBM version of Test Drive comes with two disks.  One for VGA/CGA
mode, and the other for the Herc Graphics Adapter.  The VGA version IS

Hercules graphics adapter.  I mean, who likes to drive a car in a series

Well, actually, Atari at one time developed a cartridge for their 
AT-800XL that was for Cable channel interfacing, and it still does the
job quite well.  The cartridge was called Graphi-Gen, and was designed
for use by cable companies to use as an actual channel on the cable 
network.  The program was nothing more then a screen swap program, with 
a midscreen scroll, that could be asigned display times, and you can
edit the scrolls and each of the swapping screens.  Storer cable was the
first cable company to fall for this little gen-lock cartridge, buying
almost 1200 of these units to use on condo installations, for their 
"in-house" information channels.  Well, about 3 years ago, Storer had
a massive "garage sale" of these computers, selling them from anywhere
between $50.00 to $150.00, including the software.  Well, unfortunately,
I now have to deal with these old 800XLs, and they are really a piece 
of trash.  The cartridge/program is, well, definetly something to be 
desired, and well, I get to play pac-man at least twice a day!  Other
then that, we have found these computers completely un-usable. so...

Also, another trick that the Amiga uses to make it's graphics "look" 
like higher resolution then it really is is by using an analog video 
output.  In this manner, the Amiga can control the actual brightness
of each individual pixel through processing, and with half lit pixels,
the resolution fades along with the light, also affecting the shade of
colors.  This is the way you can get 4096 colors on one screen, by 
controlling the brightness and shading of these pixels through analog
output.

In my quest to absorb all the TV programming I can, I have picked out
two shows and one movie to tell you, the public, about.
1) Around the World in 80 Days-sounds like a book, doesn't it?  Well,
Michael Palin of Monty Python fame, is attempting to follow the path 
made by Phineas Fogg ( or Fineas Phogg, or whatever).  The first 2 of
7 parts have been on, but you can catch the next five one hour parts
on A & E on Sunday at 8 p.m.  It's probaly on at other odd times around
the week.  This is a MUST SEE!
2) The Simpsons-yea, that great American family is on EVERY WEEK!
8:30 p.m. on channel 28 (FOX).  It is opposite Around the World..., but
that's why the VCR was invented.  A MUST SEE.  Oh yea, there will be
about 5-6 Simpson shirts coming out soon.  Be on the look out, and the
first person to spot 'em, please post a message.
3) Killbots-this is a really awful movie.  This thing stinks to high 
hell.  It was on at midnight, so I figured it would at least be funny.
The basic plot is these teenagers get locked in a mall where these
security robots go on a killing spree (seems they got struck by 
lightning).  After two of the eight teens get killed, the rest of 'em
get propane tanks and assault rifles to kill these lazer shootin' 
robots.  This is a really bad movie.  Avoid it at ALL costs.  It isn't
worth the magnetic tape it's on.  YUCK!  DO NOT WATCH!!!!

Dear Bart Fox,
   Shame on you! Thinking about SHORTENING the application for MSTFdom?
A pox on thee and thy house! May the golden unicorn of Paradise swish
his tail in your face! May the seventh son of your seventh son fail
Topology! May... uh, yes... where was I?
   Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it to the MSTF meeting. 
There's ANOTHER Sci-Fi convention going on (a wee bit larger than
MSTF -- but not much!) called VulCon, and my girlfriend surprised me
with a free membership. (I wonder if it's Trek-related?) Should prove

There is a game that /looks/ similar to Hard Drivin' called "'Vette",
although I don't think it's as good as the arcade game is.  'Vette has
better graphics in some ways (lower resolution, but a lot more in the
background) and does a credible job of solid modeling, but Hard Drivin'
is so far the first driving game that is really a "car simulator" in
the same way flight simulators model planes (and I'm talking about
military simulators, not just SubLOGIC's microcomputer ones).  Atari
does make some of the most interesting arcade games around.
   In a fascinating but useless bit of trivia, Atari Home Computers and
Atari Electronics (the makers of the arcade games) are actually two
separate companies, not just different divisions of the same company.
The video games are usually built around odd chips, like the Z8000 or
the 16016, and have nothing in common whatsoever with any computer
being produced by Atari.  This is also why Atari Electronics' games are
made by other companies for microcomputers instead of being produced
by Atari Computers; in fact, Atari Computers has trouble licensing
Atari Electronics games for use with their systems -- most of the games
that are made by Atari in the arcades are ported to the Atari ST by
Mindscape or Electronic Arts, because Atari Electronics doesn't trust
Atari Computers to do good versions....

The old Atari 8-bits were not bad computers; they were half of a good
computer that somehow never got finished. There is a subtle distinction
here. It's not terribly significant to the user if he doesn't know
anything about electronics--whether you have a bad computer or half a
good one, you're not going to like it--but becomes very important when
the person concerned is an electronics wizard who can supply the missing
half...

I'm having some problems with my 'puter and need some tech advice.
First- yes I have an IBM clone (8088) running MSDOS version 3.21.  I
know you'll all say, "Go buy a new computer!" but I can't afford it so..
here's what it is doing:  The only way I can access files on drive C is
to insert my backup DOS diskette in drive A when I boot up...plus every
time I try to access a file I get the following msg: "Seek error Drive
C/ Abort, Retry, Ignore?"  Plus, everytime I try to access any files 
thru Q-Dos it denies their existance.  In addition, I do not have back-
ups of my files due to my recent viral infection (my backups were also
infected and I just havent gotten around to replacing them).  I'd rather
not lose all my files and many of them are copy-protected and I no 
longer have the original software.  Any suggestions?

Sounds like your hard drive itself has a problem...like it's formatted
badly, or the sector ID's (written during a low-level format) no longer
match the sectors they're associated with (rewritten every time you do
a write)...probably the best thing to do is get everything off the HD
and do a low-level format. There is a formatting program floating around
for Mush-DOS which will reformat a hard drivbe without erasing the files
on it, but I don't know where you might be able to find a copy. I also
can't be more helpful without a more specific idea of the problem.

This isn't a pseudo-convention (as Turtle keeps pointing out to me), and
despite Rufus' best efforts, it is *not* called "NoJuanCon" anywhere
except his fevered imagination.
   As long as these people have /some/ idea of what they're geting into,
I wouldn't have any problems with them coming, although I'm not the
host.  It should be pointed out that this is not likely to be your
typical after-school party, so if people are planning to come over for
the main reason of getting drunk and acting like idiots they won't be
all that welcome--and they probably won't enjoy themselves.  If someone
doesn't have even a mild interest in animation, anthropomorphic comics
or sf, he or she won't like the party, and since everyone has to drive
some distance to get to Turtle's, it's not like a con party where the
most you've "wasted" is a three-minute elevator ride.  Someone who would
rather be pulled over a field of broken razor blades than pay money to
see "The Secret of NIMH" would hate it.  Someone who thinks all comics
are for kids--or never looks at comics that aren't Marvel or DC--would
hate it.  Someone who is baffled by the Double-Edge Tavern and Ace of
Spades subs on Courts of Chaos--or still pictures Murr & Turtle as
refugees from old Mickey Mouse cartoons--would hate it.
   Also, be aware there /is/ likely to be alcohol and a lot of stuff
the prudish would consider pornographic.  For a lot of the people you
mentioned, "prudish" = "parents."  These are just a few things to
consider.  Derek Miner would probably enjoy it, but the most interest
I've seen in fantasy/sf from Windrider is the fact that he likes D&D.
Like I said, anyone who wants to come to a furry party should know what
they're getting into; anyone who isn't really interested but just "has
nothing better to do" might be better off staying home vegetating to
MTV.

     I am sorry to yell like that.  But you must admit that a room full
if high school people could scare anyone.  But will see what happends.

Yngling, I don't think you need to use firearms on your HD.  Just get
me 50 yds. of nylon rope.  We tie it around the HD, tie the other end
to a car, and drag it down 301 for a few miles.  That'll teach it a 
lesson!

I don't think it's the room full of high school kids, it's the room
full of high school kids who are weenies.  I'm in high school and I 
don't think I'm a weenie.  I've been called weird, rude, stoopid, 
bizarre, and in need of help, but not a weenie.  Come to think of it,
a room full of your average high school student is terrifying!!
Anyways, I'm tired, and going to bed soon, after I figure where to hang
this poster of a hydrogen bomb at.

You may have a plan there Rufus but I need more details before I can 
give it serious consideration...what gauge of rope?  What type of car?
Exactly how many miles?  Remember: we are dealing with sensitive
equipment here and a single miscalculation could have dire consequences.

You dive? Where? You know, if you have any interest at all in ocean-
ography, marine biology, or marine ecology, I bet Lorelei would
/love/ to talk with you. She's in the Keys right now, doing work for the
Dolphin Research Center in Key West.

>...can we blow up one of the dead VT-52's? Use some magnesium bombs
>or something?
 
Well, except for the fact that (a) I don't have any powdered magnesium;
(b) I don't have any detonators, and (c) a cartridge bomb wouldn't
really be that impressive anyway (they are incindiary, not shattering,
bombs, and don't generate much of a shockwave), well, no. If you
really wanted to blow up a VT-52, a magnesium bomb wouldn't cut it.
You'd need something like a dynamite or plastique device for that...
magnesium cartridge bombs are useful primarily as ignitors for
much larger devices. On the other hand, if you want to use a gasoline
explosion to blow a refrigerator door into low earth orbit, well,
magnesium is JUST the thing you're looking for...

Yes, from the looks of things I'd say you absolutely need to run a low-
level format, and badly. I've heard exactly once of a program that will
do it without losing your files, but in your case I doubt it would work
because the disk has to be readable in the first place to salvage
everything on it. It sounds like you may actually have a media fault
(a physically damaged area on the surface of the disk). The best I
can advise is to copy off all the files you can and just format the
sucker and take your losses, although if you /do/ have a media fault
don't be surprised if you find you can't even format it. (If that is
the case, the hard disk is a loss.)
The most obvious thing that will cause that sort of problem, especially
if it happened all of a sudden, is a head crash. Other than that, I
don't really know where the problem could have come from...

Well, a '77 Nova or a '79 Chevy Van would probaly work.  I don't think
the rope is that important, just as long as it holds.  Here's exactly 
what ya do.  Tie the hard drive up, tie the other end to the car.
get the car up to 50 mph then toss the hard drive out the window, so it
hits the pavement at a high speed.  How long you drive depends on the
size of the HD.  You just use MEGS*.075

  Disney's "Robin Hood" has been on video for a long time. I think it 
was a limited release at first, but if you check some Wal-Marts, there 
is a whole set of re-released Disney tapes at $25. Some titles in-
clude: Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Alice in Wonderland, and most likely 
Robin Hood...
