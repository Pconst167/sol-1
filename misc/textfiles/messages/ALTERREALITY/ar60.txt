  I accept the mug set in front of me greatfully, and as I move to 
put some money on the counter, the individual who served it to me 
walks off.  I take my hand away from my pocket, and pick up the mug.
It is cool, and I take a long drink.  
  When I put it back down, I notice that someone else has joined me at
the bar, and is looking at me quite intently.  I look over to see a 
bunny-morph.  She winks at me, and says, "Buy me a drink?"  I know what
she is, but I am not opposed to lingering.  After all, she looks good 
enough to eat.  Besides, who could resist a come on line like that?
  "What'll you have?"  I reply, with a corresponding show of lingual
dexterity.  
  She perks up, and rolls her eyes up at the ceiling.  "Well," she says,
"howabout...some carrot juice, for a start?"  She looks back at me,
with a small bunny grin on her face.  
  "Sounds good."  I look around for another barmaid.  None are in
evidence.  I look back at her, and she is leaning against the counter,
one elbow up with fist supporting face.  She is dressed in a mu-mu, with
an almost transluscent pink fabric.  Perfect against her snow white 
fur.  And it does cling, in a very nice way.  "That is to say," I say,
"as soon as I can attract a bar maid.  In the mean time," I offer her
some ale. 
  Her nose wrinkles.  "Ah, no thanks.  It doesn't like me."  She turns,
and leans both elbows on the bar.  The move is calculated to reveal her
cleavage, which it does.  Nicely.  And it has been a while.  She calls
to one of the bar maids by name, and orders some carrot juice.

SS> But you don't have to BBS to live.
     
   Have you ever seen a true BBS addict in the last throes of addiction?
The pale, white skin, the fingers permanently curled up, punching at
an imaginary keyboard. If thon is allowed phone priveledges (sp?), thon
immediately calls up the soothing tones of ten different BBS's. 
Occasionally, thon tries to personally hook up with the system, making
the tone of a 300-baud caller and clicking thon's tongue to log into
the system. Dreadful, simply dreadful.
   If not allowed to use the phone, the addict immediately goes into
convulsions, spouting incoherently about Turtles, Armadillos, and Phone
Sex. Thon's eyes tear with the need for an RGB monitor. Then the addict
immediately begins searching for anything remotely resembling a modem
and computer setup. One patient, A. Hektare, was discovered curled up
in a corner with a Walkman playing static, a microwave oven roasting
nothing, and some testing gear that had seven buttons.

   Have you ever danced the Labamba... uh, Libido... uh, Lambada?
I have, with a very attractive girl. Let's just say -- if a few of my
clothes were removed, it would be very easy for her to have gotten
pregnant.

   Not really. The easiest way I have to tell my dreams from reality
is that my dreams always have a soundtrack. And about half the sound-
tracks are my own creation.
     
   (Whatever part of my brain that dreams, also thinks it's a great
composer. I've written out some of those things it's written, and played
them back. Whatever part of my brain that dreams is NOT a music critic.)

        Yes it does matter what you mean, and what I mean.  It would
be nice if you were to show a little bit more conideration for others,
even if you don't like them.  This is STUPID.  It doesn't matter if you
do or don't hang around with gays, or bi.  That is their business, and 
if you can't take into perspective that they are people to, and that 
they have feelings, then there is no hope of even insinuating the pro-
blem to you.  That is only what I believe though, and the same goes to 
those out there who are also blind to the point of biasness.  Everybody
has feelings...  And my NAME 'Death Fennec', has but not a god damned 
thing to do with the way that I make my feelings shown.

I've been to several dog shows, myself.  In fact, my parents once 
planned to raise Dalmatians for dog shows.  We bought one with tens
of champions in his background, one with great promise (so we thought.)
Unfortunately, the Dalmatian had an underslung jaw -- one of the 
very undesirable traits a Dalmatian could have.  (It also turned out 
that he was below average in intelligence -- even for a Dalmatian.)
Our "show dog" wound up being a wonderful watch dog and pet... and never
did enter any shows.

Showing dogs (or horses for that matter) is fun for a while, but like

then my Sheltie for a while. The Golden was VERY good. The Sheltie? 
Well, lets just say, she was fine on the footwork, but when it came time
for the judge to touch her...., she soiled the ring. Then she had the 
nerve to wag her tail and sling Pee all over the judge and me.... 
That was, uh, her last show. And mine.

  I notice that the Tailless wonder has come out of this daze.  He makes
a remark about how he never needs a doctor, and then starts blathering
deliriously about he was on a space station, and that he was supposed to
have had the perfect weapon.  He continues by saying that Florida is not
a chain of islands, as everyone knows....
  I decide that the guy is a lunatic...or seriously mentally hurt. 
Either that, or he was actually on a space station, and put to sleep,
or held in cryogenic suspension, and *just* came out of it, and somehow
got ejected on some sort of a lifepod, just happened to crash on this 
particular island, killing everyone but him in the process....
  Naw, he's a loonie.  I find myself relieved when he gets up and 
wanders off.  I turn my attention back to the bunny.  Someone sits down
behind me, but says nothing, so I don't know if it's him again or not.
The bunny has got her drink, and I feast on her good looks while she
drinks it.
  She doesn't seem to mind my lewd gaze...quite actually encourages it.
"So how about it?" she asks.  I open my mouth to reply, but I am
interrupted by the same morph, this time standing right next to me.  I
decide that the guy is definitely short a few marbles, but I can't get 
a word in edgewise to shut him up.  I give the bunny-morph a "can-you-
hold-on-a-minute-while-I-get-rid-of-this-guy" look, and turn to face
the morph.
  "Look, fella, I don't want to seem too rude, but you really do look
like you could use some professional help with that, er, injury.  
Losing your tail is not like breaking a claw, you know."  I look around
for some managerial help in losing this dude.

Hey Dave - Scott was saying how you boosted your system to 8Mhz.  I
have a deal for ya.  I'm busy but I have a XT clone that needs a 
tuneup (crashes sometimes and floppy A sometimes doesn't work right).
It has a 12 Mhz motherboard in it.  You tune it up - you can swap 
motherboards.  For what I wanna use it for 8 Mhz would be fine.

It starts out as a chore and gets worse. My father used to raise

I liked the idea in a recent "The Nerve" of going into the airport
in camo pants and clutching a book bag close to your body.  I wandered
in there during the war with my Model 100.  I was expecting a few guards
to wander up.  No one did
 
One neat thing we did at the airport when they were doing massive 
work on the concourse is go out to the middle and get on those
little hallways that lead to the planes.  We had the largest urge to 
fiddle with the controls and make it move around.

Anyone (especially a child) who is forced to do something isn't going to
enjoy it. I started showing Horses when I was about 14, it was something
I really WANTED to do so I loved it. But then comes all the politics, 
they run the Quarter Horse shows in a a circuit so you accumulate 
points. It's the same people placing all the time..... so even after you
become well known and start placing, it's kind of an empty victory. 
  
Same goes for Dog shows after a while. 
  
I've seen kids whose parents literally *forced* them to participate 
in dog/horse/ect shows. I don't think I'd ever do that to my kids. 
Especially now that I see what it has done to your mind. Hehehe.

Respiration, sure. Consuming energy, no. Metabolism /produces/ energy,
which the living organism then consumes to do other stuff. You don't
live to metabolize, you metabolize in order to get the energy to
live. Kind of like the way a yo-yo works.

I look around at the little morph's demand. Is /he/ addressing me?
Yeah, seems like it. I am starting to wonder if I'm wearing a blinking
sign reading "Bartender," or why nobody can see the bartender. I walk
over to him, frowning. "I'm not the bartender, but you're right about
the doctor." I rummage under the bar for the little medicomp that's
normally kept there. "Ah, here we go. Next best thing to a real doctor."
I sling the thing over my shoulder and walk around to the patrons' side
of the bar. "Army issue," I explain to the little morph. I pull the
scanner out of its tether and run it over his behind. "Just business,
don't get any ideas," I say as I put the scanner back. "Well, no sign
of infection. Nice clean wound, like it was done with a laser or a
scalpel or...hello, it's been stitched, too. Looks like the stitches
were removed too soon, and it's starting to open up again. Who did this
to you?" I pull an autoinjector out of the medicomp's side cabinet,
and ram it against his behind. The Army autoinjectors hurt like a
sonofabitch--old-fashioned spring-loaded needle instead of pressure
spray--but what the hell, they work. "Anasthetic and a broad-spectrum
antibiotic. I can stitch it if you like, but not here. It looks like
a bandage ought to do it."

   "Aaahh, I'm bushed," she says to herself as she drags her little 
lifeboat on shore.  Checking a map she guesses that she's somewhere near
Florida, or at least, what used to be Florida. 
  
  Kyara thinks back to the journey that brought her to this island. 
I'll be traveling for what seems like years.  After our ship got 
atttacked I managed to escape with three others in a lifeboat.  God, I 
hated to see them die one by one.  I guess it's because of my training 
that I've lasted this long.  I just hope I can find some civilization. 
I've been rowing this damned boat for days now.  Fortunately, I've still
got some food left from the hunting that I did at that last islnad.  
God, those savages where disgusting.  I just barely escaped with my 
life.  (she breathes a sign of relief)  I've been traveling and 
traveling looking for civilized people and all I've run into is 
cannibals and savages or even worse dense tropical jungles with no 
real means by which I could support myself safely and effectively.  
I just hope I can find something here.  
  
  She makes camp and quickly cooks her last meal.  "God, I'm sick of 
this damn snake meat.  And if I have to eat one more fish, I going to 
throw up."   She starts to pack her things into her backpack:  knife, 
clothes (one outfit left, besides her ninja clothes), canteen, matches, 
and other assorted items.   After her food gets done cooking she eats it
hungrily but begrudgingly.  "This is really getting old," she complains
to herself.   
  
   After lunch, she starts her daily mediation. 
  
   When she is finished she drags to boat into a little group of trees 
and camouflages it and best she can.  She grabs up her pack and her 
katana and heads west.  (She landed on the east side of island.)  
  
   After about an hour or two she finds a gray path.  "Finally, a real
path, that looks like it's been travele by humans and morphs.

in here."  He begins to search the pack,  he pulls out the knife and 
sifts through it again.  Finding nothing of consequence, he hands it 
back to her.
  She asks, "Where can I find a place to get cleaned up and some food 
to eat?"   The morph replies with a tone that says do-you-know-how-many-
times-I've-heard-that-question?, "Yeah, just ask at the bar."
  She enters and finds herself in a foyer with two doors.  She takes the
opposite the private area.  She opens the curtains and looks around the 
bar.  She thinks to herself, I've got to get cleaned up.  She sees the 
bartender and walks toward him.  Once there, she asks, "Can I get a 
room or something, I want to get cleaned up."  The man replies, 
"Certainly, right this way."  He leads her to one of rooms (not in the 
private section) where a shower has been installed.  He leaves her with 
instructions to return to the bar when she's though.   She quickly 
disrobes and washes herself.  She enjoys the feeling of warm water 
washing over her.  She towels off, and puts on her last outfit, puts on 
her makeup and brushes her jet black hair. 
  She heads back into the bar and goes back to see the bartender.  
"Thanks." she says with a tone of relief.  He replies, "Would you like 
me to set up a tab for you?"  Without hesitation, she says, "Yes."
The man continues, "Would you like something to eat or drink?"
"Definitely," she says, pulling out a small wade of money t show him 
that she can afford the tab he generously offered her.

  She says, "I'll take a large glass of milk and some steak and eggs, 
over-easy."  The bartender turns away to give the order to the kitchen. 
When he returns he notices that she's looking around the bar. And 
decides that he'll just have her food brought out to her when it's done.
  Kyara scans the bar, looking at the various different people here.  
And abruptly stops when she sees a man sitting behind a chess board, and
notices that he's rather attractive.
  She decides that she's ask him if he'd like to play, considering 
herself to be a rather good player in her own right. 
  If anyone is looking at Kyara, she is about 4'10" and very thin. 
She's got straight jet black hair that would remind you of a China Doll.
Her breasts are above average in size, in comparison to most orientals 
who normally have small breasts.  She has light gray eyes and a 
dazzling smile.  She has the normal slant to her eyes that most 
oriental people have.  
  She sits down next to the man in the white suit and introduces
herself.  "Hello, my name is Kyara.  Do you mind if I join you?"

This conference has now been pressed into service as a forum for dis-
cussing what's going on in the Den of Decadence, and for working out
problems in the storyboard. First of all, it was just brought to my
attention that a lengthy post introducing Shandra and Robert was futzed
shortly after I posted them, which is why there seems to be some
confusion about the roles of these two people. The problem has been
fixed (took two hours, too...ah, the life of a sysop). Therefore, I
ask that all storyboard members please re-read Message #14483 and
Message #14484.
 
Second, a nte on the geometry of the Den. The building itself
is divided into two parts: the bar and other miscellaneous rooms
comprising the part open to the public, and the larger 'private'
area where the staff lives and the brothel operates. These two sections
are side-by-side. Entry is by means of a spacious foyer, with doors
leading into the public and private areas. Also, there is a curtained-
off door in the wall between them; when you are in the bar, you can pass
into the private area through the curtain that's behind the actual
bar itself. That way, it is not necesary to pass through the foyer to
go from one part to the other. (Technical note: If you can't see
Conference 12, you don't have access to the private area.)
 
It would seem that entrance to the Den is controlled by some rather
large bear-types who serve almost as guards. Since nobody seems to be
running these characters, I would suggest that either Saavik or myself
do so. Saavik?
 
The bartender is male; his name is (I believe) Jervis or Jarvis. This
character is controlled by Saavik.
 
Thank you for your support. (hic!)

     Robert indicates the seat in front of him with a sweep of his hand.
"Kyara. You are a very lovely woman. Most graceful." Robert leans back
in his chair again and surveys the woman critically. After a moment,
he returns his attention to the chessboard and advances the white
king's pawn two squares. This done, he folds his hands under hish chin
and gazes levelly at Kyara. "Robert," he offers. "I like your form.
Who's your sensei, then?" A barmaid arrives with Kyara's breakfast
and places it next to the chessboard. "Put this on my tab, please"
Robert says to her as she departs. "Can't abide milk myself," he
remarks in an offhand way to his companion. "Bloody awful stuff."

  "I happen to love milk," picking up the glass and nearly quaffing to 
whole thing, "it's good for you.  You really should develop a taste for
it," she advices.  Kyara continues quickly, hoping that she didn't 
accidently step on his toes, so to speak, "Thank you for breakfast, it's
been a bad day."
   
  "So, I take it you fancy yourself to be a good chess player?  I 
learned how to play back home in Japan?  Where are you originally from?"
  
   She moves her queen's knight's pawn up one space.  Damn, he just 
moved his King's pawn one more space as if he didn't even consider the 
move.  This guy may be better than I anticipated, Kyara thinks to 
herself.  This man is very attractive and incredibly clever, I'd better 
be on my guard.  Hmmmm....aaahhh....King's bishop's pawn up one, that 
should slow him down...Uh-ih, he just advanced his queen's pawn two 
spaces.  Now I can't take his pawn.  .....she thinks again.....okay...
I'll just move out my king's knight's pawn two spaces.  True, that 
leaves me vulnerable, he could take that pawn, but he'd be sacrificing 
his bishop.  I don't think he's that stupid.  I wonder what he'll do 
next. 
   
"So, you think I studied martial arts?  Is that just an assumption based
on the fact that I am obviously oriental?"  She continues, "Have you 
studied the martial arts?  I've always been fascinated by them.  My 
father, God rest his soul, used to take me and my brothers and sisters 
to the matches in Tokyo.  It was so exciting, you wouldn't believe how
fast some of those guys can move."

Robert gazes at Kyara without moving a muscle as she speaks, then
advances his queen to the right-hand edge of the board. "Check,"
he says in an offhand voice, "and mate, Mate. Tsk. Terribly sorry
'bout that. You studied in Japan, you say? I was there briefly,
in Ryo, during that little spot of trouble after your Racial
Purity Act." He signals to one of the barmaids and indicates his
desire for a martini. "You seem a little off-balance," he says to
Kyara when it arrives. "One of the many uses of martial training:
focusses the mind wonderfully. Helps you keep your equilibrium, you

   Kyara's head shakes as if you had just been splashed in the face with
ice water when she sees Robert's quick-kill maneuver.  Still in shock, 
she says, "I can't believe you just did that!  I never saw it coming!"
   Robert's martini arrives and he asks her for another game.  She 
adamantly replies, "You'd better believe I want another game."

    The tailless morph doesn't seem to react to the shot in the ass.
Strange; most people tend to take notice of that sort of thing. His
eyes are glazed, pupils dialated; he seems unsteady on his feet. Hmm.
I put the autoinjector away and look more closely at the little morph.
Yes, sure enough, there is a knot on his head, partially concealed by
what's left of his fur.
 
   Crossing the bar, I walk over to Tampa's table. "I hate to disturb
you, Ma'am," I say, "but our friend over there appears to have a
concussion. I don't think he's even aware of where he is or when he
is. We don't have the facilities to treat him; I'm wondering if it might
not be a good idea to warm up the hover and take him to the hospital.
He's in pretty bad shape. There's something about his condition that's
kind of familiar, too, like maybe he was attacked by one of those
right-wing anti-morph religious groups. They sometimes took souvineers
from their targets. Possibly the Sword and Arm of God loonies; I don't
know. I haven't heard of that kind of activity in the Chains before;
I'd like to check some things out if I may."

   Sounds like a fascinating teacher. (They didn't have too many of 
those in my extremely conservative Christian school.) 
   That brings me to an interesting question: what do y'all feel should
be the place of religion in the schools? Do you feel that no religious
matter should ever be discussed in public schools, even to the point of
not telling certain episodes of history? (In other words, if some war
were over religion, should we say that?) Should we mention religion only
when it's absolutely necessary -- to explain historical matters, for 
example -- but not, say, include any pieces involving religion in a
literature class? (That is to say, every period of history had at least
some good works which had nothing to do with religion -- even during the
Middle Ages.) Should they embrace all "major" religions equally, having
special speakers from each "major" religious body lecture to the
students? (And how do you define "major"? If there's ten students in a
body of a thousand that believe in the Cult of the Armadillo, is that a
"major" religion?  How about if just one student believed in it?)
   I'm not talking about whether a Bible study (or a B. Gita study, or
a study of any religious text...) should or shouldn't be allowed to meet
on high school grounds. I'm asking what the teachers should be allowed
to teach in the classrooms.
     
   My own viewpoint is that high schools (and, to a lesser degree, 
junior high schools) must teach classes on the religions and philo-
sophies of the world. Although there's no hope of ever teaching every
religion of the world, it's fairly easy to group the largest religions,
explain the basic beliefs to all of them, and then define the
differences. Same with the philosophies of the world. 
   How do I define 'major' religion? I just chicken out, and say that

any religion is 'major' if one percent of the student body believes in
it.  Any 'major' religion should be taught -- and any 'non-major' 
religion that has sufficient interest.
   Without an understanding of religions in the world, we can't under-
stand much of history, literature, or even music. Human nature demands
that there is a reality outside of this one, and searches for any 
indication that there might be one.  To ignore that is to ignore a hugh

Tampa looks over Shandra's shoulder at the swaying Morph and nods 
slowly. "I noticed him earlier. He does seem to be in trouble." She 
slips off of the bar stool and crosses over to the foyer where 
Korelyan is just walking back through from the Brothel. "I believe we 
need to transport that poor Morph out there to a hospital, Love." 
 
Korelyan squeezes her shoulder and brushes past walking to where 
Shandra is practically holding the weaving Morph up. "Ok." He gently 
supports the Morph under one arm and leads him toward the door. "Don't 
you worry, Sport, there's a hospital only a hop away." He cranes his 
neck and catches Shandra's eyes. "I'll be back shortly, why don't you 
see what you can find out about this fellow. Someone must know something
about him." 
 
Tampa waits until Korelyan is out of the room before she walks over to 
Shandra. "Do you really think someone did that to him from one of the 
Anti-Morph groups?" She shuddered as Shandra shrugged in responce. 
"Scares me to death to think that we may have that kind of activity 
around here." She sighs deeply. "I thought that we were safe here. Go 
ahead and see what you can find out. If you need any help, let me know.
She held Shandra in a long even gaze. "Shandra, if there is Anti-Morph
foolishness going on around here, you mustn't put yourself in jeopardy.
Let Korelyan handle it."  A shiver of fear passs over her face as she 
remembers the horror stories told by her parents.

SCA: The Society for Creative Anachronisms. (And NOT, as some people
     have said, the Society for Creative Anarchy.)
   
   The SCA is a society that re-creates the Middle Ages and the 
Rennaisance "as they should have been."  No, we don't believe in the
Black Plague, and yes, we do believe in modern medicine. (To answer the
two most common questions.)
   Most medieval fairs in the country (that have been started in the
past fifteen years) were started by the SCA. (And many of them were 
later taken over by others.) We put on our own "events" -- usually not
as showy as medieval fairs -- in various places around the country. Our
main interests tend to be in swordplay, or in the arts and sciences of
the Middle Ages. 
   Each member of the Society creates a 'persona' of someone who could
have lived in the Middle Ages or Rennaisance. Sometimes these 'personas'
are extremely well-thought out, other times (like mine) they're not much
more than a name and a rough sketch. 
   There is royalty in the Society (determined by swordplay: the best
swordsman or -woman is King or Queen for six months), nobility 
(determined by service to the Society), and various titles for various
positions in the Society. 
   
   Is it a cult? Well, we do dress up in really strange costumes and
prance around fires. And we do have the philosophy of medieval chivalry.
But, it's basically just a lot of fun.

T> Money, power, prestige. There is a /lot/ of money in show dogs. 
T> Your point, please?
     
   Granted. Showing dogs can be a profitable hobby. But not very
profitable.
   Let's face it. Most dog shows do not give out a lot of money. As I
recall, in a big dog show, the grand prize might be $100. The biggest
money would come from selling puppies from a grand champion.
   It takes at least five years for a dog to become a grand champion.
And you can't let her get pregnant during that time. Let's say you're
lucky, and the dog has litters every year for the next four years.
Let's say you're extremely lucky, and none of the pups have any birth
defects. (In some breeds, like Dalmatians, this is extremely rare.)
Let's say each litter has four pups, which each sell for $500. Let's
see -- for ten years' work, you get $8,000 -- plus whatever slight
money you made from showing the dog. Let's say, $10,000 total over ten
years. That's about $1,000 a year, minus the cost of keeping up the dog
and time lost grooming the dog and taking her to shows. (If the dog
is male, of course, much less money would come in.) I doubt most people
showing dogs are really just doing it for the money.

An organization of people dedicated to re-creating the good ol'
days of chivalry, knights in shining armor, and royalty without the
squalor, ignorance, disease, etc. Essentially, it's a large organization
of people who create ficticious personae and then live them, acting out
the part of a squire or knight or what-have-you at get-togethers and
rennaisance festivals and whatnot. It would be an interesting
sort of activity were it not for the fact that it tends to attract
people who have no real personalities of their own; these people
then /become/ their ficticious counterparts, and lose the ability
to relate to other human beings in any other way. It gets tedious
very fast.

I got news for you--my father was a professional breeder for about four
years in Nebraska, and you would be AMAZED how much money there is in
it. I defy you to show me a championship-level dog show where the top
prize is only a hundred bucks, and I defy you to buy me an AKC
registered puppy of any breed from a proven championship line for five
hundred. You are off by an order of magnitude in both cases. You are
also forgetting how much you can charge in stud fees from a champion
male. In my experience, I can state with assurance that (a) there is
a bushel of money to be made in raising and showing dogs and (b) most
of the people I have met who are in that business are doing it for the
money, not because they love running around in little circles with
four-legged animals in some Godforsaken place under hundred-and-ten-
degree heat.

Dogs suck.  They are loud, smelly, overbearing, and they eat too much.
Cats are far superior pets to dogs.  (Not that I said 'pets'.  As

thier esthetic value, they aren't worth a whole lot for anything.  But
they still beat dogs all hollow.)

   True. It also tends to attract the power-hungry (remember: we're

interested only in fighting.
   
   But, I've found enough interesting people in the Society that it

and says, "As far as playing for ..er,..sexual favors is conerned, 
that's the idea, but how do you suggst making this wager more

  She continues to eat her steak while waiting for Robert to make his

Robert moving /his/ queen's knight to queen's bishop's three.  She 
boldy advances her king's bishop to queen's bishop five and finishes 
off her breakfast.  Kyara waves over the barmaid to take her plate. 
Robert then moves his king's bishop to queen's bishop's five also.
Kyara starts to wonder how lond he's going to continue to match her 
move for move.  As it stands now, both sides are a mirror image of the 
other.  She decides to move her queen's pawn forward one and says, 
"Well, your idea to spicen it up a little?", she smiles provocatively

been washed lately, though it does have the odor of Seawater.  His face
is extremely human-like, just a little hairy, it is apparent that he was
well-shaven but now there appears to be a month or so's worth of wiskers
on his face (so my hair grows slow, oh well.)  And that's it for now. -]

The fifth Star Trek film was "different". But I liked it, I don't care 
what the critics say. Shatner (as a director) is no Nimoy but I didn't 
think he did such a bad job. But then again, I love ST so much, I would
have liked it even if it had been a complete bomb.  I think maybe the 
"critics" expected more, and were disappointed.

DF>(on bringing the chain leads) You might scare Turtle off from EVER 
   having another con in his house..... 
  
I dunno about that. It might bring back his "fond" (heheh) memories of 
showing dogs.

SCA sounds like a lot of fun. A good way to escape the doldrum and 
slip into "fantasy mode".  I used to act in plays and musicals when I 
was a teen......, it was a lot for the same reasons..., to escape 
reality for a little while.

Some people do make a living off of dog shows. They use them as a tool 
to advertise their Kennels. They rake in stud fees and puppy sales. 
And if you really get into the "big time", Westminster, for instance, 
then you can see some real bucks. All in all, though, I think most 
people do it because they like it and it keeps them busy..... plus, 
if they own a kennel, they can write off mucho expenses on taxes. 
Did you read about the woman, a few years back, who had her dogs 
impounded in Sarasota at a dog show? She had something like 72 poodles 
in her van. Geesh!!!!

The hard part is convincing them to put it on.

The SCA reminds me of some "mime and acting" groups I've known. They 
do the same thing. They are so busy "acting" all the time, they can't 
be themselves...... they are Never serious.., it's like talking 
to Ronald McDonald.

Yep, Dogs are loud, smelly, overbearing and they DO eat too much. But 
they are also ( for the most part) loyal, loving, tolerant, and 
protective. My Doberman (her name is Saavik) is only 7 months old. 
She's a big lug, she drinks water and slings it all over you, she wakes
me up in the middle of the night by jumping on the bed and laying 
across me, she steals socks and takes them outside, she drags sand in 
the house...... but she truly adores my family and she'd fight anyone 
who tried to harm them to the death. No One will ever enter my yard 
with intent to harm my family or property as long as she is patroling.

I'm never anal-repulsive. Well, except maybe when I'm doing page layout,
but Rufus at least appreciates that...ask him about working on his
traditionalist underground magazine. ("Hey, you're not really using a
magnifying glass on the monitor...")
 
When did I keep Tyler & co. up because it was too noisy to sleep? I thin
you're hallucinating again... (snicker)
