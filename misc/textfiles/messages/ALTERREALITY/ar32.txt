Aristotle is not the answer. People can borrow all the time, few
can create. Do you rreally think you can walk through my tree? If
you believe, both are there. An orange tree in the room doesn't
have to be in the mind. It can be by the door. Aquinas was a Christian.
His tree was in Heaven. Others may not be. They need not collide
either. I can walk through his heaven. What I see may be different.
Nor does an orange have to be an orange. Perhaps Aqunias knew that.

How about when we weren't so enlightened about black people? I can
only hope that eventually we'll be as enlightened about homosexuals.
Regardless of any arguments about morality being in the public
perception or whatever, I still believe that bigotry is immoral
regardless of the group it's turned against--black, homosexual,
whatever.

That explains your reasons for finding the behavior itself unappealing,
I suppose. What it /doesn't/ explain is your condemnation of gays, your
refusal to associate with "those people" in any way, your...well, for
lack of a better word, bigotry. Read my lips: I'm not at all attracted
to the practice. The thought of sleeping with another man turns my
stomach. That has nothing to do with the PEOPLE who engage in that
practice. Yes, I think the eggplant metaphor is perfectly apt: the
thought of putting an eggplant in my mouth makes me ill, but why on
earth would any rational person refuse to associate with people who
like eggplant? You don't have to have a fascination for sleeping with
other men to treat gays like humans and not walking stereotypes. For
some reason which is beyond me but which doesn't seem to relate to
your view of homosexuality as a "sickness," you seem to behave as if
/all/ homosexuals are stereotypes, they all have the same character-
istics, etc, etc.

I will take a quote that Mike Hickmon gave to me one day while we were
speaking of the subject... 
 
"Every male has a homosexual thought atleast /once/ in his life....
whether he acts apon (upon?) it is his own choice."
 
I think that statement says it all ... Most of us choose not to act apon
it, and some of us do .... I know people who have carried on a homosexua
relationship exactly once in their life for an extended period of time,
and when that ended, they never did anything homosexual again, and are
completely heterosexual now ... At any rate, it is /definately/ NOT a
sickness ... Just a choice that is made ... It is mostly a moral value..

I forget now what exactly prompted the remark except that it indeed 
appeared that your temper was somewhat "short".  Perhaps a better word
would have been not nasty but rather "irritated".  Of course you are
entitled to express an opinion without being castigated or referred to
in less than complementary terms.  Please forgive me for tromping on
still-tender feelings.
Also I'm sorry that I have com across in such a vague manner. Sometimes
in the "heat" of the post I get redundant and thus unclear.  I am holdin
a book titled "What the Cults Believe" which is aguide to these groups.
It gives the Websters definition and notes that sect is a synonym for
cult.  It is rather loosely organized around the principle that the
group to be considered a cult have beliefs outside the established norm
for mainstream religious organizations.  Yes there ARE sects that are
considered mainstream and in fact have issued many joint proclomations
as articles of faith binding them in the greater concept of the ministry
of Christ.  I read somewhere that the various groups (Baptists, Episcopl
Presbyterian etc etc) in fact agree on the "most important" 85% of 
dogma - I would presume - but not guarantee - that this is stuff like
observance of the Lord's Supper, He died for our sins on the cross, He
was the Son of God, He was God Incarnate (trilogy) etc etc.
If your church recognizes some of these cults then I would defer to 
their and your priveledge to do so and would only hope that the 
superficial nod to the Bible would not varnish over major flaws in 
theology.  Mormons as a case in point tromp all over themselves in
contradictions within the Book of Mormon.  As a matter of fact a couple
of ex-mormons that run an organization that ministers to mormons have
counted over 3,600 alterations, changes and omissions in this
"divinely inspired and translated work" since its' first printing.  The
theology that they preach is superficially Christian and it is only 
under closser scrutiny that they are exposed.

When I lived in Germany I started working in the cafeteria at Rhein 
Maine airbase at the tender age of 14.  I made $150 every two weeks
and had a really nice stereo in a couple of months.  For the next
2 years every two weeks I would go to a place called BuchSchalg where
there was a complete music store (nothing but LP's as cassettes were
not reliable)  I spend no less than $60 on LP's at $2 each!  You figure
how many albumns I used to have.  We were overweight when we left so I
had to pay for about 350 lbs extra for my LP's - I had easy close to
1000.  I got careless in my later teenage years and loaned without
remembering - got toasted at parties and forgot now I have very few of
these albumns to remind me *snif*....  My own damned fault.  When I 
finally woke up - I started listening to the LP's once to make sure they
were OK and then taping them and listening to the tape.  I still have
most of them except the ones my ex got brain dead over...
I just picked up Bowie - "Changes" it's pretty good.  I gotta start 
replentisghing my Floyd with CD's now that they're out.  I wish there
was a way to capture one of their concerts.  I saw a show in Germany 
where they performed in a castle and dumped 40 tons of dry ice into the
moat - WOW!  They are pretty lucky over there as they play old taped 
concerts all the time on TV.

> If your church recognizes some of these cults then I would defer...
  
It's not a matter of "recognition".  There's no "approved" list
of proper and acceptable religions circulating among the Episcopal
hierarchy.  Part of the "Articles of Faith" recognizes and accepts
diversity in beliefs and forms of worship.  You made the assumption
that since I said we don't view them as cults, that we give the
Goodhousekeeping stamp of approval.  The truth (of our belief) lies
in the middle ... we simply view other faiths as different from our
own.  As my rector once summed it up, "Fine, they'll get to heaven
their way and I'll get to heaven mine."
    We've been bandying theologies around quite a bit, but I've missed
you mentioning what church you belong to.  (I came into this string
late and might have missed it.)  You've got me curious, which
denomination do you adhere to?

  No?  The the people who wander the streets of New York who talk to 
themselves are actually fine, upstanding SANE people?  And by your
premise, all the people who are in Arcadia should be released...why,
they're HEALTHY individuals!  
  I think that I have discovered why you think the way you do. With a
base like that to go on, you could explain ANYTHING abnormal or 
sick as just an "odd behavior".  
  If your attitude is typical, I should not have bothered to bring
this subject up.  With that attitude, you could dismiss anything I
say, so I will no longer discuss it with you...

Go back and re-read...then ask me again. But read the thread. I can
only repeat what I said to make my point.
  I agree.  Bigotry is immoral.  I never claimed to be perfectly moral.
You cannot blame a black man for being black, any more than you can 
blame a white for being white.  You can blame a white for stealing,
or any other crime. That would not be bigotry.  
  You cannot blame a man for being homosexual...unless he chose to
be.  Most of the time, they are stuck with it somehow.  It isn't a 
crime, true, to be homosexual.  (Unless you're me, of course.)  It
is, however, in direct contradiction to the way things were meant to
operate, and therefore, abnormal. 
  Ok, I'll admit it.  I don't like gays.  Why they do what they
do is irrelavant to me, the fact that they do it is what really 
bothers me.  They do it, it bothers me...OPINION.  
They do it and can't help thier "predisposition"...FACT.  
They do it in direct contradiction to what is natural...ABNORMAL. (FACT)

Do you also make the same claim about oral sex; that is, since nature
obviously didn't intend for the organs involved to be involved in that
sort of activity, then the people who do it must be sick? If you /do/,
then it's quite curious to me that you aren't as busy vigorusly
condemning people who engage in oral sex as "sick," "deviant,"
and "not normal." On the other hand, if you /don't/ believe oral sex
is sick, then I'd suspect your condemnation of homosexuality on the
grounds of nature is more of a rationalization than a reason for your
beliefs.

A minor semantic quibble here, rather than a conceptual one (aren't you
lucky?) The definition for sodomy is pretty narrow; you can't really
equate acts which fall outside that definition to sodomy. Also, I don't
think you phrased that the way you intended; from the sound of things,
it would seem that you'd equate sex with contraceptives to sodomy, and
I don't think that's the claim you're making.

Another semantic quibble: Beatle's statement that not all abnormal
behavior can be considered sick does not imply that /no/ abnormal
behavior can be considered sick. It simply means that the fact that the
behavior is uncommon is, by itself, insufficient to prove that an
illness exists. Hey, staying up 'til one AM BBSing isn't normal
behavior, but it also isn't sign of sickness...

Not true. I certainly wouldn't care to make it part of my diet, but it

Of the people I know who are gay, which may or may not be a represen-
tative sample, I would say they do /not/ meet the "swishy" or
"mean bitch" stereotypes much more often than they do. However, most
of the people I've met who are gay are college students from generally
white middle-class families, so, as I said, they may or may not be
representational of the so-called "gay community" as a whole. This is
exactly my point, though; gays are /people,/ and this naturally means
that they come in all shapes, sizes, attitudes, outlooks, beliefs,
etc, etc. Therefore, judging anybody on the basis of a stereotype
is at best risky and at worst does them--and you--a grave injustice.

I generally consider myself openminded. I am perfectly willing to
accept the fact that people have opinions, views, and behavior which
I don't agree with. That does not mean I have no objections to people
who abuse other people, people who abuse animals, or people who
interfere with the well-being of others or myself. If being open-
minded and tolerant of others is a vice, well, I'm sorry, but there
it is. Then again, if I were /not/ tolerant of other people's views, I
almost certainly would have stopped speaking to you or associating with
you by now.

  I don't see how  you can equate a "sickness" with something that 
doesn't happen with the majority. According to you, since homosexual sex
doesn't remotely follow the order of "nature" (which, I am assuming, is 
a man and woman producing offspring) doesn't mean it's a "sickness".
 
 Let's look at it a few ways. Let's say it's not a sickness. What's the 
problem? I know you don't agree, but...
 
  Now, (listen up) let's say it IS a sickness. What other things in the 
world are sicknesses. Oh, mental illness, alcoholism, and things along t
those lines. Those things don't make people less a part of society, and 
it doesn't call for discrimination.. 
 
  Now that I've assumed your argument, where does the issue stand?

 WHY?! Back that up. I'd really like to know why. I seem to think the 
most logical idea I've heard is the one posted by Ken Ober, quoted by 
Mike Hickmon.How you look at homosexuality and sexual preference at the 
time you get an urge determines whether or not you take on that 
preference. Let me (again) compare homosexuality with other sicknesses 
that affect social interaction. If someone has a mental illness, they 
are somewhat impared for the rest of their life, but treatment helps. 
Alcoholics are alcoholics for the rest of their life. How they drink 
determines the symptoms. Yet, it has been shown that homosexuality has 
been discarded in favor of heterosexuality in the past... without and
<any treatment. How do you explain this?

>Who is to deictate or define "normal"??
  
You don't know???? Why you, me, them, us, I, we, they, and anyone. Are
you now stating that everyone plays by the same rules??? Should everyone
have the same definition of "normal"??? I have MY opinions, views and
beleifs....I gage them by MY rules and definitions. "Socially 
acceptable" is bullshit!!! And "Homophopbic" is a term that has been
recently used to allow homosexuals to LABEL all those who don't agree
or accept them as being SICK while standing back and saying "I'm not 
sick, it's just a SEXUAL PREFERENCE. But YOU'RE homophobic, that makes
you SICK". I have yet to label homosexuals as "sick", but using 
homophobic, you're now labelling "straight" people as being "sick".

At least you referred to monogamy as 'normal'. As far as the 'general 
norm' goes, I hope the populus doesn't decide that eating children's
genitals for breakfast is okie-dokie....I'd disagree with that, too.

I have yet to make a claim that 'homosexuals' are perverse or sick.
If I have implied such, it was by mistake. I have been mearly trying
to state that if homosexuality is a sexual preference and ONLY that,
well so is all the other things. What makes (as YOU stated) shoving
a mouse in a body cavity a sickness and NOT a sexual preference? Let's
leave out the fact that it involves taking advantage of a mouse, lab's
and high schools all over the country do that daily and you're not
screaming that THEY'RE ALL SICK. Put the actions only to the extent
that someone REALLY wants to do it and they haven't (therefore they
haven't taken advantage of anyone or hurt anyone), are they sick still??
  
I'm loosing your fine line between sickness and preference, at least
with the example of the white mice. Please explain why that is sick and
a high school kid hacking up a frog in lab (and I mean HACKING up)
is not.......

I never meant to imply that it was limited to homosexuals, only that
there may be a fairly thin line (for most people) between what is
perverse (sick...whatever) and what is (in their mind) 'normal'. You
can't say that homosexuality is a preference and incest is a sickness
without questioning why? It all boils down to YOUR own personal
values and your definition of <ugh> 'normal'. I am not meaning to
condem (singly) homosexuals, but mainly the arguement on what determines
a 'normal' <ugh again> sexual relationship and why is it normal?

his private parts hung out of his beaver tail and when he hit the water

Neither one. If it's really a legitimate friendship, then either you
have loyalty to your friends or you don't; if it's the former, you
wouldn't even be asking the question, I think, and if it's the latter
then it doesn't really matter, now, does it?

>Do YOU feel that child sexual abuse, incest, bestiality, sexual
>S&M or any of these things are 'sicknesses'...
 
Violent, antisocial behavior is violent, antisocial behavior regardless
of its sexual content. Child sexual abuse is a sickness in exactly
the same way that child abuse is a sickness; it's a pathological
violent condition. Whether or not you'd call any form of child abuse
a sickness depends on how you look at it, I guess--most child molestors
say they can't help themselves, ditto with child abusers--but there is
no intrinsic difference between sexual and non-sexual forms of
child abuse. Same thing for animal abuse, be it sexual or non-sexual.
Rape is an act of violence; so is murder. You don't often hear people
wandering around saying murderers are "sick;" the mindset during an act
of rape is essentially the same.
 
You tell me. Would you say that a person who sexually abuses children
is sick while a person who simply beats them is healthy? Is it just
the sexual aspect that causes you to call it "sick?" A peculiar defi-
nition of sickness, if that's the case.

I was raised Southern Baptist - since we travelled a lot when I was 
young and because my parents wisely desired me to comt to my own 
conclusions about the world, I attended many different services to see
if any of them struck a resonant chord.  The chord was struck in a 
very small town in North Dakota - a black guy kept pestering me as to
what I believed.  As I had no faith etched in concrete, I kept feeling
like he was "picking" on me.  Finally, exasperated, I asked him why he
was bugging me so much.  I'll never forget the warm feeling that I got
when he said with a slow, spreading smile, "Why, because God told me
that YOU are my project!".  I finally was able to admit that I had many
questions and feelings of ambiguity about my beliefs in God.  He was
able to show me that the various systems of beliefs are like different
sets of clothes in that they might look different, be colored different,
cost more or less but that the fundamental purpose remains the same.
A slightly flawed analogy but it works on a simplistic level.  What our
talks really did for me was to cause me to be aware of what religion was
all about.  After many years of fitting together pieces that at first 
don't appear to be compatible - I have settled on a set of guidelines
that I try to follow.  I still attend Baptist Churches but am not shy to
try out someone elses services.  They all preach the Word of God and the
internal alarm system is capable of flagging erroneous teachings.  I 
stopped attending Oneco 1st Baptist for this reason and am now looking 
at Samoset Baptist.  I don't agree with all that the Southern Baptists
teach but they are so far, the closest to what I accept as the truth.

I declined but we remained friends.  Funny thing is - I don't think he

Here's a hint: I use the transparency material especially for copiers
and use the laser printer to print the PCB design for use in one-off
printed circuits.  Works good but you have to watch for breaks in the 
traces on the material and the exposure is critical.
OrCAD PCB is an unfriendly beast that makes you wonder whether the same

to do autorouting which means a very bare config.sys with only the
mouse driver extra.  Doesn't support any EMS or extended memory either.
I guess I'm hinting that it's a piece of shit, except that it DOES
layout a PCB pretty quick but I feel the optomization could be better.

The concept of variety and a sharing in forms or "participating" in a
form may be novel to you but is not very useful when applied to 
explaining reality.  A much better variation that is closely realated wa
was produced by a behavioralist names Piaget.  He came up with the
concept of "schemes" and uses his theory of schemes to explain the
learning process in children and the ability of the brain to concep-
tualize widely differing bits of information.  Much more useful than
a Platonian universe where pure forms converse with physical objects
that borrow from these perfect forms.  The simplest example I can give
of where Platonian forms break down is the mechanism behind the 
transmutation of an object.  How do forms explain autumn leaves turning?
They already participate in the form of leaf with subclass Maple.
(Gee sounds like OOPs in Smalltalk! - Imagine Plato the worlds first

out borrowing from tree trunk and ends up with (dirt?)  The mechanism 
of change is the weak link in the philosophy.

I have to agree with you if you are stating that using animals for

I used to try and find homes for the lab rats at the college after the

gave them to a pet store but I investigated and discovered that they
fed the helpless rats to rather large snakes.  My personal rat was

Specialist -
Hey. Been a long time.
I've kept out of this straights vs gays arguement but I had to jump in
with some advice (un-asked for tho' it might be).
I think its obvious that you are not going to change your mind concern-
ing this issue and you're not going to change anyone else's opinion so
why continue to kick a dead dog?
Personally, I dont care if homosexuality is genetic or by preference or
is the result of drinking City of Bradenton water...I am not a homosex-
ual, do not care to associate with homosexuals, but do not get drunk
and go "fag-bashing" either.  I have known a few gay men in my time and
I didnt like them /before/ I found out about their sexual preference,
but it was certain aspects of their personalities which all three (a
limited test group I'll admit) shared which I disliked which leads me to
believe it may have been a result of the type of personality group
which are homosexual or have homosexual tendencies.  If I'm wrong - oh
well.  I may have friends who are gay & I dont know it ... but I doubt
it.
  Anyway, it really doesnt matter /why/ someone is homosexual so why
continue to argue about it?  Debate is fine but after a while certain
issues ( like abortion and homosexuality) are reduced to tedious,
repetitive statements that begin to take on the flavor of "Oh yeah?
So's yer mother!"
   Well, thats all I have to say.  Glad to see you back on the boards.

recognizing erroneous statements.  I can't say why, but that made me

     Two digs from _her_ in as many minutes... Angel was keeping score.
Sam was fortunate that Angel's grey eyes couldn't kill. 
     She removed the remains of the roll from the player piano.
Opening the instrument she began to examine the extent of the damage.
Many of the strings were broken, and the felts on several of the
hammers were a bit singed ... all that could be fixed.  But the worst
damage was to the sounding board.  It had a rather large hole where the
designer had never intended one.
     "Afraid it's a lost cause," she said to Xon.  "Should your
employer ask, tell him I'll send someone to remove the wreckage.  In
the meantime, I think I'll tidy myself up."  She retrieved her cape,
but realizing the mass of sodden and singed cloth was also a hopeless
cause, she dropped it in a waste bin on her way out the door.

Gee!  You *remember* those abortion discussions huh?  I ignord every one
of them until it finally died a /richly/ deserved death.  This subject
along with God may be there too.
The problem with God is that the debate has continued for millenia and
no one is really any closer.  There have been many many classes of
philosophical arguments put forth that simply serve to entage those that
insist there is no God.  It is exactly as you state... nobody is going
to change anothers mind if they don't want ti to be.  I guess the reason
debates carry on is that most people have this real desire - nay! NEED
to be vindicated in their opinions.  The way to do this is to *win* a
debate by having the other person admit  they stood on faulty ground.
Not damned likely in the case of a built in bias (aka bigotry).
   To changer the subject - my battle plan against grass worked out
rather well.  My neighbor finally desired to know /when/ I was going to
mow my grass.  I asked if that was a volunteer on his part.  He screwed
up and said he would mow it for $15.  Chortling with glee I informed
him that he had just won the "JonBoy Cash Crop Award" with the winnings
to be counted in bales.  Hehehehehe....  
Y'know there are a group of people in the world that really puzzle me...
they tie themselves down by umbiblical cords undreamed of 40 years ago.
I have seen people fall over things, stumble up - rush - fall again, 
curse, stumble up and finally reach the phone that has been yammering
away all this time.  I saw my roommate in Cal;ifornia come staggering
out of the bathroom, interrupting a perfectly normal rite of defecation,
to answer a phone because I said I was busy and it would wait.  Why?
I class people that are compulsive about there lawns that way (no
implication on /you/ I hasten to add - your spirit is unwilling and that
makes you OK in my book).  Puzzles me why people tie themselves up..

Maybe "subliminal uneasiness" would be a better word.  Yes, I can hear
something that on the surface does not appear to be all that "wrong"
but it makes me feel uneasy.  I will look up references in the Book and
lo and behold, usually there has been either an omission or an outright 
falsehood (I should say mistake but it's his /duty/ to be accurate!)
The Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit is there to counsel and 
"translate" for us.  I see absolutely no reason to doubt that this is
what I am experiencing.  Sometimes the "internal alarm" simply warms
up and I can get a profitable study session on what has been discussed.
   As an interesting sidelight, my Dad, who did not accept Christ until
he was in his 40's, syas he is the same way, I asked him once because I
noticed that sometimes during a sermon he would read the Bible and only
occasionally come up for air.  He said that he was just "nudged" to read
further in what was started in the scripture quote.

Yer a sweetheart!  Please see my reasoning to Turtle.  The feeling is 
real and I believe can manifest itself if the need is strong enough.
A short (maybe) story:  I was having a hell of a time in a long-distance
conversation with my ex-wife as we were in the process of reconciling.
She insisted that when I was watching our daughter (who was 2) in the
back yard that I didn't pay close enough attention.  I was insisting 
that simply because I "turned my head" for an instant did not make me
inattentive.  She was adamant in that I was being neglectful.  Well we
ended up banging the phone down on each other and I distinctly remember
feeling that somehow I was wrong but I literally shrugged it off.  I was
still feeling kinda PO'd when I left to go up to the college.  I got up 
to the street corner and there she was!  A tiny girl holding a doll and
cars zooming around her in the busy street!  I couldn't believe my eyes
and felt my heart drop as I was sure she would bolt and get run over.
I looked for adults and there weren't any.  I turned off my car and ran
into the street and brought the little girl back to the sidewalk.  I 
walked 2 blocks west then back until I found someone; "Do you know where
this little girl lives?".  They pointed me to a house and I went to the
front door.  A nice-looking young lady opened the door with a "what the
hell are you doing with my kid" sort of look.  I explained and she 
immediately RAN into the back yard and came back with a perplexed 
husband.  "Well I only turned my head for a minute - I thought that YOU
had her!"  I left with them still arguing in /exactly/ the same sort
of language that I had been using with my ex not an hour prior.
Serendipity?  /I/ don't think so.  I think that I (and probably the
family too) were the beneficiary of a real-life lesson.  As soon as
I admitted to myself that I had been wrong - I felt much better inside.

I was always told that a very good policy is "never bring up a 
problem without offering a solution".  What devastatingly witty and
totally irrelevant issue would you like to discuss?  Subjects that
are in the paper are good but the real prpoblem was summed up by
King Solomon in Ecclesiastes a couple of thousand years ago.  There 
really is "nothing new under the sun".  No matter what we discuss or
beat up - it has in fact been beat up and/or discussed before.  So
why do we waste our time anyway?
The real reason we do this is because we are social creatures and desire
the company of our peers.  The computer aviled communication is this
social strata's calling card - all others /cannot/ apply.  So we 
simply socialize - which amounts to a lot of social banter and
wasted time (if a meaningful result is considered valid work).

  I have another subject (which may or may not open a can of worms, like
my message on religion and rock)... I noticed lately that more films 
going before the MPAA have been recieving X ratings. Very odd to some, 
since the opponents believe older R rated films had  the same sort of 
contents. One film appealed the rating and won (without making c uts in 
the film.
 
  The proposed solution would be to create a new rating. The MPAA seems 
to be saying no. Why? It would be a perfect solution for the present. 
The X rating has been copied and abused to hell and back. The MPPA still
claims ownership, and I believe it could be used as a scare tactic in 
censorship. "Oh, this film advocates free thinking. Give it an X, so no
theatre will show it and it will make no money."
 
  A big load of manifest bull****.  Opinions?

  That's an interesting story. I was speakin, however, of things more 
along the lines of my paranoia (Yes, I'm quite sure I'm just paranoid). 
I am constantly afraid of someone coming into my home at night with a 
knife. I don't like knives or razor blades. I don't like being near them
(Well, eating utencils don't count, except for those BIG ones)... the 
other thing I don't like thinking of (this really isn't paranoia, just a
sick thought) is having the pointed twisty ends on a wire fence (sort of
like barbs on barbed wire) going into your eyes. I think of that every
once in a blue moon while looking at one of those fences.

Unfortunately - there is a very good possibility that you are right.
It's called power and abuse therof.  So many things start out as

that I was considering marketing myself.  Did you know that they have
the gall to tell you that without sufficient "financial research
initiatves" that it can take up to eight years to get UL approval?
GE for example pays up and only has to provide a representative

I'm not sure about the MPAA, but the network censors supposedly change
their standards regularly to match societal changes.  Example, Saturday
Night Live has been prohibited from re-running certain former programs
that originally met broadcast standards, but are now deemed 
unacceptable, mostly due their message that drug use is acceptable.

  Well, I doubt that will happen. It made people happy to have it back

  One odd thing about ratings... I was always under the impression that 
"Red Dawn" was the first PG13 film ever... but a reputableentertainment 
writer (who writes movie reviews for some sources and writes for Starlog
...) I chatted by echo with once said that Steven Spielberg requested a 
new rating for "Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom". What was odd was 
that he would NOT back down, and I haven't been able to find evidence to
support either claim, except for the video, which doesn't help in 
theatre matters...

Neat thing about the MPAA--the person who pretty much singlehandedly
runs the thing /hates/ it and doesn't like the idea of rating movies
at all. He created it because he thought it was the lesser of two evils;
when it was formed there was a considerable amount of public pressure
building for some sort of regulatory board, and he figured that an
internal ratings board was preferable to an external censorship board
that was subject to pressure from governmental and lobbying agencies.
I do wish the MPAA had copyrighted the "X" rating, though, or would at
least replace it with a new rating ("A" for adult?) that /was/ copy-
righted and couldn't be used by every porno-flick producer who wandered
down the pike.

Mike Greenawald is not GOD by any means. I just discovered why
the statement I make I am who I am. makes people upset.
I am not he but he helps me. He has carried me on his shoulders
over a number of pits in the road.
I do not think that I am ill. My sinus problem is back however.
Ken you are the only dude I know who has a two part handle.
