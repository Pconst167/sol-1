Naah, Life consists primarily of four parts:
Fast cars
Fast computers
Sex
Loud music
 
There are a few other things worth mentioning about Life, like, say,
money, more sex, and Mountain Dew, but those are the big four.

Hmm. I've seen Phantasm //, but never Phantasm. The biggest thing I
remember about Phantasm // was the silver balls that flew around killing
people, and the way they blew up a beautiful mint-condition 1967
Hemi 'Cuda. It was the most obscene thing I've ever seen--when that
beautiful car went up in flames, I wanted to cry. There should be a
law against things like that.

Okay, okay, I'll bite. (And no, I'm not a snapping turtle!) Turtle
is, of course, unique, but most closely resembles a large, anthro-
pomorphic version of a Southeast Asian wood turtle. He's brown and
orange, with orange highlights on his shell. And he is, naturally, a
hard-rock Turtle (a particular sub-species of Turtle, you understand,
which is kind of silly since Turtle's species has no other members and
he is therefore not only unique, but a unique sub-species of his own
species as well...Never mind.)

Do you know how much work a beaver does to build a damn?  First they 
have to decide where to put the damn.  Next they form commitees on what
the enviromental impact will be, what the benefits will be, etc..etc..
Next they have to secure a building permit from the 'Beaver Builders of
America', then they build.  First they have to get the raw materials.  
They either have to gnaw down trees and other items, or they learn 
to drive, and go down to Home Depot and buy the stuff.  But do you know
the kinda looks beavers get when they ask "Scuse me sir, where's the
cement at?  Oh yea, we need a chain saw, and a few dozen 2 x 4s"  
Anyways, once they get the materials, they have to build.  This means
they gotta put up safety nets, deal with unions, vacations, and 
sometimes a strike or two.  And once it is built, they have to dedicate
it to someone.  Since "The Jerry Mathers Memorial Damn" has been used
about 40 times, they have to really think of a good name.  After it's
been built and named, they have to have the ribbon cutting ceremony.
Unfortunatly(sp?), they can't use scissors to well, so they gnaw the
ribbon, which is usually plastic, so they ingest the plastic, and die!

No, not really. Boats (unless they're /really fast,/ like, say, Scarabs
or Checkmates) rank right up there with studying wall charts of
tonsils for excitement. (Although I did get the unique experience of
riding in a Checkmate at about 70 miles per driven by the capable,
if reckless, insane, and demented, hands of a friend of mine once...I
almost wet my pants.) For the necessities of life, boats rank right
after disposable cameras but right before rubber chickens.

well, the damn thing has a 3278 keyboard layout and it's an incredible
pain in the butt to type on, seeing as how the ENTER key is down by the
spacebar, the exact same way the LUIS terminals at New College are
arranged.  In fact, this keyboard /is/ the same as the ones that the

when you press different buttons.  Out in the car I have another

As for 101 Dalmations, I have a very VERY bad tape of that... almost
gives you a headache to watch.  I'm waiting to see The Fox and the Hound
come out on videotape (letterboxed, I hope, but doubt).
 
Have you seen Rock 'n' Rule?  The Demon sequence was animated by the
same people that did some of the work on The Wall.  It has some really
incredible effects that can trick you into thinking you're looking at
a photographed scene (uhm... well, I mean by using video camera effects
like lens flare and limited depth of field, it seems like you're watchin
a live action film).

Some of the photographic-type effects can be found in Don Bluth films
and Disney films, although interestingly enough, only in the intros...
not in the body of the film.  You know, the infinate depth of field
never struck me until I saw Rock 'n' Rule.

I /have/ tried the sailing thang. I used to own a little Sunfish, and
I used to go Hobie Catting frequently and sailing on a 25 footer less
frequently. Notice the past tense. Sailing is boring. B O R I N G .
If I wanted R&R that was about as exciting as watching grass grow, I'd
stay home and watch grass grow; it's less expensive. I happen to /like/
excitement, adventure, and really wild things. My idea of a good time
is trying to keep a VW Bug in a flat spin from flying over a steep
embankment into a canal whilst ripping along at about 60 or so in the
dead of night. Now THAT takes skill, or else it's... BUG OVERBOARD!

You know you're in love when you walk down a hallway and step into an
elevator that isn't there, and plummet down the shaft to land in an
undignified manner upon a maintenance worker, who mistakes you for
Jesus Christ instead of a cuncussion (which would probably be a more
logical guess) and immediately tries to hand you all his money like
the nice preacher on TV told him to do, and in his haste dislodges the
small grenade in his pocket, which falls to the floor and rolls away to
find somewhere greener to be, and comes to rest on the dog, which it
promptly blows up, and you respond "Yes, I believe I will have a danish
with that today" and wander out of the shaft in a blissed-out haze,
totally unaware that your pants are still hanging from the edge of the
elevator door twelve floors above you--at least until you try to put
the lollipop in your pocket and discover it isn't there.

We stuck it in the back of my van to bring to your house, you wern't
home so we took it to Ham center where they had me drive on the 
sidewalk about 1/2 mile, then backup for some reason.  They bought
it because it has an Operating system with it.  Other than that, all I
know is it is named Athena Axelbreaker.  
Athena for the original name for HAL from 2001.
Axelbreaker because it is heavy.

Certainly not the beer. Beer is one of the most disgusting substances

grain, with none of the delicate flavor. Beer is an amazingly noxious
liquid that really should recevie a hazardous waste code...if it doesn't
