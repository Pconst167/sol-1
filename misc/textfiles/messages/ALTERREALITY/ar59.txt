You too, eh?  I find that if you keep them talking, they won't get onto
computers.  When there's a lull in the conversation, they go into their
default mode, which is computers.  To get them out of this, just 
interupt and start on with Post-It fish or something like that.

Well ya don't zactly bolt it down.  You simply attach one end to the
motor and the other end to the frame with a little slack in it.  The
object is just to restrain the thing from rolling over if it gets
loose.  If you put it on tight you may actually cause steering problems
as the torque reaction lifts that side of the car.

after all.'? The comma goes inside the quotation marks.

No doubt. I /like/ bumps...especially large bumps you can launch a car

people on board? It's a lot of fun, although the landing tends to be a

On an unrelated note, Zapf Dingbat says to say "hi," and that he really
hates the company that makes the LaserMax 5000 laser printer since they
spell the name of his font "Zaph Dingbats" in their advertising. (That's

Hey! That reminds me of this time I was doing systems programming on
this DECsystem-20/60, working on a new command interpreter, right? So
I compile this PCL routine that's supposed to be able to give a complete
report on the current system load and the job status and controlling
device of all the currently active jobs, and optionally send it to
TTY53:. So what I do is allocate TTY53: and send the source code over
there, and the damn DECwriter III starts spewing blank sheets of paper
four feet in the air! I hate when that happens.

For some strange reason, a quote from Clint Eastwood comes to my mind.. 
"Dyin' ain't much of a living." I guess it's because I somehow feel that
someone who is dying, and they KNOW it, doesn't have much to look 
forward to in the long run. Therefore, a simple phone call from a friend
would be the highlight of their day. Just a little thing like a visit 
and a magazine...., maybe a new tape to listen to.... anything that
shows that you care.  I realize that it's hard to come up with something
to say to someone is dying... that's why many people would avoid the 
situation of visiting a "ill" person. Same goes for a friend or family
member who has just lost a loved one. 
A while back, my husband's friend lost his wife, my husband began to 
avoid him. His reason: He felt uncomfortable in the face of his friends 
grief because he didn't know what to say to help. 
It's not really a case of knowing what to say or do....., sometimes all 
you have to do is listen, and just be there.

H>Why did you like /Burney/ better?  Is anything wrong with Hacman?
 
Hmmm.  Well, for one, Burney sounds more like a person.  Hacman 
(while it's a pretty cool moniker) brinks to mind a nerdy lookin' 
dude with round glasses, who sits in front of his computer all night,
and knows every GTE access code to all parts of the country by heart,
and even has his own keychain to the GTE offices.  I knew Burny was 
a pretty cool dude with a life and feelings, and I could identify
with him.  I don't know Hacman yet. Maybe it's just because I'm opposed 
to change in general.

          Welcome to the "Den of Decadence".

Long ago in Earth's history, Florida was a part of the
United States of America, a very strong world power. 
Having made peace with the majority of other continents,
the United States enjoyed a long and profitable existence.
In fact, it was a shuttle launched the the United States 
that made first contact with life forms from another 
world. These sentient beings were peaceful and friendly,
reminding most humans of familiar animals of the Planet
Earth, from feline to canine and even Equs. They were welcomed
by the Americans with open arms and eventually their visits 
became frequent and commonplace. The "Furries" as they were affectionately
called by the people of Earth began to move to the 
Earth and share their technology with it. This apparently
angered another galactic force known only as the "Trogs". 
They were sinister looking villains with giant space crafts
and technology so far beyond our own that they met with
little resistance as they brutally attacked the Earth. 

The Continents became divided by huge craters which quickly 
filled with water. Millions of people were killed. A 
holocaust of nature followed as the Earth adjusted to it's 
new form. For a hundred years, mountains moved, oceans 
brewed and the rains and wind wailed. Volcano's erupted, 
earthquakes shattered buildings and Earthling and Furry 
alike were trapped within the assault of disaster.

Finally, the Earth settled back to rest, its face 
greatly changed. What were once great nations were 
now tiny plots of land amidst a giant sea. Much of 
Earth's technology had been blotted out, communications
between and within the nations ceased to exist. 
Accordingly, each island, now a nation onto itself, 
began to govern itself in it's own way. Furry and Human
alike banded together as equals.  In fact, many furries
had married and bred with humans. Their offspring began 
a disturbing murmur of protest from the new governments 
who were mostly human. These children known as "Morphs" 
were basically human in appearance, standing upright in
most cases, but many had animal characteristics. The hair, 
the teeth, the tails. Many of the "morphs" resembled 
the mythical animals from Earth legends, such as cenatuars.
Many of the same people who had welcomed the Furries
began to shun the Morphs. They were treated as freaks 
by the populace. As a result, the Morphs
and their parents banded together and sought out a homeland
where they could live in peace. 

The remaining chunks of Florida known as the Florida Chains
provided them with paradise. They migrated to these 
sparsely inhabited islands and formed their own governments 
and laws. In time, they welcomed "friendies" of all 
nations to visit their paradise.

One such island in the Florida chain houses a place called 
the "Den of Decadence". Just a short distance by boat from
the other islands, the "Den" has become a playground for 
adult humans, furries, and morphs alike. 

Many a sailor stops in at the Den to satisfy
any hunger they may have. Be it for food, drink, or flesh.

Rules for posting in the "Den of Decadence" 
-------------------------------------------

Most importantly, you can only control your own character
actions and dialogue. If engaged in a conversation with 
someone else's character, you may not reply for him/her.
You may not kill or mortally wound another person's 
character unless it is by mutual agreement (via E-mail
or whatever). 

Characters can be visitors from the other islands,
inhabitants of the Den, or Sailors from distant seas.
Be a furry, a morph, or a human. Appearances of the
Furries would be more animal than human and can be 
any type known to Furridom. Morphs are human in 
appearance with certain animal characteristics such
as tails, long ears, body fur, horns, hooves.... but 
mostly human. 

Remember Humans and Furries can breed, their offspring
being known as Morphs. Morphs and human can also breed.

Explicit language is allowed but please don't make it every
other word. (I think we all agree on that). This is an 
adult storyboard, so therefore the posts can range from 
suggestive to torrid. 

If you have any questions, suggestions, or comments, please 
leave them in E-mail.

What you will see:

The Den, itself, is less than a half
a mile inland and can be reached by walking down a scenic clay 
path. There is only one entrance to the "Den", but several exits. 
The main entrance is guarded by two foreboding looking Bear Morphs
who will check your weapons and open the door for you. You will 
find yourself in a large foyer, the decor surrounding you is 
native and tropical (kind of like the Tiki room at Disney World). 
At this point, you are faced with two doors. One leads into the main
tavern; a place to drink, eat, and relax with other visitors. There 
are many tables and large windows that show the tropical foliage 
surrounding the "Den". There are several long bars where 
you will be entertained by dancers, both male and female, human, 
Furry, and Morph, scantily dressed, of course. 

The other door leads to the other side of the "Den". This is the 
"Members Only" section; unless your character is a priveleged member,
he or she will NOT be allowed back there! (Access to this area of the
storyboard is "adult only" and is moderated by Saavik.)

Participants may join the storyboard by introducing characters to the
public access prtion of the Den. These characters may be any type normally
found in the Den, and of any background, but try to make them consistent,
please. Access to the back rooms will most likely be granted only to
those who have shown they have a significant contribution to make to the
story. The public access portion of the storyboard is moderated by Turtle;
the private access area is moderated by Saavik.

The Back Rooms

The other door leads to the other side of the "Den". This is the 
brothel. Within this wing, decorated in the style of an old 
New Orleans brothel, there are many avenues. A long stairway ascends
to the rooms where prostitutes await. 

Through velvet curtains next to the stairway and guarded
by yet more mean looking Furries, there is a Gambler's Haven.
This is the favorite hangout of many sailors. 
It is well known that there are many pirates on the open seas and 
this is the place they'll likely be found. 
From time to time, bounty hunters and hired mercenaries may find 
their way here searching for a certain pirate. The inhabitants of 
the Island will welcome these bounty hunters but they will not 
disclose any information, usually.

	  I hope I'm doing this right, if I'm not, just scream at me, okay?
 
       I awoke, to find myself lying apon a beach, hair bleached and
skin crackling from lying in the sun so far.  I attempt to look up, only
to find that I cannot see!  Hmm.. so I begin to think back, "What in the
hell has happened??", Then I rememeber, Lights in the sky, my ship sink-
ing, people screaming, it was awful.  So I begin to wonder, "Have I been
lying here for weeks, maybe months?"  But I quickly realize that would 
be rather impossible, but thats the only explination.  So I ebgin to
stand, thats when I feel the horrible ache arround my Buttucks, I reach
back, onlt to find my tail missing!!  Hmm.. now things are really 
becoming strange, so it seems that I am missing a tail, in a frantic I 
look around the beach for a loose tail, only to find it barren, except
fot the shells of ChemoPlasatic bullet shells.  
 
	        Tailess and most furryless I begin walking towards the woods 
surronding the beach.  That's when I spot it.  At first my brain fails
to remember exactly what it was.  Then I remember.  Oh, painfully 
remember.  "Sheila", I wisper a loud....
 
	       I look up with tears in my eyes, just in time to see an
apparently mature human male running towards me waving a stick and
grumbling, "Get off my property to your furry scum."  I scram. 
 
	       After traveling for a few minutes I come across a VERY
attractive path, as attractive as a path can be!   So I begin walking
along and notice eyes.  People staring at me and snarling. "Hmm....", I
start to think to myself, it doesn't seem visitors are liked here.  So I
plod along trying to ignore the staring eyes, and my painfull rear-end.
'Tis then when I come across the two Bear morphs.. "You want in or what"
they snarl, "Sure", I reply meekly.  The bears are kind enough to 
quickly frisk me and "accidently" give me a blow on my already sore rump
the throw me enter the foyer, seeing two doors, one marked as private, I
quickly choose the public one, and slow

Today, a friend of mine got a game called Hero Quest.  It's a D & D 
type game.  But, instead, it has a board and playing pieces, I think it'
(it's) kinda neat.  Has anyone ever played it before?

Well, I've played Advanced Hero Quest which unlike yours, the GM 
randomly rolls on a table chart what the maze or castle looks like.
Personally, I think Advanced is a better game but I hate having
to map down the entire maze.  Regular Hero Quest is an easier
game in reference to setting it up though.  Have you played the game 
at all or did you just look at it?

I don't know about you, but my schedule is pretty crammed. When I do get

     Inside the public bar, the scene is quite a jumbles.
Many tables are knocked over, and a bartender is busy
straightening up.  Several very-non-human bartenders move
behind the bar, filling orders for the surprisingly small
number of patrons.
     In the section clearly marked "DANGER - No Smoking"
sits a human figure slowly sipping from a large mug of cow
milk.   He (for he is clearly a he) wears a
robe that is clearly suffering from an acute inferiority
complex.  It has no color of its own, but randomly picks
colors it finds around the room and attempts to associate
with them, but the colors in the room are feverishly trying
to stay away from it.  The overall effect is a darkish, well
travelled, deseised looking garment, with moving muddy
colored patches.
     On his wrists are high-tech wrist-'puters, which, along
with a large assortment of other rare tech items,
unmistakably marks him as an Inquisitor.  The helmet of a
marine powered-armour suit sits in front of him, as he gazes
levely at the entrance.  He looks with unblinking eyes at
the creature that has just entered.
     Two other men are sitting at the bar, aternately
falling of their stools, drinking large amounts of
fermented fruit juice, and complaining about the futility of
chasing after pirate ships, which had left eight hours
previously.
     Other than these, and a party of Tourists playing dice
games, the bar is empty.
     The silent figure beckens the new-comer over.  "You
also seem to be looking for something," he says as he waves
for the bartender to bring the man his choice of drinks.

	     Upon entering the bar I take a quick look around and notice a man
, in trashed robes, sitting ion the No-Smoking section, I gasp, not
because everyone is looking at me, but because someone has entered the 
No-Smoking section.  I notice as he motions to me, at first, I ignore
him, but then I relaize he maybe be my only chance, maybe he knows some-
one who knows who I am, maybe not.  SO, I begin to tread on over towards
the corner, only to fall flat on my face.  Looking up I see some not so
nice looking Ram-Morphs (spur of the moment okay?), laughing at me,  I
begin to get up, but then realize this is not the time to start somethin
, though it is most certainly the place.
 
	     Slowly, I drag myself up and continue walking towards the corner,
being careful to avoid everybody else. 
	   
     I sit down, only to jump up in pain!  "Umm.. it's my tail, errr 
lack of a tail", I embarrassingly explain to the human, "It's still hard
to get used to not having one!"  So I carefully sit down, being sure to 
put a nice soft furry foot between by butt and the hard chair.
 
 	    "Now what", I think to myself.  "Umm.. nice watch", I mumble try-
ing to start a conversation.....

   I part the curtain dividing in the back of the bar and step out
into the bar proper, blinking as my eyes adjust to the light. My
grandmother's eyes, soft gray, not at all typical of someone of
my race. I am three-quarters 'furry,' after all; vaguely feline,
with digitigrade feet, retractile claws, tawny orange-black fur. And
these impossible gray eyes, set behind a very cat-like muzzle. Go
figure. Funny thing about genetics, even when you think you know what's
going on you can still be surprised.
 
   I yawn and step further into the bar, assuming my customary position
at the end of the bar proper. I hope today will be quiet; I'm still
sleepy and not in the mood for trouble. As the bar's "official" bouncer,
trouble is sort of my job, but I can still wish for a few peaceful

Served a three-year stint in the Combined Forces Military, saw action
against the Trogs and later against my own people during the riots,
and then came the Combined Forces Alien And Outside Races Act, and
suddenly those of us with mixed human and alien background were personae

and end up with a dishonorable discharge and a few well-connected
enemies to show for it. No room for ideals in today's brave new world.
Few years as a personal bodyguard, sometimes more personal than not,
few years as a mercenary, and now I'm here, living in the Florida

Behind me, Robert steps through the curtain and assumes his customary

Yes, that is true.  Thus far, I have not run up against many of them,

[SP-good] analogy.)  I have never had to actually hit one.  But let me
clarify something.  It's not like I run up and beat the shit out of any
fag I see (I think that I have said before about how that is not my
"style" to do that).  I simply don't like them and I try to avoid them
as much as possible.  Further clarification: if a fag propositioned me,
and if it was in my power, I think that I would try to hurt them as
much as I could, because they can be just plain ouright offensive.
And they are.

   "Shore leave?!"  I cringe, perhaps asking the Captian for some time
off for the crew wasn't such a good idea after all.  He stands up (and
if you can picture what a Kodiac bear looks like, you aren't too far 
off from my Captain) and crosses his arms.  "I'm suprised at you,
Kearn.  I never thought that *you* would go soft."
  I can feel my nose start to get warm, but I don't let any of my 
anger show.  "The crew," I say in a low growl, "is getting surly.  If 
we don't let them have some free time soon..."
  "Blast thier free time!" he explodes.  "The life of a pirate isn't all
fun and games, and they should have know that when they signed up!  
Now you," he points a large clawed finger at me, "go out there and tell
them that." 
  I hesistate, they aren't going to like this. I am not a small Morph,
and I got my position through assassination, same as the next guy. The
idea of killing the Captain passes breifly through my head.  Not right
now, though.  Besides, it's tough enough to kill an ordinary Kodiak...
and this one has been tried so many times....
  I turn on my heel and leave the room.
  Once on deck, I can see the various men going about thier dutys, and
one or two of them look up at me.  I shake my head, slowly, and they 
nod and go about thier business.  There are a few on this ship loyal to
only me, and then...
   I make my way to the foredeck.  We are lying off the Florida Island
chain, and the booty here easy for the taking.  Just yesterday we trashe
an entire ship...not much of a crew on that one, probably a mere trader.
Of course, it was difficult for any ship to successfully resist our 
cannon.  We had probably one of the only laser guided cannon systems

light ship and fast crew, we were hard to beat.

  I looked intently at the Island for a second, looking for habitation,
and didn't see any.  A deserted island would be a perfect place for
the crew to have some time off, if I could just get it past the Captain'
head.  
  "Good Morning, Sir."  My thoughts were interrupted by the voice of
the Chief Boatswain.  I turned around, and saw that it was not only him,
but quite a few people behind him.  I felt my hackles rise suspiciously.
  "Good morning, Chief."  I leaned up against the rail.  
 
  "We was just wondern' Sir, if you'd managed to get any leave for us."
He moved casually to the edge of the deck, and leaned against the rail.
The other men spread out, and I began to smell something afoot.  The
Chief was human, and I could almost smell how keyed up he was.  I care-
fully adjust the pleats on my pants, and stand up to my full height. 
"Well," I reply, "no."  I begin to get angry because I can tell that 
they are out to get me, now.  The air is thick with thier nervousness 
and anger.  Stupidly, I let my anger speak.  "You men knew that when you
signed up on this ship that it wasn't any pleasure cruise." I turn on 
the Chief...bad idea. 
  It isn't until I hit the water that I realise someone hit me.  
*Ding!* I hear from somewhere, and then the current pulls me down.
 
  I don't know who did it, but at this point, staying down under the
water seems like a good idea, anyway.  A First Mate who was stupid 
enough to let himself get sacked couldn't last much longer on a ship
like that anyway.  I swam towards the shore until my lungs couldn't 
hold out any longer.  Luckly, the shore has a steep drop, and it wasn't
long until I crawled up on the sand, coughing.  I looked back out to 
the ship, but it was way down the coast...seems like the current pulled 
me farther than I realized.  I stand up and start walking.  Away from
he ship.  Presently, I come across a (what else? - finally!) small 
clay path...which I follow.

  When I arrive at the end of the path, a pair of bears greet me 
and pat me down.  I am suprised but not in any position to resist, so
when they take my One-Shot and my Beth-knife, I simply look after them.
"You'll get them back," growls one bear, and the other opens the door 
for me.  I obligingly walk through.  Inside, one door has a sign
which says, "Members Only".  Not me, i think, and take the other one.
 -----------------
  Anyone who sees former First Mate Kearn will see a Wolf-Morph, about
6 feet high, (depending on how he is standing, his legs still retain
some of the wolf that was his father), dressed in a white (now wrinkled)
uniform.  The uniform looks rather like a Nazi soldiers uniform, except
it is white with a more nautical theme.  He is grey, with short fur and
hands with opposable thumbs and fingers.  He does not wear boots.

There are a few places to get the advanced version.  Where we got ours
was the Time Machine in Bradenton.  Every once in a while you'll find
a cool game there that they're tring to unload pretty cheap.  Another
place to get the game is Wargames West Mail-order.  It runs around
50 bucks and comes with 36 figures and all the rules and stuff.
If you buy that you might want to go to a magazine store and look
through some issues of White Dwarf Magazine.  I think the only place
around here that you'll find those is the Time Machine.

"You're welcome, Love." Tampa whispers in my ear as she hugs me from 
behind. I pull up my leather leggings and smile, turning to kiss her 
briefly. 
"I'll see you downstairs, Babe." I smile into her soft almond shaped
eyes and marvel at how much she resembles her canine like mother. 
I pause at the mirror and pick up a brush using my tail. Combing my long
white hair, I watch her getting dressed out of the corner of my eye. 
After pulling my hair back into it's usual pony tail, I survey my own 
reflection. If not for my tail and hint of a muzzle, I would look just 
like my human father. Same build, tall and strong, same eyes, dark and 
latin. And like my father, I have gone prematurely grey at 30. 
I drift back a moment to think about my father, only three islands away,
and wonder when he will make his monthly visit to collect his part of 
the profits from the Den of Decadence. It seems only yestarday that we 
built this place, a port of call for all the travelers on the seas to 
pause for refreshment. 
It has turned out to be quite a profitable venture but I sink almost 
every dime back into it for improvements. Security is my next goal. Too 
many pirates coming and going. Although I welcome them because they do 
spend freely, they bring with them pent up hostilities from many months 
at sea, not to mention the Bounty Hunters. 
I button my shirt and with one last wink at Tampa, I walk out and 
descend down the stairs. 
 
It's still early and no one else is up on this side, yet. No wonder, it 
was a wild night at the Den with three shiploads of sailors arriving. 
Robert and Shandra had to toss half of them out for brawling. 
 
I absently straighten the curtain that separates the "Member's club" 
from the Main bar and slip through into the main foyer. Robert and 
Shandra are already on duty. I nod to both of them then walk through the
archway to the main bar.

"My God." I mutter softly under my breath when I see that the bar hasn't
been straightened from the night before. One of the barmaids shrugs at 
me. 
"Sorry, Boss. It's been one hell of a morning. We still had sailors in 
here from last night." She smiles apologetically. 
"I want this mess cleaned up now." I reply in a firm tone. I rarely 
use that tone and as I see her wince, I feel guilty. "Just straighten
it up before the noon rush." I say in a softer tone and scan the bar. 
 
My eyes fall on one morph who looks to be in sad shape. His clothes are 
ripped and his eyes hold pain. Moving toward him, I notice that he is 
shivering. 
"Excuse me." I say softly as his eyes widen at me. "You appear to have 
had some trouble. If there is anything I can do, please feel free to 
ask. I am Korelyan, the owner here." He looks suspiciously like he has 
been ravaged by someone. I remember the stories my father told me about 
the abuse that Morphs suffered from humans before we came to the 
islands. I wonder if he has come here to escape from this. 
 
He merely nods apreciatively and I nod back, turning my gaze to another 
ruffled character. He is a wolf morph, still in uniform from some ship,
I surmise that he is a left over from last nights rowdy group. 
I nod to him as well, then walk over to the bar to help clean up from 
last night..... by the looks of the growing crowd, it was going to be 
good business today.

Agh!  I'm sorry to hear about your dinner, next time why don't you come
over to our No-Parents dinner.  Scott and a few freinds of mine who
live down here on thier own (no folks handy) all got together and had
a freind-type get together; one of our freinds cooked a roast and they
had mashed potatoes and sauteed onions & mushrooms with gravy.  A really
nice substitute for a family get-together.  I feel pretty lucky to have
my folks down here.  (Sometimes.)

You might want to inquire at a local hospice agency anyway, despite your
crammed schedule. I think that they would accept 3 hours a week or so. 
 
Like you, I like to goof off in my free time, but I've been doing less 
of that lately. 
I've been getting some long put-off things done; it helps keep my

As far as hospices go, right now, I just can't spare the time. Between 
working all day and some nights, I have to split up my remaining time 
between my husband and my children (A must), plus I have to make time
to BBS....., if I didn't, I'd go insane. Or maybe that should be,...
If I didn't, I become normal.

    Nearly knocking over the table as I hurridly back away from it,
I get a bead (as if I were wearing Nanotech wrist :C4000 laser carbines)
between the beady litthe eyes of the pirate who just walked in.
After a moment of not shooting him, I decide that he has, in fact, not
kiiled The Bears as part of a daring pirate raid on the Den, and
I continue to not shoot him, albeit a bit more calmly now.
I look him in the eye for a short moment, and then re-set myself
and continue the conversation with Tail-less, as if nothing happened.
(but I don't take both my eyes off him at any given time.)
"... and then the pirates came /here/.  I think there's more to it than
a bunch of motherless, reptillian, twin-bearded sons of Allah ripping
farmers (if you'll excuse the language.)  They're too /organized/.
See that sailor-type, who nearly didn't just walk in?  He's one of those
sailors that borrows from farmers.  Could be connected to your missing
appendage.  The Nazi Associated American
Communist Party must be making a move on the local pirating business. He
's new to this area: if the Bears had recognized the "sailor" oufit of
his, he'd be walking the plank over the center-stage aquarium for 
tonight's entertainment."  I wave in the general direction of the large
aquarium, the main attraction of which is a large sharknaught, one of 
the many blights the Trogs released in our oceans, affectionatly known
to the locals as "Flipper."

  The bar is a mess.  Here and there people are picking up the mess, 
but overall it is quite apparent the something went down here last 
night.   Across the room, a man dressed in a shabby robe jumps up and
points his finger at me...no, he holds his fist out to me.  I stand for
a moment, not quite sure what he is doing.  He stand like that, watching
me, and I wonder vaguely if I should return his strange salute.  Before
I can react, however, he has sat back down.   Across from him, a small
morph is trying to pay attention to what he says next..."...farmers...
buzz...buzz...buzz...Nazi...buzz"  I realize that I am eaves dropping,
and I put my ears back down.  I haven't moved yet.  A glance to the bar
reveals two other sailors, human types and the uniform they wear 
identifys thier ship and service.   If the captain knew that thier ship 
was here, there'd be a lot of planning and trashing going on...but I 
have no way to get word to the captain, and don't even know if I really 
feel that loyal to him anymore, anyway.  Most likely, the Chief has 
seen fit to escalate himself to my position.  I reach up and pull the 
epaulits from my shoulders...and toss them in a handy wastebasket.  
Looks like it's time to find a new ship.  I check in my pockets for 
money, and find enough to last me for a while.  I glance back up, the
man in the booth is still looking at me strangely.  I walk up to the
bar.
  "Some ale, if you please," I say to the bartendress.  "And something
for that man who saluted me over there.  He looks like he could use a
drink."

Pinch-A-Buck Furniture Store

Anyways, during lunch we went down to check it out.  The guy started
laughing and pulled it out from a secret hidden place.  The medium
is blue ink and crayon on cardboard.  The style is a mix between Dali,
Escher, and a 2 yr. old child.  I picked it up for $2.  I'm just glad I
got a frame with it so it doesn't seem like such a rip-off.

A fire ignites within my body as Korelyan runs his finger down my 
backbone. I close my eyes and moan in anticipation as his hand traces 
down to the base of my tail and pauses, the warmth penetrating through
my long fur. 
Rolling up on one elbow, I reach out and touch his near hairless chest. 
We are so different, Korelyan and I. If not for his tail and muzzle, 
he would pass for a pure human. I, on the other hand, look more like 
my mother; like a red fox with a human build. As my hand travels down
his stomach, I hear him echo my moan. 
"You are insatiable, Tampa." He speaks my name and it reaches my ears 
like a caress. As I roll over onto my back, he presses his cheek 
against mine, his breath warm in my ear. I wish I could kiss him like 
I have seen humans kiss, but my muzzle is much too long. Instead, 
I run my tongue across his cheek and nip his ear gently. 
As he hovers over me, hard and ready, I arch upward, eager to meet him. 
I was meant for Korelyan.... I realized this when I first met him. 
I came to tend bar when the Den of Decadence first opened. Because 
of my nature, I have always been sexually uninhibated, I became very 
popular with the men frequentig the bar. It was becasue of this that 
Korelyan and his father realized the need for the brothel and I was 
chosen to manage it. Shortly after that, Korelyan and I became lovers..
..... and I stopped taking clients of my own. 
Since Korelyan, I have had no other.......
My eyes squeeze tightly shut as he enters me and I wrap myself around 
him, unable to stop the howl that rips from my throat. Furious with
passion, we buck and pitch, the bed groaning with protest. 
With one last lunge, I feel him shudder and I release my passion, 
clinging to him until he rolls off, panting beside me. We lay in 
silence for several moments, whearing nothing but our smiles and warmed
by the after glow. I close my eyes again, savoring this feeling.

The bed moves and the sheets rustle as Korelyan sits up and moves to 
the side of the bed. He glances over his shoulder before reaching down 
retrieve his pants from the floor. "Thank you, Tampa." He chuckles. "Now
I can face daylight." 
Slipping up behind him I press my naked breasts to his back and hug him.
"You're welcome, Love." I coo.
I watch him as he dresses and combs his hair, then slowly I began to 
dress myself. I pretend I don't notice that he is watching me out of 
the corner of his eye. He can't possibly know how much his attention 
turns me on. 
"I'll see you downstairs, Babe." He tosses before walking out the door. 
After he has gone, I lay back in the bed, my shirt still unbuttoned, 
unwilling to leave the warmth and contentment I am feeling. But I know
I must. Finally, hearing doors closing in the hallway, I drag myself out
of bed and face the task of showering and drying my long fur. I wish
that I was more like Korelyan. It takes me an hour to groom my long 
coat. 
Showered, dried, combed, and dressed in a clinging floral sarong, I 
venture out into the hallway. The others are all ready dressed and 
wandering down to the parlor. Robert and Shandra have already hustled 
all of the "over nights" out into the main bar and the maintenance 
crews are just finishing up with the mess from the night before. 
Korelyan and I insist the brothel is kept clean always. 
I make my morning rounds quickly, making sure that every one of the 
Tutes [short for prostitute] rooms have been straightened, beds 
changed and everything ready for a new day of business. There are 
12 rooms all together. I have both male and female Tutes as the Den
is geared for the pleasure of everyone. Each employee and each room 
has something unique, yet I take pride in the versatility of our little

In one room, I pause in the doorway, cocking my head from side to side. 
Up on the ceiling fan, spinning around with the blades, is a black 
whip and a pair of handcuffs. My eyebrow raises and my imagination 
soars. With a smile, I snap off the fan and use a chair to retrieve 
the "tools". I wonder who had this room last night. 
Done with the inspection, I walk down the stairs and push through the
plush red curtains into the foyer.

As I pass through the plush red curtains into the foyer, I smile. 
"Good Morning, Shandra..., Robert." They nod and return my greeting. 
Turning toward the main bar, my stomach growls in protest from missing
breakfast. 
The bar is already starting to fill, I notice, as I walk in and head 
toward the nearest counter. Korelyan is behind the bar and sends me a 
wind. Winking back, I turn to Jesit, the bar tender. "Breakfast, 
please." I smile. 
In a moment, he sets "the usual" down in front of me; three duck eggs in
a glass of milk. "Here ya go, Madam Tampa." He says. 
Uhg! I hate that title. True, I am the manager of the brothel but it 
sounds so..... I dunno..... formal. I play a very low key manager and 
I, myself, no longer take clients.... Not since Korelyan. 
Without fanfare, I down the thick goop. Whiping my chin, I set the empty
glass down and swivel on my stool to gaze at the patrons. 
More of the same, I note..... more in the endless chain of sailors, both
human, morph, and furry. 
One morph catches my eye. He is a wolf morph in a crumpled white uniform
sitting next to another morph who seems to have something missing. 
I try not to stare......., well, by the Gods, it's his tail!!! Er, he 
has no tail, although evidence points that it was a recent loss. I shift
my gaze back to the wolf morph. He's handsome enough but there is some-
thing rather scittish about him. He appears to be watching the door.
I pull my gaze away as my Tutes file into the bar to mingle. 
I notice, somewhat wryly, that Ginger, the rabbit like morph, wanders 
straight over to the wolf morph. I find that completely ironic and 
with a discerning chuckle, I find myself hoping that he is not a 
cannibal.

I finish wiping the bar and satisfy myself that the bar is being 
straightened then wink over at Tampa as she downs her morning eggs. 
I notice she too, is looking at the unfortunate morph who I spoke with
earlier. As I start back toward the doorway, I toss a smile at Tampa 
and walk out to where Robert and Shandra are standing. 
"Did either of you notice the young Morph in the main bar...., the one
with the missing tail? Did he arrive alone? I'm really rather concerned 
about his condition. He seems disoriented."

Well, my parents are only an hour and a half away, but I don't generally
visit unless my father's out of town...we don't get along. Nothing
really serious, mind you; he's just not terribly bright and somewhat
closed-minded. (When my parents were first introduced to the concept of
'moshing' at a thrash concert, for example, Mother said 'Sounds like
fun' and Father said 'You shouldn't do that...you can get AIDS.' This is
in a nutshell a capsule summary of both of those people.)

is the wolf morph addressing me? Yes, it would seem he is. Oh well,
my duties are usually described as 'varied;' I suppose this probably
counts. I step behind the bar, pull a mug of ale, and set it before him.
Peculiar...the crowd's acting kind of funny today. I'm getting some
weird vibes from the guy in the robe. I look around, notice Robert's
put down his newspaper and is watching the patrons with a slightly
puzzled expression. No, not the patrons--the person in the robe. So,
he's getting it too, I guess.
   I step from behind the bar and walk over to his table, in the far
corner of the bar, commanding a good view of the facility proper
(naturally). "'Ello," he says without preamble, "you ever notice 'ow
a chap what's carryin' a weapon has a certain feel to 'im? Even if
'e's carryin' a concealed weapon, 'e's got this certain kind way
of movin', right? Gets so a bloke like me can smell it."
   "Your point?" I say. He smiles infuriatingly and brushes an imaginary
speck of dust from his suit's lapels. Not for the first time, I wonder
of a good strangling might knock him down a peg or two...although
I wouldn't want to be the one to try it. "Well, let's just take that
chap over there as a for-instance. You see 'im give the wolfman the ol'
one-two just a second ago, right?"
   Dammit, why can't that man ever simply come right out and say any-
thing? "Yeah, I did. Weird."
   "Oh, now I wouldn't say that. No, not at all. See, some chap points
'is hand at you, you don't think much of it, right? Same chap points
a gun at you, same way, and you start wonderin' if your life insurance
is paid up. I think the wolf almost got 'is bloody 'ead taken off."
   Patiently, with the voice of someone who's talking to a five-year-
old, I explain, "As I'm sure you noticed, the nice gentleman in the
tasteful outfit doesn't have a gun, does he?"

   You'll be damned. You learned about the nude beaches and gay mayors.
    
   Anyway, my English teacher in 10th grade was nearly identical. 
Mrs. Beitman was one of only two teachers who I know of who managed to
rack up a significant number of demerits.  (The other, well... he got
three days' suspension for picking a fight with a student, but we won't 
talk about that...)  In her class, we addressed envelopes, held debates
about very strange topics, turned around the classroom, and played lots
and lots of chess.  But not much English work.  Possibly because she
rarely showed up before the middle of the class period.
