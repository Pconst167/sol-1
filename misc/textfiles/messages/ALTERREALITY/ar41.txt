The only good solution to flag burning is to require permits. At ten 
bucks a shot, let anyone who feels like it burn a flag. Whe really
cares. If you do you don't understand that this country's ideal is free-
dom, and that includes the right to burn a silly piece of nylon if it 
happens to make a point. The flag is nothing sacred, and burning it does
nothing terrible to our country. Freedom is sacred, and regulating it
out of existence could very well destroy it.  I hope we still have some
people who believe in ideas, not nylon. Now I have an idea.. burn the 
conservatives!!!, the KKK, the Nazi party, and... whoops, those are 
parts of our community exercising their right to hold their own beliefs,
however much they suck. The flagburners.. they just might be maintianing
our democracy, no government is perfect, therefore every government must
be challenged.

You poor misguided invalid-ual.   If you really believe that buring
the flag is stiking a blow for the right to free speach, then I think 
you'd better take a look at the way that was worded. 
 
  The FLAG is the symbol of this country.  Not some odd piece of nylon.
You said alligience every morning to "a peice of nylon"?  I think not.
The men on Iwo Jima put up a pole attached to "a peice of nylon"?
Bull-shit!  Thousands of men died for --- "a peice of nylon"?   The 
people who burn that flag are doing an act of effigy...they are 
trying to burn everything this country stands for, and if *I* ever saw
someone do it in front of me, I'd grab the first thing I could find and
kick the shit out of them!  WITH ALL DUE DISRESPECT FOR SCUM LIKE THAT!

  Sorry to get you so riled up. I know you have your opinion and so on. 
But perhaps I took the wrong way to giving my opinion... Guess it was a

if you start out pouncing TNG to death and lifting the classic up to

 Only partially. I'm not "strongly against" those who burn the flag. I
wouldn't do it myself, but there is a right, and burning the flag as a 
protest works. I wouldn't like it to escalate to some outrageous 
proportions, but the way it is now is fine.

  You're joking, right? Well, that message surprised me. Well, for #1, I

Those that are will go for at least 75 cents each, maybe more (and maybe
less, depending on the total) since they were going for that last time I
checked. 
  
  As for #2, I'm looking to see if anyone wants a specific item. I'm NOT

  Ah, but the bullshit works best!! Anyway, I would like to disagree 
with you. The flag IS "a piece of nylon". It's what the people THINK of 
the flag that put it into the situations you mentioned. To take it quite
literally, YES, we do pledge allegiance to a piece of nylon every day.
But, I don't see how keeping people from burning the flag helps their 
self-expression. Gee, if you tell someone not to do something, they do 
it... Burning the flag can be  likened to sit-ins and such from the 
sixties. They're both ways of protesting, and if you get arrested, it 
makes all the more point. You want to say people can't do things like 
that, too??

The average ST:TNG episode is better-written than the average Original
Trek episode, but the Original Trek episodes that were good were
absolutely brilliant. The new Trek still doesn't have much to compare
with, say, "City on the Edge of Forever," but that's possibly because
there aren't any writers who can compare with the likes of Harlan
Ellison.

The flag is just a piece of nylon. It is a symbol, yes, but YOU CAN'T
HURT AN IDEA BY DEFACING A SYMBOL OF THAT IDEA. Let the idiots burn
away! It's not hurting you, or me, or even the country. There will

YOu do NOT pledge allegiance to a piece of nylon everyday, you pledge
allegiance to the nation which it stands for.  Get that?  "THE NATION
WHICH IT STANDS FOR".  If it was just a piece of nylon then burning it
would mean absolutely no more than burning your favorite T-Shirt. 
(Even thought that would be cotton, but that's beside the point.) When
they burn the flag they are showing thier disrespect for the country and
should be placed in the same category as any other scum who shows such 
blatant disrespect...deported.
  What the hell do sit-ins have to do with disrespect for the country?
And if they do get arrested, that's not *NEARLY* as serious as flag-
burning.  So what?  They sat in front of a Nuc-Plant, or said, "hell-
no, we won't go" or some other such insipid or highly unimaginative
phrase...the first is harmless, and the second is worthy of deportation.
  
So, like, where do you draw the line?  When does something become
too disrespectful for you to bear?  What do people have to trash or 
denigrate before *you* get upset?

they're symbolically trying to burn the entire country. 
   It's natural that the country would try to strike back at those who

   There once was a film to disprove that marijuana made food taste
better. They had ten subjects, five of which were stoned; five of
which weren't. They gave each of them a McDonald's hamburger. The
five who weren't stoned ate the burgers without many comments.
The five who were ate them with great gusto, complimenting the
chefs at McDonalds. Therefore, the film concluded, marijuana doesn't
make food taste better -- it justs makes you think it tastes better.

  I dunno about Scott, but personnally if you don't like the country,
I don't want to hear about it.  If you are going to burn the flag,
well, then SHOT on SIGHT.  But Love it or Leave it are such cliche'
expressions...if you don't like it, don't burn the flag.  You don't 
have to love it, but don't (verbally or with guestures) shout how much
you hate it to the world.

The original message's point was to prove that a person who consumes
great amounts of MD (Mountain Dew) would not have an objective opinion
(meaning that he *would* be biased) about Mountain Dew.  The same for
a coffee drinker on the subject of coffee.

I like them both.  There are characters from both series that I like

Obviously not...but that does bring up a good point. Flag burners
disgust me. So do members of the American Nazi Party, the White
Aryan Resistance, and the Ku Klux Klan. You don't see any movement
afoot to ban the Nazis or the WAR, though; and that is as it
should be in a country that respects people's right to express them-
selves as they see fit. I would //!!MUCH!!// rather watch someone
burn a flag than watch a bunch of whitesheets parade through my town,
but the point is this is a _free_ country and they both have the right
to do what they do. If you live in a free society, you're gonna see

Seriously? That comment was more inflammatory than anything else;
most Christians are a relatively innocuous lot, I suppose. I will
say, though, that I find Christianity in general to be not
terribly interesting and slightly silly as religions go. Theologically,
the idea of being saved for your sins by murdering the diety you sin
against doesn't make a whole lot of sense (and Jesus wasn't your
typical sacrificial lamb who dies pure for our sins, because for that
to work he would have had to have been judged by God, not by man;
my need to judge you is not satisfied if /you/ kill /me/ in your
place), and historically it doesn't have a track record I'd be
proud of.

Taste is subjective. If you /think/ something tastes good, then it
does...to you. Finding someone who says it doesn't taste good doesn't
prove that the food is not, in fact, good-tasting.
 
Pot does excite the centers of the brain responsible for perception of
hunger, though, and I'm sure you've noticed that if you're hungry things
seem to taste better than they do when you're not...

Not a valid argument. Murders, rapists, et. al. deliberatley commit
acts of violence against innocent people. That makes them qualitatively
different from people who do /not/ commit acts of violence of any sort,
or in fact do /anything/ to anyone without full consent, yet who do
things you don't approve of. The logic you used can support ANY
moral judgement at all:
 
"I don't think I have the right to make moral judgements based on
 people's dress."
 
"Oh really? Do you also think that murder, rape, etc. is morally right?"
 
Comparing an act of violence to a behavior that hurts nobody is a
kind of dubious thesis in any situation.

>against the law!
 
No, but on th other hand continual slow erosion of liberty /is/ a very
real problem, and it /is/ happening. We have somehow managed to survive
for the last two hundred years without a law against flag burning;
why the sudden burning need for one now? I am always reluctant to
advocate /any/ limiting of /any/ rights unless you can provide a damn
good reason that it has to be done, and on this issue I don't see one.
The country's not going to disintegrate into a seething mass of left-
wingers and anarchists if some schmuck with a match sparks one up,
and the people who try to insist that our country's future relies
on an anti-flag-burning law exaggerate.

The one thing you /should/ have respect for is our society, not our
flag. Without the society the flag is meaningless. It is a symbol, not
a thing with any intrinsic value.
 
>(An american who burns the flag is no better than an Iraqi or
>Iranian who does.)
 
Wrong. An American who burns the flag is worse. He, at least, ought to
know better. On the other hand, an American who shoots a flag-burner
is no better than a Chinese or Korean soldier who does.

From history. The early Yahvists /were/ war god worshippers; the
Christian idea of God evolved from Marduk, a very old pagan god of
war. No religion springs from a vacuum, except perhaps Scientology.

Allright Turtle, I like it. Getting attention by flag-burning is 
like the child who intentionally mis-behaves to get attention. 
A child /needs/ to have attention.  Therefore it will (if he/her feels
it's necessary) to mis-behave.  (Just a clarifier, I not says kids sit
down and analyze ways to get attention.) OOOPs  above not says, saying
But if a child is starved for attention he/her might start mis-behaving
just for the attention.  It would be "negative" attention but at least
it /is attention.  Somehow flag-burners have adopted this same policy,

I'll probably getting shot down in flames for theis but I going to say 
it anyway.  America, just like any other country, unfortunately has
that disturbing way of trying to convert a country's government system
to ours (democrary).  Like when we threw that dictator out and set up
a democracy.  I agree with you, Turtle when you asked....
T> Are you saying you only have the right to express your opinion about
T. your country if the opinion is positive?? ......
If our country's respond to that question would be "Yes" then I think
we all better scramble for parachutes because we're on the road to 
communism.  Unfortunately governments, all forms of government, have
a bias opinion towards their own form of government, but does that 
make it right for everyone?  Not necessarily,  I personally think
after comparing all forms of government that a socialist government 
with democratic elections would be better then what we have now.
In a socialist economy everyone is little more closer to equal there
You don't have the pathetically poor and the mega-millionaires. 
    To quote a song " The rich control the government,
                      the media, the law,"
   I believe everyone and I mean *EVERYONE* is entitled to their own
opinion. (BTW I hate the bumper-sticker that says "everyone is entitled
to my opinion.) Anyway, whether it be positive or negative, people 
should be able to have different opinions.  Please don't tell me that
we are gonna try to control the way people *THINK* now too.  
   There are a lot of relative things in life.  Ok, someone argument 
in defense of flag-burning, is, it's a symbol of America, just a piece
of nylon.   Well your car is a symbol of your social status and your net
worth.  It means a lot to it owner, yet in reality it just a bunch of 
metal and wires, etc.  Remove the availablity of gasoline, your car
is worthless. Yes the flag is nylon but to a lot of people it means
a whole lot more, a WHOLE LOT MORE.

Not necessarily. Connie Mack, who is generally a /very/ conservative
individual, impressed me greatly when he took a stand against attempts
to censor the 2 Live Crew after they were arrested in Florida. That
particular man stands for what conservativism /used/ to mean; namely,
that people have the right to do what they do free from regulation
and government interference as long as what they do does not interfere
with other people's freedom. That is an ideal I have more than a
little respect for, and it impressed me when a man in high political
office bucked popular opinion and the opinion of his fellow
conservatives to oppose censorship. I still think he's flat-out wrong
on a number of points, but whatever else you can say about him he's no
self-serving moralist.

Nice points, Scott.  I like the way that you said that everyone should
be entitled to thier own opinions.
  I think that the flag should not be burned.
  I think that homos are sick people.
  I think that someone I know is really pathetic. 
 
  That doesn't mean that I should be able to shoot someone for burning
the flag, or make all homos go for intensive psychiatric treatment, or
even be allowed to make sure everyone knows who I'm talking about by
saying his name over the radio.  That'd be wrong.
   
  But if I hated the politicians in Washington, I wouldn't plant 
booby traps in thier cars.  If I didn't like my apartment complex 
manager, I wouldn't trash the common rooms and laundry rooms.  That
doesn't hurt her and does hurt everyone else.  
  
  Don't trash my flag because you don't like George Bush.  You may 
get his attention, but you will piss off a lot of other people in the
process, and probably will cause no change to be made anyway.

Stupid point, I mean it's really pathetic.  It goes without saying that
if a person is going to burn the flag, they /have/ a cause.  People

>Show me where 'the Christian idea of God evolved from Marduk, a very

Easy enough to do. First, go to the library. Now, find any book on the
history of religion or comparative religious studies (or, for that
matter, almost any text on Biblical history). Next, read through it.
Marduk was the prototype for patriarchal monotheistic religion; worship
of this particular diety came out of the Fertile Crescent, and that
religion has influenced everything that followed from that part of the
world--including the religion of the ancient Hebrews.
 
Does it really bother you that your religion evolved from a different on
and didn't spring full-blown from a vacuum? I could point out that even
in Biblical history the concept of god has undergone more than a little
change; that by itself doesn't mean a whole lot.

Then your case was probably the exception, not the rule. In most public
schools up until the last six years or so, it was not uncommon to see
disciplinary action taken against people who refused to say the pledge;
I even know one person who was not a United States citizen who was sent
to detention for not reciting the pledge.

As opposed to artificial people?  Seriously, the amount of users a
computer can claim has no bearing on its technical merit -- just the
advertising resources of its manufacturer.  If, say, someone has the
opinion that the SB180FX is the best 8-bit computer ever made and can
give you valid reasons why he believes that, the fact that you and 99%
of the other people in the world haven't heard of the SB180FX doesn't
make it any less of a computer.  YOUR problem is that you *always* have
a monumental chip on your shoulder now, and even when someone says
something that isn't insulting (like asserting that the PC-Z is better
than the Apple), or in some cases actually tries to post something
friendly, you respond to it like an insult.  I suppose I shouldn't be
bothering to write this, since the last time I tried to write something
more meaningful to you than "stop bitching about things you don't
have experience with" you gave me a pretty damn rude verbal slap.  If
you perceive everything everybody says as an attack when they don't
agree with you... sigh.  Never mind.

  Okay, I'll give you the fact that we pledge allegiance to the country
and not the flag or the nylon. But as I usually find with your arguments
 I can't relate at all, since my beliefs set the comparisons on even 
ground, whereas you have elevated one far above another.
 
  I don't think flag burners are showing disrespect, they're showing the
fact that they don't like something about our country. Granted, some of

> HER NAME IS Marina Sirtis.
 
  Yes, but if I said "Marina Sirtis will be at Vulkon," some people 
wouldn't know what I was talking about.

 Well, unfortunately, the first six issues are in a pretty rough shape. 
They prressively get better up to number seven, and everything from
seven up is pretty much mint.
 
 Actually, pretty rough isn't too bad. The first ise is the roughest.
It's got some indentions where I tried to trace the picture, and it's 
kinda wrinkled.

  Um, for one thing it says "to the REPUBLIC for which it stands", and
for another, it says "AND to the republic"

   Are you sure you want to be proud of that line?

>A person who consumes great amounts of MD would not have an objective

   My point, basically, was that matters of taste are not objective.
What one person likes, another doesn't. In all matters of taste, we
are biased.

   I'm very confused. From the statements you've made earlier, it
seemed that you worshipped Ares yourself. Why do Christians deserve
to be bashed? And since when did they worship a war god?

   Now, I'm confused. In your earlier message, you claimed that
"All people are entitled to live there life as they see fit." and
now you're saying they're not. Should a justly imprisoned man be
free to live his life as he sees fit?

Actually, I do like that George shut down the government for a few
days when Congress couldn't find a budget. But, personally, I felt
sorry when he re-started the government.

My dear sir, you misunderstood my note. What I meant was, one of your
users defined conservative as members of KKK and Nazis. Should I do the
same and define liberals by their more extremist groups?

A point-by-point response:
     
>I find Christianity in general to be not terribly interesting and
>slightly silly as religions go.
    
   Okay. I find it less silly than most newer religions, especially
those associated with the New Age movement. But I can't argue in matters
of taste.
    
>The idea of being saved by murdering the diety you sin against doesn't
>make a whole lot of sense.
    
   Again, I can't argue in matters of taste. But about a billion people
emotionally feel or have felt that it makes sense in their lives.
Other religions have had similar ideas. The idea of the Diety going
away to save His or Her people occurs in myths world-wide. And in 
several, the Diety leaves through death.
    
>Historically it doesn't have a track record I'd be proud of.
   
   Maintaining rough stability in Europe for almost a thousand years
isn't something to be proud of? Being the basis for the majority of
the world's culture for the next five hundred years isn't something
to be proud of? Certainly, Christianity has had its faults -- but for
a world religion, it certainly has done some great things.

My dear sir, you completely missed my point. One of your users seemed
to advocate that anyone should be permitted to do anything at any time.
I wondered if he includes extremes in this idea. Should murderers,
rapists, or thieves be allowed to do anything at any time? I was not
comparing acts of violence with acts that hurt no one.

I beg your pardon? At the time of the Supreme Court case, most of the
states (I believe 48 of the 50) had laws against flag-burning.
        
   I'll check my sources once again.
