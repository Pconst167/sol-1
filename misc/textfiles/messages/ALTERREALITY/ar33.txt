Incohearent hum I thought that I was relating rather well the events
that occurred. Could it be that you are looking for a quick fix
There isn't any. I am presenting a long trm statement with a twist.
I have explained the twist several times to you but you seem to 
get lost. Today I recapped the statements of last week for you.
Why don't you say something so that I can straighten out your delema
with Sam.

I have over three-hundred albums...all the Floyd stuff, and then some...
Music is funny...I remember when trading albums was cool.  The only
problem was, the next morning, you were slightly upset when you realized
they have your WALL, and you got their BEATLES in exchange....:)

SEX THAT DOES NOT RESULT IN SEXUAL RREPRODUCTION CAN BE EQUATED WITH
SODOMY....
       Gee, what planet are you on?  You must have an awful lot of
children...I know I don't have sex for the sole purpose of bringing a
child into the world...I have sex to express my love, and for pleasure, 
but I guess you consider that sodomy, too.  DO you know what the 
definition of sodomy is?  I think NOT.  
      Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary, Unabridged, lists :
        sod'om-y, N.  any sexual intercourse regarded as abnormal....
Well, you seem to regard any form of sexual intercourse as "dirty", am I
not correct?  It seems to me that you aren't having sex so often...
nowadays, people don't just have sex to produce offspring.  They have se
x  for many reasons...who are you to say which ones are right and which 
ones are wrong.

       As far as semen being digestable, well, shall we assume you have
never had oral sex?  Or shall we assume you act like an eighth grader

Thankyou...My cousin blew his brains out almost two years ago...he was
gay, and he had AIDS.  He worked in one of Sarasota's more prominent
restaurants...Michael's on East.  He had a severe allergic reaction to 
AZT, and was given a matter of months...he chose suicide, instead.  It's
very painful for me when someone says "if anyone in my family was gay, o
r  had AIDS, I'd disassociate with them".  My cousin and I were very 
close...and trust me, if you were in the position, and you weren't a 
complete bigot, you'd change your mind....I can be a very cold person
(ask my boyfriend), but I cannot be a bigot.  There is a difference.
Until you are put in a position where you have been assaulted or lived
with AIDS, I ask you to tolerate.  You've no reason to breed so much 
hatred.  Gays are people, too...just like you and I.  They have hearts, 
and very strong wills.   You've no right to even WANT to take that 
away from them.

When I was still a newlywed, and worked three jobs, my wife asked for
a poodle to keep her company.  I saw an ad in the paper one day and went
to see this poodle that was for sale.  I rang the doorbell, the door 
opened, and this poodle ran out and pissed on my foot.  "Gee, she's
never done that before." they all said.  Now, six years later, when you
visit the house of the Yngling you have to dance when you first arrive
because the damn thing still tries to piss on the feet of anyone who
rings the doorbell...of course it comes in handy when the God Squad or

Beatle,
Unfortunatley there are many to whom a knife or a gun is in fact a
phallic symbol used to hide their own feelings of inadequatecy (SIC?)
- ghod, I hate it when I spout psychobabble but in this case its true -
but the art of making and weilding edged weapons is a time honored one
and shouldnt be the source of the fears you have described.  An asshole
is an asshole whether he has a knife, a gun, or nothing in his hand.
   Maybe some day someone will teach you a little about the martial
arts and you'll overcome this fear you have.

Even the best of points is lost if you relate it in a manner that's
incoherent, excessively verbose, or simply boring. Over the past
several weeks, I've read a whole series of messages from you about
Sam; so far, you've repeated over and over that (a) he got drunk,
(b) you like his chest; (c) he got drunk; (d) you put him on
a table; (e) he got drunk. It's taken you about a thousand words to
relate that much. If you have a point, please, get to it. I hardly
think the responsibility for my failure to grasp your point lies with
me.

I believe that you now realize that I follow what you say with great

  Nobody asked me that.  As a matter of fact, the only reason this 
whole thing started was that I called Bobby McFerrin a faggot.  Of
course, Donthen objected to the word "faggot" and then I posted a 
really rude letter about faggots, which conveniently got 'erased' in
a 'disk failure'.  
  I note that you didn't debate my point about whether or not that 
'predisposition' was the defect in question.

someone else's genitals.   After all, that IS where urine comes from.

I see...so now you believe in consenting eggplants, right?  
And you missed the point, whether or not semen is digestable is 
more irrelavant that what I was saying; it was not meant to be eaten
as was eggplant.
T>Therefore, judging anybody on the basis of a stereotype is at best
T>risky and at worst does them--and you--a grave injustive.
 
Yes, I suppose judging *anybody* on the basis of a stereotype isn't
right. But if you wandered downtown Harlem (no offense, tyring to make
a point) and ran into a young b,Ock man who exhibited all the signs
of someone who might be apt to rob you (or a white, or chicano, or 
whathaveyou)  would you refrain from "judgement based on stereotype"?
Or would you walk up and introduce yourself?  "Hi, my name's Franklin,
but my freinds call me---oooph!"  (Man running away)
  
  So you can see that in all cases judging by stereotype isn't 
inaccurate (despite how "wrong
(SHIT!) it might be).   Besides, I don't like faggots anyway.  If
someone looks like a faggot and acts like a faggot, I don't want to
hang out with them anyway.  And I would be doing THEM a favor, too. 
What fag would want to hang out with a fag hater? And if they didn't 
act like that, I still would not want to hang with them, because I know
what they are really like.

For the most part, I have already figured out your attitude.  With the
stipulation that it is a sickness, you are trying to understand, but
the other example you have given me;
B>mental illness, alcoholism, and things along those lines...
are not good examples.  Alcoholism can be treated, for one.  Mental 
illnesses, (depending on thier severity) can also be treated.  Obviously
alcohol abuse is not the norm, and equally obviously, mental illness.
Yes, they are still a part of society.  But suppose you ran a business.
Would you hire an alcoholic?  Or a severely mentally ill person?  I
don't think so, but is that discrimination?  
  
  And I don't think you have assumed my arguement...you are still 
defending.

As far as the question you asked me (homos going hetero)...I get the 
impression that you are trying to prove that it is (or was) a matter
of choice.  It's kind of tricky, really.  Just because a person act
sane, doesn't mean that he is.  Let me correlate...a fag goes straight.
Is he still sick?  No one knows, except him.  Does he still think about
other men?  No one knows, except him.  The inclination to be homo from 
the outset indicates mental illness.  If by chance he totally manages
to go completely straight, then he can still be haunted by his memories.
He may be "cured" as an alcoholic reforms, but he still used to be sick.
  
TS>It does as far as sexual relations is concerned.
B>WHY!? Back that up!
   
It's very simple.  I will repeat what I have been saying all along.

Turtle, I thought you knew MuSh-DOS!  Xteve, the proper command

All that other garbage was put in your DOS manual for the express

At least, I think so. 
  
Or you could use driveparm (if it's part of your software) the 
same way...I've found versions which don't use it or won't recognise
it.  The command above sets up your 3.5 as another device, drive
C: or D: depending on whether or not you have a hard drive...it makes 
it the last drive in the system.  You hav eto use this designation when

Well, now, waitaminute.  I never said that I didn't believe in God.
I am sure that there is a God, by circumstancial evidence if nothing
else.  I don't say that it's YOUR God, or any one elses.  (Thier HAS
to be a God, all these things that are could not have been simply 
by chance...about as much chance as me throwing a truckload of lumber
out into the universe and it coming together to form a house...not 
bloodly likely.)  
  So, I think there is a God...but I don't KNOW that all this h
hullaballoo that all the Christians or Jews or any other religion 
offers up is really going to impress him.  I don't KNOW that the
books you offer as 
(dyslectic keyboard) proof of 'God's word' are actually God's word.
(Hell, they were written by men!  Don't give me that crap about
'divinely inspired', either.)  And I resent that I have to worship
him or else end up in hell.  Damn right I do.  
  I just think that the bible is a load of bullshit written to 
control people.  And it has, if you think about it.
  
Sorry, but until I get proof...real proof...I'm not convinced.  It 
remains bullshit.  I'm not as eloquent as Turtle, but he has
a very, VERY valid point.  And he expresses it perfectly.  I can't
say that with enough conviction in type.  I admire him for his 
eloquence, certainly.  I think he's a little weakminded on one
other thing, though.
  
I guess that I'll obey Gods word...when I hear it from GOD.

It must be wonderful to have such a simplistic view of life - 
unencumbered by facts.  Men have been wearing earrings on and off for
centuries and yet it is still held to be a feminine /affectation/.
A trait is something that is endemic to the gender.  The clothes that
are worn does not a trait make.
Your morals have absolutely nothing to do with another human beings
sexual preference.  I know that it must be devastating to realize or
have to grip with the reality of the situation but you really must

I have one of each type (I can't remeber the longer one's name) somewher

there in the mid-sixties.  Genuine?  Hell I dunno - maybe when I go home
I'll bring them back and you can peek at them for me.  They have a two

the silk cord bindings.

   Wish I could tell you more about it, but can't remember any more
details.  Read the story originally in TV Guide and later heard it
repeated by the producer of SNL in a radio interview.  This was several
years ago during the time of Billy Crystal and that group.  SNL always
has to have at least one repeat ready to run in case for some reason
(technical or otherwise) they cannot air a live show.  The choice of
re-run must be approved by the broadcast standards department (censors).
At this time they wanted to have as backups several episodes from the
original season; the network censors banned them.

   "EEGADS RUFUS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON THE FLOOR????!!!!"
   With a tone and inflection usually reserved for the mentally deranged
, what appeared to be an enraged dwarf stumped into the bar. 
   He was only about a meter tall and from his head radiated an almost 
halo-ish mass of black hair, which cascaded down the front of his head 
only to merge with a beard which not only covered his body from chest to
cheek, but looked like it had taken several centuries to grow. In back, 
he had a thick black braid which, had it not been draped over the large 
oblong bag slung over one shoulder, would surely have trailed out the 
door by which he had just entered.
   Turning almost as one, the denizens of the bar regarded him with a 
mixture of reactions that ranged from startled suspicion all the way to 
amused perplexity. Suddenly aware of this abrupt flurry of scrutiny, the
dwarf grunted once and promptly made his way over to the fallen form of 
the hapless insurance salesman.
   "Ghods, Ruf. You look terrible."
   The response was long in coming.
   "Well, aren't ya gonna say somtin'"
   Realizing that something was amiss, the strange little man bent low 
over Rufus' inert form and peered at him intently. After a few more 
moments had gone by, he straightened up, looked around in apparent 
confusion, and started rummaging through his own pockets.
   With a cry of almost child-like glee, he resurfaced holding a roll of
white cloth, a small vial, and something else which was obscured by his 
holding it close to his chest. the short, stocky figure then hunched low
over Rufus' body, thus making certain that no one could see what he was 
doing clearly. Without warning, the dwarf started humming loudly. The 
tune struck a familiar note in Turtle's memory. 
   There was a sound like a spritzer bottle being used, and just as 
quiclky as he had fallen, Rufus (freshly bandaged, trenchcoat and all)
sprung to his feet.
   "HUNGGUH GUH HUH HUNH NUH", Rufus exclaimed loudly.

I know a person who was engaged in a tragic lawn mower accident once.
See, he was mowing his lawn, which he'd let go for quite too long, with
the result that it was most unmanageable. Anyway, he accidentallly
uncovered a unit of Green Berets who had mistaken his lawn for
Cambodia and were on manuvers, which (as you might expect) startled
them almost as much as it startled him. Anyway, they responded with the
grace that has made the Green Berets a shining legend in the hallowed
halls of diplomacy the world over; they shot him. One hundred and
forty-seven times. They also shelled his lawn mower and called down
an aerial strike on the poodle he'd lost in there three or four months
earlier. (The poodle, lost and alone for months, had reverted to its
true roots by then, which is a different story...suffice it to say
that the dog commandeered an Apache assault chopper and inflicted
grevious damage on the Green Berets' position before it was finally
taken out. Scary things, those poodles.) This activity had the
unintended side effect of severly startling his young neighbor, Jimmy,
who was in the back yard playing stickball, with the result that
he accidentally and /not/ on purpose as some people claim knocked a
baseball through the window of an innocent, if crabby, old lady
down the street, causing the destruction of her entire collection of
"Star Trek" hand-painted china plates she ordered from The Franklin
Mint. Those power lawn-mowers--tools of the Devil they are, and hard
on china too.

I've read "Ender's Game" but not "Speaker for the Dead." I don't
recall much discussion about artificial intelligences in "Ender's Game,"
but it's been a while since I read it. Speaking of which...have you
ever read "Neuromancer"? Interesting point in that book: an artificial
intelligence, even one whose hardware was modeled after a human brain,
would likely be so alien to humanity from the standpoint of worldview,
self-image, even basic motivational forces, that getting a handle on
what would motivate such a thing or how it would react in a given
situation would be essentially impossible. It'd possibly be even
more alien than an intelligence from a different evolutionary scheme
that was still organic--like, say, aliens from another planet or a
"Star Trek" rerun.

The longer sword is a katana; the shorter is a wakazashi. (Wakasashi?
Dammit, I should know, but my head is filled with a neat-O sleepy fog.)
The genuine articles are /very/ rare and most are worth tens of
thousands of dollars at the very least. The only person I've ever known
who owns a set has had them in his family for generations; he takes them
to Japan to have them sharpened, and /NOBODY/ save for maybe three
people is allowed to touch them EVER. There is a great deal of ritual
that surrounds everything from the forging to the cleaning of a
katana; it's absolutely amazing. Watching someone handle one of these
things is rather like being privy to a very intense religious
experience.

The MPAA does have an "X" rating, and they do apply it to films.
The difference between the "X" rating and other ratings is that the
other ratings have been copyrighted by the MPAA; that is, you can't
call a film "Rated R" unless that rating was given to the film BY the
MPAA. The "X" rating, being uncopyrighted, can be applied to anything
by anyone, and as a result has been more or less taken over by the
industry that produces pornographic movies, with the result that the
"X" has become synonymous with porn (NOT the original intent). There
is a proposal afoot now to replace the "X" rating with a copyrighted
"A" (for "adult"), which could be applied to movies that are not
pornographic but would otherwise receive an "X"; presumably, makers
of porno flicks would not go through the MPAA ratings process and
would continue to use the "X" rating, providing a fairly obvious
distinction between, say, "Debbie Does Dallas" and "The Cook, The
Thief, His Wife and Her Lover." (Were they actually to be reviewed,
though, they'd both recieve an "A"--the MPAA itself is not set up to
differentiate between pornography and "serious" films, which is as it
should be.) Anyway, yes, the "X" is a real rating. Films with an "X"
which the producers don't want to edit are frequently released unrated,
though that's the choice of the movie company and not pecause the X
isn't a genuine rating.

entire thread (or pushing it back on topic, at least), or dropping their
accounts.  Luckily for those concerned, this isn't the Den, of course.
(If someone wants to accuse me of being "intolerant" because of this
attitude, fine.  As Bryon Dayton said, "the one thing I'm really
intolerant of is stupidity.")
 
Specialist, you're beginning to rant again.  As I think I said a while
ago, the issue for most of us isn't the morality of homosexuality, but
whether or not it is right to abuse someone on the grounds of their
sexual preference.  You believe that it is, and so far don't seem to
have defended it any further than saying "It's sick and if you don't
agree with me, you're blind."  Incidentally, this is much the same
reasoning that led to the rise of Nazi Germany: Jews are evil and if you
don't agree with that statement, you're blind to the real truth, no
matter what evidence you present to the contrary.
   The ratio of people I like to people I don't like appears to be
relatively consistent among heterosexuals and homo/bi people.  If I like
someone, I don't care who they sleep with, and if I don't like them,
it's not based on who they sleep with.  It's a shame you don't see this.

 1.  I can dig it but you're still tilting at windmills bud.
 2.  I quit the storyboard back on the Den when my puter caught a virus
 and so I killed my character off since I didnt know how long it would
 be before I got back and I didnt want to screw up the storyline.  Of
 course that was when Spellwind was doing his best to pick a fight with
 my character and by his definition his character apparently was omni-
 potent (or maybe just impotent :> ) so it seemed like it wasnt going
 anywhere anyway.
 3.  Did you ever get a chance to read Heinlein's "Grumbles From The

I know you may not believe this but it IS true.
One night I was riding out near MCC (back when it was MJC not McCollege)
and as I approached the light at 26th Street and 53rd Avenue I applied
my brakes as the light was red and hit an oil slick from an earlier
accident.  The bike went down and dragged me with it thru the inter-
section.  An MSO cruiser was in the parking lot and saw what happenned,
and wrote me a ticket for running a red light!  I tried to fight it in
traffic court and the judge let it stand!  And the cop had the stones
to tell me I was lucky he didnt cite me for Failure To Keep Vehicle

If society believed that association with homosexuals or anything that
remotely resembled mild toleration of them was wrong, then you (i.e, the
doctor) would best protect your reputation by saying that they are,
indeed, sick.  This hasn't been said in the last 50 years or so because
there's not that much evidence to support it, except "gut feelings" of
those who don't like homosexuality.  Again, this has nothing to do with
whether or not it's morally right to associate with "them."
 
Would it completely baffle you if I said that I think the true wrongness
in this 'debate' is rejecting a person based solely on sexual
preference?  You have said in the past that if you found out a friend of
yours was homosexual/bisexual, you'd stop associating with him/her.
I would say that if you in fact did this, you'd have backstabbed this
person: the failure would be yours, not his.  I accept your belief that
homosexuality is wrong, even if I don't agree with it.  I do not accept
that this is a reason to refuse friendships and break other ones; in
fact, if the measure of an act's wrongness is the harm it causes to
others, your viewpoint is more harmful than two men in a sexual
relationship could ever be.  I honestly wish you'd stop ranting about
how much you don't like the act and THINK about what I'm saying here.

The plight of the animal.  "Inserting objects" may, indeed, be kinky

Sigh.  The difference between homosexuality and gerbilling, incest,

As you may not be aware of the mine field you are approaching, let me
merely say that an animal dying for "medical science" could (note I
said "could", not "should") be considered quite different from one dying
for someone's gratification.  A medical student learning on a cadaver
is qualitatively different than someone whipping a woman to death for
pleasure.  To answer the question more directly (and more personally),
I believe that both gerbilling and high school-level lab dissections
ARE sick.

  Yes, and if the music won't compare, their place in history will.
 
  Turtle, I have been thinking about your comment about Beatles 
fanatisism. And it doesn't surprise me one bit. Since you are not a 
listener of early 60's music, you don't have a reference point to make
a comparison between Beatle "drivel" and other stuff. Back then, the 
parents were trying to get rid of drivel too, since it was "rock" drivel
... sure, the lyrics were simple. But the talent of the Beatles was 
obvious. And they innovated so many fields, too. They used recording 
studio equipment in new ways, and later wrote really good songs, and 
they made the first music videos.
 
  So, if the early lyrics were drivel, then so be it. But no rock group 
was as innovative (and influential on music) as the Beatles.

  I agree 100%  I don't like the fact that worship is a requirement to
live a goolife, or you go to hell.  
 
  If you want to believe in religious coincidences and stuff, there is 
an interesting  story.
 
 John Lennon once said: "Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink
. I needn't argue about that. I'm right and I will be proven right...
Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them
twisting it that ruins it for me."
 
  When this appeared in an American magazine, a radio station in Texas,
KLUE, sponsored a Beatles bonfire. The day after the bonfire, a bolt of
lightning struck their transmission tower, knocking the news director 
unconscious, and extensively damaging their equipment...

  From my experience, the MPAA started out with a G, PG, R, and X. It
sounds like there's some semi-logic involved with the "no rating" idea.
If the film isn't suitable for anyone under 17, don't give it a Parental
warning. Still, major motion pictures went through with Xs. "Midnight 
Cowboy", an oscar winner for best picture, was rated X (now rated R).

  Where is it said, however, that they can do that? Is that only because
of the X not being copyrighted? Does this mean the makers of "Nightmare

rated R, with no rating??

I use the King James version.  Matthew chapter 16 verse 18 "And I say 
also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build
my church; and the gates of hell shat not prevail against it."
  Greek dictionary defines hell in this sentence as hades: unseen or
the place of departed souls:-grave, hell
  Greek dictionary refers to another definition of hell called eido
(i'do): to know, be aware, behold, consider, understand.
  (King James version) 1st John chap 5, verse 7 "For there are three
that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost:
And these three are one. [verse 8] and there are three that bear 
witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these
three agree in one."
  I always use the King James version and will be more careful to 
specifiy which translation I'm using in the future.

Anyone anywhere at any time can release any film unrated. There is no
law that says "A movie shown to the general public must carry an
MPAA rating." The MPAA is strictly and absolutely a /voluntary/ ratings
organization. HOWEVER: Most movie houses, and almost all the large
chains, will not show an unrated movie. A movie which carries no rating
has almost the same degree of difficulty that an X-rated movie has; you
can't get it into most theaters (other than art houses), 'cause the
rating is how the theatre owners cover their asses.

An .ARC file is essentially the same thing as a .ZIP file. It is a
file that contains other files which have been compressed to reduce
space. The principle is the same in both cases: I can take a whole bunch
of disk files, use a variety of sophisticated (or not) mathematical
techniques to make them smaller, and put them all together into one
file. Then, with the right program, I can take them all out again and
return them to their original size to use them. Arc files (archives)
end in .ARC; zipped files end in .ZIP.

  The Great One was drained due to the massive amount of mental energy 
she'd been forced to expend. She'd barely sensed the bomb in time to 
put a psionic field around it - but if she hadn't, this lounge would 
have been a crater. It wouldn't have bothered her or her familiar much,
as they were practically immortal, but the blast had nearly made 
hamburger of her prey.
  Why would anyone use such a crude device? Big Blue was offering 
mega-credits for the conspirators, but it was essential to keep this
one alive in order to track the others - or were they already here?
It was probably the work of those idiots at Bountyhunters 'R Us - with
their tax structure, they might be using this case for a write-off. In
any event, for now it seemed better to play a waiting game and see if 
this terrorist would tip his hand or lead her to the others. Perhaps
she would have her familiar establish contact with the criminal.
  But for the moment, the Ample One was content to rest and recuperate
from the mental drain of the psionic field. She gave her pet a
telepathic nudge, and Vafthrudner reached down to gently stroke Gjolp's
aching temples.

I feel that when "sexual" context is not involved, there is always 
degrees of a criminal act (or sick act if you prefer). Like hitting
a kids butt with a wooden paddle is okay, but hitting him on the back 
is abuse. Slapping a kid around because he wouldn't be quiet in a 
resteraunt is okay, but doing it because he could figure out how to
fix the radio he broke is abuse. There are many lines of levels until
you cross the "sexual" barrier. Then its' all lumped together. Why
isn't the same opinion held for non-sexual child offenses as are
held for sexual (for by your own admission, sex in these cases is
a form of violence)? Oh yeah, just for sake of arguement, I WAS 
sexually abuse once when I was three and had it held from me until
I was thirty, had nightmares of it all the time. When my mother 
started to tell me about it I described the whole event to her in detail
. Really shocked her...but explained the source of my dreams.

subtitles, a good bit of nudity... but no rating.  Perhaps the reason
that the movie is not rated is because the producers were to cheap to
pay the $1000 rating fee to the MPAA.  Oh well - Oakmont covered their

Hey, that ain't getting off the subject--sure, any translation of
fragmentary records six zillion years old will have problems. It's just
that the KJV is such an amazingly poor translation that in places it
doesn't even bear passing resemblance to the original Hebrew text--as
poetry, it's great, but as a codification of the principles and beliefs
of the Christian faith, it sucks rocks. A lot of sticky points in
Christianity upon close examination turn out to be nothing more than
translation errors..if you're gonna be debating the fine points of the
religion, it helps to know which are the real bugaboos and which are
ghosts.

make the case that sexual abuse of children is just that--abuse. If
yer gonna call those who sexually abuse children "sick," yer also gonna
have to say that people who abuse them are "sick" by exactly the same
logic. Abuse is abuse. In any event, the thrust of that reasoning was
that there is a qualitative difference between sexual abuse of children
and homosexuality, and that labelling them both as "sick" and lumping
them together just don't cut it. *Yawn*...I oughtta be in bed now, but
no.

Opposing sides nothing--any belief system is a continuum, not a
dichotomy. It's not like you're either in the "for" or "against"
camp--despite what a lot of people would like to believe, there are
simply not any forms of human interaction that are that tidy. We do
seem to be about .001mm apart, but I hardly think that puts us on
"opposing sides."

Pithing a frog is hardly THAT bad a practice--for all intents and
purposes, when the brain is destroyed the frog is dead. It's not
like he's still aware of what's going on and can't move; the frog's
brain si /gone/. That's not a defense of cutting apart live frogs,
mind you--it's just a clarification of what could quickly become an
emotionally charged misconception. A pithed frog is in any sense that
matters for this sort of thing DEAD.

Heretic! I most strongly insist you run--don't walk, RUN--to a
record store and pick up a good assortment of Pink Floyd RIGHT NOW!
 
To answer your questions: Pink Floyd, after a bad start during which
they sounded like nothing so much as Beatles wanna-bes, quickly became
known for their tendency to push the limits of whatever recording
technology was available to them (kinda like the Beatles did earlier).
They also did all sorts of rather unusual stuff during thier concerts
(and still do--Pink Floyd concerts are famous for their technical
sophistication, and keeping them touring these days costs about
six hundred thou a week what with their stage setup and all...) It'd
be hard to look at something like "The Wall" and say it was less than
remarkably innovative, as well.

Hmm...that's odd, everything I've read about "Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down"
has been pretty positive. 'Course, Siskel and Ebert didn't like it,
but I don't trust those bozos to tell me that I needn't go see the
latest Rambo flick. "Tie Me Up..." was actually rated by the MPAA;
it got an X. The director adamantly refused to edit it down to an "R".

I don't know if you really want to unzip an unkown file directly to 
your hard disk. Believe it or not, there are unsavory people with
keyboards out there.
 With two floppies, put the file you want to unzip in A: , the default
drive and pkunzip(or whatever decompression program) in the B drive
 at the A promt, just type B:pkunzip filename <return>. The unzipped
file will be on the floppy in A, and you can decide if you want it on
your harddrive or not. This also gives you the opportunity to delete
any READ.ME or printer drivers that you don't need eating up disk space.
'tis best to do this onto newly formatted floppys, that way you can see
what's really in there. Of course, a determined hacker will get by 
casual users like us anyway, but taking a few precautions doesn't hurt.
  Also, do you have the complete PK file or just the PKUNZIP? You
can get the complete file on most bbs's, and scan the docs.

> Heretic!
 
  Hey, give me a break! I'm stuck in the pop zone, you know. :) Well, 
thank you for answering my question. I'll have to borrow some Pink Floyd
tapes and listen to them...I dunno who has any. I can't be counted on to
buy them, since my very nature is of a collector. And the worst kind of 
collector is one that has no money... you miss a lot of good stuff, and 
you go out and SPEND as soon as you get some money (and no matter how 
good Pink Floyd are, I'm not making them a priority on my list)..
 
  Speaking of music, I noticed back in the far reaches of a Beatles book
that there was a group called the Futz back in 1970 and, you guessed it,
they only did two songs ever...
  Thought I'd mention that since you (as far as I know) created the 
phrase "futz with it".

Howdy, C'est Moi.  I found out from Charles that  the "8087" is not the 
same as the "8087-2" in that it is not a chip for a 10 Mhz machine, its
for a 4.7 Mhz machine.  Either he's a good saleman or he's right, so I 
went ahead and bought the chip he had.  Thanks for checking out the one
at your work.  I had AutoCad 10 working for about two minutes and then 
my hard card stuck for good.  So I'm not going to be using much of anyth
ing for a while.  The coprocessor really did speed things up compar-
atively fast though.
  I don't have your home number by the way. 
  P.S. : Rosey1 is looking into getting the HP Plotter driver for you.  
he has the latest release and a release from the recent past, but who 
knows whether they will be compatible...

  You know, I'm GLAD I'm not going to be home on Saturday mornings. And
you know what scares me more than having the New Kids and Boys Next Door
on Saturday mornings?? I'll bet that CBS tries to combat those shows by 
making their Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show like the current Turtle 
tour going around the country. Yes, they actually dresspeople in Turtle 
suits and make them mimic music!!
 
  But really, the TV season won't  suck wombat droppings. There's a show
called "Ferris Bueler"!!!!
