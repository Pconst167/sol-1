The topic "Suicide" is depressing to me too. I'll gladly drop it. 
(boing) Hey, it bounced. (sheepish grin) just like my checks. 
  
New topic: Did you see the news reel the other day on the cops that 
viciously beat a suspect? Some guy caught it on video tape. God, it was 
nasty. The cops had the guy down on the pavement and they were wailing 
on the poor guy with their nightsticks. I'm sure every cop alive has to 
have felt like doing that to someone before but Geees, they screwed 
themselves on that one. Not only did they get their butts suspended, 
but the guy will walk (limp) away from any charges they may have had 
on him.

Depends. A really creative, nasty slam is a work of art that may take
days or weeks to produce. Your garden-variety slam comes as easily to
some people as idle conversation about the weather, and is about as
interesting.
 
One thing I do wish more people would do (and this applies most strongly
to Mr. Steel) is to be somewhat less easy to provoke. The recent
exchange between Mr. Steel and Groucho, for example, is just the sort
of nastiness that can be avioded althogether if people will not
attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance, sarcasm, or
whatever. (This is a rule on many Fido systems, and a damn good one,
IMHO.)

I saw this videotape on MTV once: this demonstration was going on in
this city and the cops came in with nightsticks and started laying into
everyone within reach. The guy taping it was up on a fire escape, and he
filmed these two cops running up the fire escape after him. They dragged
him off of it and started beating him into a pulp, while the camcorder
was still running. The guy was trying to cooperate with them completely
but they just kept beating him without stopping, even after they had him
in handcuffs. Good stuff. I've met some police officers like that, in
Ft. Myers; they were the class bully in grade school, and all their live
wanted to be cops so they could carry a gun and arrest people. Real
badasses, at least in their own estimation, and they walk around
swaggering under the weight of their own badge and nightstick. Not all
cops are like that, sure, but the ones that are make me sick.

Yep. I never could understand the pathological cultural hatred between
Koreans and Japanese...in Japan there are private investigators who do
nothing but find out if a particular person has any Korean ancestory,
and Japanese who are even vaguely Korean anywhere in their lineage can;
have trouble finding work, a place to live, etc. Stupid shit.Sort of

After reading Turtle's message regarding "tolerance" in BBS interactions
I find that there is very little merit in continuing the little dialogue
we have begun.  Certainly no good will result, unless you consider that
the rest of the users on the board will get a great deal of entertainmen
from reading the posts.  I am not particularly adverse to entertaining 
anybody (dueling is great!) but none of the messages would produce what
I would call /growth/.  One-upmanship is great, but possibly is both
unwanted and unwarranted on the BBS.
  
Turtle ... I concede the point to you and will attempt to be NICE.

But Dave - you have to load something into the break vector before
the interrupt will do anything besides jump to BASIC.  The code you
list loads the accumulator with the character 8 (backspace in the
monitor ROM) and jumps to the COUT routine which will simply move the
cursor back one - assuming that you do 302G and not 3D0G which
bails out to BASIC.  Gee - I really do remember that crap.

I found out later via another cop that this guy considered himself to 
be Sarasota's Dirty Harry. I thought he was gonna wop me when I kicked 
him. Well, he did slam me into the glass counter. But he never said 
the classic "Halt, police officer" line, nor did he flash me a badge 
until I was (face pressed into the counter) and cuffed. Of course by 
then, I'd already figured it out.

You are right about those cops giving "all" cops a bad rep. I saw a 
black woman chased down and cuffed the other day (unfortunatly in my 
neighborhood there are crack dealers closing in). She was kicking and 
clawing and spewing some pretty nasty remarks but the cops were very 
careful not to harm her or let her harm herself in the struggle. 
They never said a bad word (that I could hear) to her, and they weren't 
aware that I was watching. There are good cops out there, I have met
plenty, but no one ever hears about them (unless they are on the "larger
than life" Top Cops program".

T>I could never understand the pathological cultural hatred between
T>Koreans and Japanese...
 
Well, listen to this and see if you can gain some further insight
Korea used to belong to Japan, or more accurately, the Empire of
Japan.  Japan colonized them, destroyed thier culture, and used them
as slaves and servants until the end of WWII, whereupon the Korean 
peninsula was divvied up between the Communist north and the Republican
south. (And then came the Korean conflict.)  Can you draw any 
conclusions?  Or any parallels between white America and black America
(like slavery, for instance)?  Japanese consider Koreans to be no 
better than the average Cracker considers a black to be. 
 
Pathological, to be sure, but culturally rooted.  Which brings me to 
an interesting insult, (in the Korean language), with likewise 
interesting cultural connections.  The insult, literally translated 
reads "Your mother has a bald pussy." -- Culturally translated, it means
"Your mother is a Japanese whore."   The background is that most 
Japanese Gieshas are not allowed to show pubic hair, so most of them
shave that zone.   
 
Wups...well, you get the idea...it's as if a cracker had told another
that the other's mother walked the streets in Harlem.  Get it?

I did, however remember the hex addr to clear the screen...I used it
often.  Remember, all I did with those programs was to put my name in 
them...and convert the tough ones over to Prodos...which insured that
the ones I converted to ProDOS contained my handle: 
 
CRACKED BY THE SPECIALIST 
 
I used to have the entire code in a small file, which I would load
into whatever space I could find available...you know, most of the
games started at 768 ($300) and I could find a JMP from there...I just
stuck in my code before the JMP...or I put it just before the 
address of the JMP and told it to JMP there instead.  The conversion to
ProDOS really messed up a lot of hackers days...but I just switched to 
before $800 (or just after) to make all the 3.3 fit into ProDOS. The 
toughest game to port over was STARBLAZER...took me amost a week to 
fit all the code in...I finally ended up splitting it into segments
and using Sourceror & Merlin Pro....

> Yeah- it supervised the total dissection of Lori's carb...
 
Did I tell you that she got the surging problem fixed? Brought it in to
Subaru, and the techs there told her the carb needed to be rebuilt. When
she explained that that had just been done, they poked a little further
and ended up dismantling the fuel pump and changing the filter inside
the pump. Funny thing about that--her service manual makes no mention of
a fuel filter inside the fuel pump, and doesn't show it on the exploded
view. Grr...

Naah...there has always been that part of the population that is only
amused at the sight of someone slipping and falling on an icy pavement.
Problem is, that part of the population is now in the boardrooms and
stockrooms, pulling the strings, throwing the muscle, and driving the
BMW's...so they're the ones you notice now. Demographics, ya know?

>How can you get anywhere if you don't set some goals?
 
Same way you get anywhere if you DO set goals. We're all heading for the
same place...it's just that some people believe once you're past the
grave nothing can go wrong.
 
>C'mon, you must've set some goals somewhere down the line.
 
Nope.
 
>...flexible enough to change...
 
Indecision is the basis of flexibility. :) I've noticed that the only
truly, fundamentally happy people I know are more concerned with
enjoying life than with setting calendars, and are content to just drift
along and have a good time. On the other hand, I know plenty of people
who know exactly where they are, where they are going, and what they
plan to get along the way--and for the most part they're a bunch of
miserable, pissed-off bastards. As for having money and whatnot--well,
a bird in the hand is worth what it will bring, and you still can't
take it with you...

You still got the CP/M machine? If so, you ought to try running
Z-System on it. Z-System came out as a CP/M replacement about the time
MS-DOS was first hacked out of CP/M 2.2, and they've been developing
divergently since then. Z has a lot of the nice features of MS-DOS
(like named directories, a decent batch file processor, that sort
of thing) and adds things MS-DOS still hasn't caught up with--command
aliasing, extended command processors, a shell stack, a user-supplied
error handler--and a few features you need external programs to get
out of MS-DOS, like command histories and I/O redirection. It also
provides an environment descriptor block, which MS-DOS is supposed to
be adding in version 5, and some other neat things...I bet you'd start
using the Televideo again if you tried it out.

The environment descriptor block (yeah, AmyDS does have one, kinda) is a
description of the computer's hardware and software configuration. It
lets a program know what type of processor it's running on, how much RAM

>I don't know what a VAX and DEC is.
 
DEC is Digital Equipment Corporation, the nation's second-largest
computer manufacturer (right after you-know-who). A VAX is a DEC
mainframe. DEC and IBM are essentially diametrically opposed as
corporations and as computers; IBM tends to make all their machines
incompatible, so if you upgrade from one machine to another you have
to buy all your software again; they make everything proprietary, to
lock third party manufacturers out of the business; they cannot make
a program with fewer than two hundred programmers; they feel that the
best solution to a slow program is to buy a faster computer rather
than optimize the code; they make operating systems that are obtuse
and difficult to use; and they are in general the Nazis of the computer
world. DEC, on the other hand, makes all their equipment compatible
with all their other machines; they support outside companies that
develop stuff for their computers (and even help them market it); they
make operating systems that are famous for their power and simplicity;
they continue to support their machines even after they discontinue
them; and they don't make as much money as IBM.

There was at one time a superstition among American Indians (and some
other people, including Austrailian aboriginies, I believe) that if
you allow yourself to be photographed, your soul is trapped by the
camera and caught on the film--that is how they believed the camera
operates. Since furry parties tend to be documented heavily (lest nobody
believe what went on), if you have such a religious or superstitious
objection to having your likeness recorded photographically you're out
of luck.

>By the way, are you going to post directions to your house for the
>Furry party?
 
Hey, there's an idea! Without further ado:
 
The place is located on US 301 near DeSoto Road (that's where the
airport is). To get there from north (ie, in Bradenton): Travel
south on 301 to DeSoto. Then, keep going south on 301. Half a block from
the DeSoto intersection is a traffic light in front of Shadowood Apart-
ments. Turn in there. If you reach the SuperAmerica on the right-hand
side, you've gone a tad too far; turn around.
 
To get there from south: Go north on 301. Keep going north until you
come to a SuperAmerica on the left-hand side, shortly after you cross
Myrtle. When you reach the SuperAmerica, keep going north about half
a block until you hit a traffic light in front of Shadowood Apart-
ments. Turn in there. If you get to DeSoto, you've gone too far; turn
around.
 
In either case, once you've turned into Shadowoood you will be faced
with a left-or-right situation. You go right. Follow the road around
(it's a big circle) until you find a gray Volkswagen Bug with the engine
sticking out the back and swords on the doors. You'll know it, believe
me. Park your car by the Bug. That'll be in front of Building 12.
On the right-hand side of the building, second in from the end, you'll
find Unit 1895. That's mine. There will probably be a furry party sign
on the door, if it's closed (which, depending on the weather, it
probably won't be.) Nothing to it; it's about as easy as falling off
a log over a pit of snakes with large fangs and bad attitudes, and
on the way down realizing that you forgot your Post-It (tm) fish.

   Certain religions in the world believe that every time someone takes
a photograph of you, a piece of your soul is torn from your body, and
kept with the photograph. Although this is an Eastern belief (help,

it in Mexico.

Grr! They're not the "Pennsylvania dutch." 'Dutch' is a corruption
of 'Deutsch'; many of them were originally (a LONG time ago) of
german ancestry. They are, in fact, Amish.
 
I didn't know they had the same ideas, though.

Okay, you asked for it. The Seven Knots to Heaven is a sexual practice
where a silk cord is knotted in seven places and inserted in the male's
anal orfice. At the moment of climax, the cord is pulled out slowly, one
knot at a time.

SS> Hey, it's good to see you.  Where ya been?
    
   Thanks, Scott! (Or is it Scooter, now?) I've been all around, keeping
freedom safe from democracy, and I've been rapidly forgetting my 
origins on BBS's. Ya see, there was this Communist dictatorship that
wanted to take over the Republica de Platanos (a really small South 
American country), and stole their national monument, the king's 
lymphadicmetamorphic pet rock collection. They demanded a full pardon
of the country's political prisoner, that a more interesting-looking
currency be printed, and that the official language of Platanos be
changed to Swedish. (Government sources indicated that they might be
willing to drop the last demand.) I was flown in to engage in secret
negotiations with the Communists, and wound up only signing over half
the national treaury to them. Not bad, huh?
    
   I'm in a strange mood. And if you don't believe THAT story, you
wouldn't believe the real reasons I didn't call.

   The Seven Knots to Heaven sounds like a way to ruin good silk
cords. For some people (not myself!) I could imagine inserting something
at the point of climax -- but vice-versa sounds extremely strange.
(My uninformed theory is that it caught on because it was rather 
strange.)

I'm not sure about American indians, but i know that eskimoes don't
want their picture taken.  They believe that a picture captures the 
soul of whoever the picture was taken of.  Of course it would be kind
of hard for them to explain how there can be more than one picure of
the same person.

I doubt it. When you are engaged in sexual intercourse, that area
becomes very sensitive; any sort of stimulation can be pleasurable.
I don't really plan to put in an adult area other than the adult
storyboard because (a) I'm not convinced that it would be
used, or that all the "adult" conversation would stay there; and (b)
this entire system is primarily intended for adults, and if people
see things they don't want to see they have the option of either
ignoring it or not calling here. I'm not int he business of policing
people's conversation or seeing to it that nobody sees anything that
might offend them; I'm in the business of running a bulletin board.

A furry party is a party geared mostly toward fans of animation,
funny animals, art, and that sort of thing. A furry party as
practiced in Florida is a very large, very bizzare party that's
noted for the peculiar and inexplicible things that go on at
it and for lasting practically forever. If you REALLY want to see
a furry party in action, I suggest you show up Saturday evening or
some time on Sunday...you'll be amazed, guaranteed.

Okay, I read over the background. A few suggestions:
 
Provide a physical description of the island and the actual place
itself, as well as an overview of the characters who run it (and who
a customer can expect to interact with). Also, a list of the services
the Den normally has available, and what sort of things a customer
might expect there. A good, detailed description of the interior of the
place would be a good thing to have; it makes the setting easier to
imagine (necessary when you have several people sharing the same
setting; everyone ought to have the same view of the building itself!).
 
I would strongly suggest allowing at a /maximum/ two characters per
player; one is usually more successful. This does not apply to you;
as moderator, you will probably be running all the characters who are
actually employees of the place.
 
You might spell out more explicitly (to coin a phrase) the difference
between the public and private access areas of the Den (and the story-
board); presumably, the brothel is not open to the general public,
since the public-access part of the storyboard is not going to be
terribly explicit.
 
A quick rundown on the types of aliens the players might expect to
see, and how common they are, would help. How many species of
"furries" are there, can they all interbreed with humans, what are they
called, and what characteristics (physical and temperment-wise)
do they have?
 
You might (your option) want to require characters to post in first
person; that's up to you.
 
Other than that (whew!) it looks pretty good...whaddya think?

   I've never known Turtles to be soft, though they're often moist.
And, by the way, how DO you know Turtle is delicious, anyway?

important at a Furry Party. With ALL the people there, you have to share
