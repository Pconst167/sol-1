Okay, there is real (good) BBS software which will run on your machine,
but it's not readily available.. mine is.  Heck, there are PD MsDos
BBS's with more features than PBBS, that's one of the main advantages of
running an MS-DOS compatible, you have a readily available LARGE PD and
Shareware base. Telix is a great Comm program, and readily available..
do you have /anything/ which will do everything telix does.. I doubt it,
but of course you like cryptic commands.. (Yuck.. I just read the line

Dear Killashandra,
   Welcome to aLTER rEALITY.... At least, I don't think I've seen
your name before.
   Is Christianity "just another pair of spectacles"? It does its
best to make exclusionist claims ("Thou shalt have no other gods 
before me", "You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of
demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the
table of demons." I Cor 10:21) -- at least in regard to these claims,
Christianity must be 100% correct, or 100% wrong.
   (At least Christianity isn't the only religion that does this.)
   Examine its other claims: that its workers performed miracles, and
that its Founder rose from the dead. Again, this is fairly common among
religions.
     
   What's different about Christianity is that the claims were made of
a person who allegedly lived at the same time as the people who wrote
the book: in at least the case of one of the Gospels, it was claimed
that only about twenty years ago did Jesus rise from the dead. There
were people still around who had known Jesus well, and could have
verified it. Why might have Mark written such a thing? Do you feel
it was pure fiction?

  Do game-theoretic terms provide a sufficient reason for believing
in God? Well, to be a complete pragmatist, yes.
    Think about the eternal results of believing: either nothingness
or salvation. Think about the eternal results of not believing:
either nothingness or damnation. Nothing personal, but salvation
(even boring salvation!) seems a lot better to me than damnation.

Dear the Yngling,
   This past summer, I worked for Atencion San Miguel, a mostly-
English language newspaper in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. One of
my co-workers told me about a Bible study going on Tuesday nights at
her house, lead by "Pastor Bill," a person who I had heard about before.
Intrigued, I went.
   Quite unlike the New College Bible studies I was used to, Pastor
Bill used his studies as a kind of a pulpit: to preach his version of
the Word. But he was an extremely charismatic man, and was quickly
building a following -- and I agreed with what he said, mostly. That
week, he mentioned that he had managed to rent a large room at a local
hotel (the meeting room) for every Sunday morning for the next few
months, and that the Sunday church would be meeting there from now
on. I went ahead and went.
   At first, Pastor Bill seemed to be an excellent preacher. He knew
the Bible well, and he could explain his ideas extremely clearly.
I started inviting people to come, myself, and talked with many of
his younger followers.
   About the third week I was there, he started making a few assumptions
within his speeches that I didn't like. (He accidentally let drop
that he was an Episcopal -- but no longer.) About the second time
this happened, after Church when most people had left, I asked him
how he interpreted certain Bible verses that seemed to go opposite to
what he was saying. (For those who are interested, he was preaching
that Christians do not have a sure salvation; that any sin can 
separate you from God, and once you are separated, you cannot return
to God's fold.) What got to me was that no one else seemed to notice
anything was wrong.
   After that, every week after Church, I asked him how he explained
certain Bible verses which contradicted his sermon. About the fifth
week, someone had found out about our talks, and a few started sticking
around for them. By my seventh week, about half the church did.

<continuing with the story>
   By then, people started switching their alliegences away from
Bill. The problem was, most of them didn't know enough of God's Word
to successfully challenge him... and at least two asked me to present
their problems to Bill. (I refused.) Also, Bill had been a popular
person to explain personal problems to: by the end of the summer,
a third of them were coming to me. Pastor Bill was not pleased.
       
   Ever since Pastor Bill, I've been extremely suspicious of larger
churches, especially those based on the personality of the pastor.
(The charismatic churches...) Too many people knew how to be sheep --
and only how to be sheep. When their first shepherd didn't seem to
be all that great, they followed a second shepherd. 
   There was never a true "schism" -- but Pastor Bill lost a lot of
respect (not to mention some of his congregation.) Although I haven't
talked with any of the members since, I hope I've taught them to
think for themselves -- espectially in religion.

   Unfortunately, nature has given us NONE of those rights. Not even

Hope you're still listening. Been too busy to get to the modem but have 
been thinking ...
Okay, this time I wrote down some of the comments so I could remember 
what to answer. Is there a way to print this stuff out or put it on disk
to think about later?
I notice you call Adonai "he". At first I balked at this, but I do belie
believe that this may be appropriate. I would agree with the concept of
a god separate from life/time/space as patriarchal male concept. On the
other hand, the concept of the whole of creation as not so much a diety
but as a fully interacting, active Be-ing does correspond more to the
this-dimensional image of the goddess (as opposed to a goddess). Womyn
as we know us in humanity create within and about us at the same time.
Her name is (among others) Gaia.
Actually, this opens the relevance of other dimensions discussion. I
believe it is because we see ourselves as limited only to this two or
three dimensional physical dimension that we find ourselves contained in
such absurdities as dualities, dichotimies, polarities. It is like the
definition of good and evil -- these are two patriarchal constructs that
we see only from our perspective. If what we think of as good is see fro
from another perspective, then it is no longer good. It may not be evil
either. It may be neutral. It may be dangerous, exciting, daring, fun,
boring. There are dozens of other sprialing paths that lead off the 
linear division of good an evil. But as long as we limit ourselves to
the physical dimesion and accept only what these simple six senses tell
us, then we are forcing ourselves into a viewpoint that maintains and
reinforces these dualities in life. When we begin to accept, for example
the dream dimension as reality, we expand our consciousness. What if the
dream dimension, which most of us visit regularly, is true reality and
daily life is artificial? What if there is more?
I don't know how to end this, so I'll try stopping her and starting a ne
message.

Well, hope this worked.
As for the spark of the universe giving so much more to certain entities
I again have to say that it is only your perspective that sees humanity,
and banana plants as having more spark than rocks or earth. I am coming
to believe the earth, for example, is a living, breathing entity as much
as we are. She constantly gives birth, evolves, revolves and is being
attacked by her offspring in human form, mostly in patriarchal
limitation. Ask any gemstone advocate about the energy and power of
certain rocks and stones. I have no personal experience with moondust,
but I feel certain those scientists in labs are still trying to prove
their own alleged objectivity and have no idea of the potential that
may lie in real moondust. Maybe it is even part of the mother earth
that survived when someshow separated and spun into the universe. Of
course, I, too, am cursed with having grown up in patriarchal 
perspective so I see a separate moon where there may be no division at
all. I believe I am only now opening my mind/senses to perceive without
some of these limitations.
Mary Daly is a feminist philosopher at Boston College. You may like her
first book, The Church and the Second Sex, however, this is no longer tr
true to her theory. The second one, Beyond God the Father Toward a
Philosophy of Women's Liberation, steps off the cliff of patriarchy 
into New Feminist Time/Space. Several others follow including Wickedary,
Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism and Pure Lust: Elemental
Feminist Philosophy. I have yet to read them all, since each one takes
a lot of time and study to grasp the concepts. Most of them are
published through Beacon Press, a Unitarian Universalist related
publishing company.
One of her most exciting concepts to me (at the moment) is the idea of
taking whatever the patriarchy tells you is reality, seeing it, then
turning it upside down and that is what reality really is.
Guess that's all for now. Really.

> There are PD MS-DOS BBS's with more features than PBBS...
 
But most of them are dippy.  I'm not really sure why, mind you, but a
lot of them are like WWIV--a lot of features, but even more "hardwired"
about things than PBBS is, i.e., even the menu text files are stored
internally.
    Turtle & I have two other Trash-80 BBS's with more features than
PBBS -- TCL2 and ERACS.  TCL2 is completely hardwired and is, well,
dippy (even more so than the MS-DOS ones I was talking about).  ERACS
is extremely powerful and very flexible, but is so much of a pain in the
ass I wouldn't go near it unless paid considerable sums of money.  It
literally rewrites the DOS so when you log on to it, you're really
logging on to the oomputer the same way you'd log onto a mainframe.  It
adds things like a programmable menu system, carrier check, and wheel
protection to TRSDOS; effectively, every command on an ERACS menu would
be a "door" to other BBS programs, including the subsystems for messages
and file transfers.  It's a really clever setup, but once you install
it IT WON'T GO AWAY because it's made itself an integral part of your
operating system.  Also, the message system, while it allows for 99
different conferences, has an EVEN STUPIDER EDITOR THAN PBBS DOES,
something you wouldn't think was humanly possible until you used it.  It
is literally so difficult to use than an average BBS-goer could not make
it save a message.

That doesn't necessarily follow. It is possible that Christianity has
the correct idea but a distorted view of god, so that the god which is
worshipped by Christians is the same as that worshipped by practioners
of another religion, and the distortion prevents Christians from
recognizing that fact. Also, the Bible does not make as strong a
claim to exclucivity as people would like to have it make--Jesus said
"no man comes to the Father except by me," but he didn't say "...and
there's only one way to do that." A religion which meets that
qualification in a manner which is not recognizably Christian may still
have validity from god's point of view--unlike many Christians, /I/ for
one would not assume god's ability to pass judgement on man. And didn't
Jesus himself speak of preaching to "different flocks"...??

about half of that list are things that are VERY liberal in their 
interpretation.  If anything each year that passes stamps the book
ever more firmly as FACT not fiction.  The only parts left open
to "belief" are the assertions that it was directed by a omniscient
being, that he created us and this universe, and that this is his
record of his dealings with us and his plan for us.  As far as the
probelm of evil - NEVER has it been so exquisitly stated as in the
book of Job - the Bible does not attempt to evade any issues - it does
give food for MEDITATIVE thought - if you go looking for a blueprint
for life & happiness then life in general will disappoint you as well

C'mon Chip - be CORRECT - not sensationalistic!  Ananias (& his wife)
were killed because they LIED about how much they gave when they
didn't have to.  Nobody was "keeping track" of whom gave how much
but they were deliberately trying to appear "holier than thou" by
giving only a small portion of the proceeds of the sale of their
property and claiming to have given it all.  According to the beliefs
of the early Christians all was owed to God as it came from God it was
a very early community effort at raising funds to survive in what had
become a very hostile land that prompted the land sale.  To "hold out"
and claim the benefits of their "sacrifice" was an outright insult to
God himself and all the others that had given all they had to the 
early Church.  It may seem extreme to us as far as punishment but -
we are judging by our values which is arrogant to an extreme to assert
that we are correct and other value systems are wrong.

Hello. I've seen the male and female qualities references. I'm thinking 
this is because they co-opted Yawaeh from the Goddess concept, making
him a god of power and domininion. According to Diane Stein,
a writer, the Hebrew god was a woman, traced as Iahu-Anat by Elizabeth
Gould Davis (who, by the way, was a librarian at Selby before she died.)
During patriarchal takeover, the Jewish Yahweh was also once the hunter
god-consort of Anat, known as Baal. Anyway, eventually you know the stor
y.

Ah ha!  You found the magic boner in PBBS!  Backslash characters signify
end-of-line to the message printing routine.  Yes, it /is/ kind of
annoying.  It apparently has something to do with the way Microsoft
FORTRAN compilers work (that being the language PBBS is written in.)
   Incidentally, that's why there were never any backslashes in the
intro screens here or on Wyvern's Den, even in places where you'd think
they'd make sense....

Kinda sorta.  Other systems would have their own separate userlog,
making people log on twice, wouldn't respect any of ERAC's own system
variables and probably wouldn't let people get back to ERACS /or/ exit
to ERACS when they logged off, since in a non-ERACS environment that
would mean plopping them onto the DOS prompt.  Also, most BBS's have
their own modem I/O drivers in them which could interfere with ERACS'
drivers.  You'd still need to do some hefty modification to make an
existing BBS run under ERACS, and without source code, it would make
all the PBBSH modifications to date seem trivial.

Pity the "religion causes wars" thing disappointed you--I was simply
using that to counter Chip's "but see all the good Christianity has
done!" I think it's a mistake to assume that religion per se does not
lead to all sorts of strife; /any/ self-replicating belief system is
going eventually to be responsible for a good deal of uncivility, Human
nature being what it is. Here's the problem:
#define Belief_System $foo;
Begin
  S1: People who do not believe in $foo will burn in hell;
  S2: It is your duty to prevent suffering;
  S3 ... Sn;
End
 
A correlary of S1 and S2 is that in order to prevent suffering, it is
your obligation to make people accept $foo, regardless of the cost
(after all, isn't it worth a little awkwardness now if you can prevent
everlasting torment?) Another correlary is that if someone refuses to
accept $foo, then it doesn't really matter what you do to him; after
all, he's damned anywat, right? (Both these lines of reasoning were
very popular during the middle ages, in fact.) Another problem arises
when two incompatible belief systems, $foo and $bar (Christianity and
Islam, say) have S1 and S2 in common but differ in statements 3 to
n...because each side will feel obligated to spread the Word, whatever
trhe cost, and both sides will soon start feeling very frustrated...and
angry...and...well, bad things happen. It's not really accurate to say
"Christianity causes problems when greedy people try to use it to get
[whatever];" exclusive belief systems can intrinsically cause conflict,
even if the statements contained in those belief systems instruct its
adherents to be nice to other people.

I'd feel very uncomfortable trying to defend the premiss that the Hebrew
god was a variant on the Goddess, simply because the Hebrew religion is
a desert religion that arose almost completely in isolation and did not
start to incorporate the ideas of Wicca and other Celtic pagan beliefs
until /after/ it had started spreading throughout Europe, at about the
time of the death of Christ. The New Testament contains several ideas
that are clearly taken from the animistic pagan religions popular in
Europe during the first century or so AD, but going back farther than
that we see a more old-style war-god conception of the Hebrew diety
that's fairly typical of desert religions in general (as an interesting
side note, why is it that harsh climates invariably breed monotheistic
religions and more temperate climates breed polytheistic and animistic
belief systems?). Trying to forcibly interpret the Old Testament in
terms of goddess worship is at best naive (and looking back, I see I've
manages to split an infinitive in this sentence, too...*sigh*).

Well, in a nutshell, the reasons I don't like IBM clones are:
* They're generally poorly designed, and their bus architecture is
  a nightmare;
* They're slower than they have any right to be;
* They are built around mediocre IAPX86-family microprocessors;
* Their operating system, an obnoxious CP/M hack, was primitive by 1984
  standards and is still klunky, awkward, and underpowered even four
  versions later;
* IBM applications programs generally require obscene amounts of free
  memory to perform even the simplest of tasks;
* They are victims not only of poor design but in many ways of poor
  /conception/--lacking the features found even in modern 8-bit
  systems;
* They're overpriced (although peripherals for them are, thankfully,
  dirt-cheap);
* They are only minimally functional for any sort of sophisticated I/O;
* A great deal of IBM software, even commercial $500 software packages,
  is sooo klunky and awkward it's hard to imagine that anyone is even
  reluctantly willing to put up with it;
* The systems in both software and hardware are relatively inflexible,
  again even from modern 8-bit machine's standpoints;
* They are riddled with a staggering number of kludges, hacks, and
  misfeatures that nobody seems willing to rectify.
Other than that, I don't have any /real/ problems with IBM-type
machines; get rid of some of those problems and you'd be left with
a workable, if somewhat mediocre, computer. (If you'd like me to
elaborate on any or all of the above, I'd be more than happy to,
although it might end up getting me crucified...:) )

Dear Delphi,
   Forgive me for calling Adonai "he." Unfortunately, there is no
pronoun in English for gender-neutral people (or hermaphroditic people.)
Adonai is, of course, beyond gender -- and it was inaccurate for me to
call the Divine One "He."
    Also, I agree with the feminist concept of continuums, not
dualities -- for some dualities. Simplistically, there are "goods"
which are "greater goods" than others, and there are "evils" that
are "lesser evils" than others. (I don't believe in breaking all
dualities into lesser and greater.) 
   However, I do not see how having a God (or Goddess) separate from
time and space is necessarily logically related to a patriarchal view
of the world. I will grant that in many cases, having one belief
correlates to having the other. But I don't see how it follows that
one implies the other.
   Covering more ground, again, I don't see how our limitations to
three dimensions or five (six? confusing.) senses necessarily means
that we will observe polarities. I believe it has more to do with
ancient lawmakers deciding what was "right" and what was "wrong" --
and this beig simplified over the ages. Laws have always supported a
limited form of continuums: one doesn't kill another for stealing a
nickel.
   Why do I believe that this is reality, and not the dream plane?
Continuousness. Although every time when I wake up here, it is always
the same, there is no continuousness to my dreams. What I remember are
disjoint views of entirely different, unconnected worlds. (Of course,
no assumptions can be made about "what is reality?" Reality is what it
is -- regardless of reason.)
   Is the Earth a living, breathing entity? Is the Earth alive?
for me, one of the definitions of life is that it attempts to change
its surroundings for its own, personal good. (Patriarchal? Probably.)

Plants attempt to draw nutrients from the soil, and some use poison
to discourage competition from other plants. Ants have fantastic
communication networks to build their hives. Conservationists try to
save the planet, that it might be livable in the future. However, I
have never observed a rock -- or a crystal -- attempting to better its
own surroundings.
   Is there power in crystals? I won't touch that one. Is Gaia of the
state where she doesn't need to better her surroundings? Nor will I
touch that -- but as a good mother, I would expect the Goddess to
reproach her human children rather severely.
   My roomate, who is a feminist, has the book Beyond God the Father --
as soon as I have the chance, I will read it.

Dear Turtle,
   Either the God described by the Bible is 100% correct -- or it
is not. If it is not perfectly correct, then those claims are false.
I'll freely admit that it might be that the "actual" god (the Big
Fellah in the Sky) might be a bit off (he/she/it/they might have a
flowing red beard instead of a white one) -- but even the slightest
change would make those claims of exclusiveness WRONG.
   Yes, Jesus did speak about "different flocks" -- but, in context,
it seemed that he was talking about preaching to the non-Jews. (This
was a radical idea for the time...) Not that of creating many other
religions.
   Can there be a religion that is not recognizably Christian, but
would qualify under God's eyes? I don't know -- I'm not God. What I
do know is that, within a very few guidelines, there is an incredible
diversity of what could be called recognizably Christian.

   Are you assuming that "liberal" means "wrong"?

the Earth was created in six days -- like Genesis 1 says? 
     
   Does the Bible contradict itself? Let's examine the first contra-
diction in the Bible: Genesis 1 and 2. In Genesis 1, man and woman were
both created on the sixth day, the last beings to be created.
(Gen. 1:24-27). In Genesis 2, it seems to say that man was created
before woman ("When the Lord God made the earth and the heavens -- and
no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of
the field had yet sprung up...the Lord God formed the man from the
dust of the ground and breated into his nostrils the breath of life")
BEFORE He created the plants.

   One of the most amazing things in San Miguel is the cathedral in
the center of town. A Mexican had seen a picture postcard of a Gothic
cathedral, and he thought it would be a Really Neat Idea to have one
in his town. Unschooled in architecture, he drew the plans for a
cathedral... and he knew enough rich people in town to have it
built.
   The first miracle was that it stood. The second is that it's
existed for so long. (It's now over 100 years old.) It's still exactly

It took a lot more than 'spoon-fed' religion(sp?) to make me feel the 
way I do. It took almost being put in jail to realize who I had been 
worshiping all these years. I found that you can either serve God or
Satan, one or the other, not both and not neither. A 'Non-Worship'
state of mind is a crock of sh*t. you are just letting Satan control
of your life.

I don't understand the command line philosophy.. simply have menus..
THAT YOU CAN INTERRUPT.. It's a little more difficult to write than 
opus or PCboard style command stacking, but it's worth it! You can do
very self explanetory menus, and simply let people go wherever they want
more quickly than Opus with /no/ menus. I think it's probably been a 
month or two since I saw all of one of Frank's menu's on The Cutting 
Board.. he kept the commands intuitive, and made the structure logical..
how hard is that? (Well, you say.. /your/ board isn't consistent.) My
board isn't consistent because I haven't gotten around to fixing that
yet.  Anyway.. I like Hotkey menus... AND completely programmable menus.

How about abuse from other sysops?  Zilog still sells more of their Z80
8-bit family chips (Z80A/B/H, Z84C00/01, Z180 and the Z8 dedicated
controllers) than all of Intel's chips put together, from their 8-bit
8088's to the 32-bit 386/486 beasts.  8-bit is only truly "obsolete" if
you're a power user... a Z180 or HD64180 (the Hitachi equivalent, and
the sucker the Wyvern's Den ran on) can run at 9 MHz and address 512K,
and has two 38400 bps serial ports, a two-stage timer and a two-channel
DMA controller on chip.  Even its 6 MHz version runs rings around most
286 systems when it comes to actually doing anything useful (as opposed
to benchmarks testing how fast the CPU can count backwards from 32768 by
4's).  It all depends on	 what you want to do; if not being compatible
with "industry standard software" doesn't bother you, then there's no
reason to go MS-DOS.
   I have come to peace with MS-DOS systems; for a lot of things, they'd
be cost-effective.  But on the whole, if I was going to get a 16-bit
(or 32-bit) system, I'd get an Amiga or--yes--a Macintosh IIcx first.
I'd want a computer that could do things my 8-bit system /can't/ do,
not just one that can do the same things a little faster or do it a
little slower with Brand Name Software.

Actually, hotkey menus are considerably /less/ difficult to program than
a true command stack.  PBBS may not have them because the development
language Pat McDonald, the original author, chose was (inexplicably)
FORTRAN, and FORTRAN doesn't really deal with characters very well at
all.
    I like hotkeys, although they can be fairly dangerous beasts if
you're not careful in setting them up (like PBBS's goodbye without
confirm routine).
    As Turtle just reminded me, ERACS doesn't use command stacking per
se, it uses /commands/, i.e., the same way a DOS prompt does.  The
commands are, in fact, commands to its parser and are usually translated
to DOS commands or passed to LS-DOS directly.  When you log onto an
ERACS system, you're literally logging onto the remote computer, in the
same way you'd be logging onto a remote Unix system.

>Is there power in crystals? I won't touch that one.
 
Chip, Chip, Chip. Of /course/ there is power in crystals; properly
cut, they are electrically resonant at very narrow frequencies,
and are therefore good for making precision oscillators. Of course,
if by "power" you mean "the ability to heal people and make everything
wonderful forever," well, if a 36.271828KHz sine wave can heal people
and make everything wonderful forever, sure. Just wearing a crystal
around your neck isn't gonna do it, though; it's kinda like a primitive
tribesman wearing a piece of a field containment generator around his
neck because such devices have power.

You realize, of course, that that argument is totally invalid if the
person you're talking to doesn't buy into your cosmology to begin with.
How do you know that Islam isn't the true religion of God, and that
by being a Christian you are blindly following a false religion created
by Satan? For that matter, how do you know that your conception of God
and Satan are valid to begin with? (For your information, most modern
Christian theologians have pretty much dismissed the idea that such
an entity as Satan even exists...)

Well, here I am, back from another day of work, which in my case means
working a drive-through at a McDonalds and dealing with people who
can't figure out:
 
I.  Yes, you have to stop at the speaker to place an order.
    A. It's the little stand with the "STOP  Place Order Here" sign
    B. Yes, you have to stop NEXT to it.
    C. No, I won't know you're there if you miss by even a couple
       dozen yards.
II. No, we don't have hot dogs.
    A. McDonald's has /never/ sold hot dogs.
       1. No, we don't advertise them on TV, either.
    B. Wendy's has hot dogs.
       1. No, this isn't Wendy's.
          a. That's why the menu says "McDonsld's."
III. If you want an order of french fries, you need to specify what
     /size/ an order you'd like.
    A. We have three.
       1. They're "large," "medium," and "small."
       2. The cheapest ones are the "small." Then comes "meduim," then
          "large."
    B. Yes, that also goes for drinks.
IV. Yes, our Big Macs are on sale.
    A. That's why the center of the menu is dominated by the "Big Macs
       99 cents" sign.
       1. It's similar to the huge sign in the front of the store.
       2. Yes, they're on sale for 99 cents.
    B. No, our quarter pounders aren't also on sale.
       1. They're not Big Macs.
       2, No, they aren't "close enough."
V. Ordering a Happy Meal is more involved than saying "I wanna Happy
   Meal."
    A. We have three kinds.
       1. They're listed on the big picture on the menu board.
          a. Yes, we have all three kinds.
          b. No, they're not the same thing.
          c. No, I can't read your mind.
    B. They come with a drink.
       1. Yes, you get to pick which drink.
          a. Are you /sure/ you want coffee with that??
          b. Okay...
       2. Yes, the drink is included in the price.
          a. That's why the picture says "Purchase price includes drink"
          b. Oh look, it says the same thing on the box!

        3. No, we don't have Mr. Pibb either.
           a. That's because we have Coke, Diet, Sprite, and Orange.
              i. Yes, that means no Pepsi.
              ii. You got it--no Mountain Dew, either.
           b. I don't care /what/ Burger King has!
     B. No, you can't "forget it and get a beer."
VIII. Now that you've placed your order, you need to drive up to the
      window to pay for it.
     A. Yes, that means you have to move.
        1. Foot off brake
        2. Foot on accelerator
           a. Not too hard, now...
           b. Mind that curve!
              i. Yes, you /do/ have to go around the curve.
     B. No, I won't walk out there and give you the order.
 
Honestly, the thought that these people, who are honestly and truly
incapable of placing an order at McDonald's, have the right to vote
in national elections terrifies me.

doesn't seem particularly advantageous.. if you want let people do raw

current BBS systems is the message handling.. you should try Magpie..
Sota's new BBS, it seems to address some of the problems, of course they
managed to make file handling clunky as hell, but nothings perfect.

Sure.. but I still don't quite see the reason not to have interruptible
menus.. on my own system, it would annoy me, however when I'm callihg
another system long distance, it's always nice to have exactly what I 
can and can't do spelled out for me. Of course I don't want to /have/ to
wait for the menus.. that's why I like interruptable menus w/ hotkeys.

It depends on	 how it's set up.  I've seen some RCP/M systems set up
pretty nicely, especially remote Z-System type ones -- the file system
can be set up as a point-and-shoot menu where you tag the files you
want on-screen and download them all with YMODEM Batch or ZMODEM.
   The only drawback (assuming you've got it set up so people can't type
ERA *.*, which would be a serious drawback indeed) is that it won't
directly store a long description of the file in the directory; there's
usually a separate text file called FOR.TXT or something like that which
lists all of them, or you can type "FOR Q_264.ZIP" and get the system
to respond with an appropriate description like "It's QuickBBS 2.64,
bozo, what do you think?".  This really doesn't make things any more
difficult when it comes right down to it, but I suspect it would still
be beyond a dismaying number of users.

The only problem with hotkeys is line noise, or pressing the wrong key

Dear Mr. Sauron,
   Your remark was ENTIRELY out of place. Not only did it show extreme
lack of interest in the general conversation, it had nothing 
whatsoever to do with my message.
   First of all, there were no Biblical quotes in message #4272. The
only Biblical quote that I gave recently was to contradict the
"normal" stance of the Church against abortion: I found a verse which
supported the right to abortion.
   Secondly, most of my messages previous to that one have been
showing the faults of Christianity. This is directly OPPOSITE to
the idea of evangelism.
       
   There has been a lively discussion about religious topics in
general on this board, with everyone taking different viewpoints.
I see not a single reason why religion shouldn't be discussed on
an open BBS. If you don't like it, please skip over any messages
that have to do with religion.
   One question: what, precisely gives you the right to say which
topics should and should not be discussed on an "open" BBS?

Yes. Of course. Saying there's a correlation between shoe size and
how well one does on a certain test might be completely true -- but
misleading. (The younger one is, the smaller the shoes... and usually
smaller shoes are only worn by much younger people.)
       
    You're trying to prove the statement: Christianity is responsible
for the world's woes. You say that Europe has been the dominant area
of the planet for 300 years, and Europe is predominantly Christian.
Okay -- now, two questions: Is Europe really "messing up" the world --
or was the world messed up to begin with -- and Europe only slightly
modified the chaos? Secondly, even if Europe is the sole cause of
the chaos in the world, must it be Europe's RELIGION that causes it
to screw up the world?
      
    You've got one hell of a lot left to prove.

    Bad, bad philosophy. Several questions for you to mull over:
      1. If God is omniscient and omnipotent, why did God create Satan
         in the first place? Adonai must have known how Satan would
         fall.
      2. If God is all-good, how could the Lord have created a being
         that could have fallen? (Please: don't resond simply with
         "free will." Couldn't God have created Satan with free will --
         but still have not fallen?)
      3. Why did God allow -- first Satan, then Humanity -- to fall? Why
         did God WANT to make the redemption plan? Why didn't God
         simply create Humanity so that it would not fall into sin?
      
   These questions have been mulled over since the Middle Ages...

>It is not our place to question, but to obey.
       
Oh, no... This is precisely what I've been fighting within the Christian
Church for the past three years. Do you realize the effects of that
philosophy?
      
   I'm speaking to you as a brother in Christ, here. I'm not attacking
you. The ONLY person you should obey is Christ, and Christ alone. I've
seen too many people who espouse that philosophy be completely taken.
(Re-read my message about Pastor Bill.) Too many people gladly take
your money, time, or efforts "in the name of God" -- and then abuse
your trust. I instinctively mistrust anyone who claims to be doing
something "in the will of God" -- and then immediately asks me for
something.
   God commands us to question every spirit to see if it's from God.
(Sauron, please abort this message, now. I might begin quoting from 
the Bible.) Throughout the Old Testament, people asked the messengers
from God for a sign to show they're from God. As good Christians, we
must constantly question our pastor's teaching to see if it's 
completely from the Word of God. Blind acceptance will not do.
   Complete obediance to God is wonderful. Be sure that it's not
someone else's ego trip that you're really following.

Dear Turtle,
   What if I said that there have been studies that show that people
wearing crystals tend to become sick less than people who don't?
(Actually, there probably are such studies -- but I'm making this up
off the top of my head. I wouldn't be surprised if it's true.)
   Of course there's no "power" within crystals that would automatically
bestow health, clear thinking, or increased sexual potency to a person.
But, psychosomatic effects are REALLY strong -- and they make finding
medicines difficult. If wearing a crystal around one's neck makes a
person feel healthier, or feel like one has a clearer mind -- then the
effect is probably real. But it's due to the belief -- and that's the
true power of the crystal.

P.S. I use such things myself. When I have an upset stomach, I generally

tea is really wonderful for stomach problems. I tried it, had enough

In LU-BBS, type a question mark. It is immediately intercepted (you

(or parameters if you've already typed a command). If you have
typed part of a commmand, it will give a list of all the commands
that match what you've typed so far, as in:
 
@L? Command, one of the following:
   Login       Logout     Length     List

Trying to interpret the Old Testament into goddess worship isn't my
point, because I believe it was the written enforcement of patriarchy.
But goddess worship far predates all other religion. To quote Diane 
Stein in "The Women's Spirituality Book", "...evidence of anthropologist
and archeologists indicates that pre-god (goddess) civilizations were
both matriarchal and peaceful, and structured far different from today's
world. No evidence of human strife or violence has been found in any of
the ancient cities of the Near East until late in the third millenium,
when patriarchal nomads first invaded. Not restricted to the Near East,
the so-called "cradle of civilization," the Golden Age triad of goddess
worship, matriarchy and peace extended to Egypt, the Greco-Roman world,
Crete, Persia, Britain and Ireland, and to Africa.
It isn't that the war-god of the Hebrew tribes was female, but that he
originated in Baal, the hunter god-consort of the first Hebrew god,
Iahu-Anat or Ashtoreth. She was the great mother, who gained a male
consort that grew and overtook her as patriarchy took root.
Perhaps your desert theory comes not from the location but the lifestyle
of the people, since goddess times were gatherers and agricultural and
tribal. I can't remember the rest of what you said and it doesn't show
on my screen any longer.

Wow. This stuff is getting so long I can't read fast enough to remember
what we're saying sometimes. Anyway, here goes an attempt at an answer.
I wouldn't agree that (what did you say? life? means attempting to
better one's surroundings. Gaia would accept life as an active process,
I suppose, embracing things as they are as well as change. Who's to say
if a rock's surroundings are better because it doesn't attempt to change
them than if it would? Who's to say anything's wrong for a rock? For me,
I do see the need for some change but would feel myself becoming too
(are you ready for this one?) codependent if I tried to change things
to make them better for someone else. Now this is hard to resist, becaus
even feminists think we know what's good for you. I would say change is
necessary in a social system where we strive for equality, for the 
worth and dignity of every person. That sure isn't the case today.
But other things -- things that don't seriously impact others -- must
be given to the basic right of each individual.
This stuff isn't well thought through, as you can tell. I will be
anxious to hear your opinion of active Be-Ing as defined by Mary
Daly. Maybe I'll be more clear then, because I'm enjoying our
dialog too.

I assume you could also simply cat the file, seeing all available files
(in that area) and the descriptions.. so it ends up almost exacly the 
same as a bbs listing. You could also run the archive program directly
to see what's in the archive.. (to double check the version ect.) 
I've considered writing a Filedoor clone that would allow you to type in
a filespec, and it would give you a list you could narrow it down from,
point-and-shoot will only work for ANSI, and even then it would probably
be a little slow. A nice feature would be to allow a user to maintain a
list of files he want to download as he scrolls through the directory, 
and keep adding to it, waiting to download until he's seen everything.
 Have a hotkey (like Ctrl-A or something) that would pop up you current
list to add or subtract from. I still might implement it in a door, but
the MS-DOS BBS scene is so chaotic now, I'll probably just wait and see
if anybody does anything like it internally.
BTW in case you don't know, but /do/ care: QuickBBS is dying.  USTI 
has bought the code (yes quick was sold yet again) and they're going
to go commercial with a package that has such things as Internal Call
Back Verification.. Whoopeee I bet I'll be reading about bugs in that 
system for the next year.. maybe they'll kill that idea (please?)
However, in addition to Remote Access, about 3 other people are writing
quickbbs clones, so we'll se what happens.

Well - in the middle ages and inquisition and all those other interestin
"christian" times you have to understand that the entire concept of 
christianity and the church was contained in a power mad structure
known to the world as the "holy catholic church".  Some mighty fine 
reading is to be had on the power struggles and political wars within
that establishment, I would just like to point out that they (the PEOPLE
in charge tried to monoploize this structure by making it illegal under
punishment of death to have or read a Bible.  This is because if 
the common man knew the truth the system could never stand.  Witness the
reforms and new stance of the "new" catholic church since MArtin Luther
and the other martyrs dragged the truth out of the papacy and into the
light.
   To my mind it is a testement to the Word of God that people can still
find meaning and belief even though it has been perverted, twisted and
bent for the benefit of a few.

Actually the concept of polytheistic and monotheistic is a bad topic.
In most "polytheistic" religions there is still a head mutha whats in
charge (Zeus, Odin, Yahweh) and in our own "mono"theistic religion we 
teach of a triune godhead and an abundance of supernatural creatures
(cherubim, seraphim, angels).  I am unaware of any desert religions
other than Judaism and Islam (which are the SAME God and derive from 
the same roots so I will count as one) that teach montheism.  I have a
nagging thought about Australia but --- clue me in.
   It is indeed a strain to incorporate almost anything of paganism
into Judaism.  I will not count the fact that many Christian and Jewish
festivals etc fall on traditional pagan holidays - that was simply good
PR and people management for the early Christians that brought their
religion to Europe and the British Isles.

The fact Baal worship -- which followed goddess the original goddess
worship, before he was a god or her consort or even existed -- existed
concurrently with the development of Hebrew religion does not negate
anything I've said. The scholars I read point out that Judiasm was
perhaps the first attempt to destory the peaceful "milk and honey"
existence of the matriarchy that took the form of a new religion. The
purpose of this religion, this power-over rather that power-from-
within, was for males to take dominance in the world, the birth of
patriarchal power structure. It was only by co-opting the goddess
worshiping religions, those that honored each individual and each
living (or inanimate) part of the universe, that they could get
people to give up their ties to goddess worship.
This is not to say Judiaism was the only attempt. It was the most
successful, leading also to Christianity and the worship of a man
as god, which again was acceptable only when Mary was incorporated
as a goddess-style figure.
I realize these premises aren't easily accepted if you've always heard
something else, but there are tremendous discoveries being made in
these areas. When patriarchy wants to hold back information or
alter the truth, it does a forceful job. Only when we refuse to
accept patriarchal concepts as truth or the only reality do we open
our eyes enough to see myriads of possibilities.

If your primary concern is the ability to exchange information with
IBM machines, you'd be better off buying a null modem cable (about
ten dollars) and using your terminal program to zap stuff across at
19,200 baud. It would probably be difficult to justify spending a 
fairly large amount of money for a not-terribly-good computer if
all you're looking for is the capability to get files onto IBM disks,

Your comment about point-and-shoot file transfers/listings/whatever
from a BBS ("...you can only do it if you have ANSI") isn't really
true. RAS Z-nodes are capable of doing point-and-shoot operations
on any terminal or computer that isn't a glass TTY by using remote
TCAPS that are essentially nothing more than descriptors of the
necessary control sequences to move the cursor, clear the screen, or
whatever on the target terminal. When you log into the RAS, you run
a program called TCSELECT that lists all the various terminals it knows
and lets you pick one; if you don't see one you like, you use another
program to tell the host computer what sorts of codes you want sent.
It wouldn't be all that difficult to implement a similar scheme in
the IBM world, by installing the termcap with a DEVICE specification
if you want to set up your BBS as an RCP/M. If you don't need the
ability to shell to DOS from the remote end and don't mind staying
within the BBS program itself, implementation would become trivial.

For some obscure reason that's totally transparant to me, a
number of PC-family computers seem to feel it's necessary to do
an exhaustive memory test (walking bit left, walking bit right, 
bit interleave, etc, etc, etc, etc) every time they're turned on.
Mind you, it isn't any more reliable than a simple write-read-
invert-write-read test, but at least it (a) makes the boot ROMS
longer; (b) takes forever; (c) effectively tests every memory
address about a dozen or so times; and (d) is inherently silly
since most RAM errors are thermal-intermittant and aren't going to
show up when you first turn the *expletive* thing on. IBM: When we
kill something, it *stays* dead (tm).

Censorship is the act of preventing someone from /saying/ something,
not the act of preventing a person from /hearing/ it. If the network
weren't carrying the show, then it would be censorship. Mind you, I
don't subscribe to the philosophy that says parents have the right to
control absolutely and arbitrarily everything thier children are exposed
to, but it's important to get terminology straight.

C.C.A.-
To be honest, I find the fact that someone who recquires a crutch as
enormous as yours to make it through the day and to justify his actions
calling MY life a "crock of shit" to be absurd at best.

P.S.  Ive been in a few jails and none of them were bad enough to make
      me worship the only forgotten Son.  Maybe you should have chosen
      jail.....

Turtle,
   I never thought Id say this, but, this latest message chain with
Mr/Miss C.C.A. re: religion has made me long for those wonderful
discussions about abortion we were having a while back.
   Can anyone, other than Chip, discuss the pro-Christianity side
without falling back on the pablum-dogma crap they were spoon-fed as
children in Sunday school?

                     Satan for many moons without being aware of it -
                     damn, I hate it when that happens!)
