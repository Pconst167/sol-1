RufusCon '91 will be announced well in advance everywhere...BBS's,m
word of mouth, posters, you name it. I can't guarantee a live band
for RufusCon '91; the one that showed up at RufusCon '90 was
totally unexpected. (They just turned up, and I for one didn't know
any of 'em from anywhere. A knock on the door, a bunch of people
standing on the doorstep with large amplifiers, and the rest is
history.) It's open to any sentient being that wants to wander by.
RufusCon '91 likely won't take place until at least mid-summer,
though...
 
Suncoast City Joint Monthly Indoor Picnicks are usually posted a week
in advance on this system; they generally happen about the first
Saturday of the month.

Bad role models abound; I7d say that has little to do with the
family a person comes from. Sure, a person raised in a close-knit
family may be a little more discriminating, but not necessarily.
A loving family is no guarantee of a healthy adult, and a
"dysfunctional" (what a staggeringly meaningless word) family does not
always produce "dysfunctional" adults. Insecurity comes from many
places and in many forms, and I'm hard put to think of any single
bigger factor in a troubled relationship.

lizard brain handle the situation--the limbic system approach to
interpersonal management, if you will. And now I find out that not

You forgot erotic love, which was one of the four Greek classifications.
Personally, I always found the Greek system stiflingly arbitrary and
somewhat incomplete. It makes no provision, for example, for love
for one's self, which is a very different animal from the ones you
named, and it doesn't really distinguish between different types of
"love from afar" (love of all mankind is a very different animal from
love for one's flag or love of one's personal diety). I tend toward
the view that there are at least as many different types of love as
there are people.

KO>Coming from a dysfunctional family can be a source of strength.
JB> Coming from a dysfunctional family is a life-crippling event and 
should be treated as such. You may not even aware of all the mental
damage that you have sustained.
 
The reason that I made the statement about strength is because of many 
reasons.
I got my strength from my mother who is very strong emotionally
despite the 17 years of horror that she lived. My sister has also been 
very strong. 
1a) If you have a network of people around you that can help you during 
the bad times, you're very fortunate
2)Despite the gravity of the subject, a sense of humor helps greatly.
 
3)The possibility ALWAYS exists that the alcoholic will get help. I 
left when I was 17, and my father quit 4 years later. I often feel that 
I should have stayed at home.
 
As for the emotional damage, yes I'm aware of it, and I'm seeking help 
for it.

Being new to this BBS, I just thought I'd drop a little note here to 
let y'all know I'm here.  After having read the messages on the board,
I find a large number of "enlightened" individuals.  Having had my 
horizons expanded for a considerable number of years, I may have
something of interest to add to the ongoing topics of conversation.
I think the "homophobe" or whoever he is is entertaining.  I wonder
if this guy advocates personal freedom of choice or would take away
the rights of others to suit his own preferences.  I further wonder
what sort of upbringing and environmental stimuli would produce such
an outspoken individual.
  
To Saavik:  I like your messages (I'll bet you have "smiling eyes").
 
To Turtle:  Glad to be aboard and I appreciate the time and $$ you 
            spend to provide this service.  This does not mean that
            I will agree with all your views.
  
To all others:  Pick a topic, any topic, I have a "collective" opinion
                on just about anything.  If I can't formulate one, the
                topic is probably beneath me.

Non-rational means just that. I was making the observation that
rationality is generally a good way to approach a relationship, and you
said that since you don't always know what's going on in the other
person's head you sometimes have to rely on intuition instead. But
if your intuition improves with experience, obviously intuition is not
non-rational...

Yes, those things can be applied to the golden rule, but not directly;
you can logically argue that any action not directly related to other
people is not covered by that rule. Also, the G.R. has /nothing/ to
say about any action which does not relate directly or incidentally to
the way you interact with others, where the Wiccan version does.

I don't reject the Golden Rule; I think it's good advice for governing
interactions between people. I just don't think it's sufficient. I
don't reject anything in the Bible just because it's from the Bible;
in fact, most of the Ten Commandments are pretty good guidelines, too.
The Bible is somewhat useful as a history text, if you treat it as
folk histor and not as gospel truth (sorry 'bout the pun); it's
got some merit as a work of social morality; I just happen to think its
description of the way the universe works is bunk. Burning bushes...
I don't think so.

My point was not that I believe the Kuwaitis should live under a
democracy, or that they should adopt our Constitution, or what-have-
you. My point was that I cannot with clear conscience fight a war to
support a government that murders its own people. I believe that that
sort of behavior is morally wrong, period. I am surprised and disturbed
by your claim that the Emir is legitimate because he hasn't been tossed
out of power yet; does that mean you support any government, no matter
how brutal, that has managed to cling to power for X amount of
time?
 
What I would like to see in Kuwait is not an American government, or
an Iraqui government, but a government set up by the Kuwaitis--ALL of
the Kuwaitis. The way Kuwait is structured now, women have no say (and
in fact under certain circumstances can be BOUGHT and SOLD, for god's
sake!); non-Kuwaitis have no say, even if they've lived there all their
life, even if they've become Kuwaiti nationals; and people without
a certain economic status have no say. If ALL of these people were to
have some voice in setting up their government, and I mean some voice
other than "Well, they haven't assassinated the Emir yet," THEN I would
call that a "legitimate" government.
 
To answer your other question: I am still somewhat skeptical about the
US having any business in the Gulf to begin with, but were we not
fighting under the auspices of a known dictator I would feel much better
about supporting the war effort. Yes, were we not fighting to restore
a society where women are property and the secret police are not
answerable to any outside legal agency for any of their actions, I would
most likely approve of the war. I simply cannot approve of anything
that supports and encourages these sort of things, because I find them
morally repugnant.

  My father too, was a WWII vet. When he was laid to rest, we enclosed a
48-star flag (6'x4', It was BIG!) in place of the 50-star banner. I'm
not sure why though.
The war brings some aches to me also, but I handle it well.
 
My father was also very talented in his profession, but due to the alco-
hol, he was forced to retire at age 50. 
As for the blame, I place it upon myself. Bad childhood health didn't 
help matters.

Yes, I am the youngest. My sisters remember when my Dad was not drunk 
ALL the time. I can't remember him not drinking. When I was a pre-teen, 
I realized for the first time that NOT everybodies Father was a drunk. 
I used to follow him down to the bar and beg him not to go. It would 
make him mad, to say the least. Now I realize that he was mad because 
my begging made him feel guilty. He worked on job sites (like disney 
world) so he would be gone for weeks at a time. Sometimes, the paychecks
never made it home. I used to hate him for making my mother suffer and 
struggle.

In reading several of the messages to and from you, I was wondering
whether you have ever watched little kids interacting.  I see a much
more "natural" series of interactions.  Those that are not based 
on the stuff we are programmed with as we progress.  Wouldn't it
be nice if adults could act more like kids in this respect?  Certainly
there are enough childish adults ..... just read some of the messages

I am sorry that your mother was so hard to deal with. Men need strong 
female (role molels? wrong word but you know what I mean) when they 
are young. The men I know that get along best with women are the ones 
who had good relationships with sisters and/or their mother. 
My father was too drunk to play mind games, thank god. He didn't just 
drink a little and get nasty...., he drank so much, he couldn't stand 
up. Every night..... same old thing. It was rotten but it would have 
been worse if he were a "mean drunk". 
Manipulation breeds mistrust, as you well know. But do you find that 
you are drawn to manipulating women because of it??? I've heard this 
l
from other men. They didn't get along with their mothers, yet they ended
up with women who were somehow like their moms. Same goes for women.

Hello, homophobes are us...
 
Way ta go, Groucho...you just pressed my button.  Lemme set you straight
on one thing before I continue...I am not a homophobe. This is not 
open for debate; don't bother to contest it.
 
I do advocate personal freedom.  If I didn't, I would be out actively
campaigning to have homos put away for thier particular mental defect.
 
If my tirades amuse you, then so be it...at least you won't "go off" 
with blathing nonsense about "They are people too (yes, but sick ones)
You are a homophobe (more utter nonsense) or any of the other generic
phrases that "enlightened" (meaning people who don't know what sick is)
people routinely use at me. 
 
As for what type of upbringing, one that was strict.  My familiy doesn't
have a lot of emotional scenes, and "love" is acknowledged but not 
often discussed.  I was told not to cry, which suits me anyway, because
in school, it wasn't much of an asset.  My father knows that homos are
sick, most of the people I know believe the same way.  (Not that my
father had much of an influence on me, because he aslo hates blacks. I
am pretty ambivalent.)  
 
Amusing enough?  Fine.  Don't bother to reply.

Ok, I understand a little better...but let me pose a question to you.
Knowing that we cannot change the govnt, and if we did then we would
be no better than Hussien, do you still want to see Hussein gone?  If
so, then we would have to restore the previous govnt and hope that they
can by themselves get thier act together.
 The situation you described to me would be ideal, obviously. But It
Ain't Gonna Happen in the near future.  So, we have a choice...get rid
of Hussien or not get rid of Hussien (the govnt restored not 
withstanding).  Because obviously, the man has *got* to go.  Now, 
liberating Kuwait on the way is a fringe benifit, obviously the people
were not being treated as badly before as they are now.  (It's a 
relative thing.)
 
What do you tbink would have happened in the Arab world if Hussein were
assassinated?  Not in Iraq or Kuwait, what would have happened there is
not what I was asking.  What would have been the Arab's reaction?

I'm with my hero and inspiration on this one.  Absolutely noone can be
as cruel and insensitive as a child.   Read any good Piaget lately?
Most of a childs interactions are a result of them externalizing
their understanding of the world and thereby reinforcing those 
understandings.  Trick is when the understandings are faulty as they
are bound to be when treading on the new ground of interpersonal
relationships.  I'd rather try and relate to an old person that has

That's pretty heavy Dave.  It actually has a grain of truth in it too
but... when all things are relative you still end up with the hate of
an enemy on one end of the scale and the love of a friend on the other
and you assign a value to these realtionships - or have you just 
decided that you won't have any of those of any kind?  If you have ever 
experienced the joy of a true friend it isn't something that you can
cast off lightly.  Of course - there isn't hardly a worse pain than
a friendship betrayed either.  I just went through one of those but -
maybe we'll talk about it over a beer sometime.  I still would not
hesitate to do it again just for the years of joy that the friendship
involved.

Nope, never saw "Steel Magnolias." I make a point to steer away from
anything that puts Meryl Streep and Shirley the Loon--er, Maclain
in the same screen at the same time. Besides, it didn't have starships,
people with large automatic weapons, swordplay, eccentric geniuses
flooding college dorms with liquid nitrogen, or any of the other things
that make a movie worth watching, so what's the point?

Considering the caliber of the people who write for Playboy
(Isaac Asimov, Harlan Ellison, Paul Thereaux, Arthur C. Clarke),
anyone who buys Playboy and /doesn't/ read it ought to be executed
or at least branded a Philistine and sent to live in exile in
Plains, Georgia.

Since when?? It's been my experience that women are just as capable as
men at "taking it the step further"--you mean you always expect that

Not me...I got along with dear old Mom but Sis and I hate one another

>What do you tbink would have happened in the Arab world if
>Hussein were assassinated?
 
Little that hasn't happened by the presence of a large U.S. military
force in the region to begin with. Either way, some of the extremists
are gonna be upset. I think in the long run a simple assassination would
be LESS irritating than the continual presence of U.S. troops, even for
a brief while; after all, it wouldn't make for thousands of grieving
Iraquis with /personal/ vendettas against the good ol' U.S. of A.
Given the choice, I would still like to see Hussein go bye-bye.
 
I will say, though, I am happy the allied forces have been doing as well
as they have, and with as few casualties on the friendly side. If you
ARE going to pull a full-scale military action, might as well do it 
right. While I don't agree with a lot fo the actions we've been taking
in that area of the world, I've been highly impressed with the way we've
been taking them.

I know where that one's coming from; I used to deck people who touched

WHEN:    Saturday, March 23rd, 1991.
WHERE:   Turtle's apartment, 1895 Shadowood, on US 301 by the airport.
WHY:     To kill two birds with one stone (to celebrate the occasion of
         Turtle's birth, and to remedy the fact that it's been several
         months since the last A/R Florida Furry Party).
WHAT:    The usual--animation, conversation, juggling foxes, mayhem,
         noise, rutabaga sacrifice, synchronized jumping...and hopefully
         nobody's windows get shot out.
WHO:     Any sapient being posessed of sufficient intelligence to be
         able to use a language to communicate the idea that he, she, or
         it is there voluntarily. The coercion committee will be
         rounding up the guests of honor this time around.
 
Need further information? Drop a message. This furry party will probably
start at about 5 PM Saturday and end at 6 PM Sunday, or until the
police arrive, whichever shall be earlier. Mountain Dew cheerfully
provided.

My parents used to go to 'Tim's bar, making my sister & I wait in the

The paychecks always made it home and we were well cared for ('cept for
