  They have been working on that Rescuers sequel a long time. I first
heard it was to be relased last year. 
  Starlog carries some updates on fantasy film releases. Fantasia
will be listed in their film calandar if its re-relased.

>god calls it murder.
 
I'll take your (or her) word for it; I haven't talked personally with
god recently, so I wouldn't know what he calls it. Considering how
between 60 and 80% of all fertilized human eggs never make it to
childhood naturally, the majority of which simply fail to attach to the
uterus and are absorbed or expelled, I'd say that if god /does/ call
it murder, it must be an activity he approves of. Otherwise, of course,
one could expect that the system wouldn't have been built that way.
 
Arguments from religion don't impress me. After all, at various times
in history god has been quoted as saying that the world is flat, all
non-Catholics should be tortured to death, books like "Charlotte's
Web" are immoral and should be burned, and your bank account really
ought to be turned over to Oral Roberts (before he gets called home).
This means that either god is a real unreliable source of information
or the people who are quoting him are simply...um, mistaken.

Sigmund Freud coined the term "anal retentive;" he catagorized most
people as being "oral compulsive" (these are people who are always
biting the ends of pencils and the like, and are generally sloppy,
fidgity, and disorganized) and "anal retentive" (these are the people
who were potty trained too early; they're compulsively neat and tidy,
and do things like line up sharp pencils on an otherwise clear desk).
I never could fathom Freud's fascination with pencils.

--- Just as a disclaimer, the opinion expressed really is that of
Chip P. Unicorn, but really addressed to the Specialist's girlfriend. --
   
Several questions:
   1. Which god? 
   2. How do you define murder?
   3. How do you define abortion?
   4. What do we do with all the unwanted children that would result
if abortion wasn't legal? (If you diatribe back at me "Adoption, not
abortion" -- How many children have you adopted?)
   5. What real solutions do you have to the problems that cause
unwanted pregnancies?
   6. Is all abortion immoral? (assuming, of course, that murder is
immoral.) How about diseased children who won't survive a month? Who
wouldn't survive two months? A year? Two years? Twelve? What if they'll
live a normal-span life, but are a vegetable for their lives? What if
they're deformed? If you set a limit on when abortions can be placed,
what is that limit?
   7. If you say abortion cannot be performed under any circumstances,
what of a child born with AIDS -- and would cost his parents literally
tens (maybe hundreds) of thousands of dollars to keep? Who pays for
that? Or, who helps "crack babies"?
    
   Mind you -- I'm not attacking you. I'm honestly asking for answers
-- your answers, please... -- to those questions. Myself, I'm a born-
again Christian who isn't so certain that either side of the abortion
question are right. But, I'm interested in talking with both sides...
You might convert me....

you make second generation copies for everyone from the camcorder. You 
left too much empty space on the VHS copy... By the way, show the music

I like the idea about puting the back ground in the D/l's, you could
also put the story so far in the d/l's too. One of my biggest hang
ups as a latecomer was that i only knew the last 100 messages or
so, which were exciting, but not all that helpful for entering
the story..it gets very complicated, and unless you have been following
the story, its nearly imposible to find a little nooke where a new
player would fit. If you could go off line, and read the messages
through, at your own pace, and find a spot where a new person
would be benefichal to the story, and you could get some idea of
where this is all supposed to be going.  On WD the basic quest was
discovered early in the story, and basically only the sub problems
were discussed for a long time, so its hard to tell what you should
be trying to help/hinder accomplishing...well, its only a suggestion, an
long time, but hopefully it will help at least a little...

Okay, but the tape line-up (if you get a copy) is like this:
 
The Main video will be 2nd generation because I /had/ to edit out about 
10 minutes where the tape *royally* screwed up....
The TURTLE CAM is 2nd generation as well...
The music video is 3rd generation...I had to copy from camcorder to
to vhs (the main copy) and back to camcorder for the flying erase 
head, and then, finally, back to VHS to add the music....The picture
isn't /that/ bad, but it would be better if Iactually used /new/
camcorder tapes, and had something /besides/ a 2-head vcr...basically,
the tape in SP looks like a 1st or 2nd generation in SLP mode....

It can't actually clean up a signal that's already degraded, but the

BBS COMMUNITY IN MOURNING AFTER EXPLOSION
 
Sarasota (Turtle Press): The Sarasota BBS community suffered a tragic
loss this afternoon when Remote Control went down due to a catastrophic
failure of a mass storage device. Tyler Robinson, sysop of Remote
Control, reports that the system was experiencing difficulty with its
serial I/O devices earlier this week. A call to a local repair shop
produced a technician who suggested that he switch around the cables
running into his 1581 disk drive. When this was done and the computer
was powered up, Tyler says, "It shot out lots of sparks from the 1581,
and it caught fire." The extent of the damage is not yet known, but
the board may be down for "a real long time."
No one was injured in the explosion.

Dear Turtle,
   Hate to say this, but God doesn't have a fax machine. His Son bought
one to keep in touch with some of His business associates, and His Wife
occasionally sends recipes through it, but as far as I know, He Himself
hasn't used it.
   However, He does have a two hundred line telephone system to His
house... if you can get past His secretary. And occasionally His Uncle
answers for Him, but only occasionally. The Southern Baptists usually
reach the Uncle... 
   How do I know this? Visited His House one night, when I was dating
His Daughter. 
           
   Although I hate to say it, I agree with you. Too many people have 
used God as an excuse to force their views on others. The God of the 
New Testament threw away the old laws -- why do people still feel that
they're under them? (Some of the moralizing reminds me of comments by
Jesus to the Pharisees...)

It was amazing!  Shot sparks 5-feet across the room!  I never knew
my computer was capable of sending that much power through the serial 
port!  Initial diagnosis points to the printer interface short-circuting
and sending a power jolt along the srial cable to everything Iown except
my Amiga!  Fortunately, the only damaged parties seem to be the 1581 and
my printer...it seems the 1581 absorbed the shock and triggered an auto-
shutdown, which gave me the impression my 128D was dead, but it was just
because the 1581 made /everything/ shut down and blocked the serial
cable output to keep the surge contained.....pretty smart drive if you
ask me!  Anyways, the BBS is back up on a /very/ limited basis running
off of only one drive, Hopefully my 1581 will be fixed /very/ soon,
the repair tech said that since the 1581 still turns on and tries to 
boot a disk that "You were lucky, it should be fixed this afternoon."
But, that's what they always say...anyways, stay tuned for updates..

Dear Sauron,
   You've misunderstood me. I actually AM quite interested in hearing
the responses of the Specialist's girlfriend to those questions. Heck --
I'd be interested in hearing MY answers to those questions.
     
   I am neither pro-choice nor pro-life. (Okay, okay... neither pro-
death nor anti-choice.) I have not been convinced that either extreme
 is what our country needs. Although I am born-again, I am also a
Libertarian -- and my born-again-edness does NOT mean I am necessarily
conservative, politically. I have met many born-again Christians (one
of which lead the New College Bible Study four years ago) who are also
vehemently pro-choice.
   I am opposed to the pro-lifers in that they don't really provide
solutions to the problems that would happen if abortion were outlawed.
Many mistake slogans for solutions. Thousands have "Adoption, not
abortion" bumper stickers, but they themselves haven't adopted any
children -- let alone the children who would be difficult to adopt.
(That is, "crack babies," or babies born with genetic diseases.) They
have no solutions for should happen after abortion is made illegal,
and they generally don't practice what they preach.
   I am opposed to the pro-choicers because one of their main reasons:
"If abortion were outlawed, people would still seek them out." is
worthless. This argument also works perfectly for murder and rape --
heck, any crime. A second issue "the reproductive freedom of the woman"
is probably better taken care of by birth control.
     
   I'll admit -- I don't have a solution. In my "perfect world," 
abortions wouldn't ever be necessary, because there would exist a
100%-successful birth control device that's easy to use (preferably a
one-application thing that lasts forever), easily reversable, and
does not detract from the joy of sex, and cheap, and that EVERYONE
knows about it. (Through schooling.) If this existed, abortions would
become unnecessary, and could be removed.

Not displayed at one time, but I can think of applications where a
greater palette range would be necessary--for instance, if you were
doing video animation work, i.e., recording each frame of the movie
separately onto a VCR, or digitizing external video sources in order to
add animation or special effects.  Right now, the Mac II is the only
microcomputer whose off-the-shelf graphics capabilities are at this
level, but the Amiga can be shoved into that range for less than the
price of a low-end Mac II -- and the software for doing animation and
complex VCR control (genlock, frame grabbing, sound synchs, etc.) is
considerably better for the Amiga than for any graphics system I've
seen, including a few $40K dedicated graphics workstations.

I've seen that argument.  It's interesting, but it eliminates the second
possibility by stating that anyone who was lying must be doing it for
evil ends, which would have been at odds with the teachings, therefore
that couldn't have been what was really going on -- Q.E.D.  For an
eloquent (if probably unintentional) rebuttal to that line, see David
Brin's novel THE POSTMAN, in which the main character ends up claiming
to be a legal representative of the U.S. Government after a nuclear war;
even though he is not what he says he is, and he knows he's lying
through his teeth (i.e., he's not insane), both he and what he
"represents" become reasons for hope in what seems to be a hopeless
situation.

Actually, I would rather they not bother to colorize movies at all.
Some motion pictures, like pen-and-ink drawings, look better in black
and white, especially if (like the drawings) they were created with
that "limitation" in mind.  Colorizing a movie correctly would require
extremely sophisticated shading effects and wouldn't be cost-effective,
hence, the dopey colors colorized films end up with.  Anyone who would
refuse to watch a movie because it is black-and-white probably isn't
able to "get" complex movies to begin with, color or not, and would be
just as baffled by "Blade Runner" as by "Citizen Kane".  Such people are
better off sticking to "Ice Pirates" and drooling in their Kool-Aid.

"Rumors" and "rumours" are both correct (the latter is British);
"roumors" and "roumours" are not. However, "roumours" is the
correct spelling of the Sanskrit expression meaning "My, what a
colorful rabbit that is"--a linguistic oddity, since rabbits are
not native to any part of the world where Sanskrit is spoken. It is
believed that the phrase was coined by intrepid archeologist Sir
Raymond Misnomer, upon returning to his tent one day and discovering
that a large and ill-tempered bear had been there before him and
absconded with his backpack, notebook, and two assistants; this is,
however, apocrypha, and the true origin of the expression is rightfully
shrouded in mystery.

When I was going to college in Pennsylvania, I got a really nasty cough,

Unfortunately, he forgot to mention that it was 15mg coedine per ml, and
I took my first dose of it on my way to my calculus final exam. This

any time I see a green liquid I break down into complete hysterics and

in Berne can treat it in a rigorous ten-day program that involves

Since that is essentially a value judgement, I don't see how you're
going to /prove/ that abortion is or is not homicide. The decision to
have an abortion is an individual one with absolutely no hard and fast
moral rules to guide it, despite what all the fanatics on both sides of
the issue say, and those who think it's wrong have no right to impose
that view on people who don't agree with them. If you are uninvolved
with the people in question, you simply don't have the authority to
tell them how to decide--unless perhaps you were planning to adopt
the unwanted baby. If you /aren't/ willing to go that far for your
beliefs, well, don't try forcing them down someone else's throat.

DigiView digitizes in 16M colors, but it still only displays 4096 on
the screen!  It does use dithering effects, though, so in hi-res mode on
an expensive monitor it looks like you're getting around 100,000.
   DigiView and a few other Amiga graphics programs, like Turbo Silver,
use 16M or 24M-color "virtual palettes" so if you port their pictures
over to a high-end graphics system that can display all those colors,
their output takes full advantage of it.
   I know of at least one case where a company uses the MS-DOS Targa
display system for the final output, but uses Turbo Silver to do all the
actual "work" because the Targa's software lags far behind the Amiga's--
despite the fact that Targa has been around for about 6 years...

Dear Yngling,
   I';ve been erring on th liberal side, calling abortion a "necessary
evil" -- by no means even a good solution, but unfortunately a
solution that people rely on. 
   If George Bush is really anti-abortion, he should give a lot of
money to scientists to create better birth control methods -- and money
to educate students about the importance of birth control. A lot of
conservatives are shocked by this idea -- but if there's no abortion,
there has GOT to be some alternative to keep unwanted children from
being procduced. (Please don't quote from the Gospel of Abstention. It

Glad you asked. According to Webster's New Universal Unabridged 
Dictionary (you know, the one which gives hernias to everything under
the size of a Clydesdale...), it gives the following definition of
a stoor:
   1. Combat or conflict. 2. Turmoil. 3. A storm. 4. Wind-blown dust.
     
   So, then a stoorkeeper is one who keeps either combat, conflict,
turmoil, storms, or wind-blown dust. If you wish to become a stoor-
keeper, I woud advise the last one... it's the easiest to box, and 
you might be able to sell some. Then again, some sysops of local
BBS's are excellent at keeping the first two.

 - The Postman was at times deluding /himself/ into beleiving that the 
Eastern United States /did/ really exist. By most measures he would be
deemed at least partially insane. But I do get your point.  Most people
who die for causes are clinically insane.. doens't necessarilly mean 
they should be locked up though.

I dunno' if I have told anyone (besides on my board), but I found
a cable that we had hooked up to our 2nd ver...One of those German
deals that are like gold or something...ANyways, I re-did the 
"Furry Tape" with that in place, and cleaned the VCR's heads &
used a new tape...anyways, the result is a dramatic improvement in
tape quaility...for easier duplication, I have combined the Rufus CON
and Tampa Bay Furry Party into a 2 hour spectatular!  It'll fit 
perfectly on a T-120 tape in SP mode...Anyways, remember that it is
still availible...I have had alot of "I want it" messages, but noone
seems to do anything about getting it...The tape features TURTLE CAM 
I & II and rthe music video....the cost is nothing, and it is great
fun, and I think it accuarately represents what goes on at a "Furry
Party"....
