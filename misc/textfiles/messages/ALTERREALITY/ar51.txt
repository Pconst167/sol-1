Since most of the users of this BBS are of the intelligent and well-
versed in the state of the world, variety, I'm sure most of you have
seen CNN's footage of Patriot missiles shooting down SCUD's...you know,
speck of light goes down, speck of light goes up to meet it, bright
flash, pieces raining down everywhere. Well, that's the way my message
base looked this afternoon. Had a small problem with a hard drive I
was using...(You all did notice how fast things were running over the
past couple of days, yes?) Hard drive has been disconnected; we're
back to floppies again; and a fair number of messages entered in the
last couple of days have been garbled or lost completely. If you said

Wow... she's got insight too!  I maintained for years that ST was
years ahead of its time in being a leading proponent of women and
minority rights.  They used to tackle some pretty hairy social problems
(for that era) such as when they visited the planet where the inhabitant
were Roman type "gods" and had telekinesis powers to force the crew to
do whatever they wanted.  In one scene they had Spock, Uhura, Kirk and
Nurse playing like a love scene.  For that time having Uhura (a black
female) almost kissing Kirk was incredibly brave along the lines of
"Look Who's Coming to Dinner".  While others think that Shatner was 
a "ham" - at the time it was very popular for the shows to have a very
visible hero.  I personally think that Shatner was very charismatic and
the entire cast was an act of genius on Roddenberry's part.

Amen, Amen. Shatner played Kirk with a hint of Shakespere(sp?) and a 
pound of macho. By the way, "Look who's coming to dinner" is one of my
favorites. Star Trek had many aspects that were "before it's time". 
That's one reason it was canceled. Just not enough people made noise 
until it was too late. Shatner was a ham, especially when compared to 
the others in the show. He often launched into poetic speeches (very
shaksperian(excuse the spelling, it's, like, 1:15 am, my eyes are 
drooping a little). I think a lot of people viewed Star Trek as a corney
spoof. But I came away from it with something else, a view of the future
and enough fantasy to make me look forward to the Kirk's and Spock's of 
yet to come. I was a mere child when the original series ran ('nuff 
said about age) and I believe that watching the show molded a lot of 
minds about equality between both the sexes and the races. "Give peace
a chance" and all that. And..... if all else fails, lock on target and 
fire torpedoes. But above all, do not break the Prime Directive!!!!

Funny you should mention that; the first episode I saw of the Trek
marathon last night had them doing just that, in a big way. (THE
episode is called, I believe, "The Apple;" it's the one with Vaal the
computer...) Didn't wait but a couple more hours before they were
doing it again ("A private Little War"). And, of course, for sheer
dramatic storytelling, nothing can top the hippie episode ("The Way to
Eden"...yeah, brother!). Sorry...I just can't see the overwhelming
appeal of the oiriginal series. Ahead of its time, yes. Worth watching,
yes. Imaginative, yes. Better than the new one, no. Well-acted, no.

The school obviously had a fairly bad standing.  They figured if they
got many National Merit Finalists, they could print in thier catalog, 
"Last year, we had X freshmen enter, of that, Y were National Merit

considering that half the students left after their first year, there
must be something terribly wrong.

Regarding your "High progile-ex-jocks-money" idea, I agree that
that's true with colleges and universities, but not on a high school
level.  High schools shouldn't have to solicit funds from their past
students.
(of course, our school is currently asking for a $4 donation from

It sounds to me like your test of "endurance" for women was a test of
strength.  Throwing 10,000 pounds a day of weight is considerably more
dependent on muscle power than it is on stamina; from what I've read,
the results would be quite different if endurance was tested in
something approaching a combat situation.  The few female paintball
teams out there (not many, you know, because it's a "man's game") are
consistently ranked in the upper 25% in national competitions -- not
bad when you consider they likely account for less than 5% of the
competitors.

I don't want to fight for reasons that I consider not worth fighting
for.  I would encourage anyone to think about what they're being asked
to kill and die for.  This may be "pacifism," but it's also common
sense.
   There WERE a lot of pacifists in 1776, including most of the leaders
of the Revolution.  They felt it WAS a cause worth dying for.  I do not
feel that the "liberation of Kuwait" is such a cause.  I don't believe
any of the founding fathers would feel it was, either, since we're
effectively fighting to RESTORE a monarchy much like the one they fought
a war to overthrow.
   Personally, I don't believe this makes me a hypocrite.  Now it's your
turn: you seem to advocate following your government blindly, right or
wrong.  I don't think that makes you patriotic.  I think it makes you a

They battle back and forth, etc.  The Enterprise plays dead for hours 
Spock accidently hits a switch on the scanner boards, and the Romulan's
detect it.  Kirk deduces that the Romulan's /have/ detect them and has 
Sulu fire phasers in random pattern, widest dispersion.  They critically
damage the Romulan vessel and they self-destruct.

The name of that show was Balance of Terror. It was a good one, Kirk is 
the ultimate poker player (as later seen in the Wrath of Khan= the 
ultimate poker game.). As to why I liked Amok Time; because it was the
first show that delved(sp?) into the rituals and bowels of Vulcan. I 
found it "fascinating". Miri; I dunno, Janice Rand had a big part in 
that one and I liked the plot. Besides Uhera and Chapel, Rand was the 
only other lead female and for what, one season? Her character was not
unflappable and strong like a She-man. And she was the closest thing 
Kirk had to a steady girl besides the Enterprise. Of course, they never
really developed the relationship between the two, which was probobly

singing echoing through the ship "I'll take you home again, Kathleen...

I hope you get to see a film that goes something like "You can only
digest the same type of protiens found in your body," with this stupid
kid standing in the middle of the street going "So we have to eat 
people to get protien that we can use?"  The best part is when some guy
passing by goes "That's disgusting."  The film procedes with animated
hamburgers.  Not as good as the series of films done by Ford that we saw

There's an annual Star Trek con in Tampa called Vulkon, but it's very

interesting, even for ST fans. There's also a general science-fiction/
fantasy con called Necronomicon in the last week in October every year
that's much better; it's not strictly Star Trek, but you can find

So you're saying, then, that you /do/ believe the Founding Fathers

may lead, whatever the circumstances? I remind you that this country was
made a country by people who did NOT follow their government blindly,
and in fact REBELLED AGAINST their government.
 
The founding fathers didn't think their government was always right!
Wow! (Revelation, like dawn breaking.)
 
The Founding Fathers had more than a little contempt for people who DO
follow their government like sheep! (Another revelation.)
 
George Bush is a /man/, not a god, not some infallible superhero. He

bloodthirsty monarch to the head of a repressive, totalitarian
government in a country that is not a formal ally, I for one will start
taking a long hard look to see if he is not perhaps in error.

No. It is provable, observable truth. More than half of all the people

AMOUNT more than half are male. This is a fact that is not based on

way they want. And I've heard TOO many of them speak, they truly think

Do you remember that Star Trek survey they had at Oasis III that asked
questions like how much you made each year, and where you stood on
issues like abortion, toxic waste, and velcro shoes?  I wonder what 
ever became of those.  I've heard that Oasis IV has been cancelled 
because the organizer is having personal problems.  If you happen to

A Post-It (tm) fish is a fish that's been treated with 3M's patented
adhesive (the one they make Post-It notes with) so it sticks to things
and peels off without leaving a sticky residue.

Actually, they're Herman Melville's quotes, from Moby Dick (one of the
books sitting on the bookshelf in the cargo container, in fact).
"From Hell's heart, I stab at thee; for hate's sake, I spit my last
breath at thee." Captain Ahab's last words. If you watch the movie 
looking for Melville references, you will find lots and lots of them.
The scriptwriter was evidently a fan of the classics...

XModem 1K is normal XModem/CRC with 1024-byte packets (generic
XModem uses 128-byte packets). YModem is XModem 1K with an additional
packet that gives the name of the file being transmitted; it is
also a batch protocol, so you can send or receive a large number of
files all at once (when one file is finished transmitting, it will send
an EOT followed by a block zero containing the filename of the next
file to be sent; it uses two EOT's to end the transmission when all the
files have been sent). XModem 1K is, obviously, faster than XModem
because the packet size is larger. Its reliability is about the same,
but on noisy lines you're better off with XModem since you don't have
as much stuff to retransmit if a frame gets trashed.

So, lemme get this straight...you have all kinds of mass, but not all
of it is muscle?  Good.  Now, all you have to do is lift weights at 
p;l['./[-p';
/.]\
home, and turn that into muscle.  If you think that the pain in your
side is bad, wait'll you get into lifting.  The nice thing about 
weightlifting, is that it is brainwashing to a degree.  You feel bad
the first couple of weeks, then when you notice results, you wanna do
more.  So you start looking forward to training.  You look forward the
pain because you know that the pain is building you up.
 
Of course, it's not addictive....

If you are overweight, working out is one of the best things to do. 
There are basically two ways to lose weight. One is to decrease your 
calorie intake, and the other is to increase to amount of calories you
burn up.  If you do decide to workout exercise muscle groups every
other day, and use a high protein diet.  That with allow you to build 
muscle more effectively.  Don't increase your carbohydrate intake too 
much, because then, during workout, you will be burning carbohydrates 
not fat.  Don't try to do both methods, that's a mistake a lot of 
people make.  The problem with doing that is you won't be able to 
workout long enough to start burning fat because you'll tire too easily.
