I *wasn't* being cocksure.  It's not like I was saying "99% of X" with
factual backup; I thought it was fairly obvious that I was exaggerating
and being a bit sarcastic.
   You're not the only person who completely misses it when I'm not
being particularly serious, which is (believe it or not) most of the
time.  While there's something humorous in knowing I can spit out the
wildest claptrap and, if I do it in a somber enough "tone," get back a
whole slew of "HOW could you REALLY BELIEVE that!" messages for the next
3,000 or so posts, people should pay a wee bit more attention	 to the
context of my messages.  (So sue me for being subtle....)

As a new user to this bbs, I find it very interesting to see all this 
chit chat about god knows what.  The issues that are discussed are e
enlightening and informative (snicker, snicker).  How does one get 
involved by putting  in his two   cents worth.  (kind of answered my 
own question huh..).  As far as
Saudi Arabiand Kuwait is concerned, Its almost (uh oh here 
comes)ARMAGEDON time. This is possibly a new topic of discussion.
Also the best branch of the armed forces is all of them.  Without one, 
the others would be like a hand with no thumb.  The job would get done
but with greater difficulty and 
greater cost (lives).  Last but not least the discussion on computer 
equipment.  I could tell you I have an expensive IBM with all th
latest attachments or a TANDY with all the (same as above) attachments
but all the SYSOP has to do is look me up and...ta-dah...he knows I'm 
a liar.  For the sake of stupidity, I'll reveal my (chocomputer.
I'll prepare for the inevitable   bashing now (lowers head in shame).
It's a (gulp)Commodore 64.  With a little compasion on everyones part,
I'll live through (I'm reasonably sure) the bashing that is to come.....

My literary interests lie un the area of mystery,espionage,and the like.

Actually, last time I looked, nobody ruled the world, although a lot of
people have laid claim to parts of it. Just think, though; if the
Communists don't rule the world, someone else will! Same for the
fascists, the Muslims, the IBM fanatics... The logic is indisputable,

Hmmm.  As a Army Dog, I can say with conviction that if what you 
described (one hand washing the other) was actually true, then the
armed forces would be *really* kick ass.  Unfortunately, there is
squabbling at the really high echelons.  This I know, because they 
can't all agree on something as simple as COMMUNICATIONS GEAR! If
the Air Force wants in on an Army net, do they train thier Flyboys
to operate Army equipment?  Hell no, they get a detachment of 
Army to stay at an AF base and work the equipment for them!  (And 
make the Army pay for it!!)

Ha!  Have you all been watching the Christian networks?  If you listen
to them for just 15 minutes you can hear more bullshit than all the 
networks combined can throw at you (and that includes CNN)!  Thay
try to make impossible connections between what's going on in Iraq
with Armageddon by correlating the happenings there to ambiguous 
(and I do mean, really ambiguous...the kind of wording that makes
*ABSOLUTELY* no sense whatsoever no matter what you connect it with)
wording from the bible.  And try to say that all the forces there and
the whole world ("nations will unite") are all there actually to 
attack ISRAEL...c'mon!  Don't flatter yourselves.

Since your tastes lean towards the mystery/espionage genre let me recom-
mend "The Brotherhood of the Rose," "The Fraternity of the Stone," & 
"The League of Night & Fog" by David Morrell.  Excellent books!  However
avoid anything else he has written.  Sometimes I'm amazed that an author
can be both brilliant and retarded...another example being Clancy's
"Cardinal of the Kremlin." Dreck! Which was then followed by a"A Clear
and Present Danger" which is probably his best to date.
   BTW - for those who enjoy good novels re: the Vietnam War: "The Fire
Dream" by Franklin Allen Leib recently released in mass market ppbk at
$5.95 is /very/ good [so far anyway, I'm 1/2 way thru it].

Just a quick bit of RELIGIOUS

Cherynobel (not sure of spelling). That word (cherynobel) is translated 
in either Hebrew or Greek as       "wormwood" which is used in the (here
comes that word)Bible in the book of Revelations in a description of the
judgements of God in the last days.  (I heard this from 60 MINUTES, a
reputable news organization.  Now I'm not saying these are the end times
but that is quite a coincidense   don't you think?
As far as the military is concerned,  I'll admit the administration 
of the armed forces does leave something to be desired, and I do see you
r point. Can you imagine how difficult it would be to deal with the Mid

Diplomatic Tactfulness....the fruit to which the winners of the 
business world feed upon. I have made a career out of playing office
politics and getting myself (and the company I work for) into a 
situation of technilogical creativity and advancement. The company
I'm at is about 45 years old and some of the employees there celibrate
anniversaries that started prior to my birth. It's rough to deal with
these people, but after many years, I'm learning how to do it. Just got
myself into a new postion and purchased about $150K of new 'puter toys
for my department. Have the fun is the game.
  
No more THRUDlings, huh? Well, two was enough for us (not just me). I
think we could "afford" more, but it would distract too much from the
proper raising of the one's we have. But damn-it, I LOVE kids!!! So
innocent, so much fun, so little bull.....oh well.

Laughing at  your Re-Up NCO makes you retired?  Then I guess that I'm
retired, too.
  Cept, I always thought that when you were retired you got a pension
or something... all I got was this piece of cardboard which said,
"Honorable Discharge".
  If you ain't a 95 Bang-Bang or mail clerk or mess hall then you 
ain't shit?  Hmm.  I guess that I'm not shit then!  What a good 
feeling!  (Oh, hell...the other side of that is, if you are a 95B or
mail clerk or mess hall then you *are* shit!)
  
  I was a communicator.  31C20A4V9...Single channel radio opr, NCO
tests (I had BNCOC), Morse qualified, Tactical Satellite opr.
I worked at a Command Center in Korea, EA qualified (Emergency Action
traffic for dissemination of Nuclear Release orders...I held one of
the keys).  Basically, a glorified RATT operator who got stuck in a
high security clearance/personal reliablity slot. 
  So, you can see why I developed the attitude I have about following
orders...you can't fail or foul up in a position like that.  If you
do, you are a failure in a critical chain.  (And we were like, second
in line.  We got our orders from CINCPAC, Hawaii.)

  Actually, my military time wasn't that boring, at least the two 
years I spent in Korea weren't.  Real world situations kept us
pretty busy (scrambles against North Korean aircraft, and reports
of DMZ violations, other things which I can't talk about (still!)), 
and when we weren't doing that, it was train, train, train.

If you take a person's shoe size and divide it by the caliber of a
bullet fired at him, you'll get the distance (in centimeters) that
person can move before being hit. Similarly, if you take a person's

Hello dear Donthen/Max/Watts:
   Hi there!  It's two in the morning and I've just finished a run of a
play that I've waited fourteen years to do and I'm four sheets to the
wind and feeling maudlin and sappy and sentimental and why I'm 
addressing this message to you, I'm not totally sure.  I guess it's 
because you never cut me any slack.  It's a nice change.  Anyway, I've
just finished a double performance (both a matinee and an evening show)
of a play I've always wanted to do.  A bunch of us (exhausted as we 
were) went out  for a drink or two, or three, or four .... after the
show.  We were marvelously mushy and happy and most appropriately proud
of our achievement.  .......
   I felt like an outsider.
   Strange, I'm talking to someone who is not here and responding, and
yet I stayed silent among a group of friends and, supposed, compatriates
Hmmmmmmmm. So most strange to finally, after waiting fourteen years, to
at last perform a show that was everything you could ever imagine, and
to miraculously, have it NOT be a letdown.  It was ... I could not 
express the emotion even to those I shared it with.
    Unfortunately, my fellow actors knew me, or at least, the me I
project to the general world.  No one who knows me believes I am a
spiritual person.  That I believe in those most mundane things like
God, and eternity, and how both make a real difference in a view of
this most bizarre universe.
    I am to those who know me, a cynic.  How can they know the wonder
I feel at ...  I'm sorry, I'm babbling.  Excuse this most uncharacter-
istic  jaunt into introspection in this time between work and pleasure
that we plebians call the weekend  --- Christ, where are these bad
cliches coming from?   
    Max/Donthen/Watts, I sense a kindred spirit that rails against
... stop, whoa!!!!!!!  Thank you for listening, and indulging this 
happy, maudlin, most strange wee-hour-of-the-morning musings.  Feel
the spirit.  Enjoy!!!

going to list more, but the only other yuppie I think I'd like is
Reli, and since she doesn't exist (unless one wants to get into odd
metaphysics about writing) she might not be a good example.  But if I
met a yuppie like her (sans fur, before someone says "You mean an
anthropomorphic cat?"), I think I'd like her.... :)

Actually, "Infinity, Inc." is already a trademark of DC, so the point
is moot.
---
   Incidentally, "DC Comics" is the legal name of that particular
company.  But "DC" stands for their original title, "Detective Comics."
Is this kind of like "NCNB National Bank?"  You can argue that saying
"DC Comics" is grammatically wrong, but legally, it's correct.  Of
course, legally "TSR" doesn't stand for anything now, either, as the
company's official name is just "TSR" (not even "TSR Hobbies").

Well, hey, the Trash-80 has all the "special language" characters built
in, plus a complete graphic set which has nothing to do with anything
else (or anything useful, for that matter), 64 mysterious "space
compression codes" which can occasionally be put to good use over BBS's
that support TRS-80 graphics (I know of one in the entire world that
does, but there used to be, gosh, five or six!), and a set of kana
characters for the tens and tens of Japanese who need to run a TRSDOS
compatible machine.  At any rate, true ANSI terminals also have special
graphics sets.
   So in theory, a BBS could translate from its own system's terminal
codes to those of the remote user "on the fly."  I have seen this in 
limited use on C-Net, which supports Commodore, Skypic and ANSI
graphics, but the only boards that actually seem to put this to use
(except for mainframe operating systems) are remote Z-System boards,
which usually know 50 or so different terminal types and let you do
neat things like "point and shoot" at the files in the current
directory that you want to download, because it knows your terminal's
movement, highlighting, and usually arrow-key commands.  Of course,
there are only about 50 Remote Z boards out there and most of them
have absolutely useless BBS programs (you think the TRS-80 version of
PBBS needs help, you should see the CP/M program that goes by the
same name).
   ...at any rate, MS-DOS bashing aside, you'd think that if a BBS
could do that on a computer with 64K running an 8K DOS and a 20K
BBS program on a 4 MHz Z80A, that the 600K+ Remote Access BBS could
figure it out, too... considering that on Z, that's a function of the
8K DOS, not the bloody BBS program!!!

Actually, it would seem if you foul up in a position like the one you
and Turtle are talking about, the strike still goes through and you get
shot on the spot for insubordination.  (You have to figure that at the
point when a retaliatory strike was deemed "necessary," the end of
human life -- especially if your particular life happens to be at a
military base with nuclear armaments -- is already given.)
   As for the purpose of a retaliatory strike, in a very real sense,
the purpose of it is to never happen.  (That does make sense even if it
doesn't sound like it on the surface: the idea is that side "A" won't
fire on side "B" if they can assume the retaliatory strike will be
equally devastating and unavoidable, which was the entire premise of
the nuclear arms race.  I think it's reached a point where it's kind
of moot -- at this point, we literally have so many missiles that some
of them are targeted at /individual people/ in the USSR: any one
missile could level Moscow, and while redundancy may be a good thing,
there are over 260 aimed there in the current "worst case" plan.  When
you're talking numbers like that, it really doesn't matter if side "B"
has twice the number of warheads -- it means they can blow up all of
your cities 20 times over whereas you can only blow theirs up 10 times
over.)

The movie of DUNE isn't a terribly good indication of the content of
the book -- it's kind of like a Readers' Digest condensed version
rewritten by someone on drugs (David Lynch).  The full movie was about
3 and a half hours long, but it was edited to 90-odd minutes by the
studio who didn't think audiences would have the patience for an
"epic" movie.

The kana are 64 Japanese characters that are a subset of the actual
language, developed to make life easier for typists and computer
operators (not to mention computer programmers).  The TRS-80 is the

  A film called "The Longest, Most Meaningless Film In the World" was 
cut down from a number of hours to one and a half hours. Also, in a 
pretty lame example of changes, the film "The Goonies" was eventually 
brought down to about 1/3 of the original screenplay after 2/3 of it was
actually filmed. The theatrical version lies somewhere between 1 and 2
thirds.  
   
  Also, on the subject of "Dune", the TV version was "restored" to a 2 
1/2 hour length for TV.

I was unaware that Dune was even made into a tv movie.  I saw it on 
or theater I'm not sure which( it was quite a while ago).  In any case,
I was not that impressed with it.  Now Star Trek Next Gen.  on the other
hand is pretty good.  (for a made for tv show) 
I like sci-fi (new stuff not twilight zone crap) like Star Trek movie(s)
, Terminator, Predator (really high quality junk).  BTW have you seen 
the ORIGINAL 'Something Is Out There' pilot for the series that aired 
last year. The pilot was good but the series was lousy.   In all cases 
above, its all just mindless entertainment.

You know, the attitude that "the media is responsible for all evil" is
one that has really ticked me off through the late '80s.  Perhaps the
reason reporters are often of a liberal political bent is that they've
been exposed to a lot more of the real inner workings of politics and
don't have anything to gain from playing PAC-type games like politicians
do.  At any rate, the media has a bias because the media is controlled
by human beings with their own opinions.  The conservatives who rail
against how much better things would be with the news programs, papers,
magazines, etc. if they weren't so liberal -- and the liberals who say
the same things in reverse -- are missing something very important.
The alternative to media without political opinions isn't a mythical
"neutral" media...it's no media at all.  Personally, I'd rather have
CBS News, Dan Rather and all, than Radio Moscow.

The TV version	 of "Dune" cut out some of the scenes actually in the
theatrical one (not just simple editing for TV censors, but whole
scenes); it added some of the footage, but basically it was just under
2 hours of actual film in "Dune: The Long Version" when you cut out all
the commercials.  As to the quality of the TV one compared with the
original, unreleased movie, it's perhaps telling that David Lynch
removed his name from the credits....

"Dynamic Comics" was an advertising slogan.  Originally they were
"National Publications," and their sole comic title was "Detective
Comics."  When National ceased publishing anything but comics and
added several other titles, they became "DC."  They were never called
"Dynamic Comics" as a corporate name, though.

It is interesting to watch Peter Jennings followed by Dan Rather -
it sometimes seems like they're covering completely different stories.
And folks will watch the one that suits them - I accept as fact 90% of
what Jennings says, while my mother swears by Dan Blather. Likewise
she really believes what she reads in Time - mouthpiece of liberals the
world over. I used to like US News &WP, but gradually recognized for
the conservative propaganda that it is. I agreed with many things there
but disliked being spoonfed Reaganism no matter what the man did or

Turtle reads Time and Insight, between them the most liberal and the
most conservative of the mainstream news publications, and generally
gets a good idea of what's going on (it's sometimes more telling to see
what magazines /don't/ write about than to look at what they /do/...).
Of the magazines I'm familiar with, Time generally strikes me as being
one of the best, along with Newsweek. I wouldn't touch Useless News &
World Distort for half the money that's being wasted on the SDI thing.
(Well, actually I WOULD; I am, after all, perfectly willing to sell out
for sufficient monetary incentive...)

This is to the person who wrote about Star Trek:TNG.  
My personal opinion is they should have stayed with the original
Star Trek.  You can keep the next generation.  Like I say 
"Classic Star Trek; Who needs a next generation? ".  It seems to 
me that all they did was gut the original and refilled with new
lower quality characters.  "Same shit;different day."  ==
"same scripts; different cast"
  IE:  In Star Trek III: The Search for Spock Kirk used the self-
destruct mechanism to defeat the Klingons.  Now would anyone want 
to tell me how many times Capt. Piccard has used(Stolen) that 
ideas?  HMMMMMMMM.
Character replacement time:
Capt James T. Kirk = Capt. Piccard and Commander Riker
Spock = Data & Troy
Scotty =Jordy
Chekov = Wesley (The worst replacement I've ever seen)
Uhura = Worf
Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy = Dr. Crusher
 Point being   Riker is a pompous idiot who holds his chest out too
far.  They simply can't replace the original cast.
Troy is probably the only saving grace of the show.  She does add 
a nice touch to a very dissapointing cast.
I think the producers were just too cheap to pay the salaries of the ori
ginal cast.  Poor excuse for no giving the public what they really want.

1) I'm sure that using the self-destruct is SOP if your ship is about
to, or has been, captured by enemies.  I'll admit that Captain Picard
would probably use self-destruct is a stray dog was found on-board.
2) Captain Kirk does not = Captain Picard and Riker.  Picard isn't as
rash as Kirk, and Riker isn't as daring as Kirk.
Kirk: "Okay, everyone who is important beam down to this very dangerous
planet."
Riker: "Hmm...we'll only beam down half of the bridge crew."
3) Spock is no where close to Data.  Data want to be human, which makes
his character very interesting.  [Insert S ---^]  Troi has four things
going for her that Spock never had.
1) She's female.
2) She has a decent haircut.
3) Her costume is /much/ better than Spock's.
4) She's got two very nice...eyes.  :)
5) Scotty=Geordi.  Well, it's a damned big (and complicated ship).  You
can't just say "Gee, we had an engineer in the last series, let's not
use him again."  Scotty had better lines, and usually pulled off more 
amazing things.  "Captain, I've wired the matter-anti-matter through my
bagpipes, we can use warp now."
6) Chekov=Wesley.  I'm not fond of Wes, but at least he doesn't save the
ship as often as last season, and having someone younger on the show can
be interesting.
7) Crusher has /nothing/ on Bones, except maybe being better looking.
Bones had neat lines like "Spock, your a doof" and "Damn it Jim, I'm a
doctor not a UNIX hacker."
8) Uhura=Worf.  I think not.  Uhura sang every now and then, and she was
strictly communications, where Worf fires the big weapons and tells guys
that weigh 100 pounds to go beat up the bad guy.
 
Having the old crew back on would be a bad idea.  "Ha, I've got you now
Klingon scum...ouch, my back, my back...ouch."
Scotty: "Captain, she can't take much more."
Jim: "Is the ship breaking up!?"
Scotty: "No Captain, it's yer hairpiece, it's losin' it's hair."
 
Sigh, that's all I've got to say.

  Did you watch the same show? I have NEVER seen a "news" story on "A 
Current Affair". They do storys on stockbrokers who go broke hiring 
hookers, a dog that calls 900 numbers on the phone, a guy who claims he 
is Buckwheat, and (last, and certainly least) a story on a scandal where
a mayor is having an affair with a country singer.

  So that those of us who like the show with better special effects and 
new characters can have fun. Not to mention most of the shows in the 
third season and the shows so far this season have been MORE than well-
written, they've been spectacular. And this week's show looks like a big
event, since we get to meet Data's  character.  
 
  Just to tell you. When TNG started out, some of it was blatant rip-off
but now, it's become its own entity. It's a well-done show, and it's the
highest rated one hour syndicated program out there (behind "Wheel Of 
Fortune" and "Jeopardy" for higest all)... Some people don't like it, 
but then again, some people don't like Twin Peaks, either. That doesn't 
change anyone's opinion of it.
 
  All that your message shows is tht you haven't given the show much of 
a chance since it started.

 Twin Peaks is a really odd  show about a town in the nortwest US. In 
this small town, there are small scandals and all sorts of odd things 
going on. The main focus of the show so far has been "Who killed Laura 
Palmer?" and that should  be ending soon... The main character /I/ watch
the show for is Special Agent Dale Cooper,  quirky FBI agent. He's "the 
whole show" in the words of someone in TV Guide...

  Well, everyone, listen up. It seems that in order to persue some of my
current collections, I've got to unload some of the stuff from m
previous ones...
 
  So, the following two collections are fair game if you wish to ask if
I'll part with some items.
 
 1) I have the entire 36-issue run of Marvel Comics' "The Thing" if 
someone is remotely interested in it. The Time Machine didn't  want them
(big surprise...they're pretty recent).
 
 2) And I may part with some items from my collection of Kenner Star 
Wars items...if there's something you are interested in, let me know...
 
   Now, I can post about this stuff in some other places and count the 
non-responses that come in... I think the chances of selling some of 
this are about as good as the chances of hell freezing over..

Yes, yes, and only on my girlfreinds breath.  
  
  But seriously, (streches) this reminds me of the time that I was going
accross country (driving from KS to FL) and I stopped at a roadhouse for
some coffee (I used to drink it, when I was younger).  I sat at the 
counter (next to this trucker dude) and I ordered "Coffee, with 
cream and sugar."
  The trucker next to me looked over and said, "Why order the coffee?"
  What he meant was if I was going to get cream and sugar in it, why
bother to get the coffee (it covers the taste, y'know?).

the same age they were when Star Trek was first broadcast with 
today's special effects and writers) would be better then the cast 
they have now. Thank you very much.

I deleted the message on flag burning because I wrote it under mistaken

Well, sort of. At its peak (c. 635-529 BC) the New Babylonian Empire
extended from what is now the western part of Iraq through Syria
and into the southern portion of what is now Turkey. It also covered a
small part of northern Iran and a portion of what is now the USSR.
However, it only reached this extent /before/ the Jewish Exile (at
around 597 BC). During the Exile, the New Babylonian Empire extended
eastward only about halfway into Iraq.
 
Your point?

And coffee is a foul, nasty thing indeed to put into it. It stands to
reason that caffeinated coffee is better than the decaf kind, but that's
rather like saying roasted cockroaches with chocolate sauce are better
than the ones without. Caffeine is, after all, the only reason a sane
person would drink coffee to begin with.

I used to be an ardent fan of the old Trek and didn't care too much
for the Next Generation, until I really started watching ST:TNG. The
production qualities on the new one are better, of course; but the new
show generally shows a bit more thought going into the scripts than
Classic Trek did. For example: You do /not/ send your entire command
crew (Captain, First Officer, Chief Medical Officer, Chief Engineer,
and frequently Chief Navagator and Helmsman) down into a hostile
situatin together. Dumb, dumb, dumb; oh my yes. Captain Kirk is a
good brawler but not a terribly effective /captain,/ and he violated
the Prime Directive and his own professed ideals on a more or less
routine basis. I also haven't seen any really /boneheaded/ ST:TNG
episodes yet to compare with Original Trek's "Hippies overrun the
Enterprise and take control," or "A bunch of kids overrun the Enterprise
and take control," or "A bunch of 20's gangsters steal the captain and
first officer."  Even the new Enterprise seems to be more logically laid
out than the old--and more habitable, too.
