Xenophobia is fear of strangers or fear of anything different from
yourself (for example, fear of blacks, fear of gays, and the like).
The fact that there may be genetic predispositions toward behavioral
trends has nothing to do with nonsense like a "link" between blacks and
crime. 'Crime' is not a single basic behavior pattern or reaction.
Fear, anger, and /basic/ drives can be influenced (not controlled!)
by genetics, but complex behavior (like robbing cars) is not. Also,
a genetic predisposition does /not/ mean the person who has it will
behave that way, any more than a person with a predisposition toward
addictive behavior is going to become an alcoolic. It still takes
something in the environment (generally) to 'trigger' the behavior.
(There is also no known or suspected genetically-influenced behavior
trait that's limited to members of one particular race; most
behaviors of that sort aren't even limited to humans!)

No, they're not.  Athena was the goddess of wisdom; Hecate was the
goddess of magic.  Only the same if you take a Zen approach to the whole
thing and say that all of them, along with all other female deities,
are all avatars of "the" Goddess.

> Of his later works, I like Stranger in a Strange Land the most...
 
When people attempt to divide Heinlein's works into "early" and "late,"
it's usually based around his stroke, which happened around 1970.
"Stranger" was written before that, so it really isn't one of his
"later" novels -- even though it was very different in tone from most of
the ones written before it, it had a lot of the philosophies that were
undercurrents in them.  Most of the ones written after "Stranger" were
rehashes of that original theme.

Hear, hear!  I wish more people would realize they're overpriced, badly
designed computers backed by a company with the most egotistical We Are
Everything attitude ever seen in American industry.  Thanks, but no
thanks.  I could put together a software package, comprised mostly of
public domain & shareware utilities, that would bring MS-DOS up to
near the level of Z-System, but it'd still be missing a few extremely
useful things and would take up about four or five times as much disk
space (and not run appreciably faster than a 64180 or Z8400-based Z
computer unless it was installed on a 386) -- but a lot of people
wouldn't use it, because (and I am not making this up) it would be TOO
CHEAP TO BE GOOD.  Come again?  That's right, a program that doesn't
have a three-digit pricetag can't be useful.  That attitude, combined
with (a) the solution to slow program execution is a faster CPU and
(b) the solution to bloated program code is to buy more memory, is what
IBM really deserves credit for.

The publication date is February 1st (NOT January -- this issue came
out November 1st, and it's a quarterly, not a bimonthly!).  The months
of publication are listed in the indicia, and it's always going to be

A friend of mine,(non-BBSer) feels, and I agree, that we should legalize
drugs.  The government could pay off the national debt in no time, and a
save money on drug enforcement to boot.  Also it would get rid of many
of heavy drug-users  though overdose.  Make drugs affordable and 
plentiful, users buy more, overdose and die.  I know then you have to 
deal with all those dead bodies.  But look at the benefits.
   Who knows, maybe people would actually brighten up and stop using
drugs.

The best version of Prolog I've found was the one made by Borland.
Like their Turbo Pascal, they've made quite a few changes to the
language, but it's much faster than any other Prolog out.
   The Japanese really love Prolog. One of their companies made/ will
be making a machine whose assembly code will be/is Prolog! (To me,
that seems a waste of chip space.)

I've heard of Prolog; most of what I've heard about it isn't that
positive. It's excellent for expert systems, but it's not really
flexible enough for real AI applications--all of Prolog is an extended
If...Then...Else statement. It's also available for a lot more
platforms than supercomputers and IBM's.

something interesting. They never do it when they're being watched,

Atari already makes one, although they don't sell it in this country.
It has as many processors as you can afford and fully configured is
just a hair faster than a Cray supercomputer.
 
If IBM makes this device, I'm sure they'll manage to screw it up
somehow. The IBM RT is a good RISC workstation botched by a bad
operating environment (it can run a Unix clone, but only as a satellite
task under RT-OS!) and Micro Channel Architecture. Running a RISC
machine on Micro Channel is like hitching a U-Haul to your Corvette.

It would be interesting if IBM came out with a transputer, but I suspect
they'd screw it up if they actually did.  Oddly enough, Atari has had a
transputer on the market for over two years using the T800 architecture;
you can drop in more CPU boards and it becomes faster with each one
plugged in.  I think it takes 5 of them to equal a Cray II, which works
out to about $25,000 -- less than a top-of-the-line Compaq Systempro.
    The catch is that Atari doesn't sell it in America, even though they
are an American computer company.  In Europe, the Atari 16/32-bit
computer line outsells MS-DOS machines and there are Atari Transputer
Workstations out there in universities and some corporate installations.
In America, though, you can show somebody an Atari TT -- 4 megs of RAM,
a 25 MHz 68030, higher-than-SuperVGA graphics, stereo music, both Unix
and the native DOS (an enhanced version of CP/M-68K) -- and they'll
say, "Atari?  Didn't they make Pac-Man?" and dismiss the computer
without looking at it.

It's "Mythagoras," which is a science fiction/fantasy/comics magazine
with a focus on anthropomorphics.  It is edited by and features work by
several people floating around the local BBS scene, as well as some
nationally-recognized small press writers and artists.  The current
issue is #3 and there are no back issues available currently, although
both 1 and 2 will be printed again in 1991.
 
> Where can I get a complimentary copy to see if I might want to buy one

Um, well, basically, nowhere.  Our normally limited budget is at this
point extremely limited, and even in the best of circumstances, free
copies are generally reserved for trades with other 'zines, reviewers
and for soliciting contributions from writers and/or artists who may not
get a chance to see Mythagoras otherwise.
   Issue #3 is on sale at The Time Machine in Bradenton (in Southwood
Plaza on	 U.S. 41, about 3 miles north of the airport), with a cover
price of $3.95.  It will also be on sale at any furry party.

"Soylent Green" was NOT a ridiculous movie.  It may have had some
problems, but on the whole it was one of the best science fiction
movies produced to date, one of the few genre works that doesn't assume
sf has to be escapist and that the best "future" movie is the one that
asks you to turn off your brain for the duration.

IBM bought the patent on the transputer. (Really!!!) but Atari still has
manufacturers rights. And supposedly some R&D people from Cray are now 
in the tank with IBM. So maybe.... you never know!

Cats blampf. It's a more abrupt form of translocation; voompfing is
nothing more than moving very quickly; blampfing is teleportation.
Other things blampf too...like cars...late at night...don't ask.

RufusCon II is now officially set for December 8-9, 1990. It will
probably run through most of the weekend (the last one did), so
arriving after work is no problem. Most likely the 'official' starting
time will be around 6 PM. Stay tuned for more details!

Can't tell you. "DADDY would have gotten us Uzi's!" is from a
staggeringly bad horror flick called "Day of the Comet;" the person
uttering the line was a darling 16-year-old girl complaining because
her big sister just stole a bunch of MAC-10's with which to get the
zombies...

Specifically, Stephen Chen, the man who was going to be Seymour Cray's
successor. He and Cray got into it about Chen's design for the Cray III
(Chen wanted to go with a whole bunch of untried technology, like fiber
optic switching circuitry and superconducting Josephson junctions) and
Cray was afraid that putting that much untested technology in one
machine would be asking for grief. Chen now heads up IBM's super-
computer research team.

  Uh, well, no, not that I wouldn't want to. It's because A) it would

movie on tape.
 
  Of course, this doesn't stop you from gettting the tape and throwing
toast and water around SOMEONE ELSE'S living room. In fact, I /want/

Yes, it was in fact "Night of the Comet," I believe. The main characters
are two teenage girls who survive the effects of a comet that turns
almost everyone else into zombies; they steal some MAC-10's (which
throughout the rest of the show keep jamming, hence "DADDY would have
gotten us Uzi's!"), and wreak mayhem on the nasty ikky zombies. It's
a good movie.

Yes. Robbing cars occurs far more often than stealing cars, and is one
of the most common forms of crime. According to a police officer I knew
in Ft. Myers, they would get about five reports a day of robbed cars
JUST FROM ONE SHOPPING MALL ALONE, while they usually didn't get five
stolen car reports a week.
 
...sort of makes you a little more cautious, hmm? Leave your car
unlocked and unattended at a mall and the odds of your being robbed are
MUCH higher than most people think.

Don't mean to pry in here, but I had this big cat up in NC that
absolutely REFUSED to go outside....EVER!!! The one time I tried to get
her out for a little sun, she whipped around, latched on to my bare
chest with all ten front claws and hung there...scared to death. Last
time I ever tried to make any animal do what it didn't want to.
What do you think would make a cat be such a home-body? hmmmmm....

  Did Heavy Metal ever make it out on video? Can't say as I ever saw
it around. The rag was the basis of the movie and being a looong time
reader, I was a little let down by the flick (hoping too much for 
Mobius stuff everywhere). Just came across about a four foot high
stack of back issues in the attic. Ended up sitting up there reading for
a few hours....family couldn't find me....oh well!

I didn't say it wasn't entertaining.  I said it wasn't a good movie.  It
was a ridiculous plot, it did havea good cast though.  It severely 
lacked originality but that was   the idea.  Also the play on words was 
taken, in my opinion, to the extreme.  I will say it had its good points
but mostly bad.  For that reason I haven't seen 'The Naked Gun' with
L. Nielson.  I've heard it is similar.

  As a matter of fact NO, it isn't. The tape came out GREAT. It will be 
at the Furry Party too, if anyone feels a strange impulse to watch it 
(Rufus suggested that I bring it, too.) Also, you mentioned stereo. Well
the copy of Heavy Metal had SOUND that was shot to shit. It was SLP 
third generation. The movie was good though. On Rocky Horror, a FULL 
sound remix was done. From the original mag (magnetic audio) track and 
the studio music masters, a full Chace Surround product was created. 
This is nothing short of a great achievement, considering the original 
film was mono. Unfortunately, my copy is mono. But, since the film was 
that way in the first place, ya won't miss anything!

  Having seen almost all those films (didn't see any of the Monty Python

what I saw of "Summer Rental". "European Vaction" was pretty mediocre, 
but the original was funny. "The Naked Gun" is CERTAINLY up there with 
"Airplane!" though. And while I liked "Dragnet", there is /no/ way its 
in the same class.

My apartment is staggeringly easy to find. All you need to do is get
on US 301 and head toward the airport. If you're coming north, you
will pass a SuperAmerica (on the left) just before you get near the
airport. Right past the SA is a traffic light; turn into Shadowood
Apartments at the light. Follow the circle around until you find a
weird-looking grey Baja Bug. Building 12, unit 1895. If you're going
south, go past DeSoto (that's the airport access road) and keep going
(about a quarter-mile) until you find the traffic light I just mentioned
in front of Shadowood. Nothing to it!

>What makes you think you were being tapped?
 
Well, some of my users started having a rash of muting failures when
they called (if you've never seen one of these, they're kind of unmis-
takable, and a dead give-away. Every now and then the modem that's
being used to montior the phone, which is a complex beast because it
needs to be able to sync with a dynamic carrier (1200 baud & up) with-
out sending out its own clock pulses, will screw up and cut into the
line. When that happens, the person who's logged on will get a string
of uppercase U's (like UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU, sometimes several lines of
them) and suddenly everything that user types just gets echoed back
without DOING anything. The user is connected to the tapping modem, not
the BBS.). Also, there's a weird hum on my line indicating a ground
fault (meaning whoever tapped it didn't really pay attention to what
he was doing), and if I dial a phone sweep I get a steady sound.
 
Can't really say why I'm still being monitored. It is GTE's policy to
tap any line that they believe has a BBS running on it for a few
weeks in order to find out if the sysop is profiting from it (charging
for access, running an online store, whatever); if he IS, GTE can nail
him for a business-rate line ($35 a month more than a residential line).
I've been tapped continuously for almost a year now; possibly they
think I'm subversive?

Many moons back, I nearly broke up with my wife-to-be when she asked
me to explain a Leslie Nielson joke to her. When I told her that humor
like that must be caught on the fly, and is ruined if analysed (uh), she
miraculously 'got it', and now laughs when I do, whether she gets it
or not.                     THRUD

  I have /never/ liked those. We had one back about five years ago. If 
you're a fan of real stereo, those Radio Shack do-dads aren't very 
satisfactory. You aren't going to get real channel separation, just a

Great Danes are cool dogs, but sadly, due to their size and breeding, 
they usually don't live as long as other  dogs and are prone to many 
problems when they near the ninth and tenth years of their lives.(like
hip displasure, which can cripple the dog. and It is a rather sickly dog

will enter the store.  Ask about a piano, have you demonstrate every one
in the store, make requests,(I don't know any Barry Manilow lady!) ask 
for the price, take out her checkbook, (YEAH!!!!!) then notice some girl
walk by in a sweater and say. "I wish I could wear that color..." then 
get up to ask where she found her (The girls) shoes then disappear for
ever! WHY WHY WHY WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY! AAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUURRRRRGGHHHHH!!!!!

Here's something to talk about:
  Should the AK-47 be baned as a hunting weapon?
 
  Some facts:
1. The AK-47 is not a machine gun (aka no 2000 rounds per min. etc.)
2. It is SEMI-AUTOMATIC, which means it will shoot as fast as you can 
pull the trigger.
3. Almost all hunting rifles are SEMI-AUTOMATIC, but their clips do not
extend out the bottom of the gun.
4. Does that mean that all rifles should be banned? Or just the semi's?
5. Should SEMI-AUTO pistols be banned?
       Here's the topic, how bout some posting?

   Simple. They don't really want to buy an organ. They just want to
waste some time listening to Barry Manilow.
     
   Something unusual that's happened with women? I really can't give
anything unusual about women as a whole -- just individual incidents
with some women I've known.
   <Hell, most of the 'incidents' I'm thinking of happen to the girl-
friend of one of the occasional users of this system -- one that many
members of the system know about. I doubt they were typical. And I
don't want to embarrass that user.>
   
   Why does my girlfriend always try to get me to play guessing games?
Her voice occasionally gives off a sound of "something's wrong between
us" -- and until I mention this, she'll say nothing? And then, when I
ask, "Is anything wrong?" she says, "Not really..." And then I have to
continue pushing to find out what really WAS wrong... (Occasionally,
it WAS important enough for it to have been worth it. But not always.)

Hunting should be banned, regardless of whether or not you're using an
AK-47.  Killing other creatures, even if they are not sapient to the
degree humans are, for "fun" has always struck me as being very close to
the same ethical/moral level of a torturer who enjoys his work.  If it's
the thrill of the chase a hunter's after, he can damn well use a camera,
and I won't care whether his Nikon is automatic or not.

I'm using ZCOMM again mostly for the humor value.  It prints the row and
column of the cursor on the status line, for reasons I still can't
fathom, and prints a constantly-changing number which appears to be a
buffer count for no reason at all.  A few days ago I got a blotzed
sector in a YMODEM transfer.  Does ZCOMM print a normal error message?
Noooo, it printed:
  Sector 112 Retry 0 : Noise Burst Detected
  Sector 112 Retry 0 : Got 23 for sector ACK
  Sector 112 Retry 0 : NAK on Sector
  Output Flow Control Restraint RELEASED
 
...your guess is as good (probably better) than mine.
 
At any rate, I just uploaded an archive which contains the newest
version of DELZH4, along with LZHUF4, which actually creates LZH files.
It's written with the same C compiler that ARC4 was, but it's 16K
instead of 30K (50K w/overlays) and only requires 64K... no idea how it
does in terms of speed, but it can't be worse than ARC4's crunching
algorithm (can it??).

I do play the string (acoustic) bass (I think I said I was classically
trained, didn't I?) but I no longer Own one, (Florida humidity does bad
things to acoustic instruments. It got VERY expensive to maintain)
  
>things to put into a relaxing potion other than chamomile and cloves?
     Sure! Here's a few:
 
Catmint
Cowslip
Hops
Melilot
Mint (pepper)
Poppy (wild) (this is not the type used for heroin, that's the White
Primrose
Valerian
Woodruffle (sweet)
                 Any of those will work well when made into a tea.
Be very careful with cloves, they smell nice, but they are toxic.
Prolonged use of cloves will make you very ill. 
                    Any one else want a herbal cure for something?
                                       Peace

No actually we're all subversive in one way or another.  I'd like to 
have my own board. That could be taken with a subver. slant on it.

Strip racing is racing stripped.
Drag racing is racing in womens clothes.
