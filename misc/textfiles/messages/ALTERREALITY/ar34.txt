A conservative is a liberal who got mugged yesterday. No, I'd really
rather not have voted for Mr. Dukaka, The Most Boring Man on Earth.
On the other hand, your side has Jesse Helms, the man with the direct
line to God, the purveyor of common decency everywhere, the man whose
role models are Archie Bunker and Idi Amin, the man who only just
recently was caught secretly funding white supremecist organizations
in his home state... I think I'd rather have Mike.

Didn't know there was a group called Futz. That's pretty funny. The word
"futz" as in "futz with it" is Beetle hacker terminology; "Yep, soon

How do I /really/ feel about the New Kids? I don't know; never given

Rufus, dude, we got problems. Um--there's someone here who's psionic,
and, um, I think you should wake up now." He shakes the prone insurance

Do you have faith in anything that hasn't been verbally, personally 
addressed to you?  I understand that it is hard for some people to 
accept that the Bible is the Word of God.  It goes back to what you want
to believe and Christians (for whatever reasons) want to believe that
the Bible and everything written is from God himself and that they
should obey what He has written.  Have you ever read the Bible and what 
part or is all of it bullshit to you?  As a Christian, I should try to
convert you, but I'm afraid I would be up against more than I could 
handle......now, if Turtle is a Christian, I know he could "save" you.
I agree, Turtle has an envious quality for expressing himself.

I have a question for you?  What if you found out that someone you
really, really loved and cared for was a homosexual?  Would you retract
anything you have said and would your feelings remain the same?  I
have the same opinions as you have expressed (they are my very own 
opinions though) and have agreed with you on almost everything, except
the Bible.  This weekend I found out that my "little" sister has had
an ongoing affair with another woman for a long time.  This broke my 
heart and I am very confused.  I still maintain that it is a "sickness",
but that is hard to admit when it is about someone I love so much. I
don't think there is a "cure" though; it is just like alcoholism, unless
she admits that she has a problem, who can help her?  Certainly, not me
as I'm as "normal" and old-fashioned as they come.  BTW, my sister is
a VERY intelligent and beautiful woman.  I really can't go on with this 
right now as it hurts to even think about it. But, I was curious as to
if you were in this position, how would you feel?

Why?  She needs your support.  You have to learn to accept people with
their warts intact.  My folks were dazed and confused when my next to
youngest sister went to "live in sin" with a man that is as old as our
dad!  Since my sister and I have always been very close my mother wanted
me to "talk" to her.  I asked my mom: Does he beat her, does she love 
him?  Does he love her?  Are they happy?  She replied "Iguess so to all
of them" so I said - "then leave them the hell alone!  There is enough
misery in a person's life without those you love the most adding to
the problems!".  I would say the same to you, my friend.  She is still
the same person, merely a different facet of her has been revealed.
She can not change what she is.  The very best she could do would be to
hide it or fake it.  Both of which would take a tremendous toll on her
personally and condemn her to the personal hell of hypocrasy.
She needs your love and acceptance.  Be a *real* brother and not just
a biological sibling.

I`m reluctant to put them on my hard disc (which would take an hour of 
reading to figure out how), which is full of stuff I'll eventually have
taken off and put on floppies.  I guess what I`ll try is erasing every-
thing on the disc except PKZ110.EXE and running like your suggest.  I`ll
let you know if it works.  While scanning files I don`t remember seeing
a PKUNZIP but if I do, I`ll try it.  Will it work by itself?

Let us try to remember that use of terms like "faggot" is not likely

Were Turtle a Christian, it's unlikely that he'd attempt to "save"
anybody. I think you may have inadvertently hit a vital point when you
said that Christians /want/ to believe the Bible. After all, it promises
immortality, which is something many people want so badly that they will
willingly accept almost any statement if by doing so they can be con-
vinced that they'll get it.
 
I am curious about two things. First, you claim that you are a
Christian, which makes me wonder how many other faiths you've been
exposed to. Did you become a Christian after examining a number of
belief systems and deciding for yourself that Christianity was the
most likely to express the nature of man's relationship with the
divine, or are you Christian because that's the only religion you've
ever seen and by some happy coincidence you believe you've found the
truth in the first (and only) place you looked? Secondly, Christianity
tells its adherents to witness and spread the word, but it does not
instruct Christians to win converts at any cost. The Specialist has
already indicated that he has been exposed to Christianity and has no
particular desire to be saved; would you attempt to do so anyway, over
his objections, if you were able?

The fact that your sister is involved in a relationship with another
woman does not change who she is, does it? I would maintain that for
love to be genuine, it must also be unconditional; you cannot love
someone if and only if that person believes the same way you do or makes
the same decisions you would in that position. Is your sister happy
where she is? If so, what is more important to you: her happiness, or
her living by the conditions you've established? Why is it necessary for
you to believe that homosexuality is "sick," rather than simply
different? I don't know how helpful this message is; but personally
I would say: Either you love her, /completely/, or you don't. She has
made her own decision; if she is happy with it, by what right can you
not be happy for her?

I became a Christian when I was 12 years old; it was the only religion
I had been exposed to.  I have been exposed to other religions over the
years, and I am very happy and satisfied that my beliefs will give me
eternal life after this "life".  I believe it is the true Christian's
obligation to convert non-believers.  I trust Matthew 25:46:"And these
will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal
life."  If I was able, yes, I would try to convert The Specialist, and
you, too!
Here's one for anybody to go with:  Keep in mind that I am an environ-
mentalist.  The careless hunting practices and the destruction of nature
and habitats make me ill.  But, there is a certain irony to this concern
for animals.  While we spend millions of dollars and hours of time to
ensure the continued existence of animals, we fail to do anything about
the eternal destiny of people.  I will continue in my efforts with many
organizations to save the whales, manatees, elephants, etc.; but I would
also like to spend some of my time and energies saving God's human
creatures.

I was really  trying to get The Specialist to respond to how he would
feel or if he would change since he is so dead-set against gays.  This
is not to say I don't appreciate your message.  I have accepted my
sister's choice, maybe because it has been suspected for some time now.
I guess what bothers me is that it is "out of the closet" now, which,
by the way, does not make her happy.  My love for her is genuine, not
conditional, but now she is not happy because some asshole decided to
make her living conditions public - in a very dispicable (sp?) way, I
might add.  I am worried about her, as I think she chose this way becaus
her past experiences with men were not pleasant,in any sense of the
imagination.  I have got past my initial reaction of repugnancy and, as
I have said, I doubt I will make any more slanderous remarks about gays.
When it hits so close to home, the scathing comments hurt more than just
one.  I'm not sure, but I think The Lady hit on this point a week or 2
ago.

  Is there something REALLY subtle about how all this was used? Seems 
from that description, the film would be a good case for the anti-rock 
religious groups...
  But anyway, call me a baby, but I don't like any sickening violence. 
Would the film include any dismemberments or something? Could you please
elaborate on "/very/ suggestive"? All I've heard about the film is 20 
minutes of sex and a meat grinder... I've also seen part of "Another

"The Wall" (the film) is intense, imaginative, and classic.  The animat-
ed sequences are brilliant.  The entire film is thought provoking and
startling.  "20 minutes of sex and a meat grinder" is obviously a
description from someone who has never seen the film since it makes no
sense in that context (N.S. alert).  There are no scenes of "sickening
violence."  If you havent seen it take the time to watch it.

Not necessarily.  Every season has its dogs.  The same season that both
"Beauty & the Beast" and "Max Headroom" were on, so was "The Charmings"
and "Full House," which is, sadly enough, the only survivor of the
four (although I don't think it's returning next year).
   At any rate, there could be some interesting stuff turn up, and maybe
it'll even last more than a season (very rare for "genre" shows, alas,

Hmm.  Steve Vai's music hasn't struck me as terribly innovative, just
technically proficient.  The /real/ innovation would seem, by
definition, to be with people who are trying at least to sound
different.  As far as new groups go, I can't think of that many really
innovative ones, with the exception of Animal Logic.  To varying
degrees, I'd say over the years the Alan Parsons Project, Flock of
Seagulls (the ones Depeche Mode sounds like a disco version of),
ELO, Fleetwood Mac and Pink F. have been pretty innovative, along
with lesser-known groups like Shadowfax, Renaissance, Clannad, Steeleye
Span and the like.  And possibly Jethro Tull and, of course, Roxy Music
and Bryan Ferry.  While I've never been completely sure how innovative
Rush is musically (they vary from extremely imaginative to slightly
annoying), they've certainly got most groups beat lyrically.  But
Steve Vai?  Good guitar player, but he's no Malmsteen.  Or Parsons,
Peart, Fleetwood, Waters, Lynne, Ferry or Sommers.

We're not spending money to ensure animals' "eternal destiny," if by
that you mean something other than continuing to exist in this world
for an indefinite period of time into the future.  And we are most
certainly doing the same thing for the human species; 99% of our
actions are geared towards that goal.  I have often heard people ask,
"How can you care so much about animals and not about humans?"  These
people fail to realize (or choose not to see) that it is not an
either/or situation.  Everyone works towards the preservation of
humankind; some of us have to work to make sure the rest of humanity
doesn't survive in the short term at the expense of the ecosystems.
   The local squawk about the moratorium is a good example of this.
Yes, CRS (the opposing group) is right, it WILL cause the loss of
jobs.  A lot of what they are saying is exaggeration (for instance,
most of our economy is tourist-based, and anyone who believes that
tourists pick their destinations based on the county's rate of growth
has a few screws loose -- the tourist traps and beaches will still be
here regardless), but they're right, the moratorium WILL hurt.  What
they ignore is that the current growth management plan really does
suck as badly as GEO says it does, and the problem won't go away until
actions are taken to protect the remaining environment that DO
"negatively impact" the construction and growth industries.  The longer
we wait, the more urgent the choice will be, and the more damaging it's
going to be when it finally is made.  If we wait until we have no choice
at all, it won't be a very pretty sight.  On some summer days over
Tampa, the sky is as smoggy gray as it is in Los Angeles.  At the
current rate of growth, 10 years from now it'll be that way every day in
Tampa...and you'll be seeing it on hot summer days here.

of "200 Motels" with posters (in both I think). Even got an album

Welp, open dem things in your face called "eyes" if you can't relate to
your post. You referred to (Post #7033) to "how in the hell did you
manage to include bona-fide criminal acts...". My last post, which you
seem to fail to comprihend (maybe read it again), is asking you how
you can judge something on the basis of societies determination of what
is or isn't a "bona-fide criminal act". Maybe I'm loosing you at what
your definition of a "crime" is....well, what is it???? Or is society
making that judgement for you???? I wsas pointing out in my last post,
that some "illegal acts (ie crimes)" are quite STUPID by morale 
standards (at least mine) and the majority of the discussions here are
based on PERSONAL ideas and beliefs, not social ones. If you care to
discuss legal stupidity, well, let us know. And as far as an 
"abomination and crime" that means something you hate which is against
PUBLIC law....huh???? "Crime" itself is a social issue, not a morale 
one. If you wish to follow topics, let's ALL do so.

I can understand that you believe you've found the Truth with a

to convince anyone else that your Truth has any validity. I think
your intentions are good, but I don't really think you have considered
the fact that for all your conviction there is a very real possibility
that you are wrong. I also don't think you realize how arrogant it
sounds for you to say that you want to "save" people who don't believe
the way you do, as if you know God from personal experience and he
himself faxed you his personal plans for mankind just yesterday after
dinner. I don't see anything in your religion that's particularly
convincing; in fact , I would say that some of its major tenants are
very dubious. The idea that Jesus dies on the cross for man's sins makes
no theological or philosophical sense; the need for God to judge man
is not filled by an act of man against God, no matter how appropriate
a "perfect sacrifice" seems. This entire idea would have philosophical
validity only if the person who died on the cross had done so by God's
hand, not man's, neh?

A bigot is one who judges other people, as a group, based on a single

on their sexual preference. A gay basher, therefore, is a bigot.

This obviously isn't true.  I have no tolerance for lima beans and
country music, but that doesn't mean that I have no tolerance for
anything else.  Something that has apparently never occurred to you is
the concept that it's possible to like a homosexual/bisexual person
without approving of that aspect of their personality.
 
I think I can say safely that I've known a lot more homosexual and
bisexual people than you have (or at least been aware of their sexual
orientation) and I can state for a fact that the "stereotype" of all
gay males as lisping pantywaists or gay females as butch bikers isn't
true.  Yes, I've met one or two lisping pantywaists.  A friend of mine
in California who moved out there specifically to live with another man
(whom he now hates, but that's a different story), on the other hand,
used to go around with his girlfriend through the seedier parts of Tampa
looking for skinheads to beat up.  He's pretty good with knives now,
since he's been in over a hundred knife fights.  And he's as far away
from your stereotype as you can get.  The first homosexual female I met,
on the other hand, had a lot more in common with Paulina Poriskova than
she did with the "Roseanne Barr in leather" image.
   I also noticed you didn't respond to my plea to actually THINK about
what I'm saying.  I know that it is, truly, easier to rant than to ask
serious questions about your preconceptions and prejudices, but it is
disappointing to see someone as intelligent, and usually reasonable, as
you are refuse to consider the possibility that you might be wrong on
this point.

Dating an athiest isn't so bad.  As for the New Kids, "wholesome" they
may be, but let's face it, they make the Monkees' "work" on the original
TV show (before it got cancelled and they tried, albeit with mixed
success, to become a real rock group) look scintillatingly innovative.
Would't /thoughtful/ alternatives to "the garbage in the world" be
better?  New Kids songs are still about puppy love and/or puppy lust,
and challenging the pop icon of a great love life as the ultimate height
of existence would occur to Paula Abdul and George Michael long before
Donnie and Joe ever get a clue.  Even Donny Osmond stopped singing that
sort of stuff (and stopped looking like a smurf who shops at Chess
King); if Donny Osmond can get a life, there's no excuse for the New

I still haven't figured out whether Eide is as brilliant as you can get
in local politics or he's a basket case.
   I don't think an acceptable compromise can ever be reached with CRS.
Despite their name, they aren't "Citizens For Responsible Solutions,"
they're "Developers Against the Moratorium."  They've spent an amazing
amount of money telling us why the moratorium is a bad idea, to the
point of wild exaggeration (their budget is literally thirty times that
of GEO's, so they can afford to) -- but they haven't come up with any
alternative, except "Give APOXSEE a chance."
   APOXSEE's big claim to fame is "concurrency," the idea that you can't
build in an area until a public utilities infrastructure is in place.
Fine.  Tell me how this is supposed to protect the environment?  It
means that when you knock all the trees down and destroy the ecosystem,
you're doing it to build the roads and lay pipes first and THEN put up
the buildings instead of the other way 'round.
   I don't know what's going to come of the moratorium proposal, but if
it's defeated (which I expect it will be), it won't go away.  To stop
growth to a point where it'll have any measurable effect on the ecology,
there will have to be a conscious choice for the environment when the
question "Which is more important, maintaining the status quo for growth
industries or protecting our natural resources?" -- and this will mean
that some people will be adversely affected.
   As for how long you (or anyone else) has, Swiftmud has estimated (but
not publicized) that the water table in the Tampa Bay area, given the
present rate of consumption combined with the present rate of growth, is
likely to be unusable by the turn of the century.  Token water
restrictions notwithstanding, there's a small but real chance you won't
get anything the next time you turn on your tap.  If growth isn't slowed
drastically ASAFP, EVERYONE'S in trouble, not just builders.

Currently, I am attending a brethren church.  I grew up attending and
being a member of the Congregational Christian Church, and attending a
First Brethren Church with my grandmother on occasion.  I have also
attended a Lutheran (due to first marriage "obligations", although I
only put up with that for about 3 months!), a Baptist, and a First
Methodist.

I have no faith.  Turtle remarked to me that an agnostic could be 
influenced by a monotheistic belief.  Ok, so I probably am.  Yet, 
I feel that something (not 'things') had to come first...like, who
created Turtle's 'gods'?  
Actually, I have read very little Bible...but I don't see the point of
wasting my time on something which I am not convinced about in the 
first place.  Kind of circular reasoning there, but then it's circular
to want to read it, too.  "I want to know, therefore I'm willing to 
believe this."  That doesn't prove anything.
  No, I don't like to believe anything that hasn't been proven to me.
Proof.  I NEED proof.   I will accept circumstancial evidence, 
occasionally.  But even that has to be verified in some manner.

  Man jogging in the park (before the Bush/Dupa election) gets accosted
by a man with a handgun.
  "Who you would you rather have as president?" the hood growls.
  The jogger shifts nervously, not answering.
  "Who do you want, Dukakis or Bush?!"  the man points the gun.
  The jogger makes a face, and then lowers his head.  "Go ahead and 
shoot."
 
  Besides, that incompetent cowardly liberal would never have taken the
stand that Bush has on that maniac in Iraq...he'd have backed down. 
But, that's a liberal for you...take the easy way out.  Never mind if

Let me define something for you and Turtle.  The word "no" as an 
adjective.  No=none.  No apples, means you haven't got any apples.
UNDERSTOOD?
 Good.  Let us continue.
  
  No tolerance means no tolerance.  For anything.  He didn't say,
"limited tolerance", niether did he say, "selective tolerance",
he said NO tolerance.  UNDERSTAND?
  Good.  Let us continue.   (Stop me if you don't understand something.)
  
  He said that if he had "NO TOLERANCE" that he would not associate with
me.  BUT...if he had no tolerance, then he would have no tolerance for
gays, because he would have NO TOLERANCE for anything.  Is this a rough
point?  Understand?  (Like I said, stop me if I've lost you....)
  To continue... 
  
  I said that if he had no tolerance, then we would agree so,
so, saying that he would not associate with me would be wrong, because
we would be agreed.  So, he would associate with me, because we would
be in agreement.  (Am I making this simple enough?)  We would be in 
agreement because I have no tolerance for gays, and so would he, in
that case. 
  
  THIS was the entire point of my JOKE, yes, it was supposed to be a

Crispan played with his empty bottle.  No one seemed to be paying much
attention to him, for which he was greatful.  They might have thought
he was having a heart attack a few minutes ago, though the casual 
observer probably would have attributed it to the proximity of the
bomb detonation.  He was sure however, that there had been massive 
mental energy expended close to him because the sensation of it was like
a shotgun (do these people even know what that is?) going off in his
head.
  He looked up, past the haze of lingering pain, and watched the on-
going events.  Mulligan was evidently perterbed about Rufus
fainting, and probably more perturbed by the sudden appearance of a
personna non-grata working on his only witness.
  Crispan debated telling the Captain that he was a special operative,
but decided that could wait until the Captain was a little less 
occupied.  Or at least until this headache went away.
  He raised his hand.  "Xon?  Xon?  Could I please have some pain

Hey all, I'm looking for a DB-23 (Like the 25-Pin RS-232 type, just 1

If anyone comes across one, please tell me ... tanks...

Ghods! The last thing I want to do is defend Jordan Knight and his
band of traveling pimples. Especially now, cause my coffee pot refuses
to work and I'm drinking my wife's instant decaf <gag>. However, each
generation seems to despise the music of following generations, and 
each new generation strives to make their's as different from their 
parents as possible. My grandmother did not approve of my mothers 
infatuation with Frank Sinatra. Then she went bugshit when Elvis
came along. Damn few mothers encouraged their daughters to fall
for Paul McCartney. And what about the poor souls who had the 
misfortune to be teenagers when the BeeGees and John Revolta were
hot? I am not comparing musical talant here - 'cause each generation
will determine their own taste. What I'm saying is that silly little
girls will fall for whatever "greatest new sensation" comes along.
I have thought of locking my daughter in her room and making her
listen to Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull til she sees the light, but  I
don't think it will help, anymore than when my father sneered at
my Zepplin and Yes tunes way back when. Hopefully, NKOTB will go the 
same way as the BeeGees and ....um......can anyone think of some big
disco stars?

Well, why don't ya do it?  I've been thinking of doing that to my
sister, but she's never around.  She's a Janet Jackson fan, not to

I crack YOU up?  Interesting.....I'm disappointed in your messages today
lots of one-liners!  Are you pouting?  I doubt it, but don't.  You are
one of the reasons I log on to this board.  Ralph Waldo Emerson keenly
observed, "In every man there is something of which I may learn of him,
and in that he is my teacher."  I believe that and I think it is true
even in our worst critics.  You may be prejudiced and may (I said MAY)
miss the mark by overstating your case.  Your remarks may arouse a
natural antagonism (as Turtle's did to me yesterday,BTW).  Yet most
of your messages contain more than a grain of truth.  Maybe criticism
should remind us all that PERHAPS our actions and motives do not appear
as pure and worthy to  others as we think they are (after some contem-
plation last night, I think that is what was directed at me yesterday).

  Well, the lazy days of summer are almost over (back to school soon, 
bummer)... I was just sitting here flipping through the useless programs
on our 50 channels of cable TV, and a couple thoughts occurred durring 
commercials.
  First of all, I saw a commercial for a program called MS-DOS Literacy 
that you could order. Isn't "MS-DOS Literacy" a contradiction in terms??
  Then, I saw the red haired guy who does the Montgomery Ward ads... I
wonder if he ever looks back on his carrer and wonders. I mean, he was 
kissing  Michelle Pfifer 12 years ago on a cancelled TV series, and look
where she is. He's doing Montgomery Ward ads...

All right, then I had the two (B&tB and Max) reversed in their time
slots -- B&tB came on at 10.  I could have sworn it was the other way
around, though; I believe both Miami Vice and Dallas were on at 10, and
Dallas was /after/ B&tB -- and Max was competing with both M.V. and
the ten-gallon soap opera for ratings (in fact, there was a reference to
that in the last regularly-aired episode, after they learned they had
been cancelled).

I have no idea whether or not Dukakis would have "backed down".  The
idea of liberals that most conservatives have is truly more offbase
than the idea of conservatives that most liberals have.  They are
supposed to be political ideals, not ways of life; this country was
founded in a liberal tradition.  In fact, the founding fathers were, by
the standards of the time, radically left-wing.  Yet obviously they
weren't afraid to fight.
 
Don't paint the US involvement with Irag in glorious "defending the
world" colors.  If we hadn't gone over there, it wouldn't have been
backing down, because we weren't attacked.  We're there to defend
economic interests -- nothing more, nothing less.  I suspect Dukakis
would have sent in troops, as well, since they are there to be a
deterrent.  Bush doesn't particularly want to use them, either; it
doesn't take a liberal to be worried about involving U.S. troops in
a war that isn't ours after Vietnam.

> I am not wrong.
 
Yes, you are.  You quite obviously didn't consider my plea for a
minute.
    I can understand your reticence to continue the thread.  But through
the entire thing you have never ONCE defended your belief that it's
wrong to associate with homosexuals and bisexuals on the grounds of
their sexual preference.  You've made it abudantly clear that you don't
LIKE their sexual preference, yes, and that you think the act(s) in
question is sick.  I've come to the conclusion that you CAN'T defend
this part of your argument.  It's more comfortable to drop the
discussion, blaming everyone ELSE, after you realize you're in a logical
dead-end.  It's much easier to hide your head in the sand than allow
the possibility that YOU might be wrong.
 
> I will not debate perverse/not perverse with you any more.
 
That ISN'T WHAT I'M DEBATING with you.  It HASN'T been what I'm debating
with you for a very long time.  What I am debating are your reasons for
deciding that, say, a friend whom you've known for quite some time and
like a great deal becomes a leper outcast unclean if you discover he's
bisexual.  I'm not talking about ACTS, I'm talking about PEOPLE.  I
don't like the ACT either.  Some of the people who do it, I happen to
like very much.  Some of them you might like, too, but you wouldn't be
willing to give them a chance, even knowing that they weren't going to
make a "pass" at you or act like a Saturday Night Live caricature of a
gay person.  THAT'S what I've been trying to debate with you.  I'm not
ASKING you to approve of the act, or even to stop thinking it's sick.
I'm asking you to explain why that instantly negates anything else good
about a person.

Actually, this message was responded to in some detail on Tyler's board,
the Armadillo Connection.  My argument would be that Reli isn't a beast
any more than an elf in a Dungeons & Dragons world would be; she is a
cat, yes, but not significantly closer to a "real" cat than humans are
to other primates.
 
I have assumed they don't shed very much, probably no more than a normal
12-pound cat does, simply because it would make life a lot easier if
they evolved that way.  Reli is a short-hair cat, although her fur is
very soft.

"Grumbles From The Grave" is a collection of RAH's letters edited by
his wife Ginny that was published, oh, about a year ago.  Pretty inter-
esting stuff if A) you are a Heinlein fanatic, or B) you are interested
in the personalities and politics of the publishing world during the
"golden age" of science fiction.  Of course you can borrow it as long
as you swear on your mother's soul to take good care of it and return
it within a years time.  And /ignore/ any remarks Black Magic makes
about my promises to loan books...its /her/ fault she never got "A Box

Hmm. I'm not sure encouraging a nationwide obsession with the New

all that wholesome an alternative to letting said young children
learn how to interact with real people. Plus it absolutely makes me sick
that the New Kids are being raved about as though they're absolutely the
greatest thing that ever happened to musical expression when they
wouldn't know music if it bit their choreographed asses.
 
Incidentally, you absolutely sure the New Kids are as Godawful perfect

And what, pray tell, is wrong with atheists???
