A 40ms hard drive is fine for a BBS that probably isn't going to be
transmitting stuff at more than 2400 baud to begin with, but I suspect
for anything else it would become rather annoying rather quickly--
particularly since AmigaDOS never was noted for its speed even in the
best of circumstances. I'd say if the trade-up to a faster hard drive
were available for the small price Tyler was talking about, it'd
probably be worth the investment.
 
Of course, I also have an inherent distrust of hard drives from the
start...

I do, in fact, have 6ms floppies. Trouble is, I have a really good CP/M
C compiler that was written with a Cromemco machine under C-DOS,
using some funky double-sided format that none of my alien disk format
utilities can recognize (it claims to be standard C-DOS DSDD but it
ain't, so I can't get to it...and I don't even have access to the
Cromemco machine that wrote the floppies in the first place). Such is

good approximations. Quantum physics says that any "laws" one comes up
with -- no matter how accurate -- can ONLY be good approximations.
The physical laws never were laws. Ever.

>And what about the theory that the planets are just atomic particles
>in a very very very large other system.
     
    Uhhh..... right. There are similarities between atomic particles
and electrons (they both revolve around something in the center),
but there are HUGE differences:
    1. Electrons are "fuzzy" in the sense that they don't really exist
       in any one place. They're more wave than particle. (Look up
       De Broglie (sp?) for more info.) Planets, so far as I can tell,
       are solid -- and not spread out.
    2. Planets seem to keep to the rule: one planet, one orbit.
       In the first orbit, atoms have two orbits, then they have six
       orbits, then ten. (Unless they're excited -- which I'm not
       getting into.)
   
     3. An atom is unstable when it has more electrons than protons.
        (Generally.) This solar system has nine (or more) planets;
        one "proton" (of a sun.) In a miniaturized world, this would
        be H-9 -- a REAL bitch of an element to find. (One person, a
        Wally B. Whatnot, once claimed to have found it. He also claimed
        to know Bigfoot personally, and called UFO people "some of his
        best friends.)
    
   On the other hoof, it's real likely that any chemical laws of that
"superuniverse" above us are completely different than any laws down
here -- so all of my arguments might flop completely. But, I hope not.

Dear Delphi,
   Okay. I'm understanding you, now. Here are my beliefs, agreements,
and disagreements.
   I believe that although spirit is tied to matter, it is separatable
from matter. A dead person -- so far as I can tell -- has no spirit
remaining to animate him.
   Again, I believe in the separation of the Godhood from the universe
itself. If I read you correctly, do you deify existance? That is, is
the sum total of life the god that there is?
   Whether or not other planes exist -- to me seems an insolvable 
problem, given the technology we have now. I can't prove they exist; I
can't prove they don't exist. I will believe in them when I have some
sort of proof: either a creature from another plane stops here and
does something which is inexplicable otherwise -- or, one of us visits
another plane -- or, the need for alternate planes of reality is shown
by a physicist to explain phenomina. I can see no conceivable way to
prove they don't exist -- but I don't consider that sufficient to believ
in them.
   As I've mentioned innumerable times before, I'm a born-again
Christian -- and a little conservative in terms of my definition of
Deity. But, I seek out people who disagree with me -- to help me
define myself and my God further. (Yup! Disagree. When someone agrees
with you, they're not likely to search very deeply within your logic
for errors.) It sounds as if you're a very intelligent person, and I'd
love to contnue discussing philosohy and religion with you.

As far as denominational affiliation, I'm a Unitarian Universalist,
which means we honor the basic worth and dignity of everyone, but other
than that we have no creed. We ask questions. We are seekers of the
truth. Mostly, we seek diversity. That's why I found a philosophical/
spiritual home there -- there's no set dogma and questioning is
encouraged.
So, as for god/goddess, my feeling is that the god-consciousness is
greater than the sum of the parts (all of existence), but not a separate
entity or being. I believe we all (even Plato's chairs) have some of
this god-essence in ourselves and perhaps that this essence is the spark
that gives us both connectedness with the spiritual and independent free
will.
Other planes, which I prefer to call dimensions, aren't that relevant
since we live in this one, although I do believe they exist. I never
considered why because that didn't  Maybe it's worth
thinking about...
What was next? Well, I suppose you'll remindr  (problem keyboard)
remind me. It's good to have dialog about things philosophical, altho
I may be a bit radical for you depending on your view of Christianity.

 2. What the data transfer rate is.
 
 I've got a Miniscribe 40Mbyte (when used w/ MFM) drive that's running
on an Adaptec RLL controller.. The Average track to track seek is about
60ms, but the Data Transfer Rate is 10Mb/S  (That's bits, not Bytes)

A definite statement: Radar detectors are not illegal nationwide. No
way, no how. A couple of states outlawed them when those states raised
their speed limits, and in those states you cannot purchase radar
detectors. In most states, including Florida, posession, sale, and
use of radar detectors is neither prohibited nor controlled. Sorry, 
but to whomever told you Congress made 'em illegal: It just ain't
so. How do I know? Simple. I asked a cop who pulled through

I agree wholeheartedly. Trouble is, Pee-Wee doesn't qualify. "Maximum

wholeheartedly at--at least until I realized that it wasn't intended as
a parody of horror movies. On the other hand, there's only so much

According to a Unix hacker in my Compilers class, the Amiga 3000
is supposed to ship with Unix System V+ (Bell Labs Unix 5.4) as
well as AmigaDOS 2.0. It's also supposed to ship with yacc, uucp,
Open Look, XWindows, and a few other goodies, at least according to
one magazine article I've seen. What was your source of information, 
and did it mention the Unix side of the A3000 at all? (At one point
I even heard rumours that AmigaDOS 2.0 was going to run as a satellite
task under Unix on the A3000, but that's probably apocrypha.) If
the thing /does/ ship with Unix, it'd almost be sufficient to make me
choose the 40MHz version of the 3000 over, say, a DECstation 2100
or Sun SPARCstation I if I'm ever in the market for a Unix

   Face it: abortions are NOT pretty. Even the hardest pro-choicer will
admit (with a little prodding) that you're killing life, and that you're
killing life that could become human when you abort a fetus. As I said

Dear Delphi,
    Please: don't worry about being radical. Several close friends are
Wiccan, and one of my closest is a Caballist.
    To be a seeker of the Truth is a worthwhile occupation, indeed. 
However, it's really difficult to know the Truth about God. As one
athiest said (I'm not sure whom): the finite cannot pierce the infinite.
In other words, our mortal minds could not conceive of the complexity
of God -- whether that God be the whole of existence, or that God be
the "outside of the universe but interacting" one that I espouse.
    Now that we seem to be communicating, we can begin to create our
own language to make things a bit easier. From now on, I'll refer to
"Adonai" (though I'm not Jewish) when I refer to the Christian concept
of a God outside of space who interacts with the universe. (To make 
things really simple.) Could you do the same for the concept of the
whole of creation as a deity? (Something similar to "Nature" or 
"Cosmos," perhaps?)
    
   It's really unfortunate that "dogma" has such negative connotations.
I've learned in mathematics that without assumptions, nothing (well --
very little) can be proven. (From no assumptions, you can prove either
Adonai exists or He does not. But not which one.) To me, dogma are 
merely the common grounds among a religious group: they shouldn't be
thought of as boulders, and the completed works of God, but as stepping
stones or building blocks to a fuller understanding of God. With no
foundation, the house sinks: no meaningful questions can be asked when
people don't share similar beliefs. Only when there's a common, stable
base can the building be erected: only when there's a common, stable
base can there be a church. 
      
   I'm curious: if it's the "spark" of the universe that gives us free
will, why was it distributed so much more to certain entities (humanity,
dogs, banana plants) than others (rocks, earth, moondust)? What, in
these forms attracted the life force so strongly -- or what repelled

this life force so strongly from other entities? I don't see the signs
of life within rocks as I do within people. 
    
   Are other dimensions worth thinking about? Like I said, until there's
been some contact (either way) between dimensions, I won't worry
about it. It doesn't matter. 
   
   I've never read anything by Mary Daly. What views do she espouse?
Have you read anything by C. S. Lewis? (Be REAL careful of his 
assumptions, however...)
     
     Another person (who is NOT a Christian) you might enjoy is
Raymond Smullyan: our conversation might turn something similar to
several of his ideas...

   Seal them? I have two pictures arising from that idea:
     
1.    "Wilbur... Wilbur..." Her voice was tinged with fear.
      "Yes, Mildred?"
      "Wilbur, look outside the window..."
      Wilbur shot a glance outside the window. "Why, Midred. There are
    circus animals out there."
      "I don't care what they are. Just get RID of them."
      When Wilbur left the garage with his shovel, he saw that every one
    of the seals had been taped to a sprinkler head.
     
 2.   "Wilbur... Wilbur!"
      He tossed his head and mumbled, "Yes, Miss Vavavoom. I'd love to
    play Nymph and Satyr with you."
      "Wilbur... wake up!"
      "Huh? What's wrong?"
      "I just heard a high pitched noise, an explosion, and then it
    rained for a few seconds. Go outside and look."
      Tossing his head to wake himself, Wilbur tossed on a terry cloth
    bathrobe, walked down the stairs, and looked outside. Every one
    of his sprinkler heads had been shattered.

Julia Roberts is hot looking. Never realized that before. Rich Gere is

basic storyline. Richard Gere is a rich businessman just like Don Trump
(though I read the other day he isn't as rich as he was). Well rich
is in LA on business and takes his lawyers E'SPIRIT  FOR A CRUISE

a long story short rich hires her to be his bosom buddy for a week
in exchange for 3000 dollars. In short as you guess they fall in love 
and as in almost all disney(touchstone) films they live happily ever

Several people have had problems downloading with Procomm, primarily
because Procomm's XModem file transfer routine isn't worth a revolting
box of bug parts. You have to tell Procomm to use XModem Checksum (I'm
not sure how to do that; you might want to try one of the more IBM types
floating around, if you can find one); there's some manual toggle
between XModem CRC and XModem Checksum somewhere. (XModem CRC will
/not/ work.) Alternately, you might try getting a better terminal
program somewhere; Corwyn of Amber has a couple of good public domain

You might try getting your node number from Steve Hall; he seems
fairly efficient about those things. Technically, the net host for
this area is still Alfie Bruhel (American United Broadcasting), but
he's in the process of being evicted forcibly from that position since
he never maintains his system and rarely bothers even to notice when
it goes down for weeks at a time. Anyway, Alfie went to Germany
recently, and to make a long and nasty story short and nasty, everyone
staged a revolt in his absence and started re-routing all the echo
traffic through Minas Tirith and the No-Name (with the result that there
are now two completely unrelated Suncoast Gossip echoes that don't
speak to each other), and George is the kinda-sorta de-facto acting
net host. What with all the politicking and stuff going on, it's

I agree in part. I DO enjoy going to those movies (really, ANY
movies), but I don't necessarily drag my kids along for that reason. 
Most of the time I try not to because it can be rather distracting
having ruggies pullin' you around durin' the important parts of the
flick. I like to see my kids have fun at a movie, and I already
know all the words to AN AMERICAN TAIL, LADY AND THE TRAMP, DUMBO,
WINNIE THE POOH, NEVER ENDING STORY, THE DARK CRYSTAL, HONEY I 
SHRUNK THE KIDS, BATMAN, SLEEPING BEAUTY and a ton of others I am
bombarded with daily....yeah, I laugh at the movies!!!!

For any who are interested, an exerpt from a letter from Jacques-Yves
Cousteau:
     "When a dolphin mother gives birth, her baby is expelled underwater
.  The first act following birth is critical: to lift the freshly born
youngster up to the surface for its first breath.  So powerful is this
motherly instinct that other struggling animals have been pushed to the
surface instinctively by female dolphins.
      "Surely this blessed miracle of life is the greatest treasure on
earth.  Yet do we earthlings cherish and guard it?  On the contrary.
Each month month we now pour millions of tons of poisonous waste into
the global water system.  Many of our lakes, rivers, and coastal waters
have received their mortal wound.  The water is undrinkable.  The fish
and shellfish, if they exist at all, are contaminated.
      "Is all now lost?  I do not believe it...I passionately believe
that the perceptive few who have the opportunity to see the ultimate
disaster ahead must band together now to warn the slumbering many.
(Is it not always thus?)  Such corrective measures as exist must be put
into effect immediately.  Pioneering research and exploration to help us
better understand the sea and its creatures must be undertaken without
delay.
      "To this new crusade I solemnly pledge what years remain to me."

Taping movies with a video recorder inevidably yeilds disappointing
results: the movie is being projectected at 24 frames per second, the
camcorder is running at 30 fps, so inevidably you're going to end up
with blank frames on the tape or frames that were shot while the 
shutter was opening or closing. (At a minimum, you'll get six frames
a second that are messed up, in fact.) Wouldn't it be easier to simply
"borrow" a print?

Dear C.C.A.,
   A few points of explanation:
   I am a born-again Christian, who believes in the truth of the Bible.
However, that does NOT prevent me from strongly disagreeing with many
things going on with the church. (Jim and Tammy Bakker aren't the only
thing...)
   I have been less "turned on" to organized religion since last summer,
when I helped organize and create a church in Mexico -- then helped
destroy it. (The second was unintentional, but I believe it was really
the will of God.) 
   People who all share exactly the same opinion bore me. I despise
clones. Many Christian churches, however, seem to want to repress the
individuality that God has given us. (Take a look at hair styles around
your church...) Many Christian churches only reach out to the people
they want to be seen with... the white, upper class. 
   Hell, at least, is non-discriminating. There will be thousands of
interesting people. Some hideous, yes -- but probably many people who
considered themselves to be "good." (If you follow the idea that it's
only belief in Jesus that will get one into Heaven.) The thoroughly
evil people might be the most fascinating to talk with: why did Hitler
do what he did? And so forth...
   
    I assume from your comments that you feel you'll be going to
Heaven. I also assume from your comments that you feel Hell will
be a lake of fire (from Revelations.) I have one question for you:
Why should a non-believer accept any of those teachings? (Please, 
PLEASE don't say, "Because the Bible says so." I hate circular 
reasoning...)

Seriously - I really loved my compilers class.  We had to do a machine
that ran "ToyCode".  Then we had to write an assembler for said ToyCode
and then implement a BASIC compiler using the assembler then we had
to write an application that used the BASIC.  My application was a
simple Sieve of Erathonese (sp?).  My buddy and I were gonna do the
whole damned thing in YACC and LEX but there are pitifully few texts

Actually I believe it leaves it's output as 8080 and even has it's own
assembler as part of the package.  I have a couple of translators that
I will vouch for that convert 8080 to Z-80 (which is the only assembler
a sane being would choose).  Take yer pick.  I seem to recall that I was
happy with it's performance but time sweetens all bad things - even my

Deskmate knows no standard transfer protocols.  It's a cute environment,
and can be fairly good for some things, but you need to get a "real"
terminal program to do anything off of PC-Link.
    I suggest you find somebody who can give you a copy of Telix, which
is a "shareware" terminal program.  (It doesn't interface with Deskmate,
but it's fairly easy to use and is pretty powerful.)  There are some
other neat terminals out there for MS-DOS machines but a lot of them
are slow, really big, and overpriced, or any combination of those
three.

If one can use Xmodem Checksum with Deskmate, then one doesn't need
to buy something else... I had to because I did not know any BBS people
personally (at the time) using MS-DOS, and had no other way to get at
the files I wanted. I ended up using Crosstalk for about a year, before
getting on the beta list for COM-AND. I enjoyed the program I stuck
with it after the formal release and through numerous revisions.

If you truly believe that worshipping ANYTHING or ANYBODY is silly ...
then commit yourself and refrain from being an agnostic.  This middle
of the road stance will not get you anywhere.  You will be in a limbo
of your own making.  Either come to the conclusion that God exists or
he doesn't.  I personally KNOW that God exists and takes an interest
in our lives.  I have had things happen to me that simplistic ideas
such as syncronicity and serendipity simply look silly as explanations.
The first step is to look at the evidence which is our Holy Bible.  
(I am starting from the Christian viewpoint because it is the one
true faith of the living God - we can discuss other faiths or schisms
within /orthodox/ Christianity if you like - but for simplicity's sake,
I start with the truth).  The Bible has undergone a test of almost 2000
years.  The literature has been validated and substantiated more than
ANY other other written work in the entire history of mankind as far as
correlation and accuracy (yes! historical accuracy).  Given this 
unprecedented book we must examine a most startling claim that it makes:
It is the written word of the Creator of this universe and it outlines
His plan for His creations.  This is the evidence that you must examine
with an open mind and a lot of inner searching. 
It kills me the number of people that believe that their intellects are
keenly honed instruments capable of infinite perception of the cosmos
and make such a rash claim : "There is NO God!" from the pitiful 
examples of their own lives within the limitations of a most likely
restricted environment.  Most Atheists that I know - can quote the
Bible inside out and know every tiny piece that seems to contradict
some other tiny piece.  Fine - that is what they were looking for and
that is what they found.  I ask that if you really want to know the 
truth for yourself - the read with an open mind.

Whoa, Nellie... Hold me back... Hold me back...
       
   First of all, how do you "know" that God exists? What kind of proof
do you have? If it's personal experience -- are your senses always
correct? (If I gave you LSD, and you "felt the presence of God" while
you were under LSD -- would that be a true experience?)
      
   Even the great scholar Charles Ryrie (ever heard of the Ryrie
study Bible?) Admits in his "Basic Theology" that the Bible has, at
least, scribal errors. (Basic Theology, p. 98, by Charles C.
Ryrie, Sp Publications, 1986) There were at least scribal errors from
the numbers: why not elsewhere?
     
   How do we know that the Bible is the "one true faith" as you
put it? Why not, say, Zoroastrianism? (Which, I might add, was looked
on with favor in your Bible. The first part of the first Chapter of
John might have come straight from a Zoroastrian service. Heck:
MOST of John parallels Zoroaster rather nicely.) It's survived 500
years longer than the New Testament -- and it still has worshippers.
Hinduism goes back even father (but there's no, real continuous faiths
that survived from then 'till now.) Buddhism has lasted some 3000 years,
too...
     
   You say the Bible is historically accurate? I wonder: would you
please prove that any of the miracles mentioned happened? If you
can't, how do you know they were historically accurate?
      
   Face it -- Christianity requires a LOT of faith to believe in.
Even from the start. But, I'm afraid that it's most Christians who
come from the "restricted environment" you were talking about. You
see more Christians in rural areas than in large university towns.

Okay, okay... just looking over the last few messages, I'm sure I
riled up some Christians on this board. I'm sure most of them are
wondering exactly what I'm doing: especially when I mentioned only
a few messages back that I was, myself, a born-again Christian.
     
   I am.
     
I also have not found one shred of evidence to support my belief, in
the sense that I've found many arguments why NOT to believe the Bible.
Anyone who claims to have proofs for the Bible generally get plowed
under by arguments I've been storing up. And I try to say them in
vicious (sp?) enough ways that they can't be ignored.
     
   If there's reason NOT to believe the Bible -- and not strong reasons
TO believe the Bible, why should I place my faith in something so
shaky? SUre -- God may be beyond logic; but mortal minds refuse to
understand anything beyond that. And if not the least bit of Him is
understandable, then He's not worth worshipping. (Ya might as well
worship outer space -- or the tachyon.)
     
   (Some of you might say: well -- parts of Him are within logic, and
parts of Him are beyond logic. Nope. No can do. If parts of Him are
self-contradictory -- the only way He can be beyond logic -- then,
from logic, ANYTHING can be proved about Him. I'll give the proof if
someone asks for it.)
    
   Anyone got a suggestion?

Oooooh! "Let us start with Christianity, which is the Truth." I
/like/ that! At least you don't beat around the bush. But, moving
along from there:
 
First, I am not convinced that you "know" that Christianity is the
truth any more than I am convinced that a Muslim "knows" his faith
to be true, or a Shintoist /his/ faith, or whatever. I know a Wiccan
who "knows" her faith is true just as thoroughly as you "know" yours
is; obviously, at least one of you is simply wrong, regardless of
the fervency of your belief.
 
Second, the Bible has not been validated as thoroughly as you claim.
The book of Esther, for example, is historical fiction pure and
simple; absolutely none of the eventsa described in that book has
any basis in any known history or any correlation to any other
historical work whatsoever. I also find it highly suspicious that
there is no Egyptian historical record /anywhere/ of any of the
plagues or catastrophes visited upon that populance by a righteous
God to persuade the pharoh to leave Moses alone; for that matter, there
isn't even a record of any massive exodus of Hebrews on the scale
described by the Bible.
 
I generally view Christianity on about the same level I do most other
organized religions: it contains some interesting ideas, a general
knowledge of it is necessary if one wants to understand history; but as
a system of beliefs explaining why the Universe is the way it is I
think it has about as much validity as astrology, Islam, or
dianetics. I am interently distrustful of totally self-referential
and arbitrary belief systems, and I have yet to see a single
argument put forth by anyone that will give me any basis whatsoever
for believing that Christianity is any different from any other faith.
I am also unimpressed with Christianity's track record so far--it
has been responsible for more wars than I have fingers and toes,
the destruction of the library at Alexandria and several major
civilizations, and a great deal of misery and human suffering, in the
name of what?

ANY religious structure requires a great deal of faith to believe in,
simply because all religions are inherently self-referential and by
their very nature cannot be proven or disproven. Son-worship may be
more sophisticated than sun-worship, but in the end their adherents
do not subscribe to them for any rational reason at all. As for people
who KNOW (all capital letters) that Christianity is correct: For any
Belief System X, you will find people who KNOW beyond a shadow of
a doubt that Belief System X is absolutely true. The fact that these
belief systems are fundamentally incompatible does not seem to change
the mind-sets or the attitudes of their adherents.

Not any that are likely to be helpful. Myself, I'd say order a pizza
and forget about it, but you'd likely take that as being sarcastic,
which it isn't. If there is a god, then he/she/it hasn't seen fit to
provide humanity with any convincing reason to believe in him/her/it;
therefore, it's kind of a moot argument. Eat a pizza; the rest will
sort itself out. If this particular diety sees fit to damn people

I don't claim to know whether or not there is a god (or God if you 
prefer capitalization) that's what agnosic means.  I /am/ certain 
however that I would not wish to worship the God described in the bible.
It is not a book which I know particularly well, I don't feel it gains 
any significance by being very old yet still believed by many. Galileo
came up against blind faith in his conflict with the catholic church in
the early 1600's. He contended by observing the way shadows were cast 
across the moon, that it was not the "perfect celestial sphere" which 
the church claimed all heavenly bodies were. When he supplemented his
hypothesis with data obtained from his telescope (which was actually not
invented by Galileo, but by Hans Lipperhay) He was accused of creating 
and using "tools of the devil" - Niccolo Lorini. I claim no certainty,
and try to judge things as logically and coherently as possible. I will
not deny the existence of a God, I simply see no point in worshipping 
one if it exists. This is not arrogance, simply the full use of the 
judgement which if a God created me, he must have given me. I will live
my life by my own counsel, not by the instructions of an old book. I
would like to read the Bible through sometime.. and I undoubtedly could
learn something from it, however I will always trust my own judgement 
above that of any organization or doctrine. Mine is not a middle of the
road stance.. it is simply pragmatic.

Hm.  Sorry, still don't see a connection between these.  If any
connection could be made, I would expect it to be closer to the
opposite; Christianity (about the only religion I can think of offhand
that teaches of an afterlife in a way that could be considered an
"infinite extension" of one's self/soul) professes to teach respect for
human life, which is, presumably, why many Christians are against
abortion in the first place--they believe that the ends do not justify
the means, regardless of the mother's wishes or extenuating circumstance
of the pregnancy.  On the other hand, I expect people who truly believe
that taking life is "right"--which is a tough case to support, as almost
anyone (Christian or otherwise) will be forced to concede that killing
is not always a black-and-white issue, even if it is something to be
avoided if at all possible--really don't think much about eternity at
all.

Hmmm... just curious. What are your sources to say that there was
no historical record in Egypt of the (presumed) plagues? Do we still
have ALL of the records of the ancient pharaohs?
       
   Proving or disproving something through history, especially ancient
history, is tough. But -- I wouldn't call Christianity the most warlike
religion. Probably Islam is more so, among the major religions.
(What the first sentence of this paragraph has to do with the second
one is beyond me.)
      
  I would not call Christianity totally self-referential, or arbitrary.
It filled a need during the Roman times, giving people hope of an
afterlife, and has since evolved, filling that need for over a billion
people. 
    
   But -- be kind to the Christians. Though many people have died in
the name of Christ, many great works and deeds were also done in His
name. Most great works in Europe for the past fifteen hundred years
were done in His name. Same with the colonization of the Americas.
So... nyaaah!

Of course most born-again Christians would start yelling the 
teleological argument at you ("Take a look at the order in the
universe! Order has to come from somewhere, right? Doesn't that
just PROVE that there's a Deity Somewhere Out There?" And blathering
on and on...) 
    Then again, most born-again Christians don't see the problems
with the statement: "The Trinitarian believes God is Triunity.
That is a belief gleaned from the Bible. Therefore, he also believes
the Bible to be true." (This was an ACTUAL example of so-called
"good logic" from a book I own.) Class, can we find TWO mistakes
in the above logic?
   The problems with any proof that God exists is that we really have
no unquestionable assumtions to work with -- and any such proof can
be twisted to say that, say, gryphons exist. The basic belief in God
is itself an assumption.
       
   Okay: why believe in Him? The best response I've ever seen was
Pascal's: Think of the consequences. Even if the chances are one in a
million that God exists, it's better to believe in Him. Here's why:
There are four possibilities:
      
   a) God doesn't exist, and you don't believe in Him: Fine. No problem.
       No one will toss you in His non-existant torture chamber.
   b) God doesn't exist, and you believe in Him: Well, you might be a
       bit disappointed when you're reincarnated, but -- heck -- it's
       better than toast.
   c) God does exist, and you believe in Him: Welcome to Abraham's 
       bosom, buddy. The best possible situation for the afterlife.
   d) God does exist, and you don't believe in Him: Toast.
       
  You have no control over whether or not God exists... heck; you don't
even know whether or not He exists. But -- in game-theory terms, which
is it better to do: believe, or not believe?
     
   The only fault in this idea: in WHICH god do you believe?

A thought occurs to me (how rare!).
 
IF God was to provide us with unshakable proof of His existence, who's
to say that proof will remain after a few hundred years?
 
For example, please assume Jesus _did_ rise after His crucifixion (sp?).
Yes, that would be a strong miracle, as it is told in the Bible. Those
witnessing the event would be quite convinced. Technology as it was,
before long folks would _have_ to rely on faith, since there was no
other reliable form of recording history.
 
Now, extrapolate that to today. Were such an event to occur, the 
witnesses would once again be convinced. Word would spread faster,
and the event might even be recorded in a more reliable manner, but
who is to say such evidence (verbal & otherwise) would last another
1000 - 2000 years?
 
I can understand skepticism, but only when viewed with an open mind.
Just as religion requires strong faith, so should skeptics be required
to accept the _chance_ they might be wrong.
 
I, too, am "born-again" and am not pushy about the subject. My religion
is between me & my God. What irks me are those folks who either insist
their way is the right way, without any rational discussion, or who
insist there is no right way, without allowing for the possibility that
not everything _can_ be rationally explained.

Very interesting.  You conclude your message with "read with an open
mind" (in reference to the Bible), yet at the beginning you state that
you know conclusively that God exists.  Further, the God you know
exists is the Christian God, i.e., the one depicted in the Bible.
:   Leaving aside any questions of whether or not everyone would arrive
at the same concept of "God" by looking through the Bible, this
strikes me as a dismayingly arrogant statement.  It reminds me of a
less well-thought-out version of a C.S. Lewis parable, wherein he makes
the claim that all belief systems (except Christianity, of course) are
analagous to different pairs of spectacles through which one can view
the truth.  Different pairs of glasses highlight and distort different
things, but they are all pointing in the right direction--some are just
clearer than others.  Lewis, of course, believed as you evidently do,
that Christianity is the "Light" that people were viewing through these
glasses.  What both of you so blithely dismiss is the very real, and
perhaps most likely, possibility that Christianity is simply another
pair of spectacles.

:  One other qestion that raises.  Do "game-theory terms" provide a
sufficient rationale for subscribing to any belief system at all, much
less one over another?  If "God" exists and a person does not believe in
her, this is only a problem if "God" is as jealous and unforgiving as
portrayed in most of Christianity.  Somehow it seems foolish to believe
that an omnipotent, omniscient and at least partially benevolent being
would be that outraged at a mortal's disbelief in her.

I was not trying to imply that the lack of record of the Biblical
plagues proves that they never happened, although I do find it highly
suspicious that a large number of Egyptian records have survived from
that time and not one of them so much as mentions anything of the
sort described in Exodus. What I was doing is pointing out that the
historical record does not validate the events described in the Bible to
the degree that some people seem to think that it does.
   Islam is, in fact, more warlike than Christianity--but interestingly
enough, it is also (as a general rule) more likely to embrace science
than is Christianity. While the Roman Catholic Church was busy
condemning Galileo as a heretic, the Muslim upper class of the Persian
Empire was busy supporting the sciences, specifically astronomy,
medicine, and mathematics, to such a large degree that /all/ the
greatest accomplishments in that field during the Middle Ages occurred
in Islamic areas of the world. (Of course,m the Catholic Church is hard
at work even now to rectify that situation; why, in 1972 they even went
so far as to acquit Galileo of wrongdoing regarding his claim that the
moon was not a perfect celestial body...) Sure, Christianity on the
whole is responsible for a great deal of good; but is the price really
worth it? Is it really that unreasonable to ask for a religion that
teaches us to respect one another without the "everyone else is damned"
element that causes us to abuse one another?

Problem is, the matrix is too simple. Consider this: God exists,
you don't believe in Him, toast. God exists, you believe in the
/wrong one/, God is insecure about that sort of thing: McHistory. You've
just bought yourself a ticket to the special areas of Hell most

Yeah.. and money grubbing bastard everywhere-and-when will come up with
similar schemes for power of poor schmucks who believe them.

Good point.. but Robert A. Heinlen's "Stranger in a Strange Land" could
also show up in about 2000 years, and start a new religous movement..
who would be able to say that Mike /didn't/ actually fly?

The connection is obvious, dude: if you base your life around a
constant struggle to make it into heaven, the real world will look
pretty bad. Personally, I wonder if it might not be a better idea
to expend your resources trying to make the world around you better
than waiting for everything to get all better all by itself when you
die. ("Once you're past the graveyard, nothing can go wrong...")

I don't think my attitudes toward 286 machines would change if I

Yes, that's it.  How silly of me.  Z-System is an add-on for OS/2.  I
think it requires Presentation Manager, too, doesn't it?

The name of your system didn't appear in that message.  Was it in ANSI

I've got a whole pack of photo's of me in college that would probably 
get me arrested in most states, locked in a pack in a fire proof-locked 
safety box hidden in the house (away from th ol' lady). The bitch
about it is that I DIDN'T TAKE THEM...AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE
NEGATIVES ARE!!! There's only about (hmmmm...how many photos in a stack
2-1/2" high)....oh well....life's lil' mysteries.
