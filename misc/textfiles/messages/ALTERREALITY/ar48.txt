Saddam Hussein is our monster, remember? There was this thing, a while
back, between Iran and Iraq, right? So we decided that the enemy of
our enemy is our friend, and provided assistance to Hussein in his
battle against the dark forces of Islamic fundamentalism, remember?
Gave him money to buy weapons, helped him arrange third-party purchases,
that sort of thing? It7s unlikely he would be where he is now without
that little boost...

I agree. Personally, between you and me, I'd like to see that asshole

fashion. I think that should have been our objective from the start.
If we had targeted him, PERSONALLY, soon enough, we could have avoided
some of this unpleasantness altogether...but the longer it takes,
the more likely it is that there will be someone else to take his place
when he finally gets his. Right now it's pretty much his authority
alone that's keeping Iraq going, but that may change soon...

T> what 's your point? 
    
Did you miss it! Go back and re-read. Remember, you're the one who said
Kuwait could go to hell, not me. 
Also, before you start jumping on me about continuity in government
policies, let remind you that /I/ admitted that people are not perfect.
Hence, our elected officials aren't without flaws.  I'm sure that when
a person gets elected, they don't just automatically become perfect. 
But I must stand behind their decision to go to war. (not out of blind 
faith either, so save that attitude for the Specialist) I simply feel
that we're doing the right thing. 
It seems to me that you are just chalking this war up to a "another bad
decision" made by Congress. Then you sit there a carefully extract from 
your memory past bad decisions to support your opinion.  But when you 
get right down it, you have not offered any /real/ reasons, just 
argumentive one.  "well, we did this before..." We did that, and look 
where it got us."... etc. Give me some concrete reasons of why you think
the U.S. have no right at war.  
But on the other hand, you are right to a point. That the U.S. does like
to play MORALITY POLICE. LIKE I said above, Congress and the president
are human, and I won't foolishly go on record and say ,see, the U.S. 
has a perfect track record.  We don't, not by a long shot.  I think even
the biggest war-wonger will agree that Vietanm was a mistake, a very big
mistake. 
One more thing, stay on the topic this time, War In The Gulf
Don't wander away, stick to Hussien, Kuwait, and the events of the last 
six months. If you do I bet you'd have a hard time /not/ agreeing with
the decision to go to war.  
Have a day.

The issue is becoming a wee bit fuzzy here, if you'll pardon the
potential pun.  (Reli, from "Travelling Music", and my grandmother's pet
Siamese cat, Alexis, could both be called "cute" -- but I'd be using the
word in two decidedly different ways, with essentially unrelated

You mean cats like Alexis, or feline humanoids like Reli?  The first

different way.)

Kuwait /did/ actually belong to Iraq, as I pointed out; unlike your
analogy of Britain trying to reclaim part of the U.S., Kuwait did not
fight for independence, it was arbitrarily granted to them by a third
party.  This doesn't have much bearing on the ethics of Iraq's invasion,
but it's worth clearing up.
    Sorry if you found my response patronizing, but ad hominems piss me
off.  "Those people" aren't supporting the government because they don't
agree with the government's actions.  That doesn't mean that they are
for Hussein, or against the soldiers we have sent over there.  It may
mean that they feel "neutralizing" Hussein is not worth the price in
American lives it will cost.  It may also mean that they felt that the
sanctions were not given sufficient time.  I am aware you don't agree
with these statements.  The fact that you disagree with them does NOT
make those who DO agree "pinkos."
   If it is important to neutralize Hussein, why send 500,000 troops to
do it?  The Iraqi force is effectively being held together by the
charisma of one man.  Remove that man, remove the driving force behind
the invasion.  Sending in our entire armed forces to kill him is like
the Mafia sending 10,000 crack mercenaries to take out Jimmy Hoffa.
If we do NOT go after Hussein directly, there WILL be a long, bloody
ground campaign, because the Iraqis will NOT surrender en masse: they
will wait to be taken out one by one, dispersed to be as difficult to
find as possible and as difficult to remove without causing damage to
Kuwait (and preferably innocent bystanders).  His biggest weapon is the
American fear of repeating Vietnam, and he will follow Ho Chi Minh's
strategy: "For every 1 American we kill, you will kill 10 of ours, and
in the end, it is you who will tire."
   ---
   Of course, this doesn't adequately answer the question of why we are
over there at all.  The question	 is moot now, but I do not think it was
ever clear-cut.  Dictator, schmictator: we don't owe Kuwait anything.

Dictatorships are the MOST susceptible to military coups; look at your
recent history in South America and Africa (and the Middle East, for
that matter).  I think it's hard to conclusively say one way or another
what would have happened if we had kept going with sanctions for six
months.  It's quite likely the effects would have been a great deal more
noticeable, but the only way it would have seriously helped is if the
effects were so bad there WAS a military coup.  (Of course, with
governments run entirely on the strength of one man, as soon as he looks
weak his days are numbered, no matter how strong his supporters are.)

Great.  I'm open to your ideas; what do you have in mind to kill 
Hussein?  Perhaps you can come up with some workable idea.  If we 
send in assassins and kill him, his press releases the statement he 
has gone into hiding, and things continue as planned.  If we kill
him outright, he becomes a martyr and some other cockroach pops up to
take his place.

>Where did you get your handle? 
      Why do you people keep asking me that? Ok there is the real 
version of how I got my handle a few messages back, here's the way it
might have been though...
  
     I get my handle when I was walking through the Selby Gardens, Look-
ing through the Herb garden therein. My friends had said that they would
meet me at the bookstore there at 1:00pm. It was 12:20. I was feelin' a 
little "Uppity" And happened across this wounded Hamster. He seemed to 
have been mauled by a cat. Pittying(SP?) the poor thing,(An also having
an alterior(SP? AGAIN) Motive) I took it into the bathroom to tend it's
little wounds. After bandaging it, I was amazed to hear it say these 
words...:
  "Let Me repay you the only way I can."
I then found out that this was no Ordinary hamster, It was in fact the 
sacred Hamster Whore Goddess, Whoz prompt metamorphosis into Vanna White
left me breathless, and shirtless, and pantless, and after about 30 sec.
of complete bliss, my friends walked into the john and caught us in 
flagrante delicto. Hence my Nickname, Thumper One.

Um...because it's not our war and not our country, and for that matter
not even an ally of ours? I don't see where every act of agression the
world over is our problem, even if the aggressor is Hussein. It also
doesn't help that we're in this for the wrong reasons. If Kuwait
had been a generic third-world country, nobody in this country
would care what hapened to it. The only thing that invoked our interest
in the situation was the fact that Kuwait produces a lot of oil. Don't
EVEN drag issues of freedom and liberty into this; freedom and liberty
only seem to be an issue when the country being oppressed has something
we need and its leadership isn't convenient. Does that answer your
question?

If you insist. The United States has a long history of working itself
into a moral outrage over the slightest human rights transgressions
only when it's convenient to do so. We tolerate the most outrageous
types of abuse whenever we stand to gain from it; look at the shit
we put up with from the likes of Chile's dictatorship because they
say they're anti-Communist. Who cares of Pinochet enjoys doing things
like machine-gunning villages? Hey,he's anti-Communist, and everyone
knows that if you're anti-Communist you must be good! Look at the
outrageous behavior we let Israel get away with in the occupied
territories 'cause they're on our side. If someone else--Grenada, say,
pulled that sort of crap, we'd be on their backs so fast they'd
never know what hit 'em--and we'd feel GOOD about it, too. It
bothers me that this country is as hypocritical as it is about
human rights issues, and it pisses me off that NOBODY ELSE SEEMS
TO CARE. Don't EVEN talk to me about human-rights abuses in Kuwait.
Kuwait didn't have that good a track record /before/ they got invaded,
but they were a valuable source of oil before so it didn't matter.
Moral outrage just doesn't cut it with me, especially when it isn't
consistent.

I have always favored simply assassinating Hussein. His entire war

solved half the problem already, without using two hundred thousand
troops and thousands of tons of high explosives. The simplest

Well, I'm from the suburbs in Pennsylvania myself. We had two qualifiers
built upon the "Yellow Snow" theory that determined your IQ. If you
happened to eat yellow snow, you were "Just a Dummy". But, if you ate
yellow snow that actually spelled out something, you were "Beyond
Salvation". 
Think about it.

Jeez, you have me at a disadvantage, there. I vaguely remember the 
episode, but can only remember the name of the challenge, I think. Was 
that called the Pawn Far, or something similar? I do remember the high
priestess officiating, and remember she was in one or more of the ST
movies, too. About the only other thing I remember from that episode was
that the air was real thin, and Bones had to give Jim a shot of tri-ox
compound to make him breathe better, but didn't tell him that he also
laced it with a drug to make it appear that Kirk died in the attempt to
fight Spock.

  I agree Thump, so far, I have noticed a lot of the rap songs have
used other performers songs and just added their voice to them but
in no form on the cassette(That I have noticed) do I see any credit
given to the true performer. TRUE, a lot of the songs sound better the
second time around but still... the first performer DID make the song
so credit should be given. Thats my point and I'm outta here.

part of Kuwait or even Traq then he will be set. Welp buddy, ,if it
means losing my brother for some oil, then I would rather pay the

to bring us into war. We didn't even have a poll or vote to see if
we wanted to go to war. If this is a country by the people and for the

But don't expect me to share that view.  Sure, there are better systems

But IBM still sets a lot of precedents, are still VERY well respected

Spider Robinson is an extremely good science fiction and fantasy
author, considered by many to be in a league with Isaac Asimov,
Arthur Clarke and Robert Heinlein.  Since he writes more short
stories than novels, he isn't as famous outside the sf field.
   I'm not sure that's a terribly useful comment on the quote from
him, though.

That argument is a bit of a red herring.  The last "cockroach" over
there was Khomeini; before (and after) him there there was Arafat.
Considering Kuwait's absolutely abysmal human rights record, it is not
unlikely that if Hussein had not moved, the Kuwaiti Emir might have
been considered the next roach.
   If Hussein's military power is broken, he will be taken down by his
own people.  A decade from that, a new dictator appears somewhere else
in the Middle East.
 
It can be argued that killing him outright won't free Kuwait.  It can
also be argued that having Kuwait and Iraq as one country isn't any big
skin off our noses.  We get 5% of our oil from the region; there's no
reason for 90% of the forces to be ours.  And "fighting dictators" is
a pretty damn silly argument, considering the Kuwaiti monarchy is just
as anti-democratic as Iraq.  Fighting to restore them makes as much
sense as fighting on	 Hitler's side in WW II would have if Japan had
attacked them.  "Ooh, Japan is a nasty imperialistic dictatorship, and
it's up to America, as the Bastion	 of Fredom <tm>, to protect the
Fuerher from their naked anti-democractic aggression."  This is logical?

is greatly exaggerated -- especially if, during sanctions, he has no
way to import technological items from other countries.  There is no
indication they've progressed at /all/ in Iraq making "the bomb," and
it's not something you can whip up in a few weeks if you don't have
ready access to materials.  (Recall that the only nuclear power plant in
Iraq was bombed by Israel about a decade ago.)

How 'bout Prince's "Purple Rain?" There's a song on it that starts

Y'know, I wonder what Hussein thinks when he sees all the US news about
protesters in the streets, trying to keep us from fighting this war.
Do you think that he might feel hopeful that the protesters would have 
an effect on the US govnt like they did in Vietnam?  Do you think that 
he might believe that if he keeps fighting long enough, that he might
be able to get us out, just because the protesters put pressure on the
govnt?  And with this hope in mind, he will continue to fight.
On the other hand, if we all get behind this war movement, he might get
the impression that this country is unified...so that it is unlikely 
that there will be any pressure from home to STOP fighting.  
  
Protesting in the streets gives a mixed view of what America's goals 
are.  It boosts Hussiens morale.  That is the last thing we need.  
THAT is why protesting is damaging the war effort.
  
On a related note, what do you think it does to the soldiers over there
when they see people protesting what they are doing?  They don't see
people saying, "Get the Commander In Chief to stop this war!"  They
see, "Stop fighting!  Get out of the Middle East!"   Don't you think
that hurts thier morale?  Grrr.  
  
By not supporting the war effort, you are hindering the soldier, and 
helping Hussein.  The US Govnt is going to continue to fight, and if
Hussien thinks that he can wear us down, he will continue to fight
longer...and your protesting is what is giving him that hope! 
GET IT?

Hussein is an egomaniac. He believes he can win this war, because God
is on HIS side. If he saw this entire country unified against him,
assuming he (a) speaks English and (b) watches American TV in his
copious spare time (I ferget, does paragon Cable serve Iraq?), it won't
change diddly-squat. He will still believe he can win. If you truly
believe a show of unification is all it'd take to get him out of the
war, I suggest that your view of the war is somewhat naive.
 
Of course, if you take away people's right to protest as you suggest
then we would have no business being in the war at all, since it would
be clear that your ideals of freedom and democracy are irrelevant.

Hussein is not a typical Middle East dictator. He is the sort of man who
combines intelligence, ego, shrewdness, aggressiveness, and ability in
a way that doesn't come along every day. If you killed him, it's rather
dubious that another person of Hussein's intelligence and aggressiveness
would just walk in off the street to replace him, just like had Hitler
been taken out in 1938 it's very unlikely that someone would have walked
in off the street to fill HIS shoes. Get rid of Hussein, and his war
effort falls apart. It's as easy as that.

Oh, I quite agree there are a number of reasons why we're over there,
most of them bad. There's the economic imperative (we have to protect
a small fragment of our oil supply!), the peace and justice imperative
(this war is for peace, honest!), the liberty imperative (we have to
liberate a country with the worst human rights record in the area, so
that the Emir can come back and set up his secret police again and start
oppressing his subjects, particularly women, again!), the lost
face imperative (hey, what's more important, a few thousand lives or
America's pride?)...why, I could go on and on.

That's right about the Pon Phar. But that's WHY they were there in the
first place, to take care of Spock's mating urge. Now, I remember! The
name of the episode was "Amok Time". And you're right about T'Pring. She
was in that episode and I think the first movie, where we saw Spock 
taking his "final vows" as a true Vulcan, when something came into his
consciousness about being needed by the Enterprise and Star Fleet.

  I can't comment on your musical tastes, since you've never mentioned
what you actually like, but I can agree somewhat with what you said 
about Turtle. I say somewhat because I haven't got too much insight into
what he listens to. I do know that a lot of his tape collection is 
pretty much the same type of music, but I've noticed that he tends to 
like the best of that category. A lot of heavy metal that Turtle listens
to actually sounds good to me, which is pretty odd since I generally
hate it...

Yes, it's quite nice on some things, but difficult on others. For

stores in Pa. But in Ohio, you PAY taxes on things like clothes and some
foodstuffs not taxed in Pa. Also, when I was growing up, you could get
low-powered beer in Ohio at 18 as opposed to 21 in Pa.

Oh well...guess that puts me in my place. I always liked a friend of

"If you love something, let it go. If it doesn't come back to you,
 hunt it down and kill it."
  
Good stuff. My mug just has teeny-tiny-small lettering on one side

And even if he *did* manage to get the message that you were concerned

Problems with AK's?  AK which stands for Automatish Kalashinikov, after
the soviets famed weapons engineer Kalashinikov.  He was wounded (lost
both legs) in a famous tank battle, and later became a weapons designer.
He pioneered the "above gas return tube" now implemented by all soviet
designed weapons.  AK's are not a bad weapon.  They will stand up in
all types of weather, and under all types of adverse conditions!  Do not
get me wrong, I am very partial to U.S. Weapons, but as a member of the
U.S. Army's Long Range Surveillance Detachment, I was issued an AKMS,
and had to Qualify with a wide variety of soviet weapons.  They are
stamped metal, not machined.  They are mass produced for quantity, not
quality, however, I have never seen any of the AK series weapons
malfunction!  Show me a weapon that can lie underwater, in mud, for
over a week, and all you have to do is let the water run out of the
barrel and it will fire!  You'll only be able to show me an AK!
Which is why, the U.S. Army's special units are issued the weapon!
If you have any questions or comments on particular armament, let me
know.  Happy hunting, whatever it may be!  Remember, Why did the 
GRUNT cross the road?    Why to kill something on the other side,

Not a bad setup, even by today's standards--MS-DOS is a direct
descendant of CP/M, and isn't even as powerful as the more recent
CP/M derivatives (TurboDOS and Z-System). Although if you were running
five terminals, you were probably running MP/M (the multiuser,
multitasking version of CP/M). Come to think of it, I don't think
I've ever seen an MS-DOS machine running multiple terminals...

How 'bout the Televideo 802? 640x480 resolution in (I believe) 128
colors, not bad for 1982. 'Course, the TRS-80's graphics always did
suck shit, 'ceptin if you were one of the three or four people on earth
who bought a hi-res graphics card for it. The hi-res card gives you
monochrome (black and green) graphics at a resolution just a hair
better than the Macintosh's, and if you have one you can run all two
or three programs that were ever written to use it.

Even if it isn't, it tastes like plastic from sittin' in the bottle for 
so long.

Lemme telya somethin about Viet Nam...it wasn't just the war protesters
that got us out of Viet Nam...it was also the civil rights movement 
which turned it's power against Viet Nam.  Also, the police were 
responsible for CREATING new protesters with they way they treated the
original protesters.   A great many of the people out there weren't 
protesting the war, they were protesting the way the anti-war hippies
were treated.  The rest of it was civil rights activists.  
 
So don't tell *me* that it was only people who were protesting war that
got the war stopped.   A great multitude were just there to cause havoc.
Again...your protesting ain't gonna do diddly squat for what the govnt
does.

T>How enlightening.  You addressed all of my points quite clearly.
 
And described what you said very accurately.  
 
T>Care to bring any REAL viewpoints into the discussion,
 
Not when you refuse to discuss them in any form of coherence.

I never saw the Televideo 802.  That's why I used the expression, 
"Nothing comes to mind" rather than a blunt "There simply wasn't any".
Y'know, I remember when that upgrade for the TRS-80 came out...it was 
for the model IV, wasn't it?  Not color, though.  'Course, then, niether
was the Mac...

You certainly do have a gift for exaggerating everything I say and do,
don't you?  Just because I would like to see all Americans united behind
the war effort, you misconstrue that I would like to see all protesters
suppressed.  (Which, failing to have all united, strikes me as somewhat 
of a good idea...)

NOx>...on the passing remark...
 
Well, I just happen to believe that Florida beats Pennsylvania all 
hollow....  Just an opinion.  I'm sorry if I had offended you.  Actually
I've been to or through all 50 states (lived in Hawaii two years and 
went through Alaska on my way to Korea) and the one I disliked the most
hadda be South Carolina.  Maybe it's just because that's where I took 
BASIC training.   Or maybe it's because of that horrible twang they all
talk in....
  
Y'ahhhll gowwwin' ta thuh stowwer?  Owr ah meeen thuh Pee  Ehx? 
 
Arrrrgh!  SHUT UP!
 
Course, if you want to talk the most boring, that's Kansas...all the way
across.  "Land of *yawn*zzzzzz"  (Sound it out...you'll see what I
mean.)

No offense on the remark about PA.
All things considered, I think PA is better than florida (Then what am I
doin' here?). The fall season is the one thing I miss the most. Also, 
the state parks have a lot more to offer than those here in FL. 
As for Florida, ya just can't beat the climate.
   I'd like to be rich so that I can be a snowbird and enjoy the best of
both worlds. :)
 
I've also been to Colorado briefly for my brother's graduation from the
Colorado school of mines. It's in the Golden area. Have you ever been 
to Loveland pass? It's really nice there. 
Hmmm.... I've been to NJ, my parents had a house st the shore, and my gr
andparents lived in new Hamphsire.
Hanover is really nice in the wintertime. Oh, I used to ride my 10-speed
to Deleware every now & then too.
 
Whelp, th's all the places I've been.
SEE YA!
