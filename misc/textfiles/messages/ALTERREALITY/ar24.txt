   Just in the past two days, someone was trying to simultaneously
convert me to astrology and Christianity, I've been told that I've been
put on the equivalent of probation (and didn't know it -- and haven't
yet failed a contract...), when I was going to give a recorder lesson,
I walked in on my fellow students all in medieval costume, giving a
lecture; and there were peope outside my door flinging ice cream,
chocolate syrup, nuts (both chopped peanuts and chopped walnuts), and
cherries at each other.

Dear Jonboy, 
   Would a loving God create his "highest form of life" so that they
couldn't understand Him/Her at all? (Granted: there might be parts
that we can't understand -- simply by being creation, rather than 
creators.)
   The problem of evil is a serious one -- and has existed for many
millenia...

But you're right in my book, I've never read anyone who "Did the barb-

"Doomfarers of Coramonde" and the sequel: Starfarers, but he was a

Ahem! The sysop of this board IS a liberal, thank you very much!
That DOESN'T imply any sort of identity with Jane Fonda; I happen to
think that she's a pathetic, simpering, self-important little idiot
whose actions during the Viet Nam War were utterly inexcusable.
Believing that all liberals are made from the Jane Fonda mold is
rather like believing that all conservatives are brainless prats like
Dan Quayle or greedy, self-serving hypocrites like Pat Robertson.
I /will/ state, as a general rule, that I find most liberals to be
less offensive than most conservatives; liberals are less likely to
force their morality on me, believe that wanton destruction of
everything around them is a neat-o thing to do if you can find a way
to profit from it, or in general behave in unacceptable and reckless
manners that are immediately hazardous to my freedom and my physical
well-being than are liberals. Conservatives are generally more
insecure and reactive as a whole than liberals are, as well--if they're
not whining about burning in Hell for listening to rock music, they're
screaming that the Commies are gonna invade us any day now if we don't
get 'em first. Hey, it's an imperfect world.

Now there's an arrogant attitude for you! Perhaps God would never

of life yet. The tool he uses to create life is evolution, and it

Of course, Stevie Gould's only problem is that everything he writes has
the anthropologically equivalent undertone of everything that Bob
Dylan sings: "I'm Stephen J. Gould and you're not."  He will talk about
everything from fossils to, one suspects, way of spreading brie cheese
on crackers as if all the conclusions have already been reached, he
knows them, and now that he's shared them with you, end of debate--if
you think he should even allow doubt, much less consider the possibility
that he's, well, wrong, then you're obviously a deluded, nonscientific
Creationist technophobe.  Evolution IS still "just a theory," especially
when you consider how many different ways people claim the process may
work.  I have seen so many columns where he blithely dismisses any
interpretation of evolutionary data that runs counter to his own that
it's kind of turned me off to the guy; he acts as if God came down to
him, handed him all the noted He made during creation, and thoughtfully
gave him conclusive proof of His Own Non-Existence on the way out.
Being one of those weird sf types, I *like* "what if" scenarios, and I
don't like having Mr. Gould tell me "well, you're an idiot" if one of
those scenarios involves the question, "what if evolution	 doesn't work
quite the way the 1990's scientific community thinks it does?"  After
all, they don't think it works the same way the 1950's community did,
and chances are, the 2030's community will have an entirely new twist
that nobody around now, including Stephen J. Gould, will know about.  He
is the scientific equivalent of George Will: a very good writer of
nonfiction, a good explicator of his chosen field and an admirable man
in many respects, but a pompous twit nonetheless.

Actually, she didn't publicly announce a change of mind or heart.
I have the Barbara Walters interview on tape if you would like to
see it.  She did apologize, but the apology was for the pain that
her actions inflicted, not for the actions.  She did admit her
posing for photos in the gun turrets was not smart.  She still stood
behind her belief that American prisoners were never tortured, though
she apologized for calling the released prisoners liars (there's
obviously a logic flaw there).  In the interview she expressed pride
for her involvement with the North Vietnamese and for her stance
against the American government and is still confirmed in her belief
that the American bombing of North Vietnam was an illegal act and
all soldiers who participated were guilty of war crimes.
    Actually, the only thing she was sorry for, was that people are
still miffed after all these years.  I share your opinion that her
political views should have no bearing on her pursuit of acting.
Yet, it was her prominence as an actress that garnered so much
publicity for her 'cause' in the sixties.  When you take advantage
of your position in the public light to draw attention to your
politics, you've got to expect that people will thereafter link
your political views to your work.

Quite a list of negative conservative traits.  Sorry, I just can't
go along with your expressed ideas.  You are saying, in general,
liberals are good and conservatives are bad.  Do you really consider
yourself open-minded on the subject?  
   This is one conservative who is fed-up with self-proclaimed
open-minded liberals who assume that I am evil because I do not
share their politcal beliefs.  The differences between liberals and
conservatives are based on politics; it is NOT a confrontation between
good and evil.
   On what do you base your beliefs that only one politcal sect holds
the copyright on virtue?  I'm not being argumentative here.  But
frankly, knowing your level of intelligence and antipathy to prejudice,
your post frankly shocks me.  Try re-reading it, and substituting
'negro' for conservative and 'white' for liberal, and you'll see that
that is really on offensive message, one which you would probably
delete from the board.  (We could play this game with any words,
try 'faggots' and 'real men', 'pro-lifers' and 'pro-choicers',

I did go back and re-read Turtle's post trying to substitute other words
for "liberal" and "conservative" and it didn't work for much the same
reason it wouldn't if that had been, say, a Dave Barry column -- the
attributes he was making light of are tagged to a person's political
views, not race, sexual preference or what have you.  I'd also find his
post difficult to take as seriously as you apparently did -- for much
the same reason I'd have had if it had been, say, a Dave Barry column.
When people are being funny, even to make a point, they are going to
be exaggerating things.  If *you* go back and re-read that message, you
might notice it's not meant to be taken all that seriously--I sure
wouldn't, and it's patently obvious Turtle wouldn't, either.
   I suspect the sysop here is one of the more open-minded people you're
likely to run into.  If it was any more open, his brain would fall out.
Maybe it already has.  At any rate, so he's a liberal.  He's a liberal
because he doesn't like conservative politics.  He made fun of some of
the things that can be most offensive about reactionary attitudes.  He
is *not* alone in this.  At least he *does* have a sense of humor about
it; many conservatives I have talked to seem to seriously believe that
by calling someone a "liberal" in a conversation, you can immediately
discredit everything they have to say, end of discussion, and that
anyone who *admits* to being a liberal is slightly to the left of
Abbie Hoffman.  I find this a hell of a lot more offensive than I have
conservative counterparts to Turtle's spew, which I have seen before--
but not often.  Evidently conservatives lack, in addition to common
sense, the ability to laugh at themselves.

You can't make this substitution without changing the entire content of
the message, giving it no relation to the original message.  
Conservative and Liberal are terms to describe a persons attitudes, 
while 'negro' and 'white' simply describe a person's skin color. 
 
If I posted a message saying that, in general, I like Anarchists better
than fascists, would you say it was offensive. I would not be saying 
that all fascists are terrible, evil poeple, just that I believe Anarch-
ists tend to be slightly nicer people than fascists.
 
I don't persecute people because they are conservative, and I don't

Bush, Dan Quayle, et al.. /then/ I will confront them, and attempt to

Anyway, the guy killed the albatross (musta been an NRA member--I

   Oh yeah. Equating all liberals with the Jane Fonda school of

Hmm? Delete an offensive message from the public eye because I don't
agree with it? What a remarkably...well, conservative idea. I don't
engage in censorship, ever.
 
At any rate, I'm actually rather surprised that you actually found that
message offensive (!), and even more astonished that you would seroiusly
consider it on par with, say, racism (I did the "substitute the word
"negro" for "conservative" thing, and it didn't make any sense. Did
you?)...or for that matter, take it seriously at all. No, I don't
automatically consider all liberals "good" (re-read the bits about Jane
Fonda) or all conservatives "evil;" no, I don't refuse to associate
with conservatives or anything equally silly. I was also going to
respond to your message in a much more lighthearted fashion until
I hit the bit about deleting the original; ironically, that is EXACTLY
the sort of "I don't like it--get rid of it" attitude that actually
DOES turn me off the conservative ideal. (There's something remarkably
poetic there...) Anyway, the upshot of this rather incoherent message
is that if you took the original seriously (and I was relieved to note
that the person at whom it was aimed did not), you deserved to.

The substitution parses, but makes no sense out of context.  Do you also
do this to George Carlin routines?  I have seen Turtle's message pass by
the monitor several times and still find it difficult to understand how
it can be taken so deadly seriously.  Yes, it's probable that us flaming
liberals see a grain of truth in what he was saying -- if we didn't, we
wouldn't be liberals.
   I don't honestly see how this can be considered "conservative
bashing."  It pales in comparison to even mild flame wars I've been
involved in, is patently, obviously tongue-in-cheek ("...believe that
wanton destruction	 of the environment is a neat-o keen thing to do" is
Jay Leno commentary, not Walter Cronkite), and when it comes right down
to it, isn't even nice to liberals.  It says they're LESS LIKELY to do
those things than conservatives are.
   This entire chain is following the same logic people use when they
say "The Desert Peach" (a comic about Rommel's homosexual half-brother)
is either denigrating to gays or teaches our children The Wrong Values,
depending on whether the attacker is more liberal or more conservative.
What's wrong with poking fun at conservatives?  God knows I've had to
put up with a lot much more mean-spirited comments when I make such
patently liberal statements as "wouldn't making flag-burning illegal
be contrary to the ideals of the Bill of Rights?"  When a conservative
who wants to "attack" me shows as much creativity as Turtle's post did,
not to mention a decided lack of venom, I'm usually glad, considering
the alternatives I've seen.
   By the way, if you got really offended when you read Jonathon

While you may be very serious about negative stereotypes, (and ethnic
jokes can be a nasty contributor to this) there is still such a thing as
overreaction. Turtle's message, even taken completetly seriously, was
/still/ describing people in terms of their philosophies, /not/ in terms
of some uncontrollable characteristic. By substiting "Negro" <- which is
in itself a loaded term, and "White" You are taking liberties with his
message. Doing so has about as much relevance as substitutuing the same
words for "cherry
                 " and "chocoloate" in this sentence:
 I like cherry, but I can't stand chocolate.
In a nutshell, as Donthen pointed out earlier.. Turtle is a very open-
minded person about almost anything except MS-DOS. Failure to recognize
humor on this board can be dangerous to your sensibilities.

 Theoreticaly, yeah, but they are trying REALLY hard to get something in

for around five or six seasons. After that, they may be doing a TNG 
movie in 1994... There is NO way they will be doing an original Trek 
movie that far in the future. The original cast is getting too old to do
a movie in 1994 or 1995. Concievably, one of the cast members may have 
died by then. 
  Actually, there has been a big controversy in Trek fandom over a 
supposed "Academy Days" movie. This may be a cover up to hide a movie
in production. Paramount actually wants to make the movie, but Gene

  The Enterprise gets attacked in less than 1/3 of the episodes. Besides
that, the cloaking devices would cause the ever-annoyed Romulans to 
think the Federation is covertly sneaking into the Neutral Zone or some
thing like that. Not too good when negotiating peace.

  Well, phasers and photon torpedos are useless unless you de-cloak. All
the time the Enterprise takes to de-cloak would leave them vulnerable. 
Also, they would mainly need it to avoid Romulans. Remember, the 
Romulans invented it. They could detect an inferior version quite easily
...

  Would you tell me why the message was stupid? Anyways, the Romulans 
are notorious for overreacting. If a Federation starship came anywhere 
near Romulan space, they would probably assume it was an act of war. 
Well, they would also assume that if the ship was uncloaked too...
 
  By the way, I never said that ALL the Birds of Prey had cloaking 
devices... as a matter of fact, lemme look at my message.

  Just as I thought, I said nothing about Birds of Prey... 
  Anyway, if you pay attention to the goings-on, the Federation takes 
this stance on the Romulan situation: don't provoke them. Picard has 
gone out of his way to avoid a battle between themselves and Romulan 
ships. 
 
  I don't know why the Federation can't cloak, maybe they just won't. 
Anyways, look at it this way: What use is the cloak? If they are cloaked
while exploring, then they will be [supposedly] invisible to an enemy. 
The Federation can detect a cloaking device. The Romulans should be able
to. The cloaking device MAY be useful in dealing with the Ferengi, or a 
less-advanced enemy, but give me a practical scenario where the cloaking
device comes in handy.

re: skirt-flipping in 'King And I'
   The King of Siam is about to visited by an English delegation
intent to turn Siam into a protectorate (that means they're gonna
grab the country and not let any of the locals hold a higher
position than elephant catcher) because the King is a 'barbarian'.  To
prove that he is civilized the King plans various events, including
presentation of his wives, dressed in proper Western attire.  However,
the ladies have heard the rumors that the English are quite nasty and
eat small children, so they're not too keen on meeting the delegation.
When the wives are presented, one of the Englishman flashes his
monocle (the better to ogle the ladies), and they naturally assume
that it is the evil eye, and flip their skirts to hide from the
evil eye as they rush off-stage to safety.  Of course, earlier it
has been established that in the rush to get things prepared, the
details of providing undergarments had been neglected...

She was still upset over the nasty questioning of the local law

   There seemed no immediate conversation occuring that she could

mood.
     "Once in a time that seems so long ago
      In the midst of a place called the Land of the Dead,
      My withering soul sought a place of repose
      Where my mind could be lost; but I found it instead.
      Where lyrical, spherical denizens rampaged
      With dragons and turtles and wizards without dread.
      Risk was abundant, all bridges were warped
      And insanity reigned in the Land of the Dead.
 
      I knew all of the sub-human creatures that dwelt there --
      The stainless-steel lover, the starry seeress,
      The dark-haired, fiery tongued siren,
      A tall prophet, an empath, a gentle miser, a munchkin or two,
      A foot-chewing beast, a Scholar and a Priest,
      And a unicorn, and me ...
                                and you.
 
      I spent meaningless days there, that meant very much.
      I'd try to move a spider's web and run from the fountain's touch,
      While totalitary individuals battled over the world.
      And though we said Madagascar was the key, 
      We knew the key was our love.
 
      Now I am lost in a Land called Life.
      And I sympathize with souls that perished centuries ago,
      Who knew the glory of Camelot and prayed for its return,
      As I pray for my Once-and-Future Land I left so long, long ago.

The original script for Alien III was written by William Gibson, author
of NEUROMANCER, the novel that effectively defined the "Cyberpunk"
subgenre of science fiction.  If they used his script, there's some
promise.  If they didn't, well...  At any rate, I believe the movie is
being directed by Ridley Scott, which means -- if nothing else -- it'll
have a lot of fantastic panorama shots and bright-lights-against-black

serious enough that Turtle spent most of yesterday mentally wandering

Actually, I was in a Wal-Mart once and I ran into Sam Walton--literally.
It was kinda neat...next time I do something like that, perhaps I should
ask him about the sense of humor department. He drives a pickup, you
know. Putting the horse beside the pickup is better than beating
it at water. People who drink water from glasses shouldn't throw
stones, because a rolling stone gathers no moss. That isn't terribly
helpful if you're lost in a forest, of course, because if the moss can't
grow then it can't grow on the north side of the tree. Moss is always
greener on the other side of the fence. Working both sides of the
fence is generally a rosy proposition, since every rose has its
thorns, and the thorn is mightier than the sword. Party on, dude!

Nope, I had just been to Cobalt [footnote 1].  Actually, I had just been

at Cobalt.
 
Footnote 1: Cobalt is the name of our Prom.  Our 'prom' started out in
the chemistry room as a simple pot luck dinner.  Rumour is that someone
spilled a bottle of cobalt (to bad it wasn't sodium in the punch), hence
the name Cobalt.  Since then, Cobalt has grown into a full blown prom.

Actually the "Post a controversial message, get lots of flaming hot 
responses, and then say 'I just wanted to see some mail fly'" apparently
is coming in fashion, (Specifically Jonboy and Angel) have made /very/
strong statements on this board recently, and ended up responding with,
"Well, I'm glad I got a reaction out of you guys." If you make a state-
ment that is less than obviously sarcastic, you shouldn't make cop-outs
like these.  
 
To Jonboy - Yes, I /am/ open minded, simply because I now hold strong 
             opinions on the matter doesn't mean I haven't looked at the
             questions with an open mind. You still haven't responded to
             criticisms of you "Orthodox Christianity - the only true 
             religion" I'd be interested to hear some kind of reasonable
             support for that one! 
 
To Angel  - Well, throwing accusations like the ones you did around, and
             then claiming "Who said I was serious" is kinda un-nice in
             my book, Heck, /everybody/ knew Turtle was kidding, he 
             /did/ manage to convey sarcasm in the content of his
             post, but obviously, yours failed to do so.  Maybe paying
             more attention to tone and general content /is/ more 
             effective than getting all of your grammer exactly correct,
             something to think about hmm?
 
Anyway, nothing personal here, just having a few problems with this 
"trend" torward the post-and-run attitude.. if you post your beliefs, 
back 'em up!

   Yes, in it's own right "Aliens" accomplished the characterization 
much better. more complex? Yeah, that's true. I liked the suspense in 
the first film. I have never really gotten into the action or horror 
types of films. I know "Alien" isn't a horror film by some standards, 
but I found it scary. Something I don't find in the slapdash films you 
see on late night TV, which just gross me out. "Alien" left you on the
edge of your seat throughout. When I saw "Aliens", I only some suspense 
in the film. It all depends on your tastes. If you wanted more action 
and more everything, then "Aliens" is better. 
  It's not like I hated it, though.

 They do assume it's an act of aggression. It's just that the Romulans 
will handle an act of aggression by destroying something. The Federation
will try to get the ship to go back. If the Federation destroys a 
Romulan vessel, the Romulan Empire is going to start a very large war. 
If the Romulans destroy a ship, the Federation isn't going to run in and
attack the whole empire. This is NOT because they're "chickens", it 
happens to be beacause they handle things without going to extremes. One
casualty is no reason to start a war. And if you still think they're 
stupid for not doing it, then I think you missed the whole point to the 
movie Friday night.

Hmm.  I always find it amusing when so-called biblical scholars
quote pieces of the bible.  usually when one looks up the section they
have misquoted.
that should be 'it appears that they have misquoted it'
 
I find it rather iritating when the 'experts' merely find a line that
supports their point when out of context, and do not bother to see if
it is valid when taken in context.  And then we can add that the bible
is oral tradition anyway, and so it is naturally full of errors.

substandard. If he had axed every person involved with watergate

Now I'm going to have to go dig up my copy to get some more quotes.

>Did you guys decide at the McDonalds Friday??
 
No, we discussed the neat communications set-up at McD's.  We haven't
set a date for RufusCon '90.

It's rather easy to hold a potluck in a chemistry room.  Just have
people bring food into the room.  That's it.  Why have it in there?
I suppose it would be easy to heat stuff, what with all those bunsen
burners [lemme tell ya, it does wonders on fondue!].  And the Chem.
room may have been the only one with a fridge and oven and stove.
