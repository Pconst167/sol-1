Sexual abstinance is also preventing a child from being born, but surely
you would not say that not having sex is the same thing as murdering a
child!! Using the Pill is not murdering a child because you can not
murder something that does not exist. The Pill prevents the woman from
producing eggs. If there is no egg to start with, then you cannot
possibly kill it, huh?

*Ding!*  *Dong!*  *Clank!*   (Uh, I'd better check that third bell.)
    
   No matter how conservative or how Catholic one is, sperm and eggs
can NOT be claimed to be human beings, so birth control cannot be called
murder.  (Besides, the male body already kills off most of the sperm it
produces.)  They do not even have the required number of genes to be
human.

   Are you getting a little Angora about the puns? Fur sure you are.
Should we leveret alone? Have you bunny bit peeved about the rabbit
puns? And do they make your hare stand on end? Are you even becoming
rabbitly mad? 
   Okay, then. I'll stop hopping from pun to pun. Do you carrots a bad
habit of mine. Lettuce join hands and not pun for a while. (But I have
missed some ideas for puns by just a whisker.)

   I never watched Robert Tilton, but I've heard about him.
   I have to admit: I've been part of a healing ceremony among
Christians, and I thought it was a beautiful event.  I was part of a
close-knit Bible study, and one of the members had been hospitalized.
Instead of our normal Bible study, we went to the hospital to cheer him
up, and pray over him. (The leader of the study actually had healing 
oil. I've always wondered what made that special...) He was out of the
hospital five days early...
    
   What's the difference between crooks like Tilton and Bible Studies?
True love, and true caring.

   Ohhhh, damn.  Ohhhhhh, damn.   No wonder you're really worried.
The thing that scares me the most is that first statement of yours: 
"she wont take anything that I say."  If she's not listening to you and
your concerns now, she probably won't do it later in life, either.
I'm sure she's a fine person, but ask her if she can wait for marriage.
Let her get to know you better, before the two of you become married.
If you two are meant for each other, your relationship will grow 
stronger from that.

   Fennec, by not letting every single one of your sperm fertilize
eggs, you're preventing lives from coming into this world.  What of
it?  By your girlfriend not letting every one of her eggs become
children, she's preventing lives from coming into this world.  What of
it?
   If you can lose your virinity and then start being abstinent, you're
a much stronger person than I am.  
    
>I think that birth, believe it or not is beautiful...
    
   Birth is a beautiful sight.  The sight of a new life, of a new hope
coming into the world is a wonderful sight.  But there's still plenty
of time for that in your life.  Would you prefer to see it happen when
you have a secure future, and know that the child will have a welcome
home? Or would you prefer to see it now, when you're not sure where 
you're going to lay your head?

>about.
    
   I'm kinda confused by that statement.  Do you mean, "Life is all
about pregnancy"?  Or, do you mean, "If you're pregnant, then that 
is the most important thing in your life"?
     
   If you meant, "Life is all about pregnancy," I'd say that might have
been true in the Middle Ages -- but not today.  Females can have 
children until they're about fourty or fourty-five; does that make 
every female over fourty-five useless?  That kind of philosophy sounds
to me like living in a circle.
    
   If you meant, "If you're pregnant, then that is the most important
thing in your life," that sounds a bit wrong by me, too.  About sixty
percent of all fertilized eggs (it might be higher -- Turtle? Saavik?)
are spontaneously aborted by the woman's body.  Nobody knows why.

This is actually to Fennec..... 
 
If birth control such as the pill prevents pregnancy, therefore, in your
opinion preventing a child from being born... then you are going upon 
the premis that each sperm, each egg, is a form of life all on it's own.
In that case, masturbation and oral sex would also be preventing a child
from being born...... It isn't life, until the egg meets the sperm and 
they join........

     I think that if you, (Female) are going to get pregnant, and they
actually do want it, the they should feel that the child is going to be

Like hell. The process of bearing children is a nasty one, and nothing
on this earth can be quite as ugly as a brand-new, wrinkly little red

You ever read 'Calvin & Hobbes'? Calvin created a game called
'Calvinball,' which starts with a ball and whatever else happens to be
around and ends up beastly complicated. The rule set starts out very
minimal and new rules are added whenever it seems like a good idea. The
objective of the game is subject to change without notice.

WHAT!!!?!?! There most certainly **IS** something wrong with being
suspicious!! Suspicion can destroy a relationship more quickly than
almost anything else!! A lasting relationship must be built on a
foundation of /trust/. Where there is no trust, there is jealousy, and
suspicion, and deceit, and a host of other twisted, evil, viciously
destructive emotions that'll tear any relationship apart.

"Um, yes, quite," Robert says as a small 'morph intercepts Shandra and
begins conversing in an agitated fashion about the French military.
"Bloody loony." He finishes the last of his breakfast, stands, adjusts
his suit again, and walks toward the main door of the bar for his ritual
morning stroll. On the way, he leans close to Shandra and with a wave to
the confused 'morph says "Really, I don't think 'e's your type."
 
Once outside, Robert straightens his suit unnecessarily again, brushes
an imaginary speck of dust from his lapels, and steps onto the pathway.
He greets Louis, the larger of the two bears, then on an impulse carries
on a brief, quiet conversation with the morph. A moment later, he
smiles triumphantly and returns to the Den's foyer, and steps through
the door labelled 'Private'.

  I have a friend who is very devoutly religous, but not to a point that
he thinks he must witness to everyone. Anyway, Blake(My friend) and I
were exploring this field behind my house,(I had just moved to Sarasota)
We came upon this church over on Proctor road, and there was some 
Service in progress. Blake was interested, so we went in and sat down.
The Service was a "Healing", or Exorcism or something. They were talking
about driving the demons out. Anyway, A woman, was at the alter, and the
Healer placed his hands on her forhead, and said a few thing, suddenly
she lost conciousness and fell to the floor. Promptly two helpers placed
a Blue Blanket over her, and left her there. Very Strange...
       I mysself am not religious,(Except for The False prophet) and I w
was a little nervous by all this, people were speaking in tongues and 
I decided to get out. Hmm I guess some people need that kind of thing.
This message really had no point, I just thought some one might like to
know that the Healers are in Sarasota, and some one has actually seen th
them working, Very Odd. To think that someone has so much faith that 
they can pass out from a command,,, Hmmmmmm.

   I don't enjoy chasing my own logical tail... and we've been through
this before.  You're claiming, again, objectivity for something that's
subjective.
   If homosexuality were a physical disease -- if homosexuality were 
caused by a virus, amoeba, or some such, I would agree with you 
completely.  It's not.`
    Do you want to clarify your thought?  Or is "Homosexuality is sick
because homosexuality is sick" as deep as you want to go.  (Which, of
course, is the logical equivalent of "Tofu is wonderful because tofu is
wonderful.")

   I'm sorry if I was sounding patronizing in that last post (#15868.)
It's just what I've noticed in my life: it was easy to be a virgin, and
stay a virgin -- but once I started a sex life (and found that I LIKED
it!), it's really difficult not to want to keep it up. (And sorry about
the bad pun, there...)
   It sounds like you've got a good relationship with Lisa (is that her
name?) in some respects, but it sounds like the two of you need to
discuss what will be your future sex life (before, and after marriage.)
When do you plan to try to have children?  If not immediately after
marriage, how do you plan to keep from having children?  Are you going
to have sex again before marriage?

Grrr, growl, hiss, spit!  Just a few days ago, Terri and I had a huge
fight over a really similar subject.
   /Trust/ is NOT an absence of jealousy.  Trust is not acting on the
feelings of jealousy -- or acting on blind faith against the feelings
of jealousy.  One does not feel trust, one /acts/ on trust.  One tells
one's partner the truth -- where and why one feels jealous -- and allows
the partner to respond.  
    
   You can't control your feelings.  You can channel them into other
areas, you can try to shove them in a box, or you can confront them
head on.  Only the last of those three choices does any good at removing
the problem feelings.

been to once.  The Pastor gets up there and plays guitar with the rock
band.  (Really banal lyrics, though.)  They've had healing services,
too.
   Speaking about the Way of the Armadillo, there's a law in Congress
being mulled over stating that anything is legal, done for religious
purposes.  The idea: some American Indian religions use peyote in their
religious services, which is strictly illegal in American law. This law
would eliminate all conflicts like these.  Right-wing and left-wing 
groups both applauded the measure... until someone realized what kind of
havoc that could wreck!

grooms her hair.  When finished, she tosses it back in the pack and

    stationary from the Church of the Aardvark's False Prophet..... 
 
Knowing him, he'd use it on one of his telecasts, saying that here's one
poor lost soul who worships a false God, but now he's seen the light. 
Ye-as, we are all children of the lord, little sheeps who sometimes go 
astray.... But I have made it my purpose in life to shelter and keep 
them, and help them find the lighted path once more.... Why this young
man speaks of a Shining Light, that can only be the word of the Lord
moving him.... through me...(Robert Tilton glances back down at the 
letter and mutters out of the corner of his mouth, "What the hell is 
an Aardvark?)

Turtle says he does not know what jealousy feels like ( I am not being 
a Vulcan Smart Ass). If he is never jealous, then I can see why he 
would have a hard time understanding that emotion.. 
 
Question for Turtle.... Do you have any brothers or sisters. Certainly 
if you did, you have to have been jealous of them once or twice in 
childhood..... 
 
To DragonFly: I agree with you about confronting your feelings... If you
shove them aside, especially the negitive ones, the tend to fester... 
then you start collecting "green stamps"...., meaning that you let one 
little thing add to another little thing and then another until you just
get mad at your partner about all of them at the same time, even though
these "little" things may have happened a week ago and you never 
responded to them at the time.

Korelyan watched Robert leave then wandered over to where Shandra
was talking with the little Morph. "Shandra, can I have a word with
you?" 
 
Pulling her off to the entrance of the Brothel, he spoke in low tones.
"I'm heading over to Jax to visit my father, Tampa is staying behind, of
course, I think we may have a pretty busy night. Please.... keep your 
eyes and ears open for any sign of trouble and radio if there's anything
suspicious. Father said they, too, have found some injured Morphs near

Peyote is a psychedelic mushroom, which was really popular in the
'60s. It's also known as mescal (but that's sometimes confused with a
liquor: mescaline.)  They're also known as "shrooms," "buttons," and
probably a whole bunch of other terms. (Turtle, can you help?)

   I agree about not shoving aside negative emotions, and confronting
them A.S.A.P.  My parents never would ALLOW me to express any negative
emotions, until I left for college.  (I do a REAL good impersonation of
a Vulcan.)  
   I try to be fair and honest to my friends -- and when something 
bothers me, I try to say it.  (That's not always easy, especially when
I'm trying to be diplomatic when I say it.)  Damn, but I hate tight-
ropes!
     
   To Turtle: Even though you may have never felt jealous, do you
really feel you control your emotions?  Or do you feel you just shove
them aside?

<For those of you who don't know Wolf, Squirrel, or Barbara, this will
 be of no significance.  This message is posted mostly for Turtle and
 Fennec.>
     
   If you've heard about the storms raging in Clearwater yesterday,
and the damages there, and wondered about Wolf, Squirrel, and Barbara:
they're all safe.  But there's been a lot of damage around their house.
They have no electricity and no cable -- but a phone has just been
jury-rigged.  Several trees have been uprooted, and their house has
taken some damage... But they're all alive, uninjured, and mad as HELL
at life.

   Thank you.  Actually, hamsters are much better than the rats I
used to have.

   I did?  I remember going forward in a high school chapel, when I
dedicated my life to Jesus... and I remember asking some guidance
counsellors for advice on where to go in my life... but I don't believe
I've ever gone forward for "general pray and vision."
   
   Do you mean the time when I prayed OVER and I was one of the HEALERS
of a person who was sick?

   Doesn't that bother you?

   I found it easy to be a virgin, because I was scared of sex.  I was
too embarassed to "date" until I was about fifteen (with a few excep-
tions...) and I took off for college only a year later.  
   Once I was over that fear, NUTHIN' could stop me...

Every week, in honour of the great Snail, the followers go out and
steal lots of stuff.  They then take the least liked object and burn it.
The rest they keep.  Very touching ceremony.  Of course, the monthly 
kidnappings are much more interesting.
 
BTW, what's peyote?

In a war, you do not do your best by knocking the other guy out.  You
do better by taking away his ability to fight.
