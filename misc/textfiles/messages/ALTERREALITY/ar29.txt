Cape Coral, whichj has just implemented a mandatory recycling program,
actually PROVIDES the containers you use to sort stuff out, free of
charge. They also don't charge residents for the extra pickups they
make every week (three a week: one for glass and aluminum, one for
paper and other recyclables, one for non-recyclable trash). Personally,
I think it's an excellent idea, and contrary to Mr. Ober's belief, I
don't think a little mandatory social responsibility is going to take
us all down the path to darkness and totalitarianism. Figure it's
either that or we all drown in our own garbage, which is likely to
end up bothering people a whole lot more than the inconvenience of
dropping toe soda can in the box instead of the trash.

Two possibilities here. First, we have experienced a clever test of
the emergency censorship system, and we can take the chain into a 
grand new debate on the subject. (Perhaps the worst thing about
religious debate is that very few people are truly openminded)
Second possibility is that we have a lost soul craving attention
and doing anything to get it. We should be pleased that this cretin
is not burning the flag or shooting from a water tower. Anyway, when
a child misbehaves solely to see an adults reaction or get attention,
a knee-jerk reaction could be considered a successs on the child's 
part, and the misbehavior will be repeated.

I will agree with you on the spirit of faithful relationships - but
the biggest problem within their ranks (ie - as THEY percieve it) is
a LACK of these relationships and, indeed is the basis for the term 
"gay".  Qualifications for this statement?  4 years in San Francisco 
with several gay friends and several in Salt Lake City (which surprising
enough is a major area for homosexuals to settle - I say surprising
because the Mormon Church is stringently anti-gay).  For some reason
which homosexual leaders would love to ascertain, gays are notorious for
the frequency and variety of their sexual encounters and one gay poet 
describes it as "desperate groping".  I would like to add that in all 
this time I have never been propositioned by a gay and only occasionally
felt "put out" by graphic descriptions of some fringe homosexual 
behavior.  They are human beings with a slightly different outlook on
life.

Let's try and seperate the people from the idea and beliefs...
There are many people that have the abhorrant practice of referring
to Jews as "Christ killers".  I cannot impart the extent of my dislike
for people of this type.  Hate would come close - but i'm not supposed
to - forgive and forget as such...  However I will dislike them with 
all the vigor I can muster.  This same sort of behavior is observed 
with any group of human beings - emphasis on group because we are
talking herd behavior patterns.  If you ain't like us then 1) You are
different therefor bad 2) we will try to get away from/rid of you.
You must understand that simply because someone professes that Jesus\
is at the heart of their church does not make it so.  The mormans are a
classic example of a cult - they use the accourtements of "standard"
Christianity - but there the resemblance stops - just enought to 
confuse and ensnare the uninformed - and sad to say there are lots of
them.  Protestants have "traditionally" held that the Catholic church
has no part of true Christianity because they do not hold with Biblical
teachings (as I have pointed out in other messages) and have actively
in the past tried to enslave people to their belief system.  It is not
easy for these religions to forgive because they never understood the
problem as it stood centuries ago - what they have now is an irrational 
belief.  /I/ can say I dislike the religion from a knowledgable 
standpoint - and I sure that many others can also.  Many of the herd
however moo like they've been taught.

I really don't feel up to defending the following statement - so here
it is ready for the darts.
Some forms of expression need to be restricted - after a certain limit
it becomes anarchy.  What is the limit - this depends on the social
currents at the time of interests and therefor flexible.  As a genearl
rule society enters a turmoil and comes out a little more on the pacid
(oops) placid side.  Throwing a paint filled ziplock at your house is
a form of self-expression - it goes without saying that since it has
a direct impact on you that it is restricted.  
I also disagree that reading such statements is harmless.  Call it
intuition born of experience - but it seems that people that restrict
their expressions out of respect for others make for better citizens on
the whole.  Whoops - point I was trying to make is that the mental set
of people that indulge in racy bumperstickers almost invites me to 
stick the tag "mental midget" on their forhead and say "case closed".
If it is genuinely funny - I can understand humor - but some are just
deliberately obnoxious and try to give the impression of "coolness" of
the owner.  Ah hell I quit - I'm tired.  If any of you have ever had
kids repeat these things at an inopportune time...

  Concerning your statement of God keeping a place of punishment for

us a promise.  That Hell does not have to win.  Turtle,there is a

Poison. Axel Rose has a remarkably good voice; Poison's lead singer
makes me wish I were deaf. Guns 'n' Roses is generally musically
interesting, and more than a little talented; all of Poison's musical
talent would fit in a matchbook without taking the matches out first.
On the other hand, Axel Rose probably qualifies as one of the nation's
leading living assholes--a veritable monument to his own anus. Nobody's
perfect.

Well, it seems Mr. Williams is a busy little cretin indeed. In a
twelve-hour period he called almost every single BBS in Sarasota,
Bradenton, and Venice, and left numerous messages identical to the
ones he left here. Don't know what he was looking for; I've talked to
several area sysops about him, and it appears he was annoyed at one
local Fido sysop who didn't give him access to the echomail areas,
so this is how he expressed his displeasure. Frankly, I'd like to
see the man busted for telephone harrassment. Anybody out there know
ANYTHING at all about George Williams?? (I know, slim-to-none chance,

Um...at a guess, because they're the most vocal, active, and highly
visible of the people who claim to be Christian? For "fringe radicals,"
hyperconservative Fundamentalism has a hell of a strong and popular
following, and nobody can deny they're /very/ effective at hammering
their belief system, their morality, and even their taste in reading
material down the throats of the majority, Christian or no. These
people may not represent "mainstream" Christianity, but there's enough
of them that they can't be ignored or dismissed as a few loonies, and
they're persistent enough and noisy enough to affect the views non-
Christians have of Christianity as a whole.

>...it seems that people who restrict their expressions ot of respect

Yes, that may be true, but does it therefore follow that restricting
/other's/ expressions by force also makes for a more polite society?
If a society is experiencing difficulty because its members can no
longer behave in a respectful manner toward one another, it seems to me
that there's something else wrong there--and preventing the people in
the society from issuing utterances containing "bad" words (if indeed
there really is such a thing) isn't going to cause an abrupt shift in
the outlook of the people you're restricting. It also doesn't really
follow that a society whose members use words that have arbitrarily
been designated as "bad" is one that's up for a good bout of anarchy
next Tuesday. There are a lot more factors at work here, and in the
cosmic scale of things prohibiting dirty bumper stickers doesn't seem
likely to create a new air of politeness and restraint.
 
I guess what I'm saying is that I'm inherently suspicious of any attempt
to abrogate anybody's freedom of expression, for any reason, unless
there's clear and convincing evidence that it will serve the common good
in a direct manner. Banning bumper stickers doesn't really seem likely
to cause any miraculous change in society, or even prevent people from
swearing at one another. It is simply a restriction placed on the
populance for no reason other than some people don't like to see some
words in print and don't feel anyone else should either...a personal
reason, not one predicated on the well-being of society.

Okay, here's one I still have never heard an answer to: You believe the
Bible to be truth, as revealed by god, based on what? On the fact that
the Bible /says/ it is? (Look: God is omnipotent, omiscient, and love;
see, it says so right here on the label!) Almost every major scriptural
work claims to be the truth--what makes the Bible any more valid than
the Bhagivad Ghita, the Koran, or any other religious work? Belief in
the Bible is fundamentally an act of faith, not an act of knowledge,
and claiming to have arrived at the truth based solely on an act of
faith seems like a difficult proposition to defend, particularly to
an objective outsider.

>...the Bible mentions Hell...FIFTY-THREE TIMES...
 
Depends on what translation you're using. The King James Version, I
fear, is not a terribly reliable source; while it's the most poetic
English Bible ever created, it's also generally acknowledged to be
just about the worst translation. It is in some places a second or
even third generation translation; large portions of the work come
from the Latin Vulgate, which had problems of its own, and Greek
texts. In point of fact, there is no unique Hebrew construct for
the words "Hell" or "soul" as they appear in the KJV; the Hebrew
uses the word (transliterated as) "ne'phesh" interchangably as "life"
or "soul" (as in Lev. 11:10, "every living ne'phesh that is in the
waters") and there is no indication in the Hebrew texts that the
early Hebrews acknowledged either an immortal soul or punishment in
a place called "hell". (To your implied question: Yes, I have read the
Bible, in more than one translation, and would respectfully suggest that
you consider obtaining an English translation not based on the KJV if
you'd like a more objective account of the written portion of the
Christian faith...or even considering in investing in an Anchor Bible
if you've got a wad of money kicking around underfoot.)
 
Unfortunately, I think you also missed the point of my objection to a
religion predicated on all people either going to heaven or hell.
Christian doctorine as it is now taught states that people who are not
saved will go to hell; I can not accept a deity who would, for any
reason, condemn any sapient being to eternal torture simply because
that being wasn't properly reverent, particularly in light of that
deity's refusal to provide any objective evidence to set his religion
apart from any other. It doesn't matter to me that Christianity has
an out--the mere fact that it teaches that there is a hell is sufficient
to keep me away from it. The only religions I've encountered for which I
have respect don't condemn non-believers.

I like to think that that's one of this country's strengths...but you
still evaded my question. If what is moral is determined by public
opinion, then is morality variable from society to society or does the
majority on a /worldwide/ scale rule? I also think you're missing the
problem with the argument that relates homosexuality to rape: by
condemning them both as "perverse," regardless of the fact that one is
a crime of violence directed against another person and the other is
not, you open yourself up to a whole lot of similar comparisons which
are clearly unsupportable. If I were to say, for example, that extra-
marital sex is immoral, and therefore perverse, I could by your logic
equate it with rape with equal validity. In fact, by your argument ANY
action that ANYONE finds perverse, be it oral sex, sex outside the
missionary position, sex on the Sabbath, or eating Cap'n Crunch without
Crunch Berries, is the moral equivalent of rape. I'm sorry, but I simply
don't buy that argument; I'd like to think that there's some difference,
no matter how slight or how technical, between an action perpetrated
with violence against an innocent individual and an action which is
not.

the fact that a large number of Americans own guns HAS contributed to

Charging by pound would be a fair way of handling it, but it would have

to find a local empty space and dump their garbage there.  If they knew

 Since the number of non-monogomous relationships is more between homo-

non-monogomous relationships.
 
 Lemme ask you... do you advocate heterosexuality? Do you deplore non-
monogomous relationships? If you answered yes to both, then by your 
logic, you're also a hypocrite. But, you throw in the point that there 
are more non-monogomous relationships with homosexuals. Well, that could
be a factor in your logic, but I don't see where it makes a big heap of 
difference. 
 Ever consider that because people like you don't accept homosexuals, 
they are afraid to say that they are gay, and this causes a shortage of 
people to have monogomous relationships with?

Of course not. As everyone knows, the man in charge of deciding what

down efforts to pass legislation designed to clean up unsavory
Congressional practices, defend the flag, support the South African
government, filibuster against civil rights legislation, accuse
political opponents of homosexuality, and explain to the voting public
how Dr. martin Luther King, Jr. was a Communist. (In his spare time, he
cuts off funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, donates money

have AIDS and people associated in any with people who have AIDS should

The point is living something and acting CONTRARY to it.  The question
does arise how one is to come to the conclusion that the Biblle iks
truth (despite what most Christians think, it's far from self-evident),
but that's another story.  An "impartial observer," however, would not
be terribly receptive to any argument about moral/immoral behavior that
referred to the Bible or said, in effect, "Action 'X' is immoral because
that is part of the way reality is, and our difference comes from the
fact that I understand the fundamental law of the universe on which this
is based and you do not."  This is the philosophical basis for such
statements as, for example, "Homosexuality is morally wrong because it
violates God's law" (or a "first principle" or whatever one wants to
call it to avoid looking too Judeo-Christian).

I'm changing my handle to Max because I'd rather leave "Donthen" as the
name of the storyboard character alone.  "Max" is a character, of sorts,
but he would be more an idealized version of me (and as a furry,
although the "idealized" part would be related to attitudes and
general outlook rather than possession of fur and a long tail).
   Donthen the character is mostly likable in spite of himself.  Max is
generally more easygoing and less irascible, although he will strongly
defend something he believes in (as would Donthen).  At any rate, if
there's a choice between which one to be associated with in BBS users'
minds, I think I'd rather pick the mellow cat than the balding fat guy
with the cigar, even though he's a pretty fun character.

I don't know what's "normal" about it because I don't know what causes
it.  (I also don't know what's abnormal about it, beyond the obvious
fact that it's deviant from society's norm.)  I have met people who are
homosexual and bisexual who are, setting their sexual preference aside,
perfectly normal; if their "perversity" was truly a mental disease, it
would be quite likely to manifest itself in other ways.  It doesn't.
   As I've said before, I had similar attitudes as yours until I met
some of the "perverts" in question and couldn't really find any grounds
for treating them as sickos.  To my utter amazement, several were very
interesting people, fascinating to talk to and generally people that I'd
like to be friends with (and in most of those cases, I am).  If someone
had told me this was going to happen ahead of time, I wouldn't have
believed them and would probably have been offended; I probably can't
expect you to react in a substantially different manner.
   Admittedly, I never tried to lump homosexuals in with child molesters
and rapists, either.  Sorry, but I simply can't understand your reasons
for connecting them together except that ultimately they are all things
that you don't like.  Homosexuality doesn't have any victims, and this
makes it qualitatively distinct from the "perversions" you keep bringing
up.

Wrong.  Although it is the cheapest method, it is not moral, or even 
socially acceptable.
 
Mandatory recycling of metal, glass, and paper products would go a long 
way toward helping to save our resources.  It is also a profit making
business.  I know, I collected papers and metal and sold them to 
recycling depots from the age of 9 to 11.  I did not get into recycling 
glass because of the volume necessiary (it is done by the barrel).
Mandatory recycling would (allowing for the inevitable ineficiency of 
city governments) still be a self supporting venture.
 
Please keep your responses to the point knucklehead.

I would personally rather put out the message that it isn't necessary

or any other "side" effect of this nature.  I tend to look on things 
like this as an indicator of society as a whole and not as an isoltaed
(damned dyslectic keyboard) isolated instance.  Bottom line is I feel
that society is going the wrong direction.  People would rather be rude
than polite, people will opt for being percieved as "cool" even if it's
at someone elses expense - these are things that I see more and more of
every year and it concerns me.  It manifests itself as simple things

Kind of misleading there Turtle - what exactly DO the Koran, Bhagd-Vita
and the other documents claim?
AS far as the Bible's claim - yes it makes that claim and with the
many authors that it has had it maintains this stance throughout it's 
entirety.  It documents from the mists of the beginning to the shroud
covering the end of our world.  It says what God's position is and
what man's options are with plenty of examples.  By virtue of the FACT
it can be verified for historical accuracy - it is to be assumed that
the claim it makes for itself to be true within the framework of the
system that spawned it.
If I believe that Odin really is the top dog - then obviously I fall
outside the framework of the Bible.  When the truth is finally unveiled
however, then we must answer for our beliefs.

Morality is determined by both worldwide opinion and local opinion.  
While worldwide opinion may say that killing is immoral, local opinion
will override that simply because the local opinion is what counts.  
"When in Rome..." and all that.
  
  In a like way, perverse is also a matter of opinion. In Bummfuck,
Nebraska, I would be willing to bet that if you took a poll, 
homoperversity would not be very popular, and therefore would probably
be considered VERY perverse.  On the other hand, if you took a poll 
in San Fagsisco, you would probably get a very different result, and
probably it would not be considered very perverse.  (With all the fags
that live there, it would probably be considered the NORM.)  
  Now just because it was considered the norm there doesn't mean that 
it can be considered the norm everywhere, and I
would like to point out that ther eare a lot of open minded people 
on this board and a lot of others.  (Usually people who are in the
computer community are slightly more intelligent and therefore given
to being more open minded.)  Just because you find a lot of support here
does NOT mean that you will find as many people out there int he
real world who support it.
  So, my point is this...perverse is a matter of opinion.  The more 
people who hold an opinion, the more "right" that opinion becomes.  If
Hitler had won the war, what would we all think of Jews right NOW?  
We might not even have to worry about it, but that's the way we
would think...the fact that we won was the only thing which makes us 
realize that he was 'wrong'.  
  I'm trying to reiterate a point that I don't know how to get across...

Whooaaaa boy, a two-day business show.  I dunno if I can handle the 
excitment, but sure I'd like to go.  We can always harass Amelia Hudson
and get some of those neat free pens.  I'll consult w/ Ken Ober. I need
to come up to Bradenton anyways to return issue three of "Invaders from
Home."  They did my file from last week when I had already gotten my 
stuff and I didn't look at the cover until I got home.  Grrr...

For Beatle, getting a job would be real hard unless he had a form of
transportation.  The only places withing walking distance are the 
Post Office and the Site (gas/mini-mart), and I doubt either one would
hire him.  On the other points, he'll have to answer...

That may be so, biut if that's the case then by prohibiting rude bumper
stickers aren't you simply treating the symptoms rather than the
problem? Of all the actions you can possibly take to improve society,
it would seem to me that prohibiting naughty words on bumper stickers
is just about the least effective--not only does that /not/ persuade
people that they WANT to be polite, which is the only way you're likely
to achieve the ends you're looking for, it imbues those particular words
with a sort of power or allure: "Hey, I'm not allowed to use these
words so they must be something pretty special, huh?" No, the bumper
stickers don't serve any particular purpose; bumper stickers in general,
along with designer jeans and a whole host of other modern accessories,
don't serve any particular purpose, Then again, this country wasn't
founded on the ideal of freedom of expression of that which has a
purpose;, just on freedom of /expression,/ and bumper stickers are
undeniably a form of expression.

Of COURSE the Bible maintains throughout its entirety that it's the
Word of God--to do otherwise would be fatal. If I'm writing a document
which I want people to accept as the Word of God, I'm going to claim
it's the Word of God regardless of what it actually is. As far as
historical accuracy, let's just say that the record in the Bible is
rather one-sided and somewhat overstated.

>Ever see a poster called "The Last Great Act of Defiance"?
 
Yes, as a matter of fact. Not the same thing. If I'm going to worship
a being that claims to be the essence of love, then I expect it to
behave according to those standards. I would not follow a political
figure who participated in wid-scale torture or genocide, even if that
person were to threaten me with execution; I would not participate in
an institution that practiced torture or murder, even if I could argue
that I was "just following orders." I feel that the deliberate,
everlasting torture of sapient beings is wrong, plain and simple. I
won't worship a divinity that does it.

I've met quite a few people (all of them men, not surprisingly) who
believe very strongly that male homosexuality is wrong, despicable,
evil, etc, etc, but who see absolutely nothing whatsoever wrong with
female homosexuality (or bisexuality). I simply wondered if you were
one of them, that's all.

Are you saying, then, that if worldwide opinion were suddenly to
shift in favor of accepting homosexuality as morally acceptable, you
would no longer find it unacceptable? That seems to be a kind of
strange view of morality; personally, I've never trusted the majority to
be able to decide on a president, much less something as complex as
a code of morality. The herd instinct seems like kind of a questionable
way to resolve complex or difficult problems. Of course, I could also as
what gives the majority the right (rather than the ability) to force
its views on the minority; if the majority would suddenly to start
making decisions about something equally as trivial as sexual prefer-
ence, like, say, food preference (eating eggplant is simply beyond the
pale!), would /it/ become MORALLY wrong???

And criticises homos for it, too. The distinction here is that he is
not criticising heterosexuals for BEING heterosexuals, he's criticising
them for a lack of faith. Likewise, he's not criticising gays because
they are homosexuals, but because they are behaving in an unfaithful
fashion. Kind of like the difference between condemning a black because
he's black and condemning a black because he's just murdered sixty-two
people with an assault rifle and a potato peeler.

answer only unit, but 'not anymore'). So now I can screw around at break
and lunch, too. Oh yeah, back to the HD. It came out of an AT compatible
DELL system used for AutoCAD if that helps. And I desire to put it in
a 286-12 at home. Ooooops, yup, the seal has been broken and <oooooooh>
it has seen REAL air for about 5 seconds to please a friends curiosity

M>...beyond the obvious fact that it's deviant from society's norm.
  
Thank you. That was all I needed to hear.   I am sure that there are 
good people out there who are fags, In the way of generally being 
just helpful and easy to get a long with over all "good guys."  
I don't understand how you can say that a mental defect MUST manifest
itself in another way besides the most obvious.  I'm sure that there
are genuine loonys out there who are really nice people...until thier
"symptom" manifests itself.
  And true, homosexuality has no victims to speak of (unless you count
AIDS victims, but I'm not), but that doesn't mean that it isn't 
perverse!  I believe that you gave a pretty good definition for 
perverse above.  "Deviant from society's norm."
