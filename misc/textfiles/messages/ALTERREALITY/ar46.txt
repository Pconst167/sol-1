you won't see the naked flame dancers. I won't even let you take

responses...
************************************************************************
*    THE OFFICIAL "NAME THE DAMN BOARD" SWEEPSTAKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!       *
************************************************************************
 
   I'd like you all to post some of the coolest, most attention getting
names you can think of for a board, and from those I will pick 15 semi-

  In reference to the manipulation of photos by computer...
 
  On an episode of "Max Headroom", a similar idea (projected for the 
early 21st century) was proposed, except it manipulated a whole VIDEO. 
As an example, an old film of the Trojan horse was changed to show the 
"Trojan Sheep". If we hve the capability to totally manipulate sound and
a still photo, then does manipulation of an entire segment of film seem 
too far fetched for 2005??? That could open up a world of possibilites.
And problems.

  Video News!
 
  Today, I recieved two video tapes. One was an addition to my Max 
Headroom collection. On this tape was the second ever episode titled 
"Raking". The other episode involved "Xenobabies", babies created with 
no parents. I'll be bringing this tape to RufusCon. This episode is 
particularly interesting because a) it looks sorta good for a multi-
generation copy and b) it was NEVER aired on network TV. It's intact 
with good edits and no network "inserts" such as voice-overs or screen 
logos superimposed over the screen...
 
  The other tape had a letterboxed copy of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit". I
know a lot of us are interested in animation... so, if anyone wants to
see the letterboxed version, let me know... It's a very good quality 
tape direct from a CAV laserdisc, and it's actually SHARPER than a 
commercial copy (in my opinion).
 
  Also, if anyone is interested in a letterboxed tape of "Blade Runner" 
with supplementary material, let me know. I can get you some details.

Eating meat and hunting have very little to do with one another unless
you are a wolf.  The ethics involved with factory farming are quite
different than the ethics involved with going out and killing an animal
so you can survive; likewise, the ethics involved in killing another
creature solely for the sport have very little to do with survival.  You
should be aware of that.  Most deer hunts, or any other type of "sport"
hunting, are not conducted for survival, they are conducted for
trophies.  If I'm not mistaken, that's kind of in the definition of
"sport."
   Incidentally, saying, "Well, you eat meat, don't you?" has always
struck me as one of the most reprehensible ways to avoid the issue of
human ethics toward animals and the environment that there is.  By
(incorrectly) implying that if someone does something that could be
seen as supporting something ethically questionable, he is no longer
fit to comment on the ethics of ANY related topics, it makes it possible
to blow off any questions he raises without even stopping to consider
what they may have said.  It is a fallacy of the worst sort, whose only
purpose is to allow its proponents to comfortably avoid questioning
their own beliefs -- and it's the sort of misdirection someone who has
tried to set himself up as an electronic Socrates, which you apparently
would like to be, shouldn't be shoveling out.

I don't /believe/ you just said that!! TBBS is not a bulletin board

for making it look like absolutely anything you want, although it's

   You seem to have split the debate into two topics. Here are my
repsponses to each:
   The first half of your message merely agreed with what I was 
implying: that there is a difference between 'butchering' and 'hunting.'
But do you really feel that survival is the true difference: do you
really feel that every, or even most, cows are butchered for the 
survival of humans? In other words, do cows die that we may live -- or
that we may have a somewhat more compact protein source? Again I ask:
what is the difference between 'hunting' and 'butchering'?
   Your second issue, that of should a morally imperfect man make
moral judgements, is a really interesting question in itself. If I
answer yes, I would be hard pressed to find a source (that is, a 
morally perfect Being saying it's okay for us humans to judge by
anything but Her standards.) If I answer no, then I would be doing
exactly what I said I shouldn't do: make moral judgements. 
   In any case, I apologize for having seemed to make that assumption.
   However, I don't feel that's a moral fallacy of the worst sort.
Looking at it from a strictly pragmatic viewpoint, you say that if
everyone believed that idea, some people would ignore the viewpoints
of others, those who haven't completely followed the Way. (of whatever
diety is currently in vogue.) I say, that any perfect Diety would have
a moral standard far above any we humans could reach; if we actually
believed that idea, we would agree that morality comes from a source
outside of humanity, and we all would tend to agree much more about
perfect morality.
   By the way, thanks for the Socrates analogy!

Ok! Here are the results of the contest!
              There Were som minor moral problems that I have resolved
by unfairly changing the rules...(Tough, I try to keep every body happy)
 
The Scale of Access is as follows:(Highest to lowest)
 
Rabbit God Allmighty Access
Rabbit God-Like Access
Demi-Rabbit-God-Like Access
Titanic Rabbit Access
Immortal Bunny Access
Heroic Hare Access
Average Rabbit Access
Baby-Bunny Access-(New Users)
Non-Posting Leech Access
 
Now, All Visiting Sysops get Rabbit-God-Like Access within 24 hours of
Logging on for the first time.  Most Access levels are based on how you
post, (usually, There can be exceptions.) All people will be BABY-BUNNY
ACCESS when they first log on.  They will be updated to the following 
levels within 24 hours. AND NOW THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO CONTRIBUTED!
    (If you think that your entry was misjudged, leave me E-mail here
and I may reconsider you position. Fair Enough?)
 
The Name That has Been chosen for the board is "The Warren" By Corwyn.
(Sorry Corwyn, but no Co-Sysop access because there is no need for one)
(but you do get Rabbit-God-Like Access....)
The Following people have Rabbit-God-Like Access:
Corwyn, Oden, Random, Turtle, Ender.
The folowing people have Demi-Rabbit-God-Like Access:
Nobody---You have to earn this by posting.
Titanic Rabbit Access:
Snakebyte, Max S. Cat.
Imortal Bunny Access:
Humming Bird, Mystral Milovlee, Night Owl.
Heroic Hare Access:
Cyberpunk, Coyote, Wolverine, Berlin, Dragon-Fly, Beatle.
Every one else will have Baby Bunny access until they post, Then they 
will be average Rabbits. Leeches know their place.
The reason most of my closer friends got lower access levels is because
I know that they will post often, and I want them to set a good example
for others. (And It's more fun and satisfying to see your access go up
Because of what you do, not who you are.)
So Thats it folks! The board should be up within 2 weeks, So I'll post 
the number as soon as it's up! Later And Blessed Be!

It's very unlikely you would be able to download a copy of TBBS,
since (1) it's an VERY expensive program; (2) Phil Decker (the
guy who worte it) seems to know everybody who buys it personally; and
(3) he gets very annoyed when he sees pirate TBBS boards running (and
yes, he does lok for them). So the net result is: People who buy
it don't give it to other people, even if they are otherwise pirates.
 
TBBS has the potential to be very lame if the sysop can't program or
doesn't know what he's doing. It can also be a pretty impressive system.
It all depends on the amount of work the sysop is willing to put into
it.

Why oh why oh why oh why oh why do you INSIST on dragging theology into
every issue that even remotely involves morals or ethics???
 
As far as your "butchering vs. hunting" question, here is the answer:
When you butcher a cow, you turn it into food. When you hunt for
sport, you turn your victim into a trophy. That is the difference.
Arguments about being able to find food from other sources are
irrelevant. In the first case, you are eating the animal; in the
second, you are killing for fun. Clear?

> What is the difference between hunting and butchering?
 
In the context of the original question, the difference is between
sport hunting, i.e., killing creatures for fun, and killing animals for
survival.  I'm fairly sure I answered that -- in fact, I think I've
answered it at least twice.
   If the question	 is pushed into the form of, "what is the difference
between killing free-ranging animals for food when necessary and factory
farming them," I think that it, too, would be patently obvious.  The
practice of factory farming, and the associated cruelties perpetuated on
animals by treating them as a product rather than living beings with the
ability to suffer, is the main reason many "animal rights nuts" are
vegetarians -- not because eating meat is, in itself, a horrible sin.
 
   As for whether or not a "morally imperfect" person has the right to
make moral judgements, your soliliquoy seemed to imply that morality
must come from an outside source.  My original attack was against those
who say, "you must have benefitted at some point some time from
something that caused an animal to suffer," and dismiss the argument
entirely.  Abstracting this to the philosophical level, as you've done,
is a nice intellectual exercise, but doesn't seem to serve a practical
point.  By most religious systems of morality, we are all imperfect.  If
you say nobody who is morally imperfect can make any judgement, then
we're all reduced to Jello.  This is the opposite extreme of the type of
argument I was protesting, and they're both patently absurd to anyone
who isn't engaging in the mental masturbation beloved of philosophers.
 
   Incidentally, while there are things to be said for the Socratic
dialogue, not all of them are good.  It's possible to abstract things to
a level so wonderfully philosophical and intellectual that it has no
use in practical living -- which, to me, makes any such argument moot.

   I think it sounds like a hit song. Those lyrics would produce one

semi-legendary pancakes (both varieties!) and another itching for those 
milk choclate pop tarts (sounds like an oxymoron to me)... The RufusCon
crowd needs an official food, and I want to vote for Sable's french 
toast, unless the pancakes are better.

T>When you butcher a cow, you turn it into food. When you hunt for 
T>sport, you turn your victim into a trophy. That is the difference.
     
   And in every deer hunt I've ever heard of, the hunters ate the
venison. Although they might put deer heads on the walls, what
precisely is done with cow heads that much more moral? Cows brains
are not a common food...
   Agreed: most hunting is not for food. But I still find the position
"No hunting should be allowed" to be extreme, and I also feel that if
eating meat is moral, hunting is also moral.
   Simply, if one says one is morally allowed to eat animals, one says
that animals are lower than humans (unless, of course, one also says
one is morally allowed to eat humans.) In our own culture, we do all
we can to keep our own deceased "looking natural" as long as possible;
it is considered more moral to keep a dead person looking alive as
long as possible than it is to eat him. (Take a look at some of Western
culture's more strange religious relics.) Why does that not apply to
animals?

   If that doesn't make much sense, I'm writing this in the middle of

   Really? A syllogism develops:
       Anything concerning talking animals is of the Devil.
       The Bible contains talking animals.
       ----------------------------------------------------
       The Bible is of the Devil.
    
   More seriously, there's at least two stories of talking animals I 
can think of: the serpent in the garden, and that of Balaam's ass.
Add a few more from the book of Revelations. Not all are of the Devil.

You misunderstood my original question. My question was "What is the
moral difference between hunting animals FOR FUN -- especially when
they're eaten later -- and factory farming them?" Neither is for a
person's survival.
    I find it innately humorous that you say the Socratic dialogue is
bad because it abstracts things to heavily philosophical levels --
by using the Socratic method and abstracting the dialogue to one level
higher.

It would be eating the hamsters if you fry them in a light butter-

   It would be hunting them if you used a small bow-and-arrow, a .45,

because I have Stopped posting on Beyond Chaos until The Sysop realizes
that the board he runs and should be proud of,(It's a wonderful board 
Oden) ...The board should not be a haven for racial epitaphs(SP?) and 
other racial let's say, problems. Regardless of what has happened to a 
person in the past, The Board is not a place for it. My deepest regrets
to Oden, but I cannot continue to post or call the board until you 
resolve the problem. I'm not the first person to stop calling your board
 Cheif was the first, I kept calling because I thought that It might
stop with time, but it just gets worse.  (sigh) So long Oden, I'll 
talk to you on this board and others, But I will NOT call your board.

The massive amount of brain power in charge of the police forces 
between Tampa and Fort Myers has decided that since the holiday
season is the busiest for robbers due to the extra amount of 
goodies in peoples homes, they are spending more time and money in
order to try to catch speeders.  Yes be on lookout for the next month 
for anal retentive police officers looking to spread fifty dollars of
holiday cheer for anyone who cares to exceed the speed limit.  So 
this holiday season rest assured that while someone may be breaking

I have two major quibbls with your message.
 
(1) Nobody so far has said "All hunting is immoral." Once again, you
    seem to be missing the point of the message.
(2) Not all deer hunters turn their prizes into food. In my experience
    (recall that I grew up in the midwest, and that my father is a
    hunter), most hunts are for trophies period. In addition, this
    discussion is not limited to deer hunts; people hunt elk, pronghorn
    antelope, and the like for sport with no particular consideration
    given to eating the animal in question.

Okay, brace yourselves. You won't believe this one.
 
  A person, who shall remain nameless to save much embarrassment, was 
going to come to RufusCon. He asked me for directions. I told him to go 
to Sarasota on New 301, and drive until he came to Shadowood Appartment
just before the Super America. Anyway, the FIRST mistake he made was 
deciding to WALK. He wanted to make a journey fro part of Bradenton to 
part of Sarasota. The second mistake he made was walking NORTH, since he
had no sense of direction. A usual deterrant for those wanting to go 
south, he interpreted DOWNtown Bradenton as being south. He walked right
over another clue, THE GREEN BRIDGE. Now being in Palmetto, he realized 
he was in the wrong place and spent all of his money getting a cab ride 
home after WALKING 30 miles IN THE WRONG DIRECTION...

Hey, did I miss something? I hope you all didn't get yelled at at
/my/ McD's...my boss was somewhat perplexed when I dragged about
half of RufusCon in there on Sunday. (For those who are interested, 
RufusCon II finally wound down to an end at about 6pm Monday evening,
at which time I ran Fox and Wratt back to Tampa, and it was determined
that Max and I have distinctive voices in part because both of us
pronounce the letter "l" non-laterally, which is kind of unusual...
that particular letter is the only lateral sound in English.)

I said the Socratic dialogue could lead to confusion because it is too
often used to play devil's advocate.  Also, the "dialogue" often ends up
being less about the issues at hand and more about the words being used
by one of the debaters.  The one with a greater command of the language,
or simply with more experience at word games, pounces on	 the letter of
what someone said when there is a possibility of twisting it away from
that person's meaning and ends up "disproving" the other's argument on
linguistic grounds.  This is the sort of abstraction	 I am talking about
and it's something a lot of New Collegians, both in and out of the
philosophy department, take a great deal of pleasure in, for reasons I
can't comprehend.  It doesn't convince anyone of anything, once the
argument has ended and the person realizes he's been the victim of word
play rather than logic -- and it often ends up leading people into being
devil's advocates when they see the chance to trap their opponent in
these shenanigans.  This is something I think you are guilty of quite a
lot.
 
And as a matter of fact, your original question was NOT "what is the
difference between hunting for fun and factory farming."  For one thing,
factory farming wasn't mentioned until my last message; for another, the
original issue was the morality involved in sport hunting taken by
itself, not in comparison with other animal exploitation.  If you want
to modify the issue -- fine.
 
The difference between the two should be patently obvious, as are the
similarities.  Unlike factory farming, the argument that sport hunting
does have some survival value (i.e., providing food, leaving aside the
argument of whether that method of obtaining it is necessary) simply
cannot be made.

The stuff about hamster abuse didn't particularly impress me on Beyond
Chaos, but here I feel more comfortable asking people -- what the hell
is so goddamn funny about torturing small, furry animals that compels
you to have spent the last month talking about it?  Yes, I realize all
the messages are meant as jokes.  I'm sure it's also possible to make
jokes about torturing and killing human beings, but I don't think
anybody here would be particularly tolerant of "Holocaust Humor."  (If
anyone feels like trying to make an Auschwitz joke in response, I'll
save myself the trouble and tell you to go to Hell now.)
 
If anyone thinks I'm a "killjoy," so be it.  I asked this on BC and
didn't get any response (at least any that I saw), so I'll propose it
again.  A joke or two is fine, although I might personally feel they're
in poor taste.  But an ongoing joke for over a month on two BBS's that
concentrates on the joy of killing little animals in creative ways is
just downright sick.  How can any of you (supposedly) rational and
intelligent people find it this humorous?

  "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" was their only PG rated film that I 
saw on the video racks. Plus, I don't think they hacked it up that bad. 
For one thing, Ch. 28 was working from an actual print of the film 
(usually a good sign in having a complete film, but not a good one for 
transfer quality) and for another thing, they kept running "mature
subject matter" warnings. I once saw "1941" on WGN from Chicago, and 
they "silenced" out a lot of "shit"s and left in a lot of "goddamns" 
(which I usually find are BIG taboos on the networks)... You can get 
away with a lot more at 1 AM.
 
  Speaking of this Monty Python stuff, I have a film I bet you haven't 
seen. Eric Idle did a film in the late '70's for NBC called "The Rutles"
in which he totally ripped apart the Beatles in a documentary form. It 
ran on TV, but somehow they snuck an "asshole" in there... It has Eric 
Idle, Michael Palin, Neil Innes (who was in "Holy Grail" I believe, and 
who writes some pretty weird songs) and a nice selection of the Saturday
Night Live original crew. I have loved this film ever since I first saw 
it, and I've got the soundtrack (which was just re-released a few months
ago) and I finally found a video tape of it, which was on sale at Tracks
where all the used videos were being sold for $9.95... Besides that, the
video is out of production. Let me know if you're interested in seeing 
it (or if you have!)

I'm sorry, but I still can't really picture Amelia in a bad mood.
She's too...um...too...well, nice. What does she do, bite the heads
off small children or what?

>I'd /like/ having no aim in life, just doing what made me happy.
 
That's what I do now! All you have to do is be prepared for the
inevitable barrage of "What are you going to do with your life? When
are you going to grow up and stop fooling around? When will you realize
that mature adults aren't SUPPOSED to be happy?!?!"

Now, now Turtle I will clarify.  Not all drugs should be legalized.
But maybe some sort of standards could be put into action.  Something 
like people not being allowed on to drive.  Rigidly enforce that, but 
legalized the actual use and availability.  The last thing I'd like to 
see is a bunch of spaced-out people driving.

What a drag.  I missed RUFUSCON '90.  
  
On the better side of things, I finally got that 440 put into my
Dodge.  Can you say "Gas hog?"  I knew you could.  Can you say,
"Mustang Eater?"  Don't bother...
  
  Although, as soon as I get the 3x2 (Six Pack) intake put on,
then, by gosh...then, well, then I'll REALLY be able to waste 
gas....
 
  Actually, it sounds really healthy.  Headers, don't ya know...
 
 
 
 Think globally, pollute locally.

Depends on the cat in question.  Big difference between Sylvester and
Omaha.
