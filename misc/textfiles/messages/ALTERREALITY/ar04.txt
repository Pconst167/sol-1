You know how on some days it's warm out, and then on some other days
it's cold out? Well, I have a confession to make. That's MY FAULT.
You see, I have this control, and when I turn it one way the sun warms
up, and when I turn it the other way the sun cools down. Sometimes I
just TURN IT for no readily apparant reason. I'm not sure why; I just
do. And you know what else? I'm NOT SORRY ONE BIT. Ha ha ha!

radio operator's license though. I recently found a listeng of Public

Of course you're welcome to come watch, even more welcome to audition.
There's usually a terrible shortage of men (ain't that true everywhere
ladies?)  Auditions are usually deadly dull to watch, though.  Audition
Sunday evening, December 17 at Players of Sarasota (corner of US 41
and 9th Street) at 7:00 p.m.
   Latest update -- cancel last post re: archangel.  He will NOT be
auditioning for my show, though he'll probably come to watch.  The
little darlin' just got cast in "Dames at Sea" at the Island Players.
Men!  You can't depend on 'em.

Well, I've yet to experience "Rock N' Rule", so I'm really not qualified
to respond to that, but I like the idea of it involving "furries." 
Yeah, I'll have to admit the "ball" scheme was kinda pathetic, but I 
think my favorite scene was the Taxi cab, when the guy tried to rob
the driver, and was abruptly desitigrated by the laser machine the 
driver activated. Interesting to say the least. I think the BEST ball
scheme that came out (In two movies to date) was the boring balls in 
the movie(s) Phantasm. Now THAT was an interesting double sided movie.
I really didn't care for the way they blended the second movie in from
the first, and at times, Phantasm ][ was a little bit drug out, but it
STILL had the quality special effects that made the first movie a hit. 
Anybody else enjoy Phantasm? (By the way, this was NOT an animated movie
but I feel merits discussion.)
