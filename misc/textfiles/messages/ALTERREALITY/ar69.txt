I see no reason why records should not be labelled with something like:
    
   WARNING: This record contains profane language, sexual imagery,
and intelligent lyrics.
    
   Heck -- it would tell the younger buyers which albums to purchase
immediately...
   
   More seriously, if such a label were part of the cover (and not just
the cellophane wrapping), it would be obvious to parents which albums
their child bought that may not be up to their standards.  Such 
voluntary labels would NOT be censorship, any more than listing 
ingredients in a package would restrict the quality of pre-packaged
foods.

By "say those things," I assume you mean use the colorful metaphors and
expletives in the songs...to which I say "So what?" There is no such
thing, and I mean /no/ such thing, as a "dirty" word. A word gets its
meaning only from the society of the people who use it and the context
its used in. Who cares if some word for sexual intercourse becomes
acceptable to people? If this happens, it is no longer "dirty" at all,
is it?
 
As for thinking about the implications of the songs: If they were raised
to believe that those implications are wrong, ie, that women are not to
be treated as objects, etc, then once they start thinking about the
implications of the songs they will probably stop listening to them. The
idea that children get their morality and sense of ethics from pop music
is downright silly. If the idea isn't there to begin with, they aren't
gonna get it from a song, and if they were /not/ raised to believe that
the ideas expressed in the song are wrong, they'd probably behave badly
regardless of whether or not they ever listened to the music, hmm?

  The former First Mate sets his mug down, having noticed that none of
the barmaids or bartenders seems in the least interested in giving him
"another one of these".  
  It occured to him to wonder about how he was going to get off this 
island.  After all, not too many pirate ships are interested in signing
on a "former" First Mate.  And besides, did he really feel like going 
back to pirating?  He looked over to the bunnymorph, who was looking
quite frankly bored.  
  "You know," he says to her, "you haven't said practically word one.
If I didn't know better, I'd think that you were bored."  She looks 
suprised, raises her eyebrows.  
  And another thing that's bothering him...there are assorted murmurings
around here about "trouble brewing"...and while he could take care of 
himself, he just plain didn't give a care about anyone else in here. So,
he concluded mentally, why stick around and fight a battle which wasn't
his? 
  Because he had no way of leaving, and this establishment was for al
practical purposes going to be his home until he could make up his mind
about where he was going next.  And how.  He frowns, and the bunnymorph
gets up, moves behind him, and starts massaging his back.  "Y'know,
this situation never would have occured at the Wyvern's Den."  The bunny
murmurs something in response, and continues working his neck.  He 
couldn't quite be sure, but it sounded like she had said, "It's your
fault." 
  He spins around sharply, throwing her hands off.  "What did you say?"
  She gives him another suprised look.  "I said, 'It's alright'." She
blinks.
  He takes her hands. "Sorry.  Can I get a raincheck on this encounter?"
She nods.  
  He gets up and wanders over to Shandra.
  "Hello," he says by way of greeting. "Need some help?"

You are missing my point. If parents raise their children to believe tha
the values and ideals expressed in the type of music Saavik objects to
are wrong, then those parents do not /have/ to forbid their children to
listen to the music. Therefore, the children in question will not listen
to the music to rebel, since they won't be rebelling by doing it. You
cannot rebel against a restriction that does not exist.

If the child does not understand the implications of the song, it
doesn't matter if he listens to it or not. It might as well be in
Swahili for all the impact it's gonna have. If, on the other hand, the
child /is/ old enough/mature enough to understand the implications of
the song, and also has been brought up to believe that the ideals in the
song are wrong, it's rather unlikely that he's going to suddenly trash
all his ideals and upbringing to go out and start behaving like the song
tells him to regardless of how "cool" he thinks it is. People don't work
that way. If they did, all you'd have to do is record a song about
listening to your parents and cleaning up your room ands all the
problems facing parents today would evaporate, yesno?

Not really; I never had very strict parents, so I never went through the
ritualistic bad-attitude rebellious pubescent teen thing. I just got
into the habit of staying away from the house a lot; I'd leave the
house Friday morning and come back Monday night, and my mother would
say something like "You weren't around all weekend so I vacuumed your
rug." My parents always figured I was smart enough to get myself out of
any trouble I got myself into...and if not, well, call it a learning
experience.

    Well, Why do Humans hunt Foxes?  For sport?  What a cruel way to 
treat animals.  Why do humans have to treat animals so bad?  I mean,
hell, Ken Sable Hates Dogs, and just like, shoves them away.  Why? I
would like to know why people have to hurt animals. I can understand
maybe foir food, like Cows, but I mean, I could not go out, and just
kill a dog, or a fox, or any othe animal for that matter.  I do not,
in a matter of speaking, like to hear of anybody, hurting animals. I
even bitch at Ken Sable, when he gets pissed off at his cat, and he-
throws it across the room.  I tell him that if he throws the cat, I-
will leave ... For I do not in the slightest believe in that.

   Humans hunt foxes because it's fun to be cruel.  Not many people

RoboMouse, so called because of the "Mickey Mouse ear" floodlights on
the roof. It got the name shortly after Rufus saw RoboCop (the original,
not the hacked-up Frank Miller sequel). As a historical aside, my first
Bug was named JSYS, since everyone knows a JSYS is a good vehicle for
hackers...

That isn't the case at all. It's not that my parents put no restrictions
on me; they simply told me what they thought was appropriate behavior,
and /why/ they thought it was appropriate behavior, and figured that as
a self-determining and sapient lifeform I was capable of figuring out
the rest by myself. They also didn't bail me out whenever I got into
trouble, like a number of the parents of the type you describe seem to
do. If I got into trouble, it was my own damn problem and I had best
figure how to get myself right back out again. There is some middle
ground between the "total permisiveness" and "raise the kid as a carbon
copy of ourselves" camps, ya know?

   Well, it seems people treat animals in such ways because they
can't hear them scream. They can't listen them say that it hurts.
All they can see is their eyes looking back....  Would hearing the
animals make people stop? No. Hell no. People are usually ignorant
to others feelings. Personal gain has toppled self respect and respect
for others that it is so commman now a days jus to push away others
for yourself. It weaves itself into every aspect of life includeing
that of pets.... hell, animals in general. Life sucks when someone
has to kick a dog to take out their frustrations of work and the
sort.

   As he gets off the 'craft, some long-tailed morph [Shandra] said
"Hello" to the young human.  He smiled back.  He loved the tail.
   
   He wandered over to the Den, where Louis is waiting.  Before Louis
has a chance to ask, Wesley pulls out an I.D. card, and shoves it in
Louis' hand.
     
   The card, a driver's licence from Georgia, had his 3-D picture,
the name of Wesley Simmons, a birthdate that would make him twenty-one
years old, a statement that Wesley was born free (and not a slave), and
gave his physical dimensions fairly closely.  The signature of the
Transportation General was illegible.  Underneath the driver's license
was a hundred-credit note.
   
   The license was patently fake: there was no magnetic strip on the
back, for example.  And Georgia never went through the expense of a 
full hologram on their driver's licenses.  And Louis could really care
less about the age of someone who enters the Den.  But he pocketed the
note, and waved Wesley in.
   
   He wandered over to the bar, and tried to look macho.  There was
nobody behind the counter.  "Hey!  What do I have to do to get service 
around here!" he shouted to no one in particular.

It's a FAIR amount.  How about an ending speed of 225 miles per hour?
Howzzat strike ya?  What's your slide rule say about that?  (Completes
in about 5 seconds or so.)   Now, THAT'S a "damn lot" of acceleration!
I figger my Mopar could do about a 13 or 14 second quarter mile as it

gonna do a 12 and some change.... What's your slide rule say about that?

>I don't think I could handle their rejection of me...
   
   Teenagers never really reject their parents... Think of it like a
kite.  You begin flying the kite, and slowly let out more string, as
it sails higher and higher.  Occasionally, there's a crash, and you
need to do some mending.  But one lucky day, you let your kite out, 
and you see it climb higher and higher into the sky, until it's free
of gravity, and free from your control.
     
   Of course, that 'kite' may want a little extra string when he
comes home from college...

Well I've heard about the interpersonal relationships, whats your view

All the while people like Sununu fly all over the place, cutting back 
services to cities, cutting back health services, considering raising 
the retirement age a few years ago, stuff like that.  AND leaving 
people like the Kurds hanging while we decide what to do if anything.

Of /course/ it's starting from a standing position. That's what drag
racing is all about. And you're going a heckuva lot faster than 75
when you get to the finish line, too.
 
Actually, sixteen seconds is about what you can expect a stock Corvette
or something along those lines to finish a quarter mile in. A rodded-out
Nova with a four-barrel will do it in about fourteen, something like
The Specialist's car with six-pack installed can probably make it in
twelve or thirteen, and a racing Bug with turbo-charged, nitro-packed
engine will do it in about eleven. Faster than that and you gotta be
burning something besides gasoline. Top fuel rail dragsters and funnycar
will generally do it in seven.

Um...best take advantage of any aeronautics courses that may happen your
way...kites don't work if they aren't tethered. The principle by which
they fly is almost the opposite of the principle by which an airplane
wing works...they depend on high drag and high attack angle to stay up.
As a result, if you let go of 'em they fall down go boom, eventually.
You ever notice how kites don't glide very well?  Rather low stall

As he stepped off of the ship, he cleared his throat and spat a stream 
of flem past the dock and into the water. Several heads turned in his 
direction and he shot them a glare that made them quickly look away. 
 
He was an evil looking fellow.. Tall and large boned... not an ounce
of spare flesh on him but he went a good 240 lbs. A crab sidled across
the dock in front of him and he placed one booted foot over it and 
smiled as it crunched beneath his weight. "Officer's Ashore!!!" 
He yelled over his shoulder in his deep demanding voice, then he 
started walking down the dock toward the market place, about 5 men 
trailing behind him. The men were looking here and there with interest
but the man was moving with determination... swift and sure... past 
the market place and up the path. He didn't slow until he reached 
the pair of Bear Morphs at the door of the Den. 
 
"G'day, Louis." He greeted and shook the Bouncers hand heartily. 
 
Louis' smile was more of a grimace... "Zameel! Welcome back." Spoken
half heartedly. "I'll have to take your pistol." Louis glanced around
the large frame to the other crewmen. "And yours as well.." 
 
Zameel pulled the pistol off his belt and handed it to Louis without
batting an eye then started to walk by. A large furry arm blocked his
path. 
 
"And the knife on your right boot, Zameel." Louis locked glares with 
the large human. 
 
Zameel stared him down a moment then with a sigh, he leaned down and 
pulled out the knife... he paused before trying to pass again. 
 
Louis gave him one final glare, then removed his arm from Zameel's path.
"Have a nice day." The Bear Morph chuckled deeply. As the crew piled 
past, following Zameel and handing the Bouncer's their weapons, Louis 
ted the last time Zameel had visited... It had taken 2 days to 
clean up the mess from the brawl. Tampa would be "thrilled" to see him, 
he thought drily. 
 
Zameel entered the Den, glancing around as his eyes adjusted to the 
darkness. He brought a hand to the stubble on his chin and stared

could get to make the run in about thirteen five, but that's about the
best time he managed.

>Bypass surgery...doc.
 
Lemme just get out the ol' rubber tubing, and...but that ain't gonna
work, is it? If I could find something that'd take the pressure, sure.
I just don't want the damn thing blowing off when I step on the brake on
41 in rush hour traffic...any ideas?

Closest I've ever done is 140. Went screaming through a speed trap, too.
Blew the cop off...he pulled into the road with lights flashing and
siren wailing in his nice pretty Mustang GT, and by the time he was
on the road and moving I had jumped off at an exit and done a U-turn
across two lanes of traffic on the crossroad...he couldn't figure out
where I went and ended up racing off into the distance in *precisely*
the wrong direction. Just takes a little quick thinking, ya know?

The modern ones are still using 350 small blocks, right? I'd love to

>I think I'd wet my pants if I was driving.
 
Nah...ya just gotta remember not to overdrive your visibility. At that
speed a sneeze can last a quarter of a mile...and that's plenty of time
to get yourself into trouble. Figure cars that are being piloted by
sane people and sticking to the speed limit are gonna be coming up on
you at a hundred miles per...it's kind of like driving an obstacle
course, only the obstacles move. I almost bought the farm when I was
driving from Sarasota to Ft. Myers at about one-twenty and this guy in
this Porsche travelling at fifty-five decided to change lanes right in
front of me...didn't realize that I was coming up on him with a relative
velocity that was *higher* than his actual velocity. Geeze...thought I
was a goner for a second, ended up on the friggin' shoulder still going
well over a hundred per. Hate when that happens.

There've been a few continuity errors in the Den recently...specifically
Shandra is now *outside*, and Louis was on his way to the shed when
Dragonfly's character arrived. Oh well.

"Huh?" I look around in surprise at the "hello"...evidently it wasn't
the kid speaking at all. Louis speaks briefly to the kid, who hands him
something that he snorts at contemptously and flicks into the sand.
I walk back toward the Den, where one of the patrons is standing. "Need
any help?"
   "Dunno yet. Don't know what's going on, really. I just got this bad
feeling, you know?" Behind me, I hear Luis talking to someone, who
sounds like...oh, no. "And my bad feeling just got worse." I re-enter
the bar and walk over to where Tampa is sitting. "Tampa, maam, I think
an old friend has just dropped by for a vist. This is going to be a fun
night." The patron who addressed me is standing by the door; I flick my
tail back over my shoulder and say, "How are you with a gun?"

No problem, I do it ever day. It's kind of like hearding cattle
every night before bed. Catch dem lil' frogs, chase the lizards 
back up the sliding glass doors (they're too fast to catch) and 
be sure no potentially dangerous bugs are lurking in the corners.

Matter of compression. matter of smog control. matter of EGR and PCV
and all kinds of other valves to weigh it down.  Lousy transmissions
hooked up to kludgy rear end gear ratios.  Next question, please...
