  I've heard of that. I was ice cream if I remember properly. Although,
it could be yogurt. I never saw it. Anyway, it's hard to believe you 
haven't seen that in a video store. I've seen it in a few around my area
... I could find just about anything if I get the incredible urge. The 
people all over Manatee and Sarasota counties must've got sick and tired
of me calling up for movies that only Martians on hallucinogens would 
want to see. A friend and I did come to the conclusion that no video 
store around here is brave enough to carry "Santa Claus Conquers the 
Martians."

 >difficult to tell what movies...can and can't show...
 
  But, as in the case you mentioned, a big enough fuss can be made to 
keep people from seeing the film. I heard something a while back that 
was going to be a new obscenity law somewhere, and because of the 
impending threat, vendors pulled 
some R-rated tapes. That was going a bit far. The law never came out I 
guess, because the tapes went back on the shelves. The only movie I can 
remember being pulled was "Animal House"... I'm sure once I see it 
uneditted, I see why it was pulled...

 I suppose you're talking about why people don't like the book (Trying 
not to use the word "banning", as hinted in an earlier message). Well, I
read it and it was an excellent book. Those people just don't want us 
young people to read some curse words. That's about all I saw to be

They're not crap because of all the hype; the TMNT cartoons are crap
because they're bad, plain and simple.  Immense popularity may have
little to do with quality, but that works both ways--just because
something /is/ immensely popular doesn't somehow make it bad.  The
Turtles cartoons are bad not because they're being treated as a
children's show, and they're not even bad because they're using cheap
animation companies.  They're bad because the writers are hoseheads,
and have made the Turtles into California surf dudes with a collective
IQ roughly equal to a large Domino's pizza with anchovies and extra
cheese.  And, by making the Shredder and his ninja clan virtually
identical to, say, Cobra on "G.I. Joe," they've cleverly limited the
plot possibilities the same way the "Joe" creators did--every episode
has to have a nefarious plot by Shredder that the Turtles have to stop
in a five-minute action sequence near the end of each episode, during
which nobody can get seriously hurt.  Replace "Turtles" with "G.I. Joe
Team" and "Shredder" with "Cobra", and you have the same formula.  You'd
think somebody at the Turtles' studio would have noticed that the most
popular, longest-running & best-received afternoon 'toons of recent
years--"Duck Tales" and "Real Ghostbusters"--don't have the same tunnel
vision about plot complications, but evidently you'd be wrong.

How far macrosocpic? The galaxies are strewn randomly throughout the

   At one point, the universe might have been well ordered. Then the

That's not all it's losing. I don't know why, but I just can't keep a

because then I have to wear socks of different thicknesses and it
makes my shoes sound funny. Actually, they don't really /sound/

you tend to express your entire worldviewq using sound-oriented

And you think that's in jest, boy. There's a firm in California
that manufactures those front-end covers for cars from radar-absorbent
material; it reduces the car's RCS (radar cross-section) by a factor
of about 10, so a radar installation that can normally clock the
car from 1,000 feet can't even "see" it until it's only 100 feet away,
by which time the driver's had ample opportunity to slow down. If
you're driving a Corvette, it gets even better; the body is fiberglass,
all you need to do is pad the ends of the axles, the engine compartment,
and the chassis edges with RAM and the car is essentially radar-
invisible. I know someone who's actually done that, in fact; he runs
an icehouse in Pinellas Park.

The law of conservation of mass and energy in the universe states that
the sum total of E+mc*c must be conserved throughout the universe 
(though the law of entropy says that the energy gets harder and harder
to use (and Hofstadter's law speaks "Everything takes longer than you
realize, even when you take Hofstadter's law into account.")) Therefore,
there are several possibilities as to where the missing socks went:
    1. Though their component atoms all still exist, they have been
       chemically transformed into portions of a new structure or
       structures. 
    2. Though the chemical bonds remain, they have been shredded and
       repackaged into a new form or forms.
    3. A nuclear transformation has hit a sufficient number of the
       atoms in the socks to transmute them into a heavier element,
       such as gold.
    4. They have spontaneously completely and totally converted into
       energy, and will now power the state of Florida for the next
       five years.
Of course, any combination of the above might possibly have happened;
perhaps radioactively tagging your socks will significantly improve
the likelyhood of discovering which (if any) of the above might have
happened to the socks. The only fault of radioactively tagging socks
is that of growing cotton in heavy water. Plants tend to self-terminate
under such conditions. Sprinkling plutonium on a freshly-bought pair
of socks seems the best solution.

I tried but things like that fall under an even older law...
the law of diminishing returns (ha!).  My favorite argument was that
if any two students handed in identical (or even real similar) code
they would be accused of cheating.  With that kind of expected variance
it obviously ain't no Science - Just show me 3 radically different ways
to build say - a road surface.  I pick roads cause the science of soils
and such have some real "iffy" seat of the pants type calculations.
Point is - aside from materials and depth of application the underlying
mechanisms for the engineering disciplines are well defined and under-
stood.  Not so with Computer Science.

we did a lot of graphics and EMACS work so we in fact did run a straight

Even so we ported the ray tracing program from an Amiga and Gawd was it

Get real - the only GOOD reason (aside from not knowing any other 
language) to write in assembly is for SPEED.  If you are really cramped
for space - use overlays and an overlay linker.  A BBS or any system
that spends most of it's time WAITING for user input (and even at 
140 wpm it would still wait most of that!) does not need to be coded
in something as tedious and error prone as assembly.  
   Let's understand each other - I cut my teeth on assembly because
ANYTHING had to better than BASIC on the early Apples and CP/M machines.
With the advent of languages like C this became really an exercise
in self-abuse to write in assembly.  You can tell most good C compilers
to dump the output as assembly code if you really want to tweak it.
I do because I still love to tinker with it!  But I do not under any
circumstances believe that doing it all from scratch in assembly is
a necessary thing (for the type programs we're talking about).

You are correct in most respects except the south was not avoiding
industrialization - the North stifled it by excessive tariffs and 
trade embargos.  The war was actually precipitated because the
South entered into trade discussions directly with France & Britain.
We were trying desperately to get some industry but the North for some
reason took this as an issue to try and cram "We know What's Best" 
down our throats and impose the trade tariffs on us.  If Cotton could
not be sold overseas at a profit (the North wanted to get it super-
cheap see) then we had to use the domestic market.  A very complex
trade/political situation.
   BTW the original "white sheets" started with an organization known
as the "Knights of the White Camelia".  Their original purpose (are
you ready for this?) was to protect the blacks in Louisiana from the
carpetbagger governments.  Turns out the carpetbaggers used to hold
rallys with the blacks and then massacre them.  Then they would use this
as a reason to get martial law declared.  See, the military (under
Lincoln) had the power to REMOVE any legislative body which did not
suit their fancy.  This is how the carpetbaggers raped the South and
put her in financial ruin.  The military would put someone "friendly"
to the North in the governors seat and the carpetbag government was 
then legalized plundering.  The KWK (back to the subject) figured this
had gone too far and disrupted these rallies.  Then they took the WHITE
carpetbaggers and Scalawags and hung them.  Y'see the first lynchings
were actually WHITES. It was done to keep the uneducated blacks from
being used and killed by the Yankee carpetbag governments.  This 
technique, look and style were later adopted by the cowards of the KKK.
For purposes of racial hatred and terrorism.  Surprised?

There was an interesting segment on Saturday Night With Connie Chung
about the TMNT.  If you missed it I'll summarize enough to show how it
relates to this conversation:
   A guy who's name escapes me heard about the comic TMNT and liked the
name.  He bought a copy and said to himself, "self, I could get rich
selling action figures based on these comic characters (shades of G.I.
Joe!)."  He approached the two gentlemen  who created the TMNT and offer
ed them a deal (everyone gets one third).  They accepted.  He approached
a toy company who said "Action figures are blase - they are no longer
selling.  /But/ if we created a CARTOON first, /then/ they might sell."
So that is what they did...BUT they had to tone it down as the original
comic was geared for age group 14-18 and everyone knows not many 14-18
year olds play with toys.  The rest of course is history and the TMNT
action figures and accessories are the hottest selling toys of ALL TIME.
*****
My point is, the reason why the quality of the TMNT is poor (If in fact
it is, I have never seen it/them) is probably because it was created
with the SOLE purpose of selling toys and therefore they used a formula
that had a pretty good track record of success (G.I. Joe).  All in all
it was pretty nauseating to watch these guys sit around grinning and
counting their $10 million a piece (not including their cut of the 
recent movie) gloating over how they manipulated the young people of 
America in such a blatent manner.

Yeah, I had that problem when I was working on the DECssytem-20
in Pennsylvania. The Powers That Be in User Services (or Loser
Services, depending on my mood) were about the most paranoid, hostile
lot I've ever come across--sexually frustrated, no doubt. They became
slightly aggravated when I made an end-run around their security by
writing my own TOPS-20 command processor that would execute the
service calls for most of the neat things I wanted to do directly--
didn't like that at all, no, no, no. Of course, they liked it even less
when I suggested that since I obviously knew the system better than they
did, I was by default better able to manage it than they were...*sigh*
No sense of humor in those types (a requirement for an MIS degree, I
suspect).

I've been accused by more than one person of being masochistic...
Actually, assembly has more than just a speed advantage over high-
level languages, like efficiency and compactness. When I'm given the
choice, I prefer not to mess around with writing overlays; I run
a floppy-only system, and waiting for the suckers to load gets really
annying very fast. Plus I'm a great fan of techniques like self-
modifying code and other non-computer-science tricks (I've been known
to use the system stack pointer as an index register...), whinh you
(oops.../which/ you) generally can't do in high-level languages.
Besides, I don't have a /good/ C compiler. Hmm...now that I think
about it, I have what's supposed to be a really good C compiler on
a Cromemco C-DOS formatted disk where I can't get to it--it's 
formatted double-sided and my transfewr utility claims C-DOS formats
are single-sided only. *sigh* I still like assembly.

That is the way most cartoon shows get on	 television now.  A lot of
production companies aren't willing to go to the trouble of making an
animated show unless it has a toy line behind it, because they figure
it's the only way it'll become popular.
   Not all shows done this way have to be trash, but the only real
exception was "Robotech"--which was a toy line quite some time before it
was a TV show.  However, Revell (the company that made the Robotech
models) had nothing to do with the TV show; the production company that
made it originally decided to adapt a Japanese animated series for
American TV and discovered that all the American rights to it had been
licensed to Revell, who had named all the models "Robotech."  So,
Harmony Gold rewrote the series trying to be faithful to both the anime
shows it was taken from and what Revell had already 'created' for their
toy line.  Luckily, unlike the other American companies which had done
exactly the same thing (i.e., license Japanese giant robots from TV
cartoons), Revell had made all the Robotech "mecha" the equivalent of
F-14's and the like rather than giving them cute little robot
personalities.
   Anyway, I suppose I can't blame Eastman & Laird for making their
non-children's book into a typical bad commercialized cartoon, seeing
how much money they're making from it.  Richard & Wendy Pini of
ElfQuest want to get their elves animated; unlike the TMNT people, they
want at least veto power over any productions.  If EQ gets to the screen
it'll be real good, but they've been trying since 1979 and still have
little to show for it.

That's easy enough to do. Take your radar jammer, run a shielded coax
cable from the Gunn diode in the business end of the resonant antenna
to the input of a nice, big microwave amplifier ('bout 300 watts would
work nicely). Then stick an antenna on your roof and attach the jammer
to a radar /detector/ so it goes off automatically when you find a
speed trap. The amplifier will generate an RF signal that's powerful
enough to overload the Gunn diode in the radar gun, and blooie! no more
radar! 'Course, if the FCC catches you with that gizmo...

Turtle, et al you anarchists-
     
    My father has received two tickets within the last three years.
NEITHER of them were clocked from radar... in fact, he had a radar
detector. Both were due to helicopters clocking him from above...
and NO amount of stealth material, radar jammers, radar detectors,
or whatever can stop that...

  if I don't go that weekend, I won't be seeing her
              for an even longer time.

That's odd.  Green Lantern and Buck Rogers still have comics (well, the
new Buck Rogers may not have started yet, but it's going to come back
real soon	 if it hasn't).  Evidently his mother didn't do the comics
thing at all; of course, if she's in her late twenties or thirties, she
was growing up in the 60's, when it seems a lot of comics were kind of
being ignored by both the general public and the companies that put them
out.  There were always notable exceptions over the decades, but for the
most part, the idea of writing/drawing a comic without saying "we want
to appeal to demographic group 'X', so we should use plot formulas
'Y' and 'Z' for this title"--in other words, the revolutionary idea that
it was possible to tell an intelligent story that would appeal to adult
science fiction/fantasy fans without using any of the boneheaded comics
cliches that were becoming old in the late 40's--didn't show up until
the late 70's.  (Yes, I'm deliberately ignoring underground comics in
that definition, because I think they did the "we want to appeal to 'X'
by using 'Y' and 'Z'" just as much as Marvel & DC did: they just set the
variables differently.)

Also, there was the scene in the MARTIAN CHRONICLES with the priest and
the glowing balls of light, the aliens who were effectively angels.  I
don't remember the specifics of the scene, but a lot of people took it
to be implying that the aliens were gods and that Christianity was a
crock and that everything the priest had done in his life was promptly
rendered mush by this revelation.  I suspect this is what gets a lot of
ultra-fundamentalists: any time you show an ordained Christian minister
thinking, it pisses off the Christians who don't, regardless of whether
or not the scene could qualify as "sacreligious" without bending the
concept into a big, soft pretzel.

NOTICE:  Remote Control!  is now officially down......
 
I have begin phase #1 of converting the BBS over to the Amiga, which 
involves sale fo my hardware -- The BBS /will/ be up running on a 
limited 1 message base, E-Mail, and chat.....The BBS will then be moved
(In a few days) to and even /more/ limited BBS on the Amiga (Chat Only).
Finally, the BBS will be running off Paragon BBS Software with a 22
Megabyte 40ms Supra-Drive.  (Sorry to everyone about the 40ms, but It
doesn't seem I'll have enough money for anything faster -- You'll live!)
 
The BBS will be The A/B/R/A/C/A/D/A/B/R/A BBS -- We will support 
MANY Furry, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Anime, and Comic echos!  I am also working
out deals to connect to UseNet Anime and Comic echos!  This is all due
to the great help of Turtle, Donthen, Steve Hall, Niccoli Shapero (sp),
and some other Japaneese guy in California that runs the Valley Of The
Wind BBS for AniMag... (I will not even /try/ to spell his name -- It
begins with a "T"....hehehehe)  As far as I can tell, I my be picking 
up atleast 10 echos and possibly many more
 
On my agenda for echos includes 2 Anime echos, 2 Furry Echos, 3 Sci-Fi/
Fantasy Echos, A Few Storyboards, a Comic Echo, and a Movie Review
echo, as well as the TRans-Versal Chat Line.....
 
The paragon System will allow some great UD areas - I will also be 
finding some games to go online -- One includes a tradewars clone...If 
I encounter any problems with game playing, they /will/ be removed.  
The UD areas will include transcrips and translations of ANIME stuff, 
as well as furry/Sci-Fi/Fantasy stories, GIF's and IFF's and MAC's,
as well as Amiga...Cp/M....and Z-System support areas.  I may even 
include Apple, but don't look for IBM files on /MY/ board!  (OOhhh, I
forgot C=64/128 stuff will be there, too)  Hopefully 22 Megs will be 
enough for what I want to support....Stay with me folks!

several new ones parallel to the old ones so you couldn't tell which
ones to use from the air...)

Some people believe in Religion.....Some people don't....
 
There is a philsophoy around that religion /was/ OK to explain stuff
when we didn't know anything about nutin'.....But now it isn't OK 
'cause we know (or have theories) to explain everything except where the
first matter came from.....Here is the problem.....
 
Science states you can not create nor destroy matter/energy.  This means
that the same amount of matter and energy have always been here.  So, 
there has /always/ been the universe.  The universe had no beginning and
will never have an end.  The universe isn't irrational, it is undefined.
It is kinda' like 0 divided by 2.....You just can't do it....It just 
can't be explained in any way.....It is undefined.  
 
This brings up the problem -- Could god be applicable in this situation.
Does /he/ have the power to overide the physical laws of nature and 
create matter and energy.  And if so, god must be made of /something/.
 
Science states everything is matter or energy.  This brings up the 
question....WHO MADE GOD!?  He must be made of either matter or energy,
but it can't be created or destroyed!  What we have is not just an
undifined and irrational universe.  It is an infinite loop!  Not just
that, but it's completely confusing!  
 
This brings up the problem of multiple dimensions -- Could a hole have 
opened to another dimension that brought the matter and energy from 
/that/ place -- But what laws apply there?  We may never know...

Interesting conversation on religion, etc. Have you ever considered
god/goddess as process? What if reality is a synchronistic dialectic, a
multidimensional dance of materialism vs. existentialism in dialectic
resulting in thesis, except that the thesis is accentuated and sent into
active be-ing or motion by multicolorful spirituality...
This tosses out the theists but does not endorse materialists. It
also bypasses patriarchal religions such as Christianity.

Oh, boy, oh, boy... metaphysics. And questions that have existed for
the past three or four thousand years. Here goes nothing:
       
   Under the current laws of the universe, matter and energy can be
created and destroyed: Einstein showed this quite nicely in the equation
E=mc*c. (matter*the speed of light squared can be converted into
energy. And vice-versa.) A common example of this is something like
a fire: you are converting a tiny percentage of the mass into energy.
(If you claim the energy was already stored within the wood, I'd
ask which force was "stored" in the wood: gravity, electric, strong,
or weak.) _But_ this total of mass and energy in the universe is 
constant, at least.
     
   You said the universe had no beginning or ending: you're making
the assumption that the universe always has been exactly the same as
it is now. It is quite conceivable that God created the universe
exactly five minutes ago, and fabricated everything (including your
memories.) (This is usually not a good assumption...) 
   Going to something a little less strange, scientists believe the
current laws of the universe didn't exist before the Big Bang -- and
that our laws were created only after the first five minutes or so
of the Bang. The universe might have possibly had a beginning.
    Will it ever end? Ask me after a few more trillion years.
    
   Who made God? To some theists, that might be as silly of a question
as "Why can't I play compact sics on my record player?" Most theists
believe God is outside of time, so phrases that refer to time cannot
refer to God. It's also equally possible that God is within time,
but He is eternal anyway -- that is, He was never created. I'll have
to ask Him next time I stop in for tea.

A god/goddess as process? Synchronistic dialectic? Materialism vs.
existentialism? Pardon me while I get out my Philosopher's Unabridged
Dictionary.
       
   <Clip-clop; clip-clop.> *>BLOW!<* <cough, cough, cough....>
     
   THumbing through the dictionary...
     
   Actually, no. I haven't. I'm somewhat confused by your terminology.
   If you mean by your first statement: "The only god or goddess there
is, is the universe itself in its process of changing." then I disagree.
I'm mystical enough to believe the god or gods that exist can exist
outside of our own time and space: interacting, yet separate. Also, I
tend to think of the god or gods that exist in roughly anthropomorhic
terms: not in human bodies, but with human-understandable motives.
    
   Is reality a synchonistic dialect? If you mean by synchronistic
"all running at the same time" -- that is, with matter moving through
time at the same rate -- and dialectic as "able to influence other
items by some means," then I'd say yes. Every item in the universe
exerts its (usually weak) gravitational pull on every other.
  
    A multidimensional dance of materialism vs. existentialism in 
dialectic resulting in thesis. <Get away from Hegel! Please!> What's
wrong with materialism existing along with existentialism? I tend to
favor the idea that humanity is both matherial and spiritual -- and
neither is necessarily "better" than the other. Both are necessary
for a complete human. 
     
    Tossing out both theists and materialists is a bad idea. Too many
of both in the world. 
   
    I'm no philosophy major, and I tend to prefer to take on myself
a more informal style than yours. But, could you PLEASE (in the
future) define your terms fairly carefully so that we're both talking
the same language? I'll try to do the same.

Thpth! to you, my friend, for that excellent discourse on religion and
the universe, which is fascinating but for the fact that the prohibition
against creating or destroying matter does not mean that the universe
has always been here. Two problems: (1) The universe has not always
existed in its current form, and won't always exist in its current form,
simply because the processes which power it are finite; and (2) if the
universe did in fact come from a singularity, which the Big Bang theory
predicts that it did, then all bets are off because the normal laws
which govern the behavior of matter and energy break down at
singularities. So there! Nyyah...

this time, but if I ever catch you again...yap, yap, yap, yap..." and
drove away.
   According to Florida statutes, in order to be a "marked handicapped
parking zone" the space must have the universal handicapped symbol
(the little wheelchair figure) painted on the ground in reflective
paint, and have a reflective blue sign with the same symbol and the
words "Handicapped Parking" displayed over the space at approximately
eye level to the driver of a passenger vehicle. The space I was in
lacked the blue reflectorized sign.

If he/she/it existed before the creation of the universe, than he/she/it
exists outside of time by definition. According to most theories I'm

Well, dude, one problem with that article.  It's relevant only to people
in Sarasota.  Very few people outside the Tampa Bay area would find it
much more than wasted space.
    It may be a funny article, but from what you posted and from what
Tyler said about it, it's mostly about people who attend furry parties
here.  "Mythagoras" is already going out to people in California,
Philadelphia, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, etc.; we've gotten
six mail orders in the first week after the flyers went out with
FurVersion, and it's going to be reviewed in FURtherance #3, a funny
animal newszine originating in Philadelphia.  It's found its way to
people ranging from Edd Vick, owner/publisher of MU Press, to Richard
Pini, publisher/co-creator of "ElfQuest".  Stuff that's going into
'Thagoras obviously doesn't have to be "professional"--after all, it is
a fanzine--but it does have to be stuff that an interested funny animal
fan in Seattle, Washington, could pick up and potentially enjoy, not
something that comes across as an inside joke inaccessible to people not
in a particular small, local group.
    We'd be happy to take a look at it but from the description it
sounds like it'd be something more appropriate as a text file here on
aLTER rEALITY.

no i wouldn't give ted any respect, but pee wee is obviously doing somet
hing right isn't he. Not many of us get paid for acting like a stupid 
bonehead, but he does. So we can at least give him credit for that.
he is no great actor as a matter of fact benji acts better then he does.
all I am saying is hey he is an actor from our area and makes a lot
of money doing it. I don't know you but if you made a lot of money 
acting dumb, I would still have a little respect for you too.Have a good

...and I guess there is NO chance that we all percieve colors 
differently and we all actually have the same favorite color, but
our brain interpruts it to be somewhere different on the spectrum
of light. Like if I saw a leaf through you perception, I would 
call it BLUE, but you call it GREEN......It's all perception,
including the "disproven" things. Anything you state as fact, I can
say is not, and you cannot prove me wrong because I perceive things 
as I do, and you as you do.........be yourself, dude!!!!

First I must say I have also gone to see TMNT and I also brought a child
to the movie. Snakebyte I believe that within yourself you really wanted
to see this movie more then your children did, but you felt you needed
to bring them so you weren't embarassed sitting there by yourself. At 
least that is the reason I bring small children to movies that I wouldn'
t see myself i.e. Bambi,American Tail and the little mermaid. All of 
which I enjoyed. Now for the thrashing. I heard from the critic who
loved Howard The Duck that he enjoyed Spaced Invaders so much more then
Howard. He liked that real original story of martians spending spring
break on earth. Come on how dumb can you get. At least They could have
called it Debbi does the Space Invaders. Oh well I hope at least at the 
movies you were laughing at the movies and not at yourself for being 
there. Have a good week!!!!!!

want to go see it again & again, but people say it is Okay....

Hi!!  Glad to see ya back - I was wondering...
My friend just found a version with Anthony Perkins?  Ya know I'm not
sure WHO was in the one I dearly love (it's been years since I've seen
it - sigghhh) but it is in B&W (or was that 'cause the TV was???)
Anyway - educate me - which is in your esteemed opinion (and I say
esteemed because anyone who has my tastes has to be a wonderful,
kind, charismatic and otherwise brilliant person <grin>)
anyway - oh yeah - which is best?  Can I get a blank tape to you for
a dup - do you have the facilities to do it?  What's the plan?
I'm excited!  One of my favorite movies - now if I could only find a
very hard to find one called "BS - I Love You" - ever heard of that
one?  I think it is almost up there with Rocky Horror as a cult classic.
  Too bad about the sick - me too this week plus a round of general
depression - enuf to wanna make ya quit sometimes...

Seems that the radar gun is going laser tho - there are a couple of
experimental setups around Dallas that are also coupled to the 
infamous "smile yer on candid camera" system that I poked around until
the HWY Patrol told me to 'go 'way (it was mounted on an overpass).
InfraRed anyone?  I have the Road&Track article on the stealth tech
stuff which has the company name that sells the bras and raw material.

I wrote a nifty little scheme that used SMC (self mod code) once.
It was such a bear to debug - 'course it was /supposed/ to be!
Assembly is only efficient if you stay away from macros and if you
program anything of serious size you /will/ use macros - then POOF
your code size goes up and some stuff isn't quite as tight anymore.

Okay. Sometimes terms can be confusing and I tend to get carried away.
Also, the Process keeps going and I'm always questioning the previous
conclusion. I do believe that humanity is material/physical and spritiua
l and that the physical is spiritual. But I see the Process -- that kind
of god/goddess -- as active Be-ing, a verb rather than a noun. 
The existence of entities such as angel-like gods and goddesses are 
another matter to me. They seem to be more a part of conscious, less
active but nonetheless existing reality that we can experience more
passively. Just because we are visually on this plane does not mean
there are no others that may cross over and interact with us here. Maybe
it is simply where our concentration is focusing at that moment.
Well, is this making sense yet? I've been inactive in philosophy
but am reawakening this interest and look forward to further
conversations.
