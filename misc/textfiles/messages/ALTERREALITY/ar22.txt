Turtle,
   I never thought Id say this, but, this latest message chain with
Mr/Miss C.C.A. re: religion has made me long for those wonderful
discussions about abortion we were having a while back.
   Can anyone, other than Chip, discuss the pro-Christianity side
without falling back on the pablum-dogma crap they were spoon-fed as
children in Sunday school?

"Desert nomads" are hunter/gatherers and tribal.  Agriculture comes 
later up the "chain" of social development than H-G societies do;
saying "goddess times were gathers and argricultural and tribal" is a
little confusing.
    Nevertheless, I haven't read the book you refer to but if the author
is making the black/white distinction you paint, she's being awfully
simplistic.  Christianity came from an area that was /never/ peaceful;
there is no evidence I am aware of that the Middle East ever supported
the suspiciously utopic matriarchal society a lot of feminist
theologians believe existed before (patriarchal) Judaism moved in.  Your
(or her) thesis works when you talk of Christianity coming into the
areas where Wicca was the predominant religion; Wicca is certainly a lot
less violent than Christianity is, and could be considered matriarchal
in a lot of ways.
   However, anthropologist Margaret Murray's THE GOD OF THE WITCHES
makes the assertion--with a fair amount of stuff backing her up--that
the first known religion, which evolved into Wicca, was the Cult of the
Horned God.  The goddess aspect of the religion was added later, and
didn't rise to ascendency over (in many varients eliminate) the male
aspect until after Christianity--not Judiasm--began to threaten it.
   It would seem that if you are going to anthropomorphize your deities
at all, you should have both a male and a female.  If patriarchal
systems can lead to skewed worldviews, and there's a lot of evidence to
support that claim, that absolutely does /not/ mean that matriarchal
systems /cannot/.

I'm not sure what point you are trying to make when you claim the
Bible has sustained a 2000 year test.  One, most verifications of
the historical accuracy of the Bible deal with the Old Testament,
which is much older than 2000 years.  Second, there is substantial
verification for the Illiad and the Oddysey, giving strong indication
that the events chronicled is historically accurate.  Does this mean
that the many gods described in the literature existed as well?  You
would say, of course not, for many valid reasons ... the same reasons
that non-Christians would give for not accepting YOUR beliefs.  But
all this misses the point.  As you said in your post, the Bible is
"literature".  It was never intended to be a book of science, or
history, or math, or astronomy, etc.  It is a book of faith, and
must be accepted on that level.  Any arguements for or against the
Bible on the basis of anything but faith are doomed to fail.

could argue that one....no religion can be totally justified.  I 
/personally/ have never SEEN G-d, or heard G-d, but still I am asked to 
believe in G-d.  Why?  How?  I find that discussion on Religion is 
very interesting and also very confusing.  No two people believe exactly
the same thing without questioning it any point in their lives, can you 
argue that?  I don't think anyone could.  I think the train of 
discussion on the board is interesting, but still it seems 'attacking' 
in a sense.  Why not just ask questions and hope, or get, replies?  
Certain subjects are touchy....Religion for one.  I only hate talking 
about them when people impose their views on me...or rather, when they 
preach at me and tell me what to believe.  I have a mind, one that some 
say G-d gave me, so why not let me use it?

Avatar is another ANSI variant; as far as anyone's been able to
determine, there's no effective difference between them.  I've used Opus
1.1x BBS's (the only BBS software I've seen that does Avatar) with
terminals in ANSI mode and lost absolutely nothing.  It'd be nice if you
could find the VT52 superset that Atari ST's use--or for that matter,
just normal VT52 codes to begin with.  No color, but they get all the
basics (cursor movement, direct positioning, etc.) down with a few of
the weirdos like delete/insert line, etc. and do most of them in half
the number of bytes the VT100/ANSI counterparts are.  Most terminal
programs that do any emulation know VT52; for people calling at 2400 bps
or below, it'd significantly speed up terminal I/O if they could use it
with things like full-screen editors, etc.  (And you could still use it
with IBM graphics, I suppose, since they're not part of ANSI anyway,
despite what the people who write Opus think.  Assuming the people who
write Opus think ANYTHING....)

Dear Delphi,
   Being in the middle of exams right now (and having been kidnapped
by Donthen over to aLTER rEALITY cENTRAL), I haven't had a chance
to look at Mary Daly's idea of active Be-ing.
   Is life merely an active process? I'd say that -- clarifying my
definition a bit -- the thing that distinguishes life from non-life is
purpose. All life has a purpose for their actions. Rocks may move,
but they have no reason to do so,.
   I sincerely doubt goddess religions prevented all violence from
mankind, or (even if that was true) that the only reason for violence
to begin was the advent of a male-dominated religion. To repeat what
I said to Sauron, I find mere religion to be a simplistic reason for
the world's problems. Quite possibly, economics might have been another
reason: civilized (i.e. people living in cities in the Mesopotamian
valley) people had a lot more food, better clothing, and (possibly)
alcohol. The barbarians might have been trying to better themselves
by taking from others.

   Ummmm... Delphi, here's another place where we completely disagree.
Unfortunately, patriarchal concepts ARE a kind of truth: even granting
all of your objections to them, civilizations have sprung up from them
and have lasted for 4,000 years. They have served mankind for longer 
than almost any other ideology.
   This doesn't mean that they're the best for mankind -- only that
they work for large groups, and that they've stood the test of time.
Even if feminism worked for small groups, there's no guarantee they'll

   You hit it right on, Black Magic. There's no proof of Adonai's

the definition: God exists where we cannot reach until we've died.
   Why not use your mind? That's exactly the method I've been trying

I've got a termcap for VT-52 somewhere, but however, I have no idea what
the ST's do to it.  I had heard somewhere else that Opus did AVATAR, bet
when in AVATAR mode on an Opus system, my terminal went nuts, and there
was definitly no speed increase.. hmm I'll have to dig up what I do have
on AVATAR again myself I guess.  I think AVATAR may be an option most 
Opus sysops don't bother with.. I really don't know however. I've run
screaming in the other direction every time I've seen Opus Executables 
or system docs. (All those Opus sysops /can't/ be running it voluntarily
there's gotta be some curse!)  
 From what I got from the little blurb on AVATAR, (now that I think 
about it, it was probably in Telix's docs.. Avatar's codes are about as 
short as the VT-52's but they /do/ support color.

  Have you read the current PC Magazine?
 
 The do a comparison of PC based LANS vs. Mini's with terminals hung off
them. They compared:
 
                   A DEC MicroVAX (4100?)
                   A Compaq SystemPro (w/ Netware 386)
                   An IBM 80 Supersever (w/ Netware 386)
                   A Compaq SystemPro (w/ SCO Unix 386)
 
 I was pretty surprised, the SystemPro blew away the Microvax, even when
they upgraded to a more expensive model (4800 I think) The LAN's were
run on mixed 286's and 386SX's as remote's.  They said they were shocked
at how slowly the Mini's ran.. DEC (they sent folks to make sure 
everything was set up correctly and fine-tuned for best performance) was
pretty surprised too apparently. The most interesting thing was the 
Systempro running Unix.. it ran very close to the same speed as the 
MicroVax, however, it was by far the cheapest! (One SystemPro, and 20
terminals hung of a multiport board.) I can't remember all the stats..
but you should look at the review.. the NC library has it.

   Interestingly enough, most Christians believe it's the spiritual
heart that's important to God. So, not only are they trying to force
you into worshipping a God you might not believe in, but also they're

Hm.  Well, Opus 1.1x says "Avatar" for the color/IBM graphic mode that I
was running it in when /my/ terminal was on ANSI, and had no problems
with either Raven's QMODEM-from-hell or the TRS-80's DTERM (well, DTERM
did have problems, but they were the same problems it has with most
ANSI displays--no IBM graphic characters, of course, and it tries to
simulate color changes by flipping reverse video on and off, which
only makes things spectacularly ugly).  Opus' reference to "Avatar" is
the only place I've actually seen it listed; I'm not sure it really
exists as a "normal" terminal definition	 at all -- it may have been
something created by whoever took over the Opus project with 1.10 (not
the original author, who apparently left the MS-DOS field to port Opus
1.03 to the Macintosh, something I'm sure the Apple world will truly
appreciate).

that runs without loading is the "bootstrap loader." If you have a hard

automatically load the stupid software that normally loads from the A

ISN'T a startup alias that executes automatically once the stupid

stupid name; on some systems it automatically executes a /really/ stupid
piece of software called "Automenu" or a really /amazingly/ stupid piece
of software called "Norton Commander" that tries to act like a DOS
shell for people with Mac envy.
   Of course, the stupid piece of software that executes without loading
is also capable of loading a somewhat less stupid piece of software
called DR-DOS, a decidedly UNstupid piece of software called CP/M-86, or
a remarkably good piece of software called UNIX. Sadly, however, it

Did they, or did they hang 20 PC's off the SystemPro? In a mini-
computing or mainframe environment, you're letting the host do ALL
the processing; in a PC LAN, the host is acting as a file server, not
a processor, and most of the work is being done by the PC's attached
to the file server. (Incidentally, Digital makes a VMS software package
that allows a VAX or MicroVAX to act as a file server in a PC LAN, and
while it's at it also allows the PC's to access VMS resources and
can even act as a bridge to a mainframe, a VAXcluster, a WAN, or a
supercomputer file server--all transparentally to the PC user. The
PC client software comes with a bundle of TSR programs which can be
invoked to put the PC into remote terminal mode for access to VMS,
run DECwindows (DEC's XWindows implementation), or communicate with
a WAN or SFS or what-have-you, then drop back down into the Lotus-123

Obviously we believe different sources, but I do believe mine are 
credible. I also believe much of what we have been told throughout
patriarchy is conceived to keep us believing in black-and-white
reality. For a good look at what may really have happened, check out
Elizabeth Gould Davis's The First Sex from Selby Library where she
herself was a librarian until her death in the 1970s.
One of the assertions she makes (along with Elaine Morgan in The
Descent of Woman) and others, is that at one time we were only one
gender. It was most surely not what we today think of as female, yet
more female than male. Conception was parthenogenic. It was only when
the X chromosone mutated into the Y that what we think of as males
began to exist. Thus, even the dichotomy of gender differences may
be a patriarchal concept. If there were no men, why would there be
a male god? All this came later.
One note: matriarchal systems are not the opposite of patriarchal. 
Patriarchary is based on control and ownership. Matriarchy is
gynocentric, centered on creation and freedom. I believe where we
are now headed is neither matriarchy or patriarchy, but a matrifocal
social anarchy where what life and a new kind of inner power is what
is valued.

When we were only one gender, there wasn't anything resembling humans
around yet.  There is an OVERWHELMING amount of evidence to indicate
that sexual differentation has been with us since long before the
dinosaurs.  This also has absolutely nothing to do with politics.  I
also believe "my" sources--such people as Margaret Murray, considered
the foremost anthropological authority on Wicca and the Cult of the
Horned God--are accurate.
   I have a great deal of trouble believing that "patriarchy is based
on control and ownership, while matriarchy is based on freedom."  This
is just too black-and-white for me to be comfortable with.  If it is
possible to find any counterexamples, you can't make such a blanket
statement.  Also, a "gynocentric" culture could, in the long run, be no
better or worse than an "androcentric" one.  Female chauvinism is not
an oxymoron; if putting males in a position of too-high importance over
females leads to a lot of the problems you stated, doing the reverse
would also lead to a set of problems.  Different ones, perhaps, but it
is still substitution, not solution.  While I am not enchanted with the
status quo, I think changes have to be gradual (i.e., /have/ to be--
humans don't change overnight, or even over decades), and trying to
change existing systems within is not the best tactic, it's the only
effective one.  Moving towards a truly androgynous system will be the
way change is effected; the best thing we can do is try to guide the
existing institutions towards that course.  Ripping them down and trying
to install a benevolent matriarchy in their place is doomed for the same
reason trying to install /anything/ in their place quickly is.  And, as
I said, I think your implicit equation of matriarchal societies with
utopia is idealistic at best.

   Hate to say this, but that happened only a "short while," evolution-
arily speaking, after multi-celled animals began. Genetically, it makes
more sense to have two genders than one: there is much more chance of
genetic unity, and it also helps evolution move forward more quickly.
(It allows those who can survive the best to multiply more quickly.)
Needless to say, it happened well before even mammals appeared on the
Earth. (even before lizards...)
     
   You seem to be expressing yourself a dichotomy: that men -- to you --
are inherently controlling and oppressing, and that women are creative
and free and good. Do you really mean to say that?

I realize that our pastors and other laypersons are not always from God.
Our church just fired a youth minister 
for doing his job. I don't think that was right, because he did what he 
was hired for. But, he told some of the rich kids somthing they didn't 
want to hear. The point is,(this may not be exactly on the subject)he 
/was/ sent from God and was still persecuted for it.

Um, I hate to affront your reliable, unbiased, and objective sources,
but in the biosphere /we/ live in genetic sex differences exist in
every organism more advanced than a planaria, although I can't speak for
the authors you named. Quite frankly, I don't see any evidence anywhere
in the world of biology, or for that matter in the world of reality,
for any organism that is both asexual and recognizably human, much
as certain rabid "I-hate-all-men-they-are-all-engaged-in-an-evil-
conspiracy" types would like to believe. But of course, that's only
because I'm male and therefore (a) automatically a party to the Great
Universal Male Conspiracy (tm), (b) willing to believe anything that
disagrees with whatever view is put forth by an obviously more
enlightened female (who must be right because she's female and
therefore unbiased (?), regardless of the validity of her "theories"--to
use a term Creationists apply to /their/ rantings, too) and (c) willing
to do anything to preserve the male-dominated Grind Females Into Dust
(tm) status quo. Therefore, you may feel free to discard both this
message and any physical evidence that may support it.
   Thank you, and have a nice day.

That's "chauvinist," not "chauvanist."  If you're asking if I think
Germaine Greer is being chauvinistic when she keeps men from her
autograph sessions on the current promotional tour she's doing for her
book, "Daddy", or I think Spike Lee is being racist for refusing to
talk to white fans of his when he was visiting New York City a few
months ago--doing so under the pretense that they're not really fans but
are just humoring him because he's black... well, yes.  If a male author
kept women fans out of his autograph sessions, or a white director
refused to talk to black fans, you can bet the "chauvinist" and "racist"
epithets would be flying, and rightly so.  Maybe I'm missing something
crucial, but it would seem that for those terms to have any meaning,
they have to be applied /equally/, regardless of which sex is being
chauvinist or which color is being racist.  After all, they wouldn't be
problems if the issue of equality wasn't a problem to begin with.

Considering I wrote a BBS in interpreted BASIC that had hotkeys
(it would have to finish printing out the current command name it was
on, or sometimes the current line, but not the entire menu), I'm not
sure why they're not used more often.  It's really not all that
difficult... just execute the equivalent of INKEY$ every character (or
if you're cheap--or writing in interpreted BASIC--after every word or
line), and if a key's been pressed, check to see if it's a valid command
key and go to it if it is, otherwise throw it out and continue printing
as if nothing's happened.  Oh, well....

the 'second version' of "Satisfaction" is apparently being rejected by
FurVersion for being too nasty.  The sex in it isn't as explicit as some
of the stories FV's printed--including a few by the editor of the
'zine--but evidently he's edgy about printing something with graphic
violence, even though it's (or should be) obviously a Clive Barker-type
horror story.
   By the way, are you still considering sending a copy of that to the

Tsk, tsk, tsk. Such strong words...Lest you get the right idea,
I'm not especially fond of Macs (even though A/UX doesn't, in
fact, run under Finder...although you can run Finder applications
under IT). However, I do find it amusing that people who sneer at
Macs (the same people, mind you, who run 8-bit operating systems on
32-bit machines) seem so entranced with the whole windows-icons-and-
mice "thang"...it's like they *want* to have a cute Mac interface but
don't want to admit that there's something about the Mac that they like.
(BTW, have you seen IBM's new PS/2 promotional tack? They're pushing the
PS/2 as a Mac-like computer that costs less now..."We have mice, just
like the Macintosh! We have windows, just like the Macintosh!" Hehehe!)

Yep, folks, the system crashed AGAIN yesterday during a logon session
(the culprit this time being our very own Chip P. Unicorn...) Normally,
that would involve a downtime of about half an hour to restore a backup,
and Devil take any messages that were posted after the last backup; this
time, though, the reptile got *really* pissed at the prospect of losing
a hundred or so messages and rebuilt the message file by hand. Hence,
anyone who called for the last eighteen hours or so didn't get through.
I'm pleased to say, though, that the message base has been restored with
the loss of only one message...unfortunately, it was a mail message,
and Ghod only knows who it was from or who it was intended for. If
you've left anyone E-mail lately (like, on the 17th or 18th), you
might want to do it again just to make sure it gets where it's destined.
Thank you for your patience...

Dear Spellwind,
     I'm completely confused.
        1. How, precisely, is Europe censoring broadcasts from the U.S.?
           Also, which "One True Belief" is Europe claiming to broad-
           cast? Last I checked, about half of Europe was Protestant,
           and half was Catholic... 
        2. How could Europe be so closely banded together that it would
           have the power to do such things? Last I checked, they were
           still having problems with economic unity in 1992 -- with
           no plans whatsoever for political unity.
        3. Who, what, or why is Winger?

of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field
had yet sprung up... the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the
ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man
became a living being."

If you are not in Grace then you are doomed because you had the chance

When we see them coming, my dad and I run for cover in the kitchen while
mom deals with them.  Mom's not into high pressure, so she usually
purchases a pamphlet or two.  I love the line "We want to /save/ you,
and it'll only cost you 50 cents."  I did find the article describing
how clean your house/bathroom/armpits/car should be interesting.
Ever since I've thought up fun ways to deal with these people, they 
haven't come around.

No no no!  Bungee jumping is the cure to all your problems.  Your
turtle was much happier after his 3-4 jumps (did we get those on
tape?).  Not to mention we amused everyone in the patio area.
 
   ...Remember: If your not bungee jumping, your not bungee jumping.

I really hate to admit this, Chip, but the Biblical verse you cited
doesn't really contain a contradiction. In a rather metaphoric way, I
would say it is simply making the case that God made man before there
was /agriculture,/ not before there were /plants./ (There is a
difference between a plant and a "plant of the field," and frankly
the use of the word "shrub" in that context looks more like an off-the-
cuff translation of some peculiar Hebrew word than like a reference to
a tree standing less than three feet high...) Interpreted that way, the
verse makes perfect sense and fits quite nicely into both the "other"
account of the genesis AND the history of the world as it was known to
the Hebrews...

Nobody has the right to be chauvanistic. The "turnabout is fair play"

women have faced in the past. None of it has come from me, and I don't
recognize anybody's rights to behave in a prejudiced fashion toward me
simply because some random male was behaving that way toward her.
You might just as well say "I think blacks have the right to keep
white slaves." It just don't work that way.

Personally, I would say that that is insufficient as a cause to condemn
someone to Hell simply because /everybody/ gets the chance to "listen
and believe" in, oh, half a dozen different religions on a good day
and God doesn't seem to have provided any evidence that his is better
than any other...but at any rate, that raises a question I have never
received a satisfactory answer to from any Christians I've talked to.
Does an individual who spends his entire life never, ever having heard
of Christianity, Jesus Christ, or any of the other Christian ideas go
to hell for committing the unforgivable sin of ignorance?

Yes. Trouble is, they believe their fictitious construct as absolutely

support one view over the other, that's kind of inevidable. (Wouldn't

Yes, I know. That's because I created a device called *FF in the
operating system's device table, assigned it to a handler called
FORMS, and filtered everything being sent to the device *CL (the
communications line) through the *FF device. I then told the FORMS
driver to add a linefeed to every carriage return it saw, with the
upshot that everything going out to the modem had an extra linefeed
attached to it. Why did I do this? Well, it stems from insecurity...
I wanted to do something that that "other" 8-bit operating system
that's more popular than mine couldn't do. Sorry...I've reset the
*CL device and removed the *FF device, so everything's all better now...

Dear Raven,
    Uhhhhh... I don't agree with the philosophy that a works religion
would save a person. What, precisely, would God's standard be? What if
someone is "just on the line"? What if one comes to the One True Faith
(tm) -- whatever that might be -- on his or her deathbed, when there's
no time to do the "right works"?
   Also, what could we do for God, personally? If She/He/It/They are
outside this world, we can't reach God ourselves. It seems more likely
to me that if there's a "One True Belief," it's dependent on something
other than works.

   My role models are:
 
    Bill & Ted, Jason, Clint, Tom Savini (FX Master Extrordinaire), 
 Richard Nixon (best ever president), Metallica (Responsible for my 
enviornmental concern), Michaelangelo and Raphael, William Shatner, Bill
Richardson (Calvin & Hobbes artist), and any woman making over 150 g's.
 
   Oh, Turtle and Donthen are my role models too, but they're basically
the same as Bill & Ted.

I don't hold out much hope for Windows 3.0 simply because I've given up
hoping anybody at Microsoft knows how to program.  If the IBM version of
PageMaker 4 fixes any of the "problems" with PM3 (I've never used it,
but I've been told that it very much wants to be running with PostScript
like the Mac PM requires), it'll be in spite of its operating
environment.

Actually, I'm being weird, but that's OK. Weirdness is just another
small step on the road to Slack. And what could be weirder than
following a pipe-smoking middle aged salesman? The road to Slack is
paved with weirdness, and your trip can be financed with easy payments.

>I don't agree with the philosophy that works save a person.
 
That, my friend, is a fundamental problem with Christianity. While it
claims to have a code of morality associated with it,. Christianity
doesn't really hold its adherents to any standard of behavior in
particular--after all, the only thing which "saves" one is faith in
Jesus, and everything else is irrelevant. From a Christian viewpoint
it is very easy to see someone like Adolf Hitler making it into Heaven
by virtue of a last-minute conversion (assuming he were sufficiently
sincere, of course), while a pagan who spends his entire life working
selflessly for the good of other people is condemned to Hell for his
sins. I don't buy it.
   It also doesn't help that the Judeo-Christian value system isn't
terribly sophisticated to begin with--at least not sophisticated
enough to meet the demands of an industrial and technological
civilization. There is nothing "immoral" to a Christian in raping the
earth, dumping filth into the air, piling garbage wherever is
most convenient. To a Wiccan, who follows a much more highly developed
sense of standards, all these activities are gravely immoral.

Hey, Rufus, if you'd like I can get you a subscription to the
Watchtower... If you ask /really/ nicely, I may even get you both
the Watchtower and the Plain Truth. (You wouldn't think that two
fundamentalist orgranizations which claim to subscribe to the same
beliefs could have such amazingly incompatible worldviews...but I
finally understood why that is. They are both churches of Satan.
It says so right here in this Chick tract.)

I'll stick with AmigaDOS and Intuition, I think. If you really have to
do the windows-icons-and-mice thing, it might as well be useful--AND
off-shuttable. Besides, I've always wondered what would happen if you
took the trashcan icon from Intuition and dropped it into another
partition's trash can...when you emptied the trash, would the world
end?

   Hell yeah it's immoral.Not only am I looking out for my kids, I don't
want to wear an ozygen mask myself. I only have one problem with recyc-
ling, I have a ton of cans and paper with nowhere to take them.
 
 It may not look like it'll hurt bad in this lifetime,but if you don't 
do something, it gets worse! I saw a advertisement on TV yesterday for
'waste management' which means more landfills and burning. Everything
going on in this world directly affects you.

    You notice the other 'empires' were all of another religion, don't 
you? Babylon, Greece, Rome... Christianity is one of the few religions
that claims to be the one truth and not even accept beleif of other 
religions. The only religion(s) I disbeleive are all Judeo/Christian
myths.
