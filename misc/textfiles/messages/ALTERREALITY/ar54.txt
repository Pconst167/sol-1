Ya know, I've heard you say that (...Everbody is someday going to be a 
memory) and I don't like it.  I know, tough.  But just the same, I'd 
rather invest time into the friendships I have to have better and more
meaningful memories down the road.  This is not to imply that I'd like 
to lose any of my friends, but, yes, it is inevitable.

that can be as sensuous as the female form.  Even women enjoy viewing
other women.  I once did a portfolio exploring the realtionship between
the female form and the body of a guitar using my Gibson Explorer copy
(futuristic looking) and my 12 string.  Unfortunately I was liberated
of the color and B&W finals and all I have are the concept shots left.
Bummer.  I guess it's all in the perception.  I really like to look at
pictures of women as objects d'art but not in a lustful fashion 
although there are some very well done erotica that can arouse me.

sacrificing Lori's Soo-ba-roo to the gods of mayhem and mechanical

TS>  What do you mean "you won't  have any of those of any kind"? 
 
It was late and I was delirious - simple yes?  What I was attempting to 
say while shivering and desperately wanting to go to sleep was that 
would you reject a friendship of any kind just for the simple reason
that it may not last?  My definition of a true friend is simple, very
hard to judge and is admittedly a gut feeling sort of thing.  If the
choice came up that a decision would affect one of the friends, which on
one would he pick?  I have in fact taken falls for my buddy because I
didn't want him to - and he has done the same for me.  Kind of a form
of self-sacrifice.  That's not all of it of course.  There is also the
warm feeling that you can absolutely be yourself and you know that you
are accepted warts and all.  There is no need to worry about what my
buddy thinks because I know that it doesn't matter to him.  I hope that
I can get even a little of that across to you Dave.  It is in fact the
most rewarding emotion that I have ever experienced and I can understand
why counsellors say that your mate should also be your best friend.  My
second wife was one of my best friends until she weirded out on everyone
I still miss her in many ways - not the pain she put me through though..

No false modesty at all - I really thought that you were referring to

around in my own musical world for so long - I kinda forgot most of
the commercial stuff I used to play when we had a band in Ca.  I mean
I can even play and sing "Cheap SunGlasses" (ZZ Top) anymore!  And I 
LOVE that song - we used to pull a hid-a-screen across the stage and
change real quick into these Texas style Tourist sunglasses and put
on some super-sized clown (real clown supply items) tennis shoes.  Me
and Tom would both pounce on the screen while kicking off the 
song - they loved it!

 Thanks for the info, but I've got a complicated lifestyle that needs 
some arrangement. I eat lunch in school for one, for another, I have a 
job that takes up the hours after school (5 to 11:30) two days a week, 
and either Friday or Saturday night... When I get home from school, I 
have homework, chores, dinner, and a shower before bed, and I like to 
take a bit of time to watch some TV for an hour or two (if possible)... 
This schedule is ALWAYS subject to change, and it was just set up that 
way YESTERDAY, from a less hectic schedule. Anyway, one of the main 
points is that I /don't/ have the cooperation of my parents in buying 
food, and there is NO WAY the "family" can have a meal together during 
the week. It's a complicated issue I have yet to work out, and it isn't
too friendly when we do talk about it; my parents are stubborn. As for 
the workout, all I can do is some jogging or walking in the afternoon 
when I get time, and the stuff we do in school.

  I sorta was pushed that way before I watched it. Rufus mentioned it,

have been a religious figure from the past. In essence, it seemed that

I think I despise the expression "stud-muffin" even more than I hate
"babe-magnet." And luck has nothing to do with it.

That's too bad; they're generally a lot of fun. They have (IMHO) gone
downhill somewhat in quality during the last three years, in part becaus
the Ringling Museum has changed the fair from a non-profit event to a
strictly-for-profit event and because they've gotten large enough in
recent years that they're VERY strict now on what you can and can't do,
but they're still fun. I wouldn't /pay/ for one any more, but they're
fun.

Right now I'm running on floppies (two 5.25" and two 3.5" that were
ripped out of an old PS/2); the hard drive I was playing with briefly
has a rather serious controller problem, and since it's an obsolete
piece of junk it's difficult to find parts for. Actually, as you
read this you're logged on to a TRS-80 Model 4 (talking about
obsolete pieces of junk, although I do like this machine) running a
public domain FORTRAN BBS program that I keep hacking away at with
a debugger and an assembler. Nowadays, though, if you were to run a BBS
on, say, and Amiga or IBM clone, you wouldn't have to put up with that
sort of stuff; there are some really good (and cheap; read free) program
for both machines. (I could, I suppose, give up and "upgrade" to the
IBM in the attic, but God how I hate those computers!)

Does anybody out there believe that Turtle REALLY saw snow?
   
Or does anybody have a possible alternative for what Turtle was really
observing......
  
Maybe it was Tank fallout from Iraq ...
Or ..... Incinerated Baby Milk

>So, what's wrong with an IBM?????
 
Short version: The antiquated and pathetically slow bus it's yoked to,
its truly ghastly (and primitive by 1983 standards) I/O scheme, the
Intel chip at its heart, the fact that the CPU is strapped in minimum
mode, its clumsy and antique operating system (who in his right mind
would run an 8-bit operating system on a 32-bit machine???), its
cramped and limited memory model, its interrupt model (doesn't even
take full advantage of the processor's only real strong point)...and
those are just the things that come to me right off the top of my head.
I can go into more, if you like.
 
>What's a TRS80?
 
A TRS-80 is a Z-80-based computer made by Radio Shack. The Model I was
the first ever mass-marketed home computer; the Model 4 sitting in
front of me is a much more powerful and sophisticated machine that's
considered by a lot of people, including more than a few electronics
engineers I know, to be the best-designed 8-bitter in existance.

I see your point on the IBM. I've seen the term TRS-80 around and thanks
to you, know I know what it is. It's amazing what they are coming out 
with now in computers compared to only a few years ago. Yestarday 286
was the IBM standard, now they've got 386, and so on. And the prices 
keep dropping. What's next?
