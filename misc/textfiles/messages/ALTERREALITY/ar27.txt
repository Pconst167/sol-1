Hm.  I really didn't like WHO CENSORED ROGER RABBIT very much at all.
As a mystery it bit rocks, since the murderer isn't a character until
the last few pages.  The film isn't even loosely based on	 the book as
far as I could tell; they just used three character names.
    Some of the ideas in the book were cute, but they were overshadowed
by the fact that none of the characters in it were believable at all.
The plot itself managed to be hackneyed, which is a considerable trick
given the setting he used -- which wasn't nearly as interesting a
setting as the movie's.  And, the author had absolutely none of the
subtlety present in the script.  The Hollywood of his book was the
Hollywood of 1970's California cop shows; the 1930's "film noir" setting
worked much better.  The concept of Toontown was something that Wolf
(the author) probably didn't have the originality to come up with, yet
the differences between the Toon world and reality -- with the
undercurrents of racism -- formed one of the most interesting themes
in the movie.  "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" wasn't really a mystery at all,
and it wasn't as racy as WHO CENSORED ROGER RABBIT wanted to be, but it
was infinitely more complex.  This was one of those rare cases where
Hollywood's "trashing" of the original storyline turned out to be a
very good thing indeed.

I'm not.  "Promises" and "Double-Edged Tavern" were doing the best and
"Ace of Spades" (which would have been renamed "Ace of Swords" for
arcane reasons) was, evidently, too complex for most people to get a
grip on.  Since you're on your way to merrily overflowing the Tavern,
telling people what they can and can't do, and once again expecting
everyone to have memorized the several thousands of pages of notes you
seem to have on your world instead of being willing to play along with
the unexpected (and perhaps even silly), I'm going to try to bring back
"Promises" in the form it evolved into during your long modem absence.
You might have noticed that since you started strangling the Tavern
with your typical huge-storyline-ignoring-everyone-else, working very
hard at removing any possibility of character interaction, the level of
posting there has dropped off dramatically.  In fact, I'm the only one
to post there in about two weeks and I get my character threatened by
the "referee."
   I bet playing a normal RPG with you as dungeon master is pure hell.
You can be an extremely creative person yourself, but you seem to have
little or no tolerance for creativity on anyone else's part in your
world.  This is something you "risk" when you let people into your
creations; if you keep stifling them, they won't come back.  It's that
simple.  As I said on C. of C., have fun p1aying with y0urse1f, d00d.

Exchanging the person for an equivalent volume on air on the planet's
surface is a /really bad/ idea if the air on the planet's surface is
toxic, of a different density as the air on the ship, contaminated
with microorganisms, etc. Putting it in space is a better idea, but
you still have the problem of what to do with all the excess energy
the person has when he materializes on the planet's surface. Also,
here's another problem: suppose it takes one second to materialize. 
On this planet, in one second any given point on the planet's surface
will have moved about seventeen miles. So not only is the individual in
question going to materialize with a few hundred thousand newton's
worth of excess energy, he's going to materialize in a smear that's
about seventeen miles long. Eww...yuck!

  Yes, I thought it was kind of rude to introduce the murderer at the 
end. Anyway, I have no idea why I seemed to really like the book. The 
idea of racism you mentioned from the film seemed to be presented in the
book pretty clearly. The ideas in the book were quite strange. I can't 
think how you could live with someone[thing?] where you have to READ 
everything they say. The idea of doppelgangers appealed to me. Pretty 
practical idea, too. I was thinking if you reworked the story in the 
book, gave it a different ending (my idea would be to have the genie of 
the ending make Roger's doppel real, something I suspected might happen
when the book went off into the kettle thing toward the end), and you 
might have an interesting sequel to make into a film. 
  I don't know why I liked it, but the fact that the teakettle becomes 
more and more important (even though you figured it had no significance)
was neat (to me)...

>There are similarities between the above. Both are trying to

Depends on who you ask. According to fine, moral, upstanding citizens
like Charles W. Keating Jr, it is very much a function of government.
The honorable Mr. Keating appointed himself an "expert" on pornography
(he was an expert, you see, on the grounds that he had talked to dozens
of priests about the effects of pornography on children) and testafied
in front of the Meese Commission on Pornography, during which time he
said things like "It is common knowledge that masturbation causes
physical and psychological problems and can lead to insanity," "I say,
hell yes, legislate morality, and then enforce those laws!" "Pornography
is destructive to the well-being of women and children," etc, etc, ad
naseum. Six months later he was in front of a Congressional panel again,
this time saying "On the advice of my attorney I have decided to
excercise my Fifth Amendment rights" when asked about his role in
virtually singlehandedly causing the collapse of over a dozen S&L
institutions.
 
Obviously, Mr. Keating, a bastion of moral righteousness who will shine
on as a splendid role model for us all, never did really quite get the
hang of the whole "morality" thing. I wonder if it bothers him that his
actions were destructive to the well-being of investors in his S&L's,
some of whom were presumably women and children...
 
There is a problem with allowing someone else to dictate your morality--
does anyone /really/ think that Keating, or our illustrious governor,
or any other politician (or anyone else for that matter) is a terribly
fit guardian of the public morality? Any time anyone offers (or insists)
to guide our moral behavior, I think it's time to take a long, hard look
at that person and what he stands to gain from his selfless act.

Speaking of politics, NASA, and the space shuttle: Are you familiar at
all with the Dyna-Soar project started by NASA in the early 50's? The
idea was to create a winged, single-stage-to-orbit, reusable vehicle
that could ferry large quantities into space and return by landing on
a conventional runway. The Dyna-Soar was part of a larger project that
had a timeline something like: early space stations by the end of the
60's, permanently manned space stations and a moon shot by the end of
the 70's, permanently manned moon bases by the 80's and 90's. The
vehicles themselves would probably have ended up smaller than the
current space shuttle, but they had a few advantages, like the fact
that they were supposed to have on-board air-breating jet engines so
they could land under power. The Dyna-Soar project was scrapped by
Kennedy's declaration that "we will land a man on the moon by the end of
the 60's." Well, we did, but I wonder what the world would be like now
if the original plan had been stuck to. (assuming, of course, that the
government could be persuaded to provide funding for that long, and that
it didn't fall into any of a number of various political sandtraps,
and so forth).
 
Now, of course, we have moon rocks embedded in Lucite and a Tinker Toy
space shuttle that just plain doesn't work as advertised, and
frequently doesn't work at all.

The time before the advent of survival of the fittest was, in fact, very
quiet and peaceful, with no violence and no war...BECAUSE THERE WERE NO
LIVING ORGANISMS. Survival of the fittest has been the rule of nature
since the time of the first two amoebas.
 
Contrary to what you may find in books written by radical femenists and
nestled between scholarly works on the culture of Atlantis and
descriptions of how crystal power can be made to synchronize with
universal rythms in out-of-the-way New Age bookstores, there ain't ever
been a human civilization of any size (with more than, say, 50 members
or so) that's been entirely free of strife, violence, and other sun-
shiny things. I know lots of people will claim that this or that
ancient society that nobody's ever heard of was Utopian in every way,
and then generally go on to add "...because it was organized around the
political views that I happen to endorse," if you actually go back and
look at the real evidence you'll be disappointed.

  Who knows? It could become a cult classic and end up on Jeopardy in 
the "Bobs and Roberts" category. Where will "Akira" fit in? "Japanese
Film"? "Movies Shown in Tampa, FL in Converthed Theatres"? "Fluid

the producers. Then, we have to convince them that we DO have better

 I seem to have an odd feeling that someone here used to be a projection
person at a theatre. Or possibly, you might just know about it.
  Anyway, here's the question:
 When I went and saw Star Trek: The Motion Picture, the film was pretty 
good for a 12 year old print, but it had some sections at the start and 
end of the reels that were cut. Is this just because of age or the way 
the film was assembled? And second, the curtains of the theatre closed a
couple times and the lights and projector varried. The manager explained
to the 15 people who showed that they had a problem with "onboard cues" 
or something. I need more info, because I am kinda mixed up. I want long
and detailed explainations. I can always use more strange facts. Who 
knows, maybe someday I'll become a projectionist and have to replace a 
spliced section of a kiddie cartoon with "Demon Lover".

That's easy. We'd all have life expectancies of 150 years, the common
cold would be about as common as typhoid, and a broken leg would be

As a matter of fact, I used to be a projectionist at a theater, so maybe
I can help. Cuts at the beginning and end of the reels are normal,
since every time you put a movie up you splice the reel ends together
and when you tear it down you cut off about 1 or 2 frames on each
side of the splice. (When you wind the film back onto the shipping
reels, you also splice reel protectors onto each end, so the next person
who puts the film up cuts them off and loses another couple of frames.)
As a general rule, a reel is no longer considered to be viewable if
it's missing 5 or more frames at one splice, so a print generally makes
it to about 5 theaters before it ends up at 99-cent houses and gets
retired. The "cues" are small pieces of magnetic tape that the
projectionist attaches to the print as he's putting it up to control
things like the automatic shutter and (on newer projectors) the lens
changer and sound system; the placement of the magnetic tape depends
on the equipment being used by that theater, and in any event it's
/supposed/ to be removed when the film is taken down (although as
often as not a print will arrive at a theater with half a dozen
little pieces of silver tape stuck to its edge). Also, some
projectionists will use White-Out to mark the edge of the film where
two reels are joined to make it easier to take down the film (when
you're breaking it down, it's sometimes /real/ difficult to locate the
ends of the reels), and the White-Out can confuse some projection
equipment.

  I agree completely.  I just heard a story today.  I do not know the
validity, but I believe it to be true.
 
  A couple with a child visiting from Michigan came to visit Florida.  
They came to enjoy the beach.  So the family went to the beach with
their dog.  The women got out of the car, and the dog jumped out.  The
man got out, holding a beer.  The child got out throwing a frisbee.
The women was also holding a Coca-Cola (in a glass bottle).  They went
onto the beach.  A drive-by cruiser saw them get out of the car, then
proceded to arrest the whole family.  He then had their car towed and
took them downtown and they were booked.  Now granted, the arresting
officer was young, inexperienced, and generaly behaving like many police
do.  The Sergant had to book them because they had already been arrested
  The family had to post bond, then get there car out of inpound (for
60$)...
 
  To me this is a horror story, and it looks like the wave of the future
With road blocks becoming constitutional, and more morality laws being
innacted, we may soon be in a police state.

dead the other day and when we sent it out for service, they had 
replaced the hard disk (said the old one wasn't responding right and
they didn't have the equipment to service it). They yanked out the old
one a freind brought it back and gave it to me. It is a 40 mB, 977cyl,
5 head Magnetic Peripherals drive, P/N 40300. Yes for a PC compatable.
I took it home at hooked it up to my power supply and the motor runs and
when I hooked my cables up to it, the heads moved across the disk, 
waited, moved out to the parked(?) position and the solenoid to lock the
heads kicked back in and the drive motor shut-off with the LED on the
front blinking on and off. Everything seems to be 'mechanically' okay,
but I'm no Hard Disk Man myself. Any ideas on what could be done to
fix 'er up? Also, my driver controller card has a flat cable run to the
floppies that both plugs come off one cable, but my hard disk only has
a single plug on its' cable. There is another power plug for another
disk drive...can I just get another cable to run another HD from my
card?......let me know, I'd like to take my memory hog PC up to
72Mb cheap if I can.....s'later

1. Do you have one or two flat cables running to your hdd?
2. How many drive bays do you have, and how many are you using?
 
If you have a IBM PC, or another machine with full height floppy drives
count each drive bay as 2 bays (as one can mount 2 half height devices
in each).  It should be relatively easy to add a second HDD to your
system, especially if you have a MFM or RLL hard disk in it now (as
these are the most common for ms-dos machines they are also fairly 
inexpensive).            -Raven

Most of Animagic's stuff is direct from Japan; if it's not indicated as
subtitled, it probably isn't (there /is/ a subtitled version of it out
there but it's not an "official" release as far as I know).  Streamline
Pictures, the company that produced the English language version of
Akira, has indicated they are planning to release it and other Japanese
movies they own the English-language rights to in translated versions on
videotape and videodisc, but nothing definite has been set.  But at
any rate, if you order from Animagic, Anime Mart or one of the other
import places, be prepared to get an original copy of whatever you
ordered in the exact form a Japanese consumer would if they walked into
the Japanese equivalent of Camelot or Blockbuster Video, not one that
has been even slightly repackaged for American audiences....

another hard disk. There is an open male pin connector port on my

for the 17 conductor. I have a hard disk, the cabling requirements
match the one I presently have, but I can't get it to run. I think

Well, that is what my 'background' is in. My college education was in
Marine Biology. Okay, Automation Design Engineer...we design automatic
assembly systems with robotics, pick-and-place equipment, PLC controls,
servos....etc,etc to manufacture or assemble industrial products from
printed circuit boards to typewriters automatically. Sometimes they are
small machines (10' square) other times they are full factory systems
(ie- the entire plant for IBM Lexington, KY to assemble, test and 
package the Selectric Typewriters from rough/raw components into the
finished product). Right now I am in charge of the CAD group and work
closely with R&D for a company manufacturing pouch form-fill-& seal
equipment and related components. It's not big into hi-tech automation,
but the packaging industry is a little behind others, so the potential
for growth is GREAT. I still dabble in robotics and automation systems
on the side. Mechanical Engineering is fun, but if you deside to take
it up, do everything you can to get hands-on experience. Too many
engineers are book-smart and practical-stupid.

From what you described, it sounds like there's an error in the
hard disk controller, rather than the drive itself...possibly the
controller can't recognize that drive. Can you get it to do anything
/besides/ park the heads? (IE, when you fire it up, will it try to
seek Cylinder 0 before it parks 'em, or does it just sit there
frantically blinking its light?) It's possble that the drive is too
slow for the controller, or that the drive isn't communicating with
the controller correctly, or that the controller can't tell when the
drive is at cylinder 0...but these are primarily guesswork. Any more
info you can give me would help; also, you might want to ask Raven
about it...

I've heard (apocryphally) of a mythical "100-miles-per" engine that
got buried by the oil companies, and think they're mostly paranoid
bunk. To start with, a car manufacturer (particularly a foreign
manufacturer, I suspect) would stand to make a LOT of money from
such a device, and the oil companies themselves wouldn't have a great
deal of say in the matter. Automotive manufacturers themselves
don't have any stake in making sure their products guzzle gas;
they aren't the ones who profit by them. Secondly, I suspect that if
there were such a device, it would probably have been replicated by
now. There are certain practical limitations on the efficiency of
any internal combustion engine, and it's difficult to imagine a
gasoline-powered internal-combustion engine capable of driving a car
and getting 100 miles per gallon unless it's going downhill
with a brisk tailwind.

  Well, that is true, but my idea of enjoying the beach isn't like
everyone elses. Neither is any particular person's idea. I just don't 
want to go to the beach and step in doggie-doo or cut myself on glass.
Why some beach doesn't allow frisbees, I don't know. What I DO know is 
that I can't stand the beach with cigarette butts all over in the sand. 
It looks sick and I do not want to walk or sit on them, much less have

You prob. have either a st-238r or st138r hard drive.  The R stands for 
RLL (Run Length Limited), an encoding method which allows 1.5x the data
to be stored on the drive.  The cables to the drive should actually be
20 and 34 conductor each (but every other line is probably ground).  It
is a simple matter to ad another drive to your system, and another 30
meg drive should be _less_ than $595 (I see 40meg drives retail for
less than that installed).  Give me a call some weekday between 7p and

The problem with those engines is that they accelerate and go too slow..

If you read Popular Science March issue I think, they have carbon fiber
and other composites to make engine prototypes that are extremely light
and fast... besides being fuel efficiant.

1) Save it for a Hard Drive and wait until I get about $200 more...
 
2) Purchase a cheap used SCSI interface and hope to find a cheap used
   HD (Maybe even 10 Megs or something like that) to go with it...
 
3) [This one involves waiting until Christmas for a Hard Drive.]
   Purchase a Supra Modem Plus for $129 .... This is a 2400 Baud
modem with V.42bis (!?) and MNP levels 2-5 (!?) error-correction
and data-compression ... The (!?) mean that I know nothing about what
these are, how easy they are to use, what they can be used with, or
much else for that matter ... ALl I know is that it gives me 9600 Baud
throughput when I'm calling a modem with the same protocols...Can
you (or anyone else) describe these to me a little bit -- And can the
9600 baud be used with most BBSes I call that have 9600 baud or higher?
(Eg -- /MANY/ boards that I transfer files to and from use Courier HST's
that get 19.2 K-Baud ... Can I get the 9600 Baud with those?)
 
I'd really like to get the modem, but if you don't think it is a good

Could it carry more than one rider? Also, was it a gasoline-burning
engine? Small four-stroke engines can get /really/ high mileage when
they're propelling a total of, say, two hundred pounds at thirty miles
per hour, sure, especially when they're running on something like
top fuel or propane. There are, in fact, things you can do to more
conventional gasoline engines to make them fuel-efficient (my Honda
Civic had a 1.5-liter four in it that got almost sixty miles per,
thanks to the fact that it used vector-controlled combustion, but 
Honda's got an airtight patent on CVCC engines...) I don't think you're
gonna get a hundred miles per on a reasonably-sized passenger vehicle
with a gasoline-burning engine, though.
   On an unrelated note, John Deere is now manufacturing a small IC
engine for the military for use in second-generation generators that's a
miracle of efficiency. The engine generates abut sixty horses, burns
just about any flammable liquid (gasoline, kerosene, alcohol, Type A
jet fuel, liquid propane, top fuel, you name it), and fits in a bowling
bag. It's a scavenging engine that uses a modification of vector-
controlled combustion to ignite the fuel in the cylinders. It's not very
practical for vehicles, though; it's /real/ expensive and its RPM range
is rather limited.

V.42bis is a data compression algorithm, and MNP is an error-correction/
data-compression protocol. These both can give you an effective through-
put of 9600 baud if you're talking to another modem that's doing
V.42bis or MNP 5, but that doesn't mean you're connected at 9600 baud;
what that means is that if you're sending a bunch of stuff, the modem
will use data compression on it (kinda like what happens when you
archive a file), send it at 2400 baud, and then uncompress it at the 
other end. So you're still talking at 2400 baud, but it takes the same
amount of time to send, say, a text file as it would if you sent it at
9600 baud without compressing it. (If you're sending data that are
already compressed, the effective speed difference won't be nearly as
great). No, you can't talk to HST modems at 9600 baud; you are still
only talking at 2400, and if the HST modem doesn't do MNP you're talking
at plain old ordinary 2400 at that.
 
Myself, I'd recommend saving for a hard drive, particularly if you're
planning to go Fido with the bulletin board. You already have a 2400
baud modem, and not all that many people do MNP, comparatively speaking
...and even fewer still do V.42bis. (Besides, there are also programs
floating around, although I don't know if they're available for
AmigaDOS, that do V.42bis in software.)

If it's seeking Cylinder 0 and then parking, I'd say that for some
reason the drive itself can't tell when it's at Cylinder 0, but
your guess is as good as mine as to why. First guess--the mechanical
sensor in the head-positioning assembly is out of alignment or other-
wise farkled. Since it's not working with any controller, I'd say it's
likely not the controller... :) (Good diagnostics, huh?) I'd also

circuits for the engine, and every cylinder has a tiny combustion
chamber off to one side, with the spark plug screwed into it. On each
cycle, you put a small amount of very rich fuel mixture into the
auxiliary chamber, and a normal amount of very lean fuel mixture into
the cylinder. The spark ignites the rich mixture, which starts burning
very easily because it's so rich. The burning mixture then spills into
the cylinder, where it ignites the lean mixture in the cylinder. That
way, you can use an unusually lean overall mix without knocking and
misfiring, since the mixture is ignited by a moving flame-front and 
burns more evenly (and more cleanly). The only production vehicle
that uses that type of engine right now is the Honda CRX HF and the
CVCC Accord (early Civics also used CVCC engines, but for some reason
they don't any more).

7 candlepower?  Really?  Thats actually enough to read a book by, when
you stop to consider that one or two candles is sufficient, if not, per
haps a strain.  I was wondering if you knew what happens to those
stupid lamps along the street?  In my younger days when I would go a-
wandering, they would constantly blink off when you walked under them.
Sometimes this happened several times a night... Geee, I wonder if

If she does go into labor during the season opener (which would be a
really rude thing for her to do) swing by my house and you can borrow
my portable TV.  It's color, it's 13 inches, and it picks up 44.  Of

Those stupid lamps on the street go off when you walk under them for
a very good reason.  The lamps are equiped with a motion sensor, and
when you walk under them they go off.  This makes it easier for you
to be mugged.  No one has any consideration for criminals these days.

Thanks for the offer, but I think I have a better idea. On Quantam Leap
Sam once halted labor by injecting a saline solution into the mother, 
which got her drunk and slowed down labor. I don't know exactly what
the solution was, but I have a couple of months to find out. And id

I hope this is true, because Jean-Luc MAKES the show. One element that
I think makes the show believable and enjoyable is that Picard is 
just the sort of person who should be on the cutting edge of human
exploration and relations with alien cultures. He constantly emphasizes
that his mission is scientific, not military. A lot of sci-fi is heavy
into weapons and wars, and while TNG has it's share of both, you can
actually believe Jean-Luc would rather negotiate and learn than fight.
Besides, we bald headed guys haven't had a real hero since Kojak, and 
I had hair down to my shoulders when he was on TV.

  Speaking of Quantum Leap, I have been watching the show during Quantum
Leap Week. I am sorry I have been missing it! Luckily, I have been able 
to pick up the concepts pretty quickly (such as what happens to the 
person whose place is being taken) with a little help from my Starlog 
collection. 
   I really enjoyed the last two episodes (the ones about the lawyer and
the dejay) and am looking forward to watching the show from now on. It
is supposedly being moved to Friday nights in the fall. 
   Anyway, here's an annoying question. Does anyone have some of the 
original episodes on tape? I would especially like to see the first one 
(the two hour movie)...

I dunno if you can read by one candle or not, but I do know you can
write long, rambling, incoherent letters by the light of one kerosene
lamp. Once you're finished, you can mail them to people who refuse to
speak to you, too. About the street lamps: We had some arc lamps
at McDonald's that were on a light sensor, only the sensor was 
positioned in such a way that it could "see" the lamp. It was on a 3
minute delay timer so that headlights and stuff wouldn't cause it
to shut off the lamps, and it takes 2 minutes to fire up a mercury-
vapor lamp; result, every five minutes the lamps shut off and turned
on again. Really annoying. Speaking of which, I used to drive a
(different) VW Bug when I was working in Ft. Myers at 5 AM, and every
day I'd get up at about 4 to drive to work. My car had a /really/
noisy electrical system that spewed out broadband RF noise all
around it. On the route I took to work was a house that had a burglar
alarm installed, with one of those neat radio "panic buttons" ytou
wear around your neck in case you see dark shadows at night. Every
weekday at 4:30 when i drove past the house the burglar alarm went off,
and every afternoon on my way home I'd see an alarm company service van
in the driveway. This continued for two weeks before they finally
solved the problem.
   Just thought you might like to know.

The "Hasty Pudding Club" is an organization of Harvard individuals
who are, in a kind of peculiar quirky way, devoted in some sense to
the performing arts. They frequently give hasty pudding awards to
famous individuals for no readily apparant reason, but that's only
because (as they will probably tell you quite giddily) there IS no
apparant reason. Past winners have included Cher, who predictably showed
up at Harvard wearing almost no clothes.

Welp, it's much later an I'm almost sober again. WOW, a little 
intoxicated, my ass! I'll have to re-answer to posts that I answered
last night, I think I was trying to do myself in one drink at a time.
At least I remembered that I called here, I guess I wasn't totally gone.
Gotta quit doin' that stuff. I'm too old to recover like I used too.
<owwww>. It's amazing what you can (and can't) type when you're totally
bombed...hehe. Think I need one of those intoxication switches on my PC
so I don't DRINK AND POST. Well......see all you guys around. Just moved

> dump some of their ads?   [detoxed version]
 
In a word, no.  98 lacks the variety YNF has--their playlist is all
metal and hard rock, and almost entirely current.  You'll hear Poison's
new song on	 there, assuming you wanted to, and you'll hear "Lips and
Hips" every hour on the hour, but you're not likely to hear too much
old Moody Blues, any of Bruce Hornsby's stuff or the new ones from Jeff
Lynne and David Beirweiler.  They also play just about as many ads as
95 does, and their self-promotions are downright obnoxious.  I've
flipped channels on them more than once because I don't like being told
how stupid I am for liking 95.  The "New" 98 Rock has the same format
as the OLD 98 Rock from a decade ago--something nobody seems to have
noticed yet--and the grace, wit and charm of a Smurf-metal version of
the "Power Pig."

Well, in a manner of speaking, yes. I've just heard from Apocryphal
Publications, Ltd. (a division of Turtle Press) that Miss Sirtis
has agreed to re-sign with the cast of ST:TNG on the condition that
her character is more fully developed. Specifically, she wants
her character to be depicted in a more realistic fashion, with
hobbies (Denubian belly-dancing) and interests (the logistics of
zero-gee orgies) outside of Starfleet.

Much as I'd like to believe this, we all know that the ever lovely
Troi has three breasts too few to be a Denubian Belly Dancer. And we
all know that 0 Gee orgies have been passe on Betazoid(?) for decades,
even years now. 
  BTW, I finally saw "Hunt for Red October" (exellent) and did
anyone notice who Jack Ryan's wife was? Gates McFadden ! Our very
own Dr. Beverly. She was only on in the very beginning, had one
or two lines and was never seen again. I wonder if the TNG crew will
have the stereotyping problem the ST crew did, it seems like none of
the ST gang really had any major successes afterwards. No, I do not
count TJ Hooker as a success.

"Gnu outfit! How dare you wear a gnu outfit." A previously
somniculous mass rose from a dark corner of the room. Vafthrudner,
frost giant of Denmark, approached the mortals gathered round the 
bar. 
  "Abuse not the cloven creatures of my domain, lest ye feel the
ardor of my club. I didst smite Oden himself whenst he thought to
cross my land. Better you should turn yon shellhead," gesturing at
Turtle, "into a pair of shoes, than mess around with any of my gnus."
With a benign smile, the giant gestured to the barkeep.
  "I am Vafthrudner, gentlefolk, but you may call me Thrud." As he
reached for the freshly proffered mug, the titan realized there was
a burning candle within.
  "FOOL, I wanted a Bud Lite!"

"Troi look-alike contests" would be a good thing to see..."Troi act-

hobby as a Denubian belly-dancer. If they don't, i guess an act-alike

I think I'll have to agree with you after today. I listened to 98 at
lunch today and heard the same song twice in less then a half an hour.
<yuck>. I wish 95 would screen their ad's a little closer and at least
make them geared towards the audience (US) that they KNOW they have.
I guess I fall for 98 in the afternoons when their format seems a little
more 'flowing' then 95's and they usually don't have a 'live' DJ on

  Crispan walks in just as the two uniformed men are leaving the bar.
He can't help but notice that one looks a little reluctant, while the
other looks as if he'd rather be sitting in some dentist's chair.
  He passes the piano, noting the repiar work on the wall behind it, and
moves over to sit at the bar, one seat down from where Angel and Turtle 
are facing a large, brutishly dressed man. 
 Xon walks over, still looking with a slight intrest at the large man.
"Well," he says at last "look who's back.  What would you like?"
Crispan thinks momentarily about the mead, but remembering the last 
time he'd had some, decides on somthing different. "Something..." he 
speaks louder, to talk over the (hollow, noisy) music.  "Something in 
a bottle, that has a seal on it."  
  Xon frowns briefly, then grins.  "Right."  He returns in a second,
with a sealed bottle of water. "Here."
  Crispan looks over, and speaks loudly, "So who's the Norse Giant?"
His words fall nicely into the abrupt silence the ending song leaves.

  "No," ventures Crispan, "but I know a little chopsticks."  He gets

  "Waitaminute.  I spent good money on that, and I'll not have anyone

"Hello?  Anyone home?"
  Turtle blinks. 
  Crispan looks nonplussed, and turns his attention to the Giant.

He turns his attention to the Giant, once more. "So, thanks for the

As far as CP/M stuff goes: I'd be quite happy--nay, absolutely ecstatic,
running over with joy--to see your CP/M catalog. I'm currently residing
at 1895 Sanford Circle; that's the apartment complex right between
De Soto Rd. and SuperAmerica on 301 (we have our very own traffic light
now, so you can't miss it even if you try), in Building 12; just look
for a remarkably ugly gray Baja Bug. Also, if you'd like an obsolete
computer or two to take home with you, hey, it's a buyer's market over
here. Just moved machine #12 (a Heath H-89 with a ton and a half of
peripherals and about a dozen 77-track 5.25" floppy drives) in here, and
my other half is quite unamused. (Heck, she'd probably pay /you/ to take
some of the TRS-80's...)

Xon arrives with drinks; Turtle looks at his uncomprehendingly, then
with a "what the hell" expression tosses it back and turns to the
towering Norse myth. "Uh, you know, Crispan being here reminds me of
this time this really large nasty-looking person came running after me
with a club, and....awwqk!" He gasps, stares wildly around with the
look of a man who's just noticed that his house is on fire and there's
a six hundred pound kangaroo rat lunching on his Porsche, then picks up
the empty mug and turns it over. "What was THAT, battery acid with just
a touch of lime??!! Yikes, anyway, this guy was coming after me with thi
club, because I was trying to get into this tent, see, where there was
this wizard...you know, that's really obnmoxious music. Hey, Crispan,
know anyplace I can find shells for a...never mind. You know, there's
this turnip farmer named Crispan in Raneahdros somewhere. He has NO
life. Maybe I should give him mine." The turtle turns back to the bar,
picks up the mug again, and gazes into its depths searching for
enlightenment, looking for all the world like he dearly wished someone
would come along and say somethig profound to the sound of soulful
music. When it didn't happen, he looked around again, and brightened.
"Say! You don't have anyone chasing after you with illegal weapons
today! I bet you're happy about that, huh?"

  Crispan notes Turtles violent reaction to the drink called "Silva" and
decides immdiately against imbibement of any sort. He waits till the 
Giant turns to listen to Turtle, and dumps it into the spitoon next to
him.  It dissapears with hardly a sound.  He wonders briefly if such a 
substance could be illegal, but dismisses the idea. 
  He sets the empty glass on the counter and turns to answer Turtle's
question. 
  "Yes."
  Turtle waits for a few seconds, probably expecting Crispan to say 
more, but then turns his mad harrange back to the giant.
  Crispan turns his attention to Angel.

Well, I only have one super serial card that I use to convince my Apple
that there really are other computers - nice computers that will talk
in a nice sort of way given the proper circumstances...  I would 
rather not cripple my Apple beyond the framework of what it already is..
I DO have a Prometheus 1200 baud modem that I will dispose of for the
absolutely ridiculous sum of $75.  It is an internal modem that exactly
imitates the supers serial card with a HAYES 1200 stuck on it.  I have
to shake my head when I think that I paid $340 for it 5 years ago!
Anyway - I understood that 1200 is what you'd be running anyway.  I 
really do use the serial card to talk to my CP/M machines and my IBM's.
I *still* have to use my Apple to get certain Statistical work done
because I don't have anything that works on the IBM.  Mostly I need
software that curve-fits - preferably to a specified degree polynomial.
Anyone know of anything?

Hehhe - have him piss off the Frost Giant and get turned into a 
grease spot for his efforts!  Serve him right after his rather "klunky"
entrance which forced quite a bit of jockying around for everyone.
And THEN to further stir the mud by getting moony-eyed over another
recent arrival "whasshername".  Ya 'know a story line can only stand
so much before it starts to sound like Danielle Steele is scripting it!
I will probably enter my character after a suitable interval AND I get 
a better "feel" for the story line - I can't help but wish some of the
others had been so inclined.

Lady having motherboard problems - if you know how to get in touch with
her I have an 8 Mhz XT motherboard she can plug in until hers gets 
straightened out.  Or mayhaps she would like to borrow my laptop.  Or
I even have an assembled 12 Mhz XT with a 20 meg harddrive!  As
for the CP/M stuff - I will be happy to get a listing - I have tons of
CPMUG stuff which some is garbage & some is Gold.  There are enough
programming languages to keep anyone going plus macro processors games
DBASE, SuperCalc, WordStar, Project Management stuff, too much fer my 
feeble brain to remember but it is on about 200 floppies.  I got rid of
an H-89 when I left Utah too!  2 floppies, HDOS and a H-19 terminal
(also an ADM-3A and an ADDS Viewpoint)  I still have the cassette 
software (debugger, BASIC etc) if you want it...  Lessee - I'll see
your TRS-80 model I and raise you an Osborne I!  I know how wimmin are -
I just got rid of one -- no sense of humor when it comes to toys - I 
mean they actually ask questions like :why do you need another computer?

yea, I'll be running at 1200 baud.  I tried using a Prometheus ProModem
w/ the BBS software.  The software just belched and the card hid
in the corner.  That was my first modem, which I sold to get an
Apple Cat (damned fine modem, just the fact that I had to send it to
California every week kinda pissed me off.  Relay never worked right.).
Luckily, the people I got it from refunded my money.  Then I purchased
a VenTel from a friend (that's what the BBS will be using).  Then
I picked up another modem the last day of school which I later sold to
The Specialist.  Now I have a 2400 baud Zoom (aack, gag) modem.  And
somewhere in there I lent the VenTel out to Donthen.
     Like you really care about the history of my modems.

No, Chip doesn't support legislation	 against flag burning.  Go back and
reread the original message -- he's not a Republican.  (This is not to
say that all Republicans are for legislation against flag burning, but
it seems to be a real big partisan issue now that there's nothing else
more pressing for the two "sides" to argue about.)

Actually, the guy getting moony-eyed over Oversoul Seven's character,
Deva, was "Lord Valar," who seems to have vanished once again into the
mists of BBS'ing.
 
I'm going to try to get some of the Ranea stories over here for
downloading for people who are interested in learning more about the
world.  My computer was actually turned on for the first time in three
months yesterday -- everything works (amazingly enough), but the
keyboard is almost completely shot.  The spacebar is effectively dead,
making the system unusable for, well, just about anything, especially
BBS'ing and word processing.
