Guess I was lucky in one aspect about my parents.... they were both 
pretty emotional. I mean, if you were sad, you cried, if you were angry,
you yelled, ect.. I mean, I didn't have to surpress my feelings at home.
But I was kind of a hostile kid at school, my dad was an alcoholic and 
I used to take my frustrations out at school a lot..... so I guess I 
held stuff in at home so I wouldn't upset my mother.

Y'know, I'm rather proud of the fact that Kelly and I have already out-

who get married. I refuse to get married myself...not because I don't
respect the ideals that marriage is built on or because I don't want a
lasting relationship, but because I feel very strongly that in a society
where almost all marriages fail, marriage is meaningless. The
institution of marriage no longer has anything whatsoever to do with the
ideals of marriage, it no longer serves any function as a way to provide
a stable environment for raising children, and it no longer has any valu
as an expression of commitment or love...marriage as it exists in this
country makes me ill.

"Cautious" and "suspicious" are worlds apart...suspicion is just
about a guarantee of failure in any relationship. As for caution, I
agree up to a point...remember, "of all forms of caution, caution in
love is most often fatal" (Freud, I think, although I may be mistaken).
Sure, if you become intimate with people sooner or later you're gonna
get clobbered...but so what? If the advantages of intimacy outweigh
the risks to you, then you simply accept that fact and move on. If they
don't, you don't form intimate relationships. It's a really simple
cost/benefit thing, you know?

>/Trust/ is NOT the absence of jealousy.
 
No. Trust is what you have when you believe your partner will not
deliberately do anything to hurt you. Jealousy is your own insecurity
vented on another person or object.
 
>You can't control your feelings.
 
That's only true to a certain point. You CAN control the way you respond
to the people and situations around you. You can also control your own
self-image. Ain't nobody in the world can affect your own mental state
unless you /allow/ them to...although you can allow someone by inaction
as well as by action.
 
I say again: Trust is integral to a stable relationship. With no trust,
there is no stable relationship.
 
Jealousy is destructive to any relationship. Jealousy is a reaction
governed by one of the most ancient portions of the brain--the limbic
system--and should be left to the lizards and lower life forms where it
properly belongs. Jealousy has no part in the mind of an intelligent,
self-determining being. Jealousy is the single most vicious, hateful,
destructive emotional force in existance, and where there is jealousy
there is a relationship in trouble. Period.

So are Type 112 Bugs. There is a long and interesting story behind the
Thing, though...they were originally designed as general-purpose utility
vehicles during WWII, and where used by Rommel and his Afrika Korps
for desert fighting. They're really weird-looking because they were
designed to have a large machine gun mounted on a tripod in the back.
The civilian versions don't have the tripod mounts any more, but they
do still have the pop-off doors. The Thing is actually a Bug with
a different body; the chassis, drivetrain, and suspension are pure Bug.

I suspect it's a self-image thing, though; so far every person I've

1.) No.  That's a self-preservation...but, yes I can be insecure.  I,

2.) Sex is very important to me in a relationship, but it must be kept i
(in) its proper perspective.  I occasionally remind myself that, for 
example, let's say a couple has a good sex life, an hour a day, every
day, even at that rate, they still have 23 hours a day together.

You really shouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It probably won't fall 
into her hands unless something happens to anger me.  A short list 
follows:
Breaking treaties in Risk.
Picking me up off the ground and flipping me around the x, y, /and, z
axis (this really ticks me off).
Drinking the last Dew.
Not receiving $8 a week (well, this we can let slide).
 
Of course, if I die a violent death, a letter containing the messages,
a map to your house (which The Specialist drew for me a while back) and
a pawn ticket for a local gun shop will be mailed to her.
 
But don't lose any sleep, it'd be bad for your health.

True, true, true....the marraige itself means nothing... only the 
relationship counts and you can have that without the piece of paper... 
The only time that little peice of paper comes in handy is in legal 
affairs..... well, for instance, IF there are children involved and one 
of you is ill or (shiver the thought) killed, the peice of paper insures
that the children will remain with the surviving parent and he/she will 
be able to sign documents for insurance purposes ect......

TRhen how is it that a sexual issue is guaranteed to destroy any
relationship with you? You claim that you will not tolerate a non-
exclusive sexual relationship, but I bet there aren't very many other
factors that are as certain to end a relationship with you, hmm? The
thing with the power to destroy something is the thing most critical
to it. Sex does, as you say, need to be kept in its proper perspective:
it is a valuable part of a relationship, but hardly the /foundation/
of a relationship. A relationship built in such a way that a sexual
issue will terminate it is a relationship built on air, you know? IMHO,
dishonesty or violation of trust ought to be better candidates for
"legitimate reasons to end a relationship" than some issue of sexual
fidelity, for God's sake!

That's absolutely true. We do, however, have control over the sorts of
personal interactions we choose to engage in. The knowledge that being
hurt is worth the advantages doesn't make it hurt any less, but it does
allow you to /choose/ to continue to become intimate with people even

Neither one. I simply don't allow my /behavior/ to be governed by my

actions by themselves; they simply try to make you behave in a certain
way. You feel hungry, you feel horny, you feel angry, you feel afraid;
these feelings don't govern you. You don't eat because your hunger has
taken posession of your body; you eat because your hunger makes you
feel as though eating is a good thing to do. You still CHOOSE to eat.
You hit somebody not because your anger forces you to, but because you
choose to, with the knowledge that you are angry at this person. Your
physicla movements are still under your conscious control. Feelings,
by themselves, are incapable of any sort of independant expression.

Oh, come off it. Stop creating false dichotomies and start thinking with
your other head. The fact that your partner has other lovers doesn't
mean she's busy screwing everything with a rod. I wouldn't want such
a partner, either, but that's not the type of thing I'm talking about...
I'm simply pointing out that not being able to tolerate the fact that
your dear beloved might ever even remotely entertain the thought of
anyone else is silly (and pathetic). As for catching something second-
hand: If you're sexually active that's a rish you take, period. Mature,
responsible adults can deal with that risk. If your partner is not a
mature, responsible adult, you've got problems that have nothing to do
with sex...and if she is, it's an irrelevant argument.

Well, I'm inherently distrustful of any statement that starts with the
word "everyone," especially when discussing complex emotional issues,
but even granting your point that's still no reason for jealousy. You
don't have to be totally secure to have faith in your relationship, and
you can entertain doubts about the stability of your relationship
without becoming jealous over unrelated matters...and sexual matters are
not usually the real problem with a troubled relationship.

Bunk. There is *no* sexually transmitted disease that has a 100%
transmission rate. Simple disease epidemology tells you that that theory
isn't worth the electrons it takes to write it on the screen. That
doesn't mean that there is *no* risk, mind you, not by a long shot...the
risk is real, and it most certainly calls for caution. It does not call
for hype and distortion, though, and the simple fact of the matter is
if you are hetersexual and don't abuse drugs intervenously you are
far more likely to die in a car accident on your way to a lover's house
than you are to contract a fatal STD from a lover even if you're pretty
adept at getting around. If you're appropriately cautious, selective in
your lovers, and conduct yourself with maturity and responsibility,
and you treat sex with the respect due to a powerful bond of friendship
and intimacy, the risks become very small indeed. And, like I mentioned
before, not being faithful to one partner does ***!!!NOT!!!*** mean you
or your lover will go around fucking every animate object in town.

   When last I checked, the divorce rate was about 55%.  Forty-five
percent of something is not "almost all."
     
   Also, a majority of marriages fail early on in the relationship --
or after the children are off to college.  (This info might be a bit
outdated.)  Marriage may not be the most stable environment imaginable
for raising children, but (from the above) it tends to do a fair job.
    
   Right now, marriage is the only institution around which is expressly
for the raising of children. Until something new (and demonstrably 
better) comes along, we're stuck with it.  (BTW, does anyone know if
there exist statistics for unmarried couples: how long they stick 
together?  Of course, any data like that would be biased.)

   Kiwi: A tiny, ugly-looking fruit which is green on the inside. Sour-

   Star fruit: Also known as "camambola" (Sp? My Webster's doesn't have

But it's always going to be a factor here on Earth... there are lots of 
jealous people. Maybe the situation you are in now deems that you don't 
have to deal with that emotion, but that's a rare situation.... jealousy
exists to some degree in (I won't say every) almost all relationships. 
 
I don't like jealousy, I don't like feeling it and I don't like seeing 
it.... but it exists so I will deal with it as long as it doesn't become
a major issue...... if it does, it's time to re-evaluate the 
relationship..... 
Like you've said yourself, each person is an individual, full of

individuals..... they are bound to be negitive emotions involved in

Message Number 16262

>Incidentally, what the *hell* is flicker noise?????
 
Flicker noise is a characteristic exhibited by a lot of chaotic systems.
It's the type of unpredictable state transitions you see in a non-
continuous chaotic system that displays brief, drastic state changes
between periods of apparant stability. If you want to see it i action,
just turn over an hourglass...the sand'll pile up to a certain point
nice and quiet-like, then suddenly landslide to a new state, and pile
up quietly, and landslide. A common characteristic is that tiny changes
in the system--the addition of /one/ grain of sand--can cause a sudden
catastrophic change in the system, and it is absolutely impossible to
predict the magnitude of the change except in certain broad limits
(there will always be more small changes than large changes, for
example). Also, the ratio of small to large shifts is relatively
constant over any number of iterations, meaning that the behavior of the
system is fractal, and if you plot the number of shifts of various
magnitudes over a given number of transitions you'll get a nice, smooth
curve. Any chaotic system that behaves this way is said to exhibit
flicker noise. I brought it up because I was thinking about chaos theory
about a week ago and noticed that some relationships I've seen work the
same way--the system tends to drive itself to the brink of instability,
then realign drastically at a seemingly trivial change. You know, like
couples who seem perfectly happy until--whammy!--the slightest stress
explodes into a major confrontation way out of proportion to whatever
caused the stress in the first place. All systems which exhibit flicker
noise can /seem/ to be perfectly solid and stable while actually being
a hairbreath away from disaster, so one grain of sand or one trivial
disagreement can cause the whole thing to come crashing down. They're
non-linear, see, and...hell, I'm out of space.

No age has /ever/ been a good day and age to sleep around, with the
sole exception of that brief interlude between the discovery of
penecillin and the advent of the first antibiotic-resistant microbes.
What people don't realize is that the existance of an incurable
sexually-transmitted disease that can kill you isn't some new horror,
it's been the norm for almost all of human history. There has been
exactly /one/ generation in all the time since the advent of man that
could say it didn't have to worry about dying of something contracted
from a lover.
 
Yes, AIDSD and other STD's are a risk. So is driving your car...in fact,
driving your car is several orders of magnitude more dangerous than
sex. It's a matter of /relative/ risk. Do you realize that your chances
of being struck by lightning are about three times greater than your
chances of contracting AIDS via hetersexual sexual intercourse with a
person chosen at random from somewhere inside the United States? You're
more likely to get hepatitis-B than AIDS from normal sexual intercourse,
and I don't notice any widespread fear of hepatitis or any radical
change in anyone's sexual behavior because of it. And, sure 'nuff,
hepatitis can kill you.
 
I'm not downplaying the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted
disease from casual or careless sex, and I'm certainly not advocating
going out and sleeping around. I /am/ rational about the risk of STD's,
though, and I /am/ rational about being careful to avoid them and
behaving in a responsible manner when I'm in a sexual situation. People
who don't take steps to protect themselves when they're having sex are
idiots, just like people who don't wear seatbelts are idiots...but the
fact that driving a car and engaging in sexual intercourse both have
risks is not, by itself, a valid reason not to drive or have sex. I

Nope...star fruit are star shaped (hence the name) yellow fruits.  Kiwi

   Now that we've run out of nouns to call people, what about other

(Mein Gott, do we agree on something?)  I consider sexual fidelity to be
a part of trust: if the relationship is set up with sexual fidelity in
the mind of both partners, that's a part of the trust.
     
   Yes, my relationship with Jenn weathered a lot of storms... but, in
the end, the thing that killed it was not sexual fidelity, nor lack of
trust -- just the subtle distancing that comes of two people not sharing
enough experiences together.  (And, what's confusing: She seems to be
coming back! Waaaaah.)

   That's a perfectly logical and rational reason to insist on mutual
monogamy.  No -- she might not catch something (or he might not) if 
[s]he sleeps with someone else who is infected... but why take chances?
    
> And on the other hand, if she needs someone besides me, then quite
> apparently she doesn't need me.*
    
   *Klank!*  Huh?  That makes no sense whatsoever.  The fact that you
might not be able to satisfy all of your girlfriend's needs does NOT
mean she doesn't need you.
   
   In my relationship with Jenn, we were (and still are!) very close 
friends.  But we didn't share all of the same interests.  We both enjoy
certain things (cooking, science fiction, and unusual movies), but we
both have some very different interests and different friends.  I can't
talk with her about certain topics, because I know next to nothing about
them:  she turns to other friends for that.  I can't talk with Jenn
about all of my interests, because she knows next to nothing about them.
(For example, I can't talk "math" to her, without taking about an hour
to explain the basic concepts first.)
    
   We learned very quickly in our relationship that we CAN'T be every-
thing to each other... but that it didn't matter.  As long as we had
each other for the emotional support, and as long as we shared interests
in common, we were still in love.
   
> ...I have no lover that wants to sleep around.
    
   I sure didn't!  And neither did Jenn!  A person can't control whether
they want to sleep around or not: but they can control whether or not
they actually sleep around.

Speaking of weird names in general, I heard of this one set of parents 
who did something rather cruel to their daughter....The family surname 
was Falls.  And they named their daughter, "Water."  I heard that these
parents didn't mentally survive the drug era of the 60's too well, and 
hence a daughter named, Water Falls.

A sexual issue will destroy a relationship with me, that is true, but so
will dishonestly and violation of trust.  I have sometimes forgiven 
unfaithfulness, and lies, and breeches of my trust, but I don't like to.
I'm not going to enter a relationship if I know that the girl wants to 
see other people....usually that kind of information is learned in the 
beginning of a relationship.
T> A relationship built in such a way that a sexual issuse will 
T> terminate it is a relationship built on air, you know? 
 
Wrong...A relationship where intimacy is exclusive shared allows for the
two people to get closer to each other.  It allows for a /stronger/ 
foundation to be built.  It is pure foolishness to allow yourself to get
very close to someone who has other lovers, you are virtually guaranteed
to get hurt.  But, if you and your mate are only having sexual 
interaction with another, it can add to the cohesiveness of the 
relationship.

To make a more obvious point, if one of your lovers in an open 
relationship decides to remain faithful to one of her other lovers, 
then she has just changed something in your relationship.

We are not talking about /thoughts/, we are talking about actions.  I 
wouldn't care if my girlfriend thought about other men, or fantasized 
about other men.  That has nothing to do with anything.   I will not
tolerate her seeing someone else while we are together.  Just as a 
clarifier, I have been in relationships where it was /established/ at
the outset, that /we/ could see other people..In that kind of 
relationship, I don't even bother trying to get close to that person, 
basically, we would spend some time together, but we were just a 
fuck-buddy for the other.  Nothing more.  If I want a meaningful 
relationship with someone, then I stipulant that neither her and 
myself will be involved with anyone.  If she finds this not to her 
liking, she knows where the door is.

T> Where do you draw the line, and why? 
  
If I am involved in a serious relationship with a woman, I will not 
tolerate her FRENCH-kissing another man.  (I don't have a problem with 
a normal kiss exchanged between two people.)  I will be faithful to 
her, and she will be faithful to me, if not, she's history.  Period. 
Anything from french kissing to sleeping together.  That's where I 
draw the line.  
Now, for the 'why' portion of your question.  
  
  Because I feel that if two people are intimate with one another 
then that relationship can be allowed to run deep emotionally.  If, on 
the other had, no commitment is made, and therefore, you can sleep
with whoever you choose, then I question your depth of feeling for your 
lover.

Ok, so look at it like this: in a world of absolutes, which I live
in (absolutely) if I can take no other lover than my current lover,
then she can have no other as well.  With this in mind, consider:
She is not completely happy with the sex aspect of our relationshipm
so in a fit of pique, she decides to try someone else.  Rather than h
have this happen, I would rather she broke up with me *before* she
took someone else, because until she found out if she was *clean* after
that, I wouldn't want to sleep with her.  Abosolutely, no exceptions.

And what would your ideal marriage be like?  Trusting, committed

For myself, I have been married for 7 years.  I love my honey more 
now than before.  Sure, we've had our problems..who hasn't?  But a 
truely idealic marriage doesn't exist (except the Beavers parents
marriage) and who really believs that type of marriage exists or
ever existed.  A good marriage is possible, but not without bumps.  I 
Don't think the type of marriage that won't make /you/ ill EVER
