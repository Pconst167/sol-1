   You can go to a Star Trek convention and find ROBOTECh stuff. Comic 
conventions don't happen that often anymore, but there are Trek cons 
every year. Sometimes twice a year. If I see anything you might like,

  All I remember was that I heard Siskel & Ebert complaining that movies

the screen wider, so I assumed that they were TV screen-shaped in the

Of course not. The religious fundamentalists would scream about the
portrayal of witches in the book, child psychologists would cluck their
tongues about the damaging effects of having the main character melt
a witch, parents would complain that Dorothy displays far too much
initiative for her own good and therefore the book is clearly designed
to subvert parental authority, anti-drug crusaders would say that the
book is describing what /must/ be a drug trip, and school boards would
ban it in school libraries because it communicates the wrong lessons
to young minds.

  The discs that are letterboxed that you mentioned are available here

is the EXCELLENT film "Innerspace".
  On the laserdisc front, the letterboxed version of "Ghostbusters" is 
VERRRRRRRRRRY good, and "E.T." is also letterboxed on disc. "Roger
Rabbit" will be on a letterboxed disc within the next few months. Also, 
I would like to see the disc of "Poltergeist" as it is also letterboxed.
Also, I would like a laserdisc player! hehehe... 
  Oh, just remembered, the new tape release of "Ghostbusters II" is half
letterboxed up to the credits, where it is fully letterboxed.

I saw this most amazing thing once...a video disc player that didn't
use a laser. The disc had a groove in it like a record, and the video-
disc player actually had a needle! It was a really neat idea. It didn't
work too well, though; the groove on the disc was /very/ narrow, and
it tended to skip (a somewhat interesting thing to watch). The discs
themselves were pretty. Normally, they're sealed in a plastic carrier
and you can't see them (or touch them), but I broke one open once.
It's really shiny...and diffracts light in some amazing ways.

The new drive is somewhat slower than the 5.25" (Hey, it's from an IBM.
What do you want?) and is a good deal flakier (ditto, and the fact that
Turtle had to kludge an interface for it doesn't help...) Anyway, I

Well, I've heard all the classics, except for these few, which by the 
way are also among my favorites, These animation classics seem to be 
making huge comebacks (which they always seem to do) but I was wondering
what happened to "100 and 1 Dalmations", and "Jungle Boy", and ALSO, a
VERY classic flick that was realeased a relatively short time ago in
animation land, though done by totally different animators (The
animation in this flick was rated top of the line at it's time of 
release) and that was "Heavy Metal". Since the release of Heavy Metal,
I have yet to see such quality animation in a full length feature
cartoon (if you can call it that) and it's storyline as yet unmatched.
There were segments in the movie "The Wall" which matched the quality
of the animation techniques used in Heavy Metal, but was only in short
visual bursts of fantastic animation.

 Disney has a LONG line of classic animated films they have yet to put
on video. They often release them to theatres. For instance, "Peter Pan"
was released at least twice in the last 8 years. Anyway, that film and
others such as "Jungle Book" and "101 Dalmations" and the absolute #1 
Disney classic, "Snow White" will have to wait a while for a video 
release. Now that Disney's big movies are out ("Bambi", "Cinderella", 
etc.), I would guess that "Peter Pan" or "Fantasia" might be in line for
release soon.

Hm.  "Heavy Metal" had some really good animation and some so-so
animation, depending on who was doing it (each segment was done by a
different team).  The storylines of each individual segment were good,
although the connecting device of the Evil Green Ball from Hell was a
damn silly idea.  I think the best animation done in the 80's is the
movie "Rock and Rule," which also had a pretty good storyline and a
fairly impressive soundtrack to boot.  It is, coincidentally enough,
the only movie with anthropomorphic characters who could be considered
furries instead of funny animals.

Rock and Rule is also, coincidentally enough, animated by the same

Gosh, this bulletin board has gotten really slow, hasn't it? I knew this

base is more than twice as large now; I guess the speed decrease will
have to be lived with. Kind of weird, though; the /only/ reason I like
PBBS at all is the fact that it's a fast system, so for the sake of
speed I am willing to overlook its weird problems and general klunkiness
and lack of flexibility; now it appears that that  one advantage has
been tossed out the window. *Sigh* I may yet end up setting up an

ERACS has only one major flaw: it bites rocks.  It's hard to use, you
have no way to run it as an open-access system, you can't have spaces in
your username, the message base utility makes the Greene Machine look
downright userfriendly, the downloading utility is just as bad, and it's
SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWW.  When I was running it
from my hard drive it was about half as fast doing everything as your
floppy-based PBBS system is, and that's running on your 3.5" drive --
and I was running at 6 MHz.  It takes almost a minute just to log on to
the damn thing.  I'll admit, the TTY filter impresses the hell out of
me, and MONITORx/ECS's functions that don't require patching the damn
DOS are really cool (even though they don't do anything that the Fox
kernel couldn't do if it was set up correctly, not counting being able
to set privilege bits on every DOS command) ... but the advantages
really don't seem like they're worth the hassle.  I suspect if you
actually set up an ERACS system, you'd really, really regret it after
a while.  I realize all the privilege bits and the neato command parser
appeal to the mainframe hacker in you, but let's face it -- being able
to restrict access to the ATTRIB command when you let people play around
at your OS level may be something no other BBS lets you do, but it's
something no other BBS misses, either.  Considering that nobody in their
right mind would run a public-access ERACS system without using the
menu control files, that "advantage" is somewhat illusory.  A case could
be made for wanting to give certain users the ability to access half the
DOS commands, but it'd be real hard to claim it's necessary for a BBS.
(Besides, I suspect the same thing will be possible from the Fox script
processor, and with a better command parser to boot.)

   Throwing it across the room might or might not disturb the position 
of the board, but it would certainly disturb the person who it hit.  I

   We could just have everybody bring their own games.  If they were 
smart, they'd bring games that they knew would appeal to the masses;
otherwise, they might just have to sit in the corner and play with 
themselves.  Like I said before, games included in GameCon should 
appeal to more than just the people who brought them.

from ambassador to King, not a bad job promotion.  I saw the show last

A hint? Heck! I'll try to teach you the game over the modem.
   Basically, the game is very simple [Hah!] The person with the
black stones moves first. He places one of his stones in the 
intersection of the lines on the board. Then the white player goes,
and places one of his stones in an intersection. The two alternate
placing stones in corners of the board. Got me so far?
   The idea of the game, really, is to capture territory. If any
two pieces of the same color are touching horizontally or vertically
(note: NOT DIAGONALLY!!!!), they are said to be "linked." Still
with me?
   Stones are removed from the board in only one way: they must be
completely surrounded horizontally and vertically (NOT DIAGONALLY),
touching, by the opponent's pieces. Heck -- here are a few diagrams
of captured positions:
        o           ooo              oo
       oxo         ooXXo            oXXo
        o           oXo             oXXo
                     o               oo
  Got that? Here are a few examples of NOT captured pieces:
  xxx
  xo x     There's an "escape" left for the poor o -- but he'll
   xx      probably be taken next move.
    
   xxx
  xooox
  xo ox    Surprised? This is NOT taken. The space on the INSIDE counts
  xooox    as an escape route... though they'll probably be taken
   xxx     next move.
   
   xxx
  xooox
  xo ox    The o's in this position cannot be taken. CANNOT! When X
  xooox    tries to move into one of the empty spots, he's instantly
   xo ox   taken... x cannot hold both empty spots at the same time.
   xooox   This is called "two eyes," and it's extremely powerful.
    
   The only other rule you need know: you cannot move into the same
square twice in a row. This prevents certain bad things from happening.
   
   That's it for the rules. When GameCon comes around (if!), I'll
review them... and play you a game. It's a LOT tougher than it seems...

  Well, in the case of a letterboxed tape, the movie is only on tape in 
the letterboxed form. To preserve cable ratings (assuming people don't
want letterboxing on cable), the
movie is converted to screen size for pay cable. If a film is on disc
letterboxed, chances are that there is a tape unletterboxed, unless the 
tape was alredy released in letterbox. Only about 10 major films (maybe 
less) have been released letterboxed on tape. Some other "classic" or 
foreign films have also been letterboxed.
  It is interesting to compare something like "Ghostbusters" letterboxed
to the normal TV version...

Abortion has been defined as legal during the first two tri-mesters of

determine whether the infant is self-concious at that time. The catchy

the fetus is alive. My personal conclusion is: Of course the fetus is
alive, that is not the issue. Your teeth are alive, so is a cancerous
growth in a woman with cancer (I realize this is a distasteful simile,
but I believe it present the idea well>. No-one disputes the right of 
an individual to have one of his/her teeth pulled.. or have a cancerous
growth removed. The fetus is the same as these two except for one 
(or two.. see above reference to it's self-conciousness) factor,
it's potential. That fetus is certainly no more intelligent than the
cow you had for dinner last night (vegetarians are excused from this
argument), or Gasp! the Turtle steak you ate last week (or year).
  The telling question is whether you judge the action on the basis of 
the fetus' potential to become an intelligent, self-concious organism.
The precedence, I beleice supports NOT doing so, you can not sentence a
man to death because of his potential for committing murder.. you can't 
try a castrator for killing all the children the man had the POTENTIAL 
to have.  As I am coming up with these examples off the top of my head,
I am sure there are flaws in them.. and I'm sure there are "Pro-Lifers"
who will joyously point them out to me, but my purpose is to demonstrate
the shift in the actual issue. I have many other reasons for supporting
legalized abortion, some of which are difficult to explain.. I'd prefer 
to see how people respond to this note before explaining some of them. I
will return..

I was in the thingy that is a pick up with tank treads.  Well, some guy
was looking down the launch tube to see if it was clear, so I fired.
I explained to the computer that "He was attempting to sabotage equipmen
by jamming his flashlight into the tube."  Of course we wiped out about
25 clones in 2 hours.  Lotsa fun.

No problem, just point the critics out, and we'll be happy to meet them
outside with large baseball bats.  Will Archangel be trying out for 
any parts??

Sounds good to me, but stop the Turtle/Crystal house bashing.  They were
kind enough to let us in, and risk getting evicted.  Half the fun is 
stepping on people.

Okay, here we go... The first tone you hear is a CCITT signal. That
is the carrier for a 300 baud modem; if you're using 300 baud, you
just send an ORG carrier back and that's that. 1200 baud uses a carrier
on a different frequency. Most modems will respond to the CCITT carrier
by sending a 1200 baud carrier, which (unlike 300 baud) contains sync
signals...that's why it makes that hissing sound. What happens on the
host end at this point depends on how good the host modem is. Some
modems will immediately recognize the 1200 baud carrier and start gen-
erating one of their own, and the connection takes place. Other modems
will search for a 300 baud carrier, not find one, and switch to sending
a 1200 baud carrier with no sync signals. They will THEN suddenly
realize that they're hearing a 1200 baud carrier and wake up, and start
sending the sync signal, and the connection gets made. Is that terribly
helpful?
