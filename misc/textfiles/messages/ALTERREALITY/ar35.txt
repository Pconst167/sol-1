Come come now. The Beatles and the New Kids have plenty in common. 
They are both groups comprised of carbon-based life froms, they both
make their living by recording sounds for sale, they both are
idolized by half a billion young children; neither group lived in
grass huts, habitually dined upon llama's innards, or was really into
spontaneous combustion onstage.

The "What came first?" argument can be applied just as easily to
one god as to many; if you're a monotheistic agnostic, then who
created your "god" singular? Is it really that much easier to accept
a singular entity that has existed 'forever' (whatever that means) than
to accept a number of entities that have been around forever? Hmm...

Steve Vai is the guitarist who played for David Lee Roth on his first
solo albums and (I believe) played with Dio for a brief time. He's
characterized most strongly by the ability to use a guitar as a
voice synthesizer (no kidding); technically, he's very very good, if
(in my opinion) somewhat unimaginitive.He generally seems to be more
interested in special effects than in /music/, which is kind of
annoying, especially in light of how good he is.

Steve Vai is an EXTREMELY competent guitarist as well as an interesting
performer to watch. His latest album : Passion and Warfare  has a number
of highly entertaining works on it. Some of which ARE very fresh as far 
as concept and technical effects are concerned. I think Icefalcon is 
correct in his belief that Steve Vai is one of the pioneers of the music
industry (but not nearly to the degree of Floyd or Rush). You do, 
however, have to consider the fact that Icefalcon is a guitarist as well
and so his opinions tend to pull towards those with a high degree of 
technical ability (ie  Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Eddie Van Halen).

some pop band from the 60's. Grrrrrrr. Do not make generalizations like 
that unless you know what you're talking about. Since you have stated
previously that you are stuck in the 'Pop zone', I will assume that you 
don't. Steve Vai is a 'Rock' guitarist. That is, he doesn't just play
heavy metal, but also rock, neo-classical, and Southern blues. He almost
has achieved (I stress the almost) a position rivaling Joe Satriani and
Eddie Van Halen (The Ghods of Electric Guitar) with his most recent 
album.

That's FAR from the most inane rap lyrics I've ever heard. Who could
forget, for example, "Boom I've got your girlfriend, uh uh I've got
your girlfriend"? There's also the infamous "Oh so horny oh oh so
horny oh so horny yeah yeah yeah" from 2 Live Crew, and moving out of
rap, "I'm so hungry for your sex, yeah, I'm so hungry for your sex"
(Lita Ford), "She loves you yeah yeah yeah, she loves you yeah yeah
yeah" (you know who), "Slide it in, straight to the top, slide it in,
slide it in, slide it in" (Whitesnake, who can actually produce remark-
ably good music when they're not doing this sort of dribble), and last
but by no means least, "You ain't nothing but a hound dog, rock and
roll time, you ain't nothing but a hound dog, rock and roll time," which
has a special shrine in the hallowed halls of inane drivel.

Ok, you want to know this:
  Why would I drop all associations with a person whom I found out
was gay even if he was a friend?
  Look.  This is not a matter for logic.  I simply don't like them,
because of what they do.  If one of my friends turned out to be gay,
well, I don't make very close ties to people...it would be easy to 
drop them.  Anybody.  
 
And this:
  Why would homosexuality instantly negate anything else good about 
that person?
   It wouldn't.  It's just that anything "good" about that person
wouldn't matter as much as that particular thing "bad" about them. 
It would outweigh all "good" things.  (Which would all be tainted
with "bad" anyway.)
  
BTW - I am not dropping this thread because I have come to a logic
dead end...I am simply dropping it because no one wants to hear it!
Besides, everything I say falls on (mostly) deaf ears.

  Little girls will be infatuated with media stars. Allways have been,

that just made them more apppealing to little girls looking for

I don't pretend that I can slow down my daughters 'social interaction',
I just said I preferred older and simpler times. She will and has 
already started 'interaction' at a rate that is frightening - have you
looked at any 13 year old boys lately. I'm just trying to convince her
(without success) that all boys are scum. I know, I used to be a boy,
and I wouldn't want her to go out with anybody like me.

You've raised some valid points about where some members of CRS are
really coming from, but the greed of the few is not a reason to ruin
the lives of the many. Yes, we're over developed. Yes, we have real
problems with public services and utilities. Yes, we've got boneheads
on the county commision. But slamming the brakes on the local economy is
not going to help anything.
 Two of our commissioners came from the ranks of SOB, and found out
that solving the problems from within wasn't all that easy either. I
don't know if Eide can do any better, but he seems to have thought
these thing through a bit more thoroughly, and is concerned from a 
citizens viewpoint, not a special interest. There's no denying his
intellectual standing.
 One item that isn't addressed much is that we need to eliminate our
dependancy on the tourism/construction industry. Aside from some 
limited agriculture, we don't have any other industry. Perhaps we
could encourage a little bit of clean industry like Manatee and Lee 
counties do, so we could spread our economic base around.
 My biggest problem with the moritorium is that I don't see how putting
me out of a job is going to help. The big guys can just sit back, and
either retire or invest elsewhere. Right now I work 48+ every week, pay 
lots of taxes, spend all my money locally, and contribute time to
my daughters school. A moritorium would mean that I would be either
moveing, commuting mega-miles to work, or becoming a burden on society.
   I don't suppose anybody would like to support my family for
a while so that I can go to school faster than 3-6 hours at a time?

Thanks for the invitation to D and D's party at Holme.s Beach on Friday
I enjoyed myself. I am sorry that I got there late.
I was really impressed by what I saw and heard. There was no bitchen
(slang for you know what). There were about 40 people present. They
discussed legislation and social reform, the use of condoms, religious
affairs, Aids, college opening, food (really good food), business
ethics, etc.
Afterwards I went to the local bar down the road. I was approached twice
The bird who sat next to me had a slug out over a flake who walked out.
GHenerally I had a miserable time discussing gams and mamery glands on 
every gal that passed. This was an evening with a cop and P. O.
who I swore came from outter space and was in heat.
Again thasnks for the invitation to D and D's party. I really enjoyed
myself there. After this no more after party bar stops  even when

  Yes, you now havecollecting inane lyrics down to a science.
  
  But, there is one thing you should keep in mind about songs like "She
Loves You" and "Hound Dog". Back in the 1950's and early 60's, most hit 
songs were inane drivel. Actually, most stuff up through the mid-sixties
wasn't terribly intelligent. There, of course were some exceptions. 
Anyway, besides "She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah",I think Lennon and 
McCartney wrote better songs (for that time) such as "I'll Be On My Way"
(which was never recorded by the Beatles... but I digress)...

  You know, one thing about the Beatles' morality was, it didn't get out
until the initial mania had died. As far as the kids were concerned, 
they were wholesome boys... Ah, well. I always overlooked their faults. 
On the other hand, Ken Ober continuously calls ex-Beatles "druggies". I 
proceded to call his brother a druggie on the same grounds. Needless to

I'm prejudiced against idiocy. In my experience, there are more morons
who call themselves conservatives than morons who consider themselves
liberals; witness Pat Robertson, Jesse Helms, Jerry Falwell, etc.
(Actually, idiocy isn't really the right word; let's call it instead
"posessing of a great deal of hypocricy and self-serving self-righteous-
ness.) This does not imply that there aren't liberals with the same
problems (Jesse Jackson, for instance); nor does it imply that all

Okay, that was poorly phrased, so let me try again. The gods in
which Hindu atheists don't believe are likely to be a plurality, and
(if you will) the gods whose existance Hindu agnostics aren't sure
about are also probably a multitude. The point I was trying to make
is that someone raised in a particular religious setting is very likely
to map /all/ his views onto the framework of that religion, even if he
doesn't believe in the religion itself. An agnostic in a Christian
culture will be uncertain about the existance of god; an agnostic
raised in a Hindu culture will be uncertain about the existance of the
gods. Both will probably not be aware of their bias, or, if they are,
will simply feel that the bias is the interpretation which in some way
makes more sense or seems more likely.

this problem; (b) /not/ sexually frustrated but not terribly secure in

Yes, I did not mean to imply otherwise. Even groups (or individuals)
who are capable of producing remarkable music can pull the occasional
boner. Whitesnake is a good example of this sort of thing: almost all
ther songs are either exceptionally good or utterly insipid, with very
little in-between. Same with Heart; the people who recorded "These
Dreams" were also responsible for "Magic Man," which is truly a
monument to its own insipidness.

Your right to the degree that the kiddos don't actually meet or
interact with the band. However, it leads to more activities with 
other girls of like interest. I believe that when 4 girls close the
door, listen to music, talk and giggle for 12 hours, there is normal
social interaction going on. Their 'hobby' or interest in music is
just as valid to them as my interests in computers, golf and footballl
are to me. 
  I think you've somehow gotten the impression that my daughter is 
being stifled socially. Nothing could be further from the truth. I 
couldn't stop her development if I wa, but it is my responsibility
to help her stay on the right track - or as close to it as possible.

That's "You ain't nothin' but a hound dog/cryin' all the time," you
tuneless twit.  Elvis' songs were generallwritten before the time of
complete incoherency in rock music.  They were usually bad for other
reasons (repeating the above line three times and ending with "You ain't
nothin' but a hound dog and you ain't no friend of mine" hardly
qualifies as Don Henley, or even Bruce Springsteen on an off day), but
what little thought went into them was generally expressed in complete
sentences.

The New Kids' choreographer is Paula Abdul.  While I generally avoid
reading much about them, I haven't seen anything to back up Ken's
assertion that one of them is homosexual -- in fact, I haven't seen much
to indicate they're bisexual, heterosexual or any kind of sexual at
all, although one of them has a girlfriend.  Did it occur to you that
Ken is probably yanking your admittedly large chain on the subject of
homosexuality?  He's just more subtle about it than AJ is (if that
message about hard bodies wasn't written with the intention of setting

If you've never made a tie close enough that breaking it would hurt,
it sounds like you lead a fairly lonely life.  Just an observation.  I
simply think there are some assumptions you're working on that you
refuse to question.  It's more comfortable NOT to question those
assumptions, especially seeing as you've had them for all your life.
But assertions like "homosexuality is so bad it would outweigh all
good things, which would all be tainted with 'bad' anyway" are
disturbing to me on a different level than "The Specialist doesn't
agree with me and I think he's wrong."
   Honestly, I don't see how I /could/ think less of someone's art,
his writing, his music, his conversation and company -- and his
friendship -- if I found out that he was bisexual or homosexual.  What
does the one have to do with the rest?  Assuming he's not making a
pass at me (which has never happened), why should I be bothered?
   I have never understood how it's possible to hate another human
being who hasn't done something to you, or to people you care about,
unless you're talking about a mass murderer.  Most people I know who
hate a group based on a prejudice dehumanize them in some way, because
it makes it easier.  They're niggers, or kikes, ...or fags.  But not
human beings who have a different skin color, religion, or sexuality
from the haters'.  This is one of the most dangerous attitudes a
person can have.  I *have* seen your side; I was there about seven years
ago, until I thought through what I just said, and met a few "fags"
who were too human to be monsters.  So when you say 'why can't you see
my point,' I have.  I just came to the conclusion that it's extremely
unfair and potentially destructive, and -- to me -- felt as immoral as
I perceive groups like the White Aryan Resistance to be.
   So why aren't you willing to consider my point?  Have you had some
bad experience with one gay you're abstracting to others?  Or do you
prefer hating them because it's the easiest thing to do?

Elves are fantasy creatures, so I have no idea what they'd be like
genetically.  Reli would have as much in common with your pet Persian
Fluffy as you do with Koko the gorilla; logically, if she's a beast,
then so are humans, because they're both equally removed from their
ancestors.  (Of course, it's been argued by others that humans are
beasts anyway, so who knows.)
 
If you mean I didn't answer your original question as to whether or not
I could have sex with Reli -- yes, I did: on the Armadillo Connection's
"Mythagoras" base.  I answered it in some detail, in fact.  The short
form is that yes, I most certainly could.  Whether or not I would is
a different question entirely, however, and one that I could not
honestly answer.

Given a choice between Jimmy Carter and Jerry Falwell, I'd choose Carter
any day.  Of course, I /like/ Carter.  I'm glad he's not president
anymore, mind you, but I like him.  I have to wonder if, thirty years
from now, when history books look back at the late 20th century,
Carter will be considered a better president than Reagan.  Carter lost
the election mostly due to the stupidly-conceived hostage rescue
mission (although to be fair, the idea of sending in a commando squad
sounds closer to a Clint Eastwood movie than the lily-livered "send
flowers, not guns" approach most liberals are accused of); now that
the heat of the moment has died down, his popularity is rising again.
True, his adminstration can be summed up by "In the White House during
the years 1976-1980, nothing happened," but 30 years from now, the
Reagan administration will be remembered mostly for increasing the
deficit by an order of magnitude, and--something that hasn't really
sunk in yet ANYWHERE, liberals or otherwise--having the most corrupt
staff in the nation's history.  "But gosh, he shore looked good on
telly-vision."

AJ can answer for me:  Could it be that this is used as "internal"
type talk and that it is OK for an "insider" to use the terms but they
are hated when used by "others".  I know for example that while the
term "nigger" is universally despised when used by a non-negro, negros
use the term as a personal derogatory bereft (sp?) of connotations.

Rumania. The country in question has a really backward medical
establishment; in addition to having no sanitary facilities to speak of,
they have a tradition that weak or sickly children are injected with
small quantities f blood from a healthy adult on the theory that this
will strengthen them (much as eating a lion's heart gives a tribal
warrior the strength of the lion, etc.) Result: A large number of
children with hepatitis, AIDS, and other blood-borne illnesses you
normally wouldn't think a child would be exposed to.

Carolina Biological Supply is a truly amazing thing, and I mean that in

accomplished by taking a bunch of high-school students and turning
them loose on a bunch of frogs--if the state of American education as
compared to any other country's is any indication, it sure isn't
producing more educated people. Hell--a lot of high-school students know
so little about biology that they don't even associate sex with
reproduction; turning these people loose on helpless amphibians doesn't
seem likely to instill a thorough understanding of basic physiology...

Speaking of New Kids on the Block, which some of us have been, and
bad music in general, I had a nightmare I'd like to share with y'all
that's kind of germane to the subject. See, I dreamed I was dragged by
a friend to a concert by a man I'd never heard of before; the gentleman
walked onstage and opened his show with the crowd-pleasing statement
"I may be a Christian and a country singer, but I know how to rap!"

Hello,  I should have the orcad drivers today or tomorrow,  give me a 
call on voice line, ok?  I don't have your phone number so if you could 
leave it on my answering machine that would be cool.  my # is 351-7726.
By the way, I called Plus tech support and they said they'd send me a 
free replacement for my hardcard!  Pretty amazing considering I'm not 
even the original owner.  It's probably a refurbished model or something
by it's guaranteed for another two years, so i'm not complaining.  They 
definitely know how to keep their customers. (I was pretty perturbed 
to begin with when I found out that their tech support line was a "900"
number.  No sexy babes answered either...
Yeah, i think I did tell Charles that you sent me.
AutoCad 10 worked great on my machine for a good two minutes with the co
processor (then my hardcard stuck).
I won't need an epson either since I now can use the IBM Graphics driver

The stereotype of the butch or queen is worth attacking for the same
reason that any other stereotype is.  Yes, there are some who conform
to it, or it wouldn't have become a stereotype; but when people take
the stereotype as fact, they can dismiss /everyone/ of that sexual
orientation -- or color, religion, sex, etc. -- based on it.  Look at
some of the conversation back on this board: because the stereotype of
the lisping Liberace lover has been presented as fact, too many people
are quite willing to assume that ALL homosexuals and bisexuals are
that way.  Take 95YNF's "Dykes on Bikes" (please).  It's funny on some
occasions... but it's funny because of that stereotype.  It doesn't
exactly encourage thinking of lesbians as people... and that's the
danger I see in any stereotype: it dehumanizes the target. Hell, even
people who DO conform to a few aspects of a given stereotype are often
worth knowing if you get past that stereotype.  If the stereotype
wasn't encouraged or taken seriously in the first place, it won't be
there to "get past"... and it probably won't be missed.

There is an OrCAD-type product in beta test for the Amiga right now.
The expected release price is around $400 or so.  AmigaDOS 2.0 is
better than Windows 3.0 anyway... not that saying that is saying a
whole lot, I suppose.  Turtle tells me that it's actually an extremely
usuable GUI, though, and unlike any of the MS-DOS ones I've seen (and
the earlier Amiga versions), it will work with /any/ program for the
DOS, including ones that don't have icon files associated with them.
You can launch programs with the mouse as background tasks, lots of
other little gadgets floating around, and it runs about 4x faster than
the old versions of AmigaDOS, too.
   But anyway, there's a printed circuit designer that's supposed to
be professional-level coming out for the Amiga shortly.  Time will
tell....

Sure, how could you not like Jimmy Carter. He's a regular guy. He lives
his ideals - habitat et al. He honestly wants to do good in the world,
and works for fairness and justice. This all makes him a good Christian
and a good 'elder statesman.' However, that dosn't, or didn't make him
a good leader or president. He was too much of a nice guy, a patsy. 
While I don't want to get into a chain where I have to defend RWR, the
initial reason for the massive deficiet spending of the '80s was to pull
us out of the inflation and unemployment of the '70s. Carter's economic
policy was um....uh.....let's wait and see. 
  I've usually agreed with the conservative ideas that came with teh
Reagan administration, but was never particularly fond of him or his
management style. I think he was overwhelmed by the office, and wound
up delegating a lot of authority to people who did not serve him or the
country well. The main reason he was so popular was that people tend to
not look past their driveways where politics are concerned - if your
wallet is in good shape, the frig is full and there are two cars in the
driveway, then the government (president) must be doing a good job.
  I think George may be the best pres we've had lately. He's had the
widest range of experience across the entire spectrum of govt service
of any recent pres, as well as a higher  IQ.

T>Parenting is one of those things that you don't understand ...
 
Not to mention that studies show that a very significant factor in
father-daughter relationships is the hidden sexual aspect.  I personally
was shocked to find that a lot of fathers (like statistically most)
surreptitiously study their daughter's budding sexuality and have
tension due to conflicting emotions.  The problem (theorize here) is tha
that a loving relationship exists and the libidos of both people get
stimulated and confused and sometimes mistakenly identified as sexual
attraction.  
Matter of fact I performed a very impromptu survey of females that I 
knew after I read the article - wow!  Most of the girls related stories
of their dad "accidentally" walking in on them at baths, peeking down
their blouses, pinching their breasts with lewd (albeit, paternalistic)
comments and more than I can relate here.

t>Really? Lucky you--
 
Now be nice...  the funniest gal I ever met was at a Denny's at 2:30
in the morning last January.  She was raising hell with a couple of
cowboys that were moving in on "her girls" (she had 3 lovers!!!!).
Me and my buddy and a girl that was with me moved over to their table
for moral support (at first we only saw 2 rednecks and 4 babes).  She
told us if we though /we/ were gonna move in on her gals we better
leave.  Tara explained that we were there to discourage the rednecks so
she mellowed out.  Jan fascinated me...she had cultivated "butchism"
to an extreme including a very deep gravelly voice.  I asked her why
and she floored me with her answer... "It get the babe's attention".
She was a really funny and entertaining person but after I got to
know her a little better (she was a very shy reclusive person) she
was shown to be a very tragic personality.  She moved out of state when
two of her lovers left for Salt Lake City but the couple of months that 
I knew her (we set up Saturday nites at Denny's for party time) she
was never ever caught out of context.

Amiga would cost several hundred more and does /NOT/ have any engineerin

else.  Personally I would love one of the DECStations with Ultrix and
their 600 MB CDROM with MSDOS executable as a window - the best of all
worlds but it weighs in at $12,000.  I am not, never have been and never
will be a computer bigot.  They all have things to recommend them and
serve a useful purpose if only to play games on.  I just wish I could

Yes, I never debated sapience, though.  A cat is a cat.  A sapient cat

still a beast. 
  
  Incedentally, the thing that separates us from chimps is the number
of chromosomes we have...would Reli have the same # of chromosomes?
I'm not talking about mentally, here, I'm talking about genetically.
Now, if Reli had the same # of chromosomes, I'd have no problem with 
not calling her a beast (yew...when I say it like that, I feel like I'm 
being insulting...and she doesn't even exist!).  Or, if Reli had the 
same # of chromosomes as an ordinary housecat, then she could be 
classified as a cat.  When you combine an Asian and a European, you get
a human.  You can't combine a simian and a human.  If you could combine 
Reli and a house cat then she is a beast. If you couldn't then she is
not.  Also, what would the result of a Reli/Human mating be?  A cat? A 
human?  Like Reli but more pronounced human features?

play the bass as if they were playing lead guitar (I'm referring to
playing style, not the actual sound) and vice versa are abusing the 
instrument. An entirely different way of thinking is required, 
because the base is a much subtler instrument. That is why I didn't 
mention Geddy Lee. If I had been praising Bassists, he would have gotten
SPECIAL attention.

You know, upon reflection, it occurs to me that Bush may, indeed, be the
best president we've had since Nixon (whether or not you count Nixon in
that list depends on whether or not you think being an amazing crook
counts against him sufficiently enough to make him a bad president, I
suppose).  I'm not sure this is necessarily a good thing, mind you.
I suppose it's better to have someone who thinks things I don't agree
with than someone who doesn't think at all, though.

You don't really get the liberal thing, sir.  You've been listening to
Reaganites too long.  Believe it or not, "liberal" and "defenseless" are
not synonyms.  I said that as much in the last message and for whatever
reasons you have, you let it go WHOOSH! and ignored most of what I said.
You really do cherish your assumptions, don't you?  No fact is going to
get in past your blinders, no siree.

Hopefully my last message made the relationship of Reli to a cat a bit
clearer... the analogy of humans to chimps would probably go through at
all levels, although since the matter of chromosomes didn't come up in
the story it's not something I have an answer to.  Reli couldn't produce
offspring with a cat in her world (or ours) any more than you could
with Cheetah the chimp (who was female, not that knowing this is too
important).  Furthermore, she'd probably regard the idea of TRYING to
have offspring with a cat the same way you'd regard the idea of having
sex with Cheetah.
   "Beast" itself is a kind of curious word.  I did write a story a
while ago that took the sort of thing going on in "Travelling Music" and
treat it more seriously, exploring the question of whether or not it
qualifies as 'bestiality' (in the story, the prospect was between a
human and a feline alien).  At any rate, by your definition of beast,
Reli wouldn't be considered one either.  Spencer is a bit unsure of
that, probably for the same reasons you had for asking (intellectually
it can be worked out that she isn't, but she still looks like a cross
between a cat and a human).
    As for offspring, I would assume that humans and Reli's species
would be unable to produce children together.  It might be possible
that they are close enough to produce sterile 'halfbreeds,' but I'm not
sure what you'd get.

Yes, I'm sure AJ was serious, but I still think he was yanking your
chain.  The two aren't mutually exclusive.  Bragging about sexual
exploits is not, to the best of my experience, "typically gay," as most
gay people would rather AVOID reactions like yours.  Unless they're
yanking your chain, of course.
 
As to whether or not it backfired, I don't know.  Maybe he wanted to
see if you'd take the bait and respond with an outraged, ranting,
foaming at the mouth spew.  If that WAS the case, it succeeded, although
I fail to see the point (even the humor value would be somewhat
limited).

All right, fine.  I only 'continued' the thread because, well, let me
lay it out in your type of blunt terms: you're wrong.  I have direct
evidence (i.e., contact with THEM <gasp>) which proves to me that your
attitude is 100% wrong when it comes to "they can't be good people."
You, on the other hand, not only have no evidence for your position,
you REFUSE to ever come close to a position for ever getting said
evidence becuase the "evidence" you find might not support your blind
hatred.  Basically, your point is shit, and I think you know it is.
You have effectively confirmed a suspicion I have had about you and
(I suspect) most people who share your attitude: the "fear" in
"homophobia" is fear of having your assumptions shaken.  You will
always be right in your own mind because you absolutely refuse to
accept any evidence that might REMOTELY prove you wrong.  I HAVE seen
it from your viewpoint; the difference is I wasn't afraid to have my
"aversion" challenged.  The assertion that a person who is gay or
bisexual can produce nothing worthwhile and have nothing to say is
flat-out factually WRONG.  I know it.  And you know it, too.  Logically
there is NO way to defend that position.
 
Incidentally, back when you said, "Don't introduce me to any of them,"
... never mind.  Have a pleasant afternoon.
