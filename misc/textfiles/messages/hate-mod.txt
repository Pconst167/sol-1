nice handle, why dont you try something you know about?
Ohhhh, let's swap some DNIC lists (more ha's)...
MOD- Mexixcans of Doom... 'nuff said
Help me with od's... fuck you, you want the world on a plate?
 
bitnet... you'll only confuse yourself further.
NUI's... why do you really need it, you just call here and sit in chat's
for 5 or 6 hrs a day.  Is that elite?
 
It's not really the fact that all the lamers can get here now
it's the fact that everyone is actually putting up with thier

sit there and give the chat systems a bad rep..its people like you `TOM'
and a few others that sit there and rag on every1 and make them feel like
shit(which it dont effect me cause i dont claim to be elite anyway)..
so why dont you shut up and give every1 a break..stop raggin on MOD..their
account is no longer on here so what good is it gonna do anyway?
and whoever was asking for that Outdial..there is no area code like that in

Hi Mob, you seem to have a rather large attitude problem, as is evident
from your outbreaks of verbal diarrhea on this system. Do you regular
ly go for psychiatric check-ups, or perhaps even they can't help you.
Why don't you just act cool with people instead of putting them down
at every opportunity ?

Fools like you give real hackers a bad name.

Hi Doodes!

It sounds quite strange to me to change 'DNICs'! Why not even
change area codes? I got a nice one: (415)..Seems to b in SFO!
You find DNIC Lists in almost every x25 related publication...
I got a c00l NUA in USA, with DNICS and the actual costs/Network
snailmail address and so on...

Most countries also got their own TymNet Node, which you might call
to reach this country...

Anyway:

Anyone who wants this NUA just drop me a mail and say what u got to swap...
I look for globals/Whole USA with not so big delays for d/l (ZModem).
Does anybody know a direct dialup ( (617) or x25) for ai.mit.edu?

Hmmm Ok, Dr. Devious.. ur oh so right.. i'm sorry the scene isn't tailored 
to your needs.. Although I did find the bit about giving hackers a bad name
quite Humorous.. I mean hell, we're playin with your ego now eh?. MoB is
nothing more than a group of people that don't fuckin give a shit about reps,
hacking status, and or how eeeeelite you are.. If some1 was heckling you then
it's probably because you were going off on how elite or kewl u were or we
were just hella baked at the time. sooo basically..

Not one of those 3 said anything useful. You're wasting space babbling about

Well, DrVms, your posting of how to get the entire DNIC list... Those are words
The act of getting them and finding it, that is an action... A very useless
action... DNIC lists, trading DNICs etcetera is done with little or no
difficulty. Even scanning the DNICs exploring whats in each network requires
little skill although is much more useful than the obtaining of DNICs...
You are far from being a hero... As a matter of fact there aren't really any
heroes in this world... Welcome to the information age where knowledge passes
mainly through individuals and small groups of people and not through large
groups of people. In other words, those complaining that people ragging on
you are wasting your time are kidding yourself. Getting things accomplished
does not exist on this system. It will always be a meeting ground for all
who call themselves hackers. Nothing more than that. Post accounts, etc, if
you like but I think you are the ones wasting your time.

And ruining it for the rest of us...

Hmmm , heheh all this makes no sense.. First of all anyone who brings up 
the fact that , 'ur ruining it for all of us', 'your making us look lame' 
'your giving a bad name to hackers' ect,ect,ect.. You are probably in it 
for the wrong reasons.. Probably cuz you have such a lame social life and/or
such little influance in the real world you look for a subsitute here or 
in the hacking world.. Like it's some grand social event.. I mean who the 
hell gives a shit if MoB starts raggin on you in non-threating ways, or if 
someone goes off on you for trading DNICs (cuz its damn funny).. that's the
small picture.. Hacking has nothing to do with bragging about how much you 
know, it's just if you get out there and do it.. It's not a grand group 
effort.. It's indvidual or done in small groups.. 

God, the whining about MoB was funny... Like it would kill you to
change the channel or do you actually feel threatened that they might 
change the image of hackers? I hear alot of people say.. The scene is getting
Soooooo lame now..  ? If you keep your shit away form k0de vmb posting kids
and just talk with people you trust it will always remain the same. So 
what if QSD turned into a haven for GAY hot chatters.. then stay away or 
find somewhere else to go.. just learn and if someone says prove urself..
thats just fuckin wasting ur time.

Hi, I also don't give a shit about elitenss, or who is better at hackin
than whom, or any of that kind of crap. It just annoys me that there are some
people who have nothing better to do that slag each other off all the time.
Sorry If u took offence when I said u give hackers a bad name, but the way
some people on this sytem are carrying on, It might well do !
Also, I never complained that this system never catered for my needs, or
anyone elses for that matter. We've all got to make the best out of

fhughazilosophy will prevail. Basically DrVMS I in general do not need nor do
I care to prove myself. If I were to prove myself I dont think I would make
attempts at providing the world with DNIC's but hey you can go about doing
your noble chivalric acts any way you like. Chivalry is not my thing. Code of
ethics which are anti-individualistic turn me off. I usually just read this 
shit and say nothing but when the complaining came I thought that nothing is
more annoying than complaints. Inasty says stop this shit if you dont have 
anything useful to say don't say anything. Well his post was pretty useless.
It says less than our posts that go back and forth say. But to me the hacker
attitude is important enough to be discussed in a general subboard. If you 
want to talk about various systems,networks, and other intellectual things
go call a BBS but don't expect anything but bullshit, babbling, and 
philosophical discussions here. Attempts at proving yourself only shows your
insecurity.

would mob happen to have any relation to mod?  quite odd, one dies,
and another one pops up.  both have much in common.  i would suspect them
to have the same members as well.   in any case, i fail to see the use of
such groups.   possibly, the only redeeming value they do hae is a release
of tension on others, by the members.  still, that is not good..

Oolon's claim is that his 'threat' is a joke. That is just made up
bullshit. He wanted to boost his image and he UNSUCCESSFULLY TRIED to make
the members of MoB shit bricks. Nobody will ever have my info. Most of MoB's
info is secret. But not too hard to obtain. Although, don't try anything.

Oolon is gonna shut up.. He's scared. Getting his address is very easy, due to
the fact we have his number...

ok, I'm not on anyones side or anything... I don't have a preference either
way - it's just a 'fight' between some people...  However, I do have one
observation/question...  You'll notice how the mob members (Radioactive
Foreskin, Nuclear Jello, etc...) all use the same account ('mob') - which is
fine... Now here's my question/observation:

Radioactive ForeSkin was on (with the mob account) and posted a message that
got cut off... Then, a few messages later, he (R. F.) noticed that it was
cut off and corrected himself - explaining that it got cut off...  Which
is fine, EXCEPT:  The second post by Radioactive Foreskin was post from the
account 'vmem'...   Did Virtual Memory make a mistake and accidentally
reveal his identity?  Is V. Memory really Radioactive Foreskin?  Just
wondering is all...   I'm not on any side - just trying to watch what's
going on...   Virtual Memory is/was not in MOD, right?   Therefore, if Vmem
IS Radioactive FOreskin (for mob) - then that would mean that MOB and MOD are
definately NOT the same group (which many thought, at least for a while...)

Anyways - whatever... just wanted to bring that 'error?' to everyone's
attention...
