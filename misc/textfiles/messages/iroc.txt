common accounts on cosmos are:

ROOT
SYS
BIN
PREOP
COSMOS

All others start with one of the
following prefixes:

PA- loop assignment center
DA- network admin center
RS- repair service
MF- frame and toll
FC- frame control center
GA- general inquiries
DC- data conversion
NT- NTec
DP- dispatch
CI- C.I.C.

there should not be any others.
typical cosmos accounts would be
MA01   PA10  RS11  etc.

if you have an apple w/applecat or
a commodore 64 look for the cosmos
password hacker.

look in hacking cosmos part III & IV

In addition to the ones mentioned by

this is frame foreman, i am not
sure, but its definitly a frame
account. Unfortunately it can do
inquiries only.
tirks starts for trunk inventory
record keeping system, and i have one
unintelligible printout from it, but
otherwise - ??
back to cosmos: I know of this command
called "msk". You do an MSK, then
enter a "." then return, and it will
print out the files contained in that
wirecenter, but all the names will be
crammed together. separate them, then
type MSK again, but instead of the
period, type the name of the file. it
will show it to you. i have found many
interesting things on cosmos using
this, like lists of who and what uses
the system, other dialups, lists of
wirecenters + what they cover, service
miscellaneous shit. the neat thing is
that you can use this from an unpriv
acct, like the ff accounts i mentioned
above. now, if i could figure a way
to move out of the wirecenter
directory, (/usr/so/wc , wc=wire

xxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx format but where the 
old ones contain the first 3 digits of
the card represent the card-holders
area code of his fone=numbers, the next
4 digits represent the card-holder's
suffix of his #, and the last 4 digits
are just any various code digits.-that
is for the old card. Now, AT&T came
out with the new cards thanx to us

If any of you have tried to start a
700 conference lately, you do not get
routed automatically to the correct
bridge, but instead, you get an
Alliance operator with a message; Can
I help you? I do not know why this
occurs, it is my guess that it is
because Alliance got sick and tired of
all the conferences that were being
set up, and they decided to do
something about it. For all of you who
have PBX's, but still wish to place an
international call, and do not have an
international extender, the solution
is simple; just dial the TSPS
operator, and tell her that you want
to place an international call. It
weill save time and be helpful if you
have a list of international country
codes or city codes. These can be
obtained by

1) opening the phone book and looking
(most have some country listings)

2) calling Rate & Route and telling
them that you are a cordboard, and
you need an IOTC numbers route for
country, city.

If you are capable of doing the above,
you are most likely able to blue box.
Just blow 2600 immediately after you
get the info from R & R, and dial
KP+011+0Country Code+ST. You will be
routed to international sender. Then:
KP+Country Code+City Code+Number+ST.
