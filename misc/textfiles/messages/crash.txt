        Re: the comment about "crashing" the central office...

        If anyone finds this hard to believe, I know of a specific example
where there was a bug in a particular generic software release used on some
early #2 ESS machines which had just been installed by New York Telephone
to replace SxS CDO's during the mid 70's.
        By using three telephone lines, and setting them up to forward as
A --> B --> C --> A, a call from another telephone to A as a "seed" would
force the #2 ESS to crash and switch to the standby processor, whereupon
a second occurence would wipe out the standby processor until the call
attempt was discontinued.  This situation would also set off remote alarms
at the SCC which handled these unattended #2 ESS machines.
        Needless to say, a software patch was quickly developed by WECO...

        The above scenario was probably unanticipated by the WECO team
that designed and wrote the software.  The public, however, seems to have
a knack for discovering these flaws rather quickly.
