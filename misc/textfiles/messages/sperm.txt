            YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO READ THIS, DO YOU?

EVERY SPERM IS SACRED

Dad: There are Jews in the world,
     There are Buddhists,
     There are Hindus and Mormons
     and then,
     There are those who follow
     Mohammed,
     But I've never been one of them...

     I'm a Roman Catholic,
     And have been since before
     I was born,
     And the one thing they say
     about Catholics,
     Is they'll take you as soon as
     you're warm...

     You don't have to be a six-footer,
     You don't have to have a
     great brain,
     You don't have to have any
     clothes on-
     You're a Catholic the moment
     Dad came...

     Because...

     Every sperm is sacred,
     Every sperm is great,
     If a sperm is wasted,
     God gets quite irate.

CHILDREN:
     Every sperm is sacred,
     Every sperm is great,
     If a sperm gets wasted,
     God gets quite irate.

CHILD:
     Let the heathen spill theirs,
     On the dusty ground,
     God shall make them pay for,
     Each sperm that can't be found.

CHILDREN:
     Every sperm is wanted,
     Every sperm is good,
     Every sperm is needed,
     In your neighbourhood.

MUM:[mom]
     Hindu, Taoist, Mormon,
     Spill theirs just anywhere,
     But God loves those who treat their
     Semen with more care.

MEN NEIGHBOURS:
     Every sperm is sacred,
     Every sperm is great,

     Every sperm is fine,
FUNERAL CORTEGE:
     God needs everybody's,
FIRST MOURNER:
     Mine!
LADY MOURNER:
     And mine!
CORPSE:
     And mine!

NUN:
     Let the Pagan spill theirs,
     O'er mountain, hill and plain,
STATUTES:
     God shall strike them down for
     Each sperm that's spilt in vain.

EVERYBODY:
     Every sperm is sacred,
     Every spern is good,
     Every sperm is needed,
     In your neighbourhood.

     Every sperm is sacred,
     Every sperm is great,
     If a sperm gets wasted,
     God gets quite irate.
