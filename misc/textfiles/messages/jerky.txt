    How to keep your cat from eating your food - By Brian Murrey

    Make some beef jerky, just a couple of strips, and bag it.  Let the
    cat get it.  It won't do it anymore.

    Secret Cat/Dog Jerkey Recipe

    3-4 slices of lean beef strips
    Cayenne Pepper
    Louisiana Red Sauce (from New Iberia of course)
    Crushed Habanero Peppers (one will do)
    Crushed Black Pepper

    Take the pepper mixture and add about 2 tsp vinegar and 1/4 cup hot
    water.  Let this stand for about 12 hours so it can combine talents.

    Drop in the beef strips and let it set for about an hour.  Then while
    wearing rubber gloves (no kidding...the habanero oil can irritate your
    skin and I don't have to explain what happens if you scratch yourself
    or rub your eye with habanero on your hands...ouchie wah wah) take the
    meat out of the mix and place it on your dehydrator tray.  Spoon a
    little of the mix onto each piece of meat.  Let it dry.  Then bag it
    and leave it out for the pesty pets.  They'll only do it once, if they
    have any sense at all.

    BTW, I make this jerky for myself, sans habanero.  Instead I add some
    pineapple juice, worchester sauce, and a dab of horseradish to the
    soaking sauce. It's GOOD.

    My theory on cats liking jerky is that most jerky has been soaked in
    worchestershire sauce, this contains anchovies. Need I say more?

    Oh yeah, after your loved pet attacks the jerky and retreats, have a
    bowl of COLD MILK  (NOT WATER!!!) ready for him.

====================================================================
                          MAKING JERKY
====================================================================
  Jerky can be made from venison,  elk or Buffalo,  but is gener
ally made from beef.  A good lean round steak or flank steak will 
work great.  Cut the meat in long thin strips against the  grain. 
If  there's  any fat or gristle,  remove it and  throw  it  away.  
Cowboys used to sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper,  a  small 
amount of chili powder, and then simply hang it on wire lines  in 
the sun to dry. 
 For  more flavorful jerky,  marinate the meat in a  solution  of 
two  tablespoons  of soy sauce,  two drops of  Tabasco  sauce  or 
cayenne pepper to taste, 1/4 teaspoon of salt,  ground pepper and 
one fresh clove of garlic,  minced.  Place meat and marinade in a 
Ziploc plastic bag in the refrigerator overnight. Then drain  the 
meat and place on the oven racks to dry.  The oven should be  set 
at 140 degrees with the oven door partially open.  Dry for  about 
six  to  eight hours or until the meat turns  dark  and  brittle.  
Other  marinade ingredients that add a unique taste to  the  meat 
are red wine,  red wine vinegar,  Worchestershire sauce,   minced 
onion,  a pinch of thyme,  oregano and marjoram. 
====================================================================
                ANOTHER RECIPE FOR BEEF JERKY
====================================================================
1 flank steak or roast                  4 T lemon juice
1 clove garlic, minced                  1/2 c soy sauce
1/2 c honey                             1 pinch salt
1 pinch pepper

Put steak in freezer for about half an hour, just until firm.  
Slice steak across grain, about 1/4-inch thick.  
Combine remaining ingredients and marinate steak strips in this for 
    at least 2 hours.  
Place slices on rack in pan and dry in oven at 150 degrees, 12 hours.
=====================================================================
                              JERKY
=====================================================================
1 c Worcestershire sauce                 1/2 T Salt
1 c Soy sauce                            1/2 T Pepper
1 T White sugar                          1/2 T Onion Powder
1 clove minced garlic                    1 flank steak or roast

Put steak in freezer for about half an hour, just until firm.  
Slice steak across grain, about 1/4-inch thick.  
Combine remaining ingredients and marinate steak strips in this for 
    6 to 12 hours depending on spiceyness desired.  
Place slices on rack in pan and dry in oven at 150 degrees, 12 hours.
Alternate:  Dry in dehydrator 12 hours.
Variation:
Use Venison...double all the 1/2 T quantities above and soak for up
to 16 hours.
=====================================================================
                            Venison Jerky
===================================================================== 
1/4 cup cider vinegar
4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
1 to 2 pounds raw lean venison strips
 
     Partially freeze meat so it can be cut easily into 1/4
inch strips. Dump remaining ingredients in bowl or big cake
pan and mix well. Marinate meat in mixture covered in
refrigerator for at least a day, turning now and then to coat
meat evenly. Shake excess moisture from marinated strips.
     If oven is clean and you want to keep it that way, line
bottom with aluminum foil to catch drippings. Lay strips of
meat over cake racks or directly on oven racks. Or, to
accommodate more meat, use those spiked metal hooks used to
hang curtains, spear a strand of meat on each hook and hang
down from regular oven racks. (The more air that circulates
around meat strips, the better.) Cook for 5 to 6 hours in 175
degree oven.
     Remove from oven, blot with paper towels and when cool,
store in refrigerator in old mayonnaise jars, with the tops
on, or in sealed plastic bags. It will last for a day or more
without refrigeration.
     Most any barbecue marinades can be used for jerky as
long as they contain no oil. For stronger flavors, add more
seasonings and increase marinating time.
     Vinegar when added to marinade, will soften the wild
taste of game meats.
     Lean meats are best for jerky.

 Yep! That's the one.  I changed the recipe a little, I guess.
 1/2 cup soy sauce
 1/2 cup honey
 1 clove garlic
 pinch of salt
 1/2 tsp black pepper

 I increased the pepper and left out the lemon.  This creates a
 stronger flavor and a little spicier too.  I use either London
 broil or  I get the local supermarket to slice up a center-cut
 rump roast.

 I just cooked up a batch with the recipe with lemon in it.  Its a
 little milder than my other batches, but it too is disappearing. :-)

Hi yall,

    One of the fellas at work had complained that he didn't know what
to do with all the deer meat he had acquired from his hunting.  When I
presented him with a LONG printout of venison recipes, he came back with
this one for our collection.  He stated that it might be better if you
add beer to the marinade.

  are golden, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and continue baking until
  pastry is golden all over, an additional 5 to 10 minutes, and remove from
  oven.

  **  Pears  **
  To prepare poaching liquid, whisk together water, sugar and spices in a
  saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Add pear halves and
  simmer until pears are nearly soft throughout -- about 25 minutes to an
  hour, depending on ripeness and variety of pears.  Test pears at 15-minute
  intervals; when poached, remove from liquid and cool on a plate.

  **  Tart  **
  To assemble tart, slice pears crosswise into 1/2-inch slices.  Place the
  blade of a knife lengthwise under the pear, and press gently on the pear
  until you have a pear half that is elongated.  Transfer pears to tart
  shell, placing them in a circle with stem ends facing center.

  **  Custard  **
  To make the custard, combine eggs, cream, flour, vanilla, and sugar in a
  food processor.  Pour custard over and around pears to within 1/4-inch of
  the top of the crust.  Bake in the center of a 350øF oven until custard is
  golden brown on top and set, about 25 minutes.  Remove tart from oven and
  cool for 5 minutes on a wire rack.  Remove the ring and cool tart
  completely.  Transfer tart, still on its metal base, to a serving platter.

      Title: Beef Jerky a la Willie
 Categories: Snacks
      Yield: 1 servings

    1/2 c  Lo salt soy sauce
  1 1/4 ts Onion powder
    1/3 c  Worcestershire Sauce
  1 1/4 ts Garlic powder
  2 1/3 ts Pepper
      2 tb Brown sugar
      1 lb Lean beef
           Liquid mesquite smoke *

  * use in place of smoker.

  Mix all ingredients except beef to make marinade.  Cut thinly sliced
  beef into 1/2 inch strips and marinate for 8 to 12 hours. Smoke using
  mesquite chips for about three hours and then finish drying in oven.
  If doing whole operation in oven use liquid smoke and hang strips of
  beef on highest rack and put shallow pan underneath to catch
  drippings. Turn oven on and set to lowest possible setting and leave
  for 6 to 8 hours until thoroughly dried. A couple of hints that I
  picked up from one of the cooking echos. Use toothpicks or wooden
  skewers to hang meat by, and put a couple of layers of paper towels
  in the pan to collect the drippings and save cleaning problems later
  on.

      Title: Tofu Jerky
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 servings

    1/2 c  Soy sauce
      3 tb To 4 tb liquid smoke
    1/8 c  Water
      1 tb Onion powder
      1 ts Garlic powder; or
      1    Clove garlic; crushed
      1 tb Fresh ground black pepper
      1 ts Honey
      1 lb Firm or extra firm tofu

  Cut and drain the tofu.  I usually take a 1 lb cube, cut it in
  half,and then slice it into strips on its short side.  Strips should
  be about 4-5 mm in thickness.  They may look big, but they'll shrink
  to about half their size.

  Mix all the marinade ingredients together well. Put the tofu in a
  single layer in a shallow baking pan or cookie sheet and pour the
  marinade over it.  Let soak for several hours or overnight.

  Drain excess liquid (and reuse!) and dry tofu in food dehydrator or
  warm (200 F) oven.  This will take probably 4-8 hours, depending on
  weather. If you live in a sunny, dry climate (Colorado in the
  summer), you can sun dry it, it'll take all day.

  If you dry indoors in the winter, your house gets filled with a
  wonderful smoky smell. If you're drying in the oven, you'll need to
  flip the tofu over hourly so it dries evenly. The stuff is delicious
  and keeps indefinitely.  Dry the stuff until it's very chewy, but not
  crispy.

  Be creative: Use low-sodium soy if you want less salt (it is rather
  salty) Use tabasco or ground cayenne if you want it hot. Chili powder
  makes chili jerky. Oregano and basil makes pizza jerky. From:

      Title: Beef Jerky
 Categories: Appetizers, Beef
      Yield: 12 servings

      1 lb Very lean beef (chuck or
           -round)
    1/4 c  Worcestershire sauce
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
      1 tb Tomato paste

      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Dried onion
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Garlic powder

  Servings:  12

  Trim all visible fat from the meat and freeze until firm and solid
  enough to slice into thin strips. Cut across the grain and make sure
  that the slices are as thin as you can make them, about 1/8 inch
  thick. Cut slices into 1-inch- wide strips. Arrange strips in a
  shallow baking pan.

  Combine remaining ingredients and pour liquid over strips. Refrigerate
  overnight or for at least 8 hours.

  Preheat oven to 140 degrees. Remove meat from the marinade and place
  the strips on a cake rack over a cookie sheet in the oven. Dry until
  strips will splinter on the edges--from 18-24 hours. Cool completely
  before wrapping lightly with plastic wrap. Jerky will keep in a
  closely covered container for 2 4 weeks.

  OR...use your dehydrator according to manufacturer's recommendations.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 3 servings

    1/2 lb Trimmed venison *
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 ts Garlic Powder
      1 ts Accent
    1/4 ts Black Pepper
    1/4 c  Worcestershire Sauce
    1/4 c  Soy Sauce
    1/4 c  Water
      6 ea Drops Liquid Smoke

  Cut meat into 1/8" thick strips, which is easier if it is slightly
  frozen.
   combine ingredients, and place with meat in refrigerator overnight to
  marinate.  Then place the meat strips in a microwave roasting rack.
  set the microwave on high for 4 to 6 minutes.  after 4 minutes add
  time in 30 second increments.  The idea is to have a dried jerky,
  which means a color change from brown to dark brown, and a
  consistency in the meat that has changed from supple to leathery in
  it's texture. That's it!

      Title: Beef Jerky a la Willie
 Categories: Snacks
      Yield: 1 servings

    1/2 c  Lo salt soy sauce
  1 1/4 ts Onion powder
    1/3 c  Worcestershire Sauce
  1 1/4 ts Garlic powder
  2 1/3 ts Pepper
      2 tb Brown sugar
      1 lb Lean beef
           Liquid mesquite smoke *

  * use in place of smoker.

  Mix all ingredients except beef to make marinade.  Cut thinly sliced
  beef into 1/2 inch strips and marinate for 8 to 12 hours. Smoke using
  mesquite chips for about three hours and then finish drying in oven.
  If doing whole operation in oven use liquid smoke and hang strips of
  beef on highest rack and put shallow pan underneath to catch
  drippings. Turn oven on and set to lowest possible setting and leave
  for 6 to 8 hours until thoroughly dried. A couple of hints that I
  picked up from one of the cooking echos. Use toothpicks or wooden
  skewers to hang meat by, and put a couple of layers of paper towels
  in the pan to collect the drippings and save cleaning problems later
  on.

Hi John,

Here's the recipe for Jerky that we use. We use one of two different
steak sauces (Moore's or Dale's). I don't know if you have either of
these sauces there or not. The ingredient's are: soy sauce, water,
salt, corn syrup, caramel, onion, garlic, sugar, monosodiun glutamate,
ginger and paprika. The Dale's sauce has a saltier taste and the Moore's
is not as salty, I prefer the Moore's.

To make, just slice meat into thin strips and soak in sauce overnight to
marinate. Take out of marinate and let drain on paper towels. Then just
place in dehydrator or whatever you use and dehydrate. I have found that
this jerky tastes just like the kind you buy in the conviences stores.

The best part of making it, is that you just simply purchase the sauce
and go from there. We have used a lot of different types of meat to make
it with, but it needs to be lean as in vension to be the best. If we use
beef, we trim out all the fat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      Lb            Flank Steak, Trimmed *
     1/2  C             Worcestershire Sauce
     1/4  C             Soy Sauce
   2      Tbsp          Liquid Smoke Flavoring
   1 1/2  Tsp           Seasoned Salt
   1 1/2  Tsp           Onion Salt
     1/2  Tsp           Garlic Powder
     1/2  Tsp           Pepper -- freshly ground
                        Nonstick Vegetable Cooking Spray

* Use lean venison or elk flank if it is available.

1. Freeze the flank steak until partially frozen, about 1 hr. Using a
sharp knife, cut diagonally across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick strips.
(For chewier jerky, cut with the grain, but this is only recommended for
card-carrying cowboys.)
2. In a large plastic bag (preferably the self-sealing kind), mix the
remaining ingredients except the cooking spray. Add the sliced beef and
mix well. Seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 24
hours, turning the bag occasionally so the beef strips are evenly
marinated.
3. Remove an oven rack from the oven and lightly spary the rack with
nonstick vegetable spray. Remove the strips from the marinade, shaking off
excess marinade. Pat the strips dry with paper towels. Arrange the strips,
close together but not touching on the rack. Line the bottom of the oven
with aluminum foil (to catch drips).
4. Preheat the oven to 150 F. Place the oven rack with the jerky in the
oven. Bake until a cool piece of jerky (remove from the oven and cool 5
mins) breaks when bent, about 5 hours. Blot any surface fat with paper
towels. Cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 month
at cool room temperature, 3 months in the refrigerator, or 6 months in the
freezer.

Subject: Re: dehydrator recommendations

I agree with Don. I have owned both and the American Harvester is far 
superior. In fact I was in Sam's Wholesale Club today and they were
selling for about $47.00. That is quite a bargain. The Ronco requires you 
to continually rotate trays (because of lack of fan and heat control) and 
the American Harvester is just load it and go. The important reason for 
the heat control is that the product must lose moisture at an even rate, 
otherwise you will develop a hard outer skin and wet insides or vice 
versa. also the temperature is important for doing jerky. The Ronco takes 
much longer also.

BTW an excellent marinade for jerky is equal parts liquid smoke and soy 
sauce.
