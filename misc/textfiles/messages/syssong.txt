 DM> All right... I confess I haven't edited your message. I hate editing
 DM> messages. I have this terrible un-un-uncontrollable fear whenever I
 DM> see  messages. When I was a kid I used to hate the sight of messages
 DM> being edited. My mother said I was a fool. She said the only cure for
 DM> it was to become an editor. So I spent five ghastly years at the
 DM> Editor's Training Center at Totnes. Can you imagine what it's like
 DM> editing the same message for five years?  I didn't want to be an editor
 DM> anyway. I wanted to be a SYSOP! Leaping from game door to game door as
 DM> they float past the screen of every BBS in the world. The Giant Barren
 DM> Realms, The Casino, Tradwars, and the Mighty Time Bank. The smell of
 DM> fresh files, the crash of mighty BBSs! With my best girl by my side...
 DM> we'd sing...sing...SING! .... 
 DM> Oh, I'm a Sysop and I'm OK,
 DM> I sleep all day and type all night...

 DM> :)


  Ohh...this has to be done! :)

  Ohhhh
  I'm a sysop and I'm OK,
  I type all night and I sleep all day!

  I mail my mail, I code my codes,
  I send out for Chinese food.
  I F-REQ .gifs and viewers 
  To get me in the mood!

  (Users:)
  He's a sysop and he's OK.
  He types all night and he sleeps all day!

  I mail my mail, I code my codes,
  Let cops and feds beware.
  I give a special access
  to d00ds with wArEz to sHaRe.

  (Users again here)

  I'm a sysop and I'm OK,
  I type all night and I sleep all day!

  I mail my mail, I code my codes,
  My users give me grief.
  I wish they'd get a real life
  And give me some relief!

  (Users again, ending with muttering)

  I'm a sysop and I'm OK,
  I type all night and I sleep all day!

  I mail my mail, I code my codes,
  This FIDOmail is fine!
  It lets me know of users
  Who aren't as lame as mine!

  (Users run sysop away, begin anarcho-syndicalist bbs)



... Blimey, this redistribution of taglines is trickier than I thought!
