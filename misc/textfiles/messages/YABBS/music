As far as heavy metal goes, the best bands are definitely bands like Iron 
Maiden, Judas Priest, The Scorpions, Black Sabbath and all those old 
bands. Most bands nowadays are like little babies that are nothing 
compared to those above. It used to be when you listened to metal you felt 
like you were listening to something epic.. most new bands don't give me 
that feeling

Sorry, but metal is music for morons... While musically, bands such as 
Black Sabbath were GREAT, there was no message- no intelligence behind it. 
Much like classic rock. 

Will the metalheads finally learn something?

I'm not sure that you can some something like that about either group of
music.  While there is a large amount of dribble in both, both of them also
have some message (at least this is true for classic rock, I don't listen to
metal).  You just have to ignore the stuff about dribble love, etc.

If you haven't heard 'em yet, its doubtful they'll ever be big over 
there... they've been around for a while. They're OK, do a lot of spoken 
word-over-music type stuff. Some K.M. classics are "Jesus is way cool" 
"Gary + Melissa" "The boy who ate lasagna and could jump over a church" 
and so on... funny, but not phenomenal music (then again what is?)

As far as grunge goes, yeah, that's pretty much ALL there is here 
nowadays. These flannel-shirt spawning salmon have been swimming across 
the country all too much, I am good and sick of it (its all crap). Here in

There is other stuff around also, you just have to look for it.  I do admit
that grunge sucks (I am sick and tired of hearing the same bullshit all the
time), but there is an expanding folkish scene (indigo girls, suzanne vega,
tracy chapman, etc), and dance (techno) is really popular right now (at
least around here).

like a big part of raving is to have them in new and interesting places

Definately recommended.
The other is the Roky Erikson tribute album, Where the Pyramid Meets the

its got quite a few really BAD ones too. Artists on the album include ZZ 
Top, Poi Dog Pondering, Primal Scream, Bongwater, Butthole Surfers(!), Th 
Mighty Lemon Drops, Angry Samoans, and the Jesus & Mary Chain. I give it

in some message or another, dislesix(sp?) said something or other

anyway, i have been a fan of both of those bands for a couple of years, 
and i have always really liked them both... in fact, i have bben to one 
dead milkmen concert alredy but am going to another on feb 23 in e. 
lansing.. 
and about the violent femmes... i have thier first album, and it is really 
cool. however, i have heard other stuff off of albums other than the 
first, and i wasn't impressed. oh, well, they are still cool.

i have also been following the "metal sucks/my music rules"conversation. a 
lot of people are very biased against metal and anyone who listens to it. 
as a matter of fact, i used to absolutely HATE metal, just because of the 
image the media had given it up until about 3 years ago, where i met a guy 
that was really into it, and i would be forced to listen to it in massive 
doses while going on car rides... soon i found myself asking him "hey, 
could i borrow that megadeth tape?" etc.... and now i am an avid 
headbanger... i do not listen to the top 40 stuff because it has no 
message; i am sick of whiny rappers/pseudometal bands singing about 
ins{gnificant shit like "will you be my girlfriend, yer sooo fine" and 
shit like that. it just does not interest me.  but i will listen to 
ANYTHING once, and twice if i like it...

Maiden's the greatest band out there as far as I'm concearned (although 
their last couple of albums haven't lived up to my expectations.) I can't 
stand metallica. They're a bunch of stupid slobs (at least that's the 
image they're going for.) I saw them twice on their last tour in LA and it 
was pretty booring.. whenever lars spoke he said "fuck" every other 
word... jason's bass solo wasn't that great... and it was like.. 50 guys 
to every girl... I felt like the biggest wank there... I'm glad I didn't 
have to pay to see them.

Maiden's awesome though... I saw them on their last tour and they kicked 
major ass.. Steve Harris is the most underrated bass player.. he can play 
rings around Les Claypool or Billy Sheehan.. he just doesn't show off but 
plays musically... The only bummer was that I hade these really shitty 
backstage passes.. this guy offered me $50 for each of them, but I said no 
because I thought that  they were good passes, but they only got me into 
some stupid little "Meet Corrosion of Conformity" party... (like I'd want 
to meet them) and all they had back there was a bunch of industry rats (I 
guess I was one of them) and a cute blonde selling 6oz beers for $5.. 
should've sold those damn passes..

I heard a few tracks of Izzy's new album on the radio.. it sounds pretty 
bad... almost like a Tom Petty sort of thing...

Anyone heard the news about Black Sabbath? The old bastards are getting
back together and going on tour... I can't wait for that one...

amazing...

Anyone hear the metal grammy nominations?  They're all excellent bands... 
SoundGardegn, Ministry, Megadeth, NIN and Helmet.  Problem is, 
only Meadeth is actually metal.  

Once they put in an Industrial category, etc, it'll be more fair to the 
true metal groups (of which I don't care much for anyways...).  

But I hope either Soundgarden or Megadeth gets it.  The other ones weren't 
meant to be really commercial bands, and it wouldn't be real to hear 
everyone playing Helmet or Ministry.

To tell you the truth, I don't know about Fixed.  I'm not in the best 
place music-wise right now, so I really don't get much news about 
anything.  But if anyone DOES know something about Fixed, please do let me

Just trying to keep this in the right base... I've got the NoMeansNo / 
Biafra tape, I love it, but I don't have the DOA one. Funny, though, I 
can't help but notice no matter who he sings with they end up sounding 
suspiciously like DK. I also found an interesting tape (bought it at a 
local store for a buck) which is an interview with him from right after 
the Frankenchrist ordeal. It's pretty cool... The Lard album's OK, but I'm 
not crazy about them. Speaking of spoken word, has anyone read any of 
Rollins' written stuff? I've heard some of his spoken word stuff, and he 
seems like an offbeat standup comic, but I've heard he has his own 
publishing company which basically publishes stuff by him and Exene from X 
(you know, from decline of western civ.?). Anyone know more about this?

Ah well, good night.

yeah, i agree.  i think the reason everything sounds like the dk is 'cause 
jello always writes the majority of the songs.  also which lard did you 
hear?  there are two and the second is much better than the first.  i 
don't know too much about henry, but i saw a new spoken album in the 
record store the other day.  i think you can also buy a lot of his books 
at hip record stores.  i haven't heard of any exene spoken stuff or 
written for that matter, but she's put out several solo projects.  did 
anyone catch that movie whose name escapes me now but featured one of the 
beastie boys and john doe (also of X fame)?  i heard it was cool.  also 
try to find some of richard kern's films.  i think one features henry 
rollins.  there is also one named death valley '69 with lydia lunch and 
the music of sonic youth.  like i said before, i could go on for days.

I worshipped them, but once "enter Sandman" came out.. blech.  I saw them

cool. it was me and 2000 other guys with Metallica... this show was a ton 
of dorks, banging their head, while Lars walked around with an armful of 
drumsticks, throwing them out.. *sigh*
  The new meegadeth... SOfar So Good so What was better... IMHO...
I like post-punk, whatever you want to call it. I've never gotten into the

   I was listening to a band called the Warlock Pincers today. Tehy're so 
great... it's kind of like industrial meets rap... id' almost say the 
Beasties industrialized.. but that's my opinion.  They've got some rad 
samples, and great lyrics. they tout themselves as the official sound of 
Satan. Some of their lyrics go:
Mary Mary, quite contrary, Raped by god, a busted cherry
They had no coathangers in that day, so she dropped Jesus in some hay
He lived he laughed he loved he lost,
they nailed that fucker to the cross.
 
I jsut about died alughing when I heard that song.. It's call "Jesus on 
the Urinal Cake", I  do believe. but they're from Denver, and they'e on 
the Waxtrax label. if you go to a waxtrax, LOOK FOR THEM. They have a few 
albums ,the only two that I can remember are _Deadly Kung Fu Action_ and 
_Circusized Peanuts_.  they have a TON of merchandise too, like watches 
(the official time of Satan), and waterbottles, golf tees, little metal 
cars, face towels.. it's great. and with songs like Look, there's a chiken 
with a roll up it's butt, and Squeeze a Loaf, you know it has to be good.
I highly reccomend it, but you may not be able to keep a straight face.
Great music, hilarious lyrics at times...

fixed takes broken and makes it louder and more instrumental, drowning
out most if not all of the lyrics.  by far my most listenable cd for total
mood effect, but the least effective lyrically (no lyrics == ? this isn't
a trick question, ne?).  i really really like it.  favorite tracks of
the six on it are #2: wish, and #6: screaming slave, both of which are
fairly similar grating remixed pseudo industrial, etc. etc.

what do you consider bona-fide? i play a lot without an amp when i leave
my amp at our drummer's house... doesn't sound as good but it works.
or you can get a cheap practice amp for less than $100, or maybe a 
headphones amp for less than that... but if you're just playing for
yourslef or practicing you don't even need an amp really.

Well, if you really want to plug into something, you can just jack your 
guitar into the 1/4" mic-in of your stereo if it has one. Just make sure 
you turn the low end all the way down so that you don't blow your 
speakers. And turn the input volume of the stereo low and increase it 
until it starts to peak. Guitar pickups tend to put out a bit more juice 
than microphones do. But if you're really into it, invest in a dinky 
little amp.. it'll make you sond a lot better. And when you just start 
playing, you fuck up alot and a decent distortion tends to cover up your 
minor screwups pretty well.

I think that a band that doesn't get any respect  is Prong.
Except for their new album, which isn't their best.
The Basslines are so intricate, and The way they use the 
music as a hammer to drive the vocals along fascinates me
Loved them ever since Beg To Differ.

that old church sounds like a great place to see a band, especially some 
old hardcore bands which are few and  far between these days but i guess 
they had their era. i prefer to see a band in a pub/club type atmosphere 
than really huge venues, although rollins at the horden was fuckin' great 
but then again that place isn't that big but about as big as i can handle.
a mate of mine is a drummer in a band called scurge (used to be crimston 
ash), they haven't got anything released yet but they've played a few gigs 
around sydney and the sound is pretty cool. aussie band u am i are touring 
the states with soundgarden, this would be a great show - you should check 
it out if you can - u am i have a great sound and they totally impressed 
sonic youth when they were out here last!

sorry about the delay, but the our network was down on monday. so here's 
the lowdown on the rollins show on friday june 3rd. kim salmon were on 
first at 7 but i was at the pub waiting for some friends. got to the 
horden at 8 just as kim salmon were finishing up. hung around outside 
during the change over, then went in just in time to see tumbleweed coming 
on. i got a good place on the dance floor pretty close to the stage to 
watch tumbleweed put on a great show. the crowd was going off (and so was 
the security at the front - which is what some of my friends told me). one 
of the guitarists from tumbleweed broke a string but they played on anyway 
while the poor bastard had to fix it himself. hung around outside again 
after tumbleweed had finished waiting for rollins to come on. went back in 
about 5 minutes before rollins came on and the place was packed! rollins 
came out (crowd went wild - expected) and they got straight into it 
playing most of the stuff off weight. it was an excellent show with really 
good sound. henry is a great performer - gets totally in to the music - 
and he gave a bit of spoken word before each song usually about what the 
song was about. there was one cool bit which i'll try to remember as best 
as possible: this dude throws a t-shirt at rollins just after he finished 
singing one song, rollins said "don't throw things at the singer, that's 
like....(turns around and picks up bottle of water from in front of the 
drum kit)...that's like this.......(tips out the water on to the 
stage)...here have a drink...(looking at the dude who through the 
shirt)...have a drink....(drinks some)...tastes great.....have a 
drink...(water runs out)...don't throw shit at the singer...(holds up the 
bottle)...i'm not even gonna throw this at you...(throws bottle behind 
him). they did a 10 minute improv on one song (forget the fuckin' name) 
which had some spun out drum sounds. the bass player looked totally amazed 
at the type of people in the crowd and he went off on his 5 string all 
night. after they went off everyone started yelling "henry..henry" and 
they came back out and did a short encore. rollins band played for about 1 
and a half hours and it was a fuckin' great show!

(mainstream or otherwise) other than Country and Westerh shit.  The best 
we can do is check out some local bands (who are mainly punk, which is

When there aren't live bands around (non-country), I just sink into my CD

non-mainstream collection is small.  What I DO have (Pistols, Clash, some 
UK Punk Compilations, RevCo, NiN) is mostly special-ordered in.  Recently, 
tho, a local record store (The Record Baron) has begun to keep some punk 
and industrial in stock so's I don't have to pay obscene prices through 
import orders, but even then, they don't get a hell of a lot in at any one

yeah, prolly something like that. . .personally i think that every single cd
and tape in the store should get a sticker regardless of content, just to
show how silly they are. . .

when the stickers first started coming out, and some stores said they wouldn't
sell labelled items to minors, a group of free speech activists printed

You see parental advisory stickers all over the place in florida-
It's actually illegal to sell stickered records to minors in the state! 
(Can you believe this?)

Of course, this is the state that pionereered such pillars of morality as 
the 11pm weekday/midnite weekend curfew for minors (currently being 
challenged by the ACLU in Dade county), political indoctrination (a recent 
measure passed by the Lake City school board (which is dominated by 
fundamentalist Christians) requires teachers to teach that American 
society and culture is superior not only to every culture in the world, 
but every culture that ever was), and the banning of expression considered 
offensive by those in power (2 Live Crew comes to mind, as does the film 
"The Last Temptation of Christ," both of which were banned in large areas 
of the state).

But I digress.

The only reason anyone *should* come to Florida is if they are a marine

"The christian fundamentalists don't like this band", and my personal

All The Peel Sessions are starting to be released domestically in the US.
They are still not so easy to find, but are a lot easier to find then when

If you like action movies, then you'd love this one.  If you prefer 
serious movies with a message other than "You shouldn't have fucked with 
me, asshole!" then you wouldn't like it.

I loved it. ;-)

I like to listen to stuff like Pantera, Prong,
The occasional Sepultura or Rigor Mortis, anything
that sounds violent. So I like some NiN, but not all,
and I like side two of the CRow soundtrack...I don't
know why, but I also like King Missle, especially
"Detatchable Penis" Spooky, but Cool.

I'd say Golgotha Tenement is fairly representative.  Although I like the 
lyrics in their other stuff better.  I'd advise checking into 
"Concentration" which is their second album.  Their first one isn't quite 
so cool, and does not resemble Golgotha Tenement at all.

The song "Butterfly Wings" and "Perfect Tan" got some degree of airplay, 
these are two songs off of Concentration.

about $33. thats the most expensive stuff around sept vinyl.

Just a little story before i go.  I was working saturday when this guy 
comes up and askes if we have anything to hold vinyl in.  I said that we 
had some 12 bye 12 boxes that we use.  The guy goes, "you mean 13 by 13"  
i said no it will fit in a 12 by 12.  he said that it was impossuible for 
a 13" record to fit intyo a 12 by 12 box.  If you collect vinyl i think 
you should now that record are 12 inches in diameter.  What a moron.

maybe its just funny to me but later.

Twin is fine and dandy,

was pretty cool though.  Fot those of you who haven't been expose to the 
Aphex Twin before his name is Richard James.  He also goes by Polygon 
Window and Caustic Window (?) and a couple of others.

As a beginners ambient album I would suggest a single by the Orb, possibly 
Little Fluffy Clouds if you can.  Or get the KLF (also the Orb) Chill Out, 
this is the album chill out, not the compilation.  

Orbital is good if you are into the dance beat thing, which I am 
sometimes.

If you want to get really wierd and think you like industrial you can try 
NegativeLand, they do really wierd shit with noises and samples.  Really 
strange shit though.  

If you have any others things you think i should check out let me know.  I 
work at a record store so I can probably get it.

Well, just saw the Spin Doctors/Gin Blossoms/Cracker show in Pittsburgh. I 
thought the show was excellent, especially the sound quality. It sounded 
great... no overdriven speakers or amps, but still plenty loud. (I believe 
one of the Gin Blossoms pointed out that the sound engineer on their tour 
is the highest paid in the industry). It was only the fourth show on the 
tour, so there were a few kinks, but probably none noticable to anyone not 
experienced in lighting or sound design.

Cracker played the shortest set, (some 40 minutes I think), so it was 
distilled to the "highlites" (if you will), like Mr. Wrong, Million Miles, 
etc.

Gin Blossoms, well, what can I say... they sound great live, but they 
still can't escape the reality that all their songs sound almost the same 
(different chords, but same structure and tempo usually).

The Spin Doctors were outstanding live, as usual. (Having listened to them 
since they were playing on public radio, it's not a surprise.) There was 
the obligatory encore (yeah, right, I'm sure they would end the show w/o 
playing Two Princes... uhuh... sure... ). 

All told, the 4 1/2 hrs of music was a bargain for the $10.25 lawn tix, 
tho in other places tix may be more expensive- arenas for example.

Keep an eye out for this tour if it comes your way.

you know, that's what i thought when i gotthe disc too...the only songs 
that DON'T really sound like 'hey, jealousy' are the cajun song and the 
country-ish one near the end.  the cool thing about the cajun song is that 
the guy who plays accordion on it is the son of cliftion chenier, a truly 
great zydeco musician...in the words of zydeco musicians everywhere.... 
"ALLONS ZYDECO!"

hey God, why are you doing this to me? 
am i not living up to what i'm supposed to be?
why am i seething with this animosity?
hey God, i think you owe me a great big apology
terrible lie
hey God, i really don't know what you mean.
seems like salvation comes only in our dreams.
i feel my hatred grow all the more extreme.
hey God, can this world really be as bad as it seems
terrible lie
don't take it away from me. 
i need someone to hold on to.
don't take it away from me.
i need someone to hold on to
hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide.
i lost my ignorance, security, and pride.
i'm all alone in this world you must despise.
hey God, i believed the promises and lies
terrible lie
you made me throw it all away.
my morals left to decay.
how many you betray.
you've taken everything
terrible lie
(here comes my favorite part of the song.. the sounds are really deep in 
hatred)
my head is filled with disease.
my skin is begging you please.
i'm on my hands and knees.
i want so much to believe.
i need someone to hold on to.
i need someone to hold on to.
i need someone.
i need someone to hold on to.

waiting for the wine but

KNIVES
My girlfriend say I need hel
My boyfriend says I'd be better off dead
I'm gonna get drunk
Come round and fuck you up
I'm gonna get drunk
Come round and fuck you up
And you can't help my life
But you can hide the knives
My girlfriend says that I'm confused
<y boyfriend says that I'm bad news
All people are shit
Bad trip tatooed on my brain
All people are shit 
Bad trip tattooed on my brain
And you can't help my life
But you can hide the knives
I wanna crawl up inside you and die
I wanna crawl up inside you and die
I wanna crawl up inside you and die
I wanna crawl up inside you and die
And you can't help my life
But you can hide the knives
And you can't help my life
But you can hide the knives


SCREAMAGER

With a face like this
I won't break any hearts
And thinking like that
I won't make any friends
Screw that
forget about that
I don't wannahear about anything like that
Screw that
Forget about that
I don't wanna know about anything like that
I've got nothing to do
'cept hang around and get screwed up on you
Your beauty makes me feel alone 
I look inside but no ones home
Screw that
Forget about that
I don't wanna hear about anything like that

the new order cover and song 2 (sorry, i forget the name) are the only two
songs done in that style (mostly acoustic guitar and vocals)...the rest have
this kind of cheesy synth there too...

of course other people don't consider the synth cheesy :)  its just my opinion

Well, I went to Cedar Point... It was insanely cool... :)
(I'm a coaster fanatic, so... )

The Magnum was pretty good, but very skimpy on the ride part of the 
equation- all it has, really, is the huge drop, a little sideways thingy, 
and that's it. But it's hard to beat 194' down a 60 degree angle. :)

The Raptor was very slick, and worth the wait (almost 2 hrs). Your legs 
dangle and you have a perfect view if you're in the front. It's wild. 
especially the corscrew thingy where the track turns around on an axis and 
your legs are spun outwards. Very very cool.

The Corkscrew... well, not really worth mentioning. Way too short. But the 
3 inversions are nice, as is the part where you go over the people.

The Mean Streak - didn't ride it, couldn't tell ya. It wasn't worth the 
huge line.

The Gemini... I liked this one. Sure, it's old, not that steep, wooden, no 
loops or such, but it was a well designed ride- well placed hills, lotsa 
fun! (I went on it about 3 times within half an hour).

well, i think they're aussies...(i'm pretty sure)...and they play pretty 
bizarre music..they take some songs and do pretty bizarre cover versions 
of the songs...for the most part, Nick Cave is a pretty dark character...
most of their music is pretty dark...(for lack of a better way to describe 
them---someone jump in and help out if you can!)
one example i can give, there was a song a looooong time ago by a C&W 
singer called Glenn Campbell...the song was called "By the time I get to 
Phoenix"...well, Nick Cave does the cover version pretty long and drawn 
out and quite the opposite of how it's supposed to be..so i guess you 
could say his cover versions end up to be parodies of the originals...
gee, wish i could explain this better than i am.....
they RARELY tour the US though...generally they tour Europe

Subject: Badger reviews new albums
Date: Tue Jul 26 10:08:34 1994

Well, they are new to ME, anyway. Some stuff I've nbought recently and 
what I thought, not that it matters.

PRIMUS-PORK SODA
Absolutely Awesome....The songs My Name Is Mud, DMV, Mr. Krinkle, Pork 
Soda, and Hamburger Train rule the universe...."Swilling down those can's 
of Swine" GET THIS ALBUM OR SO HELP ME I"ll GET YOU!

SOUNDGARDEN-SUPERUNKNOWN
I don't know why I keep doing this to myself...every time they come out 
with a new album, I buy it...and I always only like ONE SONG, or two at 
most. My two on this album? MAILMAN and 4TH OF JULY. Otherwise, flat and 
tepid...I'd avoid it unless you are a Soundgarden fanatic

NIN-THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL
I'm a Metalhead of old...always was, have played in several garage 
bands...I didn't wash befor  there was a GRUNGE SCENE...and I have to say, 
that even though I didn't expect it...DOWNWARD SPIRAL kicked my ass. Great 
album....Side one especially rulse, even PIGGIES.

TYPE O NEGATIVE-BLOODY KISSES (LTD. EDITION NON JEWELBOX)
This is music to ritually murder someone by. I swear the song Christian 
Woman makes me think about sex on a tabernacle. The whole album is more 
Gothic than St. Dennis in France...if you like Goth, you'll love this..I 
myself kind of like it, but feel uncomfortable with Lyrics like "She'd 
like to know God...OOH Love God...Feel her God...Inside of her, Deep 
inside of Her...Jesus Christ looks like me."

THERAPY?-TROUBLEGUM
YOU MUST BUY THIS ALBUM! The following songs will destroy your mind:
KNIVES, SCREAMAGER, DIE LAUGHING, TRIGGER INSID, FEMTEX, UNREQUITED, 
BRAINSAW...There's a sample of "You are my sunshine" that can drive a 
strong man to weep and a powerful woman to kill. Excellent album, heartily 
recommended by THIS manic depressive. If you've ver been diagnosed with a 
mental disorder OR taken drugs (BOTH of which help even more) YTou will 
hear your own voice here.

TOOL-UNDERTOW
It was a toss up as to which album I liked more, this one or THERAPY?, but 
Therapy barely won it, as almost all of side one here is all over the 
radio. But this is still a great album, especially DISGUSTIPATED, which, I 
think, setteles the whole "Meat is Murder" REM crap once and for all. 
"THIS is natural...This is Natural...This is Natural...LIFE FEEDS ON 
LIFE...LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE...LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE...This is Natural.." truly 
an awesome power  these lads have. "AND I HEARD THE SHRIEKS, and I said to 
God, what is that horrible wail...He said, it is harvest day, and those 
are the Carrots..to them, it is the HOLOCAUST!"

Well, that's all for now.

hey , does Nick Cave do "Helpless" by Neil Young in concert?  He did it
on a Neil tribute album a few years ago.  just wondering.

you 'progressive` fans might want to pick up the tribute it's got:

The Pixies (very very good)  "Winterlong"
Nick Cave (good)  "Helpless"
Nicki Sudden and the French Revolution (ver, very bad) Captain Kennedy
Sonic Youth (awesome, I thought it was Neil himself!) "Computer Age"
Victoria Williams (unbelievable)  "Words" and "Don't Let it bring youdown"
Dinosaur Jr.  (bad)
Flaming Lips  (bad)
Henry Kaiser (ok)
Bong Water (terrible)
Soul Asylum (good)  "Barstool Blues"


and some others that I can't remember.  It's worth getting for 
Victoria Williams, the Pixies, and Sonic Youth

Christ!  I *(never* get any good bands here (Bdn).  Aside from the cuntry 
and western shit that goes by, the best that we get are groups like Gowan 
who don't realize that the 80's ended, and their type of pop tunes are 
just not marketable anymore!  Not that I liked them during the 80's, 
either.  I was listening to The Sex Pistols and The Clash, etc.

Ooooh, I GOTS to get some more music!  I picked up Skinny Puppy - 12 Inch 
Anthology, and it was pretty good.  My exposure to SP has been pretty 
minimal so far, so I must buy more!  

Picked up the new Watchmen disc: In The Trees.  Must say, I was 
dissapointed.  It's not nearly as good as McLarenFurnaceRoom (their 
first).  It's much too slow, almost plodding compared to MLFR, and the 
sound is just...flat.  Avoid.

BTW, hash, I hear there's a new Helmet album out, but I haven't been able 
to find it yet.  Any news?

WIND UP TOYS

if most us were wind-up toys
could we trust the few of us that weren't
to wind us up when ncessary?
i think not.
we would be a separate opressed minority
even if we were in the majority
it would still be that way

the one's that weren't wind up toys
would have the upper hand
and we would have to look out for each other
because they wouldn't

they would only wind up those the saw fit
those that conformed to their ways

if most of us were wind up toys,
it wuld be in our interest
to learn how to wind ourselves up
or wind each other up
that's reality
that's the way it is

It's really cool...the album is called "the last temptation of reid"  and

about 1987-88 (around there) and much resembles Ministry now.....enjoy.

Jello Biafra and Mojo Nixon... Pretty interesting. Also a band
called the Dick Nixons is interesting too...

yes...i know about it...in fact have the cd and the ep "will the foetus be 
aborted" (figgers eh? - the radio dude would know)....yeah its kinda 
weird, i thinks its jello gone country and i don't like - but  i buy it 
cuz jello is god and i have everything he puts out.  i Esp. like his 
spoken word stuff (No More Cocoons, High Preistess of Harmful Matter, and 
forget the third one).   The name of Mojo Nixons band is called the 
"Toadliqours".   i liked mojo better when he was skid roper and doing 
stuff like "Debbie Gibson is Pregnant With My two Head Lovechild"  and 
"Elvis Is Everywhere"....remember: Michael J Fox has no elvis in him...

"people will mosh to anything. . .i mean anything"

I know. TMBG (of all groups) is cursed with a small, but extremely 
obnoxious following of 13-14 year olds who *mosh and stage dive* at their 
concerts. 




eh?


I love TMBG, but I don't mosh to them. I
I'll only mosh if it's loud, hard, and inspired.

moshing to instanbul (not constantinople) IS fun, trust me.  let me just 
stick in my $19.95 for a second: if ou think it sucks having the brats 
around you, imagine how hard it is to be mistaken for one.  there's this 
local band here that as the story goes "all the college kids started 
liking it, then the high school kids starting coming, and that was ok, but 
then the middle-schoolers started coming and it just got so annoying." 
now, as a ver recent ex-mid schooler, i think this sucks.  'cause people 
look at me and think "what a follower" but i'm really there for the music. 
so think twice before chewing some 13 year-olds ear off.  they might need 
it to hear the music.  later.

As an old hand in the Pit (Been going since I was 13, am 22 now) I thought 
I'd take this moment to tell people something:If you mosh into me and 
expect to get away with it, you are a dead man. Now, if I am IN the pit, 
I'm fair game. We all know that. And if I'm one of those buttheads who 
just mann the wall all night, kick me in the nads. But when i'm at the 
bart and some little malchick tries to make himself feel big by attacking 
me because I'm larger than him, he's a corpse. Same for a female spinning

i don't want to personally attack you ar anything, but i feel you have the 
wrong attitude.   I was in pits in Grade 7, and i am 25 now.  When there 
was slammming then, there was no such thing as "moshing".  Slam dancing 
was and will be a representation of resentment of the "up classes" - as 
originally said by Queenie of The Slits.  Moshing is and always will be 
those who are out to hurt others and have total diregard for others - 
wether their assholes or not.  Slamming was a punk thing, the idea of 
which i still like....moshing was a "metal" thing.

I dunno, i may seem outta line here, but i wanna defend your point.
Slamming was w/Sid & Co. (for those who are clueless: The Sex Pistols)
or maybe i should refer to them as Johnny & Co. anyhoo...who cares? That 
seems to be the time and musical period that slamming was founded and 
practiced mostly...however it DID carry on into the early 80's from my 
recollection...now moshing became familiar to me about 4 years ago
 w/fame of Pearl Jam...so i guess i'd concur w/Sly on this one...although 
being a pretty non-violent person, i just always kind of stayed on the 
fringes of the crowd....my bones are pretty fragile compared to other 
ppl's, so i didn't wanna be laid up and out of work for any length of 
time!

well, i'm no expert on the matter....this is just my fraction of a

the early to mid 80s with the likes of DRI and Suicidal Tendencies and the

I was soaked in Gasoline and playing with a match."

ime i heard the sex pistols i thought it was just 
whiney(cant spell) drivel.  Then came along a band called Minor Threat and 
totally changed my perception of what real music was.  I wouldnt classify 
Minor Threat as punk, i called it skate rock then, you call it whatch 
want.,  i just call it damn cool.  Another great band is 7 seconds.  Thier 
version of 99 red balloons kicks ass.  produced and backing vocals by Ian 
MacKay(sp)from MT and fugazi.

you bet bub!  Minor Threat rulez!  they're one of the bands i forgot on my 
list...but when i saw Threat in T.O. - it was the best sound, best effort 
put into a show and damned best pit i was in.... and even though they 
played in a big club...the cover was only $3.  7 Seconds is indeed a 
another good band...puit on a good, quality show.  Met  Kevin Seconds at a 
Rollins spoken word in T.O. as well.

can be used for re-tuning (the other way 'round).

It WAS available at the local Record Baron for (get this) $19.97! Cheap! 
But they also had the Tales from the Trial discs for the same price, so I 
got those.  No More Cocoons was $16.97, so I picked that up next, and by 
the time I remembered that I Blow Minds for a Living was still there, 
someone else picked it up. :( Sadness.  Actually, the next thing I want to 
pcik up is the Rollins Boxed Life disc.  But, I DID get a WaxTrax!

If I could FIND some Nick Cave, I would.  I've tried orderinthem in 
through various record stores, usually getting a "Nick Who?  ...*rustling 
papers*... no, we don't have any of that.", but once I got a sympathetic 
"No, we've tried and just can't get any in." at the Record Baron.  That 
WAS about a year ago, though, and they have changed distributors since 
then, so...I'll have to ask my next paycheque.

coming out (Sept 30, I believe, I'll have to check that one), so HOAHV may 
be the new single...?

The only other Non-Bootleg Pistols album is the soundtrack for "The Great 
Rock 'N Roll Swindle" which is a wonderfully hilarious, totally fictitious 
look at the Pistols' career from Malcom's point of view.  It's got some 
rare demo material (Johnny B. Goode/Road Runner being my personal fave), 
and quality copies of Sid's studio work.  A pretty good album, and I'm 
glad it was finally released domestically, because I was about to 
consider mail-ordering for it (via a mail-in record aauction).

distribution SUCKS....one of my favorite bands, the connells, is on that 
label, it took me nearly a YEAR to find one of their albums...TVT really 
doesn't promote the bands well, and it doesn't distribute their albums 
very well.  and some of the bands don't like this.  trent reznor's fight 
with TVT is very well known...

yeah, Wendy O. and the Plasmatics!  The did a guest shot on SCTV with
John Candy.  pretty wierd.

one of the songs they recorded (so I'm told) was done with each musician
going into a separate room.  they were given a starting count and then
left to their own. By the end of the song it was total chaos.

Wendy O. was actually in a couple of cheap movies and hosted USA's Nightflight
heavy metal show in the early '80`s.  ahhh,,,, early '80s heavy metal  :)
