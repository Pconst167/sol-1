On Guam there are many types of food, but you better be careful because 
they can be so spicy, like one dish is mostly red hot chili peppers in 
oil. THe food on Guam is also very greasy, they use a lot of oil. Like 
thge other day, I was in the park and some people came up to me and 
offered me some ox tails that was cooked in literaly grease. I almost 
puked. WEll if you have any questions about Guam food, just leave me a

Date: Tue Jul 26 08:53:03 1994

i have discovered the BEST way to cook the BEST chicken breasts in the 
world is this way:

first, salt your chicken breasts (boneless) and put them between two 
layers of waxed paper...then pound the HELL out of em w/a meat 
tenderizer...if you don't know what one is, go to Lecher's in any mall and 
ask the lech behind the counter...(heheheh)...or call Jeff Smith at 
1-800-Fru-galG..heheh...or just ask mom...(like SHE has any clue???)
anyhow, pound the hell out of the breasts then remove the waxed paper 
crumbs from the breasts (if you do it right, the waxed paper should be 
resembling crumbs by now)  then squeeze lemon juice all over the breasts, 
get out your pepper mill and grind some pepper onto the breasts...last but 
not least, sprinkle some "Tony Cashare's Creole Seasoning" onto the 
breasts.  Then cook them over the grill (w/some hickory chips thrown in 
for that yummy smoked flavour) for about 10 or 12 min.  You will have THE 
TENDEREST and TASTIEST chicken breasts ever! I followed these exact steps 
this past Sunday...they were to die for! I will NEVER eat another boneless 
chicken breast out at a restaurant as long as I live, cuz now i know what 
they fail to do...the secret is in the pounding...I pound MOST cuts of 
meat before cooking them now...talk about tender!!! It just MELTS in your 
mouth...

sorry i took up so much space, but happy cooking and munching! :)

Subject: garlic pasta
Date: Sat Jul 30 16:38:47 1994

okey here it is.....the world's most garlicky pasta

1 can crushed or diced tomatoes ( you can use fresh too though)
2 cans tomatoe paste
7 cloves of garlic  (yes, 7 or so more can be beter sometimes though)
1/2 an onion diced
olive oil
basil
parsley flakes
oregano
and anythign else you like in sauce

first totally pulverize the garlic..smash it then dice it  the best thing 
to use to smash it is the side of a butcher knife cause it is big..point 
the blade towards you adn that way your hand won't get sliced....
next heat the sauce pan you intende to use to hot but not "water skipping 
hot" you'll burn your oil if it is that hotyou'll know it is right when 
the oil gently slides around the pan...now add the onions to the oil..you 
should use about 1- 2 TBsp of oil...sautee until just barely done...add 
the garlic ( cause garlic cooks faster than onion ) quickly add the 
tomatoes so hte garlic doesn't burn..(give the garlic about 30-60 second 
b4 you add the tomatoes)  add the tomatoe paste one can at a 
time..stirring to blend...add any other ingredients now.... to the sauce 
add about 2 TBSPof basil oregano and parsley flakes..if the sauce seems a 
little thick carefuly add small amount s of tomatoe juice or any citrus 
juice ( grapefruit doesn't work very well though)  let the sauce simmer 
for aprox 30 min or longer if you like...

now for the pasta....
16 oz of pasta
water (doh!)
salt
olive oil
basil
oregano
parsley flakes
butter

start the water for the pasta and once it has boiled add the following:
salt to taste
olive oil aprox 1-2 TBSP
     ( the olive oil keeps the pasta from sticking during cooking)
basil 1 1/2 TBSP
oregano 1 1/2 TBSP
parsley flakes  2- 3 TBSPS  

let the water boil for a few min until it turns green ( yes green)
add the pasta and let cook uncovered for aprox 8- 10 min or until al dente
drain and butter pasta  serve with parmesan cheese and sauce..nummy

oh yeah a little dried herb tip : before you add herbs to any recipie 
crush them in your hand  this releases alot of hte oils in hte herb and 
lets out a more potent flavor....

i hope you enjoy this let me know the response..okey??

Subject: Garlic Bread
Date: Sat Jul 30 23:23:51 1994

As garlic seems to be popular around here (yes!), here is Zbadba's be-all 
and end-all garlic bread recipe. Very Very simple.

1 loaf bread, sliced *longitudinally* (i.e. not in slices, but top half 
and bottom half)
Garlic powder (or garlic salt, if you prefer (which I don't))
Oregano
Parmesan & Romano cheese, grated (from a can is fine. You can also use 
just one or the other, but IMHO, it's better w/ a blend)
Butter (or margarine if you're *that* health-conscious)

In a small sauce pan melt a half stick of butter (assuming it's a good 
sized loaf of french bread). Sprinkle (or pour) copious amounts of garlic 
powder on the (dry) bread. Pour melted butter over garlicked bread. Add a 
*lot* of cheese (basically, an even 1/8" layer or so). Sprinkle w/ 
oregano. Put in oven at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes. When you open the 
oven, it should smell. It may not be an appetizing smell at first. Ignore 
it. Serve bread while still warm. It's yummy. Very.

Also, if you have the garlic cloves on hand, and you have the time, sautee 
garlic in the butter, and eliminate the garlic powder from the recipe.

I like this on a big loaf of french bread, but using a sweeter bread (like 
a wheat bread) produces a really neat contrast, and should be tried once 
you've got the hang of it. Also, experiment with the amounts of stuff. I 
wasn't real specific- different people have different tastes.

Don't forget - use the top and bottom halves, putting the ingredients on 
the open faces.

my current quick dinner is:
1 1/2 cups of cooked brown rice (bulk)
random veggies (more good vitamins)
small amount of cheese (to make it all sticky)
salsa (to make it taste good)
pasta sauce (to make it red)

mix it all together and roll it up in flour tortillas (like moo shoo or a
boritto).

it sounds pretty weird, but it tastes okay, fills you up, and is pretty 
healthy.  Plus it is easy to substitute just about anything you have 
lying around into the mix (I add tofu somtimes)...

its okay by itself too, but the tortillas make it cooler somehow...and ignoring
the rice it only takes about 6 minutes to make (4 to cook the veggies and 2
to mix it all together)...for good rice i reccomend getting a rice cooker,
which makes making excellent rice trivial.

Hey all ...
 
Of late I'm in an interesting situation.  Basically, I have
no money.  I won't go into any big sob story, but was wondering
if anyone has any great ideas for really cheap but filling foods.
I'm not in a position to worry too much about taste (I've been
surviving off porridge lately), what I'm looking for is high
quantity at bare minimum price.
 
                        Ideas ?

anything!
other than that, pasta w/butter, garlic, pepper, and perhaps some kind of

i guess), and good old bread w/butter and jelly....sheesh! i know i was

mmmmmmMMMMmmmm!!! i have a delicious recipe i got out of the newspaper, of 
all places! it was for a microwave, but i tailored it to my "stove-top" 
cooking ways...

Linguini W/Scallops and Spinach

l pkg linguini pasta          1 tsp. salt
chopped onion                 1/4 tsp. black pepper
3 tbsp. olive oil             pinch cayenne pepper
couple of garlic cloves, minced
3 tbsp. frsh lemon juice      1 tbsp. grated lemon peel (yellow part)
red or green bell pepper (diced)
1 lb. bay scallops (or chicken strips or shrimp)
1 pkg. fresh spinach          1/2 c. crumbled feta cheese

1.  Cook pasta
2.  Saute onion, peppers, meat and spinach in olive oil.
3.  Add seasonings to sauteed mixture.
  (#3 includes lemon peel and lemon juice)
4.  Cook sauteed mixture until meat is fully cooked and spinach is 
completely broken down...
5.  Drain pasta.
6.  Melt butter in pasta pot until it sizzles...then add pasta and toss.
  (can add garlic to butter, if desired)
7.  Serve pasta on plate, and top w/sauteed mixture...crumble feta cheese 
over the top of sauteed mixture.

EXCELLENT DISH! IT SOUNDS STRANGE, BUT YOU GOTTA TRY IT!
Incidentally, mushrooms are yummy in this, too.  Don't add basil or 
oregano, because it will drown out the flavors of the other stuff, which 
is very important to the success of this dish.  Of course you can increase 
the amt. of garlic used...for all you garlic lovers out there!  

For the vegetarians out there: this dish works well w/out the meat, too...
just don't put any in!
It is a DEFINITE MUST TRY in every household! It is pretty quick and easy 
to make, too! If anyone wants the microwave version, email me at 

     cjpa@tenet.edu

and i'll mail you a copy...don't forget to include your mailing address..

"Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning" which comes in a green cylindrical 
container..it lasts forever, and i spruce up all kinds of foods w/it..
since i only use Sea Salt and freshly ground Peppercorns in my daily 
cooking routines (besides a wide variety of herbs and spices), this was a 
welcome addition to my kitchen!  Anyhow...try it...a friend recommended it 
to me, and i wonder how i survived so long w/out it! Needless to say, she

I know your pain, Steyr...but unfortunately being on another continent

Go with Fruit if you can get it (It's usually not TOO expensive, and my 
carnivore rhetoric aside, is quite tasty) and breads are filling in the 
extreme...a little of them will go a long way.

This is a story I HAVE to tell you guys...I was in a Super Stop And Shop 
this week, and I bought about Two Dozen Bagels of various taste ( I LOVE 
BAGELS, even the crappy Stop and Shop variety) and as I was leaving, a 
tall blond man said "Those are Bagels."
I said "Very observant."
He said "Are you a Jew?"
I said "Why?"
He said "I don't like Jews."
I said "Yes, I'm a Jew. Names Abraham. Nice to meet you."
He walked away. I bought my Bagels, went home, had them with Turkey and 
cheese (My fav.) and wondered why people are bigoted against the might 
bagel. Oh well.
That's the story...and it really happened is the sad part.

pasta is always a good cheap meal, but ramen noodles are really bad for you.
shit loads of sodium + tons of fat (they are cooked in fat before they are
packaged)...even not using the flavoring doesn't help much.  and healthy
ramen is much harder to come by (and costs more).

anyway, stick to pasta and rice.   if you want sauce get the canned stuff
(i really like hunts), and keep the leftovers in an old jar.  the cans are 
usually ~$.50  to $1 cheaper than the jars.  and buy the pasta in bulk, 3lb
boxes are pretty common, and usually run in the $1 to $2 range.

for rice just buy plain rice and add what you want, the prepackaged flavored
stuff is a lot more expensive and bad for you.  for spices go to ethnic stores
rather than the supermarket.  for instance curry powder is $3/jar in pittsburgh
at the giant eagle, but $.75 for about the same amount at a mid-eastern store
about 200 meters away.

frozen veggies are usually a good deal and a lot healthier than canned stuff,
and english muffins are cheap bread and better than generic white bread.  
for fruit bananas are the cheapest fruit you can buy...

strange, mysterious things happen. The following tale is 
true...Unfortunately.

I was in am Almacs here in RI...(NOTE: To those of you in Florida, The 
same man who until recently ran the Kash -N- Karry chain owns these 
stores) I was attempting to buy poppyseed bagels, and a woman who looked 
like a cast extra from IRONWEED approached me.
    "The devil." She said. I assumed she just thought I was the devil.Then 
she spoke again. "He's in there, you know." And she tapped my bag o 
bagels. "That's why the poppyseeds...to hold him."
    "Do tell." I said, being as how insanity interests me.
    "When he was banished from heaven, he was imprisoned in the
 popp ...That's how the drugs happened."
    "Oh?"
    "Yes...and now he's in there." Tapping my Bagels again, she retreated, 
and all scoffing aside...I bought Egg Bagels.

actually MUCH cheaper than some of the other cheeses at my store...i shop  
at Kroger, and they buy bulk feta and cut it up in chunks, put it in 
little containers w/water (preserves the feta) and sell it like that in 
their little "cheese section" over by the coffee beans, sausages, and 
whatnot...check, i'm hoping you'll be pleasantly surprised! :)

Pain ?  Naah ... not yet at any rate.  But as for fruit being cheap !  
Hahahahahahahaha .... I could only dream !  (I love fresh fruit).
Bread is good, and not over priced, but as for a little going a long way ? 
 I find a lot goes a little way (which means the cash outlay increases in 
direct proportion).

Thanks to everyone that posted a suggestion.

I hadn't really looked at rice much, but I will now.  Although I don't 
think I'll get much for the (checks wallet, pockets, bottom of bags, 
underneath seat cushions, etc) $0.90 I have left.  Oh well ... I only have

It's this colored powder that you add water to...sweetened/flavored sugar 
water! Some comes pre-sweetened (which was a big thing when it first came 
out, i might add! ;) ) and the original packets are about 20 cents a paket 
and come w/no sugar...you gotta add about a cup or so to make it 
consumable

hey, i'm not trying to knock KoolAid...i grew up w/the stuff! My mom 
always bought Wyler's tho..in the huuuuuuuuuge cans! I loved Grape 
Wylers...the lemonade wasn't bad, either....thus creating the birth of 
Country Time Lemonade...my heart still lies w/Wyler's....Since I came from 
a big family, we had to buy the cheapie stuff....ie: Suave shampoo!

its a powder that when added to water gives you sugar flavored water in a
plethora of nifty colors.  it comes in a bunch of flavors, but they should 
really just be done by color.  the most common (by far) is red, but you can
get it in blue, green, yellow, pink, purple, orange, just about any major
color you can think of.  i even heard that there was a clear for a while 
(although it may have been wylers or flavoraid, two competitors).

its a cheap way to flavor water ($0.12 + one cup sugar for half gallon of
flavored water).  i like it mixed with 1/2 cup of sugar better though, the
regular stuff is way too sweet.

even tho they're not technically colors, i think a black or a grey 
koolaid would be cool. and the only flavor i know by name is great 
bluedini, but that's no help since god only knows what a bluedini is 
s'posed to taste like 
and not all of us can get green  :) so we have to be green instead.

try making it with a cup and a half of sugar. bouncy bouncy bouncy 
koolaid also makes a cool hair dye w/out sugar of course. for a day i had 
a neat moroon colored hair thanks to black cherry koolaid. too bad i went 
around smelling like candy all that day.

Out of curiousity, has anyone tried the garlic bread recipe I posted a few

Also, green kool-ade is my fave. :) However, mixing colours also produces 
interesting results. Bluedini and green look cool together. Also, mixing 
orange and blue in the right amounts gives you a passable grey- looks 
absolutely disgusting, but since kool-ade does not follow any known laws 
of aesthetics (or physics, for that matter), it still tastes good. :)

ah, its just as easy (but a bit more expensive) to make your own pizza

you just need to invest in a pizza stone (bout 25 bucks) then you can have
all the pizza you want.  Buy the dough from a pizzarria if you want to save
lots of time.

Pizza Sauce:

olive oil, garlic, salt, peper, one of those large cans of peeled italian
tomatoes (not tomatoe paste or pureee or the crushed ones but the whole kind)

put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy saucepan.  Add one (or three :) 
cloves of finely chopped garlic and some black peper.  Cook over low heat so
the garlic sizles but doesn't brown for about a minute.

drop in all the tomatoes (not the juice tho, just use a fork to transfer the
tomatoes over).  Add some salt and turn the heat up to cook off all the liquid.
while its cooking, crush the tomatoes up witha  big wooden spoon so you don't
have humongous lumps (you will always have some, just not lots :).

once its nice and thick you're done

then you have to make the pizza

sun-dried tomatoes are really good in pesto too...  sometimes it is nice to
rinse them off a bit first, cause they tend to have tons of salt or something
on them...

I'm not an expert on sun-dried tomatoes, but couldn't ya just buy tomatoes 
and sit 'em out in the sun for a day or two?  We dried fruits and veggies 
in my 4th grade science class, and it only took a couple days to 
completely dry 'em.  Just a thought, I'm sure it'd be cheaper than buying 
'em dried...
planning on doing Italian this weekend - with that pasta recipe and the

I guess salt would help 'cure' them quicker maybe? Well, i have a few 
cherry tomatoes; i guess i could experiment w/one or two of them...put 
them under a glass bowl, perhaps atop a cutting board to soak up
 any or condensation...i think i WILL try! :)  sure beats paying a coupld

hmm, i know i've seen them around cheap, but i can't remember where ... 
look for someplace that might sell food in bulk, since its bound to be cheaper
per unit at least (if you can find a place that has a big ol barrel of them
and lets you fill up your own bags you'll also save a lot)

you can also soak them in water to plump them back up a little so its not
so much like eating beef jerkey :) ... but as my mom found out you can't 
marinade them in anything oilbased until you've reconstituted them some, the
oil can't soak into the fully dried ones

well, you can also make pesto and sun-dried tomato pizza ... 

just don't add the butter to the pesto sauce (and maybe not the cheese).

pesto and sausage is also pretty good.

so is olive paste ... basically black olives, garlic and olive oil (i can 
post the proportions another time) on pizza crust with cheese, yummy :)

Brian's recipe for boiled water:

supplies:
1 cauldron (extra large)
various sub-munitions lifted from an old Air Force weapons depot
1 frankferter (the kind with the cheese in the middle)
water (the wet kind)
3 live nudibranks (sea slugs)
a gas oven

   First place the cauldron in an ex-boy/girl friends kitchen.  Take the 
sub-munitions and place them in the cauldron.  Now stand back and admire 
your work.  Manipulate the frank so that it is facing due south and begin 
remove your clothes.  Once in the nude, take one of those little styrofoam 
cups from under your ex's sink and begin to fill the cauldron (yes, one 
cup at a time!).  Now open the oven and turn on the gas....do not light 
yet!  Timing is critical!  Now take whatever is in the garbage and replace 
it with the food in the fridge.  Let the garbage chill for 31 minutes.  
After the garbage is chilled and the former-contents-of-the-fridge are 
defrosted, place the live sea slugs in the cauldron.  Now begin tossing 
(under haned mind you) the garbage in to the cauldron.  Don't forget to 
leave the styro-cup in the garbage (depletes the ozone don't ya know) and 
light the oven.  After the mushroom cloud dissipates and the rubble stops 
smouldering, you should find that in the pot there should be something 
that resembles a boiling liquid.  WARNING!!!  DO NOT DRINK THE LIQUID!!! 
THIS EXERCISE WAS FOR AMUSEMENT PURPOSES ONLY!!!

after recovering from the burn ward, you may feel hungry for a baked 
potato, the directions are as follows.......

for those of you yankies who havn't tried them heres how it's done


you need 3 to 4 med to large green tomatoes..thats the ones that are about 
2 weeks from turning red. they must be firm to the touch

2 cups yellow corn meal

place enough greese in a large frying pan so that the bottem of the pan 
has about 1/4 inch of greese.
slice the tomatoes in slices about 1/4 inches thick. put the 2 cups of 
corn meal in a plate and batter the sliced tomatoes one at a time and make 
sure that you cover them well. fry them in the greese untill brown NOT 
BURNT.. salt and pepper to taste

there great alone or with other dishes this should serve about 4 to 6 
people unless you like them like i do then there a meal for one..

You take some green tomatoes from the garden and wash them.
You then dip them in flour or any other spices you would like.
You then fry them in a frying pan in oil.
The location of the movie is about ten minutes from my house.

You're makin' me hungry Nat.
I think I'll go and see if I can scare up a big plate full of fried squash 
and onions, black-eyed peas, fried okra, and some corn bread.
And to top it off, a big ol' glass of iced tea.

(Damn, I'm hungry !)

Anybody know any good recipies(mixtures) for sushi or sashimi. If you do 
not know what sashimi is it is like seaweed in a circle, with rice in the 
middle and then fish. Well later,

taste quite like limes or lemons (most kool-aid flavors don't taste like 
they're called anyway :) ) hmmm it's kinda hard to describe what it 
tastes like, except for sugar...but it's got the lovliest shade of green 
i've ever seen...i love to pour it in a clear glass and just look through 
it...

we can't get in in vt either, so i get it imported to me by my dear 
friend nat from MI :) it's more than i drink to us...it's kinda a weird

them, toasting 2 pieces of bread, covering the bread with peanut butter 
and then placing the bacon from the pan onto the bread. the heat from the 
bacon melts the peanut butter and i like it like that. mommy used to make 
me those instead of blt's because i used to hate tomatoes. that's the 
only kind of peanut butter sandwich i like.

oh i think banana flavored things are even worse than peanut butter.
i like real bananas though. and banana splits and bananas dipped in 
chocolate. banana is a fun word to type i think...banana banana banana

well i just had to make dinner for myself again and so hence another 
recipe  this one is a stew of sorts made up of shark, tomatoes, and garlic 
being the most prominent flavor features....

Tomato garlic and shark stew

this recipie is based on what i made for myself so the proportions are 
mad e for 2 small servings or one large one...

1 filet of shark cubed  (i suppose any other firm fish would suffice 
though)
.5 cups of onion  chopped
1 small potatoe diced small
.5 large tomatoe chopped (very ripe!!!!)
2 cloves garlic chopped 
freshly ground pepper
salt
red pepper and cayenne (available in a powdered form)
juice of a small orange
.25 cup of plain yougrt
2 tablespoons butter
.25 cup of Uncle Grant's SALUTE sundried tomato and garlice dressing 
    (optional but it really makes the dish!!  available from health food 
stores i would think)
.5 cup frozen peas

in a pan suitable for the servings you wish to make melt butter and sautee 
onions..after the onions hav started ot turn translucent add garlic and 
potatoes...stir and let begin to brown...add shark cubes and enough warm 
water to cover the ingredients + .5 inches..add tomatoes, spices, half of 
the dressing, and juice..let boil uncovered until potatoes are tender..add 
water during cooking to maintain consistency and water level during 
cooking time..add the yogart about 1/2 way through the cookingbut it can 
be later than that also...add the rest of the dressing and the peas asthe 
potatoes become tender and let cook until peas are warmed thorough...

for best results if using frozen fish defrost in microwave covered with 
water turning halfway through defrost time...also using a skillet would be 
best for this dish because of its large bottom and relatively low sides...
you may also wish to puree a part of the stew to produce a creamier 
consist... the flavor of this dish is contingent on the amout of water 
that boils away...if you would like a stronger flavor use more water..if 
not use just enough to allow sufficient cooking....

i hope you all enjoi this one cause i sure did...it has great texture, 
color and the shark picks up the flavors exceptionally well...

let me know if you try this one...
