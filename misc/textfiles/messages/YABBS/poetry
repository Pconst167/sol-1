SONNET 3

I plant vegetable matter in his soul,
Roots sprout, anchoring him to the ground.
Secretly I grin, for that was my goal:
Keeping him with me, sweet words will abound.

If you leave here, chaos will conquer me.
I do not know my mind, you fill my thoughts,
My need for you in enormous you see,
An obsession I tried to beat, but I lost.
Go on, diminich my accomplishments.
I don't care, fo I gained what I wanted.
You just don't understand that my mind is bent,
Trying to escape me, things came to a head.

When Spring comes, you will see yourself blossom,
You'll be so much happier when you succumb.


I'd appreciate comments.  Rhymed iambic pentameter isn't my strong suit, 
and I'd appreciate some constructive criticism.  :)

            CHRISTIANITY

     "Jesus said, 'Men think, perhaps, that it is peace which I have come 
     to cast upon the world.  They do not know that it is dissension which 
     I have come to cast upon the earth: fire, sword, and war.'"

                                  The Gospel of Thomas, Saying 16

One man has had more effect on 
humanity than any other
   (not Charlemagne
   not Henry
   not Shakespeare
   but Jesus Christ).
Sing the praises of
   a simple carpenter
   a common criminal
One called King of the Jews (but he wasn't),
   as he was crucified (he rose from the dead).

Wars were fought (those heathen infidels)
   in His Name (the Father).
Heretics were burned (witches and women too)
   in His Name (the Son).
Intolerance was tolerated (encouraged)
   in His Name (the Holy Ghost).

Opportunists exploit the believers
   fancy houses (gold bathroom fixtures),
   fancy women (expensive whores),
   fancy surgery (more perfect than you).
Then they beg our forgiveness and like the sheep we are (we believe we're 
                                                          sinners)
We forgive and give more (after all, they're only human not divine).


Have fun kiddies!  

BTW, that's supposed to be one line there (darned ASCII).

it has been to my experiences that poetry that which tries to force a 
certain claim on the reader rarely becomes noteworthy. although the 
romantic poets like blake, wordsworth, and coleridge certainly celebrated 
nature unlike any other poets in the english language. they didn't, of 
course, assert the value of nature in their poetry straightforwardly, you, 
as reader get the sublime feelings that they held towards the earth.

Tell me tell me fisherman
What you have to offer me
Is it fruit of infrared or planets only I can see?
By swallowing the flesh of God
Will I see the face of Hate
Or will I hear sweet sentences crushing me beneath their weight?

So now he's falling down
So now he's crying out
So now he sees just what the revolution's all about
So now he sees his mom
So now he sees his dad
So now he sees the hammer swing...it hurts so fucking bad
So now he hears the chords
The feedback in his head
So now he hangs from a two by four
The carpenter is dead.

Tell me tell me fisherman
What you have to offer me
Is it life or is it death or is it unreality?
By swallowing the blood of God
Will I see the face of hate
Or will I feel the emptiness of my everlasting wait? 

This is a song I wrote after reading a book by Terrence McKenna...
he talks about psilocybin mushrooms being a sort of psychedelic
communion...and I wrote about that concept being reconciled with
my Christian upbringing and the Communion I knew from childhood.

Through sylvan ruins he wandered
His soul was walking low;
Through woods his enemy squandered
At who he raised his bow.
'Twas two days from the battle
And heavy was his heart.
He shot through them like cattle
The trees from them to part.
They left his world in ashes
His wolf-friends they did kill.
But valued were the lashes,
For human blood did spill.

On a moonless night, when the sky is dark,

On a starry night, when the moon shines bright,
the bats and owls prepare for flight....
     All of this, in Widow's Night
     All of this, in Widow's Night..

When the wind's fierce gust blows across the land, 
     and a snowflake falls in a young boy's hand,
the bats and owls have flown away
the snow will rule on this very day.
     In Widow's Night, "Hooray Hooray!!"
     In Widow's Night, "Hooray Hooray!!"

When the leaves are green, and the flower's song,
Echos,  Echos across the land everlong.
Look here boy,  and tell me of your plea...
And look there boy, and tell me what you see...
     For at Widow's Night, we all run free
     For at Widow's Night, we all run free....

OCTOBER 31, 1991--6:28 A.M.

"Wake up! Wake up!"
"Huh? Go away, I've got two minutes."
"Something's wrong with Mum, 
the paramedics are here!"
I sit up and reach for my glasses,
all the while rubbing the sleep from my eyes.
"What are you talking about? Maybe she's 
just sick."
We wait in my room, hte blue room,
I notice all the books and papers on the floor.
The digital clock silently ticks away the minutes.
My father enters, grief on his face.
"Girls,
your mother...your mother
died
sometime last night."
I'm numb, I have no feeling, it's been
shut off.  We're told we don't have to go to school,
but I know what will happen (relatives trying to make me feel better),
so I go anyway.  Everyone says they're sorry,
such a stupid thing to do, what did they do?
Nothing.  It's my mother who should be
apologizing.

Just the night before I remember her alive
at my choir concert.  She was laughing and talking with
her friends and my friends and their moms and just everyone.
She had a good time.  She said so, just before she
went to bed and after she told me that she loved me.
For the last time. 
No one expected her to die, she was only
forty-eight.
But she did.

The first viewing was Saturday
two days later.  The family was there , supporting us,
me and my sister.
We walk in.
The casket's on the other side of the room.
With trepidation I approach and
my numbness disappears, replaced by anger and betrayal and mostly sorrow.
My mother is in the box, cold  dead  gone.
It doesn't even look like her.
She didn't do her hair like that, combed sttraight back like a
pro coach, maybe Ditka or Riley.
And the expression on her face wasn't hers, it was
George Washington with his wooden teeth.
I break down.
I begin to accept.
I live again.
She would've wanted it that way.

One year, ten months, and fifteen days.
I'm still haunted.
The memories won't fade.
I turn around, expecting to see her,
expecting to hear her voice, full of humor
with it's thick Boston accent.  I can't even remember it.
I look in her purse.  I find the concert program.
Now I can tell her.
I love you, Mum.

I woke early this morning
To the silent sounds of raindrops

I pulled the curtain to greet the morning
But a fog covered the window
Without thinking I took my finger
And wrote your name in the moisture

Now, it was time to prepare
to face another day
For some reason, jsut before leaving
I returned to the bedroom
To look once more at your name
But it too
was gone

The storm raging inside me

Just one line that will let her know
The feelings deep in my heart

you have done something really great in that poem. people call you a mam's 
mama, oops, boy if you're real close to your parents, or that there is 
something wrong with you if you think so highly of your parents, in this

    Twenty years ago, on a planet much like our own, a great mass of 
people came of age.  They looked about themselves and said, "We have a 
dream.  We dream of a world where there is no war, no famine, and no hate. 
A world where every human is our brother and sister.  A world where 
everyone can realize their potential.  A world where there is truly Heaven 
on Earth."  And suddenly they knew it was possible, and further, they new 
how to make it happen.
    So it came to pass that the Children of Utopia climbed the Great 
Mountain.  And on the Mountain they erected a great temple of both 
wondrous light and Angelic music.  They looked about and they were pleased 
with their creation.  And the Children said let us name our creation 
Woodstock.  Then the Children revelled on their Mountain.  They smoked, 
they drank, they dosed, they screwed, and they vomited.
    Many days and many nights passed, although none of the Children could 
quite remember how many.  But behold, when they awakened dazed, hungover, 
and deaf, they were perplexed.  Aside from being in dire need of a shower, 
a toothbrush and a venereal check-up, nothing had changed.  Mysteriously, 
the world had carried on in their absence.  Their drug-hazed pleas for 
justice went unheard.  The police still beat hippies and upstart 
tree-huggers, the Pentagon was still having a riotously wonderful time 
defoliating Vietnam, and their parents still thought they were wierd.
    Disgruntled, bitter and disillusioned, the Children began disbanding 
from their Mountain.  Two groups left the shrine that day.  The smaller 
group spoke thus; "Maaan, there is just waaay to many negative vibes in 
this reality.  What we need to do maaan, is go back to nature maaan.  You 
know maaan, like, live in the woods maaan.  We can eat nuts and berries 
maaan, like the indians maaan.  And go naked maaan, you dig?"  And the 
people smiled, although noone is sure if it was because of what he said or 
if it was because a cloud to his immediate right had suddenly turned plaid 
and started whistling Kumbaya.  Nevertheless, they followed him.
    The larger group awoke, and one of them said, "Oh well, we gave it our 
best shot.  Shit, my dad's going to kill me.  I've got mid-terms next 
week."  And so the larger group ran from the Shrine of Peace, with all 
their dreams of love and joy left behind along with 200,000 unrecyclable 
plastic beer cups.  Filled with bitterness, the Children sold their VWs 
for minivans, their love beads for beepers, their beliefs for the 'burbs 
and their souls for success.  And so the Sacred Hill was forgotten.

Don't ask me what the hell the point of this was.  I created it and it's 
writing.  This is a creative writing section.  So, well, there it is.  If 
it makes you laugh, pisses you off or makes you think, then it's surved 
its purpose.  Adios

Only one word,
as harmless it would seem,
could hurt more than,,
a horrible sting.

Why can't we learn
to live in peace,
for I do always yearn,
for that warm release.

We need no wars,
between father and son,
despite the manhood lore,
its just not fun.

                                                Keep the spirit,

Very nice, Maedhros.  I couldn't agree more.
However, in defense of those BMW driving suburbanites, a few of them went 
to graduate school and became college professors, and though they didn't 
quite "practice" the Woodstock ideals, they passed them on to their 
students.  I know, I've taken a few of their classes.

If i can not go the way of the warrior

hhmm..creative writing is cool...I like to write stuff sometimes. Maybe I 
should post some of it here...well, I guess I'l start with a small liitle 
rhyme I made up using songs from U2...all songs are in CAPS..

Whenever I see here I wanna shout and sing,
'cause she's EVEN BETTER THAN THE REAL THING.
Given up all thinking and contemplation
'cause my head's like a ZOO STATION

ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT MY WAY to your kindness
yes it's true that LOVE IS BLINDNESS

Let me in, can't you see my DESIRE?
It burns in me like THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE

You know you're the ONE, but you left me to play the fool.
Your MYSTERIOUS WAYS are oh so cruel

Now I'm feeling blue and lame
You left me where THE STREETS HAVE NO NAME

Now I must go knocking from door to door
'cause I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

When you're TRYIN' TO THROW YOUR ARMS AROUND THE WORLD
    sometimes push comes to shove
So maybe I'll just give up my PRIDE(IN THE NAME OF LOVE)...


      %YOU SAID NO BEFORE, THEN YOU SAID MAYBE
      %BUT YOU'LL GIVE A DEFINITE YES
      %WITH ONE LISTEN TO ACHTUNG BABY....



well, there it is. Crude, yes I know. but I wrote in a couple of hours.
anyway, let me know what you think. If you all like it, I'll post more.

on a dark summmer night,
when he came to my room..
he brought news of hate, 
he brought news of doom...

as his bony white hand,
drew the light from my haven
like the evrlasting dove,
sucked away by a raven..

he spoke to me
in a hypnotic voice
i followed his words,
i really had no choice.

"come closer my boy..
come closer and see....
i mean not to hurt you"
he spoke unto me...

"i have come for your body..
i have come for your tears...
take my hand little boy..
disregard all your fears.."

As he spoke on to me,
of wants and desires,
i found myself reaching,
for the king of alll liars.

"take my hand you fool!
come ride the wind on my back,
and the blackness of night,
i ahve the soul that you lack!"

as i listened to his call,
as i was drawn to his might,
i let him do the hearing,
for he took all my sight.

"i will love you my boy,
take a ride on the ship,
across this small river,
with a kiss on the lip.

a small price to pay,
for theses wonders i give,
for who needs a soul,
you do not need to live..."

as i sat and i wondered,
what secrets lay on the shore,
of the opposite bank,
inside the unknown door..

"i know what you think,
you fear the unknown...
but i am with you...
and i NEVER sail alone....

as i got on the boat,
i heard a whisper in my head...
i recall it all now....
"too bad you're dead"........

YOU
---

I can't believe you let me,
every day of evry year
you led me astray, and held me hand,
through all the smiles and all the tears

I trusted you
to guide my path
now i'm left alone
to feel your wrath

In a spot of secret
and a flock of lies
my body sits,
under starry skies

down in the catacomb,
and a step to the right,
for this is the place,
where i ended my flight...

How could you do it?
when it was meant to be,
You took just two..
and split them in three.

Oh..the grey inside,
and blackness of soul
where my body's a puppet,
and my eyes black as coal

Why did You?
when i trusted the serpent,
and danced with the Prince,
when you left me like that,

I haven't been the same since.....

The clouds are dark now but they were so red.
The color of a lover alone.
Not a blood red or rose,
But a blush wine shared by two.

The mountains are dark now but they were so high.
Reaching into the sky for another.
Like a lost man reaching for his lover,
And yet they stand alone.

The sky is dark now but is was so blue.
The color of calm and security I feel when I'm in your arms.
A bold blue which shows the strength and caring,
Which only you can give.

And yet, while all is dark when night falls,
    I long to be with you.
Sharing even the darkness, makes my life bright again,
    As long as I share it with you.

 A sullen place
 Barren
 Aged with careless time
 careless thought.
 A wasteland of thought 
 where idea is the only fabric rent
 And overflowal is a sudden end
 A quick escape
 A door.
 and i ?
 i am simply me.
 A number here
 a statistic
 a random blur of ones and zeros
 etched across the pathways of light and time
 across the iris of my counterparts in this maze of text
 a brief interlude to be read, skimmed or skipped
 at the touch of a key.
 All is random here
 At the crossroads.
 All is synthetic in these halls of loss and number.
 My eyes laden with cares of old, i reach out

Razor Angels

Shapes move outside in the crowd.
There is aways a crowd
I get dressed shave and wash,
and I'm out, moving in and out of the flesh.
the meat that is aways moving.
no one ever stops moving,
Makes an easy target.

Dim lights and brite neon flare out from both sides.
Same shit always, never changes, moving all the time.
no one gives a fuck, no care at all.
Always moving...
junkies
Methheads
Punks
Phreaks
Some asshole thief with fingers always moving too.

People just don't care...as long as you don't spill blood on them.
Never know when some punk wanna do you.
Never know when someone's sights are flashing across your spine.
Last thing you'll see is everyone hit the pavement,
As some stiff behind you points out the beam on your skull.

Street kids weave in and out of allys, chasing each other with razors.
Spotlights of the urban flash litter the sky.
Foot soldiers or police as they call themselves walk blind,
While some bits beat a shopkeeper who is down on his pay.

Everyones blind, deaf, and dumb, don't wanna be on a shit list.
Money,
Drugs,
Sex.
That's what runs this pit.

Everyone wants to move up.
Step on your back.
Cut you all up
Slice, Slice real quite like.
Who the fuck cares...not me.

Because if I stop to care, it will be me.
Kids move like angels thru the shadowed streets....
Glemming little razors sprayed with dried blood.
Someone who cared tried to stop them.
Someone who cared died.

SONNET 2



Curling in his flesh it engulfs him, ties

him to me.  The entrapment is complete.

Now, I can begin my work on his mind,

changing it to suit my purposes.  And

he will never know, for he is stupid,

dazzled by the beauty he sees before

him.  I laugh quietly, eyes narrowing

in anger and in sorrow--I wish I

didn't have to do this but always I

do.  It's in my nature to kill the ones

I love, they are just so much dead weight--

once they admit it, the thrill is always

gone.  Gone, gone.  I look in the silver glass,

and I break it, killing myself with it.

Thank you ever much.
I have just joined this board and am very impressed with this
message base. Most bases that I have seen that deal with poetry and
creative writing everone talks about published works and never writes 
anything themselves. all work that I see here is some of the  most
moving, deeply imagnative and inspiring work I have ever come
across. 
Thank you for letting me join in.

I Sell the Magic

I sell the magic
A little bit of your dreams
A place to go and hide

I sell the magic
i can give you anything you want
Love
Hate
Sex
Happiness

I sell the magic
The magic that'll make you immortal
The magic that'll make you fly
I sell the high

I sell the magic
No one is to small
to old
to rich
There is no social class in my mix

I sell the magic
dime bags
quarters
an once

I sell the magic
one rock
one shot
a drop
or a line

I sell the magic
For a price
You want a sample
Skip down the block
I don't loan shit here
You gotta buy

I sell the magic
Don't you forget
I make dreams happen
I sell the magic

On reading "The Second Coming"

Swirling red sands shift
across the scalded landscape,
obscuring my vision and
blinding me to the Sphinx, slowly
shifting it's slow thighs and rising 
to its lion's feet, head of man 
looking about in semi concealed 
disbelief

"Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."

Hordes of warriors
march across the land
obliterating all in sight
the bright blood of the boys
sent to fight another's war.

"The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity."

Bitterness is in my mouth
I see that the world is how it is
and nothing I do will change it.
My dreams are dead and they will never
become a phoenix in the skies 
of my mind.

Yeats was right.


Ant/Natalie  

Yeats is my favorite poet, and "The Second Coming" is my favorite poem.  I 
think it says a lot about the condition of the world today...a lot of my 
dreams won't be able to come true because of previous generations and 
those who are in power right now, and quite frankly, I'm pissed.  *grin* I 
don't know if I will be able to change things or not...I wrote this poem 
on a bad day (I write all my poetry on bad days), so I'm really not that 
pessimistic.  Really.  :)

DARK?

Why is love a maze, and a toil of darkened dream?
that twists and turns, into not what it seems

Why can't love be a flower, that blooms in the sun?
   Why is love a shadow, forever on the run? 

Why is love confusing, a dazzling web of lies,
  Why is love left stranded, to dance among the flies?

Why is love shown red, when all i see is black?
  Why is love about giving, when i never get it back?

How can love be true, forever etched in stone,
How can love be shared, when i am always so alone?

   Who can dea; with love, but the confident and strong?
Who is there to love, for my only love was wrong.

When does love attack, or sail upon the sea?
   When is love for us, and when does love choose me?

  Can love be at my side, or follow at my heel?
or how about in my pocket, for only me to feel?

Can love be the darkness, that i carry on my back?
  or maybe love's the light, that i always seem to lack.....

Time has not been kind.
I have enterred uncharted territory,
lost and alone-
with only unfamiliar stars to guide me.
I have lost sight of the heroes
and have been reduced to fading away.
Diminuendo niente.
Fade to nothing.
I wish to pick up my sword
and fight once again for glory and honor,
but my arm has grown tired,
and my soul doesn't shine so pure.
I can no longer take up arms
for my only oppressor is myself.
My battle was lost
long before I knew it was fought.
Angel of Mercy.  Angel of Death.
She gently caresses my temple,
whispers my name into my ear,
then kisses me with lips
as soft as rose... petals?

I rode west.
The motorcycle was as one with the road as I crossed the plains.
The wind is whipping through my hair.
The sun is high in the sky.
My leather jacket bakes from the heat- like the road.
Ponytail? ...nahh.
Sunglasses with no glare from the road.
Yellow lines, dashes, dashes, lines, dashes.
Lines.
I am headed for the hills for I know love can be found there.
The sun goes down.
The moon is full and my tank is empty.
Fuel- for bike and man.
I light up a cigarette and take a drag.
Image is everything.
I cough and drop the smoke; smash it with a toe.
Image is nothing.
I gun the accelerator and am off.
Gas station left in the dust, duty fulfilled.
Passing lane- don't do it, it's a trick.
Patience...
a virtue, the key, a calmness... hmmm.
Trees line the road.
I like trees.
It's getting cold.
I could stop and rest, but I won't.
Midnight.
The air is so quiet; the engine roar so pure.
I am lost in the night's embrace as the road ribbons through the hills.
I look up.
Stars... windows to heaven.
"Hi, God."

How I feel when she's near is hard to describe.
The Love that I fear I see in her eyes.
I want to go get it, yet I'm too afraid of change.
These mixed up emotions do make me feel strange.

I must have the courage to stand up and fight,
Like a stong man should, like a valiant knight.
Yet, action is not yielded from these words that I write.
Once again I am lonely, living in spite.

DREAMS

A dream come true is a fantasy fulfilled.
A dream come true is a feeling of hope
A dream come true is a feeling of joy
A dream come true is a feeling of love
A dream come true is a feeling of accomplishment
A dream come true is what makes life worth living.

Dream of money and success
Dream of traveling to some far off place
Dream of a family and a white picket fence
Dream of what makes you happy.

A dream only needs to be something that makes you happy.
A dream only needs to be a ray of hope in your life.
Dreams have a way of making the dreary look bright and the sad feel happy
It doesn't matter what the dream might be as long as its your dream.

Dreams are the part of life that we should never give up.
A dream today is a hope for tomorrow.
A dream today paves the road for the future.
Dreams are what we allow them to be.

If they are to come true then we must believe that these dreams will one
day come true.
There is no other way to live your life.
Without a dream you may have nothing.

     Manic Depression on a Full Moon

Charlotte walks in the light of the stars.
I notice her coming towards me
Out of the corner of my mind,
And I am tense.
She stops in my presence.
"How is your garden?" I ask,
Not expecting her to answer.
"Oh, fine..." she sighs, and takes a step closer.
     *Does she have a knife?*
Her long, limp hair is dragged by the breeze--
It bothers her as much as it does me.
"Why do you ask, Brother?"
She is nearer now and can read my mind.
"Because you are usually gardening when the moon is full."
But she only heard the truth:
     *Because you are crazy and I don't know what else to say.*
Her moon-white gown is limp, too,
And her bare ankles are scratched by thorns.
I know her well, and she has come
      to either hear my worldly confessions
      or to take my life.

This is the first decent sex scene I've ever written.  I'd like comments 
on it, please please please.  It would make me very happy to have comments 
for this.  

Dearest Love,
    Every night I lay here in my bed and remember the time we spent 
together.  I remember every detail.  Every kiss, every touch, every 
fervently whispered word.  ANd it seems so odd that I had never thought of 
you or myself in such a way before.  I was beautiful that day, you made me 
beautiful.  I will remember that.
    You walked up to me in the park, and sat down.  I was reading a book.  
You took the book from me and looked into my eyes.  We had met before, but 
never quite like this.  There was an attraction between us that I had 
never felt before.  You looked around, to see if anyone was looking.  I 
didn't know why you cared who saw.  I do now.  But then, I didn't think.  
All I knew was that you were kissing me, and I was kissing you back.  Then 
your hands were touching my arms, moving up to my shoulders and around to 
my back.  I reached up and twisted my hand in your long dark hair.  It was 
like silk in my hand, slippery and smooth and soft.  YOu pulled me to and 
I lost my balance and fell on top of you.  The feel of your body and your 
arousal on me made me feel...I don't have the words.  You rolled me 
beneath you and I was even more excited to feel your skin on mine.  I 
tugged at your dark shirt and put my hands on your back.  Your skin was 
warm to my touch, I could feel the muscles moving under my fingers.  Your 
hands moved to my hair, holding me to you.  I wanted to stay this way 
forever.  Then, when I didn't think it could get any better, one of your 
hands caressed my cheek and landed on my shoulder.  Then you were pulling 
at my shirt, and I heard a noise deep in your throat as your hand snuck up 
the back of my shirt and touched my skin.  I felt my heart begin to beat 
faster as your hand slowly, too slowly, unhooked my bra.  I wanted you to 
touch my breasts.  I wanted to feel beautiful.  I wanted you to think I 
was beautiful.  I wanted to be beautiful.  Your rough gentle hand 
deliberately caressed my breast.  I could feel the tension in you, as you 
tried to go slowly.  But I didn't want you to be slow or careful or to 
think about what you were doing.  I justwanted to feel everything I could 
feel; that I had ever dreamt about feeling.  You paused for a moment and 
took your shirt off.  I looked at you.  You were beautiful, more beautiful 
than I had imagined.  You leaned back and pulled my shirt off.  I blushed. 
 You told me not to be embarassed, no one could see us.  We were 
surrounded by bushes and trees.  I wondered how you knew I was here.  You 
told me you knew such things.  Then you kissed me again.  And both your 
rough gentle hands held me down and slowly touched me.  I dug my nails 
into your back and I heard you moan.  Then you were unfastening my jeans.  
And I was fumbling with your belt.  You peeled my jeans off my legs, I 
felt the sun on my thighs.  I wasn't wearing any underwear.  You laughed 
when you discovered that.  I blushed.  You touched my cheek, my lips, my 
nipples.  I slowly pulled your pants off, then looked away.  I didn't want 
to see it.  I had a phobia.  I whispered it to you, you sais you 
understood.  But I still wanted you, and I told you that too.  You smiled 
a secret smile at me.  I shyly smiled back.  Then, you were pulling my 
legs apart, and you looked at me.  I slowly slowly slowly nodded.  Then I 
couldn't think anymore.  All I knew was that I didn't want you to stop but 
I didn't think I could survive much more.  As I thought I was going to 
die, I felt you in me.  You shifted your weight on top of me.  I gasped.  
I moved my hips, feeling you grind into me, and then I couldn't feel 
anymore.  I was in sensory overload.  You collapsed on top of me.  I 
breathed in and out.  I was sweating.  Your weight was comfortable on top 
of me.  Then, you stood up and yanked your pants up.  Bending over, you 
kissed me one last time as you picked your shirt up.  Then you left me.
    I haven't seen you sincethen, I've looked everywhere.  But you 
disappeared.  No one has seen you.  I sometimes wonder if you were just a 
figment of my imagination.  Yes, I think that is it, I made you up.  You 
exist on the other side from me.  You are waiting for me on that
other side.  I know you are.  I see you in my dreams, beckoning, kissing, 
loving me.  I want to be with you.  Which is why I make this decision.  
Better to be with you and be happy than to be in this world and be no one. 
You made me think I was someone, then you disappeared.  I hate you for 
that, but I want to believe that again.  So I make this choice.  You can't 
fault me for this choice no more than I can fault you for you choice to 
stay away from this world.  
    For I know that I am more than half in love with easeful Death, and I 
know he is in love with me........

I guess that it depends.  If this is a romantic scene *like I 
_think_ you were trying* then beautiful was just fine, if it were more
towards the sex thing the words erotic and *I know a cliche* sexy might
have worked better.  Kirkland *who is on very little*  has actually 
written a book with poetry and prose *I am in it too :) * maybe he might
want to respond.  I'll let him know.

When the houses creak,
    and the windows turn, 
the clouds run dark,
    and the shadows burn.

While on yonder moon,
    the hearts will yearn..
 
The stars shine bright,
      on reflecting lake,
as the sun creeps up,
      on the river's wake.

As the birds sing free,
  the dawn does break.

The wolves of morn,
        lick their lips on her thigh,
and the bats watch intently,
        as her body floats by..

So naked and free..
  The trees start to cry..

    As a young child, he sat, in the dark, in a room, with a solitary 
candle. The shadows dance with temptation as they silently whisper evil 
thoughts. The evil thoughts grab hold, and rip open the heart of the child 
and begin to swallow his entire being, his SOUL. The LOVE turned to HATE, 
the JOY to DESPAIR, the beauty to none, and his true love to his fatal 
enemy. The child is depressed and truely alone. Not a soul who cares, not 
a soul who dares....to touch him. His face draws down and a devilish smile 
is seen on his lips, dripping scarlet obsession, in a frenzy of madness. 
The fire's of Hell are burning in his soul, and escaping through portals 
known as eyes. Eyes black as coal and cold as ice. He has lost his love, 
or so he thought. The demons have ripped out his will to love, and with 
that, his feeling of love. She was innocent, She was beautiful, but most 
important, she was one of THEM, just as evil has the child has become. She 
loved, but disguised it, She cared, but denied it. She was the demon who 
carved the hole in the child's heart. A gateway for evil, a door for the 
insane. Evil pulsing through his body, and collecting in his brain....

When  a blade of steel,
slices down through the air,
the knife cannot feel,
the knife does not care..

When a soul is set free,
to roam as they please,
a person begs for their life,
oh..begs on their knees..

As i sit down to write,
a scream hits my ears,
to echo beliefs,
and confirm all my fears.

As i lay down
On the darkest of nights,

the neon catches for a moment in your eye

alterations kill the soul in their subtlety
though you can't begin to know

life has escaped you for a moment
you are the walking dead
shambling about, risen from the earth
your rotten teeth gnaw at ties once held sacred
in death's shadow
you have chosen the role of the stranger
yes, i suppose you have escaped,
turning your back on oblivion
(but also on me).
bask well in your Pride
now drunk and swolen.
marks once hidden become points of pride
bits of discolored vanity.

Date: Wed Apr 13 15:52:34 1994

(Hellion lies...I'm practiaclly a virgin.  NOT!)

Oh, well, since he put me up to it...
   One of the hardest images to convey is the emotion of sex.
I used to think it was just an act, but once you think of it as a feeling
you can begin to explain it-- not just experience the physical sense.
You can bring up memories in other people, shared experiences, fond
remembrances, etc.  Sure, everyone wants to read a "good fuck scene", but
there's more to it than that.  You need to drag their feelings and
emotions into the story, not just their loins and hormones.
   There are three types of sex stories: 1) The professional writer's,
 2) The amatuer's and 3) The pornographic.
 They all work, but in different ways.
    The pornographic is designed to get you all hot and sweaty, sporting 
wood
if you're male, breathy if you're female.  That's what it's all about.
It's primal, it's dirty, it's nasty.  It's what we all want to do once
(and some all the time), but it's meant to make your body react, with just
a little imagination because it leaves little to your imagination.
   The professional writers have been writing about sex since they knew
what their thingies did.  They have written about sex so many times and in
so many ways it comes naturally.  Personally, you can only read so many
Harlequins (which I don't read-- I'm male) before the sex scenes are just
one more scene in the book.  I think the overuse, the flowery words, have
just lost their glamor.  It works time and time again, but their version
of a sex scene doesn't have you breathing all that heavy.
   Then there's the amatuer.  Everyone else fits in this group.  You fall
into the good amatuer group because your story doegive a certain sense of 
urgency.  Longer sentences add to the dreaminess.
You have the "correct" progression of moves.  You have good details
throughout.  You give your thoughts.  You give your emotions-- and that is
why it works.
   You can write a hundred sex stories and none of them would be as good 
as
this one because it was your first.  (Kinda like sex-- you will always
remember your first time).  It's stilted, it's direct, it tells what you
felt.  If it flowed it would be bullshit.  You think that you need points
on how to make it better?  Read it again, and this time let yourself
experience the same emotions you're trying to evoke in others.  Don't look
at it as "what I wrote" but as "what I experienced".  It might be better
than you thought.
   No, you used beautiful about as much as you'd want to, you're still
okay.  You write quite well and have a good future in it.  (I know--
critique me, tell me what I should change, not what I do right.)
The only thing I can suggest is that you don't change it too much.
I was once told that to write a really good story one had to write it 
twice
and put the best of both together to form the best version.  This would
kill the innocence of the story.  It works because it is so personal.  If 
this
is what it takes to be an amatuer, there's nothing wrong with being an
amatuer.  Hell, I enjoy being one.  Professional or not, you did a fine 
job.

Thanks a  lot...that scene was *very* difficult for me to write.  I've 
read one too many romance novel (*blush*) to be comfortable using the 
kinds of words they use.  So I had to find words I *could* use.  That was 
the most difficult part.  Finding the correct words...  I think that's the 
hardest part about writing anything, finding the words.  For me anyhow.  I 
can know exactly what will happen, but I won't know how to put it on 
screen in the right way (I write on the computer, I can't use paper), the 
way that will convey what I want the reader to feel.  So I often get 
bogged down in revisions (which I hate doing), or the story slowly dies on 
me.  This was the first thing I had finished in a month or so...  I don't 
know about the words though, there's some words I can use, there's some I 
can't...I have sworn to *never* use the word thrrobbing in any kind of 
serious context.  Or heaving.  I just can't.  The words have to speak to 
me somehow before I can arrange them, rearrange them.  When I start 
writing, and I can feel the words, and I can arrange them in the right 
way, I get the most incredible high...do you know what I'm trying to 
explain here?  Well, anyhow, that's my two cents on the matter :)

Subject: A Summer Rain
Date: Wed Apr 13 16:46:28 1994

It had been a mercilessly long and hot day with the approaching cold front 
finally pushing its way through the humid air, bringing a much awaited 
thunderstorm.  The rain would begin with a quick downpour, then a steady 
shower to last through the night.  The first drops are felt just a few 
miles to the west of here, but the rain has yet to hit...
    I grabbed at her tight little butt with both hands and squeezed double 
handfuls of her ass.  She let loose a purely sexual squeak and pounced on 
me, driving her fingernails into my back and shoving her tongue through my 
open lips.  I tossed her on the hood of my car and she started to purr 
like a content cat after a hard day's work.  Thunder rolled in the 
distance and it was cooling off just fast enough for her to have 
goosebumps all over her body.
    A hand upon my crotch and a look of longing drove me to that low 
neckline.  Her tanktop bit the dust and she casually took off her bra in 
plain view.  She knew that the line of careful playfulness had just been 
crossed.  She wanted me in her so bad that I knew tonight would be the 
night.
    I reached down to unbutton her shorts, not quite expecting to find 
that she had beaten me to it.  I pulled her panties down to herankles with 
one finger, making her giggle from the tickle of silk.  She shoved her 
crotch into my face and I took to her like a desert bandit to water.  I 
let my tongue go wild as it caressed and slid across everything that 
causes pleasure.  The tingle and the tongue sent shockwaves through her 
body, and the grasp at the back of my head told me that she was ready.
    Her hands slid across my chest, then she leaned forward to suck on me 
just a little.  She licked up the side of my neck, then threw her body 
next to mine as she kissed me and tugged at my jeans.  My Levis took 
residence at my ankles and I kicked to take them off, succeeding only in 
tripping myself and pulling us both to the ground.  She took one look at 
my rubber duckie boxer shorts and couldn't resist a laugh, then she pulled 
them off and whistled, ""Qu-ack!" at my throbbing, well, y'know, dick.
    I rolled her onto her back and pulled her panties off of her the rest 
of the way as slowly as I could to show her that I wanted to so bad yet 
wasn't going to rush her first time.  She grabbed at little Eddie (that's 
my dick, in case you're wondering) and pulled him up to meet her wet 
pussy.  The Edster slid right in and she looked like she was going to 
implode it felt so good and so different and so big and so deep into her.  
I started slowly rocking back and forth on her until she raised up her 
legs enough to give it the full effect.  I pushed it up to full throttle 
and let her have it as I sent my shot of love deep into her.  She sent 
back a wave of juices as she had her first orgasm, almost ripping my head 
off in the process.
    Then it rained, I pulled out, and we went home.  She moved away that 
summer and I never saw her again.  I must admit, she was a fun fuck and 
(surprise, surprise)-- I did love her...

June 25, 1992. (A little old)

I know, it gets a little nasty in parts, but it was the one sex story (of 
my three) that had the word throbbing in it (sorry Natalie).
I'll post something from the SODa Can to make up for it,

Date: Thu Apr 14 11:00:59 1994

I first met this sweetheart in my childhood.
She was the cutest girl I had ever seen.
I thought she was going to last forever.
I don't understand why guys can be so mean.

I called her a friend, and sometimes she was more.
Why this shy girl fell from grace no one knows for sure.
During the day Sheila was her given name,
but at night the guys had other names for her.

I remember back in kindergarten,
when she asked me if I would be her boyfriend.
I later found out I was her fourth that day-
it didn't matter.  I just didn't want it to end.

I saw her walking down the street a few years back.
I caught myself thinking about what could have been.
She winked at me and said it would never last.
But that never meant it couldn't happen.

Our high school years came and went in a blur.
Sheila spent all her nights out on the town.
She flirted and she cooed, laughing at every pass.
If she liked what she saw, she just might go down.

I remember those nights she ran to my arms;
crying from the pain- not so tough on the inside.
She acted like a tramp and lost out in her games.
Wasted youth withered behind a mask of pride.

Never before and never since have I heard the cry of a horny angel.
Yet every time I made love to her it was only in my dreams.
I awoke with visions of her lips just a breath away-
her mussed up hair and lace underwear falling apart at the seams.

She was always smiling, and sure she always laughed.
I suppose the life of the party agrees with living in sin.
Why she always went back for more I'll never know.
But they always took her and used her and left her again.

I got a letter the other day and out poured her life.
Sheila wrote of boys and men, hopes and a broken heart.
I wished for her a happy ending after all her pain.
I'll never know where she went, our worlds grew too far apart...

A ray of sun gives warmth to my heart

Hmmmm. That's a tough question....some of the best writers, most of the 
best writers, and esp. my favorites, were moody, depressed and 
psychologically messed up people-like Poe and Eliot...many writers 
produced some of their best stuff when "under the influence" like Poe and 
Coleridge and Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland may have been shroom 
induced, but I still love it. :) ) Me myself, I write stuff when I'm 
depressed to bring myself out of it. At the same time, when I'm really 
happy about something, I write then too. I write when I find myself at 
ANY emotional peak. I find that expressing what 
I'm feeling about ANYthing creatively and getting it down on paper, or 
through music really helps. So maybe that's what everyone else is doing 
whn they write...and maybe that's why the best stuff people sometimes 
produce is when their feeling some sort of strong emotion (be it 
depression, anger,love (gack) :) etc.)-when people 
are feeling something, then they're more alive, their senses are more 
awake, and of course they're going to write better stuff. 

 Anyway...these ramblings are my opinion on the matter. Interesting query 
Deask. *smile* I liked it. :)

Date: Fri Apr 15 12:57:14 1994

This little beast was written last fall and is sort of a remembrance
of those wonderful(?) high school years.

     Scorn not the beautiful people,
     for though their lives may appear to be shallow,
     they are also rich in pain...

Mr. Popularity.. Mr. Class Clown.
Has a way of making you smile when you're down.
He makes everyone happy and knows he can.
But he cries because girls find him funny, never serious,
and he dies of an overdose- a lonely man.

     Musclebound Weightlifter.  Bigger-than-life sized.
     Flexin'     Down     What a way to live.
     His steroid test just came back positive.

Jockmeister.  Team Leader.
No one can stop him when the heat is on.
Went through high school with a football helmet on.
Now his knee is blown out
and his academics lie in a paralyzed fit.
He found out that every door that says "Enter"
  on the other side says "Exit".

     Cheerleader.  Not just another pretty face.
     Wears her skirt short just to make the guys drool.
     And everyone knows that she's the pride of the school.
     Too bad the quarterback did more than score.
     Now she's pregnant, alone, and the school's disgrace.
     She's just a winner that lost her biological race.


Now it can't be said that tragedy
     rules everyone's life-
but a life of popularity
     is a life of strife.
The life of the beautiful ones is longed for
     by every social outcast,
trying hard to make their mark today,
     not just be a figment in someone else's past.
Some friendships run shallow
     instead of running deep,
and with college one step away
     sometimes friends don't always keep.
Sociality- what hell could be worse?
     One man's paradise.
     Another man's curse.

(It fits with a rap rhythm I have in the back of my head, so I hope
you didn't read it too slowly.)

Well, "Orion*" or should I say [Hellion with a new name to make it look
like a different user], I don't think that the word "fantasies" is very
appropriate.  I think nightmare fits the topic a little better, you forget
I watched what happened.  And I was there when the shit went down (and
seem to remember getting blamed for it).  This is no more a fantasy than
Message #98, where you were swept up in the moment and wrote the poem
about Chandra.  You are right, though, in saying that this should have
been in email, but you made the first stab with what I guess was your
mis-informed view of what happened.  Sux2BU.  She should have dumped you
before things went sour and you got greedy and rough in the sexual arena.
Oh, well, good-bye to old friends.  Sorry, but it had to be done.

where the secrets fall
and the answers lie

look..look up, my brightened son
Climb up trees,
and through grass you run..

Forget not..my son..the power of stars
as you gaze up high,
along the valley of mars..

Sleep well..sleep well...under starry skies
Let yuor thoughts run away..
as you close shut your eyes...

Live long....live long..over many a day..
at the end you'll remember..
the role the stars did play...

*hopr ypou liked it..it was spontaneous (like about two minutes ago.)*

                      Blinded by the Light

I've been told my reality is not reality.  I stare out over the endless
nothing before me.  I strain to see, but the sun is just too bright.
I stand before my maker, the edge wanting to give way.  I stand at the edge
of the cliff and ponder my destiny.  I stand and recall all of my realitys
that never came true.  (Real dreams?)  I realize that this one will be taken
from me too.  A voice from nowhere said- MBZ - do you care to test that
theory.  It was AK!  I looked with a blank expression.  Here comes your
answer!  With no fear I look to him and jump because I have reason to beleive
that the ground is really there.  Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling,
falling, falling, ........................faster every second I fall....

Just as I thought!  Now somone is pissing in my chereos again!  I'll fix- um
this time.  Instead of pissing in their chereos so both of ours taste like
piss, I will just take their cheroes, and feed them their own piss............
........................................................................yep--
that's it!  (Feeding is cool--Beavis).  Whoever said don't get mad get even?
They were as foolish as I have been.

I recall my many stuggles, think of friends past.  Why do you treat me this
way?  Are you not the person I called my friend?  Am I not the person that
was there for you?  This should be!  My reality fled into the light, and
escaped me once again.  With hurt feeling, and many tricks up my sleeve, I
decide to end my search before I go blind.

    I come in search of new friends now, but it is only a scare.  Someone will
just take my reality away.   The ground, like my lost friends, just won't be 
there.

Catch me, I am falling.  And to my friends past- Sleep with one eye open.

I can imagine your looks,
by the way of your voice,
as it whispers "i love you"
everynight before i sleep.
For then i am not blind..
for then i can see..
but i am also not very lucky,
for i only dream once in a while
When i wake up, your voice is gone..
you are gone,
and i'm sure if you checked,
a piece of my heart will be gone too..
My heart is only blind to love,
which makes you "true love"
Therefore i will give my sight to you
Tonight when i sleep,
i pray that i dream,
for all i have is that image of you
the piece of my heart was worth it,
for that moment that i saw your face.
Irecall running my fingers through your hair...
then being jolted awake..
and crying myself to sleep...
one last time.....

Some might say,
 that eyes are portals to the soul.
Ithink my eyes,
reflect the pain that's taken toll.

Some say that eyes,
hold the secrets of themselves,
I'd say my eyes are piercing,
and hold the mytery that i delve.

Some say eyes,
Are the key that unlocks the being.
My eyes say "i love you"
but..hey....they're only for seeing.

Some say eyes,
are cold as winter snow,
Your eyes scream "stop"
while mine scream "go"

Some say eyes,
are like an everlasting kiss,
My eyes know when you leave,
they know the love thats missed...

take one look in my eyes.
Do you do it on purpose?
i really don't know
If you're not going to love me..
Then why not let go?
It's not as often,
as it was before..
But it hurts me now,
and will hurt me more!

A faint little ring,
you couldn't have known..
go ahead, I Love you,

When time is frozen
it's cold as ice
it moves real slow,

When love is time,

  always tempting,

When love is frozen,

Certainly we must walk on some sort of fault line. 
Indeed our safety is tenuous. Mortality defines us,

A magnificent motel
*a good friend's house*
She was loud with pleasuer
*she was quiet as a mouse*

I held you all night, in my arms
*she left right away*
Our souls had mended strongly
*our hearts drifted apart*

I once was a man, innocent and young
Feeling free from life's woes
I once was a man who didn't judge
I took every person for who they were

I met you, my best friend
You taught me about the world
I met you, my teacher
I labeled people and put them in boxes

I once was a man who belived in God
I went to church, never questioned
I once was a man of faith
On my way to heaven

I met you, my new God
You said you were my Jesus, the Devil's son
I met you, my end of hope
Now there is no heaven or hell, just eternal blackness

I once was a man who knew right from wrong
I knew my values I was never confused
I once was a man without any hatred
I never would fight, sweet words would fix it all

I met you my phase inverter
Right became wrong, all else was right
I met you, Pushing Me Down
I wouldn't fight, You Made Me Yell

I once was a man without desires
Sex was a thing saved for my wife
I once was a man who cared for my neighbor
Every man would die when it was time

I met you, the flame of the fires
You Pushed Me Into Her, Pain In My Heart
I met you, the black man of hate
You Held My Arm Steady, While My Blade Slit Her Neck

I once was a man who cared for himself
Never would I try to hurt myself
I once was a man who was scared of death
I spent my time praying for life

I met you, my ignorant master
You Held My Arms As You Slit My Wrists
I met you, A man without humor
YOU LAUGHED AS I BLED TO DEATH...

I never saw the writing on the wall
'cause you backed me up to it.

You finally blew it.
A gun in one hand and a clip in the other,
joined together make me one bad mother.
The gun trembles as I contemplate future sins.
Good-bye Heaven.  Here's where Hell begins...

Scintilating sapient eyes of the night
Encourage me to follow the path not trodden
Pass amongst barriers-- dewed grass, chaotic thatches

This canine creature of the moon leads
Tempting indications of liberty living-- uncommited
                                         not condemned
Run wild into the fields of dawn
Escape the scent of men
Blushing sky as the night is rolled back for a day
Sip of the Earth's tap at any nearby stream
Trek across terain in any direction chosen
                                   or desired
Recollect the dream-- noisy cubes of light
Humans in social form passing
I have awakened to recess the sapient to rid of conformity
I pursue on, nothing in my way
           alone.

Everything is falling apart
all around me, in my heart
Is my sky falling down?
I need to get out of this town.

My grades are slipping
my mind is flipping
my concentration is leaving
my class professors seathing

What am I to do?
I'm without you
my life's obsession
my worst depression

Three more weeks to go
all the things I have to know
while my brain is exploding
my heart is imploding

Help me I'm falling
it is you I am calling
my life is slipping away
let me know today

My friend are you true?
are you depressed too?
all the pressure, all the stress
this is the time to be my best?

Sleepless nights
endless fights
God help me I'm losing
the one I've been choosing

She's slipping away
but trying to stay
do I marry?
or do I bury?

My heart's afire
with wild desire
my classes are demanding
please try to be understanding

Forgive me for my faults dear
I don't know what I'm doing here
I come to you
when I feel blue

School will soon end
I'll say goodbye to all my friends
and spend my summer in your arms
*with your love and all your charms*

           Chapter ??:  A Third Person Perspective
The SODa Can - [ The Final Chapter or The Last Swallow ]

  "If only for a moment, hold on to the dreams that we had."
               - Winger (Miles Away)

 "She stares at the sky, wondering why the night isn't
   telling her, 'believe him'.
  If he could only read to her the pages of his heart,
      she could see they feel the same."
               - Winger (Under One Condition)

     The summer had passed quickly for these two young 
friends who where fast becoming more than friends.  She was 
eighteen and he had turned nineteen two months prior.  She 
was in the blossom of youth, he at the crossroads of 
adulthood.  They were both ready for this night, their last 
night together, for the next week brought on their 
departures for different colleges.  Emotions and 
expectations had been building for these last few months, as 
feelings were expressed and secrets were shared- bonding 
their lives through shared experiences.
     The clock chimed nine o'clock and they decided that it 
was time to leave her house.  After a short drive to town in 
which small talk was the topic of discussion, the couple 
stopped at the local quick stop, Mr. B's, for a six-pack of 
Dew and a tank of gas.
     The couple continued to cruise Bloomfield for the next 
two hours, occasionally stopping to talk with other people 
out cruising and friends that were on their way to the dance 
in Hartington.  The talk revolved around high school- the 
normal gossip of nazi teachers and current dating liaisons.  
The midnight hour approached and he suggested that they go 
to the Edge of Heaven, a drinking party location nowadays, 
but back then it was peaceful on the weekends and provided 
more than enough couples the privacy to become lovers.
     She agreed.
     The Edge of Heaven provided a stunning view of about a 
hundred square miles of Nebraska.  Hiding off from a minimum 
maintenance road that epitomized the word minimum, it also 
offered a sense of perspective.  The lights seemed so far 
off, yet the one you were with was right there next to you.  
With this in mind the couple, now standing quite close 
together, turned to one another and kissed.
     He walked to the trunk of the car and returned with a 
blanket.  Together, they laid the blanket out on the freshly 
cut hay stalks.  The tiny stalks gave way at the slightest 
push, relinquishing a padded place of rest once they had sat 
down.  They kissed once more, this time longer and more 
passionately than the last.  His hands caressed her hair as 
they stared into each other's eyes.
     "I love you,"  he whispered.
     "I love you, too," she whispered back.
     He began to massage the back of  her neck and they 
continued kissing.  She laid down on the blanket and he laid 
next to her.  He wrapped his arms around her and held her 
tight as they drifted off into sleep...

     She awoke six hours later to a sun that had already 
taken well into the sky.  He was still lying next to her, 
but was awake and had been for most of the night.
     "You didn't...," she looked down and saw that nothing 
had changed.  "We didn't...?" she said as she rolled over 
towards him.
     "Of course not," he replied.  "I didn't want to wake 
you or take advantage of you, I just wanted to wake up with 
you in my arms, knowing that you love me as much as I love 
you."
     She began to cry and threw her arms around him.  She 
had never before found someone who cared so much for her and 
her feelings.  They held each other and kissed until she 
decided that coming home at noon wouldn't go over very well 
with her parents.
     He picked the blanket up off the ground and tossed it 
back into the trunk.  They took in one last view and left 
the Edge of Heaven as they had come, as close friends.  This 
night had taught him that sometimes love is looking out for 
the other instead of yourself, and she had learned how to 
trust again.

     This was their last night together, and as that summer 
faded into memories, their paths etched out into separate 
ways.  Even though they had their chance at becoming lovers, 
they remained friends.

And it is up to you to believe that it was better that way.

"Who knows why butterflies fly, yet caterpillars seem so damn dumb."

The following is "Into Me", one of my insane ramblings...

     Then in the mourning came the reign.  A kazoo that blue and a friend 
of few, I awoke to your eyes and questioned your lies.  For some I ask 
not, for I know of your pogo, but I can question your desires, for your 
fly is not the only thing that is down.
     A caress of your mind leads to your toil as I supplant the voices 
that recommend your turmoil.  I push away doubt as I plunder your desires; 
I steal away your heart and fill it with what transpires.  You squeal at 
the feel and trip at the nana's wrath, flailing like hell on a once golden 
path.  The threads of time have tangled once again, bringing you to a halt 
in the wallowings of sin.
     Displaced in this world of blistering hate, I ask once again,
  "Do you think it's too late?"
     A swim in Quiddity, euphoric as a time in the womb, I ask once again,
        "Do you think this is my tomb?"
     Your vices are numerous-- your vices shove toothpicks beneath my 
tender skin.  You laugh, you're in heat.  You win and I'm beat.  But as 
the quicksands of your own dreams begin to pull you under, your 
nightmarish hells push you deep
     Into Me.

----And if you thought that was whackeded, try this one: ("watching")

     Sleep.
     As consciousness wanes, my will reigns on this shell of dust you call 
your body.  Your mind in its toil slips deep into my soul as your thoughts 
wink out in flights of fancy, soaring high into your dreams and out into 
the night.  Errogenous lies and carnal ties never succeed in binding {mind 
and body} or {thoughts and flesh}.  Your mind is my playground, your 
body-- my toy.  I ask you now, isn't saying "no" just a ploy?
     Can you shrug off my charm with a bat of your eyes?  Can you push me 
away, knowing I have been inside?  Can you say you don't [want to] after 
just getting a glimpse?  Can you say you don't [need to] after feeling my 
kiss?
     With a wave of a wand in a wash of thoughts long gone, thinking 
becomes the unreality that it really is.  How can you say that it scares 
you when it is all that you want to do.  You want to surrender, but you've 
only been taught to fight.  You look at me, and I into you.  You want to 
see me, I want you too.
     I started Pushing.
     Thoughts collide in a jumbled mess as I swim into your mind.  Wafting 
serenely into your emotions held so tight, so guarded, so feared, so 
easily haunting to those I hold dear.  You seek the hand to guide you and 
the grip to keep you.  I provide the foundation for your towering dreams, 
never shifting to let you loose at the seams.  Ahh, sweet sanity... my 
friend, my fuck, my knock upon the door that leads deeper down, into you, 
into me-- separated by only a span of air and preconceived notions.
     Letting loose you fall to my side; I'd lift you up, but you're my 
ride.  Together we climb, together we climb, together we reach that top, 
but never stop climbing.
     The night hides what what I feel, but the night always turns to day, 
and from you I hide only your fears and your foes, knowing they hurt you.  
I stand alert, guarding your innocent smile, watching.  watching.


--So whaddaya think?  Any comments would help with my counseling sessions.

I prepared for this on a fly speck on my chin in a town north of the city 
traveling south towards hell or atleastasubtle form of this
 otherwise aformentioned entity in a used car on a rainy day it was my 
first time with a dark cloud overwatching the whole damn thing in ten 
years that I thought back to that awful day when I was eight and i sat by 
the pool to young to think as I did and for the first time with  a clear 
feminine sky hovering closely over me it teased my desire with a single 
thought and sent the rest of the automabilic days of mine under the sun as 
Solominsaid:
"Vanity, vanity...(and the meaningless rest)!"

and for my awful revelation, God sent:"What are you going to do 
forever...forever...forever?"  
Since then I am frantic

Feedback is invited regardless of content. I tried to keep it as close to 
the original form as possible, but i can't gaurantee that i remember it 
exactly. Here it goes:

Icharus
Dead. 
Who once was a waxwork kite 
(Melting under the sun as we all do in a much subtler way)
Against the sun
And for a moment it was pictureperfect
Forever immune to the turning of the earth

The mind is only full of hate,
while the brain is decended,
the body thinks of fate..

The body has been mended..
the soul is ashen grey..
The body yet defended..

As i think of what to say...
i wonder what to do,
and how i'm gonna pay

for what i did to you.
i doubted your heart,
i knew not what to do..

For the times we are apart
are blamed entirely on me,
for my attitude is tart...

If you could only see..
My heart was meant for you,
no matter how i be..

There's nothing you can do,

When anger gets the best of me..

I never claimed to be a poet, but I occasionally write poems...

Retrospect          11-30-93     11:04.59 P.M.
Times seem to be catching up with me.
A waltz down memory lane, a slow dance with the devil himself.
Fate?  Cruel design or happenstance?
I see the edge of the cliff, and it's calling to me.

The old times rise to the fore.
I find myself listening to the music from so long ago,
back from when I was young, innocent, so vulnerable.
And this road is one I don't want to be on.

I find myself strolling past the old haunts,
a pale husk of a man is all that remains of the boy I once was.
It wasn't my house, nor hers for that matter.
They tore it down, I guess it was some time ago.

The fresh air of spring.
Young and in love.
She smiled and we talked.
I took her to bed.

Three, no, almost four years ago.
Why can't I just let it go?
It wasn't meant to be.
Why the hell should it last?

For every chain I cast aside two take its place.
Oh, how they drag on me.
I am repulsed by their implications,
yet I still find myself welcoming them to my flesh.

Looking back, my mind starts to fill in the words
and echoes back to me d..a..t...  r..a..p...
Two E's lost at the ends-
just like her and I, lost, at this end.

"You little wimp," I cry to the night,
"you can't even say it, can you?"
I stumble back to the past-
I know it so well from these unwelcomed visits.

I'm suddenly lost in a sea of sorrow.
She didn't say yes, but she didn't say no.
That made it all right at the time.
But now it makes no sense.

I shove the dagger into my belly, yet feel no pain.
I look down and find no blood, just another masquerade.
Why can't this pain ever end?
Why must I relive it again and again?

The way I felt that night is hard to descibe.
I felt young, in control, and a little wild.
I'd waited for a while, and just wanted some more.
I never knew what pain I'd cause by closing that door.

I sometimes wish I could have my friend's getaways from life,
consuming booze, losing myself in the intrigue of flames-
but my sin is the one sin I can never live down.
I lost my innocence and my morals when my guard was down.

This creature within me called "desire" lies shamed.
So much for chivalry, I guess it's out the door.
She said she loved me, even after what I did.
Looking back I now see why we lasted just a few months more.

I'll get over it.  (liar!)
It really didn't mean that much.  (how could you!)
She's probably forgotten it.  (you bastard!)
Did it matter anyway?  (Damn you!)
Damn you!
No big deal.
Damn you.
Damn you.

Damn you.

- - - - - - - - - -
Ahh, well... It sux to be young and stupid, and it's even worse to be old 
and regretful...
This is just one view of that night, I guess you'd have to ask her to find 
out what really happened...

A crystaline shape
of perfect form
slowly carresses.
It travels a path
of lonlieness.
By the mountain
and over the plain
it goes. Soon it 
cames to an edge,
where it hovers,
quivering, then 
plunging to its
DOOM.  Who shall 
miss this shape
of pure beauty?
None, for more
shall follow.

Well, since everyone has been posting some very beautiful but very sombre 
poetry, I though I would post something a bit more lighthearted. 

      The cute little pink bunnies skip gleefully through the garden.
      They are joined by the cute purple teddy bears.
      And the darling wittle birdies.
      Tripping hither tripping thither through the happy little garden of 
      Life.
      The sun is shining over head, the wittle birdies are twittering 
      away
      Happy little songs about how happy they are in this cutsie oootsie 
      wittle world.
      The bunnies roll around in the grass.....
      They are joined by more cute bunnies (the result of the 
                        aforementioned romp in 
                    the grass...gotta love those bunnies)
      @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ 
      (see the cute little cotton tails of all the adorable little bunnies?)
      The teddy bears blow puffs of dandelions all over this joyful 
             little garden.

      Little did they know that the dandelion seeds had been tampered 
      with by Mother Nature, who was on PMS and couldn't deal with all this 
      damn cuteness. 
      The dandelions grow rapidly as weeds always do.
      Here a dandy there a dandy everywhere a dandy dandy............
      They strangle the teddy bears.
          They stifle the song of the ittle wittle birdies.
               They suck the will to live from the mutilplying bunnies.
                     
      Mother Nature, feeling much better having taken her aggressions 
      out on this sticky sweet little world, looks on the remains of the 
       garden of Life, smiles to herself, takes two advil, and goes to 
          bed to 
            sleep 
               till 
          menopause kicks in.

a poem on your rage toward my post?????? now that would have been good 
poetry....  but alas..no, the wandering, and ever so drunk poet, yearns 
for feeling, and response, and a shoulder to hold on to when falling... 
yes falling down torawds the deep pits of the netherworld....screaming as 
they fell...cursing as they fell...yet never reaching out to the hand of 
god...ever steady, ever present, ever ready....to hold on and never let 
go...Treefrog continues his search...continues his fall...and continues to 
scream and reach...at the same time..yet opposite seconds..

Hey guys, how are you all doing?
I really need your help.  I'm dating this really incredible guy who treats

to tell him.  I thought a little message would be nice.
Can you guys tell me exactly what you think on this?

Everytime...
Everytime I close my eyes the image of your face appears
Everytime I hear your voice my body begins to tingle
Everytime I see your smile I think of what you mean to me
Everytime you touch me you always bring me pleasure
I think of the time that we have spent together and I feel all the joy 
that you have brought me
I never want it to end
So long I have searched for the love of my life and finally I have found 
it...That Love is YOU!!!
Everytime I see your face my heart fills with love
I can never think of life without you because you are my life
Everything I do I do for you
I think of our good times both past and present and I think of what the 
future holds for us together
I wany nothing more than to spend my life loving you and only you.
I need you in my life.

I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!

I don't know. Most guys aren't big on poetry--you would be very possibly 
wasting your breath on your significant other. Guys aren't the romantic 
creatures all too often--at least in the modern sense of romance. I know 
that when i get poems from my girlfriend I appreciate them and what goes 
into them, but they really don't throttle me. Many men, myself included, 
have passions, indeed, but for things more abstract than romance and 
boyfriend/girlfriend relationships. I love my girlfriend, but i don't 
passionately love her. Not so much that her poetry would move 
me--especially if it were directed towards me. 
    So, c0onsider my above ramblings in your descision, but when it comes 
right down to it, I say do whateber feels right. I know for certain I am 
not like many others.

that is an interesting poem you posted: the one tht begins " go to

a, b, a, b, rhyme scheme. Why is that? Don't think I'm telling you how to

I have to dissagree with you here.  I am a very romantic guy and love to 
write poetry to, and recieve it from my girlfriend.  From what I have
noticed with most of my friends who are guys, they actually do enjoy stuff
like that, but usually have to keep too macho of an image to admit it.

They are not even in the same league.  Although I like and respect
Heinlein's writing, Ellison in a single novel managed to encapsulate the
whole experience of being an American, with all its complexities and
nuances.

  in an english class i had last semester, we read this article about
a poetry class. the teacher had left an assignment on the board from
a different class, and when the poetry class came it, they saw it and
thought it was a poem (it was just a list of names) and started 
analyzing it. THe teacher let them go with it, and they eventaully
pulled a lot of "deep" meaning from it. just a bunch of words and 
numbers (author's names and page numbers i think they were actually).
 basically anyting can be percieved as art and people can enjoy it.
just like music, visual art, whatever... i heard some construction
equipment on campus the other day and i swear the banging and clanging
was just as cool sounding as any industrial tracks i'ev heard recently.
would've been cool to sample and loop as a rhythm track.
   so what's my point? i dunno... but basically if people enjoy it or
get meaning out if it, it qualifies as art (in this case poetry). and
yes i agree that there's so many cliches and overworked themes that it
gets pretty lame sometimes. but i'm sure there's SOMEONE out there that
has an original perspective on love... so keep trying, people.

love is a passing emotion

Really? Hmmm. I've never read any Heinlein, never was much into sci-fi, I 
read War of the Worlds in 4th grade, scared my self half to death and 
haven't picked up another sci-fi novel since, unless you count some of 
the stuff Vonnegut writes as sci-fi, but I perfer to think of it as satire.
Sci-fi is one of the scariest genres because there's always a chance, 
however slight, that the stuff in them could happen.

>  and | really don't th|nk anyone around here |s try|ng to pull the wool

Hmmmm. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Maybe I am, pulling the wool 
over someones eyes is such fun. ;). Most of the poetry I write is like 
that one I posted, sarcastic, tongue in cheek stuff. Oh I have writien

A Warrior At Dawn

Weep for me,
And sing for me,
And pray for me,
I must go now to meet Fate.

For now we are parted
But remembrance shall keep us close.
Things said, gifts kept, tender moments, and laughter,
These shall make our bond.

To see me you have only to notice
The simple pleasures around you,
The beauty of nature, good drink, and laughter.
Perceive the world with the wonder of a child,
Peer through The Looking Glass and see my life.

Our souls have crossed paths
So we are destined to meet again.
We have formed a chain which transcends
The bonds of man and earth.
And when united again
We shall indulge in these delights once more,
Beauty, drink, and laughter.



Well, thats it....hope someone enjoys it...it is simple, yet has a
great message(which is hard to see if you dont know him, but oh

here's a little ditty by e.e. cummings--one of my personal favorites,
chuckle, chuckle:) tell me what you think.

the way to hump a cow is not
to get yourself a stool 
but draw a line around the spot
and call it beautifool

to multiply because and why
dividing thens by nows 
and adding ands(i understand)
is hows to hump a cows

the way to hump a cow is not
to elevate your tool
but drop a penny in the slot
and bellow like a bool

to lay a wreath from ancient greath
on insulated brows
(while tossing boms at uncle toms)
is hows to hump a cows

the way to hump a cow is not 
to push and then to pull
but practicing the art of swot
to preach the golden rule

to vote for me(all decent mem
and wonens will allows 
which if they don't to hell with them)
is hows to hump a cows


*NOTE* i have not mispelled anything in the above poem--i checked--if
anything is not spelled correctly, it was the authors intention.
enjoy,

Although he did a great service to sci-fi, it doesn't compare to the
abilities of Ellison.  It's hard to explain, but in the single novel he
published, Ellison demonstrated his complete understanding of the black
condition, the american condition, and the human condition.
I know what I've said seems a bit arrogant, but the difference between the
writing abilities of the two is fairly large.

I don't know that pure intention implies good poetry.  It's just that I
don't like that people think they can just throw flowery words together,
mention love, and feel deep.  I don't like the assumption that unstructured,
unreflective poems are just as good just because of honest intentions.

respectable...and Ralph Ellison did what he did very well too...bot talk 
aboutthe human conditon, just in different ways...

Pure intention does not necessarily make good poetry, I agree that t s 
necessary to know enough to avoid a cliche, *but* you have to give a 
person credt for tryng...we all can't be Yeats or Shakespeare...  And 
while I'll be the first one in line to bitch and moan about the state of

Wrong wrong wrong my dear. I write poetry because I feel like it. If I'm 
upset or angry and decide to write a sarcastic poem instead of a morose 
depressing or anger and hatred filled one, because sarcasm makes me feel 
better than my real emotions do, then I'll write a sarcastic poem. :)

Oh, come on Nat. Sure, yeats is a great poems--Easter 1916 is one of the
greatest poems ever. cummings, though, had an understanding of rythm and
diction and the like that no one has even come close to. His creativity
and experimantation takes poetry to a whole new level for me.

...oh, come on. conventional rythm has been around for thousands of years.
It's long overdue that we play around with forms and comlexity of our
languages in new ways--the english language for one could use new
manipulations.But i don't think i will kill you for your opinion--but
there is always that option;)

however, it has gotten to the point where the conventions are no longer

pentameter.  I still remember my 9th grade english class where we were 
told to write a poem and the techer told us that anything we wanted could 
be poetry.  There has to be some thought put into it, not just a random 
selection of words that look good.  That's what the conventions do...they 
make the poet think of the words that best suit his or her purpose.  And 
while I know that cummings did put a lot of thought into his poetry, it is 
his poetry and others like it that have led to this total lack of 
understanding of poetic forms and what *I* consider to be the sorry state 
of poetry today.  I just don't like the aesthetic that I'm being forced to 
conform to.  And while I do write free verse, I also discipline myself by 
writing sonnets.  That's about allI can think of at the moment, cause I'm

Actually, i was taught the conventtions of how to form meter and rythm,
but i doubt that everyone is. Yes, i would agreee that some poems now use
free verse out of sheer laziness. I would even hesitate to consider most
free verse poems--perhaps raw thought would be a better term. some totally
disregard any verse when it could elevate the communication of their
thoughts into a totally different level of experience. with free verse the
content and diction communicate, as does the lack of verse. Many don't
consider the poem something that acts upon many different complex levels,
so what we get is a lot of second rate poetry. 
But now on the other hand, look how many people butcher rythm and
meter. too many people just think that the only way to wirte a poem is in
the standard a,b,c,d...rhyme scheme and whatever rythm seems to fit in
with the first line of the poem. Certainly this is not good poetry. Most
of the poetry in unfree verse is just as childish and incomplete as the
free verse. 
rythm and rhyme are something that need more consideration from
poets. And no rythm or ryme is still a type of rythm and rhyme and still
requires the same considerations as such.

Okay, here we go off being "professional" poets?  Tell you all what, 
I am a Computer Science Major!  Once upon a time I learned a little about
rhyme and meter, but I really didn't care much, I write what I feel!  If it
happens to rhyme, so be it, if not then it doesn't.  I guess that I just don't
have what it takes to write good poetry!  But then again when you are 
programming 10 - 20 hours a week, you really don't have too much time to 
think about if it has some rhyme or rythym!  I guess if you don't like what
I write, dont read it.  I just feel that if there are 2 or 3 people out
there that like to read it, then I will post it, if not I will just keep it
to myself *professional poetry* (spoken under breath)

No, that is not what I got from it at all.  I got this sudden
feeling, not from any one person, that the poetry here was not good
enough, from there it went on to forms, what was better who was better
and then got into rhyme and meter, and I really started to feel like
anything that I wrote wasnt going to be good enough.  I have just
been wondering if everyone thinks that everything here sux.  With the
exception of hawke, in the last 3 or 4 days here I have just been an
innocent bystander waiting for this to calmly cool down.  I didnt 
mean to start anything new.  Sheesh with all the flames going you
would think that we were on #hack *ha ha ha* I really hope it does
calm down, cuz I know I put thought and effort into my stuff,

I scoff at the avant garde.  I think a lot of the stuff that gets 
published today, that is not 'genre' writing, is crapola.  I have the 
hardest time finding books when I go to the bookstore.  It's gotten to the 
point where I don'teven look for new authors anymore, I just look
for different books by authors I already have.  I should be able to find 
good writing without having to hunt for it.  The standards of the 
publishing industry need to be raised, methinks.  Look at Stephen King.  
He writes his books in the cab on the way to the publisher.  The quality 
of his stuff doesn't seem to be as good to me as it did 10 years ago.  And 
no one's going to sit him down and say, "Hey Steve, could you rewrtie 
this?"  Cause if they do, he can just take it to another publisher.  Sure, 
it'd be breaking his contract, but w/ the kind of monay he makes, he can 
afford it.  Publishers are more interested in making a dollar than they 
are in distributing quality literature.  I think that has to change.

I think that Eliot might have a hard time with your statement (not to 
mention contemporary poetry).  His stuff was several layers deep with 
references and often meant to be difficult to read.  Note, for example, 
the Greek and Latin in The Wasteland, as if the English isn't hard enough! 
 Sure, Eliot would scoff at a lot of stuff today.  And sure, his 
cats-related stuff was fun.  But rather than being avante-garde for its 
own sake, I think that Eliot's poetry more nearly tried to be art for 
art's sake.  If you read Eliot as a reaction against Romanticism, this 
becomes a little clearer.

writing poetry to make people feel something? Art for art's sake?  what a

okay, stud. you write poetry the way you want; i'm not orderinf any method
upon anyone but myself--if anything i'm trying to keep people from being
forced to write in one certain way because they think that is the way
poems me be in order to be poems. 
but the way i see it is any type of verse--free or otherwise--is
a choice of verse, and i don't think any choice in life should be taken
for granted. If you have enough passion for poetry you'll think about the
choices you make with it, the intricacy of the meter, the suggestions of
the diction, the allusios and similies and metaphors. You'll put every
pieof passion you can wring out of your limbs on to that paper. You'll see
how you can communicate thinks beyond normal expression, and you'll brood
over every choice, every rhyme, every word, every little thing. If you
don't care, fine--just dump it on the paper--that can be great sometimes. 
you see, nothing beautiful is above the elements and design
principles of art--even the most nihilistic sentiments have a unity and
balance to them. Every poem reflects something; if you don't care about
that fine, but  ido and i'll keep on encouraging others to explore and
consciously deal with the different elements of poetry, thank you very
much. 
btw, i'm and Arch major and spend most of my time in the design
studio--your 10 to 20 hours a week programming sounds like a goddamn
vacation to me,and i still find the time to think about what i
right--imagine that

The Waste Land is great! I love Eliot. And The Hollow Men has the best 
line in poetry ever written, IMHO:

"This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper."

"Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."

I am your building block,
I am the one who guides you,
I am the green grass,
in your ever growing forest.

But when the sky falls down,
and you're screaming for me,
I am not to be found,
For you have forgotten me.

At the tower on the hill,
In the house with many walls,
Your screams of breathlessnes,
echo into the village.

I do not weep for you,
nor do i cry for you,
I only wish for me,
to forget this maddening game.

Again, and again,
and just once more,
your scream falls on ears,
across the valleys and streams.

Along forbidden ears,
and among unheard souls,
Racing under the surface,
of the icy stare of death.

Hidden beneath all that seems real,
a slip on the burning tree,
and thrown away from maddness,
Down, down, into the puddle of despair.

The moisture penetrates your lungs,
As the water screams for entry,
and the air battles to escape,
there will soon be a mutual exchange.

And then you are the water,
You are not here, nor there,
You cannot love, see, or hear,
The sun has set,

And you're fucking dead....

diction, meter, rhyme scheme, tone, that kinda shit.
Oh well here it goes...

I hate to see you go

you said, as you were kissing my cheek, 
"You ready"
Well someone was whispering in the other ear
"choose any animal and you will become..."
Or something like that.

It was time to go,
"Let's go" i think you said, 
and in the other ear, 
"Any animal you want to be and with every word you are one.."
Or something like that.

For you, old friend, i would be any animal, 
and, Perhaps, i am with every word i say to you, 
and every word takes me back to you and those sunny days before we lost
interest in innocence
...Or something like that.

And i felt a kiss on my cheek as i fell into a sleep
"Goodbye" I never heard you say, 
and nothing in the other ear.

Pain keeps the real so in your face that you want to puke,
vomit the emotion for it away.
The only thing that keeps you sane are the pill and
liquids that will make the real such a welting and melting

Run if you think that it helps

Shield you from the weight of life,
and the only release, death.
Run the fuck away,
go hide you sick and rotting creature.
Only then can you save yourself.

so...since it is so choppy and not so good yet, i'll tell you what i'm

technoloogy, using christianity as a parallel.  

Blinking lights hypnotize
Mysterious beeps and whirs mesmerize
Communion with a machine

    mentor
    lifeblood
Our very lives depend on these contraptions

One misplaced disk
Misunderstood command
Accidental kick to the power cord
    Go directly to Jail
    Do not pass Go
    Do not collect $200
We get mad at the tool when it's our fault

And man said,
Let us make computers in our image,
After our likeness.

I know, i know, i know.  A LOT ofwork to be done on this.  I've got a few 
ideas, so maybe you all will get a revised (and improved) version one of

Subject: Yeats
Date: Tue May 24 01:43:29 1994

I got this wonderful book of literary criticism.  It's called "Yeats" and 
it's written by Harold Bloom.  I was reading it at work andthere was a 
passage which made me laugh out loud.  So I though I'd share it with you 
all.

though the most famous lines against rhetoric since rimbaud's are by 
yeats, his vision of reality increasingly demanded a more flamboyant 
rhetorical procedure than his own statements could have sanctioned.  this 
is not unique in yeats; the most wearisome critical statements, from 
Wordsworth to the present day, are those against poetical diction and in 
favor of the rhythms of supposedly common speech.  These statements, 
wheher in wordsworth, pound, eliot, or in the host of little poundlings 
and elioticians (heheheheh...that's you Cat...), invariably turn out to 
have no relation whatsoever to any good poets actual performance.  
hatever the rhythms of Yeats became, they were never conversational.  If 
one wants that, one can go, I suppose, to auden, betjeman or larkin, but 
not to the high romantic, anglo-irish yeats.l

ok, i admit it.  it was the swipe at eliot and pound i liked.  But I agree 
100% w/ bloom.  And btw, he is VERY critical of mon cher yeats in this 
book too, so it's not 500 pages of him going on and on about how great he 
was.  well, imho he was really great, but hey, that's just me....

Umm, this is another song lyric I wrote for my band, Plankton...it is a 
song I wrote after meeting an idol of mine, the renowned bassist for the 
great punk band The Minutemen, Mike Watt...after meeting him, I wanted to 
write a lyric that expressed the appreciation and "love" I have for him.

You drive me
You mold me
Your lifesongs unfold me
You are the econoclast

Thunder broom 
Fills the room
Firecracker, boom boom boom
Unleash me, econoclast

You ignite
Make it right
Cut it loose every night
Take me there, econoclast

And all I ever had
A little man with a gun in his hand
And all I ever had
Jesus and Tequila

You drive me
You mold me
Your lifesongs unfold me
You are the econoclast

Econoclast is a hybrid word, combining iconoclast (literally, one who 
breaks down idols) with econo, the adjective Mike Watt often uses to 
describe his Do It Yourself, economical, punk philosophy.  I think it's a 
pretty accurate name for the man.  Thunder broom is a term he uses to 
describe his bass...also an accurate name.

Names Mattt, but those who like me call me Badger, and those what don't

I'm a student at Roger Williams University majoring in Creative Writing in 
a Bachelor of Fine Arts program, and am a fiction writer. But I do write 
the occasional poem.

Why, here's one now! (Memory ofit, not the thing itself)

When I go on the machines my heart

shove the blood
sluice it in my arms
carbonate the 
in my arms
hang me on the wall
throw your jackets down on me
look at my wax stubblestcu deadday expression
use me as a planter
an ornament
hang curtains on me 

I never want to die

Well, that's the most I can remember off hand.

Have a nice day, and remember that 
I said hello.

BTW_The poem came from a discussion on aggressive life support I had with 
a friend of mine who has since passed on. He disagreed.

Date: Tue May 24 20:48:04 1994

i was looking through my writing folder, and i found this old story type 
thing that i wrote in 10th grade (ions ago :) ) when my teacher assigned 
us to write a "narrowing of focus story". i thought i;d post it just so 
you all wouldn't think all i ever write are sarcastic poems. :) this is 
more morbid that anything i've ever writen i think, but ah well. 
I've always has a facination for cemetaries. :)                    

       There is a tall iron fence surrounding the cemetery. A chain has 
been woven through the fence and fastened by a padlock, so that none may 
disturb the homes of the dead during the night hours. Silence hangs on 
this place like a veil, broken only by the howling of the lonely wind. A 
few paths can be seen through the grass, made earlier by loved ones who 
had come to pay their debts to the dead. A marble statue of Christ stands
in the center of the cemetary with it's open arms outstretched, as 
if to welcome in the spirits of the deceased.
        Within the cemetary lies a grave, alone, far apart from the 
rest. No paths lead up to this secluded spot. The tombstone is 
crumbling, and so grime-encrusted that the inscription can not be 
deciphered. The only "flowers" that decorate this stone are the 
weeds that grow high around it, embracing it.  
         Six feet beneath the matted grass lies a coffin, and old 
wooden coffin. The nails which hold the wood together are bent and 
rusty. The wood itself is rotting away, deteriorating. It is more like 
wet cardboard that wood. Maggots have burrowed deep into it, leaving 
vein-like paths in their wake.
         Inside the coffin lie some bones, the flesh had fallen from 
them years ago. They are weak and brittle. The arms and legs are long, 
the shoulders broad, indicating a man. Scraps of cloth, whose color 
has long since faded, cling to the bones. A hole can be seen in one 
scrap of cloth, a small round hole, and it continues on through one of 
the bones in the ribcage. Next to the bones sits an old rifle. It is 
useless, corroded, and covered with rust. But what would it's owner 
use it for now?
          There was no way of knowing that these bones belonged to a 
soldier, a young man of 18. Excited by fighting for freedom and 
liberty, and determined to change the world, he joined the war. He was 
pathetically inexperienced in fighting, his hands had never held a 
gun. He feel on his first day of battle, killed by a well-guided shot 
to the heart. 
          Now, all that remains of him are his bones, lying in a 
rotting coffin, under a lonely grave, in the cemetary.
   

(the persian gulf war was going on at the time i wrote this, so i 
think it inadvertently affected the story) anyhow, that's one of the 
very few serious/"dark" pieces i've ever written. satire is a much 
more comfortable medium for me to write in. ;)

watch the greyblack
build itself
live for the periods dotting pits at the end
Everything is water
live waiting for the rain
waiting for it to end

Don't know me anymore
silver my eyes sliver shadows
snakerooted tongue only lies
older than my fathers
age creeps greengray
golden up my sagskin
wrapped around bulging KFC fat

Yellowing teeth clack on nothing

hunt past death mind the time
drive us past drydying
rise in me
surround us whitemoldgrave trees stand as watch

she burns in my rainfed thoughtranges
out and strikes no work today called on account of
1, 2, 3
Sesame Street and Me taught me how I taught me
Nod nobody but me
Don't know me
living between the razorshine rain
don't live much anymore

slam the sagskinned bulkbone hateweight into

growl through our yellowaiting rageteeth
GINGIVITIS MY ASS

Well, you asked for it.
I just happen y

from yesterday that I did in Japan after my friend died.

Here We Go.
(When I go on the machines my heart) Mrossi

When I go on the machines my heart
unliving not beating
blood shoved      sluiced through my arms my veins 
carbonation in my arms
hang me on the wall
keep your hats on me
     dresss me up to scare away strau crows
let yoir kids play with my leadman body
hands dead no holes
hang verdant and crimson stockings on my sallow stubble shrouded face
my 
christ posture no blinking
my neck leans left
don't let them pull the plug

What rough beast, his hour come at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be 
born? (I know I got the form wrong, but still...)

I don't like Eliot or Yeats the best. 

My favorite Poets are John Skelton, Roethke, Corso, And Keats.

Although there are tons more. I'm very open that way. I like all sorts of 
poetry and prose. (I'd better. I edit the school litmag.)

And as far as Apocalypse poetry goes, I have a line that I can't find that 
runs through my head, heard it somewhere but can't remember where.
"I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds."

Who wrote that?

*ahem* IMHO, "The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock" was written for one and 
only one purpose.  To torture high school students.  Blah.  I fucking hate 
that poem.  Of course, I only like that one teesy weensy bit of Eliot.  
Iprefer Yeats at his worst to Eliot at his best. 

And I know NOTHING about getting published (my stuff isn't good enough

you think Love Song is humorous? i never read it like that. i always 
thought of it as kinda sad, this middle aged man wants to do things, but 
is held back because he's too worried about what people will think of 
him, esp. the members of the opposite sex. i never looked at it as funny 
before, maybe it's time to re-read it (perish the thought, eh Nat *grin* )

I never listened to the Crashtest Dummies either. i always thought they 
were those silly vince and larry guys on the buckle up commercial. guess

I'd take Prufrock over the Stolen Child anyday....
Although I like Easter 1916...I think they all have merit
"Here is Belladonna, the lady of the rocks,
The Lady of Situations" works for me (I KNOW THAT'S FROM WASTELAND) 
As well as "An aged man is but a paltry thing"
Eliot was heavily influenced by Yeats
(The Second Coming and the Wasteland are very similar in intent)
and I don't like to cut myself off from either

But I really have a hard time seeing the humor in Prufrock.

And I hate Pound, so at best I be a hypocrite here.

2 can play that game

The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?

Come near; I would, before my time to go,
Sing of old Eire and the ancient ways:
Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days.

Now and in time to be,
Wherever green is worn,
Are changed, changed utterly:
A terrible beauty is born.

I sought a theme and sought for it in vain,
I sought it daily for six weeks or so.
Maybe at last being but a broken man
I must be satisified with my heart, although
Winter and summer till old age began
My circus animals were all on show,
Those stilted boys, that burnished chariot.
Lion and woman and the Lord knows what.
* * * * * 
Those masterful images because complete
Grew in pure mind but out of what began?
A mound of refuse or the sweepings of a street,

Old iron, old bones, old rags, that raving slut
Who keeps the till.  Now that my ladder's gone
I must lie down where all the ladders start
In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.

Genius.  Pure genius.  Yeats speaks to y 'foul rag and bone shop of the 
heart' in a way Eliot never could.  I am inspired by Yeats to write.  I 
can hear the music of his words.  There is no music for me in Eliot.

FOR YOU. As I keep saying, everybody has an opinion. I happen to like them

The opinion is personal.

In an attempt to make the peace, I will now quote from my favoriet Yeats.
.........................
The unpurged images of day recede;
The Emperor's drunken soldiery are abed;
Night resonance recedes, night-walkers' song
After great cathedral gong;
A starlit or a moonlit dome disdains
All that man is,
All mere complexities,
The fury and the mire of human veins.

to Badger01 and Tammie-  
    The Reason I find Love song Humorous is because of the amount of 
melodrama that the speaker uses to describe his "plight"   I find it 
terribly hilarous and could hardly keep from laughing as I read it in 
class.  the whole idea that the female sex should inspire that kind of 
fear or that anyone would be so concerned about his or her apperarance is 
truly laughable.   I do, however, love Eliot 's use of imagery to depict 
the fog etc.... you must realise however that i have not read it in awgile 
and therefore pardon my non-descriptiveness.

have fun!!

Now as I wait 
I find myself still thinking
about past evenings
in that dark, cloudy
room with all of it's
ash and noise
left wity shattered countenence 
and heart in my hands
I'm am not prepared
to try to put it back together
as I clutch it to my breast
and push hard against
my chest hoping to
force it back into the void
the black hole which
will never forget you
left bruised and happy.
at once alone.
Afeared that I might
Not love again.

Inaffected by you
The marks will remin
Me of the passion

An empty heart

With tabloid crime-sheets perched in easy sight.

finding out it wasn't what you thought it was...cool...kinda like real

I had the most alien dream
a few moons ago
I dreamt that I gave life
to a beautiful female baby
I dreamt that I had to give 
up my beautiful female baby
And it tore out my heart
When I woke up my pillow
was wet form the tears I'd
creid in my slumber

I had my dream come true
A few weeks ago
My beautiful female baby
was born from me and the
One I loved
but this time I did not give
My baby away
I left the birthplace with
My child in my arms
Wrapped in a homemade blanket

I took my baby home with me
And slept
with her next to me and my lover

Yes I am happy that you re-read prufrock. :) question is, are YOU happy 
you re-read prufrock? I just like that poem 'cause i can identify w/ it. 
i'm not middle-aged and balding, but i'm terrified of encounters with the 
opposite sex sometimes..and i can understand how P. felt. and i think the 
image of a night being "stretched out like a patient etherized on a 
table" is cool. :) and eliot always uses cats in his poems (sure he uses 
them as metaphors for senuality but...) :)
about silverstein....hmm. he certainly is a poet in his own right. the 
subjects he deals with are "timeless" and so techically he should be 
classic. personally i don't think he will be. his stuff IMHO doesn't have 
the same sort of umph and uniqueness that say Roald Dahl's does, or 
Maurice Sendack's (sp?) does. and his illustrations aren't all that hot 
either. :) i never liked "the Giving Tree" the tree just let's the 
selfish little brat of a boy use her and walk all over her..not a very 
pretty picture. Now, had the tree finally decided she'd had enough, grown 
tentacles, strangled the Boy to death, and buried his body and used it 
for fertilizer to rejuvinate herself and the earth....THEN silverstein 
would be classic. :)
sorry this post is so long.

    -for kerouac-
Rubbing his belly and licking his
    lips he came for her,
Across the swollen room.
with smoke and whiskey on his
    clothes.
Briskly, lovingly he waled,
with an aire of a secret unknown.

Racking her brain she tried to getit out.
Partly suspended between life and work,
   Without a map to be had.

Sleepily he woke, hours ago,
    wondering the time or place.
little Harlem nights you stay with me.

Love and Laughter, sorrowed existence
    unknown destinations.
All the white noise and blackened silences
    pages of my life go by.

DARK?
*****
Why is love a maze, and a toil of darkened dream,
that twists into knots, that aren't what they seem?

Why can't love be a flower, that blooms in the sun?
  Why is love a shadow, forever on the run?

Why is love confusing, a dazzling web of lies,
Why is love left stranded, to dance among the flies?

Why is love shown red, when all i see is black?
Why is love about giving, when i never get it back?

How can love be true, forever etched in stone?
  How can love be shared, when i am always so alone?

Who can deal with love, but the confident and strong?
  Who is there to love, for my only love was wrong.

When does love attack, or sail upon the sea?
When is love for us, and when does love choose me?

 Can love be at my side, or follow at my heel?
or how about in my pocket, for only me to feel?

Can love be the drkness, that i carry on my back?
  or can love be the light, that i always seem to lack?

enjoy people!!!

maybe somebody out there can identify.....

    --FRUSTRATION--
they slept
he slept
she COULD NOT sleep
she wanted
they needed
they wanted
he'd had
she COULD NOT have

so she tried to think
about little grey stars
and tiny fluffy clouds
but the feeling
would not leave
could not leave
as she lay
next to him
warm from tip to toe
but without that one
thing she wanted
so badly.

All Mixed Up
*************

Some times i feel, like i could just run away,
to the hills of stealth, to the valley of play...

Sometimes i feel so down, like a puddle in the rain,
sometimes i feel like the thunder, in a downpour of pain...

Often i wander the street, with love in the back of my head,
other times i just wander, lettimg my feelings mixed w/ dread.

Once in a while i feel, like the world is my foe,
then i stop and think, and wonder if it isn't so.

when i'm feeling down in, and my mind is mixed up,
i realize that i am the poison, in my own paper cup...

i forget that i am only human, i forget i am cursed...
i remember i stand for pain, i remember i felt it first.

so somwtimes in the moonlight, when a star shines on my back
i remember your tears, filling a sidewalk full of cracks.

with all these blessed feelings, and this one hated cup,
full of all your blood, with my being so mixed [fucked] up.

TECHNOPHILIA

    "Kiss me in the dark with lips of steel."
            --Guadalcanal Diary

I want to feel your
                   cold metal
                             hands on my
        shoulders back thighs and
                                 everywhere in-between.
Caressing me.
Kissing me with your
                    shiny steel lips.
My eyes close and
I imagine a lover who's
                       strong virile human.
Which you aren't but I still want you,
you with your
             sexless metal self.
Skilled in all the tricks that I'm not,
your willingness to do anything,
anything I want no matter how
                             bizarre weird unusual.
You are at my command,
                      robot.
You will do as I say in my
                          onanistic fantasy world.

Swilling a delicious wine
And smoking
While listening to the
Young child in her
Spout words of wisdom

The burning permeates
The room with a presence
More material than my own
As it floats on the
Wind to my nostrils
And fills me with
A scent of an unknown
Place

She crouches on the floor
Looking for the jewels
She lost in another place, far from here
In another time, unknown to me
In another life, when she was not as I know her

So we raise our faces
To the moonlit sky
And sing the Old music
In harmony with
The stars and the spheres in the
Old dance which mortals have forgotten
From the mouths of babes
We remember nothing that we once knew

Hot irons on icy faces
Burn the flesh
And add to the smoky
Room a scent of humanity
And an odor of lost love

And the Children they remeber
The ways of old from the faerie
Teachers that teach them in
Their dreams
While they slept
With angelic faces
To mirror their Teachers
From the Old music

Light bulbs screaming
Their power for us to hear
The power which I can control
Only partially
Let me use your power, oh great one ( she laughs)

The music rings in my ears
As I lay on my back
It washes over me
In a cloud of sweetness
I watch the little shadows
Of children on the wall although
I am alone in this place
Swilling and smoking

Cold appendages touch my warm body
Blackened, smudged fingers clasped
In mine
I hold this forbidden one close to my heart
And she screams in pain as though I have hurt her

The sky changes from deeply black
To grey to a suddenly shining gold
And the song changes from the Old music
Of the night to the hurried chaos
Of daylight and we keep singing the fading
Harmony as we go through our daily paces
Of life in order to achieve the accepted
Norm of success

A picturesque life scene
pans out before these very eyes of mine
Of rainbow-haired children
Dancing in the fields of glorious wild flowers
As a steady rain drenches their tiny forms

**continued from last post**

In this darkened place
I seeonly his form
Shedding the skin that confines his
Movements, full of grace
Only by the dim light of a single smoking stick
That burns steadily into the night
Filling the room with a new familiarity
That comforts my troubled soul

The lights are flickering, the windows shake
The earth quakes with the broken hearts
All over the sphere
That wail with a pain that is not quieted
That burns without a tangible fuel

He sheds the skin and comes to me
in my puddle of shed skin
On this pallet of open aire grasses
And straw
We sleep, our unconcience forms
Shaped like little silver spoons
Sharing everything, heat, affection, and ecstasy
I try not to show him how I care

Fighting the tide of life
As I swim against the flow
Of normality pressed upon me from all sides
My fins grow tired as I try with all my might
I know I cannot do this alone although I press on in solitude

The sun burns hotly
Against the blackened skin
Of the children that stood in the flowering field
They stood for millenia, dancing together
Until the flowering field became a burning
Desert with flowering skeleton trees
AS the young coal colored rainbow
Children dance awaiting the new dawn

Her long crown shines golden down her back
Slender and beautiful
Pink skin shining in the darkness
Perfect god-inspired form
But now she is dead

Again the night has come
And we ritually abandon the chaotic
Beating of the daylight and sing the familiar
Melodies of the stars and spheres
Dancing around a vast nothing that we
Cleared space for
T o remind us of the thing we fight against
Another nothingness that cancels the music

They come together
Unaware of the intentions of others
To chisel their unity into stones of
Absolute, total void
They trust in nothing but each other

I can feel it spreading
Hitching a ride upon my cells
To completely inhabit me
To totally incapacitate me
She said with bitter acceptance
In her tone
She lives with this sickness everyday

Sculpture, smooth transition
Into something that cannot be
Known except in a haze
He makes it tangible
Forcing my soul sight into a mineral

The old soldier polishes
He polishes the medals of another
Devotion to his position
He refused to take anothers life
He rejected the massacre of many
S ohe was scorned by his peer
And those above him did not understand
His peaceable heart, the past that shone with love

its head of crudely carved ivory.

Long ago, when I was young,
The world was full of love,
A walk along the road would bring,
You so many "good mornings."

Bu now it brings bitter warnings !
"Don't go out in the  dark, lock your doors, switch on your alarms."

A walk to the shops with the kids,
A stroll in the park with the dog.
You know all the things we loved.
But now you can't go for a stroll,
In the park, not unless your dog is tough.

Oh where, Oh where has all the love gone ?
Times have changed,
People are strange.
But we all need love.
If we all try to smile and be kind and true,
Shortly we can bring back the love,
We once knew.

My wife wrote this after watching the evening news here in the United 
States.  The story reminded her of some terrible things that happened to 
her when she was very young.

heaviness of heart
a soul rejected
tears of mine start
my fears projected

with only a flailing hope
for me to hold
that anothers hate
has not been sold

my comfort lacking
though my sorrys I send
but there's nothing more harder
than to lose a friend...

and so I bleed.

I wrote this poem when I was about 6 years old, and I ran across it the 
other day and was overcome with an urge to post it. Bear in mind that I 
was only 6 at the time. :)

A pretty monster.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The dog wagged his tiny tail.
He jumped and did a flip
and ran around the mile-long house.
He hid his ugly face
and barked at the fence.
He ran under the table
and knocked it down.
He had seen a pretty monster
and he screamed.

For some odd reason I can't explain, it made me think of it.
I have a neural condition I call Siderial thinking, where
unrelated concepts connect without correlation of any kind.
Or at least it's as good an explanation as I am depressed.

The Damned

i hid from you as i hid from myself;
i walked inward, and kicked when you pulled me
Out and said to face the world, it's what's best
For me. So i became molded, and learned
The dance. Which mask should i wear today? Can
You wait while i try them on? And i've many
Painted smiles and funny little sayings
To match as well. i thought i was running,
But i was standing still. And now i think
i'm stronger, but i'm only hiding and
Hurting, enjoying the pain because it's
Real, and something i learned from
You. And now i'm teaching myself that hate
And the rage and death are what the masks hide.

She opened her mouth to the coal grey sky
and swallowed the little white butterfies
some call snow
Her breath, in the chill
forms softly crashing icicles
that her big, clumsy boots
crush, as she presses on
without a cloak
in the freezing night
passing those that had 
made her life a burning hell
so hot she shed a skin
that confined her like a rattlesnake's
the shed skin laid at her feet
as she danced in the
water that had melted because of the
heat they had generated
He, the temporary object of her affection and lust
had left because of a primary engagement

Heart beating in the dark;
You silently lie down beside me.
Lights from passing cars
Play over motel walls.

Trembling in the night;
You take my hand in yours
And patiently wait for me
To make the moment right.

I can see your eyes shining.....
I can feel your love washing over me....

In the silence of this time
I softly cry a tear;
Mourning for all that has been lost
In the lands of my mind.

You gently reassure me
In the language of your love;
In the aching of my will to
Be beautiful for you.

I can see your eyes shining.....
I can feel your love washing over me...

Forever.....


This is dedicated to the love of my life.....always and 
forever...faithfully!

Be alone
Feel alone
Lost my senses,  lost my home
Cover me
Smother me
Take a trip on my lobotomy
Hate me
Debate me
Pay no mind,  evaporate me
    I feel blinded,  dead,  and free
    Take your time to sink with me

Arrest me
Molest me
Tell your friends that you detest me
Find me
Beside me
Take your choice of personality
Tear me
Bear me
Hold me down,  exterminate me
    Lustfull,  brainless,  endless sea
    Before I die,  just sink with me
   
        But every time I try to scream my silent sorrow
        Everybody wonders what happened to my head
        Go away,  don't touch me!
        Bother another victim instead

Buy me
Sanitize me
Tell yourself that I'm too crazy
Hurt me
Desert me
Too many scars and pain on my mind
Kill me
Distill me
Break a new friend,  do your old men
    Standing by the cliffs you see
    Take one step and sink with me
    Sell your friendship,  steal your peace
    Watch them laugh,  we're sinking free

What do you do when you got a fever in your head
What do you do when your lover loves another instead
Sometimes I don't know about my life
Think I'll just get old and then I'll die
   
Losing my mind like I sometimes lose my keys
Only wanna find somebody who knows what I mean
Even though it's warm I still feel cold inside
Think I'll just get old and then I'll die

    My heart's too scarred and scratched to ever fall in love again
    Half the pain's from lovers,  and the other half's from friends
    So now I'm standing outside on the cold dark porch while the
        party's going on inside
    And I'm not getting any younger,  baby
    Now I'm just getting old and crazy...

How does it feel when your life's going down the drain
Do you know what it's like when your children don't know your name
Everything I do turns out a waste of time
Think I'll just get old,  and then I'll die

The lot of love is chosen.  I learnt that much
Struggling for an image on the track
Of the whirling Zodiac.
Scarce did he my body tough,
Scarce sank he from the west
Or found a subterranean rest
On the maternal midnight of my breast
Before I had marked him on his northern way,
And seemed to stand although in bed I lay.

I struggled with the horror of daybreak,
I chose it for my lot!  If questioned on
My utmost pleasure with a man
By some new-married bride, I take
That stillness for a theme
Where his heart my heart did seem
And both adrift on the miraculous stream
Where--wrote a learned astrologer--
The Zodiac changed into a sphere.

(1929)

Hey all: I wrote this poem in February 1992 after a very traumatic 
experience...It is basically about me not being able to cry. Please tell 
me what you think...feedback is important and I cannot improve without it.


A Desert

The rain has all but dried
Up, and the landscape has
Become quite infertile;
A desolate place where
Life is cheap and worthless.
Can you understand the
Barrenness, the cold and
The death, and the breath it
Gives to innocent life?
The air has not a voice, 
And yet speaks aloud when
Angered, though there isn't
Life around to protect.
And the landscape, thirsty
For rain, is terrified;
Because it knows well the 
Tendency to flood out.
So the land is dead, yet
Holds onto its layers;
Waiting for the rains that
Will only keep adding
Water to its hidden 
Depths; 'til the land itself

Grows stagnant and dies from
Drowning the inside out.

Thanks CJ...your comment was sincerely appreciated. I like to know that a 
particualr poem I wrote with a particular effect in mind actually evoked 
the intended reaction.....

I did not mean to imply that your work is any more or less intense than 
mine I just happen to think you write deep and provoking poems...you do 
not seem to come across as superficial (not that any one's work on
 here has given me that impression). That is all. 

I am glad you like the poem...it helped me to get some of that sadness out 
of me and onto the paper.....sadness held inside to long manifests itself 
as anger and let me tell you, I wasn't too pleasant to be around for a 
while there.

Thanks for the criticism...it motivates me to strive for better!

One more and then I have to stop for a while...I can only do so much of 
this...and so far I've been posting stuff I wrote months ago...
    If this is really annoying any of you,  slap me or something...

                Behind The Glass
I hurt
    But pain's beyond me
I hurt
    Ignore the boundaries
I feel
    Cold as winter sunrise
I need
    Something no one gives me
        I slip past the glass
        I care for my mind
        I'm finally alone
        I've no need for time
            I'm in place
            With my face behind the glass.

I bleed
    The colour of your eyes
I crawl
    I hide from the sunrise
I act
    I fake my compassion
I break
    Just to see your expression
        Rushing past my head
        Bleeding on my bread
        Don't you think the world's
        Safer with me dead
            I'm in place
            Silent Scream behind the glass

help me!
    i don't know where this leads
help me!
    i don't know what i see
find me!
    don't drag me back to the world
kill me!
    i couldn't do it myself...
        Rape my mind
        Steal me blind
        I'm safely in place
        Watch me die behind the glass

steal me!
    sell my mind like stolen food
fuck me!
    tear apart my broken mood
bury me!
    shroud in earth and wood
forget me!
    as everybody should...

This is about girl--it had to happen sooner or later

It had to happen sooner or later,
That i got floored upon one's floor, 
and that someone be a lady
Or a woman--you see i don't 
Think that both need still be.

And she was a Woman!

And she was a woman of magnificent everything and could make me feel so
above anything even from the floor. I'll never forget her velvet
lined--but not coffin like--throat and candy-cane smooth voice; however the
other things(memories) have faded.

You keep standing in that doorway
Standing in my way in the yellow ragtattered daisy dress
I slide past and walk into the kitchen
Forty year old walls while you twist your face
Telling me about the price of eggs when you were a girl
quoting from revelations and telling me about grass taller than your head
Twist the face as you try to place mine

As you tell me about the war to end all ways
in the air is a hint of smoke I can almost smell
Gearteeth stripping behind your eyes
Shorting outside as you inside as you try to say
Hi

Not the stove.

This is a poem that I wrote a few years ago about an ex-boyfriend....I am 
including it in the book I am currently working on getting published. 
Comments are appreciated.


Ghost of Love

Loving you is like
A wave upon the
Rocky beach, and a 
Piercing thorn in my 
Side; leaves me stranded,
Out of reach, lost in
The jaws of the tide.
And i reach for you,
But you are not there.
i felt the promise
Behind the mirror.
Where have you gone, so
Far away from me?
i reach for you, but
The ghost of love long
Dead escapes from me;
Echoes of a summer
Long lost inside hate.

You are living in
Consecrated lies.
i gather the seeds
Of vast betrayal.
Where have you gone? You
Left me when the tide
Came for me again.

Where are you now that
Those who know you see
You for what you are?

A rock crashing down 
Upon my head; i
heard you whisper in
Your heart; you wish it
Was dead; and so do
i, since i am dead
To you now because 
Our love died. It fell
Stagnant, through and through.

And the corpse that's left
Behind begins to
Rot away; as i
Hear you pray falsely.
Where have you gone, the
Boy i used to know
Well? Where are you now?
The taunting sky, it
Won't tell; and i look
For you, but only
See the ghost of love
Long dead before me.

Ghosts of love and hate.



Well, that was pretty intense, but what can I say? Betrayal does that to a 
girl.......*sigh* Okay, people, I need some feedback!

I hope you enjoy it.

I found another poem I would like to post.......


The Fire

Black and deadly these fires burn
Underscored with the taste of Hell
Laughing demons scar my heart
Using vices i know so well
Burning higher 'til i'm all consumed
Licking at my hands and feet
Melting down steel walls surrounding stone
'Til the two run together and in Hell meet

Where's the sky? It is covered now
Filling up with charred images of you
Streaking through the vast emptiness
Burnt stones of little use

Can you find me now that i'm dark?
My ashes are blood red
Like dust in the wind i've become
All that i've wished for, like all things dead
i've gone through the fire
i've become a scattered soul
i've gone through the fire
i've finally gone home.


hmmmmm......I was pretty down the day I wrote THAT one.....sorry if this 
depresses you guys....I will post an uplifiting poem next (yes I do have a 
few which are not inclined to drive depressed people to suicide).

Thanks,

*hugs*

The leaping flames 
Of a thousand tapers
Could not absolve me
Of this irreproachable innocence
That I feel for you

The cascading gallons 
of a hidden fall
could not wash away
this ache in me
an ache that is trace
to you

The money the
World encompassed
could not buy the
bondage I should 
expierence 
A slavery to you
And your soul

So i give it one more chance
And lift my tear-filed
mirrors to this
mid-night sky
and pray for torment
against this peaceful
snowscape.

here's the beginning of one i started shortly after "growing up". I'll
post the rest later when i get the shit worked out.

I remember that day: 17...
DAMN!!!
I was such a lightning head:
nightswimming in a thunderstorm,
Drinking liquor like a bone-dry soul,
Fast throughmailboxes driving,
All stirred inside with 
innocence and carnal urges
in a sex-colored smear on the wall.

It was all such a blurr
making love in a rain storm
laughing at the heavens
and the constant ache that
10,000 volts of carnal knowledge 
couldn't cure and nor could 
frantic moments in my room alone.

*more to come soon--just in case someone cares to hear and im not simply
struting and freting with sound and fury into this keyboard for my own
satisfaction. (do pardon the macbeth allusion)*

{Okay. this looks neato. Already you've shown a strong realtionship
between nature and your own emotions. It's obviously stronger than a
simple metaphor. Is that your intention? I wonder if you're commenting on
yourselve or maybe nature, or both at the same time. Clearly, you're
suggesting--your intention is irrelevant for this point--that there is a
connection. You soemhow derive out of this that there is a connection in
nature to what you are feeling in you mind. Is this what you want?

You certainly don't have to keep a strong relationship, but why do you
loosen it up? }

For something that you say you took off the top of your head, this a great
beginning. Personally--and i'm only suggesting at your request--Id like to
see you comment on the relationship you've established in the first part
of your poem. Then, make it clearer why the mind and nature seem to move
apart in the end. I think this could be a very powerful and deep work of
art if you'd address such issues more thoroghly.

Also, just as an afterthought, I'm really curious about your rythm in this
poem. In a poem relating your emotions to nature, i personally think that
the rythm of the poem would be a very important issue to address(damn, i'm
beginnig to talk like an design prfessor.

Ok...here goes.

I wrote this because I was feeling extremely sad and didnt have enough 
energy to post a poem I had already written...didn't feel like typing from 
another piece of paper..so I went into the poetry base, selected
 enterage and just began typing.

Whatever came to mind.

Well, what came to mind (naturally) was a thunderstorm because it was 
actually raining this morning when I sat down to type. This poem is more 
of a Sylvia Plath/John Berryman kinda poem (confessional poets) because 
what I wrote about has extreme significance to me....thunderstorms and 
spiders.....because as a child I was traumitized by both.....it holds 
meaning to me and me only...although many could relate to being 
uncomfortable around them...the same thing with yellow rooms...this is
 symbolism which is symbolic to me only.

I do not know why I worte it. I just started typing and that is what I 
came up with. 

The reason the connection between nature and emotion weakens at the end is 
beacuse the storm abated some. I guess I see the connection of storms and 
my emotions like me and my anger....the storm being nature's version of 
anger or pent up hostility/agression which is being released...I guess 
sometimes I am jealous of nature for being able to purge itself of 
its anger...or whatever.....I wish I could do that sometimes...

Another reason is that there is a separation in my mind...a sepration or 
going apart that co-exists with my emotions. Once again only if you knew 
my story would you understand this....but I do not think it was a 
completely conscious thought that I weakened the connection...not 
deliberate....


As for the rythym I was feeling disjointed...I guess I felt removed from 
my sadness and depression even though I was feeling it..it was muted...I 
felt like I was standing back from it at arms length and examining 
it...yet feeling its impact on me as well. This probably makes no sense to 
you but I guess the only way to describe it is that I dissociated the 
feeling.

I hope to continue getting feedback...I am so glad someone finally gave me 
something to think about on my poetry.....thanks pixy...it was 
appreciated...and is appreciated.

Sincerely,

Dee

This is a poem about losing oneself.....I named it after a lost city in
Greece (gotta love symbolism).


Arimathea

i am lost in a dark
world where even the
light hides and hurts
when it tries to show
its face.....

The illusion of love is
just a farce, and death
comes for those who even
dare try.....

Travelling slowly, like a
picture that advances frame
by frame, the walls between
reality and fantasy become
more and more thin the further
i go.....

And the only way out is
by punching a hole
through the wall which
becomes a door but is really
a window.....




***NOTE*** all of the poems I post from my book are raw....they are under 
revision...so comments would be helpful.....I just want everyone to 
realise that htese are in no way, shape or form finished...polished....or 
perfect. I need ideas people, so feel free to tell me what you like or do 
not like about the poems I post.

Thanks!

I write primarily either total fantasy or straight realistic narrative:


Slightly Joycean at times, but mostly I've founf my own voice, twisted 
though it may be, and that's all I can say. I write about racoons, and 
dead families, and depression, and lack of loss, and all sorts of 
things....Mainly, I write about me.

Out of the shadows
He walks to the cliff's edge,
Cautiously looking out across his vast kingdom.
He howls at everything and at nothing.
He listens for the echo
And it soon returns.
But is it his own voice,
Or that of his hidden cohorts
He alone knows that answer
He alone can tell
For he is their brother
And they are the pack
 
He is ruled by himself alone.
He is slave to nothing but his own mind.
For he is Ghost-who-walks-alone.
He lets out one last thunderous howl
And effortlessly slips back into the darkened valley.
    The valley eclipsed by the ruins of a once greater time
A time that shall soon return.
 
Was he real?
Or was he only a mirage from the past...
 
Only The Trickster knows...
Only the leader of the Great Ghost dance can answer...
 
The answer is but a single howl,
From the lone coyote.
Then silence...

Surrounded by a pale light, he came,
As she lay on the ground.
Lifting her up, he carried her to the sky,
Where she was with others
Pale strange wispy creatures
And she thought she would be...

The Sphinx looked down
Upon her tear streaked face
And he cried himself

You slid your hand under the edge of my shirt,
Rested it on my stomach,
Gently kissed my neck,
And went to sleep.

like a burrowing parasite
leeches off us sucking us of ourt life

we feel the pull become addicted
and have to be pulled away
nothing can break this addiction
unless we want to and the treasures 
it shows us are too many to
comprehend
deeper and deeper we go

into the abyss
dark dank and limitless
we are stripped of all but out souls
floating
disembodied

Dissonance

The taste of heat crawling in his window again, streaming all over his 
body made him gag, and he closed the shade and prayed that the sun would 
just go away. The sweat on his body was his last sweat, pulled from as 
deep in him as he could go, water he couldn't afford to lose. He walked to 
the fridge and fell over the army field pack he was using to carry his 
clothes around.
"Motherfu..screw it." He tried to snarl, but failed, and everything went 
white for a few seconds. He felt heat build up inside him, and as he 
pulled himself up he went to the faucet instead of the barren fridge. Why 
get blinded by the white glare off of the bare walls? The tap water tasted 
rusty, but he drank it anyway, knowing nothing and being less.

Actually, that's kind of a prose poem, huh?

also if you have anything longer that you'd like to see on the gfiles just let 
me know and you can send it to me however you like (ftp or email) and i'll

its a lot easier to read long stuff there than here, and easier for people

It's been a long time.  So long.
Alot of opportunities missed.
I let them go right by without a second thought.
People tell me all of the time what I've missed.
I tell them I know.
It's not what they think.
Hell, it's not what I think either.

Would you choose a gross of mediocrity
or one flawless perfection?
I chose and now have neither.

I'm not here to complain or enlighten.
I'm hear to tell a story, sort of.
Life ain't all that complicated.
As a matter of fact, everything in this world
is fairly simple at a basic level.
Nothing is beyond man.  Nothing is beyond me.

One of the wisest men I have ever met once told me:

There's no need to follow the Ten Commandments
or any such thing.  There is only one law that
a true man should follow.  Its simplicity only
serves to help all men understand it and to 
follow it.  Do not take it for granted.

Be nice to people.

Words of truth don't have to come wrapped in complicated
passages and unidentifiable words.  Should I say what I want
through a veil of litterary tools and thereby forsake all
that I believe in?  No.  Do I condem?  No.  Do I rave?

As the sun gropes through the fog which creeps stealthily across the 
battlefield the smell of blood, sweat, and death mixes with the cries of 
dying men whose lives are slowly leaking away.  Lying among the bloated 
and misfigured dead he sits.  His left leg resting bouyantly on the bare 
extended stomach of some dead soldier and his back supported pile the 
piles of dead around him.  He has fainted momentarily from the cadaverous 
stench of putrescence which surrounds him.  He is blind, his eye-sockets 
filled with dark clotted blood from a mortar shell wound.  With a cry he 
awakes and his fingers begin to inspect the area around him as they play 
over the distorted bodies of the men around.  He raises himself with 
difficulty but falls clutching his head.  Then he stands slowly and 
haltingly begins to move forward in a crouching motion much like a 
chimpanzee as he tries to feel his way around.  His eyes begin to bleed 
again and as he sinks to the earth clutching it with useless fervor he 
hears someone call his name.  The call comes again, faint and far away, 
then closer it resounds.  Hysterical laughter fills the valley as one man 
goes mad, for it is not his name but the cry of the vultures.

not the room of me now
but i don't want to grow up
i want to be eight again
just before i got cooties
before i had no friends
when i was happy
when i was unashamed
when i was purely me
and not the me that others made
i admit to being a victim of society
but i'm not going to whine
i am stating a fact
i am not going to blame my parents
i am going to blame myself

It's a place of evil.
They keep telling me not to go there, but I must.
It's the only place where I am comforted.
The memories I experience are much more evil then anything there.
Memories of pain and despair, of awful words spoken and even worse things 
Done.
I lean my head back, close my eyes an let the tears flow so endlessly.
And all the while one word runs through my mind.

Thoughts come flying at her a million miles a minute.
She realizes that she has lost herself in the blackness of the pit.
The voices, the hands grabbing at her in her never ending nightmare.
It's all the same and every day she lives another piece of her dies.
She knows the reason for the pain.
She knows too much, if only the opportunity to sink into oblivion arose.1
She could disappear, she could escape.

Finale

Its staring at you as usual.
Lying there, licking, stretching, staring.
Just like it should.  Nothing out of the ordinary.
How many times have you locked it out?
How many times has it come back to your sleeping body,
perched on your chest, mocking you?
Why not kill it?  You can't.  You can't do anything.

It's not affected by anything you do.
You're affected just by its prescence.
It's taunting you.  Daring you to try.
Why not.  It's the only thing it understands.
Pain, fear, anguish.  Just minor interests.

Does it care really?
Do you even anymore?
It's scarred like you.
Beaten, kicked, abused, forgotten.
Nothing remains but bland disinterest.
Eyes like that should show some recognition.
These are the eyes of a demon.
No fire and brimstone.
No icy stare and hypnotic gaze.
Just a look.  Nothing more.  No emotion.
You might as well be on some petri dish in a laboratory.
At least there you'd have a purpose.   Some direction.

It hears the click.  There!  The bastard finally reacts.
Not much, but it reacted.  It's watching you closer now.
Waiting.
Watching.
Staring.
Daring.
Raving.

You brought it in.
You called it.   It heard your cry.
Time to settle your obligations.
Time to set things right.
You created it.  Your despair conjured it up.
You're the mouse in its eyes.  
Those wicked slits are gazing even more intently now.
It's free if you try for it.  But you know better.
Your the one who called it.   Not outloud, but nevertheless, it was you.
Skin that cat.  Take the goddamned bastard to hell with you.
For once, and for last, you've taken charge.

She sees me.
I thought I was hidden, but she can see me.
Maybe I'm just flattering myself. 
Maybe I'm just afraid to admit that I'm normal.
To think that I don't shine-out and blind everyone scares the hell out of me.

When I was a child, I thought I was the only real one.
The world was mine. Just a figment of my imagination.
Everyone at my beckoning.  Everyone to please me.
Everyone grows old.  Even me though it's hard to face. 
The fire doesn't necessarily die, but it sinks low.
Even one year changes a man tenfold.
Even one love changes a man forever.

Most of the time you can ignore change.
Shells and walls are easy to build.
Once they're up, you gain a certain familiarity.
Familiar ground is comfortable, safe.
It's an overused phrase, but a truth nonetheless.
Sometimes you wake up and look back at what's lost.

There are people I've loved and never said more that 2 sentences to.
But I'll babble with a complete stranger in a bar for hours.
Good friends and family are nice to have.
They think I've taken them for granted.
I haven't.  That's one thing I'll never do, even if they don't know it.
You know what kind of person you are.  Passionate, alive, curious.
Look at yourself through the eyes of those who know you.
I have.  I don't recognize myself.  Not a pitiful sight, just unexpected. 
They've always joked that I'd be the only one happy on a deserted island.
They're probably right, but that doesn't mean I prefer it.
Some things are just too comfortable.
Too safe.

There's a storm coming.  I can smell it.
Is it ozone or something else that makes the hair
on the back of my neck rise up?
I know the fact behind alot of things,
but that doesn't slow my pulse.

Does the wolf know of science and technology?
There's still alot of him in all of us.
Cover it up, be civil.  Ignore the boiling blood.
And we wonder why men can't coexist anymore.
You can't look at someone for 5 seconds without drawing hostility.

I'm gonna run.  I'm gonna be free no matter what the cost.
Should we reject what we've learned?  No.
Should we forget what we already knew?  No.
Even the Lamb knows when to let go.
Have the meek inherited anything yet?

The hunt's going on as we speak, 
only the pack has turned against itself.
Don't deny what's inside.  
Even the predator respects his clan.

The kill is to survive, not for a whim.
The kill is a sacrament, not a vengeance.
Man is a god, but he's got deep roots.
Even a god is bound.  He's tied down by his creations.
Choose, don't hide.

She's standing.
Her legs are strong.
How can one be happy without self-respect?
She knows that it's impossible.
Shes knows a lot actually.

"Bring me a man", she says.
"Make sure that he's hungry."
"Be sure he's strong."
There's no pity in her eyes.
She expects nothing less than herself.
She's reminded of a wise philosopher's creedo:
Before you can say the words 'I love you'
you must first be able to say the word 'I'.
The word is not uncommon to her.
It flows off of her tongue easily.

No standards are too high in her world.
No one doubts her judgement.
Heroe worship, admiration, respect.
These she has.  These she expects.
It's a peer she seeks, not a fixation.
She waits.

Don't look hurt like that.
It tears my soul apart.
If I could, I'd sweep all of the pain away.
I'd gladly take it upon myself.
One second of your joy is worth a lifetime of pain to me.

I've dreamed about it.
I wish for it.
Some don't understand my motives.
I am selfish.  I've never said otherwise.
I live for my own pleasure exclusively.
How can I be more happy if you feel no pain?
I can't.

I'll take your pain gladly and without resistance.
You are the reason I exist.
I see myself all throughout you.

Must I hate if I love?
Dark has no meaning without light.
Full has no meaning without empty.
Would you know the meaning of death with only life surrounding you?
That I cannnot answer, though I strive for the answer.
Yet it's there, behind a veil of love and joy.
I hate.

I hate the fact that I can be powerless at times.
I hate the fact that I can't show you how I feel.
I hate building my life around you.
I hate you for what I've done to myself.
So why am I so happy?

The Gothic Queen 
By: D.W. Dimok, King Jubal Dimok, Wintermoon Riverwind.
 
"Give me instead of beauty's bust,
     A tender heart, a loyal mind,
Which with temptation I would trust,
     Yet never linked with error find-"
-George Darly
 
With a touch of your delicate fingers,
Grasp hold of my lonely hands, 
follow me into the void of life,
there, were the grass is made of crystal,
and the dew a haze of my blood,
a cloud kingdom in the sky,
rose quartz pillars overlook,
pools made of glowing violet water, 
through the spinning nebula of colors.
 
I cry out for you in vain, 
wisdom is my prisoner here, 
the past the manacles on my feet, 
a glowing orb at the heart of the kingdom,
touch it and you will know love, 
my emotions underneath the surface,
and you, the only one worthy of this gift,
on my knees heaving in the castle tower,
all the ancients have taken their toll,
drew blood from my veins & filled the pools.
 
I'm so alone here, but you can't see,
the darkness is chaotic, incessant, 
empathize this sphere of malice, 
my life is as cold as the hard marble floor,
my soul as hollow as the inside of the crypt,
wishing the impossible: for you to know, 
many words pass through my head, 
emotions rise like tidal waves, 
and abruptly shift, berating the sand.
 
looking up into the gray sky, 
a rain appears, remembering your tears,
I cried with you that night,
ripples breaking the walls of my kingdom,
familiar emotion flooding it's lands,
hiding in the shadows was love, 
leaping out, backstabbing me, 
I was helpless, hands locked together with throns,
there sat a silk scarf which mended in it,
where the immortal words glowing bright: 
     Queen Wendiduerr Dimok.
 
my gaze turned into the demons eyes, 
and my tears washed away any hope, 
reality held out a sword of which I yeild,
blood gushing, forming a perfect sphere,
in the center of my estranged tower, 
as I fall onto the marble surface, I cry out:
     I miss ye Wendiduerr, Gothic Queen, of
     whom I love, brought forth from the stars,
     risen from the ashes of the phoenix,
     molded in false beauty, broken by the
     wrath of humanity, it matters no more,
     merely my sacred oath: I love you Wendi.

I'd just got back from riding my bike along the fence line and was
playing pool with Dad and Dave in the basement.  Dave had went half and half
with my Dad on the junkyard on the plot of land across the road.
Mom walked in crying.  "Bill, Fireboss is down by the little creek
behind the barn, I don't think he can get up."
Shit..... we all know what that probably meant.  The horse was around
15 years old and sure wasn't going to see many more.
"He's just lying there!  I don't think he recognizes me!"
We walked over to the creek.  I thought that is was nothing serious
until I remembered how steep the banks were along the creek.  I'd seen him
grow old and scrawny but I didn't think anything serious could have happened.
I'd seen stuff like this before, and stuff always seemed to work out.
I could see right away that I was wrong.  I'd forgot how steep that
the banks could get.  Here he was in a valley between two hills about 30
feet steep.  I had trouble getting down that at my age, let alone as an old
man.
Mud.  Basically, that's all I remember.  An old horse, a creek, and
some mud.

Immedialtely, we knew what had to be done.  He was old.  He'd given
up on life as nature demanded.  I walked back to the house.
It was lying there above the fireplace.  It looked cold.  An old
companion of rabbit hunting, I grabbed it.  A box of slugs, not buckshot,
came with me also.  I'll not lie.  I was crying.  
I made it down the bank and handed the shotgun to my Dad.  I never
want to see that look on his face again.  He couldn't swat a fly without
thinking about it.  This was too real.
Fireboss was lying in agony.  I wish I could say otherwise, but that's
the only word that can describe his pain.  He was dying and he knew it.  I 
know it sounds stupid, but there was a sense of finality in his pain.  The
end was near even without us.
"I'll do it," Dave said.  "It's easier if you're not attached."  
His words made sense, but I could see that he didn't believe one
word of it.  Dave was not a saint, but we'll never forget the thing that he
did for us that day.  I've seen him take a job while collecting welfare, and 
his son and I weren't unfamiliar with the 'five-fingered-discount", but I'll
never say anything against him.  He walked up to the beast that we loved.

My Mom cried and brushed some mud from his forehead and said her
goodbyes.  I stood there, strong, like a man should be, though I was about
to lose a friend.
It took two tries.  I heard my Mom cry out once she knew that the
first shot hadn't done the job.  Dave had the second shot ready in an instant,
thank god.   It was over.  The friend I'd grown up with was gone.
I watched.  I like to think now that it was a last gesture.   I said
goodbye to a friend.  But I was an adolescent, and I know now that is was 
morbid curiosity that made me watch.  We'd butchered chickens and sent 
steers to the slaughter, but this was different.  Much different.

I've caught hell from many people for what we did next, but it was
all that we could do.  I swear this to you:  It was all that could be done.
It's a valley between those banks.  Even a bulldozer couldn't get
down in there and he was lying next to the creek that supplied all of our
animals with fresh water.  I rolled the junk tires down the hill while my
Mom and Dad cut up the two elms that had been lying there for the last
month or so.
After 6 hours and 3 different fires, we took what was left and
put it into garbage bags.  I'll never forget that smell.  Maybe it would
have been better if you couldn't see it from the road.  I started to thank
god that my sister wouldn't be back until tommorow.

He died alone.  I don't care what anyone says.  We were there, his
loved ones, but he died alone.
That's no way to die:  covered in mud, helpless, and in pain. 
I realized this as I carried my grandfather's coffin 5 years later.
He refused all treatments towards the end.  I thought he was crazy.  Now I
wonder if he was.  He held my little cousin in his arms and smiled.  Perhaps
I know now why.  I didn't cry at his funeral.  I smiled.  He died with pain
and that hurts me to no end.  But at least he knew I loved him.  I hope.
I did and I almost told him.  'Course he was just like me.  Hopefully he
can see in him what I saw.  An old friend that I took for granted who left
me and took alot.  I don't forget.  Even though his face fades everyday.

I felt the same feelings as I carried my grandfather's coffin.
He refused all treatment towards the end.  I thought that he was crazy.
I wonder now if he was.
The sons-of-bitches.  I'd told them at the end.  I love them.
What do I get?  Nothing!  Just a last smile, a promise of reunion.
If I catch the son-of-a-bitch that did this I'll tear his heart out.

I light my cigarette,

To bring in the sweetness.
You pull me gently closer,
as I turn 
and tell you how
I love youy.
Two lips touching.
Life blood exchanged.
Your mouth tastes
sweetly of wine and 
sweat.
I curl up next to you
Warmth and skin,
between us, 
shared.

I sleep for hours
pulled to your chest
and wake with sunlight
on my face
As I turn to see
your sleeping form
I smile at my

and ponder
how to wake

She's gone.
I walked away, but she left.
What was I supposed to do?
I know one thing, It wasn't that.

I'm pretty sure I scared her away.
I let too much out of the bag.
How was she supposed to react?
I came right out of the blue.
She never saw it coming.

It always worked in the movies.
I think I almost made it work.
The mystery kept her interested at first.
How do you tell someone who hardly knows you that they're the reason for 
everything you do?
I can tell you a few ways *not* to do it.
Actually, I could tell you volumes.

Why is it that the only thing I ever tried for in my life is denied me?
School, jobs, friends.  I never had to try.
I just wait and things always go my way.
Hell, maybe I shouldn't have tried with her.
I just couldn't take that chance.

I carry her engagement and wedding anouncements in my wallet.
I felt like an idiot clipping them out of the paper.
I am an idiot.  It was 6 months after I had last talked to her.
I think of her everyday.
It sounds like a cheesey romance novel, but I think of her everyday.

I'm safe now though.
I got ironclad excuses not to get involved.
Nine years can provide alot of excuses.
I got plenty.  Trust me, I use them all of the time.

It's not all that bad.
You can turn alot of things off and on in your heart.
It gets easy with practice.
I used to get heartaches.  I'd never known that they actually ached.
Now, sometimes, I don't feel anything.  Not all of the time, but sometimes.
There's no ache.  Just a feelingless empty.  Something's withered.

The body works the same way as the mind.
You can turn it off and on too.
Sure I miss it sometimes.  Actually, I miss the idea of what it must be like.
I guess I shouldn't complain.  Everything else is fine.
I still feel short-changed at times though.
At least I can still feel something.
Getting just a little too self-important..... fuck it.

Of bright steel.  And I know it has to clinch
Your mind in the vise
That was my life.  You filled me up with lies

Well the cop made the showdown
He was sure he was right.
He had all of the lowdown 
From the bank heist last night.
His best friend was a robber
And his wife was a thief.
All the children were killers
They couldn't get no relief.
The bungalow was surrounded
When a voice loud and clear
Said "Come on out with your hands up
Or we'll blow you out of here"
There was a face in the window
The T.V. cameras rolled.
Then they cut to the announcer 
And the story was told.

The artist looked a the producer
The producer sat back.
He said "What we have got here 
Is a perfect track.
But we don't have a vocal
And we don't have a song
If we could get these things accomplished
Nothing else could go wrong."
So he balanced the ashtray
As he picked up the phone
And said "Send me a songwriter
Who's drifted far from home.
And make sure that he's hunger
Make sure he's alone.
Send me a cheeseburger
and a new 'Rolling Stone'."
Yeah

"There's still crime in the city"
Said the cop on the beat.
"I don't know if I can stop it
I feel like meat on the street.
They paint my car like a target.
I take my orders from fools.
Meanwhile some kid blow's my head off
Well I play by their rules.
Thet's why I'm doing it my way.
I took the law in my hands.
So here I am in the alleyway
A wad of cash in my pants.
I get paid by a ten year old
He says he looks up to me.
There's still crime in the city.
But it's good to be free."
Yeah

Now I come from a family
That has a broken home.
Sometimes I talk to Daddy
On the telephone.
When he says that he loves me
I know that he does.
But I wish I could see him
I wish I knew where he was.
But that's the way all my friends are
Except maybe one or two.
Wish I could see him this weekend.
Wish I could walk in his shoes.
But now I'm doing my own thing
Sometimes I'm good, then I'm bad
Although my home has been broken
It's the best home I ever had.
Yeah

Well I keep getting younger
My life's been funny that way.
Before I ever learned to talk
I forgot what to say.
I sassed back to my Mom.
I sassed back to my teacher.
I got thrown out of bible school
For sassing back at the preacher.

Then I grew up to be a fireman.
Put out every fire in town.
Put out anything smoking.
But when I put the hose down
The judge sent me to prison.
He gave me life without parole
Wish I never put the hose down.
Wish I never got old.

well, everyone else is getting on this impromptu thing so i guess i'll hop 
on the bandwagon...here goes nothing...

sing it for the dead man
listen to the tune
echoing
in the small white chamber
of my mind
feel it in my veins
a drug i cannot shake
the dead man knows these things
he whispers to me at night
when i sleep
when i dream
when i'm not listening
when i want him to shut up
he tells me to sing it
his cold bony fingers caress me
and touch me
and make me feel so good
and then when i think he is 
finished with me
he reaches into my chest
tears out my heart
and eats it

hmmm...i have no idea where that came from.  but enjoy it anyhoo...

Here's some new shit from the pixy--AW YEA!!!

There is no facing fate
A deadbeet I am--REPENT!
Oh god do i wish I could, 
And not know of things
As terrifying as eternity.

I was 8 when i saw hell come
By the pool deep as a deadblue sky. 
Forever shouldn't worry kids.
Why did He want to beat up a kid?
But, yes, he surely did. 

And now..now what is there, 
But to suspend my mind, to 
Forget fate? desensitize
And then, yes then, maybe
I can take back my God.

I want to be unaware
I want to be normal
I want to be normal
I want to be normal
I want to be normal.....

Okay, now i'm expecting much and much critical criticisms. Dee, I think

We had an apartment in the city
And me and Loretta liked living there
I'd bee years since the kids had grown
A life of their own
And left us alone
John and Linda live in Omaha
And Joe is somewhere on the road
We lost Davy in the Korean War
I still don't know what for
Don't matter anymore

You know, that old trees just grow stronger
And old rivers grow wilder everyday
Old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say
Hello in there
Hello

Me and Loretta, we don't talk much more
She sits and stares thru the back door screen
And all the news just repeats itself
Like some forgotten dream
That we've both seen
Someday I'll go and call up Rudy
We worked together at the factory
But what could I say when he asks "What's new?"?
Nothing, what's with you?
Nothing much to do

You know, that old trees just grow stronger
And old rivers grow wilder everyday
Old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say
Hello in there
Hello

So if you're walking down the street sometime
And spot some hollow ancient eyes
Please don't just pass them by and stare
As if you didn't care
Say hello in there
Hello

Wanda had a baby in 1951
The father was a stranger
And a stranger was the son
Call that child James Lewis
Call these rooms a home
Changing all those diapers
Polish all that chrome
C'mon baby, spend the night with me

All around the schoolyard
Playing all the games
Running, laughing back and forth
The kid with two first names
Stranger in the closet
Lock the diary
The past is running faster
Singing harmony
C'mon baby, spend the night with me

"God bless this kitchen"
Said the knick knack shelf
"Dinner's almost ready 
Go and wash yourself"
Jimmy's growing up now
And Wanda's growing old
Time is growing shorter
The nights are long and cold
C'mon baby spend the night with me

Sneaking in the closet
And thru the diary
Now, don't you know all he saw
Was all there was to see
The whole town saw Jimmy
On the six o'clock news
His brains were on the sidewalk
And blood was on his shoes
C'mon baby, spend the night with me.

figured i'd better end my song quoting on a lighter note  :)


I got a friend in Fremont
And he sells used cars, you know
When he calls me up
Twice a year
Just to ask me how'd it go
Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
But actually everything is 
just about the same

I met a girl from Venus
And her insides were made of gold
Well, she did what she did
And said "How was it kid?"
And she was politely told
Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
But actually, everything is
just about the same

Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy's ever seen

Molly went to Arkansas
And got raped by Dobbin's dog
Well she was doing good
Till she went in the woods
And got pinned up against a log
Pretty good
Not bad
She can't complain
'Cause actually all them dogs are
just about the same

Moonlight makes me dizzy 
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy's ever seen

I heard Allah and Buddah
Were singing at the Savior's feast
And up in the sky
An Arabian rabbi
Fed Quaker Oats to a priest
Pretty good
Not bad
They can't complain
'Cause actually, all them Gods are
just about the same

Pixy:

I liked this poem...the visual images were good.....although I am not 
quite sure what you meant in it...perhaps this was your intention? I could 
see it being a story told from your perspective...it almost seemed like 
you were describing a near drowning experience, either of yourself or 
someone you knew....was the poem in fact in your voice? And what of the 
stress on "dead", either in sense or word? (Ex. Deadbeet (sp?), deadblue). 
Also, what was the significance in the repetion of the line "I want to be 
normal?"

All in all a nice poem, one that made me think about innocence and how 
much for granted some people take childhood innocence...sometimes the echo 
of children's laughter is enough to remind me of just how much I have 
lost.

Thanks for the poem.....

First let me tell you that I love reading everybody's work on this board.  
I've always had a lot of trouble showing off what I write,  and seeing 
everybody else posting helps with the encouragement.  This one came 
somewhere out of the middle of 4 hours sleep in three days...slap me if it 
ain't that good...

Vision on hand of a mind done cracking
Wish for a washed-out bloodshot moon
Visible traces of my drug inflection
Cleaned ironed faces swim in my gloom
Sidistic paintings torn and shifted
Mine all left and walked away
And still you tell me I'm worth living
Turn off the lights,  I'll fade away

        "It's okay" she screamed
        "Everything is dreamed"
        I just want to wake up for good

Read my lines and said they touched you 
Read my mind and ran away
Take your time to burn what I'm thinking
Ignore the stupid things I say
I run down the opposite highway
I step under oppressive souls
I stay calm with my neck on fire
I stay hidden,  and drowned  in my hole

        "It's okay" she screamed
        "Everything is dreamed"
        I just want to wake up for good

Twist the crawling darkened sphere
Twist the crawling homegrown fear
Turn the craving in your ear
Drown you mind in rancid beer

        "It's okay" she screamed
        "Everything is dreamed"
        I just want to wake up for good

get together for a weekend or so of fun :> The reason the time is still

You Frown God Frowns


White walls covered with
Scarlet, ruby-red stains
Matching my pains.

Echoing hollowed screams
From basal base to crown
And town to town.

Running from danger
Holding in all my anger
Puzzling, Puzzling
You frown.

Yellow rose petals
Vastly scattered on my bed
Screaming in my head.

Molesting good morals
Tempest inviting original sin
Falling again and again.

Running from my humanness
Banished from holiness
Puzzling, Puzzling
God frowns.



I wrote this as a Sylvia Plath style poem for my Contemporary American 
Poetry class last term......I would love to hear some feedback, even if 
you don't understand it (which you aren't really meant to since it is a 
confessional poem and has meaning only to me...you have to know my past in

scarlet and the yellow rose petals scattered on my bed....). Pixy, I think 
it is your turn to do the honors....And anyone else (batt *cough*)

One Perfect Silicon Rose
------------------------

The symbolism of flowers is dead -
  all difficulty in finding beautiful plants
    reduced to a capitalist question
      of grocery stores and corner shops
        exchanging green
        for green.

In barren minds and fertile soil
  lies an emptiness world of meaning -
    where burning romances in heat of lust
      reach past Sony to grasp organic
        choking life
        after life.

Welcome to primitive modern times
  where love entails a movie fare
    and like foolish, foolish natives -
      our hearts are won with trinkets
        filling voids
        with voids.

welllll, speaking of songs, here's one I've been working on but i haven't

this  :)



The Path


In the year they deemed one, there was born a man.
To woman pure of gold, and untaken hand.
One moment with her love, her childhood gone.
A new begining now, she's bourn a son.

He is the man
He'll understand
He'll bring us love and light

My love we've been unclean, no one must know.
To be unwed this way, we must surely go.
The city seems to be, our only hope.
To blend and loose ourselves, somehow we'll cope.

He is the man
He'll understand
He'll bring us love and light

Too many days of hunger, and shattered dreams.
The whole world looks down on us, or so it seems.
My love remember now, those tales of old.
One man will come to us, with love so bold.

The prophet's word
We must be heard
Our son brings love and light

  I looked up on that dark and lonely night
  No magic in the air just a nova so bright

To be raised, as a god, I'm just a man
I feel to, I cry too, someone understand
No way out, I'm caught here, my course is set
To teach love, I must try, there's time to yet




that's about I far as I get.  I just can't seem to end without getting too
bitchy.  I want to keep the sarcasm going, but not too 'in your face'.

oh well, later,

Covenant

I know some of you may not like this, but you might find it interesting.
What the old lady is, it pretty much up to you, but I can't help but
get blown away everytime I hear this.





The Old Laughing Lady

Don't call pretty Peggy, she can't here you no more.
Don't leave no message, 'round her back door.
The say the Old Laughing Lady, has been here before.
She don't keep time, she don't count score.

You can't have a cupboard, if there ain't no wall.
You gotta move, there's no time left to stall.
They say the Old Laughing Lady, dropped by to call.
When she leaves, she leaves nothing at all.

See the drunkard of the village, falling on the street.
Can't tell his ankles, from the rest of his feet.
He loves his Old Laughing Lady, 'cause her taste is so sweet.
But the Laughing Lady's loving, ain't the kind he can keep.

There's a fever on the freeway, blacks out the night.
There's a slipping on the stairway, just don't feel right.
And there's a rumbling in the bedroom, and a flashing of light.
There's the Old Laughing Lady, everything is alright.

She walk's to her day while I toss and turn, dreaming of her...

Close in one sense...too distant on the other...

i've never posted here and actually usually don't let anyone but a couple
close friends read what i write, so here goes:

Self-torn skin
life flows out with blood
burning agony sends tears to eyes
and thrill to the heart.
Energy drains as the body collapses.
The mind quickens, senses become unreal.
Touching the pain brings pleasure,
taste of blood is comfort.
Seeing all is over, why hold back?
Hate, love and fury flood the being
as a last evidence of the soul in the body.
But nothing can be done
as the will is lost
and the lifelong grip on the past
slips into nothingness
without regret. . .

call it depressing, call it cheesy, i call it "Self Torn Skin" for
lack of a better name...

Once I heard a noise

Day.
So there I was
and there she was
and there we was
in my backyard.
And I thought I could seduce her
either that or lose her
it was the next morning by the way.
"I am not of this world," she kept saying to me.  I could see that right 
away.  It might have been her arms.  She had so many of them.  Or maybe 
her bright green, bushy, sharp, hard, prickly, saw-toothed,
 unyielding, definitely unconditioned hair.  It was a mess.  And green.  I 
asked her if she dyed it.  "It's natural," she whispered.  She took me 
into her arms and arms.  She was holding me too tight so I decided to back 
off.
"I am not of this world,"
She was saying to me.
I looked around to make sure that no one saw that I was
talking to the tree.

something to think about when you're lamenting about being so far away from
someone.  

no mater how far apart you are, the moon you see is the one they see, so if 
squinch your eyes up really really tight and try really really hard, you
can see their reflection.  

so, look up at the moon, scrunch up your eyes, and wave

It gets really hot in the city.  At night I just want to take off my 
clothes and walk throught the streets.  Me and Tom and Max (we always 
called him maxi pad) had nothing to do.  So we stole one of my old man's 
bottles and took off in Tommy's car.  It was a piece of shit big assed 
Ford and it didn't have air.  "We ain't got gas to go nowhere. Shit. Let's 
go to the river."  Tommy always wanted to go there.  We all did.  It was 
cool and there were no people.  Once in a while there'd be a deal or 
something but it was mostly quiet.  Tom and me were 20.  Max just turned 
19.  When you're 20 you're too old to fuck high school girls and too 
stupid to get college girls and life sucks.  The river helped though.  It 
was cool.  It wasn't afraid.

Basically, this poem--I wrote the first draft when i was drunk--is an
attempt to grasp what i felt the first time i tried to understand the
concept of eternity. It made me feel hopeless and everything futile. I
could never find any comfort from the fear of eternity, all I could do was
try to forget it. 

Since that first time i felt fear over eternity, ive
only felt that same feeling three times. Usually i can accept the idea
without thinking about it enough to get a panic feeling--that's what i
meant by desensitize--but when it has struck me with panic, the panic and
depression usually last for about two to three months at a time. And that
panic feeling is the worst in the world. I would rather be killed than to
feel the panic of eternity.

So far, I've not met anyone that has this same fear--nor anyone who could
even understand what i was talking about.has understood it the same way i do.
So, i kept it personal. I don't even think i want anyone to understand this
fear of mine--the pain is so awful when it comes that I could never will it
on another. Thus, most of this makes sense only to me, but it is good to
get it off my chest. 

I did another poem about this that i posted maybe thre hundred posts ago.
I made it about loneliness, because most people understand loneliness. I
need to go back and take a look at that one.

This is something I wrote a ewhile ago...maybe art....maybe 
rambling...interesting I hope, and from the ehart...so enjoy.

    Jenna had a revelation. A thought. A random whirring of her mind which 
led to other, more cpomplex thoughts. She was struck with the fact that 
she will die someday. Of course, this wasn't the first time this 
revelation had come to her. Although she was only twenty years old, her 
life had been filled with indescribable pain and trauma. She realized, all 
at once, how totall small she was in the scheme of things - how totally, 
and utterly, insignificant. And for a moment, free of regret and nearly 
without emotion of any kind, she understood that she belonged completely 
to herself. Like her childhood, she had been torn apart and glued back 
together with shame, self-hate and shock.

    She frightened herself with the depth of her anger. It had the 
violence of all unfinished things; of everything interrupted or left 
undone. In this violence there was a sense of yearning - the yearning for 
completion. For an end. For that which is absent, and would, if present, 
bring fulfillment.

    Jenna sat staring out at the rose garden, absent-mindedly hugging ehr 
knees to her chest as she wondered where this anger came from. 
    "Where does it hide?" she asked herself. Some massive knowledge seemed 
to move inside of her, thrusting powerfully up from the depths and 
darkness where it had once been jailed...and all at once, she understood 
that her very existence depended upon keeping this knowledge buried within 
her - in a golden casket within a silver casket within a leaden casket.

    Her anger is a wild beast with claws and teeth, a tiger, and this 
tiger threatened to surge into her conscious mind and destroy her. She 
began panting from the force and threat of this emotion locked away within 
herself. She became aware that she had not fainter or dies, which was how 
she felt, but it was, just then, and only for a second, as if her mind had 
been hurled through some dark barrier. And then, just as quickly, it was 
gone. A thick shield had slammed itself back into place, where it 
belonged.

    Jenna thoughtfully twisted her long brown hair around her forefinger 
as she contemplated her existence. It seemed like she set up situations 
destined from the first to fail. Her thoughts bent towards her 
relationships. She didn't understand this world. All about her were 
creatures of another species, more instinctual, more brutal than her. They 
walk past her...unnoticing, uncaring.

    "It has to do with *inwardness*," she thought to herself. This was as 
close as she could come to a connection. Thise creatures, they were 
external. Her thoughts, though, they lead her inward, and inward is where 
everything important lies. She felt as though her entire life could be 
seen as a demonstration of this priniciple.

    "What matters most about my life took place entirely in my childhood," 
she mused out loud. The world in which she went to work and then came home 
in was the world of public life.  In that world, at least according to 
people like her father, one either "counts," "amounts to something," or 
does not. For one dizzy moment, she could see herslef totally renouncing 
this worthless, superficial world to become a Magellan of the interior.

    Ordinarily, Jenna went through life as if she were inside a 
transparent bubble she herself had created to protect her from pain and 
ridicule at the hands of perfect strangers.
    "Too bad," she said to the sparrow who had flown to the windowsill, 
"that I haven't yet been able to conceive a transparent bubble that can 
withstand the pain and ridicule at the hands of those who say they love 
me."

Here is part two......


    Sighing, Jenna rose from the windowseat, and walked up the back 
stairwell to her old bedroom. Sitting in a corner on the floor, she rested 
her chin upon her knees, unaware of the tears which were falling down her 
cheeks.
    "Here," she thought, "here is my childhood, which I am not intended to 
escape." Its smallness and meanness seemed destined to follow her always. 
She stared up at the ceiling, in that room where her childhood had 
happened, and in her mind she could hear the old screams, the grunts and 
shrieks of pain and passion. *THIS* was the bedrock, the very foundation 
of who Jenna Peters had become....and herchildhood seemed to reach forth 
and touch her with a deathly cold finger.

    Jenna felt these things with very little emotion. She supposed that 
that calm, passive state was a dull version of what most people felt all 
of the time. 
    "It is probably what they call sanity.....sanity is what takes over 
when you get too tired for anything else," she sighed.

    Sitting in that corner, her memories came crashing down upon her. Her 
father had become ten feet tall, and every one of his breaths drained all 
the air from her own lungs. His screams bruised her ears. She could still 
hear her father's huge, punishing voice. The world belonged to people like 
her father, while people like her lived in its potholes and corners.

    Jenna could still hear him screaming at her, in front of the priest, 
in front of the mourners, in front of her fiance. She could hear his 
accusations, feel them like stabs from a sharp dagger...."You killed her! 
You killed her, she worried herself to death over you, Jenna! You are 
worthless! You are nothing! You are dead to me!" Jenna cringed as she 
remembered the shame. She heard his voice, and she felt astonishingly 
small. Her father's voice had the power to pound her into childhood, and 
instantly she was three feet tall and helpless. But these experiences, 
too, can be sealed within a leaden casket, and pushed overboard into the 
great psychotic sea. They are aberrations, silent and brutal exceptions to 
a general rule.

    "What makes anything great?" she asked the ceiling. In her mind, 
understanding is what made anything great. Depth of understanding. 
Unbelieveable responsiveness to detail linked to amazing clarity of 
vision. Sometimes it felt like the world was beginning to shred at the 
corners. The sense of gloom was undeniable for her. She was separate, and 
she became lost in her separation. She remembered her sins, her 
meagerness, her misery. There is something about death which intrigued 
her. Something which burned deep inside. And then her own face appeared 
before her. The first sensation was that of being on the fuzzy edge of 
sleep. Then the layers began. For some they are layers of color and light. 
For Jenna Peters, she seemed to rise endlessly through scenes of ehr own 
life: She saw herself playing in the leaves, making snowballs,
doing homework...trying desperately to please her father...and she cried 
out, having seen the littleness of her own figure and the foolishness of 
all her joys, for they are so harmless yet so damaging. 

    "Maybe this is where my destiny lies," she said, as she picked up the 
razor blade. 
    "I am coming Momma," she whispered. "I am coming home."

Biological warfare

    feels no distinction.
Mind and body pain-ting

pixy,
your journey into the fear of eternity reminds me of the works of 
kierkegaard and heidegger. generally, it follows the angst of 
existentialism in general. see "being and time."  your line about
>I could never find any comfort from the fear of eternity...
was very intriguing. i think that you're right, although you are probably 
correct in saying that no one else can feel it like you can. but, maybe i 
have sat naked, suspended by my own being over the abyss of eternity.
        good luck with your journey

Your hair scratches my lips
I kiss your head
(Out of guilt)
smell of flowers and dust
out of guilt I don't shudder
You stand in that doorway
in my way
in that yellow-white daisy dress

Rambling and rambling one
The grass was taller than your head
Eggs were so much less expensive when YOU were a girl
Quoting from Leviticus
or is it Revelations?
Twisting your face
trying to place mine

Walking into the den together you open your mouth on rusty hinges
I can hear teeth stripping behind your eyes
The hint of smoke acrid in the air I can almost smell
The spark in your eyes you short out inside as you try 
to say hi

All I can see are the walls of your kitchen, Amber fading to mustard,
You've had them for forty years
Hard years since Ed passed on
Bless him and keep him, Lord
Have You seen the bread?

I bought the bread already
It's in the breadbox
No
Not the cupboard
The breadbox
Not the stove
Look. Gram, look
Over here, right
here, in the breadbox, see?
Yes
Yes I did know you were Seventy-Three, Gram
You've told me
Ten times
This morning
Yes, I miss Ma too
No, I don't have a job
I'm Twenty-Two, Gram
No, I like my hair this way
Yes, the milk is in the fridge
Not the sink, Gram
Yes, I did that to my pants on purpose
You don't have to sew them
Yes, I have to go
I know
No, Gram, I'm Matt
Ed isn't here

I don't want to know
The way you feel on a sunny day
The taste of ashes at the end of us
The hopes and dreams and choking poison thoughts that strangle themselves 
out of our souls

Mirror eyes undeath the spaces between you and I
You and I
You and I will die

Waiting a spiderweaver spinning silk from my thorax
White gauze film hairthin in the spiral
Round and about
The web where we lived tears with every word you talk
I can't build webs anymore

Grass green lush and rainfed tendrils
Black in the soil
Down through the earth
Dig through the ground
Spliter the warm brown maplewood of the lid
Feed on the eyes (Baby's blue)
Feed on the skin (Etheral flawless)
Feed on what time left
Grass green lush and deathfed blades sharp in the air

I don't
I can't
I won't let you tell me what I need to know
Sparks Pistons seizing frictionred
Metal melting pitting gouge dragged in the cold
I can't
I won't
I don't add the oil

Missing what we never were 
slivers scattered on the floor
Feet rags as I run to where I never belong
Streakred track me where I hide the stain I leave is mine
I don't want to clean the floor
I can't
I won't
I don't let myself go

I have read up on Kierkegaard in the last year or so. Are you suggesting
that my fear of eternity resembles an existential conflict? Do you mean to
say that it somehow defines me as a person and since no one else feels the
same it is one that makes me unique? The fear makes my life genuine and
original? 

Hmmm....Now there's something to ponder. thanx for the input, alarm.

First impulse was to ridicule

Second thought made me hesitate
for I can even fault myself -
lusting after bodies
with no people in them.

for those of you interested, the poem "Defense of an Art Form" is about an 
"intellectual" trying to defend drug use by comparing it to art.  Organic 
impressionism, he calls it.  And shrugs off the side effects as no less 
moral than having an illness.  a curious effect in this poem is that if 
you take the first letter of each line it spells "Bits of me Dying"  
(Note: not THIS poem as in the one in THIS message, but as in the one a 
few back.  Always remember - convolution is the essence of intelligence - 
and the government is a genius)

   Until recently, I wasn't really sure if I could talk about my past and what
I have gone through with people I didn't really know... But now I think that
I know most of you well enough to share a small part of it with you. 

July 28, 1993

   Such a beautiful night... Walking along the stream, my arm around
Lori's waist, I have never felt better. It's been four weeks since we
met, but I can't imagine life without her. She always seems to know what
I'm thinking and just what to say... Even now, as we walk, she says
quietly, "What a beautiful night... I can't believe it's only been four
weeks since we met." As we gaze at the sky, I hug her a little tighter.
If this isn't love, then love doesn't exist.
   The night sky here is beautiful. It's so clear and bright, and every star
can be seen. I noticed a falling star, flying across the horizon like it was
coming right towards us. "Look at that" Lori said, pointing at it, "isn't it
beautiful?" "Yes," I answered. We stood there, watching it, for several
seconds. Then something in the back of my mind shrieked out a warning.
"Oh my G-d, Lori RUN!!!!" I screamed, turning back towards the kibbutz.
"Why?" she asked, even as she turned and ran with me. I answered, shaken,
"Because that's not a falling star! It's a Ketusha rocket and there's more
of them coming!" We kept running and I prayed that we could get back to the
safety of the bomb shelter at the Kibbutz in time. The one time in my life
that I wish G-d had answered my prayers, he didn't... As I looked back over
my shoulder I saw it, practically right next to us already, and I knew we'd
never make it. I dove for the ground, pulling Lori with me, trying to protect
her with my body so that she wouldn't get hurt. Then it struck. I felt the
blazing heat of the explosion, the broken metal and rock tearing at my skin,
and the intense fear that something could happen to Lori. I lay there,
listening to explosions echoing from around the kibbutz and fearing to move,
lest I stand up only to be knocked down again. And then I saw Lori. I had
managed to cover half of her body with my own, but it hadn't been enough.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I screamed frantically as I saw
the pool of blood coming from a gash in her side. I scrambled forward,
ignoring my own pain, to be at her side. I felt her neck, praying that she
still lived... Finally, after what seemed like eons, I felt a faint surge.
I got to my feet, cradling her limp body to my chest, and ran with all of my
waning stregnth to the bomb shelter. I collapsed a few meters away, unable to
move further. "HELP!" I screamed feebly as I slid into unconsciousness...
  I'm awake now, amazed that I survived at all from what the doctor just told 
me... But I don't care about myself... If Lori dies, then I have nothing to 
live for anyway... It's been ten hours and they're still trying to save her.
When I awakened in a bright room, on a soft bed rather than the hard ground,
my first thought was of Lori. "We're doing the best we can." the doctor said.
But what is the best that they can do?! I have never known such fear in all
my life... If she should die while I live, I could never be happy again.
Why? Why must G-d always destroy what little happiness I have? Every time I
get my life back on track, something happens to destroy it again... I see the
doctor walking down the hall towards my room. I can't stand the fear, the 
fear that he'll say those cruel, forbidding words...
  The doctor meerly said two words... "She's alive." I have never known, and 
will never again know such fear or such relief. With those two words, my faith
in G-d and my will to live were restored. On the brink of utter hopelessness
and despair, they drew me back towards the bright shining star of life. Lori
is alive!

Six years ago,
Joseph stared deep into her eyes;
As his fingers trembled,
Holding out the diamond ring...
Cassi held her breath,
Scared it was only a dream;
Not worth anything...
As the ring slipped on,
She let out a sigh.
It was real.
Joseph held her hand,
And slowly lifted her veil,
Finally  freed from his lonely jail.
As the preacher finally said
This famous last words,
Joseph took Cassi's chin in his hand.
As his lips met hers
In astonishing passion which
She alone seemed to understand.
As they walked back down
The aisle from which they had come,
Joseph was smiling.
Cassi was afraid of her new life,
Would it be true?
Or just another lie in a world of lying?
Then Joseph reassured her
By turning his warm smile on her,
So intense it lighted his eyes.
She brightened her outlook, 
And pit her arm around his waist,
Feeling ready to cry.

They made love on the beach that night,
So tender at first, 
Then made wild by desire.
Joseph moaned as his head bent low,
Wanting to take her again,
His body intense, rapid, on fire.

With one swift motion,
Cassi jumped out of bed.
The dream was so real,
That was all that could be said.
As a tear rolled down her face,
She remembered Joseph, who gave.
Her sweet, beloved Joseph, 
Now six years in his grave...

YOU'RE NOT ALONE

I saw you walking by yourself,
Your eyes were crying out for help.
I know you feel your pain is more
Than anyone's been hurt before...

I know love hurts when it's over,
If you wanna cry it's alright.
You're like a fallen soldier,
But you just can't lay down and die.

You've got to remember,
You're not alone in this world
Always remember,
You're not alone in this world.

The moment that I looked at you,
I recognized the hidden truth.
You think there's no way out,
But if you let me, I can help you now.

Through all these shattered emotions,
There's a lesson to learn.
So come on, let me hold you closer,
Love can soothe what love has burned.

You've got to remember,
You're not alone in this world.
Always remember,
You're not alone in this world.
You've got to remember...
Never alone, never alone, never, never alone....
Yeah....

Got to tell you now,
Through all these shattered emotions,
There's a lesson to learn.
So come on let me hold you close because
Love can soothe what love has burned...

You've got to remember,
You're not alone in this world.
Always remember,
You're not alone in this world.
You're not alone in this world.


Lovingly dedicated to my sis, Faith, from someone who understands the pain

it is in Cincinnati. My home is always open to you.

It is also people like you who make people like me wish they had never 
shared their posts...I think everyone should be able to post on here 
without other people making them feel like shit about it. If you have to 
be sarcastic and bitchy about it, at least take it into email where you 
won't humiliate the person publicly.

oh blah...people appreciate the techies...they're just swell...let's have 
a play where just the techies wander around building sets and changing 
scenes...it'd be really cool :)

having been both a techie and an actor, i'd have to say that being an 
actor for me is oodles more fun...i like being other people, not to 
mention the applause and flowers...;) maybe i would have liked being a 
techie more if they'd let me get my hands on the damn powers 
tools....stike was fun...i like to break things...

               i grapsed the ruby red apple.
            it was so perfect: round, red and firm,
         and it fit so comfortably in the palm of my hand
            
          i waited a moment, anticipating the first bite.     
      i could already taste the sweet sourness of the apple's flesh,

a        fat         horrid     worm squiggled   out of the fruit and fell

Your work was good.  It needed no disclaimer.

I merely feel that if you go out asking for "sympathy praise" in such a 
manner, you will get it, and it will be meaningless.  Let your work stand 
on its own.

I am sorry to be abrasive/sarcastic.  When it comes to casting oneself 
into an identity in order to gain attention, I am as guilty as the next 
individual.  Do not be disturbed or afraid to share your writing, merely 
because of something that some inconsequential net.nobody said.

Obtaining happiness is inherently difficult, because it is not an atomic 
substance like truth or evil.  Rather, it is a heterogeneous mixture of 
such things as excitement, boredom, love, hate, the pleasant, and the 
unpleasant.

Hence, quantifiable happiness can be thought of as a shower that has only 
two temperatures, where both are extremes.  You can achieve a comfortable 
state through a continuous series of burning and freezing flashes, 
alternated in rapid succession.

If it doesn't kill you, it can almost seem like balance.

Somewhere Out There
-------------------

Somewhere out there, beneath the pale moonlight,
Someone's thinking of me, and loving me tonight.

Somewhere out there, someone's saying a prayer,
That we'll find one another, in the big somewhere out there.

And even though I know how very far apart we are;
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star.
And when the nightwind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby;
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky.

Somewhere out there, if love can see us through,
Then we'll be together, somewhere out there, out where dreams come true.





I love you, my sweet prince.

All of my days will be spent
In succulent expectations...

Till I see you again,
My heart will sing little songs 
Of joy and exultations.

No fruit will enhance the joy
Of living as you do...

Till I see you again,
Let me know that all of my hopes
And expectations are true.

Hi everyone...ok, I am posting my first poem here and am a bit nervous. 
Hope you all like it.


At the exact moment when the dream turned into a nightmare life stopped.
And yet now it continues on.
A star has suddenly become a little brighter and we wonder what the 
meaning of it all is.
A flame extinguished makes no sound and yet this extinguished flame was as 
loud as a trumpet on a silent, sunny, morning.
Nothing lasts forever and yet I know these memories and feelings will 
haunt me until I breath my last breath.
And I wonder what the meaning of it all was.

Grind it down
redbrown between teeth we no longer use right
Break it down
take the thing apart and additive it to me
feel it in the sound of tendons shearing
hear it in the taste of uncooked prey

Feed from death
the grimgreen bushes that thrive in the stonegardens do
The brown rips through the terraskin and sinks rootfangs into its meat
the greywriggle pulpae mass eat their fill
Belly up to the death bar
Where all the colors mingle

Green tastes like nothing to me
Water and paper
Strawling draggers across my palate
If it gulped air in great bursts of life
If it strodehugged the ground glad at each step
I want to kill it 
I want to make it me

When I go they'll do the same to me
In tribute
My living breathing moving brothers will chew their fill
Even the stiffbacked watchers will eat
Take this, all of you, and eat it
This is my body
Which will be given up to all of you
As they've given it up to me
At our fraternal sacrifice

Copperbleeding
When I go leave me out for them
Leave me for them
As they have left theirs for me

This was an imitation of Elizabeth Bishop's poem "The Armadillo"

The Hawk
--------


Step by step, they appear;
Every day the same.
Laboring on this dark stage, once a year
Playing this mindless game.

Inside their minds of woe - 
Trappings of mortals lost
Inside stained-glass walls, echoing their fear
Of how much life had cost.

Black velvet sprinkled with
Hope, diamond-esque shaped;
Telling their stories from heaven above;
Crosses bruised, burnt and raped.

Milked for pity and tears - 
Rancid dreams of the poor;
The blood of the rich paying the ransom
Of the head on the door.

Suddenly sky and earth
Are limitless like rock -
Soaring high against the glittering heavens;
A solitary hawk.

*sigh* that sounded bitchy, but I didn't mean to be so caustic. Please 
forgive me....abandonment does that to a girl.

p.s. I liked being behind the scenes better only in drama...in chorus I 
lived being center stage in a solo....

My plan is to find happiness.  If you want to call that a plan.  

It is not a plan so much as an objective... I would usually think of a
plan as steps intended to *achieve* a particular objective.  Yet each
step could in and of itself be broken down into an infinite number of
smaller objectives, which must be executed in order to achieve the
primary objective.  One can wonder whether or not it is truly possible
to have an ideal "plan" in any terms other than micromolecular
movements.

Regardless, I think that the first step of my plan in order to achieve
my objective is to worry less about semantics.

The Ides of March
-----------------


Sometimes
I fear for my sanity
The world is dead to me
As I am dead to the world
I keep falling....
Falling...
Deeper into the black abyss
Funny how every time
I think I've hit bottom
It turns out only to be a
Ledge....
And I always find a way
To continue my descent down
I will never hit bottom
For me there is no bottom
I will just keep falling...
Falling...
Forever into the blackness

The sunlight, golden and red,
Faded as the two walked on,
The dreams they have are great,
To each dream there is a price.
The first price was the hearts,
To one another,
The secaond price was the love,
Each love was new,
The love that each has is different.
His is love of new,
Hers is a love of old--
Time seperates the two,
But both are together in the hearts.
The price was paid,
And each is endebted to the other.
Not for bad reason,
But for their hearts.......


Any way that is one of my poems....:)

Subject: Schindler's List
Date: Sat Jul 16 01:46:14 1994

I know that this is a little outdated, but it's something I wrote shortly 
after seeing the movie...

             "Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"

     Many Jews will recognize this verse as being from the Talmud.  Millions of
people, Jews and Gentiles alike, will now recognize it as the hebrew verse
inscribed on the gold ring given to Oscar Schindler by the eleven hundred Jews
who he saved from death in the Holocaust, just before he fled after the war
ended.  Steven Spielberg's movie, "Schindler's List," was an amazing depiction
of the suffering of the Jews during the Holocaust and one man's fight to save
them.  The history of Oscar Schindler and the Shchindlerjuden, as told in
Spielberg's movie, is a means by which the whole world can be educated about the
Holocaust.  As I was coming out of the movie, I saw the line to get in stretching
all the way around the theater.  In that line were not only Jews, but Gentiles
too.  Spielberg's name lends the movie credence: people will see it. Then, they
will believe it.
     Throughout the movie the person sitting behind me was continually gasping
in horror.  She couldn't believe that it had been that gruesome.  While many
people complain that the killings in the movie were too graphic, I believe that
they were necessary.  The American public has been so sensitized to violence that
it would take something as graphic as seeing somebody shot in their head, with
the blood spurting out into the snow, to shock us.  Thus Spielberg, who until now
has shown hardly any violence (dinosaurs excluded) in any of his films, has
reached out to hit us with what will really sink in--"Schindler's List" will not
be passed off as "just another movie."  When the ashes from the fires at Krakow
were raining down on the car, the woman behind me said softly, terrified, "Oh my
G-d, those are ASHES..." and then faded into stunned silence.  The movie, even
in black and white, was just so real that, although it was unbelievable, it had
to be believed.
     I came out of the movie feeling more emotionally drained than I have ever
felt before, and thinking very much about what I had just seen.  I now know that
my decision not to go to Poland this summer, just to go on USY Israel Pilgrimage,
without the trip to Poland was a wise one--I wouldn't have been able to handle
it, at least not yet.  I also thought about two very important words:  NEVER
AGAIN.  This is a promise that every Jew makes to himself, and to the world. 
However, it is a promise being broken, even as I am writing this, right before
our eyes.  Today in Bosnia crimes just as atrocious, if not more so, as those
committed during the Holocaust are taking place.  We can not, as Jews or as Human
Beings, stand by and watch it happen.

      My heart still beats inside my breast
      While friends depart for other worlds.
      Perhaps it's better - who can say? - 
      Than watching this, to die today?

      No, no, my G-d, we want to live!
      Not watch our numbers melt away.
      We want to have a better world,
      We want to work - we must not die!

     These are the words of a 12 year old girl, Eva Pickov, during the
Holocaust.  There are people, children, in Bosnia today, who feel the same way. 
If we stand by and watch them die, then we are no better than the nazis
themselves, for the Jews had people like Oscar Schindler, but the people of
Bosnia have nobody but the rest of the world.

Your eyes ask questions,
Qusestions of past and persent,
Like a great bird wanting to be free,
Your eyes want to feast on the soul.

I want to give you the eternal gift,
But what will you give me?
You bring me pain and hurt,
Everything is good or bad,
Like flowers in a field,
The desisons are plucked.

Every tear drop we have shed,
Is all the gift need to grow,
Teardrops, teardrops, lovely teardrops.....

            Hurt

Why did you hurt me?
All you wanted to do was see,
A little girl hurt.....
You took all my childhood dreams,
All the time laughing at my expence,
You thought I would crumble--
But you were mistaken....
Your hurt made me strong.
Everytime I think of the hurt,
I think of my best friend,
He never left me in all the pain.
No matter what He loves me,
And He still does....
Some of the hurt has disappered ,
With His divine grace.
He loves me and even you--
So the hurt is gone--
You are forgiven by me and Him.........

Late at night, on the farm
when there's no more work to do
and the chilling of the evening
starts to get the best of you,
you can hear them in the meadow,
you can hear them in the corn
with their tuba and their clarinet,
accordian, and horn.
You know that they are out there
and will play until the dawn.
Even thought you think they're pretty good
you wish that they were gone
off to where it is pigs go
at this late time of night.
Oh why can't they be sleeping?
It really isn't right
for piggies such as them
to be honking and tubaing and drumming and clarineting
and dancing and frolicing it's REALLY upsetting.
In the daylight, they're nice
as they grunt and they wiggle
but at night...if you have good ears...and listen very close...and get 
real..real quiet
you can hear the piggies giggle
AS THEY SING AND THEY DANCE
AND THEY PLAY AND THEY SHOUT!
I DON'T KNOW WHY I STAY HERE!
I'm moving out.

STONEWATERBOY

The boy rimed
slowcarvened from whiteblue
glacial ice never thaws
never melts while it flows like a tortisea
Missisippi of Kelvinized water
pushed along oldest brown on earth
rocks from time mammals
had scales under thier fur
so slo

form pushed 
by
the 
weightwaves oldest crest on the surface
colder than space
glacial mass contorts
mountains in his frame
moving slowest
never stops cannot fall
glacier presses on
and
on
like an unwanting implanted 
childparent
boy is cut from the mass
without fail
it presses on

Nothing will deter him
        can halt the advance
Made from neverliquidatedry Hydroxygen
The bones of Ymir
Quailing 
Squeezing on until kisses ocean brother
Nothing
an absenteed-off broodmare can inflict
with tongue or hands
can prevent
the flowing of the ice up north
in his veins

Title: Rememberance
Author: HCoyote
 
I looked into the glinting blade.
The past hurdling through my eyes
I saw the pain she caused
Why did she hurt me?
 
I gazed into the shimmering edge,
Longing to find the goodtimes
     That I once knew.
Alas, I found none.
 
My life...
Full of pain...
Is not worth living.
 
I gazed into the murky sharpness of the knife.
Crimson red flowing down onto my bloody hand
I didn't feel the pain.
I couldn't feel the pain.
 
I took my last glimpse...
     A glimpse of the stars above.
 
I close my eyes
And fall asleep...
 
 
Forever.

blueblack birdling tear at the air with dead wings

There is one thing that all need to know about me..I love mythical 
creatures, such as unicorns and dragons....:)


              Unicorn

The sound of thousands of hooves, sounding like thunder,
Ligth and airy in their cause, 
White an puredare their hearts,
Color of every color in thier tails,
Might steeds of the gods,
Unicorns as they are called.
The grat gigt fom the Great Spirit  his peolpe,
Like a dream, not yet awaken,
The unicorn runs in the starry sky.
Showing the way to the pure of heart,
The unicorn is part of the world between dream and wake,
The truth they prevail is astonishing to imagine.
The unicorn also showes faith a hope..........

Right Here Waiting
------------------


Oceans apart, day after day....
And I slowly go insane.
I hear your voice on the line,
But it doesn't stop the pain.

If I see you next to never,
Then how can say forever?

Wherever you go,
whatever you do,
I will be right here waiting for you.
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks,
I will be right here waiting for you.

I took for granted all the times,
That I thought would last somehow.
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears,
But I can't get near you now.

Oh, can't you see it baby?
You've got me going crazy...

Wherever you go, 
Whatever you do,
I will be right here waiting for you.
Whatever it takes, 
or how my heart breaks,
I will be right here waiting for you.

I wonder how we can survive this romace...
But in the end if I'm with you, 
I'll take the chance...

Wherever you go
Whatever you do,
I will be right here waiting for you.

Whatever it takes,
Or how my heart breaks,
I will be right here waiting for you...

Waiting for you......

Sometimes there's nothing to feel
    (i'm in the room without a view)
Sometimes there's nothing to hold
    (in the room without a light)
Sometimes there's no time to run away
    (i'm here for one more treacherous night)
Sometimes you just feel so old
    (my soul is cut and broken, cold)

The times it hurts when you cry
    (tonight i'm feeling like an animal)
The times it hurts just to breathe
    (tonight i'm howling inside)
And then it seems like there's no one left
    (i never wanted it to end like this)
And all you want is to sleep
    (six feet deep beneath the street)

Fight
    (push it away)
Fight
    (push it until it breaks)
Fight
    (don't cry at the pain)
Fight
    (or watch yourself burn again)
Fight
    (just fill up the sky)
Fight

So when the hurting starts
    (tonight i'm screaming like an animal)
And when the nightmares begin
    (tonight i'm losing control)
Remember you can fill up the sky
    (all i want is to be with you again)
You don't have to give in
    (tonight, oh i'm getting so low)

Fight
    (push it away)
Fight
    (push it until it breaks)
Fight
    (don't cry at the pain)
Fight
    (or watch yourself burne again)
    (or watch yourself burn again)
    (or watch yourself burned again)

Fight!

I agree.....their lyrics are haunting but they have a sort of "gritty" 
side to them too.....I think that the Cure has helped me in my times of 
depression too....do you know what song got me hooked to them (and which 
still remains my favorite...rhetorical question of course)? "Just Like 
Heaven" which actually got into mainstream Top 40 stations....kinda 
shocking...but I love the imagery in that song...

"Daylight licked me into shape,
I must have been asleep for days,
And moving lips to breathe her name,
I opened up my eyes.
And found myself alone, alone,
Alone above a raging sea,
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me."

Incredible.....love lost. love mourned but also love cherished and love 
remembered.....all poetically, tragically, beautifully woven together to 
create images soft and blurred yet sharp and distinct (Quite the 
dialectical score....hehehe)

Enough ramblings....

It's easy to hate... Loving somebody is a lot harder. Many people
never take the time to get to know someone (or a group of someones) before 
they decide to hate them. It is this ignorance that causes hate. For 
instance, my co-worker has remarked several times to me about how he hates 
Jews, although he has yet to come up with a reason why. When I tinformed 
him that *I* was Jewish he almost flipped... If you can't even tell that a 
person is a member of group that you supposedly hate, theen you have no 
business hating them at all...

just a thought that struck me when I read that post...

This is a poem that I wrote this week...tell me what you think...:)

Teardops falling down her face,
She can see the fear in his eyes,
He doesn't want to hurt her,
But hurt her, he must,
To prserve his own heart.

He wants everything that she can give,
He wants to give nothing in return,
She can feel herself slipping away,
She can not find the right path.

He realizes the ultimate truth,
She gives the last that she can,
He decides she is worth all the pain,
She decides he is worth all the sorrow,
They come together in the perfect union,
To be with one and for one forever.



Anyways that is my poem...:)

Why do you hide in the shadows?
There is nothing to fear--
Or so they they say.
Others do not understand the problem,
The bertayl of one,
The forgiveness of the other.
Past is forgiven, but hard to forget.
I want to be whole again,
But with the pain, how can I?
All you did was destroy,
You think that now I am a lost child,
You are wrong!
The hatered that I have for you,
Has made me strive,
You thought I was a sill child--
And I would not know right from wrong,
You took my most precious gift,
And you thought it would be alright,
Now I feel like a half person,
But now my soul is finding its soulmate,
Even though you destroyed part of it.
Every night I cry for taht lost child,
The one that you created,
You laughted and forced,
But why?
What was running through your mind?
As you took my chilhood,
Dreams torment me, 
Because of of the images of hurt,
I hate you!
All you do is laugh at me in my dreams;
But you did not count on the white knight.
As the deams started ,
He would come in and save this child.
So be gone with you--
You are not here in the present.
So disappear into the shadows,
You firey beast of torment--
Go back to your master--
And leave this child with happiness in her heart!

Anyways that is my poem....what do you think it means?

A girl sat
Her hair disheveled
Tears wanted to roll down her face
but they wouldn't come.
Inside, feelings brooded
No reason.
At least not that she could see.

It hurt.
Tears rolled.
but Nothing was achieved.
She forms a question
but it is never asked
It continues to brood inside of her.

Its like hate that comes from nowhere
She wants to scream
She wants to tear things up
She wants to get this feeling out of her body.
She feels so lost
So trapped within her own body.

listening to the new tape I bought called "Catching Up With Depesche 
Mode", I heard a song of theirs which I hadn't heard in quite a few years 
called "Somebody" which I decided to post here because I feel the same and 
it is a beautiful song.

SOMEBODY
--------

I want somebody to share
Share the rest of my life
Share my innermost thoughts
Know my intimate details
Someone who'll stand by my side
And give me support
And in return s(he'll) get my support
She will to listen to me
When I want to speak
About the worlkd we live in
And life in general
Though my views may be wrong
They may even be perverted
S(he'll) hear me out
And won't easily be converted
To my way of thinking
In fact, s(he'll) often disagree
And at the end of it all
S(he) will understand me

I want somebody who cares
For me passionately
With every thought and with every breath
Someone who'll help me see things
In a different light
All the things I detest
I will almost like
I don't want to be tied
To anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to stay clear of those things
But when I'm asleep
I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me
And kiss me tenderly
Little things like this
Make me sick
In a case like this
I'll get away with it



Enjoi,

Dee

Screaming inside a mind that holds many rooms
Counting one, two, three, four.....

Why didn't you just take my heart and shred it
Shred it from inside to outside, circumfrance to core?

Oh! I see, you already did shred it...I thought it was confetti
Counting five, six, seven, eight....

Why didn't you just leave me to cry
Cry from truth being told cold straight?

Oh! I see, you did leave me to cry...I thought it was rain
Counting nine, ten, eleven, twelve....

Why didn't you just turn your back
Turn your back on an ocean into which I delve?

Oh! I see, you did turn your back...I thought it was love.
Counting...too tired to count anymore...the numbers run into one another.

she cries and noone has

full moon

she sits and wonders

waiting only makes her heart
stiffen and quake

Sure. However
Suppose all are happy in comfort and the pangs of misunderstanding.
Are the misunderstandings of all those beatnik brats? And subtle is the
perfect way.

Could be, yet
I find a more than subtle joy in broooding, one that stings like a

THE GAME
--------

It's too late for prevention to start with the cure,
You used to be so innocent, you used to be so pure.
But funny how time will change your ability to endure,
And subdued insinuations drown your dream to be secure.

Then pain and fear surround you, and with their taunts they bruise,
They lead you by the hand, and then unmercifully accuse.
They dazzle you with speeches of amazing eloquence,
They dance all around you, and steal your innocence.

They trick you every time, and yet speak to you of love,
They spit upon your face, yet hold their hands to heaven above.
They say to be like them you must learn to walk the earth,
You must feel every pain, and you must die a fiery birth.

You don't deserve to live unless you learn to play the game,
You, too, must hurt with words and dance around the empty flame.
And once that starts to happen, you become a mindless slave,
With one hand in the fire, and one foot in the grave.

Dance freely while you can and then learn to bury hope,
They know you want to hang yourself, they offer you the rope.
You looked to them for love and found hatred in disguise,
They laugh at your pleas for mercy, they taunt you with more lies.

And as you near the end of it all and begin to clear the stage,
You see the way you lived your life inside a tiny cage.
And while your dying heart gives in to total mortal fear,
Your only course of action suddenlt becomes so clear.
"THERE ISN'T ANY ROOM FOR THE UNFORGIVEN HERE."



This peom pretty much says how I feel about hypocrisy...I used the church 
for two reasons, one very personal, and the other being that it makes an 
easy target.

This poem is dedicated to Donna and Johnny Goldsberry. Only they know the 
influence they have had upon my life.

well i am in the best mood for writing so here goes....

i feel you slipping away
a subtle word
an unglanced glance
you never call anymore
you just leave me in the dust
swirling round my feet
with nothing left to hold

stripped of everything 
i ever had 
you drive away 
carrying it all in your backpocket
the only thing i wanted back
you never will return
there is emptiness here

it happens so slightly 
the messy way we fall
out of love...
a single word not taken
at face value
read into and expanded
this place can never fill

standing naked
without anything 
with nothing
you came and swept me 
off my feet
and decided to stay awhile
to take more than just
my feet when you finally left

one note on your 1st line...there is a song by Sinead called "You Cause as

I have expunged many things
Buzzing bastardbugs that swarmfly of all types

The tiny gracile neck of the feathered friend in my hands
crunches like celery as I twist his head off
black dropps his head in the bucket
Leading the dull eyes
of the brownwhite "Missy", foure hooves her crime
small horns proud on her head
into this cement room the old stains greygreen everywhere
The drain buzzing with bugs 
the showerheads still here rustedcrusted over
Her eyes are deeper than mine
The silver plated Colt
.45acp kicks twice as I pull the trigger and the shots
punch though the front of her skull
showers the room in flakes of bone and horn
I swiftpierce the legs with the deadfall and hoist her
I used to ride her up the backhills
up over the drain as she drowns the flies
dirtyblack blood on the floor the walls my legs hands face
on my hearts
The wheels of her eyes dead
I own death
so much I carry it like a cloud when I eat

tigh, round, and to the point
very nice, on a sunday afternoon
it's only your mother
only the driven woman
The bitch from hell, to put it lightly
spacial frequencies
pyromaniac on a distant pyre
I remember the day when she gave me life
when she tore me down, when she lept
gracefully out of the
wedding cake
and deigned to dance with me
and sat upon the tree limb and broke down in tears
tears of blood of anguish
made hard by the fact that
I tried and failed
I am a failure
To protest and dismay and start the roaring fire again
the crow speaks in a different tongue
on the day of judgement

He invades my dreams,
Every night I see his beautiful face,
He doesn't say a word.
One dream, I asked ..."who are you?"
He says nothing, just smiles,
He continues with his task,
To make me feel safe at night...
He answered me unexpectly one night...
"I am your strenght,
I am your love,
I am your own true heart..."
I was amazed.....
So every night,
I see this stanger and friend,
He is always there......

Well tell me that whatcha think...still working on it...:)

Just a thought....your work is very good, but sometimes a little 
"talky"..not that that is bad, per se, but have you given any thought to 
imagery? I sent some lyrics of mine to a singer/songwriter with whom I had 
been corresponding with. He gave me some of the best criticism I have ever 
gotten on writing lyrics/poetry. He told me to "paint a picture" in the 
reader's mind. Don't just tell them something, but make them SEE it...

Like I said, it is just a thought. Your poetry is very good all in all!

the only ones who write them anymore? (and i write them badly) just me 
going on about what i like and don't like as much in poetry...i do NOT 
subscribe the the notion that anything that you write is poetry.  i had 
teachers who told us that, and to be honest, i'm ashamed of what i wrote 
then.  i destroyed it all...  poetry comes from 'the foul rag and bone 
shop of the heart' (to quote you know who), for me, anyhow...the idea of 
making a thing of beauty ot of the squalor and ugliness that is inside 
myself is what makes me write poetry.  now i know that others don't feel 
the way i do, and i respect that right.  but it'd be nice to find someone 
else who feels the same way i do...*sigh* i've about had it with modern 
poetry (and it's all eliot and pound's fault, darn it...you know i HAD to 
bring them into it *smirk*)...it doesn't speak to me...it's as if i'm 
stuck back in time...and i know a lot of what i write is very modern 
poetry, but that's because altho i think in the ways of other times when i 
write poetry, my voice is of the present...

did this make any sense to anyone other than me?

I can tell by the look in your eyes you've been hurtin'
You know I'll never let you down...oh, no
And I'll try anything to keep it workin'
You gave me time to find out
What my heart was lookin' for
And what I'm feelin' inside

In your eyes
I want to see your love again
In your eyes
I never want this feeling to end
It took some time to find the light
But now I realize
I can see the heaven in your eyes

Can't you see I'm finding it hard to let go
All the ehartaches
We've been through
I never really thought I'd see
This love grow
But you helped me see
Now I know what my heart's
been looking for
And what I'm feelin' inside

<chorus>

We've been livin' on the edge
Where only the strong survive
We've been living on the edge
And it's something that we just can't hide
Oh this feeling inside

In your eyes
I want to see your love again
In your eyes
I never want this feeling to end
It took some to find the light
But now I realize
I can see the heaven in your eyes
I can see the heaven in your eyes



Keep smiles on your face and love in your heart, for love and joy can 
never lead you wrong......

you know, you've got a point Natalie.  I agree that the word 'poetry' has
become too broad.  The 'and creative writting' in the title of this group
is the only thing that I feel allows me on here anyway  :)

to tell the honest truth, i wouldn't know a good poem if it bit me.  but,
to coin an old phrase, 'I may  not know art, but I know what I like".  :)

the way I see it, is that writting is an emotinonal release for me.  I'm in the
engineeering/physical sciences so I really have no knowledge of the 'arts'.
Plus, the last thing I want to do is 'think' about my emotions  :)  writting 
sortof does that for me though.  I guess I'm just saying that writting is fun
because I don't know what I'm doing.  

However, I have the utmost respect (and a little envy) for those people who
can actually read a poem and understand it.  To prove my point, I'll ask 
this question:  What the hell is a sonnet??  :)   Is that when a poem 
rhymes?  I am completely art-illiterate.

see you all this September,

in the readers eyes and making them experience something that they have 
never experienced before..I like the reference to an anonymous

I see broken promises coming from the dead
heady sweet aroma in the night
chasing me away in my flight
I feel and I choke and I scream
I am not at all what I seem

crazy days, broken tongue

achtung baby selfless denial
stay away from me, or I will defile

the clean tombs, the clean rafters

calamity on the road in my mind
I need to be with my kind

on the morning, in a pool of blood

I talked in my sleep one night, as I lay in my rumpled bed
my lover by my side, my sleepless feelings collide
passion brings out my animal instinct, my black nature
the peaceful descends, the waking prevails
I gather my dear in my arms, in a graceful gesture
I carry her away from the evil of the snake people
weeping fills my ears it is all I hear, so I run with my lovers body
in my arms
her pale blue eyes open in wonder and suprise, I kneel next to slender 
figure, hers
I watch the slow movement of her breath rise her chest and fall
her lips half parted in a mournful sigh, in envy
I lick the remnants of the last night and, as I lay, tired
and weak, I feel her life in me, and her soul in mine
the waking sun collides with me and I run to the 
mansion, of my destiny
my followers, leave the good, and I shall 
I shall
the portent of mystery hangs in the sweet melodramatic air

I am sitting in a pool of blood
thinking about all that has happened
remembering days when it was all so easy
I am in utter despair, a hole as deep as any pit in hell
My love has abandoned me
My life has fallen around my feet, in shambles
all I want is a little bit of love, a tender heart to cry on
all I need is someone to listen someone to talk to me about themselves
and us, and death, and life, and sex
and it all adds up to a hole in my heart as big as a galaxy
and I feed, my lusts, my innermost desires
a frenzy, a killing frenzy
my mind has gone blank, my aching heart is in pain
I scream to the gods for help
they laugh, and go there own ways


I am alone


alone, in my pool of blood

ok, this is a base for criticism, right?  from what i've read, your poetry 
seems very derivative of others' work.  while you have strong imagaery and 
a good sense of language, when i read your poetry i can't help but 
thinking i've read it, or something LIKE it before.  you've read a lot of 
the romantics, haven't you? and a bit of anne rice, as well (gee, that was 
hard to guess :) ) but i'm not saying this to be mean or to cut you down, 
just to point out to you whati notice.  but i also gather you're just 
starting out, so it's ok to be somewhat derivative of your influences. but 
you HAVE to find your own voice if you want to get anywhere.  i've been 
atthis for god knows how long and i'm still trying to distance myself from 
my influences (yeats and the romantics) in order to find my voice.

Since I loved you
And you may go on and do something
I won't kill you
even though you've killed me
I'll just take this blue black stygian hand me down
this 2 guage lead thrower my grandad let me have when the
cancer was done turning his skin yellow and his bone green,
and I'll place this baby nice and gentle against the thin back of my 
mouth
and I'll say hello to Satan for you

I've got an ex-girlfriend who has to live in my apartment because the 
shithole she's been seeing is a nutcase who can't accept it is over. We 
don't feel anything but friendship, in case people think she left him for 
me...but the Restraining order is a joke, he ignores it, the cops hesitate 
to do anything cause it's DOMESTIC...and Equality aside, he weighs a 
hundred pounds more than her, and is sick. She can take care of 
herself...but he's willing to kill her.

Now, I've been dumped a lot...and it never occured to me that by attacking 
the person who did it I'd change their mind about me....but that's how 
some men think. So now she has to live in my apartment...(She still has 
her own, but her roommate is alone there with HER boyfriend at the 
moment...It's like we've circled the wagons.) If he comes HERE looking for 
her, I don't know what I'll do, but he won't enjoy it.

Matt, I can understand your ex-girlfriends position COMPLETELY...an ex of 
mine has been stalking me for the past two years, and back in May
 he up with me finally in a deserted lot at school. I will spare you the 
gory details but suffice it to say that I ended up in ICU for a while. The 
asshole has yet to be caught by the police (who aren't looking very hard I 
might add), and he left a nasty note on my car last night telling me I was 
going to regret going to the police about the incident in May. The police 
won't do a damn thing to help me...I dont know why I am telling you this 
except to say that I understand where your ex-girlfriend is coming from.


Sincerely hoping all goes well for you both...

      once upon a time there was a slug name pete
      he slimed all through the forest searching for something to eat.
      and when he finally found a tree stump that looked mighty good,
      there came a troop of boy scouts who smashed him flat for good.

      this story's a bit grisly, and i know it sounds quite grim,
      but think about pete's fate and hope you don't end up like him.
      but sometimes such things happen, and that's just how it goes,

They left their bodies to fatten the wolves,
They left their homesteads to fatten the foxes,
Fled to far countries, or sheltered themselves
In cavern, crevice, or hole
Defending Ireland's soul.

Is this tension I feel? do I kneel to

or Am I alone? Can I feel the great expanse of hostility, the bleak pages
If only I could sink into your embrace, forgetting
touching your delicate face...
my blind ambition, leads me astray from the true goals
the only real purpose
pretending, it all begins, and it all ends
deception, black misunderstood truths, I only shake my head
I am alone in this world, my thoughts my own and only that
alone
and true blackness of heart only seems pale to my agony
misaligned, I am so very tired
I am so very tired and sad and scared and lonely
all alone
relieve my tension
because I love you
let me scream out and turn loose the torrent of
my black sad heart

you should hear what's been done to some of my stuff.  (not on this borad, 
but in classes).  ans we're talking an hour of people dissecting your work 
while you can't say a word.  but the most important thing i think you need 
to do is to find your own voice.  your influences are importanat, yes, but 
you need to speak in a voice that is your own.  otherwise you'll never get

i said it was derivative.  you don't need to read a lot of poetry to do 
that.  if just one poem by someone sticks in your head and you go to write 
a poem, that poem may end up being similar in ways to the one you read.  
which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  i've written poems like that, but i 
usually do it on purpose, to comment on the poem.  but keep with it, you 
aren't doing all that bad for someone just starting out...i was much worse 
 (well worse isn't a good word, but i'm too tired to think of a better 
one, i mean my work was on a much lower level than yours is, shit that 
still don't sound right.  i'm not insulting you here, i'm just super 
tired) than you when i started, i'm ashamed to admit i wrote some of the 
stuff i did.

Can see blue between them, more shifting
Each crack comes from somewhere inside my chest, and I don't

EVery noise comes with a kaliedescope flash of orange blue
Reminds me why I swore off dating

We'll Say Goodbye
-----------------



We've come too far to let this moment go by unnoticed
The tears that fall are tears of goodbye
A final embrace, words to be remembered
Farewells are so hard, we can't help but cry

Falling teardrops worth a thousand words
A thousand words we're too afraid to say
We may never pass this way again
So we'll say goodbye and sadly walk away

The words of a song bring back the fading memories
But dimly reflect how we truly feel
We had one chance to make it last forever
Hold onto your heart, this parting's all too real

Falling teardrops worth a thousand words
A thousand words we're too afraid to say
We may never pass this way again
So we'll say goodbye and sadly walk away

Hearts bruised and battered, enotions overflowing
We're afraid to let the hurting show
Tears falling soft, like rain upon a forest
It's hard to do, but we have to let go

Falling teardrops worth a thousand words
A thousand words we're too afraid to say
We may never pass this way again
So we'll say goodbye and slowly walk away
We'll say goodbye
Yes we've said goodbye
We'll say goodbye and slowly walk away.




This is a song I wrote....I have finally learned how to let go. I hope 
this song speaks to you as much as it does me. I have finally found the
peace I was looking for...funny, it was inside me the whole time. I had to 
find it within myself.

*hugs* to BlueMax, Faith, Skywise, Natalie, and especially Zippo for 
helping me through one of the most difficult times in my life. I love you

BlueMax,

I think you will understand the origins of this poem, as will Faith and 
Natalie and Skywise and even hawke......



KALEIDOSCOPE
------------


i am like a kaleidoscope
many colors and many parts.
some very close in hue
some very different.

sometimes parts group together
and form an organized pattern
other times it is just chaos
with each piece going its own direction

some patterns are beautiful
and make sense.
some are so scattered, there
seems to be no semblence of sanity.

...ever turning, ever changing,
stability merely a dream so far away.

people use the kaleidoscope
to try and find the pattern of their desire.
but often the pattern is not there
and they go away.
other people are happy just to see the colors
and stay around for a while.

how do you make the green pieces
   into pink pieces
   into blue pieces into yello pieces...

or do you?






So all, whatcha think (especially those who know what the poem is about).

Enjoi,

Dee

Well sweetheart, I think I have a good understanding of the kaleidoscope
and I think it was very intuitive.  I just hope you see that I'm not one 
of those who wants to find a certain pattern, nor am I one who just wants 
to stick around for a while to see what beautiful colors I can see.  I 
want to be here for you and all your beautiful colors!

on my back
your hand

i'm not alone
as i was before
i am with you
and i know it's not
going to last
but i don't care
i take the opportunity
and there are no regrets
i do what i must

you have to understand
that is how it happened
and i'm alone again
waiting 
and waiting
endlessly waiting
you have to understand
i'm not perfect
no matter what you think
i get lonely sometimes too
and i do what i must
you have to understand

here goes

   CLUTTER MY MIND WITH MEMORY 
   ***************************

When I was with you
I felt small pink and clean
Your weight felt all over my
existence
The bite impression should not
fade from my eyes
As it dwindles
your weight leaves my
soul

As i drove home your
memory
was sitting with 
me
in pain and wanting

The water ran hotly
Hurting my frozen feet
as it spilled down my shoulders
I felt a 
loss of you and what
I'd asked
for

Now as I sit 
waiting for your presence
to
bewilder
me into stunned 
silence
I feel
anticipation and fore-
thought
clutter my mind with 
memory.

Chained myself down
The whispers wrap hissing around my thighs
strap across my skin bleaching the color
Tie me down with my words
Make me believe in my worthlessness canary yellow my eyes of doubt
Blacker than the obsidian you slide in my chest
Divine the future with the slickropes of my guts
roll the bones with mine

I held me down so you could kill me
I held the gun
I pointed it
I pulled the trigger
But it was the world that killed me
Out of fear

BTW: That's another of my "On THe Spot" Type poems....I haven't written 
anything but fiction lately off of Yabbs...But someone I talked to 
yesterday (No Names) was convinced he was stupid and worthless just 
because that's what they teach those of us who are better so we don't 
supplant them...and it affected me.

here's more from that series i started with "Clutter my mind with memory"

closing my eyes to the outside
beating strumming, musing
searching the room for a note
not paper, a note
pouring the whole into it
    the voices are driving me to insanity
    a frenzy next door is frustrating and annoying
they play without a meaning or purpose
scratching and pounding to find a reason
for itall
it escapes them and they feel all
the more empty for it
napkins cannot keep the mess in
    can't you see he wishes to be left alone?
    leave him alone. can't you take a clue
    from the mournful expression upon that
    thing that mirrors his troubled soul?

that is the very first on about 20 or so to come ..if you get sick of it 
just yell....

you start to cry in my black-grey dreams

OUT HERE ON MY OWN
------------------
Sometimes I wonder where I've been
Who I am, do I fit in
Make believin' is hard alone
Out here on my own

We're always proving who we are
Always reaching for that rising star
To guide me far and shine me home
Out here on my own

When I'm down and feeling blue
I close my eyes so I can be with you
Oh baby, be strong for me,
Baby belong to me,
Help me through
Help me need you

Until the morning sun appears
Making light of all my fears
I dry the tears I've never shown
Out here on my own

(chorus)

Sometimes I wonder where I've been
Who I am, do I fit in
I may not win, but I can't be thrown
Out here on my own

Ok, I know this is a cheesy poem..but I have to share it with y'all don't 
be too critical of it. *grin*

Mere worannot express how thankful
I am you have entered my life.
My friend, my dearest friend, I love you so.
When I think of you my heart sings 
With joy.
My friend, my dearest friend, I love you so.
And oh if only I could find the right words
To say, give the feelings a voice.
My friend, my dearest friend, I love you so.
But know I hold you dear to my heart.
My friend, my dearest friend, I love you so.

Hmmmm..well, I wrote this about someone in particular. But I think it can 
be true of all my friends. I just want to thank you all who were there 
for me when I was going through a really rough time in my life. This will 
have to do for now until I can give you all hugs in person. Thanks for not 
giving up on me when I had given up on myself. *GREAT BIG TEXAS SIZED HUGS 
TO YOU ALL*  
                               Love always,
                                            ME

This is a poem that I put on another board butI shortened it....:)
Tell me what ya think

Maliach and BlacStar

Maliach her royal beauty fair,
Secrets to share with the right one,
Sought by many,
Loved eternally by one,
He is great in strenght,
Pure in heart,
Captured hearts long long forgotten,
She is his; He is hers,
The ageless time is theirs to master,
He loves her as deep as the tides run,
She loves him with all the power within her,
BlacStar is his name.....
It is branded on Maliach's heart 
And there it shall ever be....


Mali

okay hopefully this next one makes more sense than tha last one....

Listening to beating lives
Contradicted by the air
Not wanting to conform
Ever morphing, always, constant screaming
    Seperated by a corpse
    And yet ever close
    Writing and racking as we pretend
    Not to notice one another
Enough of the loudness
The black noise, the white silence
Without much substance
Although it is laden with pressure
'til it implode
    Partitioned off from one's existence
    By a wall of inexpierence
    Without a safetynet to cathc me when
    I fall
More players appear to clutter the
Cramped stage
That is too much, a need to escape
Consumes me, I want to leave

And follow that elusive one.

it's my soul your talking to, so shut up and have a seat
it's misty out, and I have a small story
take advantage of the opportunity
and so, this it
a Sunday night drive turns into a 
search for your own existence
looking in the mirror, and whistling a small tune
a smile for the world, and a weeping memory
black, so blase, so by yourself
maybe you don't exist, but your blood runs hot
you think your dead, and it began a few moments
ago
lets talk, dad, help me out...tell me
but, no, it's to hurtful, that night
so long ago
a facade of ignorance, a coat of lies
the blu moon rises and you watch through teary eyes
ago
and so I tell you maybe one love began for spite
I loved her soul, and she loved mine, and we cried until
she died...and then I went home to my father, at night
true, I could lie, but then I wouldn't exist anymore
strumming mu guitar, on an old mattress, stained
song bout love, about peace and then he comes in
ago
behind the microphone, I cry, tears of blood...of my selfishness
cheering, only a moment...wide eyed beautiful girls
I could take any, at any time
at night on my bed, a hot body next to mine
to fill my aching soul, and then the rage begins...
not any more...I won't take it
I can't...take it...
bloodreddarkgloomynight
on the streets, hunting a bitch in heat
and I scream bloody murder, laugh, take a swig
I few moments in time, maybe I'll die
I hope so

                                            7/28/94

Sometimes I wish guys would see me
As more than "just a friend"
To quote a friend,
"I'm missing something in my life .... stability"
So many days, when I'm "one of the guys", I would rather much be "one of 
the girls"  (if there is such a thing)
I can't help it if I make friends with guys easier than with girls
(It's just the way I am)
I'm not leggy, blonde, or thin
I'm a little overweight, have brown curly hair, and am slightly leggy
And i don't think that it can be changed that easily
I like to have friends that are guys, but there are so many days when
I wish I was more than friends
(okay, I might sound a little desperate, but I'm really not)
I guess I'm scared I will wind up being single the rest of my life.
It isn't something I will look forward to if it happens.


Sorry folks, it's just the way I felt, and still feel a little bit. Maybe 
I'm just a bit down, i don't know

well, i guess it's a "numb" numb...i dunno, i can't explain it...i guess 
it could be good, if you're in that kind of mood...quite frankly, i LOVE 
dark poetry...and believe it or not, dark poetry is sometimes quite 
representative of love poetry....let's take for  example, Robert 
Smith...now he writes extremely dark poetry...and so much of it is truly 
love poetry...i can't use any literary figures as examples, because i'm 
not really hip on them...just Shakespeare, pretty much...so i have to 
stick to contemporaries that i am familiar with...some might disagree w/me 
that Robert Smith is a singer and not a poet, but i'll have you know that 
since he writes most of his own lyrics, he is considered a poet to me...

the point i'm trying to make here, batt, is that if you are good at dark 
poetry, stick w/it!  i prefer to write dark poetry if and when i actually 
do write, and it usually comes at a time when i'm feeling that 
numbness...so to me i guess it's a good kind of numb...

just my fraction of a nickel's worth....<-----(who got us all started on 
this anyhow???? heheheh)

dickson,  to me,  was one of the ones who got me started on writing down
the shit i think up...that and a poem called "Richard Corey" (which I'll 
post tomorrow after I find it...it's the first one that ever inspired 
me...)
    go ahead and call smith a poet...never got into his music much  (sorry 
all cure fans!)  but i've always liked his lyrics...to me they do more 
outside of the songs...also a jim morrison fan and thought anything pink 
floyd did before the wall should have been enshrined...literary...guess i 
can't think of too many either...most of the real good dark poems i've 
read are simply occasional works by love/cheerful/happy-smiley poets...

Here's a poem a wrote about an old ex-girlfriend who I still haven't 
gotten over...

Dinosaur
=------=
 
Ya, that's right.
Ms. Goody 2 Shoes,
walkin' down the block with your
high-top sneakers,
flannel shirt,
feeling like a top o'
the world grunge baby.
You were such an innocent
child you hear your Aunt Polly say
but then one day
you met me
I stayed clean
You were still so innocent 
but something happened
at your public sports event
and our relationship would
never be the
same.
No jell-o puddin' pops for
me sweety, I'm headin' for
the straight road for
union with 
Brahman.
But one week later,
annoyance set in
and you never talk
never look straight in
my eyes
My life is now over
or has it just begun
with a lead compound

anyways...this is the poem that i believe finally inspired me to
write myself...i had long before tried,  and written parodies and
imitations,  but this is the one that finally got the muse yanking
on my nerves...
 
     Richard Cory
 
Whenever Richard Cory went downtown,
  We people on the pavement looked at him:
He was a gentleman from sole to crown,
  Clean-favored,  and imperially slim.
 
And he was always quietly arrayed,
  And he was always human when he talked;
But still he fluttered pulses when he said,
  "Good morning,"  and he glittered when he walked.
 
And he was rich - yes,  richer than a king-
  And admirably schooled in every grace:
In fine,  we thought that he was everything
  To make us wish that we were in his place.
 
So on we worked,  and waited for the light,
  And went without the meat,  and cursed the bread;
And Richard Cory,  one calm summer night,
  Went home and put a bullet through his head.
 
 
     Edwin Arlington Robinson  (1869 - 1935)

I did try to give that "image." She broke up with me, and I'm not over it
still. I thought SHE was going to be the one, if you know what I mean.
She didn't even tell me that she wanted to break up, someone else did.

Another poem, inspired by a tremendous crush on someone.

"love spirals downward"
 
i was amazed
the nylon had a satin resilliance
as it clung to her breast
her facial expressions 
were almost feline in nature
the scent of patchouli
reinforced her femininity
the black velvet
was perfectly clinging to her spine
her kindness
far surpassed her beauty
as great as it was
when she smiled
i felt the sun
when she smiled
she laid mansuetude upon me
she molded my emotions unknowingly
like a sculptor with clay
she made a pleat in my heart
and her eyes
like two deep brown moons
set a knowing gaze upon me
and thus i became cislunar
when we were together
we sipped kummel from nautili
and together we laid
as the thunder rolled

I know what it is like to fid out from someone else that your significant 
other wants to break things off...my advice: if she was willing to throw 
away your heart, then be glad the she isn't "the one"....you need to be 
able to trust the person who is going to be your mate for the rest of your 
life...*ahem*

hey *hugs*
when someone breaks up with you, it hurts ... i think everyone has been 
through that
it hurts worse when you fin out from someone other than your significant 
other ...it makes you feel like there is something so worng with the 
relationship that the person cant tell you to your face (then again, they 
might be a coward or something lik etha to not be strong enough to tell 
oops
like that to not be strong enough to tell you to your face) .....
my ex didnt do it in person, he did over the computer links .. which hurt 
worse than if it was a letter or a phone call or even in person
but, as they say, time heals all (or most) wounds.... just give it a bit 
of time (in my case a year) and things ewill more or less be better

This is a poem I wrote a few years ago...I am cleaning my room getting 
ready to leave for college and I came across this in one of the boxes in 
my closet (where things have been known to disappear forever, never to be 
heard from again hehehe) and so I'd like to share it with ya'll.



Spinning in circles around the corners of my mind
See the sky, as silent as time
Running from everything I can vaguely call mine

The stars drip with my blood
The mmon is dark red
See my hands, as black as mud
Solace found in the living dead

All around me the air speaks
Of long forgotten pain that lives endlessly
Can we find forgiveness in the patterns of the stars
Or does the road wind about senselessly

The path is jagged like shards of broken glass
The broken glass that lines my heart
Maybe if I drown inside the sea of love
Some shred of truth will to me impart

Some strange wisdom that can glue together
All that has once again fallen apart

Mouths lined with red have again come for me
These bloody things, they are so hungry
They will devour all that is good in me
Smiling serenely as they eat away what you can't see

Tell me why when I scream
The earth seems to laugh at me
When I cry
They always torment me







I found this written on an index card...go figure....hehehehe

Enjoi,

Dee

but the coldness of knowing that you're gone

Mother

You were there when I took my first step,
You were there when I lost my first tooth,
You held me when I fell and skinned my knee,
Yo held me as I cried for a lost friend,
Mother, I just wnated you to know how I feel about you,
You are my best friend,
I want you to know tht I love you,
But you need to let me go--
To find my own way.
I will always need you--
So dont despair ,
Mother dear, I will always be here.
And I will always be you little girl,
However I nned to be a big girl now....
So be there for me my friend.
I love you and that will never change--
Let me go for now,
But not forgotten....

All I want is just one glance

~/poetry/love/frustration/damntorment
Damn this torment,
I felt so close to your touch.
But now I see you fade away,
and my wounded heart
takes another lash from love's rejection.
Who brings forth my pain,
and gnashes my dreams away?
Who gives me the illusion of love,
and then quickly runs away?
My effort is useless,
I've reached for a heart which
repels me away again.
I beg for your kiss,
but I'm only left to mourn.
Why did you touch my heart,
but then shatter it repeatedly?
I have been thrown again to
my bleeding knees,
but my begging justifies nothing.
My heart cries now,
with my eyes that have seen your beauty,
I know not my error,
For how can my love for you be wrong...

well here's the next one....

Now, as I wait
I find myself still thiking
About past evenings
In that dark, cloudy
room with all of its
ash and noise.
    Left with my shattered
    countenence and heart
    in my hands
I'm not prepared 
To try to put it 
Back together
As I clutch it to my breast
And push hard against 
My chest hoping to
force it back into the void
the black hole which
will never forget you
left bruised and happy
at once alone
afeared that i might
not love again

this is a little deal I have basically finished, but wouldn't mind some 
help



In the way

In the way of my path, you are, better move
or I'll have to kill you...what? you wish to talk? about what? my 
demise...
of course I do.It's still as clear as the day
and I was walking along a running stream, she wanted to touch my hand
but I drew back, and her skin brushed mine, a pitiful
reminder of what we once had, we will never again have
and she started to cry I asked her why
and she told me (the always
response) if I didn't know, she wouldn't tell me
I laughed in her face...to much soap opera's for you, love
she spit in my face
get the hell out of here, I hate you
my misery...
more? you better remember this...
her golden hair, her brown eyes..a poets dream come true
all I remember now is the scorn in her face, the tears in my heart
and her laughter ringing loud and clear, my misery
I couldn't stand to see her picture...ripped it up, and again
her friends sneer at my back, the lonely road
once had, now lost
forget her I told myself and
plunged into my studies and grew as black as the darkness in the 
bottom of a well
demons imagined...I would weep for hours, long as our walks
midnight phone calls, sleepy friends
what life?
and so one day I took out my shotgun
put the barrel in my mouth and pulled the trigger
cold, hard metal
of course, it was empty, and I couldn't stop my 
my misery
a shower a month, maybe, no friends, no loved ones
and screamed and raged at the moon
but then I realized that there was another girl in my life
as soon as I saw her, I forgot my poets dream
and I came to realize, there was no such thing as love
you laugh of course, but I know the truth

Cool...liked the images that poem evoked....

Ok, you wanted some feedback, here is my 2% of two cents worth....

You might wanna take a look at the form of the poem.

Ex:

"...and her skin
brushed
mine; a pitiful reminder
of what we once had
[of what] we will
never
have again and she started
to cry..."

Just a suggestion....makes for choppy reading but it also makes certain 
words or phrases stand out..

All in all a wonderful poem and I, for one, am glad tha you posted it.

Take care,

*hugs*

The temptation rips across my eye
Heironymnous and I walk alone in the pink painted wall of my room
So hard to remember the yellowing things I should say
Dissasociated
Crystal bridges wording the brittleing between
I wonder why
I wanted to see her again
Eviscerate the green-yellow M&M wording
"We'll always be special"
"I don't love you that way"
Don't love me any way than that way:
It was the only way I wanted

Walk away
Obsessing over men mounted in faithful greenblue fish steeds
Is that Mary on that stag?
What did you want me to see, Bosch?
What am I supposed to be?

That's my surreal poem...I try not to write like that too much.

Come brother, the circle of life demands this change.
Your childhood has passed and nature is calling you home.
Your tribe has long hours upon this world of ours.
My clan has just begun; nothing lasts forever.

The blood boiling in your veins cannot match the curiosity of my kind.
This blissful era of yours must pass as like those before you.
I cannot deny you the struggle to continue though I am your end.
You are a predator.  You understand the way.

Do you mourn for the rabbit?  The squirrel or stag?
You and I are alike in many ways.  Instinct to curiosity.
Do your yellow eyes show hate towards me?
Do your teeth yearn for my throat?

This is the Way.  You are expected to fight.
You are expected to fail.
I love you friend, but this matters not.  There is only the Way.
Die well brother.

I don't know what it is, but it looks as if it's consumed you.

How many of your friends have you outlived?
Some would call that a curse.
How many loves have you had?
How many lost?

You judge a tree by its rings and the earth by its layers.
How do you judge man?
I'm waiting old man.
Tell me your secret before your gone.

As I look out over the mountains
The sun burns brilliantly on the horizon.
I wonder will there be a tomorrow?

The sun is gone now,
But the sky is still shimmering red.
I wonder could this mean something?

Old maids say it will be nice tomorrow.
They say that's why it's red.
I wonder if they can be trusted?

One thing is for sure.
I'll go to bed tonight and dream, but,
I wonder will I wake up to anything?

The sky is almost dark now.
The deep red vanishing behind darkness.
I wonder will it ever return?

The city lights are starting to shine
Through the unforgiving darkness.
I wonder do they know what lies ahead?

The air is so cold.
Almost as if it were ice.
I wonder will it ever be as it was?

PRESENTS they've given you 
Wrapped in the finest shiny silver paper
Watch the edges shred the light
Pity smask is a horrible twisted slackjawed leering face
Grey around the edges 
How dare they show it to me?

Watching
them 
Gather
Like the black of the flies swarming around things left to die
They know just where to bite
Swelling the red of what they leave behind
The sky is white
How dare I keep what they leave behind?

Void me
Chew up what the pulse sweeps azure in my head
Impact the burst so green the falling of time
Green the birth of my nioght
and if I let it burn long enough
The fire will kill me inside

I never learned to hide

    darkness
    ~~~~~~~~        for Judie
the night embraces me
another drifting shadow
at home in the darkness
silence to think in
wish she was with me
sweet pain of longing
wander the streets
her face in my mind
tears in my eyes
don't let them fall
wish you were with me
can't stand the longing
waiting seems endless
somehow I endure
my heart is set free
together at last
forever stay with me
no more of this longing

As the teardrops from heaven fell,
The teardrops fell down her face,
They were going to be together,
Every doubt and question had been answered,
All the man-made dragons had fleed into thin air.
All was perfect or so it seemed...
As the years progressed,
Tempers flared and burined,
The rage of one hurt the other,
Protecting the young was the quest.
One finally got out and never looked back!

---


Feelings growing stronger day in and day out
Isn't that what love is all about?
So many thoughts going round and round
My love grows with every minute sound
Of your soft, loving voice.

One thing I'm sure is that our love will fly
To the highest clouds in the bluest sky.
I wonder, could you be the one of my dreams?
The answer comes stronger than the question it seem.
Yes!

Soon I will see you for my first glance.
then I will ask, "May I have this dance?"
Of love and life to cherish and hold
For each day as we relentlessly grow old
Together.

Feelings of the heart can only be true
My heart pounds in my ear, I love you.
The mind can play tricks with many different scenes,
But my mind knows how much your love means 
To me.




Love,
Nathan

On A Sea Shore


Walking through moonlight
Staring at stars I swear weren't there before
Sweating through hindsight
Staring at moons half-asleep on the shore

It's only a mile to where you are going
It's only a mile from everywhere

Dancing on a sea shore
Watching candles burning in the sand
Burning all across the land
Jumping shadows, hand in hand

Dancing on a sea shore
Watching the moon meet the sea
Watching her watch over me
Hiding behind her majesty
On a sea shore

Feel the southwind
Picking me up above the troubles I know
Seeing the sun grin
Evil faces all around the globe

It's only a year from planet earth
It's only a year from everywhere

Dancing on a sea shore
Watching candles burning in the sand
Burning all across the land
Jumping shadows, hand in hand
On a sea shore

Here is another poem I wrote several years ago, but I think it can fit 
right here, right now. 


"For You"

I watch you running from pain you cannot face
I watch you falling, unable to run the race
I watch you put yourself ahead of everyone else
Always giving it all
Are they there to catch you when you fall?

I watch you ignoring the pain in your heart
I watch you counting, but you don't know when to start
I watch you wiping the tears from your cheek
They say they are the strong and you are the meek

What I have walked, I've walked for you
What I have suffered, I've suffered for you
What I have done, I've done for you
I love you

I watch you praying with a heart that cannot feel
Iw atch you denying what inside you know is real
I watch you taking the blame again and again
Don't you see I'm here to make that all end?

What I have walked, I've walked for you
What I have suffered, I've suffered for you
What I have done, I've done for you.
I love you

this is another poem/lyrics I wrote for my band:


"Love Will Wait For You"

I know that the pain inside you is for real
I know that you've built a wall so you wouldn't have to feel
I know it's hard to trust when you have been let down
I know that the wall seems high from there on the ground

You think I am going to leave you, too
It's in your eyes
You think that everything has just been more lies
When will you understand that my love knows no end?
When will you let your guard down and let me in?

Love will wait for you till the end of time
Love will protect you, love is kind
Love will hold you, and love will avail
Love will protect you, love will never fail
Love will wait for you

There is so much bitterness inside of you
You're at a crossroads now, only you can choose
You have to let go in order to stay
And inside find the courage to stand strong and not sway





Hmmmmm.....heavily influenced by I Corinthians 13, wouldn't you say?

See what too much to drink will do to a respectable warm fuzzie? It makes 
her turn into Rambler....

Here is a poem I wrote on May 11, 1991. I wrote this for my best friend 
Danny, who gets on here as zweifel sometimes. We had not talked for a 
year, and had become friends again about a year before this poem was 
written. It took a long time for us to trust one another again, and this 
poem marks the beginning stages of winning that truat back.


"Take My Heart"

Long ago, in what seems like another world,
There was me, and there was you.
We were young, we thought we knew it all,
There wasn't anything we couldn't do.
Yet time was against us...
We couldn't see what laid ahead of us.

There were many paths we could have travelled down,
Did we choose the wrong ones?
looking back at all the pain we caused,
Does that make us the strong ones?
tell me, how do we bridge the distance?
Bring back the art of sincere repentance?

take my heart
I want to say I love you
Take my heart
And give me the courage to
Please take my heart
And guide us through
Take my heart
This heart loves you.

We've weathered many chnages together
Somehow we always end up back here.
We know each other better than ourselves,
We've seen the laughter, and tasted the tears.
Someday we will finally understand,
Come to me, I'm holding out my hand.






You guessed it, this was a song too! Hehehehe!

this is another poem I wrote for Danny (aka zweifel). I wrote it in 1991 
when he went off to college.


"Say Goodbye"

Today may be the last time I'll see you for awhile
You're moving on in your life to chase all your dreams
I remember all of our years together and I have to smile
Funny how things never are what we think it seems

Many times the road's unsure
Sometimes the way can make us cry
And so I

Say goodbye,
With all the love in my heart
Cry the tears,
For the time we'll be apart
I say goodbye,
And pray it won't be long
Till we meet again,
Our love still as strong...
Goodbye.

Seems like once again I've got to learn to let you go
Funny how we're always chasing the shadows away
You'll still be right here beside me and although
the miles are long, inside my heart you will stay.

Many times the road's unsure
Sometimes the way can make us cry
And so I

<chorus>

I know you say nothing can shake us
But now I see we're hanging on
United together, nothing can break us
Somehow we'll keep moving on
And so I

<chorus>

You can't see the tears
They are rolling down my heart
                where you can't be
I wake up every morning
Find a mask to wear
So I go on pretending
                that I don't care

I shield my heart from seeing you
                I know you're there but pretend I don't
I shield my heart from loving you
                I left it open once for you
But I shield my heart from hearing you
                I shield my heart

There's only so many
Walks we can take in the rain
                Thunderheads roll in the distance
I wake every morning
Trying to face another day
So I go on pretending
                I don't care anyway

I shield my heart from wanting you
                I know it's there but pretend it's not
I shield my heart from trusting you
                I left it open once for you
I shield my heart from hating you
                Deep down inside I know I could never hate you.



Hmmm...this one is rather dark and sombre. Well, I can't remember when I 
wrote it. See what happens when I clean my room? All you poor unsuspecting 
souls get subjected to my poems. *sigh*

Well, I shall end this rampage of poetry (can these pathetic ramblings 
even be labled as poetry?) for now....

I hope it was entertaining!

Ending

You have failed, there is no point any more.
All inside is cold and you see the end in near.
You tried to make her happy, but se left you all the same
Maybe the dark void of death, will take away the pain
You take the blade and plunge it to your chest...
And embrace the welcome release darkness brings.

I have felt that way before...sometimes the relationship just wasn't meant 
to be, regardless of all good intentions. I wouldn't call it "failing" 
though.....I was always taught that the only things you regret in life are 
the risks you don't take...sometimes we need to learn the hard way.

Nice poem, though....very moving.

This song was on the tape that you made for me....and I thought it to be

"Trust" by the Cure


There is no one left in the world
That i can hold onto
There is really no one left at all
There is only you
And if you leave me now
You leave all that we were undone
There is really no one left
You are the only one

And still the hardest part for you
To put your trust in me
i love you more than i can say
Why won't you just believe?




I adore you, Deana Callahan!

Love,

He remembers the time when he was young
So agile and strong, once so full of life
He looks at his now withered and twisted hands
And curses his long, bitter life
Now his mind wastes as fast as his body
He looses memories every day, friends departed
Why has he been imprisoned for so long
When all his friends are released from their torment
He forgets their names, but holds onto the faces

As the darkness descends, he sees life`s cruel joke
And he laughs out loud for the last time

Then all is black...

They ask, `Why do the good die so young?`
Maybe it is their reward?

work better' board...do you know what i mean?  this is a feel good kind of 
place, not somewhere you go to get suggestions for improvement (i guess 
that's what my writing classes are for, eh?).  i dunno...i don't like

It's probably because no one wants to hurt anyone's feelings!  We get our 
work ripped apart enough in our classes! If ppl ripped our work that we 
do for pleasure apart, then we might wanna quit writing, ya know?  So if 
you want your work critiqued w/more *uumph* than w/less smileys, let us

Actually, I think we refrain from constructively criticising posts out of
shear laziness. I've tried to constructively criticize, but that means
actually READING and UNDERSTANDING each other's poetry, instead of
skimming over it as usual.

echoing your voicejust like the riging in my ears
my favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
scraping through my head `til i don't want to sleep any more
come on tell me
make this all go away
you make this all go away
i'm down to just one thing 
and i'm starting to scare myself
make this all go away
you make this all go away
i just want something
i just want something i can never have
you always were the one to show me how
back then i couldn't do all the things i can do now
this thing is slowly taking me apart
grey would be the color if i had a heart

i just want something i can never have
in this place it seems like such a shame
though it all looks different now
i know it's all still the same
everywhere i look you're all i see
just a fading reminder of who i used to be
come on tell me
make this all go away
you make it all go away
i'm down to just one thing
and i'm starting to scare myself
make this all go away
i just want something i can never have
i just want something i can never have

that's what i have you to thank for
blood drips down my 
wrist and leaves
a shadow of your 
face in the crimson
lines.

burgendy life
reflects that facade
down my elbow
dripping to a puddle 
on the floor

flowing int oa river
of sorrow
and ocean of hurt
that's all you left behind

The Dreamer, filled us full of hope
Hope for a better life
He told us to take his wares, never mind the cost
We were so happy, disregarded reality
Until we found the dreamer was a deceiver
And our lives came to and end
Our endless weeks of euphoria, had crushed our soul
We now like empty shells, obey the deceiver
Only to get our next fix....

Happiness is for fools, and can never last
Sadness is reality, and will be with us always

Im bled dry of all ambition
all religion is superstition
Im on a mission

prospects dim and dusty lives
all these things give me hives
Id rather play with knives

grinning lawyers cant catch me
I am right here, all you see

is mission a fable? life a big joke?
is life a joint from which I smoke?
Id rather soak

oh well, at least Im trying
Im not at all afraid of dying
monotonous sighing


so what do you think? needs work, I know

Subject: The spirit who denies 
Date: Wed Aug 17 19:26:59 1994

Warning...I was reading Faust, helping a friend get her own apartment, and 
drinking heavily while I wrote the following semi-poem...Take it for what 
ever you want.

SLAM, SLAM DOWN, RESPOND IN KIND
MALCONTENT, DON'T GO AWAY
BURN, BURN DOWN, TEMPLE OF THE CONSCIENCE
DON'T GO AWAY---Overkill, Gasoline Dreams

What do I feel? Can I feel?
I don't pretend to know. She thinks she feels joy. I think she's deluded. 
I don't believe it exists. And I will never believe it. Joy to me is an 
insanity born of lack of comprehension of actuality and circuimastances as 
they are. Of actual occurances.
I read somewhere that humans are cursed by their intellect...I am pleased, 
theretofore, to report that the curse has been avoided by the vast 
majority of humanity quite spectacularly. Males and females are both 
bigoted and hateful, and no race is innocent of blame. They always look 
for someone to blame. They should be blaming their own lack, their evil 
minds, their compulsions to cruelty and wanton violence and sheer 
stupidity.
They've killed so much of the feeling in me. I hang here like a withered 
limb shot full of shrapnel, scarred but able to function, but incapable of 
the extrees of sensation any longer...deadened, greying, dying by degrees.
They've ripped out so much of what I could have been. What I wanted to be. 
I was capable of so much emotion when I was younger...but now a bitterness 
clouds over my mind and a wry, dry and dark chuckle wheezes out of the 
sepulchre of my soul, and I don't know if I'm alive anymore.
Before the campaign of terror (And never be fooled: Human Children are 
evil, cruel, crazed with bloodlust and hostile to ANYTHING that is 
different or weak, adept at sniffing it out no matter where you try and 
bury it.  There parent's must make them so, right? They can't be this vile 
inherently. But maybe they are?) I was a little boy, four years old, tiny 
eyes already straining from trying and successfully forcing them to take i 
the words I'd discovered lying in wait for me inside the only friends I 
had, skin worm-white from huddling away from the harsh yellow of the suna 
nd the squirming, angry, shouting mass of hate that surged all around me.
They beat me physically until I learned not to quiver, or mona, or cry, 
and they savaged me mentally until I learned to shut myself down. I 
waited, and waited, and eventually when I was able I stopped the physical, 
but the mental is unceasing, I can taste it with every hoarse and strident 
whisper, meant for me to hear.
That's why I'm a cripple, tottering on healthy legs, unable to care about 
anything anymore, unable to tell anyopne how I feel, deep in my icebound 
heart I'm afraid to melt away the glaciers because what if they are all I 
am, all I have, All I'll ever be? What if all I am is that dusty wry 
chuckle, the offhand hate, the disgust at what they tried to do to me? 
What am I? WHAT THE FUCK AM I?

I don't know.

I AM THE SPIRIT THAT DENIES FOREVER!
AND RIGHTLY SO! FOR WHAT HAS ARISEN FROM THE VOID
DESERVES TO BE ANNIHILATED.
IT WOULD BE BEST IF NOTHING WOULD EVER ARISE.--Mephistopheles to Faust, 
FAUST

I feel so little now, I know it's burning under the sheets of bleu pinning 
my brain, but I can't let it out. I can't let myself feel, I'm afraid that 
I'm dead or dying inside, and that one day I'll just stop...I'll have 
accumulated too much damage and I just WON'T anymore. I am not a 
nihilist...I am Nihilism. I am the void, anti-life, the Shiva of my own 
soul, the end of existing. I'm too arrogant to let myself off the hook, 
too alienated to stop the lemming urge...I know how little I am,
how small and petty all things are.

This is just another late night's creative spurt.  Hope you like it!

Could It Be?
------------

Sometimes the Man upstairs works in mysterious ways
While he's controlling thenights, manipulating the days.
He's thrown two people together, you and I,
With a love and feelings that will never die.
Mere miles not stopping our two hearts
From being in this great play, acting their parts.
Could it be, we were meant to be?

The answer to this and many other
Questions is left to our loving Mother.
She will decide whether it is in our fate
To be together.  All we must do is wait.
She may be subtle when she lets us know.
All we can do is let ourselves grow
Together until we see, if we were meant to be.

I know how I feel about you, and you about me.
Maybe soon she will let us see,
If we were meant to be.


I adore you!

Love,
Nathan

Slice across the azure as I fall
Belly-wounded sky my wings dragdredge the vault
Seared yellow white pinions glow
Outcasts' fire punish blazing
Plummet I glow with God's grace
The ground runs from me when I get to it
Towercloud of windgrit and pulseplumes of Verdant Fire
Skin bubbling peeling away from Charcoaling bone yellowblack
LIghtbringer
I was Lightbringer
Treader in the dust now
Lord of Worms
I fell failures fall
Slickrope guts spill from my heatwithered abdomen
Emeralds for eyes See my trail
Hanging sloweaved bluesilk vault of sky
Hides them from us
From you
From me
First among them first creation of the one who is love
In the icy towers second only to one
Now I turn my firekissed neck skywards at his creation
Dirtmound holding me up so I can see
I laugh with the joy of it
Wings crushed gelatinbone beneath my spasmback
Laughing with black blood on my lips

Just a poem about love.

Arms clasped around me.
Crushing me.
Holding on for dear life.
Hoping that I never leave.

Isolating myself by choice.
 Not for self-pity or attention.
Just privacy.  My privacy.
Friends know I'll not discuss my deepest feelings.

Yet a blue moon comes along every so often.
A craving to be needed.
To be touched.
To be a provider.

Counting the times on one hand.
Watching friends and their children.
The awe in a childs eyes.
The worship and dependency.

Wanting to share a secret.
Arms clasped arounds me and no one else.
Drawing strength from me.
Hoping that I never leave.

Every so often.
Wanting to be one-on-one.
Wanting to be special.
Arms clasped around me.

Give me a hug and tell me you need me.

I am in a creative mood.....but I had to post this song from Andrew Loydd 
Weber's "Cats"

MEMORY
------

Midnight,
Not a sound from the pavement;
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone.

In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet;
And the wind begins to moan.

Memory,
All alone in the moonlight;
I can smile at the old days,
I was beautiful then.

I remember the time I knew what happiness was;
Let the memory live again.

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning;
Someone mutters
And the street lamp gutters;
And soon it will be morning.

Daylight,
I must wait for the sunrise;
I must think of a new light,
And I mustn't give in.

When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory, too;
And the new day will begin.

Burned out ends of smoky days -
The stale cold smell of haunting;
A street lamp dies, another night is over -
Another day is dawning.

Touch me,
It's so easy to leave me;
All alone with my memory
Of my days in the sun.

If you touch me you'll understand what happiness is;
Look, a new day has begun.




Enjoi,
Dee

Ok....here is a poem/song that I wrote about two and a half years 
ago...but sometimes I am amazed at how apropos some of these old 
lyrics/poems are in the scheme of things today...



WHERE ARE YOU NOW?
------------------

I knew someday the choices I've made would catch up to me.
And as I watch you walk on by, I realize it's come to be.
If only I could show you how much I really cared;
If only you'd understand that I've been running scared.

You see, I've grown up looking through a glass wall;
Everytime I tried to break through, I only seemed to fall.
My hands are beating against the glass like the rain;
If I hold my heart tightly, I won't feel the pain.

And I'm walking alone,
Where are you now?
All the empty words were the shadow of a promise somehow.
And I'm walking alone,
Where are you now?

I believed you when you promised that your love would never end.
You said we're less than lovers, a little more than friends.
I never meant to cause you any sorrow or any pain;
But the way you showed your love was slowly driving me insane.

I know I promised never to tell a living soul,
But I held it in too long, I had to let it go.
You never really cared, and it took so much from me;
To keep pretending an living a lie that could never set me free.

And I'm walking alone,
Where are you now?
All the empty words were the shadow of a promise somehow.
And I'm walking alone,
Where are you now?

Here is another one I wrote a while ago (I really should try to write some 
new poetry, since I have so much emotion from which to draw my creative 
inspirations!)


LOVE WILL FIND YOU
------------------

Does it feel just like the little child you used to be
Is still awaiting someone's warm embrace?
Alone with people all around, who look but never see
Can anyone find you in this place?
When you're alone in the dark with a broken heart
And you're lonely
Love will find you
When you hurt inside and you want to hide
You can try, but love will find you
Love will find you
When you're covered by a cloak of sorrow in the night
And all your hope gets lost without a trace
Even in the darkness there is still a shining light
You will see it, look into my face
There's no wall too high
That I can't break it down
There's no hole too deep
Chains to strong, heart too dead
That I can't get to you
Oh, I can get to you.
Love will find you




Dedicated lovingly to Zippo


Love,
Dee

Black clouds obscure a blue sky
Up high the sun is hiding
Keeping its happy rays from me

In my mind I run the distance
Escaping the soul-eating resistance
Binded by chains you swore would set me free

But why should I cry?
It's only my heart that's broken
Scarred by words left unspoken
Hanging in the air like a sigh

So why should I try?
It's only my heart that's broken
It's become your precious token
You never really cared
So why should I?





Once again, apropos!

What is life but a drop of water in an ocean too vast for us to even begin 
to comprehend? i sit inside of a sheltered philosophy that shadows truths 
with comforting words and oblique images to soothe our troubled minds.

What is a song but our hearts poured out onto a page? What is the written 
word but an idea expressed with curves and symbols?

Is there any purpose at all to our existence here on this poisoned earth? 
The human eye is so scaled that it cannot see beyond the coverings of our 
souls that all too soon die anyway!

To and Fro
----------

To and fro,
To and fro,
Where she stops
nobody knows -
With the spin of the head
and a countdown is said
Who will she be this time?

To and fro,
To and fro,
Where she stops
I'd like to know
The feelings change
At the drop of a hat
One monet I feel this
The next I feel that.
How do I pin down
The feelings inside
And bring them togetger
So they no longer hide?

When one sees the other.
They'll start to fight;
The ones that are mean
Fight with all their might.
But the ones that are scared
Will run and hide out of sight.

Confusion, confusion,
Is all that I hear,
Voice upon voice
Ringing in my ear.
I cover my ear but to no avail

To die, to die,
Is all I think of.
But would I go to hell
Or heaven above?

Would I do it?
Could I do it?
Should I do it?
Why?
To find peace and relief
In the sweet by-and-by?

Well, hon, I see you were feeling creative and rather bitter.  Just to let 
you know I don't think you should let go of life.  After all, I'm here 
now.  I would be rather upset, and I told you I'm not going to visit you 
for the first time in a casket.  Sorry.
All in all, I noticed a couple that seemed to be directed at someone, not 
to mention any names, but I'm glad they weren't toward me.
About Love Will Find You, I don't think you have to worry about me trying 
to hide from you.  I haven't yet, have I?  Plus, I think it's a little too 
late to hide anyway, Love has already found me.
I adore you!

Where are we all going to,
When will it all end?
This long, frozen night.
Living in darkness,
Many things are obscured.
Waiting for the morning
That shall never come.
At least in my lifetime.
Familiar things seem foreign.
Did I ever know them?
Thoughts spinning completely
Out of control into the depths
Of my mind.
It appears in a brilliant flash
And then is gone.
The answer to all my troubles
Has hidden itself again.
Not remembering what I saw
Makes me wonder
Will I ever see the light?

What is life, but to be with friends
And people you love?
If that is life, then am I dead?
If I am, then this must be Hell,
For Heaven is to be with friends 
And people you love?
But that sounds like life,
Or maybe life is Hell, 
And Heaven is death?
It's all so strange.
I suppose noone knows the truth.
Maybe I will find out
And let you all know,
But to do so 
Would I have to die?
Maybe I'll leave it
To some great scientist,
Who has nothing better to do
Than sit around
And ponder such questions.

Here is a song/poem that I heard several years ago and the Melody haunts 
me still.  It was originally sung by The Outlaws of Tampa FL.  Those of 
you who know me will see why I like it so much.

COLD HARBOR

Wasn't far from Richmond,
Second day of June.
The year was 1864,
The end was closing soon.
A long and bitter struggle,
For the boys in Blue and Gray, 
The battle of Cold Harbor,
Was only hours away.

I woke up long before the sun,
And through the morning sky,
Wondered as I lay there,
"Is this my time to die?"
Somewhere through the darkness,
The Union fires glowed.
A distant bugle's revellie,
Was playing soft and low.

Oh ! Cold Harbor !
The battle lines are drawn.
Through the heart of Dixie,
The thrill of war was gone.
Rebel flag was faded,
Waved it far too long.
Oh, Cold Harbor,
The last of the proud,
To carry on !

Morning shook like thunder,
As through the smoke they came.
Heavy guns and the musket fire,
Pouring down like rain.
Just one half an hour,
Ten thousand Federals died.
My blood ran cold to watch them fall,
I closed my eyes and fired.

Oh ! Cold Harbor !
The battle lines were drawn.
Through the heart of Dixie,
The thrill of war is gone.
rebel flag was faded,
Waved it far too long.
Oh, Cold Harbor.
The last of the proud,
To carry on !

I don't need to fall at your feet 
Just cause you cut me to the bone
And I wont miss the way that you kiss me 
We were never carved in stone
If I don't listen to the talk on the town
Then well maybe I can fool myself
    I'll get over you 
    I know I will
    I'll pretend my ships not sinking
    And I'll tell myself I'm over you
    Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
I refuse to give in to my blues 
That's not how it's gonna be
And I'll deny the tears in my eyes
I don't want to let you see
That you have made a hole in my heart
And now I've got to fool myself
    I'll get over you 
    I know I will 
    I'll pretend my ships not sinking
    And I'll tell myself 
    I'm over you

reminding me
of you


Those same sheets
the lone creak
of the bedsprings
as I turn
to see you
no longer there

Thanx for being so supportive.  This may be long so please bear with me.
Here goes:

The beam of light edged its way softly through the leaves above only to
rest on the soft fur-like body of the slow-moving creature that seemed to
bask in the beauty of the tree from which it was getting its daily nutritional
requirements.  The caterpillar was quite content as it swallowed the last
of its meal--a leaf from a tree several hundred times it's size.  He
looked down and up the tree.  He was so far up that he could not see the
bottom of the tree and so far from the top that the tree's apex seemed to
exist in another dimension only imagined in the mind of this lowly creature.


He smiled as he envisioned himself on top of the tree looking down on the
world below...beyond anything and everything.  He started his tread back
to his home where his brothers and sisters were waiting for him.  

He was always considered the dreamer of the family.  Always walking around
in a daze not knowing which way was which.  He was often laughed at by the
other insects that were living in the tree.  His only friend was an odd old
worm that lived just below the branch he was on.  The worm was quite wise
and lived to see both his parents, grand-parents and great-grandparents go
through the metamorphosis and eventually die.  He always had words of
encouragement to give to his little friend, the caterpillar.


The caterpillar decided to pay his friend a visit and headed down to his home.
The worm was comfortably eating away at the bark of the tree and barely
noticed his friend's arrival.  He looked up at his friend when he saw him
and smiled.

"Hello there little one," he smiled.  "How goes it today?  You seem to be
in the best of moods." With this he turned his attention back to the uneaten
bark.  The caterpillar was used to this and simply responded with a smile.

"I'm fine," he said.  "I just came to see how you were."

"I," came the muffled response of a worm with a mouth full of tree bark,
"am quite fine.  Are you readying yourself for the metamorphosis?"

The question seemed to take the young caterpillar by surprise and he did
not respond.  Instead, his face fell and his furry skin seemed to change to
a darker shade of green.

"What's wrong?" asked the worm.

"I didn't realize it would be so soon," he responded.

"You do not wish to be a butterfly?  They are quite beautiful and they can
fly as high as they want."

"I know.  It's just that....well....I want to be a worm, like you.  I want
to teach people like you teach me."  The worm smiled in recognition of the
compliment and the young one's addulation.

"I know how you feel," he replied.  "When I was your age, I wanted to be a
bird so that I could eat my friends who made me angry.   I later learned
that we often have to be what we don't want to be because that is the way
of things.  You have no choice.  You must undergo the metamorphosis
because that is your destiny."  The caterpillar frowned.

"But I don't want to be a butterfly," he whined.  "And if I choose not to
go through with the metamorphosis, I wont!"  He then took off as quickly
as he could running to another side of the tree where he ran into one of
his brothers.

"Hey silly," his brother screamed at him.  "Where do you think you're going?
Home is that way."  He laughed at his brother who seemed to have tears in his
eyes.

"I don't want to go through with it!" screamed the caterpillar.

"With what, dreamer?" his brother asked more out of jest than curiousity.

"The metamorphosis."  His brother fell back and gasped.  His furry green
coat turned a bright green as his face contorted into pure anger.

"Don't you dare say that again!"  Screamed the older caterpillar to his
brother.  "You will do as you are told and I will hear nothing of it!  You
are meant to be a butterfly and that is that!"  With that he grabbed his
little brother by the ear and took him home.  

At home, his other brothers and sisters argued with him all night
demanding that he do as he was told and be what he was supposed to be.  He
cried all night as they badgered him.  Finally he could take it no more.

"LEAVE ME ALONE!!!" he screamed.  With that he ran into his room and shut
the door.  But he could still hear them talking.  He wanted them to stop. 
He wanted to just be alone.  And without thinking, he began to spin a web
around his ears.  At first, it was enough, but he could still hear them a
little and he could still see their reflections outside and so he spun
another web around his eyes.  This, however was not enough because he
could still feel them and so he spun the web all around his body.  All
night he spun the web, carefully so that there would be no room for them
to get it and talk to him.

Finally he was alone.  He was tired and soon he was asleep.  Early the
next day he woke up and looked around his little cell.  He couldn't see
but something was strange.  He strained his eyes hard and looked down at
his body and let out a scream of terror.



Uh...sorry guys.  Running out of space.  Next post, I'll finish it.
Maybe later.  I have to go now.

Ok..here's the second part to the story.  I'm sure none of you were in any 
suspense  :)

As the caterpillar's eyes focused on his body, he found that he now had 
legs growing from his side.  He stared in astonished horror as he looked 
around his cocoon.  In his attmept to ruan away from being forced
into undergoing the metamorphosis he had driven himself to the one place 
that he could undergo it.  He was by himself, alone to look at himself.

He knew what was expected of him and he knew what he had to do.  This 
brought him great sadness and the tears rolled down his face as he began 
to spin another web.  All night he lay in the lonely room he had created 
changing as he was required to do.  Being something that he hated.  
Finally, he could stay awaked no longer and he fell asleep.

The sunlight had somehow managed to edge it's way through the dense 
foliage and into the caterpillar's home and through the thick webbing that 
he had created to rest softly on his wing.  He looked across in 
astonishment when he realized that in truth he had a wing.  In fact, he 
had two of them!  He also had six legs!  HE was what everyone wanted him 
to be. As quickly as he could, he tore away at his web, freeing himself 
from his silk cell.

Once open to the air he flew out of his cocoon.  All around him were the 
cocoons of his brothers and sisters who were still metamorphising.  He 
flew out of the home, almost excited by the beauty of the view he
was afforded by his flight.  He took off into the air, flying high and 
flying low.  He flew below and landed near a pool of water where he saw 
his reflection and marveled.  He was beautiful!  He flew off again to the 
top of the tree and looked down.  It was just as beautiful as he had 
imagined.  He smiled.

Suddenly, a wave of sadness hit him as he now realized that he would never 
be a worm and that he would always be something that others wanted him to 
be.  No matter how beutiful that was, it was not what he wanted.  He flew 
down and rested by the bark where he found the old worm resting after 
having eaten a full lunch.  The worm recognized him at once.

"Hello there," he smiled.  "I see you did it anyway."

"It was an accident," replied the caterpillar.  "This is not what I want.  
I want to be like youg!"  He started to sob.  Soon the tears
 were enormous.  HIs friend tried to console him.

"Sometimes, my friend," he said.  "We are not allowed to choose our own 
destiny."  Somehow, that only made him feel worse.  The caterpillar, now 
turned butterfly took off into the air, without saying goodbye.  He flew 
through the winds, blinded by his own tears. 

Mere moments after leaving the worm, he found himself caught in something. 
He looked around and noticed that he was caught in a spider's web.  He 
fought to free himself.  The more he struggled, the more he got entangled.
By the time the spider got there, he was already too exhasted to move.  
The spider didn't seem interested in eating the butterfly, though for he 
simply smiled and then walked over to him and started spinning a web.

After a while, the spider had engulfed the butterfly in a web cocoon of 
his own and hung the butterfly upside down from his strong webbing.  The 
butterfly felt lonely and depressed.  

But soon, a wonderful thing happend!  The butterfly, whose eyes were not 
covered by the webbing, looked down into a puddle of water that
had settled on the tree he was caught in.  And in the puddle, he could see 
his reflection.  He was now a long, grey/white worm!  He smiled as he 
realised that he was what he wanted to be.  

"I am a worm!"  He screamed.  "I am a worm!"  Soon he was laughing, and 
then he let out bombastical laughter that rang throughout the little 
forest

Only a little distance away, the worm swallowed a piece of bark and smiled 
in knowing satisfaction at the laughter he heard.  And he looked up at the 
trickle of light that had seeped through the leaves to land on a small 
caterpillar moving slowly down the bark to say hello to the wisest animal 
he knew.

Thank you very much for this little story has given me some hope that I

caterpillar and spin myself a cocoon to get away from all the things I

I liked the story, but i didn't care much for the ending.  This 
catepillar/butterfly still has a lot of unfinished business...unsolved 
problems...(not that the end of a story should bring completely solved 
problems or anything, but it's nice to have a bit of assurance).  The end 
of this story provides me w/no assurance whatsoever...maybe that's the 
way you intended it to be.  The rest of the story was 
thought-provoking...just didn't think the end was...

That was the point.  It's not supposed to be a story of assurance.  You

The Night has returned
It returns as it always does, tormentuous, angry
I fight, and the tempest grows
I retreat and it follows to end me.

The night has returned
The dark parent continues, spercilious, intolerant
I love her and she gives me gold
I ask for love and I become unworthy.

The night has returned.
It anticipates its arrival, joyous, in lethargy
I lose and it knows
I win and it mocks me

The night has returned.
The shaded green waits, capriciuos, vibrant
I need her, so I'm told
I ask to be needed and laughter follows me.

The night has returned
But so, will the day
I fight no more.  I will fly into the sun
And the night shall have its way.

I've been reluctant to post my poetry in the past because I wasn't sure

As the blue-green currents rushed ashore
Her beauty became well known
And as she retreated, more and more
Her splendor and love were shown.

As the sunlight danced on the liquid glass
Her snow-white smiled brightened
Ans as the moonlight danced on the peacful mass
Her smile, my heart lightened.

Her tempestuous ways, her peaceful nights
Her silent days, her violent fights
All compliment her mysterious realms
And taunts the explorer at the helm.

Only this lion-heated creature dares to enter her depths
And only this creature will konw utter joy, or suffering death

As a moth to a flame, the creature has no might
He must attmept the union betwee unlike and like, wrong and right.

Just as the thorn-bird dies singing it's only song
So does the creature for who he longs

I am the creature

The Black sits at the line
Mocking me
It knows

The black awaits the turning sphere
Stalking me
It grows
It grows

For an instant, Black and white
Join at the hip to create a vibrant cascade of beauty
But the Black continues with a ferocious might
Only mere fragments of white are scattered into the dark sea.

It cannot be escaped
It cannot be denied
It knows 
It knows

When the white returns, the black will fight
It must peresevere with all it's might
It grow
It grows

It must.

and only half of my weakness
lies in the placating sense of abandonment
I rely to display
upon my loved ones, a greeting, a calling
a disappointed and vanished arrangement
as the lion roars as I speak and
do look down upon myself in

haste, and then a quiet evening follows
may the dead tree live, and the ocean dry up
all the buckets of ink will not prevail
or in fact do anything
at all.as long as no thought exists in form
then back-lashed horrors roam

evening day blinded realness
blinking eyes desire one sight
and premature lust evacuates, partly



dylan....

this poem shows how I feel when I get angry and then regret the words I 
have spoken to my loved ones...the rest is up to you to figure out

Hey dylan I was just forced to read Philip Larkin....eeeeeeek I dont LIKE

that I had to write a term paper on for my final in my Contemprary Poetry 
Class depicting and detailing waht I thought the APPARANT meaning of it 
was....using VALID examples from the poem....*growl*

ANYWAY....

I alos love Sylvia Plath, Emily Dickenson, Edgar Allen Poe, William 
Shakespeare, Yeats (yes Nat I do like Billy), Anne Sexton, Elizabeth 
Bishop, John Berryman, and a whole host of others. I also love to read 
literature...right now I am reading the entire works of Shakespeare, the 
Works of Plato and Moby Dick (Yes all at the same time...I was also 
reading The Devil in Massachusettes: An Enquiry into the Salem Witch 
Trials as well as John Grisham's "The Chamber" but I have finished those 
two....)

Subject: On Her Wings
Date: Tue Aug 23 00:12:22 1994

The clouds fly by at an awesome rate
Teh pale blue sky seeks to hide my fate

There I lay, save and secure
On her wings, feeling her love so pure

But my wieght begins to tax her might
And she struggles hard to keep aflight

But as the journey grows stronger still
I fear that pain will bend her will

And finally after aeons of strife
after pains and sorrows throughout her life

She shakes me loose so she cool fly
And as I fall I fear I may die

But soon I see, as I descend
That it's not my life that I fear will end.

It's the comfort, the warmth, the security, the love
Of my wonderful lover, My awesome dove.

That she should leave me, my life would cease
Though my heart would beat it would have no peace

And so, I ascend not to burden her again
But to fly beside her until the end

For if she'll love me again, then she'll see
That I'd be happier that I could possibly be

And then one day, a child we'll bring
And together we'll carry him on our wings.




I wrote this for my girlfriend after she dumped me. I've learned to deal 
with the fact that we'll never get back together again but i thought it 
would be nice to share it with you all before yabbs closed down.

I love your poetry! I think its great. You're a realist. None of the 
others reply because they're all dreamers. They'd rather just ignore what 
you say, and try not to comprehend.
Thats not really all I have to say.. I can't quite put it into words...
Write me about it..

I fell in love with a girl on a shampoo bottle today.
An off-the-rack beauty but there was something in her eyes.
I do this alot lately, but I've always been this way.
I want to hold her tight and show her she's special.

I fell in love with my mother the first time I heard her voice.
She was talking to me.  No one else.  Just me.
My father soon followed.  I wasn't even in school yet.
The first time I fell asleep on him on the couch.

I fell in love with the earth the first time I walked on her.
Rolling hills, cornfields, and forest streams.
Breathing in electric air and wash away my doubts.
Mud between my toes and rain on my face suits me just fine.

I fell in love with all the girls I met.
On TV, in real life, and in my imagination.  (and on yabbs  :)  )
The Mind of Man has earned my affections also.
His triumph, his masterpiece, his passion.

I looke in the mirror today.
Guess what I saw.
I think it's happened again.
I'm in love.

That's right.  They'll appreciate that.
For God's sake!  At least look like you enjoy it.
Think back and capture those old feelings.

Have you lived my life, val?

I was in an abusive relationship where my ex-boyfriend used me as a 
punching bag for two years (seems I am always getting beat upon, usually 
either physically or emotionally, but recently mentally too wasnt I lucky 
*sarcastic tone of voice*?) and it took me forever to finally find the 
courage to leave him...even though I stopped letting him victimize me only 
recently.

Hi there, my friend. I feel like I owe you a bit of gratitude. *hug* You 
really saved my life, hon and I will NEVER forget you for what you have 
done for me. I love you, lil brother! <G>




The Blue Knight
---------------

The fire set behind the mountain
The indigo blanket had fallen
On a world of darkness inside a silver box

A cold silver box....
Where life drains and the sword cuts.

Earlier in the day, 
I perched upon a crag upon the clifff
As the sounds from the ending day
Floated upon my ear

I was deaf to those sounds...
Blind in the antiquity of the culture.

As I sat upon the bluff
Above a sea misty with fog not yet burned 
Off by the midday sun
I was given an apocalyptic sign

The Mage from the Medes and Persia
Proclaimed the event.

High above the sea turbulent with the past
There was a lone hawk flying
Looking for innocence upon which to sup
It was then that the premonition of death
Surrounded my heart and turned it cold.

Like stone from the altar...
The sacrifice had already been made.

Only I did not know it yet.

Upon arrival in the Dark Temple
I pulled my cloak around me
Determined to finish the voyage which I
Had neither the courage nor will to end

Alone.....I became bathed in scarlet
I became one with darkness...

I heard Sleep calling out to me,
Murmuring the sweet lulluby of promised peace
Of promised loved
Of promised protection.

I gladly held out my arms
To embrace Her...

But out of the impendent sleep
Came a voice so sweet and pure
Which saved me from the clutches of banal existence
Through kindness and chivalry

Through friendship.....
Through genuineness and honor

And it was a new vision
A new light, shining upon the mountain
Dressing me in robes of white
Replacing the shroud of scarlet

From the pain and hopelessness
Rode the Blue Knight.



Drew:

You know EXACTLY why this was written and I am sure that oyu know EXACTLY 
what it means....all of those who do not, let me tell you this: take stock 
of the people in your life. NEVER take your friends and loved ones for 
granted. We are on this earth but for a moment....and when our time has 
ended, we will not want to look back and say "I wish that I could do it

This is probably my last poem before yabbs goes down.  I guess someone up 
there is telling me politely to keep my day job  :)  For those of you who 
are wondering who this "She" is. Her name is Iris and we were together for 
almost 4 years before we broke up.  Sometimes I'm bitter about it and 
sometimes I just plain miss her.  I thought I would like to share this one 
with you, my friends.


HER EYES
--------

The midnight waters were dark and mysterious
The light from the moon reflected off it's midsts
In so many ways they were almost devious
Like the vicious black-widow's kiss.

They lapped the white sand shore
And at the center of the murky brine
Lay not only beauty, but so much more
There lay the wisdom gained by finely aged wine

And from the sea runs a stream
So crystal clear and pure
That reflects a powerful beam
Whose light I can't endure

And as I look on into that sea 
That dark mysterious mist
It stares blankly back at me
And with a smile, dilvers its kiss.


Thanx for reading.  It's been a great year and I'll miss all of you.

do you ever really feel positive about having a unique voice? God, I'm 
never going to find mine...

Yeats is the man...
"The purpose of rythm, it has always seemed to me, is to prolong the 
moment of contemplation, the moment when we are both asleepand awake, 
which is the one moment of creation, by hushing us withan alluring 
monotony, while it holds us by waking variety, to keep us in that state of 
perhaps real trance, in which the mind liberated from the pressure of the 
will is unfolded in symbols. If certain sensitive persons listen 
persistently to the ticking of a watch, or gaze persistently on the 
monotonous flashing of a light, they fall into hypnotic trance: and rythm 
is but the ticking of a watch made softer, that one must needs listen, and 
various, that one may not be swept beyond memory or grow weary of 
listening: while the patterns of the artist are but the monotonous flash 
wove to take the eyes in a subtle enchantment." _to be continued

the Gates of hell open to reveal a familar sight

it's only your mother
only the driven woman
The bitch from hell, to put it lightly

pyromaniac on a distant pyre
I remember the day when she gave me life
when she tore me down, when she lept
gracefully out of the
wedding cake
and deigned to dance with me
and sat upon the tree limb and broke down in tears
tears of blood of anguish
made hard by the fact that
I tried and failed
I am a failure
To protest and dismay and start the roaring fire again
the crow speaks in a different tongue
on the day of judgement

I watch detatched as

Ropes and coiling flesh

WHY
I do it is beyond me
When I slam into the ground I get back up
Burn the shit from my stickybrown wings
and try again

Cast out
My feelings are inaccurtate
They find the one whose found someone else
And point me in that direction
To break my haft on the stones
and trail the blood down the sand

Redflash the skies alight the burn the never ending death the scream
I can't make you hear
I can't speak the trith
You just will never feel
The way I do
When I love you

A maggot
Woremling
Serpent with my tongue forking the air blue white strikes


Lone and Alone and Lonely
They cast me out and I feel that when I fell
I became one with you
I love you all
Why else would I try to fill my hell with you?

That's my attempt to write a love poem.

the silent dusty air sorrounds me, and I fall
into the spell never broke and dispirited
as the wave on high noon with lovers feet
and red lips praise my love and I 
gaze into the sea with mystical heart and soul
soared naked among trees and sharp crisp air
played in her hair as water 
cold clean like love seen 
and I loved her more as my goddess took to the air
and I watched her limbs as smooth
as silk and white as ivory with lust
and cried my lungs in heat

Ashes paint the faces pallid from the sun's contempt

Bodies of my beloved ones impaled on Telephone poles
Twisting stickfigure children undreneath the tank treads
Snapping bone
Pulping meat
Flies thicker than light in the air
Black on my skin it pours
As the torches fly

Spread the Word
Never Rest
Spread the Word
Even in Death

Looking our lives out on the road to the Fifth Age
on the deathfed green of Titchit'lan
Spinning the shivadance wreathed in the embrace of the flames
Catarcts spreading over the babies blue eyes
Milk infected
Air befouled
The smll so sweet it blocks your nostrils up
Burning 
Dance till your skull shows through
Blow a little kiss
and blow the candles out

Will the last person to die please write the apology note?

since this place is going down, I will post one final message
not much good... but a last chance to release pent up anger :)

He looks over his casket
Sees his pale corpse, now so lifeless
Everyone around him mourning their loss
He has failed them, but he could not live on
Drugs and drink could not heal his pain

He was never good enough for them....

The seeming eternal nightmare, ends with a blade






Oh well, its not much good... but it is how *I* feel...

Solitary rock
    Hole in middle
Water cascading down the sides
    Algae grown underneath
No goal in life
    Just sits there and watches from below
  Vines that grow there and here
    Surrounding the trees out of fear
Trees climb to the sky
Green leaves waving as they go by
Although it's strange you can't deny
That these trees have learned to fly
                        away
Ripples in water alter landscape
Trees are bent and out of place
Flying dragons come and go
Bugs scatter across the top
    Leaves strewn
            across
        the
           shore
Clouds skim across the sky
Greeting fellow passers-by
Woman and child wander through
They just come to admire the view
An elder couple on the bench
As they watch, their hands are clenched
        Beautiful day it is.

Scream the voicebox severed the children wail the tide
Rushes azure hammering the shore I don't mind
The annihilating wait it burns the needs alive
I don't mind to die

Truth is a tissue barrier the ride of perceptions hide
Leathery and sticks between my teeth I feed but no one
Hears me tell the tale of when I was yound and the sky above was
Framing the world in grey and I stood on top of teh green grey 
Shingles of my roof and stretched out my arms to greet the sky and 
When I fell the silent snap of bone and thwuck of mud underneath
and I smiled

I don't mind to die

When I told her the thing that razed my brain and reduced me to the puppet 
of forces that drove my sould onto the shoals I saw the sky turn onyx and 
I reached out to gently touch it in my pallid hands and she told me that 
we were just friends and I dropped from the peak and my soul exploded 
against the ground and spread out like carnelian dreams
I smiled and proceeded to die

And I don't mind the lie

Don't know what you'd call that....

Or maybe of platitudes served up warm and inviting
Smothered in mushrooms and gravy
Or maybe someone who'll love this maggot host body and
accept my flaws
All I have to do is het around this wall befor that distant figure
With eyes of fire and a glinting stopwatch decides
The next rat is better than me

The problem is that Gordius tied the damn knots here
and I can't see clear to untie them
And my little pink paws don't hae the strength to slip the silk
out of the tightening strands and I can chew at it but my
Pink eyes are too far spaced to get a good look and then
The test is over
And I get sent back to start over again

The grass is everywhere: The ticks live in it, so check your legs for 
them when you come back in, or you might end up with the pink and red 
rings that will tell everyone you've got Lyme's: And that's something only 
a hick would get.
They'll judge you with their empty smiles
Accuse you with their vacant stares

Be where the wind is rising up the twitching hill and watch the sk paint 
the sky red and wonder where the sun sleeps and why,
And you'll never know that you are less than they are,
That you are poor and deserve to be so,
That you smell funny and dress in used clothes.

They'll tell you that you aren'tr as good as they are if you want,but when 
the deer stare at you from just up the hill,
Or you leap into the air on the back of your dirtbike and eat the sun,
And when you see the sky come to life at night a million eyes of fire,
You won't mind.

Head lolling to the side
Teeth tight and yellow a grin of mirthless night
Eyes vacant and empty brown-yellow red lined
Blood gonbe from the skin
You never forget your mother's face the day that it dies

Brown hair she frosted matted with sweat and stuck high
up on the top of her head as you lift her a doll or baby
Carried around the house and bellowing you try to get a smile,
a frown, a cough, something to give the image lie
To smash the yellowing mask of dark that's settled in her eyes
The silk housedress she wears to bed rough on your hands,
The air seems to burn, the phone off the hook you replacve
Vracked yellow plastic you punch the numbers 
and wait for them to come
As the greywhite dust swirls in the new sunlight and curses the morning

thank you for offering, but i think for right now, i have to try and 
handle things myself ... if it doesnt work, then i will ask for help

it is somewhat my fault too, but it is also his fault because he knew what 
he was getting into and knew Marcie (his girlfriend and my ex-friend) 
didnt like it, but went on with it anyways, i would love to just stay 
friends with him, but now that i'm thinking abouyt it, i dont think that5 
it is poosible, but i have to do a little bit more thinking on that 
subject ... i guess i will try to stay friends with him until he 
graduates, and then we will see what happens after that *sigh* i'm 
basically at the point where i dont know what to do at all other than 
writing letters and trying my damnedest to try and talk to him about it

Date: Mon Aug 29 12:28:49 1994

There are so many things I wish I could tell you.
It's not easy being around you these days.
Somethimes it's really easy to talk to you and
Other times trying to hold a conversation wiht you is impossible
"I'm sorry I don't know what to say"
"I'm bored"
"I'll call you back"
"I'll call you"
I'm so sick and tired of hearing those words.
I know you are a busy person, so am I, but
I try to make time for those that I care about.
Nedd to talk - but when??
(need even)
Everything out in the open - NOT!
Going crazy with the silence
Let's find time to talk
Each one listening to the other
Caring - i guess it's there somewhere
Try to be more understanding - I try, but it isnt always easy

Why is it that these days in order for me to talk to you, *I'm* the one 
who has to do the calling??
I hardly ever get a phone call from you, and when I do if i havent called 
you, it's "where have you been?"
Funny, I should be asking the same question.

Questions, now there's a new thought.
I have so many unanswered ones and to voice them takes a lot of energy out 
of me.
these days,if I could sleep for 214 hours, I would
I cry myself to sleep because of all the feelings inside.
(24 even)

Sometimes I don't know how I
Can see things getting
Any better between us.
Right now, things look as though they can only get worse
Everything turned upside-down inside and I
Don't know what to do anymore.

can't you help me please?
Why can't we work things out??
I can't go on like this anymore
Can't you help me please??


I worte this a few months ago ... it's basically going otu to the same guy 
(*who will never read this cause he isnt on here*) that the other one went 
to ....

blackened blood runs thick, and gleaming chest
thrust forth proudly, a phallic delight
manic and despairing and running, a half liason

Risng up from where I die everyday
Emerald sapphire fire bubbling in my veins
Bursting through my eyes Azure holes of hell in my face
Watching the sheep low by I screech my cackling hello
And burn them to ash blown gently on the wind

I'll kill it all
I'll take it all shrieking with me
There's no point in letting it live

You can't comfort me
Nothing can lessen this thing scratching away at my head
Hear him chitter? He wants out
So he can bite you.

Watch them die in my mind as I sit here and type this.

That's just something that occured to me

Title: Heavenly Bodies
Author: Howling Coyote
 
The moon
It reminds me of her face
So clean
So pure
So beautiful
Gazing into the white crescent in the sky
Reminds me of her innocence
 
The stars
Are like cherished memories
    of her eyes.
Those immaculate brown eyes
Gazing lovingly at me,
As I hold her in my arms,
Basking in her radiant warmth.
 
Always smiling
Always happy
In love with each other,
We are.

Title: A Maze of Darkness
Author: HCoyote

The darkness
Slowly creeps down
The stars blink their eyes
As if they were washing away the sleep within.
I held her tight
    As we gazed upon the glitter filled skies.
She asked me not to let her go,
For without me she was lost.
I quietly whispered into her ear,

   "Then hold on tight, my Queen
    For I will be your guiding light
    I will be your intricate map
    I will be your never failing compass."

She smiled at me
Her never ending happiness
Spreading joy within my mind
Spreading love throughout our hearts.

I shall lead her to safety
I shall carry her to the light.

Acid Dream
___________

trickling self morbid tie
and I want to die
and I want to fly
so, so high
         my mother ate me, and I took
a pill and went to sleep
and when it all stopped
         the green lizard popped
I broke my tongue over the
backseat of my car
and ate it, and traveled
far
into the night, my liquid love dined
    on my roast leg
          august
   my birthday child, lice
and all that   the end
        and the beginning
             I tried
  you see
it all begins with me
miles and the wind flows
     it goes
            away, into the sun
and it has begun, like a dead animal
rising, into the air dead there.
  my innerchild retches painful
    the girl speaks in tongues
      love   never     to
          is      able    last
 and the night air closes around me again
my friend, in the end
   as always
memory delving into soul
               I have nowhere
 nowhere to go   asleep
  my bloody family ties and rape
began and flowed
        in
         great circuits, and I tasted fear
  as fear is alive
and lovely, beautiful
a dank plasma guard, a womb died
   and stank of rotting life
    as america lives
     off corpses
              I see the hole, sweaty
and I leech my way
  to the surface
dreamt another dream, I said
    a blind aching dream, tasting
 the first and last
night
    and I tried to seek my goddess
 dust sex and myself
a pulsating bird
she ate the poison and made
 a red cry forth

Chitinous red skins bubbling with each step
Thousand-hex facing black onyx shining eyes
Reach up and tear the latex off of their faces
And that's what they look like inside

Watch the mandibles shear the air
Watch the yellowing antennae segments twitch
Listen to the clickk clack of their speec
As they check their rolexes and step off the curbs
step over her brown crumpled form, her wool skin,
two puppies live in there with her, albions, eyeless
she saved them to save herself

Spinning in the spiral
Spin and burn she does inside she's gone
she burns
the cracked red lines the eyes rheumy her pain oozes out of them
useless in her walking days
Sleeping daze

In January the people give me a wide space to walk in
My leather is a second skin and I flex it
The cold chewing through my lungs makes me smile
Sticky and wild I walk my hair clinging to my skin black on white
When I looked up at the 5:30 AM air I sat and 
Watched it
Catch Fire, the sky tore from a belly wound and bled glory
and as the last hold of night died the day began
Falling out of the sun's breasts

Nothing fancy, just drying dirt dropping down
and showering my head with the earth as I dig
away from the lives I've known:
The blue dot above me is shrinking now
And I know that I'll sleep when it's closed.

I've known souls far better than mine and
I'll miss their touch when I've dug deep enough
The air here is cold and wet and rancid with
Promises of sleep that never ends:
I hope never to feel that much

Grey green geodes slide click-klack under my claws
and the yelloing shine of my teeth gnaws a little,
Impotent, at my lower lip...there is no way to forget
but to hide, and no way to hide from the sounds that
flow inside my diamond-browed skull, my earth prow
and the dot that hovers above never seems to close

I thought It appropriate that the last thing I posted on the Poetry Board 
be under what is, in reality, my true name, as well as my Totem. I liked 
being Typhon, it was cute  and a literary exercise. I am a Badger.
I'll always be a badger. And in case you were wondering, the "sounds that 
flow inside my diamond-browed skull" are you all: Too Many to list,
Too Good to forget. Later

Water tastes like saline and piss as it covers me
rinses my stinking hair and washes my own juice off me
removes the taint that rises from inside me
What does this body trap inside that so fouls me

I came in my sleep thinking of her
She's still in my goddamn soul
and I can't get her out
I've tried hating her, hating me, hating us, and all that does is rip my 
chest open and show her my red and blue twitching heart
Jyust like the one in the Visible Man toy I had when i was five
She smiles that demonic mona lisa overdrive
And I hate her Gibson fetish but that doesn't
Break this Fenris chain she's stitched my meat together with

And I know now that you hate me

Electric torches line the cement paths.
Steel trees blocking the wooden cities
And woven tarps cast over the blue skies.
"We are now living" they shou at me
"CAn't you see we are living?"

I shake my head, a tear floating to the dirt ....

Where is that familiar kiis of the wild wind?
I only feel the decayed touch of a breeze
What of the salty airs dancing on the
oops on the ocean?
I can't even see the ocean anymore

the sun has diminished in power
For what is a simplegeneral against an army of little warriors
They line every wall, these miniature suns, themselves,
united five times by the sun, all by man.

The ancient moon is but a glowing corpse.
Mourned by the fading stars.
Their magic now dispelled by the long glasses......]
Some things are better left unknown.

Flashes of brilliance be lightning to her soul,
curiosity extended beyond the natural limits is like a knife,
Dipped too deep into a gift.
Nothing can be accomplished without the drawing of some blood.
She is dying, my companion;
Mother is breathing r last words.
Uttering her last incantations.
(r = her)

clarity brings her death to all of hermagic

holding my own
in an ocean of insanity
clinging to the edge
howling my anger at
being labeled
being told i'm going to be a failure
being treated like shit
by everything and everyone
for one night
i don't have to take it
i can just exist 
in this sea of humanity
a cloud of smoke
hanging over us

Hi there....got your "package" in the mail Friday....thanks...

Just wanted to tell you that your poetry always strikes many different 
images in my mind, althought what I may think of one line may be
 totally different for someone else...for no two of us communicate in 
exactly the same way. Communication is done through words and 
non-verbally, and with words, well, words are just symbols which represent 
different ideas which are shaped by personal experience/attitudes etc. so 
none of us can communicate exactly to another human what WE 
intended...however, it is possible to EFFECTIVELY communicate, and this 
you have done.

Anyway....*big breath* thanks for the poetry. It has been an interesting 
ride.

*hugs*

I have som many people I want to say goodbye to...well, at least know that 
all of you have left an idelible mark upon me that can never be 
erased...some for the good, and some not so good. Just know that I care 
for many of you deeply, and I will never forget you all.

pbj, Natalie, Artemis, Sinner, Covenant, Typhon/Badger01, 
Lestat!/Megabite.......you all (and all the others like pixy, charon, and 
many more we never see anymore) keep writing...express your soul and learn 
through experience...share your gifts with those you love...

*hugs* to everyone....
