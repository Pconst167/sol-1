<H1>BBS Messages: Alex Wetmore's YABBS</H1>
<P>
In 1991, looking for a networkable BBS program, Freshman Alex Wetmore decided
to write his own. He named it YABBS, ported it to Linux as it became available,
and opened it to the public. It ran for two years, while he updated the
software, and then died a quiet death in April, 1994. Alex has been kind enough
to put the message bases from his BBS up on the internet, where a copy of
them resides here. Good solid stuff.
