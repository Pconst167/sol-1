HI, as a lot of you know, i'm very much a dolphin lover.  
I do have a strong interest in preseving and caring for
wildlife.  My passion is centered around anti-captivity of
whales and dolphins.  This passion stems from several experiences.
after going to sea world a couple of years ago i was completely
repulsed by the condition some of the dolphins were kept in.
im refering especially to the tank where people could feed the 
dolphins.  the tank was only around 6ft deep and there were about 
7 dolphins in it, the tank was about the size of a small swimming
pool.  after such an experience, i got to see dolphins in the wild
and this experience moved me very much.  This is when i realized 
these dolphins were the lucky ones and no dolphin should have
to be kept in a tank.  For over a year now i have been doing 
light research on dolphin captivity discovering many things that
have disgusted me.

here are some statistics and information that most people do not
know:
     mortality rate for bottlenose dolphin in captivity   50%
     (after 2 years)

     from 1972-1982 647 dolphins were captured, by 1984 only
     293 were still alive

     it is estimated that 1/3 of all dolphins captured in the 
     1980's are dead as well as those born in captivity

     many dolphins in the wild may live to be 40 years old but
     captive dolphins die on an average of under 10 years old

     dolphins in captivity have been known to commit suicide
     they have been known to slamm their heads against the side
     of the pool and voluntarily stop breathing

     **this is taken from the book INTO THE BLUE by virginia mckenna

i will probably have a lot more to say about this in the future
if u have an interest please share it with me!

Personally, I'm against just about any captivity of wild animals...
Having swum with dolphins in the ocean (it was very cool... thery are 
extremely friendly animals) I can't stand to see them caged up in zoos or 
places like Sea World either... They are docile, friendly, intelligent 
animals and, as such, do not deserve to be kept captive, away from their 
family and friends, and completely against their will. Do we do that to 
humans? NO!!

Listen to me. I hate the idea of captivity, zoos or whatever. But Zoo's do 
more than simply hold animals...they breed them for wild release and 
protect them from poachers and disease. While Game Preserves are better, 
and simply executing all of Humanity or moving us out into Space might be 
BETTER options, we don't currently have the ability. If we don't have 
Zoo's , we might as well hold the animals still for the trophy hunters and 
poachers to come and annihilate their prey.

I know most zoos do more than just hold animals in captivity, but they 
could at least just put them in places more suited to their size, ie 
putting dolphins, sharks, whales etc. in a sizable tank (like the ones 
used for PERFORMANCES at Sea World) for each one (or pair if they are 
mated). As to getting rid of the human blight, pehaps we should

sorry, everyone's entitled to their opinions  :)

I lived above the Cincinnati greenpeace office near the campus for a year and
a half.  It was always so nice to come home and see them smoking filtered
cigarrets on the front step and flicking the butts into the street.  I asked
one of them about it once (some skinny punk with green hair) and was told
"Fuck off".  Little bastard almost felt some 'Appalachian fury'.  :)

And if any of you have talked to me before, you know that my life's goal is
to disband the EPA.  Come see the Ohio Valley coal mines sometime, if you
can find one.  The EPA shut us down: big time.

This is a discussion group so I don't really feel bad about slamming 
environmentalism though I'm not exactly against it.  It can be taken too far.

Hollywood is hilarious too.  Michael Stipe from REM (sorry Natalie  :)  )
led a big protest about 5 years ago against deuterium.  He said it was
being used to make nuclear weapons.  When someone goes out and protests
the making of water, I think things have gone too far.

I'm not a member of Greenpeace.
I am a member of the Sierra Club.
I also attend a place called Northland College, an Environmental/
Liberal Arts College located in Ashland WI. It's a really cool
place, has a great environmental studies program and I've really
learned a lot here. 
About environmental issues..... I thoroughly enjoy how much 
paperwork various environmental organizations have sent me to
try and join their causes. 
I personally try and do things myself... like reading the newspaper, 
finding out about issues that concern me and than sending mail 
to my local representatives and to my congressmen and women to try
and get changes enacted. 
The latest thing that I found time for was the Bad Actor Mining Bill
which was trying to get passed in Wisconsin. It would have basically 
forbid the EPA and other state government agencies from granting mining
rights to companies who had been fined more than $10,000 in the past 
several years. The debate focused around exxon and their desire to dig a 
mine in Mole Lake... A very pristine area which also happens to be close 
to a Native American Reservation.

Covenant--

I have seen SE Ohio and I agree that it is just a shell of what is was a 
few decades ago.  But I have a story that will make you even more upset.  
Remember all the talk about acid rain back in the mid-80s?  It was killing 
our forests, killing our lakes, and eating the paint off of your car at 
the same time.  The FED government spent a couple hundred million dollars 
on a study of the problem using the best minds in the US.  Essentially it 
was an effort to kill the coal industry in the US.  It was believed that 
the report would show coal as the "Anti-Christ" of fuel sources.  It 
showed nothing of the sort.  Sen John Glenn took the report to the floor 
of the Senate and testified that the report showed that emmissions from 
coal plants were not the cause of a majority of acid rain.  And that acid 
rain was not nearly as large a problem as the media and environmental 
groups had portrayed it as.  He testified that for whatever the cause, 
increased PH in northern lakes could be countered with miniscule amounts 
of lime.  Yet, Environmentalist groups refused to believe the report 
because their assumptions about coal were stronger than the burden
scientific proof.  The regulations on coal mining were not repealed and 
parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia look like Dresden after 
WWII.

If our nation were to reuse half of what it recylces, insteadof making

off... Did that make sense? I don't think it came out right... oh well.. 
anyways... I also usually carry my backpack with me, whenever I'm going to

things that people could carry themselves anyway is enormose. For example, 
I work at a Baskin & Robbins I Scream store, and frequently ppl come in 
and by 1 pint of ice cream, and then ask for a bag for it. In my opinion, 
this is ridiculous, because the contaner is better insulated than the bag 
is, and is probably easier to carry at that. The way people waste in this

There is another way of looking at this subject which very few people seem 
willing or able to see.  Here's an excerpt from the book Jurassic Park 
which pretty much sums it all up.

Although most people believe that the planet is in jeopardy, it is not.

    Our planet is four and a half billion years old.  There has been life 
on this planet for nearly that long.  3.8 billion years.  The first 
bacteria.  And, later, the first multicellular animals, then the first 
complex creatures, in the sea, on the land.  Then the great sweeping ages 
of animals - the amphibians, the dinosaurs, the mammals, each lasting 
millions upon millions of years.  Great dynasties of creatures arising, 
flousishing, dying away.  All this happening against a background of 
continous and violent upheaval, mauntain ranges thrust up and eroded away, 
cometary impacts, volcanic eruptions, oceans rising and falling, whole 
continents moving... Endless and constand and violent change... Even 
today, the greatest geographical feature on the planet comes from two 
great continents colliding, buckling to make the Himalayan mountain range 
over millions of years.  The planet has survived everyting in its time.  
It will certainly survive us.

    "Just because it lasted a long time, doesn't mean it is permanent.  If 
there was a radiation accident..."

    Suppose there was.  Let's say we had a bad one, and all the plants and 
animals died, and the earth was clicking hot for a hundred thousand years. 
Life would survive somewhere - under the soil, or perhaps frozen in Arctic 
ice.  And after all those years, when the planet was no longer 
inhospitable, life would again spread over the planet.  The evolutionary 
process would begin again.  It might take a few billion years for life to 
regain its present variety.  And of course it would be very different from 
what it is now.  But the earth would survive our folly.  Life would 
survive our folly.  Only we, think it wouldn't.

    "Well, if the ozone layer gets thinner - "

    There would be more ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface. 
So what?

    "Well, it'll cause skin cancer."

    Ultraviolet radiation is good for life.  It is powerful energy.  It 
promotes mutation, change.  Many forms of life will thrive with more UV 
radiation.

    "And many other will die out."

    You think this is the first time such a thing has happened?  Don't you 
know about oxygen?

    "I know that it is necessary for life."

    It is now, but oxygen is actually a metabolic poison.  It's a 
corrosive gase, like flouring, which is used to etch glass.  And when 
oxygen was first produced as a waste product by certain plant cells - say 
around 3 billion years ago - it created a crisis for all other life on our 
planet.  Those plant cells were polluting the environment with a deadly 
poison.  They were exhaling a lethal gas, and building up its 
concentration. A planet like Venus has less than one percent oxygen.  On 
earth, the concentration of oxygen was going up rapidly - five ten, 
eventually twenty-one percent.  Earthe had an atmosphere of pure poison! 
Incompatible with life!

    "So what is the point?  That modern pollutants will be incorporated 
too?"

    No.  The point is that life on earth can take care of itself.  In the 
thinking of a human being, a hundred years is a long time.  A hundred 
years ago, we didn't have cars and airplanes and computers and vaccines... 
It was a whole different world.  But to the earth, a hundred years is 
nothing.  This planet lives and breathes on a much vaster scale.  We can't 
imagine its slow and powerful rhythms, and we haven't got the humility to 
try.  We have been residents here for the blink of an eye.  If we are gone 
tomorrow the earth will not miss us.

    "And we very well might be gone."

    Yes. We might.

    "So what are you saying? We shouldn't care about the environment?"

    No, ofcourse not.

    "Then what?"

    Let's be clear.  The planet is not in jeopardy.  We are in jepoardy.  
We haven't got the power to destroy the planet - or to save it.  But we 
might have the power to save ourselves.


Rather lengthy I will admitt, but I think it gets a point across.  Let's 
face it ....the planet's gonna survive with, or with out us.  The best we 
can do is to prolong it's livablility for our species.

pbj not to sound like i am bashing ya or nothin but the last time i 
checked trees were a renewable resource . yes it does take longer to grow 
but that is why selective cutting was created.  you selectively cut 
certain trees and leave others to grow then you replant the trees you took 
in the end everything ballances.  and as far as pesticides trees dont need 
those either .  

     I was born and raised in a small northern wisconsin town that 
survived off of the paper mill there i have been to many of there 
operations because my father is a foreman there using selective cutting 
process i have never seen an area were the wood was harested for our mill 
that suffered.  we still had plenty of animals and birds and bugs in those 
areas as in others in fact there were at times even more because it 
created open spaces for food to grow for the herbavores.  

well thats enough for nowoh one last thing the mills in wisconsin also 
used a mixture of 50% wood 50% recycled paper now i cant speak for the 
rest of the mills b ut this works just great and wiscosin still has

Since you grew up near a mill, could you, or anyone else, try to clear

instead of plastic and styrofoam because it seems more environmentally

Bleaching of paper ends up with the subsequent production of waste 
dioxins, the same carcinogens found in Agent Orange and other herbicides.

Production of plastic isn't so much environmentally irresponsible as the 
*solvents* and reactions used.

If you want to stick with paper, go with unbleached products.  And beware 
of claims of packaging made with "recyled" cardboard.  Cardboard, in true 
essence, is reconstituted paper.  Read the post-consumer content and make 
sure it is acceptable; EPA requires at least 35% to be called recycled.

Are you certain recycling aluminium pollutes more than mining new ore?  
Recycling previously mined ore uses a third of the electricity, as the 
separation of Al from the ore uses a shitload of juice.  Using less 
fossil-fuel driven electricity would be less polluting...

Also, UV B radiation levels have been steadily increasing... The CFC-ozone 
reaction may have scientific merit; what remains is to draw the 
colleration *scientifically* with more studies.  Until then it is always 
wise to wait until we're sure.

as far as energy is concerned it now takes less energy to make paper than 
styrofoam and plastic although a few years agoo it wasnt that way.  as far 
as pollution is concerned yes paper mills do cause some pollution but , 
with all of the new technology in preventiong pollution in the papermill 
industry it has been drastically cut down although it hasnt been 
eliminated.  compared to plastic and styraphoam mills paper mills cause a 
little bit more initial pollution but when you figure in that styraphoam 
stays around for about 200 years because it isnt bio degradable it makes 
me think that paper is alot less polluting .

The answer to your statement is so obvious, drink driving is dangerous, no
thats too kind, stupid, irresponsible and anti-social. But so also is driving
whilst under the influence of other narcotics. Its not the drug thats doing
the killing in that situation its the person who is unable to respond to a
situation as the result of being intoxicated.

In the case of alcohol, you won't blame the drug would you Deluge, so why

First, I am a member of Greenpeace, tho, like any organization, it has its

Second, it is absolutely true that CFC's don't decompose ozone. They are, 
however, a catalyst; it is the exposure of ozone to UV radiation in the 
presence or CFC's that leads to a breakdown.

Third, Hemp kills. Just as alcohol kills, cocaine kills, or apple
juice kills. Everything you consume contains something toxic to your 
body. The Cypress Hill album (if I remember correctly), attributes a high 
death toll to alcohol which includes accidents (i.e. DUI). Not only do 
they ignore the accident factor, they also ignore other factors (i.e. the 
damage the smoke inflicts on your lungs, etc.) 

Who knows how many cases of lung cancer can be attributed to hemp?

zero.

the only deaths that have ever come from hemp have come through accidents
while high (like crashing a car).  no deaths can be attributed to hemp
itself or smoking it.

of course since it is an illegal drug not a whole lot of careful scientific
study has been done on it.  what has been done was done by very biased
organizations and has been considered un-useful by the scientific community.

with regards to smoking it hemp does have some different properities from
tobacco in that it opens up the lungs, making it easier for your lungs to
expell the smoke itself.  tobacco doesn't have this property.  this is one
of the reasons that hemp is seen as having some medical uses for the
asmatha community.

disclaimer: i don't have any direct evidence for this, and it all comes as
hearsay from the hemp faq and other sources that i've read.  if you're 
in more of this stuff you should read the hemp faq, which you can get from

I hate to bring up a negative post about sharks, but I saw a really cool 
special on shark attacks on surfers this weekend.  Seems as if sharks have 
really bad eyes (Sorry Badger01...) and mistake paddling surfers for seals 
or other tastey morsels.  Some great stories about seeing something rise 
out of the waves and go after them.

One other thing.  When I was much younger I was down in Hilton Head, SC a 
few days before a tropical depression blew in.  In a foot of water you 
could see small (4-6 inch) baby sharks swimming around.  We thought it was 
cool so we would catch them in buckets to get a closer look (don't worry 
we released them unharmed).  Is this normal behaviour?  Was it because of 
the impending storm?

Why do you think sharks attacking surfers is negative? Sharks are 
PREDATORS...they eat meat, and yes, occasionally they mistake surfers for 
seals...but they don't eat the surfers, they bite them, taste the man 
taste (For some reason I don't understand, Humans are the most unpalatable 
animal to 99% of the worlds predators) and usually let go (NOT always, but 
usually) And even if they don't, do the ten or fifteen attacks a year 
really equal the MILLIONS of sharks killed every year? Doubtful,
and besides my point is that Sharks, Wolves, and other endangered animals, 
while not cute and friendly like the dolphin, are even MORE important to 
the foodchain (Without natural arch predation, species expansion leads to 
species extinction)

the cougar is a dangerous killer. Yes, he is. But compared to man, he's an

are trying to get the cougars protection revoked, so if they see one, 
instead of avoiding it, they can kill it. This is typical human arrogance.

playful. (this doesn't just happen in the movies). granted, I have a

All too true, my friend. As to why predators are good looking: wouldn't 
YOU like it if a stupid animal who thought you were "cute" came right up 
to you, practically into your jaws (ie that stupid woman in Alaska who 
jumped the fences around a polar bear's cage to get closer for a better 
picture of the "polar bear that looked SO cute when it was asleep..."). 
It's yet another tool they employ to catch their pray. And wolves, as well 
as most other predators, ARE "harmless cute." They will only attack humans 
if the humans attack them first. We stupid humans think that WE own the 
world, but the animals don't see it that way, and if we invade their 
territory they respond the same way that, for instance, the US would 
respond to an invasion from Canada: they attack back. (that was TOTALLY 
hypothetical, so don't get on a thread about how that'll never happen,

Very good.  I would think that the electrical properties in the storm
may have a tremendous effect on their activity - so much that a .001 of
a watt could drive them crazy.  If you saw any of the D channel this week
they showed how electricity increases their hyperactivity.  I think
that any lightning produce may have sent them in this direction.  If 
there are any oceanographers out there, it could be a sign that a
terrible storm is coming.

Here in Australia, large bush fires are a way of life.  We have many 
species of plant here which RELY on fires to crack open their seed pods.  
Everything which seems bad, usually has a good side to it aswell.  And 
although the fire may or may not have been started by natural causes, 
fires are natural, and as such, are pretty neutral in the good/bad stakes.

Not only were plants destroyed but 10 structures and over 7000 acres of 
pondeerosa pines and buck brush were burned (sctually I guess those ARE

This fire was so big HOW BIG WAS IT it was so big that when it first

the reason that the fire was so big was that the forest had so much
fuel in it (baby trees) that it could burn for ages.  the big trees (which
are a lot more resistant to fire) were cut down long ago for logging
purposes.  if nature did its thing naturally fires would hit a forest every
few years (10 or 12), burn out all of the trees that weren't strong enough,
and let the big ones live (darwinism)...forests shouldn't be so thick that
walking through them is hopeless...right now they are just way too crowded.

let the forest fires burn within the forest, and just build breaks near
homes and towns and stuff.  the forest fires have been burning for 1000's
of years and the forest has survived...we as humans have done a lot more
damage to it in the last 100 years than it ever saw before.

   I realize forestfires have little impact on the forest as a whole, but 
when that fire is man-made it kinda pisses you off.  All the people that 
lost their homes to the fire probably feel kind of cheated.  

   I agree that fires CAN help the forest, but this one didn't.  Nevada is 
in the middle of a 10 year drought and thus the trees were as flammable as 
gassoline.  It's scary to watch a tree literally explode into flames, even 
the adult ones, and within seconds they are nothing more than a pile of 
smoldering cinders.  If we wern't in the drought, and there was actually 
some humidity in the air (it averges about 5-10% here) the situation might 
have been different.....maybe the oldgrowth would have spared and the 
forest could continue .....but as it is there is nothing left on 7000 acre 
of ex-forest land.  And as I'm writing this there are about 3-4 other 
forest and brush fires within 60 miles of my house.  One fire in the 
middle of nowhere would aid in evolution...but here in nevada it's a 
freaking (no pun intended :)) warzone.

Grieves, the reason the fires happening now are so bad is because of the 
Forest Service's actions! Of course, one can't blame the forest service 
alone- the timber industry is the other main culprit. The Forest Service, 
believeing it was helping to *prevent* fires, replanted areas burned out 
by fire. The only problem is that these new trees do not survive fires- 
they feed fires. Tho most of the old growth has been chopped down by the 
timber industry, what's left is destroyed because the flames are too 
intense (fed by the young trees). 

Conservation doesn't make things worse - meddling makes things worse. The 
Forest Service should do us all a service and let the forests recover 
naturally from fires and stop actively dousing wild forest fires. 
(focusing on protecting homes and lives would be a better expenditure of 
effort and capital.)

Yeah Typhon, that sounds pretty right to me (about OZ having some of the 
worst fires in the world).  But we don't have forest fires or brush fires. 
 We call them bush fires.  :)

Although I know some places in America have fires as bad as what we have.

As for greenies (tree huggers), most of the ones we have hereare more 
interested in attending protests and stuff just for something to do than 
out of a serious concern for the welfare of the bush.  They think "Wow, if 
I go chain myself to the front of a bulldozer, I might get my face on TV".

Logging is a NECESSARY evil I think.  Sure, it has it's bad effects, but 
we sure couldn't get by without it either.

My advice to greenies is to a) get a haircut, b) get a job,  and c) get a 
life.  If they are seriously concerned about the bush, there are much 
better ways of going about it's conservation than protests in loggin 
areas.  We get a lot of that out here, and the interesting thing is, the 
state the greenines leave the place in is attrocious !  Incredible amounts

clear-cutting is wrong and we should limit ourselves to taking only as

mainly on logging.......If it werent for the loggers that town wouldn't 
exist, mainly because the logging above the town (on the sierra buttes, 
anyone heard of em?)saved the town from a MAJOR forest fire just a few 
years ago.  We had to evacuate and everything....mondo bummer.

i'll agree too that logging is a necesary evil, but i i still think we should
be careful as to what we allow them to do.  

and don't forget that the logging industry isn't really interested in logging
either ... just profit.  like many of the companies in the us they are still
very short sited and (i don't think) are still not looking too deeply into
the crystal ball

Excuse me, spotted owls.

There was a report back in '93 that in Oregon, the spotted owl was more 
prosperous in second growth forests due to the fact that the increased 
undergrowth caused by more sunlight allowed for more of their prey
 to thrive (field mice and others I guess).  I guess they will need 
another reason to run the loggin industry out of business.

as to the highway bit, at least the government would have the descence to give

Hey, it's not about the owls!
People in the environmental science biz. call the spotted owl a
"bellweather species."  They use it to test the general health of 
the entire ecosystem, that being Northwest American Forests.  They
mesure how well the owls are faring in order to determine how well
the entire ecosystem is doing.  It doesn't matter if the owls can 
survive in an urban setting.  If the owls are dying in the forest, then
the thousands and millions of other species that live in the forest
are dying too.  Granted, a few species may even profit from human
destruction of the ecosystem, but the logic is that if the owls are
dying, then the entire system is thrown out of whack by human
intervention.  The species in the forest took millions of years to evolve.
Some trees live for over a thousand years.  Human greed, stupidity, and
short-term thinking cannot justify the destruction of an entire
ecosystem which has as much right to exist as we do.

are crops.  Most logging companies don't even touch the old growth, they

"Why cry for the ecosystems?"

I'm concerned about the millions of species that are unique to each 
ecosystem because I believe, firmly, that every species on this planet has 
a RIGHT to be here.  I also believe that humans have no right to deny any 
species existence.  It may be true that we have caused some species to 
become extinct.  It may be true that nature allows some species to become 
extinct on their own.  That's evolution.  But what humanity is doing to
this planet at the moment is not right.  So many species have become
extinct in the last century that scientists can't even gauge how much 
damage we've done.  It's tragic.  It's unjust.  And we're responsible!
That's why I, and a lot of people like me, are "crying" about ecosystems.

have a right to quality health care, or so Bill says.  I also have the 
right to affordable housing, or so Bill says.  I feel that animals are 
impinging upon my rights!  In fact, they are denying me my rights!  

How can I have my house when the spotted owl makes it so I can't get 
lumber?  How can I have affordable health care if the Furry Tailed Vole 
won't allow me to help build that superhighway because it migrates across 
the Old I-80?  I am being denied my rights...I am the victim here!

And when the annual frog migration hit back in the summer of '83, how many 
people died because they didn't allow ambulances to exceed 10MPH?  (see 
the Oregonian 8/11/83, pg 8B).  Don't people matter more than a frog, no 
matter how rare that frog has become?

And why is that frog and other species endangered?  It is because they 
have failed to adapt to their new environment.  They have been left at the 
curbside of hisotry.  It isn't our fault, it's theirs.  Other species have 
thrived since the introduction of man, like the deer.  The deer adapted, 
they deserve to go on.  

In everything we do (from going to church on sunday to going to Woodstock

I'd agree that a person's life or health matters more than an animals, but not
that their comfort does.  The argument that animals should die cause i want a
cheap new home doesn't work for me.

the deer adapted mostly because we killed off all their natural preditors.

and by this argument most things that kill off people are okay too.  Lets have 
a nationwide drug problem, it will kill off the weak and feeble.

They don't understand, Balistic.  We look at it from nature's point of 
view.  Just think of the possibilities man has created for the awesome 
evolutionary powers of nature.  Man is part of the ecosystem now.  There 
is no changing that.  And because we cause entropy, we are releasing the 
creativity of species everywhere.  Those who don't adapt, die.  Very 
simple.  Very clean cut.  Those who do, prosper.  Species after species 
died when something new enterred their ecosystem (when a monitor lizard 
floated across a sea on a log after a storm.  it lands and finds a specie 
of parrot that had evolved with no natural enemies and lost its capacity 
of flight.  a couple of years later...no more parrot).  Man is the 
ultimate product of nature.  It harnesses its surrounding and changes them 
to his betterment.  It modifies...it cajoles...it helps the winners win 
and the losers lose.  

Read Ian Malcolm in the novel _Jurrasic Park_.  His is the best 
explanation of the power of nature I have seen.  Nature is not a harmless, 
treed bear club.  It is nasty and brutish and we are part of it.

to live on earth overall.  Except for the mammals.  Most everything else

the increased raditation will cause more mutations to occur, helping to

a similar amount of plant matter...i've heard ratios from 1:10 to 1:40 or so...

also, if a cow is twice the size of a current cow, it would probably require
twice the amount of resources to stay alive, so a bigger cow is not necessarily
a win over a current cow...

at this point in time humans have control over most such evolution (through
controlled breeding and stuff).  so man would probably make this super-cow,
and man would be responsible...

the cow would also kill itself by eating all of these plants, since these
plants are its only food source...

Man tends to accelarate natural progression.  At our current rate we will 
pretty much make exticent any animal that needs its own land to live in...
we'll end up with a world of parasites and rodents...

Humans are natural yes. I agree. As natural beings with no natural enemies 
and no one oprey species, we exploit and overfill our niche (All omnivores 
will do this unless stopped by arc-predation, leading to their own 
extinction.) We will succeed in killing ourselves off fairly soon.

On the topic of the Super Cow "Wonder Cow", I was only dealing in 
hypotheticals.  I never said that the cow could solve the worlds food 
problems...I said protein problems.  Big difference.  And the cow was said 
to "like" eating the plant not that the cow was totally dependent upon the 
plant for survival like in som symbiosis.

If man is an animal and animals are parts of nature then isn't man a part 
of nature?  And because he is part of nature how is anything he does 
unnatural?  

Other species have come along and totally whiped out other species, but we 
don't hold prayer vigils for them.  This is human bashing at its highest

well, i don't consider myself an environmentalist or anti-human in any 
way.  but i do think that we destroy toooo much of the environment.  we 
kill animals for fun.  it's called deer season.  my family participates 
every year.  my family doesn't need the meat to survive.  they just want 
to sit in the forest, drink beer, tell stories, and maybe kill bambi.  
(not that anyone has actually gotten a deer recently.)  but my point is 
this: we do more damage to the world than we have to to survive.  we're in 
the process of wiping out everything that is in technology's way.  we have 
to pay more attention to the environment, or else there won't be and more 
forests for my family to sit in and drink beer.

gonna stop natural selection among ourselves.

i think the USDA should start tainting beef at random (as if its not done

   I understand your point and I agree that we are advancing too fast for 
some species to keep up, but the fact remains that we are the dominant 
species and we cant help impacting the environment in some way or another. 
 Mother nature likes to destroy just as much as we do.  You can't expect 
to all of the sudden stop human advancement.  Eventually we will colonize 
other worlds and leave Earth as a nature reserve, but until then we can't 
stop impacting the ecosystems without halting technologival advancement.

   Valid point, humans actually have stopped evolving.  In the good ol 
days, a near-sighted person would have been lunch for a smilodon, but now 
he gets glasses, thus passing the near-sighted gene to his off spring.  
(sorry to offend any near-sighted ppl out ther, I have atshma and thus 
would have been killed off too).  Humans have eliminated their own natural 
selection because we feel sorry for anyone with a medical or physical 
problem.  One day we will be the sickest species around.  One can only 
hope for genetic engineering...

i hope that genetic engineering doesn't become a reality.  because then 
those with 'undesirable' characteristics will be considered inferior.  and 
who does the deciding of the 'desirable' characteristics?  why those in

i agree with this fact.  I've never said we should keep from impacting the 
environment.  

>  Mother nature likes to destroy just as much as we do.  

Except that mother nature is much more random than we are, and is perfectly 
willing to take humans down a peg as well.

> stop impacting the ecosystems without halting technologival advancement.

i don't remmeber when i said we should become cave-dwelling apes again, except
to counter what was (IMO) an equally extreme example.

i realize that we will have an effect on the ecosystem in everything we do.  
What you have to realize is that we can potentially have a less detrimental
effect, if we're willing to give up a little of our own comfort and convenieice

for example, if people were willing to walk more or ride bikes, or use other
less poluting forms of transportation than the current a-car-in-every-pot 
situation that we have, ozone and carbon monoxide levels in the city wouldn't
be as bad.

As i've said, the argument that we're just another species tooling our way 
through life isn't one i really buy.  I agree we're pretty much just apes with
bigger brains, and we still have some reminants of our former evolutionary 
selves, but we also have a few "gifts".  When we destroy a wetland so we can
put in a mini-mall, its not a random, mother-naturesque act.  

my point is still that we have a greater responsibility for our actions 
and their detrimental (or positive) effects on the ecosystem, because we have
a much free-er hand in our own actions.  

If the uber-cow decides to destroy all of one type of grass, its cause it had 
little choice in the matter, it was eat or survive.  If we destroy all of one 
type of grass, its usually cause we wanted a dairy-queen.

   If genetic engineering was controlled by a monopoly, then yes it would 
be unfair, but if it was used to create cures for diseases and 
more-adaptable animals then I feel it would be beneficial.

We could argue about this for centuries and get almost nowhere, oh well, I 
don't think humans have ver been completely curtain about anything.  Some 
good news on the CO3 front though.  I think hydrogen will be the fuel of 
the future.  Not only is it highly flammable, but when you burn it all you 
get out the exhaust is pure water.  Another good reason to suck on a 
tailpipe :)

i wanted some feed back to a problem that i discovered this week. will 
driving down a dirt road near my home i discovered a swamp that had been 
totaly killed. if you have ever seen a swamp you know that it is normaly 
full of life. death giving life. but what i have seen was a barren waste 
land turned totaly white from a kaolin plant neer the swamp. it was like 
going through a blank spot in a music tape. no sounds...no 
movement...nothing

i am not what is known as an eviromental whack-o but what i saw caused a 
rage that cannot be stopped. i have hunted in the swamps for years. i am 
at home in the swamp and respect it's purpose but to see one totaly dead 
was to much... what can i do short of blowing the plant to cosmic dust

not a whack0 just a human
