Get a clue, man, we had *major* offensives into NV.  We bombed them into
the fucking stone age up in Hanoi.  You all are just talking about
*ground* offensives.  By your standard we had no offensives in Iraq
either.  The fact that the NVA and the guerilla army were still able to
kick the US Army's ass in _high_style_ in the face of insane military,
civilian and infrastructure damage is a tribute purely to the conquest
of ideology over technology.

If I remember correctly, the NVA did not kick the US army in high style.
The NVA suffered more casualties than we did, but they just didn't give
up.  I don't know what the ratios were, but it was more than 1 NVA:1 US.

Hmm, well guess it depends on how you consider "high style".  I certainly
agree they suffered massive casualties.  Total losses for the Vietnamese
population (not NVA, necessarily -- including civilians) have been
estimated between one and three million dead.  Naturally our 50,000 don't
really compare to that.  On the other hand, they won against really 
incredible odds, using mostly weapons that they stole from their enemies,
without air support or chemical warfare, both of which were heavily used by
their opponents.  They furthermore defeated not one but two foreign armies
-- ours and the French before us.  I consider that quite a victory.

Imagine what it would be like to be president.  Wouldn't it suck?

Getting put in a room with a few agents to get your asshole and other 
cavities searched before doing ANYTHING?  Before going on TV, rehearsing 
every single move you're going to make, every word, evrything.  The 
president is a neurotic fiend.  

I saw him on TV the other day, escorting his wife onto a plane.  He was 
wearing a suit that looked like retirement clothes since he lost the race. 
He held out his hand as a gesture of letting Barbara get on the plane 
first.  Then he followed her in.  That took about 30 seconds.  It probably 
took about 3 hours to prepare and rehearse in a little room.  It's sick.

If the NVA operated with weapons stolen from the enemy, Then how do you 
explain the 500,000+ AK weapons that made their way into Vietname, Or the 
sudden appearance of large amounts of RPG rockets? How about those Russian 
pilots that ended up in Vietnam, How did they get there?
 
Bombing is not considered part of offensice actions. It's what is called 
Strategic warfare where the object is to destroy factories, population 
centers, and fixed military targets. Offensive actions involve pushing 
back armies and capturing targest and masses of land.

The problem with strategic bombing is that it usaully isn't so strategic 
(look at the gulf war were we ended up killing more civilians
than military).  Yes, it can be hard to decipher who is who, but that 
doesn't give anyone the right to just kill people because they are with
military personel.

In broader terms (ie, offense and defense), strategic bombing certinally 
falls into a sick offense.

The problem is defining what a "real" anarchist is since they always attempt
to defy definition by any means at their disposal.  Noam Chomsky, for
example, says "all anarchists must also be socialists" but there are plenty
of anarcho-capitalists out there, ready to defend a fundamentally
libertarian ideology.

defining anarchy?  BLAH!

I don't want to be an anarchist because that would mean I'd have to belong 
to something..

or as my friend Pete says, I'm not an anarchist because all anarchists 
want to get rid of (or drastically change) the current government.  I 
don't believe in the government, so I guess I can't be an anarchist.

Just thought I'd share those two thoughts.. 

On a lighter note, I got to hear RMS Richard Stallman talk about his 
version of "leftist anarchism".  It's such a shame, too.. I have lost much 
respect for Dr. Stallman.. Peace and Cooperation?  Yuck!

The really funny thing during his talk (which was on behalf of the LPF for 
the whole Software Patent thing) was that he described all manners of 
idiocy in bureacracy(?) currently going on in lthe legislation of software 
field, and he seemed to have a wonderful little plan which enabled him to 
wipe away all these things, by throwing more bureacracy at it..  IT was 
good.  Y'all shoulda been there..

Too many to count.  There are "back to M-L" groups like Workers World,
anarcho-syndicalists like the IWW, Trotskyites like SWP, RWL, etc., Maoists
like Maoist Internationalist Movement, and the RCP (hah!), democratic
socialists like DSA and the Greens (sort of).  You name it.

Well the IWW (Wobblies) are quite well known among unionists, which is
a pretty big chunk of people, and when people say "The Communist Party" they
are usually thinking about the CPUSA, which was the main target of the House
Unamerican Activitees Committee investigations spurred on by Joe McCarthy in
the '50s.  As it turns out, the CPUSA wiggled out of a lot of charges
regarding foreign contacts (with the Soviet Union) when many of those we
have now found out were true -- the CPUSA got a lot of money from the
Soviets, though not very recently.  All that got uncovered after the Soviet
government collapsed and all sorts of records were made public.

Hi, We're organizing a Mid-Atlantic (VA, WV, PA, DC, DE, MD, NJ, NY)
Regional Anarchist Gathering in Philadelphia in the Summer of 1993. We're
planning four days of workshops, networking, music, schmoozing and
cruising. Depending on the availability of space possible dates (all
Fridays through Mondays) are July 16-19, July 23-26, July 30- Aug 2, or
Aug 6-9.
 
We want to be in touch with as many folks in the region as possible, and
we need your help.
 
Right now we're compiling a mailing list and looking for financial
support. we'd like to find people willing to be local contacts who can
copy & distribute flyers and posters and generally let other people know
what is going on. We also need people to organize nasty, grungy rock 'n
roll shows and send us the money. Or, if you're in a band who would like
to play a benefit we organize, let us know that, too. Of course if you
can come by cash in any other ingenious ways, feel free to send it along.
 
Our organizing meetings are on the first Sunday of every month at 12:30
pm at 4722 Baltimore Ave, Philadelphia. for more information, call Wooden

where you apply the theories of government to running a BBS. In other 
words, If you were running a BBS under a Socialist-Techniocracy then you 
would be running it like a socialist regime. A techniocracy designed after 
the U.S. would have a President (SysOp), A vice-President (Co-SysOp), A 
congress, a senate, a judicial system, etc...   
 
  I think a BBS ran in such a way would be interesting for user 
participation.

That is why I believe the end result of anarchy results in feudalism.
When a government falls, the state it represented will break apart and 
fragment into smaller states ruled central powers (kingdoms). If the U.S.
were to break up and fragment tommorow, some place like New York city 
could become the 'Kingdom of New York' being ruled by the former Mayor who 
is now Chancellor Bradly.
 
I believe that one day feudalism may return.

Re: Anarchy --> Feudalism: I don't think that, if there was some huge 
political collapse, present politicians would hold any power. The only 
thing that ensures the Mayor power over his people now is a judicial 
system which allows him to punish people who break laws. If that judicial 
system were destroyed, he wouldn't have any more power. I think power 
would fall into the hands of people who could enforce their beliefs by 
beating others down... Then they'd become mercenaries, who would be hired 
to protect individuals' private property in return for the sharing of the 
property... In effect, the mercenaries would become lords (because they'd 
control part of the land) under a king (the landowner who hired them all). 

Then, I suppose, the mercenaries would grant land to people in return for 
their working the land that the mercenaries were hired to protec (in 
NY, I guess the mercenaries would hire people to clean the streets,
 etc) Now is that monarchy? feudalism? both?

   You are 100% correct in your observation Buddha, If a huge political 
collapse takes place I doubt any politicians will even survive! They will 
be nearly the first ones executed or murdered. People would soon be 
breaking up into small groups or roaming bands of nomads. Strong leaders 
will eventually pop up and pull the people together. It will not be a hard 
task pulling people together with terror-filled images of murderous 
nomadic bands, starvation, and other such things lingering in the back of 
their minds. Soon enough those leaders would be laying claim to land which 
is to be farmed and lived on.  The people will rely heavily upon the 
knowledge, strength, and wisdom of their leader. And that leader will 
eventually appoint an hier to replace him when he is gone (most likely a 
good friend or family member). As these groups grow larger, the leaders 
will see the need for more farmland and living space and it t(will 
eventually lead to land aquisition from neighboring groups through means 
of either conquest or negotiations. And no one can control that age old 
hunger for power. soon you have one group that will formulate into one big 
group that soon becomes quite a major Kingdom or Empire.  
  
Thus you have Feudalism and Monarchy, Buddha. If the government collapses 
tommorow (And I believe it's going to happen), the inevitable results are 
going to be feudalism & Monarchy.

I'm a little unclear by what you all mean by a "collapse" of the Amerikan 
gov't. From the previous posts, I'm assuming you mean that D.C., the 
Pentagon, and all government offices nation-wide just up and disappear, as 
if by magic. (And all the people associated with them, of course.) The
aftermath of such a disappearance wouldn't be nearly as dramatic as you're 
all describing anyway -- the grab for power and land would come from 
overseas, and have little to do with home-grown revolutions. After all, 
they have the big guns and know how to use them. If, say, the political 
branches of government would up and go away, then we'd be under military 
control overnight.... and, if for some reason, ALL governments and 
militaries vanished, our fate would lie in the hands of the national and 
multinational conglomorates.
 
Anyways... the point I'm getting at is that the aftermath of the collapse 
depends highly on the nature of the collapse itself. And I doubt if the 
government came to an end, many people would really notice. They're too 
busy watching TV.

   I am sure if the process would repeat itself, But I am sure it would be 
rather close. The main thing about monarchies of the past was that 
religion played a key part. I am not sure if it would in the future or 
not. However it may turn out you can be best assured the end results will 
be more intense than the last. It may go so far as to where power
is always inherited in a darwinistic manner (survival of the fittest) 
where power is acheived through domination and the removal of foes. 
 
  America just hasn reached the era in her history yet (I believe), But I 
think that it may be inevitable. 
 
  I really would not call it Monarchism, I tend to lean toward centralism 
acheived by divine right, or at least it will develop that way.

  Sure it has, most of the nations of Europe have implemented it's 
theories. The problem with socialism is it lives by the fantasy that ALL 
people are equals and/or the working class are the ones that should be 
embodiment of power, and success should be punished with burden. In 
socialism there is no individualism, there is only collectivism. I used to 
be a Socialist, But not long ago I stood before other fellow Socialists 
and denounced Socialism (and socialist!), and renounced my Socialism.
 
  Why did I do this?  The answer to that is quite simple, It has become
quite clear that the Socialist Movement(s) have been identifying itself 
more and more with other radical left-wing groups that I have a great 
hatred for! Those left-wing groups being Liberals, Homosexuals, Feminists,
Marxists, Other Socialist groups, Democrats, Cultural
Awarness organizations, and enviromentalist! (Quite a liest eh?)
 
  I might add I was quite sick and tired of left-wing politics altogether, 
It is turning into one big cesspool of class-envy and criticism. Just ask 
any socialist today, they are all blinded by class-envy and criticism of 
the right, you can't have a political conversation with a Socialist 
without Class-Envy or Criticism popping up somewhere in there.

  Oh no! You're right, The Roman Empire did not come to a sudden climatic 
(and dramatic!) end, It gradually fell apart over time, Decay as it might 
be. What I mean by an abrupt end here in the U.S. would be more like the 
end of the Republic in Rome. ie; Some great disaster or Assination that 
would would split the people so badly that riots would a
break out, and eventually lead to armed conflict. State militias and the 
army might split and in the end, the government as we know it would die 
and the declaration of an Imperator would take place. America could 
fragment into smaller states.

from optik's writings, the most i can glean of his criticism of socialism

he has given no reasons for denoucing socialism, other than "it's a bunch

FASCISM
  Let enlighten you here Buddha, It's easy to see you are only familar 
with the old Webster definition of fascism. Fascism is Nationalism
in the highest degree, Fascist regimes seek isolation of their borders 
which means no immigrant. (ie; America is for Americans only, No outsiders
allowed in), Fascism uses brutality to enforce law in some regimes. But is 
that bad? I could form the Amercian Fascist Movement tommorow and it could 
include people of all colors (Black,White,Oriental) and it's purpose would 
would be anti-immigration and the promotion of American values only, which
means all those (foriegnors) living here now would have to abandon their 
non-American cultures and accept the American culture.  
 
The assumption that fascism has to be racially motivated is another
liberal (and left-wing) assumption. Why is that??? Because the liberals
and left-wing groups promote the most racist policy
of them all; Multi-Culturalism.

I was appalled.  Obviously he had never really thought about anarchy and 
decided to put it into a category with all of his negative emotions - 
hate, anger revenge, etc.  I infromed him that the true anarchist (in my 
opinion) is one who is dedicated to overthrowing the status quo and create 
a new structure based on the concepts of responsibility and personal 
freedom.  We had an interesting chat, since even after I told him my

A while back, you meantioned in your discussion of fascism that if America 
were to "become fascist," (quite a feat...) then its borders would close 
(I know this is simplified) and all of the AMERICANS inside would have to 
embrace AMERICAN values, regardless of their ethnic origin.  

The trouble being...then you have to define AMERICAN culture, and I thik 
you'd have a hard time doing that without acknowledging the presence
 of ethnicity in American culture. 
Which, it seems to me, kind of negates the purpose of fascism, doesn't it?

RE: Definitions of anarchy.  

It's funny, isn't it...how definitions get *$&%ed up depending on who 
wants to use what word to mean what and it what context?  I've always 
considered myself "anarchist," but (aside from recreational reading of The 
Anarchist's Cookbook...mostly for the drug recipies..) I also always 
considered it to be a purely personal thing.  In other words..you don't

And Id have to agree, anarchy is almost entirelly a personal thing.  It 
can be interpereted and defined in enough different ways that almost no

Then of course, there's "Hey, we made a pipe bomb.. we're anarchists

The Anarchist's Cookbook can be ordered from a bunch of places, it's 
usually $20+. Frankly, I don't think its worth it considering that the 
info is 20 years old and better techniques for doing most of the stuff in 
there can be found floating around cyberspace (for free, might I add). The 
drug stuff is OK, but I have heard rumors about how accurate the recipies, 
etc, are. You'd be better off ordering some of the more recent stuff from 
Books-By-Phone or FS Books or Loompanics... Better info and price...

Altough it says from "Laurel" it's actually novice and I just coudn't--for

The only copy of The Anarchist's Cookbook that I've seen for sale was at a 
coffee shop in town (this town is Bowling Green, Ohio...which is worse 
than Dante's hell...) called Grounds for Thought.  However, I think it's 
gone now.  The library where I work, which is the Popular Culture Library 
at BGSU also has a copy, though I'm not sure if they let books out on 
innerlibrary loan or not.  It's about 100 pages...maybe I'll make one of 
those illigal copies that we're warned against and bring it home.  

It's hard to find, but I know it's still attainable, if not in print, 
because the copy I saw at the coffeeshop was new.

it would be illegal.  but I bought the Anarchists in Minneapolis (i'm sure

and the rest was killing people (which I don't do..) so it was pretty

Okay, I've got a little social commentary for you all:
Tomorrw, I go tto court to defend my right (?) to not be beat up by big 
men w/ guns--namley, the cops.
The COPS broke into my home a month ago, chased me down when I tried to 
run from them, (I'll stress right now that they had NOT arrested me at 
that time) beat me up, took me into "custody"  (we'll dispute the 
definition of that later) took me to the station, threatened me some more, 
and THEN arrested me for (you ready for this..........)

*******************RESISTING 
ARREST***************************************************************

So, tomorrow I go to plead my side (thanks to the free university lawyer).
Granted, i did fight back when the cops tackled me, and they say that they 
can arrest someone with out telling they are arrested and so, I was 
arrested at the time I ran; however, I really have a problem with the 
situation as a whole.  Who gave them that right to break into my house (a 
window inmy door got broken) and take me ito "custody" for something that 
I didn't do AND  isn't illegal!  (I told someone I was going to kill 
myself)  Now, where the FUCK are my individual rights?  What kind of a 
nazi Police state are we really living in????
And those pigs have the nerve to go into the schools and brainwash little 
kids how great the cops are and how everybody is supposed to TRUst them!!

  Actually how about some useful information...all right...twice I got a

I mean tWICE this happened.  Get this:  both times I appealed the ticket

       That's a good scheme.  But if they see you there for over an hour

That's a pretty irrelevant critique unless you're prepared to 
tell us that the content of those journals has changed as a result
of becoming more available in the mainstream.  Frequently finding one
libertarian on the staff at a bookstore (not a hard proposition) will 
be adequate for them to initiate purchasing of radical literature.
Take it however you can get it.

  I'm not saying that the contents of the mags have diminished any

in the fact that such mags are available at the local mall, and
we have bbs's around here getting busted for having h/p/a sections.

Okay, you're probably right on that one.  Point conceded.  But what does 
this have to do with native Americans? We never claimed to be attacking 
them forany reason but to kick them of their land.  I mean it was no state 
secret with all the plains farmers asking the feds to drive them further 
back.  The population at large supported resettlement of the indians to 
open up more land for settlements.

Second of all, what is our moral obligation to other people.  To protect 
them?  From who?  Ourselves?  Where should we start, burn the Whitre House 
down?  Wait a second, I think we may be onto something now!  Hell, let's

Even World War II was an excuse to increase American Profits.  Roosevelt 
knew he could scam money off the British with the land/lease program.  
Also, by making America the most isolationist of nations at that time, 
Roosevelt saw his chance to spread American Capitalist Dogma to other 
nations; to turn them into sattelites, much like the Soviets did with 
eastern European nations.  By holding out, he was able to weaken thehold 
that the British Empire held over trade at the time.

The USA government is nothing more than business interest.  Foreign and 
domestic policy over the decades continues to prove this true, and will do 
so until the nation collapes into chaos and sweet anarchy.

"True" americans  shouldn't worry about the fact that this country is a 
shithole.  They should welcome that fact, and the freedom such a premise 
entails.

we'll rebuild their alters (can't have a big enough skull collection), 
then we can rearm them so they can go about their simple agarian practices 
of enslaving and sacrificing the neighboring tribes.  Militocracy, in all 
of its unbridled glory.     Maedhros    /\

Wow, what an amazingly stupid post.  Here, I'll paste it in:

Hey Paradox,

    I personally have nothing against Indians...Really!  But I think
there's one thing you're forgetting....Us newbies won the war!  So you'll
be back?  Guess what ?  We'll be waitin' for ya!  Now...I'm not sayin' I'd
condone or do myself what's been done to the Indian race but lets face it
....There WAS a war ....There was a Winner....And there was
 a.  So maybe your race was on the side of right....We had more than enogh
might to handle the problem...yeh.  If you yourself want to be happy in
this life maybe you should  learn to let go...just let go man...keep your
heritage if ya like I personally have no need of it (don't mean to devalue
it but it's yours not mine yeh?)...The harsh fact is yes there is racism
out there and unfair people and situations....that's life....you want a
freakin' invite?  Hell...eat some fruit loops...take a poop...chill!

                                                Cagim

OK, so you agree that might makes right?  What a wonderfully enlightened 
person you are!  Anyway, there was NO war, the US Govt basically organized 
the genocide of the native americans in the early to mid-late 19th 
century.  They did what Hitler did to the Jews in 1939-45, only they had 
the power (both military and economic) to avoid punishment for the crimes. 

So, do you agree that what Hitler did was justifiable, simply because he 
had more power than the Jews (also Polish, Catholics, gays, etc.) ??

Might makes right means that if I have a gun, I have every right to go and 
kill you, your family, and everyone you know, simply becaus eI am 
stronger.

That's all...

Anyway, we have the obligation to protect the rights of everyone because 
of several things: The Declaration of Independece, the Constitution, and 
the Bill of Rights.  Little phrases like "life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness" and also freedom of speech, religion, property which we 
stole from the native peoples.  Granted, a lot of the original theft 
occured before the documents I mentioned, but the most heinous
 crimes happened after the US had been around for a while.  At that time, 
I believe native americans were considered US citizens, so the gov't was 
acting illegally, unconstitutionally, and immorally in killing and 
stealing.

I didn't try to provide a solution.  I didn't say we should give the land 
back to the native americans.  We can't punish people for the sins of 
their ancestors.  We also can't run around saying "Oops!  We fucked you

Well, see the white man's point of view can be summed up in two words:
Manifest Destiny
See, at that time, we believed that God had given us the right to take 
over the whole continent, so the US just traveled across the land, taking 
whatever it could.  We really didn't need a lot of the land, as you can 
see by looking at population statistics for a lot of the midwest.  Most 
Americans live close to the east, south, and west coasts, leaving a big 
chunk of the middle and north empty (I'm thinking of Wyoming, etc.).
Oh, actually, I'm not sure what the populations were like in the 1800's, 
before the popularity of cities.  There were probably a lot more people 
living there, farming the land.  Still, we took a lot more land than we 
ever used.  There was never a question of need.
Also, the idea that we had a divine right to the land is pretty silly in a 
country where there is supposed to be a separation of church and state.

I really liked what you said about "If you don't like it here, just 
leave."  The fact is that, as bad as america is, there is really nowhere 
better.  America provides the most freedom of action than anywhere in the 
world.  It also gives the most flexibility and the most potential for 
change, which is why so many people who complain about the country don't 
leave.  They see how much better this place could be, so they bitch about 
it and people sometimes tell them to leave.  Silly.

It is not enough to simply say "Life is unfair" and do nothing about it.  
Life doesn't have to be unfair.

I guess I'll rest now...

There was no official war.  History books don't record the fighting as a 
war.  Also, compare the number of deaths of US cavalrymen to death of 
american indians.  Kind of a big difference.
Also, the American people must pay to treat the Indians better because the 
various Indian nations are considered wards of the state.  Therefore, the 
gov't has a responsibility to help and protect the nations.  This, of 
course, doesn't mean going so far as to give back land that other people 
now own.  Just because someone lives here, they do not have to give up 
their own beliefs or customs (or land) to become an American.

Anarchy is a result of social tendencies not a creation
It is the natural progression towards decentralisation and the 
mutual ownership of the means of production for the good of society.

It will not come through revolution as that creates power vacuums which
can easily be filled by dictators etc.

I think we  all agree that the American Indians were fucked by
 the CIvilization, and are still being fucked by that same afore mentioned 
group.   right? we all agree?  so please all you american indians, quit 
yellin at us, im getting sick of it, so please, lets say we start workin 
on how we can remedy the problem that we have, this is how i see the 
problem:

The US Government is Fucking over alot of the world.
They are doin it in the name of MONEY
They are also Duping the American public into believing that the world 
needs to be fucked over
and it is our duty, to try to stop them, in my mind at least

anyone differ in opinion?

what i was refering to was Guatemala, the people of guatemala elected some 
government that was actually makking real social gains, the only problem 
from the american standpoint was that those gains were hurting the big 
companies that used guatemala to make their money, so the US toppled the 
government , and replaced it with a dictatorship, so the US investments 
were safe.   thats what i was refreing too, I think that i should rephrase 
what i said tho, a country can make social  reforms as much as they please 
but if they step on the US investors then they get toppled by the us 
government.   we do pick on countries that  are all ready cruel

I'd like to discuss the methods by which American *society* (that is, 
government, church, business [as if there is a distinction], etc.) shapes 
individual behavior towards its ends, and how a logical development in 
the education system could eliminate the resulting behavior control 
society has.  I am writing a paper and have read many behaviorists 
(Pavlov, Skinner, etc.) and anarchists theories, but I have not seen any 
convincing arguments that man can be educated *and* free.  To be more 
specific, how can education turn kids into productive auto-programmers?

I have a theory sitting in the back of my head at the moment, but I am 
waiting to hear others points of view.  Maybe they see the obvious I don't

Wow, I just kinda wonder what you're talking about.  Supposedly, people 
migrated out of Africa.  Wait, I mean Homo Sapiens evolved about 100,000 
years ago, so people maybe migrated out a few thousand years later.  I 
don't think any of the first migrations had much to with killing and 
raping, since there was no out there to do that to.  I think most 
estimates put native americans on this continent about 25,000 years ago, 
and it doesn't seem like at that time they would have had to go on a 
rampage to get here.

Here's the question, specifically, just what kind of reforms can 'we' the 
people on this board (for starters) make to create a viable and visible 
change within the framework of our government?  I'm not talking about 
broad sweeping generalizations like:  Clean up the environment, reduce 
urban crime and all that meaningless, politically right litany.  It's 
hollow, it's garbage, it makes you sound cool and sincere, but it doesn't 
do or help shit!  Talk's cheap.  I'm in no position to create legislative 
social reforms and niether is anyone else on this board, so it's pointless 
to talk about it.  
  
I'm talking about something on a smaller scale.  Something that could make 
a positive impact on the immediate.  I'm not trying to start a fight, I've 
been sincerely trying to figure this one out for a long time.

I haven't thought of anything practical to date.  Sure, I could load the 
shotgun, walk down the street, and shoot anybody that seemed like an 
asshole.  But, I probably wouldn't get very far, and besides, I'd probably 
have to shoot myself too :-)

*Maedhros smiles as, for once the board unanimously agrees on something*

I'm fucking sick to the point of puking having to listen to the Yuppies of 
Atlanta claim their neo-hippy roots, espousing brotherly love and 
political correctness.  Give a can of soup to the homeless on Thanksgiving 
Day and plant a tree--It makes me want to stick a barrel up there noses 
and wallpaper my bathroom with their brains!  Get a clue, I live in this

Well, my basic philosophy is to treat everyone exactly the same.  It may 
sound hippyish, but I'm more content with my relationships because of this 
idea.  I try to accord everyone the same amount of respect and 
understanding.  I don't talk down to people (well, I do once in a while, 
but I feel bad about it -- I'm not perfect).  I got so mad listening to 
this radio call-in show the other night where a kid called in and the 
hosts of the show ere SO demeaning to her.  I hate that kind of attitude.  
Anyway, I think that if people tried to go from day-to-day with this idea 
of generalized attitude/respect, the world would be a *slightly* nicer 
place.  This won't really fix all the evils, but for me, I feel more 
comfortable with my psyche this way.
Does this make any sense?  I hope so.

Did yo read Rothanne's post?  How'd it make you feel?  I bet I know.  No I 
don't share all of Rothanne's viewpoints, but it brings up a good point.  
I know exactly how pissed off it made you, as pissed off as I get when I 
hear someone say what 'we' (the white Americans) did to someone.  It's a 
broad and fictitious stereotype which is invoked when ever someone wants 
to be treated better than someone else or wishes to vent there anger on 
someone.  'We' did this or 'we' did that.  I can sum up all my 
sociopolitical power fairly quickly:  I'm a starving student who works two 
jobs to put himself through school.  I would have got a scholarship, but 
I'm ineligible for most of the ones which aren't taken up because 'we' 
decided that 'I', not in a minority, wasn't eligible.  If I sound 
resentful, sorry.  It doesn't piss me off really, that's just life, you 
take what your dealt.  However, when someone talks to me of the injustices 
'my' (whoever the hell they are, for the life of me I don't recall ever 
meeting any of them) people have done to them, I'm afraid it falls on deaf 
ears.  Life not treating you fair, hey join the planet.  At least your a 
minority.  You can get more help than I can.  What do the indians want?  
More money?  Not from this 'we', this we doesn't have anything to take.  
From the government?  Good luck, they're three trillion in the hole.  You 
want to have an uprising?  Fine, take the damn thing over.  Careful 
though, you might get what you ask for.  I wouldn't take the government 
over if you paid me.  Well, ok, maybe if you paid me a lot, but I'd 
probably regret it.  But like I said, if you feel like you're being used 
as a dartboard, it's probably a good assumption that you insulted and 
unjustly accused someone of a crime simply because of their heritage.  By 
the way, that's racism.

My philosophy (which is shared by all Special Forces members) is
"If you are not smart enough to see it my way, then you are too stupid
to be allowed to live." You bellyache about some pretty stupid shit.
You have a real problem that needs to be addressed. If you think 
violence is the answer to the problems Native Americans have then

    While I shudder to think that you endorse a philosophy that
if carried to it's logical conclusion would mean the anhilation
of most of the people on this planet (I assume that most people 
disagree with your views), I am comforted to note (given your
auspicious tenure with Special Forces) that you most likely lack
the mental capacity to forsee the consequenses of that philosophy.
   That said, I must grant you a point.  No doubt, violence is not
the best solution to the problems of Native Americans.  This advice,
however, is extremely suspect when it comes from an ex (or, god forbid)
current member of special forces.  Is it just me, or does it seem
hypocritical for the military man to say that violence isn't the answer?
    Of course, I want to give you the benefit of the doubt.  I might 
hope that you had LEARNED from your experience in the military that
violence begets violence, and that other methods of problem-solving 
are more effective (sometimes), and in our national/world interest 
(almost always).  But then I return to the philosophy of which you
seem so proud, and I put out of my head that you've learned anything
since basic training.  How can you learn if you're always right?

You bring up some good points however, just because a person has been
in the military dosen't mean he (or she) advocates violence. Most people
in the military detest violence because it is their blood that must be

Jughead:

    Please understand that I have the greatest respect for those
who serve their country.  Public service is, in my opinion, one
of the most noble and selfless acts that a human being can perform.
I should add, however, that public service is lot limited to the
act of toting a gun, and being willing to kill for the red, white, 
and blue.  There are other (far more productive) ways to serve.
And, of course, not all people in the military advocate violence.
In fact, most of the people that I know who are in the military 
could care less about being "military" in any way.  Most of them 
(that I know, at least) are there to get a good, federally funded
job, get free high-tech skills training, get money for college, etc.
Unlike our friend Dart, they don't want to kill anybody.  They're 
just trying to get a piece of the good life, like everybody else,
and the fact that they have to learn how to kill is just an 
unavoidable and unpleasant hurdle that Uncle Sam compels them to
navigate.  What's sad, for me, is that people have to undergo
this kind of brainwashing (training if you prefer) in order to get 
a secure, well-paying job, and serve their country.  Wouldn't it be 
better if the government paid more people to build bridges, school,
homes for the homeless, etc., and paid fewer people to carry guns?
    I'm an idealist, but I'm not so naive as to call for the complete
dismantling of the military.  We will always find a use for a Dart;
we can use people who are willing to kill and be killed for the
state, but it's costly (too costly) to maintain these people.  They 
exact a high cost on our society ... almost $300 billion every year.
Couldn't the government better spend this money somewhere else?  Let
people serve, but let them serve in a more productive way.

I'm not sure if I agree with you on that one Laelth.  As much as I hate to 
support such a vastly expensive military, in recent history we've seen 
alot of suppossedly stable and well established governments take some 
awful nose dives.  Nobody would've expected, ten years ago, to see Kuwait 
invaded or the Russian White House on fire.  But there you have it.  As 
much as I hate to admit it, I sleep better knowing we have 'the best toys 
on the block' and plenty of them.  But you're right, we could do with a 
little bit of cutbacks.  For instance, we still watch Cuba like  chicken 
hawk.  Last time I saw anything about Cuba on the news, I saw there 
national parade.  The damned army's riding bicycles because they can't 
afford jeeps.  I don't they they can throw a rock hard enough to be much 
of a threat to Western civilization.  And yes, I suppose they could do a 
little civilian work.  Hell, if anybody's drove through Louisiana on I-20, 
then you know we could do with a little new asphalt (I had to go 50 to 
keep my chasis of the road).  As far as killing people goes, it depends on 
who you're killing.  When we pop of people for political gain, it makes 
you kinda embarrassed to live here.  On the other hand, when I see old 
footage of Berlin caving in in flames, it makes me feel all warm and gushy 
inside to know it was my country who helped destroy the place.

Two questions:

2) This isn't really a question.  On the subject of protecting people from 
danger, the whole issue of crime prevention is not one of more and more 
police and more and more prisons.  If we take a look at the reasons that 
drive people to crime, drugs, etc. then it is pretty easy to see that

Ah, I seem to have failed in vocalizing myself properly.  In answer to 
your question.  Yes, I do feel fairly safe walking the streets.  However, 
this has absolutely nothing to do with the current state of US law 
enforcement.  I'm just always left alone, and half the people who might be 
a problem, I probably know.  No, I'm not a macho asskicker, and I'm not 
particularly proud of all the people I know, I'm simply from the city.  
I've survived 25 years without a scratch (at least a serious one), and I'm 
just what you would call numb.  I don't think about what I can't control.
  But, I'm straying from the main point.  There's obviously a 
misunderstanding about the contents of my post.  I never meant to 
insinuate that a military buildup was in any way corrolated to increased 
domestic safety.  The point was, as was evinced in my examples, that a 
large military was a good defense against Outside (of the US) threats.  
However, I would also point out that the military has served numerous 
functions inside the country to ease civil unrest.
  Honestly, I think a division of marines armed with heavy assault rifles 
might have had just an teeny effect on the longevity of the LA riots.  I 
know I'd damn sure stop throwing rocks if I was looking down the wrong end 
of an M-16.  In addition, the military has also shown its willingness and 
effectiveness in dealing with non-military crisis.  They provided 
architectural and humanitarian relief in the MidWest during the floods, 
they helped rebuild a sizable portion of the Florida coast after the 
hurricane, and we're likely to see their presence soon in LA if the damage 
proves to be extensive enough.
  So, in summary, although my main point was not the military's domestic 
effectiveness, it has shown it's worth in that aspect as well.  Certainly 
I don't expect much help from the military if I'm being mugged, however it 
does make me a little more comfortable to know that if the neo-nazis, or 
any other violent, radical, lunatic group decides to go on a rampage, the 
military will be more than happy to shoot them for me.
  Also, I would also like to mention that although the military's budget 
is incredibly high, it doesn't just reflect its size.  It also reflects 
its technological level.  The Gulf War presents a strong justification for 
their research spending.  When our equipment and technology reach a level 
which is so high that having a war with the third (at least then) army in 
the world sees less wounded from combat then people shooting themselves in 
the foot or falling off boats, its difficult to say the money wasn't well 
spent.  Should we have been there in the first place?  As I've said 
before, it's imaterial, because none of us could stop it.  However, if 
people were willing to go over there because their government ordered them 
to, it seems to me that that government has the responsibility to protect 
them to the best of its ability (i.e. funding research/development for 
military technology.

It's intersting rhethoric, but it's rather easy to shell out quotes for 
either side of the argument, and to quote my first philosophy teacher'
"Being dead doesn't make you an authority on anything, just a corpse".
I really didn't see a need to juxtapose anything against the Patton quote, 
what can I say, if it's his job there's no law against liking it.

As far as the quotes themselves go:
1.  Kennedy was right in my opinion.  Unfortunately, you've used him 
completely out of context.  The problems of "today" are now about two 
decades old.  It might have applied to the Cold War, and it might even 
apply now.  However, it isn't what HE meant.  If he were alive today he 
would have the option of bringing you up on charges of slander.  It might 
apply now, but if so, YOU must validate the connection.  You've expressed 
no valid reasoning, only quotes from famous people who aren't alive to 
make any kind of judgements regarding anything that's happened this decade 
(actually, I don't know anything about Trudeau, so he could be alive for 
all I know, but I doubt it- they're not nearly as effective to wuote in an 
argument).  

2.  Once again I have to agree with the quote at face value; the military 
is indeed a poor training ground for democracy.  Few hills would be 
conquered if everyone got to take a vote (I'd opt to forget about the 
damned hill, and go for tacos).  Fortunately, this is a bit irrelevant, 
since most politicians and government officials are businessmen and 
lawyers, not tank drivers.

  Quite simply, if you speak rhethoric and don't back it with reasoning, 
it's propaganda.  Mussolini tried win a war with it, to not much avail.

1. Safe on the streets?
    You may feel safe on a dark poorly lit street, but I'm not sure that 
that is the norm for the rest of society.  I'm probably speaking way out 
of line here, but I just don't see average folks like myself wanting to 
get mugged, robbed, etc.  Nor do I see the Armed Forces as a whole, with 
the amount of money spent, as a deterrant to street crime.

2. The future nature of war.
    My point in relating the miliary machine to domestic problems is this: 
Outside threats will matter less as the military downsizes.  A Marine 
officer, who wrote an article on the four types of future "warriors,"  
noted that outside *military* threats can be handled by a smalled US 
military, but that economic warfare (say with the Japanese in the future), 
or civil warfare (with the more radical psectors of society) will cause  a 
problem to the military.  It simply isn't capable of dealing
with antagonistic forces from the inside, especially if a civil conflict 
ever upscaled to a guerilla-style war.
    As to the Marines dealing with a riot, a riot is simple violence 
controlled by a mob mentality.  A civil war would take on a different 
flavor, I think.

3. The Armed Forces as humanitarian fighters.
    All I can say on this matter is that the Armed Forces are not trained 
to buil, but are more qualified on the art of
 government-sponsored killing. (on = in, sorry)  

4. The future dominance of America as a military power?
    I believe it is unlikely.  R&D would be useless without the means to 
build the weapon at hand.  As technology grows more and more computerized, 
the US is dependent upon Japan and the other Pacific Rim nations for the 
technical components which make up state-of-the-art weaponry.  God help 
this country if it ever got into a war with an Asian country. 
    I read this book by Akio Morita and another gentlemen whose name 
escapes me at the moment called _A Japan that can Say No_.  Apparently, 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has developed a fighter which can outmanuever 
anything which theAmericans could throw at them.

Maedhros:
   The Kennedy quote that you and honkfish were talking about 
seems pretty relevant to me.  If I'm not mistaken, Kennedy was
deeply disturbed by the growing power and influence of what Dwight 
Eisenhower called "the military-industrial complex," the united 
forces of the CIA, the military itself, and the many big companies
that got very, very rich on the cold war.  Kennedy wanted to dismantle
their power, to divert resources to domestic issues, and to restore our
military to "PEACETIME" levels.  Of course, we know where this policy 
got Kennedy.  He was killed for challenging the CIA, the military, 
and big business (or so Oliver Stone argues in the movie _J.F.K._).
    Given the demise of the Soviet Union I can see absolutely NO
legitimate excuse for spending the kind of money that we spend 
on defense, especially considering that we're NOT AT WAR.  Having a
large military during wartime is one thing,  but during a time of
peace?  ... with a budget defecit that's approaching $400 billion/year?
... with serious urban decay?  ... with a rapidly deteriorating 
Interstate Highway System?  ... with rising costs of college tuition?
... on the verge of a new, national health care initiative?  I mean,
really, can you justify maintaining our bloated military with all 
these other pressing concerns?
    A smaller, highly-technical force, a quick-strike military would
adequately meet our peacetime demands.  We just can't afford to have 
the government employ 2 million soldiers, though I agree that we should
protect our current (if fading) technical superiority.
    In an interesting side note, President Clinton tonight in his
"State of the Union Address" buckled to the pressure of the military-
industrial complex and agreed to maintain the military at current
levels.  And really, you can't blame him.  He doesn't want to be 
another Kennedy.  Just goes to show who REALLY runs this country.

IMPROVISED GELLITANITE EXPLOSIVE:
Materials:                       Equipment:

Potassium Clorate                Zip-Loc bags
Vaseline                         Galvanized steel pipe
                                 Improv. Blasting Cap
Directions:

This is about the simplest thing that I know how to make. First of all, 
spoon nine measures of potassium clorate into the  zip-loc bag (making 
sure that it is ground into a fine powdered sugar like density). Next 
spoon in one measure of Vaseline (or petroleum jelly). Knead with hands in 
the bag until a smooth, uniform paste is obtained. This can be detonated 
with any commerical #8 or military blasting cap. Squeeze the mixture out 
into the steel pipe, and cap the pipe. Allow for a small drilled  hole in 
one of the caps for insertion of the blasting cap. Another method is to 
roll up the zip-loc bag (containing the explosive) into the pipe. This 
will keep for longer periods of time. 

Notes:

Of course this, and all further materials are for informational purposes 
only. But if someone WERE to actually try these, the hardest thing to find 
would probably be the potassium clorate. If you're in college, use your 
own brains to steal some from the science department. I'll explain 
"Science Lab" recon in the next few messages. This explosive  is set off 
by concussion, hence the blasting cap. I'll explain those later also.

   I encourage questions and feedback, so drop me a line.....

Is this anarchy? I don't really know, but I do believe in freedom of 
information. I'm just putting on a few to those of you who have a passing 
interest in the subject. You should be able to have access to this type of 
paraphanalia if you so desire. By definition, anarchy is the absence of 
government. The government used to regulate this kind of information, now 
they regulate pornography. There's room for self-expression, do a degree. 
Call it a celebration of what we can now openly learn. If you are 
interested in this kind of material of self-reliance, and want to learn 
more, look up the following authors: Ragnar Benson(trapping, manhunting, 
survivalist guides), George Hayduke (get even, revenge, homemade 
explosives, improvised weapons and their cacheing), Seymore Lecker 
(Improvised Explosives, and Chemical Incendiares). All of these guys are  
published through Paladin Press, Inc.
 
    Above all, I don't want to offend anyone on this section. I'm curious 
as to YOUR ideas, and am fully willing to listen. If you disagree with me, 
tell me, don't get pissed off. I make plenty of mistakes. So far, I've 
been getting pretty good feedback. I thank you. Keep it coming.

Here are some of the things that I know a little about. If you have any 
curiousity, and want to know more about something, tell me, and I'll try 
my best to tell all that I know.

How to get a new identity.
Improvised explosives
Improvised weapons
The compleat rogue
Improvised lock-picking
Weapons caching
International trafficking
reconnaisance
Easy and effewctive self defense.

Not that anyone would TRY any of these things. But hey, it's under our 
freedom of speech rights to discuss these things.

No problem. Here's an easy one. Very effective.

Justin's Hellacious Smoke  Cannisters

Potassium Nitrate (drug-store)
Suger    (Store)
Sawdust  (Pencil shavings, etc. Pine sawdust is best)
Glycerin (drugstore)


Ok, what you do is simple. Grind up seven measures of potassium nitrate,  
and four measures of sugar. Grind and mix well. But in in a bowl with 
about eight measures of fine sawdust. Mix well. Next add in enough 
glycerin to form a toothpaste consistancy (about six measures). Mix 
thouroughly by hand until a smooth uniform paste has been obtained. Spoon 
this fudge into an empty coke can. Cut a few holes in it to give it 
breathing room. This can be set off by matchheads and fuse. It makes a few 
seconds to to really catch up, but when it does, heh, a whole lotta smoke. 
If you're using fuse, put a small pile of  mixed Potassium Nitrate and 
sugar, ground very finee (70% Potass. 30% Sugar) on tope of the fudge. 
This will flame, and create enough heat to set it off. Or you can hold a 
few matches to it until it catches.

If you like the Paladin Press books, and want to find them cheaper without 
ordering them, do this:
*-Look in your local newspaper, or closest large city. Find out when the 
next Gun and Knife show is, and go to it. It costs about five bucks at the 
door. More books than you can imagine. You can even thumb through them, 
and such. Happy hunting!-Justin
Oh yes, they're also cheaper than they sell them in the Catalogues. For 
instance, I picked up "New ID in America" for about $3.00. Also those 
shows have fuze, black powder, etc. No ID needed if you're underage!

Just a quick chemical note on nitrates:

While nitrates make the most popular ingredient in explosives, this is 
because of its inherently unstable state.  For you home chemists, nitrate 
is still an ideal substance, as its cheap, effective and easy to get to 
acquire.  On the other hand, there are some precautions you should take 
when handling it.

1.  If you are creating a compound, do it in a well ventilated area.  With 
a mixture this isn't necessary, as you're not altering the nitrates 
structure.  To tell if its a mixture or a compound, look at it when 
mixing.  If you can still make out the nitrate substance, then you're ok.  
On the other hand, if the nitrate dissappears, it's probably a compound.  
Many of these compounds form low-level toxins.  It probavbly won't kill 
you, but it'll give you a hell of a headache.  

2.  Mix with plastic utensils.  Many nitrates will go off at the drop of a 
hat (some will even go of if you drtop them).  So handle them gently and 
use plastic to avoid creating static electricity that might set it off.

Granted, most low-level explosives aren't that dangerous.  However, you 
might as well play it safe if you don't know what you are working with.  
Have fun you anarchists you!!!

p.s.  It's always preferrable, if possible, to find out what by-products 
are given off in advance so you can take appropriate precautions.  If you 
can, consult a chemical reactions text for appropriate precautions.

I have read with interest the debate on the uses of the military
in peacetime.  My personal opinion is that under NO circumstances
should regular military forces be used on our soil.  That is not
what the framers of the Constitution had in mind.  They recognized
the need for a "well-regulated milita".  This is what the National
Guard sprang from.  That and a well armed citizenry.  

The future of warfare is that of a localized conflict, confined to
a very small geographisc area.  Look at the Persian Gulf War.  A
prime example of what the future of warfare will look like.

As for what the "philosophy" of dart, as he stated earlier, thge truly
professional "soldier" only kills when they have to.  Killing for the
sheer pleasure of killing went out with the introduction of the
pschological testing fo recruits.  I spent time in The marine corps
and can attest to the fact that a homicidal maniac would not last
in the military.  Some do slip thru the system.  These are the exceptions
that prove the rule.

I have also seen some of the comments regarding Native-Americans.  The
flamers I ignore because they contribute nothing to the discussion.  I
have also been guilty of the same thing.  Some commenst, however, deserve
to be made.  The Native-Aamerican has been mistreated in this country.
(ex: "BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE).  What I am asking is that as was
pointed out by MAEDHROS,  all of us contribute to the alleviation of the
suffering of Native-Americans.  Be sensitive to THEIR needs and do not
turn a deaf ear to their cries.  If we do not listen,  the crisis could 
and will overwhelm us.

As for the military, it's true.  The US military shouldn't have to be on 
our soil.  Unfortunately, I trust the national guard about as far as I can 
kick them.  Frankly, I was happier with the marines in LA then if the 
guard would've been there.  I think they've had more and better training, 
and hence, were less likely to get nervous undr pressure than the weekend 
warriors and kill someone by accident.

As for the indians. Great!  Now you're talking.  Give me something to do 
to help someone out, besides rolling over dead for them, and I'll do what 
I can.  I think our generation has a different approach to 'helping out', 
though.  I prefer to help people on a personal level, but I get defensive 
and aggitated when the federal government tells me to do it.  Whereas I'm 
personally fully in favor of dissolving the social security system, I've 
never refused anyone who's asked for a little money.  Hell, for that 
matter, I don't like the government telling me to do anything.  I think 
it's reactionary, the state government here still regulates how we can 
have sex.  Damn, I think I'm straying from the topic.  Oh well, I was in a 
discussion about this last night with a friend and haven't been able to 
get it off my mind.

No doubt.
The government of the State of Georgia is a complete joke, and I hope they 
permanently get out of the lives of the citizens of the state.  However, I 
don't share the same feelings about the federal government.  Once we admit 
that there are real problems in this country, then we have to ask 
ourselves who is best able to solve those problems.  I just don't trust in
the generosity that you espouse, and that you claim our entire generation 
shares.  Before Social Security, before Aid to Families with dependent 
children (welfare), before Unemployment Insurance, and before 
Medicare/Medicade the private social services that tried to deal with 
our domestic ills failed miserably.  That's why we created these social 
programs, to aid the people that the private charities could not or would 
not help.  Histoy has proven that you cannot rely on the generosity of the 
rich, or even the middle class.  In order to preserve domestic tranquility 
(prevent a revolution) the government must provide some kind of assistance 
to those that our society causes or allows to be poor, destitute, 
unemployed, uninsured, etc.
    It's popular right now to argue that the government is BAD, that it 
can't do anything right, that it is unfailingly corrupt, and that people 
would be happier without government interference in their lives (Rush 
Limbaugh).  However, we need to see who benefits from our believing 
something like this.  The rich and the powerful do.  They benefit when we 
(who outnumber them) give away our only check on their activities, namely 
the government.  We castrate our own power when we destroy or limit the 
power of government.
    I mean, do we really think that the government is that bad?  What 
would you prefer, a monarchy? ... a dictatorship?  ... anarchy?
   Who do we think we're kidding?  We live the good life in this country, 
under the protection of this government?  People who argue against 
government are either blowing hot air (telling people what they want to 
hear), or they're hypocrites.  Take your pick.

I visited the gorgeous country of Ireland last summer. Rolling hills, 
great cliffs, georgeous place. I spent about two days hanging out around 
St. James, Dublin. Great pubs, Guinness pub draught by the keg. Friendly, 
happy, drunk people, and some fine women. Northern Ireland was a madhouse. 
There were two shootings and a firebombing while i was there; both were 
suspected to be the IRA, though they hadn't officially claimed 
responsibility yet. It's a different culture there, and I wouldn't want to 
be in the middle of it. When my friend brought up the subject of the book 
"Handbook of the volunteers of the Irish Republican Army", I don't think 
that he meant to condone what they were doing. On the contrary, he brought 
up a very good facet of literature. If you were to have an interest in a 
group, or a specific person, the best way to understand their beliefs is 
to read their literature. The IRA have some interesting arguments and 
their implementation of sobotage and geurilla warfare tactics are unique 
also. Not that I agree with anything that the IRA does. I myself, do not. 
Others are free to either believe in their cause, or not to. However, I do 
not want to argue this point. There is no winning of that type of 
argument. However, the interesting thing about seeing the other side of an 
issue gives you a much better  view of their motivations. Try
 reading "Mein Kamph" by Adolf Hitler. It describes his struggle before he 
came to power. It's propaganda, granted, but you also learn what motivates 
a man like that. The context that my friend used the book was not meant to 
promote the group, but rather to tell what parts of the specific book are 
pertinant to our discussion. Take care. -Justin

Well, personally I'd say I'm neither.  I'm definately not blowing hot air: 
simply because I really don't care if my beliefs fit the status quo, or if 
anyone else agrees with me (initially :-).  Also I'm definately not 
hypocritical.  I've been eligible for both Medicare and Unemployment in 
the past, and I've flat out refused it.  The government has enough debt 
without me whinning to it.
  While I agree that, yes, the government shouldn't have their hands tied, 
I believe it's growing to big for its own or our good.  The one thing the 
Federal government has shown itself incapable of doing is downsizing.  It 
just keeps growing and growing, finding new areas of life to control.
  As far as my personal beliefs on charity and that of our generation, I 
believe my opinion was a bit misinterpreted.  I mentioned that our 
generation seems to prefer to work on a micro scale.  I didn't however, 
mean to insinuate that our generation is uniformely charitable.  My point 
was mored along the lines that I don't think the Federal government has a 
right to tell me who to support.  If I feel like being charitable, I will. 
 If I don't, I won't.  I just don't take the socialistic view you present 
which seems to imply I have a moral imperitive to help others.  If I fall 
down, I feel its an individual's choice whether or not they want to help 
me up.  I don't think the police have the right to incarcerate someone if 
they choose to simply walk on by (ZI mean this example metaphorically, of 
course).
  I do believe in anarchy to a certain extent.  I think the government 
should insure that I don't hurt anyone, but I don't think they should have 
the right to tell me who I should be nice to or give aid to.

    For the anarchists out there, barring human tendencies not to

unadulterated anarchy?  I mean true free will, not government involving 
itself with (or absolving itself of) the responsibilities of taking care 
of poorer elements of society, not lower taxes, not less gun control, none 
of that bull.  I mean pure freedom; is it possible?
    I am beginning to see a fundamental weak point in anarchist idealism: 
education.  You can absolve the power one man (or government) has over 
you and your behavior, but how do you absolve one controlling factor 
which produces anarchist philosophy in the first place?   A teacher 
educates by "
guiding" the student to "enlightenment."  Isn't this "guiding" creating a 
barrier to the student's ability to think for him/herself?  If a teacher 
chooses what material the student eventually studies, the future mind of 
that student is shaped by the study material.
    Can a more free and more equal State exist without the existance of 
educated people?  How does anarchic theory get around this loophole?
    Anarchy is not Explosives 101, with lectures involving demonstrations 
with the neighbor's trash cans.  Its equal people, dealing with each other 
on equal terms.  Its not trying to look tough with painted leather jackets 
and chains and crewcuts, its a way of behaving like you respect others as 
well as yourself.  How does education fit into this?  Can it?

Anarchism cannot work on a purely individual level. It must have community 
support. You have communities that organise themselves, and that is 
anarchistic, because noone is telling them how to do it. The means of 
production are owned and controlled by those who use it, and they benefitr 
 from that. In such communities education is still possible because it is 
organised by that community and so the state is not involved. There is 
still the question of who decides what is taught and how, but I supppose 
that is up to "enlightened" people in such communities to decide. Such as 
is decided can only really be beneficial to those in the community..

There are many, many questions sti;lll to be answered about feasable 
anarchism, but think how much better such a society would be than our 
present one.

You bring up some very good and valid points in your argument. I never 
meant to imply that these lectures on explosives were the basis for 
anarchy. On the contrary. These lectures are simply to "educate" people. 
If someone has an interest, then I am most happy to share my accumulated 
knowledge. If someone does not like them, then they don't have to read 
them. Actually, the point that I found most interesting in building your 
argument was the facet of learning. Can an uneducated society run on its 
own accord? This is an interesting question. You can, to a degree be an 
anarchist on your own level. The government is still there, but you just 
disassosiate yourself with it. There are ways of avoiding the system. 
Would an anarchist community work? Convince me. I'm willing to listen. In 
my view, they would have to be educated. Possibly in philosophy. I suggest 
reading Plato's Republic. All throughout the book Socrates debates the 
different methods of government, or lack thereof. Keep yourself open to 
all literature. As my friend aptly stated, you may not agree with their 
argument, but you will understand them.....-Justin

time when you are fighting and living free without laws.  As soon as th 
established powers are overthrown new powers real arise, thus bringing 
more tyranny.  That's the viuscuos circle of social evolution.

A Marxist? I don't think so. Karl Marx believed in the "ideal" Communist 
society of a community being run like a business. He wanted the profit of 
the community to be divided equally among the people, if I remember 
correctly. We've hardly brought up Marxism. Social evolution, if you 
remember went from a timocracy to an oligarchy. This spurred the first 
questions of a possible anarchist society. I appericiate your input, but  
there are a few of us who were enjoying our discussion of the 
philosophical ramifications of literature, idealist societies, and so on.
In order to understand our ponderances, ask yourself the following 
questions: What is real anarchy? What is the purpose for anarchy if some 
live only for the tyrranic raid?  Take care.-Justin

If you read a few messages back, I brought up the same point that you did 
on living free without laws. Anarchy can be achieved by the individual to 
a degree. Just ignore the system. There are ways to ignore the 
government.There are ways to disappear and not have to live under those 
conditions set up by those who govern you. There is a wealth of knowledge 
available to you. Paladin Press has several of books on that same subject. 
If you are interested, I'd be happy to bring up some points on how to do 
just that. Take it easy.-Justin

  One of the prime requisites for establishing any kind of political 
theory into a working system is being able to reconcile your beliefs with 
reality.  Specifically, there is no such thing as a pure political system.
There is no such thing as a pure capitalist country, neither is their a 
pure socialist, and there won't be a pure anarchistic.  Life itself, by 
nature, is a compromise.  As there are certain rules governing nature, 
there are also certain rules governing mass action.  This is not 
necessarily an axiom, but it is generally held as a truth.  It's proof 
would take an additional paper, but I'll suply it if necessary.  For the 
oment, I'll continue as if you've granted me this argument.
  Under the premise that no government is a pure 'color', it then becomes 
necessary for the individual to select the 'shade' in which they feel 
content.  Balanced with this neccesity, is the need for survival.  For if 
the shade is to far from that of the community, the community will respond 
in order to preserve itself.  It is possible to apply these abstract 
theories into a working personal system:

When one comes to a decision, some questions must be asked:

1.  Is it illegal.  This is normally the only question a law
abiding citizen need ask.  The anarchist must delve further however, 
because this is not necessarily an unnavigable obstacle.

2.  What are the odds of being caught.  The second question is the 
likelihood of apprehension if the action is carried out.  This is a 
personal decision in which one must way the gains against the risks.

3.  Does this hurt anyone?  By definition, in anarchistic society everyone 
has a right to personal freedom.  Therefor, it must be established that 
the law being broken is simply a law to unnecessarily impede personal 
freedom.  If, rather, it is a law designed to protect the freedom of 
others, than the law would be acceptable and necessary by anarchistic 
theory.  But, isn't anarchy a lack of all laws  Yes, but if all people 
adhered to the principals of the theory, than they'll never jeopardize the 
freedom of another and since the law will never be used, it doesn't matter 
if it exist.  Call me pessimistic, but I'd prefer the law was there just 
the same.

  While number three seems easy to digest, the other two are the root of 
the compromise.  No, it's not ideal, people shouldn't have to face 
consequences for actions which don't hurt another.  However, compromise is 
necessary.  The alternatives are revolution.  While it might be right to 
let everyone get high if they please, is it worth getting them killed 
over? (Sorry, I'm sure there are better examples of personal freedom, that 
was just of the top of the head)
  I believe we must reconcile our wants and beliefs with the consequences 
of our actions in order to find our most suitable environment.

So are you proposing authoritarian communities which are "anarchist" in 
the sense that they are smaller bodies of power?  I do not see how this 
resolves the problem though.  Are means of production in the hands of the 
community or the individuals who make up that community?  If the education 
is in the hands of the community and not the State, isn't that just 
downsizing the power structure?  Free thought is still crushed.  I find it 
antithetical to base a free society on the whims of "enlightened" citizens 
controlling less-"enlightened" citizens.

I don't know whether society would be better off with or without 
government, as government would hardly let us find out in the first place 
which is better.  Nor do I believe anyone else *knows* that an anarchistic 
society would be better off.  It is all a matter of conjecture and theory.

your recipes are read with some enjoyment.  Please share more of this 
material, though I don't see terrorism (using explosives) as an effective 
means to secure freedom.  It just pisses off an already sadistic,

    As stated in my previous message, I don't believe an *anarchist* 
community can work.  By definition, a community states plural citizens.  
That means cooperation, which means someone has to take power over others. 
You mentioned Plato's Republic; should an anarchist society be run by an 
"enlightened" philosopher-king?  Smacks of a soon-to-be pompous, 
easily-tyrannied monarchy to me.
    How can one gain the knowledge of survival outside the society?  
Thoreau states in Walden that man should be alone, away from society.  But 
how could he have lived in nature without the comforts and education (i.e. 
his writing ability) which root from society.  If one can avoid the 
government, there are skills needed for that which involve training only 
society can provide.  Can man, in this day and age, survive on his own?  
I doubt it.

When I brought up Plato's Republic, I didn't mean to imply that a dispotic 
Enlightened philosopher King should rule. This would be tyrrany. My point 
was that Socrates pondered some of the very same questions that we are 
asking ourselves about society as a whole. You also brought up an 
excellent point with Walden. If I were to interpret the meaning of such  a 
text, I would have to say that in the idealistic view, the individual 
would have to learn in society, to understand his fellow man, and nature, 
and then he would want to seek the solace of nature. It's an excellent 
work. I believe that another quote should be remembered. Thoreau also said 
"Simplify, simplify, simplify....." I believe that the solace of nature 
was to do just this. Likewise, on the anarchistic viewpoint, if we took 
the anachistic society was actually just individuals who had taken nature 
as a solace individually, would the purpose be achieved? Can man survive 
on his own? It depends on what context. If he was learned in society, and 
then chose to disassosiate himself from society, I wouldn't see why not. 
These are worthy questions that we all seem to be asking. I'm interested 
in seeing where they lead.-Justin

I never meant to imply that Walden stated an answer to anarch. Thoreau 
stated that many problems could be solved by simplification. I brought it 
up because we were looking at anarchist society on complex terms;  There 
were many "What ifs?" in our statements. I brought it so that we could 
introduce the idea of "isolation" of the person. When a person is isolated 
away from society, he no longer suffers oppression. The need for his 
liberation is complete. Also, I don't think my point about an anarchist 
society. I'm not speaking specifly about a community of anarchists, but 
rather that there are a number of individuals who share the same ideas or 
beliefs, even though they're free in thought, they might choose to group 
together.....or maybe not. It might not even be chaotic. And the point 
that I was also trying to make about Karl Marx's philosophy was that I had 
never brought it up. Reread a few messages back, and you'll see that  
someone else brought that up. It seemed totally unfeasibler to me. However 
didn't the revenue (not profit) get divided (equally) among the people? 
That was another point I failed to clearly state.-Justin

I didn't really say *who* should decide what is to be taught. It's a very 
difficult question and I don't have the answer. When you say that this 
would just be a devolving of power, is that not a good thing? You have to 
be careful where and to whom that power goes. Little pools and small 
spheres of influence are more desirable (in my view) than vast 
concentrations of power in the State and has less potential for abuse. 
This is the gradual path to social change, which is likely to involve the 
least bloodshed and take a long time. If you want excitement, go for 
bombs.

Conjecture about future Anarchist societies is fairly pointless at the 
moment:no government would let us freely go down such a path.
Is there any *useful* method of achieving social change?

------------------------

I think the problem of freedom through isolation brings up another 
problem.  Although the person would be liberated, he would also be lonely, 
which is a point that Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. brings up in Slapstick (and a 
couple other novels).  Basically, man is a social animal, and therefore is 
constantly lonely.  A life in the woods might be intellectually 
fulfilling, but it might also be boring and depressing.  This might be a 
problem with an anarchist society -- if the world becomes extremely 
compartmentalized, individual interaction will follow.  I can't exactly 
predict how relationships would change, but paranoia, shyness, and 
nervosity come to mind.
Anyway, to connect a bunch of these things together, please finger my

Maedhros, et al.:
    Sorry it took me so long to get back to you  I've missed a fantastic 
discussion, but alas it could not be helped.  I was reading Heidegger.
In any case, I'd like to refer back to a message that I wrote last week,  
#265 for those who are interested.  I posed the question, who can best 
solve the problems that face this nation?  Need I list them?  
Unemployment, Poverty, a crumbling infrastructure (sewers, roads, public 
buildings, bridges), almos a quarter of all Americans have no health 
insurance, we face a rapidly declining standard of living, we have 
inherited almost $5 trillion of public debt, violent crime has reached 
near-epidemic proportions, we have far more homeless people than we can 
shelter and feed, poor immigrants are storming across our borders at 
ever-increasing rates further testing the limits of our social services, 
and THE LIST GOES ON!
    Now, it seems to me that we face two choices:  we can either ignore 
these problems and say they don't exist, or we can DO something about 
them.  BTW, we chose to ignore most of these in the 1980s, and that's how 
a lot of these problems got so far out-of-hand.  We can't keep burying our 
head in the sand, and pretending that all is well.  It's not, and it's 
getting worse.  So, once we admit that our nation faces real, complicated, 
and enormous problems, then we must ask ourselves who (or what) is best 
capable, best-suited to DEAL with these problems.  Who?
    I do not believe that anarchy (in its ideal or "compromise" state) can
adequately address these concerns.  If anything, anarchy would rob us of 
our only tool that can work to solve these problems, the government.
Although ideal anarchy would offer unprecedented freedom, what's freedom 
compared to a roof over your head, food in your stomach, a family, a job,  
and security from those who would do you harm?  How can freedom replace 
these things?  The government, yes the EVIL federal government in 
Washington is, unfortunately, the best tool that we have at our disposal 
for meeting the challenges that face us.  No the government is not 
perfect, but I want to see someone make a credible argument that another 
institution can better address America's problems.  Any takers?

Happy ruminations!

I read here that all of you are interested in anarchy.  May I back this up 
just a little?  I believe that the very definition of Anarchy is lack of 
any control over individuals.  My interpretation of that would unending
revolution.  The losses to all of us would be catastrophic.  No, people,
anarchy is not what is needed in this country.  What is needed in this 
country is a return to what our country was founded on.

Our country was founded on several principles, the most important of which 
was freedom from governmental interference.  After the Revolutionary War,
our leaders formed a government that was not supposed to interfere in the
private affairs of the states, counties, towns, etc. on down to 
individuals.  Thomas Jefferson's philosophy was that the "government that
governs least, governs best."  Hamilton, on the other hand, proposed a 
strong central government.  Hamilton lost, and in the years leading up to
1861, the Democratic party was at the forefront of individual rights.
Interpretations of the Constitution were very narrow, and were most often
decided  in the favor of state or individual rights.  Then came the 
Struggle for Southern Independence.  The states rights arguments got 
tossed aside as no longer valid.  The Democrats were seen as "the enemy" 
in the eyes of every "freedom-loving" citizen in the United States.

That was the state of politics in this country until 1932.  Along comes
F.D.R. and his "alphabet soup" of programs to get the United States out of 
the Great Depression.  Here is the beginning of Government control of our 
lives.  And the United States needed some of those programs AT THAT TIME.
But do we really need them now?

    In the most friendly of terms, :-} , I want to accuse you of a bit of 
egocentrism in your post #268.  By that I mean that you missed a point 
that I was trying to make, because you refuse to look at the world through 
any set of eyes but your own.  Egocentrism, an obsessive concern for the 
individual, prevents you from looking at the world from the perspective of 
a group.  Let me explain by analysing your post.  You wrote:

>I just don't take the socialistic view you present which seems to imply 
that I have a moral imperative to help others.

    No.  I never implied, nor did I mean to imply that you had any 
obligation to help anyone. I implied that WE as a society have an 
obligation tho help those that WE see around us who are suffering because 
or while WE enjoy the fruits of our society.  There is a big difference 
between YOU and the Federal Government (the agent of WE the People).
YOU have an obligation to pay your taxes, and to elect the people who YOU 
want to represent you.  Beyond that, you have no obligation.  The 
obligation of the Federal Government is another matter. 
    I would argue that WE, as a society, DO have a moral imperative to 
help those that our society CAUSES or ALLOWS to be poor, homeless, 
destitute, whatever.  YOU, no doubt, disagree with this assertion.  In 
your post you said:

>I've been eligible for both Medicare and Unemployment in the past and 
I've flat out refused it.

    The implication of this statement is that everyone else should shut 
up, grin and bear it, tough it out, or "get a job" and solve their own 
problems.  While I admire your conviction, I must again accuse you of 
a kind of egocentrism.  You seem to argue that the solution to poverty, to 
unemployment, to the health insurance crisis, and everything else in the 
world, is that everyone should be just like YOU!  They should all do what 
you did, tough it out, grin and bear it, get a job, etc.  I just can't buy 
that Maedhros is the model citizen that everyone should be taught to 
emulate.  It seems quite arrogant (to me) for you to suggest that everyone 
else in America should live up to your standards.  That's just not 
reasonable, nor is it advisable.  We need a more realistic answer for the 
people who suffer from these VERY REAL problems.

    The anarchy that you describe in your post #275 doesn't sound much

civil disobedience (particularly against a law that one finds morally

disobedience that you describe, other than a little freedom that we must 
purchase with jail time for needlessly breaking laws.
    Furthermore, how can Paladin books teach you how to practice anarchy?
Isn't it obvious that Paladin books is a part of the current system 
(capitalism), and that the system is making money off your desire for 
freedom, and your sense of powerlessness?  Capitalism has capitalized on
its enemies, and convinced them to buy products in the name of the demise 
of capitalism itself.  Paladin books can teach you how to BUY weapons.
Paladin books can teach you how to BUY survival gear.  They can teach you 
how to BUY chemicals, and equipment to make explosives.  They can teach 
you how to BUY tools that you can use to practice your trade.  They can 
even teach you to BUY more of their books, but they can't (and have no 
desire) to teach you how to be an anarchist.  Anarchy, as I understand it, 
means the obliteration of the capitalist system altogether, and Paladin 
books (which is profiting mightily off the current system) will never

I disagree with your position.  In order to take our minds and bodies

country back from the left-wing liberal establishment in Washington.
Look at what they have done for this country.  They have amassed a debt 
that is rapidly going to swallow this country in a mass of red ink.  We 
can no longer afford to subsidize the programs that have kept the boot of 
the so-called "poor" on our throats for so long (since 1933).
There has to be a better way to use the resources of our country.

The liberal establishment have taken control of our schools and shoved 
their version of history down our throats.  The way they tell it, the 
liberals were the savior of the human race.  May I add that the A-Bomb was 
developed while a liberal was the President ? (FDR)

    Excuse me, but what left -wing liberal establishment in Washington are 
you talking about?  In case you're not aware of this, the U.S. has the 
most conservative government of any nation in the Industrialized World.  
That includes Japan, Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, you 
know, the economic powerhouses.  Yes, of all these governments, ours is 
the MOST conservative.  Those of us who are REALLY on the left are quite 
unhappy with what's been happening in Washington, so I don't know what 
you're so upset about.
    Let's take a look at the last few decades.  Since 1968 Republicans 
(conservatives) have controlled the White House for 21 years and the 
Democrats (liberals, supposedly, but not really) have controlled the White 
House for four years.  If you want to blame someone for the state that 
we're in blame the conservatives.  After all, it was Reagan who cut taxes 
and increased government spending in the 1980s.  He gave us the national 
debt.  It is true that a Democratic House AND a Republican Senate passed  
Reagan's 1981 tax code and budget, however, we must not lose sight of the 
fact that Reagan was elected by a HUGE landslide.  Congress was afraid of 
Reagan, and for the first couple of years they gave him anything that he 
wanted.  As a direct result of changes initiated by Reagan in the early 
1980s we got the ballooning federal debt (@$4.5 trillion now), we got the 
S&L Scandal (we're still bailing out failing banks), the rich got a tax 
break and got richer, the poor got poorer, and we got an expensive drug 
war that failed miserably.  You can blame this on some left-wing 
establishment if you like, but the fact is that all of this came about as 
a direct result of the policies of Ronald Reagan.  True, we experienced 
years of economic growth, but we'll be paying off Reagan's debt for 
decades.  I don't know about you, but I didn't get my $4.5 trillion worth 
in the 1980s.  I don't think that it was worth it.
    You mention FDR in your post, and villify him as the demon who 
initiated all these new social programs in the 1930s.  You imply that we 
don't need those programs now.  What programs, specifically, don't we 
need?  It's very popular these days to run around screaming (very much 
like Chicken Little) "cut spending! cut spending!"  The fact is, there's 
nothing substantial left to cut.  We spend @$1.4 trillion/year.  We 
collect in taxes @$1.1 trillion/year, leaving us with a defecit of @ $300 
billion/year.  The entire defense budget is @$300 billion/year.  Do you 
want to completely eliminate the defense budget?  We spend over $200 
billion/year merely on the INTEREST on the national debt, and this payment 
keeps going up becaust the debt keeps growing.  We might (if we tried
very hard, and caused a lot of pain) be able to cut another $50 billion 
from the budget, but this would still leave us with a tremendous defecit, 
@$250 billion/year and rising.
    Clearly this is a big problem, and there are no simple solutions, 
although I've seen some childishly simplistic solutions passed of as 
"realistic" on this very list.  Please honor me, and yourself by 
considering more carefully who you blame for your woes.  Frankly, I wish 
there were a left-wing establishment in Washington that you could blame, 
but the fact is that true leftists are few and far between in this most 
conservative of nations.

I am a student of history, sir.  I submit to you that it was not the 
conservatives who got us into this mess.  Look a the House of 
Representatives.  It has been dominated by liberals for decades.  The
Democratic party has forgotten their roots.  If the Democrats had left 
well enough alone, their would not have been the problems that we see in 
this country today (i.e. a balooning debt and the beginnings of a welfare 
state).  The liberal establishment in Washington is alive and well and 
continuing to push their agenda of throwing money at problems until the 
problem goes away.  

The tax cut was needed in order to stimulate an economy that had stagnated 
under Jimmy Carter.  However, the Democrats would not cut any of their pet 
projects in order to bring our economy into line.  Therein lies the 
problem.  With no comparable cuts in spending, the debt got larger and 
larger until it is now in the gigantic range.  

Yes, FDR was responsible for many social programs that haunt us today.
I do not, however, cast him as a demon.   He was exactly what this country 
needed at that point in our history.  I merely charge the Democrats with 
not having the courage to cut programs when they become money-eating 
machines which serve no legitimate purpose any more.  As the Democrats 
once believed, the care of the citizenry belongs to the states and not to 
the Federal Government.

Thank You for your views.  This type of debate is enjoyable.

Cochise, sir:
    Perhaps I have not made myself clear.  Please consider this a 
challenge:  name some programs that you want to cut, that when eliminated 
will save the government $300 billion dollars a year!  Please.  If the 
answer to this problem was as simple as that, someone would have done it 
long ago.  There are no simple solutions, and cutting spending is only
a simple "buzzword-phrase" that conservatives feed to the American people 
because that's what we want to hear.  I'd rather our politicians stop 
lying to us (sayng that we can cut spending to get out of this mess).  
It's time for the truth.

be.  There never will ba any time when all men are free and all have total

the opposite way.
    ARTISTIC civil disobedience is the answer.  Break laws, KNOW that you 
ar a criminal and act like it.  Not violenca against people, but violence 
against institutions.  Throw a brick thru a bank window, vandalize City

I agree in part with Jefferson.  His quote should be split into two areas, 
though.  First, the government should govern least with respect to 
individuals in society.  That is, they shouldn't interfere with what you 
think, say, read, eat, fuck, stick in your arm, etc.
The other side of Jefferson's quote is that he said it way before the 
industrial revolution, so that he could not foresee the era of big 
businesses.  Heavy government involvement is necessary in order to protect 
citizens from corporate terrorism (lread The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair).  
Also included in big business territory should be citizens who have 
accumulated vast amounts of wealth.  I.e. the rich should not complain 
about being heavily taxed.

Actually, the current gov't seems more like it is allowing us our rights 
than the previous ones did.  With a Democrat running things (sorta), we 
don't have wonderful people like Jesse Helms influencing the leadership 
quite as much.  Of course, we do have neat innovations like the Clipper 
chip.  I'm sure Clinton means well by endorsing the Clipper, but it won't 
help much.  Oh, one other problem with a liberal gov't is that 
ultra-radicals like Catherine MacKinnon have more influence than under

What's all this about game-playing?  The people you describe come out of a 
bad novel.  In one of my writing classes last semester, we workshopped one 
story about a kid discovering he was gay.  Unfortunately, every single 
scene in the story described his amazing revelations!  Homosexuality was 
constantly on his mind.

People have lives.  They do other things than fight and fight against the 
government.  That's what laelth meant when he talked about having a roof 
over your head.  What good is all your freedom going to do you when
 you't have the basic ingredients of survival/occupation?  The government 
does supply a good bit of food and shelter to those who need it.  Look at: 
homeless shelters, soup kitchens, FEMA aid to victims of earthquakes, 
floods, winter storms, etc.  The government does a LOT of good, and 
without the structure it provides, anyone even slightly "weak" would die 
quickly, free though they may be.

Once this government is gone, this government that keeps psychotic 
criminals in prisons and mental hospitals, this government that provides 
food, shelter, and economic assistance (though not nearly enough), once it 
is gone, how long do you think most people will last?

Neighbors won't help.  People are greedy, and they need a strong parent 
(a gov't) to make them share.  I think every child should be forced to 
watch Sesame Street and only Sesame Street while growing up.  When they 
turn five, they should be allowed to watch the Star Wars Trilogy.  
Eventually we'll have a nation of Jedis and we can dismantle the

I said the Clinton gov't is allowing more rights than did the previous 
governments.  I also do believe in gun control.  We have the right to bear 
arms, but we also have the right to be safe from those people who don't 
know what they're doing when they buy them.  If you can't handle a 5 day 
waiting period, go buy your gun now and you won't have to wait when you 
finally need one.
Socialized medicine infringing on rights?  What, the right of people 
without private health insurance to have access to health care is 
unimportant?
Also, I didn't mean to imply that Clinton and the Clipper chip are ok, 
simply because Clinton means well.  Clinton thinks (for some unknown 
reason) that lots of people are out everyday, illegally tapping phone 
lines, listening to the suburban gossip of bored housewives, plotting 
blackmail schemes.  Encryption is meant to keep your thoughts away from 
the gov't, but with the Clipper chip, they'll be able to listen right in.  
What a stupid plan.  They must think that everyone who wants to be safe 
from gov't intervention must have something to hide. Yuck.

Anyway, besides the minor infringement about gun control, I don't see how 
they are restricting our rights any more than usual.  Liberals happen to 
be more lenient when it comes to obscenity, freedom of expression, freedom 
of speech, the press, etc.

The problem is: people WON'T help people.  They may help each other for a 
little while, as in the LA quake scenario, but things quickly become

OK, here's a scenario for what would happen to me if anarchy was suddenly 
bestowed upon the country:

I would try to go home to my parents.  I live 3 hours from school, so I 
might bring some friends with me.  First, I have to get out of Baltimore.  
People are celebrating anarchy, so there's looting, etc.  If I finally get 
out and manage to steal a car and get home, I'm reunited with my family.  
Now, we don't know how to forage for food, how to hunt, how to keep warm 
(no power, remember?).  Plu, some of my enemies from long ago find out I'm 
in town.  These people are generally violent, so they hook up with some 
guns, come over, and either beat the shit out of me and my family, or kill 
me, or whatever.  If we had some organized gov't, I could call the police, 
if we had some organized phone system, but we don't, since there's no use 
operating a phone company when no one wants to pay.  My neighbors can't 
help us, since we're about in the same situation.  What the fuck do we, 
and the millions of other helpless people do?  Even if we can get help 
from friends, that help will disappear after a while, as the "new life" 
becomes the norm.  Things will seem as they always have, with people 
generally greedy and uncooperative.  Life, as they say, will suck.

socialized medicine, does not give people acces to health care as much as 
you think it does.  OK here are some points on it
 
1.  It will create a HUGE fraggin buerocracy, a board will be made to 
decide the medical decisions that go on inside that area of jusrisdiction. 
 they are the FINAL word on medical decisions.  They are NOT elected 
officials.

2.  The socialized health care DOES NOT garauntee health care to the poor. 
 They must follow strict laws and guidelines in order to recieve care.
 
3.  The entire controlling buerocracy are NOT elected officials.
 
4.  The rights of citizens to see whom they choose are restricted(doctors)
 
5.  The proffesional practice of doctors will be basically under the 
control of the govt.  Ask some canadian doctors about this point.  

6.  Youll be issued a medical card, ANOTHER, yes ANOTHER peice of

1.  tThe CLEO clause gives the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the county

I do not agree that books should be destroyed.  The only way to fight 
thinking and thought is with thought and thinking.  Burning of books is 
NOT the way to do that.  Certain works can serve a useful purpose, that of 
a bad example.  Use our past to create a better future.  We know what 
doesn't work, so let's try something that does.  Even Anarchy didn't work 
in the past.  

Anarchy, I believe, is defined as constant revolution.  With that state of 
violence a constant, violence against all would follow.  We are not living 
in the "enlightened" age of Locke, but in the early stages of Hobbes.

Subject: Anarchy *might* be bullshit
Date: Wed Feb  2 01:34:25 1994


    Please allow me to read you all a quote on what got me
 started about what freedom is and whether control over another can be 
eliminated.  I'll start first off by saying that I am not so sure that 
even without a government smacking our hands (or shooting us in the 
streets) we will be free of oppression from others.  
    The key word to the subject of control is *guidance*.  How do we, the 
social beasts that we are, deal with one another without guiding a 
behavior pattern?  "The teacher who merely selects the material the 
student is to study or the therapist who merely suggests a different job 
or change of scene has exerted control, though it may be hard to detect." 
(Skinner, _Beyond Freedom and Dignity_)
    It has also been mentioned before that anarchy is eliminating 
capitalism in this country.  I venture that anarchy would eliminate more 
than that, but more to the point, what replaces it?  Do we steal from 
another?  An argument stating that we have unlimited resources and can 
feed, clothe, and shelter one another without any problems would be hard 
to swallow.  But say "anarchy" results and we are left with a libertarian 
wet dream, so to speak, where government dissociates itself
 from free-market behavior?  "A free economy does not mean the absence of 
economic control, because no economy is free as long as goods 





  


and money remain reinforcing.  When we refuse to impose control over 
wages, prices, and the use of natural resources in order not to interfere 
with individual initiative, we leave the individual under the control of 
unplanned economic contingencies." (Ibid.)
    So even without government, how do we keep from controlling, that is, 
manipulating each other for the fulfillment of some goal(selfishness, 
etc.)?  Anarchy is more than giving the Man odd finger gestures, what is 
to be done after to insure the individual calls his own shots?

    I'd like to read a quote which started me thinking about free will and 
whether a lack of government will be *true* freedom.  First off I'll
say that even without a government to smack our hands (or shoot us in the 
streets) I doubt that man will be free from control (manipulation).  
    The key word to the discussion of control is *guidance*.  When the 
government lowers taxes to promote private growth, it *guides* the 
businesses into development in this country.  At first glance, this would 
seem like less control, but in essence the mode of control has shifted 
from aversive, unfriendly control to favorable, friendly control.  The 
shifting of control is manipulation, it is guidance.  The same example can 
be read into many other actions the government takes to "promote" what it 
would have you call freedom.
    I'll bring myself back to my original example, which was education.  
This, of all examples, is probably to the best because with or without 
government, regardless of the economic and social policies that we choose, 
we will eveentually have to educate our kids.  "The teacher who merely 
selects the material the student is to study...has exerted control, though 
it may be hard to detect." (Skinner, _Beyond Freedom and Dignity_)
    Even without aversive government politics guiding us from cradle to 
grave, what about the economic policies we will have to face?  I shall use 
the "libertarian wet dream scenario," where to govt. has dissociated 
itself from influencing free market economics.  A free economy does not 
mean the absence of economic control, because no economy is free as long 
as goods and money are reinforcing [manipulative].  When we refuse to 
impose control over wages, prices, and the use of natural resources in 
order not to interfere with individual initiative, we leave the individual 
under the control of unplanned economic contingencies." (Ibid.)
    As far as social practices go, how about gun control?  If the 
government fails to manipulate me as far as the purchase of a handgun 
goes, won't the armed criminal in the alleyway manipulate me?
    My point is that, being social beasties, we tend to hovel together in 
20th century versions of tribes.  Our interactions with one another
are programmed into us; how can we escape manipulation?  Should we make 
manipulative effects as small as possible?  Or as large as possible with 
positive reinforcers (manipulators)?  
}

    Can we escape control?

    Well, actually WWII made the US into the industrial giant it was in 
the 50s and 60s, in the process bringing the country out of the Great

    Funny thing about politicians...whenever something good happens while 
they are in power, they attribute to their great politicking skills, 
regardless of whether it was attributable to them in the first place.  
Reagan claimed he brought America out of a recession and also lowered the

WERLL this isnt what the subject/title line says so pay attention please.



    Someone asked what we can do to escape the manipulation and control, 
even without a govt.  Also someone asked me if that in this state of 
anarchy what I would think of someone stealing my schtuff,  Thiscan answer 
OTH of those questions.

    Is anarchy purely a political thing?  FUCK NO.  It's spiritual and 
MENTAL,  I have said this many times but noone seems to have guts to 
respond to the spiritual part.  Nor do they seem to want to delve into the 
mental liberation aspects.  what the hell?
    You are programmed from birth to believe what they tell you, to 
believe that you need a controlling force in your life, to believe that 
this is bad and that is good, you are tought to hate your bodies, and your 
REAL respect for life is washed away under the tides of church and state.  
you have to brea out of this and realize that there is no need for a 
conrolling body to order us.
    As for people breaking into my house after we instate this anarchy I 
speak of.  They wont.  WHY?  because the desire for property and for greed 
is all thrown off when you liberate your mind.
    Anarchist as youknow them focus on the political and sometimes the 
mental, BUT you need to focus on all three aspects of the human, spiritual 
mental and political.  As a a matter of fact the political part isnt 
neccesary once you are able to free your mind and spirit from their 
programming and illusion of need of control.  You can creat Temporary 
Atomonous Zones, places the govt wont notice were you can do as you and 
your fellows like.  THen you come to the politics of trying to free the 
others, but only after you free yourselves can you hep others.  you can't 
pull your friends out of the tar pit while you still are in it.
    As for how can we get over the manipulation of groups.    YOu can't 
get over it until you realie that they have no power of you.  THe illusion 
of need of control is so strong in most people they dont even try andf 
fight for their individualism.

    Is anarchy a mental state?  Certainly.  You can call an anarchistic 
group a Temporary Autonomous Zone, and give a song and dance about the 
poetic nature of it, but it is anarchy nonetheless.
    Is anarchy a spiritual state?  What the hell is spirit?  If you are as 
adamant about the control of "church and state" as you say you are, why 
would you replace one form of "spirituality" with another?  The control 
which was in the hands of the Church is now simply in the hands of whoever 
defines spirituality, i.e. the author or representative of TAZ.
    Also in your statement, you claim that humans are programmed for 
obedience, while in the same paragraph, denying any effect that we *are* 
programmed: "you have to brea {sic} out of this and realize that there is 
no need for a controlling body to order us."  This is a major jump from 
"You are programmed from birth to believe that you need a controlling 
force..."  
    "As for how can we get over the manipulation of groups.  blah...etc."
You misunderstand my point completely.  I was talking about the lack of 
choice we have, not only when a govt. says "that's bad," but also when we 
want to travel to the other side of the globe and have no transportation, 
i.e physical controllers.  Individuals can act as power bases, 
manipulating each other for positive/negative (as far as you choose to 
define +/-) as well as multi-billion dollar bureacracies.  All this 
manipulation is programming which psychologically we cannot escape from, 
save death.  Please read Pavlov and Skinner before you answer this point, 
because an entire science of behaviorism has been created around the fact 
that there is no such thing as free will; that we are programmable beings 
(which is why we have evolved to this point) and that outr environmnet 
directly and indirectly controls an individuals behavior.  To make the 
point even clearer, you have been programmed by a government, which you 
don't like, to write your message, and to read TAZ.  Such a government is 
hardly likely to live long, but the point is it has manipulated you
to hate it.

     You say that since I define anarchy as pertaining also to the 
sopiritual I am putting the power into the hands of who the one
 that defines the spirit.  Not so.  You are the soveraign of your own 
bodyu.  If that is the definition of spirit, then how am I controlling you 
thru it?  I am not, I am just defining it as I see it.  My definition of 
spirit does not controll or define YOU until you accept it or are 
inundated by it's presence.  WHICH by the nature of my definition is 
impossible.  It doesnt impose itself on you and inundate you.  Now the 
church representation of spirit is based on a hierarchy, a higer god above 
humans, THATS why there is control over your spirit in it.  My personal 
belief is that you are soveraign over your own spirit, "As GODS are we".  
You have noone to answer to but yourself.  How does that put control over 
you?  It doesnt it destroys all contyrol, since you dont even have to 
aswer to anyone except yourself, not a god, not another person.  THe 
church definition of spirit is rooted in a hiearchy, were you have to 
answer to your sins, that's is control,. Control thru guilt and 
fear-mongering.
    As for the statement that a whole science of behaviorism has been made 
on the basis that we have no free will, you say that Skinner and Pavlov 
did their work on the basis that we have no free wil.  Thjey never said we 
didnt have free will, they simply showed that man can be programmed to 
believe certain things.  This doesnt destroy free will, it simply shows 
that it can be suppressed by the proper input to the senses.
    And your paragraph about by my stating "You have to break out of this 
and realize theat there is no need for a controlling body to order" bieng 
a huge jump from "you are programmed from birth to believe you need a 
controlling force", what are you saying?  It's the same statement, except 
it one, I am saying BREAK out of this programming, you can do it.  
Programming can be broken out of you know.  And in the other one I simply 
state that this programming exists.  There is no huge leap there, just a 
statement that this programming needs to be broken.
    As for the physicallimiters, they are a given, but they are also 
natural so there is no way to destroy them, it's called acceptance of 
natural limitations, Chuang Tzu calls it "Bieng Wise". I in no way implied 
that you need to stop the natural limiters, simply the unatrual limiters. 
Such as passports, customs etc....
    Yes, people can manipulate others for +/- means, BUT when you are fee 
of the deires of greed and good/evil, which are all inventions of the 
powerbase to keep you in line, and to make you fear your body and your 
human intuition. you no longer desire to manipulate people.  you REALIZE 
the spirit as I tried to point out before.  That you are soveraign of your 
own body, and that each persons sovereignty is sacred.
     As for the incorrect statement of amnipulation by the govt to make me 
state these thing, and to read TAZ and all, you just killed your own 
argument.  Think about it..........................

People's minds will be automatically "liberated" once the revolution

shit about being liberated from the oppression of the government.  You 
have 250 million preprogrammed, greedy asshole citizens who don't care 
about spirituality.  That spirituality won't just suddenly come to them in 
a moment of enlightenment.  I know tons of people who live just to fuck,

Americans.  Television is important.  Beer is important.  Sex is

uys to see, and facts can't really be argued. But from these facts I've 
decided that something very big is going to happen very soon in America. 
    Ask yourself this question: how are we going to fix the national debt? 
Of course, there are a lot of answers out there, but none take into 
account the inability o f the government to make decisions--especially big 
ones. We're quickly spiraling otwards bankruptcy as a nation, but then 
again, we are still the most expensive nation in the world, militarily. 
    people fight with there wallets n hand, and there are plenty of fights 
in the world for the nation to get into. Fighting--if you win--is very 
profitable; look at ancient rome. And we know that America will fight for 
its wallets--look at trhe Persian gulf incident of just a few years ago. 
    Point is, what do you think that trillions of dollars are worth
 to America--we killed over onehundred thousand people in Irag and Kuwait 
for money, though we pretended it was a battle against tyranny and 
aggression--though we haven't helped Bosnia, which is a victim of 
aggression of horrible proportions. So when the bills get over our  heads. 
forget the previous sentence. So when we get in over our heads with the 
bills, do you think that our civil rights and the rights of other antions 
will not suffer? Watch out.

My dear friend abort:
    I think what you read means a great deal.  In fact, I think that
a lot of what's wrong with our society can be traced to the prime-time-tv 
garbage in which most Americans wallow every day.  Not surprizingly, I've 
read everything on JasonLee's list, and nothing on yours. 
    I do, on the other hand, know a little about Chinese mysticism, Taoism
in particular.  The "path" of the Tao is beautiful, sublime if you will.  
It is an essential part of the Chinese way of life.  However, the Chinese 
recognize that an active spiritual life is not enough.  That is why Kung 
Fu Tse and his teachings (Confucianism) sprang up in connection with the 
Tao.  Along with serene spirituality, Kung Fu Tse argued that people must 
also act ethically in social, political, and economic affairs.  He 
recognized that people are inherently social and political animals, that 
we act together as groups, and that we needed some system, some code, to 
regulate our interactions with one another.
    So, here's what I'm driving at.  It's great that you've read Lao-Tsu.
But that alone is not enough.  The Chinese recognized this over two 
millennia ago.  This, by the way, is the source of the notion of yeng and 
yang, that both, the spiritual, and the socio/political are necessary 
components of human existence.  Lao-Tsu is incomplete without Kung-Fu-Tse.
If you're interested in bringing some balance to your deeply spiritual 
life, you might want to start with _The Analects_ of Confucious.
    Happy reading!

Hmm...
    I'm not sure I know what you mean by "bureaucracy."  You say that 
Herbert Hoover was the last president to cut the bureaucracy, but what 
does that mean?  If you're talking about government employees,  I'd argue 
that Nixon, by pulling us out of Vietnam, most drastically cut the number 
of government employees.  (Of course you know that our military employs 
over 2 million people).  But, I don't think that's what you mean.  
Although the military is by far the BIGGEST bureaucracy around, most 
conservatives want to preserve that bureaucracy.  From my experience, when 
conservatives cry about bureaucracy, they are really crying about social 
programs that they don't like.  BTW President Clinton lowered (by about 
5%) the total number of government employees (both military and 
non-military) last year!  He is actually committed to reducing the size of 
the Federal Government, although leftists like myself wonder if this is 
suuch a good idea.  Frankly, I'd rather see the government employ more 
people, not less.  The last thing that we need in times of high 
unemployment is for the government to cut the number of people that it 
employs.  But I'm off the subject.
    You say we need to cut the bureaucracy (cut spending! cut spending!), 
but you still don't name a single program that you want to cut. Your 
numbers just don't add up.  We simply can't cut $300 billion dollars from 
the federal budget without drastic consequences.  As I've said before, and 
will say again, "Cut Spending! Cut Spending!" is a lie that won't and cant

    I'm always suspicious of those who cry about how bad socialized
medicine is.  Many of them have a vested interest in the status quo.  Many

    Yo are right about Kung Fu Tse bieng hand in hand with Lao Tzu, they 
balance each other in that it was normal for younger people to follow Kung 
Fu Tse teachings, but when they got older and grew out of the idea of 
society, the would turn towarrd Taoism.  Also there was a lot of 
differences between the two.  As a matter of fact it's funny that Chuang 
Tzu uses Kung Fu(Confucous) as both a positice and a negative example in 
his writings.  BUT, he focused on the negative alot more, particularly the 
classifications of roles etc..  But he also showed that Kung Fu was a wise

    The poiojnt I have been trying to make all along, is that you cvant

etc... and expect anything to happen.  Also, you cant expect it to happen 
if all you do is break doent the govt.  There has to be a fundamental

    According to our argument yesterday, saying "ANARCHY D000D" and 
"spouting intellectual writings and quotes etc." would be the semantical 
equivalent to stating "oh, I've read TAZ and Te Tao Ching = spiritual 
anarchy, etc."  How can you make a semantical choice between the two when, 
according to what you said yesterday, they are fundamentally
 the statement?
    ^---equivalent

    You still not have reasonably defined the spirit in relation to power. 
 If you can say that spirit exists, what role does it play in prthe 
programming of Man?  How does liberation of spirit occur?  Does the spirit 
program itself to pretend it is free?  What happens here?

Xela, shouting "ANARCHY D0000D" and "spouting intellectual writings" is 
very different from actually working to meta-program yourself out of the 
programming tha gramming you are currently in.
    What goods  is spouting intellectualism and quotes when your still 
operating under the same parameters you always have been.  You are talking 
the talk, but not walking the walk.  Now you can use the quotes and 
intellectualism to support your course of action IF you have a course of 
ction.  Otherwise you are wasting air.
 
    As far as explaining the spirituality, like I tried to explain before, 
ITS A METAPHOR, a set of symbols to help a person relate to reality.  
Science is just as much based in faith.  Newton did all of his work for 
the "glory of god".  Also in order to DO science you have to except some 
unprovable statements on faith.  For instance, that your senses are not 
decieving yu, that if you do this experiment under the exact same 
conditions that the same outcome will happen.  That "logic" is actually a 
accurate representaion of the behavior of reality, the einstiens theories 
are true, and that the theories that is based on are true...etc....  
Science is based on some faiths.  
 
    The problem you are having is automatically and wrongfully equating 
spiritualism with "worhsipping" which is a false assumption.  Many eastern 
religions do not worship anything or any bieng.  There is no worshipping 
involved at all, the "emlightenment" is gotten from within.  This is were 
you are making a mistake regarding your idea of spiritualism.
 

    As i said before, spiritualism is a set of symbols to relate ourselves 
to reality, same as science, it's just that science is more accepted in 
the western world.  Both are valid depending upon the views of the person 
the symbols are doing the translating for. 
 
    So now to explain what I mean by freeing yourself spiritually, then 
Ill compare it too freeing yourself in terms of science, and the idea of 
programming and bad circuits as you speak in.
 
that willbe my next post.

    OK I will start to explain this meta-programming in the terms of 
science which many of you relate to better, than I will explain it in 
terms of spiritualism.
 
    OK, the brain as most scientist, and the people I have talked to here 
believe, is programmed. For instance Xela says that is it programmed and 
that we really have no free will.  Then he also brought in the idea of Bad 
Cirucuits.  THese circuits are what are the crux of this meta-programming. 
 To simplify it let me bring in Timothy Leary's work on Brain Circuits.  
He devised that there were really Eight circuits to the brain, from the 
1st circuit, which is very animalistic, to the eitght circuit which was 
very high level thought, higher than we accomplish right now, particularly 
those dealing with dimensions higher that four etc...  abstract stuff 
basically.  Now, he also described various techniques and drugs which have 
effects on these circuits.  For instance the fourth circuit, would 
commonly be called lust, or love circuit.  This can of course be 
stimulated by an influx of hormones, particulalry in teenagers.  Another 
would be the sixth and seventh circuits, dealing with the perception of 
reality and proccessing of information we take in from our senses.  Drugs 
that efect this are DMT, LSD, other psychedelics, AND certain types of 
yoga.  Yes yoge, particularly those dealings with heavy breath body and 
mind meditation.  
    OK, now what happens in meta-programming is that you actively trying 
to effect these circuits of your brain.  One example is the taking of LSD 
to expand the mind.  This will have effects on the sixth and seventh 
circuits.  Effecting our perception of reality and our dealing with 
sensual input.  The idea of reeing yourself as I continually refer to, is 
that you are meta-programming yourself, to no longer relyt on the control 
mechanisms that we are brought under in society. You are meta-programming 
your circuits into new and original formations.  You are stimulating 
experiences wich will effect you in a maner that will incite feelings 
which are chemical reactions as Xela puts it, that will free ouy.  That 
will make you no longer desirous of relying upon a controlling device such 
as the state, or church.

    Thats a short explanation and I expect to get questions about it since 
I dont really know how far you want me to go with the explanation.

    NOW to realte it by using spiritual symbols and references.  OK, you 
want to free yor soul, you want to realize the freedom that can be yours.  
But you've been programmed and made to believe that you need a control 
device in your life, that you need to have someone guiding you.  This can 
be the idea of a soveraign bieng such as god, or in the idea of state.  
You are fooled into believeing that you need a guide thru life.  Also you 
are tricked into seeing good and bad as definite.  When they are not, good 
and bad are subjective relations given to various actions and experiences. 
 The idea of good and bad stems from the need for a guide.  Igf it goes 
against this guide you are taught that it is bad etc...
     Now what are you ganna do to free yourself rom this conmtrol.  For 
instance Taoism suggests that you forget the categorizations that man puts 
on the tao, on the way.  Zen Buddhism suggests that you clear your mind of 
desires and wants.  These are just examples.  The thing is Xtianity is not 
very good for this freedom because it and judaism and hinduism and more 
conventional buddism, are based on a supreme bieng who you worship and ask 
favors of.  Taoism and Zen buddhidm, the power is drawn from within, and 
you are not dependent on outside forces,  Therefor you are truly free of 
control.  There is no supremne god to answer to in these 
religion/philosophies.  That is why they are truly free.


    The point of this is that spirituality and science are both equally 
capable of freeing yourself from control devices.  I prefer touse a 
combination of both since it speaks to me better that way.  Science and 
spirituality are both sets of symbols, both must be taken on faith.  
Science is much easierly taken on faith since it is more recently 
developed compared to rather ancient ideas of spirituality.

  I think, perhaps, we are missing part of the problem when we talk of 
freeing ourselves from outside influences.  While, yes, we have been 
programmed to a large extent to feel the need for authority by society 
itself; there are other factors at play here.  
  Mankind is a pack animal on an instinctual level.  While most people 
don't appreciate being compared to a pack of dogs, we are similar in many 
respects.
  First, we operate as a pack, and do not survive alone well.  Yes, a 
person can isolate himself from others to a large extent; but he cannot 
totally remove himself from society (at least as a general rule).  This 
kind of action brings about mental instability often referred to as cabin 
fever.  
  Second, and more to the point, a pack of animals forms under an 
established leader or leadership.  Why?  It's instinctual and it helps the 
community thrive.  Similarly, humans tend to form leaders to give the pack 
cohesion and to promote productivity.  This isn't necessarily a form of 
oppresion, but more along the lines of specialization.  
  Just as some people are better at repairing engines, some are better at 
concerting the efforts of a group.  Oppression comes when the leader is 
incompetent or does not wish to make the packs goals his own.  There is a 
remedy for such a situation; often times this takes the form of 
revolution.  The leader is foprcefully thrown from his position.  Thisa is 
NOT always necessary however.  
  In the US we have the invaluable right of voting.  If the majority of 
the people want more freedom than they need to elect someone who will give 
them more.  Hell, knock yourself out and vote libertarian.
  I'm straying way of course though.  The point is that the security and 
desire for authority and government isn't a purely human convention.  It 
is an evolutionary tool with which we have been designed to work with.  It 
is what has made modern society possible.  (Along of course, with the 
opposible thumb, which I would never want to sell short)

The method you describe is interesting, but also useless for a lot of 
people.  I really haven't seen any compelling reason for me to try 
"meta-programming to free myself from control."  Why should I want this?  
How will it help me accomplish what I want in my life?  Just to give you a 
hint of what I'd like to do, I'll tell you a couple plans I have. 
 I'd to become a writer, maybe even a great writer.  I currently write 
stories that come from the unpleasant things that arrive in my head.  I 
would also like to make movies out of some of these ideas.  If I, and 
everyone else, were to follow your spirituality idea, freeing ourselves, 
then turning America into an Anarchic State, how would my plans turn out?

BTW, I'm still not quite sure how I'm controlled, since I try not to let 
the world outside of my head bother me.  I'm saying thought controlled, 
not survival-controlled.  I mean, I do understand the control inherent in 
living in a society such as ours, but I don't see an immediate need to 
escape from that control.

OK, one might say: we need anarchy because government doesn't help too 
much and people in power try to control your mind/pocketbook/whatever.  
So, if anarchy is the answer, and to achieve anarchy, we all have to 
gothrough this meta-programming business, which people on the whole won't

current government and also people's minds a simpler and more fulfilling

    So by affecting the levels of chemicals inside your brain, utilizing 
acid or yoga (i.e. controlling oxygen levels reaching the brain, placebo

does not mean that you *are* free.  I can sum it up this way.  I can feel 
free, by reading books about freedom, or applying eastern religious 
crutches to my mind, and it may feel like the real thing, but it isn't.
Freedom is not an atainable goal, regardless of which buttons you push (or 
meta-circuits, whichever metaphor you prefer).
    Programming is still control.

    I have never stated that people need control, nor have I stated that 
people need to guide me.  What I have said is that people guide me 
regardless of whether I "let" them or not.  Programming can be very 
subtle.  My argument all along has been that even without the programming 
of a sovereign, man, a social being, programs others in his interactions 
with others.
    I can smoke dope or pop tabs of acid all day long (which I recommend 
:) ) and alter brain chemistry, but I still have to deal with others.  Or 
does your argument state that only a hermit is free?
    Good and bad are subjective terms which a society deals with on its 
own terms.  Society can exist with or without government by a power 
untiit, but it still creates morals and in that sense it programs the 
citizen.


I'll conclude my argument with the next statement.

    Man created science gradually, by building a foundation of truths 
whiich we take for granted today but had to be sought out vigorously in 
the days of science's youth.  Man created science so he could grow more

a bible at a cancer patient and expect to heal him.  You *can* however, 
use biochemistry and immunology to elucidate the structure of the virus 
which is responsible for the cancer, use computer science to develop a 
computerized model of an enzyme which will catalyse the virus, and
 ususe organic cheistry to synthesize a drug which will eliminate the 
virus responsible.  You cannot chant hymns whle throwing dice to see which 
chemical you will use to remove heavy metals from a patients bloodstream.  
You cannot meditate while people are starving because a new

I have a basic problem with the use of spirituality to define anything.  
In most people's cases, when I here them talk about becoming "more 
spiritual" they really don't know what they're talking about.  One nice 
example is my little brother, who kept babbling about understanding his 
spirituality.  He told me that one day, he went out into a field and "felt 
the earth rotate" as if this was some all-important  moment of discovery.

People who talk spirituality are people who have suddenly discovered that 
they have the ability to think about themselves and their place in world.  
Since this is something I'm used to, since I'm constantly thinking way too 
much, I'm never impressed by someone's talk of spirituality.


UNLESS the talk has to do with religion (mostly western) and a person's 
relation to God.  I deeply respect people who have faith and can back up 
their beliefs without sounding like mindless sheep.

hmm lag is bad tonite
 
 

    Over at ISCA, there was just about 500 posts debating spiritualism 
versus science, or religion vs science.  Thre came a midpoint when people 
saw that both had merits.  Spiritualism can do somethings that science 
cannot.  And science can do something that spiritualism cannot.  Funny 
thing is everyone agreed tht they both have uses, or actualy everyone knew 
that sdcience had alot of uses, that's a given, but even then they 
admitted that spiritualism, had uses also.
 
    Certain people can talk about certain things better than they can talk 
about other things.  For instance to explain the "why" of a particualarly 
strange experience, such as the one JasonLee gave about his brother, a 
concept of spirit can explain it, as well as science can say that it's a 
neurochemical reaction. DIfferent strokes for different folks.
 
    Spiritualism doesnt mean a "religion" is t means acknowledgment that 
there are things out there we can't touch or flesh out thru other things.
 
but this debate over the merits of it in relation to anarchy is dead since 
ther is no waty 1. that we can agree ona definition fo spiritualism and 2. 
there is no way for either of us to commun9icate to each other.  We differ

 I think that it touches on the mind, and the persons programming as well. 
 If you are made to believe that you need a control system then you 
willnever attempt to live without one.  The thing I believe is that you 
can make your that you can make yourself realize that you dont need the 
control system to live peacefully with others.  You can also make yourself 
realize that you can control your own destiny.
 
    I think this is were our fundamental differences arise.  You see that 
we dont have free will, but I see that we do.  you see the programming as 
abolute, I see it as escapable.  By escapable I mean that you can change 
the programming or the circuits that is imprinted into you consciously.  
If you can change it then to me that is free will.

    You've got a lovely definition of anarchy, there.  Wipe away the 
government, wipe away all vestiges of oppression, free the mind, free the 
body, everyone living together in peace and harmony ...
    Hogwash!  If history teaches us anything it is that Utopian Visions 
like the one you've got are VERY dangerous; they cause more pain and 
oppression than the system that they replace.  Remember, Communism 
(Marxism/Leninism) is a Utopian political philosophy.  Look what it caused 
... 50,000 died in the revolution, Stalin killed off all his enemies, 
conquered half of Europe, took away more freedom than he ever gave, caused 
the cold war, etc.  Milan Kundera, a Czec novelist, writes about his 
country's conversion to Communism.  He makes it very clear that the 
Communists were true believers, good people deep down, who wanted the best 
for their country.  But they created a monster, one that they deeply 
regretted for the rest of their lives.  Kundera is far too clear ... 
Utopia KILLS, be wary of it.  BTW  Hitler's Third Reich was a utopian 
vision of an Arian Germany.  The cost of his utopia was the massacre of 
millions of Jews.  Utopia must be purchased at a very high cost, and even 
then, once purchased it never lives up to its promises of freedom and 
happiness for all.
    Your vision of anarchy sounds hauntingly similar to me.  How many
people will have to die to realize your dream?  ... 50,000?  ... a

If you can change it then to me that is free will.


    You mentioned the consuming of chemicals to alter reality.  In effect, 
you call this "reprogrramming of reality."  I propose that altering your 
programming in no way affects reality, but more it affects your 
*perception* of reality.  Claiming that escape is possible by altering 
brain chemicals is like me saying "If i grub shrooms i can fly."  If I 
would try to fly off a building I would die; this is reality outside of my 
perception of it.  Programming *is* inescapable, the only other option 
being suicide.
    Meditation, drugs, etc. change *you*.  They do not change reality.

I am a new user here.  I was reading your posts and wanted to make some 
comments.  First, typing with a lag is for the birds.  Second...  Well as 
for the "can we change/make a difference in the world?"  Well I think so.  
Not a monumental change mind you.  Someone can make a monumental change, 
but I would venture to say that neither you or I are the next King or 
Gandi.  [My beliefs]  I think that changes begin at home.  If you want 
things different, change them for yourself.  I know that you and I cannot 
make all of the nuts who kill stop.  No, the problems in this [american] 
society are far too complicated for you and me to do it alone.  But if we 
first start with ourselves.  Be good people, the best we can be.  Be 
contious of life, respect happiness.  I used to worry about all of the 
problems everywhere.  While doing this I failed to recognize that I am a 
pretty fucked up person. I am not very nice, to be honest I am intrinsicly 
selfish.  I think it has something to do w/ my relationship with my 
father.  That is not for now though.  My point is that I would bitch about 
all the problems in the world.  I would shit on people for doing things 
like using napkins.  Yes, using napkins.  I don't use them cuz they are 
disposable.  About the only disposable products that I don't try not to 
use are  things like toilet paper.  BAck to the point.  Being that I would 
 shit on people before I lived up to my expectations.  NOw I am a 
struggling person.  I am doing my best to make my life the ideal.  Sure I 
am a shit sometimes but I am trying.  I know this is unrelated but my 
point is that if you want to see change, then change.  Don
take on the whole worlds problems, just lend a selfless hand.  If everyone 
would have some charity we would be in a much better situation.

I will step off of the soapbox now.  Thanks

As everyone here knows about computer systems, probably....  The weasest 
part of any computer security system is usually the human portion.  This 
is the same with politics.  We live an a Utopian ideal too.  Most contries 
are/were at one point a dream or a vision of great peace and happiness.  I 
like to think this about the free nations anyway.  But systems are great 
until the humans get their hands on them.  Any system is great.  you can 
lay out a hypothetical ideal in any system where everyone is happy, 
wealthy and wise.  The shit arrives when people actually use the system 
and show us that it is very expolitable.  Kind of like writing a program. 
When you write it, it looks good.  You run it, work out the obvious kinks 
and then  when you go to use it you find a shit load of flaws. I konw, I 
know this is not a good programmer :)  But I think I have made my point.  
So let people have their ideals.  We all know nothing works.  But at least 
we can dream.

We have kept ourselves trapped in the animalisti cycle of greed that 
nature needs to survive, but that we should be above. Ours has evolved 
further into a cycle of hate.people believe thaqt matter and energy never

to see the same thing from hate and greed. Thaat man who kills isn't
 evi --he is carrying on the evil that the world hsas passed oin to him. 
So we are all, the real killers--" Let he who is free of sin..." --and all 
the money in the world, all the worlds wealth, is tainted with blood. As 
we all hold a bit of that wealth--some more than others--we all help pull 
the triggers of this world.Yesterday, 66 Bosnian civilians died--they were 
TORN APART---in a mortar attack. It made me sick--even more sickening,

more). These things are killing us.

It may not be cash but it's still MONEY!!
Most of the money in this world exists as numbers in computers, and flows 
around the world money system under no controls. There is financial 
anarchy out there, with no government having control over thousands of 
billions of dollars. The markets destroyed the European Exchange Rate 
Mechanism, putting back the cause of European unity considerably.
It's also unfettered capitalism, the money going where instant profit is 
to be made.
With plastic, the authorities can keep tabs on you - exactly what you 
spend, on what, where and when is recorded, but at least the end of cash 
would mean the end of a certain amount of petty corruption (but not the 
big stuff).

It's not so much money that is the problem, but the controllers of private 
capital. The trust funds, multinational corporations etc all have an 
inordinate amount of power because it is Economic power they control. 
Money votes count the most. To deal with the greed money brings all you 
have to do is sort out who owns the means of production.... an old tale 
repeated often. Anarchist theory (as opposed to Marxist) would hold that 
those who utilise the means of production ie the workers, should enjoy the 
full benefit of their labour, and not have some surplus value extracted 
from them by the owners/capitalists. This would include the State, who in 
the old Socialist Eastern Bloc countries were State Capitalists, basically 
acting as a monopoly.

Get that sorted, and you're well away....

James

    Money is here to stay, maybe not in paper form, but there aint no

free, and I do mean free, I'm not a student, and I dont pay taxes etc...  
I also am very minimalistic. I have my  home system, a few of my fovorite 
books and that's it.  I dont have a bank acount, I keep it all in cash, 
what little I have, and I dont have a car, nor do I desire one.  I dont 
plan on buying a house or property either.

OK, so what do we have in a world minus evil?  Note that evil doesn't just 
mean bad guys out to screw up your life.  Evil equals pain, which me 
should have in our lives to give them some kind of meaning.  Take away the 
pain and you take away happiness.  With nothing to compare pleasure to, it 
has no value.
When all the people are nice, and we all help each other out, what are you 
going to do with your life?  A world like that is the Christian Heaven, 
which I fear and despise.  People who want the goody world without trouble 
are simply afraid of being hurt.  If that's the case, those people should 
just die and go on to their (fictional) heaven.  If not, deal with the 
pain in your life and find some way to overcome it by the works you do.
Work towards a perfect planet, but realize at the same time that your goal 
will never be accomplished.  Acknowledging the futility of our lives is 
what gives us power over the helplessness of our own mortality.  Wow, I'm

I never said that we would have a perfect world, I actually said the same 
thing you just posted, that the world will never be perfect.  you seem to 
think that we need pain and evil in our lives in order to have a purpose.  
i disagree totally.  Not that it'll ever happen, but even in a utopia you 
have meaning in your lives.  Work toward what can make you happier and 
others happier is allyou can do.  If you try to set up a utopia for 
everyone, your gonna fail.  Cause not everyones utopia will agree.  So all 
you can do is try to set up your own private one, not by desensitizing, or 
igno0ring things that hurt, but by working to minimize them.
 
    So  now the question is, how can you go about minimizing your "evil" 
without causing more?   My example would be my own personal way to dealing 
with greed.  I dont associate with money unless neccesary, which isnt 
much.  I have few possesions and kep it all in cash.  That way I can 
minimize the control people can excercise over me with money.  I am happy 
with very little so that's helpful, since I am not usually tempted by 
riches etc..
    As for other stuff, like rascism adn govt disparities,  you need to 
get active in the community, since those are external things.

and they are not truly neccesary to have a purpose in life.
    Without darkt there isnt light, without hurt there isnt joy,  it's a 
duality but neiother side is more responsible for defining you than the 
other.  I can say joy is just as responsible, Show me a person who has 
never felt joy and I'll show you a shallow person.
 
    Point bieng, you cant get rid of one without the other, but by

I must agree that saving money by such means as free net access is not 
minimizing the evils of greed or money.  To me, it seems to be one of the 
root problems.  We always seem to be finding ways to save money for 
ourselves while gathering luxuries at the same time.  There's nothing 
wrong with having or wanting something.  There's nothing evil in making 
your life more comfortable or enjoyable.  However, I fell you should pay 
for these comforts yourself, through your own labor instead of having 
someone else foot the bills.  
  If you don't then you're enjoying comforts paid for by the labors of 
another.  Isn't that the evil of greed?

Hmm Xela, we seem to disagree one a point here.  I attempt to minimize the 
negative impact of things on myself.  You say that by doing this I 
maximize them onothers.  Tell me, how does me not owning alot of stuff 
hurt other people?  How does me getting free net acces hurt other people?  
Actually, it's not freee, I just dont pay for it, the University does and 
the cost is so minimal when you realize just how many accounts they have 
here unused.  Not to mention the fact that this institution is a  very 
money oriented and documented rascist institution.

      I fully ralize that there is an reaction to every action, but by 
doing this, meaning by not having a car furniture bank account etc... who 
am i hurting?  

    Perhaps we should all just not do anything for fear of somehow 
unknowingly slighting some person overseas or next door.  your arguments 
suggest that we cant do anything for fear of hurting others.

    Well Meadrhos you make a good argument that me aquiring free acces is 
in some way evil, but I think perhaps I should have clued people in on my 
motivation for this.  Okay, to me infromation should be free, I believe by 
geting net acces to as many people as possible we are doing this.  I do 
not mean free as in money wise, but free as in acces.  Everyone should 
have acces to this information on the net.  I myself put up a BBS 
containing much of the information on the net as I can pack on my HD, and 
also lists of files etc.. from FTP sites, so people can request them and I 
can go get them.  i do this all free, because the institution here has 
many acounts which are never used, I simply use on of them.  WIth the 
permission of the owner.

    Also, I see it not as making others pay, you see even if I wasnt to do 
this the money would still be payed, not only that, but this institution 
that I operate from is far from som innocent little univ.  THey are a 
money groveling and very greedy intstitute, whith many cases of doumented 
and institutionalized rascism, genderism, and corruption.  WHile my use of 
accounts may not do all hat much to stop these, it does do a tiny part.

    So you see, I am not hurting someone, I am hurting something.  And 
this someting has it coming.

  Well, I'm not sure if what this institution's done to deserve anything, 
but since you've always presented yourself as level-headed I'll grant you 
the assumption that they had it coming.  I don't know if two rights make a 
wrong, but I'm not a good judge because it sure makes me feel good to 
screw over someone who's "had it coming".  But, more to the point, I was 
worried about what precedence you might be laying down.  While I'm sure 
your net access in itself is rather harmless, I was worried about what 
kind of lifestyle that thinking can create.  For instance, using the same 
justification, I could steal cable TV, credit card numbers (corporate ones 
at least, as they don't hurt a someone but rather a something), and any 
other of a number of things.  
  It's not that I think your thinking is wrong, it's just that I think 
it's easily subject to abuse.  Or, to put it bluntly, I don't think you 
mean any harm, but living by your own applications, I could interpret them 
to cause a lot of harm.  While the act seems rational, the reasons seem 
subject to abuse by another party.
  BTW, congrats on the BBS.  It's mighty nice to see so many pc systems 
supporting BBS's for free.  We've got a lot of them in my neck of the 
woods and they bring in a lot of info for people not in college who 
wouldn't normally have any access at all.

Greetings all:
    I've been out of the loop for a while, this time reading Jacques 
Derrida, and once again I've missed a fantastic discussion.
Maedhros, I'd like to take issue with a general premise that you seem to 
advocate in your post #390.  While I sympathize with your feeling that 
some people enjoy "undeserved" wealth and privelege in our society, I must 
disagree with what seems to be your critreia for who deserves those perks 
and priveleges.  You assert that people should basically get what they 
earn with their own labor, a seemingly reasonable assertion.  However, 
it's based on a faulty assumption.  You assume that people who work hard 
actually EARN or CREATE the wealth that they receive.  This is patently 
untrue.
    From my experience, the fruits of society do not go to those who work 
hard.  You'll have a hard time convincing me that George Bush EARNS or 
CREATES the $22 million dollars/year that he receives in salary (in other 
words his net worth is more than 10 times higher, this is just net income 
per year).  Did he EARN this?  Does he DESERVE it in any way?  What about 
the person who works two jobs, has no insurance, is trying to put himself 
through school, and earns only $16,000 dollars per year?  Presuming that 
this person works twice as hard as the retired president, shouldn't he 
earn twice as much?  Is hard work really the system by which wealth is 
distributed?  No, of course not.  Nevertheless, George Bush (and a lot of 
other wealthy people) justify their greed by arguing that they EARNED 
their position in society.  They justify the fact that they are screwing 
the rest of us, by arguing that they worked for what they got.  
Conversely, they argue, that the poor people are to blame for their 
situation because they refuse to work hard (a very popular, and very wrong 
over-generalization).  George Bush proves that hard work is NOT the way to 
become wealthy, but rather a combination of luck and priveledge 
(primarily) and, no doubt, hard work helps.  However, there are a lot of 
people who work very hard and will never be near as wealthy as Mr. Bush.
    So what am I saying?  I'm saying that the Puritan Work Ethic (work 
hard, and the money will come), (God helps those who help themselves), 
etc., is a philosophy that allows the rich justify their greed.  That 
philosophy keeps the rich rich and the poor poor.  It is a long-held
vehicle of oppression.  The puritan work ethic is a lie that the rich 
people feed to the poor people to keep the poor working hard.  In turn, 
the hard work of the poor keeps the rich rolling in dough.
    But if I read you correctly, you recognize that the rich people gare 
getting more than they deserve.  You're arguing that this is unfair, and 
of course it is.  No doubt you'd also argue that the poor  people should 
not receive any assistance from the government that they don't earn 
through their own labor.  In a utopia (dangerous place) perhaps hard work 
would be the criterion that society would use for the distribution
of wealth.  However, I prefer to discuss the real world.  And in this real 
world, where most wealthy people got there not from hard work but from 
being born to it, or lucky enough to get it, or vile enough to rob others 
of it, etc. ... in this world I refuse to criticize poor people for taking 
assistance from the government that they didn't earn when the rich didn't 
earn what they got either.  I refuse to engage in that type of 
hypocrisy.  I think that the puritan work ethic invites us to this 
hypocrisy in some very dangerous ways.

You seem to hold not only some of the sanest views on this base, but aloso

    Anway, you are right about the puritan work ethic as being a lie. I f 
you look closely at history, there have been few major changes in
 the major social castes( high, middle, low)--the only exception I can 
think of is the  rise of  cities in middle age Europe. Almost any other 
time, any promises of real change has been utter Bullshit. 
    But this is not what I really wan tot talk about right now. Right now 
I want  to adress something that always angers me: the religiousright. I 
just finished reading an article about these crazed fascist bastards of 
the cross, and I ready to put bullets through each and every one of those 
lunatics heads. but then I would be at their levle. YOu see, what they 
want to do is say tht they do actually know the true words of God, and 
know these holly-rollers are going to deliver it to us unenlightened fold. 
And do you know these worst part: just being able to look at this movement 
and see that is anchored in greed and selfisness, and vanity. Here I
 am, trying to come to terms with God and the concept of a savoir, and 
now they are trying to tell me that if I don't see it their way, I'm going 
to hell, and it's all for money--sons fo bitches.

  Well, you hit the proverbial nail on the head.  No, I don't think it's 
right to take what you don't earn.  However, you also caught another 
point I was trying to make- everyone doesn't live by these rules, 
especially a lot of the rich.  
  However, regardless of what the rich do, it does not necessarily justify 
anyone elses actions.  BTW, I'm not sure where Bush's money comes from off 
the top of my head.  If it's inheritance, fine, nothing wrong with making 
your children wealthy if you can (I would if I could).  If, on the other 
hand, he earns it through business and he does business anything like his 
son- Well, we oughta but a bullet in his brain and put him out of our 
misery.
  The main point I would like to bring to focus is that you cannot justify 
immoral actions by the immorality around you.  Of course, to accept 
immorality in this case, you'd have to agree at least with the premise 
that taking things for free at the expense of others is a basically "evil" 
action.  If you don't grant that premise, I fear I'll owe an additional 
post on theft and immorality ;-)
  BTW, are you insinuating that my ideals or possibly myself are Puritan 
in nature?  I take offense sir!

While I will not question your atheism, for you have every right

against the Roman Catholic Church.  Holy Church has been the faithful 
guardian of the teachings of Christ for one thousand years.  As the bride 
of our Lord, it has maintained, unbroken, the line of succesion of the 
apostles, as well as the successor to Peter, Pope John Paul II.  I regret 
your ignorance that you display towards my faith, and worry about the 
consequence it may have upon your soul.  However,I trust in the 
saving power of grace (wj=hich you have probably never heard 
of) it states that even if one does not practice the faith 9or even a 
faith) they may still be saved by the Divine Prescence in ways that are 
beyond the power of mortal reasoning.  I pray for your soul; and also that 
perhaps one day you will understand that your anti-catholicism is just 
another form of hate and bigoted, no matter how "intellectual" you may

Hmmm...
    Perhaps we're not communicating effectively.  I spent a great deal of 
time arguing something that you just skipped over, and I want to go back 
to it.  My point was, I thought, that the entire notin that you "earn" 
what you get is a myth.  Noone "earns" what they have; people get what 
they have because they were born to it, or lucked into it, or whatever.  
The point is that the entire notion that one "earns" anything is a myth, 
perpetrated by the wealthy, to justify why they have lots of power and the 
rest of us don't.  With the "earn" myth in tact, the wealthy can justify 
their status by saying that they "earned" it, and the rest of us didn't, 
and that makes it O.K. for them to live high on the hog while millions of 
people are struggling to survive day by day.
    Now, about accusations of Puritanism.  In fact, sir, I'm accusing you 
of something much worse.  I'm accusing you of spreading and advocating a 
philosophy that is a tool of oppression.  In arguing that people should 
"earn" what they have, you're playing right into the hands of the wealthy 
and the powerful, aiding them in staying where they are, and helping them 
to exploit the labor of those of us who are less powerful than they.  With 
this, sir, I pick up the glove and return it to you.

Well, the way I deal with the "Go to hell" people is with pretty simple 
logic.  They tell me that I'm going to hell unless I repent, pay, 
whatever.  I say "OK, what if I do become a real nice Christian type?"  
Well, then you go to heaven, which is the best place in the world!  "Well, 
if that's so, then I'm already in heaven.  There's no place I'd rather be 
than on earth, alive.  If God wants to send me to heaven, then he'll just 
have to let me live forever, which he won't do.  So, he'll have to send me 
to hell, which, paradoxically, would be the Christian heaven.  Therefore, 
God, if he is as they say he is, cannot exist, because he would have no

I honestly don't think my attacks against the Catholic church are bigoted. 
 At least, they seem no more bigoted than if I had attacked the KKK.  The 
Catholic church has, for centuries, preached love and practiced hate.  Who 
was it that spearheaded the attack against European tribesman in the 
Middle Ages for refusing to accept an alien religion thrust upon them?  
Who made a regular practice of burning scientist as witches for daring to 
simply report the truth of their findings?  Who, besides the Nazis, proved 
themselves so skilled at the art of torture and mass murder (i.e. the 
Inquisition)?  Who excommunicated all of Britain, said they were all going 
to hell and forced most of Western Europe to discontinue trade with them 
because they were protestant?
  Love?  Please!  When I speak of the Catholic church it is with disdain.  
Not out of ignorance, but out of knowledge.  I've had to study their 
atrocities far too many times.  It saddens me, even as a "nonbeliever", 
that the teachings of so great a philosopher as Christcould be left in the 
keeping of such a perverse institution.

*Maedhros picks up his glove, doffs his silly, foppish hat and draws a

Sir, I believe I didn't address your ffirst point fully.  I shall now 
rectify that.

Firstly, I don't agree with your premise.  While not all money is 
"earned", this does NOT lead to the conclusion that NO money is earned, as 
you stated in your last post.  It is falacious to presume that since some 
'A' is 'B', then no 'A' is 'C'.  Or, since some money is not earned, no 
money is earned.

Assuming it is actually possible to get a job, work and be paid, let me 
move onto a different issue.  I was originally addressing whether or not 
it was right to take something paid for by another's labor.  I need to 
clarify that statement a bit.  It is not right to take something paid for 
by another's labor without their permission.  This, I believe, is the 
definition of theft as well.  Clearly, such financial gain from a lottery 
or inheritance is not covered under this definition.

Do you have a different opinion than this, or was I merely being 
ambiguous?

In clarification:
    I believe that wealth (things) is NEVER earned, not by the poor, not 
by the rich, and not by the middle class.  There's another mechanism at 
work which decides how wealth is distributed in our society.  Now I can't 
say exactly what that system is, but I'm sure it's unjust.  The notion 
that one can go to work and "earn" money is the myth.  You may go to work 
and "get" money, but you didn't "earn" it in the sense that you "deserved" 
what you got.  George Bush just doesn't "deserve" $22 million/year, and 
the poor, uneducated guy who's hodling down two jobs and is making barely 
$20,000 per year doesn't "deserve" to be so exploited.  You see, the words 
"earn" and "deserve" go together.  As long as you believe that people 
"earn" money and wealth, then you will believe that the rich "deserve" to 
be rich and the poor "deserve" to be poor.  I simply cannot endorse this 
point of view.
    But, further, about the question of whether or not it is right to take 
something that was "paid for" by another person's labor (without their 
permission).  First off, I don't believe that any individual in any way 
"earned" the wealth (things) that they have.  People don't "deserve" their 
property in any way.  I do believe that they "own" their property, 
however, and are entitled to keep it if they obtained it with the 
permission of society in general.  I do not advocate individual acts of 
theft or piracy against the property of individuals.  What I do advocate, 
however, is class-action theft if you will, namely taxes.  I believe that 
we as a political body have the right to sieze property and wealth from a 
class of people (not individuals, singled out for particular punishment, 
but a class of people who get paid similar ammounts of money per year).  
This type of wealth-taking is just, in my opinion, and necessary for the 
survival of the state.  This is not "theft" according to your definition,
however, because citizens have given the government "permission" to tax, 
have they not?

But, of course, it is unethical to take that which belongs to someone 
else, but why are we even discussing this?  What benefit can be gained 
from a discussion of some ethical code that hardly anyone follows?  As 
beautiful as our utopian code may be, it is still utopian, not real, never 
was real, and never will be.  No universal law like that can (or should?) 
be forced on everyone.  If I remember correctly, that's how the atrocities 
of the counter-reformation came about.  The Catholic Church was so sure 
that they had "the truth" that they were willing to torture dessenters in 
order to help them "see the light" of their truth.  Utopian visions (and 
supposedly universal ethical codes) are dangerous.

Having said that, it occurs to me to try to discover who benefits from an 
ethical code that says "it's wrong to take what you don't own?"  Well, 
since the poor own very little, and the wealthy own a lot, it seems that 
the "don't take what you don't own" credo is just another tool of the 
wealthy forced upon us all to protect their power and position.  Once 
again, Maedhros, I must accuse you of advocating and spreading a 
philosophy that aids and abbets the rich.

    There is a real problem with taking the bible by its word, especially 
those versions which are not in the original Hebrew.  Other versions in 
other languages are *translations* and so can be interpreted in ways which 
differ from the original intent, take that into account with all the 
different versions of religions which use the bible, also take into 
account the individual nature of the preacher, etc.  What you have is 
multiple interpretations of one thing, leading to internal dissent etc.  
This leads to new religions all preaching hatred of anything different, 
after all your religion doesn't go far unless it uses aggressive 
advertising, no?  So Xtianity dissolves and now there are baptists, 
episcopalians, protestants, catholics, blah blah.  All of which say that 
the other groups will go to a lukewarm hell, while the nonbelieving 
heathens will go to a really shitty hell, whatever that means.  One 
conclusion can be drawn from this chaos: religion is ambivalent, bigoted, 
and useless.
    I will even go as far as to say that my problem not only deals with 
the religion itself, but its followers as well, who don't have the guts to 
stand on their own feet and accept the tenets of teir individual faith 
like mindless sheep to the slaughterhouse.  I don't see the Nazi excuse of 
"oh, I'm just following orders," as an excuse for following the arrogant 
and psychopathic doctrines of death religions.

If no one earns anything that they supposedly work for, then what's the 
purpose of doing any work at all?  If I didn't earn the money I got at my 
summer job, then why did my boss give me that money?  I don't think it's 
really possible to say yes/no on the question oof earning things.  Sure, 
there are people who don't earn their money, just as some people don
 not receive what they deserve.
OK, so we have the question of Why Work?  Well, in life there are two 
systems of thought for motivation.  You can run your mind on a Reward 
System or an Achievement system.  There was a thing on NPR during the 
summer about people who were brought up with either system.  Reward system 
kids grew up to be people who wold only do work if promised osmething 
material in return.  Achievement kids do work for its own sake, not 
expecting supreme gratitude in the form of wealth.  When I listened to the 
show, the Achievement people wounded much nicer.
OK, I believe in doing work for its own sake.  I don't need monetary 
compensation for my efforts.  I do, however, appreciate being paid for 
work that I do.  I delivered pizza last summer, and I enjoyed doing it, so 
I didn't bitch about low pay or working conditions or anything because I 
enjoyed doing a good job.  I didn't expect to get huge tips or bonuses or 
anything, since one should not expect such things.
Most people don't operate on pure achievement.  They expect to be wll-paid 
for any and all efforts.  Whether they earn what they receive or not is a 
ver subjective thing, something that cannot be determined be a yes or no 
on deserving wealth.

While your argument may apply to Christianity, it does NOT apply to 
Judaism.  Basically, Judaism does not concern itself with the notion of 
hell and heaven.  In the Jewish faith, when you die, you generally go to a 
better place, no matter what.  Everyone is invited to join in the Jewish 
community.  I should emphasize the word "community" here, since Judaism 
concerns itself with building a strong community.  Tradition, education,

Whenever people get religious they always stick up for their team; it's 
part of the programming.  Obviously you feel very strongly about Jewish 
religion, but I would like to mention that Jews are known to not get along 
with blacks and vice versa.  Also, I would also like to mention that 
Israel, a nation based on protecting the religion, is territory which once 
belonged to someone else.  This can be described as similar to
the Colonists taking native American land, no?  So I think if Jews condone 
the theft of territory from one culture, I think I can include it within 
my definition of an evil religion.

  The following is meant for Ching in particular, so if you're religious, 
please don't take offense:

  Look here cheesedick (What's a cheesedick, by the way?)!

  Your presumption of why I should adhere to agnosticism is ludicrous.  
What if there is a God and I die.  What am I going to say when I get to 
Heaven?  You think He won't know I'm just a fence-sitting pussy?  Doubt 
it.  By definition, he is omniscient.  Somehow I don't think I'll be very 
welcome.

  At any rate, your reasons for agnosticism are preposterous.  In an 
infinite universe it would indeed be falacious to presume something could 
not exist.  However, by the same pattern of  logic, I could presume that 
the whole cosmos was created from the fecies of the Giant Celstial 
Antelope.  It could be true, by definition, but you don't see me setting 
up a shrine in the bathroom.

  The bottom line is that religion is based on faith.  If you don't have 
any then you have no business being involved in any way with it.  It 
implies that you lack any confidence in your own beliefs.  If you can't 
have faith, at least have a spine.

  I'd rather be friends with a devout Christian, Jew, or even a Satanist 
then with an agnostic.  At least they have confidence and character 
(albeit a somewhat strange character, from my perspective).

  If I die and there is a God then I'll have to say,"Well why the Hell did 
you give me a brain and reasoning and no proof.  Pretty shitty trick."

*Maedhros attempts a swift parry*

Firstly, sir, you speak of another system at work instead of earning.  
Unfortunately, you also say you don't know what it is.  I'm afraid I can't 
at the moment accept this theory.  While I've stated that the system of 
"earning" is indeed at work and have what I consider powerful empirical 
evidence in support, you not only have not cited any evidence, but you 
have not even defined your alternative.  Without any definition or 
evidence I'm afraid I can make no analysis of this alternative.

Secondly, you stated that people don't "earn" what they "deserve".  
"Deserve" in the case of earning is a very subjective concept.  What 
someone deserves depends on an employer and overall needs of a business.  
Also, the amount of available labor in a particular field is a variable.  
Needless to say, there are a host of other variables, but they are not 
necessary to cover at this time.  The point is, you mistake "deserve" as a 
constant.  It is not.  It is a variable determined by the needs and 
sometimes the whims of society.  Does Bush deserve to be wealthy and 
powerful.  Well, when he ran for office, it seems that a majority of 
soceity set the variable rate of deserving very high.  To establish a 
relationship between work and deserving I'll submit:

E=WxD

E= Earnings
W= Time invested in work (Note:  Sometimes employers opt for a fixed
income regardless of hours invested.  In which case, they would set
W at 1 with a proportionately higher D value)
D= Any numerical value set as the current rate for a particular 
occupation seet forth by both the employer and soceity)

Thirdly, you stated that it is not right to seize other people's property 
(although, you yourself admitted that they didn't earn or deserve it?), 
but it is alright to take property from a class.  That's like saying I 
couldn't rape a single woman, but it would be alright if I raped every 
Upper Middle Class one in the US.  Murder is a no-no, but genocides 
alright?  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  The logic behind it is 
that individual crimes are wrong, but are excusable on a mass scale.  
Don't misunderstand, I think taxes are justifiable and legal.  I don't 
accept that there is a corrollary between theft and taxation, I simply 
wished to address what I saw as a fallacious logical process.

Fourthly, you state that Utopian ideals are useless in the real world.  
Once again, I beg to differ.  I will grant you that a utopian society is 
indeed unachievable.  However, the discarding of utopian ideals seems 
unnecessary and destructive.  If one cannot have everything perfect, it 
seems a bit childish to refuse to even attempt to make things a bit 
better.  Sure, the world won't be a perfect place, but why should that 
stop anyone from striving to make the best of it.  You stated a while back 
that the rich should be taxed in order to make life better for the poor.  
By your own attacks upon utopian ideals, what's the point?  If we can't 
help everyone of them and make all there lives perfect, why not just let 
them all rot?

Finally, you asked who benifits from the presumption thqt it's not right 
to take what you don't earn.  In response, I would like to take a look at 
who benifits from the presumption that it is alright to take what you 
don't earn.  Well, muggers, rapist, and thives would certainly prosper 
under a Laelth revised political system.  I suppose it would definately 
open up new career doors for corporate raiders, military dictators and 
George Bush's son as well.

ok, first of all, i don't have a clue what a cheesedick really is, though 
I use it alot. I picked it up from some guy down the hall. I'll ask him 
some day. 
I was using it ottally in jest, though, so don't get offended. 

    Anyhow. when I said people shoul dbe agnostict, I also said they 
should do so as opposed to just  being atheist. I think that atheism is 
totally prepoosterous, because you're claiming to know something that you 
can't know. Religion, logically, would have the same defect. however, you 
have a better chance of havingg an enjoyable afterlife if you bet on a 
religion rather than nothing. 
    obviously, though , when talking about agnsticism, I should have made 
it clearer for everyone to understand.  You see, agnosticism, on a purely 
philisophical level, isn't saying" uh, I don't know". It is  recognizing 
that you can't ever know whether or not god does exist. not in this life. 
so, they simply don't acknowledge the quesiton. 
    And yes, religion is a faith issue--you have that right. just like 
good ole Soren Kierkegaard, told us. We can't belive in religion 
logically, logically we must be agnostic. the trick to religion is not to 
accept it on a logical basis, but rather to make a leap of faith into it. 
    Point is--it's about time I gave on:)--is that I was not really even 
trying to get into a religious arguement, they are useless and I refuse to 
argue that point any further. i was just trying to get a group of people 
, the atheists, to open their minds to the universe a bit. We live chained 
in logic, it is a shame for anyone to not at least see that there could be 
more to life than logic--maybe. So get off my damn back;)

  It would seem that I need to clarify myself as well however.  When I say 
that I'm atheist, I don't mean to imply that I know God doesn't exist.  I 
mean that I think it is so far removed to the realm of inprobability that 
I have trouble taking the possibility seriously.  I don;t know for sure, 
but what's sure in life?  As a scientist, I'm forced to make assumptions 
given high enough probability factors.  We don't know for sure, but we'd 
never get anywhere if we waited on absolute truths.

One of the strangest and most disturbing things about the tensions between 
the black and Jewish communities is that Jews should be some of the most 
natural allies of blacks.  The similarities in the respective histories 
correlate very well (slavery, etc.), and, in fact, Jews are one of the 
only groups left willing to vote for a black candidate.  Odd, and 
annoying, and I don't have an explanation for it.

Re Israel, I would like to distinguish the unfairness of the existence of 
Israel from the evils of other religions.  In many forms of Christianity, 
the bad things done were done by the Church, whereas in Israel's case, 
there really is no central Church.  Therefore, it is not quite the same 
comparison to say that Judaism as a whole was responsible for the problems 
of Israel.
Personally, I disapprove of the way that Israel has acted in the past 
toward the people who used to live in that land.  Finally, things are 
starting to improve in that region.  Maybe the people in charge there can 
rectify the crimes their grandfathers and fathers committed and clear 
their names.
Maybe I'm a little biased in this regard, I don't know.  You tell me.

There are multiple reasons for atheism.  Some people (like me) choose 
atheism because I cannot include the existence of God in my system of 
thought.  For me to believe or to not be sure of God's existence would 
make me a person I am not.  It just would not quite work for me to be 
unsure of myself in this regard.  I am definite about a few things in my 
mind, but I do not believe in God, even if he does exist.  :)
It is also just as acceptable to me for someone to choose agnosticism.  I 
don't buy that bullshit about having to make a choice and that not knowing 
is pussying out.  If you're not sure, you're not sure, and it would be 
pointless to decide one way or the other just to seem solid to the

What you must realize, Maedhros, is that the "architecture" of the church, 
is temporal in nature (by that I mean the Vatican, Holy Church itself is 
based on the communion of saints, which is the spiritual foundation of the 
faith).  You argue about some of the secular 'abuses" created by those who 
are identified with the church.  While of course, certainly the temporal 
church has not been a perfect vessel at times for the message of Christ, 
it must be remembered that neither is the temporal world, of which it is 
part and must function.  However, the bottom line remains, for over one 
millenia the temporal church has stood as a witness to the grace of Jesus 
Christ, imperfect though it may be.

  My problem with the secular "imperfections" is not that they're not

attempted genocide.  It is that these imperfections caused much of the

they decided it was of tantamount importance to own a strip of desert.

literal.  When I said I advocated legal theft (taxation), I did not mean 
that I condoned any crime perpetrated by the government upon a class of 
people.  In no way do I advocate class rape, or class murder, as I'm sure 
you know.  I'll forgive this feeble attempt to discredit me, but only 
because it is so easily parried.  In fact, the post to which you refer 
makes very clear that taxation is OK only because the people have granted 
the government the power to tax.  They have not granted the government the 
power to rape, although many states have legalized murder (the death 
penalty).  That debate, howver, must wait.  For now suffice it to say that 
I commit no logical fallicy here.  The government has been granted by the 
people the power to tax (not rape).  Thus, taxation is OK.  At this stage, 
I feel you should go back to post #419.  Most of your arguments are based 
upon this *misunderstanding,* and little of what you say there seems 
relevant once this issue is clarified.

*Parry #2*
    Absolutely, deserve is a relative term.  That's why I don't like using 
it in connection with the word "earn."  It's a dangerous combination.  And 
yes, thank you for creating the math that my argument lacked.  I'll grant 
you that  E=W*D, but only where E=income (not earnings).  "Earnings" 
assumed that you "earned" what you got paid, which I don't believe.  You 
may have "gotten" x dollars, but you didn't in any way "create" that 
money, or the wealth (stuff, things) that you can buy with that money.  
Since you didn't create those things, then you didn't "earn" them.
In any case, all I said about the system that distributes wealth in our 
society is that it's not fair.  I'll grant that E=W*D may be the system 
that decides how wealth is distributed, but is it fair?  True, I speak 
only from my own subjective point of view.  Fair is a relative term (as if 
some terms weren't?).  Nevertheless, do you really want to argue that the 
current system is fair?  Do you want to argue that it's fair for Bush to 
earn $22 million/year for doing nothing (at this stage of his life), while 
the poor man from my example is earning less than $20,000/yea while
holding down two jobs?  Is that fair?

Forgive me all.  Maedhros pages me as we speak, but I shall return with 
parry #3.

  I'll take the liberty of replying to the first two points in advance.

1.  I agree that your previous post DOES make clear your stand on 
taxation.  However, I would not go so far as to call it a feeble attack.  
The weakness of the argument didn't lie on my deductions, but rather you 
communication.  It is important to remember that verbal and somatic
 cues are not transmittable across the net.  Sarcasm or jesting is best 
refrained from unless you include notation to point out your meaning.  The 
only thing that came acroos was that you were waffling.  This deserved a 
reply.

2.  Since the Middle ages, it has been rare that someone earns what they 
create.  Unfortunately, the barter system has outlived its usefulness.  
It'd take a lot of pigs to buy a Cadillac.  So, in its place, we have 
instituted paper money.  The money simply means that you've earned so many 
pigs for your labor.  It's just easier to fit in a wallet.  It does not 
constitute any less than an actual, physical product however, so should 
still be treated as property earned.  You seem hell bent for leather on 
establishing that an employer handing you a check has nothing to do with 
wether or not you did any work for him.  An easy way to gather empirical 
data for this theory would be to walk into a store you've never been in 
before and ask for your check.  If he gives you one, then there's 
apparently no corellation.  While you can argue that there is an unfair 
correlation between work and earnings, it's a bit ludicrous to say that no 
corellation exists.

    As far as fair goes, you are correct in saying that it is subjective.  
However, since everyone can't have there own interpretation of fair 
implemented as a law, a compromise is necessary.  The US handles this 
compromise by letting it fall to a majority consensus.  No, it's not 
perfect, but it's as "fair" as it can get.

*laelth returns to a lively discussion with yet another parry.*

    Now let me see, where were we.  Oh yes, the question of whether or not 
it's useful to talk about a utopian moral code when, in fact, very few 
people actually follow such a code ... 
    Sir, I never said that it was "useless" to talk about utopian moral 
codes.  I simply said it was "dangerous."  People like Adolf Hitler are 
famous for preaching morals.   I can add to this list numerous 
teleevangelists, popes, puritan witch-hunters.  Do you really wish to 
reside in their midst?  Do you want to continue to repeat their tired 
arguments?  If so, count me out.  We can argue till our faces turn blue 
about how "all people" should behave.  In doing so, however, I feel that 
we secretly desire to force our own moral values on others.  I will try, 
vigilantly, not to join you in this endeavor.
    I would prefer to respond to how people DO act.  I would prefer to use 
the government to make the world a better place.  I would prefer to use 
government as a means of equalizing some of the injustices that our 
natures create.  You know how this works right?  Government, for the
people, by the people, etc.?  Of course, lately (since 1776) government
here has mostly been for the rich, by the rich, etc., but I'm enough of an 
idealist to believe that this can change.

*Parry #4*
    Interseting turn-about.  Rather than addressing my thrust, you 
conveniently misunderstood me, and turned it around.  I never argued that 
it's OK to take what you don't earn.  Shall I quote myself?

    "I do believe that people 'own' their property, and are entitled to
    keep it if they obtained it with the permission of society in 
    general."

This is pretty self-evident, isn't it?  I shall forgive you (this time) 
for misunderstanding me, but only under the provision that you respond to
the substance of my main argument.

*laelth thrusts*

    As I have said before, and hope I will not have to say again, the 
notion that one "earns" the wealth that one recieves is a myth promoted by 
the wealthy which keeps the rich rich and the poor poor.  The rich justify 
the fact that they live the good life while others suffer by saying that 
they "earned" their wealth and position.  They believe that they "deserve" 
what they've got because they "earned" it.  Conversely, the poor "deserve" 
to be poor, because they didn't "earn" the good life through hard work.  
It is thus that the rich justify their position while at the same time 
convincing the poor to work hard (in hopes of becoming rich, "earning" the 
good life).  Of course, millions of people work hard all their lives and 
never get rich.  The rich exploit the workers, get rich off of their 
labor, and continue to live well while the workers (the vast majority) 
struggle for survival.  It is my contention that a philosophy which argues 
that wealth is "earned" and therefore "deserved" is the principal force 
guiding this injustice.
    Once again, I accuse you of advocating and spreading a philosophy that 
aids and abbets the rich and the powerful.  How, sir, do you plead?

Dear JasonLee and other gentle readers:
    Let me tell a little story.  I once dated a girl whose parents were 
strong fundamentalist christians.  They were very interested in my 
religious beliefs and gave me a thorough grilling on the subject.  I told 
them that I was an atheist, and they didn't like this answer at all.  In 
fact, they kept grilling me on the subject until they could get me to say 
that I wasn't sure if there was a God or not.  Then they could label me as 
an agnostic.  I was less of a threat to their beliefs that way.
    Nevertheless, reflection on that experience confirmed for me what I 
knew all along, that I'm really an atheist.  Here's why.  Faith is a 
matter of belief, not proof.  Christians *believe* in the existence of a 
supreme being, they can't prove it's existence.  If they could, it 
wouldn't be called "faith," which is belief without proof.  In fact, there 
would be no merit in believing in God if his existence could be proven.  
It's essential to Christianity that Christians be "true believers," not 
scientific fact-finders.
    It is in this way that I can confidently call myself an atheist.  I 
"believe" as strongly as any Christian believes otherwise, that there is
no God, as described by Christianity.  I can't prove this assertion, but 
niether can they prove to the contrary.
    Having said that, let me say that I hope there is an all-powerful, 
all-good God.  I hope I have an everlasting soul, even if it will be 
confined for eternity to the flames of perdition (heaven sounds boring).  
Nevertheless, I cannot help but believe that none of these exist.  What I 
believe is not a function of hope.  It's a matter of faith.

    Preferring to live in the here and now,

  Sir, you state that yu never said utopian ideals were useless.  Allow me 
to directly quote you from post #412:

What benefit can be gained from a discussion of some ethical code that 
hardly anyone follows?  As beautiful as our utopian code may be, it is 
still utopian, not real, never was, and never will be.

Call me slow-witted, but I find it hard to believe that I have once again 
grossly misunderstood your intent.  It seems pretty clear that, at the 
time, you didn't regard those ideals ass worth a second thought.  I also 
seriously doubt that you made this statement as well at an attempt at 
levity.  No sir, you are waffling once again.It will be difficult to 
defend your points until you decide what they are.

*Parry 4*

  I did indeed manuever away from your question.  My apologies, I shall 
rectify this problem now.  Firstly though, I would like to defend my 
cxounter-question.  I hardly consider my question and the answer 
inpertinent.  I think it is extremely relevant who would benifit if we 
removed the earn what you get mentality of our nation.  
  But, back to the point. Who does profit from the status-quo of working 
and earning.  Well, I for one.  No, I'm not anything approaching wealthy, 
but I am given the opportunity to reach that plateau.  I work, my ass off 
and don't get hardly anything to show for it.  However, those rivch people 
you despise do pay taxes and coincedentally put money in the financial aid 
fund which is putting me through school.  For some reason you seem to 
think of them as despots.  Not true.  While, given my present situation, 
it is more difficult for me to attain a better life, it is far from 
impossible.  I'm not being subjugated into poverty.  On the contrary, the 
rich are helping me pay for my education and thereby removing myself from 
my current life.
  What would hold me back from any kind of success, wqhich is wqhy I 
brought up my counter-question in the first place, is if the status-quo 
were not maintained.  What would you have us dfo?  Redistribute the 
wealth?  Demand equall compensation for all labor?  Well, it certainly 
worked wonders on the Soviet economy.  Maybe we can be the next bankrupt 
superpower.  Where do I sign up?

This message is in no way an endorsement of Any Rand's philosophy, but I 
am advancing it to you as something to think about.  

You claim that the word earn can have no meaning as we do not create 
anything: 
"You 
may have "gotten" x dollars, but you didn't in any way "create" that 
money, or the wealth (stuff, things) that you can buy with that money.  
Since you didn't create those things, then you didn't "earn" them.
"

There is something which separates us from other animals, in that we are, 
for lack of a better word, industrialized.  In other words, that which 
natural endowment has failed to give us, we have created.  Such useful 
examples include bridges and cars, both ease transportation and improve 
the general quality of life.  Cars and bridges are not grown on trees, if 
they were your argument woudl have merit, as both are man-made.  As a way 
of dealing with each other on this planet, and providing each other with 
neccessary goods for existance, we have to build cars and bridges.  They 
cannot be grown by nature, they exist as an extension of Man, his mind, 
and his strength.  We also create the unit of currency, money, to equal 
out and give value to goods.  Money buys that which is created by Man.  
Wealth is what you can create, be it cars, bridges, aeroplanes, etc.  by 
hand, by *your* hand.

In this sense, if you create wealth, i.e. work to produce goods, then you 
earn wealth.

Whether you are altruistic or selfish is a matter of internal principle, 
but the fact remains if you create wealth, you earn wealth.

Alex,
    Thanks for the thoughtful reply, and thanks for wisely noting that you 
do not advocate the philosophy of Ayn Rand.
    Perhaps some people "create" wealth (farmers, factory workers,
laborers), but even these are not pure examples.  Factory workers do
not create the steel that they assemble together, farmers do not
create their own tools, etc.  The way I see it, the people who "get" most 
of the wealth (Capitalists, Industrialists, businessmen), don't create 
that wealth at all.  Thus, they don't "earn" the wealth that they get.  
Nor do they "deserve" it in any way.  Of course, I don't think that the
laborers that I mentioned "earn" or "deserve" the wealth that they get 
either.  Do you see what I'm driving at?  "Earning" and "deserving" and 
"creating" are completely meaningless terms when it comes to understanding 
how wealth is distributed in our society.  Let me repeat that.  "Earning" 
and "deserving" and "creating" are meaningless terms when it comes to 
understanding how wealth is distributed in our society.  Wealth is 
distributed according to some other formula.
    Maedhros and I have discussed what that formul might be in previous 
posts.  I can't say exactly what that formula is.  All I can say about it 
is that it's not FAIR.  It has nothing to do with "deserving" the wealth 
that you have because you "earned" it.  It has more to do with insuring 
that the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor.  (At least, that's what 
happens as a result of everyone believing that they "earned" their wealth 
and status.)
    It comes as no surprize to me that Ayn Rand most readily come to the 
aid of those who wish to support the status-quo.  I hope to never agree 
with Rand on any philosophical point, and I'm glad that I don't in this 
case.

Aaaaahhhh ...

*laelth begins to see a chink in Maedhros' armor, a chink which reveals
the truth underneath.*

Maedhros said, very plainly, in his last post that HE profits from the 
status quo.  This comes as no surprize.  Usually it's those that profit 
from the status quo who defend it.  Logical, no?  This should also make us 
suspicious of Maedhros' point of view, should it not?  He's biased, and he 
admits it.  (We should admire his honesty.)

But the fact is, that despite what he thinks, Maedhros is exactly the kind 
of person I'm talking about when I say that the rich use the "earn what 
you get" philosophy to program the masses.  He's been programmed.  Look at 
what he says, "I work my ass off and don't get hardly anything to show for 
it."  EXACTLY!   That's precisely what the rich want you to do, work hard 
for NOTHING, or very little.  They get rich, Maedhros works hard.  
Something is wrong here, isn't there?  I'm not saying that Maedhros should 
be lazy.  What I'm saying is that I think people should be more fairly 
compensated for the work that they do.  That's all!

*finally, laelth jabs at the open chink in an attempt to deal a crippling 
blow.*

Maedhros finally responded to my main argument in his last post.  I have 
accused him of spreading a philosophy that aids and abbets the rich, and 
in his last post he finally acknowledged the truth of that accusation.  He 
defends the rich overtly (finally) in his last post by saing that they're 
not despots.  He lauds them for paying taxes and helping him get through 
school.  (Aaaawww ... isn't that sweet of those generous rich people?)

Who is he kidding?  The rich (like the rest of us) avoid paying taxes as 
much as possible, and believe me, they don't pay taxes out of generosity 
or some noble principle.  They pay taxes because they have to, and I say, 
make 'em pay more!  But the people who are really putting you through 
school, Maedhros, are the poor and the middle class.  The middle-class 
aand the poor together pay a lot more in taxes.  You should thank them for 
your education.  (Actually, you should thank liberals who continue to 
fight for education funding in Congress.  Believe me, the conservatives 
would (and have) cut funds for education.  No doubt, they'd cut the 
education budget more if they could.)

Let me ask you some tactical questions, Maedhros.  Do you really want to 
defend the rich?  Do you really find rich people so kind and generous?  
Are you realliy enjoying the status-quo so much?  Are you, perhaps, afraid 
to change?  Don't you see the programming that you espouse?  Can you find 
a way to work yourself out of this corner?  Do you even want to get out of 
it?

*laelth stops his brutal assault to parry.*
  
One final point, as for redistributing the wealth, yes.  I think that this 
would be a good idea, but I would not be so stupid as to advocate a system 
like the one employed by the former USSR.  In general, I steer away from 
arguing that we can create a utopian system ofor wealth distribution. As
I have argued before, such a system would be dangerous.  However, I do
believe that we can change the current system.  I shy away from claiming 
that I have the answers to the problems of the world.  However, I can see 
the problems with the status quo.  I am compelled to address those 
injustices when I see them.  And from what I've seen, the current system 
of wealth distribution in the US is unjust.

I'm not sure it's safe to say that businessmen, managers, etc. do not 
create wealth.  Although they don't directly create a product as a farmer 
or factory worker do, they provide some framework for helping provide 
equipment and resources for the people who do build osmething tangible.  
In that way, they are indirectly creating the wealth from which they 
derive their income.  That is not to say, however, that they deserve what 
they receive (standard disclaimer (should we designate stdio.h as the 
standard disclaimer for that phrase?  Oops, I mean stddisclaim.h)).

*Maedhros evaluates the scratch and wonders when Laelth's adrenaline rush 
will where off enough for him to notice his left arm is missing*

  Is George Bush earning all his salary.  I will refuse to comment on this 
question in the future as this is the third time I'm repeating it already. 
Yes.  Quite simply, his salary is based on those who pay him.  Bush has 
nothing to do with determining his net worth.  Sure he can demand as much 
as he likes, but hell anybody can do that.  His worth is based on the 
decision of his employers.  Is his salary fair?  It would appear to be 
from the perspective of his employers.  The bottom line is that whether or 
not he's making to much is the business of those who are paying him, not 
anyone elses.  If you're footing the bill then fire him.  If you're not, 
then I don't quite understand what business of yours it is in the first 
place.  Quite simply, fair wages is determined by the employer.  If you 
don't like it quit.  You seem to be under the delusion that there's some 
kind of rich conspiracy.  As I've gathered from your posts, you don't seem 
to think of the rich as very nice people.  Then why the hell would they 
overpay him.  They obviously think he's doing something deserving for his 
wages.  
  You can argue that the common laborer is just as important, but it's a 
ludicrous assumption.  Gates at Microsoft makes about a thousand times as 
much as one of his delivery drivers.  However, if Gates quites, Microsoft 
would be in a world of shit.  If Bob the delivery guy pitched a fit about 
his paycheck and left, somehow I think they'd survive.  It's unskilled 
work.  Anybody with four limbs can do it.
  If the delivery guy made as much as Gates, do you think anybody would be 
dragging there ass through college.  Damn few.  
  Do I profit from the status quo?  Damned straight I do.  Why?  Because, 
despite what your hell bent to believe, there is no conspiracy to keep me 
poor, there is no repression of the masses and no (in case that's the next 
accussation) the government is not hiding Elvis on Mars.  I profit because 
I'm willing to work with it.  Do I start with an even chance?  Nope.  This 
isn't some board game.  We don't all start at GO with $200.  Everybody 
starts the game at a different place:  some better some worse.  You can 
cry repression and say your not going to play the game and sure enough 
it'll go on quite well without you and leave you behind.  Or, you can get 
off your ass and do some serious catching up.  I'd prefer to catch up 
myself.  

  The root of the problem seems to be that Laelth sees the world as a 
Marxist era, repressionist regime.  This isn't a labor camp.  Education is 
not even near approaching the level of unattainable.  Noone is stuck where 
they are, unless they won't put forth the effort.  The idea that there's 
some society of the rich plotting to keep everyone in their social strata 
is a groundless myth propogated by underachievers who see internal 
conflict as an easy means of personal gain at the expense of...well, 
anything, as long as it's not theirs.
  As for Laelth being suspicious of my personal bias...Is Laelth claiming 
to have no bias in how wealth and payment is distributed?  It would appear 
so, as he seems to think this invalidates my opinions.  Tis a truly great 
day, for I have met the first mortal who has no personal opinion and is 
not in any way influenced by money, work or payment.  
  As for my "programming"...Well, let's examine what programming I've 
undergone.  It appears that I've had some values or "ethics" instilled in 
me.  Well, I've been taught to work hard.  I've been taught not to expect 
instant gratification, as I think most have ny the time they reach 
puberty.  Oh, and horrors, I've been taught to be honest.  Well, if we 
throw away all that evil programming what does that leave.  Slothfulness, 
short-sightedness, no capacity for effort, and an indifference to honesty. 
I think I'll stick with the programming.  Although, I wish the best of 
luck to my colleagues who are stronger than I who can break free of the 
conditioning.
  Lastly, do I find the rich kind and generous?  Hell no!  Neither do I 
find the poor much better.  If you carry the illusion that the poor are a 
bunch of simple-minded, loving folk you don't get out much.  I don't find 
any class of people kind and generous and you're kidding yourself if you 
do.  That said, it seems that everyone, as a class, is pretty much out for 
themselves. If a new program were introduced in this country, I seriously 
doubt it would be for my benefit.  At least now, I know what I'm working 
with.  God knows what the next bunch would institute.  Better to stick 
with the known problems than the unknown.  Does change scare me?  Hell yes 
again.  Things are bad enough without turning the reins over to a pack of 
people who, when it comes to the bottom line, are just looking for an 
extra piece of pie for themselves from the rapidly diminishing tray.  
There is no altruism that motivates Laelth's cries of injustice, just 
greed.  As Laelth said himself, he doesn't have the answers to make it 
right.  What he does know is that someone else has goomething he wants and 
he'd rather take it than "earn" it.

Your programming works, i.e. it fits in with what allows for survival and 
prosperity in this culture.  Obviously you have a lot to lose if things 
change.

Laelth, I think you seriously need to reevaluate what it means, 
economically, to earn.  I think then you will see what wealth truly means.

Of a few things, however, I am certain.  I got Maedhros mad, which means

Of this I am also certain:  maedhros is no longer pretending to not be the

from.  We know what drives his ideology.

I am also certain that maedhros' ideology is dangerous.   He's convinced 
that everyone in the world should be "just like him,"  hard working, 
honest, etc.  And I'm tempted (oh so tempted) to agree with him.  I won't 
however, because I recognize to what end that philosophy leads.  Hitler's 
"final solution" was an attempt to do something like that, purify Germany,
get out those dishonest, cheating, lazy, good-for-nothing Jews.  I simply 
can't justify a philosophy that elevates my values above all others.  I 
have not the arrogance to insist that everyone in the US should be "just 
like me."  We must resist that kind of programming when we see it.  We 
cannot allow an individual or a class of people to believe that their
values should be emulated by all.  For, if they had the power, they would
force us to be like them if they could.  And if they couldn't force us, 
they'd kill us.

But Alex, don't you see?  I've been trying to help YOU to re-examine what 
it means to "earn."  That's why I've been saying it over and over.  If you 
choose not to listen that's your option, of course.  But please, save your 
economics lesson.  You could use some boning-up yourself. :)

Just look at your programming for a minute.  You work hard (you make the
rich richer through your labor).  You're honest (you're not a threat to 
take the rich people's property.  They like you to be honest, but are the 
rich people honest?).  And lastly, you don't expect instant gratification 
(no, or few rewards for your labor).  It's hilarious for me to see you 
middle-classed people defending your middle-classed values when those very 
values are the mechanism by which you are exploited.  And what's funniest 
of all is that you don't even think you're being exploited.  You're happy 
to be a lackey for people who are enjoying the fruits of our society.

It is true that your programming will help you to survive.  As long as you 
work hard, are honest, and don't expect rewards for your labor (as long as 
you do what the rich people want) then they'll allow you to live.  They'll 
give you a job making middle-classed wages, and they'll let you think that 
you're happy collecting the products of capitalism (cars, houses in the 
suburbs, computers, TVs, etc.).  What you may want to ask yourself is 
this:  What have I lost in buying into this system?  While I lived the 
comfortable middle-classed life, how many people suffered in poverty as a 
result?  What have I really done by advocating the injustices of the 
status quo?  Couldn't I have done something else?  Couldn't I have made 
the world a better place?

Just a thought ...

Firstly, yes I was pretty irritated.  Fortunately, it had nothing to do 
with being hit hard.  I simply get infuriated when I have to repeat myself 
over and over and over (as it seems you do too ;-)

Secondly, you stated that I'm "not pretending not to be a servant of the 
rich".  Funny, I seem to remember stating explicitly that I wasn't a 
servant of anyone but myself.  Laelth seems to put forth the attitude that 
anything which doesn't challenge the system is giving into it.  Amazingly, 
I believe it's possible to accept something, not because I was told it was 
good, but simply because I agree with it.  No doubt, Laelth will attempt 
to blame this on my "programming".  Here's a completely novel concept:  
Because something is accepted as right by the majority of the population, 
it does not make it necessarily wrong.  Laelth seems to still harbor that 
deeply imbedded resentment for anything established which any 15 year-old 
exhibits.

Thinking of the government as this omnipotent machine bent on absolute 
control is a divorce from reality.  You have no say?  The rich control 
everything?  Let me ask you something.  Did you vote?  Did your candidate 
get elected?  I bet he did.  Is he instituting these reforms you've been 
talking about the liberals presenting?  Imagine that!

I wonder how the rich could have let him get in government?  Surely the 
poor masses couldn't have elected him.  They're pawns under the control of 
big business.  I wonder why Trump didn't have the CIA gun him down?  
Surely, they control the military as well.  Well, no doubt he won't get to 
do anything with health care since it isn't in the best interests of big 
business.  What?  His bills are passing?  My God, I better get to the Bat 
phone and call the Rich Society for Totalitarian Government to speak to my 
local master and inform him of this.  We'll sacrifice him on the great, 
satanic capitalist alter to be sure!

Come on, stop kidding people.  There's no oppression of the lower classes. 
 Sure, not everybody's in the same economic situation, but that's just 
luck of birth.  Fortunately, it's a fixable problem.  There's no caste 
system in effect.  

By the way, big mistake comparing US ideals to Nazi Germany.  Shouldn't 
bring up the Jews.  The Jews came over poor imigrants just like the rest 
in the second wave of immigration.Fortunately for them though, they came 
with the same ideals you say will get a person nowhere here.  They're 
honest, hard-working and patient.  Thre rich welcomed them.  Are they the 
middle class servants you speak of?  Hardly, their hard work and 
determination paid off as I said it would.  They have a higher average 
income than white, Western European Americans.  Now, how do you suppose 
that happened.  They must have caught the Secret Society of Evil 
Capitalist Swine off guard as well.

Once again, I claim that Laelth's hedonistic ideals are self-serving 
principles designed to acquire wealth and comfort without earning.  We 
should hardly be suprised though, as he clearly has stated he is not 
familiar with the concept of "deserving" or "working for something".

Actually, much hatred has been directed at Jews in all cultures because 
they have NOT been lazy, etc.and have generally been more successful than 
the natives.  You are right, though, that Hitler (and others) painted the

Anarchist?  I'd hardly associate such narrow-minded, fundamentalist 
propaganda with anarchism.  Propaganda?  Well, that's generally what you  
call a blatant attack upon certain people for their beliefs, color or 
religious background.  Specifically, when this attack is made without ONE 
SHRED of supporting evidence.  It's a free country, so feel free to speak 
your mind.  Just remember to turn it on before you start typing.  Let's 
look at your allegations.

1.  "I have nothing against gays".  Bullshit.  You're a raving homophobe 
if I've ever seen one.  "When all else fails scream the loudest that 
you're just like the kid next door".  Tell me, what kind of anarchist 
feels a need for others to justify their lifestyles.  "Hundreds of 
diseases that afflict gays"?  I'm sorry, in my ignorance I can't quite 
remember which disease it was that heterosexuals are immune to which gays 
aren't.  Please enlighten us.  "All of this doesn't represent a threat to 
us as long as it stays on the seedy side of town".  Did you ever think 
that maybe if everyone had given a fuck when it was restricted to the 
seedy side of town that maybe we could have kept the virus under control.  
Did you think it was a plague from God maybe?  That it would spare 
straight little protestant white boys?  "We", whoever you put in that 
category, have earned this one.  Reap it.

2.  As for Farakhan, not much to say.  Hate groups are hate groups.  Put 
'em in a field and let 'em kill eack other so the rest of us can go on 
living.

3.  Not that I have any great love for Democrats, but Duke a Democrat?  
Can you really picture any of those tree-hugging, get back to the earth, 
liberals running around in a pointed cap burning crosses?  Get real.  I 
can't even picture it without dying of laughter.  No, Duke was
 a gone astray. (This isn't uncommon, by the way. ;-)

4.  "I don't think government can solve any problems, it just supplies a 
structure for us to live in".  Huh?  It can't?  It does?  Man, you're 
arguing with yourself.  You don't consider organizing a structure for a 
tens of millions of people a problem.  Can you do it?  I sure as hell 
can't.

I agree with your last post.  arachnoi could use a little schooling in the 
true history of the groups he mentions.

I do not know the exact origin of the AIDS virus.  But a lokk at the 
statistics show that it is fast becoming a leading killer of HETEROSEXUALS 
in the western world.  Also, AIDS deaths in the gay community is on the 
decline over the past few years.   As for the "hundreds" of other venereal 
diseases, exactly which ones does arachnoi attribute to the gay/lesbian 
community?  I do not see myself as a supporter of the gay rights movement, 
but I do believe in not fooling myself.

Farrakhan and Duke belong to the same group.  They are after the same 
things for their respective groups.  Given the chance, either one would 
put a bullet in ANYONE who would dare to disagree with them.

Just what does arachnoi want ?  If you can come up with a definition,

"we LIVE in a world of propaganda.  Learn to swim."

We do.  By not buying the mindless drivel in the first place.  It's 
everywhere?  So are fools who think it has substance or meaning.

"You don't talk about it (self rule), you do it.  Learn to walk."

There's been many fools throughout history who ruled without council.  
Talk first.  There's plenty of time for action.

"If the propaganda was luxurious too you, and it made you fel good, YOU
would believe it."

Unfortunately, a lot of people take that opinion.  That's what makes it so 
damned effective.  I wouldn't recommend it though, it doesn't pan out well 
in the end.  Ever notice that the people who believe the crap end up 
getting there asses bitten off.  Italy (pre-WWII) claimed to have the 
largest, most powerful navy in Europe.  Funny, it didn't stop anyone from 
sinking their whole fleet in under two months without a single casualty.  
Divorce yourself from reality and your setting your ass up.

Re: Propaganda,   the sad truth, and note that I do not seek to promote 
this state of affairs, is that we entertain ourselves to death.  That is 
what I meant to imply withthe learn to swim line.  THat you have to accept 
that there is this whole world of propaganda, and you have toswim in it 
and operate in it to the best of your ability.


Re: Talking too much
this whole thing is actually funny.  Talk is cheap.  Now granted one 
should not just go off and start reaking havoc, unless it's a particulalry 
bad monday, but I'm often amused at the amount of "Yeah, Yeah let's do it" 
and tha lack of "doing it".  Now fo rhtose of you who frequent various 
newsgroups, you may recognize this as the standard "(insert movement here) 
is DEAD" attack.  often perpetrated by those who are relatively new to
newsgroup or forum or even movement, and don't realize that things are 
getting done out there.  NOW, my statement about Talk meaning nothing and 
walking bieng something,is a twist on that.  I personally have no idea if 
you guys actually do anything, but from the looks of this forum, oft times 
it seems that discussions never really go anywhere, but often degenerate 
into pissing contests.  That's all the talk thing was meant to say, that 
you shouldn't talk, but do.  Of course doing can include planning.


Re: believeing propaganda.  You read my statemetn as if I was saying that 
believeing stuff because it sounds good is a viable option.  NO, i did not 
mean that, and anyone who knows me, which you don't yet(but no prob), will 
know that I am actually quite the opposite of that.  Once again, I was 
statingthe current statues, nt advocating it.  Today we are to busy 
watching Tonya and Nancy stories to worry about anything.  We fall for the 
sappiest stories cooked up by our govt, we pander to nationalism evn when 
it leads us to killing 50,000 young men, we succumb to propaganda from the 
govt telling us that we are always the good guys. etc........  Sorrta like 
the good example you pointed out about Italy.

all in all, the purpose of the original statement was to simply try and 
stiop the oft times stupid bickering over pettiness and the pissing 
contests.

re:  talk

1.  [You're a raving homophobe. {I love this word.  It's such a 
meaningless euphemism.}

- Well, what an added bonus.  We get your views on modern sociology and 
psychology to boot.  I suppose all psychology is meaningless, or is it 
just the parts you don't like to hear.  Does it disturb you that a 
professional science has a category for you which is listed as an 
abnormality.  Be nicer to the democrats, they have good programs for the 
specially challenged.  I won't bother citing the truth for my accusation, 
it's already been presented in a previous post.  Since you didn't 
challenge the accusation, but instead made a rather poor attempt at 
discrediting and sidestepping it, I see no reason to expand upon it.

2.  {You got a cure for a virus, any virus?}

- Oops, I think I was talking to fast.  Let me repeat myself for those who 
didn't seem to understand the last post.  If more people would have careed 
what happened to the "seedy side" (Christ, talk about over worked 
cliches), then we could have got an earlier start on controling and 
researching the disease (that's AIDS, in case I lost you again).  The 
whole point, if you could gather it, is that we DON'T have a cure.  We 
might have, if we had started worrying about it earlier.  BTW, I'm a 
chemical genetics major, and as such I follow my fields research closely.  
The best bet for destroying the AIDS virus lies with genetic 
mainipulation/designing.  Applicable research is being carried out with 
marked success in Isreal.  It is not being carried out in the US.  I 
attribute this mainly to the kind of idiocy you propogate with your 
out-modded, false image of AIDS victims.

3.  {Were you planning on locking them all up like the cubans?}

- This seems to be a false alternative falacy.  Where'd you get such a 
monumentously stupid idea.  This isn't worth a full respoonse.

4.  { Democratic party is a collection of every whacked-out fascist

group in the country.}

- My God, and we're still here under a democracy after all this time.  
You forgot to call them the most ineffective fascists.  Whew, thank God 
they haven't got their shit toghether yet.

A random sample:

- My God, and we're still here under a democracy {Wrong, we be a
Republic, check your civics."

Are you really ignorant enough or narcissistic enough to think the exavct 
name of our political system is something we're ignorant too.

You've shown that you have a decent vocabulary and a propensity for 
assigning literature.  Unfortunately, you've also shown a vacuous ability 
for reasoning.  I'm not really sure whether you've intentionally avoided 
questions proposed to you, or whether you're just to busy talking to have 
time to think.

In the last post you make a comment proposing a relationship between AIDS 
research and the Human Genome project.  Great, sounds interesting.  
Where's the evidence.  No doubt the answer is some assigned reading.  

I'll let you in on a free lesson in debate and logic.  If you propose a 
premise, guess who the burden of proof lies on?  You guessed it.  Without 
proof it's just babble.  I don't mind being wrong, but someone else will 
have to do the homework and give the report.  Without a shred of proof, 
we've just got someone who's filled up about five posts with idiotic 
blatherring, written by someone who seems to consider himself quite 
clever.  Well, at least one person does.

If you can't handle an intelligent response, don't bother writing me.  I 
won't bother with it.  There are people who work for their opinions here 
who far more deserve the feedback.  If I need this kind of babbling, I'll

Come on. Quit the silly game. I know that you are just someone trying to 
fire up the people in this base with a bunch of fascist bullshit that you 
don't even wholeheartedly subscribe to at all. You even had me going for a 
little while, but you're too good ot be true. Someone this ignorant, yet 
this vocal, on our board--well, that's a wet dream. Surely this is a 
farce. 
   Now, I do appreciate your concern for wanting to liven things up in 
this base, but come on--Fasscist democrats? orwellian democrats? Yes the 
democratic party is a splintered group, but I don't think that it has 
all the people you mentioned, and I don;'t think that they are a fascist 
group
Would you call the following fascisit: the equal rights ammendment, the 
motor voter bill, downsizing the armed forces? Which one of thes ideas do 
youthink that NIetzsche, Mussolini, or Hitler would not vomit on. Well, 
they're all ont the liberal agenda, and supported by many 
democrats--though not all. 
    So here's two ideas for this board--one serious, one witty. let's 
chang ethe name of the board--face it, we hardly ever talk about 
anarchy(When I said board, i mean this message base). Secondly, let's 
require that everyone who wishes to post in this base has at least read a 
book once, or taken at least high school poli. sci. that oughtta take care

|||||||||||||

Every single group could be categorized under your headings.

"legitimise itself"
This is something all special interest (and broad interest) groups try to 
do.  An illegitimate group carries no power, so it is only natural for a 
group of people to desire legitimacy in their operations.
This also leads directly into...

"impose it's cause on others through government intervention"
This is pretty much the only way to become legitimate.  How else can a 
group become legitimate than to have the government officially recognize 
the cause/people through legislation.  The problem with this is when you 
have to decide if the group is trying to impose its cause on others, or if 
the group only wants to be free of the caused imposed on it by others.
This goes right to...

"seek special priviledges"
Now, how do you define what is a privilege and what is a right?  Where is 
the boundary?  To bring up the easy case of gays, do they have the right 
to marry or join the military?  Other people (straight) do have that 
right.  Now, I think arachnoi might say something about them being disease 
spreaders, and if that's true, then why does our government allow retarded 
people to marry?  They might be looked at as spreading disease (faulty 
genes).  Basically, a lot of people think that if some people are allowed 
to do what they want, then it will reduce their own expression of their 
rights.  I don't know where the boundary is, or exactly how to find it, 
but I'm kind of partial to minority groups, whatever they might be.
I'm not, however, the one who decides these things (unfortunately).

So, to add things to the list:
The Republican Party
The Democratic Party
etc, etc.

Sorry for not getting back to you earlier but I have not been near a 
terminal in a few days and I am just now catching up on the recent posts.  
Would mind giving me the EXACT issue of the JAMA that you got you 
statistics from ?  I would be interested in finding and using these 
statistics in the next class I teach to Police Officers.  Maybe that will 
calm their fears of AIDS and they won't have to wear rubber gloves any 
more, like the Doctors have advised.

Had you read my post a little closer, you would have seen that I did NOT 
say that AIDS was THE leading killers.  I stated that AIDS was BECOMING 
ONE of the leading killers.  (important difference there !)  If you are 
going to argue a point, please spend some time to notice subtle 
differences.  It changes the meaning of passages.  Quoting out of context 
is not a very good habit to get into !

I also see that you have chosen to ignore my other statement.  This is the 
one concerning David Duke and Louis Farrakhan being of the same stripe.  
(I can change the wording because I made the original assertion !)
You need to really pay attention to what is going on around you.  As I 
stated earlier, Duke, Farrakhan, Kahane, et al are all of the same breed.  
"Disagree with me at your peril."  I would put them in the same boat as 
Nazis and Communists.  All are extremists and would "liquidate", "purge", 
or whatever euphemism you care to use in order to silence the opposition.  
The situation in Hebron is exactly what I am talking about.  "You do not 
ascribe to my beliefs, so you have no right to live."  That is the same 
thing as saying "stupid people should not be allowed to breed !  Where 
will it all end ?  Atilla the Hun tried it, Napoleon tried it, Hitler 
tried it, just to name a few.  There is no end to the madness.

I hope I have answered some of your questions.  Please let me know if I 
may be of service to you in the future.

I think it's kind of unfair of you to say: "I would put them in the same 
boat as Nazis and Communists."  Communism is not all bad!  It's just that 
we've become so conditioned to a consumer based society that ownership now 
means everything to us, and the idea that we might all work together, 
sacrificing some of our own wants, is appalling.

We should also make a distinction between theoretical and practical 
communists.  Practical communists would be the ones you don't quite like.  
These are the people who held power in most of the communist countries 
we've seen.  They are not especially nice people, but that doesn't 
necessarily make communism bad.

The theoretical communists are harder to find.  The example I like to use 
is that of the Israeli kibbutz.  These are miniature communist societies, 
and they work fairly well, though there are still a few bugs in that 
system.

All I want to say is not to condemn any movement based on its practical 
expression (unless, as in things like Nazism, the practical
 directly follows the theoretical).

I would agree with you to a certain extent.  I wouldn't necessarily 
consider communism "bad".  This carries a conotation that communists as a 
group actively seek to do "evil".  From what I've studied of communism, 
it's foundation principles are an attempt to do "good".

However, I feel that while it's not bad, it's certainly disfunctional.  If 
the Soviet Union is a representation of the effectiveness of a communist 
society, it would seem that it was a terrible failure.  In a society, it 
would seem dangerous whenever incentives are removed.

My dear friend Ching, and other readers:
    I've been off the board again, this time re-reading Aristotle and 
Plato, with a little Henry Louis Gates on the side.  I too have been 
disturbed/bored by the current flame war between arachnoi and all takers.  
I must, however, interrupt my silence for a point of clarification.  I 
don't normally get upset about this sort of thing, and I'm not really 
upset now, but I feel compelled to argue that Nietzsche was not, nor ever 
wanted to be, or even could have been a nazi or a fascist.  It is true 
that his works were appropriated by fascism as some kind of moral 
justification for vile behavior.  However, this resulted from intentional 
"misreadings" of Nietzsche by the other people you cite (Hitler 
Moussolini).  Nietzsche, himself, was a pacifist, a leftist.  His works 
are very popular with leftist intellectuals.  His philosophy is 
liberating, kind-of "live and let live."  From my reading of Nietzsche, I 
find it hard to imagine that he would have condoned National Socialism as 
it was practiced (perverted) by Hitler.

Ah, here's something to talk about: special privileges.
arachnoi said:
ERA. Without even getting into the faults of the ERA, its an attempt to 
provide special privileges not available to everyone else. .

Now, does this really amount to special privileges?  Last I heard women 
generally made 80 cents for every dollar men made in the workforce.  
Actually, in every study I've heard, women make less than men.  Wouldn't 
the ERA clear up that problem?  Is it a special privilege to make as much 
as the other half of the population?  Or do you deny the reports, etc. 
because they don't conform to your levels of reliability (the reports were 
done by democrats, whatever, etc.) ?

I hate to to  bother you in the middle of a good arguemnet, but I have to 
make one small correction; your conception oif communism is a bit off--but 
it's still a lot closer to correct than most other americans ever get. You 
see, the communists that were in power are not necessarily 
non--theoretical; as a matter of fact, they were really supposed to be 
very theoretically communist, according to Marx. Marx recognized tha t 
people couldn't go straight to the communist utopia right after the 
uprising of the proliteriate. Thus he came up with something called the 
:dictatorship of the proliterate" in order to make the transformation from 
capitalism to communism possible. Marx himslef advocated putting
 an authoritarian government in power until it  was no longer needed to 
keeep order in the world. 
    About the big division in the communist party is over whethter or not 
the entire world should be revolutionized, or if those countries that have 
turned to communism should concentrate only on their own area.

As you may well be aware, most Marxists do not consider the Soviet Union 
to have been a Communist society. They see the Revolution betrayed (as did 
Trotsky and that's why he got a pick axe in the head) and the State become 
a State Capitalist, the ownership of the means of production being in the 
hands of a ruling elite. Marxist-Leninist theory was quite different from 
Marx's original, Marx saying that the revolution was most likely to 
succeed in an advanced industrial nation (such as Britain and Germany) not 
in a pre-industrial one with a minority proletariat. In fact, a lot of his 
analysis was quite useful but his predictions off the mark.

Despite not being a Marxist myself, it still irritates to see the collapse 
of the Soviet bloc held up to demonstrate how "Communism" doesn't work: It 
wasn't tried!

As for comparing the Democrats to Duke, Farrakhan, and Kahane, where did

problem that comes along.  Duke wanted to dis-enfranchise blacks.  
Farrakhan wants to dis-enfranchise Jews and whites.  Kahane wanted to 
"liquidate" any and all Arabs.  Democrats ?  Try looking at a political 
spectrum sometime !  These beliefs belong to fascist organizations.  The 
Democrats fully support the pluralistic society that are diametrically 
opposed to those of the groups and individuals you mention.

As mentioned above, and in other posts, why don't you get a clue ?  In an

Unfortunately, Democratic nations never concern themselves with this 
question.  We (the US, at least) believes that everyone NEEDS democracy, 
and that anyone who wants to run under something else are political 
heathens.  In many cases we're no better than Catholic missionaries, 
invading "primitive" countries and introducing them to our "modern" way of

This is not to say that democracy is the worst form of government, and 
that we need to try something else.  Actually, I think it is probably the

everyone.

OK a quicky...

Utopias have never been tried so therefore cannot have worked.. most 
utopist writers spouted rubbish anyway about ideally organised societies, 
which after analysis were worse than the one they were supposed to 
replace. 

Communism could exist but not within the context of the current dominant 
global ideology (I sound like a lecturer now):ie not in a bubble as the 
outside would always seep in through media etc. This is why communes tend 
to disintegrate after a generation at the most.

Wholesale changes in "values" would have to occur ie non-aquisative, even 
altruistic tendencies employed on a societal scale. (I probably made that 
word up but never mind).

something may happen... but not yet..

Well, when talking about Utopias as bieng a goal for a society youhave to 
ask some really important questions.

1. WHO'S Utopia are we gonna head for?  Your utopia may be my living hell, 
my utopia could be Nazi Germany to you.  The majorities utopia could be 
the erradication of the minority, the minorities utopia could be the 
overthrow of the majority.  You cannot really aim for a global, national, 
statewide, or even local, and IMO not even a household utopia in any real 
sense because just about anything involving more than one person leads to 
conflicts, granted some are minor in some cases, but s you increase in 
scale you get more and more discrepencies.
    Aldous Huxley's _Brave New World_ depicts a great utopia too some 
poeple, but to freedom loving individualists or humans(as the story in 
some ways psays) do not function well in a strictly classes hiearchal 
society.  And the soma can only be so strong.  As soon as you decide which 
utopia your globe, or nation or state is going to shoot for you are 
disenfranchising another person from their utopia.  Utopias IMO are a 
personal idea of a societal structure.  The key is that it is personal 
trying to control societal, which usually bumbles upn a few bazillion 
individual rights of those not in agreement.  Remember that the Nazi's 
were headed for a utopia, of course a jewish person at the time would have 
disagreed quite a bit with it.  What makes your utopia different from the 
Nazi one?


2.  Where do you draw the line betwen shooting for, and shooting at( as in 
dissedents)?  How far are you willing to go to enforce a utopia?  My 
answer personally is only as far as it effects noone bnut me.  IMO you can 
only create a personal utopia, which defeats this discussion in some ways, 
but then again, the originbal post never made any requirments for the 
utopias.

1.  I think that, although good and evil are subjective, a government has 
to take some sort of stand and decide on certain absolutes to use.  Once 
the absolutes have been decided (hopefully through some fair process), the 
goal of the utopia becomes clrified a bit.  Unfortunately, this leaves out 
or destroys other people's visions of the utopia.
I think that what politics is is arguing over whose definitions of good 
and evil are correct.  When one side has power, it pushes the development 
of the country in that direction a little.  Then when another group holds 
power, the country moves towards that a little.  What we end up with is a 
cluster of semi-conflicting utopian collectives, none of which work 
together especially well, but which make the people involved in them quite 
happy.  At least, that's where we are right now.  I don't know how things 
will go in the future.

2.  Utopias should not be enforced, except to keep general order (violent 
crime should be controlled, for example).  Above all, nothing should be 
enforced against dissenters, since a good utopia should have processes 
extant to allow and to deal with dissent.  If a utopia cannot stand the 
power of dissent without becoming fearful, it is not a utopia at all.

As for comparing the Democrats to Duke, Farrakhan, and Kahane,
where did that come from{go back and try reading the posts}.  The
Democrats are well known to throw money at any problem that comes
along{or buying their way into the hearts of their constituants}. 
Duke wanted to dis-enfranchise blacks.   Farrakhan wants to dis-
enfranchise Jews and whites.  Kahane wanted to  "liquidate" any and
all Arabs.  Democrats ?{YES, EVERY MOTHER'S SON OF THEM}  Try
looking at a political  spectrum sometime !{I did, they are or were

belong to fascist organizations{EXACTLY!!!!}.  The  Democrats fully
support the pluralistic society{WRONG! Ask the Rainbow coallition

communism the way Marx intended, and that they were more socialist/facist?

I'm not sure if I can agree with this statement.  It seems to cut 
resources a bit short.  Yes, we use oil for just about all our energy 
needs.  This is mainly due to the fact that we've already done the R&D for 
it though.  There are plenty of alternative energy resources we haven't 
begun to tap.  Personally, I wish the damned oil would run out.  It'd 
force the US to pay for the R&D and the conversions necessary
for implementing new resource technologies.

The US Federal govt. CAN'T control the internet.  While it may be 
powerful, the internet is worldwide.  Many of those sites are owned by 
private companies and foreign governments.  If the US attempts to control 
and oversee their protion of the internet it'll make a lot of
 otheres uneasy.  If they get uneasy and sever internet ties with the US 
than most every company who owns a politician will be jumping down

in the course of western philosophy it has been hotly debated as to

Locke, and Mill didn't think it was possible, and they have a plethora of 
arguments as to why they think it wouldn't work.  i won't hash those 
arguments up here, but you should take a look at Plato's Republic, 
Aristotle's Politics and especially Tomas Hobbes' Leviathan. perhaps you 
could then make a convincing case for anarchy since you assert that it

you said:
"how is a supermarket directly dependent upon oil for the prices of food?
"


Well, I can think of a number of things which make supermarkets dependent 
on oil, and a more expensive oil would be reflected in the price of the 
food it sells.  For example, all the plastic packaging which the 
supermarket uses (not even the packaging for processed food) for bagging, 
for meat packaging, for bakery packaging, for milk bottles, etc etc.  Then 
there are the costs of running open refrigerators which hold frozen and 
refrigerated goods...that consumes massive amounts of energy, which is 
directly related to the cost of oil.  If the price were to increase, in 
order to make the All-Godly profit the sprmkt. would without a doubt raise 
food prices in concert.

Let me know if this seems too far-fetched, but I think that is why.

oh contrare! It's been about a year since I read 1984--maybe longer, but 
there are two events that I can think of right off the bat. first , in the 
 book that winston is given--it's by goldstein, right?--there is a 
complete explanation of how Oceania works. One of the pillars of this 
society, it says, is the extreme provinciality. there is no communications 
between Oceania, eastasia, and  Eurasia--not for the lower and middle 
class, at least--and the status quo is kept by the constant state of war 
between them. And as we all know war brings racism, and patriotism--now if 
youdon't agree with the term racism, then let's just say hate.  the 
goldstein book even says something directly about racial hate--and when I 
say racial, I mainly mean between citizens of the different nations. 
    The other instance is much more subtle. During Hate Week--or maybe 
just before--the  government has a public hanging of some of the enemy's 
soldiers. The soldiers receive jeers and slurrs from the hateful crowd. 
Why? because they are the enemy. Why are they the enemy? because they are 
different.

I have read the book many times, and I still believe that the book makes 
no reference to racism.  Hatred, yes.  Racism, no.  You can interprete 
scenes of hatred as racism, but then again anybody can claim hatred is 
manifested in other means, such as hatred of different sexxual 
preferences, or religion (as the bookk mentioned, Goldstein was remarked 
as having a "Jewish" facial characteristics, as if his relgion was 
something to be defiled).  Hatred shows itself in many forms in 1984, but 
I do not be,lieve that racism is one of those forms.

But not to nit-pick your main point, which was that hatred is one 
mechanism for the preservation of totalitarian State.  Which I agree with.

I think you're right.  If you want an example of a distopian story that 
covers class, race, politics, and class, try Margaret Atwood's The 
Handmaid's Tale.  To me, that view of the future is thousands of times 
more likely to occur than 1984.  Also, Somebody Zamyatin, a russian, wrote 
a book called We that described a future society based entirely on 
mathematics.  The Handmaid's Tale seemed the most dangerous and immediate

do we decide upon projects that forces the people of a geographic area to 
cooperate? (dams, power plant, bridges, roads,etc.) many of these projects 
incorporate funds and manpower from a rather large geographical area, but 
in an anarchist system, one wqould have no obligation to support such 
projects.  how would you propose to 
"get things done?"

now, anarchy is based upon the principle that people are capable of, and 
have the right to decide what is best for themselves, or their own 
interest (tell me where does these "right" come from, can you give an 
argument?). now in  a anarchist society, who in the hell is going to 
settle disputes between two people's best interests??? no government, no 
judges to decide!  For example, say a road must be built from one city to 
another for some reason or another. say i do not want that road to cross 
my property.  noone can force me to give up my land, yet in the interests 
of all people, the road would be a god send. who's interests are greater 
and who can decide that? noone, so how can society progress?


i'd really love to know where any kind of 'right' that a person has, comes 
from...    any takers???

    Depends what you consider progress to be...

    If you think having a highway run though your yard is progress, if you 
think having heavy-metal and radioactive waste in your backyard is 
progress, then by all means have an authoritarian govt. slapping you 
around to tell you what to do...

    Progress doesn't neccessarily mean more of xyz (industry, roads, 
consumer goods) at least in my honest opinion.  Read Peter's Principle and 
you'll see what progress means in today's society...

Only one problem with the concept of everyone being capable of destroying

that We're all rational beings who would use the device simply as a

Sounds extremely fascist.  Not that I mind though, I'm a fascist myself.  
However, it doesn't seem to be an anarchistic setup.  But hell the grounds 
between the two often gets shaky.  If you act against someone who seeks a 
conflicting goal from your own, then it's anarchistic many times.  
However, if you act against that person with some other, like-minded 
individuals then it appears to become fascism.  But to the point, it 
doesn't seem like pure anarchy.  It seems more like resting the power from 
the present holders and turning it over to a regime of technocrats with 
equal authority amongst themselves.  It kind of reminds me of the old 
Soviet party regime (although, admittedly, they didn't have near as much 
power to destroy arbitrarily without the rest of the party's consent).

As far as an elite force to weed out the unfit...God, I don't know whether 
to applaud or cringe.  There's nothing I'd like better than to be able to 
weed out a lot of dead weight from the planet.  Unfortunately, I wouldn't 
trust anyone but myself to decide who's to be removed (yes, I'm 
egotistical enough to think my decisions would be best, after all I am a 
fascist :-)But how could we decide who's to decide who needs to be 
removed?  I think part of the problem is that any such action brings up 
less than fond memories of the holocaust.  Of course, killing isn't really 
necessary.  Plato thought anyone who's not productive should just be 
"kicked over the city wall".  I guess I just don't see how anyone could 
implement such a program in the name of 'good'.  Granted, it doesn't need 
to be implemented for any moral objective, but I don't think most people 
would support it without at least the illusion of morality as a driving 
factor.

Um, I said natural AND constitutional rights.  You can put down the first 
as unenforcable, but the second stands.  Now, answer the question I asked, 
please.  Is your distaste for the people you suggest utterly unbiased, or 
do you have preconceived feelings about certain groups that cause you to 
cast off their desires as "special privileges"?

Oh, I do like your example, though.  I would agree that the funding of 
their school is probably unconsitutional.  But, it is unfair to just say 
that since they want the school for Hasidic kids, then it must be a 
special privilege.  Are all these kids from the same area of the city?  If 
so, aren't the parents' tax dollars paying for public schools that their 
kids either aren't going to or aren't getting the help they need at?  If 
it comes down to a decision where they've chosen to build a new school (or 
program) because the other facilities happen to be inadequate (I'm talking 
about physical, not religious care here), then the school might stand as 
a "right" or lawful and constituional.  If, though, there are other 
schools that could just as easily take care of the kids, then the school 
is probably illegal.  If the reality lies somewhere between these two, the 
judges get to decide, not us.

How are white men excluded from being hired at the FBI?  I hope you've 
chosen your word "exclude" carefully...

I am familiar with the story regarding the school and the Hasidic Jews.  
To the best of my knowledge, the entire township is made up of Hasidic 
Jews.  They wanted a school for their retarded children that was in line 
with their beliefs.  The news media focused on that aspect the story.

As for the discrimination against white males in the F.B.I., I am afraid I

There was a short story by either Arthur C. Clarke or Heinlein that talked 
about a society like this.  It concerns a young man who has somehow defied

Discussing anarchy brings up all sorts of sub-topics, and if you can't

swithc rayguns with internett
 
think about it, many to many global communications at a very low cost 
relativly speaking that is.


every computer is a printing press


every computer is a publisher


the many are the media, no longer monopolized by the few and powerful 
MEDIAGODS


only prob is, getting as many people as possible acces to it


cant rememebr who said it but
"when everyman can read, and the press is truly free, than man is safe"  
or some variation thereof.

Actually, it doesn't.  In such situations people end up not caring whether

believe that no one will retaliate against them for some murder.  No, it's 
expected that you'll be killed in a horrible, sad way.  Have gang wars

already possess several rights.  Those documents just try to list them all

Anyway, the main idea in US gov't is that the rights existed before the

If u can't see the special privileges, I'll list them
1) A school sperate from the ones the school district
provides for everyone else, especially other races, using
funds that would normally help all the children.
2) A school that excludes all but Hasidic jewish children
3) A publicly supported school that has a religious
curriculum, where other schools can't even have a prayer
in class, and administrators have a fit when the students
talk about having a Bible Club.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
First off, I said that I did think the school was unconstitutional.  I 
just wanted to look at arguments from the other side.
I see your point, but I guess I was thinking that everyone in the district 
was Hasidic.  Oh!  On point 2), are Hasidic kids excluded?  Have any 
nonHasidim tried sending their kids there?  That would be an interesting 
thing to look at before making a decision.  If there's a Hasidic 
curriculum, and non-Hasidim want their kids to follow it, will they be 
shut out?
Actually, point 3) is the one I most oppose.  Teaching of religion 
anywhere outside of family life is absolutely unconstitutional in my view 
(except in colleges, etc. Don't be picky).  People just seem to forget 
about that separation of church and state sometimes.  It's really too bad.

Wait, maybe I should retract my unconditional condemnation of religion.  
It might be okay to discuss religion in various world history classes.  I 
just mean that I don't want religion taught TO kids.  That's it.

In defense of Arachnoi's position, this doesn't necessarily mean that 
rights are real.  The govt. has asserted that people have certain 
inaliable rights.  However, this assertion is based largely on assumption. 
 The main assumption being that the people who drafted the Constitution 
weren't expecting the people to question this assumption as it wasn't in 
their best interest.  The only way to back up this claim is through the 
use of religious doctrine.  It cannot be proved conclusively that there is 
such a thing as good, evil, or inherent rights through argument.  These 
concepts are seen to vary too much from culture to culture.  There very 
nature is relative and therefor impossible to define in only a single 
term.  Through religion, it can be argued that the supreme law (or law of 
God) has set forth the exact definition of good and evil and has set down 
what rights everyone is entitled too.  Unfortunately (or maybe not), there 
is supposedly a distinction and seperation between church and state, so 
this argument cannot be brought to bear.  Without the support of religious 
"evidence", these inaliable rights are merely arbitrary assumptions of a 
governing body which contain no truth or validity outside of that 
governments existence.

rights:  IMo it doesnt matter anymore wether these rights are god given, 
or provided by the govt etc..  Since apparantly the govt has decided that 
it doesnt need to abide these rights anymore.  It just takes them away and 
calls it protection.

etc..  give good arguments please, otherwise when you have to defend it 
against those who support it you'll be up shit creek with only an unformed 
hatred to use.


MAD:  By the time we reach that point, there will be little civilization 
to speak of, at least in any form recognizable to us.  Even then 
civilization is only a human construct.  Sure we have superpowers now that 
could blow us all to bits, but when you have individuals with the 
capability it wont take long befroe something nasty happens.  Big forces 
lke US/USSR and the other archtypal superpowers have checks and balances 
to better control these capabilities, but an unstable individual doesnt.

Sorry folks,
    I kinda suspected that arachnoi would respond poorly to
my half-jesting questions about his investment in this board.
I also tried to "head him off at the pass" by telling him that 
I wasn't interested in his answers to my questions.  He chose to
give us some answers anyway, but they weren't really answers, were
they?  Given his rather defensive replies, I'd guess that I hit him
a little too close to home.  Sincerest apologies for that, arachnoi.
Nothing personal, ;)

    Next point:  this board has gotten a little self-righteous, hasn't
it?  Why so much censorship?  Why so many people telling us what is
and what isn't appropriate?  Who are they to mandate what should and
should not be said?  Isn't this supposed to be some kind of "free"
forum of communication?  Just a thought ...

    Good point:  Ok, all the boring stuff aside (this is a statement of
personal preference, not a mandate about what you should or should
not do.  Please, feel free to bore me to tears, but I reserve the 
right to call you boring), the stuff about the ray gun is really
interesting.  Here's my two cents about the ultimate weapon.  Only the
powerful, entrenched entities (govenrments and big businesses, 
institutions with a strong investment in the status quo) have the 
resources to develop the really powerful weapons, and the new 
technologies.  Thus, any new weapon (if it's powerful) will be strictly
controlled by the govt. that produces it.  Take nukes, for example.  
The Oppenheimers of the world (technocrats) get the shaft while the
govt. that bankrolled their research gets the power and the control
over the weapon.  Who has F-16s?  The technocrats that designed them?
No, the govt. keeps control over weaponry very efficiently.  The same
will be the case for the ray gun. No matter who designs it, the govt.
will insure that it controls the weapons construction and distribution.
It's pointless, therefore, to discuss what people will do "when they get
the weapon," because they won't, at least not until "the powers that be"
have a better weapon.

In the spirit of free exchange,

P.S.  Think about it people.  Perhaps a flame every now and then is really

give too much of a shit if some 14 year old listens to me talk to my mom 
on the phone.  I do care if the person listening works for the FBI.  So, 
having all the keys available to the government completely defeats the 
purpose of encryption anyway.

A better thing to do is to have the private phone manufacturers hold all 
the keys, and only by a court order can the FBI get access to a particular 
key.  i understand that they sometimes need to listen in on people (Gotti,

I will never use a fone with a clipper chip in it. Hell, I don't use

is extremely unlikely that the government will be responsible with the 
keys to the phones. What happens when another Joe McCarthy comes along?
(Well, first I leave the country, but that's irrelevant.)

As it stands now, I trust no encryption. I don't even trust the algorithms 
I write. If it's really that important or "dangerous," I don't write it 
down. It stays in my brain, which to my knowledge, is the only place where 
it can not be eavesdropped on. If I *have* to tell someone (rare), it's 
face to face, *not* over the phone.

You were out of the thread for awhile, so let me update you a little
before any confusion sets in.  The premise behind the fictitious raygun
was that it would be a device which is easily and cheaply constructed out
of commonly available materials by anyone with the know how to put it

I think the risk is the same.  I've never noticed the herd mentality in such
situations.  In most of the articles and interviews I've read, it's some guy
saying, "Yeah, I've had three or four friends killed, and sooner or later,
it'll be me."  I don't really call that a herd mentality, just because the
conception of ties within the group are so loose.  If gangs were
well-organized, meaningful organizations, then the killings would be less
random and what you say would be true.  As it is, though, the death is still
random and meaningless, hence your plan would not work (as a side, was your
plan the technocrats watching and weeding bad people out, or were we
discussing the RAYGUN plan?  Either way, the idea doesn't work, as evidenced
by the gang warfare scenario).

O.K., to go over this point again, take arachnoi's example of the atomic 
bomb ... sure, the knowledge of how to build one is readily available, big 
deal!  You don't see people running around with 5MT briefcase bombs, do 
you?  No, of  course not.  As I said, and as is the case with any powerful 
weapon, the government contols its production and distribution (or 
governments and corporations do).  The same will happen for the ray gun.

Now, to head off acounter-argument that I know is coming.  The govt. and 
corporations have it easy controlling the A-bomb because uranium/plutonium 
are so hard to refine into fissionable material.  O.K., but if the 
materials for the ray gun were readily available (which I doubt will 
happen)  then the govt. would work overtime to suppress the knowledge.  
They'd even go so far as to assassinate the relevant university 
proferrors, graduate students, etc. who were involved in the project.  The 
CIA, I believe, would make it its #1 priority to contain  this knowledge, 
and I supect that they would be very successful at it.  In any case, the

I think, if all forms of anarchy relinquish control on the various crazies,
then none of them will work.  To retain some measure of control over people
who would kill, steal, rape, destroy, etc. for no reason would make the
anarchy not an anarchy (there would be government).  I don't think we can

Is that a herd behavior, though?  Gazelles generally don't take revenge on
the lions, and they don't really try to stay away from the danger.  Herds of
animals will graze somewhere, then run away when attacked.  That's kind of a
big difference from gang society.
Also, since the links between gang members seem so ephermeral (we live on
the same block, so lets be in the same gang) that the herd has no
consciousness of its situation.  There's just a knee-jerk reaction to any
perceived threat to the group.  It doesn't sound like some roaming herd to
me, I guess.

That's what I was saying!  It's a delusion to think that U might not be a
crazy, just hiding it.  Since you have all this power (a gun, a raygun,
whatever) you can go kill someone (or everyone) for no reason.  What stops a
group of people from becoming crazies and killing all "dangerous" people
with blond hair?  Wouldn't if they didn't come for you, but came for your
sister?  What if the crazies are thousands strong?  How do you feel if there
is no higher authority to prevent individual tragedies?  What I'm saying is
that Frontierism does not have to be fair, it can be just as wrong and
hurtful as any crime.  How many people's lives will be miserable under this
system?  What if the group of crazies prevents weapons from being
distributed to some area?  Iff you notice, this starts to become a
governmental system (though a very primitive one).  Basically, there's no
way that people live for long without forming posses, then enforcement
agencies, then lawmaking organizations.  Simply because someone is weak, or
does not wish to live in a violent world does not mean they should be
abused.
We should pretty much thank Bog that the US is at least slightly protective
of the "rights" of people who can't do it themselves.

That assumes you have some sort of authority.  If, as you say, you have this
weapon that can get rid of lots of crazies (which the crazies also have),
then your only protection is to kill everyone in the whole world!  The other
thing is that if they have a big enough group, your resistance makes it look

the crazies have the responsibility to get rid of you.

I think part of the lack of communication is a misnomer caused by the term
"herd mentality".  Herd mentality is something possessed by herbivores
(which we are not).  I think human reactions equate more closely to "pack
mentality".  An analogy would be that my girlfriend has this thing about
wanting a pig.  I personally interacted with a pig and found it to be a
rather pathetic animal.  It ran away, so I backed it in a corner.  The
damned thing just started to squeel  and roll its eyes.  Any carnivore
worth its weight would've torn my arm off for scaring the shit out of it
like that (yes I know wild boars are an exception, but it's just a $%#@ing
analogy :-)  

At any rate, while I still believe that there would be one genious
"technocrat" loony who would end it for us really quick, I don't believe
we'll fall prey to gangs kamikaziing.  Gangs are formed to make life
better for themselves in a world, they perceive, will not let them do it
legally.  They understand their survival rates, they're realist, but they
join toghether to lessen that rate.

Damn, I make a lot of claims.  Keep in mind (to be fair) that this is
personal conjecture, not fact.  However, I feel there is strong evidence
in support of this view.

But since you mentioned the comm. tech of the military, did you know that

tech suggests that IMO at least that what we use is not allthat far 
behind.  granted their are somethings we civilians can't do, like measure 
our computing power in acres like the NSA.
 
I have alonger reply to the idea of communication instead of a weapon for 
the RayGun, rational anarchy thing.

    AS I said before, as an individual it would do me little good, simply 
because of the nature of communications itself, it just don't work with 
only one person 8)...  But as a group it can be really powerful, 
particularly a many-to-many network like Inet.  For instance there are 
possibilities for everyone to become a publisher, writer, journalist etc.. 
 and to reach alot of people.  Jsut look at some of the abuses and see how 
many it touches when people flame the abuser.9Greencard, MMFast)
    So as a whole group communication can be IMO just as powerful as a 
weapon, and less threatening to the world(tho don't confuse me as some 
granola eater talking about the spirit of gaia ad nauseum...)  the problem 
is that the communication needs to reach alot of people, not just your 
little group, like your warez group, or your religious cult, etc.. but 
whole nation/states.  Imagine the power of the MEDIA monopolists.  they 
have most of America eating out of their hands.

So, if I knew they'd be after me?  I'd leave the country.  Fast as possible. 
If I was well known enough, I could survive for a while (look at Salman
Rushdie).  If not, I might still be able to get along.  There have been many
people in the past (and present) who've survived attempts to shut them up. 
People like Nelson Mandela, Rushdie... Can't think of any more just now.

I think, generally, that you can take two paths in your life: one where your
job/whatever consists of uncovering the criminality in the government, and
another that generally doesn't have much to do with politics.  My current
plans lean more towards the second choice.  It's not because I'm scared or
anything.  It's just that what I enjoy doing does not necessarily make me a
potential threat to the government.

What about you?  What would you do if the government wanted to put you down?

The thing is, I don't know what I'd do.  I'm just not too sure I'd have the
strength to resist the pressure to sell out.  I'm kinda thinking of the end
of 1984, and how I would react to that situation.

Of course I was assuming I knew they'd be after me.  If they came for me, I
would not resist arrest (well, that depends a bit).  I feel like I have to
have some measure of trust in our system (as shaky as it is) even though
that belief is illogical.  Unfortunately, I can't give up on some of my
idealism.  To do so would be to give up on my whole identity and my history
to date.  Can't do that.

It does make sense.  Are telephone sanitizers political agents?  There is a
difference between being a literary critic and being a writer of subversive
literature.

So, the answer to the threat of being discovered is to cultivate powerful
friends.  In the hacker world, you can't trust your friends, because most
people are kids.  In an academic world, the level of trust is much higher
because the stakes are not so high.  In a situation like that, about the
only danger is something like HUAC or the McCarthy hearings.  We can only
hope public witch hunts like those don't occur again (Waco doesn't count,
since the branch Davidians were not part of the mainstream).

Actually, I am pretty mainstream (although some people would argue about
that).  What I meant is that the Wacoans were not in the public eye until
the FBI went after them.  They had no friends outside their compound.  If
your life involves working with people and organizations around the country,
and if your work (whatever it may be, writing, film, music, politics) gets
some publicity, then it complicates the FBI's attempts to "get" you.
Think about Lyndon LaRouche, though.  He's a bit crazy, but the gov't got
him on legitimate charges and pout him away without killing him.  He's even
free now.  If he hadn't had as much exposure as he already did, they
could've tossed him in jail (or killed him) forever.
He's not necessarily a wonderful person, but he is an example of how the
system is not completely corrupt.

Now you're talking. let's eliminate the police force, give everyone a gun
and let order find itself instead of forcing a false order. Now i don't
have any criticism of police--they do their job well--but the waysin which
they are used bothers me. Without the governmetnt misusing the police,
personal liberties would be returned, criminals would face the angry mobs,
and law abiding citizens would not feel helpless towards the criminal
elements--i know in this state, if you shoot an assailant when your life
is not in danger(the criminal isn't shooting or stabbing at you or holding
his weapon in your face) you become a felon. who is the vict? who is the

The US system of govt. is NOT inherently corrupt.  It's an attempt at
creating a system in which the greatest amount of freedom is possible
while still maintaining social order.  Because of the flexibility and
freedom inherent in the system, it is, however, susceptible to abuse.  If
you experience any corruption, don't vent it towards the 'system' but the
people who've been VOTED into power to run it.  Sure, not all those people
were voted into positions of power.  However, the ones who weren't were
placed there by people who were.  

Sure, not all people within the system are corrupt.  It would be assinine
to make such broad assumptions.  However, a whole body does not have to be
cancerous to kill a person.

It might be a bit nit-picky, but I like to keep the 'system' seperate from
its administrators.  The Constitution was drafted with the primary motive
of creating a fair, unrepressive system in which to live under.  Any
failings with it are more likely due to its administrators then its mechanics.

Personal liberties returned?!  What do you think would happen to LA if the
police stopped patroling?  The gangs would all retire and everyone would
go on to leave a peaceful, pastoral existence.  Personal liberties?  Hell,
noone would have the liberty to walk outside without deciding whether it
was worth the risk of being killed.  As far as angry mobs go...I'd rather
put my fate in the hands of the police.  The average human isn't all that
bright and a far sight from rational.  How many innocents do you think
mobs would 'bring' to justice along with the guilty.  The moral majority
with policing authority?  I'd kill myself (and hopefully a lot of them
with the proper chemicals) before I stuck around.  It'd be just like cozy
old Salem.  That's not liberty.

So if you stop someone who was going to, say, rape a child and then kill
her (worse case scenario for dramatic effect :) it would be illegal to
harm him if he gives up.  Hell, you want mob justice, give it to the
police.  They're the ones who know where the problems are.  Give 'em
fucking automatics and let 'em clean this shit hole up.  Sure, they fake
evidence occasionaly.  Yet, at the same time they're criticised for this,
you advocate sentencing without a trial by a mob.  I don't even know why
the police do what they do.  They don't get paid shit and their job's to
be shot at defending ungrateful people.  Hell, I don't know what drives
them, but if they want more power, they've got my vote.

If you feel like they're trampling your freedom, you're barking up the
wrong tree.  They're upholding the law not creating legislation.  If you
don't like the laws they uphold, go bitch at a Congressman.  Honestly,
it's some of the silliest and most common transference ever perpetrated.

oh, now youve done it. forget the part abou eliminating police--i was just
using that rhetorically to point out the misgivings of the american
justice system--you said that that kid is getting what he deserved. Stand
back, i'm pissed now--where's my goddamn soapbox?

First of all, when you think of a beating you probalbly think of
dad gettin ga switch from the back yard and giving you a few good lashes
and maybe a little soreness on your ass for a day or two. Caning is
different. when you can someone, you don't use the switch. You get a 6
foot piece of rock-hard bamboo from the back yard, the biggest, meanest
bastard in town, and he slaps you across the lower back--not the butt--as
hard as he can putting all his 200+ pounds into it. Nerve damage and
paralysis are common results of this "good thing", and death is a decent
possibility too. Five or six swings could kill. Usually it just breaks and
fractures a few little vertabrae. Also if the pain is too much and you
pass out during the caning due to the unbearable pain--this is
common--they will wait till you wake again in order to continue so that
you feel every blow. 
and these injuries are on top of the ones you receive at the hands
of the creul and uncivilzed gaurds at the prison as they "coerce" your
confessions. 
and let's look at that lax that the kid in Singapore broke. A
plain old graffiti law? hell no! That is a law that the city(dictatorship)
passed in 1966 as an anti-sedition law. Is that a good thing? Do you even
understand sedition? It was created so that the government could beat up
on dissenters. This kid just happened to break it when he spray painted a
rich man's Mercedes. 
So you really want to see that kind of bullshit in America? You
really are a fascist son of a bitch who wants to beat fuckin' children for
breaking the anti-sedition laws of an oppressive government. If you do,
then I feel sorry for your mother ever having you. The fact that so many
americans do challaenges my faith in democracy and evaporates the pride i
have in being and american. Every american should want to put a bullet in
the heads of those in power in Singapore.

Um, everyone with a gun would not help matters any.  I've pointed out before
that an angry, irrational group of people can destroy thousands of innocents
simply because they have guns.  Doesn't work.  I don't want to live my life

punish their lawbreakers ? People in U.S. prisons are  treated to color 
T.V., free meals, many get a college education and tie up our legan system 
(I mean legal system) all at tax payer expense. Many convicts make a 
mockery out of our judicial system and do not take it serious. I think 
what you may be trying to say is the punishment should fit the crime. I 
agree with that but, in this case we are not talking about U.S. law. How 
another country doles out punishment for people *convicted* of a crime 
should be left up to them. If someone from Sinapore tried to tell us how 
to deal with one of it's citizens we had in jail, we would basically tell 
them to go fuck themselves. The "kid" you refer to is 18 years old and 
responsible for his actions. While his punishment may seem harsh to us, 
the judicial system there has something this nation lacks.... respect.

No, everything you complained about points to incompetence in the managers
of the system, not the system itself.  Think about it like some UNIX system,
like the IRIX system at my school.  Taken as a blank slate, there is nothing
wrong with IRIX 4.whatever (except for a couple security holes, but ignore
that for the time being).  The system has lots of open possibilities and
could be a cool place to compute.  But, the system managers have decided to
severely limit people's time on the system, install only the most basic
newsreaders, deny access to fun things like IRC, and basically complicate
the situation.  Now, would you blame this on IRIX?  Is it the fault of the
people at SGI that using the system one day during peak hours means that I
can't use it for a couple days afterwards?  No, the people who run the
system and use it to their advantage are to blame, not the system itself.

Yes, and now that's changed.  THe Constitution is a living document, capable
of change to reflect a greater understanding of humanity.  What exactly is
it about the Constitution that makes the system screwed up?  Is it the
writing of the text, or people's interpretations of it?  How is the system
itself incorrect (I was going to say imperfect, but I will concede that it
is not)?  If you are going to continually blame people for the state of the
system, then point out specific areas of the Constitution that have allowed
those screw-ups!  That will prove that the system is fucked, not just
pointing at bad people who have abused and misused the Law.

You're right that the plan is a joke, but you're saying it for the wrong
reason.  Chances should not factor into the decision.  Having only 3 chances
(or less) will not prevent crime.  In fact, it will overcrowd our already
overburdened and underfunded prison system.  Since they barely have any
money to begin with, prison conditions will worsen and we'll be at the state
of throwing people in dirty, unhealthy dungeons.  Just because a person
commits a crime does not make them less human.
The solution, IMHO, is education, both in the prison and outside.  Are
educational courses required in prison?  THey should be, if they're not. 
How many college grads do you see on the streets, mugging, raping, and
killing.  THe prison and crime situations will not be solved until the
social problems that perpetuate crime are eradicated.  
Do rich, smart people committ the same crimes that scare people?  I find
people who try to deny the link between poverty and crime and violence
slightly misguided.  What else could be the cause?  Race?  Yeah, right. 
Culture?  Maybe a little, but the popular culture of violence is more a
reflection of that life than a cause of it.

I laugh at him for not knowing the law.  That doesn't mean he should be
subjected to inhuman treatment.  This country's attitude toward the world is
hypocritical (well, not SO much since Clinton is in power).  During the
Reagan years, we worried about other countries in the world becoming
communist.  We felt we had the power and the righteousness to get involved
and interfere with those countries.  At the same time, we ignored human
rights violations around the world, saying that we should not tell other
countries how to run their judicial systems.  I'm not so sure how it is now. 
Did Clinton deny MFN status to China?  I hope so, even though it would
strain relations with N. Korea.  Whatever our country does, I want it to be
consistent, not hypocritical and jumping around between opposing policies.

If you concede the original framework of our government as just, which I
believe you have, then any changes, for better or worst, could only be
caused by elected officials.  i.e. no officials, no change for the worse. 
The two are inseperable.  We might be at the mercy of the govt.  But, it
is the government we placed in power.

I think you're just fucking with me on this issue and really know the
reasons for those concetions.  However, I'll humor you and reiterate some
grammer school history.

The original Constitution was drafted in the midst of the war for
independance.  The Southern states relied on slavery as a means of
production at the time.  It was the South, in fact, which wanted blacks to
count for any kind of vote.  The North was flat against any votes for
blacks.  Why?  Because it was strictly a political move on the South's
part for adding extra Congressmen to the US govt.  As far as the real
issue of slavery was concerned:  There was much infighting about it. 
Howver, the threat of not being able to pull the Union toghether on the
issue forced it onto the backburner so to speak.  If the issue had stopped
the creation of the Union there would be no US.

The issue was, however, taken back up in the Civil War, you will remember,
and addressed more adequately.

As far as women's suffrage:  No country on this planet let women vote at
the time.  I'd hardly address it as a unique concern of the US.  It was
simply an acceptable norm.  You''' remember that that was also addressed
at a later time.

The system corrupts everyone?  Well, there're two options if the system
corrupts everyone:

1.  Outlaw amendments.  That way no one can change the system.  Of course,
if you did that, then slavery would still be legal and women couldn't vote.

2.  Decide that people can't handle freedom without being corrupted and
institute a nice fascist regime to handle all the day to day thinking for
people. (Coincidentaly, that happens to be my favored solution.)

> so again, the system is fucked.

Actually, I'm not disagreeing.  Judging from the officials we've seen
enter office, I'd say the average person is far to stupid to vote.  I say
we give them a goddamned I.Q. test to see whether they're competent to
help form our government.

  Many people wonder why foreign countries hate the US.  This is a prime
example.  US citizens like to roam the planet like they own it.  When you

If you don't like it, don't go or don't break their laws.

  The crap about Singapore justice being barbaric is irrelevant.  They
have just as much right to run their country as they please as we do. 
Whether it is barbaric or not is all a matter of cultural perspective. 
That word's something most Americans aren't familiar with.  Most Americans
assume their ways are right and that's that.  Bullshit.  There is no right

Show me in no subjective manner what is right or wrong.  No pulling the

Until you can, right and wrong is irrelevant.  The only thing left is that
a bunch of Americans are pissed that an American is ACTUALLY subject to

I'd definately agree it's simply semantics.  However, our different views
of what constitutes the 'system' probably has an impact on how we think
the problem can be solved.  If you take the system as a whole, people
running it included, then it needs to be scraped.  However, if you take
them as seperate entities, the system doesn't need an overhaul-Congress
just needs a large bomb.

simply an opinion not a fact.  If it happens at home, damn well bet I'd
fight it.  But, it's not my right to impose my moral beliefs (regardless
of how valid they might seem) on an outside independant state.

I didn't mean to imply that all we can do is watch 'human rights'
violations when they occur.  I just mean we have no right to say we're
going to stop someone outside of our country from commiting what we
consider a crime in the name of morality or human rights.  If we're going
to screw with another country, fine, but do so honestly.  When's the last
time our country went to war because someone did something that pissed us
off.  All I'm asking for is honesty.  Why don't we just say.  "Hey, you
irritating me, I think we're going to bomb you.  What excuse do I have for
it?  How's the largest military on the planet waiting to do our bidding
strike you for a reason.  Fucking cut it out or we'll trash you."  Hell,
if it's what we mean then say it!  If we can't tell the truth and still do
it then maybe we need to reevaluate our right to intervene.

Basically, we seem to be agreeing.  Except you seem to base your

I agree, if it's bad enough, bomb the bastards.  But, if we do, then be

Oh, that's really great.  If you win because of name-calling, have you
really won at all, or have you just beaten your opponent into psychological
submission to your point of view?  Just because your emotional make-up is
sturdier than someone else's does not make you right.

I like this way of thinking, but it'll never, ever happen.  The whole idea
of politics is to appear to be on both sides of the game, to seem both angry
and amused, involved yet distant.
I differ with you a bit, though, on our involvement in the affairs of other
countries.  I believe we should get involved when human rights problems pop
up.  SOme people would expand my position to say that we should impose our
view of the world on everyone else.  It doesn't have to be that way, though. 
It should be possible to oppose (and maybe intervene) in human rights
violations without fucking with the government of the country.  I'm kinda
thinking of our old mission of stopping communism wherever it might lurk. 
We should allow government their own control and culture, but those controls
should not end up violating the rights of the citizens.  I can see that this
is nearly impossible, but it's interesting to figure out.

Oh come on, i shouldn't even have to answer this one. Let me answer with a
question: if name-calling is so useless, then why in the hell did you use
it in the very same prompt in which you criticized it. Sure, you were
trying to show how ludicrist it is--or perhaps just being ironic and
funny--but you still had a purpose for it. Perhaps you need to ask
yourself such things before you write instead of going with what your
kindergarten teacher always told you about name-calling. I mean even a

Hey, I didn't tell you how to act.  I was just saying that when an argument
degenerates into pure name-calling, then it becomes pointless.  If insults
are used to augment one side, you fuckhead, then it helps a lot and I don't
see why anyone would have a problem with it.  Name-calling for the sake of
insult seems childish, though.  Take, for instance, various members of the
Nation of Islam.  Their excuse for the insults they level at Jews (hook
nosed, lox-eating, bagel-eating bloodsuckers) is that they have been so hurt
that they can only insult.  It doesn't seem to me a sign of intelligence or
righteousness to just throw out that shit.
As for the use of simple names and catchphrases, those are great, but again,
when an argument is based only on its PR, it becomes worthless.  This is
more about the philosophy of debate than about telling someone how to act.

Pixy, do you know how to argue?
Jughead's name-calling was so meaningless, I completely ignored it.  That's
why he put it in, just for the sake of being useless.

I see your point about an arguement degenerating into name calling. Alot
of things people do can be done wrong--biking for instance. I got hit by a
car the other day on my way to the park--my bike and myself are fine, but
you should see the minivan  i hit. I was not riding like i should. Does
that mean that bicycle riding is wrong? no, jsut that i wasn't doing it
right. 
Name calling is the samein that respect--i can be fun and helpful
when done right, and it can fuck you upwhen you do it wrong--just like
anyhing else we do. My point is that we shouldn't make taboo's out of
anything, this is a characteristic of mediocre men.

Unfortunately, I have to agree.  That is, in fact, why I think a
competency test should be designed for potential voters.  Presentation
above substance- it makes me ill.  It's kind of sad that you have to play
the bullshit games to get in office.  It probably scares or disgusts the

Sorry, but I don't think that will ever happen.  Personally, I'm glad it
won't.  The potentials for abuse of a competency test are infinite.  Who

If he'd been kept in prison for the rest of his life, he wouldn't be
murdering or mutilating anyone else either.  Did his death deter others from
committing similar crimes?  If anything, the exposure he got glamorized his
atrocities, possibly giving others similar ideas.  I'm not saying the death
penalty is wrong.  I think it's perfectly fair to use it, but it should not
become a cop-out to rehabilitation.

Unfortunately, i have to agree with your point, too. People aren't fit for
democracy, not yet anyway. The right to vote should be merely a tool of
the people to check the government, not to rule the government. Perhaps,
though, a competency test would be the way to implemnt this, but don't
forget the jim crow laws and the poll taxes of the nineteenth century that
kept blacks out of government--the government can and probalbvly would
take advantage of a situation like that.

I don't think it'll ever happen iether, unfortunately.  However, I'm quite
aware of the potentials for abuse already and have given it some thought. 
IQ tests have never been under the line of fire as regards to their racial
and/or social bias.  I'd expect to have the APA design it and create a
national sociological review board to test it for bias.  Just a thought

You, sir, are correct in your statements regarding Jim Crow.  In the early 
part of this century, certain people were excluded from voting because 
they may support the "wrong" candidate.  These sanctions took the forms of 
literacy tests and poll taxes.  The Supreme Court overturned these 
oppresive measures.  Now, with certain resrictions, just about anyone can 
vote in this country.  The candidates we have to choose from is the price 
we pay for a free electorate.

I think it would generally make things worse.  To require some competency
test would be to decide that the majority of people are stupid.  I can't
agree with the idea that the mass of people are hopelessly lost in a sea of
idiocy.  Though it may seem that most people ARE that way, that doesn't mean
that we should assume that in general people are mindless.  Why not look at
why they are so dumb?  I think that most stupidity is produced by a lack of
education.  If we had schools that promoted independent thought, and that
were staffed by competent, well-paid teachers, I doubt we'd have this
problem.  Let's try this solution before we decide that America is
hopelessly stupid.

I always thought the thing we should do is this (suggested by Jello Biafra):
Have a "None of the Above" candidate on the ballot.  If this person wins,
then you have to hold a new election with all new candidates.  Why not?  The
problem with that is, who rules in the meantime?
Another thing that would help is to force the media to adhere to the equal
time laws.  They seem to be generally discarded in order to show the two
main candidates (dems and reps).

What if someone really is rehabilitated?  Do we want them to spend the rest
of their lives in jail, living off taxpayer money, or should we kill them
in the first place, never giving them the chance to become new people?  What
if you committed a murder in the heat of passion?  Would you agree to go to
jail if you knew you'd be put to death?  There is no way to classify
criminals as a group.  The rehab and judgement of a person's ability to
return to society should be determined individually, not by some parole
board that simply looks at behavior.  Unfortunately, to do this would
require a lot of money, which would in turn require higher taxes.  Since
people consider paying taxes a purely evil affront to their existence as
citizens, they must live with overfilled, underfunded prisons and unrehabbed
criminals released onto the streets.  An increase in death penalties is not
the answer, and we can't just stick people in poor prisons to rot. 
Committing a crime and going to jail means you give up certain rights.  One
that you don't give up is your right to be treated like a human being.

These are not examples that I would've used.  I know Gacy and Manson are
serial killers, so I'm assuming the others are, too.  None of these people
were put in jail and released, I believe, so why bring these up, except to
argue in favor of a death penalty for crazies?  I don't think their deaths
will deter similar crimes, though, because the things that drove them to
murder are not "typical" criminal instincts (typical ones being anger,
hatred, greed, etc.).

This works in favor of what I said.  They've decided on an individual basis
that this is someone who does not deserve to live.

I'm not sure if I understood the full intent of your post.  Did I correctly

There is a difference between deciding something and recognizing something
which simply exists.  The term idiot is not an arbitrarily used insult
(although English has bastardized the word quite well), it's a standard
(along with moron and a few others) category of low scoring intelligence
quotients.  I'm not deciding anything.  If I'm wrong, then I invite the
majority of the population to prove me wrong.

Firstly, you are confusing stupidity with ignorance.  Don't blur the
lines.  Ignorance is cureable, stupidity is not.  Intelligence quotient
testing (which is what I wanted to base the testing on) measures innate
conceptualization, learning and cognitive ability.  Ideally, the test has
nothing to do with education.It doesn't measure if you know anything, just
if you are capable of learning.  If the inner workings of a national
government are beyond the cognitive grasp of someone, why the hell would
you let them run it.  You wouldn't turn of the operation of a fission
reactor to a five year old.  So, why would you turn the government over to
someone who doesn't understand it?

Does it bother anyone else on this board that we are the ONLY nation in 
the industrialized world that regularly executes its criminals?  We do so 
while also having the highest rate of violent crime of any industrialized 
nation - so much for deterrence.

What does the death penalty say about us?  To me it says that we're lazy 
and selfish.  Rather than doing what's hard (dealing with the root causes 
of criminal behavior) we'd rather do what's quick and expedient -
kill 'em and kill 'em fast.  We don't want to be bothered with the 
despair, hopelessness and poverty that our society creates.  We want to 
sweep all that ugly stuff under the rug - until it comes back to haunt us 
in the form of an astronomically high crime rate.

We've had the death penalty for a long time in the U.S.  It never stopped 
crime in the past, and it won't stop it in the future.  All it does is 
make people feel good (as Maedhros reminds us) while making us look
barbaric and uncivilized.  Is it worth it?

Although I'm tempted to agree with the basic premise of Maedhros' argument 
(that the smart people should run things), I don't think that his I.Q. 
test can accomplish that goal.  Only 50% of the voting age people in this 
country vote in a presidential election, and I'd bet that most (over 90%) 
could pass his test.  Let's face it, it's the smart people (the educated 
people) who are more likely to vote.  The less-smart people (the
less-educated, often mostly poor people) are far less likely to vote.

I think that things would pretty much stay the same, unless he made the 
I.Q. cutoff very high, say around 140, where only the REALLY smart people 
can vote.  But this, of course, is beyond the realm of possibility.  
Besides, I'm not sure that the benifits of having the smart people run 
things outweighs the cost of losing our pseudo-democratic ideals.

The Death Penalty has only one benefit. It shows people exactly what they 
don't know about executions. The only problem I have with it is that not 
enough people get to see them, and still think it is a neat and easy 
solution to the tremendously violent aspect of humanity. Violence 
countered with violence isn't especially effective, but it does show the 
limited brainpower of humanity. But a few people deserve to die, I will 
say that. In the case of a Gacy, let the victims families alone with him

It bothers me immensely.  What the hell's wrong with the other countries? :)
I'm not sure I agree with your line of thinking here.  You seem to think
that since we have suck an astronomically high crime rate, the death
penalty is innefectual.  Who said the death penalty was instituted as a
deterrent.  I, personally, couldn't give a flying fuck less is it deters
any would be criminals or not.  The desath penalty is reserved for people
who, with malice aforethought, ended another individual's life.  Reform? 
Deterrence?  Fuck that!  Revenge!

I seriously doubt if someone shot one of your loved ones in cold blood for
profit or the sheer fun of it, you'd be worried about the death penalty's
relative effectiveness as a deterrent.  We're not talking about social
control or reform-we're talking about justice.  If you don't agree with
this, I'd be forced to assume (granted that this is just an assumption)
that noone in your family has been murdered and you are incapable of
pacing yourself in their shoes.  I know sure as hell, that if it happenned
to me, I'd demand blood debt.  If you didn't fry him, you'd sure as hell
have to lock me up when he came out on parol, because I'd kill him myself.

Sorry about the flagrant appeal to emotion.  I know it's a falacious
backbone for an argument, but it's difficult to stay objective on this

Vengeance isn't a right, it's an act.  Who has a right?  Whoever can get

Isn't that rather obvious?  It's hard to have any social control if people
are allowed to exact vengeance without going through the proper channels
of the law.  Shit, everybody would be shooting at everyone if there wasn't
some set of rulesx to go about it.  Simply put, a group of objective peers
are charged with deciding whether or not an action merits revenge.  Once
again, it seems rather obvious.

The govt. doesn't decide, so the point is rather mute.  A group of peers
(these are normal citizens, NOT govt. employees, decide whether a person
is fried).  Hell, even if the govt. did decide, it's not some seperate
entity.  You elected the people running it.

So if I shoot someone and they die, I should be immune to revenge? They
can only seek revenge if my aim was off?  Are you sure you thought that
statement through fully?  If I steal something, should I only be
prosecuted if the attempt fails?  That's etting some bizarre precedence
don't you think?  What'd you mean by that?

First of all, finding the peers has been and will always be
one of the biggest exercises in futility, especially today. And if you 
honestly think that juries today are anything but government appointed 
stooges doing what they've been screened out by defense and prosecution to 
do, than you are wrong. I, in the past I admit, said how I thought crime 
should be handled, via a mob of outrages peasants wielding torches.8)
Seriously, while a lot of what I said was sarcastic rambling, I do think 
that this nation, and indeed all nations, could do without all the law and 
legal systems they have. Just throw them out. Give people a good hard shot 
of Anarchy, and see what develops out oif the melange. Fourier would tell 
you that there'd be Phalanstere's all over the world within a week, and 
while I disagree, having a much more pessimistic view, I can't PROVE that 
he's wrong.
And you are rightwhen you say that vengance isn't a right. Therefore the 
civic policy should not include it. When you actually have people running 
for office on a pro-death penalty platform, you know they are just using 
the gullability of the sheep and not trying to add anything positive.

In closing, I say anarchy and lawlessness are the way to go.

Sorry, I'm not quite following this.  They're screened by both the defense
and prosecution in order for the juries to be filled with people who will
act as the government wants them to?

1.  Exactly how does the government appoint juries.  You've made the
accusation, but I'm not sure if you've cited any proof of this.  Possibly
you're using the last part of this paragraph as proof.  If so, that leads
me to point two.

2.  You say that the prosecution and defense both screen the jurors to do
what they're "supposed to do".  Uh, if I remember correctly, their isn't a
whole hell of a lot which the prosecution and defense BOTH want a juror to
do.  Last I remember, they want the jurors to do completely different
things.  i.e. vote guilty and vote innocent.  Is this just a logical
"slip" or are you claiming that the prosecution and defense are in secret
cohorts to "fix" all trials in the U.S.?

> And you are rightwhen you say that vengance isn't a right. Therefore the 
> civic policy should not include it.

The civic policy should include anything the majority of people living
here want to institute as policy.  You claim to be an anarchist, but your
policies are fascist.  If you don't believe in vengeance, then don't press
charges if someone shoots you.  Express your anarchism.  However, when you
think public policy should be modeled on your own beliefs- that's not
anarchy, that's fascism.  In summary, you said,"If something isn't a
right, civic policy should not include it."  This isn't in the
Constitution.  You've simply expressed a wish to arbitrarily rewrite a
legal system which decides the fate of millions.

What?  Call me a sheep, but I thought they were offering the public what
they wanted.  That's how a democracy works right?  Who gives a shit if he
thinks he's adding anything positive or not.  If I vote for him, it's his
job to make policy according to my wants, not to critique my moral fiber.

I see what you mean.  I'm not ignorant of the nuances, just bad at
expressing myself completely.  I'm actually quite aware of how the system
works and how it was meant to work and the differences in between.  I
(personally mind you) just don't care much for the procedures, as long as
the outcome is what I want.  I fully realize that officials don't make (at
least the vast majority of them) decisions based on deep-seated moral
imperatives-they're just kissing voters asses.  The final line though, is
whether they do what they say.  As for their reasons, they're irrelevant.

Ill-informed?  Colorful use of language.  I think you meant to say, "Not
coming into a trial with prejudiced views on the defendants innocence or
guilt" though.  I'll be damned if I'd want any of my jurors fresh from a
night of watching hard-copy or any other prime time trash about my case.

I'll grant you a fact-they probably do eat lunch between trials, although
most attornies I know seldom have time.  As far as the rest goes-it
substance is true to an extent, but it's intentionally (I hope)
misleading.  The reason so many plea bargains are passed is so the courts
can have adeqaute time to deal with more serious crimes, such as murder. 
I call it misleading, because the main point of this thread was ABOUT
capitol punishment.  Either you're trying to manipulate "facts" out of

Are you saying that you are not sincere?  It's a form of mass media.  It'd

Now, i'm not going to defend Clinton and his administration--as an
objectivist, i have mainly problems with them. However, i do feel that
people have been duped onto a very dangerous bandwagon of Clinton bashing.
People hate the guy not for any solid reason, just because it seems that
everyone else does. Of course, what president isn't the butt of a million
different jokes? I realixe that, but with clinton it's different--people
seem really afraid that he is going to really destroy america. 

But that's the beauty of the system--unless he were to start a nuclear
war, he can't do much to ruin the country. the system works slowly. this
is great becuase it keeps uncle sam out of my life. Also, the structure of
the bill of rights is geared toward limiting the government from imposing
tooo many rules on the government. 

So don't be afraid of clinton--he's harmless and will probalbly be gone in
a year or two. Be afraid of the religious right; they have no respect for
the constitution. They would make the bible and their own self serving and
warped interpretations of scripture of the constitution.

As far as the Supreme Court are concerned, there is no such thing as

that whatever the democratically elected government decides to do it can
do because the people have "decided" to give them the power. Liberla 
judges interpret the law in their own way - basically making up the 
constitution as they go along. Ever since the Federal Reserve started 
printing dollar bills during the civil war (the Federal authorities are

It's not supposed to do things like Medicare and Medicaid.... But if you

If you have little patience with being criticized, why are you writing on

    But what about when the Government blatantly destroys and ignores the 
Bill of Rights?  (for example: The Weaver incident, the Lawmaster incident 
, and the Waco massacre; all conducted by our own government, all in 
violation of Article IV and Article V, and all occurring within the past 
couple of years.)

    'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,

be violated...'

Tell me why I should bother to consider those who *didn't* bother to vote? 
 How is their voice relevant to your point, if they *chose* NOT to have a 
voice?  Someone certainly needs to class.

"The basic premise of capitalism is FREE enterprise and association..."

Let me quote a favorite psychologist of mine:
    "...where the members of an unorganized group exchange goods and 
    services under informal contingencies, an economic instituition or
    agency clarifies special roles - such as those of employer, worker,
    buyer, and seller - and constructs special types of *reinforcers*
    [emphasis added], such as *money and credit* [emp. added again].
                                        B.F.Skinner, Beyond Freedom and 
                                                    Dignity

If you have ever cracked open a psych. textbook, or taken a psych. course, 
you will understand the significance of the word "reinforcers," which has 
serious behavorial implication to what you claim about capitalism, which 
you maintain is "free" in some sense.  Instead control is taken out of the 
government's hands and put instead into the hands of those who have money, 
which are accepted psychological reinforcers; they influence or detain 
certain types of behavior, which can hardly be called free.

"think about your answer before you make a fool of yourself"

I'm not worried about my image to you.  However, someone who fails to 
spell correctly *intentionally* doesn't seem to show much smarts himself.

I've quoted a respectable Harvard psychologist; I've made my point.  
Insult me all you wish, but you still have nothing to back yourself up

re: "Why is the majority of anrachy based on reactionary atheism" etc

Interesting. 
I guess I must not fit with the "majority of anarchy" then.

My guess is that the "majority of anarchy" (as you see it) is an
extreme, in its own way similar to puritanism: the rejection/denial of 
instinct. The only difference is that instead of worshipping a diety (as a 
concrete idea), "they" deify logic. Vis-a-vis "reactionary atheism."

Don't get me wrong. I'm neither puritan nor atheist. I'm really an 
agnostic, in the sense of the word that I believe that it is impossible to 
know or verify the existence of any higher power, but at the same time, it 
is impossible to deny the possibility that higher power(s) may exist. Thus 
I waste little time on theological debate.

I don't consider myself a die-hard anarchist (or a die-hard anything, for 
that matter), because I recognise that history is cyclical, and 
ultimately, any system will fall.

I'm more in favor of anarchy mainly because it's quicker. No mucking about 
with a power structure. Just let things fall as they may. Dadaist 
government.

That's a good question. I don't really have a strong answer for that one.
Let me give it a whirl. One thing before that---those Articles you
mentioned are really ammendments--but it doesn't change the nature of your
question. 

The constitution doesn't always get upheld. The rules it makes in the
system of checks and balances doesn't gaurantee that the rights and the
correct order of the constitution will be upheld, it just makes it much
more likely. You see, the separate branches of the government don't have
to check each other over matters of constitutionality if it doesn't want
to. Take for instance the old Flag burning law. Both congress and the
president had approved this obvious assault against the provisions of
Amendment I, but if the court had not execised its power, the bill would
still be in place today. The constitution is no real gaurantee of freedom
and justice, but it is something to put in the face of the gowernment when
it acts unjustly.

I do agreee with your sentiment on personal liberty. I also agree with an
earleier post where you said you haven't really noticed much change in
your life. One of the reasons for this is because the government is
designed to work as fast as radioactive decay. Thank god for this, or else
we'd have the govenment all over us by now. 

Another reason for this is the constant cynicism of people like arachnoi.

I'm sorry Nat, but i gotta go with arachnoi on his point about the
temporality of art. Life is temporary, so logically it seems hard to
beleive that the temporal could produce something eternal. Art is
temporary, it won't last forever. Just like you and me it tires of
fighting the destructive powers of decay and eventually returns to it's
original state--dust. 

But perhaps that's the beautiful thing about it is that it does decay. It
is the emotional and even spiritual process we undergo in creating it
followed by it's certain decay and destruction. I don't see how this is
unbeautiful. Art's like a totally mental reproduction of life, and subject
to the same rules for better or for worse. 

I don't think i'd want it to be eternal anyway. I tend to fear the thought
of eternity and the power of anything that could exist incessantly.

if you were talking about the Pat Robertson, Rush Limbaugh, Jesse HElms
type Repyblican or the William F. Buckley type. I Think those Pat
Robertson types would be a horrible choice for America. I like the
capitalist ideas, but i would rather have political freedom than economic
freedom, and the Pat Robertson tupe of Republicans would rather have
economic freedom--That's just not cool :)

If I had your mentality I'd have told you to go fuck yourself blue in the 
face.  But I won't stoop to your level; I see you as a very ignorant 
person, while being quite smug and arrogant.  You are a challenge to me, 
arachnoi, and when I'm through you'll have either quit or have cracked.

That said and done...

"hahahaha, xela, your posts are always such a mix of illogical dribble, 
the temptation to beat you over the head with your own words is 
irresistable."

1.  In the past few messages you have yet to show the illogical nature of 
my arguments.

2.  You have yet to come up with a logical argument of your own.

So the only question in my mind is: Do you know what the fuck a logical 
argument is?

"but then you said 'orignla' cut and paste...this one in here"

1.  You are either blind or illiterate; I made a correction at the end of 
my message concerning that word.  A quick check of that message
will verify the fact.

2.  I don't deliberately go out my way to look illiterate.  Any mistakes I 
make are typographical in nature; this editor doesn't allow for correction 
very easily.  Which doesn't excuse my sloppiness, but it doesn't excuse 
yours either.

"...so you won't have a chance to pretend to some learning...too bad you 
don't apply the same effort to thinking."

1.  Enlighten me then, O Great Lord Muck, and quit digressing with 
insults.

"hahaha, little school boy.  This isn't 'The Young Republicans' this is 
the Anarchy Base, go play with the other teenie boppers."

1.  You certainly assume a great deal about me for one who claims to be 
cognizant of a great deal:
    a.  You were wrong about the political affiliation; I have none.
    b.  You assumed I could make no distinction between the Young 
Republicans and the Anarchy forum.  Wrong again.
    c.  You assumed I was a teenager.  Strike three and you're out.

"I agree that ALL governments and social/economic relations require 
aspects of behavior which limit one's freedom"

So you were agreeing with what I was saying.  Ok, now we're getting 
somewhere.

"...In other words, there is a freedom zero baseline that noone can get 
below...Freedom then becomes a degree of freedom allowed above the 
baseline"

You made the claim that capitalism is the only free system, and now you 
are waffling by saying that only certain levels of freedom exist.  My 
claim is that, by themselves as a philosophic element, capitalism and 
communism do NOT, by any means, qualify as encouraging, or even allowing, 
freedom.  Both use behavior control techniques.

"...Who cares about an intrinsic [baseline] constant that no one can do 
anything about?"

I never brought this up, as I feel that freedom is an illusion, but since 
you brought it up...  If you are to make an argument that certain degrees 
of freedom exist, then you should care about that constant; your argument 
rides upon it!  Without rigorously exposing and defining that mystical 
caonstant, I have only your word that your argument is correct.

Until then, you have some homework to do.

Ta,

hey arachnoi, I saw your responses to my questions abou the majority of 
anarchists bieng white males, and also on the mysticism, or "reactionary 
atheism"  and the problem is IM very very limited on time now so I'll only 
b able to lightly glaze the donuts.
 
Of course not all are white, but I don't think you can deny that the 
majority of them are white males, usually between the ages of 
13-2something.  Of ocurse the "real" ones go on while their older, but at 
times it's little more than a fad for teenagers, and that is no way to 
make changes.
 
 
 
reactionary atheisms: the kind that Nietzche rags on all the time ya know. 
 The stuf that Hakim Bey talks about. The purely rational anarchist, who 
thinks that zoon logikoon is the only way to live.  It's the reaction to 
the extreme religousness that preceeded it.  only it isnt the onyl form of 
anarchy possible.  there is ontological anarchy as well, or "mystic' nd NO 
mystic doesnt imply an order at all, and mystic DOESNT imply new age 
assholes spewing shit & shinola.  More like recognition of the emotions of 
life, and a passion of rliving, or a recognition of the irational, or to 
better put it arational.
 
to paraphrase F. Nietzche - the gratest liberation is overcoming the self.
 
i wont be able to comment on your responses for awhile since i'll be

let's see...i never said that egypt was gonna last forever, i was just 
pointing outthat of WHAT REMAINS of their art, religion, philosophy, etc.

i have looks at the sistinechapel since the restoration, and quite 
frankly, i think it looks better.  of course, i'm not a big fan of murky, 
sark, hard to see pictures.  

i've read extensively in shakespeare, he happens to be one of my favorite 
writers.  and if you knew anything at all, you'd know thatthere only about 
10 themes in ALL of literature.  (No, i can't name them)  So basically 
everyone is ripping off the greeks.  all bill did was write aboutthose 
themes in a manner that was timeless.  which is a lot more than a lot of 
modern writers can do.

homer.  if that's what survived, then imagine what's gone.  for me, 
history is a lesson to be learned, that we mustn't let the mistakes ofthe 
past be repeated in the present.  all that the burningof the library in 
ALEXANDRIA (not constantinople you schmuck) tells me is that we have to be 
aware that human nature is capricious and greedy and that we as a race 
have a nasty tendency to wipe out things that are different from us.  or 
don't agree with what we think.  or don't look how we look.  or don't love

About the only thing most modern lit. scholars can agree on is that they 
weren't written by the same person, or even one person. The stories were a 
part of the oral tradition for hundreds of years before they were written 
down. so it is wrong to attribute them to one "Homer."

Not at all.  You are ignorant, smug, and arrogant.  You cannot make a 
logical argument to save your skin.  You are a challenge to me.  All of 
these are facts, not insults.  If they were meant to be insulting, they 
wouldn't be true.

{Word?  There were several mispellings in that sentence alone...}

List them.  I'll check.

{...Most of the post was riddle with poor grammar and spelling mistakes.}

Then we'll have an independent party check my messages and your messages.  
In the end it will be clear who is more adapt at writing a coherent 
sentence; you'd lose simply on your appalling spelling, not to mention 
your frequent misuse of tempus and contractions.

{...U still fail to follow through on your argument, and think what 
implications it has.}

Man, I've been writing about the philosophy of freedom for a couple years 
now.  In the process I've aquired numerous texts, and I've had several 
experiences with power structures.  If I fail to follow through on an 
argument, at least I am qualified enough to say that I have one and can 
defend it.

You, on the other hand, have no argument.  Simply put, you throw insults 
and expect people to take you seriously.  Step back for a moment and look 
at the both of us.  Which one would you, honestly, think have more 
credibility?

{...What U say is far more important than how long it takes, or how you 
say it.}

Absolutely wrong.  What you say can only be taken seriously when you say 
it well.  Would Hitler have gotten as far as he did, had he not been as 
eloquent as he was?  This is not to say that I aspire to be Hitler, but to 
make the point that people listened to him because what he said was well 
planned and executed.

{...Who said anything about your political affiliation?...}

You did.

{...This was a rhetorical statement of your mindset.}

Bullshit.  Stop trying to weasel your way out of what you said.

{...Act anal retentive like the "Young Republican" crowd and we will start 
calling u Skippy}

We?  You mean there are more of you?  Damn, if you're going to start 
calling me Skippy, I guess I'd better give up!

{...Like wise, if u can't muster the competence of a teenie bopper, then 
emotionally I guess you still are one.}

Well, for someone who thinks calling me Skippy affects me, you have a lot 
of nerve calling me immature.  

{As usual you're being sloppy.  Go back and read the original post, and 
try to concentrate this time.}

You claimed that capitalism encourages more freedom than communism.  So 
then you claim that levels of freedom exist.  Then you say that those 
levels are a constant which has no bearing on this argument, because they 
all factor out.  Therefore that"constant" is equal throughout all systems 
which regulate levels of freedom, otherwise it wouldn't factor out.  
Therefore, the levels of freedom for both capitalism and communism are 
equal, and both have the same "level of freedom."  You just contradicted 
yourself.

"There are NO govts. of social/economic systems that 'qualify as 
encouraging, or even allowing, freedom.'..."

                     ^^^^^^^^
But then you say:

{There are only degrees.}

You agreed with my claim that govts., social and economic interactions do 
not allow for freedom.  Then you say there are degrees.  Again you 
contradict yourself.

{here's the root of your inability to think logically...}

Excuse me?

{Everything here is a direct consequence of what you thought was 
important.  Yet U can't put it together.}

I just did.

so....if i write a piece of great literature, and then decide to tell

while we're at it, what do you call heinrich schliemann's discovery of 
troy?  a hoax?  he proved that there was a troy, and it was sacked (many

Guilt by association, essentially. I believe the legal term
is "collective possesion." i.e. if you are standing in a circle with some 
friends, and one of them has a joint, and when a cop comes along, that 
person throws the joint in the middle of the circle, so that the cop 
cannot identify the "culprit," you could all be hauled in on a "collective 
possession" charge. 

Depending on the type and amount of substance, it could be serious. In the 
example above, the charge would likely be a misdemeanor (posession of less 
than 20g of marijuana). But if you are at a party and someone brings kilos 
of coke to sell, you could be in some deep shit.

The police will haul all of you in for questioning to see if ownership can 
be determined.  If no ownership can be proven, in most cases, all of the 
suspects will be turned loose with some stern warnings.  In your other 
scenario, one of the attendees would probably have turned the party in so 
the raid would take place.  The police would in all likely hood know who 
was responsible for the drugs being in the vicinity.  BTW if you have a 
trace of narcotics in your system, you cand be THEORETICALLY, arrested for 
poss of a controlled substance. (under Georgia law).  As stated before, be 
very, very careful who you party with.

have never attended public high school in Illinois except for now but 
because of tax laws my parents still have to pay for someone else to go to 
school in my district...fucked up....anyway, I was told tonight, along 
with aporx. 50 other styudents in my hs completion program that the state 
fucked up once again and twisted some surveys thatr  other students took 
last fall and told our district that if they didn't pay for a bunch of 
stuff that we "said" we wanted that they were going to shut down the state 
funding of the program..well needless to say the district doesn't have the 
money for the new stuff ( stuff we don't want and don't need) so about 
50-60 people were told tonight that we can no longer go to school.  in my 
school we had teachers and it was free allowing single moms and the poor 
to get a diploma and better their lives.  we are the only program in the 
area that has that kind of a program...all other ones are correspondence 
or something else.  our was the best... well anyway if anybody knows of

It is a goood question--i really don't know how you can have one without
the other. But both the major parties in america seem to think you can. My
thinking is just that the political freedoms--freedom of speech, religion,
privacy, and so on--are much more important than laissez faire economic

(Eden) to the desert wasteland (outside) which resulted from a drought and 
destroyed the vegetation.  It was put into storybook form, the Bible, and 
became a "bestseller."

     "...objectivity is not just a social virtue.  It goes beyond
openmindedness to opposing views, and it goes beyond sensitivity to the
cognitive needs of others.  The ability to step back from our train of
thought and examine it critically is a virtue even if we are not
interested in communicating it.  It is a virtue because it is the only way
to check the results of our thinking, the only way to avoid jumping to
conclusions, the only way to stay in touch with the facts.  The results of
our thinking cannot be any better than the processes by which we arrive at
them.  There is no Book of Life with answers in the back where we can see
whether we got it right.  Good thinking is a self-directed,
self-correcting process, alert to the dangers of hasty judgement, and
never afraid to ask-or answer-the question "why?"  Once again, this is
partly a matter of attitude, a matter of choice, and logic won't make the
choice for you.  But it will give you the tools you need.  It will give
you a compass to steer by." -David Kelley

To be so bold as to answer a question itterated at this board so often
lately-what is the point of this arguing?.  Argument, or critical
discussion as I prefer to call it, are the necessary exercise requirements
of a healthy, agile (for the most part :) mind.  It is a process by which
one refines his ideas, hones his proofs, and validates his conclusions.

Is it an exercise for all?  Definately not.  If the thought of someone
saying your conclusions are false throws you into fits of ire, then stay
clear.  It's necessary to be (1) firm in your beliefs and competent in
defending them and (2) at the same time, be capable of acknowledging
something you hadn't considered in the first place and being able to admit
that mistake.

What's the primary purpose of the board?  Damn good question.  I can't
speak for all, but I can tell you it's primary importance to me.  The
board is a testing ground for new ideas.  I feel competent in
understanding alot on my own.  However, I also can recognize that I'm far
from omniscient.  The board gives me a chance to see things from others'
perspectives.  It gives me an invaluable chance to assemble a "think tank"
to try to turn over anything I might have missed.  One thing I've never
found tolerable is the company of a person who's afraid to support their
opinions, yet they're still willing to spout their conclusions to you all
day.  An opinion from someone like this is less than worthless.  They have
come to a conclusion, but they're unwilling to share or argue the logic
which provided it?  How did these people make it to the top of the food chain?

Granted, the board sometimes runs into tangents which have little to do
with critical thinking (discourses about someone's probable sex life or
sentence structure), but hey, tempers sometimes flair.  It's natural.  It
always dies down eventually and the board goes onto more worthy pursuits.

...which brings up the purpose of antagonists.  Like I said before, if
someone challenging your views pisses you off, what the hell are you doing
here?  Unsubscribe and join channel "Blind Right".  Face it, this is for
people with confidence in themselves who are willing to stand under the
line of fire.  If it's too hot...

Hell I don't know how to put it any simpler.  I'd write a damn charter for
the board if this wasn't the Anarchy base (any form of governing document
would probably be met with by the resident anarchists with immediate
destruction of my dwelling, slaughtering of my cattle and defilement of my
woman :)

Well, I received a first hand look at Mr. Clinton when he was still a 
candidate for the office of president. He was giving a speech. and had a 
two hour layover beforehand so he had a little time to waste and we spoke 
with each other for 5 or 10 minutes. He seemed like a very intelligent man 
but, he had a very bad temper. He shouted at some of his staff and could 
be heard throughout the whole wing of the building. He seemed very 
childish and very vain. (A makeup artist was even called in at the last 
minute for him) All that was beside the point. I find it very hard to 
respect a man who when he was younger, went on record as saying he LOATHED 
the military and now, he states he wishes he could participated in the 
D-day invasion because he LOVES the military. He has also said because he 
is the president, he knows whats best for us. (paraphrase) What's wrong 
with this country was not all his doing but he is not making things 
better. I'll probably get flamed for saying this but, I love this country 
and feel like there is none greater. We have freedoms that many countrys 
only dream about *including* the freedom to say what we feel about that 
very same government. Sure we have many problems but they can be corected 
if someone has the balls to do so. A good start would be to have someone 
in office that people could respect and not question their credibility. 
You mentioned in your last post to me about having Mr. Quaile running 
around the White House. I'd feel much more comfortable having him run 
around the White House than having Ms. Clinton running around. 
I'm sure Mr. Clinton tries hard and is probably frustrated as hell at 
everyone questioning him everytime he turns around. I would never want the 
job because, no matter how hard you tried, you can never please everyone. 
I'm one of those now who is displeased and can't wait for 1996 when 
hopefully we will have the chance to get on the right track. Right now, I 
can't see that happing with the administration we have in power.

Freedom's not a really good reason to "endure" life.

I live for pleasure. It can be emotional, sensual, or (rarely) sexual. 

It's all the same.

The quest for pleasure naturally leads to the quest for freedom
 (i.e. dissatisfaction with regulation- "If I were free to do such and 
such, I might enjoy it. the pleasure might be worth it.) Mankind is a too

On the whole IQ vs Unemployment issue, I'd have to agree with you.

But I finally accept that I will never be helped by anyone.
I envy your passion.

Here is an anecdote: I walked into my socialism, anarchy and communism 
class two years ago and told a person named Bob that I was beginning to 
think that with a reapplication, some of the socialist ideas of Owen might 
be doable, and would help the economy. He said, and I quote, "Fuck that!"
I asked him why, and he revealed to me that anyone who doesn't make at 
least fifty thousand a year is worthless, according to him and his family. 
I was even more shocked when several others in the class supported him.
Their rallying cry was "Fuck the poor." I make less than seven thousand a 
year (This expensive college education is being paid for by a trust fund 
my rich grandfather left just for the purpose. I grew up lower middle 
class myself) I realized that these people would as soon shit on me as

Maybe nothing. Maybe that people are inherently evil. Maybe that they need

"I was thinking aboutreality.  Thinking about chaos and disorder.  If 
science seems to be making our universe, and in fact our world, more

Perhaps (HARE-BRAINED THEORY ALERT!) the appearance of order is just a way 
to shut down the faith of the human mind in certain things, to limit the 
possibilities.  Take the curse, for example.  Very few people in 
industrialized nations believe in curses anymore, so they don't work.  Not

My own personal chaos theory.

Living things function by the random firing of neurons in their cerebral

Now, tthese neural firings are supposedly chaotic, according to 
scientists, with fairly unlimited range and no discernable pattern. Then 
how do we think? How do we correlate ideas? Chaos is just ultimate order, 
and order is the ultimate manifestation of chaos. Check out thermodynamic

I'm not necessarily saying IQ does make a difference.  Ipersonally feel it
does, but that's a different argument altogether.  Your statement,
however, is a non sequitur.

What does knowledge of your IQ have to do with its rating?  For example, if
my IQ is 170, how does my knowledge of this affect the rating?  It's a 170,
regardless, correct?

What does this have to do with intelligence quotients?  Is this an
unrelated aside?  Are you saying that you can see no recognizable
difference between the current government and a complete lack thereof? 
I'd consider that completely unsupportable.  You can see no difference
between the causes and effects in my life if I was, say, a serial killer? 
I'd go through life with the same repurcussions regardless of whether the
US govt. was in power?  Please pick your words a bit more carefully in

This assumes that science "creates" order.  This is hardly the case (at
least there is no justifiable evidence to lead to this conclusion). 
Scince merely finds order that already existed.  By inference, this would
suggest that the possibilities are NOT multiplying, we're just noticing
more of them now.  Since there is no evidence that science can either
"create" order or chaos simply through observation, the conclusion seems
unjustified.

Non sequitur.  This one'd give Aristotle a cardiac.  If I didn't believe
in the existence of guns, I bet you could still kill me with one.  The
author is attemting to ascribe power over the physical world through
belief.  Neat theory, but she would have to show a lot of evidence to
support that claim (of which she gives none).

> Not that they didn't work to begin with.  They did. 

Once again, a nice theory, but unless she's an expert in this field (and
she'd have to be a minor deity to qualify for that), then it's a
groundless statement lacking evidence and, hence, merit.

If you can send her this response I'd like to get her to try and expand
and try to support this theory though (it could be interesting).

Self satisfaction needn't be shallow. Think for a moment about your

Just because I don't engage in mindless acts of drunken, orgiastic

True to a point, but essentially incorrect.  Individual firings APPEAR
random.  However, analysis of macro-scale firings do not support your
claims.  If there were no discernable patterns, we would not know what
areas of the brain control which functions.  Hell, we've been able to map

I doubt you know me well enough to judge. IQ's merely a measure of

Well, forgive me, I didn't realize that topics of philosophy lived and

such power. I'm glad that's your job, not mine.

"You are right! I have made my way as I go. All the way from the

Eh? Kindly elucidate; I was unable to parse the above contradiction. You 
first agree that your life has never been "rough" then tell me that you've 
built your life all by your lonesome?

Well, I'll assume for the moment that you think you have "made the journey 
from the proverbial bottom to the proverbial top" all by yourself.

Got news for ya, bud. Noone does. You are where you are today because of 
the aggregate efforts of those around you, in addition to your own. Ever 
heard the quote "No man is an island"? Well, it's true. Anyone trying
to project the image that they have "made it on their own" is at best 
misguided, and at worst, a fraud and a charlatan.

"U.S. Appalachians and S.W. Indian reservations, CA, MX, Japan,
Nigeria, Caribbean, Middle East. Been around enough to know that
your life is what u make out of it, and not what some1 gives to u."

See above. Now read this:
No one can "give you" a "life." And life is, indeed, "what u make out of 
it." It's a shame you have such a limited perspective on life. That the 
be-all and end-all goal is some nebulous concept of "success." I find you 
quite pitiable in that respect. I've traveled to many of the places you 
mentioned, and many others you didn't. Pray, did you learn anything? Or 
were you too focused on how "inferior" the lives of the people
you encountered were? Where in these places did you go? (Where in the 
Middle East? What indian reservation? What part of mexico? What section of

While I'd grant you are correct in this statement, I would like to attempt
to flesh it out a bit.  True, noone "makes" it without any outside help,
but there are varying degrees of aid.  For myself, I feel I can claim my
acomplishments as largely self-achieved.  Granted, I have the emotional
support of a woman and the occasional "grant" from relatives.  However,
with a mother somewhere in New England (don't ask me where) and a father
across seas (we don't speak), I feel justified in claiming my
accomplishments as my own.  Is it technically correct?  No.  However, the
misuse of the phrase seems an acceptable abuse of language.  It seems
there are varying degrees of aid one can receive, and after a certain
level of neglect a person can claim themselves independant for better or
for worse.

> It's a shame you have such a limited perspective on life.
> That the be-all and end-all goal is some nebulous concept of "success."

I'm having trouble finding anything wrong with this concept.  Perhaps we
just have different definitions of success in mind.  Success (from my
perspective) is doing what you do well.  Taking pride in your work and
striving to be the best at it.  Success itself is not a goal, it is a
description of how well and completely you've acheived your goal.  

For instance, I'd consider Ghandi's be-all end-all goal was success in his
goal to finding a non-violent solution to the British.  If success wasn't
an all consuming need, I don't think he would have had the strength to
acomplish his goals.  In that light, I'd view his obsession for success as
a merit, not a flaw. 

Perhaps the merit or lack thereof of an obsession for success lies less
with the obsession itself and more with the person's underlying goals.

"Self-satisfaction needn't be shallow."

Point is, it is *often* a shallow pursuit.  I won't argue whether it 
should or should not be such, as that gets into selfishness versus 
altruism; a real pit of snakes, that is.  But it seems to me that
the singular pursuits of one for the selfusually end up increasing the 
misery of another.

"....rather that I seek my pleasure on a higher level, and can even take 
pleasure in pain."

Then you are a rare case; most seek self-gratification on a mindless 
level.

Pain is evolutionarily successful because it teaches lessons.  I think 
that our brain is built to 'enjoy' pain on various levels, because it adds 
to our survival potential by being emotionally satisfying *and* giving an 
appropriate lesson.

I don't know about that. Go back beyond JFK to the times of the Robber
Barrons. Back then, you had to work your ass off for pennies a day and all
the rich really had all the power over us--even more than now. 43% of the
nations wealth was in the hands of 1% of the population. Without
government intervention in the formn of the antitrust act, it would have
been long before the entire nation was owned by 1 person. I thin freedom
would be in serious jeopardy in such a situation. 

YOu see, when Adam Smith first prescribed laissez farie economics in his
book, The Wealth of Nations, he thinking was that no one could ever win a
monopoly in a free economy--perhaps he was inspired by the way ecosystems
seem to balance themselves out. However, capitalism is a winnable game.
Just like social animals compete for dominance over their group,
capitalists compete for ultimate dominance over the human race. I think
with real laissez faire economics we would end up with a social system
like that of wild animals: one absolute leader with everyone competing for
his spot. freedom would suffer.

Ok, let's.

"You made the humiliating error of agreeing with Natalie about peace 
through anarchy.  *now listen this time!!!*"

First you are insulting Natalie by assuming that she has no right to speak 
her mind [even as Nat claims later that she never made such a statement].

Then you assume that I said, or agreed with, the statement "peace through 
anarchy," which you claimed to be false [regardless who said it].  I then 
said: "anarchy through anarchy."  You then said that there can be no such 
thing as peace associated with anarchy.  I then said: "Quit the bullshit; 
nobody knows what it would be like if anarchy existed, as noone has tried 
it."  I don't *know* whether peace can co-exist with anarchy; I can only 
speculate such.  You can only speculate, as well.

"The world...is in a state of disequilibrium...[and] has limited 
resources"

If the world is in a state of disequilibrium, evolution would probably 
never have progressed further than the basic amino acids and RNA, because 
life [as far as it has evolved] depends upon the multiple states
[variables: food, weather, population, etc.] of the world following a 
chaotic attractor, an equilibrium of sorts which follows in cycles.  This 
is not metaphysical bullshit either; you can find biological cycles on the 
molecular level, such as the Krebs cycle [prducing usable potential] and 
the Ornithine cycle [turning excess amino acids into excretable urine], 
all the way to a macro scale, such as the nitrogen cycle [where nitrogen 
funnels its way through the atmosphere and legumes and over again].  The 
original gene structure, stable enough to survive the primordial soup, was 
able to shape itself around the equilibrium of the world's thermodynamic 
states, taking advantage of what it could and evolving as it did into life 
as we know it today.

Resources is a funny word.  I am tempted to look upon this word in its 
original sense, that is, its economic definition, and say that the concept 
of "limited resources" only exists because we humnas are ignorant and do 
not know how to live within the cycles of life [or we don't want to?].  
Its probably enough to say that the world has so much of x, y, and z, and 
has made do for about 4 billion years, so why can't we do as Earth does?

"...this creates an imbalance that causes competition and killing..."

Your mistake is in looking at each competing animal as an entity in and of 
itself, killing for food.  You do not look at the genes [which we all 
have] which created the animal in the first place.  The genetic code is 
blind to your values system of "killing" and "competing;" it only sees 
food and the potential to reproduce itself when it gets that food.

Your morality is your own business, but that morality doesn't create any 
imbalance except in maybe the health of your mind.

"...if all the forces in the world were balanced, there would be no 
progress or change..."

Time for a little physics lecture, I think.  If you take a point charge at 
one particular equipotential, say +10V, and move it to an equipotential, 
say +5V, you've created an "imbalance" in the equation; you have to 
perform work to move that point charge to resolve the imbalance.  But if 
you move that charge at +5 back to +10, your *net* work done is zero.  The 
slate is wiped clean.  In order to facilitate my point, I'll expand the 
world to mean the universe.

In the universe, the total amount of energy is a constant; if you change 
gas into mechanical potential [i.e. your car], you don't get all the 
energy stored in the hydrocarbon molecule: you get say 20% and the rest is 
converted into heat, sound, etc. energy...but if you add up all the 
percentages of all the conversions, you get the original energy back.  
None is lost, it is converted.

If it were lost, you would have your "disequilibrium" and the law of 
conservation of energy wouldn't hold [perpetual motion machines would be 
possible].

Let's look at thermodynamics and more specifically entropy, to further my 
point.  The universe, as current theory holds, is running towards a heat 
death; entropy seeks order and order seeks entropy until the two converge 
at zero.  The universe, as a whole, has "entropy + order = 0" to work 
with.   Locally, on planet Earth, we are fortunate enough to be a local 
concentration of ordered energy.  This allows us to convert our higher 
forms of energy into heat + consumer products [moving cars, the cars 
themselves, etc.].  But taking the entire universe into consideration, we 
are an anomaly at best, with our pocket of order being turned into heat 
energy, the lowest form of energy.

So to make my point, change on our planet is possible, because we have 
ordered energy with which to convert into other things + heat.  But the 
balance remains; we cannot add energy to the equation...

"We are defined by the adversity and imperfection of life, and the limits 
it puts on us."

I believe that we define ourselves and our concepts of life, and not the 
other way around.  To do so implies a higher being.

No insult intended, but I'm not sure I'd call that wisdom.  Are you sure
Socrates didn't mean "Never assume you know everything, or you'll be
incapable of learning" as opposed to "you're hopelessly ignorant and will
remain feebleminded till death".  How long could our world support itself
if everyone decided they knew nothing and just sat down contemplating

Well, all the scientist would've went home long ago, so you wouldn't be

The point is, all these great philosophers who've ruminated on the
stupidity of humanity have done so with the patronage of those who are
willing to learn and work with the faculties they possess.

    1. Granted, *as far as we know* humans are the only salient beings on

       mindless and worth less than ourselves.  

    2. However, humans kill each other, sometimes for survival, but not 
       usually.  The Inquisition was instituted to kill those who 
       disagreed with the Catholic Church (and what a bastion of purity it 
       was.)  The Holocuast was intituted to wipe out anyone Hitler 
       didn't agree with.  (on a side note, isn't it ironic that 
       thousands of Christians were put to death by the Romans?  and that 
       once the Christians got on top they decided to wipe out everyone
       who disagreed with them?  including other christians...but I 
       digress.)

    3. Animals, on the other hand, USUALLY (there are some notable 
       exceptions) kill others to survive.  To defend what is theirs, to 
       eat, things like that.

    4. Therefore, there is balance in the animal world.  Animals do what 
       they must to survive, and humans do not, as a general rule.  Humans 
       have a nasty tendency to get in a position of power and then abuse 
       it. (the Church, the French Monarchy, even the United States)

Not sure what you're trying to say here. It made little sense in context.

"Point 1) You are right. Everyone in the U.S. ..." blah blah blah etc.

I'm not just talking about the US, my friend. It's not the only example. 
"Support" need not be monetary. You mention the Kalahari Bushmen; They 
survive because of the emotional support each clan member receives from 
others in the family unit. You're taking a very limited perspective again.

"... [the bushman] would tell you that it's us that haven't got the idea"

I agree. I don't think anyone has the "right idea." No, not even myself. 
I'm very much a relativist.

"So with all that's available to u, why are you standing ..." etc.

I'm not, dipshit. Never assume. I just said that I was unemployed, not 
that I was on the dole.

"Hahahaha...working and money are bad... now gimme the check"

Ignoring the assumption here, I will address another gross error. I merely 
said that I you seem to place so much on "success" (whatever that means to 
you), that you are ignoring the process. Life, if you will. Again, you are 
reading what you want to see, not what I wrote.

I didn't even mention work or money, neither of which are "BAD" (as you 
have tried to put those words in my mouth). 

"I didn't say their lives were inferior?"
And I didn't say I was on the dole, dumbass.

Next.

"Outside the US, ppl make their own lives."

Whadda crock o' shit. I frankly don't believe you learned much in your 
"travels" (though I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and presume they

on their own. Not monetarily, not emotionally, not socially. Noone. 
Because humans are *social* animals. *Not Solitary*. To survive we need 
food, water, and shelter, but to grow, we need social contact. Money can 
provide the first three, but there is no replacement for emotional

"There are no truly FREE gov types. Only differing degrees of oppression."

What's the difference between freedom and oppression? The concepts are 
transient at best. I think you've just slipped into the absolutist trap.

You mention anarchy, and how it curtails freedom by forcing moderation in 
behaviour. However, you fail to mention it "grants" the "freedom" to use 
your shotgun at will. By the same token, an absolute police state will 
curtail "freedom" by taking away said weapon, but then "grant" "freedom" 
from having to kowtow to some kook with a 10-gauge.

Back to the drawingboards....

Anarchy is a complex subject. It has a confusing nature about it--it is
nothing, yet is treated like an entity. I am flustered to define it, and
when one tries to, unbelievably impassible incongruities and disagreements
erupt. Who knows what would have happened with the Robber Barrons in
anarchy. I've even thought that we are ultimately in anarchy, but we humor
these political machines out of sheer laziness. Who knows?

1. You somehow managed to get this out of my post: "If we are promintent

I never said anything about animals being lesser than us.  That is your 
assumption.  As Zbadba said, don't make assumptions in a debate. Animals 
are different from us, not subservient.  Being different is not a bad 
thing, as you make it sound to be.  

2. If you will not, i said that there are notable exceptions to the 
general rule that animals don'tkill for the same reasons humans do.  
Primates are one example.  Chimpanzees have been known to hunt others of 
their kind in what seems to be a kind of war.  Also gorillas and macaques. 
Many predators (usually hte ones that treavel in packs) have social 
slystems.  Which include status.  Much like in human situations, the 
leadership of the group may be challenged and overthrown.  But you don't 
exactly see wildebeest or gazelles fighting with each other over who is

{Improper quotation technique and Misqoute!...}

I did misquote, but in effect you labeled me as an anti-Semite.  I will 
let the readers decide on that; as far as I can see, my misquotation 
affected the meaning of only the first part of the sentence: "the men old 
bankers, mainly jewish bankers...[men = mean]," changed to "that meant the 
old bankers, mainly jewish bankers..."

The meaning and intent of the second part of the sentence clearly accuses 
me of being anti-semitic.  You have this to answer for.

{BTW, get a real account}

And I told you to use your 191 I.Q. to do some easy research.  Any moron, 
yes, even you Spidey, can find out the truth.

{...the key word here is 'infrequently'}

Really?  Are you so sure of yourself to assume how I use my account 
privileges?  

So I use my school account during school, as I do not have legal access to 
my school dial-in, and I use a local BBS to telnet.  Very practical to me, 
and besides, I get to use my school account infrequently during the summer 
should the need arise.  Otherwise, why bother?

There, I've had to tell you.  You won't have to strain your brain anymore.

{I did [explain why Xela is wrong], over and over and over.}

Go back to your messages and re-read them.  Your claim is false; you'll 
find your insults instead.

I'll say it again: Stop wasting hot air and give me a logical 
counter-argument which is coherent and complete enough for me to attack.  
At least I do the same for you.

{EVERYBODY can't have something for nothing all the time...}

The Berliners seem to be getting by with their city transit system, which 
theoretically could be something for nothing.  Read up on it while you're 
working on that tan of yours in the Carribeans.

{BTW, 'Spiderman' scored some six figure EFTs...}

There are two points I'll make about this.

First, I could care less about your financial pursuits.  If you get 
bed-in-breakfast every morning and beautiful whores every night, great.  
Hell man, I'm even happy for you.  Hope you get cholesterol poisoning from 
the eggs benedict and VD from the sluts.  But that aside...

Second, you make a big deal about how you can't get something for nothing, 
then you brag about six figures from shuffling paper.  I can't wait to 
hear how you justify taking money for creating nothing of substance (more 
insults?).

Your point about how the chimp with the biggest balls wins only goes so 
far.  Will the evolution of chimps progress until male chimps have to drag 
their baggage with them?  Most likely not the case; you'll find that
statisically, what helps those genes reproduce will be found over a

Sorry Xela.  Have to jump in again.  Their is a flaw in your reasoning I
must point out.  Hopefully it'll clear up why you and arachnoi are not
agreeing on this point though.

In essence you've taken arachnoi's argument-

Nazi's are anti-semites. => Nazi's are bigots.

and assumed the inverse is true-

You are a bigot. => You are an anti-semite.

You've taken a conditional sentence, reversed the antecedent and
consequence and assumed that the inverse is true.

Logically, however, this is incorrect.  The only correct method 
available for reversing a conditional statement is by replacing the
propositions with their denials.  Or, assuming the contrapositive of the
conditional statement.

i.e. the only other statement which is true is:

~(You are a bigot) => ~(You are an anti-semite)

or 

You are not a bigot => You are not an anti-semite.

The structure is (p=>q)=(~q=>~p).

Plug some other propositions in and it'll look clear if it doesn't already.

Socrates searched Athens, asking everybody, and found that although nobody

(Due to the fact that "Semite" and "Semitic" are LANGUAGE based terms,

As for Socrates' words, I stand corrected.  Thank you for the well thought
out reply and my apologies.  Still, however, I find the exact meaning of
the words vague (or just wrong, from my point of view).  While it is true
that it is ignorant to presume you know everything, I find it unreasonable
to say that you know nothing.  I have 5 fingers.  This I know.  I consider
it a fact.  Impossible to prove maybe from the trendy pessimistic
philosopher's (those metaphysical idoits who try to claim that nothing can
be proven to exist) point of view, but still a rather childishly simple
observation.  To say that nothing can exist beyond knowledge of self is to
divorce oneself from reality.  You can stand in front of an active volcano
(to steal one of my favorite examples from Rand) and deny it's existence
all day, but it'll still kill you.

Ah, but once again, we come to a central theme of late: degree.
It's true, amny of these problems are prevelant already, but to what
degree.  Do you not see the likelihood of being shot tomorrow increasing
if the govt. was done away with.  The police don't do their jobs
perfectly, this is true (not that I blame them entirely for this problem
either).  However, how long do you think the L.A. riots would've lasted if
their weren't any such thing as law enforcement?  Granted, citizens might
have banded toghether to stop it, but what would have been the
consequences of that?  War in California?

{until the next adaptation comes along and makes big balls irrelvant, and 
chimps are pushed aside the evolutionary path for what comes next.}

My point about the big balls growing bigger was that at some temporal 
stage, there exists an equilibrium between having a particularly 
well-suited size balls for optimal reproduction and being able to drag 
those balls around.  The bell curve peak shows where peak ball size 
occurs, with bigger ball size detracting from the chimps ability to 
perform other life-duties, like food-gathering, tool-making, etc. and 
smaller ball size detracting from the chimps ability to spit out the most 
sperm, therefore reproducing to a lesser extent.  

This equilibrium, and its corresponding bell curve, provides insight to 
what we define as a 'species'.

I agree that evolution is a metastable equilibrium.  However,
when zoologists use Linnaeus' system of classification, they assume that, 
relative to the human lifetime, "species" are stable enough to survive 
classification.  There are approx. one million species of insects, and 
etymologists [I believe that is the correct word] speculate that there are 
millions more which have not yet been given a genus species yet.  This 
speculation in and of itself assumes that environmental conditions are 
stable enough for current species to exist [removing for the moment our 
involvement with altering our thermodynamic systems].

"...'The Selfish gene' is geared to the propagation of superior individual

If this is the case, pure selfishness would have been the singular game, 
or ESS, of the 'Prisoner's Dilemma.'  There would have never been the 
evolution of social behavior, which exists to propagate as many copies of 
one gene as possible [i.e. through cooperation]; this is the 
pareto-optimal result of Von Neumann's Prisoner's Dilemma, and 
statisically the most favored of all strategies, which is why, for humans, 
cooperative tendencies have been promoted above negative selfishness 
strategies: the environmental situation has chosen teamwork (for humans) 
because it works.

Maybe cooperation won't provide the biggest 'payoff' in the future, but 
that will depend upon the environmental situation we put ourselves in, and 
what strategies will be promoted by that environment [environment meaning 
resources for continued survival and reproduction].

The book most definitely does *not* point that out; that is a gross

then those genes (i.e. human genes, to use a tired example) will reproduce

genes, in order to copy itself to the highest degree.  When the

You are focusing on the individual, attributing its behavior to the 
individual and NOT the gene which created it.  Read the book again; the 
gene does whatever it can, either through individual or mass selection, to 
propagate itself to the higest degree.  This can include communal 
behavior, such as suicidal altruism (in the case of worker bees) which 
could hardly be selected on an individual basis.

I'll say it again: Read the friggin' book; you really did not get the

Why I am entering this fray I'll never know, but anyway:

Hitler derived a substantial amount of his "Aryan" gobbledegook from the 
actual Arians (NOT THE Christian Heretics) who conquered India around the 
time of the Rig Veda. He borrowed heavily from their sacred symbols, such 
as teh Swastika, and some of their more colorful myths, (Although I'd 
never heard the livestock fucking one before...new one on me.) and weaved 
in a lot of rascist, sexist, bigoted tripe that dirtied a perfectly good 
dead religon, and called it his Master Race theory. BTW, he hardly came up 
with it on his own, either...he simply wasn't that clever. He had dozens 
of full time psychologists, philosophers, scientists and others making 
this shit up for him. The one moted philiosopher he used (Which is ironic, 
because this man HATED anti-semites and racists, saying they were 
irrational, and he was right) was Nietzsche, but he was hardly the only 
person whose life work was distorted and twisted by Aryan Bullshit.

Xela, the truth is that FDR wasn't holding anything back in his aid to the 
Brits during WWII.  He was fighting tooth and nail to get the U.S. in the 
war!  He was fighting the ultra-isolationalist US Congress (shame on you 
old time GOP) to get into the fight.  He signed on at the Atlantic 
Conference without telling the Senate which had Constitutional authority 
to ratify the signing of treaties.  He unilaterally declared a naval war 
by giving the US fleet order to sink German U-Boats out to a [I believe] 
1000 mile limit.  A little outside our littoral waters, don't you think?  
He wanted a Pearl Harbor more than anything;  of course he wanted it from 
the Germans and was caught completely off guard by the Japanese.  He was 
itching for war.  
And yes, FDR wanted to spread capitalist dogma.  And he was very 
successful in doing so with Bretton Woods which has had the effect of 
causing the greatest explosion in economic development the world has ever 
seen.  Yes, FDR and then Truman are completely guilty in providing a 
monetary, trading, and development [this is where we get the IMF and World

would rather be under domination by the P.R.C. or the democratizing,

spoke the narration at the beginning and the end of the movie.  The movie

I view freedom as something that cannot be "total."  Freedom is something 
that cannot be total.  What would happen if all persons would have that 
total freedom ?  I do not trust all citizens to have the responibility to 
care for others.  I see citizens as basically the same way as Hobbes did 
in "Leviathan".  I look on government to control SOME of man's baser 
instincts.

I do not however see the govt role as pervasive.  I see a more 
Jeffersonian in nature.  If I choose to mind my own business, I want govt 
to leave me alone.  I fully ascribe to the antebellum politics of the 
"Old" Democratic party.  The states should be the ultimate authority on 
law and what is done for the citizens.  The federal govt should only 
provide for the common defense, tariffs and so forth.  This would be a 
strict constructionist view of our Constitution.

The present-day Republican Party are saying some of these same things.  
They propose that the states should take on more responsibility of 
providing fro their citizens.  The governors of these states, primarily 
Democratic, cry that they can not do that without federal help.  Where 
are we supposed to get the money from ?  I believe that we will eventually 
reach a saturation point when there will be no more resources to draw from 
and that govt will eventually take over EVERY aspect of our lives.  That 
is something I would resist to the every end.

Dear RobtELee-
I very much enjoyed what you had to say about true freedom.  To clear 
something up for me, I didn't quite understand your use of _Leviathon_ by 
Hobbes to justify the continuation of personal freedom.  If you view man 
as driven by the basest of desires, then why wouldn't you support them 
giving up their freedoms voluntarily to be managed by the state (in the 
large sense)?  If I read into it correctly, you view the fed. gov. as not 
a benign instrument of paternalism, but as a self-serving and expanding 
entity bent on fulfilling its own agendas regardless of beneficience.  So 
even though the people do not have the responsibility to handle their 
freedoms, they should not be "managed" by another entity, right?

As for being outside the reach of government, it is sad to see how far 
that reach has become.  I forget the President who said it, but they said, 
that it was a right for people to be left alone if they so choose.  

Again, thanks for the comments.

Try the libertarian party. they are as good as it gets in this country
regarding political parties. I so far approve of all the actions of the
libetarian party that i've seen to date, and i plan to vote mainly
libertarian in upcoming elections. 

Now, if you want to get into the philosophy of freedom, things get
overwhelmingly complex. do remember that freedom is a word in the english
language, and as such can be defined in almost anyway anyone wants to
define. For instance, if i want, i'm sure i could define the word
"freedom" as something you get through complete servitude if i wished.
It's hard to have a good discussion over word definitions.

First off...Didn't claim free will, claimed I made uncoerced decidions. 
Vast difference. Nobody FORCED me to decide as I have. I made those 
choices without undue (Undue, meaning no more than reasonable) influence 
from anyone. That isn't the same thing as saying I have Free Will. 
(I do, but that post in particular wasn't saying that.)

pixy,
You are claiming that anything but a determinist insterpretation is wrong? 
Modern physicists and philosophers of science seem to think that quantum 
mechanics leads us to understand the universe as based on truly 
indeterminate characteristics. I wrote my senior paper on Quantum 
Mechanics and Probability Theory, so if you would care to enlist evidence 
to support your view I would be happy to look at it. 

Determinism went out with Newtonian Mechanics.

There are more important things than freedom.  Freedom is a myth, anyway, 
as pixy has noted.  We perpetrate a lot of injustices in the name of 
"freedom."  Perhaps our society would be healthier if, instead of freedom, 
we prized things like "duty," responsibility," "fair play," or 
"tolerance."

Freedom serves as justification for a lot of the problems that our nation 
faces like greed (the freedom to make all the money I want, no matter who 
I hurt in the process), violence (the freedom to kick somebody's teeth in 
if they deserve it), selfishness (the freedom to look out for my own 
interests, and to hell with everybody else), need I go on?

People get involved in politics for lots of reasons, but the search for 
"freedom" is not a particularly political goal.  Politics isn't about the 
individual so much as it is about collective bargaining, getting along, 
building a society, working together.  And that's what's wrong with 
"freedom."  Freedom, as a national Ideal (which it is in America), is 
pulling us apart at a time when we desperately need to be pulling 
together.

Xela,
I repent. I was a little brash to put the nails in the coffin of 
determinism. I have read Bell's Theorem and it intrigues me. If follows 
more the line of reasoning that Einstein followed - realism. 

But still, if I could apply Feynman's theorem to the Bell theorem I think 
that I can still call for a basic unknown at the quantum level. The 
strange thing about the jump from quantum reality to the macro world we 
live in is that physicists still don't know where the transition between 
the two realities takes place. If we stick to the quantum level there is 
still no "place" that quantum things like electrons are. The problem 
occurs when we observe them, like in the Bell experiment. Observation 
always makes them look like particles. But in between observations, which 
change what it going on, they act like waves. So we do an experiment of 
observation and, by doing so, we influence what we are seeing. So the Bell 
theorem is something of a paradox. We don't know (read random) until we 
observe at which time we change what is going on and then we say that it 
is determinate. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, as demonstrated in the 
Airy experiment shows us that we do not have real waves but only waves of 
probability. Is the cat in the box dead or alive? (ie. Schrodinger's cat).

Still, all of this does not give us a hint into  other kinds of quantum 
phenomena like predicting the break down of radioactive substances. You 
cannot predict when a given atom will go, or exactly where a photon pack 
will be absorbed in the atmosphere. And it is not just because we do not 
have enough information, but because they are truly random events. And if 
there are truly random events in the universe, then there is at least the 
possibility that I can enjoy some freedom.

Thanks for not letting me be too hasty in my conclusions. The only way i 
keep my intellectual integrity is to have people around who are willing to 
point out where I am wrong.

Even with the inherent paradoxes of 20th century physics, it may be that

There was a great quote from a book I read, where a Buddhist monk,

You have to differentiate between the NVA and the Cong.  As for glorifying

stayed in the field as long as it did unless the steady flood of material 
continued unabbated through the surrounding waters.  The big stink over 
mining Hanoi was the possibility of sinking a Soviet cargo ship or two and 
sparking an even larger war (this one played out on a global scale).

Oh my--you're so smart. Look at all the technical blabber and showboating
you can do. I'm semi-impressed. 

I always like to hear what the fringe of modern science is coming up with.
Do keep me up to date with it all. However, in all your avant-garde
scientific thinking, I think you have lost touch with the fundamnentals. 

Some things never change and such is the case with modern science. There
is always a language science communicates in: logic or reasoning. It
always has and always will. Why? I don't know. It just is. Science and
logical reasoning are integral. 

Logic, I believe, is also the language of life. People simply can't be
illogical. Logically, everything we do is based on a action/reaction(yes,
it is very newtonian, but stoop to my level for a sec) relationship.
Everything we do is either us causing action or us reacting to it. Causing
action means to me that we would be making something( an action)
arbitrarily, out of nothing. Does the avant garde still believe in the
laws of conservation? 

Anyway, don't take this all the wrong way. I'm not just trying to argue,
though arguing is great fun. I would like to look at the concept of free
will and logic more closely. There are some very big questions in logic.
What dictates logic anyway? 

Aye, now there's the rub...

What doesn't change?  The truth for one.  Your mind changes because we are
imperfect creatures with incomplete senses.  Our perceptions of the truth
change over time because we gain more or better evidence.  The truth,
however, remains constant.  i.e. we used to think the world was flat, now
we don't.  The truth was always that the earth was round (or pretty much
so, for you physicists out there), our perception was simply incorrect.

This same analysis holds true for arguments.  While people hold different
perceptions of the "truth", there is only one.  This is why it is so
important to debate and argue.  Since our perceptions and knowledge are so
pathetically incomplete, it is advantages to "pool" toghether our stores
of knowledge and evidence to try to peer more closely at the truth.

Of course, this is not valid for all arguments.  Discussions of right and
wrong have no truths (unless you pull the age old "God said it, so it's
true" crap and toss all rational and understanding out the window for a
nice smothering dose of ignorance and religion).  Discussions of ethics,
bad and good are all subjective.  That is, they are man made constructs
which have no physical meaning and, therefor, no fundamental truths.

"Your mind changes because we are imperfect creatures with imcomplete

Could very well be.  Physicsts are filling libraries these days with paper 
upon paper of multi-dimensional (hyperdimensional) explanations unifying 
fundamental forces up to ten dimensions.  We can't envision a dimension 
higher than three (yet? well, shadows of dimensions anyway) but what is to 
say that higher dimensions do not exist?  Like you said, we used to think 
the world was flat, i.e. 2D, and now we consider it 3D.  Its sort of like 
explaining color to a blind man; just can't do it.

But then, envisioning higher dimensions is only done to simplify what 
would otherwise be very clumsy and ugly mathematical equations describing 
the universe(s?), so (matematical) logic, to a degree, relies on 
fundamental assumptions that higher dimensions (if they even exist at all, 
proof which will take centuries if not millenia to find) behave in the 
same manner as the "three" dimensions we have defined (created).

Arguing whether "logic" and "reason" can bring about fundamental truths 
requires the acknowledgement that both are based on *variable* senses.

Nietzsche suggested that all human understanding (that which we think we 
know) is a product of our symbolic systems.  For example, mathematics is a 
symbolic system which dictates a certain logic (the laws of science, and 
others, the basic principles of mathematics.)  Language is a symbolic 
system as well.  It also dictates a certain logic.  Nietzsche said that we 
believe that we exist because we have a 1st person pronoun, I.  Because of 
the existence of "I" in the symbolic system, he said, we are capable of 
thinking in terms of our own existences.

By the way, the words "logic" and "language" both are derived from the 
same greek root (logos) as Heidegger demonstrated in his essay in _Early 
Greek Thinking_.  Essentially, logic and language are the same thing.

This way of understanding logic answers a lot of the questions that have 
been posed on this board.  We are only now becoming capable of "believing" 
in 10 demensional universes because our symbolic system (mathematics) can 
now account for 10 deminsions in a way that at one point was unthinkable.  
In other words, the symbolic system, and all its new advances (chaos 
theory, etc.), is changing the way that we see the universe.  The universe
hasn't changed.  Our symbolic system has, and thus, so has our
understanding of the universe.

So why can people arrive at different answers to the same question?  
Kenneth Burke demonstrates that the measure of a "well-rounded" symbolic 
system is its capacity to account for contradiction.  English, as a 
symbolic system, is extremely well-rounded.  With it we can explain almost 
any phenomenon, justify almost any action.  Contradiction is part and 
parcel of how a symbolic system works.  And a symbolic system only works 
insofar as it can account for contradiction.

More fuel for this fire is forthcoming.

So what does all of that mean.  It means that "truth" is a function of our 
symbolic systems.  "Truth" doesn't exist "out there" in the real world, as 
we believe, but in us, as it is created by our symbolic systems.  Kant 
demonstrated this in his _Critique of Pure Reason_.

For example, consider the concept of the square.  Square is a product of 
geometry, a human-created symbolic system.  No square exists in the real 
world.  Anything close to a square, if measured with an exact
enough measuring devise will be found to fall short of our definition of 
"square."  There simply are no perfect 90 degree angles outside of our 
minds.  The "truth" of square, exists only as a product of our symbolic 
systems, not as a product of "reality."

As far as science and the world go, one can easily see that science 
doesn't discover real world "truths," at least not affirmative truths.  
Science discovers only negative truth.  For example, consider the 
discussion of the flatness/roundness of the world.  Science has 
demonstrated, quite convincingly, that the world is NOT flat.  But it 
can't tell us what shape the world actually IS.  Maedhros, in his 
comments on this subject, admitted that the world wasn't round.  It's only 
"almost" round.  The symbolic system, mathematics, is incapable of 
describing what the world IS.  It can only demonstrate that our symbolic 
systems (which dictate flatness/roundness/squareness) are wrong.  In this 
sense, science is self-defeating.  While it attempts to discover
"truth," what it does, in effect, is demonstrate how "truths" that we
previously believed are false.

Then, scientists postulate new theories which attempt to explain what was 
previously understood, but found to be false.  And the scientists 
recognize that they haven't found "the truth."  That's why their ideas are 
called "theories," or possible explanations.  The history of science can 
be seen as an endless series of theories, all of which are probably false. 
 At least, it is reasonable to assume that every theory will eventually be 
proven to be false.  Most scientific theories have gone this route, and 
it's only reasonable to assume that all the theories we currently believe 
will fall when their time comes.

"Truth," then, is a product not of the real world or of the universe, but 
of our symbolic systems which dictate how we see the universe.  And our 
truths are necessarily false, for the symbolic system, no matter how 
"well-rounded" can never truly represent the real world.  The symbolic 
system will always fall short of capturing the essence of the universe.  
All a symbolic system can really understand is itself.  All we can really 
"know" is ourselves.  The truths that we believe in have more to do with 
us than with the external world.

Timidly awaiting the onslaught.

Not the old immigrant argument again!

The vast majority of the people that come to the US come here  not for 
"freedom" but for economic opportunity.  We, the US, are the wealthiest 
nation on earth.  The poor people know it, and they want a slice of the 
pie.  That's why they come here, not for "freedom."

Examples:  Lots of nations around the globe have similar freedoms to those 
of Americans.  Few of them are experiencing the kind of immigration that 
the US is dealing with.  Most of the Hatians that are flooding into our 
refugee camps are not political exiles, but poor people who want a better 
life.  Sure, they'll claim political oppression, but that's not the main 
reason for their flight.  Or, for another example, consider the case of 
Germany.  When it reunified, tons of East Germans flooded across the 
border into the West.  Why?  After unification these people had the same 
freedoms as West Germans, so why did they leave?  They left because 
economic conditions in West Germany were better.  And this is the same 
reason that immagrants are now coming, and will continue to cone, to the 
US.

So don't go waving the flag and spouting off about freedom.  Canadians 
have as many if not more freedoms than we do, but they don't have our 
immigration problems.  We have our immigration problems precisely because 
we spout off about freedom.  Fewer immigrants would come to the US if they 
knew that screaming about political oppression wouldn't get them anywhere.
But they'll keep coming, because they know that all they have to do is say 
"I'm oppressed," and we'll open our doors to them.  Our heavy investment 
in the notion of "freedom" works against us, in this case, and in many 
others.

Let's see, last year the Federal government spent about $1.4 trillion 
dollars.  Of that, @ $1.1 trillion dollars was allocated to non-defense
related expenses.  Among these are paying off the interest on the national 
debt, social security, medicare/medicaid, aid to families with dependent
children, bailing out the failing S&L's, and federal disaster relief.
From my perspective, very little of this has anything to do with 
protecting our freedoms.  What the government does, primarily, is to see 
that we all get along, to insure domestic tranquility, by taking care of 
those that our society does not protect without the aid of the government. 
This is not authoritarian, nor is it totalitarian, it's a social reality.  
It's good politics.

Consider the state governments, if you like.  Most of their money is spent 
on education.  Education is a form of social engeneering, from the bottom 
up.  It's effective, and I think, it's what governments should do.  Now, 
having said this, I think it's also good for the government to protect our 
freedoms, but this is not really the government's forte.  That's why 
Jefferson insisted on the bill of rights.  He knew that a strong 
government is not a very good tool for protecting freedoms.  Governments 
aren't about "freedom;" they're about negotiation, compromise, and social
control.  They're about "getting along," and that's not such a bad thing, 
is it?

IMHO you are quite on target. I would only like to point out a couple of 
minor details that you could hone.
you said,
>"Truth" doesn't exist "out there" in the real world, as we believe, but 
>in us, as it is created by our symbolic systems. Kant demonstrated this 
>in his _Critique of Pure Reason_.

Something seems wrong here. Is Kant's demonstration supposed to be the 
truth? All I think you can affirm is that truth is a part of our symbolic 
systems, not that it is created by our symbolic systems. That would be a 
"logical" error if I am not mistaken. You have denied in your premise what 
you were intending to deny in your conclusion. What I mean is something 
along the lines of -umm- you assume what you conclude. 

If that doesn't make sense, I'll try again later. Just let me know.

You also said,
>Science only discovers negative truth.

I prefer the work of Karl R. Popper in _Conjectures and Refutations: The 
Growth of Scientific Knowledge_.  He opts for Falsifiablility rather than 
negative demonstration. He gives several good illustration in the book. If 
you haven't read it you might give it a try. 

Feel free to disagree with me.

Well, what about the Michelson-Morley experiments which showed that the 
speed of light is independent of the speed of the measuring device?  
Surely a concept we come up (speed of light) with, that doesn't change 
when the experimental conditions do change, must have some consistency 
which we can call Truth?

Laelth-
I looked through my old post and could not once find the word "immigrant" 
in the body of its text.  Nor did I ever state that immigration to the 
U.S. was entirely made up of those seeking more liberties.  What I did 
state, however, was over a billion people now live under the control of 
authoritarian or totalitarian states.  The club of liberal democracies is 
still small and tenuous.  
Even amongst this "club", no other state enjoys the same amount of 
freedoms.  A prime example is found in the use of executive orders to 
limit the freedom of the press in the U.K.  Or in the rationing of 
educational resources in Germany.
As for immigrants coming to the U.S. solely for economic betterment, you 
must look at causality.  The U.S. has achieved its economic condition 
throughout the nation's history exactly because the freedoms it has 
allowed its citizens.  No where else offers the potential for a person or 
group of persons to become entrepeneurs.  They are given the freedom to 
put their money on the line and, if they work hard and the market so 
deems, reap the rewards of their risk.  The freedom to profit is a 
powerful incentive that has seen the rise of the Carnegie, Pullman, and in 
our time Gates.  It is because of our freedoms that we know that our 
rights to property, fair taxation, and freedom from persecution that we 
can achieve the fullest of our potential.

Laelth-
As the humorist P.J. O'Rourke once wrote in _Rolling Stone_ magazine, 
modern American politics are broken down into two groups.  Those who 
believe gov. should be a patriarchial figure and those who belive it is a 
benevolent Santa Claus (complete with red nose, big smile, and that bowl 
full of jelly figure).  It all boils down to this;  strong armed 
paternalism is inherently undemocratic.

It is nice to view government as a dispassionate referee in the lives of 
its nation's citizens.  When disputes erupt it steps in to ensure social 
cohesion and in the end we all sit down with a cold coke and live in 
harmony.  

By granting government overseer rights to society and our freedoms we open 
up a Pandora's box of problems.  If government exists to take care of 
those that our society does not protect (see post) then who does 
government decide should or should not be protected.  The Senate is made 
up of millionaire white males in their sixties and seventies.  What if 
they decide they, and their ilk, have been unfairly treated and use their 
new powers for their own betterment.  Or do they help one group at the 
expense of another?  And how far do they intervene?

You stated that governments aren't about protecting freedoms but are about 
negotiation, comporomise, and social control.  What exactly is "social 
control"?  I assume it is when something arises that threatens the 
stability of the status quo.  If, say, a proportionately small group 
grasps upon an idea considered radical or threatening to the majority and 
inturn causes social strife (violence, disturbances of everyday life) then 
this problem would have to be stopped and the radicals put down by the 
government.  Try to use this social control argument to Martin Luther 
King.  Under measures of social control, the civil rights movement would 
have been crushed for a supposed common good.  Under the guise of social 
control, LBJ used terror tactics on anti-war demonstrators during the 
Vietnam era;  breaking a plethora of laws set up to protect the liberties 
of U.S. citizens.  

You go on to state that the government should take an active role in 
socially engineering the lives of its citizens (education was the example 
you gave).  The government would choose which value system it would teach 
to generations of its citizens, crafting them into the image of its 
choosing.  It could not teach ideas or concepts that were contradictory to 
the nature of the regime.  This is McCarthyism of the mind at its 
greatest.  America was the first state to allow a very fundamental 
freedom;  the freedom to hold unfavorable opinions.  How would the 
government choose to mold its citizens?  Could it tell a group of people 
that it was not ready for the responsibility of full political 
participation and reinforce it through a minimum of twelve years 
indoctrination in the school system?  Could it also tell this group that 
they were too fragile and their being too pure to enter into the ugly 
arena of politics.  Sounds familiar?  It should be, it was the
 argument used by opponents to women's suffrage in the late 1800's on the 
s
floor of the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.  What if they 
had had the power to enforce their beliefs through social control?  

The Founders believed in a land where people had the freedom to think for 
themselves without official coercion.  Coercion, even wrapped in a velvet 
glove, is still coercion.  Government is not Santa Claus.  Vigilance in 
the face of losing one's freedoms must be eternal.

You are assuming Truth (with a capital T) is connected with Meaning, which 
is an inherent human creation.  If that's the case, then the whole 
argument about Absolute Truth, ad nauseum, falls flat on its face.  My 
point in bringing up the absoluteness of speed of light is the following: 
no matter how we measure speed of light, whether we increase the speed of 
the measuring device, or attach different units to the S.O.L., it will 
remain a *constant*, which *was* shown mathematically by Einstein.

For example, I showed mathematically how Einstein arrived the time 
contraction tenet of his theory, which shows that the units we use (i.e. 
the attachment to meaning) are independent of the time contraction effect 
which results from approaching the speed of light.  Check early posts in 
Mind Games; the math work is there. 

Regardless of the meaning we attach to light speed, it remains a constant. 
 Its experimental consistency is something which I would consider Truth.

Please, go back and read the posts about a thousand back or so on the
founding fathers and the indians.  If you have anything to add to the
argument, great, but please read it first.

As for your handle...I'd call that a poor choice of names to defend
freedom and liberty with.  I assume you borrowed it as a derivative from
Quetzalcoatl.  A Central American Indian deity.  As was discussed earlier,
the Central American indians are NOT something you want to compare with
the founding fathers, they make Hitler look like a boyscout.  Snake
worship, human sacrifice, despotism, slavery...etc., ad naseum...

The founding fathers weren't all that great, admitted.  However, anything
was better than the previous rule.

Also, as has been mentioned frequently, morality is subjective.  If you
put any political group from the 17th or 18th century in comparison with
current moral standards (at least in this part of the world), yes they'll
look like shit.  You must compare them to other elements which existed at
the time to properly contrast their RELATIVE enlightenment.  I have no
doubt we'll look like ignorant, racist, fascist bastards to others in a
couple hundred years, so be sparing on the forefathers :)

*grin*
You're thinking in 3d.  You can only think, sense and abstract in 3
dimensions.  The supposition is that there's other directions besides up,
down, left, right, forward and backwards.  It MUST be expressed
mathematically since you can't sense it and neither can your
instrumentations because you've only built them to measure in three
dimensional space.  If it helps, picture time as the fourth dimension.  We
sense it in a very limited sense (we can experience it, but are not able
to move freely through it).  If I decided to move backwards, I'd have to
alter my path through time by 180 degrees.  Parallel would lie at 90
degrees.  Don't ask me what the hell moving parallel through time is like,
I haven't the foggiest :)

Perhaps Xela can fill in that one (theoretical physicists have an
unlimited imagination :)

Great explanation!

One thing though.  Time IS the fourth dimension.  For the rest of the 
other dimensions, it has always been my opinion that we should employ the 
economy principle.  Being that we can niether sense nor detect them, that 
they are not necessary considerations.  It's great entertainment for 
theoretical mathematicians and writers of Science Fiction novels but 
otherwise there is very little point in studying any dimensions higher 
than the fourth at this stage in our evolutionary developement. Until we 
can understand the dimensions that we can sense, we haveno hope of truly 
understanding anything in N-space.

ONe more thing...moving parallel to time or in time?  I don't think so.  
:)
Actually my own theory on the matter is that time acts a lot like the 
Riemannian model...you know...kinda spherical.  I think that our 
understanding of it is limited to a circle on shpere (that which we are 
aware of as the passage oftime) and that the diameter of the circle is a 
representation of or rather and indication of the age of the universe. 
In other words, if you were to complete a revolution around the circle you 
would have passed through the beginning and ending of the universe (I 
believe in the Big Bang and the Big Crunch)

I'd be happy to hear any opionions on my theory.  I'm no physicist just a

You are correct in pointing that out, and I apologize for not giving his
argument more credit.  It's just that this subject was brought up last
year (and is available still to anyone who backtracks through this group a

The point to be brief is that it's not our actions.  You didn't give the
indians the short end of the stick and I certainly didn't ride with
Custer.  One of the basic premises of our legal system is that you cannot
be tried for your ancestors crimes so I find the argument to be
irrelevant.  Hell, if I didn't, I'd be going after the Mongols for
invading Germany.  There comes a time when you've just got to give the
past a rest and stop rehashing it to try to gain public sympathy or
denounce someone's great-great-great grandparents.

ancestors treatment of the indians.  We're not invading them.  It's a
whole lot simpler than that.  We don't like them, so we don't trade with
them.  It seems we should be aloud that perogative.

Arachnoid-

Thank you for the post.  You are correct about the decay of the native 
civilizations in the Americas.  I believe that the story that struck my 
attention the most was of an Aztec ritual during the end of their empire.  
The priest king would skin a prisoner of war alive then climb inside what 
was essentially steaming human pajamas as a climax to the ceremony.  I 
don't remember Ben Franklin ever doing something like that.

Arachnoi, Arachnoi, Arachnoi. You happen to be half right. Yes, they

as each new science developed a new Methodology, they amicably split. But 
to say Philiosophy went down a dead end is to say that who we are, what we 
think, our emotional and metaphysical selves and beliefs are also a dead 
end. It is saying that developing a world-view is meaningless, 
thatconsidering your actions and their affects on yourself and others is 
trivial, and that the mind of God (*If She exists*) is a mis-step on a 
path to a cold, sterile machine-birtheed prominatory where nothing matters 
that can't be codified and date-stamped or programmed.

If you want to live there, go ahead. I can't stop you. Using Philosophy as

Hey now an invasion comes before a war.  We don't have wars with third
world countries.  How can you have a war with a bunch of farmers armed
with hoes.  It's just a little police action :)

In all seriousness though, you're right of course.  I was getting a little
lazy indefining my point.  I meant to illustrate more the fact that we're
not into imperialism anymore.  Central America's a fuzzy argument, because
we're being forced into the situation (in Haiti at least, Cuba just pisses
us off).  It's hard to ignore them when they boat over everyday bitching

Well, besides making us feel macho and justifying our ridiculous military

Like I said, I feel that we're being forced to deal with the situation. 
Besides, Clinton's not doing that bad on the grand scheme of things (for a

The short of the matter is that no men are created equal.  It's a pipe
dream.  Everyone is born into a family and they inherit some of that
families advantages or lack thereof.  Fair has nothing to do with it. 
It's just the roulette of birth.  

As I said before, should I seek reparations from the Mongols? I am of
German descent.  Or is that different because WASP's are doing just
hunky-dory now.  

If it's no different, then I'm sure everyone can find someone down the
line who screwed there ancestors.  I think every race on the planet could
find someone to sue.

On the other hand, if I'm not entitled, why?

1.  My race is doing ok now.  So, because I've recovered, I no longer
deserve recompense?  Is racial justice kind of like social security?

or

2.  That happened too long ago.  It seems kind of odd that people are
entitled to recompense for there ancestors suffering, yet there's a
statute of limitations.  Should we set the limit at say two centuries?

Is there a third reason that I'm perhaps missing, why I'm not entitled to
something as well.

that our entire universe is actually a centre of a Black Hole singularity

another universe which is the member of another group of infinite

Correction!  Modern physicists tell us that they don't know what's inside
of a black hole because of the fact that they can't see them.  For all we
know...baby universes could be forming within a black hole. (Not likely
though because observations show that as a black hole gives off energy,
and they do but it's too complicated to get into for explanations, just
read Stephen Hawking's "A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME" for a full idea, it loses
mass and as a result it's conceivable that they can evaporate...wouldn't
matter though 'cause the time it would take to evaporate would exceed the
projected age of the universe!)

Not wuite true.  Our real beef is with communism, not socialism. Britain,
one of our staunchest allies, is socialist.  Additionally, our system
embraces many ideals of socialism (i.e. social security, price
regulating).  Of course, as many on the board will be quick to point out
to me, we've never actually seen a communist nation.  The militocracies
and totalitarian regimes that claim the title hardly do the system
justice.  I don't think the Soviet Union or Cuba is quite what Marx had in
mind.

It's important to note the circumstances the US was in when they issued
that approval.  There would have been no US if slavery hadn't been
condoned.  Actually, most all, if not every one, of the forefathers you
mentioned were against slavery.  However, without the support of the 
plantation owners in the South, the US would have never been.  It was a
concesion made in a desperate time, which was later rectified.

Besides, this doesn't prove we were worse than the indians.  At best, it
might be a small step towards proving we were as bad.

I've just been sitting on the sidelines watching this one, but now I think 
I'll speak up... Speaking from experience (I've actually lived on a 
Kibbutz) they are, in fact, communist. At least most of them are, a few 
are capitalistic, although most of those are inhabited by Americans. 
Everything, including living quarters, work, food, and profit is shared by 
everyone. It is Marx's ideas adapted to fit in with the world: the kibbutz 
itself is communist, but as a body it has capitalistic goals (ie making a 
profit) so that it can remain in existance. For that matter, the entire 
state of Israel is very socialistic. The only real democracy there is that 
there is an elected representation of the people as the government. Each 
citizen understands his place in the country and fulfills it willingly. 
(With a few exceptions). Israel was founded based on a communist system 
that was set up by David Ben Gurion and the other Halutzim (pioneers) who 
fought to make it a state.

What if someone were of Scottish or Irish blood?  These are two peoples

YOu are absolutely correct.  The U.S. has never had a problem with states 
being democratic/socialist in nature.  A large percentage of NATO states 
fit into this category.  In the U.S. we have anything but a capitalist 
economy.  We have a mixed system (although still leaning more to the 
classical left) like those of Europe.

In the Cold War we really didn't have a problem with totalitarian or 
authoritarian states; AS LONG AS THEY WERE OUR TOTALITARIAN OR 
AUTHORITARIAN STATES.  In the world-wide anti-Soviet (not anti-communist) 
crusade the U.S. utilized an alliance system which included repressive 
non-democratic governments ranging from South Korea (they weren't always 
democratic by any means), Cuba (before Castro), Panama, Phillipines, 
Zaire, Chile (under Pinochet), etc, etc.

Xela-

All states undergo development at differing speeds.  While it is true that 
Mexican labor earns vastly inferior wages to their US counterparts, it is 
because of the forces of market economics. 

Labor rates follow several factors.  Two offhand are the supply of labor 
and the technical sophistication of labor.  The supply of labor in Mexico 
is very high especially in urban areas.  The PRI tried to solve this 
problem with import substitution industrialization.  Essentially they kept 
out foreign products, built their own of everything to meet the demands of 
their consumers.  The end result were cars built half as well as foreign 
autos and prices twice as high.  Because these industries were heavily 
subsidized, the government was running tremendous deficits (yet another 
story).  For the last six years or so Mexico has thrown off its barriers 
and is experiencing very good growth.  It is an attractive venue for 
foreign investment and is rapidly overcoming the pains of systematic 
economic transition (as being experienced to a far worse extent in 
Russia).  As more foreign investment occurs and internally enough venture 
capital is accumulated, a greater demand for labor occurs.  As the demand 
increases so will wages.  It must be remembered that England was furious 
at the low cost of labor in the U.S. in the early 1900s and considered it 
an unfair advantage in production.  What comes around, goes around.

Wages are also determined by the skill level of your work force.  One 
reason the manufacturing of clothes and shoes is done in extremelyy 
underdeveloped 3rd World states is because the largest factor of 
production resides in labor (unskilled, dangerous, menial labor at that).  
Most 3rd world and now 2nd world states do not have the skilled workforce 
to manufacture high or middle tech goods.  It is absurd to think of air 
craft being designed, manufactured, and assembled (with the ability to 
compete with WEstern aircraft) in places like Bangladesh and Pakistan.  
Those labor forces with marketable skillss can demand higher wages from 
employers.

You can all wake up now.  I apologize for the length of this post.

That's extremely debateable.  However you are right.  Our understanding of 
black holes would indicate that a the matter would be torn appart by it's 
very graitational forces that make it up.  However, matter does exist with 
the black hole in elementary states and the matter within that hole is 
constantly approaching the line of singularity (the centre of the 
black hole) but it takes so long for this all to happen that it is best to 
practically ignore the effects.  

Lets' just assume however that all the matter within the black hole were 
to be at the line of singularity, then there would be a great 
implosion/explosion which would reslult in the formation of the universe! 

Now all you have to do is apply the anthropic priniciple and say that

I've enjoyed our debates about space-time and stuff and I just wnated to 
make a comment on the linearness of time.  I don't know if anyone of you 
read this before but this is my own theory and I would be happy to engage 
in debate about it's validity.

Time is spherical (like the earth)  We are on the great circle of time.  
ie, we are moving along in a straigh line along a geodesic course through 
time.  For all intents and purposes, time is linear to us because we have 
yet to discover a way to measure time relativley.  We know that if one 
travels at close to the speed of light that time slows down fo him/her as 
a function of gamma, a variable defined by the ratio of the velocity and 
the speed of light and it's square root.  (not going to put the actual 
equation down, it should be in most hs physics books under relativity)

Well if time is tryly linear then it should not slow down if you mover 
faster, unless of course you were to move to a different part of the 
sphere and travel on a relatively parrallel course (time would not stop 
but would slow down for theindividual travelling at the parrallel course).

This would indicate therefore that if you were to go through time long 
enough you would end up at the same point in time as you left and that 
time would repeat itself.  I don't see this as that far fetchged being 
that it has been said that if yopu were to trave l through space long 
enough you would end up back at the same point you left from.  In both 
cases, however, the distances that you have to travel are so vast (and the 
time you have to live through is so vast) that the universe would longcome 
to an end before you ever get back to your point of embarkation.  Unless 
of course you slow yourself down to negative the speed of light and 
catapult yourself forward through time (that's just another theory)

This theory is not based on mathemathetical reasoning just plain imformed 
imagination.  Thanx for taking the time to read it.

Hawkings)

How do you know that time is not being fueled by space and vice-versa?
The spherical nature of time(not circular) is not that impossible and idea 
and if it was it wouldn't be for the reasons you give.  Black holes do 
exist and they are perfectly shperical when not acted upon by other 
gravitational forces.  It is therefore not inconcievable that time could 
act in the same manner.  

Time is something we simply have no complete understanding of.  Our 
measurement of time in itself is imperfect and impresise.  We only travel 
along the great circle of the shpere of time without truly understanding 
the goings on that's occuring.

I wasn't saying that we shouldn't use our imaginations.
I was saying that we shouldn't let our imaginations lead us astray.

The point I was trying to make about the possibilities of multiple 
universes and the pointlessness of trying to figure them out was this:

It is not obserevable.  You mentioned the uncertainty principle and that's 
part of it.  The more we try to know about one thing the less we are going 
to know about the other.  I say that we focus on trying to understand the 
observeable universe andnot so much on working on proving the unecessary.

I think it would be real cool if we would use our imaginations and apply 
them to science and not science-fiction.

The main thrust of what I was saying is that industry, like parasites and 
predators, prey on the weak.  More specifically I am talking
about developing countries with little to no industrial infrastructure and 
an economically and educationally impoverished populace.  

Cheap labour, low taxation by the whoring government, free rein to pollute 
and otherwise exploit the situation of the lower class.  Sounds pretty 
good to a multinational corp looking to maximize riches in the hands of a 
few.  Can't beat it, right?

To me though, it all comes back to the main Prostitute: the State.  It 
encourages all this shit by various enticements and incentives.  But in 
the end, it's a suicide pact.  This country, which is already headed 
towards third world status, in terms of general welfare of the *entire* 
population (not just the upper and middle classes) when looking at, for 
example, the death rate od children (which is steadily increasing) and the 
per capita income.  Soon a worker will get taxed to death, working a 
minimum wage, temporary job with no medical or fringe benefits, seeing his 
children go without a quality education because we aren't willing to put 
up the money now to maintain our lavish lifestyle.  This is the fault of 
both a fat government run by old, rich, white folk and the collaborative 
efforts of corporations to downsize (oh excuse me, the term is 
"right-size;" political correctness has even reached industry, surprise, 
surprise).  Then, after poor people just can't afford to be intimidated 
and lulled into shit work, the power structure will collapse, leaving the 
investors and the politicians up shit creek.

Well, there's my view on American Labour as it stands today. 

It may be a little one-sided :), but it's based on models of 
power-structure maintenance of which I've read about in the early years of 
the Nazi Regime and also my experiences in this day and age.

If there is anything one can count on from government, is that it follows 
in the footsteps of dictators and dictatorial psychology.

they have not thought about human limitations when they run the program 
that makes the schedule.  and they're required by law to give us 2 paid 15 
minute breaks and on unpaid 30 minute lunch if we work 7 or more hours.  
i've gotten my second break maybe 3 times since i started.  this is, 
however, better than my previous job where we only got the unpaid lunch.  
and if i get hurt at work and have to go to a doctor, i have to take a

The answer is semantics.  If they are your terrorists, then they are 
freedom fighters.  If they are not your freedom fighters then they are 
terrorists.

Good story.  During the Angoland Civil War we supported a group of 
communist rebels called UNITA.  We shipped millions of dollars of arms and 
support so they could wage war on the Soviet supported communist faction.  
UNITA ran around blowing up the nation's oil processing centers in an 
effort to stop the only industry capable of bringing in hard currency.  
Well, they were actually blowing up foreign subsidiaries of US oil 
companies.  So we were paying to have US businesses bombed.  Go figure we 
support communist rebels and drive up the price of oil in one operation.

use that power.  Yes, power can be used for both good and for evil.  This, 
of course, is always a danger.  Nevertheless, the federal govt. remains

Xela--

I must first say that I thought I was anti-government, but you are 
definitely born-hard in your dislike and I must pay homage to you.

As for multi-national exploitation of the third world, it is a confusing 
argument that arises from third world lobbying of the UN back in the 
1970s.  They attempted to have the UN impose global policies on 
multi-nationals to essentially make them defacto sub-units of the third 
world governments.  This belief system stressed independent development 
outside of the international free-trade regime (GATT) to ensure high 
growth rates and maintain their sovereignty.  This system was instituted 
throughout Central and South America and Africa.  All that resulted was 
perenial under-development, bloated inefficient industries that subsisted 
on government subsidies and were unable to compete in
 international, and the inevitable erosion of sovereignty that accompanies 
insanely large debts to foreign states and institutions.

The one area of the world which embraced multi-nationals was East Asia.  
There is no coincidence that this area is now the fastest growing economic 
sphere in the world.  For those who still believe that Europe is our 
largest trading partner, think again (Asia is now a 40% larger market!!!). 
 The multi-nationals used them for their cheap labor.  These states used 
the multi-nationals as a source of income and a way to train their 
workers.  As their labor forces became more skilled and educated, they 
took over the plants (low tech at first, such as clothing, cheap plastics, 
etc).  Foreign multi-nationals brought in middle tech facilities over 
time.  The experience gained eventually allowed for internal 
entrepeneurship and the creating of domestic industries.  Because these 
states refused to close their doors on the world, they were continually 
pushed by the market to create better goods at cheaper prices.  

The book on multi-national exploitation is mixed.  If you want to read 
some interesting stuff on the subject, pick up Fukuyama's _The End of 
History and the Last Man_ a former best seller.

Laelth--
Thanks for the thoughtful response which was obviously your heartfelt 
conviction.  Thanks for sharing it.

It is admirable that you are willing to sacrifice some of your freedoms 
for the common good.  Sacrifice in the face of obstacles is something the 
US has lacked since WWII.  But you should not have to sacrifice your 
freedoms to any person or institution to solve the problems facing society 
today.  When you forfeit your freedoms willingly, you never get them back. 
Napoleon III showed this quite well.

I understand why your see both individuals and business as selfish and 
self-serving.  But to choose government over these other two is a losing 
proposition.  Individuals and business operate in an environment where 
they must be responsible for their actions.  To a great extent the 
government does not.  You cannot sue the federal government.  Less than 
50% of registered voters routinely vote in Congressional elections (when 
we supply no oversight to our elected representatives why shouldn't they 
go out and pursue their own interests?), and the bureaucracy is 
responsible to no one but itself in pursueing its own agendas (usually 
increasing its size, regulatory powers, and budget).  You are nothing but 
a number to the government.  When you become a statistic, nobody will 
stand up for your freedoms.  

There are other options to solving our problems than being duped into 
giving over our freedoms.  This argument has been used globally by mad men 
and dictators for the last century with alumni including Hitler, Pinochet, 
and Khomeini.

Ah, but this is skirting about Patton's original statement as have all
other responses.  Noone has denied that labor conditions were awful then. 
But your response is off target.  You clearly show the ramifications of
labor trying to fight against the "robber barons" (What a cute name :),
but Patton never suggested that the people had a chance of facing them
down.  

What he said was that if the people were treated unfairly then the govt.
could intercede successfully (which they did eventually).  Let's face it,
labor is by far the largest sector of the populace.  If they don't like
something, they need to hire an official into govt. who is willing to
change it.  If they don't, hey that's not a failing of govt. or the great
arm of the robber barons usurping power, that's just stupidity.  If you
want to strike, your first action should be installing someone in govt.
who will support your right to strike, not strike first and let the
national gaurd make a turkey meet out of you.

Natalie--
AS you would see if you went back through my posts that I am quite 
knowledgable about history.  Knowledgable enough to view history the nuanc 
es behind the events (forces behind the actions, and outside of a black 
and white mentality).

To believe that industrial development can be achieved without paying a 
price is a historical Atlantis (it has never been found).  Yes, people 
worked in conditions that today we would find dangerous, repetitive, and 
tenuous.  But why were the workers there to begin with.  Did the nasty 
factory owners send hired thugs into the streets and Sanghai them?  Were 
they chained to their machines?  No.  They were there because they could 
earn a living at those jobs.  Agriculture had become productive enough to 
create a surplus of labor which could be transferred to an urban setting 
and put to work in mass production.  The surplus had a choice:  stay in 
the country and starve to death or go to work in the factories and mines.  

And yes, there were excesses in the Industrial Revolution as there are in 
most revolutions (political or otherwise).  Don't view the system of old 
through the lenses of prejudice that lie in a modern perspective of labor 
rights.  

If you would like some historical reading on the subject, look into the 
Enclosure Movement of England.

Xela--

The United States is a free, democratic Republic.  This is not blind 
idealism, but the truth.  Any citizen of this country over the age of 18 
is free to register to vote and partake in the mechanisms of government.  
That means any adult, US citizen.  Any citizen is free to join those who 
believe as they and form groups to represent those interests (thi sis the 
backbone of the party system).  If you, myself, and a dozen other people 
wished to put forth a virulently anti-business agenda for our group then 
we are free to do so.  And if others join us, then so be it.  If we get 
enough people to support us, then we may be able to gain elected 
representation and further our cause on a larger level.  Any group is free 
to do this.

As for your three points supporting your idea that the US is undemocratic:
    1-100% of the lower class do not vote
    2-Political Action Committees and big-business influence government
    3-voting isn't democratic
I see these things as missed opportunities.
    1-if the lower class was serious about changing their leadership, they 
would mobilize and form the majority voting block in areas across the 
nation.  Detroit is just one example where large sections of the city 
didn't turn out to vote because they believed their candidate would win.  
Needless to say, he lost and they had a lot of their public assistance 
severed.  They will turn out to vote in the next election.
    2-There are PACs for all causes:  rich or poor, left or right.  The 
Grey Panthers and AARP are just two examploes of a low-income interest 
group that sways votes on matters from SSI to education because they can 
muster votes.  I didn't say dollars to lobby with, but I said cold, hard 
votes!  Elected officials fear votes and subsequently work harder to 
fulfill the needs of their constituents.
    3-Voting is the most pure expresssion of democracy allowed in a 
Republic.  You cannot be restrained from voting.  No one can force you to 
vote for one candidate over another.  Your vote is done in secret so you 
cannot bear the reprecussions of your vote for any reason.

I understand and I agree with you that it resembled a serfdom.  The point
I was trying to make, however, was that the term serfs is incorrect. 
Serfs cannot, by law, own land or vote.  They're glorified slaves.  The
people you referred to had the power to change their circumstances (which
a serf could NEVER do).  Whether they wished to exercise that power was up
to them, but the power was there for them nonetheless.

yup. But one must selectively "sell out" in some ways in order to be able 
to bring down the capitalist serfdom, no? A good job is important, but the 
education to find out how the monolithic system works before bringing it 
down is useful.  One can either simply live one's own life (and get hauled 
off to the tank) or function not within, but around and under the system 
to weaken it.  The serfs are stronger than the rulers, but money keeps the 
"proles"(as Orwell would say) down.-Snafu

1. If the poor would mobilize...
2. There are PACs for all causes...
3. Voting is democratic...

Well...

1. The poor are discouraged from mobilizing with threats, both physical 
and employing in nature.  If you were the director of a firm, one way you 
would look to maximizing profit is by lowering overhead, i.e hire less 
people (downsizing), and avoid at all costs the hiring of union labour.  
    As someone who claims to have a vast knowledge of history, you will 
agree that businesses have used force before to dissolve labour groups.

2. As with all groups, power (and influence) comes down to which party has 
the most money.  I think that you would agree that the funding of a 
business-backed influence peddler and the funding of an environmentalist 
influence peddler would differ greatly.  Also, if you are familiar with 
the tactics of pharmaceutical companies in pushing new drugs on doctors to 
prescribe, you will also see how business PACs work by contributing to the 
"political campaign fund," or "war chest."

3. Voting is hardly a democratic process.  It requires a society with a 
democratic tradition, such as Switzerland, for voting to be democratic.  
Otherwise it is fraud.

This country is hardly a haven of freedom, if such a term can exist.  If 
you'd lke, I can bring up examples of freedom impeded by our Police State. 
Drugs, prostitution, pornography.  Morality imposed by a gun and a badge.  
You know as well as I do that the country is founded on Judeo-Christian 
values; one can read the major political documents and see te obvious 
influence of religion.

"U willingly enslaved yourself."

Well, the choice is between hunger and not hunger.  Enslavement wasn't 
really a choice here.

"Woudn't you [get the most work for the least money] if it were your 
business."

I would compromise enough so that my workers would prosper and so would I. 
 The current labour situation, the relation between employer and employee, 
polarizes the two against each other, and does both parties harm in the 
long run.  Its the old Hegelian thesis-antithesis relation.

"it [government] has made it harder for the poor to work their way out of 
poverty."

I would propose that there is enough "freedom of private interest" for 
market forces to act.  I will let current history serve as my proof, and 
add that such market forces have created the following effects, even 
further alienating the worker from the employer:

1. Temporary agencies.  They remove the monetary pressure from businesses 
of having to sponsor health insurance, and other benefits, such as 
pensions.

2. The influence peddled by Business when the government wanted to raise 
the minimum wage, even though min. wage doesn't even bring a man above 
poverty level.

3. The hiring of scabs to work in place of union workers who protest 
unfair wages and benefits.  This in effect saying: "You, as a worker, do 
not have the right to say No."

Your "objectivist" viewpoint in light of saying that there are "creators" 
and "leeches," ignores the interdependence of the two.  Inventors would no 
(not) prosper without workers to create their "product," and workers would 
not prosper without inventors to invent the "product."  If Ayn Rand's 
heroes would go on strike like they did in Atlas Shrugged, they would 
hardly live in the affluence they are accustomed to under the toil of 
labourers.

labor as the key componet to manufacturing high tech goods, it was only 
natural to move on to a information and service oriented economy.  Now any

Xela--

On point one, you are correct there have been a plethora of examples of 
business intimidating and threatening labor.  This is indicative of the 
constant melee between capital and labor.  But the struggle need not 
become a war.  Henry Ford correctly solved the problem of demand for his 
automobiles by boosting the wages of his employees.  He raised his workers 
into the middle class and they responded by increasing the demand for the 
cars (and the quality since they themselves became the customers).  Say 
what you will about the ascension of Japanese economic power, but the 
challenge presented has changed the face of US labor relations.  More 
emphasis has been placed on the employee and away from the machines.  
Employees have been empowered (with the corresponding responsibility it 
incurrs) and are treated more as partners than as enemies by management.  
It has been realized by all successful firms that their competitors have 
also reach full utilization of physical capital (machinery, etc) and the 
only way to better them is to fully utilize _human capital_.  This new 
attitude is seen in industries as diverse as Ford Motor Co, 3M, and even 
the U.S. government.

Political influence does not necessitate the most money.  Ralph Nader 
brought the heads of the Big 3 auto makers to their knees in from of 
Congress and forced federal intervention with a skeleton organization.  
The most powerful lobby that has ever existed, the Isreali Lobby (they 
throw the greatest parties known to man) fails repeatedly on its ventures.

"Political influence does not necessitate the most money."

As a rule, my point carries exceptions.  Capital buys influence in various 
ways.

"..the only way to better [corporations] is to fully utilize _human 
capital_."

Even where I work this is true...to a point.  It is a symbolic lowering of 
employer to communicate and "fully utilize" the worker; it could hardly be 
called a literal leveling of hierarchy.  The "Man," if you will, still 
decides who works and who doesn't.

"so are serfdoms a necessity?"

Well, humans can't seem to avoid them in the process of bettering the 
standard of living.

Bringing up Sweden is unusual; they mix the best elements of private 
enterprise with the best elements of social security.  Lately, with Bundt, 
that which has worked for so long is being dismantled by businesses eager 
to pay less taxes, while believing somehow that the State's bills will be 
payed. *shrug*

I have yet to see how any power institution, backed either with a 
capitalist or socialist economic dogma, avoids enslaving its constituents.

So I'll ask you if anarchaic capitalism, true anarcho-capitalism, is the 
answer, and why you believe anacho-socialism to be detrimental (if that is 
the case; I won't assume what's on your mind).

If you provide me with objectivism as the answer, I will quote Ms. Rand

for decades.  But, the coffers have run dry and business is faltering.  
To varying degrees in each country, the people have turned to more

Sort of like having a computer calculate the last digit of Pi!(of course 
there is no last digit of Pi)  What I would like to know is how an object 
can be a visual paradox... the only other time I've seen this theory 
mention is in the Dr. Who shows.  The Tardis(Dr. Who's ship) was larger on

possible? Is it because the ship could traval through time and space?

After living in Canada a good portion of my life, and also being
a naturalized citizen (by choice), I can say that the health of Canada's

All the US can show for "better health care" is more complicated,

Well, she's one of those people I can believe and admire only so far.  I
don't believe in all her politics, she takes things to extremes I can't
personally justify.  However, her writings on religion and existentialism
are superb.  Granted, a bit extreme, I really don't think modern art's
purpose is to subvert society, but I do thnk it's a load of crap.  As for
religion, it was about time someone stood up and said, hey you don't have
to go through life sacrificing; and how the hell could you be born in sin?

As I said, I think she was a bit obsessive and too extreme, but the
foundatiions of her ideas are valuable and lay down a strong foundation
for other ideas to grow upon

Did you read the Hitchhiker's Guide series?  Remember the hooker who charged
rich men to hug them and tell them it's okay to be rich and they shouldn't

On the subject of health care: It should be noted that the US is the only 
major industrialized country that does not have a national health plan.  
This is not endorse the Clinton Plan or any other plan that incoporates 
the insurance companies and health care multinational as part of any 
proposed solution.  The problem with for profit health care is that 
inevitabely the corporations (which must make a profit) are forced to 
either sacrifice patient care OR exclude portions of th population which 
cannot afford to pay.  Health Care (from a Canadian perspective) is a 
right - not a privelege.  Two tier systems are unnecessary and any system 
of care which is based on ones ability to pay is unfair and arbitrary.

At least thats what the little red book says.

Because other countries have it doesn't mean that the United States should 
or has to follow suit.  Other countries have mandatory service in the 
armed forces.  We don't.  A majority of the world doesn't have a free 
press.  We do.  A majority of states don't allow political and sometimes 
human rights to women.  We do.  A majority of the world is rules by

So what can I do to stop another species or fifty from dying? Eliminate 
the one species responsible.
By killing off humanity, the planet itself isn't affected on jot (THe ball 
of stone that spins in space, I mean) It will go on. But the ring tailed 
Ferret, which is almost totally gone, will get a shot at coming back. As

Number 10: They watch FAmily Fued no matter WHO the hiost is.
Number Nine: They are an aggressive, unbalanced species that has no desire 
to alter their destructive behavior
Number Eight: The years are all wrong
Number Seven: Alfonso Ribero
Number Six: In atonement for all the animals they wiped out
Number Five: It'll be the biggest bash ever!
Number Four: Bite me, It's FUN!
Number THree: Well, I might as well, I can't dance
Number Two: HAve you ever seen Eurodisney? Anything that could create
That abomination has to be destroyed
Number One: Because Lyndon LaRouch thinks it's a bad idea

Any others? C'mon, I know you all have a few
clset reasons to wipe the annoying things out.

No, I would never forget the war of 1812.  Neither should any American, 
for it was that war that gave birth to your national anthem.  If my memory 
serves me correctly, I beleive it was the British forces that stormed back 
across the border and torched the White House. Shortly thereafter the 
border dispute was settled.  Of course we were not a nation then so it 
wasn't a war between Canada and the US.

As for the dollar bills, I may even have some left over.  The Political 
Party which you refer to as the Labour Party is the NDP, aka, the New

Sorry mate, just read your other message re Health Care, Armed

The reference to National Health Care was in the context of other 
Industrialized Nations
The point is that it is inhuman for any nation with rich resources to 
offer differing levels of Health Care based soley on ones ability to pay.  
Sickness does not recognize ones bank account.  Our Nations have the human 
resources to give the best possible treatment to ALL citizens.  Excluding 
someone from top rate care because of money is just wrong.

I don't think this will happen, guy.  It may seem like we got it good, 
with our health care provided for and all, as well as progressive 
educational funding.  The truth is we pay through the teeth here.  Our 
taxes in Ontario on every item we purchase is 15%.
  in Michigan -- i think taxes are 4% -- compare...
  your dollar for us to buy is $1.41 in our currency
i'm saying Canada sucks... its an ok place to live and the world community 
does come down on us as much, but soon -- state provided health care will 
no longer be a reality when Provincial deficeits get higher.
 
And as far as education, Canada has too few and over-crowded venues of 
higher education, Windsor happens to be one of them, and the thought of 
goverment paying for education is a myth -- we have to pay it back, they 
only loan it to us and then want us to pay it back at 10% interest per 
annum.

The only ones who really benefit here, under "socialism" type policies my 
beloved country has -- are the rich.  And its easier here for them because 
there are more tax loop holes then you can shake a hockey stick at.

We're even losing our beloved sport of hockey to the rich American teams 
who can afford to pay all the big players and then turn around and charge 
poor working class folk for pay-per-view, just so they can watch the game.
At least here, the games are free.

Anyways, enough of my rantings -- i didn't really mean Canada sucks, its 
just that we pay huge amounts of tax and our government mismanages the 
country.  I wouldn't advise coming here unless you live in a thrid world 
country or you wanna avoid the draft.  I hear living on welfare is better 
than working -- but wouldn't know that.

Yes, it is en vogue among the industrialized West to have a craddle
to grave social welfare net which encompasses to varying degrees 
socialized medicine.  But, the point I was trying to make is that it is 
not mandatory that nations be forced to pursue this policy.  There are 
many options open to solve the problem of health care coverage to the 
general populace and the United States should not limit itself to only one 
avenue of exploration.

From the standpoint of social justice, it is a very potent argument that 
economically bountiful states should supply such services to its populace. 
 My point is that states may not be able to maintain that status for long 
at the expense of its own successes.

I always find it amazing that governments can justify expending billions 
of dollars in business tax credits and business grants but when it comes 
to Health Care, many individual politicians and parties cry poverty.

It is a question of lobby groups and Special Interest Groups, by and large 
the worst SIGs are business lobby groups which finance the main line 
parties, hence gaining an instrument with which they push forward their 
profit motivated agenda ahead of the publics best interest.

In 1949 Businesses operating in Canda contributed 49% of all taxes 
collected by the Federal government, Individual tax contributions made up 
the remaing 51%.  After 43 years of consecutive Liberal and Conservative 
governments, Corporate tax contributions now make up only 6% of totall 
collections. 

The shifting of the tax burden to the individual creates the illusion of 
poverty, when in fact the net wealth of th nation is quite healthy.

I boils down to a question of priorities.

care.  Nor does the Bible or any other piece of paper.

It is philiosphy based on the fact that ones health is THE most valuable 
commodity and therefore deserves special recognition.  Further, a society 
is only as good as it treats it's most disadvanteged.  To profit from the 
sickness of others is, in itself, sick.  

All medical professionals deserve to be treated with the utmost respect.  
Technicians, nusrses, doctors etc. put in many long hours constantly 
upgrading and honing their skills and they deserve to be compensated 
handsomely. 

HOWEVER, system that is based on profit whereby insurance companies, 
multinational corporations and others make huge profits off the Health 
Care system is the system that is in the most trouble and is the most 
ineeficient.

Corporations have to turn a profit.  That profit must come from somewhere. 
This profit is actually resources that you, and others, contribute.  Yet 
it has nothing to do with the quality of care you receive.  eg: Insurance 
You buy Health Insurance.  The company that picks up your policy is 
betting that you will not get sick.  If you get sick, or many in the same 
demographic region get sick then your rates will go up.  Yet, this has 
nothing to do with the quality of care which you receive.  There are many 
that cannot afford insurance, thus they do not receive the same level of 
care.  THIS IS THEIR HELTH DAMNIT - not a micro wave or VCR.

Health Care - A right, not a privelege.

Yes, health care again...

It seems that the most major problem some people have about insurance 
companies is that they make a profit.  While this may shock some, this is 
not directed at you Iggy (I pressed return twice by accident), it makes 
perfect sense to others.  Insurance companies provide a service to those 
who subscribe to them.  They fulfill a valuable service to private 
citizens seeking protection against future injury or illness.  What some 
have failed to see is that profit has marked the evolution of medical 
advancement throughout the 20th century.  Profits from medication or the 
sale of machinery, etc does not flow directly into the pockets of health 
care exploiters.  Most producers are large corporations owned by 
shareholders who split the profits accordingly.  Monies are reinvested 
into research and development for the reason that there will always be a 
market demand for newer, safer, more reliable drugs.  Without profit there 
is no R&D.  There will be no new wonder drugs or miracle procedures.

I've seen how efficiently the government runs health care.  I've been in 
the Veteran Administration hospitals and seen the absolutely lowest level 
of care and professionalism possible while still calling the facility a 
"hospital".  For those in the US who wish to see what could happen, I 
suggest a trip down to their local VA hospital (take a strong stomach with 
you).

I'm not going to add anything to this right now, but I just thought I'd
let you know that Zbadba (although he's at CMU right now) and I live in
Pensacola... the place where two "abortion doctors" (quote - unquote) have 
been shot and killed. We've been on the news lately... quite frankly, the
situation is getting out of control. The details on the latest shooting 
are still vague (at least from what I've heard)... but apparently the 
doctor who was shot was wearing a bullet-proof vest, which didn't work, 
arising from the fact that he was shot point blank. Several others were 
injured in the shooting as well, if I'm not mistaken.

Anyways... my personal opinion as far as abortion goes is that I don't 
believe in abortion, but it is a woman's body, and she has a right to the 
choice. I have no grasp over her, and regardless of her choice, have no 
bearing whatsoever in what she does. However, I do feel that some 
responsibility should be taken as a result of how the child (in the womb, 
of course) was conceived. Rape and incest are in the minority, and cannot 
be worked out a justifiable basis for supporting abortion. (as I have 
learned) If the couple having the child is irresponsible, then I do not 
think that that is a "good" reason for having the procedure done. 

Anyways...

Perhaps the discrepancy in th level of care given in VA hospitals as 
opposed to the others is symptomatic of having a 'two tier' system in the 
first place.  It is remarkable how the level of care increases when all 
people, rich and not so rich, powerfull and powerless, have to share the

Actually the "kids" are pretty well informed already.  As to the
adoption:There's an awful long waiting list for adopting children
(especially caucasian children) and the potential aborters are informed of
this fact in advance.  In short, the children could be adopted, but the
parents don't want that, they want an abortion.

...and there's one of the cores of the problem.  Sure we'll adopt their
child.  However, the support they'll recieve from us is not without
limits.  Some support comes in the form of paid leave and medicare, but
don't expect a free meal ticket.  Irregardless, most people abort because
their in an untenable financial situation or one of the parents is
"missing".  I'd say that's a pretty damn good reason for an abortion
personally.  So they made a mistake and got pregnant, at least they didn't
compound it by raising a hopelessly disadvantaged child destined for crime
or welfare (yeak I know it's not always this kind of situation, but it is
often enough to make a generality on).

As ziggy mentioned, my normal home is Pensacola, Fl. So far, we've had a 
mighty bad record of keeping these doctors alive. This makes three doctors 
dead (although one of the fatalities was actualy a victim of random street 
crime).

The suspect in custody, Paul Hill, allegedly walked up to the pickup truck 
where the doctor, his escort, and his wife were sitting and "pulled the 
trigger again and again." According to witnesses, between 6 and 9 shotgun 
shells were fired. The doctor and escort were hit in the head and died 
almost instantly. The wife of the doctor was wounded (as far as I know, 
she is in stable condition). 

To whoever said it, the suspect (Paul Hill) was *NOT* a member of 
Operation Rescue. Hill had formed his own anti-abortion group following 
the killing of Dr. David Gunn some 17 months ago. The group's stated 
policy was that "as abortion is murder, it is imperative that the mass 
murder must be stopped by whatever means necessary." Hill, however, 
previously stated that he did not feel that it was his place to use force. 

That's about all I know at this point. Living on campus here, I'm in a 
news vacuum most of the time. I only found out about this one because I 
had mentioned that the Dr. Gunn killing had happened back home, and 
someone noticed the newspaper headline and mentioned it in
 passing conversation to me. (It was rather amusing, actually. The person 
who told me didn't know where the killing had taken place. When he told 
me I said "gee, I bet it's Pensacola. Prbably had something to do with the 
that Paul Hill nut, too." Sho'nuff.)

A somewhat interesting tidbit of U.K. health care.  Seems as if there was 
an attempt in the early '90s to outlaw the production of glass beer mugs.  
What has this to do with health care and why did some M.P.s try to do away 
with the weighty vessels?  It costs the gov an extraordinary amount of 
money dealing with the results of bar/pub brawls which the mugs were used 
as a weapon.  Because the system covers reconstructive surgery, many of 
the poor lads and lasses had bills in many thousands of pounds.  Because 
of the cost, some MPs wanted to do away with glass mugs.  Anyone else see 
a connection to Congress and the regulation of nicotene considering the 
amount of money that is spent in Medicaid and Medicare to deal with the 
consequences of tobacco usage?  I would like to hear your responses.

You've got a serious point there...There are people who are nonviolently 
opposing Abortion in various ways, and I can deal with that...but I am 
afraid for people I know who have made this hard choice. Let me tell you 
an RI abortion story.

My Friend Nameless and I went to Planned Parenthood this week, becaus eshe 
had decided, after realizing what an untenable situation she was in, that 
she could not give birth. (I won't go into details...It's her decidion and 
her reasons) We rode the bus up together...she doesn't show, and that 
usually isn't a problem anyway.

We got outside the building in question...There was a two tier wave of 
people, not a lot, maybe twenty of them. We got past the first wave with 
minimal hassle (They screamed their usual "Don't kill your child" 
stuff...how do they know it isn't an OBGYN appointment? They don't.) and 
then, the second wave hit. Five men tried to block the door. People from 
inside tried to move them back. One of the men put his hands on Nameless, 
trying to stop her...I put my hands on him and used an old wrestling move 
to put him on the ground. His buddy hit me in the face (Just above my 
messed up eye, BTW...I don't know if he did any new damage.) and at that 
point I lost it...to say I kicked his ass would be an insult to the 
thourough job my boots did. In the end, we both went to jail for the 
day...we both ended up getting released with no charges...and I feel 
really, really angry about the whole thing.

What if he'd had a gun? He might have shot her, or me. I don't, know or 
ever, advocate suppressing speech, but by God I won't lose someone dear to 
me over something like that...and if I did, I don't know if I could let 
the killer live, secure in his religous calling.

Candidate Clinto proposed to Americans back in the fall of '92 the notion

time to take care of matters back at home.  When naysayers questioned this 
proposition, they were grouped under the heading "Cold Warrior" and were 
openly scorned as outdated.  There were those who came forth with real 
questions about a possible President who refused to believe that the world 
could get any worse in regards to stability and conflict than it was 
during the time of the Soviet Union (Zbigniew Brzezinski being one of 
them).  

The world is now two years older and much more violent and unstable.  The 
reigns of power have been turned over to those who had once openly 
condemned the use of violence for any reason and had even suggested that 
having the strength to use force in the first place was inherently wrong.  
It is these people who are sending U.S. troops to the far corners of the 
planet to carry out missions of "Peace Making" and "Nation Building" under 
the guises of humanitarian efforts.  It is these people who are handing 
over the conduct of our foreign policy to the United Nations.  The 
Secretary-General of the United Nations no longer asks for our assistance, 
he demands our participation (at his bequest, using his rules).

The United States did not 'win' the cold war.  The Soviet Empire collapsed 
upon itself for it was based on the same premise which globalisation is.  
When power is concentrated in the hands of a few at the expense of the 
many, eventually such a system will fail.

Throughout human history many empires have come and gone.  The length and 
power of these empires is directly proportional to the elites control over 
it's ability to convince it's population that their fight is the true GOOD 
fight, by controlling the flow of information to it's population.

The less educated and those who conduct their personal affairs without 
consciene and critical thought are doomed to be instruments of what are 
basically selfish andtruely 'evil' institutions.

It is basically 'class warfare'.  It is not by accident that the countries 
where the division between the rich and poor is sharp are the most 
unstable.  Eventually the many, who are being ruled by the few, get pissed 
off and 'throw the bums out'.

Iggy-

Thanks for the spirited post!

As for the U.S. not winning the Cold War, this line of thinking is 
currently en vogue among international relations revisionists.  The fact 
that has been revealed through the devulging of previously declassified 
documents from the former Soviet Governement and the KGB is that the 
United States was the victor in a global war of attrition.  The failure of 
the USSR to subvert the governments of the First World and to export the 
revolution was a failure of titanic proportions (Kruschev proudly 
proclaimed "Your grandchildren will live under Communism").  The failure 
to bring about industrialization and the inability to produce consumer 
goods to meet the needs of its people showed the people the internal 
contradictions of the foundations of Communism.  Let me rephrase that:  
failure to industrialize beyond the capacity to produce at the level of 
the West during the 1950s (and at a staggering cost to the environment).  
The US led anti-Soviet global alliance system surrounded, contained, and 
strangled the USSR to death through its resiliance and prosperity.

As for "Class Warfare" between the rich and poor states, you are right.  
The tensions between the North and South are razor sharp, but because of 
the disparity of power between the First and the Third (and Fourth and 
Fifth) World, the only battle ground is in the U.N.

Capitalism is prepared for the post-industrialized First World.  
Capitalism was originally described by Adam Smith to explain the market 
forces in agriculture not industry (_Wealth of Nations_ published in 
1776).  Capitalism survived the coming of industrialization and it will 
survive the move to an information/service economy because its basis in 
reason and not idealism.

And I apologize for the amorphous "These People" Comment.  It brings back 
shades of Ross Perot speaking at the NAACP.  Those I were referring to 
were the Warren Christophers and the Madalen Albrights, the dovish, 
globalist left-overs from the Carter Administration. Sorry about the lack

Problem is, it makes all the important Germans (i.e, the ones wielding 
power: Kohl and his CDP bunch, and the police, who stand by idly watching 
the violence) brown shirters.  This, in essence, is a prerequisite of the

"Capitalism survived the coming of industrialization and it will survive 
the move to an information/service economy because its basis in reason and 
in idealism."

I have a couple of gripes with this statement.

Capitalism uses the abstract concept of money as its emblem.  By creating 
money, idealism is emblemized in worship of the dollar (or yen, or peso, 
etc.).  It becomes the cure-all which identifies (theoretically) "all that 
is best within man."  

Reason assumes a constant value system for every man, woman and child, 
i.e. every man, woman and child senses reality in the same way and can 
therefore use reason to increase wealth.  This assumption is faulty, for 
the simple reason that people do *not* experience reality in the same way, 
and therefore a value system for society which assumes everyone "sees" 
reality in the same way cannot work, regardless of whether it is called 
"reason," or "vegetables," etc.

Therefore, a theory of laissez-faire capitalism based upon the concept of 
"reason," automatically fails as a correct and self-sustaining behavior 
control method.

Second point:  Capitalism may survive the already entrenched 
information/service economy, but a more pressing question is whether *we* 
as a society will survive *it*.  Anyone can sell widgets; the employee 
becomes expendable/replaceable, and a society will not have much strength 
on that basis.

have a bad reaction to the drug).  but the catch is you can only have the

will come back to a world where we dropped the bomb on Russia....The

First off I must apologise for not responding earlier.  I hacked a reply 
late friday and the system crapped on me before it took.  No matter though

Do not mistake me for a historical revisionist or a defender of the Soviet 
Empire.  From Stalin onwards, the USSR was a tyranical power which 
practised state capitalismwhich concentrated the power and wealth in the 
hands of a few. As with all structu which are based on gross inequalities, 
eventually it collapeses/changes.  The former USSR is still undergoing 
massive changes, and let's all hope the transformation continues on 
relatively peacefull.

Our society is not prepared for the change to the 'information' based 
economy.  The disappearance of well paying blue collar jobs is damaging to 
the very underpinnings of Canadian and American ways of life.  Not all 
people have the skills, and never will, or the desire to deal in 
information.  And exactely what the hell is an information/service based 
economy anyway?  Who produces the TV's, Fridges, Cars, Couches, Lounge 
chairs, carpets, etc, etc, etc that we all cherish?  Historically (short 
term) we have produced many of those items here.  With the erasing of 
economic borders, manufacturers can produce the goods where the labour is 
dirt cheap and ship it back here for sale.  The cost to us is the massive 
loss of jobs.  These pratices, coupled with automation, are issues that 
have not been succesfully addressed yet in our economies.  Look at the 
trade imbalance and declining earning power . . . it is very concerning.

The American health care system may be very good . . . for the very few

nation 'founded under God' claim to be fair and just when it determines 
the level of care received by a citizen based not on need, but on instead 
on ability to pay?

An interesting observation: Confederation Life Assurance, which has 
several hundred thousand policy holders in the US is on the verge of being 
shut down.  Why? Because they invested their money, great sums of it, in 
Real Estate.  As we all know, real estate has not been preforming very 
well over the past several years.  What is going to happen to all those 
policy holders? And how much of your premiums go to pay, not for health

No problem on the time problem Iggy, thanks for keeping up a conversation 
as many here just fall into tangents or name calling.

Yes, there is an economic evolution facing the industrialized West.  And 
this evolution is painful...quite painful for some.  Technological 
transfers, rising levels of human capital around the world, and the rate 
of technological change have all led to the rusting of both the US and 
Canada.  As I am more familiar with the situation in the US, I will give 
examples.  The steel industry in the U.S. has been decimated.  Why?  
Because the technology and the skill level of laborers has been mastered 
and reached around the world.  Steel is being produced by everyone from 
India to Korea to Brazil.  Low-tech and middle-tech products 
(shipbuilding, linen manufacturing, TVs, VCRs, refridgerators, etc) have 
all been dispersed around the globe as more and more states industrialize. 
Times have changed and the laws of comparative advantage have overtaken 
the West.  The West will pursue an information/service based economy 
because it relies upon the talent and brillance of its people and not the 
sweat of their brows as manufacturing intensive economies do.  This is not 
meant to say that there is not brillance globally, but the skill level and 
educational level of western workers will, over time, be shunted into 
information and service industries.  We will export these products while 
buying our consumer goods from others.
It is sad and tragic to see the empty mills and factories of the "Rust 
Belt", but they probably said the same thing when the sweat shop clothing 
plants moved other lands to make room for the steel mills.

I must disagree with your basic assertion that the reason that goods are 
being produced oversea's is because their level of industrialization has 
increased.  It is only partially true.  A soveriegn nation has the option 
of disallowing sales of imported products, imposing tariffs are requiring 
components to be manufactured in the said nation.  Basically, 
protectionism.  The greatest benefactors of cheaply (not quality but human 
cost) manufactured goods are the large multinationals.

There is no shame in making a living off of grunt work, the sweat of ones 
brow.  Indded, these are the people I am most concerned about for I do not 
beleive that everyone can, or should be desk jockeys.

Here in Manitoba, the manufacturing sector has been totally decimated from 
the effects of Free Trade.  Average weekly earnings are down to wer they 
where in 1987, and over 25% of the jobs in manufacturing have disappeared. 
 It is therefore not suprising to see our levels of personal and business 
bankruptcies soar to  record shattering levels in recent years.  Every 
sector of our economy is in the toilet and it is not a wonder when one 
considers that many of the people who used to earn $14+ an hour are now 
flipping burgers, driving cab or collecting welfare.  Why?  These are 
people who have worked hard for most of their lives they deserve better.  
I don't see the CEO's of Bombadier, POWER, Great West Life, CP, CN, or 
others taking cuts in pay.  In fact, they reap huge rewards for 
'downsizing' their operations and moving components south of the border.

there is a growing war between the Liberal and the Conservative, but not
along the lines that we use now. I mean in terms of change. We are in a
growing war between those who embrace change and those who abhorr it. The
problem is that few are totally on one side or the other. 

To put in Hegelian terms, the technological dialectic is now moving at a
seemingly geometric rate. As we move ahead and the new technology begins

It is true that sovereign nations can disallow sales of imported products 
by imposing quotas or tariffs so as to manufacture componets in the host 
nation.  But this has been shown to be the quickest recipe for disaster.  
Import Substitution Industrialization has been shown to be a failure in 
dozens of states around the globe.  It is because it denies the market to 
function properly.  
Argentina in the 1950s was one of the wealthiest states in the world.  It 
had the second largest gold reserves globally and had one of the top 10 
GNPs.  After 30 years of ISI it is a Third World state.  The tarriffs and 
quotas kept out foreign products and the state heavilys subsidized sectors 
of the economy to stimulate job creation and economic growth.  All that it 
accomplished was pouring funds down an endless black hole.  The protected 
sectors, because they didn't need to compete with anyone but themselves 
(government mandated monopolies) there wasn't any care about quality of 
innovation.  They grew fat, bloated and lazy as they were lavished with 
funds.  Economic decisions became political decisions rife with cronyism 
and mis-use.
One of the reasons Canadian heavy manufacturing is having a tough time is 
because it didn't need to compete in the international marketplace.  The 
market rewards those who produce the best goods (highest quality for the 
lowest price).  Protected industries can do neither.  So when the doors 
come open, only the best products prevail (for those in the U.S. just 
remember Detroit in the early '80s, the doors were falling off of GM cars 
while the Japanese were producing cars at half the cost that stayed on the 
road seemingly forever).

There is no shame in surviving off the sweat of one's brow, but it makes 
better sense for a state to create better-paying light blue collar
 jobsn it does to have its citizens work in dangerous, low paying fields 
far off from the cutting edge of technology.  It is better to control 
one's economic fate than to live in the memories of one's former glories.

A few random thoughts:

No, except in relatively rare cases, people in this country are not denied 
critical care. Expensive, long-term treatments, yes. Preventative care, 
yes. Critical care, no. Funny story: a few years back, I knew a student 
who went to germany on an exchange. While he was there, he suddenly became 
violently sick, and was taken to the hospital. Neither he nor his host 
family paid anything. 2 Years later. A german exchange student in the same 
program comes to the US. Gets very very ill, and is hospitalized. After 
her treatment, however, the hospital *would not* release her until the 
bill was paid by *someone*. 

Therein lies the inner beauty of the US system. It's so friendly... :)

More babble:

arachnoi spends a lot of time slamming the canadian healthcare system for 
not offering the gee-wiz starwars gizmos and wonderdrugs common to the US 
system. Frankly, I think the canadian approach smarter: cost to benefit 
ratios. People in this country are loathe (with good reason) to put a 
price tag on human life, but it has to be done because resources are not 
infinite. An incredible amount of resources is wasted in this country on 
tests and the like. It is not cost effective to give everyone who comes 
to their doctor with a migraine headache a CAT scan because "it might be a 
tumor." Yet this happens a lot. Stupid. Yes, a few people will fall thru. 
the cracks. But more people fall now because we pretend compromises don't 
need to exist, so there are no compromises at all.

Resistant, not resistance.  Think about your mistakes before you go around

Patton becomes very scared when people start to look to "cost to benefit 
ratios" as a means of defining if a system is good or not.  If the US 
decides upon the Mitchell or Gephart (sp?) then the health care industry 
will become under the auspices of the federal government complete with its 
own budget and bureaucracy.  All bureaucracies have limited budgets, thus 
their resources must be portioned out on a priority system.  
If health care eliminated the human factor and begins expending its 
resources according to "benefits" a very black hole emerges.  Who defines 
which resources should go to whom.  Bureaucrats will decide in what 
priority care will be implemented.  As in Sweden, will care be given to 
"drains on the system"; ie, the old or infirm who may be reaching the last 
10-20% of their lives?  Just some thoughts to think about when you hand 
over 1/8 of the US economy to faceless bureaucrats who owe their 
accountability to no one.

As for the U.S. system spending too much money on tests, you're absolutely 
right.  The reason for this is malpractice lawsuits.  If doctor A misses a 
tumor in a patients brain due to the fact that doctor A didn't feel a CAT 
scan was necessary, they're headed to court.  Several million dollars 
later and probably relocation to a different state, the seed has been 
planted.  The medical profession has been burned so many times that they 
feel they must do tests to protect themselves.

I must question your citation of Argentina as an economic failure due to 
operating in a closed market.  Many other factors come into play, military 
influence, culture and world politics in general also influence the rise 
and fall of all economic states.

The Japanese are an example of a nation that literally closed their 
economy to the rest of the world after the second world war.  They 
restructured, planned and eventually expanded.  I am not citing their
 m del as an ideal, however, there are lessons to be learned through 
Government, Labour and Business cooperating for the benefit of the nation 
as a hole rather than acting in an adversarial (sp?) role.

Many monopolies are created by the private sector and are more parasitic 
with less accountability than those created by any government.  One does 
not need a legal mandate to have a monopoly, market share and cartel 
structures or as effective and even more damaging than government mandated 
monopolies.

It may  souns nice a clean to worship at the altar of the dollar and 
slough off economic tradgedies as marketplace justice.  However, people 
contribute to the economic growth of a nation, they deserve to reap it's 
rewards.  

I examine with a very wary eye having the state create light blue colar 
jobs.  Job creation by a government for the sake of decreasing 
unemployment is addictive to politicians for their short term gain.  The 
cost though, if those jobs do not have a net positive affect, is increased 
borrowing.  Under the current monetary structure of the Canadian economy 
anyway, this leads to increased borrowing on the forgein exchanges which 
is detrimental to the current and furture economic health of the nation.

Indeed, former glories are best left to the warm thoughts that are 
stimulated in a bar after several beers.

The Capitalist system has brought us to our current state.  How, can it 
get provide for our future?  It was the Right Wing in the US which tripled 
the net accumlated debt from 1 trillion to over four trillion.  It was the 
Ring Wing Tories (now reduced to a pathetic 2 seats in Canada) which 
devastated our economy.  How can these champions of Free Trade and Free 
Enterprise be held as models?  Their tired od ideas have obviously been a 
total failure.

Oh well,  there is work to be done.  Much work.

I find it interesting that you blame Black people for dying.  Claiming 
that the infant mortality rate of the United States is because there are 
alot of black people is really silly.

You are ignoring that other important state which is that most of the 
                                      stat^
deaths take place in the lower income groups. Which are Primarily, 
although not exclusively black.  Which makes my point! ie: People are 
receiving substandard health care simply because they cannot afford it.  
This is totally shamefull.

I am not a Democrat, never have have been, never will be.  The closest we 
have in Canada to the Democratic Party is th Liberal Party, and they are 
far too right wing for me.  I am slightly to the left of our NDP (New 
Democratic Party no relationship to the Democrats) which was born from the 
CCF and Labour in 1961.  I am proud to say that it was the CCF/NDP which 
first brought socialised medicine to Canada decades ago, and it is the NDP 
which will make damn sure that it stays that way forever.

It it too bad that Allstate is having the same problems as Confederation 
life.  Thank you again for making my point.  If those companies fail, who 
will pick up the policy holders? . . . . . (hint: ask any Saving & Loans)
Would it not be much more efficient and simple to pay for the cost of just 
Health Care instead of failed Insurance companies, lawyers, advertising, 
promotion, profits, speculative ventures, etc, etc?

Which brings us to the final point.  Which is yes, it is much simpler and 
more efficient to reduce the costs of Health Care so we can afford it.  
The best way to do this is to boot the insurance companies and private 
health Care institutions (for they are the ones with the high overheads 
that are not related to the level of Care one receives).  By God, I think 
you're beginning to see the light.

doctors are scared that they may find another condition (which killed the 
patient) that the patient was suffering from, in additio to the one that 
they were being treated for...and that the families of these patients may 
then sue the doctors for malpractice for not discovering this condition

Certainly.  Use advertising/brainwashing to urge people to consume

product quality shitty so that the product is replaced often.  I can use 
sneakers as a real life example, or tires, for instance.

Capitalism or communism, it doesn't matter as long as the populace is 
consuming to keep capital in the hands of the powerful, i.e. the CEOs of a

Consumerism is a auto-feeding process, diverting power into the hands of a

Iggy-

There are many more examples to draw upon to illustrate the idea that 
import substitution industrialization is a failure.  If not Argentian, 
then we can always look at Mexico.  Too much of a military influence 
there, then we can always try India, the largest pluralistic democracy in 
the world.  Failed there too.

As for the case of the Japanese, they are an historical aberration.  It is 
true that they closed off large segments of their economy to foreign 
imports after WWII.  But they concentrated on Export Led Growth.  The only 
thing that saved Japan'
s industrial base was the Korean war.  Japan was fast on its way to 
becoming an agricultural based state when the U.S. converted the Japanese 
economy to be a support system for US war material needs.  A great source 
on this was the autobiography put out by the head of Sony back in 89/90.  
Another reason why the Japanese model is an aberration lie in the fact 
that the US allowed Japan to be a free-rider on the international free 
trade regime because of security interests.  Japan was the far-eastern 
barrier to Soviet expansionism.  It was in the US's vital interest to 
ensure that Japan could defend itself (we wrote their armed forces out of 
existence with the MacCarthur Constitution).  We allowed them to accrue 
massive trade imbalances as a way of strengthening our flank.  As with the 
tensions seen recently, the absence of the Soviet threat has seriously 
strained the bilateral US/Japanese economic relationship.

I don't see the private sector being less accountable than government.  In 
fact, the private sector is accountable to government!  It is taxed, 
overseen, and regulated to a large extent.  The days of free-wheeling 
enterprise are long gone.  Government supervises everything from zoning 
restrictions on where you wish to start your business, the flow of your 
goods if they cross state lines, and the amount of profit you are allowed 
to keep (capital gains taxes here in the U.S.).  Also included is how you 
get rid of your waste products (if any) and the hiring practices you 
employ.  In short government tells you where you can work, whom you can 
hire, and the return on your investment you can receive.  The private 
sector also has the bottom line;  profit.  If people refuse to buy their 
products or services, it goes under.  No government has a bottom line.  

As for Right Wingers in the White House bloating the budget in the US you 
are not entirely correct.  The current stream of thought in revisionist 
Economics Departments throughout US universities and colleges is that the 
ReaganBush era was a time of Republicans slopping at the trough at the 
expense of the federal deficit.  Reagan and Bush spent not one dollar of 
US taxpayer money!  Only the Congress of the United States has the power 
of the purse.  Republicans never controlled the House of REpresentatives 
during their stay in office.  They only controlled the Senate for 2 years. 
It was the democratically controlled Congress that lavished enough pork on 
the budget to make it the most slippery mess in the history of the US.  
But this is for another discussion at another time.....

The U.S. has never been totally laissez-faire economically.  And the 
"tired old ideas" which you speak of have never been tried in their pure 
form.  They have always been half measures or misunderstood, bastardized 
mixed ideas.  I quote from the mouth of the Supply Side President himself, 
Ronald REagan,
    "I am now a Keynsian"  - Ronald Reagan  1986.

Wow, sounds like killing the messenger when he brings bad news, doesn't 
it?  I remember back a few years ago that the State of Minnesota (or maybe 
it was Wisconsin) wanted to clamp down on excessive lawsuits against 
doctors to keep down the price of medical care.  The state gov made all 
participating doctors employees of the state by having them perform 
something like 10 hours a week of free medical care for patients under 
Medicaid or MediCare.  Because they were employees of the state, there was 
a ceiling on the amount of money they could be sued for under a 
malpractice lawsuit.  I never found out how successful this was, or if it 
stood up to Constitutionality arguments.  If anyone knows how it came out, 
I would love to know.

Wow!  These messages are growing faster than a Conservative Deficit.  
Serious length in the last one.

My point about Argentina in the last message was that there are many 
factors that go into the making of a healthy economy.  India, Japan and 
Mexico all have differing cultures and histories and if we deal with each 
of them on an individual basis we'll need several more message bases.  
However, what is clear about Japan is that they have a strong 
manufacturing base which is what we are losing - for whatever reason.  

Government vs Private Sector:
I am not going to feel sorry the multi nationals in the 'Private Sector'.  
It is this concentrated free flow of capital which is posing the threat to 
our life style.  This myth about Big Government hassling business is way 
out of control.  I'm going to have to repeat myself here but; In the late 
'40s business contributed much more to tax collections than they do today. 
 Roughly 50%.  The balance was made up through personal tax collections.  
Today (as of 1991 or 92) business contributes less than 10%.  After fifty 
years of Liberal/Conservative governments, business is getting a near free 
ride.  This is NOT including the incentives, grants and interest free 
loans receive by the so called 'Private Sector'.

In fact; it is business which controls government.  Look at the lobbyists, 
political contributions, and influence peddling.  Most politicians today 
don't retire on their pensions, they retire to the Board of Directors for 
some multi-national corporation.  Is this because they (the politician) 
was so efficient at running things while they where in office?  They did 
such a good job while they where there? . . . if so. . . for whom?

And Thank God for some guidelines on employment standards.  Thousands of 
people gave their lives for these standards and millions more die, or damn 
near die, trying to ome to our countries each year for those very same 
standards, or in their own lands fighting for some standards.  Yup, the 
people of Bohpal where really ashamed of themselves for having such strict 
standards on Union Carbide.

I'm sorry about the Regan deficit thing.  You see, to me Democrats and 
Republicans are one in the same.  Kind of like Canadian Liberals and 
Conservatives, same animal.  However, I always thought that 'The Buck 
Stops Here' was the motto of American Presidents.  Too Much Hollywood 
influence maybe.

Bacteria can form spores, resistant to environmental stresses such as 
cold, heat, humidity, etc...  As soon as humans moved into a warm 
environment (room temp.) the bacteria would once again thrive.

Besides, AIDS is a virus, and not a form of bacteria.  Virii lie on the 
border of life/non-life because of their peculiar ability to reproduce 
while maintaining a purely crystalline inert form outside the host cell.  
To kill virii using a temperature shock would mean putting the host 
(human) to the same temp. shock.  And such methods would involve intense 
heat to lyse the protein coat.  There are chemical methods (often 
poisonous to both host and paarasite), but since you mentioned temperature 
I only discussed this area.

Focusing on the problems of a particular group is indeed not silly.  
However, your original post made no mention of their economic status, only 
their race.

Our Health Care system is not in any financial difficulty.  An interesting 
story I will relate to you.  Here in Manitoba the Conservative government 
tried to play on the myth of their fiscal responsibility by declaring it 
was time to 'reform' our Health Care System.  They went out and hired an 
American Health Care Consultant who proclaimed that she would save our 
system $50 to $60 million.  At the time we (in the Wingy Left) pointe out 
that her track recor of savings came primarily from cuts to 
Administration and frills in the American System.  Such methods would not 
be successfull here for our system is already more efficient.  Well, the 
study was done and the reports came in and sure enough the total cuts to 
the system where $6 million (not $60 million) an her fee (which the stupid 
Tories paid) was $5.2 million.  Plus, there is question as to whether the 
cuts that where made where previously planned anyway. 

Please.  We do not 'ration' Health Care here based on age or 
survivability.  We all pay for it.  This is the difference between the 
systems.  You're always going on about paying for those who don't pay. 
Well, in our system, we all pay.  The poor pay through their taxes and the 
rich pay through their taxes.  But we all pay.  It's much more equitable 
that way.

I don't know if our system would work in the US.  The Canadian head set is 
different than the American.  This is not a knock . . . or a boast.  It's 
just an observation.

Oh, as a side note.  Confederation Life went under officially yesterday.  
See if you can notice what happens to some of their policy holders.  
Remember, they got into trouble, not due to Health Care costs, but because 
they were over exposed in commercial real estate.  What will happen to 
people who have paid into policies for 'x' number of years?  Will they get 
picked up by another company, or has their age made more

{"Wonder Drugs" will not be available in the future because they won't 
work anymore!}

1.  Assuming that antibiotics are "Wonder Drugs," 

Then your sentence makes sense.  But espousing penicillin and its ilk as 
"Wonder Drugs," create under market forces (as you claimed back in the 
first few posts)      ^-d    , is a dangerously false claim.  Simply 
because they will not work.  Now for some reason, which you haven't 
explained yet, you wrote that antibiotics were wonder drugs then said they 
will have no use in the future.  You provided a sound, sientific reason 
why they won't work.  What escapes me is how that begins to help your 
argument; you presented a contradiction and asked me to accept both 
points.

Your debating skills leave a little something to be desired.  I don't 
agree with much of what Rand says, but she does say that to completely 
understand the full literal meaning of a sentence, read each word for what 
it means.  I've been trying that with all your posts, and I still can't 
dissolve through all the meaningless sidetrack crap, all the innuendo and 
assumations, and all the inherent contractions in the main points of your 
arguments.

You prove any hypothesis you have with assumations and unquoted "facts."

Frankly, I'm glad that we take care of our politicians after their 
retirement.  In fact, I think that we ought to pay them more while they're 
in office.  Think about it.  If we paid them five or ten million dollars a 
year then they might not have to sell their influence to get reelected and 
keep their jobs.  When it costs anywhere from two to fifteen million
dollars to run for office who are we to be surprized when our politicians 
are corrupt?  Personally, I'm tired of it.  I'm tired of politicians 
selling their votes to the rich.  Right now they have no other choice.  
The rich and the businesses are the people who have the money, and the 
politicians need lots of money to get in and stay in office.  So, who ends 
up running the country?  The rich people and the businesses, of course, 
insted of "We the people."

Hey, if baseball players and corporate executives can earn millions of

I have to respectfully disagree about the level of care we give our 
elected represenatives at the national level.  You can't look solely at 
salary to measure what they are pulling in.  Under the current laws they 
can hide the equivalent of an income 5 times larger than what is shown.  
How?  Let's say I was running for US House of Representatives from the 5th 
district of Pennsylvania.  I could write off the maintenance of an RV as 
an election expense (transportation).  I could write off with rent of 
living in my lakeside luxury condo (courtesy of my rich backers from my 
venture fund that was "unaffiliated" with the official campaign *ahem*).  
Entertainment is totally covered by my campaign fund.  Support 
organization (State Party, local and county party boards) pick up the 
check for all my rallies, mailings, and travel.  This even applies when I 
am in 
Congress!  Sounds unbelievable, it's not.  There are a few honest 
Congressmen left, but they are rare.

I have to fall back on Founder's intent of what they wanted our federal 
legislature to be.  They wanted non-professional politicians who were 
citizens first.  Citizens who knew what the value of a dollar was.  
Citizens who did what was needed for the national good first, their 
re-election bid second.  And on the subject of re-election, they did not 
believe in professional, career legislators.  Ever since the rise of 
Federal power in teh 20th century, people have been elected to Congress 
and stayed for the rest of their professional lives.  Claude Pepper, 
Rostenkowski, Edward Kennedy, Mitchell (GOP leader in the House) are just 
a few examples.  They are far from career, enlightened civil servants.  
They are all career politicians bent only on building their kingdoms and 
following their own agendas.  

The U.S. has developed a class of pompous, spoiled, pork barreling, 
self-serving technocrats who feel themselves to be above the contempt of 
their constituents.  This goes for the vast majority of both sides of the 
political spectrum.

But the defense to your argument is that without these professional 
politicians, Congress would not work.  The line of reasoning is is that 
the professionals know how to deal with the industrial giants and how to 
deal with each other.  They know their constituencies and know what is 
good for them.  The professionals know what is needed in their states and 
districts.  Therefore, they are better able to serve the "people".

The politicians would ask if the "people" want amateurs "working" for 
their interests in Washington or would we want the politicians who know 
all the ins and outs of Washington.

Sarcasm?  Me or Laelth?

Actually I was quite sincere, as I believe Laelth was as well.  We've
argued this thread before.  While we've agreed on the basic ideas of his
post, I've extended the concept a bit more radically (and, if I remember
correctly, me and Laelth differ a bit on this).  I firmly believe that we
could cut the throats of lobbyist simply by increasing politicians
salaries with something a bit more commensurate for high profile
executives (entertainers for that matter).  Salary should reflect
importance, and it galls me to think we place more value on sports than we
do running our country.  It's pathetic, and it makes us look like the
idiots a vast portion of our country represents.  

Where me and Laelth differ, once again if I remember correctly, is that I
think more money should be spent on glitz as well.  Hell, you want to make
us look powerful enough so piss-ant third world countries won't want to
tangle with us, throw some money at our image.  A show of money tends to
make people look more imposing and untouchable.  Personally, I think it's
a show of power (an information age flex of muscles if you will).

You have a right to be confused by my post.  In my tirade of vehement 
disgust, I was spinning more tangents than a weaver.

My main point was that while the politicians like to pass themselves off 
as being both 1
)one of the people bent on fighting the beast which is Washington to help 
the interest of the common man and 2)the "good man" wheeler-dealer capable 
of supporting life, liberty, happiness, and pork projects from here to 
eternity.  Hypocrisy through and through.  The number one job of 
Congressmen is re-election plain and simple.  It starts day one and 
doesn't stop until they retire or become part of the 5% or so that don't 
get re-elected.  

They don't know how to deal with PACs and SIGs, the whore out to them.  
Because their constituencies care for nothing more than the pork they 
ladle, individual votes on key issues (foreign policy, taxes, regulation) 
are hidden.  

On the subject of founders intent and a non-professional legislator class, 
I was probably too vague.  They believed in successful citizens 
(businessmen, artisans, etc) leaving their jobs and duties and sacrificing 
their time and talent to provide quality, responsible leadership in 
Congress.  After the New Deal and the subsequent shift in power to the 
nation's capitol, legislators came to serve, but never went home.  They 
built their own kingdoms and wielded ever increasing powers to further 
their personal agendas.  Just look at the record of the Pork King himself, 
Mr. Rostenkowski.  He looked after his constituents well...lock, stock and 
pork barrel.

I agree with the premise you have.  I was merely being the Devil's 
advocate in order to sharpen your argument.  And you have done that quite 
well thank you.

My personal favorite target is the "Honorable" Ted Kennedy and his ilk.  
They have no inkling of what it takes to make a living while trying to 
support a family.  Their idea of "good government" is to throw enough 
money at a problem and it will go away, and guaranteeing their re-election 
by building constituencies that count on the monies sent down from on 
high (Washington D.C.)  This is the only way that they can guarantee their 
perpetuation of power.

As I may have explained before, my idea of government is that of the 
Jeffersonian model.  Very little, if any, interference in individual lives 
by the Federal Government.  The states would be responsible for the 
well-being of the citizenry.  The legislators would not be a "profession", 
but would be, as you said, responsive to the needs of the ordinary man.
The Democratic party put forth this system of govt up until the elections 
of the late 1920's and 1930's.  The actual change came with the electon of 
Harding and continues to this period.  Calvin Coolidge actually expressed 
this sentiment when he stated that "the business of America is business."

I can see in your position a deep-seeded respect for the ideals upon
which this nation was founded, and an appreciation for the point of
view of of our founders.  I can respect that, in a certain context.
But I'm a tinkerer, and a pragmatist.  When our system isn't working, I 
could care less about the intent of our founders.  I just want to make the 
system work, and right now the system isn't working.  If our politicians 
were "non-professional," that is, if they did not depend on politics for 
their livelihood, then most of them would starve.  Consider all the 
congerssmen, senators, governors, mayors, state congressmen, state 
senators, city councilmen, etc. that are necessary to make this country 
work.  There aren't enough rich people (people who could afford to run for
office, and support their families without job-related income) to fill all 
these positions, and even if there were, that wouldn't give us a very 
democratic society.  It would be government of the rich, for the rich, and 
by the rich.  That may be what our founders intended, but is that what we 
want?  It's not what I want.

As for pork, pork is a direct result of the current system.  Politicians 
who get financial support from PACs and wealthy individuals must "pay 
back" the PACs and the wealthy people that put them into office.  That's 
what pork is; it's payback for financial favors.  So my position is, take 
away the NEED for payback, by taking away the influence of the PACs and 
all the other entities that fund political campaigns.  If we pay our 
elected officials well, then they won't NEED to pay back their financial 
supporters because they won't NEED so much financial support.

Well, they might be important, but they have no special skills which make
them invaluable.  Anything that's replacable without a thought is hardly
important.  BTW, they're overpaid and underworked.  Yes, I've worked the

Well, there's two factors to consider here:

1.  Russia's in a state of transition and the economy's starving.  Nobody
is going to be making near there worth until their economy's straightened
out.  The people simply don't have the money to spend.

2.  The prostitutes in Russia do not make their living from local John's. 
They cater to Western Europeans and Americans primarily.  As such, their
economic welfare is independant from Russia's economy.  It relies, rather,
on the economies of the nations they "service" :)

I think when the economy starts recovering you'll see this disparity
gradualy decrease.

> Is it fair that because of a computer glitch, in  
> 1987 we were within 2 1/2 minutes of annihilation, and nobody cares?

Is it fair that it almost happened?  Well, probably no.  However, fair
isn't really a term which applies to the situation.  It's not fair that I
went to the beach last weekend and it rained.  Some things just happen.

Is it fair that nobody cares? Yes.  Have you ever tried to sit down for a
whole day and consciously worry about the planet?  It'll drive you to
insanity.  To live a productive life, it s sometimes necessary to ignore
the awful things which you can't control.  It's a survival instinct.  It's
kind of like thinking about death.  If you did it too long, you wouldn't
be able to get anything done.  What would be the point?  Similarly, if you
dwell on the odds of something catastrophic happenning (what with all the
weapons of the world in all those insane hands) you'll see there's a good
chance you won't wake up tomorrow.  Then what's the point of going to
work?  It might be your last day on the planet.

> What is capitol-based culture doing to the world?

It's still evolving, it's hard to tell.  However, you must remember that
our world has always been based on capitalism of one form or another all
the way back to the hunters and gatherers who bartered.  We've had bad
times before.  Maybe we're just having a bad humanity century :)

> Will it eventually drive us all mad? 

It depends on your concept of mad.  I already consider myself and most
people I know to be quite mad.  I lock myself in a room all day with

robtelee--

You are among the millions who find the personage of one Senator Edward 
"Teddy" Kennedy to be vile and despicable.

Like the other Kennedy's, he grew up in an environment of extreme 
privaledge.  His father's wealth and political connections paved a very 
smooth road to the best private schools and eventually into politics.  But 
as soon as he reached DC, he became less of a champion of the common man 
and more of a Lord of the Manor.  He sits upon the Hill holding reign over 
his subjects (the constituencies who elect him) and wielding power without 
checks to its usage.  He gives them sustanence to appease them (pork 
projects) not because of a feeling of compassion or paternalism, but as a 
sign of the master/serf relationship.  He "gives" them back their own tax 
dollars by the grace of his being.

All Mr. Kennedy has ever known or done has been in government.  He is far 
removed from the social and economic realities of every day life.  He has 
built one of the most powerful kingdoms ever known to Congress and sits 
like an unenlightened despot wielding his influence and believing himself 
to be above the contempt of his constituents.  And all along he claims to 
be the "good man".  He is worthy of the loathing he receives.

Teddy would like to be included in the history books as an equal to Thomas 
Jefferson.  I've read Thomas Jefferson.  I've studied Thomas Jefferson.

I have thought long and hard on this subject.  You raise _very_ good 
points about the current system.

1)politicians couldn't survive without government.
    Since we were discussing the Federal government, I'll stick with that 
at the moment.  I have no pity in my heart to the fact that politicians 
could not find gainful employment outside of government.  It is not the 
duty of US taxpayers to subsidize a class of people to the tune of 
millions of dollars a year because they possess no skills other than 
knowing "Robert's Rules of Order" and being able to dole out political 
leverage.  If this priviledged class is so out of touch  with the rest of 
society that they couldn't get a job, then they should pack it up and wait 
for extinction to come around.

2)not enough rich people to run for office
    The beauty of the current system is that you don't have to be rich to 
run for Congress!  Only things you need to do are to get your party's 
nomination (sell out what you believe in to tow the party line) and line 
up your backers to payroll you (PACs, SIGs, wealthy individuals).  Even 
wealthy individuals who run for Congress rarely spend nickel one of their 
own money.  The exeptions come when the candidate is a challenger or 
without a party (but then again, these people lose 95% of the time).  

3)Pork is political payoffs for financial help
    You're right.  The special interests use their medium of power 
(economic) in return for the Congressman's medium of power (political).  
Whores, all of 'em.

Since this is running long, I will finish it tomorrow.

but we have no business telling other people how to run their countries.  
i'm sorry, but i'm a little sick and tired of the Unites States acting 
like the world's policeman...a role we gave to ourselves, not one that 
that rest ofthe world asked us to do.

Actually they whine no matter what we do...If we police they whine cause
were screwing around with their country and if we don't police then they 
whine because we're allowing another country to screw around with them.

Pray, tell.  To what evil are you referring?  What evil plot has the 
Kennedy family contrived for the destruction of our nation?  What are you 
talking about?

have you ever been in a situation whence you can no longer see due to the 
amount of boogers on the windshield?  i have, and let me tell you its not 
fun, carening all over the road just because you didn't think to install 
those pesky little things commonly known as wipers.  Not to mention how 
the boogers got there in the first place. . .all your drunk friends 
hanging around until three in the afternoon, picking their noses and 
wiping their boogers on your car. . .and  they drank all your beer!!! what 
hosers.  at any rate (you want baby. . .But thats another. . 
.nevermind)you end up haulin down the freeway at ninty miles and hour and 
you can't freakin' see!!!  what a hassle. . .or. . .am i the only person 
this has ever happened to?  oops. . .oh well. . .bye.    themc

Seems the show is on its last legs, with yabbs coming down and all...

Just wanted to say goodbye and thanks to the following, should they ever 
read this:

    Natalie, I'll never forget the monkey balls discussion...
    Arachnoi, stop assuming about your opponent's habits and behaviours...
    GPF, just for being the Taco God
    Cosmos, don't lose your attitude dude, and keep listening to old 
Genesis... :)
    Cat, I promise to send you a letter soon...
    Htoaster, again, thanks for the space and freedom to voice my
 opinions...

    
Keep up the Struggle, Brothers and Sisters... :)

ANYONE with ANY plans, theory, parts list for the construction of a (at 
least, minimum) quarter watt, 220V, 7A laser....

please send info to: chrome@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu

If you feel you need financial compensation for your hard work, let me 
know and we can make a deal...

ALSO....Everyone with access to an account, send good, cheerful, and 
encouraging mail to TVNATN@AOL.COM.  NBC might not put them (TV Nation) 
back on this fall, so any fan mail helps.

Until Yabbs II comes around...

Adios,

There's a fascinating book I have at home...I'll go dig it up..It tells 
you how to construct any type of laser you want, from Communications grade 
up...I got it from my junior high library and have had it ever since.
I'll post it tomorrow.

I want to melt stuff, like eyeballs.

Well, I really want to do some holography before I sell it to a dj who 
wants a cheap laser for some light fx.
