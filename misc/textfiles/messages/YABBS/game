The best deal in video game systems is the OLD Sega. Seriously, I got one
for $40 or so, and get games for $10. The graphics are pretty good, 
considering, but the games aren't as original as some of the newer 
systems'. I use it for Shanghai, Fantasy Zone (an INCREDIBLY cool game, 
save the annoying music), and Zillion (another good game). I'm serious, 
its a steal.

Yeah, I got to play with a game gear last weekend.  Cute little machine, but
it wasn't that great.  The display smeared a lot (what can you expect from
LCD, but it really made it bothersome to try and play anything like Sonic). 
I really only got a chance to play sonic though.

I have heard that the gamegear is basically the old sega machine shrunk down
(ie, it has the same z80 processor and the same custom chips).  Anyone know

I'm not sure about Nemesis...  Go is an ancient Chinese game.  The
strategy is to place stones of your colour such as to maximize the
amount of area you contain.  If you surround your opponents stone in 
each of the Cardinal directions it is captured.  It's your basic
millenia old game, adequately played with stones and dirt.  However
our systems manager gets a little PO'd when people bring in stones,
dirt or even alcoholic beverages :-(

 For those of you GO freaks out there, there is an internet GO server
that is usualy up and running.  Just

I haven't done much with it.  From what I understand it just gives you a few

I have an insider which gives me 1meg, plus the 256k on the mb and the 256k

The best 2600 game was asteroids...i used to play that for hours...plus some
game that put a person in each corner (it was four players with the paddles)
and each player had a wall around them.  There was a ball that moved around,
and each player had a paddle next to their wall that they could use to
deflect the ball...when the ball hit their wall it did destruction, if it
hit their paddle it bounced like in breakout or pong.

it had fancy graphics and sound, which killed a lot of it...

Yeah.. I have it. It's Freddy Phracks Frontier Pharmacist. This one was 
done by Al Lowe (the same guy that did Leisure Suit Larry) and it's pretty 
good. It's got that computer junkie sense of humor in it... I haven't 
played it much but there's this one scene in it that's classic.. You walsk 
(walk) into this store and there are these sacks of potatoes along a wall, 
and on the sacs is written "Quail Potatoe" (that one takes a while to sink 
in.. think about it.) Anyway, it's pretty funny.. get it if you can

one of the top 10 scores in the nation. Yay!!! 
It's got all sorts of fun goodies, so look for it. it should be out in

I also think that the Infocomm games were really cool.  You didn't sit there
going "that lookssoooo fake.."  You could enjoy the game without caring
about
graphics.  Also, the amount of words that they understood was really quite
amazing..  Though I imagine that once the engine was writtenthat the games
came pretty easy..
I liked "Moonmist".  It was an easy game.. but a lot of fun.

The best deal in video game systems is the OLD Sega. Seriously, I got one
for $40 or so, and get games for $10. The graphics are pretty good,
considering, but the games aren't as original as some of the newer
systems'. I use it for Shanghai, Fantasy Zone (an INCREDIBLY cool game,
save the annoying music), and Zillion (another good game). I'm serious,
its a steal.
[------------------------]

   Yeah I used to own one of those.  Actually I still do but I think it's 
broke.  I have Zillion, too.  That's an EXCELLENT game.  I was rather 
surprised that there wasn't a lot of hype about it.  Have you gotten to

Has anyone heard much about Infocom's new release "Return to Zork"?  I got 
the demo from wuarchive, and it seems like it might be pretty decent.  The 
interface is not text.  You get a graphical view of each room as you walk 
into it, which is probably a more fitting style for an infocom game than a 
continuous motion graphic game like Ultima.  You get to use various 
icon-type tools to look at the stuff there (like Sierra, but it seems more 
complex than "use hand on wall" or something).  There's also over an hour 
of spoken dialogue in the game.  At the end of the demo, there's a great 
picture of Beautiful FCD#3.  I almost cried.  The demo says the game was 
released in mid-summer 93.  Was it?

P.S. Lost Treasures of Infocom is great!  I got eaten by a grue, and I

Date: Tue Sep 21 20:12:25 1993

I loved the Infocom era... I solved the Zorks, I solved Enchanter, and a 
couple of the older ones.  They started to get cheesy.

The game I was most impressed by, though, was Quarterstaff.  I was a beta 
tester for it.  It had a cool combat system... you had a proficiency in a 
variety of things (blunt, sharp, fire, cold, bow, etc.)  EVERY object in 
the game falls under one of those proficiencies.  Every object in the game 
also has hit points.  You can pick up a chair and throw it at something.  
It will do damage to the thing, and to the target.  Having a sword break 
if you whomp locks with it is annoying but realistic.  I once lost all my 
equipment in a battle, picked up one of my dead comrades, and started 
hitting the monster with his dead body.

I don't know whether Quarterstaff was ever fully released, but it's one of 
the few half-graphic adventure games I ever went for.

Yea, I think it was actuallyt released.  I remember playing it on my mac 
and thinking it would have been cooler if I had more memory and a hard 
drive (swapping two disks back and forth really sux).

Some company (I think it was Mindscape) put out a series of graphical
adventures for the mac with a really nice point & click interface.  (Deja 
Vu I & II, Shadowgate and some other one).  The graphics were pretty good 
but you could drag objects around, double click on your wallet to open it, 
then put a dollar in it, etc.  You could also do simple interaction by 
selecting the two objects and clicking on one of the buttons.

    gee, isn't this just great...more talk about piracy in a games base. i 
mean, you don't have to pirate to get games- check out freeware stuff like 
nethack, the various flavors of moria and angband, nettrek, etc. etc. and 
if you're really in the mood for some amazing pyrotechnics, just get a few 
quarters and head down to the arcade. 

    just about every pc games base i see you have something like a fifty 
message thread devoted to saying "stop piracy" or "pay your damn shareware 
fees." i mean, people that do it aren't really going to be miraculously 
convinced that if you pirate you will burn in the pits of hell...

    not that i'm against piracy or anything. it's just too boring. but 
don't talk about it here. excuse me, but i just don't like talking bout 
wares much. anyway, this one didn't make much sense either.

    so, let's talk about some games. real games. the sort of games you 
stay up till morning trying to win. or those ones with great fireworks. 

    let me start off at several points so i get more flames :-). first, i 
saw an article about the new zork a few weeks ago in newsweek. and it 
looks ho-hum. the graphics are great, sure, but there's no text to enter! 
it doesn't seem like zork. not really.

    has anyone yet seen the mac flight sim f/a-18? the release date
 was two days ago.

    i guess that's it. later.

wonderful.  They should be able to transfer the writing to speech fairly

Also, has anyone ever played OXYD, a weird shareware game?  I supposedly

If you really don't like it that way (I do), then hit F11, it's Gamma
correction for monitors and brightens things up nicely.  Only ver 1.1 or
above supports this though.

Anybody tried playing it with three machines, each running a different 
display for one character?  Looks cool as shit, goes slow as shit.  I 
think it's in the program or the machines trying to sync the displays, but 
if it could be significantly sped up by bridging the game machines to the 
network (to reduce packet travel time and interference) it might be great 
to keep from getting surprised. Any thoughts?

THere's supposed to be a new release of Doom (1.2) that will speed up the 
network games by using addressing instead of broadcast packets (something 
like that -- I'm no 14 yeard old networks wizard).  It will also support 
modem and serial link play.

After about 10 minutes of play it seems that the data flow

Hey sugahs did ya know that Doom has come out with a new level.
    It is called Nightmare and it warns you that it is not even remotely 
fair.
    The monsters are tougher and they teleeport randomly throughout the
levels.  Not only that but you can't use any of the codes. So if you are 
in for a bloodbath that you will most likely lose Contact me and I can get 
ya in touch with this game.

I had that one.....I seem to remember there was a PC version.  Never saw it, 
though.  Old games are pretty hard to come by, unless you chance upon one of
those special software sales of totally obsolete stuff.....
Unfortunately, that one got sold when my C128 went- cool game but a bit frust-

usual "bash wife, cash insurance policy" grunt sentences of other text 
adventures).  I really started to get going in the game before I gave it 
up, and I'd like to give it another try.

And Dragons...your   little guy was a X and you moved thru an ascii 
dungeon and fought stuff...anyhow, I was  wondering if anyone but me had  
everheard of it cause it's the only  game I ever beat in my life (and I 
can't find the disk with my guy on it *whine*) even though I cheated  
really bad to do so... *grin*

yeah, i used to have a copy of this...before the advent of shareware even 
i think...i played it on this thing called a zenith 100 (old microcomputer)
that my dad had at home...

if you're looking for something similar check out rogue or moria (which most
unix machines have)...rogue is my personal favorite...

and ignore anyone who tells you to play nethack...its just not the same...it
has too much shit in it...

a now-defunct company called epyx did a port of rogue to dos as well that was
pretty excellent...i still have the floppies for it lying around.

Subject: dungeon hacks wanted
Date: Wed Jul 27 20:29:39 1994

   Howdy YABBernauts, I think most MUDS suck and I am considering starting 
an "anti-MUD".  What is an "anti-MUD" you ask?  An "anti-MUD" would be 
like a big group D&D session, with a live DM and live players, rather than 
a computer for a DM that only takes commands if they're put in a certain 
"form".  The reason I don't like the standard MUD format is that the 
commands vary from MUD to MUD.  Sure there are some accepted MUD 
languages, but most of these take months of playing to learn.  This 'anti 
-MUD" would have schedualled times for playing and a maximum number of 
PCs, but it would be alot more "user-freindly" than a traditional MUD.  
Befor I embark on such a venture though, If anyone knows of such a thing 
that already exists, please inform me, I'd like to check them out and 
maybe get some pointers.  Also, If you would like to join as a partner in 
this still-uncertain embarkment, pahleeze let me know and you're in 
(basically).

Well, I'll play and/or GM just about any system... I'll send you a PC and 
a DM resume whenever I get around to making them up... any type of 
character that I should be warned _not_ to make? I like strange ones ;> 
A shortened form of a DM resume: I have or have access to (through 
my gaming group) every book for AD&D and most books for the other common 
RPG's. I'll email you a more complete one later... Just to let you know, 
I'm in the Estern time zone. and late playing times would be just fine for

All right. If you all want me to, I'll DM, but my work schedule is kinda 
crazy right now. On top of that, I'm starting soccer practice during the 
day in a couple of weeks, so I'm not going to have THAT much time... 
Therefore, if I'm DMing, I'm going to need a bit of help from the players: 
ie that they all have players handbooks or whatever they may need (if they 
have them) within easy reach while they're playing so that I don't need to 
look everything up myself (and waste valuable time). Also, once in a while 
I may not be able to make the games for whatever reason (like needing to 
get SOME sleep), so I'd like to have someone be an assistant DM who can 
take my place (with advance notice) and help me run the campaign the rest 
of the time. I tried doing this (on a smaller scale) here once before, and 
I know that it was a Hell of a lot of work... 'specially getting everyone 
in one place at one time. Otherwise I'll just be a player who may be 
absent from time to time... Let me know what you all want to do...

I agree a lot with what you said, but in SOME defence of D&D, I think that 
it largely depends on both the DM and the players as to whether it's a 
good game or not.  In fact I think it MOSTLY depends on the players.  If 
you have a group who are quite experienced, and are more seeking character 
personality development, rather than statistical advancement, then ANY 
system can provide highly enjoyable sessions.  But, I guess, if such a 
group of players exists, I would have to go on a reallife epic quest to 
find them.

Also, I am unable to take part in an on-line session, but would there be 
any interest in something equating to a PBM game ?  For me, a two day turn 
around would be workable, and I would be willing to DM or play.  Anyone ?

If you play by their rules, D&D does kinda suck...that's why I make my own 
adventures that make players think rather than "hacking their way thru a 
dungeon"....that's also why I like ravenloft...because it doesn't always 
stick to the accepted rules and the main goal is not treasure...however 
I'd gladly play anything I can get rules to.....is Earthdawn really that

yes....earthdawn is that good... it is quickly becomeing the favored

Earthdawn forces you into character development...it sin't much of an 
option...characters take forever to make up, but then you're going to 
extra careful with them because of it.  

 i find that D&D is geared for teenagers cuz they have the disposable 
income to waste on every tiny suppliment and companoin book that comes 
out...home rules are ok...but then what is a standard if everyone has 
different rules?  if i'm spending $20-30 on a game...i certainly shouldn't 
have to change the rules...otherwise i'd make my own game up...

Ummm... I'm not sure how many of you know this (I just learned about it 
yesterday) but there is now a internet-wide ban of ALL TSR products. This 
came about due to TSR saying that any discussion of their products on the 
internet was copyright infringement and, therefor, illegal... They went on 
to say that there is ONE place where it WILL be legal: their BBS which you 
have to PAY to get on. therefore, I am, as of now never again buying
 anything made by that company (including Dragon magazine, which is still 
halfway decent...)
Incidentally, (along the current train of thought here) Steyr: My playing 
group for RPGs actually has fun playing AD&D, although I must admit that 
we don't even come close to paying attention to the rules. WE pay more 
attention to character developement then to "statistics" and only use AD&D 
as something of a backdrop...
Also, I am currently in the process (almost finished!!!!) of writing my 
own RPG based on the world created by David Eddings in _The Belgariad_ and 
_The Mallorean_. If anybody on here would like to help me play-test it, 
let me know. (I would strongly suggest having read all 10 books 
before-hand though). If you do, I will send you a copy of the "Player's 
Guide" which will soon include illustrations. I have written David Eddings 
for "official" permision, in order to actually spread it around without 
infringing on his rights. If he (or his lawers, PR ppl, or whomever :) 
ever gets back to me, I'll know if I'll actually be ALLOWED to market it. 
From what I've finished so far, I have a feeling that anybody who is a fan 
of his and a gamer will want to play it, so I'm hoping to get a favorable 
response. If you want more details, leave me a note.

yep, mech warrior 2 was slated to come out around march of this year i think

never surfaced, i hope its not gonna become vaporware.

still, i think a server-client based battletech game, one that does the turn
by turn type in the manual would be really cool, esp. since it would have a lot
more strategy and a lot less what key to i hit to fire, damn it my keyboard 
stuck.

corellian corvette blows up, it pisses me off, I try and try harder
and harder each time I play but I can not beat it. 

Also does anybody know if in TIE fighter, if there is a place past the 
third circle of the secret order of the empire, I can not find out. And, 
when do you get to see the seret Tie fighter, in the directions is says to 
fly 6 fighter craft. ther only ones that I can fly are the TIE fighter, 
bomber, interceptor, assault gunoboat and TIE advanced. That is only 5, 
how do you get to the 6th one. If you have any answers, I woudl be

yeah, simcity (the original) is the coolest simgame i've seen...

will simcheat work on simcity 2000?  i'd be surpirsed if they didn't change
the file format...

and simcity is no fun if you cheat anyway...anyone can build a 200,000 person
city with tons of dollars, the trick is to get one starting from the 20,000
dollars they gave you...

a good way to make money is really just leave the thing alone for a while...
make a nice town...get enough people in it that you can charge 7% tax and
make $500/year, and then go for a walk or bike ride for a few hours and when
you come back you'll have quite a bit of dough...

also, fire depts aren't necessary...one will get them to stop complaining
about not having any, and will only cost you $100/year to run...

3 squares away from the road. Trust me it works, I have a city that has

FUN FACT:
I'm still looking for Amnesia, the computer game.  And I'll pay monopoly 
money or US money or whatever for it. :)

"Ya know what would be really fun....SimDeath"

I was thinking something more upbeat, with a catchy name:

    SimLimbo!

What is the deal with this simcheat thing?  I have simcity and all
I have to do is hit Left-<CTRL>+Left-<ALT>+<f>+<u>+<n>+<d> *all
at the same time* and you get $20,000 but only do it once in a
while or the city will turn against you, it is hard to explain
that though... I don't know if I have that totally right I have
Changed from MeSsyDOS to Linux and haven't played it in a while
so let me know if is doesn't work and I will figure it out 
again.  L8r

i kinda like making a huge city with one fire dept then letting a fire or 
plane crash loose on the city...had a megalopolis with only 1 fd. died in 
around 2 hours, explosions galore :)

it's note simcheat, but you can type FUND (in all caps) to get you a few 
thousand bucks every now and then. only problem is every 10 times or so 
you do it, you get a major earthquake, even if disasters are off

Muhaaaa!
I got it
in v1.0 of SimCity 2000 if you type(funky word coming up)  
porntipsguzzardo  you get 500k and all the technologie(i.e. fusion 
powerplants in 1900)
OR :).....if you just type ardo you get the 500k...
NOTE: this particular cheat only works in v1.0....there is a code for a 
later version but it involves clicking on certain tools and typing other 
stuff...and I didn't bother to write it down :)
Anyways..apparently it was in MacWorld but I have no idea as to what 
issue.

i believe i messaged earlier about that... hold down shift (or caps lock 
maybe) and type "fund"..do it too many times there's a big earthquake...
that's not in simcheat...all sorts of other neat little things like that 
built in to all the maxis games...or just about all of em...
