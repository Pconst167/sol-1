This base was created for the discussion of animation and cartoons.  It 
was stimpy's idea, but it should be pretty cool.  I'm more into the 
animation side of it (I always make sure to catch the Tournee's), but feel 
free to discuss whatever you want.

  I forget what it is called, but it is in most bookstores that are worth 
anything and it has some rats on the cover, swastika, etc...I think that 
there are two parts or something.  From what I hear it is based on stories 
that the author heard from his father, whom was a holocaust survivor.
  Someone out there has got to know more about this?!?

pretty simple.. Tetsuo just sorta get tired of getting picked on and goes

Akira is the guy who was vivisectioned and frozen in the huge golf ball 
that gets vomited from underneath the stadium in the latter part of the 
movie.
 
the blue guys were previous experiments in exploiting and extending human 
psychokinetic power.  wrinkly because they've been around since the war of 
20+ years since.
 
as far as i can tell, the aura machine is supposed to give a visual 
representation of the potential of a particular being to have wierdo 
psycho powers.

It was created on an Amiga... cancelled because it had an enormous budget

You have to read approximately three concurrent issues of Akira to get any 
idea of the sheer scope of the story. Marvel's (scuze me, Epic's) release 
of it was far too flaming expensive!
Comparing the comic to the movie is like comparing any good book to a 
movie made of it.

   I like mainstream comics.. Marvel, Dark Horse, mainly.  I had to quit 
right about the time spawn #3 from iMAGE came out... The new Spawns are 
done by different writers, but McFarlane art.  Frank Miller is doing a 
story, and so is Alan Moore... dear god, those are going to be great...

   I love R&S, but nobody watches it here. and they won't let me, either..
pricks.  Akira was too cool. I thought I was tripping, and I've never done 
drugs.. I think you'd have to watch it 3 of 4 times to completely get the 
story down, without readind the books...

as for Moebius, Dark Horse has a book by him out, I'm pretty sure... and 
he did my favorite Punisher poster... it's fantastic...

Agreed.  To compare Akira to anything but the finest is intolerable.  Some

as Mr. Scarfe's animation has to be the most intense animation I have ever

The best way to learn techniques is to read all the lame books (or look a 
t th pictures) at the bookstore and library about animation. All you need 
is to figure out the basics (figure out how a problem is approached). once 
you have done this read cinefex and american animator and animation 
magazine and cinefantastiqe and pixel visions and b-club and computer 
graphics world and any other lame ass mags. No mag will have cool in depth 
stuff that is exactly what you want, but you find you can always get info 
on techniques etc just by referencing the junk to the somewhat lame basics 
books. ITs all real easy anyway, no new technologies have really come to 
change things that a interneter cant get. And the onl obvious downside is 
that ppl do this junk for money, and aren't to hip to sharing stuff. Look 
at publishings of ACM siggraph for the absolute coolest computer animation 
and graphics stuff.

Zeta Gundam is okay. Bubble Gum Crisis is great, I've seen most of

What I've seen of Nadia has impressed the hell out of me. I havent seen
Venus Wars yet, but I intend to. 

The comic of Akira is available in paperback collections. Each of them is
15$ and contains only part of the story. I don't know why Marvel had to 
color Akira, since it makes it more expensive, which is contrary to 
the spirit of manga. Then again, that's probably the idea.

surviving the camps. his brother didn't survive, and in many ways his 
mother did not either. this book wasn't supposed to offend anybody. it was

    yeah, sure it would make a great animated movie, but the author didn't 
want to do it. there's this one part in maus 2 where he's a real person 
(wearing a mouse mask) drawing on a heap of dead bodies saying that he 
didn't want to make it into a tvshow or movie. somewhere in the middle. 

    but there have been many serious cartoon movies recently, like akira, 
(alright you probably meant -american- movie. well, gee. have there been 
any serious american movies lately? sorry, bad joke) and i think that was 
mid-eighties. there've been many serious cartoon movies. later.

    well, i'm not that familliar with miyazaki's work, although it is 
(at least what i've seen) pretty good. but, disney (yes, disney) movies 
are, generally better -animated- than most anime i'm familliar with. 
however, the character designs are terribly simple and the movement
 is rather artificial. i simply gave akira as a reference point because it 
seemed most people have seen it.

    that reminds me. who the hell was akira? i'm pretty sure it wasn't in 
the bottles.. i know they answered this in the manga but i never read it.

    oh, and the dagger of kamui really is worthwhile to see. if not for 
the plot (which ends up being a really big coincidence), then for the 
fight scenes. it is rather gory, though. the average shinobi doesn't last 
very long. i'd advise you to rent it (hell, blockbuster might even have 
it). if this didn't make much sense.. it's been a long day.

is that it was the human physical body of akira in the bottles
as he was chopped up to see if they coulds find out how
he worked.....

but the spiritual essance of akira, being such a powerful
physic i suppose he left enough of a residue in his remains to
be called on by the 3 'children'.
or the appearance of akira at the end could be attributed to some

Actually, most of the Disney movies I've seen are not on a level with most 
Anime movies I've seen.  Disney right now seems to be trying to blend 
computer animation into their work, but the super-high resolution rendered 
scenes don't mesh with the drawing styles of the animators.  In addition, 
the animation is often very flat, almost reminiscent of Hanna Barbara 
features, though with a lot more detail.
In Japanese animation, or at least in H. Miyazaki's movies, the animation 
is done as if he were filming a live action movie, using basic cinematic 
techniques that are often ignored in Disney (and most American) animation. 
Check out some of the panning shots in Totoro or Porco Rosso.  He does 
these neat flying scenes where you can see the depth of field and the 
action in it.

    the disney character designs are rather simplistic, i agree, but once 
you look at the fluidity of the motion of disney stuff you may change your 
opinion. disney is a big, rich company. it can afford to hire lots of 
animators to make their movies fluid. the effect is still childish- but 
extravagantly childish, if that makes any sense.

    most anime i've seen look better, but characters dont move with the 
same fluidity. for instance, there is usually a -lot- of shading in anime, 
while much of the american stuff has maybe 16 colors.. 

    the art itself (isn't anime supposed to be an art form?) may be much 
more impressive than the american character designs, but many japanese 
studios use lots of cheats to cut down on the number of cells they draw. 
like, they don't paint a cell every frame.. (i.e. 15 fps instead of the 
"full" 30 fps). i was talking about the quality of animation. the quality 
of the art is purely subjective to the individual. gee, i still don
't make any sense..

No, you do make sense.  I think we haven't correctly defined what we are 
comparing.  If we compare Disney movies to Anime movies, the comparison is 
valid.  However, most people have seen only Anime tv shows or OVA series, 
which have cheaper animation.  Look at a show like Ranma 1/2, of which 
there are 200+ episodes.  In the 4 of them I've seen, the animation was 
very simple, and often boring (the humor of the show makes up for its lack 
of artistic design).  This is also true (except the humor bit) about 
american cartoon shows.  Beavis n Butthead is a prime example.  The work 
on the show is minimal (as it should be).  Unfortunately, the animation on 
that particular show is improving (much to creator Mike Judge's dismay).  
What I'm trying to get at is that American Studios often use the same 
style through all formats of animation (tv, movie, etc.) while the 
Japanese adapt the style to the medium on which it will be presented.  
IMHO, that's the way to go.

    while i agree with most of your post, i disagree with your statement 
that ovas and tv shows have significantly worse animation quality. i mean, 
look at a (ancient) tv show like macross. it was meant to run for what, 30 
eps., and the animation was pretty damn good for the time. the last 6 eps 
by the way, were just tacked on at the end. also, gundam (and all of those 
descendants) had really nice art.. 

    in addition, it seems like a lot of people first see anime movies- 
usually something along the lines of akira. of course, this does not 
include those strangely translated and dubbed anime on television 
(robotech and dragon quest/dragon warrior come to mind). the stories are 
usually significantly censored to make sense to little kids and to give 
more room for commercials.

    but american animation, for the most part, is simply aimed at little 
kids. this is the main reason why americans can afford to use such simple 
character designs. that is, little kids aren't very discriminating. and 
anyway, popular american culture has deemed animation as too simple a 
medium for an adult story to be told maturely. i use the term adult story 
to mean a story aimed at adults, not just those porn/hyperviolent stories. 
look at the most recent american animation movies: aladdin, beauty and the 
beast, etc. these are childrens stories. the closest americans have come 
to an adult cartoon was cool world, and from what i hear it sucked. 

    one last thing. i find it interesting how american animation hardly 
-ever- has shadow or shading. look at the average saturday morning 
cartoon: no shading, maybe four colors a character, usually pretty choppy 
animation and a lousy background. but then again, we've comparing the best 
of each country.. i wonder if a mediocre japanese cartoon is as bad as a 
mediocre american cartoon. sorry about this post being incoherent...

Bill Keane is kinda overly happy and optimistic.  His kids are cute, but 
they can get annoying.  I had a friend named Bill Kuehn (pronounced keen). 
Have you ever seen the Family Circle Jerks?

other worthwhile comics, like Zippy the pinhead or the FarSide!

Who's Zippy the Pinhead? We don't have him/her in the Burlington Free 
Press. I like the Far Side too usually. :) One of my favorites. Along with 
Calvin and Hobbes. I have a stuffed siamese cat named Tao that used to 
tackle me. I grew up a bit and she stopped coming around and that was the 
day the music died. :)

Zippy's awesome - makes fun of just about everything. he's a hare krishna-
looking pinhead, and in his latest adventures he's with this 70's style
guy named claude and they got caught in a snowstorm, so they had to take
refuge in this trailer park bar run by a snapple/jack daniels guzzling
jukebox collecting hick who's trying to get his daughters married. well

6 hairs on top tied by a bow, and he wears a mumu.he's got a pinhead
wife named Zebrina and two kids named Fuelrod and somethign else I
can't remember. He's got two friends he hangs out with, Claude, a 
70's type quasi-hick, and Griffy, who;s actually modeled after the
writer of the strip. And his nemesis is Mr Toad, this Giant suit-wearing
toad (of course).

well, a quasi- anything is a sort of something. he's sort of a hick. he's
got perpetual stubble (lucky comic characters don't have to shave) and
talks like a hick, dresses sorta like one, but he lives in the city. andd
i think he's into cars, monster trucks and the like, which adds more
hick points

You know there is nothing wrong with Bil Keane or what he does.  The 
Family Circus has been designed to make you laugh.  It is a circus. 
 Thercus of life.  Everybody has those days from hell when all they want 
to do is kill the kids.  Every child when asked who did something replies  
"Not Me"  You can not condemn a man for calling things as he sees them.  
That would make you a pretty closed minded person.  Family Circus is all 
in good fun.  Let's leave it that way and stop trying to make something 
out of nothing.  Bil Keane is a genius as far as I'm concerned.  He has 
made me laugh ever since I can remember and he still does.

Sincerely,
Lacey.

I think all of Macross II is available.  I have most of one episode of

who had a band and got turned into cartoons in some whacked out world. 
and they always ended the show with some cheesy music vidio. the cartoon 
sucked, but i was wondering if anyone else had seen it before.....

just curious,

does anyone remember a cartoon by Hanna Barbara back in the mid '70s that 
was a big time rip off of Scooby doo.  Something about a dune buggy that 
spoke.  Had a character that looked just like Shaggy that fixed the thing. 
 I know the characters were also on the Laugh Olympics.

Speed Buggy!!!!!!

70's cartoons are pretty much the best.  Was it Hanna Barbarra that made all
of the super heroe ones?

Thundar, Space Ghost, Birdman, Mytor, The Herculoids, SuperFriends, Spiderman,
Ironman, Fantastic Four, The Galaxy Trio.

mid 80's were cool too:  Dungeons and Dragons, Spiderman and His Amazing 
Friends, The Incredible Hulk, Voltron, G-Force, Thunder Cats.

The old shows were awesome.  I still love Godzilla movies even now after
seeing them as an adult so I have no doubt that the old episodes are
still awesome.

Oh, by the way, I just got done reading the book: "The Death and Life of
Superman".  A definate must, the comic series was awesome to actually see
the final battle, but the book was incredible!  The new 3 comic book series
on him going out to find Doomsday's body is pretty damn good too, but kind
of rushed.  Oh well, what modern comic or cartoon doesn't rush too fast?  :)

Mytor.  I don't remember those at all, if you could elaborate for me.  As 
for Thundar, that was a great cartoon.  Freaked me out when I was little 
to see the Statue of Liberty thrown on its side and Washington DC turned 
into a slave plantation ruled by evil wizards.  What was the name of his 
nemesis, the wizard with the two faces.  One was nice and cheery and the 
other a sadistic freak?  If anyone else can answer, I would appreciate it.

Natalie-

Please excuse the following as it is not a spewing of right wing garbage.  
And this is not an Andy Rooney Sketch either.

I once did a paper for a writing class about just what was the collective 
called the smurfs.  There is an unknown number of smurfs living happily in 
an agrarian utopia each taking according to their need, but giving 
according to his ability.  There is no greed (except for Greedy smurf who 
was a fringe element at best), hate (I even remember them helping out 
Gargomele a few times), or lust.  Everyone dressed the same (excpet for a 
few smurfs who were known by the task which they performed 'farmer smurf' 
'hand smurf', etc), lived; in the same dwellings.  And they were all 
utterly obedient to Papa Smurf who ruled without dissention.

Let's face it we are talking Communist Utopia here folks.  Let's get out 
the Manifesto playbook and run in play by play.  Papa was the enlightened 
ruler who never asked the majority what they thought.  And why did he 
alone get to wear a different colored hat and pantaloons?  Notice how they 
crushed the intellgentsia and belittled reason no matter the circumstance 
(Brainy getting beaten repeatedly).  Book burnings anyone.  And there was 
no need for money, because everyone's needs were met in their entirety 
without asking.  

I can only hope that one d
I can see one day the far-right coming out with a cartoon called Smurfs II 
where the smurfs idyllic lives are crushed by EuroDisney tearing down 
their forest home to put in the new "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" Ride.  The 
smurfs woul play upon the '90 revolts in Eastern Europe, overthrow Papa, 
and move to a market econo y coupled with democracy.  

I apologize Natalie, I didn't sleep much last night.

   Didn't mean to trash on other systems, I just prefer the AD&D universe, 
plus I hear there's a new AD&D campainge that take place in the elemental 
planes....can't wait to play it.  I don't really know any other systems 
but if you wanted to DM some, that would be okay....I just don't like to 
spend hundreds of dollars buying manuals for different systems......
anywayz..later

Yeah, it was an underground comic when I was living in San Francisco in 
the late 60's.  Some really weird stuff in that comic.

   DOH! :) I think I did illustrate yer point rather well :) Actually I 
joined in the TSR boycott so I won't be playing the new system any time 
soon.  As for GENCON....where is it this year.....I won't be able to 
go...just curios.....Once I get my license I'll be going to the consumer 
electronics show in Vegas....I hear they are great.

GENCON is in milwaukee this year...as it is every year...it looks as 
though its gonna ba a good time too....John DeLancie ("Q" for star trek is 
gonna be there and so is Roddenberry's wife.) is one of my favorite star 
trek characters.  Anyways ... enuff babbling....that electronics thing in 
Vegas seems interesting..the  latest in cybernetics eh?
