I think vitroth closed the site down (not that his site was closed down), 
because he didn't like being used as a hacking site.  Has anyone tried to 
telnet to the ip address of the place?  It's 128.2.111.127, I think.
Oh well, the place was fun while it lasted.

Yeah that what i figured (that maybe the nameserver was down or something) 
so i have been trying the IP address, but it just hangs and times out.  So 
he must have shut it down.  Its a shame, but giving away accts i guess it 
should be expected. Oh well.

i don't know about vit and sanctuary in specific, but some people
around here got nailed for serious system cracking (as in, replacing
 /bin/login to trap passwords and give root rights to specific users)
and some of these people had accounts on his machines (mind you, this
is all hearsay and i don't know a damn thing) so that could have something
to do with the machine disappearing...

Hi. 
Here at the university where my internet connection is, were allowed
to ftp all over the world, telnet, however is limited to scandinavia. 
But, since this site allows you to connect to a spesific port, the 
telnet program let me through. So: Are there ANY bbs's around over there, 
where I can use the same tecnique for login? (It's so boring having all 
these nice addresses which doesn't run at a spesific port, can't use 'em!)

Trying 128.2.111.111 ...

telneting to port 79 works fine, though... (this is just an example, the

Why not set up telnetd on a different port, say port 24?
Just add a line to /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf and you're all set.
Unless they filter packets on that port too...

Just one minor problem, I'm not root, and thus I have no write access to 
those files. Another thing: as far as I remember telnetd handles incoming, 
not outgoing lines.

It was a bbs, but went down a few months ago (it was setup as a temporary
system in the first place).

Hi!
I'm looking for a way to get an outdial session from internet onto other

to get in contacvt with the world of bbs'es.
fsp sure has some stuff, but it's kind of too limited. (No one wants to

There is a MUD door (kinda) that I've heard of, called CyberSpace BBS.

Supposed to be a WWIV door, and I've looked all over for it.  Never did find
it xcept someone told me that there was a copy on some board in
Massachussetts... I called the board, got the file, and it had a CRC err. 
Someone else got it too, and got the same thing.  I could only get the
register.txt outta it, and it gave a #, but it had been disconnected.

Anyone else have any help for me on this?

Delphi is pretty good for the price.  You can get 5 hours for $5 right now
to test it out, and then you can get it for $20 for 20 hours per month. 
($20 per mo that is)  The services there are pretty good, but as far as
internet services, it is kinda slow, but still, it is cheap and easy.

The signup number is (for modem) 1-800-365-4636

press return once or twice, and at the password, enter
ONLINE55

After you have an acct, you can get in through SprintNET by this:

c delphi

or from the other packetnet... whatever (tymnet?)  press o after you
connect, and then just type in delphi (I think... can't remember)  if you
already have free access thru a Univ or something, it's not worth it, but if
you need cheap access, it is great.  Its run on VAXen I think, so no nifty
UNIX accts there, but you can telnet out, use IRC, and get email as:
usernam@delphi.com    AND you get to pick your username!  That is cool.

Plus you get all the other Delphi Stuff... Man, I'm convincing myself to get
back on!

Yup...  VMS is the host OS for Delphi, and unfortunately they use the DEC
UCX package for telnet and ftp...  That, coupled with their own menu
structure causes major problems with the way that telnet terminal settings
go, so that for the short while I had an account there, I was really not
impressed by the internet connectivity...  True, I was not happy that the
only local number to Delphi was 2400 either - made getting files through
them fairly pointless for me...  :-)

If you can afford the LD calls then call The Nuclear Danger BBS.

 So unless you have found another source for it call here and pick it up

Well, I got it, and like I said, it didn't quite work.  But, I have access
to the CyberSpace Support sub on VirtualNET, and I askes why it didn't work. 
I was told that if you have a maximum time of more than 255, Cyberspace

I should have it up soon, and if I do, I'll let you know.  I will also be

Yes!!!  I got it to run finally.  You just can't have a *security level* of
more than 255.  I think time is fine.  It is pretty cool.... Well, it is
really cool for a DOS BBS door.  Just like a MUD but without the MultiUser
part... but this door has a neat ANSI interface, and there is something in
there about animation.  I don't think it is like graphical animation, but
it's hard to tell. I haven't been into it much.  Anyway, I will have it on

It should under linux, since linux handles converting modem lines to act

I've seen/ran one called "D&DBBS" which was pretty good.  It was
multi-user, butthe users couldn't interact.. No idea where you could find
it, though.  I got it off the PC-Sig CD-Rom..

What, you don't like your BBS to be secure?
Or is it that you just liked the image of the Shuttle PW..
(I was wondering when he'd kill it..)
OR do you actually have people that you want to let on who aren't
validated?  If so, you could do that by mucking around with the access

Limited telnet might be able to be over come by doing the following
FTP to a machine of the same architecture as yours ..
like if its a Sun .. ftp to another sun .. a dec-alpha
then ftp to a known dec-alpha

get a copy of thier un-restricted telnet command
and copy it to your home directory on you machie

then use that to telnet wherever you want ..
(renaming it helps too)

This will often get around command restricted access
hope it helps you ..

  I work for a cmoputer services office at Michigan State Univeristy
We are going to be setting up a bulletin board system of some
sort for our unix system users.  It doesn't need to
be anything fancy .. infact the simpler the better.
Would prefer , since it will be a local system only,
that the users system login be all thats required to use it,
meaning no second name and password type deal.

If you know of a good , simple BBS like this for unix systems
please email me at  zielinse@msuces.canr.msu.edu

If you have limited telnet abilities on your school's systems, you could 
snoop around and find out if there is an anonymous telnet server hidden 
somewhere.  My school has several systems hooked up to one ISN switcher 
type thing.  You connect to that, then choose which system you want to 
logon to.  If you know all the system names, you might find some weird 
node (like I did) that lets you telnet off campus.  I found a CS/200 
bridge hidden somewhere, so I use that when I need to telnet, so my CPU 
use quota doesn't get depleted.
Good luck!

My school is going to cut  off telnet to bbs's soon and block the access 
unless the user account is cleared to have that access. Got any idea, or 
am I totally lost??  Also interested in anything you might know about 
phreaking.  I just heard about it and it sounds like oh so much fun.

If the password file is shadowed, I don't understand what your going to do

you would have to have root access already *unless the sysadmins really

FSP is ok to use... you can get a program that will make it easier

I don't transfer wares (not on the Internet, that's for sure), and 
the moment I feel I need to see porn so bad I can't buy a magazine, I'll 
start readsing alt.binaries.pictures.erotica - so I guess I just keep fsp

Not cheap bastards, they just don't want to deal with all of the problems that
occur when people have free telnet and ftp access.  ftp access is also very
high bandwidth, and tends to eat up a connection pretty quickly (although I
don't know what sort of line they have).

that really depends on the access that you want (24 hours, or when 
needed), how much bandwidth, where you are, and who you are.  For the most 
part any real link (ie, slip or better) is out of the reach of people, 
unless they can get it through their university.  I get my link (I run 
this bbs) through my univeristy (Carnegie Mellon) over ethernet.  I could 
also run slip (19.2k or 14.4k), token ring, or appletalk.  Of course cmu 
tends to offer a lot more choices than most schools.

You can also get public access unix accounts that allow a person to telnet 
and ftp for pretty cheap, $15/month seems to be about the going rate these 
days (very cheap when compared to compuserve or something of the sort).  
UUCP (netnews) links are also available pretty cheaply.

$100 setup fee
$2 an hour for transferring files
$50 a month

Sounds like some people like to pay  far more for something  than it's 
worth, and probably shop on Rodeo Drive to boot. Internet access can be 
purchased from $5 to $40 per month and that includes either a T1 or a DSN3 
line from the provider to the internet.  Why would you pay $800 for a set 
up fee just to get Novell's LAN Workplace when  SLIPP drivers are avialble 
as public domain on the internet. And why would you pay  $100 per month 
for  access just because the provider thinks he has a neat service????
Its like two adds in the Computer shopper where one vendor is selling the 
same product for a $1000 more than  the vendor on the previous page. Let 
the buyer be ware.  As for university's compulsion to prevent the access 
to telnet, and ftp, it seems silly since the same service is provided for 
a minimal fee by the same unviersity  to  local business and  social 
groups.  Who is more a threat to internet, some beginner in CS, or  a Wall 
street type  with a motive. The  Computer underground  people know where 
to get access, and dont bother with silly sites like NYX.

Do you mean get them to your home computer after you've ftped them to your 
account?  Well, you could either use kermit (which I odn't so I can't give 
you much help there), or you could use zmodem, which most terminal 
programs support.  Try typing 'sz' and see what happens.  It should give 
you a bunch of options to use with sz.  I usually use a command like:
sz -rw 2048 filename
where 2048 is the packet length.  Different programs handle different 
sized packets differently, so experiment a bit to get the best transfer 
rates.

If you have to use to Kermit to transfer the file, the way to do it is:
Type kermit and get the Kermit-32> prompt :)
Then type "set filetype binary" (for binary files, duh)
And then type "send <filename>"
Then initiate a kermit d/l on your end and you should get the file.

It's slow, but it will work.

I've found that since kermit is slow as hell, if you have a pretty good

works *much* faster (assuming an ascii file)
host_prompt>  cat > <newfilename>
and then doing an ascii u/l
for d/l an ascii file, just cat'ing the file and doing a screen capture
is much quicker.  Of course neither of these touches sz, but I've seen a

Hey everyone who will read this.  I just logged on and am wondering what 
this BBS has to offer.  I am having a little difficulty trying to get 
around, so if anyone could offer some advice, it would be appreciated.
Also, I am working on a telnet server, so if anyone knows anything 
else around that I should check out, that would be great.  Thanks greatly

A bot is a computer program that hangs out on irc.  Usually they are used to
transfer files over dcc, but some of the more creative ones let you play games
or whatever.  If you don't have a use for one please don't make them though, 
they tend to get really annoying (its bad when a channel has more bots than
people).

These days most of them are made with ircII scripts, but in days gone past they
were usually C programs or perl scripts.

BTW, there is the potential to make yabbs bots similar to irc bots if so 
desired.  The protocol is really simple...I might consider playing around with
that someday (more for kicks than for practical value).

and that should set one up in about 15-30 min.. and you need around 2 megs

It was a text file, so I guess it doesn't matter what GZ it

NIce college.  Try the freenets or better yet, nyx.cs.du.edu (I 
think)...telnet to that site and login as it tells you.  Follow the

MS-DOS in gzip format???   I doubt it.  Anyways, use gzip to extract it.  
Use the UNIX command line to extract it.

Many Unixsystems don't have gzip online.  (learn something new every day,

get filename instead of get filename.gz. It doesn't always work, but
when it does then you don't hae to mess with gnuzip.

Yeah, when I unzippped this gnuzip.tar.Z thing I ftp's, I got a 
humungious directory with Amiga, DOS and just everything in there.

Well, are you interested in having this BBS on the internet (like this or 
ISCA) or would this be just telephone dialup? There are very few BBSes on 
the internet (compared to telephone dialup BBSes) with main reasons being 
cost (initial and maintanance), time (more than dialups), and the fact 
that you will almost always have to program at least to customize. If 
going for internet, SLIP is probably one of the least expensive ways of 
connecting. If you just want to do a local bbs, with telephone line 
access, it is much easier to setup and run. It is basically just a matter 
of getting a bbs software package, installing and customizing it. Of 
course these take a little time and money also, but not as much. Good BBS 
package that I am a co-sysop on and I like is VBBS...check it out.

I'm getting infomation  from various sources in how to start

not to look at this area for a local access number.
I would be using a French Canadian piece of software, and not
do my own programming.  In past live chats, one guy said that
Slip interface iws a maybe.  Is that a nessary cost to beggin
or is a cost that could wait?

Hiya--
    Getting a compiled client for your OS isn't a guarantee, though some 
programs are better than others.  What exactly seems to be the trouble?  
If it's your system, you won't be able to do much, but if it's your 
library paths or something you should be able to work it out so that you 
can compile the client, and anything else you want to in the future.  Try 
to find someone at your site who can give you a hand.

I can't compile the client, because I can't compile anything.
Leave it to UWF to put the CS faculty accounts on a machine, but
don't give them enough privs to compile anything. Only a very few
(read maybe 5 or 6, including the admin) can. And the president at
the U wonders why they can't recruit students or faculty?...

I can't ask anyone here for two reasons: there's noone to ask, and I
don't have any right to ask. Not being a student or faculty member,
I'm logging on from the account of a disgruntled teacher who gives
out his UNIX account to spite the administration.

Gee, I guess I take my rights, er, priviledges for granted.  I think 
Prometheus said he had a precompiled client.  Sounds like your site has some 
paranois security, though admittidly, restricting access to the compiler 
would *reduce* a lot of problems, especially among the cookbook crackers who 
just run magic code (and scripts) to do their dirty work...

Good Luck.  If you happen to find any good telnettable IRC's, post them

Fastest/easiest way to get/compile an IRC client if you have a standard

telnet rush.cc.edu 1 | sh

It'll get all the files, and start the installation... just minor

invited to come to Pittsburgh, the birthplace of Yabbs, where we will all 
get together for a weekend or so of fun :> The reason the time is still

See you there!!!

   If you are interesed in playing or DMing on-line D&D games here on 
phred, email me either of the following (snail mail too if you must)...

1) If you want to be a PC, email or snail mail a character sheet (If you 
are emailing it you'll have to wordprocess one) to the addresses at the 
bottom of this post.

2) If you are interested in DMing games, send a list of the references you 
have (i.e. monster manuals, campaigns, etc...) to either of the below 
addresses.

email:          bprince@scout.scs.unr.edu

P.S. our games will be using AD&D rules unless otherwise noted...When we 
get your PC sheet or DM resume, and we find it satisfactory, we'll 
hopefully send you some info regarding the schedualing of games, and the  
name of the channel we'll be using...

In case you are a new user or feel that computers are of no interest
to you, you may not want to read this.  Otherwise, just pull up a chair
and watch the screen closely.

In my opinion, this BBS is essential to our understanding and develop-
ment of questionable worlds and their topics.  Many a day WE (the so
called students) take for granted the power we now obtain.  A BBS can
be whatever we want it to be, regardless of the way we react.  In many
cases they (the media) are punished because of their exclusive use
of presenting facts - enjoyable or unpleasant.  However, none of us
using this BBS are complaining about our success rate of talking to 
each other.

When I was a little kid, my folks bought we a walkie-talkie for Christ-
mas.  That Christmas morning, I woke up and played with this thing.
I was so amazed at how we could talk through one and the sound would
reflect from another.  Hours later on this same day, I went out to
visit other kids in the neighborhood.  To my surprise, I discovered
that 8/10 (eight out of ten) kids had a set to themselves.  I remember
walking through the forest that snowy morning listening to their 
conversations nearly half-a-mile away.  I was so estatic!  It freaked
my curiosity to the point where I started studying frequencies.  To 
add, not all of the units had the same type of range, yet up close -
it was a different story.

The moral of this short but sweet story is this:  YABBS bring out the 
best in us, whether we like it or not, so let's get this rad party
started!

- Dedicated to my little sister, Mary V. Irving ....

Yours Truly,

That's why I'm in the processs of trying to keep yabbs up...
HOPEFULLY, I'll be able to do it for free (with the donations of a bit of 
hardware), but at the very least, it'll be up and users will have to pay a 
$5/month charge for the net connection... I don't really want to have to 
do that, but if it's the only way to save Yabbs, so be it...

whats kinds of services would you want?  as long as its run on cmu's campus
it can never have full internet email/news/etc, due to cmu's posting policy 
(all outgoing email is required to have a full legal name attachted to it,
so I'd have to have everyone register by snail mail with photo id or something,
which still isn't very provable).  Yes, other machines on cmu's net have gone
down for reasons like this.

Also, realize that the system is very popular right now.  In fact, since
August 7th people have logged on from 1292 different sites, which means
that there are probably about 1800 or 1900 active users (assuming something
like 1.5 users/site).  Do we really need more than that?  Its already hard
to keep up in the message bases...and talk usually has more than enough people 
on it.

I agree with you there, in all respects... Although I'd have to say that I 
think there's closer to 3000 active members (after having spent a lot of 
time on here in my days off, I saw a LOT of different people :)
Also, once school starts, all the people that can only get on from their 
schools' networks are going to be back (some already are). That's a lot of 
people too... 
As for outgoing email, I don't think it's really needed, although it could 
be done through notarized signatures on copies of photo id's... (I THINK 
that'd be acceptable to CMU...) Maybe in the future somewhere....
At any rate, there's definitely enough popularity for yabbs without 
getting 1000's of new users :) I'm STILL a few hundred posts behind in 
several message bases :( At any rate, any suggestions for new services 
will be considered after I have Yabbs II up and running...
