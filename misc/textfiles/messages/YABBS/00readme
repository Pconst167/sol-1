These are all of the message bases from the original yabbs (yabbs.phred.org
or originally phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu) as they were at the time of its death
(which was 11:09:41 on Sept 4, 1994 for those who are curious).  They are
provided here in a human readable format, that as a bonus happens to be the
same format that most unix mail readers use.  The easiest way to read the bases
is to just load it up into your favorite editor (or use more) and page through.
Otherwise if you use elm or pine (two popular unix mailers), you can copy the
message bases to your mail directory (usually ~/mail or ~/Mail) and they will
appear as extra mail folders under those programs.

Note that these are pretty big.  The whole directory weighs in at about
five and a half megabytes, which is bigger than user quotas on most unix
systems.
