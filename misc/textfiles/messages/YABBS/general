obviously everyone online here is a true social misfit. . .outcasts from
society who have ABSOLUTELY no social skills. . .c'mon folkz. . .prove me 
wrong!  POST SOMETHING!  anything at all in fact!  call me an asshole if 
you like, but i can't keep trying to carry on a conversation with myself 
for very long. . .post whatever comes to your mind. . .who knows, mebbe 
someone will even respond. . .

anyway, i'm really intrested in some more ideas for new message bases & 
such. . .what the heck do you all want to talk about?  i decided i was 
interested in a free association base. . .so i asked htoaster to create 
it. . .it probably even exists right now as i'm typing this. . .if you've 
never seen free association bases before, or if have & think they're cool, 
then subscribe and start posting there. . .it's lotsa fun & we can 
probably generate a lot of messages real fast there. . .

I haven't actually tried this, but I've heard from reliable sources that 
it's the best way to do lobster.  I'd like to find a restaurant that 
served it.  Either that or buy a house with a kitchen so I could try

I was talking to this guy a couple of days ago and he told me about the

What this guy's frat does is that they heve these parties where they make 
this Jello, but instead of making the jello with water, they make it with 
liquor. Is that something or what? I mean, can't you just picture this 
party where a bunch of people are walking around with these bowls of 
jello... just thinking about it's making me laugh...

"no more jello man... no more..."

and imagine what the puke looks like.. you'll see little pools of slime

fucked up/puke stories to tell.  I do have a great one about a great party 
I had for amy birhtday--it was  a SEX TOY party!  Boy, was that one  a 
winner!  People came handcuffed, with whips, pornos, leather, nipple clips 
(OUCH) and electronic appliances!  My roommate got really drunk and put a 
condom over one guy's foot and sucked his toe.  We handed out condoms at 
the door because it was a safe sex toy party.  ANd gloves.  ;)
Luckily, noone ended up in my bed at the end of the night.  :)
    
So, if any of you social misfits are looking for a REAL party, have a sex 
toy party.  I guarantee a great time.  We're hosting a sequel and

Every time I have modem/virtual sex (not the same thing, but I'm making a

my partner to type back his/her response before I continue.  It somehow

I don't know what would possess you to *want* to get on CIS, but if you can
telnet, then you can connect to hermes.merit.edu and type "compuserve" to
get a connection.  Since the connection between Merit and Compu$uck is fast,
they charge you for a 9600 connection, but it works and you can sit down at
an IP-connected machine and do it without a modem.  Of course the Navigator
doesn't quite have TCP/IP support yet... <snicker>ÿ

I could, and have done that before.  The problem is that the best timer
that I have has a resolution of 3 hours, so it would have to be off for 3
hours each day.  I will probably bring it back next year so that things
don't crash like this again though.

If you look in magik issue #1 they made a list of interesting internet
systems.  BBSes really haven't hit the net that hard, so as far as I know
there aren't any other public bbses on the internet with the same angle
as this one.  You might look around in usenet though, there is a lot of
interesting stuff there.  Look under the comp.os groups and alt.hackers,
and alt.folklore.computers, all of which tend to be interesting (also
high traffic).  comp.dcom.telecom has good telephony too if you are more
into that.

Never actually used a VIC-20, and the first experience that I had with an
Apple II series machine was at college - believe or not, they still use them
in some places.  Admittedly, very specific software that they run....

Hmm, it's a toss up, I guess I would say that I first started using a
Sinclair Spectrum when it came to computers.  Roughly at the same time I was
using a Kaypro 4 with CP/M (that was the real power machine!) and also
occasionally an Osborne 1 (love that screen!).  From there, downgraded for a
while to a BBC Microcomputer...  Oh joy!

Finally got my hands on a PC compatible, and then kept working up from
there....

   I started out on an Apple IIe when they first came out.  Pretty much 
because my uncle had had a Apple II+ for awhile and our neighbors had one 
of those Bell & Howell Black Apple II+'s.  And my mom paid $200 less for 
the Apple IIe than she did for this 486DX2-50 setup.  How times change.

Subject: gfiles area changes
Date: Tue Apr 20 10:39:32 1993

Lots of stuff in the gfiles got moved around, and I added the two latest
issues of CuD and the latest issue of EFFector Online, plus all of the
stuff that people had put in the incoming directory (TAP and Phantasy
15).  

The most noticable changes are that I made a fiction directory (upload
any poetry or short stories that you might have) and make a
journals/oneissue directory, for magazines that I only have one issue of.

Also, I don't have a date on the TAP-1 issue.  Looks recent, because they
have a list of WWIVnet boards and a lot of them are 9600 and 19200, but a
date would be nice.

Finally, if you want anything to go into the gfiles or ftp area upload it
to /incoming by anonymous ftp or mail it to htoaster+@cmu.edu.  If you
ftp it leave a small file saying what it is or send mail to me here
(htoaster) or to htoaster+@cmu.edu.

I am hoping that next semester I will have more drive space, in which
case the gfiles area will be much larger (probably including most of
ftp.eff.org, and hopefully a good bit of it indexed).

No, because you can't read files that are in the /incoming directory,
just put them there.  I would like to offer a service like the above, but
don't have the space or time to make sure that everything is legal.  You
can use the /tmp directory on ftp.eff.org for what you want though.

If the internet wasn't in its current state (tones of warez doods trying
to find sites to abuse for the purposes of uploading games) I wouldn't
need to worry about this.  But it is overly messed up and I do.

What do you think of it?  How have they changed the basic structure of it?
I just made a mirror site for it on uglymouse.css.itd.umich.edu but I
haven't had a chance to play with it yet (I've experimented with Linux for
the last couple weeks, which is a lot more polished than 386bsd in terms of
installation and configuration of useful packages like gcc and TeX and news
but lacks the real BSD development environment).

I never got around to using the PETs.  My first was a C=64 over 6 years 
ago.  In fact, I still use it, (or should I say them), on a regular basis. 
I did break down and buy an IBM a few months ago, though, 'cuz I needed a 
lot more power than the 64 could give me...Ahhh, what fond memories I have 
of the 'ol 64.  The days where you could call AT&T and sequentually dial 
numbers from your home...heheI guess you could call me a 64 junkie.  All 
the local 64 boards went down long ago and I bought all their equipment 
for real cheap.  Now I have so much stuff I don't know what it all is!

All 64 buffs:  I am setting up a 64 BBS complete with cursor controlled 
menus and many nifty tricks with C/G.  Also, worldwide networking via 
NISSA Net for Image BBS, (ok, worldwide is a crock...they have some node 
in Australia so they can call it "worldwide"...BLECH).  I have just about 
everything on ftp.eff.org as well.  I will post the number after BETA 
testing going on now...Long live the 64!

I get asked by people all the time if I know of anyone selling a cheap 
modem.  Unfortunately, the used modem marked in this area is pretty dry.  
The best advice I could give your friend is to look in the paper.  Every 
once in a while someone will sell their 64 + equipment and may be willing 
to part with just a modem...However, they usually want to get rid of 
everything as a package.

New or referbished modem prices are dropping and if your friend has some 
spare money laying around (heh...yeah) they might want to shell out the 
$30 for a 1200 or $80 for a 2400.  I actually have people calling in with 
old 300 monsters who would be satisified with a 1200, but no one seems to 
be selling...I'm afraid all I have left is a couple of 300 bauders which 
are better than nothing, I guess.  I gave away my last 1200 almost a year 
ago...

Different areas may have more modems laying around, but here in the 313 
area, things are looking pretty bleak.  If you do find some modems, my 
users and I would really appreciate it if you could pass the info. along!

The unzip project has made some pretty clean code and you should be able to
easily compile it on the machine where you have an account already.  Drop me
a line if you need help; I made it easily under SunOS 4.1.x, 3.5, Ultrix
4.2, NeXT 2.1 and 3.0, 386BSD and Linux.  Can't get much easier than that. 
Be aware that gunzip will unzip files compressed with zip (up to 1.9x of the
PKZip format) but only if they have a *single* item in the archive.  In
otherwords, GNU zip is a good replacement for Unix compress, but not a good
replacement for a real zip utility for manipulating DOS archives.ÿ

make sure that you read the news that comes up when yabbs starts.  
Basicically I'm running my beta server/client software which is going to 
be very buggy, so live with crashes...

sorry about any inconvience, but I wanted to start testing it...

also, right now the only editor supported is the internal one (I need to 
recompile joe...vi should be available soon by logging in as bbsvi instead 
of bbs).

sorry, lots more bugs that I just caught...hopefully we should be
pretty stable for the next few days.  right now the server isn't 
multithreaded (I have the code written, but I want to debug it as
a single proc for now), so things might be a bit pokey with more than

my summer was just work....  i'm still working...  i'm doing a 
co-op with IBM here in San Jose.  i work with the Workstation Support
group.  we provide OS/2 upgrades for the lab.. as well as memory and
other misc. work.

by the way....  i do not recommend using OS/2 unless you have tons of
memory.  we run it on PS/2 model 80s with 16meg and its still slow. 
granted, mod80s are 386 machines....  to really run it effectively
use a 486 with 16+ meg.

16 megs?  I have a 486/33 with 8 megs, and it runs fairly fine.  I have 
about six things running right now (AVI player, WP 5.2 for Win, this comm 
thing, a couple games, etc.) and I don't really notice a slowdown, though 
I occasionally get a lot of disk swapping.  16 megs would be nice, I 
guess.

you can also run os/2 without graphics and free up some memory...

Well... your PS/2 80 are probably shit because i do have a 486DX-33 with 
8megs of 70ns ram and the 2.1 version of os/2 is a lot faster then the

For what software you find it slow ?

yeah....  our Mod80s suck shit.....

i have seen it run on other platforms and it does perform much better.
the IPL time for a Mod80-111 (20mhz 386) with 16meg running OS/2 is about
7 minutes (apporximate... just a guess)    we have found a new upgrade
for the machines.. $2000 for a 486 motherboard which is made by IBM and
sold thru Reply.  100% MCA compatible.  rediculus price...  but its
cheaper than buying a mod 95 and buying a clone is sacrilage (cha!!)

i'm not all that impressed with MCA either... but who am i to say...

back to the OS/2 though....  its still better than messywindows..  i
just installed windows on my pc... i hate it...  but i love
command line interfaces though... :)  but i may replace
it with OS/2.....

I have no idea.  You can get it from agate.berkeley.edu in 
/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-0.9, which should also have a INSTALL_NOTES file which will

you code demos in assembly?  there was one thing I was thinking of, purely 
hypothetical..

let's assume you're coding for a stereo sound card.. well, how about send 
the sound through the left audio channel, and VIDEO through the right 
audio channel?  would taht be possible..?  couldn't you figure out how to 
send a sync signal in audio that the video could interpret?  if you could 
figure that out, you'd have full control over the screen..

anyway EE's on here who could explain this better?

That wouldn't be possible.  Video signals (such as TV) run at a much 
higher frequency then sound signals do.  For instance, a sound signal 
would be on the order of 44.1kHz (that is CD quality, and is the high end 
for most cards like sound blasters).  Video on the other hand is more like 
11 mHz for NTSC quality display, which is way over the top of the range 
for those sound outputs.

Oh. When I was still young, ALL "real" demo code was done in assembly and 
most "real" code still is.  In demos you're supposed to squeeze that one 
little ounce
of juice out of the hardware better than all the rest. On a 486/VLB
everybody can do a little gus player and a simple scroller in (even)
viusal c++ , but then what`s the pooint in that.  I suggest
you start messing around w/ your asembler, after all demo coding is about
polising those small routines so they'll shine in a nuclear accident. 

..just my thoughts , sorry about the messy edit, but this lag is deadly.

If the dot pitch is .28cm (I believe standard on IBMs), the moniter would

actually, it probably isn't as high of resolution, but it probably has 
other stuff.  For instance, there is probably a z-buffer, which would be 
16-bits, and holds information for computing a z axis in for doing hidden 
surface removal.  there is also probably an alpha channel, which would be 
used for saying how transparent an object is with respect to other things. 
that is another 8-bits.  Plus you get double buffering, so animation is 
better.  All that uses up the memory in a hurry (48 bits per pixel per 
buffer, or 96 bits per pixel total).

Also, for the most part larger monitors can't achieve a .28 dot pitch.  
Most 20" monitors are .31, and larger monitors (like 35 inches) are even 
worse.

Well, the article doesn't say what resolution it can drive (I would guess 
something like 1600x1200 with too many colors, plus transparency, etc.), 
but it does say that it can do a "5x5 convolution of a 1024x1024 pixel 
image" in less than 66ms.  The engine has 320 Image Engines that operate 
in parallel to render everything.  Each one controls 512Kb of the image (I 
guess it can go up to a meg per engine).  Anyway, it seems kinda neat.  A 
super computer (1.2 GFLOPS) on your video card.

the bsd mail program really isn't that bad if you learn how to use it.  You
can tell it to run an external editor instead of the builtin using the command
~v, which will run whatever your EDITOR is set to (or vi, which is the

Ah, pine is fairly powerful.  It's got a little login thing, you can set 
up all kinds of mailboxes and stuff.  You can also set up an address book 
with everyone's names and stuff.  It's got its own format for sending 
files, called metamail (which elm doesn't handle).  I wish I could tell

You can change the order they are listed in on the options menu.  Or, is 
elm set up by default to run in beginner mode?  If it is, then you might 
not have seen the (o)ptions menu, since it's not listed with the begnner 
commands.  From the elm menu, type o, then you'll get to configure it some 
more.  Sorry if you already know this, but I didn't for a while...

elm is a lot better than it seems at first...also, along with setting yer 
options, load up the file .elmrc (should be in $HOME/.elm) and see what 
options u can declare there...its easy to change the order the messages 
are displayed...

Look guys...don't use this system to trade accounts.  That isn't what it is
here for.  Talk generally, not specifically.  I have too much riding on stuff
for you to mess up the system with crap like that.

There were at least 4 messages in the private email with account/passwords in

not to nitpick (or gee, this does sound like a nitpick ;) but ~v
is for the VISUAL variable.  ~e is for EDITOR.  ~e will default to
"ed" unless you setenv to something else.  The point is that you can
just use those two flags to define *any* two editors you want, even
though ~e used to be for the line editor (ie, you could make ~e=emacs
and ~v=vi if you were a sick person).

and i do not think they ever will be, root only has something like 600k of 
hard drive space left to use, /var has under 2megs and the /usr mount only 
has 10megs or so and it is all needed for the users.  we really need a new

I have made the talk section multi channel.  This means that you can go and
have a private conversation with a few people that others can't see (unless
the join the channel).  You can also make channels hidden (so that when you
type /w it will the channel as "*private*" instead of showing the channel name,
so unwanted people can't join the channel).  If anyone notices any problems
with this please let me know.

I have updated the help in chat to reflect this and have added a channel name
to the w)ho command (instead of saying in chat or not in chat it now lists the
name of the channel you are in).

For now the system is online.  I might take it down at some point depending
on how my workload is (I really can't afford to be spending time maintaining
or worrying about yabbs right now).

Otherwise, sorry about killing all of the accounts, but I made some changes
that required it (user names are now case insensitive, so htoaster and HTOASTER
would refer to the same account, which should fix some problems people had).

Finally, more changes to yalk.  You can now join multiple channels at the
same time (as many as you want).  Play around with /j (join) /l (leave)
and stuff like that.  If you notice any problems let me know and I'll try
to fix them.

Where in the gfiles does this occur?  There is so much stuff there that it 
could take me weeks to find out where the glitch is.

Deaska,
    You have all right to poke fun at us stupid Americans for the rotten 
state of our health insurance system.  I'd much rather have a socialized 
system like yours.  But this all-too-greedy nation will never wise up and 
guarantee health care to all its citizens.  The doctors, pharmeceutical 
companies, and the insurance companies have a profitable racket here that 
they refuse to give up, so the people suffer.  Ah ... the glories of the 
free market, huh?  Modern capitalism at its pest, huh?  Not a chance.  All 
we've got is another case of the rich screwing the poor.  No surprize that 
it's the poorest 25% of the people in America that don't have insurance.  
The rich do, and (no surprize) they're the ones getting fat off the 
current system.  I wish that I could explain why America is the only 
nation in the industrialized world that doesn't guarantee free access to 
health care to all its citizens.  I wish I could.

    Cheers~!

Well, maybe you should also wonder why all those nations are slowly 
finding their systems going bankrupt (such as Sweden) failing because of 
the constricting beauracracy created (such as England), or finding some 
of its citizens fleeing the taxes of their country, but returning for 
medical care (such as Canada).  Yes, it is true that the "health care 
industry" (doctors, hospitals, pharmaceautical companies) do have high 
bills.  This comes not, as you put it from "the market system at its 
pest"  but from the common fact of high insurance costs.  These come from 
the number and incredible sums awarded from malpractice suits (trust me, 
I'm Pre-Law, not Pre-Med, and what I'm saying is damning my own 
profession).  As for your 25%, this number is fallacious.  23.75% (or so) 
of those are TEMPORARILY without health care coverage.  This can occur for 
several reasons, change of jobs, insurance companies, moving, etc.  which 
leaves approx 2% of Americans without Health care.  it is to these 2% that 
 the government must focus it resources.  This can be done through a 
thorough reorganization of current social programs.

Hmmmmm...
    Now let me see, we, the US is $4.5 trillion dollars in debt, and you 
want to say that other countries are almost bankrupt?  I bet that the 
combined debt of the  countries that you mention (Sweeden, England) is 
less than the debt that we've got.
    You argue that malpractice litigation is driving up the cost of health 
care here.  I agree, but have you looked at malpractice litigation 
statistics for countries with socialized medicine?  It hardly exists, 
because lawyers have a very hard time sueing goverment employees (which 
doctors in a socialized system are).  So I agree with you, if we had 
socialized medicine here we could effectively contain the costs of medical 
malpractice by making it extremely hard for lawyers to bring suits against 
doctors because they would be, in effect, government employees.  You 
defend  my argument quite nicely, thank you.

My wife  spent almost her entire life under the British system of "health

 Operations thet we take for granted (coronary bypass, transplants) have 
to be scheduled because thery are considered "elective."  What kind of 
system is that ?  My wife and I have spent many hours discussing this and 
she seems to think that our system i9s  better than what Great Britain 
has.  Canada has the same problems.  Entire wings are closed because there 
is not enough money in the system to keep them going.

As for people not being able to get health care,  look at a public 
hospital.  By government mandate, if they accept public funds, they must 
treat ANYONE, even those not able to pay.  Granted, our system is not the 
best in the world.  But I do NOT want another govt bureaucracy screwing it 
up even worse than it is.

My, my, temper, temper, Minuteman:
    I can see I've got you a little aggrivated.  Must mean that I made a 
good point when I said that you were defending my position.  And you were. 
 It's a fact, the actual costs of providing health care would GO DOWN in a 
socialized system because it would be tougher to sue doctors for 
malpractice (not impossible, just very hard).  Only the most blatant of 
all malpractice cases would even go to court, so more of our national 
health-care dollar would go directly to health care instead of the legal 
industry.  Of course, taxes would have to go up to pay for it, but the 
cost of private insurance would evaporate.  The question is this:  would 
you rather support the insurance companies, and the lawyers, or would
you prefer your money to be spent almost exclusively on health care?
Call me crazy, but I'd prefer that my money be spent on health
care, rather than on supporting  fat lawyers and insurance adjusters.
    Now, about your statistics.  Who are you kidding?  Only 2% of 
Americans are REALLY without health-care insurance?  This kind of 
statement is very popular these days.  In fact, the Republican National 
Committee has all Republicans right now running around saying, "There is 
no health-care crisis."  Are you one of these?  You sound like George Bush 
in 1992 saying, "There is no recession."  Basically, you just don't get 
it. No doubt, YOU have health-coverage.  Why should you care if a quarter 
of the people in America don't?

You have gotten under my skin.  I can't believe you could fall for some of 
the blatant lies being put out by the democratic national committee.  You 
mention, that by having a governmental system, all the money would go 
towards health care.  There really could be nothing further from the 
truth.  Look at any government agency and you will find expenditures going 
towards various overheads, projects, etc. that a private company would go 
out of business if they tried to operate in the same fashion.  Why?  
Because the system would be POLITICIZED!  It would be the same system 
which gave us the $500 dollar toilet seat procuring pacemakers and 
CATSCANS.  By saying that instead of having your money go to 
pharmaceauticals, doctors, etc. which you claim is part of the problem, 
you want to give this money to Congress???  Honey, you might as well be 
kissing that money goodbye!  BTW have you checked out a VA hospital yet.  
Before you speak anymore on this subject, please take a first-hand look at 
hour our government is faring in the health care profession.  It's a 
disgrace.

To the honourable Mr. Robtelee:
    No doubt health care in Britain has its problems as well.  I'd argue 
that the Tory government of the past sixteen years must shoulder a great 
deal of the blame for why the British system is not working so well. The 
Tories cut taxes (as did we) in the early eighties.  This threw them far 
into debt (as it did us).  The government was then forced to start 
rationing health care services as a result, an unfortunate but unavoidable 
consequence of the mounting public debt.  We here in America have much the 
same problem, and many believe that health-service rationing is coming 
here, soon, regardless of what ends up being national health-care policy.
    Nevertheless, there are far more countries where socialized health 
care works very well (Canada, Australia).  A recent study shows that 
97% of all Canadians reported receiving needed health care within 24 
hours.  Another study asked Canadians if they'd prefer a health-care 
system like the one in the US, and 95% of Canadians said no, they'd prefer 
NOT to have a system like ours.  So while Britain is the popular example 
that pro-status-quo people most often use to defend the current 
health-care nightmare in the US, an objective look at socialized medicine 
across the globe turns up far more examples of successful socialized 
systems.  But even the worst socialized system, Great Britain's, is better 
than no system at all for those who do not have health care coverage. No 
doubt you and Mrs. Robtelee have health insurance, and thus, for you the 
US system works.  For those who don't even the worst bureaucratic 
nightmare will seem like an improvement.

OK, calm down, before this gets too personal:
    First off the Democratic Party isn't advocating a Socialized system.  
What are you talking about?  Second, Republicans stick together like a cow 
pattie.  Democrats, unfortunately, don't have good organizational skills, 
so they're already fighting amongst themselves abut the President's (very 
modest) reforms.  I am in no way echoing the Democratic party.  You are, 
no doubt, a card-carrying Republican, and are saying the exact same thing 
that every other Republican in America is saying today, "There is no 
health care crisis."  That's the lie.  There is a crisis, and the longer 
that we ignore it the worse it's going to get.
    Now, about giving money to the government.  I admit, that any large 
system, like the US Government, is bound to be inefficient to a degree.  
And, there is a great deal of waste in the government, and  no doubt, a 
socialized system would create some bureaucratic lag, if you will.  
However, there's a ton of lag in the current no-system.  The massive 
insurance industries, the lawyers, the judicial nightmare, is the lag that 
the status-quo creates, and a socialized system would, without a doubt, 
strongly constrict this bureaucratic mess.  Need I repeat the irrefutable 
logic?  OK, here goes, once again.  Malpractice litigation would be 
reduced to almost nothing becausedoctors would gain a degree of immunity 
against malpractice lawsuits because they would be, in effect, government 
employees.  Only the most blatant of malpractice cases would ever go to 
court.  This would greatly reduce the cost of health care in the US, 
because the lawyer's cut of the health-care pie would be greatly reduced.
Furthermore, the largest single driver of health-care costs (the insurance 
industry) would be virtually eliminated.  If the government payed for all 
health care, then there would be no need for the hundreds of thousands of 
insurance adjusters that the current system supports.  If you would, 
please, deal with this argument in some rational form so that I don't have 
to repeat it again.
    About the VA hospital, no, I've never been to one, but I can tell you 
that my sister gave birth to two babies in VA hospitals (for free).  She 
chose the free (socialized) care, if you will, over the way-too-expensive 
private care for which she was not insured.  You see, for the poor people, 
for those who don't have good insurance, and can't afford prime medical 
treatment, any socialized system (regardless of how poor) is better than 
no access at all.

My esteemed foe,
   The figures i quoted were from my wife's experience with the British 
system of health care.  The problems with the Canada were quoted in an 
article in Reader's Digest. (please forgive me but i cannot remember the 
date of the article.)  
   Another recent article, from either January or February, in Reader's 
Digest shows how long people have to wait in order to have certain 
surguries performed.  Corobary bypass waiting was about eight weeks !
   I have seen the V.A. hospitals and dealt with them first hand.  They 
are really Death Houses.  The quality of care in those facilities is worse 
than any third world nation.  I am a veteran myself and have given 
instructions to my loved ones to never admit me to a V.A. Hospital.
   I, for one, do not want my health left in the hands of some 
disinterested politician in Washington.  They will "fine-tune" it, and me

Well, what about it, could it be that the National Health Care system in

Lastly, I'd like to pose a question to those of you who are stalwart

Well, while your proposal to just try the system of socialized medicine 
and if it doesn't work scrap it seems reasonable, there are quite a few 
arguments against it.
The biggest one, off the top of my head is by implementing such a system, 
we would be dismantling totally the private system of health care already 
in place.  Then we would have to wait at least a couple of years (probably 
around ten or so) to see how this system works.  Then, if (which I believe 
is almost a certainty) that system fails, the people will have to wait for 
the congress to get around to abolishing it.  (You can time the quickness 
of congressional action with a sundial, but you'd be standing outside an 
awful long time).  Once the system is legislated away, we would have to 
rebuild the private health-care industry from scratch (if you doubt that 
or the severity of this transition, look at other countries that are 
changing from a state controlled system to a free-market system, ie 
Eastern Europe).  Also, no government system ever truly dies, it usually 
finds some hole to hide in and suck taxpayers money.
   You have also mentioned how much more difficult it would be to sue 
doctors, etc under a socialized medicine system.  This is not true.  The 
US government (through whatever agencies involved) are quite frequently 
sued by one group or another, and frequently by individuals as well.  Find 
any legal text and count the occurrences, of John Doe vs. US.
It does happen, and whatever National Health agency is created would find 
itself no different.
    Also, the republicans do not claim that nothing is needed in the 
health care industry.  As a matter of fact several senators  have been 
touring the country promoting their alternative to the Clinton health 
system.  it is pretty good, and if you'd like, I'll E-mail it to you and 
anyone else who might be interested.  Among the senators sponsoring the 
proposal are Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and Paul Coverdell (R-Georgia).  They 
suggest smaller reforms than the President (whose reforms are by no 
stretch of the imagination modest).
    One last comment, if you are still interested, in implementing then 
deciding, wouldn't it be wiser to start with smaller suggestions (ie the 
Gramm, Coverdell, et. al. alternative) and if they don't work then the 
more drastic ()ie. the Clinton/Rockefeller proposals).
                                                respectfully,
                                                  Minuteman[C

yeah, well, if your client hangs the server will still think that you are
logged in.  A better way to quit would be to hit control-D, which will
make the client ask you if you would like to logout...control-C may work
as well...

I t is about a young boy named Holden who lives from place to plce and 
soon realizes getting old is not fun. .he realizes as people get older 
they are not innocent and see to many bad things .Holden wants to prevent 
his younger sister from becoming influenced by the realities of this 
world.so he is the cather in the rye preventing the kids from jumping off 
the cliff into adulthood,in figure of speech ofcourse. I attend suny

Yes I really do want to teach high school. This may sound really corny, 
and I', going out on a limb here, but I really love the subject of 
english. Many hs teachers have a great intrest in their tpoic, but not in 
the people they're teaching it too. I am also a great lover of people, and 
have worked as a camp councelor in the during the summer for the past four 
years where I taught workshops on poetry etc and loved it.I have wanted to 
teach for a very long time. It's really hard to  write WHY you want to do 
something and make it sound convining or even make it make sense, but I 
just know this is what I want to do. It's just one of those things. :)

the best way would be to find a computer literate person at your campus
to help you out.  I'm sorry about the restrictions, but they really are
making a big difference in how loaded down yabbs is.  When you consider that
this machine is just a 486sx/25 (probably less powerful that what many of you
use in your public labs) allowing 20 users on isn't that restrictive.

To get the client you'll need to know what sort of system you are running
on (it has to be a unix based system, but beyond that, who makes it, etc).
You'll also have to know how to use ftp.  Once you know this ftp to 
phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu and look in /pub/yabbs/clients at the file called README.
get the client corresponding to your system, and run it.

If anyone has an internet machine that they are a sysadmin of and would be
willing to let other yabbs users access yabbs through their machine I'd be
glad to help them set it up.  It would be cool to have a machine that people
can bounce off of on the west coast and one in europe somewhere, since this
would speed up percieved reaction time pretty greatly.

I was listening to the radio and some guy had the theory that old women

 Can't recall why off hand, but it seemed a funny idea at the time...

xela, I have heard the same thing.  At least as far as older women dating 
younger men, this coincides with sexual primes.  Women tend to 'peak' in 
their 30s and forties, men in their early 20s.  As far as the reverse,
I couldn't tell you.

Blind dates SUCK!!!!!!!!
How would u know if you like their personality or their looks????
U dont..............It is better to meet in a college.....social
 event......or even a dance club (depends). and on a blind date how about 
the money u spend on the girl??? an average date may cost (in my 
expeirence) around $50. thats at least $20 for two at a semi-decent
 restaurant. say $15 for two movie tickets (and if she wants soda and 
popcorn lets add $5......and of course u share!!!!!!). thats $40 already.
Now, at the begining of the date, the roses......I believe that a dozen 
roses on the first dat is TOO MANY!!!!!!! Buy 3 roses (whatever color...if 
u know her fav color than get that!!!!) and surround those flowers with 
babybreath wrapped in green paper. that will cost around $10. so the total 
amount on that blind date.....in which you dont even KNOW HER....u can 
spend at least $50........IT IS BETTER TO MEET THE PERSON FIRST!!!!

I agree with you.  But who has a blind date has to be so elaborate?  For 
one blind date I went to a baseball game, minor league, of course, and the 
total tab there (tix, drinks, pizza, even) came to 15 bucks.  Then we went 
to the park for a walk (note that this was free of charge), and the only 
other fee was driving her around, maybe a buck all told.  a $16 date.!

cleaning my car, pick a restaurant with only the best atmopsphere.  Nice 
music, if any, spacious, temperate, and congenial hospitality.  If the 
restaurant makes her happy, it's that much easier for me to.

It seems to me that the amount of money spent on a date has absolutely no 
bearing on the outcome.  I think jujubee said quality, not quantity.  
AMEN!  These are the 90's and I think it's actually more appealing to be 
frugal.  Not cheap, but frugal.  Or, having the best time and the most fun 
with the least expense.  It requires a lot more imagination and a lot more 
care into the evening's plan than your typical 
dinner/movie/flowers/chocolate date.
...and why does it seem that every gal on this bbs hasn't had a good date 
in so long?  Sheesh, how depressing.  Is your nightly use of yabbs a 
consequence or a cause for this status?
...Destiny, my idea of the perfect date is the one that never ends.  Not 
poetically, but quite literally.  For the perfect date implies a perfect 
match, a perfect relationship, and a perfect life together.  (and yes, I 
am an idealist)

hmmm *knowing smile*... I wonder too... perhaps the actual moment of 
meeting might or might not be as overwhelming as the build up toward the 
meeting. I guess who two ppl might react really depends upon just how much 
they interacted beforehand, what they discussed, their emotions expressed, 
their feelings about certain things...  

(oops, 3rd line, who = how :)


it would also depend on the amount of time the two spent knowing and 
communicating to each other.. before they met in person... also depends on 
whether they are seriously madly deeply in love, or whether it is 
something less...  so many variables... 

the ultimate blind date fer sure... but is it really blind?

so have I...
Especially considering the number of "relationships" I see forming on 
these bbs'.  People who share interests, like each other's conversation, 
or whatever clicks between them.  Just think of this as another medium 
through which people can meet.
As for me, I had met the girl first, then when she moved (yes, 1000 miles 
away) we kept up through letters, phone, bbs, etc.  But I admit this is 
much different than your idea of a truly blind date.
Then again, if these people have corresponded, they may have traded 
pictures, and since they have been speaking to one another for an extended 
period of time, it is not truly blind at all.

On a similar train of thought, my friend is big on meeting girls through 
bbs's, and always seems to meet gorgeous women over the e-waves.  Now a 
question for all the gorgeous women: why is it that you choose this type 
of meeting people when you have the looks (and personality to boot) to 
meet tons of people in person?  Now there's a mystery for ya...

it being a blind date, I don't think it is.  I think it would be the least 
blind of any date you would ever go out on in your entire life.  When you 
go out on a first date with a "stranger" you know virtually nothing about 
them, but when you go out on a "first date" with someone you have no for a 
long period of time, yet never "met", you already know your compatability, 
your likes, dislikes, etc.  It is merely an extension and addition to the 
initial experience...being in person that is.  And if for some reason, 
things don't work out...you have to wonder, maybe you weren't compatible 
in the first place...  Gotta run to lab, sorry  can't finish my thoughts

I can't say I can answer that question, Cat, butit's the same question as

wall?"
The two conditions can't always be met.
But if I were doing the experiment, I'd be rooting for the bread. :)

now here's food for thought:  whaat if you buttered both sided of a piece 
of bread and placed it between two cats tied back-to-back?
I know, it's one of those mysteries plaguing scholars and scientists for

I think that if used margarine that is lighter in fat, cholesteral,

No, Cat, I don't think MewMew's terrorist leanings woulod affect such an

cats are typically fascist themselves.  Take NJDEVIL for example.
NJD, I think the experiment is "dropped from a considerable height," not 
"thrown at a considerable downward velocity onto a hard, conrete surface."
Keeep that in mind when conductin further experiments.

OK OK OK, I only posed that question last week as a kind of a joke (so I

pissed off cats and lose a few fingers if your cats are anything like

conciderable height. And NJ....I'm calling the ASPCA on you. :)

Well, Cat, I for one am all for buttering cats, provided it's done

and spice to taste.  Prepare at 450 degrees for 15-20 or until golden 
brown.  Garnish with strong cocktail sauce to taste, and of course a fine 
imported Rose wine.  Only the best.

hellion, i'm afraid  i'm going  to have to disagree with you on this 
point.  kurt cobain did nothing more (for me  anyhow) than start  the 
commercialization and  bastardization of  the music I love.  A lot of  the 
bands that I like have songs about a lot  of the same  things, but because 
they aren't good looking or trendy or otherwise MTV-friendly, I have a 
devil of a time finding their stuff or info on them.  I think it's 
ridiculous to have to look for nearly a year for an album that is still in 
print.   And  although I detest MTV,  I kinda wish my favorites would get 
on there once  in a while so everyone else would see how great they are.  
But Kurt Cobain ruined that.  Now you have  to be some sort of tortured 
soul  to get on there...and  while being  a tortured soul can be fun, not 
everyone is  unhappy. (of course, this is just what I see)  And while I 
agree with what kurt cobain was trying to say with his music, that doesn't 
mean I have to venerate his death.  He was *no* John Lennon.  John Lennon 
was someone everyone lost when he was murdered, only people who liked 
nirvana lost kurt cobain.  (spokesman of our generation? bah!)

Anyhow....that's just what *I* think.  Feel free to disagree...

The hockey playoffs started tonight with the Bruins beating the Canadians
Do any of you appreciate hockey as much as I do? Please tell me who
you think will win the Cup. I personally like the New York Rangers
but we haven't had a cup in 50 years. Do you think the Rangers can do it?
or are they destined to fail. Tell me your thoughts and your
picks! Serious fans only!

enjoy Fiesta you know. If anyone wonders what that is I will explain some

miss my yabbs family.  Oh and whoever's address I have will hopefully 
have real letters in the mail to them by Mon. *crossed fingers*  I hope I

    I am saying goodby.  I am not sure when I will be back on, perhaps 
once I feel better, but i didn't want those of you who do care to worry 
about me.  I just wish this was something I could take in stride but I

Beverly, alomar, whoever you are...

lemme just say that you obviously have the wrong person here.  I've known 
only one Beverly, and she was my Congressperson.  And as far as kitten 
kicking, I've never done it.  I've never kicked one in my life.  I've 
thrown a few around from time to time, but no foot-works.

I hope you can find some sedative to prevent you from going off on 
complete strangers in the future.  I'm just a nice guy who is here for fun 
in yabbs, not to be subject to such cruelty.

Sorry that I had to say this in front of all of my yabbing friends, but it 
needed to be said after alomar's note.

Perhaps i agree with you.i don't know. i have alot of criticism of
society--doesn't everyone--but i've never really lashed out against it
with substantial action. Maybe it's time to starting fucking society.

Hello, raist.  I think we're all falling victim to that end of the year 
crunch. This is ,my first full semester as a yabber, and I can say that 
grades have suffered, but, like Deaska said, it's a principle thing, and I 
still keep yabbs top priority (I say that as I have a paper due tomorrow - 
maybe I should start it now...nahhhh)
Well, keep crankin out that care-free attitude, fellow yabbers, summer's 
on its way and I have a lot to accomplish.

about a year and a half ago i asked for a new name for the system (figuring 
that maybe the bbs and the software should have different names), and social
misfits was suggested.  i then decided to make the software and bbs have the
same name, so i made social misfits the name of this message base (i think
social misfits was the most suggested name).  

before this base was called social chatter...

Since there has been a tad of controversy over the reason for calling this
place "social misfits" i will rehash the discussion i had with another
user--i think it was either natalie or cat--on the same question.
Basically, we decided that we were really social misfits--relative
to this base at least. You see, what you expect here is a bunch of people
talking about hacking, drugs, lewd sex acts, and violence. However, we're
pretty normal, so we don't fit in on this message base. Ergo, we are truly
social misfits here. 
i hop ethat clears things up.

'Twen't me. I know  why the base was called that. :) Everyone on this 
base is some sort of social misfit. It all depends on your definition of 
"social". No one ever "fits" in anywhere anyway, at least not perfectly. 
that's what makes society so interesting...but now I'm getting 
existential..ah well. :)

Really? Hmmmm. I never expect to see that in the message bases as much as 
I would on the channels. :)
 
>However, we're pretty normal
*grin* Are we now? I don't think we are at all, not all of us anyway.

i'm sure things will pick back up as people notice that the system is back
up.  we had some trouble getting everything working (ducky did a lot of work
getting the system back online), and thus it was down for over a week.  also,
realize that its summer so lots of people probably don't have access to 
the internet or may just not be as interested in spending time on it...

I have decided that i want to be a sorceress. i was thinking and i 
believe the problem today is that no one believes in imaginary things 
anymore (except for believeing in the government of course :) )
i've always wanted to have powers to be able to do cool stuff with. i'm 
quite sure that i have magical powers, i just haven't been able to figure 
out how to use them yet...same as everyone else. if i had lived in the 
middle ages and said i was a witch or a magician, people would believe me 
(sure i might get burned at the stake, but they'd believe me :) )
if i said that today, most people would laugh people that said they had 
visions and paranorman encounters/conversations etc used to be called 
prophets..now they're called crazy.
i wonder what my parents would say if i told them i had powers...they'd 
probably drag me to church and have me exorcized or something...maybe 
THAT'S what i'll do if things get too slow around here...draw a few 
pentagrams in black on my bright blue house, leave a few crystal balls 
around the house, sacrifice my sister in a druistic ritual, just to see 
what would happen...vermont is such a droll little state. :)

wishfully thinking,

tammie

a thor's hammer is just a little replica of mjollnir that you wear about 
your neck...kinda like a cross...actually, some of the ones made as 
christianity were kinda reversible so it could be either a thor's hammer 
or a cross...

i don't wear too much black anymore, i tend to stick to dark green or grey 
these days...

kissing the dept. chair's ass (not to mention president ass), etc etc.  
and then there's the pressure to get published, so the university can 
boast that they have so & so teaching there....so a lot of times you end 
up w/ grad students teaching lower level courses, and mucking about...or 
you get professors who can'tgive all their time to teaching cause they 
have to do 'x' many functions or write 'x' many papers or....the list goes 
on and on....so *I* feel like i'm not getting the education i'm paying 
for...and even tho i'm going to a relatively cheap school ($4000/yr 
tuition) i think i should get more of the profs time and energy...

is this clear to anyone other than myself?

i agree with you completely. i think half the professors at uvm are too 
busy writing books to be bothered with menial things like teaching the 
students that are paying their salary in thousands of dollars. i can't 
afford to go to college and not learn anything. when i have a question or 
need help in a class i hate professors that act like they can't be 
bothered with their students because they have "more important things to do".

and don't even get me started on grad students teaching classes :)

Well, this is a VR program where you can make stuff sorta.  I mean you can 
make stuff, but it's not REALLY VR, it's for MS-DOS and it's called 
Domark's Virtual Reality Studio [or Virtual Studio]  Put out by the Domark 
company.  I picked up my copy at Target in the clearance bin for about 15 
bucks.  Works nicely.  Of course I would REALLY like to make a border for 
my program, but..  I need a program that will save in an IFF format, with 
an .LBM extention.  Got any ideas?

i dunno...i guess i was just lucky...i didn't have but a couple of 
associate instructors...usually for an occasional science class, or 
usually for a writing class....needless to say...my Shakespeare survey 
course had a wonderful professor w/his bevy of associate instructors 
following closely at his coattails....try reciting the first 35 lines of 
the Hamlet soliloquy (i admit, i double-checked the spelling on that one!) 
to the most intimidating, yet mesmerizing professor of all time!  that's 
when you are extremely pleased that there are little associate instructors 
in the midst....

anyhow, as i was saying, i guess i was lucky that i had VERY FEW associate 
instructors to boggle my fledgling mind....not to mention when i'd go to 
my professor's offices, they always had time for me...generally had time 
to discuss things in an intelligent and respectful manner, too....

as yet undetermined point in time, anybody from Yabbs that wants to is 
invited to come to Pittsburgh, the birthplace of Yabbs, where we will all 
get together for a weekend or so of fun :> The reason the time is still 
undetermined is because we need everyone who wants to come to let us know 
when would be a good time for them... Email me with questions, comments, 
suggestions, and what time would be good for you at: death@cyberspace.org

I think the best time to have it would probably be in the fall (just because
most of us pittsburgh dwellers aren't even in pittsburgh right now).  As
for housing, I'm sure that once there was some idea of how many people owuld

okay, i'd thought about this last year ... never got around to doing much
more than thinking ... if you want any help death let me know.

my ideas were:  (for those of you who don't know the locations, don't worry
too much about it)

BBQ in schenly park 
Trip to kennywood (costs a lot more tho)
Spring Carnival at CMU ('cept i'd be a bit busy :(

i think the bbq could work pretty well 

anyway, if this keeps rolling, i'll post the infomation CMU gives people about
where to stay in PGH.  also if you're in a fraternity or sorrority, you 
might be able to get a spot in one of the houses on campus (i don't know if
they still those sort of things, but what the hell).

Maybe I'll leave my home address in my plan file so I don't miss

For a picnic in Schenley park, you don't REALLY need a permit... Only if 
there's more than 50 ppl or something (I forget the exact
 number...) pretty much what I was thinking of though when I thought up 
the idea.  So... here's what's been figured out (generally) so far... 
Because Pittsburgh is pretty much in the middle of everyone (and it's also 
the birthplace of Yabbs) it's probably the bestt place to have it... There 
has been a very favorable response to having it on a long weekend sometime 
in the fall, so that's probably when it will happen... Dmonger's picnic in
the park idea sounds good to me, and apparantly to most other ppl, so I'll 
go about finding a place to have it and get the needed legal BS... 
Any contributions for food, games, etc... would be appriceated, but I 
don't think they need to be mandatory. Housing will be figured out once we 
get a general idea of how many ppl are going to come, so until then we'll 
have to wait and see.  (I'm going to kill GPF for paging me 30,000 times 
with "BjorkBot" while I was writing this... :> )

I would like to see this take place in October....maybe September...I 
start school at my new college on August 26th.....and I basically can come 
any time since Pittsburgh is only about two-three hrs from me.....

Anyone needing a lift there should contact me via yabbs email or through

Preference for asm of whatever computer is just a personal thing.  I personally
think that MIPS (Rxx00) processors are the best asm I've dealt with (x86,
68x00, HP PA, MIPS).

Its a pretty silly argument though, like arguing if C or C++ or Pascal is
better.  They all of their highlights..

"Its a pretty silly argument though, like arguing if C or C++ or Pascal is

Indeed. I prefer x86 asm because that's all I've got right now, and that's 
where the bulk of my experience lies. Similarly, I like Pascal because it 
matches my programming style right now. Not to say any one is superior to 
any other.

Badger01:

I commend you on your utmost honesty.  It is not politically correct in 
this day and age to do something that mankind has been enjoying
for thousands of years;  a good, honest piece of meat to sit down to at 
dinner after a tough day.  There are those who want to take this inherent 
"Meat Right" away from decent folk.  They claim that harvesting non-human 
animals is a barbaric remnant of a neanderthalic past.  To them it is 
considered not just murder, but specieism (the active discrimination of 
the harvesting of one specie of non-human animal over the harvesting of 
another specie).  So we are essentially bigot carnivores.  The heroes of 
this movement include on Paul McCartney of Beatles and Wings fame.  He 
once said, "I don't understaaaand why we continue to eat meat everyone 
dtoday works at computers, they don't have to hunt their food."  With cold 
forged logic such as this, how can anyone eat a hamburger?

I could go into a two paragraph description of the radical leanings of 
PETA (the things they don't put onto their membership and donation drive 
materials), but I will hold back until a more appropriate time.

eating meat or meat products like cheese or milk. I don't really

to produce beef far outweigh those to grow crops. Think about it: you get 
maybe 25 cows in a huge field that could be used for wheat or corn. 
Agriculture is much more efficient. In the next few decades, when food 
starts to run out BIG time, I thinnk we'll see a large shift to 
vegetarianism (Of course not in the US, cause we'll never run out of food)

see a big shift to vegetarianism?  there has already been a huge one in
the last few years (and its becoming more accepted to).  outside of the US
most third world countries are primarily vegetarian anyway, and most 
industrialized nations are just like us, its hard to convince them to change...

not that i blame them...i've had vegetables cooked the english way (ie, to
death)...they suck :)...(no offense, i'm plenty of english cook vegetables
well)...

I eat meat...not just beef.
In fact, I'll eat anything from snake to pig to rat,
as long as it isn't diseased, even insects...although they taste bad.
Beef isn't a good meat...it's been bred to be indolent and soft, and so 
doesn't convey the same satisfaction or taste. 
People have to learn to like gamier(NOT gamey, but wilder) meats,
and that might happen.

okay i can see i started something and i thought that maybe since we ARE 
all adults here or at least should diplay some semblance of maturity  i 
would explain that not all vegitarians are vegitarians because of the 
killing of animals (ethical or not?) or because of the health benefits or 
more widely recognized reasons for the lifestyle.
    I for one am studying to be a chef and i do not refuse to prepare 
dishes including meats and other animal bi-products.  I am a  heavy  
smoker as well so it could not possibly be for the first two reasons i 
stated ... the reason that i do not eat meat is because i do not like the 
way it tastes..no i'm not a rabbit-like salad eater ( no offense to those 
that like salad) i am a vegitarian who happens to eat junk-food non-stop

Lately here on yabbs i have noticed a definite shift in the additude of my 
fellow Yabbsers and frankly i find it quite unsettling....IMHO i agree 
with HT and think that, as previously stated, we should be a ble to 
conduct ourselves as adults and treat each other with a little common 
courtesy.  Just because we cannot see each other as we "speak" does not 
mean that the words used in this forum of communication do not touch the 
person they are being directed towards....Frankly i was hurt when i was 
referred to as an anti-meater...

Indeed. The water it takes to produce an 8 oz. hamburger is enough to 
provide for a family of four in a third world country for 2 days. 
(To be fair, beef is the most water intensive foodstuff, but almonds come 
in second (no, I don't eat almonds either)).

That's the main reason I'm a vegitarian. It's a responsible way to live, 
and it can be much healthier as well (tho it's very possible to eat just 
as poorly or worse as a vegitarian).

Well, in truth, industrialized nations shouldn't be focused as primarily 
carnivorous.  Consider Europe, where a hamburger costs a fair bit, as much 
as four times the American price.  It is more appropriate to look at 
eating *habits* over a long period of time when looking at the meat/vegan 
debate; government subsidies here play a large role in the relative 
inexpensive price of beef.  

Like my old pal Denis Leary sez: "This country was founded on meat (and

I don't personally feel that it is my mission as a vegetarian to convert
people (and know a ton of veggies this way too).  I guess my opinion is
that anyone who looks at the facts long enough will be too disgusted to 
eat meat (chicken and beef anyway)...

One thing that someone said back there was theat meat eating is natural.  This
really isn't true, we don't have the enzymes to break down meat in our stomachs
(which is why you have to cook meat), can't fight off the bacteria that
lives in meat (another reasons to cook it), and don't really have the teeth
for it (two cannines and a bunch of molars).  As far as I know the only meat
that our clostest relatives (the primates) eat are dead bugs and maybe small 
rodents.  They mostly subside on vegetable matter.

As far as the meat's concerned, the actual TYPE of meat is important 
too...for instance, some vegitarians eat fish, but they don't consider 
that meat.  While fish is healthier, and easier to produce, it's still a 
living thing..(though nobody wants to save the  "cute, cuddily fishies"

Being a farm boy, Badger01 here has certainly killed his own meat, and it

Relax, I'm not going soft. It's just that too many people today think that 
all meat, from Pork to beef, comes from the store pre-wrapped and ready to 
go. If they actually got in there and got bloody, they'd be better off. 
Besides, today's methods of raising cattle makes them weaker.

Less desireable to eat, in my opinion...that's why I eat less beef and 
more chicken and pork...less degradation. I didn't say NONE, just less. I 
also eatr what I hunt, and only hunt what I eat...I'm not one of those

the idea might have been to make a cereal that would taste like a grape if a

something you'd want for breakfast).

and chocolate fudge pop-tarts are the very very best of all the many varietys

yah, i've actually been to whole foods market (the one in austin at least).
i really need to try and find a good health food store around here.  i'm sure
there is one because the whole area is pretty eco-aware (more so than
pittsburgh or philly at least), but it just means finding one that i can bike 
to.

i did find one company that has it for about half of the price of just about
everyone else at the supermarket, but it goes a little overboard on the 
oats and not enough other stuff...

the microorganisms that my body kills every time i inhale is predominantly 
a means of defense against infection, although many microbes that we 
ingest or inhale are capable of living symbiotically in and on our body,
e.g. the millions of bacteria in your gut: you give them a place to live 
and nutrients from your diet whilst they help digest your food and 
colonise your gut to prevent other infectious bacteria growing to the 
level of an infectious dose through competition.
i do realise what i kill, but i also realise what i provide for. it is 
difficult to justify killing in the sense that you mention except only for 
my survival, this is by no means suggesting that i am more important than 
some other lifeform, but illustrates how organisms evolve to become part 
of an enviroment through a life/death struggle for survival.
i'm not sure how innocent bacteria are or if we can use our values to pass 
judgement concerning their nature.
my brotherhood is not a romantic vision, but a reality which i am glad to 
be a part of, for now i have 9 brothers who i train with, go out with, and 
who can help me if i am in trouble. brotherhood goes beyond friendship.
the ceremony was performed at a temple in front of our ancestors as a part 
of traditional chinese culture and as a mark of respect, not worship.
the brothers are for the brothers, not for the ancestors to who we pay our 
respect.
the brotherhood description given here is very sparse, but highlights some 
of the important principles to which we (i.e. the brothers) abide. it 
is difficult to visualise the situation unless closely associated with the 
culture (which i am still learning about).

anything at all about the damn case?

Hey Dee, 
    I know your comments to Bart weren't directed at me, but I had to let 
you know that I agree with you entirely.  I was just as pissed off as you 
were to see that everyone has made it their agenda to try this case in 
public.  
    One more thing, however.  This is the United States of America and in 
our system of justice (I admit it may be flawed but it is the best system 
in theworld by far) an individual is innocent until proven guilty in a 
court of law and not in the media circus.  My point is that no matter what 
the result of O.J. Simpson's impending trial is, he ahs already been 
judged by the American people which goes against our very belief system 
upon which our country is founded.  
    So basically what I'm saying is this...let the court's decide and get 
O.J. Simpson out of my face!!!!!  I'm sick of him.

So if you want to treat eyed-animals the way you want to be treated, would 
you say ok to this scenario?  A cow walks into the house where a mother is 
breast-feeding her new-born.  The cow throws the human baby off, and 
because the cow is thirsty, he helps himself to some human milk while the 
baby is screaming in hunger.

The metaphor is extreme, and a little weird, but I think it makes a point.

Yeah, I know eating dairy products doesn't make a whole lot of sense from
many views of vegetarianism (including some of mine, which seem to change
all the time).  i never pretended to make sense though :)...

anyway, there are a few reasons why i still eat animal products, but not
animals.  the first reason is health.  it is very healthy to eat a vegetarian
diet, but eating a completely vegan diet that is healthy is a lot more work.
You have to worry about getting vitamins that only come from animal sources
(like many of the B vitamins)...  another is that i am lazy.  there are a lot
of foods that i really love that are dairy based, such as ice cream.  there
are vegan replacements for ice cream, but they are very expensive on a 
student budget.  its also a lot of work to make sure that everything in your 
body has no history of ever being in a previous animals body.

i personally see no good reasons why i shouldn't be a vegetarian (i don't
like meat, and besides liking meat there is no good reason to eat it).  my
vegetarianism is a compromise, i'd never try and lead people to believe other-
wise.  i would like to see myself move to a vegan diet, but that is a
harder move than i want to make at this point in my life...

I agree totally ... lets stop beating a dead horse.

I'm sure it's tender enough by now, soak it in some marinade for a while 
then throw it on the yabbsfest barbeque.   :)  :)  And if you don't want 
any, no-ones forcing you to have any, but if you do, well no-ones stopping 
you either :)

Pity I can;t be there, but shit happens.

Since when is a person defined by whether or not they eat meat or 
vegetables exclusively or not-so-exclusively....? It is like saying that a 
person is defined explicitly by his or her sexuality..or race..or 
gender....I think we all need to learn a little tolerance and look 
holistically at a person rather than by one set of definitions...

Date: Tue Jul 19 09:23:04 1994

First off, I want to announce that, due to an injury I suffered as I left 
campus yesterday, I will no longer be calling myself Badger01, but will 
instead be going by the colorful Sobriquet Scar-eye. They tell me I will 
have a nasty one, and that my sight may not return. Cest' la vie: I still 
have my left eye, the rest of my face is okay, and I'm not dead, so I can 
deal with it. (In the past it would have fucking killed me.)

Anyway, on to a new topic. In my continuing efforts to make myself the 
most hated person on YABBS (From the man who brought up the Meat 
Controversy) I want to ask you guys: What's your take on Abortion Rights? 
I've got a little story to explain why I'm curious.
When I was seventeen, the girl I was going out with at the time, Karen 
(Not her real name) and I were sexually active. After we had been together 
for a while, she told me that she had become pregnant, despite our 
precautions (And I did use contraception, not just leaving it up to her) 
and two days before she told me, she had terminated the pregnancy. We 
continued to see each other for another year and a half, only breaking up 
after my mother's death. But it haunts me. I have always believed , and 
still believe, that a woman does, and should, bear the choice in this 
matter. But at the same time I also beilieve that she aborted what was my 
child. (Fitzgerald always saoid that the test of a first rate mind is it's 
ability to hold two diametrically opposed opinions) I am for choice and 
for allowing women to get access to better and safer medical options...but 
I also wonder if our daughter or son would have looked like me. I wish she 
had discussed it with me. I know that we both are better off now due to 
her decidion (I'm in college, she's working at a bank and attending night 
classes at RI College herself) and that if we had tried to do otherwise, 
we'd probably end up hating each other. I don't even know what I would 
have done. But I wonder.

What do you all think? Is this even an issue a man should be raising? 
(Let's face it...men don't get pregnant. It's easier for them to be 
cavalier about this.)

Sorry to hear about your accident....*hug*

About abortion....I also have the problem of seeing both sides and being 
able to argue effectively for both....however, I do strongly believe that 
abortion is murder....that child did not ask to be conceived...and there 
are so many people waiting to adopt that they are put on waiting lists for 
years....it always did bug me how a woman could easily go and have an 
abortion but then claim she could never carry to term and then give the 
baby up for adoption....I have three words for that kind of 
person...WHAT-EV-ER...seems to me that it would be easier to give the 
child up for adoption to a family who would love it and raise it as their 
own rather than _killing_ it.....

I realise that sometimes abortion is necessary in cases where the child is 
going to be born horribly disfigured and will live in misery during its 
existence...but don't get started on the "what if a woman were raped" 
scenario....(At the risk of getting way too personal...*sigh*.....the 
lengths we go to to share a view...) I was raped, and even though the 
thought of caring that monster's child repulsed me, if I had conceived, I 
would not have had an abortion.

ANYWAY....I think that this issue is something that every woman must make 
her own mind up about. If she can lie with the fact that she terminated a 
L-I-F-E....well, then, so be it...I also want to say that I do not think 
the government has any say in this matter...it is a personal matter, not 
a matter of State.

Well, I sure went on a lot more than I meant to...sorry...geez I can be 
long winded. *grin*

Well, I guess we will see where *THIS* debate gets us!

Hey Scar, 
I generally make it a point not to get involved in politcal/religious
debates and let's face it abortion is as politcal and religious as you
get.  I do have however an opinion and since you asked I'd like to tender it.
Personally, I have reservations about the right of anyone to take
another life (actual or potential, a life is a life).  I, however have
never been pregnant and I will never pretend to know what it is like for a
woman who is pregnant.  As a result I have always said that this is one
law that we should leave out of the laws of man and to the laws of God.  
There is one other law that I thought that abortion should be left
up to.  That is the laws that you govern your own life by.  By that I mean
if a woman can live with the decision to abort a child (her reasons are
her own) then it is not up to me to condemn or praise her for her
decision.  It doesn't change the way that I look at her not does it make
me think any less of her.  I leave her up to her own consience (Sp?) and
her belief system, if she has one.
There is one thing, however that makes your situation unique (at
least to me).  You had no say in the matter. You weren't given an
oportunity to talk about it.  It takes two to make a baby (unless you're
talking artificial ensemination in which case if she had an abortion I
think she has deep problems!) so it should be two involved in the decision
to take that baby's life.  I would think that if I got a woman pregnant
and she had an abortion BEFORE she told me she was pregnant that I
wouldn't be able to stay with her another minute.  She terminated a life
that I helped create without even consulting me!  I would be enraged!
I know that there are sexist women (excuse me, feminists) out
there who will say that it is not a man's place to tell a woman what to do
with her body and that he can't possibly understand what it is like to
have a baby inside you and therefore he has no right to make a personal
comment on the matter!  I disagree.
Women have no idea what it is like to be an expectant father.  I
never was one but I can identify with a lot of my friends who have been. 
It is a team that makes a child and therefore if the death of that child
is determined to be a course of action, then it should be the team that
makes that choice.  I know that there are situations in which it would be
unfair to the child to bring it into the world but I have always believed
that everyone has a right to life.  Now.  I don't push this idea on others
I simply have it.  If my girlfriend gets pregnant I have every intention
of coersing her to not have an abortion and I don't want anyone telling me
that I'm wrong.  I may be wrong for you but it is right for me.  I don't
tell you what to do so don't tell me.
God!  I didn't realize how long-winded I could be!  Well that's
all I have to say. I welcome any comment as long as it doesn't get personal!

okay since i too had a part in the beginning of the whole meat thingy i 
should at least be accomplice to this one too...

fisr of all you have to understand that i come from a very traditional 
"christian" family and although i my sellf am agnostic i still hold alot 
of the beilfs i held as a younger child...this being one of them.

i am a very sexually active female and i have known the whole prgeanacy 
scare thing a few too many times more than i care to recount...but i have 
never actually been so i have been faced with this question alot more 
feasibly than hypotehtically  ( iknow i butuchared that word ..oh well)
and every time that i was faced with the question alone..meaning that the 
male counter-part did not figure in to the picture...i was at a loss as to 
what to do but i knew that wether i kept the baby or adopted it away i 
would have the child and "face the disgrace" because it is a disgrace even 
now in the 90's  the reasoning behind my holcding with this belif is that 
all life is precious and for me to selfishly take the life of another for 
my own  convienience and comfort totally goes against every human part of 
my being
however i do agree that men have absolutely no right in trying to tell a 
woman what to do with her life..on the other hand though i recognize that 
it does "take two"  and  assuming this is an ideal  ( hoxymoron i know but 
oh well) situation bothe "parties" were consenting and involved in the act 
so there for all parties opinions should be taken into account..although 
it is the womans final decision

hmmm... that's wierd, it says you don't exist...
Anyways, I'm sorry to hear about your accident, and I hope that your sight
DOES return. I know what it's like to be without sight in one eye.
As for the subject of abortion, here's my conribution:
I've been raised to believe that Life is sacred and that it should be
protected at all costs. During the last year and a half, however, things
have happened to change that belief. Now, I'm not sure exactly what I
believe. AS for abortion, however, I do have a definite opinion: It should
always be up to the woman (or girl) who is pregnant, although she should
at least listen to the advice of the people around her. This opinion is
the direct result of a personal experience with abortion. While I am a
male, and will never be forced to make the decision myself, I have,
unfortunately, had to help one of my best friends make the decision. To
shorten the story (I HAD typed the whole thing, but before I was finished,
the server kicked me for inactivity) Last April, one of my best friends
was raped. Her parents are devout Roman Catholics, and as such wouldn't
even THINK about abortion if she had gotten pregnant. She herself,
however, couldn't bear to carry the child of the scumbag who had raped
her. I completely agreed with her feeling, after having stayed up the
whole night talking to her. I will never pretend to know what it's like to
be invaded like that, but after that night of holding her, sobbing in my
arms telling me what had happened, I did feel much of the same pain and
her. I completely agreed with her feeling, after having stayed up the
whole night talking to her. I will never pretend to know what it's like to
be invaded like that, but after that night of holding her, sobbing in my
arms telling me what had happened, I did feel much of the same pain and
anger that she did, although most of it was actually her own. She didn't
even want to tell her parents what had happened, lest they despise HER
because of it. Eventually, she agreed that it was better if she did, and
they reacted as parents would, not as she thought they would. They took
her to the doctor, to make sure that she was physically all right.
Luckily, aside from some bad bruises, she was. It was there that the
quesiton came up: What if she was pregnant? At this point, the question
was only a supposition. Sadly, it was a question that had to be answered.
Personally, while I still felt that life is sacred, I also knew, to a
degree, how she felt. Therefore, my opinion was that she should have an
abortion. She herself could not bear to live if she had to bear the child.
Thus, I knew that there can never be ONE answer to hte question. It has to
be answered by each female who faces it, in their own way. Eventually,her
parents saw the emotional pain she was in and gave their consent for her
to have an abortion (parental consent is necesarry for minors in
Pennsylvania). I know now that it was the right choice. While she still
feels guilty about ending the child's life before it even began, she is
far more deeply scarred by the rape itself, and I doubt if she could have
endured the emotional pain of seeing the child born, an ever-present
reminder of what had happened.
Sorry if I rambled on a bit too much, but I didn't realize how much I had
to say.

OK...your not the only one having a problem.   Have you not seen the 
commercial concerning abortion....and the ghost of a child.  Thats 
me...living with the memory of a ghost of a child.  What could have been 
in your mind destroys more than  what would have been. 
     I believe that the decision of having an abortion should be left up 
to the women that are pregnant...not any one else.  The women that choose 
to have an abortion must live with their decisions.  Not you or any one 
else have to live with that decision, just the ones that make the 
decisions.
      I feel that abortion is a private and personal issue.  Women must 
have the rights to make that paersonal decision.  Since, we are the ones 
living with the ghost of a child.....and not anyone else.

Hey, I don't very much like the way a lot of you try and push some of the 
topics under the carpet.. You need to talk about things, people need to 
know other peoples opinions. Its a good thing. If you don't want to hear 
about them, then don't listen. I've quite enjoyed listening to a lot of 
the talk going on here. It makes you think more, and helps you to 
reevaluate your own opinions. You can't just ignore some of these issues.
I like listening to other people.
I don't like people trying to shut others up.
This is aimed at all the people who kept going on and on about changing 
the topics all the time. It has been good, in that it has moved things 
along, and therefore a whole lot more has been discussed as well, but you 
are also limiting the input of more people, because they haven't had the 
chance to have their opinion heard, and everyone deserves that chance.
Hope I've made SOME sense :)

I disagree totally.  Many of the topics that have been discussed on
here have been discussed to death.  It is very easy for rational
argument to disintegrate into name calling and hate mongering on a bbs
like this, and many times it does just that.  Also, it is very, very
hard to actually present truly new ideas or to sway others to your
opinion based entirely on an online discussion.

The other problem is that there are many thousand users on yabbs.  Many
of them have connected once, looked around and left, but there are
still several hundred regular users.  If every single person who had an
opinion on anything expressed it, we would all be spending 24 hours a
day on yabbs just trying to keep up.  After you reach a certain number
of peoples opinions on a topic, many of the following won't ever
present any new ideas.  So perhaps it is time to move on.

If there are issues being discussed on yabbs that you think need
further exploration, find others who agree with you and continue to
discuss it in the email base, normal internet email, or whatever else
suits your fancy.  I think most people while they might have a passing
interest in vegitarianism or abortion or anything else, don't want to
spend weeks talking about it.  And if they do, then they probably need
to find a place to do so with other like-minded individuals.

> I like listening to other people.

So do I, and I think so do we all.  It is interesting to hear the
opinions of other people, some who might be similar to us, and others
who might be of wildly differing background and opinion.  Those people
who I find especially interesting or entertaining or stimulating to
talk to, I follow up on with private conversations.

Everyone does deserve a chance to be heard, but the fact of the matter
is that there are just too many people.  No one is censoring anyone.  I
doubt one could find as many listeners and people willing to speak if
one started discussing these things on a street corner or another
public place.

> Hope I've made SOME sense :)

Yes, quite a bit actually.

Subject: and also. . .
Date: Thu Jul 21 08:34:04 1994

Here are a few more things I thought of during and after composing my
last post that I think need to be said. . .


-- Topi is right when she said that there are many important issues
worth discussing and not "sweeping under the carpet".  However, if
yabbs is your primary (or only) outlet for discussion on them, perhaps
you need to look for some other venues for discussing them.  If you are
on or near a college or university campus, it should be easy to find
people to discuss important topics with.  However, even if you're not,
try just talking with friends or coworkers.  It may not be as easy as
discussing something on yabbs, for many reasons, but I think the
personal interaction is in the long run both more stimulating and
rewarding.


-- This bbs continues to exist only because of the cooperation and
general acceptance of some unwritten code of conduct among its users.
If a group of users, or even just one, are determined enough to behave
antisocially, this bbs would not to continue to exist as a place that
most of the regular users would want to conenct to.


-- Which leads me to this:  Certain message bases have been created for
the discussion of certain topics.  If people aren't willing to try to
put their posts in the appropriate base, then what is the point of
having multiple named bases?  Why not just one big one?  Or just bases
named '1', '2', '3' and so on?  This comment isn't directed at any
specific instance, but at a lot of misdirected postings that have been
happening recently.


-- And finally, as a bit of an old-timer around these parts (I still
remember when yabbs was just an idea in Alex's head, and slightly later
when it was a single user bbs on his 386 under DOS), let me just point
out some of what a couple of bases are intended to be for.  They may
have mutated slightly from the original intention, but that is quite
alright.  This base 'Social Misfits' is just a general chatter and
social board.  It is to some extent a catch-all when no better forum
exists, but if there is something being discussed regularly here, it
will probably get its own base if someone asks Alex really nicely.
Base 'X', 'Anarchy in the US' is intended to be for the discussion of
all forms of politics, not just anarchy.  (Like many, many things in
yabbs, the base name was a bit of a joke.)  This could easily be
expanded to include discussion of various political issues (like the
abortion debate) not just politics and government itself.


blah, enough babble. . .

I kind of answered this already, but what they hey...

Badger is what my mother always called me as a kid, because I'm built like 
one and have the same protective attitude towards my extended family. EX: 
One of my mother's sisters, my Aunt although my family doesn't use that 
title, allowed her son, a year older than me at the time (I was 16) to 
call my mother "A fat, divorced bitch nobody loves" at Christmas eve, and 
only told him that he was wrong, didn't yell at him or punish him. So, at 
New Years (And I don't say this is right to do) I deliberately, while 
playing football with the family, broke his ribs.

Scar-Eye is a new one, self-explanitory.

Aquinas is what my High School english teacher called me, becaus eI argued 
with him about Thomas Aquinas' role in the Chruch (We were both nominal 
Catholics at the time) and it caught on at school. Everybody I went to HS 
with still calls me that, nobody else does.

Bearclaw is after a bear's claw that we found on my property on Prudence 
Island in RI. I wear it on a necklace sometimes.

Wolfen is due to a tatoo I have.

That's all of the ones I know about, anyway.

Okay, here are my base ideas for new message bases.  If anyone is totally 
against them or has better ideas let me know.

f)ood - for discussing anything having to do with food
e)nviroment - for discussing anything having to do with the environment
r)eligous issues - for discussing religions and how they affect people

and adding the word politics to the x)anarchy in the us base title if i can
fit it in.  So it would now be "x)anarchy in the us (politics)", which looks
like it will fit.  having these three bases should keep x from getting
completely wiped out by talks about religion and food and stuff.

I agree.....if someone has something to say about a particular topic...and 
they don't voice their opinion within a week.....well, then....it must not 
have been too important....I wasn't trying to push people into new topics, 
per se.....HOWEVER...I think we were all beating a dead horse there for a 
while....i.e. vegetarianism vs. eating meat....*shrug* I agree with 
ducky...if people want to discuss this more, then take it to a pvt channel 
or into email.....BUT I think new topics should be brought up continuously 
or else people will start getting bored...

Sorry if this offended anyone else (most humble apologies to topi and 
anyone else this may have bothered....)

Ok...if it isn't self-explanatory.....


I LOVE PELE!!!!!!!

Two reasons:Most people know that Pele is the great soccer player, the 
Muhammed Ali of soccer  (see my plan).  I grew up in Jamaica
where all of my friends and I played soccer all day (when not
in school of course!).  Pele was our idol and so when asked
for a name the first person I thought of was Pele.  

The other thing is...and I don't usually admit this...is Pele
is the name of the Hawaiian goddess of fire (or volcanoes,not
sure really).  It's not that I think I'm a godess (I'm a guy!)
It's just that I think the pictures of her (artist's pictures)
are really cool...so...well...there you go.

One more thing. My best friend Zippo and I found nicknames
for each other...his was Fred Flintstone and mine, of course,
was Pele.  He changed his name (I like Zippo better) and I 
kept mine.  That's it.

Bye


-Pele

I thought long and hard about all this ... (ok, so maybe just
for a few mins while I was sitting on the dunny) ... and what
I came up with is this :

- Variety IS good, topics do tend to get a little stale and 
  can result in distasteful name calling and such.

- Hearing other peoples opinions is good.  Many may be the same
  and therefore get a little boring/repetitive, but it's often
  worth wading through what you don't like so that you can
  discover that rare gem of inspiration that someone may post.

- Telling people to move on to a new topic is RUDE !  It's almost
  like saying "I don't want to hear what anyone else has to say"
  or "The last few posts on this topic were really boring and lame"
  (How do you think that makes the person who posted it feel).

If you are fed up with a topic, then just press that [N] key (look
at your keyboard, it can be found just above the [           ] (that's
the space bar :) and between the [B] and the [M]).  If you don't want
to read it, then don't.  Simple.  You may still have to briefly view it
while you flick through to the next post, but surely that's not such a
drama.

Now instead of saying "Hey all, this topic is dead, lets move on to a 
new one", why don't YOU just come up with a new topic.

Yes,I do have one..a 3 year old girl...and take it from me,having

You do NOT do what you feel liked when you feel like doing it.
You are the kind of disgusting revolting bloke who does rude things on the

I agree that it is no big deal, but when I first read Deaska's
comment, although I was not OFFENDED by it, I did get the
feeling (perhaps more subconscious) that it certainly was not
polite.
 
Looking back at it I don't really see too much wrong with it,
but I think the general tone and feeling that could be 
interpreted from the post is not a nice one.
 
"ah geez, steyr, topi" and "who cares" (the who cares seemed to
be in reference to topi's post, sorta like "who cares what you
have to say") CAN give the impression that you are hanging it 
all over Steyr (note the CAPITAL S, grrr) and topi.
 
But to finish up, Rich : you, myself and Catherine all know each
other IRL, so I don't think we need to bicker over this.  I know 
I'm bickering over it, but that's just coz I like to have the last
word *grin*.  It seems like a simple misunderstanding, no harm done.

Hey I usually never place anything on here but this just came to and well

should pay the police what it is worth.  I just lost two very good friends 
to a drug bust gone bad.  Why no body armor provided to the officers . If 
the goverment can fly congress people around in Helicopters to play golf 
then they can supplement the pay of Police so we can get proper equipment. 
One f my buddies was getting married, now he has a widow before the 
marriage.  It turns my stomach when the public at large votes down pay 
increases to police and law enforcement personnel.  Oh by the way there is 
an agency about 15 miles from where i live that 75% of the staff is on 
welfare because they can not make enough as a officer to feed there 
families.  Please respond to this and suggest something to your local

know if I can help. And for your suggestion about going to the local 
snakes about proper equipment for protection and higher pay so that these 
men and women can support their families (interesting how the govt wont 
give them pay raises, but instead cut their salaries which force many to 
turn to welfare putting a greater strain on the system...and guess who 
pays for it...? We do, every one of us, in higher taxes and in 
less-than-adequate police enforcement.)...as I was saying, I intend to

I'm not sure how to phrase this, because I'm not trying to attack anyone

"System" of Law Enforcement, the courts and so on, whereas anyone with 
actual criminal intent will have the advantage of KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT.

It's almsot like they set you guys up for it.
I mean, no one seems to sit down and find out what cops need in order to 
do their jobs safely and effectively WITHOUT either getting killed or 
being driven to unneccesary extremes. Instead they just stick you out 
there and let things happen. Do you see what I'm saying? I'm not sure how 
to put it, but...It's almost like the apathy of the citizenry and the 
actual malevolence of the powers that be are placing you on the chopping

If you're still taking votes, I'd vote for the end of September or
the begining of October.

The park idea sounds great too.  One question:  are we allowed to
have beer there?  Hope so, and I also hope you guys can pull it off.  I'll
be there with bells on.  Sorry I can't remember who is organizing this or I'd
give you my thanks.

I can sympathize with your side. The real issue is that the "justice" 
system rapes the innocent and coddles the guilty. Happens again and again. 

If you're actually innocent, you're screwed. You have to hire a real 
defender, go thru all the lengthy pre-trial hearings, blah blah blah. If 
you're guilty, just plea bargain away 'till you've got 3 months probation 
instead of 2-5 years in jail. Sucks, but that's how it goes in this 
country.

I also only have limited respect for law enforcement in general, but that 
is more a product of my environment, I think. (I live in a town where gay 
bashing is popular among both hoods and cops). There are some cops I 
really respect a great deal, but I haven't met many.\

Yes, I DO agree...We have "make do" sometimes with second best because  
the equipment is "too expensive."  In other cases, we have to buy it out 
of our own pockets.  And on a cops salary, we have to decide if we want to 
buy groceries for our families or get our equipment.  You figure it out.

Salaries are usually connected to what services the individual can supply 
and at what level society deems them worthy.  So why is it that the Police 
and teachers earn less than garbagemen (ooops, un PC, lets say sanitation 
engineers)?  Does society deem waste disposal more worthy than societal 
protection or the instruction of its children.  Are our priorities in the 
States messed or what?

against POLICE OFFICERS pigs..cops.whatever..because i myself was 
arrested 3 seperate times..the 1st was for agg assault on a police 
officer...the pig was offduty..in civvy clothes and was pissedd at 
something..so he deceided to fuck with someone..he chose my friends and    
I..said some bullshit about  not liking the way we looked at him,...
said he was a cop..bullshit..i beat the fuck out of him...'trol car came 
by..i was arrested for that charge..unti llater did discover that he was 
who he said...bad call on his part?
2nd.. ..was sitting in front of my house..next door  neighbors kid said 
something to me ..i told her to go play..the mother came out...said she is 
calling..awww fuck this..too long..
My point is..You are guilty until proven innocent!

Well, from my experiences with police, all I can say is that they have the

four separate incidences in which all they could do well was cover their 
asses and stand around giving me the "nothing we can do" shit routine.

When I see a cop actually play a beneficial role in the justice system,    
I'll feel good about having my wages taken from me to pay his salary.  But 
as of yet they are a waste of good, hard-earned money.

I know this is a little late.  I generally don't come to this base.  I'm
really sorry to hear about your friend and I really sincerely hope that
something like that will never happen again.  

However. I have to let you know why I can't bring myself to go out of my
way to help the police.

I am an African American.  One night about a year and a half ago (almost
two years) a friend of mine (who is white) and I were driving down
Biscayne Blvd. in  Miami, Fl.  We got pulled over (for reasons I'm still
trying to ascertain) and the cop started to harass us, particularly me.
He pulled me out of the car and asked me for I.D. and searched me for any
drugs.  Finally he turned to my friend and said to her "how the fuck can
you have this nigger in your car?"  I snapped and grabbed his nightstick
and beat the fuck out of him.  

I turned myself in and before I got a chance to see a lawyer or anything
(and I haven't told anyone this until now) his two friend pulled me into a
little room and beat the snot out of me (making sure to hit me in places
where it won't easily be seen).  After that, they sent me home without
pressing charges.  I couldn't walk straight for a week.  Do you know why I
didn't do anything about it?  Because the entire force was made up of the
same kinda shit that did what they did to me!  I had no chance.

So, that's my story.  I am sypmathetic to your friends and your situation
but I can't see myself telling my congressman to give these assholes more
nightsticks to kick my ass because I'm black.

sorry

So ... let me get this right ...
 
The police started harrassing you pretty badly, so you beat the crap
out of him.  Then you did the right thing and turned yourself in.
And this time YOU got the crap beaten out of you.  Then they let you
go.  Seems to me the only person who is majorly in the wrong here is
the police officer who started it all.  But from a technical view,
EVERYONE is in the wrong.  He only verbally assaulted you from what
you describe, then you take his weapon and hammer him.  You're no
angel here either.
 
You had your reasons to hit him.  Then, when the police had you,
from their perspective they had someone who had beaten up a fellow
officer.  If you had someone who had beaten the shit out of one of
your friends, I'm sure you would not take kindly to him either.
So they beat you up and turned you loose.  I personally would rather
cop a beating than go up on charges.  Think yourself lucky.
 
I think the beating you copped was fair enough.  Do unto others as ...
The main thing wrong here is the police officer who insulted you in
the first place.  There are bad cops around for sure. You'll get 
pricks in ANY organization, particularly an organization which gives 
the individual certain 'powers'.  But just because you've had a bad
experience with ONE of the police force, doesn't mean ALL police are
bad.
 
I think this whole thing is a vicious circle.  Much of the public
hates the police because the police treat them like shit.  Whereas
some of the police treat the public like shit because thats what they
get from the public.  Respect must work both ways.
 
Although I also think that the vast majority of police come out of
training with good intentions and attitudes, but develop their bad
habits from exposure to all the crap they cop from all you civilian
pieces of shit (no, I'm not a police officer).  OK, so this 
particular officer's racist views are an exception.

"Respect must work in both ways."

I concur. However, what is one to do in the case that respect does not 
exist on either side? This is a situation in which both parties have 
developed an attitude towards their opposites. Perhaps the only way in 
which to stop this is to keep the attitudes from developing in the first 
place. 

In Pele's case, I'd have to agree that the cop who verbally assaulted him 
was in the wrong. However, Pele, you had no right to beat him...

As far as this whole Raging controversy goes, I got one thing to say.

Cops are Human.
Ergo, they have the same rate of Shits to Normals as does the society that 
produces them. Then, we send them into Life And Death Situations and ask 
them to TAKE CARE OF IT. After a while, they begin to be affected. 

The solution is neither more police nor mnore money for police, nor is it 
Less Police and Less money for them. It is a societial woe, and no amount 
of military troops on the streets (Sorry, Nforcer, but the linbe between 
Police and Paramilitary Squads is too blurry as it is) will cure it. What 
will? Examining ourselves. Examining why Pele is insulted for his race, 
why I am distrusted for My Appearance (I'm white, but I'm big, I have long 
hair, and I wear torn jeans and Leather...this is reason enough where I 
live to CONTINUALLY ROUST ME...I've been picked up o other peoples 
warrants fifty times...IU won't sing you a song about my manly resistance, 
because usually I just go along to get along...I've never been prosecuted, 
noty even when I was recently arrested for actions at Planned Parenthood 
against demonstrators who grabbed a friend) The truth is, when we put 
these men and women into lethal situations, we have to expect them to 
become hardened and cynical...It isn't an excuse for some of their more 
extreme hate-based behavior, but it helps explain it. And there are plenty 
of reasonable, decent people who wear the shields...we can't throw them 
aside and let them die when they are trying to protect us, which is their 
duty, but is our fault.

This is a strange post for an anarchist.....but I don't want to see people 
like Nforcer in body bags before the perfect Anarchy comes...I just lost a 
friend this week and I'm so sick of all the death.

i think you have some pretty valid points...the ones i've treated 
w/respect have always given it back to me...hell, i was pulled over along 
w/another car and the guy in the other car got a ticket cuz he screamed at 
the officer...whereas i just said yes, sir...no, sir...etc. and the guy 
told me flat out "I'm not giving you a ticket because you were very 
cooperative"...hey, might be partial, but at least i was polite...and i 
wasn't KISSASS polite, either..just very humble...

hehehehehe well said juju!

My experience with the police happened when I was 14...I had decided to 
try and impress my friend (who I was meeting later for a campout in her 
grandfather's backyared) by bringing alcohol....I went to a local 
drugstore called Super-X and I shoplifted a bottle of Mad Dog 
20/20...pretty stupid, eh? Needless to say, I got caught, and the store 
pressed charges and I was led from the store in handcuffs...pretty 
traumatic thing for me. When my mom finally came and got me, I was so 
scared. I said "Mom, thank God you're here!" and she spat back at me "I 
ought to let you rot in here!"  My parents were less than amused that 
their pristine, never-got-into-trouble-good-student-girl-scout daughter 
had gotten herself arrested....

Well, anyway, the cop who arrested me was less than sympathetic, but he 
did his job. Looking back, I have no complaints about his treatment of me. 
I deserved what I got, and let me tell you, it taught me a lesson I shall 
not soon forget....the only bad memories I have of the whole situation 
center around the situation, not the cop who was just doing his job and 
arresting a teenager for petty theft.

Only other meetings with the police have been two speeding 
tickets....*shrug* C'est la vie!

It seems clear to me that those of you who have looked down on my actions
and asked me if I was trying to prove something either don't know me or
know nothing about me.

I am not a violent person.  I hate violence, for the most part. I, however
am biracial and am sick and tired of the racist bastards who think that
I'm some sort of mistake. You people are not black.  Being called a nigger
is just as painful as being beat up.  I dealt with a lot of shit from that cop
and his actions were the last straw.  

Point of fact:  I have had dealings with police in the past in one way or
another in the past and even though I don't like them I do respect them
and I have always "gone along to get along."  I have been pulled over for
being in the wrong neighborhood or being out with other black people at 1am.
I graduated high school at the top of my class.  I have a 143 IQ and I am
studying Nuclear Engineering at Georgia Tech!  I am not bragging.  I am
trying to make a point.  I am sick and fucking tired of being assumed to
be a fucking drug dealer just because I'm black.  If any one of you out
there think I was wrong in beating that cop, that's your opinion but I
seriously suggest that you don't call me a nigger to my face.  You'll get
the same treatment.

For your information.  I cooperated entirely with that officer (despite
that fact that he was accusing me of everything from drug running to murder)
up until the point he called me nigger.  And if you think that being
called a nigger has something to do with a person's attitude, then I have

One last thing:

I have noticed that a lot of the people who have had runin's with the law
broke the law.  My only crime, in my life, was striking that officer.  I
never said it was right and I'm not justifying my actions, but I know if I
were in the same situation, I'd do it again.  I'd have rather had the book
thrown at me than had my ass kicked for what I did.  Things like this are
swept under the rug because if the news gets a hold of it--RACEWAR.

I'm sure a lot of you understand my point.  A lot of you don't.  I'm sorry
if that's the case but before you condemn me for being human and take up
for the racist pig who verbaly abused me, try and be me for a day.

You'll find that you can't and you just simply can't understand.

That's all I have to say on this matter.  Curse me if you want but that's
how I feel.  Nforcer, if you are reading this...I am sure you're a good

I am white.  As white as they come.  (Well, a shade of pink actually).
I have very blond hair.  If someone comes up to me and calls me
"white-boy" or "gaijin" or "white-trash", I don't take extreme offence
other than because he was trying to insult me.  I have no complex about
being white.  I'm not ashamed of it.
 
Are you ashamed of being black ?  Is that why you take so much offence
at being called a nigger ?  I mean shit, it's only a petty insult.
And don't on about how it's more than that, how it's a whole different 
way of being treated, with beatings, and being treated like filth and 
blah blah blah, and how I, being white, can have no idea what it's 
like.  I won't go into great detail, but I have lived in several 
different countries thoughout my life, and in one of them (for example)
if I walked down the street, people would grab my hair and try to
pull it out of my head, simply because it wasn't black like everyone
elses.
 
Perhaps I have overstepped the mark here because I admit that I know
very little about the plight of black Americans, but it just seems
to me that life is what YOU make it.  If you want to take offence
well that's your problem.  Sure, it's not nice to be called a nigger,
but it's only really offensive if you LET it be.  Maybe it's called
growing a thick skin, I don't know.  I once read a book which
said that when we find things insulting, we are not so much angered
by the fact that someone insulted us, but more by the fact that we LET
ourself FEEL insulted.
 
Anyway, I hope you don't find this insulting, because that's not what I
intended.  I try not to let myself get involved in petty little flame
wars (re Bart), but sometimes I get a little carried away.

Pele, when you say you hated being reminded of your "position",
it seems to me you are accepting that you HAVE that position
but just don't like it.  That's bullshit.  The only "position"
you have is one you make for yourself.  If you don't think you
are the piece of shit the police officer treated you like (and
I don't think you are), then don't be so pissed off by the
whole incident.  HE was the dickhead, not you (at least 
initially), so don't take it so personally.  This police
officer was obviously one fucked up individual.  So why lower
yourself to his level.  Don't let him (or others like him) get
to you.  Sure, you should feel insulted, because he DID insult
you, but verbal insults really are a pretty pathetic way to annoy
someone.  Why not just let it go, then laugh at the officer for
making such a damn fool of himself.
 
And talk about making a fool of himself.  You think I am a white
American ?  Hahahahahaha.  Jeez dude ... I made a large, obvious

After reading through all those messages -- I feel that I must reply.

Pele: I think you have a valid reason to be hostile -- to some extent,
and I can see why in that type of a situation you would let your anger 
fly. However, you need to read the messages a bit more closely. I did not 
say in any way, shape, or form that I thought racism was dying out. 

Regardless of what everyone believes, I think that Natalie made one 
extremely important point: that people need to quit looking at things from 
the past, namely ethnicity. Sure, our ancestors tormented the black race. 
I, living in 1994, am aware of this, but you cannot justify venting your 
anger on me, an individual who had no control over what was going on is 
years passed. I have no problem with people sticking to their heritage, 
but I don't like people bringing up problems that are irreversible.

"I am 1/5th Cherokee Indian......hmmmmmm"

It's true. White man abused the Indian just as much as
the African-American. Obvious problems may not exists with the Indians 
(aside from a past that is marked by their race living on reserves)...

couldn't give money to...do YOU have any idea what that feels like??????

to have a person base an opion about you on your appearance just beacuse 
you happened to have shaved your head???? what is up with that???

personallyi am getting really tired of the whole idea that i am used to 
being in control of those who don't happen to be pigmented the same way i 
am....i dunno   it seems to me that by reminding those of cacusain color 
that we a re oppressing those of darker pigment  that you ( an universal 
you ) are actually keeping those chains on you...give it up...because you  
( the same universal you) are keeping yourself inslaved by subscribing to 
the ideas that words and actions aganst you by someone who obviously is 
not worth your time or effort are actually worth getting riled up about.

Let me clear up a misconception of yours.  I only insult people I know and
they always understand that I'm kidding.  My father was white.  I couldn't
insult a white person without insulting myself.  So before you call me
hypocrytical.  Talk to me or talk to people who know me about me.  You

Ok, let me try this again.  I sunk to his level.  Fine!  I also freely
admit that if put in the same situation, I'd probably do the same thing.

Few people in the country, and in your case, in this world face racism daily.
I do.  Now.  I am not a violent person.  Anyone who knows me will tell you
that.  Ask Zippo.  He's my best friend and knows me well.  He'll tell that
I don't lose my temper often.  In fact.  I have lost my temper three times
in my entire life.  In all thre ocassions, I have little recollection of
what took place, exactly.  All I know is that people got hurt.

And let's face it.  I lost my temper.  I got mad.  It's really easy to say
that I should control myself and I agree, however these are matters that
are easier talked about than acted on.  I don't hate anyone, white or
black (I just said that, I think) but I do hate that cop.  Not just
because he called me a nigger. I forgave him for that.  But because he
made me lose my temper after I had sworn it wouldn't happen again.  If
that makes me an asshole, then I'm an asshole.

Having read all the messages today.  I have to say that I'm sorry.  I'm
not sorry for doing what I did, mind you. That gave me a lot of personal
satisfaction.  I am sorry for making it seem as if I have a problem with
the people on this base.  You people, in your own way were trying to let
me see a different point of view. The problem was that few of you have the
background to know what my point of view is.

I still like the people here and I hope I have made it abundantly clear
that my only real anomisty is towards that cop (and the people who may
support his ideas).  I do also have a problem with the people out there
who think that just becuase I'm black and I have a problem with our
society that I'm allowing stuff to happen to me.  The simple facts are I
work twice as hard as many of my white peers for the same result.  I don't
complain I just do it.  This is America and whether you want to accept it
or no, it is land of the free (anglo-saxon male businessmen) home of the
brave (anyone stupid enough to not vote!)  

I've said all I can.  If you all think that I'm a bad person for what I
have done.  Then there is nothing, now that I can do to change that and I
don't really care at this point.  I want to appologize to: Setyr (sp?) for
callingyou an Yankee  :), and to Natalie for cursing at you :)  I just
felt that I was being attacked and I fought back.  It's not your fault and
I appologize.

Hey duder ... no need to depeart this base on my (or anyone elses

intelligent to argue with *grin*
 
Anyway, just to give my final comments on the past few days of
posts ... in your situation I probably would have done the same 
thing.  Despite what all these "That's no reason to hit him" people
say, I see nothing wrong with a blue here and there.  Mind you, a
cop is probably not the person I'd choose to scrap with.  My only
real gripe was that your bad experience with this cop had you 
labelling them ALL as bad.  
 
I don't know about America, but over here I think they're 
generally a pretty decent mob.  Especially out in the country,
which is where I've had my limited experience with them.
 
But, I guess, even if you still think they're all wankers, that's
up to you, so no big deal.
 
It's been fun  :)

the Cops.  Oh by the way i ws not always a Cop, my first year in college i 
got my ass whooped by a Cop for carring a concealed weapon, a 1.5 inch 
bladed knife, i had a bad attitude and fought him and i lost , but i got 
lucky and i straightened my life into what i am now, An Alumnist with a

Well, I missed the race controversy quite neatly, didn't I?
(As a man who's lived in Edo and London, I think I had something to add, 
but oh well...) Pele, stick around. After all, I PROPOSED THE EXTINCTION 
OF HUMANITY, and I'm still here. I've beaten up people in the past for 
less reason than you had, as well, and I don't let it get me down. 
Violence may not be the answer, but it makes people FEEL a lot better 
sometimes.

Anyway, I went to the eyedoctore, and he had no news, so we don't know if 
that means that I'll be able to see or not...and my friend Nameless has 
decided to keep her baby (Re: Religon board) and her and I, despite no 
romantic affiliation and me knowing it is someone elses, aregoing to live 
together a bit longer until she can get on her feet. (Maybe another year) 
She's two months along, so we will see what happens...I'll of course 
inform you all. (Why? well, in the words of Jim Carrey, "CAUSE I GOTTA!")

Guess I should probably read to the end of this great debate,
but I have 2 put in my $.02;
   Unless you have grown up Black in the United States, One
has no idea what it is like to experience the type of racism
that this country still has. Those of u who have judged Pele's 
reaction 2 the verbal abuse flung at him have NO right to.

  Unless u have lived a life of racial persecution, blatant or
subtle, U cannot say "how u would have reacted" to his situation.


 Pele- I feel for u...growing up in the "Homicide Capital of the
United States" in 1993(E.Palo Alto,CA) I have seen the people we
pay for to "protect & serve" us Serve up nothing but abuse and
humiliation. This country still has a long ways 2 go. Hugs 2 u
and Prayers that it will in fact get better : )

Ok, I dont know where I should post this, so I decided to do it on here. I 
read this cute commentary on Woman and Contraceptives, and although it is 
a little crude, it made me laugh. So I thought I would share it....

From "Hormones From Hell" by Jan King
Chapter 13 "CONTRACEPTION: I'm Just A Girl Who Can't Say No"


MYTH:    The technology of birth control has made quantum leaps into the   
         Space Age.


Who are we kidding? It's the end of the 20th century, and birth control 
practices are still in the Stone Age. And what's worse, many new products 
on the market still pose major health risks - and, of course, all to 
women. We need to make the 21st century an epoch where birth control 
becomes the Sole Responsibility of the Male. C'mon, we women have got a 
lot more to do than sitting around thinking about spermicides all day. The 
thought of all those desperate sperm getting killed is just too big a 
guilt trip for us to handle.

After considering the options available to us, intelligent women should 
use the only 100% safe *oral* birth control: the word "No." And if that's 
just not possible, here are a few of the prehistoric birth control methods 
available to us:


                            THE IUD

Do you remember reading about the torture racks popular during the Spanish 
Inquisition? Well, like the kid in "Poltergeist II" says, "They're 
BAAAAAACK." And you can find them installed in your GYNs' offices. 
Everyday, women are stretched out on them and "fitted" with their IUD's. 
Note: the term "fitted" is used loosely here. Constructed of serrated 
steel and displaying several rows of toothlike structres die cast from 
Jaws models, they act like acharm to lure unsuspecting sperm to their 
grisly demise. There is a basic problem, though. To place one in
the uterus, the IUD with its one inch diameter must be forced through a 
1/2" opening of the cervix. And to compound things, most GYN's insist they 
are dexterous enough to insert them with out anethesia. Oh sure! And these 
are the same guys who won't clip their own toenails without having a 
sedative first!

And how do they fare for safety? Let us count the lawsuits. Most 
pharmaceutical companies employ men who go to great lengths in playing 
down their risks. Male doctors are also a part of this conspiracy. Do you 
realize the little pat speech they spout about the safety and reliability 
of the IUD was written by a team of used car salesmen?

        "Now, ladies. We do not pretend to gloss over some minor risks 
         here. But infection, hemorrhage, death...we're talking peanuts
         in exchange for the happiness of a husband who won't have to use
         those miserable condoms anymore."

It seems to me that the equitable solution to this problem is for an 
all-female pharmaceutical company to devise a male counterpart of the IUD. 
It would be "painlessly" inserted into the male's uretha via a Foley 
catheter. And since it would be inserted only four inches into the uretha, 
according to what you men have told us about your anatomical structures, 
you could easily accomodate it with an extra two to seix inches to spare. 
So, come on guys. Help us gals with this birth control thing by giving 
your "fair share." We're sure you can all rise to meet the operation!




Next devise: the diaphragm...to be discussed in my next post!

Dee

As promised.....more on CONTRACEPTIVES....


                            THE DIAPHRAGM

Inserting one of these things requires the dexterity of a seasoned 
magician like David Copperfield. You might even want to ask David to help 
you, but chances are he's booked already. The mere THOUGHT of having to 
insert a diaphragm sneds many women off packing to the Convent. Most 
people don't realize that the diaphragm is manufactured by the same 
company who makes the Frisbee. Constructed of latex rubber with a spring 
action stronger than a mousetrap's, extreme caution should be taken when 
trying to insert it. Letting it slip before it's halfway in could result 
in the diaphragm shooting across the room and slicing your ficus tree in 
half. The wrost part is reaching your hand into what feel like a Giant 
Clam - a sensation about as pleasant as feeling dead fish. Probing along, 
your goal is to find the tip of the cervix. Once you're there (it seems 
like about 30 feet), your elbow may have disappeared. Now it is time to 
let go of the diaphragm's spring action, allowing it to snap into the 
correct position. Brace yourself against a wall because when you let go, 
the uterus will be absorbing shock waves of an intensity not felt since 
Hiroshima.

Physician's say the diaphragm has a high success rate of preventing 
pregnancy when used properly. Also, it must be removed within 12 hours 
after sexual relations. The bad news is that gettign it OUT makes putting 
it IN look like child's play. You have to go through all those *pleasant* 
sensations you did when inserting it, PLUS now you have to hook your 
finger around its delicate rim, greased up by the repeated applications of 
spermicidal jelly. A note of caution: fingernails are the diaphragm's 
worst nightmare. You can easily tear through the fragile latex with a 
well-manicured talon. And for heaven sakes, don't go after it wearing 
Lee's Press-On nails. Women have been known to lose an entire set of them 
and still fail to remove the diaphragm. This is also nearly, if not 
down-right impossible, to explain to a GYN. It's more embarrassing than 
having him try to retrieve your tampon because you lost the string during 
insertion. At least they see that in their practice all the time.....





This is rather crude and tasteless isnt it? *hehehe* If this offends 
anyone I apologize. I found it to be hysterically funny (somehow I dont 
think the men who read this board will share my views......)

Well... I don't know... I USED to have a lamelist in my plan, but those 
ppl ceased to exist... funny how that worked out... Ppl tend to realise 
after a while (usually) that they are lame, so they either stop acting 
that way or start using another name... I agree with Peter: there 
shouldn't be a social elite on yabbs (although there does seem to be one 
anyways... some of us are just on here too damned often *grin*) if you 
don't like someone, just don't listen/talk to them...

3. would have to figure out what to tell my prents ( i live at home and if 
my mom knew i was back on the net, she would kill me, cause the last time 
i was on the net, i screwed up my grades so bad i had to leave the school

Just an informational question here.  It may be too personal, if so just 
ignore me and I'll go away. 

Being a Canadian, who doesn't travel much, how do you live in New York on 
$4.25/hr?  I have always been under the impression that you have to be 
somewhat wealthy to live in New York.

Yeah, and another thing I've noticed about women and men:

Women say things like "Men are such neanderthals" and "men aren't in touch 
with their feelings", and asky continuously for an emotional tally of 
their lover's Psyche. BUT ONLY WHEN THEY KNOW HE HAS NOTHING TO REPORT>

When you've metamrphically transfrmed into a bag of neuroses and WANT to

Subject: sex III
Date: Thu Aug 18 16:33:10 1994

Ok, all....I posted (a while ago) an interesting satire on 
contraception....I ended with the diaphragm. Here are the next forms of 
contraception under attack....

Once again, this is from "Hormones From Hell" by Jan King


                            FOAM

In order to be effective, contraceptive foam has to be used in the same 
quantities it would take to cover a runway for an emergency landing of a 
Boeing 747. One of the biggest drawbacks of foam is that swimming is 
prohibited for 24 hours after application, because the user now has the 
dangerous potential of acting as a giant Alka-Seltzer tablet.




                            JELLIES

Similar to the principle of foam, this stuff can be far more hazardous to 
both sexes. If left in place too long, it can "set-up," with the potential 
of becoming harder than rock. Then, when attempting any further sexual 
activity, penetration will be almost impossible unless the male uses a 
condom with a tiny miner's hemlmet on the end. And he must be made aware 
of the very real possibility of suffering mutilation in a mine shaft 
collapse.




                           THE SPONGE

This is a new and unique idea in contraceptive items. It is small, 
compact, and has earned millions for the O-Cello company. Appearing to be 
the safest porduct to come along in years, it does have one side effect - 
not dangerous, but annoying. Once it's in place, the wearer is cautioned 
that upon entering the bathtub, the water level will become drastically 
reduced. Head injury must also be mentioned as a rare, but possible side 
effect from making sudden moves while wearing the sponge. For example, 
carelessly flopping into a chair might create a "rebound" effect, 
catapulting the unsuspecting female into the ceiling.



                              THE PILL

Who needs it? The package alone contains more warnings than were issued at 
the Iran/Contra Hearings. Some of the possible side effects include 
stroke, heart attack, cancer, unwanted pregnancy, and divorce. Plus, if 
you smoke, the incidences are all doubled. If you smoke and drink - triple 
it. If you smoke, drink, and have sex - forget it! You won't live long 
enough to finish out the package. Expert medical advice tells us that 
Russian Roulette gives better odds.



                               CONDOMS

The first complaint about this birth control product comes from the female 
sector of the population. We think manufacturers need to design a package 
that takes less time to open. While all men still cling to the story that 
they can last for an entire evening, most of them can't even last until 
they get the package open. The second complaint is from the
 men who are concerned about the expiration date stamped on a box of 
condoms. They all say the same thing: "Who needs this kind of pressure?"



                           THE RYTHM METHOD

This rarely works. And unless you are doing it with Bobby Brown in the 
room, forget it.



                                CELIBACY

It is a scientific fact taht any organ which is not used regularly will 
eventually atrophy. For example, an idle brain will show signs of a 
lowered IQ; leg muscels rendered immobile by a cast will develop withered 
muscles, and teeth not subjected to the constant grinding of food will 
fall out. And an unused sex organ will do all of the above - and in the 
same order! This poses a double tragedy for some men, too, since their 
brains are reputedly located in the sex organs. So we all need to heed to 
the old saying, "Use it or lose it."

The good news is that there IS one completely safe, painless, and 
trouble-free birth control solution available to 100% of the women 
everywhere. It's called VASECTOMY - and we're all for it!




Hehehehe

Hey Les,

It is a book called "Hormones From Hell" and it is by a wacko named Jan 
King. A friend of mine loaned it to me to read, and I about busted a gut 
laughing. I was thinking about posting something from it about "Sex after 
40" and "Sex in the '90's",,,think I should?

Anyway I just thought that I would give everyone a little chuckle....they 
say that laughter is the best medicine and I have found this to be true!

Enjoi,

Dee

Never heard a women say anything like that, (sniff sniff is that a
hint of stereotype I smell?) Maybe its a cultural difference, come
to Scotland, where Men are Men and sheep are worried.

Watch american television. One friday night, I counted a hundred such 
refrences, on all the ABC comedies, Picket Fences, and also VIPER.
Admittedly, those shows are undoubtedly
written by men, but the women who said them said them blithely,
and there are women writing on Picket Fences.

Here I am again...posting obnoxious things on sex....

For those who missed the first three...these exerpts are from a book by 
Jan King called "Hormones From Hell"

Today's Topic:  SEX AFTER 40


Myth:  Sex gets BETTER after 40.

Maybe for Jane Fonda, but for the rest of us, the following scene is the 
general rule:

The husband whines and complains bitterly: "Gee, dear, I can't remember 
when the LAST time we had sex was."

the wife shoots back: "Oh yeah? Well I CAN and that's why we aren't having 
it anymore!"

But take heart. Sex after 40 doesn't have to become a memory. It simply 
means changing the game plan a little to make accomodations for a
 body is going downhill faster than Jean Claude Killy. Women have to be on 
the alert for situations which have the potential for making their bodies 
appear in worse shape than they already are. We must pay attention to 
details like:


                              POSITION

After 40, a woman's main concern during sex is to display her body in the 
most flattering position available. This automatically eliminates the hope 
of ever assuming the superior role again during lovemaking, because it 
makes the face fall forward and just HANG there, jowls and all. This sight 
will take the starch out of the best of 'em. Also, lying flat on one's 
back has the dangerous potential of quadrupling the square footage of 
thigh spread; a sight so grotesque, your partner may keep the sheet pulled 
up to your chin.

We women are convinced that scientists will soon be isolating the 
"cellulite gene" that produces the devestating hormone responsible for 
lumping up all our body fat. But until they do, we'll have to monitor our 
body positions carefully!


                              LIGHTING

The older we get, the less light we desire on the lovemaking scene. 
Remember in your 20's when you made love in broad daylight, on beaches, in 
cars, and in the shower? After 40, ladies, we've got a lot more to hide 
than just our crow's feet. Our bedrooms will slowly make the transition 
from 60-watt flood bulbs, to 40-watt, to a nightlight, then finally to 
about half the candlepower generated by an elderly firefly. BY age 60, 
we're talking about a room so dark it can only be navigated by bats.


                                FOREPLAY

Do you remember that? He probably doesn't. Past 40, there is very little 
actual kissing going on in the bedroom. It takes too much time and saps 
too much of the energy necessary to complete the actual act. A common 
practice past 40 is for both partners to meet in the center of the bed, 
shake hands and get on with it.

Young women foolishly spend all of their time worrying about what kind of 
orgasm they are SUPPOSED to experience. The studies tell us all about the 
differences between the vaginal, clitoral, uterine, multiple, and most 
popular, the faked orgasm. But, by 40, women arent worried about having 
multiple orgasms...they are worried about haveing ANY orgasm. We are also 
paranoid in this day of AIDS and STD's. Men should never take it 
personally when a mature woman leaps out of bed just seconds after having 
sex and stays in the bathroom douching with Commercial Strength Lysol till 
dawn.

                            NEW AGE SEX:
                        No-no's in the Nineties


MYTH:  A *good* girl never sleeps with a amn she isn't in love with.

Living in the "New Age" doesnt necessarily mean it's not without its new 
problems. Even though we may be given more options and choices in our 
sexual behavior, we shouldn't sit around moping because we're past our 
sexual peaks. the truth is, it's a jungle out ther ein the land of the 
Sexually Active. Maybe we should be glad our hormonally-impaired 
reproductive organs are representing their own era, otherwise known as the 
Age of the Listless Libido.

In the New Age, people don't waste valuable time talking about love. 
they've got more potent sexually stimulating hormones coursing through 
them than Baskin-Robbins has flavors. So they just settle for "know" - 
which means about a 30 minute conversation. During these days of the 
dangerous diseases, you'd better show up at your favorite pick-up bar 
armed with a checklist twice as long as Gene Simmon's tongue. It's the 
best sexual aid you'll ever find to help in identifying potentially safe 
partners. Remember, you're already the victim of your own hormones, so you 
don't want to be the victim of somebody else's misguided ones. The 
keystone of the '90's is precaution - and Safe Sex doesn't mean "not 
falling off the bed" like it used to. So take along your checklist and 
make your opening line something like this:

"HI there...say...you're kinda cute - but first, do you happen to have... 
(at which point you pull out your list)

*  Herpes I?
*  Syphilis?
*  Herpes II?
*  AIDS?
*  Herpes MDXXVIII?
*  Genital Warts?
*  Clap?
*  Crabs?
*  Gonorrhea?
*  Cold Sores?
*  Running Sores?
*  Running Shoes (smelly)?
*  Body Lice?
*  Body Odor?
*  Heart Disease?
*  Heartworm?
*  Facial tics?
*  Dog ticks?
*  Flat feet?
*  Crows feet?
*  The HEartbreak of Psoriasis?
*  Ringworm?
*  A pinki ring?
*  A chest hair dickey?
*  Gold Chains?
*  A membership to the Hair Club For Men?

Also, sexual identity can get pretty confusing in the New Age, so you've 
got to be sure that the person you're contemplating doesn't throw you any 
surprises. The situation clearly warrants further cross-examination, 
employing the tough tactics last used during the McCarthy Hearings:

"Well...you sure look like a Major Hunk to me, big guy...but...are you now 
or have you ever been:

*  Married or single?
*  Straight or Gay?
*  Bisexual or Heterosexual?
*  Jewish or Gentile?
*  Transsexual or transvestite?
*  Aphrodite or hermoaphrodite?
*  A cross-dresser or wearing a Cross-Your-Heart?
*  Into leather, S&M, or Cool Whip?
*  Featured in the chorus line of La Cage Aux Folles?
*  A love child of Steve Garvey?
*  In love with Steve Garvey?"

If you somehow make it past all those major hurdles and actually decide to 
"do it", the next step is to decide upon a mutually agreaable form of 
condom. This information must be finessed with as much dignity as possible 
under the circumstances. A genteel way of introducing the topic would be:

"Condom?"
"Don't mind if I do."
"Latex or Sheepskin? Standard or extra thin? Colored or natural? Ribbed or 
smooth? Lubricated or non-lubricated? Spermicide or plain? Reservoir 
tipped or blunt end? Designer or generic? Jif or Skippy? Battery powered 
or kick start? French tickler or French Vanilla? Eelskin or sharkskin? 
Forward or reverse gear? Wesson oil or motor oil? Sausage or Pepperoni 
stuffed?"

Whew! Now we're getting somewhere. If all systems are go - then the next 
phase is choosing a mutually agreeable site and setting:

"Your place or mine? Outdoors or indoors? Back seat or front? Waterbed or 
regular mattress? Nite time or nooner? Candlelit or dark? Bathtub or 
shower stall? Video camerea or Polaroid? Naked or basic Victoria's Secret? 
Straight or kinky? Sexual aids or fantasy? 120 or 220 volt? Orchestra Pit 
or aisle? Individual or group plan? French or English horn? Amyl nitrate

Holy hormones! Once all the particulars have been worked out, 
unfortuantely so has your sex urge. At this rate, "Zero Population Growth" 
is bound to become a self-fulfilling prophecy in the New Age.

Let's not forget that a lady *always* has the perogative of changing her 
mind. In fact, most women change it more often than their vibrator 
batteries. And if the guys you date don't like it, too bad. To make your 
point, simply pull out a torn condom and shout "Stop in the nae of love!"

And if you think the dating scene is just too sexually demanding for your 
tastes, and you're afraid you might end up disappointing a lot of guys - 
get married - that way you'll only have to disappoint one.

Date: Tue Aug 23 00:40:10 1994

All right...
I really don't want to let yabbs die, so I'm trying to save it...
there are a couple of ways that this could be done... 

1:
If Alex is willing to let us continue to run yabbs on his 'puter until 
another net connection can be found I'd be willing to take on the hassle 
of running the system. I have the hardware and the time, but I can't 
afford a good enough net connection right now, and it'll take time to work 
out a free one.

or 2:
Roth and I could keep the system running of of a commercial site which is 
willing to let us have a connection for $5/month per user... Personally, I 
think it is worth it to keep yabbs alive, because this is the best damned 
BBS I've seen... This will hopefully only be temporary until I can find 
another way to get a good connection... I hate it having to make people 
pay for Yabbs as much, if not more, than anybody else here. Unfortunately, 
it costs a lot of money to get a net connection fast enough to keep up 
with the traffic on yabbs... 

If anybody has any other ideas, comments, suggestions, complaints, etc, 
put them on here or email:
me at les@cyberspace.org
or Roth at michaelhl@ids.net
ANY help would be appriceated!
Keep yabbs alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'd rather not do this myself, because one of the reasons that I am taking
yabbs down (among many) is that i want to be able to use my machine for
other stuff...while yabbs doesn't take the power of the whole system, it
does make a noticable drain on the machine...

Only subscription requests from the address wishing to be subscribed
will be added, if you have friends who want to subscribe, they will

yabbs will die, at least in the way I know it.  I have been on the
net for many years, and have been part of a good many virtual
communities in that time.  I treasure the memories, but even when
many people tried, we could not hold on to a community that was
fading.  Even if someone else puts yabbs up somewhere else, it will
have a slightly different nature, a slightly different character.
It will be a different bbs.

There is nothing inherently wrong with this.  The new bbs could
have a strong, if not stronger, sense of community than yabbs
presently does.  The change may be so subtle that few but the oldest
of the old-timers even notice.  But to deny that it is different
is just not true.

And perhaps appropriately, the name of the mailing list, 'yabbs-is-dead',
is like a good many other things on yabbs, it is a joke.

I've had a number of requests to get copies of the public message bases after
I take the system down.  Since they are in a proprietary format (and thus not
that useful if you don't run yabbs) I've written a program that converts 
entire message bases to something that is a) human readable and b) pine and
elm (both popular unix mail readers) can handle.

When the system goes down I'll make copies every message base converted to
this format available.  This way people can keep their own copies of stuff
like the poetry mail base...

If there is a demand for these files earlier that could probably be arranged
as well...

Ok everybody... I think I've worked out a plan to save yabbs that won't 
cost everybody $5/month...
I'm still trying to get in touch with my friend to see if it'll be okay 
with him ,but it probably will:

I'm going to piece together a 'puter capable of running yabbs that I can 
leave in a friend of mine's dorm room at CMU... He isn't using the 
ethernet connection in his room, which means that there is the net 
connection needed for yabbs (this being the most expensive part gotten for 
free!).
I already have a HD that can be used, and will have a motherboard soon, 
(although it'll only be a 386) and Roth has offered the use of an ethernet 
card and some memory, but I still need to get a case and more memory in 
order to run yabbs efficiently... Thus, in order to save yabbs, I'm asking 
that anybody who can afford to send a donation to please consider doing 
so. Any money (or even parts!) sent will not be used for anything other 
than running yabbs... I'll know for certain in a day or two whether or not 
this plan is going to work, and I will post here once I do. If anybody is 
willing to give a donation, of either money or hardware, please send me 
email at les@cyberspace.org and I'll give you my address and any other 
information... Thanx a lot in advance,

    --Les

Paradox,

I have nothing against saving yabbs so it can be free...I hadn't read 
Death's post here until now.  I'm sorry if you think I was against a free 
yabbs.  I jsut want to see yabbs live on in a very secure environment.  If 
this can be done by Death for free I am all for it..but if there is any 
doubt taht yabbs may be in danger of expiring again..I would rather see 
IDS.net pick it up even at a cost of $5 a month.

I also heard that yabbs would be down during Christmas break and during 
the summer...that would be pretty devastating to most of us who like to 
use the bbs year round. That is all I have to say about that (Forrest 
Gump).

I hope there are no hard feelings between us...

people don't seem to understand that there is no reason why there can't
be multiple yabbs systems...hell, everyone with a machine on the net could 
set one up for all i care...

i would personally rather see yabbs run for free than cost money...i personally
will not pay to access the system...

For all those of you i've met and talked to, thank you its been great.

I sincerly hope yabbs can be relocated and I personally wouldn't mind 
paying to use it, so long as the money is used to keep the net connection
and upgrade the server.

There is a great sense of community here, which is probably why yabbs is
so popular and why everyone will miss it so much. But i'd like to finish
with a thank you to Alex for keeping YABBS going for so long and for all
the memories that began here...

I have a problem with paying for yabbs. Don't get me wrong, i _will_ pay for
the privaledge but...

I discovered yabbs by accident earlier this year. If i had to pay to use
yabbs i wouldn't have given it a second look, i wouldn't have met half the 
people here etc, etc. What will happen to the casual passer by who is just
looking to find something to do, which i'm sure is how most of us discovered
yabbs, what then? I don't see that many newbies coming to yabbs and most of
the new people we'll see will be net subscribers....

The idea is good to keep out the trouble makers however. The few people
who want to spoil it for the rest of us, but freedom is one of the things
that made yabbs what it is....

Think about these points... they are pretty important. Again i'd like to
thank Alex, running a BBS isn't easy and i've learned from this experience.

Thanks to roth who sofar for caring enough about YABBS to take it on.

GPF it'll have at least 8 megs of ram (I already told you that :)
Also, I don't know about running yabbs over a 14.4 SLIP line... I don't 
think it'd work too well...
besides, EVENTUALLY, once I get enough $$ saved up, the yabbsputer will 
get upgraded a bit...
the whole reason why I'm trying to do it this way is so that it'll have a 
reasonably good net connection... and the 'puter's only going to be 
runningyabbs, not being used for anything else, SO....
It shouldn't be too bad... Besides, Yabbs was originally run off of a 
386... l8r,

Yabbs will run okay on a deadicated 386 with 8 megs of ram...you might need
to keep the limit of 20 telnet users, but it won't be so bad...

Remember, phred is only a 486sx/25 (about 50% faster than a 386dx/33), but it
does a whole lot of other stuff besides yabbs as well...

have you ever seen 20 people on an interactive session over slip?  it just
sucks...even 56k isn't that cool...20 ppl don't chew up an entire 10mps line
(t1 is really only 1.5mps anyway), but they can easily generate 5k/sec of
traffic... (which is what a 56k line gets you, remember, its 56kilobits per
second, not kilobytes).  ISDN (112k) would probably hack it, but I don't know
anyone with one... (or even if they are available in this area).

Date: Tue Aug 30 20:27:31 1994

Hey all, I'm really sad about yabbs going down but excited about it's 
salvation.  It kind of sucks that I couldn't make it on here much this summer.
Trouble is, starting Friday, I may not be able to get on for a week or so.
Yabbs will probably be gone by then  :(

I don't know if this is appropriate, but if any of you who have talked to me
don't see me before yabbs dies, I'd just like to say that this is one of the
best groups of people I've met in along time.  This is the only real-time
chat thingy that I've ever done and it is probably the only one I ever will
do.  I'm not really a social misfit, but I've found out that most of you 
aren't either though you may think so.  So overall:  I'd like to say goodbye
and I hope I'll see you soon on the new yabbs!

take care, don't despair, and be nice to people,

This is probably useful general news:
When yabbs goes down phred will still be up (as will yabbs.phred.org, etc, etc,
etc, since they're all the same machine right now).  I will make the gopher 
server and telnet in both have news of yabbs for at least the next few months,
at least when phred is in BSD.

Also, if you want up to the minute news you should join the yabbs-is-dead
mailing list.  Send mail to yabbs-is-dead-request@nine.org.

As far as I know the yabbs gtg won't be happening...unless a new system goes 
up and people there plan it.  I was never involved with this one in the first
place (didn't even really plan on attending)...

The story with yabbs going down is basically that I want to be able to use
my computer for other stuff and don't have the time/energy/interest to run
the system anymore.  Death and a few others are working on getting a new
system up that yabbs could run on.  Details about that will be posted here
until this system goes down, and then after that they will be available on
the yabbs is dead mailing list (to join send mail to 
yabbs-is-dead-request@nine.org).  In addition using gopher or telnet to try
and connect to this yabbs will tell you any current news about the starting
of a replacement system.

If all goes well with Death and his crew total downtime will probably be on
the order of 2 weeks to a month in getting a new system up.

Thanks everyone for making yabbs such a wonderful place.  Thankyou alex 
for creating it :)  Without you ther enever would have been a yabbs for me 
to discover.  If it weren't for yabbs I might never have met my Deaska 
(*hugs* to you hon) and all of my wonderful friends here (*hugs* yto you 
guys too)

Well, I guess this is so long for now, but not really goodbye :)  I'll be 
seeing you all :)  My e-mail is cardinal@dickinson.edu if you need to keep

See you all soon :)  Maybe we'll run into each other on the undernet, or 
in RL, you never know :)

See you all!  And thanks again for making yabbs a great place!!! :)

I guess it's my turn.  I really am going to miss you all.  I have so many 
people that mean a lot to me that I want to say goodbye to.  Don't take it 
personally if I forgot you. 

Zippo:  You are my best friend.  I know you will probably never read this
        because you're away but...you're the only man that I can say "I
        love you" to and not feel funny.  Thanx for being the best and the 
        one to introduce me to yabbs. :)

PBJ:    You know what you mean to me  :)
Unique: *HUG*


Alex:   Thanx a bunch for putting this place together in the first place.
Bart:   Word to the muthafucka!!!  Thanx for the account  :)

Ok..everyone else...:


Jujubee/Annabel/prncess/AMB/Cruella/Aleesha*HUG*/Heart/Police/Covenant/Sens
and everyone else I forgot to mention.  *HUGSTOALL*

Bye everyone.  Please don't let yabbs die. 

A special Hello to my good friend DEATH:  THanx for being so cool and 
trying to keep yabbs alive.

Oh and: Akasha/paradox...ummm....I think that's it.....oh well..

Well, the time is upon us :( time to take my last bows and give thanks to
all the people that made it a great place to be :)


Unique: You are the reason I logged in here as much as I did. I love you
very much and I hope we can cuddle some day ;)

Faith: You are one of the first people I met on here when I logged in for
the very first time. Thanks for listening when I was depressed, or just
talkative :)

Poop: You are great, man..You always had me in stiches when we would talk....
love ya, man..peace out :)

Annabel: What can I say? you made me smile when I was frowning and gave me
reassurance that someday my love would work. Also, for your taste in
music..It was nice discussing musicals with someone who shares my tastes
in music Love ya always :)

Akasha: Thanks for the wonderful backrubs *grin* hopefully, when and if
yabbs is resurrected, i can return the favor :)

Bart: Thanks man...you always ragged me when I was acting like a ass or a
idiot and kept me laughing (and for helping me figure out the IRC)

Well, thats all I can remember..I am in this totally weird mood right
now..I am listening to American Pie by Don McClean right now....This is
truly the day when the music died....If I forgot anyone, please tell
me...I'm sure I did :) Just remember to keep in touch with me, and that I
love you all!

Love,

me then catch me on IRC or email me.  :)

Well, it has finally come to be...

I am home for the weekend, which is the only reason I am on yabbs at all. 
The college I transferred to doesnt have a net connection yet, although we 
get the machine Tuesday, so within the next few weeks we should have 
internet email and all that fun stuff....

Well, I really have made many friends (and a few enemies...) here and I 
want you all to kow that in some way, shape or form, you have all touched 
me in many different ways. I have elarned so much, and true, while many of 
these lessons have been hard to learn, they have been lessons I needed to 
learn. I learned some things about friendship. I learned some things about 
lies and trust. I learned a thing or two about love, although it may have 
been painful and it may have been sad; I even learned a thing or two about 
myself.

I am sorry to see Yabbs go down, but knowing Les, it will be up and 
running soon.

There are way too many of you people to name, but you all know who you 
are. Most of you are named in my plan file. Know that I love you all.

I have to say a few special hellos, mixed with some terrible strong sad 
emotions to the following:

ZIPPO: How could I have ever made it without you?

NEPHILIM: I love you, sweetie.

FAITH/NATALIE/VAL: You guys are the greatest.

BLUEMAX: Where do I begin? Without you, I would be having breakfast with 
         Jesus right now. I love you, sweetie. Thanks for being a true 
         friend.

DEATH: Thanks for being you. And for the efforts you are putting into 
       saving yabbs. You are so wonderful!

For now, know that I love you all, and we may cross paths again someday. 
Until that time, remember...

"To thine ownself be true..."
    -Polonius to Laertes in "Hamlet"

            and

"There are many different worlds, and many different suns; and we have but 
just one world, but we live in different ones."
    -Knopfler

            and

Farewell, all.

Well this is the last few seconds of yabbs !
 
I've had a great time everyone and I hope it will be back up at a new
site soon.
 
I'll omit all the rest of that mushy crap people usually put in a last
post like this because that's just not me.  And besides ... the people
(person) that I want to get all mushy with I can see almost any day in
real life :)  Love ya topi  *grin*
 
So farewell my friends who I won't see again and I hope life treats you
well.  But perhaps you should all stop fooling around on things like 
yabbs and go out and get real lives :)
 
                Have Fun !
