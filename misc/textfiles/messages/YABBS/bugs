Have you or anyone tried to compile YABBS on a NeXT
running NeXT Mach 2.x?

I just gave it a trial make and it just said "bbs.h
is up to date".  I assume that is a trivial problem,
but wanted your opinion before I proceeded.

I used to run an older version of yabbs on NeXT mach, and ran newer 
versions on Mach 2.5 for i386 machines.  It shouldn't be too hard to get 
working.  The error "bbs.h is up to date" sounds like an error in the 
makefile.  Try doing a make yabbs.

My users.dat file is getting hosed on a regular basis.  I retract
my earlier stupid idea that it had something to do with tar.  I think
it clearly doesn't.  It always happens when someone is logged in (ie,
it lets them in, since their passwd works) and something they
do while in the message area causes users.dat to be completely
emptied -- zip zilch nada.

So when users.dat gets hosed and there are absolutely no users in
it, guess what happens to the next person who logs in?  Well, they
create an account, and whaddya know, they are user #0...

You have to run a program called clbase to actaully delete the messages 
(the delete command just marks them for deletion).  clbase also screws up 
file permissions, so I use a script file to fix them afterwards.  If you 
want, I will mail (or post) a copy of this script (which I run 4 times a

Okay, for now it is available via ftp from here in the /pub/yabbs directory. 
I will add it to the distribution when I get the chance.  I run fixup once
every 4 hours (it backs up the user file and message bases to a directory
called bak off of the yabbs tree), and fixupcl once a day (it does the same
thing and cleans message bases).

Just add them to crontab...

You can now use vi as your editor and less as your pager.  To select a new

change your editor.  To use less select r from the same menu.

For those of you who aren't familiar with either program, vi is the standard
system editor of unix.  If you don't currently use it you probably don't want
to learn it for yabbs (it is a great editor, but joe is probably better for
general bbs use).  Less is a pager that has many features not in the default
pager (like going backwards and searching for text).

You can find source for micro-emacs (not GNU) that has a GNU-like interface
and maintains most aspects of Emacs file formats on orion.oac.uci.edu.
It doesn't take anywhere near the amount of memory that GNUEmacs takes.

Does it do it every time that you call the board?  What probably happened
is that yabbs made a temp file for the other process to post a message,
and the guy couldn't figure out how to exit vi or joe or whatever, so he
closed his connection.  Next time the machine came up and you logged in
you got his temp file (although that really shouldn't happen, since the
temp files are based on processes id).

This happens sometimes when my machine crashes, and then I forget to copy
the backup user file to the user file in use (it hasn't happened in a

Ahh...I forgot to fix that.  I wrote a awk script that makes the list,
and I never ran it on this copy of my termcap file.  I'm not even sure
where the list is, i'll have to look around for it.

As for the vt200 problem you mentioned earlier, try using the vt100
emulation.  I am just doing standard termcap stuff, so there shouldn't be
a problem unless the termcap is wrong (i'll look into it).

Actually, it pulls the terminal type from the terminal that you are
connecting from (based on what telnet passes).  So if you are coming off
of a unix box that has your terminal type set correctly things should work
okay for you.  Also, it asks for the type before asking who you are, so
it can't really pull it out of your account (and i like being asked,
because I come off of different machines).

If you come up with a good way to do it I could add it tho...

Both less and joe have definable key bindings.  There should be two files
with the yabbs package that have the keybindings for both (joerc for joe
I think, and less-keys for less, i think).

For vi I had to hack it (well, dmonger hacked it).  I am going to put it

You figured right.  The user file did crash.  The info files are kept in
another file (they are actually just text files in their own directory),
so the only thing that was lost was a few hours worth of last message
pointers (since I just restored the old user file).

I think it was telnetd:/dev/ttyp2 : permission denied actually. 

It looks like the bbsd for the bbs closed unconventionaly, and didn't

Here is the real problem.  If you look in main.c there is a line that
calls setenv, which doesn't seem to be in as many libraries I had
thought.  You can replace it with:
sprintf(buf, "HOME=%s", F_HOME);
putenv(buf);
And make sure to define buf in the declarations.  If you would like I
could fix this in the distribution (since putenv is much more common),
and you could ftp it again...I just discovered this problem yesterday, so
I haven't had the time to do anything about it.

sorry about that, I forgot to remove that in the distribution.  You can
remove everything that looks like "-Z Xlinker" in the makefile.  It is used
on NetBSD to create 386bsd binaries, which I can use with the version of
gdb that I have (which doesn't know about NetBSD binaires).

also, the original docs forgot to tell you to do a "make dirs" before the 
"make install".  I've fixed that...

it shouldn't do that any more...also, what sort of machine are you working

out of the Net2 distribution and add it as an object since Sun's libc doesn't
have it, and I grabbed Eric Allman's <sys/cdefs.h> from sendmail 8.6.4 since
it was handy and SunOS doesn't have that either.  Then it built like a
charm.

cool...i included strsep.c, but need to add an addition to the makefile to 
allow using it (I had the same problem on sunos)...i'll look into getting
a version of cdefs that is portable though...

yeah...i still need to think of a way to make it so that people telnetting in
can get their pick of an editor too...i'll probably just have seperate logins
(like bbsvi, bbsjoe, etc)...

glad you like it!  hopefully more cool stuff will be coming on the way, 
whenever i get to do work on it...probably over xmas break...i really want
a nice X client...

Have you looked at the sendmail 8 cdef's?  I think it might just be one out
of BSD4.4, but it's definitely recent.  I think they use the same one for all
the ports of sendmail 8.  Does that create licence problems for you?

how hard would it be to have yabbs set up to send email out to internet 
and to recieve mail from internet??  i want to get this set up as an 
internet/dialin bbs setup and give bbs users an email address, have it so 
when you post in the (@) private message base you get the option of 
extended address, with just the username it sends it to another user on 
the bbs, but with full email address it sends it out to where ever they 
want to mail the person, that should be pretty easy i would think, the 
harder part would be yabbs getting mail from the outside, maybe userids 
with the + symbol following would be routed to yabbs, ie: email to 
wonko@fubar.bk.psu.edu would send mail to my unix account on fubar but if 
i was running yabbs wonko+@fubar.bk.psu.edu would send the mail to yabbs, 
not the mail spooler.

it will probably take a bit of work, but it is something that I plan on
doing (probably over xmas break if I get the chance).  It would probably
work by having another program that goes through the incoming mail for
a user (like bbs) every 10 minutes or so and posting the messages onto
the email base.

I am also planning usenet access, but that would be a lot more integrated.
Before I do any of this there are some limits that I would like to fix in
the yabbs server and client (like from/to lengths, message lengths, etc). 
All of that stuff should really be dynamic and of unlimited length and right
now it just isn't.

get the package again and recompile.  I changed it so that it doesn't lock
the user file anymore (since the user editor shouldn't ever be run twice

What file is this with?  Add strstr.o to the OBJS= lines in the Makefiles
in the yabbs and yabbsd directories.  Eventually I will get the makefiles
to have machine specific options, but I haven't done that so far...

you aren't linking with -lm.  That isn't RT's, it is just how BSD (and most)
unix machine behave in general.  Floating point stuff is in the math library.

it supports any terminal that has an entry in the default bsd termcap 
(which is probably over 95% of terminals in use).  People can connect with 
ansi, but they won't get any color (they will get the highlighting like 
everyone else does).

Adding color really isn't anything high on my list of priorities right 
now.  There are some many other things that I want to add to yabbs (like a 
nicer curses based client, an x client, usenet support, internet mail 
support, etc) that ansi probably won't happen anytime soon if ever.

If someone else feels like hacking it and does it in a portable manner I 
would consider merging it back into the base code.  There probably isn't a 
whole lot of stuff to change, esp if you do it with mime.

As many of you know, yabbs supports running clients from machines other
than phred, which keeps a much lower load on my machine.  I would like to
try and get as many people as possible using the yabbs clients (basically
anyone who is willing to ftp it and run it from their machine).  Right now
I have a standard unix client (just like the one you can get to by logging
in as bbs).  I'm planning on providing this in binary format for various
systems and I am interested in knowing what most people use.  I should be
able to support (at least): NetBSD/386bsd/FreeBSD, SunOS (for SparcStations),
Ultrix (for DecStations), Linux, and maybe AIX and HP-UX.  If there are any
other systems that people use and would like a client for, let me know and I'll
see if I can get one compiled for you.

If you want to compile your own client you can get the client source through
ftp from /pub/yabbs/yabbscli.tar.gz on this machine (phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu).

Its about 100k on a decstation.  I don't have access to an iris though, so

There are lots of binary yabbs clients available now for ftp from this machine.
They are the same as the client that you use here, and will automatically
connect to this server, so they should appear almost exactly alike (but lots
quicker, esp if you are coming into this machine over a slow link or from
far away).  They will also reduce the system load on my machine by a lot, so
if you can run a client, please do.  You can get them from anonymous ftp to
this machine (phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu or 128.2.111.111) in /pub/yabbs/clients.

The clients also let you use any editor that you want for editting messages,
instead of the internal one, and any pager for use in talk.

The current systypes there are: NetBSD, Linux, Ultrix, SunOS (Sparc), and
HPUX (PA).  In the next few days there will probably be additional clients
for: Dec Alpha, IBM RT (AOS/BSD), and AIX (RS/6000).  

You can also compile your own client with the sources in 
/pub/yabbs/yabbscli.tar.gz.

Here is a copy of the README contained in /pub/yabbs/clients:
-----
This directory contains execuatables for the yabbs text client for various
common system types.  You should just be able to grab the appropriate one
and use it.

If your system type isn't here, you can try to compile the client yourself,
the sources are in "../yabbscli.tar.gz".  If you successfully port it to a
common system, please let us know so that we can include it here as well.

If you have any problems with these clients, please notify both
<htoaster+@cmu.edu> and the person indicated below who compiled the client
and include as much information as possible about what the problem is and
the exact setup of the system you were trying to run it on.

The client will use whatever you have your EDITOR environment variable set
to as your editor and whatever your PAGER environment variable set to as your
pager.  By default the editor is set to /usr/bin/vi and the pager is 
/usr/local/bin/less.

it is in the Makefile.  One of the lines starts with SERVER=localhost, change
that to SERVER=phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu.

also, there is a premade linux client if you want to use that.

I'll try and get a new package out that does work under linux.  I screwed
up on a few of the include files that linux wants, but most BSD derived
systems don't care a whole lot about.

Hi!
I can see that you need a little more help than you've been given so far.
Lets say you enter "talk" and participate in a discussion with someone.  
They leave takl, but you want to tell them something.  If you enter email 
you can send them a "private" message.  Were you to send them a message on 
any of the other boards, then we could all read it, i.e. no privacy.
Conversely, people can send you private messages on the email board.
Here's anothe little lesson.  Notice that this base is named "yabbs Bugs?" 
That means that the sysop wants us to talk about buggs in his yabbs 
program on this board, i.e., not the e-mail board.
However, don't feel dumb.  It's important to ask questions like this.

i fixed it in the current client.  i also made it so that you could surround
channel names by *'s when leaving channels and it will figure it all out,
so that it didn't confuse anyone.

Here is a tricky question though.  I would like to make it so that you could
use the notation /msg <channel> <message> to send a message to a channel.  
Anyone have any preferred ways of delimiting the channel name (so that it
doesn't get confused with an userid).  Irc has you put a # before the channel
name, but since I haven't done that before it could get confusing.  I could
make the client look and see if you are on a channel with that name, but then
if a channel and a person have the same name there could be some confusion.

Any good ideas?

I'm also looking for good ideas on how to deal with the huge amount of time
that it takes to scan through private messages and stuff.  Right now it
has to read each message and send back something saying that it is a private
message.  Also, if you happen to make a mistake and hit n)ext it will go
forever looking for messages to you.

Adding expires would help (right now messages never get deleted, it is on the
todo list), but this won't do it all.  The best solution would probably be
a seperate private message base for each user, but that would take a lot more
in terms of spacial resources on the system.

Anyone else ever look at a good way of handling this before?

Seems it would abuse the server a bit more after each post, but a hash
table containing only the relevant header info would be one way of doing it
that would speed the client response.  Then again, I've never tried to
implement such a trick...

yeah, i was thinking about something along those lines.  Right now the
message bases are implemented using two files per message base, one for
the index and one for the message data, including all of the headers.  I could
put the headers in the index (since they are of fixed size), which might
speed stuff up a bit.  Rewriting the message base format again doesn't sound
that exciting, but it might be the best way.

I could also add a protocol command that is something like readnext:base:msgid,
where it finds the next readable message after the base and msgid.  Just 
thought about that, but coupled with changing the index method it might make
for the fastest searching for new messages.

My other idea would be to have each userid have a list of messages waiting
for them, and then when you post a new message it adds it to the end of the
userids waiting list.  The main problem with that would be maintaining it
on disk, because sometimes the server goes down without flushing the user
file.  I could make it build the list in memory on bootup though...

brainstorming while posting is so much fun :)...all these ideas keep popping
up.

yeah, there aren't really any docs right now, besides the readme file
in /pub/yabbs/clients.  I'm planning on writing one, but haven't had a
chance to.

If you don't specify an editor with your EDITOR environment variable
it should run the internal yabbs editor.  I'll check this out just to make
sure, but that is how it worked last time I checked.

The one thing that is a bit screwed is that it will try and use the less
pager unless you specify another one w/ PAGER.  If you set pager to
be "internal" it will use the internal one (you can do this for the
EDITOR as well).

You could set EDITOR in your .cshrc or likewise.

By default, no, but that is because currently yabbsnet.tar.gz is basically
a copy of my working sources, and I want to have yabbs use less on my machine.
Eventually (pretty soon) I need to repackage my source layout so that I have
my setup and the default setup, making the default setup a little better.

It isn't hard to add, just change one define in yabbs/yabbs.h.  In fact it
looks like I have the default editor set to joe, which is why people are 
having problems.  I'll change it to internal now...  never mind, looking 
back on the code later, it looks like I commented out support for F_EXTERNED.

yeah, it would.  Like I said, I need to come up with a new packaging scheme

Not sure if you realize this or not-- I have Joe installed here, and the 
client used _nothing_.  No errors, just skipped the edit part entirely and
asked if I wanted to post the (nonexistant) message.  I perused the code, 
saw the getenv, and realized that I had removed the setenv EDITOR from my
.cshrc.  Not a biggie, but a bit puzzling....
Other than that (and a couple compile warnings) no problems.  Software works
fine....What would be nice would be a configuration file (.yabbsclirc?  Do I
_really_ want that?) or an option in the makefile (less flexibility) to use
a specific editor, different than EDITOR or internal; and the ability to add
command-line options.  For instance, I like the ability of my mailreader to
use external editors with options on the command line.

I've already started hacking a yabbsrc implementation into the 
client.  Its going to be a general variable storage type thing, 
so you can scan it for particular settings if you need them.

It seemed like a good way to do things, so that you can have 
server names and aliases, ignores, volumes, etc but not 
have to add a big parse_yabbsrc function to the code.  you can
just look up options as you need them.

It's just not quite done yet :)

sorry about the blank message, i screwed up...anyway, We have current DEC
and Sun clients, but a NeXT client would be nice.  You can ftp the code for
it from this machine (phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu) in /pub/yabbs/yabbscli.tar.gz.
The only thing that the client might use that the vax might not support
is the termcap library (and sockets, I'm not sure how vaxen deal with that).
If you do a port there you can change a few functions to ditch the termcap
stuff (i'll explain in more detail if you want it).

In fact porting to anything should be fairly easy.  There are only a few 
termcap or socket specific functions, all of which could be changed to use
anything else.  For instance I think it would be nice to write an msdos
client someday that talks to the comm port to get to a server, like dialin
your connection over an annex, and telnet to the server, and then run
the msdos client.

Too bad I don't have any msdos machines :)  Maybe I'll play with it on my
roommates computer someday.

Think C 5.0 or MPW?

for those of you who follow such things, a new server and client have
been released.  The server is now 0.9c, and adds:
 * support for limiting the number connections from specific locations,
   using wildcards on the hostname, etc.
 * flood protection (still might have a few bugs)
 * idle time tracking, which will also kick people off of the server if they
   are idle for too long (currently 30 minutes)
 * general bug fixes

the new client is version 0.9d and adds:
 * listing of idle times in the w)ho listing
 * brackets in talk no longer do highlighting
 * smiley detection (poses must be longer than two characters, so :) will
   say ":)" instead of "htoaster )").  
 * some general bug fixes

the binary clients in /pub/yabbs/clients will be updated as time permits.

yeah, i'm really sorry about it, but my machine was becoming pretty hard for
me to use for doing personal work (like homework, etc).  I picked 20 as the
number because it seemed like it wasn't reached that often (only at the
most peak hours), so people would still be able to get on if they tried,
but on the other hand it is small enough that it will make a difference for
me.

It seems that when I go to the e-mail section and hit NEXT a long

is no end to this "string of p's", and that is why I had to abnormally
abort.

yeah, well, eventually they will end (its searching for new messages to
you, the p means that it found a private message).  The manner that the email
bases do stuff will be changing whenever I have a few hours to recode them.
No idea when this will be though...  When it does happen there will be no

hmm, that is a side effect of kicking process.  unfourtenatly if i remove
it that people can do their mass joins and leaves to piss people off again...

i assume that you were in 20 channels yourself?  my question would be,
is this necessary?  i could put some hack into not kick and stuff, but...

doing a /c shouldn't have any effect, that isn't even considered a talk

to the yabbs client and server software.  Anyone who maintains the client 
software on a machine or is interested in knowing about new client and server
developments or releases should join this list, it will be very low traffic.

To join send mail to yabbs-announce-request@phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu with your
email address.

The other list is yabbs-dev.  Anyone who is interested in working
on the code or what is going on with the code should join this list.  The
traffic will probably be slightly higher, but still should be pretty low.
If you're running the yabbs server and have done any custom hacks to it you
should probably join.

To join send mail to yabbs-dev-request@phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu with your email
address.  To send mail to the list use the address 
yabbs-dev@phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu.

i allow so few telnet sessions because I was noticing a big performance hit
on my machine by allowing unlimited clients to connect through my machine.
my hope was that if i put a limit anyone who could use a client would, so the
limit wouldn't be that big of a hit.  i know that its been hard getting on,
but if i raise the number of telnet sessions the machine just becomes a lot
slower for me again.

right now there isn't a vax/vms client, although I don't think a port from the
unix client should be very hard, and i'll be willing to help anyone who is
interested in doing this (they should know about programming on the vax, 
because i haven't even really touched one, but i'll point out which parts of
the yabbs client should need to be changed, which is probably only four or
five functions).  if there is a port done i'll distribute the vms client
as well and merge the changes back into my code.

if you're running the Irix version of the client it is a bit out of date.  I'll
see if I can get a newer version compiled, or I can send you instructions on
how to compile it yourself (it isn't very complicated at all).

on the newer clients it prints "ppppp" instead of putting the trailing

if you can't find your .login file it means that you don't have one yet.
you should be able to do 'cp /etc/csh.login .login' to copy the system's 
default .login to your directory, and then edit that one.  to fix the gfiles
do 'setenv PAGER more', it defaults to less (this will change in the next
release).

hmm...it sounds like the development environment on your machine might be
really messed up.  does other stuff compile normally (i'm mentioning this
from needing to give you a copy of varargs.h as well).  yabbs shouldn't
need gnulib unless your machine does by default for everything.

anyway, if normal stuff doesn't compile either (you might want to just
grab something generic like irc and try it) you might want to contact your
sysadmins and yell a lot.

you mean that you hit n)ext in email, and it doesn't find any messages 
before prompting you to go to the next message base?  there could be messages
lying around that aren't new, and so when you do a find or use the list
command it is finding those.

by default you're placed at the last read message in each base, not the first
message...

also, if you're looking for messages to you please use the list headers
command...its a lot less work on the server than using find, and in the email
section will get you the same results.

today i was doing some work on the system that should hopefully keep it some
what more stable.  the machine crashed two or three times today because it
ran out of swap, and so i increased the swap space from 25 megs to 75 megs.
(a lot, but i had the space)

Does  NetBSD like more or less swap than other Unices?  I usually 
keep machines at 2 times or 3 times RAM (if I can-- tough with machines that 
have small disks, or upgraded RAM), but am not nearly as familiar with 
PC Unices....

it is similar to any other paging system...usually we setup machines 
around here with 8 megs of ram and 16 or 20 megs of paging space depending 
on how much disk we want to throw at the thing...before i didn't really 
have enough space (16 megs ram and only 25 megs of paging
space).  currently i have 3 25 meg paging partitions (25 megs on each 
drive), but only two of them are in use right now.  i'll bring the 3rd 
online in the unlikely case that we need it...

so yes, 75 megs is overkill, it just happened to be easy to do it now 
instead of having to find the space later...

right now there isn't a way to do it (unless you're on a system that uses
cut and paste and want to cut and paste your plan file).  I'm planning on
doing this at some point, but it means modifying the default (sucky) editor
to be able to edit files (right now it can just make new ones).

I wouldn't mind a pause at the end of each screenful either.  Making it

some sort of FLUSH command to clear the buffer if you don't want to sit 
through all the backlogged messages.  Or perhaps some sort of history 
mechanism where you can review the last x lines.

You can capture them using your communication software (if you're on aPC), or
use gopher to connect to phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu and download them using your
gopher client (the gfiles just point to a gopher server).

notice that this line starts with a slash, which the editor uses as its

thats exactly the problem.  while your typing a message you aren't doing
anything with the server (the client uploads the whole message at once
when you're done typing your message).  I guess my best suggestion would
be to write it offline and use some sort of ascii upload to stick it all up
at once or split it up like you did.

Using gopher or telnet doesn't matter (the gopher link is really just
telnetting in).  The best way to get onto the system is with a yabbs
client (there are precompiled clients for many systems).

Also, if you do telnet please use the DNS address of the system 
(phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu).  As long as the system is up it will have that
address, but the numeric address (128.2.6.70) isn't necessarily
going to be the same forever (in fact it will probably change in mid-august).

This is true.  They are sent out by the unix shutdown command, and it only
knows about people who login via bbs.

The only messages you should miss are the reboot messages.  If its really
annoying anyone (I have setup the autoreboots to happen when the system
shouldn't see much use, 6a EST) I can make it do a shutdown first.

didn't

what version of the client was this?  I thought I had fixed that a few 
versions ago, but maybe i didn't.  If I didn't there could be a new
client coming out soon (having nothing more than minor fixes though), and 
I could fix it for that one.  

If anyone is running an old client please get the latest version (0.96).
Almost all of the precompiled clients have been updated (everything but
dgux and bsdi I think).  This means we now have clients for:

yabbs.aix
yabbs.alpha
yabbs.bsdi
yabbs.dgux
yabbs.hpux
yabbs.irix
yabbs.linux
yabbs.netbsd (works on freebsd as well)
yabbs.sun3
yabbs.sun4
yabbs.ultrix

with everything but sun3, bsdi, and dgux being 0.96.  This version has lots
of bug fixes (including the ::: bug).

how long ago did you get it though?  we make improvments to the client all
the time and usually upload new versions when we do this.  for instance the 
newest client was put up a few days ago and is a lot more stable than
previous versions in a lot of ways.

okay, cool, i'll check out the problem then.  i'm not sure why i never get
around to fixing this one, i just don't...its so trivial...

none right now.  if anyone is interested in doing a port and knows vms
really well and has some time on their hands they should send me email
and i can't tell them how to get started...shouldn't be too hard to port,

Ummm.. I already mentioned this in the socail misfits base, but to make 
sure you see it:
While I was posting a message, without a client since it's faster for me 
NOT to use one when writing an original message, I ended up making it 
longer than I had originally intended to. However, I never got the chance 
to finish it, because when I was almosr done, the server kicked me off 
for inactivity. I tried again, typing a little bit faster and shortening 
it a bit, but this time, when I signed my name and was about to save it, 
the server kicked me AGAIN! finally, I just got fed up and saved my 
scroll back buffer to a file and endured the lag of using my client to 
post it...

This sort of defeats the purpose of a client in the first place.

If you have an andrew account at CMU, there is a client in
/usr/contributed/bin for most system types.  It may be one version
back since I don't think Alex has had a chance to put the new one there
yet, but it should still work.

And you can always get precompiled clients by ftping here to
phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu to install on your favourite system.

It depends on what you want to get out of a dos port.  This system would
be hard to make into your traditional dos based bbs system.  If you were 
looking for something like that I'd recommend throwing BSD or Linux on the
machine and running yabbs under that.  It will even let you do useful
stuff with the machine while yabbs is running, which you can't do under DOS 
(unless you run OS/2 or Windows NT).  

If you want to do a DOS port of the client that is another story.  Doing a
dos based version that ran over a network would be trviail, there are just
a few things you would have to change in the yabbslib module (which is where
all of the networking is) and replace the termcap code with something more 
suitable for DOS.  If you want to do a modem based port it would be a little
more work, but still probably not too tricky.  You'd probably want to write 
the code to have them modem dial into the persons network access point, 
act as a simple term program until they get to someplace they can telnet to
the yabbs server from, and then start the actual client from there...The
protocl is designed so that it can run over more than just sockets (it is
streams based, so running over a modem would be okay)...  Either port would
take a bit of work, but would be doable.

I'd stay away from the old yabbs code unless you want to see what yabbs was for
historical reasons or something.

Subject: yabbs over modem
Date: Thu Jul 21 13:40:41 1994

on a related note ... i had a neat idea (IMO) last night.  Rather than trying
to dialout to a unix machine where i have tcp/ip, i thought i could probably
get the yabbs client to listen and talk on /dev/com0 rather than over a socket.

My theory was to user kermit, dial into my annex and telnet to the yabbs port
on phred.  Then suspend kermit and run my client, which would open /dev/com0
for read/write and voila ... instant socket :).

I did some of this last night (hacked out send and socket and put write and
open in instead).  I figure i either need to hack the connect routine so that
it will blindly try to login (since i have already gotten the first message
from the server in my kermit session) or have it to all the fun connection
foo on its own (in which case i'll try to make up some sort of config file).

Unfortunately i'm still a little shakey on kermit and com ports ... does the
first method (blindly logging in) sound like it could work if i just suspend
kermit and run yabbs /dev/com0?  or should i not bother and just go for the
dialup code (which i'd probably end up putting in anyway).

any ideas?

how about using kernet to the point that you would type 
"telnet phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu 4225" and have the client do that (you could
use the server name compiled into or the one passed on the command line).
This way the client still gets to see the :YABBSHI:etc message but doesn't
have to have a scripting language to do automated dialins by itself or a
lame term program or whatever.

The only changes should be in yabbslib to bbs_connect, bbsi_creadp and
bbsi_csendp (I think).

kermit's already having control of the device (blah, devices annoy me)

but it would be nice if the client could do the dialout stuff it would need
to ... maybe later

if i end the "telnet phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu 4225" string with \n, will that work

okay, to anyone with enough knowledge to try this who feels adventurous
enough:

grab the yabbs client code ... get it compile a normal client. 

then go to the yabbslib directory.
edit the file yabbslib.c

add: 
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/file.h>

to the top where the rest of the include files are.

then add the line

#define CSTRING "telnet phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu 4225\r"

after the #include statments.  you may need to change this string, so make
sure you can find it later

then replace two functions with the versions you see below 

(in csendp send was replaced with write, and the flags argument was removed)

void bbsi_csendp(int n, char *key, char *command, ...) {
    va_list ap;
    char *parameter, p2[1024], buf[1024];
    int i, x, y;

    va_start(ap, command);
    strcpy(buf, key); strcat(buf, ":");
    strcat(buf, command);

    for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        strcat(buf, ":"); 
        parameter = va_arg(ap, char *);
        for (x = 0, y = 0; parameter[x] != 0; x++) {
            if (parameter[x] == ':') p2[y++] = '\\'; 
            if (parameter[x] == '\\') p2[y++] = '\\'; 
            p2[y++] = parameter[x];
        }
        p2[y] = 0;
        strcat(buf, p2);
    }
    strcat(buf, "\n");
    if (bbs_debug & DBG_SEND) printf("send: %s", buf);
    write(bbs_s, buf, strlen(buf));
}

void bbs_connect(char *server) {
    char buf = '\0';

    bbs_s = open(server, O_RDWR, 0000440);

    write(bbs_s, CSTRING, sizeof(CSTRING));

    while(buf != '_'){
        read(bbs_s, &buf, 1);
        putchar(buf);
    }

    strcpy(bbs_waitkey, "NEWCLI");
    if (!bbs_handlemsg()) {
        cli_fatalerror("Doesn't look like a yabbs server");
    }
}


okay, you're almost done: 

now comes the fun part ... edit CSTRING to be what you would type in from
your dialup connection to get to the yabbs port ... for me its just a 
telnet command.  whatever floats your boat :)

make the client

run your favorite com proram (something that you can suspend) and connect
to your dialup ... get to the pont where entering CSTRING would connect you
to the yabbs port.

suspend the com program and run the modified client.

pray

it has a few problems reading in the initial files from the server, but i've
been able to log in and do anything i need to.

if it works, have fun ... if not hack on it yourself

have fun

It no longer gives you a listing of the messages in the current base when

and I dont know if this is appropriate here,
but I have a suggestion for improvement...I would not
even call it constructive criticism. However, I am sure all the users of 
this board (which I am *very* happy with as it stands) would
appreciate this extra feature...Is it possible to have the
board alert someone that is just logging in that they have new 
personal mail waiting for them? Like from the E-Mail base?
It is not that diffucult, mind you, for us to go and check amnually, but I 
almost missed one that could almost be considered important business.
If it would only involve adding like a line tor two of code to the login 
procedure I am quite sure that everyone would find it helpfull..if it is 
major, I know I could live without it...just thinking that it would be 
nice to have.  Thank you for your time and watch those bughunts...!

Why is it, that 'd' (delete) is listed in the bottom line, but not in the 
command descriptions above ?

actually it might not be a bad idea (though a bit late) to 
outlaw some of the special characters so they can be used in talk commands
for the text client 

since it would be very nice to do:

/msg {dmonger htoaster} whee this is fun 

and have it to go to both people

well, i'm going to be weeding out old accounts soon anyhow...it wouldn't be
hard to kill everyone with invalid charaters in their names too...

any characters people would like to see gone?  so far the list will probably
be: \ / # { } < >

# will be used in future clients to send messages to channels (is this just
a little to irc like sometimes?) ... / is already illegal, \ is nice to make
illegal for people on winnt or os/2 systems who might run the server (can't be 
done yet, but who knows down the road) ... the others are just nice characters
for making sets...

In case you haven't heard of me, I'm the new guy with the incredible
Mind Game puzzle in the M) section of your base!  I would
like to make a suggestion - one that will increase the attention of this 
base and provide outstanding responses to questions asked - and one
to provide an open path to progress in this great country.
* Icebox laughs at speech humor *

1.  Environmental Issues - Ecoboard!
    

    Change the title from what it is to what it can be!

2.  Anarchy in the US (politics) - Poly Sci!

    Again - another title change - which can involve other interesting
    points of view.


3.  Suggestions!

    Yep!  Exactly!


------------------------------------------------------------------
So, my dear companions - what do you think?

Your buddy6,
ICEBOX

doesn't seem like much of a change to me...

it will always be anarchy in the us...and the title can't get much longer
than it is now...the anarchy in the us name is for historical significance...
and politics explains what the base is used for just fine...

> 3.  Suggestions!
>     Yep!  Exactly!

This board seems to work okay for that...its low enough traffic and stuff...

my thoughts on the "death" of yabbs:

Yabbs will live somehow.  Right now (as far as i know), death is working
on getting a system set up that will run the software, one that sounds like
it should do fine (though i think it should have a different name than
yabbs so that the bbs's isn't as strongly connected to the software).

the software will (hoepfully) still be supported and upgraded.  I really
think that the yabbs system has potential to make a good freenet bbs, and
i hope i have the time to add some new features this summer.  the "core
development team" is already working on an upgrade to make it easier to 
add features to the server and the client.

Still, the idea that there can be only one yabbs just isn't right tho.  
Anyone can setup the system if they happened to have a unix box around
:).  The user base and the rest of the system will have to happen over time,
but there's no reason that people can't or shouldn't try.
