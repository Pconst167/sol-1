That's not really that strange, simply observing strange/bad things going 
on around you.  I do a lot of that, just watching people walk around and 
talk and trying to see what motivates them.
What I would like to know is how many people always try to imagine 
themselves from other peoples' points of views?  What I mean is: I rarely 
get mad at anyone or anything ever, because I always have too much 
perspective on situations in my life.  In fact, I sometimes use too much 
perspective and thus fail to act on potentially threatening choices.  How 
common is this to other people?  Do you try to "be in the other person's 
shoes"?

Well, I can't say that I "try to be in the other person's shoes", but at 
times I do seem to find myself there.  I am not sure as to whether it is 
human nature, or just my nature that I often find myself relating to other 
people's situations.  I would assume that my mind chooses for me to merely 
be an obsrever on the scientific level, but my emotions usually take over 
and put me in such a place that I am no longer an observer, but an active 
participant.  being that I feel I am human being with not only a brain, 
but also a spirit, I can never witness a situation without being directly 
affected by it, and and having that effect change my actions in the 
future.  I hope I made some sort of sense to which you may be able to 
relate.
P.S.  I think I am going to like this message base.

But when you are in another's shoes, do you feel what you would
feel in the same situation, or do you actually KNOW how that person
feels.  I see a huge difference between the two.  Most people
can do the first, but not as many are as capable of the second.

In order to accomplish what you describe, two people would have to occupy 
the EXACT same spot at the EXACT same time.  As we all know, this is just 
not possible.  I think what is needed is empathy, or understanding of 
another's situation.  Understanding is the ability to interpret the 
actions of another by knowing what information was mentally processed in 
order to draw the conclusion that was arrived at.  It is not, to coin a 
phrase, "Monday morning quarterbacking" or second guessing.

This situation arises in the aftermath of a police-involved shooting.  A 
police officer makes a split-second decision on whether or not to shoot.  
He is then second-guessed at the leisure of the courts and the public.  I 
am not saying ALL police involved shootings are justified.  I am merely 
saying that the facts should speak for themselves.

While we may want to place someones thoughts, feelings, motivations etc 
into perspective, we all individually import our own prejudices, emotions 
and personal history into how we judge, or analyse the person, and their 
actions.. so is it at all possible to KNOW someone...  somehow, I think 
not...

because we are all unique, we cant put ourselves into someones boots... 
our thoughts are spoiled by the self corrupting factors that make us who 
we are...as sole units in humanity.

myself playing different roles: anger, hatred, ignorance, etc. with 
different people, seeing what would happen.  It was less to "be in their 
shoes" but to watch myself act as sick as them, and see how they 
responded.

This is a really interesting topic which we have brought upon ourselves.  
I'm really intrigued by everyone's responses...I must admit I was 
thoroughly amused by the quote about being "unique".  I do, however, fell 
that each individual is, in fact, unique.  We have all been exposed to 
different environments which have shaped our values, opinions, and way of 
thinking.  Due to differences in perception among each of us individuals, 
any given situation will -appear- to be the way we wish to see it.  
Granted many of us have the same opinions and morals, either for similar 
or different reasons, but the relaity of any situation is going to be 
relative to the individuals involved.  I would venture to say that almost 
everything is relative...

I really have come to the conclusion that deep down inside there is very 
little variation on the human plan, and what little there is gives 
physical and neurochemical differences.  But behavior-wise I think that we 
are all predictable, very predictable,  when it comes to first-circuit 
emotions: hate, lust, greed, amore, blah blah.  We are all programmable 
little beasts, and it shows up in the patterns we program into ourselves: 
cultural traits, obediance to powers that be, eating habits, bs., bs..

You said:
"the only
real place you'll find predictability is in Marketing... coca cola (tm)"

Well, we bought it, right?  Marketing capitalizes on predictable behavior 
patterns of a percentage of the consumer market, in other words, they know 
what we the consumer like.  And coca-cola inc. is a multi-national 
company, just like pepsi, sony, merck pharmaceuticals, etc.  Whole empires 
are built around patterns of behavior.

Our individual socialization processes determine who and what we are.
It all depends on what we are exposed to during our lives.  I don't 
believe that there is a way to EXACTLY duplicate experiences, even for two 
People to be exposed to the same set of circumstances.  Look at the 
examples of natural disasters.  Some people flourish, while others fall 
apart.  This is despite the fact that some who flourish have no experience 
with disaster while those who do, cave in to sheer stress.

Heroism in war time is anpther example.  There are numerous examples of 
people surviving despite of, not because of, their backgrounds. You might 
want to consider this also.

OK, my philosophy on human behavior, which I hope makes some sense.
On the whole, no one feels real.  We all just go through life searching 
for things and feelings that make us feel more real, more solid.  
Different people find different activites that remind them of their own 
reality.  Some people eat, some fuck, some write, some do whatever...

Again, I don't know if this is just my own unique feeling, but I always 
doubt my own existence, and it would seem logical to me that the primary 
motivation of my life is to find some proof that I am real.  Does this 
apply to you people too?  Are you real?  Are you sure?

According to sociological theory, we are "blank slates" when we enter this 
world.  We begin to soak up experiences from the second of birth.  It is 
from that point that we are determined about who/why/what we are.  Society 
impacts on us in different ways.  The people we interact with affect us 
whether we want them to or not.  These outside forces form and sharpen our 
personalities and philosophies, and this process takes our entire lives.

Our home lives determine how we interact with others.  We can learn 
intolerance from our parents or we can totally reject the lifestyle that 
they led.  I direct your attention to the anti-establishment movement of 
the late 60's and early 70's.  This led to a change in attitudes among the 
generation brought up by that group.  This change led to the changes we 
have seen up to this time.

Now we have seen a resurgence of the values held during the 1950's.  This 
is especially true among SOME, but not all, of the generation coming of 
age now.  They have rejected the lifestyles of the older generation and 
adopted a more conservative lifestyle.  Hence the sharply drawn political 
divisions apparent today.  You even show some evidence of the changes 
wrought over the past twenty-five years.  Do your parents have the same 
opinions and attitudes that you do ?  I would venture to say no.

This is true, but hardly surprising.  People have always rebelled a bit 
against the previous generation for some reason or other.  The reason we 
see so much of this in the 20th century is because change has always been 
brought about by technological advances, of which this century has seen 
MANY.  So, as the tech progressed faster and faster, older generations 
couldn't adapt and preferred the old ways, and the new kids were brought 
up in the world of improved tech.  This continues into our age, when we 
not only have normal technology but also behavior technology, physical 
technology, political technology, etc.
So, as innovation proceeds, the older people will be left behind with 
their values and the new kids will take over.  Not a surprise.  In this 
rebellion of the new, the attitudes taken on by the rbebels are not new, 
though, just some rehash of mentalities from previous years.  The periods 
of liberalism and conservatism will cycle in waves.  That's how things 
work.

Extra thoughts:  It will be the next millenium before popular culture 
reinnovates itself.  We've had nothing new since the sixties.  There will 
never be a nostalgia movie made about the eighties (saying this after just 
having watched American Graffiti and Dazed & Confused).

In your last post, you mention innovation.  Yes, I would agree that it 
will be a while before society will change.  Yet the means to change are 
with us at the present time.  I have noticed on other boards here that 
change is a constant subject.  You have discussed these changes with other 
members of the cyber-community.  I would venture to say that as you grow 
older, some of the changes you advocate will not seem as radical as the 
ones advocated by the next generation.  The changes advocated by my 
generation were considered radical for their times.  Some, however, that 
have been implemented are considered "mainstream" today.  According to the 
generation coming up now, they do not go far enough.  Change requires time 
and a consensus, not just a slap-dash approach to problems.

Innovation, is considered heresy by some.  "Why change if our system 
works?",  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  These are common quotes used 
to resist the innovation you so ardently strive for.  Our system is geared 
toward change.  If change is gradual, it is tried and utilized and 
adopted.  If too radical, no one will even give the changes a fair 
hearing.  This is the beauty of our system.  The Constitution has survived 
for over 200 years without any major changes since the original was 
passed.  This only emphasizes my point that change, for the most part, 
must be gradual.

Consider first the amendment that gave the vote to eighteen year olds.  It 
was first proposed during the height of the war in VietNam.  The reasoning 
behind it was that if one was old enough to die for one's country, one 
should have a say in who would make the decisions on who and what to die 
for.  It was eventually passed for just that purpose.  But the change of 
mind-set was a gradual process, that took a few years.  Now, the vote by 
eighteen year olds is considered mainstream, not the radical proposal that 
it was in the late 1960's.

Another example of change was the amendment that ended slavery in the 
United States.  This issue had been in the forefront of American politics 
for a good fifty years before it eventually led to a civil war.  Even 
afterward, the ideas embodied in the basic concepts were radical and 
considered heresy by some of the leading politicians of the period.  It 
was not until the Brown v. Board of Education decision that ALL citizens 
were granted equal access to ALL facilities.  Again, this was a concept 
that took time to evolve.

You may be correct in thinking that there may not be a reason to make 
"American Graffiti" for the 1980's.  Some, however, may disagree with you 
and consider that period as one of our better times.  One has to look at 
the entire spectrum of events that took place during that period.  
National pride was emphasized and strides were made to make the US a 
better nation.  There were other things that were not handled very well.  
Iran-Contra, AIDS, and the problem of crime come to mind.  But, I feel 
that we are making progress.  In order to change what we do not agree 
with, we must be patient.  Radicals who are too strident do not get what 
is needed.

Your comments, as always, are welcome.

In regard to American Graffiti, I probably shouldn't have put that bit in 
the post.  It didn't really have much to do with what I was saying 
earlier.  I was just thinking about how the 80's really had no culture of 
their own other than the punk culture of the early eighties.  Without a 
common culture of the young, there couldn't be a nostalgia movie.  What is 
there to be nostalgic about that could be done in a movie way such that a 
generation would identify with it?  If there's a nostalgia movie for the 
80's, it's Heathers, which is not really nostalgia.

honestly say the person you see here is no different from the person you

little faster thasn you would if you had to deal with all of the outside

truly do get to know the person.  However, if they assume another identity 
then you get to know the true person as easily, if at all.  Well, I have

I agree with you Dest. The person I am here is the same person I am
 in "real life" except for that Tammie isn't as outgoing as Cat is since 
Tammie is a bit  shy. The thing I like about yabbs is that you don't have 
to worry about things like appearences and how people are viewing you and 
judging you here. Our "virtual community" here at yabbs is very different 
from my community at UVM. It's better in some ways, since you all are so 
much more interesting to talk to than some of the people here at GroovyUV, 
but it's worse in other ways, since I'm always wishing you all were here 
in VT so we could hang out and chat for real. The thing that I wonder 
about though is, if we all were in one room together, and had the "yabbs 
convention" you always kid around about, would we be  able to talk to one 
another? Hmmmm. Well, I've confused myself again! :) See you later!

Well, I sure hope we would all be able to talk to each other at a "Yabbs 
convention".  *grin*  Actually, I am 99.99% sure we would have a great 
time talking to one another.  I would be thriled to meet all of my frineds 
here on yabbs and would probably not stop talking.  After all, once we got 
toegther we would be like any other friends.  We could share our present 
experiences, our future experiences, and look back and laugh at all the 
memories we have made together.  It would be just like a reunion, except 
none of us have ever met before.  However, this is not for everyone.  I 
have talked to a few people who prefer to keep the "mystery" of anonimity 
and have no desire to meet the person behind the handle.  So, for them it 
would not be quite so easy because they aren't open to the idea of a face 
to face encounter.  As for anyone else who is willing and open to the 
idea, why not?

don't you think it would be more fun  to have everyone meet *without*

were on yabbs?

Also from experiance on irc, some ppl. are v. different on bbs
than in real life, but alot of ppl. don't notice this them selves
I feel that ppl. should create new idents on irc etc. 
I see irc as the start of a real cyberspace where ppl. create idents and 
interact with other identities. My self i am so much more open o
bbs/irc, which gives me a chance to 'show off' my poetry and really
be myself

I have met several ppl that I previously only knew over the net (primarily 
IRC).  Even though you may have spoken to them fairly extensively before 
you actually met them, I found that had very little effect on what I 
thought of them later.  Some people I thought were really kewl turned out 
to be complete dickheads when I met them and then it becomes hard not to 
let your first impressions get in the way of your net friendship ..... 
possible, but hard.

On the other hand, I do think the net is a good introductory service and 
meeting a friend IRL can substantially benefit that friendship.  Meeting a 
net-friend is a bit of a gamble but a gamble I take quite happily.  It 
helps you to realize what that person is actually like and gives you a 
more realistic outlook.

Looking back on the above two paragraphs, I just realized what a load of 
crap I have written.  Really it amounts to nothing.  But atleast I got all 
you suckers to read it *grin*.  Talk about mind games .. hehehe.  Ooops, 
hangon ... maybe someone is playing games with MY mind getting me to write 
this ?!?!?  Hmmm.  I might have to go and think for a while on that one.

I guess you and I base uor different opinionson our own separate 
experiences.  It has been my experience that the people I meet off IRC are 
very much the same as they had been in IRC.  This is attributed to the 
fact that these particular people were genuine in their thoughts and 
actions to begin with.  There were no false fronts while on IRC so there 
was no need to break through a false front in person and discoverr the 
person was not at all like they had once appeared.  I guess if you choose 
your companions wisely on the net, they may continue to be great friends 
off the net.  Again, this is only from my experience.  I am sure 
everyone's experiences have been and will be different, but I just thougth 
I would share what I knew with the rest of you.  Thanks for taking the

I can't deny that meeting a net-friend can certainly result in a good 
friendship IRL, and perhaps even has a better chance to do so than normal. 
 However the point I am trying to make is that you can't assume that if 
you like someone on the net you will like them IRL.  Over the net I don't 
consiously hide anything about myself, although I do feel that I present a 
slightly different front.  I get a buzz out of meeting ppl IRL who I 
already know over the net but I approach it with a little caution and 
perhaps, common-sense (I think), just in case who I meet is not the same 
as I thought.

I think most ppl will agree that it is interesting, if not good, to meet 
the faces behind the words, but the difference lies in what degree they 
agree with it.  We could go on like this till we are blue in the face 
(fingers ??) and still get no further.  It really is up to the individual 
- how secure they feel around others and their past experiences.  So how 
about some INTERESTING topics on Mind Games ... like how to subconsciously 
persuade ppl to bend to your slightest desire !

It seems that we, especially in the US, have gotten away from the ideals

to see new people on BBS's.  If you don't like what you see, then just hit

to have forgotten or ignored the innocence of those years.

I think the current crop of "boomers" have become cynical with age.  So 
much has gone on since the end of the sixties that the innocence cannot be 
re-claimed.  A certain idealism pervaded those of us who came up during 
that period.  Now, all of a sudden,  the idealism has gone and reality set 
in.  The boomers realize that there is nothing that they can do to change 
basic human nature.  We have become Hobbes' worst nightmare.

Yabbs has become a little less (little???) what it was waaaaaaay back in 
'93... sure, I've met heaps of great ppl here, and that's my main

It just seems that the trend is  that most of the trash ouor screens comes

and have no idea of netiquette. You just get sick of the crap after a

I think this attitude might be preciously what is helping to screw the
board as well.  Why is anyone new going to want to stick around and see
what is here if there are members of the board who seem to have been
around for a long time telling them to fuck off.  I know that if I were
to join a new board and there were people acting this way I would be a
little weary of what was there.

While some of the newbies are being a pain in the ass that doesn't mean
that everyone should be a pain in the ass.  Really, I say ignore the pains
and they will go away.  It is still a very small segment of the total
number of people using the system these days (just for statistics sake,
there are about 150 accounts made per day for the past week, and 2546
total accounts made since Jan 1, 1994).

I know I promised on to enter any non topice related messages in here 
Dest, but oh well. :) I agree that some of the "newbies" (I still hate 
that label) can be annoying, and being female, I've put up with a lot more 
stuff than I had planned too. But ht did put in ignores and channel 
options. You can always find ways to avoin un wanted people. Flooding and 
bombing doesn't do a thing to deter the jerks that plan on ruining our fun 
anay way, it just makes them even more angry. All it does is scare away 
the nice people, and give a hard time to those of us (like me) who's 
servers can't take it. :) Jerks will be jerks, and you'd accomplish much 
more by ignoring them or leaving them on channels together that pissing 
them off and giving them more fuel for their fires.

I have to agree with ht on this one.  Cosmos, I've been here longer than
you, though I only started using the system regularly very recently.  I
don't remember this system belonging to anyone but htoaster.  

If you don't like the direction things are going, work to change them
constructively (and no, your method of changing things is not constructive).
I've thrashed a person or two since I've been here, but I definately haven't
enjoyed it as much as you have.

Yabbs wouldn't be yabbs if it wasn't a free system.  I can think of quite
a few nice people I've met who wouldn't be able to get on at all if there
were some cool eleeet test or an admissions committee cause they started
out not knowing how to run this thing.  Maybe everyone didn't start out
as a newbie (some of us have had a little more netiquette training than
others), but if you sit around and say "this is my system, get off" i'm not
sure how you are any better than the people who come in and start off by trying
to offend anyone.  Any idea cosmos?

Just a thought

I agree.  We should just deal with the annoyance.  Eventually, the newbies 
will graduate to IRC, where the compusex goes on 24-7.  Just be patient 
and wait and try to be accepting of the new people.  I do think it's okay 
to giv newbies a hard time, but don't do it through bombing, direct 
insults, etc.  If some new guy starts talking about his dick, make fun of 
his humor and his intelligence without being abrasive.  He'll (hopefully) 
get the point that that sort of stuff is boring and annoying.  Hope I've

with ones heritage, thus titling themselves *origin prefix* American. I 
don't think it's a case of the title "American" alone not being

no, not really (my father has done the above, he was born in s. africa, and
became a US citizen in the '70s).  If you look at the white culture there it
is really about the farthest thing from African, and really much more English
(at least this is what I have seen in my multiple trips to Zimbabwe).  You 
could argue that the culture is somewhat of a mixture of the two, but it
still isn't the much different culture of the native Africans that were
there originally.  

The problem with the title of American is that it doesn't take into account
the previous history of ones culture.  American culture is still largely
based on the white anglo-saxan culture of western europe, even though a 
large percentage of our citizens come from other lands.  African American
is a just a term that tries to accept this, and show that yes, while they
are Americans, they also realize that they orginally came from a much
different culture and would still like to understand that.

To people like cosmos and Cat.  I don't understand how you can have no 
feelings for your heritage and your home country.  I'm proud to be 
Australian and that patriotism forms a large part of my life, influencing 
things as major as my career.

Not everyone can be proud of their heritage, ideed some hate it and no 
doubt have good reasons for that hatred., but to me, being so apathetic as 
to *not care* about your country is the beginning of the end of society as 
we know it .... although possibly the beginning of a singular, worldwide 
society.

I wonder ... if you have no feelings for your country, do you have any 
feelings for your family ?  Yourself ?  Life in general ?  I mean, 
afterall, a country is (in a way) just a larger version of a family (just 
without the blood ties).

To Cat : Oh.  I do apologise.  I misunderstood what you meant.

To Cosmos : A family is merely a miniature society, defined by ties of 
blood and marriage (although there are more ties to it nowdays).  A 
country is both the physical land and the society which exists on that 
land.  I just think that if nobody gives a shit about their country then 
that is the start of the destrucion of society as we know it.  I also feel 
that apathetic attitudes such as the one you seem to display can also be 
linked directly to crime rates (although don't get me wrong, I'm not 
calling you a criminal).

I think it's time people did start to care again .. not only for 
themselves but for their local town/city, their state, and their country.

As always comments/arguments are welcome.

I think this comes from part of America's 60's heritage.  During that 
period lots of young Americans were indoctrinated into being suspicious of 
, if not hostile to, their country.  This has been passed on, to some 
degree, by the people of that generation, to the current one.  I'm not 
saying this is bad or wrong (even though I am proud to be American), just 
that perhaps it comes from influential rolemodels in a person's life 
(parents, teachers, etc.).

told id your country. This comes from the state, which uses the useful 
little tool of "patriotism" to legitimise its control over a population.

This is not the same as being proud of your city, family or region or 
whatever. It's a nebulous concept imposed on you by others and you are 
told that if necessary you must die for that concept..

You must remember that there are no self-suffiecient nations anymore. To a 
greater or lesser degree, there is no "national economy" to speak of in 
most nations. There is an integrated world econmoy.. From the Brazilian 
coffee you drink in the morning to the table made from Malaysian wood you 
rest your mug on, no country exists in isolation. When the price of iron 
changes on the world commodity markets determines which  families willl 
eat this week and which will be left with no income as firms shift their 
purchases to the cheaper option (often without knowing from where the iron 
came from). 

I could go on for hours.

I support Steyr and all those who have a strong sense of allegiance to

Steyr said -

Ok, easy.  When you have arrogant feelings about anything which your 
rulers back, i.e. wars against other countries, that gives you all the 
justification you need to do whatever you feel like to that country and 
its people, i.e. rape and pillage.  Pride in something other than yourself 
gives you what you feel is the right to anything you please, because your 
country is goddamned great, et al.  Ever hear of anybody do something "for 
love of God and State?"  Sound familiar?  Well that person is fucked in 
the head not only because he/she is psychotically arrogant, but the ruling 
govt. can take advantage of that as well.  If you knew about the American 
Army, you would know how it entices young men and women to join.  Slick 
commercials depicting "real men" hunting down other "bad men."  Pictures 
of "fame, fortune, and glory."  That is, apparently if you are an 
engineer on a nuclear sub, you'll have the skills to do anything in life, 
etc. etc. etc.  Government feeds this "pride" to the point where it can do 
anything.

As long as you have reasons for not having pride in your country (i.e. you

understand is apathetic fools who think if they shut themselves away

 youe for or against your country (lets face it ... ppl against something 
is what brings about change) isn't the issue so much as ppl who don't care

I think, if you have something to be proud of in your country/heritage, 
then be proud, but there are two things to remember:
1)  Don't let your pride lead you into believing that you are better than 
other people.
2)  Just because you aren't proud of something, that doesn't mean other

Subject: Patriotism
Date: Mon Feb 28 03:12:01 1994

I have been following the dabate on this base regarding Patriotism and 
feelings for one's heritage.  It seems that some have the two confused.  
Having one does not mean they have the other.  Patriotism also does NOT 
mean to blindly folow what the government is saying, doing, etc.  
Patriotism, to me, means to have pride in the accomplishments of our past 
and to look hopefully into the future.  The United States have 
accomplished much for a relatively young country.  We explored and 
conquered a continent.  Along with others, the United States developed 
flight for mankind.  The United States put man on the moon.  Those are 
accomplishments to be proud of.

On the other hand, the United States commited genocide against the Native 
American peoples of that inhabited this continent long before the arrival 
of the white race.  The United States, with others, developed 
thermonuclear devices capable of obliterating ALL human life.  Couple of 
things to not be real proud of.  The list could be extended, but I take it 
for granted that all are intelligent to get my point.

I am very patriotic.  I dearly love the United States.  To be told I am 
"fucked in the head" is very insulting.  I am also proud to have a Native 
American culture to be proud of.  It gives roots for me to look back on 
and see how far America has come.  I have served in the Armed Forces for 
the United States (United States Marine Corps, class of 74).  I felt at 
the time, and still do, that this country was something worth fighting 
for.  I can understand what Steyr is saying and can empathize with him.  
So, please, do not dismiss someone because they have strong feelings for 
their country.  As for those of you who have nothing to be proud of other 
than yourselves, you have my sympathy.

way back when, you stated that the crime rate was related
to a lack of patriotism...  I majored in criminology
and can tell you that you are way off base with that one.
If you are going to make faulty correlations, at least
supply the corresponding faulty reasoning behind them, as
you make no statements in support of that idea.
And as far as my view of patriotism (for anyone who
cares, and for those who don't :P ) I don't need it.
I accept that I have a freedom to live the way I choose
in this country within the boundaries placed on me
by the state.  I am grateful for the freedom, and I accept
those boundaries.  I do the best I can to survive, and
that's the best it gets in this day and age.
As for the pathetic state of the nation today, I look to the
disintegration of the family caused in part by the strains
resulting from the ever-lowering standard of living in this
country as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and
the middle class fights for its life.  The American dream
is just about dead, and it's taking patriotism with it.

Ok, I can't argue against a criminology major coz I haven't studied it so

... that crime rates are higher in areas where ppl don't give a shit about 
anything except themselves ... and drawing conclusions from there.  That 
may be wrong too but it's what I see.

I still stand by my opint though ... that the 'who gives a f***' attutide 
is rarely beneficial for a county, whereas a positive (or negative) 
attitude is good.  It provides direction ... or in the negative sense ... 
brings about change..  A country full of ppl who dwell on there own

If you wish to claim that crime rates are higher in areas where
people don't care about anything but themselves, then please
feel free to provide the documentation to prove it.  Perhaps
I can refer you to a few criminology texts.  ;)
You have already conceded that those who are unpatriotic are
not necessarily criminal, are you saying that those who are criminal
are unpatriotic?  Thus areas where pride in country/community/etc.
is low would be those areas where crime is high because those are
attitudes one finds in criminals?  This relates to the view
of crime as a socio-economic phenomena, perhaps you picked up on that
in my last post.
As for apathy, I don't see the problem.  If everyone lived their
lives without regard to others, that would create a problem.
But I do not equate inconsideration for fellow man with political
apathy or lack of patriotism.  I believe you are drawing several
faulty correlations, or at the very least misusing your terms.

I don't believe in past lives in the sense that you yourself

all lives occur at the same time.  And thus the soul is in

will be older than the twin who remained stationary...  time is really 
screwed up

Something to do with how time slows down to zero as you approach the speed 
of light; the twin on the plane ages slower *relative* to the stationary 
twin, because time is different for the moving twin.

Or something like that.  I have an explanation in terms of linear algebra, 
but I don't understand parts of it.  I think I have the gist of it right.  
Any physics majors want to shoot me down on this one?

Lat year in my physics class we had several discussions in regards to time 
and it's existence as well as effect on the world.  We would sit down and 
calculate all of these equations which, to me, seemed nothing more than a 
bunch of made up numbers standing for made up ideas.  The entire concept 
of time eludes me really.  I would venture to say it is entirely relative. 
As with many things I have come to live by, I see time as merely an 
invention of humans in effort to create order- which is a goal of most 
humans on this earth.  We strive for this thing called order and create 
all of these vehiclews by which to acheive it.  I think time is merely one 
of these vehicles.  Just a few thoughts to think about *smile*  As always,

Because of experiments in the late 1800's, it was found that the speed of 
light is independent of the velocity of the instrument measuring it.  So 
if a spaceship travels away from the sun at 100,000 mps (miles per second) 
and measures the speed of light...the result would be the familiar old 
value of 186,000 mps and *not* 86,000 mps.  So Einstein came up with a way 
of relating changing coordinate systems in "space-time."  It's known today 
as his special theory of relativity.

So I'll start off with some definitions are work from there:
1) We have two nonaccelerating coordinate systems S and S' in three-space 
(R^3, or 3-D).  Because there is no acceleration, S' moves at a constant 
velocity relative to S.

2)The corresponding axes of S and S' (x,x',y,y',z, and z') are parallel.  
The origin of S' moves in the positive direction along the x-axis of S, at 
a constant velocity v > 0 relative to S.

3)Two clocks C and C' are placed in space.  C is placed stationary 
relative to S, and C' placed stationary relative to S'.  The time unit is 
in seconds.  At the point where the origins of S and S' are the same, the 
clocks both read zero.

4)The unit of length is the light second (the distance light travels in 
one second).  So the speed of light (in respect to these units) is one 
light second per second.

Because I'll need to use some matrix stuff, a column vector will be 
written as [x1,x2,...,xn]; each component separated by a comma.

The designation of space-time coordinates involves the recognition of 
position and time of an event p.  p has space-time coordinates [x,y,z,t] 
relative to coord-system S and clock C.  p has space-time coord 
[x',y',z',t'] relative to S' and clock C'.

If you can recall from linear algebra, a mapping (or linear 
transformation) can be defined such that for event p at [x,y,z,t] with 
respect to S and C:

T(v):R^4 -> R^4     and     T(v)[x,y,z,t] = [x',y',z',t']

T(v), read T sub v, is one-to-one and onto.  That is, each value in the 
domain has a unique value in the range, and each value in the domain is 
guaranteed an "image" or a transformation, from T(v).

There are some assumptions about T(v) that Einstein used, called the 
"axioms of the Special Theory of Relativity."

(R1) The speed of any light beam, when measured in either coordinate 
system using a clock stationary to its coord. system, is 1.

(R2) T(v) is an isomorphism. (meaning basically that T(v) is invertible; 
it has an inverse matrix)

(R3) For any [x, y, z, t] in R^4,
    If T(v)[x, y, z, t] = [x', y', z', t'], then y' = y, and z' = z.

(R4) For T(v)[x, y, z, t] = [x', y', z', t'],
    x' and t' are independent of y and z.  This means if:
    T(v)[x, y1, z1, t] = [x', y', z', t'] and if
    T(v)[x, y2, z2, t] = [x'', y'', z'', t''] then
    x'' = x' and t'' = t'.

(R5) The origin of S moves in the neg. direction of the x'-axis of S'
at constant velocity -v < 0 as measured from S'.

So, consider the instant the origins of S and S' coincide, and say that a 
flash of light is emitted from the twocommon origins.  The event of the 
light flash when measured with respect to either S and C or S' and C' has 
space-time coord. [0, 0, 0, 0].

Let P be the set of all events whose space-time coord. equal [x, y, z, t] 
relative to S and C, such that the flash is observable from [x, y, z] at 
the time t.  Since the speed of light was defined as 1, at any time t >= 0 
the light flash is obserrvable from any point with distance   d
(sorry lag there)...from any point with distance t times 1, which equals 
t.  These points correspond to x-y-z sphere points with radius t with a 
center at the origin.  This satisfies the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = t^2.

Therefore, an event lies in P if and only if its space-time coord. satisfy 
the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - t^2 = 0, relative to S and C.  The same can 
be said for event P relative to S' and C': it must satisfy the equation 
(x')^2 + (y')^2 + (z')^2 - (t')^2 = 0.

Now the theory gets into inner product spaces...

1 second after the origins of S and S' coincide, the space-time 
coordinates of S' (moving along the x-axis at velocity v), relative to S 
and C are [v, 0, 0, 1].  The space-time coord. for the origin of S' 
relative to S' and C' is [0, 0, 0, t'] for t' > 0.

Therefore T(v)[v, 0, 0, 1] = [0, 0, 0, t'] for some t' > 0.

Let A = { 1 0 0  0 }
        { 0 1 0  0 }
        { 0 0 1  0 }
        { 0 0 0 -1 }, this matrix acts as a basis for the sphere equation 
earlier.  On theory, T*(v) L(A) T(v) = L(A)). 
, so...

<T*(v) L(A) T(v) [v, 0, 0, 1], [v, 0, 0, 1]> =
                            <L(A) [v, 0, 0, 1], [v, 0, 0, 1]> = v^2 - 1

also...

 <T*(v) L(A) T(v) [v, 0, 0, 1], [v, 0, 0, 1]> = 
                            <L(A) T(v) [v, 0, 0, 1], T(v) [v, 0, 0, 1]>

by definition of adjoint transformations in inner product spaces, which 
equals...
                = <L(A)[0, 0, 0, t'], [0, 0, 0, t']> = -(t')^2

So v^2 - 1 = -(t')^2, or t' = (1- v^2) ^(1/2)

Conclussion next...

So... T(v)[v, 0, 0, 1] = [0, 0, 0, (1-v^2)^.5]

Measuring S and C in terms of S' and C' 1 second after the origins 
coincide, there exists a time t'' > 0 on C' such that

T(v)[0, 0, 0, 1] =  [-vt'', 0, 0, t'']  and using the same techniques as 
above, 

t'' = 1/ (1-v^2)^.5

so T(v)[0, 0, 0, 1] = [ -v/(1 - v^2)^.5, 0, 0, 1/(1-v^2)^.5]

TIME CONTRACTION: this is the basis for my point about the twins...

Say the origin of S' corresponds to the twin on the plane, and the origin 
of S corresponds to the stationary twin.  Start them off at the same 
point, so that their origins and their clocks both read zero at point of 
departure.

As viewed from S, the space-time coord. of the plane at t > 0 measured by 
C are [vt, 0, 0, t].  From S' the s-t coord. of the plane at t > 0 is 
measured by [0, 0, 0, t'].  The two sets of points describe the same 
event, so T(v)[vt, 0, 0, t] = [0, 0, 0, t']

T(v) = { 1/(1-v^2)^.5  0  0  -v/(1-v^2)^.5 }
       {        0      1  0        0       }
       {        0      0  1        0       }
       {-v/(1-v^2)^.5  0  0   1/(1-v^2)^.5 }

After matrix multiplication... t' = t(1-v^2)^.5

So the time on the plane whic h the twin experiences, t', is some fraction 
of the time, t, which the stationary twin experiences.  So the plane twni 
leaves the plane younger than the twin who stayed still.

That's about it! Phew!

How about simply saying 'moving clocks run slower'?
The moving twin experienced an acceleration which slowed it's
'clock' relative to the stationary twin.  Thus the moving twin would
age more slowly until deacceleration which would return the moving
twin's 'clock' to the same rate (certainly not time) as the stationary 
one.
Thus the descrepancy in age upon return.  The Lorentz transformations you 
explained in great deal are correct but confusing to the non-physics
type.  Hopefully this intuitive explanation will clarify it.

Interesting topic. :) Hmmm. I'm not sure about love being chemical, that 
sounds so unromantic, even if it is true I guess. I don't think that any 
old couple can fall in love if they work hard enough at it. I know little 
about love, but I don't think it's something that you can force or hope to 
achieve as time passes. Hmmm. 
I alos think love is a nice idea and a great word, but too many people 
throw it around these days like it was meaningless, or get it confused 
with other words. Hmm. As to love in regards of fate and "destiny" ;)
I think fate plays an element in it. Can a person chose who thaey fall in 
love with, or do they just love inspite of themselves?
Also, do you think that a person can stop loving someone they loved? I 
always wondered about that. I think that love and hate are alot alkie. So 
many times, when someone has been hurt by someone they loved, that love 
turns into hate. Or so I've noticed and been told. As I said, I klnow 
little about love, but being an English major, I find it safe to say that 
is makes a great theme in lit! :)

That is how the world operates when it comes to love. ideally, fidelity is 
not meant for humans. humans like animals have basic instincts that they 
can not stay with one spouse. it is not right that humans fall inlove 
with one person, it is not fated. we all have animal instincts to be with 
more than one person. fate plays a major role in love, it has to because i

As for whether one is destined for one true love, my opinion is 
that you plan your life before you are born and that you plan
to be with certain people.  Now, when you get here, all may not
go according to  plan, but you start off with one anyway.
(I know, we New Agers are a strange crew.)  So some people plan to 
be with a certain person in this life and some don't.
So there is no real answer to the question, it's an idividual choice,
as is the rest of your life.

As for what happens after death, I won't say anything cuz I don't
want to be called a liar.  ;)

hmm...about love

Well, the scientific part of me would say that its a bunch of chemicals 
getting together and partying in the head, and that those chemicals were 
programmed to come together by evolution.  But some folks out there will 
call me a heartless bastard; an amoral scientist doomed to create the next 
version of the a-bomb...

So the philosophic part of me would say its looking for the best in others 
and, likewise in ones self.  Looking for the beatific vision I suppose it 
could be called.  But some folks would say I'm full of it.

Then the smart ass part of me would read all the definitions of love 
people come up with, and say that there is so much unknown about it, that 
noone really has any idea what it is, so it's pointless to bicker about 
each individual definition...

but it's late so I won't say that... :)

Just FYI.  Scientists and doctors have isolated chemicals which flow in 
the blood stream of people in love.  Studies show that these  chemical 
slowly dissipate over about ten years.  Relationships that last  this long 
are ussually  characterized by friendship love more than sexual  
attraction.  This research also lends credence to the so called seven year 
itch, although it suggests that it be renamed.   Sorry to all you out 
there who take a more philosophical  perspective to  these things.  As 
some small consolation let me suggest that like most things to do with the 
body and its chemicals, there is no way how these results are affected by 
other variables. Still and all, It is rather intersting is it not? (query: 
 What about  love potions made from these chemicals. ) 

Concering death: When you consider that there is no way to know what 
exists after death nad there is no way to find out, it seems rather 
pointless to me to speculate.  If you concern yourself with living then 
what goes on in the after  will work itslf out, and if it doesn't  you 
wouldn't be able to affect  it anyway.  Just to really stir up the bees, 
let me  also suggest that this same logic can be used to undermine the 
teachings  of virtually every religion in the world.  The purpose of
religion  is to give us guidelines to follow in life in order to ensure a 
good  afterlife.  Death is the underlying cause and religion is the 
effect.  The sheer diversity  of religions on this biosphere is proof 
enough that one single  faith doesn't holds all the cards.  Every one of 
them is a speculation and noone can prove them can their right.  Well, I 
hope noone takes offence to my rantings.  These are just my opinions and I 
welcome any comment.

Love to me is like getting hit by a truck, knocked senseless... and i

Seriously, I welcome all research into what makes things tick in this
world of ours,... but I fear the potential consequences that is born from 
research. 
I don't like the "stand over" attitude that
some ppl have in relation to what's right and wrong, especially when
it comes to love and relationships.
 
Perhaps its jealousy, or the tall poppy syndrome, or just cold
heartedness. No one has the right to decide what is a love and its quality
between two or more people, except those who are involved in that
particular love. There are a lot of big mouths and small brains in this
world... if only they reversed that, listened and thought a bit more...

neither of those are physical pain.

I concur with the general opinion. I'm much rather deal with physical 
pain. Emotional pain stays in your mind long after physical pain goues 
away because emotional pain is much more personal. As to nightmares, they 
only last for a little while, and only when you're sleeping. And usually 
they're brought on by emotional pain. But I'd rather not have to have 
an pain at all. I have a hang up about pain. It hurts. :)

I, for one, must disagree with the general opinion.
I hate physical pain.  At least emotional pain I can to some
extent influence with my thoughts.  Physical pain is not something
I can control.  (I can't take most drugs as I am allergic to them.)
Having said that, I would rather experience a broken heart then a 
broken arm.  A broken heart means that I am alive, that I am
living, and that I was able to love.  A broken arm is just stupid
pain.

would rather feel nothing, when the pain gets too intense. That's why Dr. 
Kevorkian and suicides exist. Lots of folks would rather chance

Then, some people commit suicide in order to relieve a burden on their 
families.  This is the case in some illnesses.  The actor feels that they 
are a burden on their loved ones and decide that, for the benefit of all, 
they should end their life.  They make this decision on their own and fail 
to see the consequences of their act.  They do not see the pain, 
recriminations, and anger that they leave behind.

Especially painful is the question of teen suicide.  They see suicide as 
another plane of existence.  The families are left to deal with the 
questions of "why didn't they talk to me," and "what was going through 
their head at the time."  The teen actor may feel left out, may have had a 
failed relationship, anything.  They may see it as a way to get attention, 
a call for help.  They do not see dead as dead.

I know with some teen suicide, its like the only way out of a terrible 
existence... like punching out of a burning aircraft, you feel as though 
life is at lost anyway, so you have no motivation to continue.

Some of us are fortunate to fail in our attempts, and see the lightof
  nother day, then another week... until something pulls us back from the 
edge...  the others  well... we know already.

its not just pain that drives kids over the edge...whether it be physical 
or emotional, and some kids may not be seeking to leave an imprint on the 
lives of those they leave behind.... they just want to get the screw out 
of there. To them, life only gets worse.. so why the hell continue?

To die, and not give a shit about it, that's the call...

Personally, I just can't see the justification for suicide.  Especially 
teen suicide.  I do agree that your arguement has merit.  On investigating 
these tragedies, the actor leaves clues that lend credence to your 
argument.  I just cannot see why they won't seek help of some kind.  The 
person that ends their life just may have been the one to discover the 
cure for AIDS or any number of killer diseases.  They may be the one to 
make a real difference in this world.  I would just like to have more 
answers.  Can any one else provide some insight ?

If I read you correctly, your argument is that suicide, and
esp. teen suicide, is a waste of a potentially productive and
happy life.  I have to say that in some cases this could be the
case, and the unsuccessful suicide attempts of people who fit
into this category give merit to that argument.  But what
about those who have to endure incredible emotional and
psychological pain?  Who are we to judge what another human
should go through?  Is it enough to say that one day it may get
better?  What if it doesn't?  I think that people in pain often
end up taking it out on others.  I for one can tell you that I 
lived in hell for four years because of a mentally disturbed father
who had himself been abused as a child.  He committed suicide.
And I can honestly say that my life would have continued to be
a living hell had he lived, and that any potential I had would
have been crushed, just as his was.  While I won't say that
his comitting suicide was right or wrong, I will say that in 
taking his life, he saved those of his three children.
(Think about it, some people who commit suicide are future
murderers and criminals, can we judge the correctness or incorrectness
of this act by future possibilites?)

How is the idea of teenage suicide so much harder to understand than
suicide in midlife?  

> I just cannot see why they won't seek help of some kind.

I can tell you (from personal experience) that there just doesn't seem
like there is any help.  Life looks horrible, and they usually don't see 
any way for it to improve.  It is a tragic thing when someone takes their
own life, but many times it isn't just a "desperate plea for help."

I question your use of the word "actor". Suicide isn't just some drama 
someone puts on to get attention.
If someone wants to be dead rather than living, something must be really 
wrong in their lives. Actors are performers, puting on a show for 
entertainment purposes, you can hardly use that word to describe someone 
who is suicidal. That's kinda cynical, don't you think?

Yuppers Cat and dmonger, right on the ball...

But whatever way you look at it though, its still a terrible element in 
life and society today.

Rob, potential suiciders kinda get narrow minded. Only the lucky ones who 
have either the support and guidance of their families, or who just make a 
last min correction to their state of mind will live. 

But then, there are people who do more damage alive (i.e. Le's situation) 
than otherwise... so there's always a good and bad side of it. 

I'd rather be alive, cuz I'm pretty frightened that there may be nothing 
on the other side... not that it would matter. (but that's my personal 
view...so no one please spill any religious stuff on me after)

*sigh*

and I believe there's a future and a purpose for me.

I chose the word actor, instead of victim, because I do not see them as 
the "victim."  In this context, they are doing something, as opposed to 
doing nothing.  I was using the word actor in a more clinical sense.

  I've been thinking lately (please spare any stupid jokes...) and maybe
it's just me, but does society seem to be getting MUCH too complicated
for its own good? There seems to be a natural balance of activities and
ways that people spend their time that is necessary to keep your
sanity, and that balance seems to still be there, but things are piled
higher and higher on each side of all the axes, so that it's coming
close to collapsing altogether. (did that make any sense?)
   to simplify a bit: lets say that one of the axis is between recreation
time and working time. people come up with all these ways to decrease
working time (mostly through technology), so that there will be more
recreation time. but then because of all these new things being invented,
it takes more working time to develop them... and then this turns into an
industry that didn't exist before, which has to maintain a balance of its
own, which takes more working time to complete. And then people figure
out ways to reduce this, and the cycle continues.
   so many things are artificial - economy, industry, fashion, many types
of modern entertainment... and they are all interdependent. if people
could just "peel off" all these layers, we could return to a much simpler
way of life, possibly without sacrificing many of the benefits of 
technology. As long as the things we discarded were on opposite sides of 
the axes, the balance would still be maintained, but we would be one
level closer to a much simpler lifestyle.
   if you have any clue as to what i mean, lemme know. this is just an 
idea
that i've been throwing around. i have a strange relationship with 
technology - i love playing with it and learning about it (i'm a comp 
sci major), it fascinates me, but the direction that it seems to be 
taking in society just doesn't appeal to me. a strange dilemma!

Society and technology are what we make them.  You have to learn to take
things with a grain of salt because if you don't things will get even more 

complicated than they already are.  I do however agree with you about the
layers that we as a society have surrounded ourselves with.  We have
taken technology for granted and we've learned to depend on other things
to do what used to be part of a job.  When there weren't microwaves people
would actually use the stove to cook a meal.  When there weren't copiers
carbon paper worked perfectly.  When there weren't computers people used
old fashion typewriters to do what they had to do.  When there wasn't 
e-mail people used the post office or the telephone.  When there wasn't 
the telephone people used the mail or a messanger.  Because we have all
of these things at our disposal, we are becoming lazier and lazier.  The
thing about all this is that we don't want to get rid of it or forfget 
that it was ever here because then we would be living the life of the 
stone ages.  We have become too dependant on technology and we need to
realize that or we will keep getting lazier and sooner or later we won't
even be communicating.
You made a very good point.  Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

learn to communicate... and then what happens when they get out of
the computer lab? i found myself doing this last year, when i realized
that i was totally different online then in person, so i've been
trying to do more "live" stuff. but more and more people seem to be
just living behind a keyboard now, and it's kinda scary. some people,
esp. companies, seem to like this idea of living without ever leaving
your home, but is that really living at all? i don't think any amount
of technology can replace the feeling of being alive i get when i go
camping with a bunch of friends, the most high-tech thing there being
a little coleman stove, or even just going mountain biking or hiking
for a day. and even then a lot of people seem to like that kind of thing 
for a while but then "can't wait to get back", but a lot of times i feel
like i'd rather live like that. or maybe somewhere in between. it's
just so much more simple, more real... or maybe i'm just rambling...

I don't really think life is any more complicated now than it ever used to 
be.  The flow of technology through our lives is basically the same as it 
was in about 1920 or so.  It's just that the levels are so much higher 
that we think things must be more complex and therefore our lives are just 
being disturbed by everything.
Personally, I like a complex and confused life.  It's much more 
interesting and thought-provoking than a simple, peaceful life.

Hi buzz.. I share some of your attitudes.I've noticed the same thing, and 
especially in my own life. I admit, i am not the "best" socially.. and IRC 
is a place to run to and hide away from the rest of the world, and yet.. 
still be a part of the world (as they are sooo many people here.. it must 
count for a big chunk of the population :) Personally, I have gained a lot 
of support here, have been enabled to speak my view and actually work at 
my argumentative skills ( one point i am definetally not good at in real 
life.. :( ) I feel I've gained a whole lot of confidence, I know of it 
just grows within myself, but it needed to be planted and my IRC friends 
(sorry.. internet friends :) have helped a lot. I AM a better person since 
coming in contact with the internet, and of course - it is GREAT FUN! :)
Another point, along the lines that you touched upon, is your reference to 
the great outdoors. I know or myself, that I appreciate being outside SO 
much more nowadays. It is as a result of being cooped up in a small room, 
glaring at these little computer screen, that this has come about. But it 
HAS come about and that is the point.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 29 Mar 94 12:59:07 EST
Subject: Role-playing Addiction
 
Washington Post Staff Writer John Schwartz has published a moving and
insightful article entitled, "Game Boy."  It explores the life and death of
an eighteen year old man addicted to cyberspace role-playing.  I have asked
Mr Schwartz for permission to post the original article in its entirety.  For
the time being, here's a brief summary.
 
<<begin summary>>
 
Nathaniel Davenport was an unassertive, socially-isolated teenager who did
poorly in high school but had excellent S.A.T. scores.  He entered the
University of California at Santa Cruz autumn 92 and quickly became active in
AmberMUSH, a M.U.D. (multi-user dimension) loosely based on the _Amber_
stories of Roger Zelazny.  AmberMUSH "features a series of mirrors that you
walk through into different elaborate fictional situations: One is the ruins
of a city; another a rowdy Western town; a third, the smoky darkness of the
"World's End Bar," a cross-dimensional speakeasy. Wherever you go, other
players are there, gathered from around the world to engage in a collective
fantasy; you converse with whoever is in the `room' you are in at the time,
something like a pickup game in basketball."
 
Nathaniel became a M.U.D. addict.  He was asked to leave his university
because he had missed all of his classes while living in AmberMUSH.  Back in
Virginia, he continued his addiction through student terminals at George
Mason University, where he would spend entire days interacting with other
role players from around the world.
 
Nathaniel's persona in AmberMUSH was Sabbath, a beautiful seductress devoid
of empathy for the characters she manipulated.  For example, she spent months
seducing another character, only to goad him to his death in a battle with a
more powerful character.
 
After bitter arguments with his family, Nathaniel agreed to get a job.  He
began working at a computer company from 5 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.  He incorporated
his new job into his frenetic role-playing life by skimping on sleep.  A week
after starting work, he apparently fell asleep at the wheel of his mother's
car and smashed head-on into a truck.  He died instantly.
 
When Nathaniel's father sent out requests for correspondence on the Internet,
addressing the AmberMUSH users his son had spent so much of his life with, he
was astonished at the volume and quality of the responses.
 
Over time, Tom Davenport came to believe that Nathaniel's interactions were
not futile game-playing or pornographic flirting.  "[I]n his quest to better
himself, Nathaniel had also turned to the tool he was most comfortable with:
He was using his character to explore social interactions, to learn to be
funny, charming, direct. `He was using the net,' says Davenport, `to work out
his life.'"
 
"Contacted via e-mail, AmberMUSH administrator Mark Grundy said the death of
Nathaniel Davenport has made him think hard about players' responsibility to
one another in the on-line society. `The future for human relationships in
the Communication Age seems particularly uncertain,' Grundy wrote. `For me,
the lesson that Tom has taught is that the answers can come, if you look for
them with the right heart.'"
 
<<end summary>>
 
This young man, isolated from a local community, unhappy in his own skin,
found happiness as a different person in a different world.  The pity is that
he lost touch with his own body's needs.
 
Like a rat on an endorphin high, poor Nathaniel died from addiction to his
own form of satisfaction.  Should we shrug and dismiss his death?  "It's his
problem--he was free to act as he chose."  Surely, but could anyone in his
cyberspace community have helped avoid this sad end, crushed uselessly at the
age of 18?  I wonder if cyberspace role-players will reach out to accept and
support the tangible person behind the electronic persona?  Would it have
helped if someone had asked how Nathaniel was doing instead of focusing only
on Sabbath?
 
As human beings interact electronically, we will be forced to integrate
morality and reason into cyberspace.  Cyberspace must not remain a moral
vacuum; common sense must grow to encompass all the ways we now have to touch
other people's lives and alter our own.

Anyway, the first thing that I thought of when reading that was yabbs.  One of
my biggest concerns in running this system is that it becomes easy for people
to see this as so much of an alternate reality that they forget about real life
and stuff.  Sometimes I wonder if I am being socially responsible running a 
system like this, where I know that some people spend so much time that it
hurts their grades in school, and probably doesn't help in other aspects of 
their life either.  On the other hand I know that a lot of people have met
very close friends on here (I've met some really great people as well), and
that this wouldn't happen if the system didn't exist.  

I guess that I become worried that someone may become so addicted to the type
of computer interaction with people found here and on other systems that they
will loose touch with what is really out there.  Computer interaction is so
weird because while it is still a form of communication, like the phone or
parties or whatever, it creates a layer of abstraction that very few other
mediums do.  You can present yourself however you want, because it is pretty
likely that no one on the other side knows you.  Its easy to change anything,
sex, religion, culture, or even just small things, like presenting yourself
in a little more flirtous way than you normally would (I know that a lot of
people are more open when talking on a computer, myself included, because
it can seem so abstract to think that other people may be on the other side).

But what if people go into it too deep?  What causes that to happen (and it
happens a lot.  MUDs and IRC and systems like this are becoming banned in a
lot of places because schools are worried about the amount of time spent
behind them).  Who's fault is it when it happens?  I am being socially 
unresonsable running a system like this?  If I see that someone is spending
so much time on something like this should I try and see if anything is wrong?

A lot of times I jokingly say "hey, no failing classes because of yabbs," but
it is something that truely bothers me.  I guess I wonder what other people
think of these problems.

Originally I was going to post this to the IRC/MUD/bbs base, but people here
seem to be talking in the vein to some degree, so this seemed like a better
place.

if not typical, at least easily understandable.  The reporter treated the

For some reason, though, it just didn't interest me that much.  I suppose

Not that I'm a psychology wiz, but I have to ask after reading that
article, where was Nathaniel?  What did we really know about him?
We don't know why he was shy and socially isolated.  We don't know
what in his background left him vulnerable to the MUDaddiction.
I think to look only at the MUD as the cause of his death is absurb.
The MUD was the symptom, not the disease.  While I agree that being
moral and reasonable in cyberspace is a nice ideal, let's face the
fact that as merely another aspect of human existence, why expect it to
be any more perfect.  There are a range of personalities on the net
just as in the real world.  To expect them to all stick to a moral
code is unrealistic.  As for netaddiction in and of itself, it really
has many differenyt levels.  I used to spend hours on BBS's, and I'll
admit that my grades might have suffered because of it, but luckily
they didn't.  But I told people that BBS's are like my TV, I don't
sit mindnumb in front of a TV for hours every night.  If I had not been
BBSing for hours, I seriously doubt that I would have been doing my
homework.  The BBS would not have been to blaim.  I think the
first question that should be asked if the time on BBS's/MUD's get
out of hand is, "What are you not getting in your real life that
you get here?"  Just a thought.

Okay, it would seem pretty obvious that someone who spent an
overwhelming amount of time would have reasons for doing so.  But should
we worry?  If the reasons are destructive, yes I suppose we should
worry.  If I decide that I am so unattractive that I can not show my
face in public, and thus only interact through a BBS, I would see that
as a cause for worry.  But if I used to spend 8 hours a day watching tv
and now I spend 8 hours a day on yabbs, well that more a trade-off
on how I spend my time.  I guess what I am saying is that the motives
are different for different people, and I don't know if we should
pry into other's lives by asking them why they are here so much,
as I personally would find that offensive.  But if I felt that I had
built a friendship with someone on a BBS, and I knew that their
reasons for being on one for 8, 10, 15 hours a day were unhealthy, 
then I might feel comfortable enough with them to go ahead and discuss
it.  But as for judging other people on the basis of how they
spend their time and live their lives, I don't think that's appropriate.
To each his own, as long as he's happy and doesn't mess with me.

Here its very simple, you *can't* abuse your account because you are 
charged a lot for using peak time (i.e. business hours) so if you mud 7+ 
hours a day, you are mudding at 1 or 2 in the morning, in which case you

Hmmm. Sounds like a good idea to me. I'd hate to see my school start to 
put restrictions on the Net, but for some people I know that might 
actually help. I have a friend who spent three weeks this semester living 
on a MUD and only coming out of his room for meals. We were all 
concerned, but he snapped out of it after mid-sem grades came out and his 
parents saw them. They took his 'puter away. Now he only spends half his

Our school itself doesn't have any set Net limits. Technically, no one is 
supposed to be using the cluster computers for MUD's and MUSHes, but no 
one enforces this rule I agree though with what you said. Those that are 
on MUDs all the time will be able to find ways to beat the system and get 
there anyway, and the only people those limits will hurt are the ones 
that aren't over-using the system.

For years people have made an effort to try and define themselves to other

they failed to realize is it really doesn't matter what other people think 
of you because there is no one in this world who is ever going to 
understand you.  I always let peopele perceive me any way they like 
because it all comes down to what I think of myself.  There is no law that

Just keep being yourself and let everyone else try and figure you out

It's not real great to label people, but it is interesting and helpful to

Natalie,
Now I see what you meant.  My mom used to do the same thing to me when I 
told her that I wanted to go to Law school.  I think people do these 
things because they are being introduced to something that is not familiar 
to them.  It's their way of not dealing with something new.  I used to 
think it just ran in my family but I've actually found the same kind of 
treatment with some of my professors.  It's very frustrating when all you 
want is a little support and even your family has reached a point where 
they think its something that will blow over so they don't deal with it.  
They put you and your ideas in a little box and they hope it will 
eventually pass.  My friends chalk it up to a generation gap and in some  
cases it is and in others its just that some people are afraid of things 
that aren't "common" in their own lives.
People just can't help the way that they have always think.
This is one of those cases where you can't teach an old dog new tricks.
Thanks for explaining that a little more for me.

labeling is a very left-brained activity. To say that labeling is done 
because the mind can't really understand something is misleading. Labeling 
is the only way the left hemisphere of the brain can understand anything 
at all. YOu see, the left brain thinks in a very linear fashion. lines of 
hierarchy, grouping many thisgs with some similarity into one heading, 
symbolic understandings are all the products of the left brain. This 
explains why language is handled by the left brain. it also explains why 
the left brained have so much trouble drwing--when you try to draw someone 
using your left brain, you come out with little better than a stick 
figure. 
     So, labeling and classification are not at all wrong--in fact they 
are very natural. But like Jasonlee said, you have to examine your 
labeling system to understand how you see the world and maybe how others 
see the world. But also you should take the right brain approach to the

As I alreay told hawke, you can't control the way the mind works--and you 
shouldn't even feel that its wrong(Why fell guilt for that beyond your 
control?). however, sound like instead of changing their method of 
thought--an impossible eneavor--they should try to make an inquiry into
the actual thoughts themselves--theis is extremely difficult for most, but 
at least it isnt totally impossible

  I don't really agree with that... that people shouldn't try to change
their method of thought. what if someone is extremely prejudiced, to
the point that it's not just the occasional racist/sexist thought, but
that their whole way of thinking was based on those ideas? Are you 
saying that if that's because a person was raised that way that they 
shouldn't feel guilty about it and try to change it, just because it's 
ingrained in them and they can't help it? I know plenty of people that
come from very racist families thathave managed to overcome these
tendencies, even though they've been raised with them from day one.
   the reason people shouldn't label other people is because everyone's
so different! there's a lot of people that seem to fit right into
some stereotype at first, but as you get to know them they really don't.
maybe they just act like they do on the surface to fit into a group, i
don't know. But people are too complex to really fit into a labeled
group. if you're gonna label someone at least get to know them first.

oh, but you see, we have a miscommunication. when i say the way the mind
thinks, i'm toaling abou the actual physical functioning of the brain. The
mechanism of the left brain makes it label and classify. for
clarification, let me say that the way it classifies and labels is
changeable--certainly--but the fact that it does label and classify is
unchangeable. people should not feel bad about the fact they label, what
labels they give and the logic behind them.

i see... i guess you're right, people automatically put labels on
others, but i also thing that with a bit of practice and open-
mindedness you can overcome them. like you might unconsciously
label someone when you meet them, but then still keep an open
mind and make an effort to really get to know the persno, not just
dismiss them based on your labeling from that first impression.

yourselves open when you allow others to read and criticize your work.  I

i like constructive criticism.  i can handle just about anything when it 
comes to my writing.  if i get upset by a comment, then i
haven't distanced myself enough from my (dare I say it? yes I do) art.  
Eventually, we all have to let go of what we create, and I prefer to do it 
here, where I at least know most of the ppl who read the poetry base, as 
opposed to going to a writer's group where I don't know or trust anyone.  
As long as it's not an attack on ME, I can take it.

that's what I think anyhow....

Nothing personal, but most of the "criticism" that I've seen on the poetry

is O.K.  Writers want and need support; this board will give it to you,

Most people are a little shy about letting others see their work.  Fear of 
rejection is blamed mostly.  But exactly what IS rejection ?  Does it mean 
someone doesn't like your work ?  Well whoopy doo !  You can't please 
everyone.  What does it really matter if you get a couple of bad comments 
on it.  Most people here are polite enough that if they think it is utter 
shit they will just shut up, unless they wish to give some constructive 
criticism, which is not a bad thing.  It's not likely that anyone is gonna 
laugh and think you're a dickhead (or if they do they're not likely to say 
so).  Even if you post something which ppl don't think is great, atleast 
you had the guts to do so.  That earns a little respect in my book.

So lets cut the "I'm scared of rejection" crap.  Particularly on Yabbs, 
where you don't actually have to face the critics, it's NOT going to ruin 
your reputation/life.  The worst case scenario is not that bad.  So lets 
see what you have to post then ... I for one would be interested.

Naah, you'd be okay.
But I think that open reading and slams are a great way to blow off some 
steam, if the situation is one you feel comfortable. If not, than just 
writing and reading are enough, I guess. The important thing is the work.

Do you think there really is a heaven and a hell? i was thinking about 
that and wondering. And if there is a heaven, would it be such a great 
place to get into? I mean if everyone was good all the time, and heaven 
lasts for eternity, wouldn't thinks get rather dull?
also, different religions have different gods and names fro their 
gods...do you think all these gods are separate, different entities, or 
just one universal god with many different names?
the one thing that bothers me the most about my church is that the people 
there believe that the trinity is the only god and religion to believe in 
ad that everyone else is wrong and going to hell...but suppose it turns 
out that they were worshipping the wrong god all the time and instead of 
heaven wind up someplace very unpleasant.
i myself, i believe in some god, but not in church. the way i've always 
looked at it is if i believe in god and when i die i find out there's not 
a god, i'm no worse off. but if i don't believe in god and find out when 
i die that there is one....
also, what do you think owuld be better/worse, to die and end up in 
whatever heaven/ninvana/utopia etc, or to keep being reincarnated.

i personally can't imagine any place or any life that could be better or 
worse than this one.

just wondering and thinking out loud,

I don't think that believing that there is some being/force greater than
us is that difficult.  I do however believe that too many churches have
become corrupted in subtle ways, looking fro power permanance and most of
all the almighty $$$.  Look at how a schism is again forming between the
Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches, and importantly within the RC over
whether women can be ordeined.  And how many of the original founders of
various religions would be horrified over religious WARS fought in their 
name... God is great, humans are real flawed.

(but if i really wanted wealth, I'd start my own ministry ;)  like
 LRHubbard or the Bakkers)
,
as far as heaven or reincarnation: it depends on a lot.  Is heaven someone
else's idea of it or mine?  Harps and cloud-sitting would get real boring 
within an eon. But reincarnation also has its problems, like where do arll
the extra souls to make 5B people come from? or are there fake people?
...this hubris led to Hitler and the KKK. Of the tow, i'd prefer heaven, 
as
even my favorite shows are boring eventually. Can you imagine going

interesting questions...! the way i see it, most religions are more 
political organizations than religious. i mean, they all (or most) do a 
lot of good for society (soup kithens, social support, etc...) but i think
they sorta use "God" as a way to pull in people that normally wouldn't
be involved. almost like brainwashing, but to a good end. except in the
case of those evangelists that just have people send money to them! 
  personally, i think there is some "higher power", probably some 
combination of all the other religions, both mono- and polytheistic ones. 
but i don't really believe in a speceific idea of god or religion.
  and if that made any sense you're probably just as warped as me....

Well, I'm not a religious man, so don't quote me on this one, but the 
recent developments in the world socioeconomic/sociopolitical situation 
are (according to a local minister I heard on the radio) unfolding as 
prophesized in Revelations:  The coming together of the world powers, the 
abolition of currency (interac direct-payment), a sudden increase in 
earthquakes (there has been an almost geometric increase over the last 20 
years), and other stuff (I don't remember it all).  Also, the end is 
supposed to occur at an apparent time of prosperity, somewhere around the 
year 2000.  Also, Nostradamus predicted that the end of the world would 
come after a 7-year long war, so if the shit hits the fan and all hell 
breaks loose (pun DEFINITELY intended :))) ), we all have 7 years to shop 
around at ALL religions, praying like crazy in order to repent in all 
forms of worship.  If we do that, we'll be safe!

#1 Predeterminism
There are those who live their lives by the script, and those who rip that 
script apart, burn it, and shoot the director :)
But how do we know that we are gripping the controls of our lives, defying 
the the perhaps.. and I stress that word "PERHAPS", predetermined way of 
living our lives. Maybe it involves us making a high level state of 
awareness decision in what we do.. almost to the level of psychosis.. 
maybe... I don't know... who will ever know.. and those who say they know, 
whether they be religious, or government, or any other form of agency are 
just bullshitting, or bullshitting themselves too in the process of BS 
others...

So.. its like we're all flying by the seat of our pants.. well.. methinx 
I'm flying with my pants at my ankles   on this one hehehehe...um... same 
point of view.. sometimes we have control... other times we're butt naked 
as far as power is concerned. Ultimately we can never know... an' anyone 
who says otherwise needs brain surgery. 
 
But its okay to wonder an' guess, jus don' say "THIS IS WHY..." cuz ya 
wrong :)
(human beans don' have the brains to find the truth of these sortsa stuff 
out... is there a god, or a heaven etc... we cannot possibly know.. all we 
can do is speculate... an' those who yell in my face, "Jesus loves me and

    Yes.  Technically speaking, there are 4 orders of social behavior 
besides games.  (a) Rituals and ceremonies
                (b) Pastimes
                (c) Operations and maneuvers
            and (e) Intimacy
Games are classified as order (d).  

Mind games are distinct in having a predictable outcome, ulterior motives, 
and a dramatic payoff.  Check out some books by Eric Berne, M.D. if you 
want some very interesting reading about why people do things that seem 
only to hurt themselves and those that they care about.

    Well, they're not _designed_ to hurt people, but that is a side effect 
of quite a few of them.  Usually the outcome is fairly predictable, as the 
actions by the players are predictable.  However, if someone refuses to 
play, or uses the antithesis to the game, it can really surprise the 
players and throw the game off course.

hmmm. sometime i wonder tho, if those aren't enough. i guess not. i'm at 
the point where i'm just fed up with faith in anything...perhaps that's 
because i'm sick of getten awakened at 6 am every sunday morning to go to 
church. i don't agree with church and wish i was brave enough to tell 
that to my parents. i'm not, so i go to church and feel like a sell out.

yes, i know the feeling quite well....sometimes it can even make you feel 
trapped. seems like there ought to be something _more_ but it's just so 
darn to find...the romantics would say find it in love, the religious in 
God, and the humanists in yourself, but i question all three. :) all 3

well, here's my $.02 on religion and faith and its benefits....

I just got back from the funeral of my great uncle, who I loved very very 
much.  He had cancer, so we all knew death was imminent, and I did go see 
him in the hospital so I got a chance to tell him I loved him and to say 
goodbye (which I didn't get with my mother), so I'm okay about that.  But 
the funeral was Catholic.  My whole family is Catholic, with the exception 
of myself and my sister.  Me, I'mmore of a Gnostic than anythingelse, and 
my  sister is fundamentalist born again.  Now, when it comes to things 
like this, I don't know any of the rituals.  I can't BELIEVE what the 
priest is saying about eternal life in heaven, because i'm not real sure 
aboutthe next plane of existence (i'm an agnostic gnostic).  But I can see 
that there is some comfort in the ritual and tradtion of belonging to a 
specific church or faith.  I don't have that comfort in my life, and I'm 
just glad thatI am strong ennough not to need that kind of comfort.  
(Religion is the opiate of the masses, i know, i know)  But other ppl 
aren't as strong as I am, and I can see where religion/faith wopuld help 
them getthrough difficult periods in their lives.  it's just when they try 
to shove it down MY throat thatI get mad.

Ohhhh... nice question "How do you ever get more?" That's truly something 
to contemplate. I understand what you were saying and how that question 
was posed, and its a truly legit thing to think about... and it runs 
straight back into the question of whats the afterlife going to be like. I 
can't seriously believe that anyone could be content in the thought of 
it all being total darkness, a true end, nothing, black, buried in a box.
We HAVE to believe in something more, we HAVE to want something more. 
Otherwise what truly has been the point in our lives?? In essence what 
have we done all this time? Have we truly achieved NOTHING???
Is there anyone out there in this huge world, that is totally happy with 
their lives here on this planet, and who would not want more?
Maybe it comes down to us all being greedy pigs, take everything you can 
get.
So far, what I believe in is that everyone goes where they want to go when 
they die. You could look at it as finally being released from this body 
that inhibits us, and therefore you've got your soul, your imagination, 
and thats enough to create a billion different worlds with :) That's how I 
believe everyone gets their own - because we all have different minds and 
imagination.

Subject: Afterlife ?
Date: Tue Jun  7 22:55:10 1994

Terry Pratchett (in his book "Pyramids" I think) suggests the theory about 
the afterlife (somewhat similar to what Topi said), that the afterlife is 
whatever you imagine it to be.  If you imagine a heaven where you can 
catch up on old times with all your dead buddies and ancestors, then 
that's what you get.  If you imagine it to be nothing, then, for you, 
there is no afterlife.

This idea almost makes sense to me.  I think the only person/being capable 
of judging whether you have been good or bad in your life is you.  Hence, 
if you know you have led an evil life and you then suspect that you are 
going top hell, then to hell you go.  Whereas if you were nasty to ppl but 
always had good intentions despite outside appearances, then you may feel 
you should go to a "heaven" and off you go.

Just a thought on God/gods too.  If they do/did exist, then it makes sense 
that they are some sort of sentient being with an interest of sorts in us. 
We might have no idea what that interest is ... it may be far beyond 
mortal comprehension, but if they have an interest then it is almost 
undoubtably designed to benefit themselves in some way.  Therefore we 
humans are possibly being used, being farmed even, by these 
incomprehensible beings we call gods.

Please note that I am an atheist, and please direct all flames for my 
blasphemy to Steyr@gpo.swin.edu.au  :)  :)

Ummm ... just one more thing.  If we have an afterlife, what about other 
animals.  Do cats have a heaven ?  Do leeches go to hell ?  WHat about 
plants ?  They're alive too.

Oh well.  I know what my heaven/nirvana/uTOPIa is.
And I know exactly how to get there.  (About 45mins by train :)

i agree, and that's why i have such a problem with organized religions. 
many of them are just too darn judgemental...god loves everyone but he 
loves some people more that others sort of thing. a person can go 
through all the motions of being "good" and have bad intentions in 
their minds and vice versa.

i wonder...if perhaps maybe there's a half way point betewwn hell and 
heaven. i for one would much rather stay where i am than end up sitting 
on a cloud or being barbecued in a pool of fire and brimstone.

hmm i had a discussion with my dad about this once. he says that animals 
can't go to heaven because they don't have souls. i disagree with this. i 
think every living thing has a soul and if "heaven" or whatever you want 
to call it is a place one gets into as a reward for being good...seems to 
me people will have a much harder time getting in that anything else. :)
leeches going to hell? nah, they just act on their instinct to survive, 
but human leechs are another story. :)

What explanation would you give to the phenomena commonly termed as 
'ghosts'... 

don't get me wrong, I'm jus like Natalie on my viewpoint towards 
religions... but the thing that fascinates me, is what if when we cark it, 
some of us get to float around an' watch life go on without us... an' 
occassionally we can affect that reality...?

Ofcourse hollywood has done heaps of stuff about ghosts in that situation, 
and largely I think it's all shit...  but just as food for thought, 
wouldn't it be kewl, provided that you were not alone, because that's 
probly my biggest fear of the possibilities of an afterlife...


And that also leads me to Steyr'swords...> Terry Pratchett (in his book 
"Pyramids" I think)

If such an afterlife is true, then it suggests that our minds belong to a 
higher realm, to retain its own self consciousness beyond the body, and 
the physical/spiritual plane... it's suggesting that we ourselves are 
gods, thus enabled to create our own universe within our "dead" 
imaginations.  If you expect a certain reality or consciousness beyond 
death, then your mind will kick in when you're due an' grant that to 
you... hmmm... is that not godly? (keep in mind this is not a religious 
arguement I'm expanding on here...)

Although what I do find disturbing with Pratchett's theory is that the 
afterlife you're experiencing is false, the people, or the environs is all 
but "a figment of your imagination" and essentially you are alone... that 
scares the shit out of me, because you still cease to exist... no one else 
to acknowledge your existence in the greater fabric of consciousness...

There's way too much variation in the speculation of what is to come in

Who knows? Who wants to know?
What exactly keeps us living this life, when all the stories of an 
afterlife seem so much fun, and so much more appealing? Maybe we haven't

Here's a beautiful little story for yous :

"Once upon a time, twin boys were conceived in the same womb. 
Weeks passed, and the twins developed. As their awareness grew,
they laughed fore joy: "Isn't it great that we were conceived?
Isn't it great to be alive?"
Together the twins explored their world. When they found their
mother's cord that gave them life, they sang for joy: "How great
is our mother's love that she shares her own life with us!"
As weeks stretched into months the twins noticed how much each
was changing. "What does it mean?" asked the one. "It means
that our stay in this world is drawing to an end," said the other 
one. "But I don't want to go,"said the other one. "I want to stay 
here always." "We have no choice," said the other. "But maybe there is 
life after birth!" "But how can there be?" responded the one.
"We will shed our life cord, and how is life possible without it?
Besdies, we have seen evidence that others were here before us, and none 
of them have returned to tell us that there is life after birth. No, this 
is the end."
And so the one fell into deep despair, saying: "If conceptions ends in 
birth, what is the purpose of life in the womb? It's meaningless!
Maybe there is no mother after all." "But there has to be," protested
the other. "How else did we get here? How do we remain alive?"
"Have you ever seen our mother?" said the one. "Maybe she lives
only in our minds. Maybe we made her up because the idea made us feel 
good."
And so the last days in the womb were filled with deep questioning and 
fear. Finally, the moment of birth arrived.
When the twins had passed from their world, they opened their eyes and 
they cried. For what they saw exceeded their fondest dreams.

just a bunch of (kinda) random thoughts....
  - cool story topi! i never thought of it that way.... there was a news 
show on last night about near death experiences (NDE's) and scientists 
were
saying that it's all physiological - the "light at the end of the tunnel" 
effect is because the brain is running out of oxygen and that's causing 
neurons to fire off randomly, exciting more and more of the optical nerves 
so that a big spot of white light (all colors of the spectrum) appears in 
the center of the eyes and gets bigger... the feeling of comfort and love 
is because of endorphins (natural opiates your body produces in times of 
stress or pain, and death is definitely one of those times!)... and they 
were able to induce an out of body experience by electrically stimulating 
a certain part of someone's brain, and this could happen in an NDE because 
of the random firings of neurons... just a different view...

  - if different stimuli can change (at least temporarily) a person's 
intelligence and creativity (beethoven has been shown to do this) and 
other's reduce it (getting drunk/stoned)  what would happen if (these are 
actual situations me and my friends have been in and wondered about ): you 
get stoned and then play chess; listen to punk rock and play chess; listen 
to beethoven after watching stupid TV sitcoms... i guess it all balances 
out huh?

  never mind i dunno what i'm talking about.

    If _you_ notice yourself, then you must still exist there.  But all of 
the other people passing around you might not.  You can imagine other 
people, but you can't imagine yourself because _something_ must exist to 
do the imagining.  At least, that's the way I imagine that it works.  :>

    Perhaps the entire material/physical plane is just a collective 
hallucination that we, as astral beings (collections of thought), have 
created to relieve the boredom, ease communication, and to flex our mental 
muscles.

Buzz, ya wrote somethin' like this methinx:

> but if they could walk through walls why didn't they fall
through the floors??????

ok, now we all know that ST:TNG had a limited time per episode to pack 
everything in... so they cannot possibly successfully achieve yer 
suspension of disbelief in a totality... an' it's hollywood soo.. hehe


but here's another theory fer ya ta munch on...

Assuming that ghosts do exist or "out-of-phasing" etc an' that they were 
able to walk through walls and other obstruction that would impede 
movemnet in normal circumstances, but do not fall through the floor...

This can be explained by Hard Deck Consciousness ( no ref's, I jus thought 
the idea awhile ago when I was writing a story on afterlife ).
HDCis applied whn the entity, who has lived a lifetime, expecting hard 
ground to be under them, and gravity to keep them there... can go on in an 
environment that does not accommodate normal hard ground... i.e. yer a 
ghost or non-matter consciousness, and still benefit from a simulation of 
ground, as provided by the mind. To look at one of the closest examples of 
HDC.. we can watch the motion picture "Ghost", which partially 
demonstrates theories of mind over matter, in which our protagonist, must 
unlearn his previous consciousness experiences in order to jump through 
doors, moving trains, and beat up his best buddy. His mind was so used to 
having the normal limitation of our material being that when he lost his 
meat, the mind refused to adapt, until it was forced to.

However Hard Deck Consciousness is not only applicable with yer everyday 
friendly sppok or star trek character... but also has some real life 
applications, especailly notable in Space Transportation. 

In a few centuries time, (provided that we are still around) human kind 
will no longer be bound to their planet, ad will be able to colonize space 
and the greatr system. Sure this all sounds fantasy, and what does it have 
to do with HDC? Well, if modern speculative fiction is as close as it is 
t what will be, then you will have vessels that will support thousands of 
people, shipping them across the commercial and government lanes from 
colony to colony..etc etc.. what this also means it that without some form 
of artificial gravity, you'll have heaps of people floating around 
endlessly. HDC enables the future travellers to use their minds to trick 
them to sticking to the floor. All because you expect it to happen...

Ok, please treat this as a piece of speculative fiction, I'm not in any 
way advocating that HDC is a reality now, or later... however, after 
studying paranormal papers and texts, you may come across instances where 
people have defied gravity while in a trance... (i.e. returned soviet 
cosmonauts regressed back to a mission, floating unaided from their seats 
as observed by camera, and researchers present during the sessions)

chew on it,... an enquiring mind is healthy :)

entertaining... though the question is, does he get Dana Scully to bed?

XFiles is one of the few tv shows worth watching... one time i was 
watching it, it was the episode where this doctor was making alien/human 
hybrids and one escaped, and he was stopped by the cops for a traffic 
violation or something, and got away by jumping off a bridge into water 
and he could breathe under water etc etc etc.... but anyway right after 
the show was over, there was an ad for the news coming up where there was 
an 18 hour manhunt in progress for a guy that was stopped for a minor 
traffic violation and ran off into the woods... !

I have to agree that the old "twilight Zone" episodes were the sharpest 
thing on TV.  I especially liked the ones written by Rod Serling.  He 
could tell a story and then give it just the right twist at the end.  I 
know it sounds a bit cliche, but it was kin of like a roller coaster ride 
with a final drop so you would talk about it later.  Some really nice 
touches in his stories.  He had a vivid imagination.

The better of works done in horror, or supernatural are the ones that are 
not so contrived (<- that's the word I was looking for) as some of the 
stuff that airs today, i.e. Xfiles.. which depends too much on government 
plots and the determination that THIS is a supernatural occurance... 
hehehe, jus ask Mulder - a friggin fart in an elevator is some paranormal 
event, an insertion of alien influence, or a pyrotechnic who's lost 
his/her spark with only the gas remaining..

Twilight zone kicks ass...

Just a thought ...

What is there after the afterlife ?  Or does the afterlife last eternally 
?

If so ... wouldn't it get boring after a while ?

Afterall ... who wants to live forever whether it's in some sort of 
nirvana 
or not.

Or perhaps this IS the afterlife ... and this life is our own personal
heaven or hell depending on what we make of it.

Does anyone here believe in reincarnation on this earth ?  Perhaps as a 
different caste or even a different life form depending on how "well" you 
performed in your last life.

Or maybe "life" is just a whole bunch of electrical impulses and chemical
reactions, and when we die the electricity dissapates into some other form 

of energy and the pysical side of us just decomposes.  Perhaps there is no
"soul", no "God/gods/godesses", no "afterlife", no "reincarnation".

Perhaps a bleak outlook ... but why does there HAVE to be something after
death ?

Ok, so this topic has pretty much been done to death already (is there an
afterlife for topics/ideas ?) and I guess there's no solid answers to all

You see, lucky, like all leprechauns, is a weak willed fool afraid to use 
his power as it should be used. For example, the trix rabbit, a sapient 
rodent of immense size and intelligence, is ostracized and humiliated over 
and over again, yet does he breed and form a massive army of hisown 
fertile brood? No. He takes it like a simp.

no dialog or anything, about this guy that gradually turns into a machine

background
music, and it's all in B&W... he's just going through his every day life

these wires and tubs start pushing through his skin, from the inside!

Man, you guys/gals have to meet my family.  Especially my old man.
We've all got tatoos (mom,dad,sister,me) and worship harleys. heheee

My old man takes the cake though.  I went home last year and saw
a wooden cross and some flowers behind the house.  I asked mom: "did one
of the cats die?".  "Nope", she said, "your dad like to go up to the graveyard
on his bike and dig through the trashcans".  He rides his bike with no shirt,
no socks, boots, cutoff shorts, and a suit vest.  He buys suit vests at yard
sales all of the time.  His hat is a ballcap with the bill cutoff.  I asked
him why he did that and he said the wind kept blowing it off.  I asked why
he didn't just wear it backwards and he said:  "yeah right.  I'd look like
one of those punk kids on Hondas".

I talked to him on the phone last fall and he was pissed off.  He said
that all of the leaves had fallen off of the trees and he could see our
'neighbors' porch light (one mile away).  He was getting ready to shoot it out
because he felt 'closed in'.  He's got a patched together chinese military
issue rifle that he uses to shoot groundhogs in the hayfield from the porch.
The man is my god:  I worship him unconditionally.

Mom's a refugee from Catholic school and if anyone gives her a bottle of
wine as a present, she mixes it with a slushed Boones Farm and goes for a walk 
along the railroad tracks.  I called her from school 6 years ago when I was a
freshman and she asked me:  "are you studying alot?".  I said some, but that
I'd been skipping my 8:00 Chem class because we were getting drunk 5 or 6 
nights a week and that my GPA was going to shit.  She said:  "Well, just
remember to have fun and not to study too hard.  If you study too hard you'll
just burn yourself out."  My mommy kicks ass.  She's the shit.

My sister follows The Dead now.  Not exclusively, but damn near.
She was voted Prom Queen in High School and tripped and fell down the stage
stairs drunk off of her ass at the dance when they anounced the candidates.  
She said she didn't even remember any of it nor did she care to.  Her airforce
cargo plane also hauled one of those released Iranian hostages (can't remember
the name) back to Germany.  They got hammered on the way to Germany as he
kept babbling about how long it had been since he had seen a woman.  I've 
seen her drink men 5 times her size under the table.  My little sis rules.

Sorry, guess I'm just getting homesick.  I do tend to brag them up
sometimes (though that is all true).  What can I say, they're the coolest
and most eccentric people I know.  Hmmmm, why did I write all of this?  Oh
well, talk to you all in chat.

During my senior year, after the winter musical (well, fallish), the 
cast and crew took a trip out to this cool overgrown cemetary outside 
princeton.  lots of fun the first night (when three of us hid inside 
and waited for the others), but not the second time (when i got a

If you guys think the last one was too tame, try this one:

During Christmas Dinner, when they wheel out whatever the feast is going 
to be, and this works best if it is a meat of some kind, scream "My former 
bretheren of Life! I will save YOU!" Throw the meat dish in question as 
hard as you can at the Childrens table, screaming "BUTCHERS! SANTA IS A 
MYTH! SANTA MURDERED THIS (Fill in animal species)! I HATE CHRISTMAS! FUCK 
THE ELVES!" and collapse in a heap, sobbing uncontrollably.

 Graveyards are great fun, I even had the pleasure of working in them for
a few years. I sandblasted the dates of death on the stones. Great job,
really, no one to complain, pretty areas, that solemn feeling. Might have
been my best job yet. I got to see a lot of different graveyards that way.
 Speaking of mind games, I worked quite a few bizzare stories out of my
experiences. I usually freaked out everyone around me at school. They were
convinced I was some sort of psychopath. I always dueled out the exact
opposite of what was expected of me. I would scream at people who 
complimented me and thank those who insulted. I even hit on a homophobe
once just to watch his squirm. 
 Fun days.

did you know that everytime you sneeze your heart stops for a second and 
when that happens you kill a brain cell? i have a friend that's studying 
medicine and he told me that...i wonder...if you got near something that 
you were allergic too and you kept sneezing and sneezing if you could 
make yourself brain dead...what a weird way to die, sneezing to death.

i think the scariest way to die would be if you fell into a hole cut in 
the ice in the winter and couldn't get out, or if you were diving and got 
your foot stuck and couldn't free it. i think it would be kinda neat to 
spontaneously combust though...does anyone know how that works? i've 
always kinda wondered...it would be kinda cool if you could make 
something else combust by thinking about it...or to make anything happen

mean and tried to set it on fire.... it burned for a few seconds and as 
soon as the alcohol had burned off it stopped burning... the meat was only 
slightly charred.. nothing like spontateous combustion (i.e. there's 
nothing left but ash...) and besides that, you'd have a heart attack from 
too much alcohol _long_ before you got enough alcohol in you to cause you 
to become flammable...

A friend of mine came up with this tripped out theory on spontaneous 
combustion  it goes something like this.....
        90% of your body heat escapes through your head
       humans use only 10% of their brain power
therefore if you ever end up using 100 % of your brain power..the amount 
of heat that it would create for mthe chemical reactions involved in theat 
many thought processes + the great amount of your body heat escaping 
throuhg yur head you would spontaneously combust

well we can tell i'm not using even 10% of my brain power at this moment 
cause then my typing wouldn't suck so bad...but any way that was his 
theory

i was in this funky new age store and they were selling rubber brains and 
eyeballs and such in one section and for the display they had this mannequin
with no arms and her hair in curlers dressed in white laying on a bed 
with all the eyeballs and stuff as well as some coloring anatony books 
all over the bed. it looks really neat.

they also had this room set up with all sorts of bug stuff, like bug jars 
and bug hand puppets (the ant and cockroach ones were really cool) and 
they had a live tarantula....

and another one set up with glow in the dark stuff and lava lamps and 
once with the pop art stuff like warhol and another one set up like a 
jungle. there were hardly any lights in the place and it was kinda creepy 
but really really cool at the same time. lots of toys to play with. i'll 
show it to you, you'd like it. the whole place was one big visual mind 
game..set up to make people feel uncomfortable..wish there were more 
stores like that around

ken with a blond afro which looked completely ridiculous

beat up on his hero? tho i bet it was funny as hell..kinda mean tho. why 
is it that everyone hates barney (me included) but no one seems to

Gee, and I guess barby dolls don't really help the

I guess that means (to the woe of millions of little kids) that Barby is

Naah.  Barby DOES have a real, practical use.  She's good for keeping 
pesky, annoying little kids out of their mothers hair for a while.

*Ouch*  !!  A thought just hit me ...

Perhaps Barby is the main driving force behind womens liberation !  Little 
kids grew up with a Barby that could do all these wonderful things (had 
her own car/mansion/man-slave(Ken)), and then when the kids grew up, they 
wanted to be just like Barby - i.e. have a high powered executive job 
instead of staying at home as the old fashioned faithful housewife.

Still ... I don't remember there ever being an Air Force Pilot Barby.

When I was growing up, around the age of 14/15, there was a group of us 
girls sitting around and dreaming about what wonderful riches we would 
have when we "grew up". It was the usual thing, a HUGE house, servants, 
lots of clothes and jewels etc..... 
One of my friends pointed out how we would have to set out to find 
ourselves rich husbands to provide all this for us. It was at this moment 
(and due to some recent letdowns in my young life), that I decided that I 
was NOT going to rely on someone else to provide for all my wants. That 
the only way I was going to be assured of getting what I wanted, was to go 
out and get it for myself. So thats when I knew I had to get a good, rich 
job. Thats why I'm going to be an engineer.(well, not All the reasons..)
The thing is, that was a crucial turning point in my life, something 
snapped, and it all happened within this on minute and I completely 
remember it all. I just wondered if anybody else has had any experiences 
like that, and of what has motivated the rest of you into doing what you 
are doing at the moment, or have chosen to do in your futures.

when i was little, my favorite things were animals and books. i used to 
want to be a veteranarian until a) i volunteered at the vet's and burst 
into tears whenever something had to be put to sleep, b)went to hs and 
discovered my mathematical and scientific abilities were non-existant and 
c)went to a blood drive and found out i faint at the sight of blood...that 
ruled out being a vet, so i thought about what kind of career i could have 
with books and decided i would teach them. people also facinate me so i 
thought being a teacher would be a good idea and here i am, going into my 
second year of studying english and education at uvm...well that's about

I just thought of an importan turning point in my life though.  Why I want 
to be a nuclear physicist:

When I was about 11/12 I got really sick (never knew what it was) and I 
was in bed for about two or three months.  During that time, I got into 
reading lots of books.  Well I was looking for the word elephant in the 
encyclopedia and found the word electron on the way.  I read up on it and 
was intantly facinated.  

And adult friend of mine gave me a copy of "A Brief History of Time," a 
then newly released book by Stephen Hawking and told me that it was 
designied for the layman to understand.  I read it and understood nothing. 
 At that point, I decided tthat I will learn it all
Hence, my field of study

i did computer science because it was something i enjoyed doing and it just

enough to make me consider majoring in it was photography, but that never
happened...i can't even minor in it at carnegie mellon (probably good anyway).

now i get sick of computers a lot of the time :)

anyway, how many people out there have chosen their major based on the 
money that it will bring them in the future.  does money really matter enough
to base a career on?  i mean, can the difference between comfortable and rich
really make ones life a lot happier?

poor + happy > rich + lonely

Hmm.. Well, I guess you could say that I decided what I was going to do 
when I was about 10. I've always been fascinated with the way things work,
and how to make them work better. When I was 10, I got my first _real_
computer (ie not a commiedore :) and it truly fascinated me. Since then, I 
have endeavoured to learn all that I could about computers, both hardware 
and software. Now I know a heck of a lot more than I did then, although I 
still don't know at least twice as much as I DO know, and I'm not really 
sick of 'puters yet. My problem, however, is that I'm also interested in a 
few hundred other things, some of them almost as much as I'm interested in 
'puters. For instance, I got a 5 on the AP English test as easily as I
did on the Comp. Science test... It makes deciding what I really want to 
do in life a bitch, but I think for now at least I'll stay with 'puters.

of course i had transformers..they're more than meets the eye. :) i had 
soundwave..he was really cool...he turned into a tape deck and he came 
with "tapes" that transformed into a cat and a bird. i had the blue and 
red voltron lions..which kinda sucked since all i could make was a foot 
and an arm..not the whole voltron. so :P

off barbie at her place, and the next day barbie'd be 9 months preggers...

i'm an english major cause that's all i'm really good at...well, actually, 
i'm damned good at biology, but you have to take a lot of math to get a 
degree in that and i suck at math, so...but books are my first love.  i've 
been reading since iwas 3 years old...i remember when i was 5 and 
discovered nancy drew and the bobbsey twins.  i was in heaven...i went 
through a nother epiphany of that sort when i was in high school
and discovered sci fi...especially robert heinlein.  it's kind of funny 
tho...my reading is really varied...i don't have a lot of depth in any one 
area...i've read a medieval stuff, renaissance stuff, the romantics, yeats 
(of course), and a lot of genre writing...i managed to completely skip the 
enlightenment ad the victorians...the thing about my interest in sci fi is 
weird tho...i always hated it until i was in 9th grade and we were camping 
one weekend, and it was raining, and i had finished all the books i had 
brought with me (jean auel books if i remember right).  the only thing 
left to read was some sci fi that my dad was reading.  so i read it (cause 
if i get bored enough i'll read anything) and was hooked....

I have always been fascinated with the technical, for many reasons. For 
one, I've been using computers since I was 5 or so. It didn't take me long 
to realize I knew more than my parents about computers, and
to realize I knew more than my parents about these machines. This gave me 
a certain power... maybe that's why I love computers. Those who are in the 
know have the power. I still feel a sense of pride when I hack out a good 
snatch of code. 

I was well on my way to CS or ECE, but then I was asked to do sound for a 
school theatre production, and that was it. I got hooked into the theatre. 
It allowed me to do technical work, but in addition to the pride I get 
when I do a good design, I also get the rush of a live production. Though 
I know I am probably be dirt poor for a long time after I graduate, I'm 
not concerned. Ht said it well with poor+happy > rich+unhappy.

walk into a room full of people (like the newspaper office at your local

walk up to them, rub your head (its best if you use the top of your head
rather than, say, your nose which would make this a much more disgusting
trick) against their shoulder and make purring noisess.

walk out ... don't say a word

Its even better if your friend knows this is going to happen and just smiles

peter,
My friend does something similar, though not in any affectionate way.....

The guy doesn't like to study, or at least, not when everyone else does.  
He walks into random rooms, usually people he knows, stands in the 
doorway, and stares at the rooms occupants for, oh, a good 15-20 seconds.  
Usually he says nothing, sometimes he says, "just wanted to see how y'all 
were doing."  Sometimes he comes in laughing, stops cold in the doorway, 
stops laughing and stares, for a few seconds, then as he leaves begins his 
maniacal laughing again.  Very strange guy, don't you agree?

Sort of a similar question, here goes...

A man has been shot, not by his own hand.  He is in a room alone, just a 
bullet through his head.  There is one door, double locked from the 
inside.  The window is also shut, and is too small for a man to crawl 
through it.  The only item in the room is a broken pencil.
What happened?

Haven't figured the other murder problem out yet...

OK.  You are kissing you wife on the 28th floor, and then - you leave.
This is an everyday job - you're married!
However, on the next following day, you kiss her goodbye and while
travelling to the lobby via elevator, it stops: on the 7th floor.
You know automatically that you wife is dead.  You job is to figure
out how.

A police officer saw a truck driver clearly going the wrong way down a 
one-way street, but did not try to stop him.  Why not?

When this book came out it was read by a handful of very rich people.  Now 
almost everyone has a copy and frequently reads it.  But you cannot buyt 
it in a bookstore or borrow it from a library.  What is it?

A woman walked up to a man behind a counter and handed him a book.  He 
looked at it and said,  "That will be four dollars and fifty cents."  She 
paid the man and then walked out without the book.  He saw herleave 
without it but did not call her back.  How come?

OK, I think this one's relatively easy, as a lot of you may have heard
it before, but here goes:
    A man is found hanged in a room. The only thing in the room is a
pool of water at his feet. The room has only one door, which is locked 
from the inside - this is the only entrance. The noose he is hanging by
is too high for the man to have reached from the ground. How did he die?

     Whaddaya think? too easy? I may have heard this one off TV, in which 
case you probably all know the answer.

Was just wondering if anyone has some insanely funny jokes.

I have two old favourites that crack me up everytime, but they're pretty 
stupid really and I'm about the only person in the world who finds them 
funny.  And don't I feel like a dick when I tell a joke and everyone just 
stares at me blankly.

The first of them is short and simple ....
    Q.  Why did the koala fall out of the tree ?
    A.  Because it was dead.

*takes a break to roll around on the floor laughing*

The second is quite a long joke, and needs to be drawn out for it's 
impact.  So to tell that one I'll spread it over several posts, with a 
small time gap between each post.  Here goes ...

There's a really rich man named Fred, who has a single child.  A son named 
Jim.  Now Fred is filthy rich and promised himself that as his son grew 
up, Jim would have anything and everything his little heart desired.  By 
the time he was 6 years old, Jim had all the toys imaginable for a young 
boy.  His father had run out of imagination for things to get him and his 
7th birthday was in a few days.  So Fred went up to his son, and said 
"Jim, I have no idea what to get you, so just tell me what you want and 
it's yours.  Absolutely anything you want, just name it."  Jim thinks 
about this for a little while, and says "Dad, I know this sounds a little 
strange, but I've thought about it, and all I want for my birthday is ..."

                (Continued next post - probably tomorrow)

"All I want for my birthday is a single pink golf ball".  Jim's
father looked at him in shock and said "Son !  You can have anything
you want.  Anything at all !  And all you want is a pink golfball ?"
Jim replied "Yes dad, all I want is a single pink golfball.".
 
A few days later, Jim's birthday rolls around, and Fred presents his
son with a brightly wrapped gift which turns out to be a pink 
golfball.  Jim jumped up and down excitedly, and thanked his dad 
profusely, then ran to his room.  A short while later, all sorts
of strange thumps and groans could be heard coming from his room.
The pink golfball was never seen again.
 
Time passed, and Christmas came around.  Again, stuck for ideas, Fred
asked his son what he would like for Xmas.  Jim said "Dad, that pink
golfball you got me was REALLY great, but it didn't last as long as I'd
hoped.  Do you think you could get me TWO pink golfballs for Xmas ?"
After a brief discussion, Fred conceeded and went off to purchase two
pink golfballs for his son's Xmas gift.  Xmas day came around and Jim
unwrapped his two pink golfballs, and immediately ran to his room where
mysterious thumps, bangs, crashes, and groans could soon be heard.

The next year, young Jim's 8th birthday came around, and sure enough,
he requested more pink golfballs.  "Dad," he said, "This year, it
would be really really REALLY great if you could get me FOUR pink
golfballs."  Jim's birthday came around and four pink golfballs
were given to Jim.  Christmas rolled around yet again, and (on request)
Jim got EIGHT pink golfballs.  For about two days after Xmas, Jim
did not emerge from his room, locking himself in and ignoring his
father knocking on the door when various thumps, crashes, groans
and the occasional muffled scream could be heard.
 
More years passed, and Jim only ever requested more and more pink
golfballs.  "Dad, 20 pink golfballs please", "Dad, 50 this year if
you REALLY want to make me a happy child", "Oh sweetest father of
all fathers, I will love you forever if you get me 100 pink
golfballs".  After each birthday or Xmas, Jim disappeared and did
SOMETHING with the balls, involving many bangs, thumps, crashes,
tinkling of broken glass, groans, laughter, barely supressed screams,
and something that resembles a very quiet air raid siren.
 
Eventually, Fred (Jim's father) was overwhelmed by curiosity, and crept 
into Jim's room while the boy was at school one day ...

Fred crept into his son's room and found everything in perfect
order.  Nothing was smashed or broken, there were no dead bodies
laying around, nothing.  Not even a single pink golfball of the
hundreds that Jim had been given.
 
Another year passed, and Jim only ever asked for more and more
pink golfballs.  100, 200, 500, 1000 pink golfballs !!!  And as
always, Jim locked himself in his room and for days, all that could
be heard from him was bangs, crashes, choking sounds, laughter,
screams, moderated air raid sirens, and now something that closely
resembles silenced gun shots.
 
When Jim next emerged from his room, he came to his father and said,
"Dad, where do they make these pink golfballs ?".  Fred told his son
that the golfballs came from a factory in Saudi Arabia and that he
had to deal directly with the factory since he had been buying bulk.
Jim said "Dad, can we please please please PLEASE go visit this
factory ? PLEEEEEASE !".  Fred had nothing better to do that weekend,
so on Saturday morning the two of them boarded his private Leer jet
and took off for Saudi Arabia ...

Fred and his sone Jim are flying over Saudi Arabia, in Fred's private
Leer jet, on the way to the pink golfball factory.  Suddenly the jet
engine chokes, whines, and dies.  The jet spirals to the ground and
*BOOM*, it crashes in the middle of the desert.  The pilot and co-pilot
are killed instantly, but miraculously Fred and Jim survive.
 
Battered and bruised, the two set off over the desert to try and reach
civilisation.  The scorching hot sun beats down on them, then a freezing
cold night sets in.  Another day begins as they trudge over the endless
sand dunes.  Soon the heat becomes too much and the pair collapse in
exhaustion.  "Dad ...", Jim wheezes, "I ... *choke* ... don't think I
can go on much ... *wheeze* ... longer.".  Jim pauses to catch his 
breath.  "Dad, I think *cough* ... I'm going to die".  Fred cries out
"NO !!!  Son, please, tell me before you die, what did you want all
those pink golfballs for and what the hel did you do with them ?"

harm in telling you now.  My master plan won't ever get completed now

following on from what Topi said ...

Perhaps we could all (or many of us) agree on a good bbs which we could 
migrate to, so we could easily keep in contact with one another.  I for 
one would like to still be able to talk to many of you now and then, and 
if I know which BBS you'll be on, I'll sure be there too.

Date: Thu Aug 25 19:57:00 1994

OK.  For all you that haven't figured it out or guessed it properly,
here's the answer.

The hospitalized spouse was laying in bed with a EMS hooked to the
body.  If there is no electricity, there is no life.  And for all
of you who would think along the lines of a battery pack: unless
your awareness is hightened on each and every occasion of bad
occurences, there would be a slim chance of connecting to a "battery
pack" unit to sustain the victim in time.  If ever tried, remember
that it might cause more harm than good.  Sorry it took so long
to answer.

And now, for our GRAND PRIZE winner (the guy who got it first):

On September 27, pick up your all expense - paid meal at the
Subway address mentioned in E-Mail.  You earned it!

And yall thought AK came short of the game plan.  Next joke!

I was just thinking ... I wonder what happens to anyone that was
in one of these weird net-relationship things where their only
means of contact was via yabbs.  Yabbs closing down would really
be messing with their mind, particularly if one of them didn't have
an email site or anything.  But I guess you have to have a messed
up mind in the first place to be in a "relationship" with someone 
you've never met and are never likely to meet.

We will hopefully find out.  We're gonna try and get a copy of the base of 
Alex after yabbs goes down.  And who knows ... if Death brings up his own 
yabbs, maybe he can get the bases of Alex and continue from where we left 
off :)
