Yes, but which is which?

A beaver dam is technically technology... for beavers. The beaver's don't do 
studies to see the enviromental impact of their dams, they just build them 
because they need 'em. Human dams, on the other hand, are built for much the 
same purpose, but are (today, anyway) built with an eye on what it will do to 
the surrrounding ecology.

Does your child love you because it chooses to, or because of the fact that

And what is love, anyway? :)

Well you also have to take into account the other natural chemicals released 
by your brain and body during a trip.  I'm speaking hypothetically since I
don't know all of the chemicals, but if a chemical is secreted from your
system as a result of taking the LSD, and that second chemical will cause
flashbacks, then I'd have to say that flashbacks are indeed a direct result
of LSD usage.  

 And something I do know for fact, I trip has nothing whatsoever to with
LSD, a trip is caused by the chemicals released from the brain as a result
of taking the lsd.  Lsd actually leaves the brain minutes after it enters,
the remaining effects are caused soley by the brain's own chemicals, not by
the LSD itself.  The LSD is more of a trigger.  That's part of the reason
why they say LSD is so safe to use, it isn't in your brain that long, the
trip is simply a result of the LSD triggering a release of chemicals in your 
brain.

Syd was tripping almost constantly. And it wasn't entirely his fault.
Back in those days friends would give him food and drinks laced with acid
as an everyday occurance. He'd simply be taking acid constantly.
It certainly didn't help when his sanity was on the way out in the first
place. The LSD simply quicked the process.

Nature and Technology are **NOT** (as some people seem to believe) opposites.
The Goddess made us humans capable of making technology. We are part of
nature. Our technological creations are just as much a part of nature as a
beaver dam or a termite mound.
However, we are also among the small group of the Goddess' children who have
the capacity to choose our actions based on our moral judgements. It IS most
emphatically our responsibility to use our technology RESPONSIBLY.
Nothing is intrinsically good or evil. We can only judge by what results we
observe. Industry that creates toxic wastes that give our children cancer is
"evil". But industry that creates non-polluting solar panels out of recycled
materials is "good".
And I'm not going to give up my techie-toys without a struggle! :)

From what I've been reading lately about LSD, had he had the right setting and

How do you know that your friends were experiencing flashbacks when they
killed themselves? Did you communicate with them by some kind of telepathy
right before they did it? And believe me, LSD is a LOT less dangerous than
speed or meth. It's nonaddictive and it doesn't "change your chromosomes" or
any of that other bullshit. And flashbacks are easy to bear. After the initial
shock you realize what it is and wait it out.

For every medical report you show me that says LSD is bad for the body, I can
find one that will tell you it has no harmful lasting effects on the body.
There's no way to truly be sure from reading about it, the only sure fire way
to know for yourself what it does is to go get yourself a chemistry degree and
research it yourself.

Medical Journal as put out by WHOM?  The Guv tends to say it'll fuck your
genes, melt your brain..err..sorry...FRY your brain (as evidenced by the egg
commercial...<grin>), and other things too horrible to mention.

On the other hand, Dr. Leary CURED 90% of the repeat offenders (violent
offenses no less!) completely by using Shroom-Pills, and later found the same
benefits of LSD.

Care to quote the journal you're talking about?  The two camps are quite
opposed on the subject, and until further studies on the subject are made
legal, it'll remain an intellectual argument...
