SOME INFO ON RINGBACK FROM THE
BSP'S.... (BSP 975-120-100) THE
RINGBACK SIGNAL IS APPLIED BY AN
OPERATOR AT A SWITCHBOARD OR TSPS
POSITION BY OPERATING A RINGING KEY.
THE RINGBACK SIGNAL SENT OVER THE TRUNK
MAY UTILIZE 20 HZ RINGING, AN ON-HOOK
WINK, A GATE OPENING ON-HOOK WINK
FOLLOWED BY MF TONES, OR IN MODERN TSPS
ARRANGEMENTS, BY A TRAIN OF FIVE ON-
HOOK WINKS.
... THE MF TONE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT
IS LISTED IN ANOTHER TABLE AS 700+1700
HZ. SOMETHING NEW TO ADD TO YOUR BOX
IF YOU CAN GET THIS TO WORK. ALSO,
SOME OTHER INTERESTING MF USAGE IN
REGARDS TO PHONE BOOTHS:  SAME
SITUATION AS WITH RINGBACK (I.E. WINK
ON LINE) BUT: 700+1100 HZ (BLUE BOX
"2") - COIN COLLECT 1100+1700 HZ (BLUE
BOX "KP") - COIN RETURN MIGHT TRY THIS
SOMETIME TO GET YOUR COIN BACK. LOOKS
LIKE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO FLASH THE
SWITCH HOOK, THEN FIRE THE TONE IN.
LET ME KNOW IF IT WORKS (BSP'S ARE
SOMETIMES A PAIN TO INTERPRET)

you'd post it here. My college's dumb

Subj: METROFONE


Look out everyone out there using
Metrofone right now:

ZIf you've ben reading magazines or
newspapers lately, you will notice
Metrofone's ad for Residential
customers. They haven't done that
before since it was always for bus
customers... One thing to look out for
- residential customer tend to lookout
for their bills and reports any
scre-ups to Western Union. So TRY to
avoid residential codes if you can.
Don't worry, there's one was to find
out if it is a res code - Western Union
currently only let their res customer
use Metrofone 5pm to 9am daily, all
hours on weekends and holidays (all
you local times)... Simple way to find
out if it is res is that to call up
metro during time sother than the 
specified time and see if it works...
Easy, eh?... Well, have phun and happy
phreaking....
