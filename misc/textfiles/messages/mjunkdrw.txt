From: OPRIME DAMMIT on Sun Mar 11 11:14pm

Never have I been in a relationship that began with my saying to myself,"now 
there goes a person I would like to have a relationship with."

 Y'see, when you end a musing with a preposition, it cannot come to pass...

 Seriously though, the relationships that I have found myself in snuck up on 
me from behind or way off to one side, never from the front.
 Anybody who is taking the previous sentence an extra step deep is invited to 
die with festering boils.

For us it was love at first sight.We were at a New Year's party and talking 
about resolutions.She said hers was to find a new boyfriend and I said I'm 
avalible.We have been together for a year and two months.Therefore I have to 
agree with Marlin,It does JUST happen.

Truly in LOVE(not lust), SAMMY

     Sorry.  I will DEFINITELY be out of town for the next TWO weekends.
     Nostradamus, I doubt you had the right people.  I'm 23....and I don't 
consider that all that young.
     By the way, you should have joined us for pizza, you bum.  Passing up 
good pizza in favor of hiding behind a computer just doesn't make good sense 
to me......

   This is one to mark on your calender.  It's the Official Annual MTABBS 
Picnic, at Babler State Park on Saturday April 28th.  I'll be posting all the 
details later.  The reservations for the shelter (rain or shine) will be 
finalized in a few days.
   These picnics are usually a big success, with over 40 users showing up.  
Not something to be missed.

89/96 # 137528   Phone Numbers
From: NEWTON on Sun Mar 11  7:10pm

This is off the topic, however it refers to an earlier topic.  The Telephone 
company in Southern Nevada ( Centel? ) currently offers a module that 
displays the callers phone number on an LED display along with a prompt that 
states whether this is a previously recorded phone number, or a new number.  
Display of your number can be blocked by dialing "#67" prior to dialing the 
number you wish to connect. Ergo, your number is not displayed if you don't 
want it to be displayed.  However, then the recepient does not have to answer 
because he knows you do not want to display your number.  Could be a 
telephone solicitor.

Drugs, even the illegal kind have legitimate(sp?) uses, (ie: Cocaine is a 
great anesthetic,  the correct doses...) This kinda use is one thing, but 
DRUG ABUSE- heh, now that's a whole differnt story- ruins futures, 
minds,families, the cost is just too great to make it so readily available..

 What congress is doing now seeing if they should be legalized or not. A lot 
of researchers are now saying if the drug use is legalized, that would bring 
all of theese big fights and such out. I don't know or understand how but 
that's been the topic for all of last week, I think it'll be the topic for 
weeks to come.
 Immagine, we are now trying so hard to stop drug use in the u.S. And the 
world, now legalize it? Hmmm what is this coming to?

YES,but only weed.The other drugs are far too dangerous.

JOE:You must be under 21.If you are then think of it this way.Would you want 
YOUR kid smoking at the age of 5? 10? 15?I know I sure wouldn't.

The whole thing is that alcohol is legal but if it's not "used" responsibly 
then it can mess your world up.Same thing with weed.Hell,it's the same thing 
with anything!!!

94/96 # 137564   Me?  Under 21?  I take that
From: JOE VANCIL on Mon Mar 12  7:02pm

Sammy,
     I take that as a compliment.  Actually, I'm 23.
     Would I want my kid smoking it at age 5?  No.  And as a parent, it would 
be my responsibility to see that my child would be obedient.  One of my 
favorite pet peeves is AGE <> RESPONSIBILITY.  If you're going to make it 
legal, then make it legal to all.  If you're going to call it a privilege, 
then enforce it with a statute other than age.
     The problem in dealing with this "age factor" is that for so long, it 
has been burned into your minds that this is a good thing.  IT ISN'T.  
Sending mixed messages to people only causes confusion, and in teen-agers, 
will only cause rebellion.  Dealing with peop e who are younger as EQUALS is 
the only way you can gain the respect to get them to listen to what you are 
saying.
     Motivational lectures don't work....kids think they're stupid.  The law 
doesn't work....breaking it is a thrill.  Education works to the extent that 
it conveys knowledge....it doesn't help make the choices, with the exception 
of knowing the consequences.  Peer pressure doesn't work by 
definition....you've got to "convert" a group of kids before it will work, 
and how can you convert a group without teaching them to avoid peer pressure? 
 The only way to get the message across is to present it as an equal.
     Perhaps some of this comes from the fact that my two best friends are 15 
and 20.  However, one is notoriously anti-alcohol and anti-drug, and the 
other is notoriously anti-drug.
     12-17 year olds have no voice in the matter.  Maybe we should listen to 
what THEY say.....after all, isn't a lot of this stuff supposed to be for 
them?

From: TWISTED INFINITY OO8 on Mon Mar 12  8:03pm

  "age factor" actually not a good thing, or is that your rebellious opinion. 
  All repeat what I said before, there is no real discrimination when you are 
talking about age because no one stays that age the rest of there life.  We 
can't depend on parents solely to raise their children in an intelligent 
manner, we have to have a government to set standards.  But like I also said 
earlier it is the parent that should get the punishment rather than the child 
in most cases.  A parent has no excuse for NOT raising their kid, thats 
simple neglect.
    Fine, lets allow drugs for all.  But lets make a case for anyone caught 
drunk with beer, high on mariijuana, or wasted on cocaine get LARGE, VERY 
LARGE fines.  (And in a case of a child, their parents).  Although I normally 
try to avoid name calling I will now, because it is a prejudism I hold.  
ANYONE who uses drugs on a regular basis for something other than medical 
purposes are IDIOTS, plain IDIOTS, IGNORAMOUSES that have a USELESS life and 
who obviously can't live with reality.  (NOTE: "regular basis" this does not 
mean those who have tried it before, or do it maybe a once or twice a year).
    Joe the only way to prove someone is unable to drive, at first, is by 
their test.  Now it sounds alright to make it stricter but 16 is a fair age 
for people to start out driving.  Driving is a priviledge and no one below 16 
really need it(neither do 16 year olds but you have to start sometime).  I do 
think they should give driving permits for people around 14 (like in Florida) 
just so they have a long chance to ge educated in how to drive.
    For the drinking age, 21 is fair.  I don't think past 10 they should be 
all that strict about it, giving the right a little earlier is okay with me, 
but not much.  Definitely people should probably learn how to drink before 
they drive(and when people get drunk regularly you know they never learned 
how to drink) but it shouldn't be an absolute right until after.  Also just 
because someone is a competent driver, doesn't mean they are a competent 
drinker in combination with driver.  Actually it wouldn't necessarily be bad 
for drinking age to come before driving, but then driving age has to e backed 
up some.
    As for voting age, 18 is fair enough.  But the same those below have to 
be immune from some things that older people do because they had no say in 
the issue.  But like I said earlier 98%(may have raised it some) of all 
people younger than 18 who seem to care at all for the issues(I mean all 
around issues, not just some.  There are many that may know an individual 
issue and care for that one only, they shouldn't be allowed to vote) would 
vote by what they here their parents say.  And it also takes awhile to learn 
much history.  And that is probably one of the most important factors in 
political issues.

      But I can still blab on and on so I shouldd stop now I guess.  But age 
is actually the FAIREST way to restrict people because we are all at some age 
at one time or another(not counting the age of death).  Intelligence level 
seems valid but it is too complicated to judge, some people have bad days.

From: ALEXANDER STANGL on Mon Mar 12  8:46pm

   Well, I think any bill has a better chance of passing if it has age 
restrictions, like 18 or 21.  After all, nicotine & alcohol are currently 
handled that way (though loosely).

well, I think the flashback idea would have been good if it was done better, 
but "The Naked Now" and maybe 2 others are the only episodes that ive seen 
been copied, back in the 60's, Star Trek focused on 60's issues, and now in 
the 80-90's ST TNG is focusing more on TODAY'S issues. and isn't that what 
they've been doing all along? just different time-periods?

From: MARLINNIUM on Mon Mar 12 11:41am

   The Naked Now was obviously based on an earlier episode (The Naked Time), 
and for a good reason.  It gave us a really good look inside the 
personalities of everyone, so we could see what they're all about.  Great way 
to develop the characters.
   Looks like Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home held up pretty good to the TV 
editors.  Wasn't cut much at all.  One thing confuses me though... they left 
in all the "hell", "damn", "dumb-ass" stuff, but cut out "dip-shit".  And 
that was in there for a laugh.

you just contradicted yourself in saying that its safer than common aspirn 
when you say people die from the increased strain on the cardiovascular 
system. now I'm not trying to be naieve here but don't you think the FDA 
would have a good reason for banning it? for example what it does to your
