   Re:  (R)INDY3

Hey, like I said, if you go back to the library in Venice you can get a
book on how-to-fly-a-biplane.  There is also a way to get some tickets
to give to the man on the Zepplin.  Go into the airport terminal.  Put
Indy on the left side of the old man and Henry on the right side.  Have
Henry ask the man about his grandkids.  Then switch to Indy.  Have Indy
take the tickets that poke out of the man's pocket when he turns toward
Henry.  You can't screw up, because once you ask him about his
grandkids, you can't ask him that again.  Now, how to fly the
biplane... Give me some time to restart my game so I can see the
control panel. What I did was flip all the switches and pump the oil
thing three times, but let me check.  I'll get back to you later.

Well, Louis, I'm not sure, but I called Lucasfilm and they said that if
you take the painting of the trophy that you find in Henry's house and
give it to one of the guards in the castle, you will find something in
the file cabinet upstairs.  I never did do that, so I'm not positive,
but I think what you find has the safe combination on it.  And if what
you think is true, that would also be a ticket. Does getting Hitler's
autograph give you any points?  Because if you give the guards the old
book, you keep the grail diary.  Otherwise I don't know of many
multiple ways to get somewhere.

Look in the grail diary. Not the one in the game, but the one that
comes with the game. It shows you the right place to walk to. I think
it's on page 56. After a little experiminting, you'll get it. You need
to walk to a certain spot.  There is a little dot there you need to
center the cursor around. Do you still need to know how to fly the
plane? Oh, yeah, I was just wondering how you answered someone's
question about something in the Zepplin before you actually got that
far.
        Later...
P.S.
   What're you gonna do when you finish the game?  Maybe the action
adventure?

same spot!  Oh well.  I think I'll go try the blimp next.

I had the same frustrating problem about flying the biplane.  If you
take the blimp you wander around in  a maze until you find a hatch to
ANOTHER biplane.   When you crash you are just a little bit farther
than if you took the regular plane.  Did you have problems getting past
the road guards at the checkpoints? I bribed my way through most of
them, but by then I had pretty much mastered fighting so I had to get a
bit rowdy with some of them.  But I hear that if you show them Hitler's
Signature then they let you past. 
    Anyway, the action game isn't supposed to be as good. Let me know
how it is.  Got any other games that you're playing? Right now I'm
working on Beyond Zork and Hacker I and II. When my friend comes back
from vacation in Chicago he should have some cool games 'cause he said
he'd look in all the software stores and get some sweet deals.  Well,
if you need some help on one of the numerous games that I've played or
if you can help me, let me know. Keep in touch...

                   The San Francisco PC Users Group
    _________________________________________________________________

    *The Bay Area's premier PC club for IBM-standard micro-computing*

    Founded in 1982, the San Francisco PC Users Group offers support
    for users of IBM-compatible personal computers.  Our focus is on
    equipment and software that works with DOS, the IBM-standard
    operating system.  We welcome anyone who uses or is interested in
    IBM-type personal computers.  We provide a forum for all users --
    whether novice or advanced -- to share tips, solutions, and
    enthusiasm about personal computing.


    MONTHLY MEETINGS.  We meet at 7:30 p.m. on the third Monday of
    each month at the UCSF Laurel Heights Conference Center, at 3333
    California Street near Masonic in San Francisco.  Our meetings
    feature presentations of general interest by PC industry notables,
    hardware and software demonstrations, question-and-answer
    sessions, news about the group, a special instruction session for
    beginners, and the opportunity to network with fellow PC users.

    You are invited to attend!  At the door, there is a nominal
    admission charge for non-members.  Students are allowed free
    admission upon showing student ID.


    SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS (SIGs).  Several discussion groups offer
    small, informal meetings with a focus on specific application
    software, programming languages, and computers.  These groups are
    a valuable source of support for those struggling to make PCs
    work.  Currently active SIGs include:

          New Users                     Lotus 1-2-3
          C and BASIC programming       Microsoft Word
          Desktop Publishing            WordPerfect
          Enable

    Some of the SIGs meet meet at 6:15 p.m. immediately prior to the
    general meeting.  Others meet separately at times and places
    announced in Blue Notes.  Many of the SIGs have a special
    conference area on this BBS which is open to all members.
