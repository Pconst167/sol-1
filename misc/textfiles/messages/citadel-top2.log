I have not got long to tell you this but putting your terminal in
answer mode means that you must dial the BBS or Viewdata terminal you
wish to hack and select WAIT FOR CALL from your terminal menu when you
are asked for a password, the system (if it is crap enough) will reveal
it's identity.
-
-
-
How 2 Do It-
-
-
-
i) Dial an older BBS eg.Viewdata terminal or Wildcat 2.0 and lower.
ii) Enter your ID as someone with higher access.
iii) When asked for password put in RECIEVE CALL MODE
iv) If the BBS is old enough then the password of the person you logged
[C]ontinue, [N]onStop, [S]top?                                     in as will be revealed!! If not you will automatically hang up.

-
-
PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy and is used to send messages in
encrypted format so no-one else can read them. A PGP key is a utility
for uncoding these encrypted files!!
-
-
-
A backdoor is a small `gap' in a BBS system which enables you to type
in something at a certain point during your time on the BBS to enable
you to access sysop options or new access levels etc.

I will now post the hackers handbook in UUENCODED format as a .ZIP file
as it is so big.

Hi there again Rossi!! I don't know what happened but it looks like
UNIX or CHRIS SCOTT must have decided that the hard drive was too full
of messages or maybe it got to full and so it deleted itself!! All our
ID's went and everything!! Anyway, I'm still here so remember to keep
those demos floodin' in cos we've got some new hackers on here now who
have yet to experience them!!
 
I'll start the Japanese soon as I'm going to get a special Japanese
text editor so you can learn properly. Does anybody want to learn
Latin? (No? Didn't think so!!)

Salve Matteo Penna,

ho bisogno di un favore ... mi servirebbe il numero verde il VOL con
tutto quello che c'e' da sapere, in quanto stasera avrei bisogno di
scaricare molta roba da InterNet, per un totale di almeno 1-2 ore di
collegamento ... purtroppo lo posso fare soltanto stasera, in quanto
domani a scuola c'e' assemblea, quindi posso anche fare tardi ...

Spero che mi aiuterai ...

Lost Soul, sorry for that spelling error up there.

    Right, what did you ask me again? oh yes.

This BBs is quite easy to hack access into, but sorting out access like
upload for every user would be just immpossible, you could not do this
from remote access.

In other words I would Have to be chris scott ( AKA UNIX ) the sysop of
this BBs to actually change things like this, I would have to travel to
america or wherever this piece of shit BBs actually is.

As for me becoming a hacker, well it all started after me having alot of
time between films and shooting. When Renaissance pictures/Rosebud
corporation got onto the internet I would spend ages just messing about,
I would hang out in typical 'Hacker Hangouts' For quite a while.

Before I knew it I had learnt secret entry on the old AIX Bbs sites and
was wanting to hack more, it wasn't costing me a penny due to the
funding of renaissance pictures.

I know this sounds like a bit of a stupid question as you though my
backdoors were a load of bollocks but PLEASE could you give me the
ability to post proper messages? Oh come on, I did follow your hacking
tips the other day about making the sysop think you are his best
friend! I was only taking your advice, so will you give me some credit
at least? Maybe the name of someone and their password who can upload
proper messages?

Thanks for calling me "that guy", bruce.


Has anyone tried calling those phone numbers listed at log-off. As I'm
sure you all know, you can call 1-800 numbers from the UK. Those numbers
are a load of bollocks. Whe dialling I hope you also know that the
letters are 2 = ABC,  to 9 = WXYZ, that's the standard for the USA,
there is non in the UK, the phones show all different configurations.

OK Bruce and Chang... You SAY that you live in the UK, so answer the
following questions to prove it..

Bruce:
1) What is on page 28 of the TV-times for the 3rd to 9th of Feb?

[C]ontinue, [N]onStop, [S]top?                                     Chang:
2) What times and days are Brookside on?

Bruce:
3) Name 4 phone numbers in the UK starting with "1" and only having 3
numbers in total

Chang:
4) What is the number for FamNet BBS, 0800-something.


I'll leave it at that. ONLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.


And Chang, if Bruce had access to writing messages to someone other than
the sysop (like everyone can), then why doesn't he always write from
the "Messages" menu, and not address them to the sysop?

Right then Rossi, you want to post files in other conferences but it
says that they are read only yes? Well this is what you do to gain
write access to these conferences:-
 
i) On the main menu press J and select the area you want to drop your
files into (0-4)
ii) Now go to the FILE menu and select I for info on a file.
iii) Get info on DTIVCLIN.DOC and then choose W for write to author.
iv) It should now display the confernce that you selected on the main
menu and so now you can have full write access to that conference!!
v) Simple really!!

But who says that you are not the real sysop around here, and not a

So in the sysops account you still can't send mails to anyone but Julie
King or Chris Scott or whoever?

Sounds like you ARE the sysop to start off with!

Could you possibly upload the BEST phone hacking files that you have?
You know, the ones which get you free calls or enable you to gain

Hey!! If anyone has a small but hard Doom II WAD file out there which
they made themselves why don't they upload it and make it have a
characteristic on completing it so that the person who says they have
completed it first can proove that they have. You'll need a fast modem
though!! (At least 14,000bps I would have thought!!)
