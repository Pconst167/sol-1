It was stupid of the 'folks' that designed internet were stupid... But, As I 
believe, it was NEVER meant to be secure by ANY means... The security should 
be handled by the individual systems. From what I see, the main reason that 
I-net is so insecure is because the sysadmins are careless and lazy (I wont 
say stupid, because you can't be stupid to run a Unix system, just ignorant 
and lazy)... If they restricted access to I-net it might make it more secure, 
but then that would defeat the whole purpose of I-net... People also say it 
was stupid to implement the TFTP protocol, when actually, this was meant so 
that people could set up a "diskless" system and transfer the OS to it during 
boot time... The programmers might've made some mistakes while implementing 
it, but it was DEFINETLY NOT stupid! I very much doubt it would be in so many 
different versions of Unix if it was stupid!

problem with the internet as i see it..
On any interactivenetwork <as the internet>, in which various systems are 
"trusted hosts" o other systems... you are going to have the ollowing problem
you can have 100 systems on a network, and 99 o them can be totally 
unhackable..
all you need is to get into that one, and then getting in to the other 99 is 
dead easy..!
To make lie easier or users, alovely set of r <remote> commands were created.. 
which let you manipulate things on remote hots or your system...
you can practically do everything you can do had you logged into the system, 
without logging in..
not to mention the 1000's o bugs in both the internet and the machines and 
their networking capabilities in general..
<as some bbs users know! ahem..>

ut will sell if accounts $5, w/  free cpu time and dirtcheap printing, but the 
only catch is having to be a ut student w/ id.  i had one before which i got a 
friend of mine (who was a student) to get for me, but someone decided to narc 
on my and tell the system admins what i did. <how they knew is beyond me>
i heard somewhere <have not verified this yet> that ut has some stupid evening 
classes that ANYONE can get into for like $45. and you get a regular student 
id. going to look into that today, if anyone wants to know if it works let me 
know.  
but assuming the above trick won't work, i'd like to get an account somewhere 
that is 100% legal. <ie: not someone elses account>

the one i'm talking about is the network that connects thousands of university 
and other type computers together.  the nice thing about it is that you could 
say have a unix account at MIT, you could call up UT and without any password
connect to the site at MIT and login login with your account.
hopefully someone will give a more in-depth description.

oh and for those of you who enjoy using such things, try telneting to 
 quartz.rutgers.edu and login as `bbs' <no passwd>. it has irc, tinymud, and
tiny hell built into one account.   kinda fun when you're totally bored.

Name: Erik Bloodaxe #2
Date: Fri Jan 26 17:28:30 1990
For Joe Average to get an account at UT it will cost 100/CPU hour.  Kind of 
steep...but this will give you an account on EMX.
For a student, you can pay a flat fee of 5 dollars (towards the cost of any 
printing you may do) and you will get an account on one of the Sun systems.  
This is what most students have done, as most of us don't have 100 bucks to 
blow!  I don't even know how much time elapses in a cpu hour!
There are a couple of public access unixes here in austin that allow for 
Bitnet mail, and Usenet...I doubt they will let you telnet around the internet 
though..

13/31: CPU hour
Name: Dark Sun #11
Date: Fri Jan 26 20:45:30 1990
well, the student is limited to like .05 cpu hours max on a single process on 
EMX.... There are NO austin public access unix systems that are even hooked 
into I-net let alone letting you telnet between 'em.... Anyone know of any 
x.25 unixs off inet that you can get an account on?

it sucks down here. there are 2 pubnix sites, rpp386 <832-8835> and bigtex 
<346-2339>. You can't connect to either using tcp/ip and for the most part 
they only allow uucp logins.
as for mail, i've know of *one* place to send internet mail from for free, and 
its okay, but its single line and has to go through pnet01 and cts.com before 
the mail even gets outside.  plus it only polls for mail during pc pursuit 
hours. with all this factored together it ends up taking about 2 days to send 
to like mit.edu, and for comparison purposes (even though i know this is an 
extreme> i sent a 180line file from the if machines at ut to mit, and it took 
less than 10 minutes...

as soon as i go to compuadd and pick up a new power supply, I'll sit down  and 
read these uucp docs so i can get my own site up...

ok.. the reason you can login into a system from a differnet system is as 
follows
if on the system you are calling, there exists in your directory a file called 
.rhosts, and it has the name of the system you want to xcall form in it...
you are then able to use the rlogin command <also provided that the system you 
are calling from is in hosts.equiv and hosts on the remote system>
umm.. a cpu hour takes a hell of a long time..
i have just discovered that my univerwsity down here charge 20 dollars a cpu 
hour.. and i have used that system lots in the last year..
still havent been charged more than 16 cents or something..
Telneting is the internet equivelant of padding around the PSN.
it is extermely quick, and basically craps all over psn <i wonder why...? :-)
hmm.. i wonder if quartz.rutgers.edu will consider giving out source for that 
bbs... then again they may have no choice :-)

by the way, does anyone know of any other ways to connect to the internet

zardoz is probably the equivelant of an elite hacking board.. only the exact 
opposite.
it is a security mailing list which has all the top security experts in the 
world on it. Its basic function is to bring lovely security holes in various 
os to the attention of the security administrators.
thelist is EXTREMELY restricted.. and becausde it displays all known bugs on 
unix and various other operating systems, the systems which generally recieve 
it are damn near impossible to hack.
when you get root on a system.. look or it first thing!!

The Zardoz list does not put most bugs on it for a very good reason. ITs
sent out using mail and various Internet and uucp sites get it. As it passes
by in clear text, anyone with sufficient knowledge can intercept it (he he).
 
For a good look at what is really in the Internet, find a copy of the book,
The Matrix, and peruse it. I did not say buy it since it costs a lot but
its worth looking thru the sections about networks in various contries.
Did you know that there are no known networks in Albania, for example?

up until recently only allow government agencies to use computers. even
the academic institutions cant get modems, copiers modems and typewriters
can get you busted big time, for the computers they have. for an 
individual to have a computer is until the last two years impossible as
it was against the law. i send mail through gt-net to a guy in england
who then transfers the files manually to a academic network that has
a link in moscow.

from some info from a person at CalTech
The latest information is that most technology is stolen from the US 
(surprise).  One system is expecially interesting. I forget the number, but it 
is based on an Amdahl.  They copied a clone... how sad.  Most of the systems, 
especially mainframes are in English simply because most people over there 
speak English (that deal w/ computers), and they haven't the experience to 
steal and modify.

Israel pisses me off.
I decided to scan them.  Everything is going GREAT!  the response time is
immediate, I'm getting all kinds of addresses, etc...
THEN...they make the network REFUSE COLLECT from the US.  So I get about 200
RCC's in my scan...I stop it, mad.  Later it's working again.  I start back
up, happy.  Then, they take it down again.  I'm getting confused by now.
Then, it's back up again, but the response time is LOOOOONG.  My program 
doesn't like waiting, and therefore keeps fucking up.  I dunno what
their problem is over there.  Are they still at war or something?  
Also:  The datapac directory is going to be done soon.  I still have to 
go and check some 2000+ addresses but I will eventually.  Anyone know
anything useful about the HUNDREDS of Terminals attached to the network?
I'm assuming that they are dialin-nodes, but I don'tthink you can pad to pad 
them.  At least I haven't been able to get on one when someone's been there.
But I have millions of them...

Um, are you going to scan it from the local dialup?  Or by it's DNIC?
It's 3126, isn't it?  I'm not too sure if Telenet lets you call it, but
that would really get rid of that damn three try delay...also, I think 21221
resets the error attempts, so you can scan two then 21221 and then two
more, ad infinitum...
Also, Janet refuses collect...I'm assuming you mean the nua when calling
from telenet...Or have you found a gateway through Tymnet?  
Janet needs a password, but it might only be for some woman named

    Scanning by dialup would be slow.  That's out.  I don't know if telenet is 
connected to Autonet.  If it is, I'd scan it by NUA.  Otherwise, there are 
gateways to it.  (eg.  You connect to an NUA which acts just like a dialup)

Name: Erik Bloodaxe #2

It woulnd't be such a great idea to scan Autonet through the Telenet
gateway.  Autonet raised a holy shit-fit when Urvile was doing it
about a year ago, and sent Telenet Security all kinds of nasty
mail bitching for them to stop whoever in 404 was connecting to their
system.  Telenet blew them off, but if it started again, Telenet might
just have to listen to their whining and crack down.  
I suggest you (or whoever is planning on this) do your scanning through a
main dialup.  It will be slower, but probably safer in the long run.

There is a gateway or something that goes to Autonet.  When you connect to the 
NUA it acts just like you called an Autonet dialup.  Would this be as crummy 
as scanning with the 3126 DNIC?
Check out the DNICs listing from Daneel Olivaw and myself.  I never knew that 
the US had that many pacet networks!  Also, what's the difference between 
Telenet (3110 DNIC) and GTE Telenet (3127 DNIC)?

The Autonet gateway is at 31341. The problem is, although it *acts* like a 
normal dialup, your PAD address is sent to them from your Telenet PAD when you 
connect. Apparently, the address header is attached to every connect attempt, 
because they went *nuts* when Urvile scanned 5 or 6 NPAs - they knew 
immediately it was from a 404 Telenet PAD.

You can't modify it for pad-to-pad, but you *can* modify the X.25 software so 
that you can connect to any CUG by disguising your incoming address.

    Since they had an easily found PAD in Canada that went down, and then I 
noticed another part of Develnet in Dayton that ALSO had easily found pads on 
it, there has to be another one.  If I can get some information on their 
company and where it is based (besides Canada and Ohio) I might be able to 
track the next Develnet pad.  Anyone want to help me here?

but I may not be right, 
that DevelNet, JettNet, and others are all owned by Mead...like the
paper people, and whatever else they make...
That's my guess...they are a world-wide (well, at least North-America wide)
company...and probably do lots of business in Canada...and they are basd in
Ohio, thus the Meadnet address there too...arg...
Your guess is as good as mine...

Hmm.. Would it matter if it was being monitored? as long as you werent caling 
from a local telenet dialup and you didnt give out yer number over the pad it 
shouldnt really matter. Anyway... When u log on to the 51359 pad it says 
something like Develnet somethingorother - SCL2 or some odd number.... 
Develnet only disconnects you when you type valid commands..When I tried this 
odd number SCL2 or whatevr as a command it disconnected me..I tried again to 
verify and it did again..I wonder what this command would be used for.??

Name: Phoenix #17

The way I see it, it matters as follows
Anything you do through that p[ad is being logged..
that means any info you find or is given to you by others will be captured..
These systems will probably then get logged as well..
followed by which they will die...
and eventually one thing leads to another... and people get busted...
A general rule that i try to follow is that if i know something is bieng 
monitored... STAY AWAY...
Prevention is seriously the best cure...

You dont seem to have any problem with calling QSD ..and EVERYONE knows that 
IT is monitored.  Hmm?? However.. I agree with you. Now..about Develnet being 
owned by mead...I dunno.. What I DO know is that there is an NUA that I found 
scanning that connects you to MEADNET. Its in 513 too.  What I dont know..is 
how to get the damn thing to work?!  It gives a list of 40 or so systems ..but 
how do you select whihc one you want to connect to?  Herez the NUA:
51331 from telenet... it accepts collect connections too.. 
if anyone can get anything out of this can you let me know eitjer here or in 
email? ...thanx... 
Also...does anyone know anything about LEXIS & NEXIS ?  Looks interesting.

k-rad d00d.  Heh.
51331 is Jetnet/Evandale, I believe.  In case you didn't know, logging on to 
51359 and typing PAD would log you onto the Jetnet pads.  This was useful as a 
front end to 51331 which didn't accept collects when 51359 was up.  Got that?

You could always call Pac*it+ if you don't mind MCI giving your name/number to 
GM!  Get yourself a good fast outdial that will allows WATS numbers and call 
1-800-727-2796.  It works just like Telenet 'cept you leave off the leading 0 
in the DNIC.  (0208057040540 should be 2080...)  It will connect you to any 
3110 or 2624 address without a problem as long as the host is actually up.
Don't abuse this from home.  They will fuck you over.

you can be billed.  You DID break the law.  Technically, you call their system 
and used it without their permission.  Now, if for somereason they should go 
after you for calling a few piddley outdials you can just say you thought it 
was Telenet.  They probably will let you off with a warning and some other 
little deals.  If you were using it to scan...then you will be screwed.  I 
wouldn't advise calling anything direct anymore.  It's just too dangerous 
these days.  The only things I call direct are Phoenix Project and Telenet or 
Tymnet.

oh well...
also, kinnynet isn't hooked into tams, and all you need is an old id to get it 
to work, although you don't want to use it for scanning, as it hangs up after 
a wrong attempt (and after you disconnect from a valid host)
dig up your old telenet nuis and use it freely...until they get smart and fix

you caused a lot of problems for GM  they are losing a lot of $$$ coz of it.

Name: One Assembler #11

I dont understand what the diff would be between rwall and wall... in order to 
use the wall bugs you gotta modify /etc/utmp on the local system, right 
(correct me as i go along if I'm wrong). So, you would just either specify 
you're local net or no net for rwall. I heard the prob with wall t(and rwall 
is that you're fields get messed up in your passwd file when you do this. I
was thinking instead pointing it to /etc/passwd point it to a superuser
accnt (ie first cp /usr/spool/cron/crontabs/root $HOME/root then point your
utmp entry to the file /usr/spool/cron/crontabs/root, because I wouldnt
think that cron would screw up on any characters added{in,{as lon{yM t(as

defcon is not system specific... it is an invention of the realm, and was

program which would hack/scan/perform almost anything youwould give it.
The results are quite astonishing... defcon can go through 50 vaxes trying 150 
username/passwords on each in under an hour. It runs of a mainframe, so user 
does not need to be online while defcon is running. Todays defcon has deault 
listings for unix , prime, and vax plus more systems, does a default hack, and 
then any additional combinations you tell it to try.
It will also scan nuas for you..
All up not a bad package.

The best way is to tftp all of the address's for the organization you are
looking at and snatch the password files.  This can be automated in a simple
shellcript which would look at/read the host table as sysn (assuming you're
in one system already) and tftp to each machine in the table.  Then do a
"get" to grab the password file.  This is where you will generally discover
someone left an unpassworeded account.  If there are SUN's connected you're
really in luck because the security onthese machines is always left open,
and generally they belong to researchers who don't know how or just don't
give a shit ("why should I password all of the accounts?").
Anyway, once you've grabbed all of the password files (try giving them
the host address as a name - makes it easier) run even a simple cracker
against them and you're sure to get results.

  What is an ideal system to have Unix on?  I can get discounts on AT&T 
equipment because I have 3 or 4 relatives who work for AT&T and Bell Labs.  
Price is a factor but not much of one.  I do not want to get some piece of 
shit clone and use Xenix and all that other shit.  I want a robust system with 
the works.

If you don't mind older equipment, snag a 3b2 (or 3b5 or whatever). They're

You want to put a trapdoor into the login program, right? You need to get 
ahold of login.c (I think I have a copy of the BSD 4.3 version) and just put a 
jump in it that takes you over the /etc/password check if you enter a certain 
string as a username.

find it for quite some time, and then when I'm NOT looking for it it just 
appears.. (As you can tell, this is not the reason i posted this)... So, I go 
to FTP the source for login, and guess what???? My passwords been changed. I 
think I know who, but I dont want to start an argument again (he already is in 
a bad mood for some reason)... You know who you are, so could you at LEAST 
change the password back? 
Related... I can supply source with a reasonable amount of trouble to anyone 
who wants it (ie maybe I'll encrypt it and let you break it--just to make sure 
noone gets it from me instead of trying to find it at all)...

it "executed" right then and there (if possible)...even as root, with the host 
time set at ANY; and flat out running uucio will not do it.  I have tried cron 
entries executing uucicio once a min...etc..This is true even if the particulr

Name: The Mentor #1

When you execute a uucp request, getty is usually executed as part of it. 
Because of the slow nature of this command, if you execute it too quickly, 
you'll execute a second getty before ungetty has been executed. This screws 
everything up, and usually freezes up uucp until someone manually resets the 
tty's. 
If you want to do it, I'd execute the following:
1. Change the cron so that it isn't running uucico.
2. Kill off everything in the queue (uuqxt?).
3. Give it a few minutes to kill everything.
4. Queue your request.
5. NOW execute uucico.
6. Restore the cron.
7. Begone...

password shadowing;
found on some lbl system <lbl.arpa> at ucb
unix bsd 4.3
as i saw it, it works as such.
you have your passwd file still kept in /etc/passwd, but all accounts are * 
out.
eg root:*:..etc
they all appear that way.
now.. there is a file called master.passwd in /etc which is readable/writeable 
by root only.
when a user attempts to change a field in his passwd entry, it creates a 
temporary file in  /tmp <called #.passwd, where # is a number>, does the 
changes there, and then copies back to master.passwd
this is how i believe it to work anyway.

arg
of course i will look into it further.. but i got a shock when i saw this, coz 
i was unaware thate berkeley were even considering using shadowing as security.
for those of you thsat dont know, password shadowing involves hiding all the 
encrypted passwds usually found in /etc/passwd
i guess they have finally realized what a mistake it was to make /etc/passwd 
world readable ;-)

I know of several password hackers that FTP a remote /etc/passwd and try out 
names for passwords and reversed names and last names and things like that.  
It's just too big of a security hole unless the passwords are created by a 
good sysadm.

it doesnt seem to exist under sunOS.
I dont think that sunOS has an equivelant... and i believe that login on sun 
works rather differently from login on BSD... so if anyone can help me out..

If you are on a VAX with decent privs, you can run a utility called "MONITOR" 
that allows you to see everything going across an Ethernet or X.25(9) link. 
Very useful if you're on a busy system. Just turn the buffer on and sit back...
Type "HELP MONITOR" for details - even if you don't have the privs to run it, 
it'll give you all the info you need about it.

Are you referring to the infamous promiscious mode instead? Where you set
the Ethernet controller to record all the datagrams. I have a
DEQNA ETHERNET users' guide in front of me, and this includes information
on how to set promisious mode on. I imagine there are programs out
there that do this...does anyone have one already written?

I have done this, assinging SYS$OUTPUT to say, _RTA1 or LTA6:, and I am
sometimes able to send things to their screen, like if I did a SHOW USERS, it 
would appear on their terminal screen. I did this in a room full of
people with DEC terminals, it was amusing. Of course I didn't interfere with 
anything important, but it was interesting to watch peoples reactions!
They would look around and wonder who the heck did that? one person
somehow found out that I had my SYS$OUTPUT defined as his terminal and sent me 
a msg back.  BUt about SDA, there is so much there... whoever said you can 
read the type - ahead buffers, can you give me some more details on this?
I have only been working with SDA for about 2 weeks or so.

You can set flags when you have it monitor decnet that will do an ascii dump

to a vax anymore, and seem to have lost all my old notes, so I don't have the

I've been finding local primes lately....
Very odd...I've never really run into them off of networks, yet in the last

Prime isn't my thing, so I want to know where things are kept...also how
to designate between types of files  (ie: ascii & binary) to when I slist

You won't want to slist any thing that ends in .RUN  .LINK  .SAVE   .ABBREV  
or .VAR that's for sure.  Also, don't try anything that indicates is a segment 
directory or you'll get a bunch of shit too.  One thing about Primes is that 
if you do slist a bunch of binary stuff by accident you may end up hanging 
that comm port until they do a reboot... it depends on how they are setup but 
it is possible.  Same thing can happen if you enter an application that asks 
for a terminal type and you enter a wrong one.
Hey...instead of slisting files you want to examine just  ED the file and P2 
lines of it....at least that way you won't get a whole screen full of garbage 
if you get a binary file.
  
Oh.....  .DBMS files are binary too....

the context of 'owned' means not literal ownership ofthe DTE and host computer 
(although if U DID find aprime on another net it'S probably OWNED by the 
network itself..) by rather one part of the collective network weave..telenet 
would claim a prime in 03110...understand? soif you found aprime in 
France(02080) you couldpossibly try TRANSPAC as a login/password IDpair....

11/41: MPE - The best OPSYS ever
Name: Wiz #25
Date: Sat Jan 13 18:52:51 1990
MPE (Multi-Programming Executive) has to be the best operating system I have 
ever seen. If you have a REALLY smart System Manager,then MPE is one of the 
safest operating systems around. However, most SM's are brain-dead, and leave 
several loop-holes open. The TELESUP is a prime example.
Try logging in to MGR/MGR.TELESUP/HPONLY,PRV/PRV - this usualy has the same 
priveleges as MANAGER.SYS, so you can do anything.
If you ever want to get nasty with a system, and slow it down HORRIBLY, run a 
program called COLOSSUS.PUB/.TELESUP, or COLOSSUS.PRV.TELESUP. This is an 
awesome program, (the COLOSSUS part stands for COmprehensive On-Line Oriented 
System Stressing Utility Sets) - this program will stress the living daylights 
out of an HP3000, and slow the whole thing down immensely. NOTE: When you run 
this program, is will give you a "lock", and yopu must enter the key. The lock 
is in the format of a 6-digit number, and the key is calculated as follows:
Take the second digit of the lock and add 4. This is the first digit of the 
key. Then put in any other digit. Take the third digit of the key and add 5. 
(Sorry, the FOURTH digiti of the lock). This is the third digit of the key. 
Again, add any other digit to make the 4'th digit of the key. Then take the 
LAST digit of the lock and add 6. This is the 5'th digit of the key. Add one 
last digit, and you are in!
Assuming that the 6 digitis of the lock are ABCDEF, and that X is any digit 
from 0 to 9, then formula for the key is:
(B+6)X(D+6)X(F+6)X. So if the lock is 108064, the key will be
4X5X0X - where X is any digit. Simple, but effective.
If anyone is interested, I have the complete source code for MPE V G.02.04 
(including all the sub-systems) on a HP7980A-readable 6250BPI mag tape (6 
tapes in total), and the complete source code for MPE/XL 1.1 on 2 CD-ROMS.
I no longer have access to an MPE system, but I can always try and copy the 
tapes at our local HP office if anyone wants them. The CD-ROMS I will NOT part 
with :-)
If anyone has NUA's for MPE systems, please post. I would be most grateful.
Bye for now,

  OKay, I have 3 HP-3OOO's that all belong to military contractors.  I can get 
into all of them (considering I used to work for one of the companies before) 
but when I get in some dipshit put an extra password PROGRAM in.  So obviously 
I break out of it BUT when I try to get into the editor it says I can not do 
that in break.  So here is my question, how can I snag ASCII files without 
going into the editor.

RE: Yeah Yeah Yeah
Hi Par.
Your friend form South Africa was already here :-)
I am tryinmg to organize an HP3000/MicroGX so that I can port all the relevant 
code accross to my PC. AAll the interesting utilities like DISKEDX, and all 
the accounting routines. If you have PM on any MPE machine, I can get the 
source for a program called GOD, which changes the users capabilities in the 
JMAT and user stack (which is where all MPE commands look for capabilities). I 
will also soon make an ACAD drawing of the MPE SYstem Tables maps, which is 
invaluable information for any MPE hacker. It explains the JMAT, User stack, 
all account,group and user indexes etc. Alternatively, I can try to scan in 
the MPE System Tables Manual, and post it somehwre releavnt, or I can just 
send you a copy?
Let me know what you want.

19/41: Default MPE accounts
Name: Wiz #25
Date: Mon Jan 15 07:28:03 1990
RE: defaults
Basically, there is only ONE default MPE account  - the SYS account, and there 
is always at least 2 users in this account - OPERATOR.SYS and MAGAER.SYS.
However, for every sub-system that you install, they all reate default 
accounts. If HP-DESKMANAGER is installed, there is a new group in SYS, called 
HPMAIL, and a new account called HPOFFICE. MGR.HPOFFICE always has PM 
capability. If the customer subscribes to remote support, then TELESUP is 
created. This is a VERY useful account, as it has all the capabilities 
possible on MPE. Try to log on as MGR/MGR.TELESUP.HPONLY,PRV/PRV
Other sub-systems lke HP-WORD, DS/3000 and NS/3000 etc, all create their own 
accounts.
Talking about DS/3000, if the site has X.25, and you want to use it to call 
out, try typeing in DSLINE ENET at the : prompt. It should give you an @ 
prompt, and from there you just type in C nua to connect to an NUA.
Hope this helps,

You can use the FCOPY command and FCOPY the file to your LDEV. However, once 
you have pressed BREAK, you enter the MPE break mode. Just enter :ABORT and it 
should put you back into normal command mode.

RE: Damnit...
"When you are checking files, and perhaps want to look at one, is there

etc..."
Yes - the command to do so is LISTF,2 - this will display the files in a full 
format, and after the file name, there will be a file type. All executables 
are of type PROG, text files are of type TEXT etc. I can post a full list of 
file types and what they mean if this would help you any.
As a matter of interest - ENET stands for Extended-NETwork. It is the X25 
extention to the DS/3000 or NS/3000 packages. Also, a neat little trick thast 
you might try, to run multiple sessions without the risk of having an LDEV 
hang on you, is to DSLINE into your own system. Eg, if your system is called 
"GOLD" on the network, then just DSLINE GOLD - then you can log on again, and 
if anything goes wrong, just press BREAK, followed by a :, which will drop you 
back one DSLINE level.

RE: Hmmm
Jason, if you want to stream a child process, you have to write a little job 
to do what you want to run in background, and then STREAM the job. I'll type 
up a text file on MPE jobs, and post it in a relevant G-FILES section (is 
there one for MPE ???).
As regards DSLINE, just type in DSLINE and the name of the system you want to 
connect to. I'm not sure if I understand what multi-padding is, so explain it 
to me and I will tell you if it is possible.

RE: Yep

Shit man, you got the stangest requests :-)
I dont think it is possible to run multiple sessions (interactive) from one 
LDEV (port). What you CAN do is repeatedly DSLINE into your own machine, but 
in order to get back to each parent session, you need to BREAK out of the 
current one, so the proccess is suspended. The cleanest solution is to write a 
job file to do what you want to do, and then STREAM it.

When you log onto MPE, there are 3 ways of doing it:
:HELLO, :JOB or :DATA.
:HELLO is interactive,
:JOB is a batched job file, and
:DATA is something else which is so uncommon that I dont even know what it ios

I have looked at the logon source, and there doesnt appear to be any bug in 
the NURSERY code. It can all depend on the version of MPE you are using too. I

They have nothing to do with eachother except that MNP is commonly use at the

The Rolm CBX ][ is fully digital (at least once it digitizes your voice at the

Anyone ever find DISA lines that respond to # and * before you enter the

would sometimes be 9-able PBX DISA lines on 800 numbers..those were
very nice but naive. I know on some you can do # and * and sometimes get speed 
calling codes (like #9, #90, #x...x, etc.) AFTER you are "cleared" wuith
the intial access code. But it is usually inconclusive to mess with the
# and * bore the code, at least in my experience.

I was looking at the docs the other day, and noticed something interesting.  
There would seem to be a security hole in the mail part of the CBX (voice mail 
that is).  It seems it only care what line it goes to... not who. hehe, could 
make for some interesting fun.  Oh yea, ROLM on an oscilliscope is 
interesting.  It does some digital multiplexing, so data transfers are limited 
(at least as far as standard modems are concerned). Direct digital is fine, 
just it the multiplexing screws up the analog/digital transmissions of a modem.

re: encryption
Ok, I'm thinking about writing a short, downloadable program that will allow 
people to decrypt an encrypted mail message. This way no one would be able to 
see the true text if there's a data tap on the line. You'd call in, buffer 
your encrypted mail, and decrypt it with a prearranged key from the safety of 
your home. I could write the thing in basic so that it'd run on damn near any 
system (it'd be a modified version of my Cellular Automata program from the 
tech journal #3 - available from the d/l section).

Think on that a second. If I encrypt the entire board, then either *everyone* 
knows the key (which defeats the purpose) or I have a differently encrypted 
version for each caller (wasteful).

  Is this a DES-based crypt? I am suspicious of most common crypt machines.

RE: ummm
Well, what you might do is restrict access to all but the general board sectio 
n if the caller does not have the encryption. BTW, Mentor, I took you're 
cellular encryption method and converted that into a chat encryption program 
that will work over anything (except typing gets slowed down by 1/2 because 
before every encrypted character it sends a "%".
                                 DS

18/27: Yes - it has DES
Name: Wiz #25
Date: Sat Jan 20 20:03:37 1990
Mentor.
Yes - the new version now has DES, as well as a Vernam-cypher, and a custom 
encryption method I dreamed up. I will list the features below, but first one 
question: Will it be OK if the program uses the entire ASCII set (0-255), or 
do I have to add an option to mask all characters out of the range 32-127 ?
If you want to know what ECHAT has, it can:
a) Do buffered inoput and output, in a split-screen mode. This is usefull for 
the "Korn" chat, as quite often the text gets garbled when two users send a 
message at the same time. (This buffereing will be optional).
b) Have a complete back-scroll buffer, up to 64K long
c) Has a dialing directory, so you can dial from it too
d) Has a two-way Eliza Parser, so you can fool the bloody Itals on Altger if 
you like
e) It can filter out messages from specific users, and alternatively 
ignore/send a response/use Eliza on the user(s)
f) USe Either DES, Vernam-cypher, or my own custom encryption
g) Log everything to disk if you like
h) Run in 43/50 line mode if you have the hardware
i) Have a note-pad facility so you can make notes as you go along on the system
j) Have several macro hot-keys, to save you typing in all the boring logons
k) Supports from 110 up to 38400 BAUD, and has FOSSIL support
l) Can use COM1-COM8, so it is quite flexible
And as I go along, I add in all sorts of extra little bits which I think will 
be usefull. As soon as the current version is finished, Iwill upload it here 
fro evaluation. Unfortunately, it only runs under DOS, so all the Aplle/Amiga 
users will have a problem, unless I can get it converted for those machines.

Can anyone help me out in getting the official address of someone with a P.O. 
box without directly calling them and bullshitting, or physically trailing 
them? I tried calling the post office and telling them I was from G.O.D. and I 
needed a residential address cause we didnt deliver to P.O. boxes and the Mail 
God told me that he couldnt give that info out unless I came down with a form 
and ID and all that shit...

Hell, if CNA doesn't work, call the Business office that covers the
exchange for that area code.  Tell them you are So & So from Whatever Bell, 
and that CNA doesn't have a current listing for a/c-nnx-xxxx and would they
please check the name listed for the account.  You will usually need
to give them the CNA number to "Prove" you are who you say you are.
This works just as well for non-pub's and they will usually give
you the address and other lines at that address if you say please.
(BTW:  don't fuck up and call them daily and do it for a BUNCH of
numbers...especially if you are after 512 numbers!)
Setting up 800 translations for a pots is a pretty simple thing.
You need an SCCS.  That's about it.  Real rough...I think you can
even get a Nation-wide one, but you might need to be on one that
controls a 5e...I don't know.  Mark?  You know.  What is it?

 About engineering the SCC as an alternative to CNA - I wouldn't do it.
 Simply because there are many other more worthwhile things to do with the
 SCC than find someone's name and address from a number.  Use the business
 office.  They are usually more unaware of things like that.
 To set up an 800, I think you have to have access to a 4E toll switch.
 Correct me if I'm wrong.

I don't know why Mentor put this here, but I suppose everyone knows by now.
I have a few friends who have worked in banks as tellers.  The system I got a
chance to look at first hand through him was weird.  It was some big beast
of a system, with each teller having his own telex terminal.  Very strange.
Kind of reminded me of the setup travel agents have.  VERY weird.  He showed
me how to use it though.  Hell, they trained him for a few months, so I didn't
feel bad about not getting the hang of it in the hour I was there.
Computer assisted banking transactions are not anywhere near as easy to 
perform as glamorized in the movies.  None of this transfer from here to there 
with a simple keystroke bullshit.  Banks are fucked.  Everything has to be
approved, verified, stamped, signed etc...well, maybe not all that, but
there are a LOT of things to take into consideration, and if ONE little
thing isn't there, the whole thing aborts...like, if one response wasn't letter
perfect, the thing rejected the whole transation.  I guess I can understand 
that, as banks do the SAME thing over and over, and there really isn't any 
reason to have changes in the data format.  
One nifty system I'm in in California will allow you to do all kinds of neato 
things.  It's on telenet too.  Lots of banks on telenet.  One interesting 
thing is that the California one rejects when you call the main address...but 
when you connect to the right sub-address   *BOOM* you're in.  There is only
one sub address that works too.  Wild.  Would have kept out most people.

Name: Phoenix #17

true.. transactions are very very very hard to perform frfom remote..
First a system emulator would be nice... <banks tend to use really wierd sys 
emulation>
Secondly online transactions from front office terminals are only available 
during business hours... they shut down at other times.. only thing operating 
is atms.. and <most> they use encryption anyway.
Next you need to know pretty much how the bank works in order to perform 
correct transaction... all sorts of system codes... bank codes and a whole 
stack of other shit.
Of course before any of this can take place.. a valid sign on is required...
99% of the time these sign ons are the employees salary number with the same 
password. But then there is the problem of each user only being allowed on the 
system once..between the hours of 9-5. So the solution ? I dont know.. i 
joined the bank to investigate such things.. and have done so pretty 
thoroughly <which is whyy i have just posted notice o resignation>. The only 
way i have found to actually rip off a bank has nothing to do  with 
computers... so there...

Date: Thu Jan 11 21:21:10 1990
But most of the ATM encryption schemes I've played with were fairly easy - 
ranging from straight rotation to one- and two-table schemes. As DES chips 
become common, it will become more difficult - I don't understand why they 
don't use more robust encryption methods now. I mean, the one I did in LOD TJ 
#3 is unbreakable by anything this side of an XMP-1, and even that would take 
awhile. Single-state machines are the wave of the encryption future...

Hello.....
I'm into radio stuff too (Pretty good, cause I'm also a Telecomminications 
Major.) 
If you want to cause havoc with someone radio equipment with major QRM a good 
approach is to make a good pink noice generator and hook it up to a high gain 
AF amp and into a small AM transmitter and drop it nearby the reciver.  The 
power output only needs to be a few hundred mw to really make reception a 
problem, because while the tranmitter it's self is low power, it's still the 
strongest signal, and since it's being over driven, the band width can be 
several hundered Khz.
We used this on people in out area who "DEAD KEY" or otherwise make themselves 
an obnoxious source of noise.  Sure, while they are making all their noise it 
won't bother them, but until the batter is removed or dies, they just recive 
crap.  Also, on a related note, my favorite if to get as close to an offending 
station as I can and just cause massive RFI with my linear.  The subject will 
still hear me even with his radio turned off, I generate engough power in my 
mobile to drive coil in speakers, phones and other electronics without them 
being on (of course, with their audio amps on, it's even worse, because the 
RFI will creap into the amplifications stages.)
Anyway...current radio project, a 1200 watt linear amp I'm making for an AM 
and SSB base station I'm making.  Also, trying to start a little radio conv on 
a small system in San Diego, if interested 619-660-6734, minimal plug, I hate 
people posting numbers on my system...so...
Anyway, radio stuff...I know a bunch, and I have all kinds of info from 5mw to 
2KW, AM, FM, SSB, CW, DSB, 180 Meters to 75 cm....although, I am not a HAM...I 
can do my best to help out with anything.

yes it can be done. go buy a scientific atlanta controller box from a cable
distributor, cost about $100. pull the top off, pull the roms and get 
yourself a 8048 cross-assembler to look at the code. the routines that
control the identification of the user are easy to find, right near the
top of the code. just go in and play with this code, insert nop's for
example, and enable all the decoding, it is done in hardware,and you
have what you want.

Name: Ravage #19

you should not use a pink noise generator as it's power spectrum falls off
at the higher frequencies on a given channel. you should probably use a
gunn diode oscillator, a white noise generator w/ equal power bandwidth
spectrum, followed by a set of linear amplifiers. another good source of
noise is a spark gap. this can be generated by using a high voltage 
transformer, i use a jefferson electric luminous tube transformer 721-121
12kv @ 30mA output. jefferson is in bellwood ill. what you do is connect 
the input to 110vac and the output to a couple of rounded probes. the 
distance between the probes is adjusted for the best spark. watch out for
the ozone this generates because it creates free-radicals in your blood 
which is a carcinogen. these can also be used to make jacob's ladders or
tesla coils.

I love my country. (even after all the shit they've put me through)

i Love my family and friends too much to jeopardize them by selling secrets

I think you should learn (and hope u do soon that we are just a bunch of kids

(I.e.  becasue tFDhey couldn't stFDop us from doing it.. and once you 
excersize a muscle it tends to grow and prosper. so we've gotten out of their 
control..
don't jeopardize your country just because u are good..or your friends avd 
family
Because in the end...The gov't agencies will know everything about it.

It's the Major SS buzzword these days.
Treason.  If someone if poking around in ANY system they feel is 
sensitive (although they leave sysdiag unpassworded, or lp password lp, etc..)
they will then label you as:
"A Serious Threat to National Security!"  
Give me a break.  Hell, I think my association with Par & Phoenix alone
is enoough to get me the firing squad.  I haven't even done anything, 
but it seems that everything bad that's happened I keep getting
brought up, as I know such and such, or I somehow know EVERYTHING about
how such and such happened.  
Well, I've tried my best to be good, and stay out of government things, 
military things, etc...  I've even edited out the "sensitive" things I've
run across in the Telenet scanning just for their sense of well being, 
but if I begin to feel threatened, it's all going out.   Unabridged.
We will see...I'm already getting nervous...the feds are already pissed 
that LOD is still kicking, and this bbs must have SLAMMED it into their
faces.  And I know that the EFT files must have pissed them off as
well, although that may or may not have anything to do with
this bbs suddenly going back up.  
Well, I'm not a threat to ANYTHING, except myself maybe.  Anyone who
knows me knows that.  Back me up people.  This is my public announcement
of not-guilty to any and all crimes against the Security of the United
States.  So what if I was scanning 2502 a while back?  Anyone ever think
that it would be in THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL SECURITY to hop into a
Soviet system?  I thought it would.  
Par knows what I mean.  Hell, The government now seems to think he's a spy, 
and want to shoot him.  Killing Teenagers for fun is not my idea of 
constructive problem solving guys.  Take an extended course in the 
ways of the hacker.  That education might do you all a world of good.
You may even pick up something you missed in your little weekend getaway
training seminar in fighting computer crime.  When you come and kick in my
door, (don't step on the cat), and if you don't blow me away first, 
maybe I can educate you all a little better on what is REALLY GOING ON!

If the SS is supposed to protect systems, they would scare the hackers out of 
NOT messing with the system...not bust him.  That just makes the others so mad 
that they decide to ravage the system he got busted on...I know I have and

Well, Electron, if the CIA wanted *you*, they'd just shoot you. Fortunately, 
we're inside the states so we only have to worry about the FBI, the NSA and 
the SS.
While I can't speak for everyone, some of the "hunted" people on here are 
federal fugitives. Yes, they *are* being looked for. I know some others are 
wanted through phone contact to sympathetic government workers who 
occasionally clue me in as to what's going on.
The bulk of the people who think they're being watched, aren't. But the gov. 
is going for airtight cases, most of which involves survellience for several 
*MONTHS* before they hit. <sigh>

i have 3 monitors sitting right next to each other and it transfers the
rgb for my ammy over onto the composite video for the vcr or the 64. it
doesnt do it on the mac, different sync rates. 
 
never heard of this called tempest, live and learn. one way to do it
is to put an antenna on the tv, a rabbit ears is good. then tune to a
dead channel, hey sounds like neuromancer :-), and then try to pick
up the horizontal and vertical signals. it your antenna is good it
aint to hard. the fartherest i have ever gotten it to do it with 
my system is about 10ft. i dont know if it will work over longer
distances. another way that comes to mind is to take just the crt 
driver circuits and take the inputs to the vert and hor drivers and
then put a big wire on there for an antenna. i bet this would pick
up the signals for a couple of hundred feet.

if par ever calls back he was telling me about a big manual he had read 
dealing with this type of technology...
supposedly an antenna can be designed for a small amount that will work over a 
great distance, and using an osciliscope to lock into the frequency it can be 
"tuned in"
I dunno...but e-systems, tracor, and others all did major government work in 
it...Back in like 85 I was digging for info in those companies, but 
unfortunately I didn't find much that helped me any, or that told me things I 
didn't already know.

From a source at Tracor:
Tempest has several leels, and was designed by the DoD for a standard of radio 
emmisions on electronic equipment.  I know that DEC has some Tempest terminals 
for saly (at roughly a 100% increase), and that IBM also markets it (through 
Federal Systems Divison).  I am not sure, but I think the top level is 3, and 
it specifies that there should be NO emmisions within 5 feet of it.  I have 
seen only one terminal, but didn't have an occilliscope at the time (looks a 
little strange in side of Burlington IBM facility).

   Yeh, thats the basi rundown on it... You can pick up all kinds of EM 
siginals, and you just amplify them a lot, and you can pick up all kinds of 
crap... There was some project DoD was working on, so now things are suposedly 
designed to meete Tempest standards or some shit fo the sort.. So they wont 
give off to much info that could be used.. I mean you can pick up stuf MILES 
away!  You can be a good 100 yards from someones computer, and see their 
screen simply by listening in on its EM siginals....Its prety cool, but kinda 
big and heavy to carry around..
    Also.. speaking of this kinda stuff (which I like a lot).. I was wondering 
if anyone has ever tried the REVERSE of this?  It is entirely possible to send 
those frequencies FROM you TO them, with such power, that you actually 
OVERRIDE their dirrect connection siginal!  5-10 wats will do the job from up 
to 100 feet away!  Its prety incredible.. I have never found any actual 
practial uses for it before (although I have though ot lots of wild things to 
do with it).....But I can sit out in the van, parked in front of someones 
house, and brodcast MY audio/vidio right on to their TV screen... The nice 
thing is, of course, its reguardless of what channel they are on, and even if 
they are dirrectly connected to cable!

You might consider running waffle as the primary and then having it launch

that if users were on one they were on the other.  You could also just make 
everyone have free access on the WWIV and then make the Waffle on a validation

Welcome home kids.
I was watching Dead Ringers last night.  Real cool flick.  I wish I was a 
doctor.  Made me laugh...these two gynecologists staggering around their
apartment..."ok, we gotta take a shot of the dimetapp now, and then a little
of the dilaudid to chill out, then a bit of the benzedrine to wake up, ok?  
But tomorrow we kick, right?"  Hehe...fucking junkies.
Um, anyone seen any GOOD x around?  I haven't have GOOD x in ages.  Maye
the X is still ok, but I'm not.  Hmm...
Got totally smashed last night.  I've gotten on this drinking binge where I 
only drink straight liquor.  Drank about a half-pint of bacardi last night.
Passed out, ran into walls, threw up on my floor.  Someone really should
have slapped me when I decided to drink that much.  Kinda weird...I have
only been drinking beer for the longest time.  (I stopped really slamming
the hard stuff a while back) I think I like the beer buzz better.   There 
there really is a difference between the effects of different alcohols.
God, I got stoned last night too...I forgot that.  Smoked a whole Joint by 
myself basically.  Hm...

Does anyone know where to get any really good opium.
Not that Synethetic Sopium you so often find people trying to pass off, and 
nothing cut down with chlorides or anything.  Good shit, the shit that used to 
be around four years ago.
And is anyone familiar with DMT--dimethyltryptamine?  What I hear is, "imagine 
sitting 100 yards from a tree and watching the leaves as if they were inches 
away --- Every living vivid detail and the rushing freight train sound of them 
shaking in the wind!".  Not that I actually want a drug that powerful.
Anyone in Ecstasy (X)?  Any good.
Usually, I'm just a mary jane man, but opium is a highlight.  Something I like 
to get ahold of every four months or so.  Don't want to nullify my opiate 
receptors, and don't have to worry about it as long as I stay away for long 
enough.
Drugs are good.  They cut the dullness of modern day life.  Firing my neuro's 
crazily, presenting a lot more pictures, information, and feelings at a much 
higher pitch.  I think it's worth it.

He quotes a lyric from a rapping song
now people be rappin' on the drug board... dats wrong.

By the by, the only reason Erik got the "pumpkin" for free was that he won the 
costume contest dressed as a FBI guy.  Sun glasses, jacket, tie, ear plug, 
concealed mic, uzi....  He won a toaster and I bought it off him and he used 
the money to buy DRUGS.  Shame.  It takes a real man to eat a tab-o-X at about 
3 A.M.  
Anyway lets talk legalization on here.  I am sick and tired of this war on 
drugs B.S.  America first got its feet settled by smuggling rum and tobacco to 
Europe--an illegal venture to say the least in that day.  Drugs are the 
backbone of this country and if they would just legalize the shit instead of 
running through Kentucky trying to arrest country folk cuz they have some 
weeds growing behind a barn a mile into their farm....  It is a WEED.  How do 
you think it got its name?!?  It will grow anywhere.  If they would just 
legalize and regulate distrubution then the crime and killing would be 
decreased and the revenues could go into drug treatment centers.  Legalize 
pot, Acid(my lip-smacking favorite), coke, opium, crank, horse, everything!
Then you could know who was taking it, how much, and profit from the fact that 
man is motivated by food, shelter, sex, and INTOXICATION.  There is nothing 
they can do to stop 100% of the trafic which means that when the guard laxes, 
the shit will start all over again.

Prophet-
    How often are you able to lucid dream? I find that I can't force it, but 
get about one a week "accidentally."
    For those not familiar with the technique, lucid dreaming involves a 
conscious control of a dream. For example, I've had nightmares in which I'm 
being chased by people (usually in suits... hmmmm) and, while still dreaming, 
realized that it was *my* dream and I could do whatever I wanted. So I had an 
Uzi appear and shot them all. Kinda cool. Some people can do it at will.

   Yes, with Practice you can learn to controll your dreams as much as you 
want.  However there is a down side to it all (there always is, sint there).  
If you can controll your dreams it takes a whole lot of fun out of it all.  At 
first its real nedo and fun to be able to do whatever, but after a while, you 
run out of things to do (as imposible as that may seem)... A real bummer..
    And as for the leagalization of drugs.  From a strictly historical point 
of view, I see so many similarities between the "War on Drugs" and 
"Prohibition".  It simply follows that the War on Drugs will go the way of 
Prohibition.  It causes so many problems, and why?  Because a bunch of people 
think they know what is best for everyone.
     Of course there are good reasons to have drugs illegal.  But those are 
all based around the irresponsible use of drugs.  Drugs when used correctly 
are not dangerous.  Its so silly that the No. 1 drug, Alchohol is legal.. Its 
also the most dangerous.  More peopel die from it than all other drugs 
combined Im sure.
      People are starting to be responsible about their use of Alchohol, Dont 
drink and drive, crap of the sort...But people are MUCH more responsible with 
their use of other drugs.
       But it doesnt realy matter.. Prety soon people will get sick of all the 
problems and violence caused by the illegality of drugs and end it.

I've never had a problem with not dreaming (lucid or otherwise), thou the one 
problem I do have is not dreaming. I take meds. that are suppose to keep ya 
from dreaming, but they don't seem to work. Most of my dreams are WEIRD!!! Not 
scary just weird, and they do weird shit to me also. Like my pulse when I wake 
up is somewhere around 130-144 (not very safe for my age or any) and one time 
my dad walked in and thought I was dead 'cuz my body temp. was so low...

There's lots of ways.  Some involve drugs, some just sleep deprivation.  My 
favorite is the macrobiotic.  You starve yourself of good food (beef, cheese 
and anything that tastes good) until you can no longer see.  Then you are so 
damn bored that you just wander right out.  
Seriously, I'm using the gateway series of tapes.  I'm only on tape 3 of 15 
but they are pretty helpful.

an out of body experience can be kind of scary...most paranormal occurrences 
are not for the faint of heart or the casual experimenter...be careful
A nifty thing to try is take a hit or two of some mild acid, and lay down in 
a dark room with your eyes closed.  That will result in some incredible 
astral journeys.
I've decided that since hacking has been ripped away as my hobby, occultism 
will take it's place.  UT's Harry Ransom Humanities research center has an 
extensive collection of works by crowley, (nearly everything he ever wrote 
including personal letters!) other books on magic, like Levi's history of 
magic,  all kinds of cool stuff.
I've just bought a book by Israel Regardie (who is in crowley's order of the 
golden dawn, or its current faction) and I am also interested in spells and 
things like that.  
THere is a new age book store here in austin on South Lamar that I want to 
check out.  
I'm currently reading a translation of the Necronomicon, so I might just end 
up dead or insane before I finish it anyway...

I really enjoy lucid dreaming....very liberating.
I believe I had an out of body experience, when I spolFDke with my
girlfriend, what she had to say matched what happened to me (
I was in her room during the night in an astral/etheral form) but this
is really just another beginning! The unified field and the union
of the chakras, kunlandini, etc. all are very valid and important
things in my life.

About a year ago, I practiced Stephen LaBerge's MILD technique for inducing 
lucid dreams religiously for about 5 months.  I had maybe 3-5 lucid dreams 
after about month three, but the ability fades rapidly when you slack off on 
the exercises.  I still have an occasional spontaneous lucid dream, 
particularly when I take a nap in the afternoons (something that LaBerge noted 
in his book).
Definitely a great experience.

tend to drop your gaurd after a while...and they pick up on your personality 
through posts and stuff.
 
Granted, they could do the same thing as Joe Hacker, calling a system...but 
then he's got all these rules to follow so he doesnt violate your rights.  
Here, he's out in the open you know who he is..etc..etc..  
 
As I stated before...  Mentor always draws a good crowd..and thats good 
becuase when you have a highly technical question that you cant figure out, 
you can ask it here...where some of the best reside..then again..you're afraid

    I really don't have a question at this point.  What do you all think of 
the Phrack bust?  Do you think its a very legitimate bust (Ahem!)?  And would 
you have led to the same thing if your investigations did not allow you to 
make any legit arrests?  I doubt you're out there blatantly trying to nail 
everyone too, right?
 
    And a interesting question.   If you're going after someone who's pretty 
lethal, or possibly lethal, does it make you nervous going in for a bust?

Name: Sandy Sandquist #49

The Sprint operators are part of company called Sprint Services. This now 
comes under United Telecom Inc. The corporate security department for 
Sprint/United has the responsibility for security in the sub-company. A lot of 
the fraud that takes place through these operators is sent back to the LEC's. 
That which is not sent back may end up the responsiblity of the Sprint/United 
Corporate Security. I am the Regional Corporate Security manager for the area 
of United Telecom Inc that US West serves. This area includes Sprint Services 
in Arizona. Now isn't that about as clear as mud?
 
I hope that came close to answering your question - Silencer 
As for AT&T, I believe a recent event may have taken a little wind out of 
their arrogant sails.

I'd tell 'em they can get a lot more done by enlisting the cooperation of 
people to eliminate holes in security rather than sitting back and *waiting* 
for people to exploit them.
It's far better to be proactive than reactive.

    I'd like to see the same approach to computer hacking that is done in 
Europe [or used to be done?].  Hacking should not be illegal.  Gaining access 
to weak systems should not be illegal.  Destroying, modifying, and 
reconfigurating data should be illegal.
 
    Anything that is done that would not otherwise endanger or destroy, or 
take from others, anything that does not hurt others, or be more than for 
informative purposes only, should not be illegal.

the problem with hacking as a whole <as you all probably know> is that once 
you gain access to a system, whether or not you damage anything, you have 
trespassed on other peoples property <in a real roundabout way, though>.
and when youstart looking thru files <which everyone deos when they get on a 
system.. come on..> it is comparable to opening someones letter box, and 
reading there mail. i mean i like to hack lots <more than lots> but i 
understand perfectly well why all aspects of it are illegal..
still... id be prone to agree with mentor..

    Well, one of the main reasons people hack is so they know how to do it.  
Few people set out to do any damage, and some get carried away in the 
excitement.  But there IS no way to hack legaly, so what can you expect.  
Someone may do no damage and cause no harm, but they are still breaking the 
law.  And why, because they just wanted to know.  Now I know this sounds like 
the same old Hacking for Knowlage line of crap, but there realy is something 
to it.  I dont set out to trash systems or caus losses, but everyone has their 
own interests.  If your intrest happens to be fones or computers, the only 
difference between that and other things is that most of what your interested 
in is Illegal.  I mean lest be serious.  
    I think its pretty much common knowlege that many of the 
people who have the best ideas today were hackers just a little while ago.  
And Id bet you anything that every last one of them would credit hacking with 
their major source of knowlage.  You cant learn everything by reading a text 
book, or going to school to learn BASIC.  You cant learn ANYTHING that way.  
The way I see it, Hacking has a GREAT deal to do with the kind of technology 
we have today.  I think before we try and tear down our MAIN source of 
computer education, mabye we ought to have something to replace it with?

I disagree with the notion that you cannot hack legally....I do this
almost daily on a VAX/VMS system I work with. I have delved deeply
into the system and am still exploring to this day. And I would classify
it as hacking, because that is what it is in a pure form. IT does not
have to be illegal! Why complicate things more....

delving deeply into public access areas of an operating system is not illegal..
delving into an operating system is not illegal..
delving into someone elses area of an operating system is illegal..
the boundaries are simple..
of course delving into a system which you have no obligation to be on is 
illegal nomatter what..

might want the definition of hacking changed... it
is not any idiot with a computer that knows how to use it.  It is someone who 
is serious about wanting to know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING.  The world would 
be a better place if there were more people like "hackers." At least then 
people wouldn't say it can't be done, because anything is possible (except 
getting a tax refund from the IRS...)
Also, tehre should be somthing like "punishment fitting the crime." Most 
hackers (note this), do not destroy/modifiy/alter the data on the system that 
they are on.  The only thing I ever modify is the log of system activity (and 
other things such as that) to cover my trails.
Lastly... get the "phreakers" out of the hacker name... they are completely 
different people.  They cross the lines often, but they are in it to rip-off 
people, not for hte information.  I want to know everything about the phone 
system, since it seems know one else does (including ATT). That is a "hacker" 
desire... it shouldn't be illegal.

I have often noticed that when I ask someone if they hack (while on a chat 
system) they will say "Yeah!" and I later find out that they are great hackers 
or things like PBX's and 950's.  That is NOT hacking.  That is scanning.  The 
so-called phreakers of today are usually 13-year old kids with nice computers 
and hard disks full of the latest pirated software.  These are the same people 
that get busted for calling Alliance meet-me conferences.
Hackers tend to stay away from sleazy chat systems like QSD, but manage to 
call altger or tchh while trying out a pad.  The hackers do what they do for 
the information and thrill of finding something out about the system.  I guess 
you could classify the original phreakers (the ones with blue boxes, paper and 
pencil) as phone hackers.

changed locations of certain things.  I don't know the entire case but at
one time someone said Telenet was the one that used them most often.  It
seems strange that yet another government agency is comming into the

Gordon is correct when he states that CERT is nothing more than a group of
"experts".  They act primarily as a clearing house, only.  They do not go
out and investigate hackers - they are not the secret service, fbi, cia,
nca, etc...
They provide information on security tools and workshops for industry and
government alike.  They usually will be at usenix, etc...

59/59: CERT...
Name: Pain Hertz #84
Date: Wed Feb 07 18:29:44 1990
is Computer Emergency Response Team.  They are concerned with computer 
security in general, but concentrate on networks and Unix systems mainly.  
Richard Pethia is director of CERT (rpd@sei.cmu.edu).  As Gordon mentioned, 
Kenneth van Wyk, 'runs' the digested VIRUS-L, which is a good source of 
information in general.  Look for a g-file soon from Richard Pethia via me 
about CERT.  I sent him mail saying whats the deal with CERT and he responded, 
I'll upload it soon.
 
Also, according to the Phrack boys, CERT played a minor part in their 
downfall.  It seems when Phrack sent out back issues during the holidays, many 
folks were not there to receive the files.  Systems had problems with file 
queues and storage.  Sysadmins complained to CERT and so forth.

Well this will be a once in a rare while kind of post.  First of all, that was 
not us that called your board, GZ.  My guess is that it was Mork from New York 
and his pal, Acid Phreak.  Right guys?  RIIIGHT.  Those are the 2 names that 
come to mind anyway (QSD...fucking with people...Phiber Optik and Acid 
Phreak!).  Anyway, there's a small problem.  For those that mail us on the 
networks to our UMCVMB on Bitnet or UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU addresses, please stop 
until further notice.  Any and all mail can be addressed to phrack@netsys.com 
or ...!netsys!phrack or phrack%netsys.com@rutgers.edu or phrack@netsys.UUCP 
(you get the idea?).  Our accounts have been temporarily discontinued although 
not deleted.  We are thus far unsure as to what exactly our crimes have been 
(although we have a number of suspicions! 8-)) and hopefully will find out 
tomorrow.  Regardless, the phrack@netsys.com addresses are mail forwarders and 
should reach us eventually.  I (Taran King by the way) am going to be getting 
a new address on the networks.  I'll mail anyone who I communicate with once I 
get it.
As for Phrack 31, it's sort of in the works.  We have a number of articles for 
the issue already and the PWN stuff is going very well.  Bloodaxe!  How about 
those articles???  Anyone else, as Mentor said, please upload them to him and 
he'll get 'em to us somehow.  Drop us a line if you haven't already and are on 
the nets.

6/59: UMCVMB Accounts
Name: Phrack Inc. #7
Date: Thu Jan 18 08:47:06 1990
Hi this is Craig.
We lost the accounts for "something about a newsletter dealing with 
telecommunications."  The university did not feel it was in the pursuit of
education or academics.  
They also received at least 17 letters of complaints from other system 
managers because of the recent Back Phracks project that was conducted over 
the Winter Break.
The problem was that some people requested all 30 issues and their mailboxes 
over flowed because they were not getting on over the break.  This caused 
problems and attracted attention and thus it caused problems for us.
According to people at CERT at least one person who was a subscriber has lost 
their job over all this.  I could not find out who, but apparently it was 
someone who was "on thin ice" already.  CERT also said that they were recently 
flooded with letters from people commenting, complaining, or just inquiring 
about Phrack.  The Internet community is stirred up in general.
"phrack@netsys.COM" still works and I am collecting my mail regularly from 
other accounts I have on the net.  These problems will NOT affect Phrack 
distribution (altougth it might hurt collection of files if people don't 
remember to mail us at phrack@netsys.COM and still try to use UMCVMB).

Now that's smart.  Anyone who knows anything should have just asked
you two.  That's shitty.  Like CERT doesn't have their own
problems dealing with "Internet Crackers on the Loose" and crap
like that.  Things must be slow at CMU that they have to bug 
harmless things.  Hell, it's not like Phrack has been
publishing ZARDOZ mail for fun.  
I think you should chat with the powers that be and get phrack
set up as a newsgroup on UseNet!  There is a BIG demand for the
damn thing, and it would be easier for everyone to get, and
you wouldn't have to send it all yourself!  It would (or should)
wash, if you let some Internet BigWig moderate it.  Hell, It's
usually about as big as RISKS is in a month, and if you put
it out monthly, the load wouldn't be that bad.  
That's MY feelings about the situation.

    Well, it appears that Phrack has perhaps seen its last days?  I don't know 
a lot about whats happened, or going to happen, but the future looks dim on 
that subject.  Of course, there's no reason for others not to try and continue.
    Can they actually prove plagerism in a text file with everyone using 
aliases, and no proof of original origins?
    Anyhow, back to "re: FidoHost".  

    As far as I know, there isn't, but that doesn't blackline me.  I'd be damn 
interested in hosting such a system.  I've got the system, I'm fidonet, and 
the IFNA doesn't dare blacklist me.  Besides, being a PhrackHost, even if they 
found out, wouldn't mean shit, there is no Fidonet bylaw that says I cannot 
support it actually.  And beryond that, I could host the whole thing, putting 
the newsletter into the News Distribution echoes.  Its good reading.
    [Besides, I'll put a bogus filter on the front of the TIC].

I do recall an article or something that was taken from another source.  I 
also recall that the source was identified and that the author's permission 
was granted.  This may not be what the SS was looking at though.  I have a

laws and laws pertaining to transmission of information etc. and see what he 
digs up.  I think hes a member of the ACLU too.  While I'm at it, it so 
happens that I have a friend who is security at UMCVMB.  Ill tell him about a 
'rumour I heard' about UMC and the SS.  Those of you that don't know it, there

Yeah...on that path you get attacked and torn to shreds by wild beasts..barely 
anyone has been able to actually get to their destination by that path...if 
you know what i mean... just when they are almost there and doing quite 
well..they usually end up getting eaten alive.  
On with the Techno-Revolution!
On with Phrack!
On with the fight!

    Yes, as I stated on the General Messages Forum, I see no reason to stop 
Phrack.  All of KL'
s and TK's work would go down the drain for what ... nothing.   
 
    I mean, I don't think making a mailing address for submissions is the 
"right" idea at this time, but there a PLENTY of people who could back-alley 
issue some good editions.  I'm willing to put my "umphft" into it to keep the 
standards that KL and TK started.  
 
    I see no reason, none at all, NOT to continue releasals.  For if they take 
Phrack down, what's next, Pheonix Project <I say, no!>.  They cannot knock us 
down that easily.  There are more of us (brains to brains ratio), and we're 
smarter fast, and a little more curious.
 
    Anyone who's ready to start Phrack 31, or have PHrack 31 started, count me 
in, I'm willing to start tommorrow if the proposal is made.

seems to me one way to get input would be to put up posts in different 
cities about u/l text files. then call back on a regular basis and d/l
them like a regular curious user. then every few months compile what 
everyone has, say at this bbs, and then put it out. while it might take
some time to do it could pay off. might cover such stuff as breaking 
copy machine protection, copy protection crack schemes for different 
games, source listings of programs, newspaper articles, security info
for computers, anarchist articles, etc. it would allow contacting all
these groups all over the country and getting info from them in
return for info from other groups and paying it back by distributing
said info. one way would be to add crack screens to games that would
in general tell people how to input to the group. maybe a list of
bbs's in larger cities?

Why doesn't everyone simply let Phrack die in peace?  I mean it was pretty 
good at times ..but c'mon!  If you feel that a gaping hole has been left in 
your life at the absence of phrack....well perhpas that particular problem 
should be the LEAST of your worries.
 
Here is a novel concept...start another magazine!...Tahts orignal!  Rather 
than bickering over the rights as to who owns the name ...(TAP..blah..balh..) 
or passinfg the responsabilty to someone less qjualified (does noone remeber 
Crimson DEath?)...simplystart another.
 
I am in no way putting down Phrack...on the contrary I am attempting to at 
least keep it name alive...untainted.

to everyone to spread the word that a new magazine is coming out.  OK?  
Me and Loyd will be collecting unreleased files and start shipping them out 
whenever I get around to it.  Start send ing submissions to the sysop 
directory, or to erikb@walt.cc.utexas.edu 
ok?  Craig wants phrack to remain dormant, especially since it has too many 
ties to him, and any new surge would reflect bad on him.

The series is broken down as follows:
   1. The USA (as it covers the most people and I live here)
   2. Europe
   3. Others (Australia, Far East)
I am covering all of Internet at the moment, and whaver of the PSN that need 
to be covered for that (i.e. Telenet at times).
Also, I have a list of all the DNICS (already up), and several other misc. 
files to offer.  I am also considering a file on the 5ESS (as I have a 
complete set of manuals... I got the others Mentor).

i think easiest way is to just sendmail it to various unix everywhere.. and 
then have sub distributions off there..

50/59: Distribution...
Name: Pain Hertz #84
Date: Sun Feb 04 12:14:41 1990
...of Phrack was provided via LISTSERV.  Phoenix's idea is similar to the 
LISTSERV concept.  A distribution site sends mail/files to only the users in 
its site.  Only a few copies are needed to be sent to the distribution points. 
This greatly reduceds net traffic, which makes the 'stuff' less noticable.  
However, with LISTSERV, this is an extensive logging system making anonymous 
distribution, anonymous final addresses nearly impossible. 
 
Another possibility is using FTP sites.  There are several anonymous FTP sites 
that allow users to PUT files.  One of them being CERT (CERT.SEI.CMU.EDU).  
Perhaps a combination of both would be good.

i think that we should get the damn thing written before figuring out how to 
get it everywhere.. that will seriously be a small problem.. and you can make 
it look like it comes from anywhere by forging mail thru smtp ;-)
phrack@sei.cmu.edu for example.. might annoy some people.. 8)

The "magazine" will be called 
   MATRIX
I want every file anyone will send...I plan on writing some pretty wild stuff 
myself, not just hack/phreak.
Anything interesting, informative, and bizarre enough not to be something that 
you'd read anywhere else.
The distribution will be as follows:
Anyone on internet will receive a copy if they desire.
THis bbs will have it online
Anyone who wishes to distribute it to other bbses

The internet distribution will occur from randomly selected sites each issue, 
and it will send them over smtp to disguise the points of origin.
Now:  start writing.

The Prophet and Knight Lightning being indicted.  Also a nice little graphic 
showing how the E911 info flowed from down south to Illinois...to Knight 
Lightning at his school.  The US attorney must have said a dozen times that 
this was a case of "out and out theft".   They also showed a LoD graphic and 
talked about how "one must commit an act of computer theft or espionage to 
become a member of this hacker gang".

Six-Flags, drugs & 14 year old women!!!
Dallas was a blast...we will have to do it again.
THis time:  Dan & LOyd, you will have to try not to be scared of the mall.  I 
know all the lights, bells & whistles seem scary, but video games can't hurt 
you.  Computers are our friends!
Hehe...THe doubletree is looking good...I think if we do damn well go up there 
again, this fucking time we are going trashing whether anyone wants to or 
not!!!
That's what got everyone so scared to begin with (fed wise), so let's give 
their undercover stakeout people something to do!  I
can just see two dudes sitting at the fucking holiday inn waiting patiently 
for us to show up.  hehe
thank god we didn't...or they would have made us pay their way into the 
fucking theme park.

old crew.

that i'm not in jail.  unless you're scared of me being there.
-legion of doom, anyone?

Hell, there was hardly anyone at Dallas last summer and it was fun... Chris & 
I will begin planning for this year. How does mid-july sound?

How does mid-July sound for DoomCon II? I don't have a calander in my lap, but 
whatever weekend is closest to the 15th. We'd probably run it out of a Best 
Western or something relatively cheap (the Doubletree was nice, but most 
people aren't going have $155 for a room...) We could pick people up at DFW 
and Love field (we probably want a hotel in or near DFW...
So how many people'd show? I don't want this to be a big, open invite thing. 
Just people we know (and friends that they might bring with them and vouch 
for.)

and yes trashing is the only way to find out things... I got 2 COSMOS 
passwords last night... people are in general... stupid..
Hehe... Best Western sounds good to me... hope SouthWest'll still fly there 
cheap.

Hell, you can pile in the car with me & Erik & Lone Wolf (wish he'd get a 
phone line again...).  Getting there is half the fun! <weaving only slightly> 
Besides, as the chemical-free kid, you'd probably get to drive! This gets 
better.
"Mom, I'm driving three wastoids to Dallas this weekend. Don't wait up."
Rav- 
    The reason for Dallas instead of here or someplace else is because DFW is 
a hub and people can get reasonably cheap rates. Besides, West End is 
absolutely too cool, even if you do freak out on it a little at first.
99 bottles of beer in the car...

    It's happening soon guys..
I wish i coul have bought more time.
And worked out a deal.
But nada... they are nearby now.
i can tell which cars are theirs driving by outside.
This is the weirdest case of Deja vu i've ever had.
(because it realy did happento me before)
Anyway got an interesting call today.
It was from Eddie..one of the bell systems computers...
It was rather fantasy like...
Probably just his way of saying goodbye
Eddie was a good friend..smartest damn unix around...
and he called to tell me goodbye today
(no joke)
now i know i'm fucked.
thanks eddie it's been real.
(whoever you are)
"ok eddie, this one's for you"
Much Later,

Buddy, you are over the edge...lay off the weed.  Not everyone with glasses 
and dark suits are feds.  Not all cars with generic hubcaps are government 
issue.
Well hell, I don't know what the hell eddie is, but that's a real bizarre msg.
Fly to austin...like tomorrow...got plenty of places to stash you until things 
can be smoothed out for a calm transition.

I knew staying sober (most of the time) would get me into shit like this... 
hell I guess I could help drive, I say we rent a car though... hehe... no use 
ruining a good car when we can rent a nice Lincoln for a weekend... hehe... 
keeps the beer from spilling...

Name: Daneel Olivaw #9
Date: Tue Jan 30 18:34:45 1990
several places today about getting a Taraus SHO (you know, the one with 
220hp), but they said "You must be crazy."  The best I could do was about 
$29/day with unlimited miles and that was for a nice Mustang GT... hehe

    Surveyers survey your neighbors regularly, and wear sunglasses when i't 
like 11 degrees and cloudy as hell out.
    When an AUTOMATED Customer Name and ADDRESS Lister calls you and tells you 
your address.
    The same cars keep driving by outside day and night (been thinking about 
providing coffee and doughnuts)
    This is getting really fucking ridiculous.
Oh well, i guess i could say
"Things could be better"
Jason

    What you could do is go out to one of the vans sitting in the street (you 
know, the one with the two guys sitting in it all day) with a pair of jumper 
cables and ask them if they need a jump, you've seen them sitting there all 
day and you thought they were stuck.  
    Hell, why don't you take 'um sandwhiches too.
                                                 Aston
P.S.  Thanks for letting me join the family d00dz.
