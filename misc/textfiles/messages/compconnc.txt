HERE'S A SOMEWHAT WELL KNOWN FACT ABOUT
CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN (FOR YOU NOVICES):
 
  WHEN A 'SS' MAN IS PRESENT, TRY AND
  GET HIM TO WASTE HIS BULLETS BY 
  'JUMPING' IN AND OUT...OR, IF YOU
  HAVE A BULLET PROOF VEST...SIMPLY
  WALK UP TO HIM WITH YOUR GUN DRAWN
  AND WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE HIM IN THE
  "STICK-EM-UP" POSITION. THEN TYPE
  THE LETTER 'U' TO TAKE OF HIS BULLET
  PROOF VEST. THEN SHOOT HIM!! THAT'S
  IT...TRY IT...IT'S BETTER THAN 
  WASTING A GRENADE (SOMETIMES!).
 
 
HAPPY ADVENTURES!!

FOR MOST OF THE BROKEN PROGRAMS (COPYA
TYPE) OR CPM PROGRAMS, WHY NOT TRY
USING PENULTICOPY?
 
IT MAKES COPIES IN ABOUT 42 SECONDS.
THERE IS NO OVERHEAD INVOLVED FOR 
FORMATTING.
 
AND IT IS PRETTY ACCURATE.  I HAVE
NOT FOUND ANY ERRORS SO FAR.
