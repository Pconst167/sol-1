Unorthodox Priest: Okay, did a little bit of fooling around with this number,
and it seems like it is emulating a VT-52. Atleast, all characters echoed fine
and the few lines of output I did get weren't garbled until I changed
emulation to normal. Don't know what the system is do you? Fool around with it
some more.

Does anyone else hack BCSC? If you do, you wouldn't happen to know the password
for some of their directories? I have the password to their mail system
computer, but I am still trying to gain access to the main system. I HATE UNIX!

                       the Phantom

ACETONE PEROXIDE EXPLOSIVE

Materials required:

Hydrogen peroxide from hair bleach (15-25% volume content)
Acetone

Sulfuric Acid     - Clear battery acid boiled until white fumes appear
Eye dropper or syringe with glass tube

Graduated cylinder (cc or ml) or other measuring device

Thermometer (0 to 100 degrees C)

Glass containers

Large pan

Ice and salt

Water

Paper towels

Rubber band (one)

Procedure:

1> measure out 30 ml of acetone and 50 ml of hydrogen peroxide into a glass container and mix thoroughly.

2> Cool the acetone/peroxide mixture by placing its container in a larger one containing ice and salt, and
water.

3> Cool acetone/peroxide mixture to 5 degrees C.

4> Add 2.5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to mixture using an eye dropper drop by drop. Stir the mixture slowly with the thermometer. If the temperature exceedes 10 degrees C, then quit adding sulfuric acid and stir until temperature is between 5 to 10 degrees C.

5> After all the sulfuric acid has been added, continue stirring the mixture for another five minutes.

6> Let the mixture sit or remove and place in refridgerator for 12 to 24 hours.

7> After 12 hours white crystals of acetone peroxide will precipitate out of the once clear solution. Precipitation should be completed after 24 hours.

**CAUTION: At this point, the mixture is a primary explosive. Keep away from shock,friction,and flame.

8> Filter th mixture through a paper towel into a container to collect the solid particles.

9> Wash the solid particles collected in the paper towel with small amounts of cold water poured over them in a spoon. Discard liquid in container.

10>Place these explosive crystals in a glass jar and allow to dry.

How to Use:

1> Acetone peroxide is a powerful initiator and can be used itself as a main filler when making homemade detonators.

 RDX EXPLOSIVES

Materials required:
hexamethylenetriamine (hexamine) -available in drug stores under the names urotropine,hexamin,methenamine)

stong nitric acid

acetone

measuring spoons or weighing scale with gram accuracy

graduated cylinder or measuring cups

thermometer

several large canning jars

two large basins or bowls made of metal or other similar material that can be heated

paper towels

rubber band

Procedure:

1> Place 1/2 cup, 120ml or cc of nitric acid into a large canning jar and bring the temperature to between 20 degrees to 30 degrees C (68-86 degrees F) by putting the jar in a bain of cold water. If necessary, swirl the canning jar around in the basin to bring the temperature down,while being careful not to allow any water to splash into the acid.

*note: maintain the thermometer in the acid throughout the reaction while carefully noting the temperature and controlling it by alternating the jar between the basin of cold water and the basin of hot water. The thermometer can be used as a stirring rod if the solution is gently stirred.

2> Weigh or measure out 70 grams by weight, 18 teaspoons by volume of hexamine and start adding slowly,1/2 teaspoon at a time during a 15 minute period. Maintain the temperature between 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C while stirring. Control by alternating by dipping canning jar in hot and cold basins.

3> When all hexamine has dissolved in the acid, heat the solution to 55 degrees C (131 degrees F) by placing the canning jar in a basin of hot water. Maintain this temperature for 10 (ten) minutes.

4> After heating the solution for 10 minutes, remove the jar from a basin of hot water and place the canning jar to cool to 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

5> When the temperature has reached 20 degrees C, add 3 cups (750ml) of cold water to the solution and a white salt will appear.

       ===============================================
      caution: The white precipitated salt is RDX explosive and should be handled with care from this point on.
       ===============================================

6> Filter the acid/water/RDX solution through a paper towel covering the mouth of a jar. Be sure it is secured soundly with a rubberband.

7> Wash the RDX crystals off the paper towel and into another canning jar, using an additional 3 cups of fresh, cold water. Add a teaspoon of sodium carbonate (or baking soda) to neutralize the acid and stir rapidly for 2-3 minutes, then filter again.

8> The crude product can be dried out on the paper towel filter. It can be used now or can be purified.

9> To purify RDX, fill a quart canning jar 2/3 full of acetone. Heat the acetone by placingthe jar in a basin of hot simmering water, then add RDX a tablespoon at a time, until it completely dissolves in the acetone.

10>After the maximum RDX has disolved in the hot acetone, allow the solution to cool to room temperature, then let stand one more hour.

11>The RDX will form a salt once again. Filter the RDX and spread it out to dry on a paper towel as before.

12>The purified RDX should be stored in a clean canning jar with a tight fitting lid. It can be stored for months without the loss of effectiveness.

*Note: RDX is not too sensative to heat and shock but it is fairly sensative to friction. Care should be exercised when the explosive is to be packed or the dry explosive is to be handled. Using the amounts of chemicals listed in this article, the yield of RDX should be about 1 1/2 ounces.



 EXPLOSIVE FLOUR AND
 USE IN MANUFACTURE OF PLASIC

Materials:

RDX explosive

flour

large sheet of wood

rolling pin


Procedure:
__________

1> Place a teaspoon of RDX crystals on a clean dry wooden board. Use rolling pin to crush crystals into a fine, flour-like consistency.
****Caution: use only a rolling pin, not a block of wood. It is important to crush the RDX crystals into a fine powder rather than using friction between two rubbing surfaces.

2> Mix 80 percent by weight of powdered RDX with 20 percent flour by weight in canning jar with a tight fitting lid by shaking for five minutes.

3> The mixture can be stored in a sealed mixing container for long periods of time before using. It can be disguised by storing it in an original bag of flour.


How to use:

1> This explosive flour is more powerful and brisant than TNT and is easiest to detonate in its powdered form. A blasting cap can provide sufficient shock to set it off.

2> To make into plastic, mix 4 parts weight of explosive flour and 1 part of water. Mix by hand until proper consistency is achieved.

 NITROGLYCERIN

Materials:

Fuming nitric acid

concentrated sulfuric acid (98%)

glycerol or glycerine (water free)

funnel with drip type valve on bottom

air compressor or aquarium pump

air hose

thermometer

salt

ice

pyrex or other bowl

large pan

sodium carbonate  (or baking soda)

beakers

Procedure:

1> Measure out 200 ml of fuming, or 90% pure, nitric acid in beaker and let it equal room temperature.

2> Measure out 300 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid in beaker and let it equal room temperature.

3> Slowly pour the sulfuric acid into the nitric acid, and start letting it cool off in the salt-ice bath that was mede in large pan.

4> Measure out one part (oz,mo,gram,etc.) of glycerol at 15 degrees celcius, and place into dropping funnel.

5> Place six parts of mixed acid into pyrex dish and then place into nitrator tank (the thing with the ice/salt).

6> Start the airflow (an aquarium pump with bubble stone will act just fine) then place into acid mixture.*If an airstone is used, be sure it is acid resistant. Regulate the flow using a screw-type clamp. The air is used to regulate the temperature, so if there is a sudden jump in temperature, then give the nitrator as much air as you safely can.

7> Start the glycerine into the acid mixture in a fine, slow stream, or drop by drop if time is not at premium. Slow the dripping if there is a large temperature change.

8> The temperature should be kept below 22 degrees celcius, and if it raises then slow glycerine dripping and increase the airflow SLOWLY. When the temperature is back to normal, continue as before.
***If the temperature exceeds 50 degrees celcius or a red gas starts being given off then dump the entire nitrator tank into a large tank of cold water!

9> Keep the reaction cool and the air stirring going until the temperature of the reaction comes down to 15 degrees C. and remains there, or a little cooler.

10> Pour the cool solution into plenty of water at room temperature, then let sit for 30 minutes. The nitroglycerin will be the heavy oil on the bottom of the washing tank.

11> Separate the liquid from the oil and save liquid for chloriform separation~. Add pleanty of 38-43 degree C. water to nitroglycerin then mix up again using air then let sit again as above then separate.
~only if you want to do this.

Chloriform Separation: add an equal part of C.P. chloriform to the neutral acids mixture. Mix then let separate. Let the chloriform to be set in the open to let the chloriform evaporate off as much as possible. The remainder left can now be used as in step 16.

12> wash with 4% solution of calcium carbonate.

13> Wash with water again 4 times as in step 11.

14> Give nitroglycerin a final wash with this time a salt water solution. Let sit for 24 hours before separating.

15> Check the nitroglycerin for acidity using litmus paper. It sould show blue and if any red is found, then go back to step 13. It must be neutral to ensure safety and for keeping quantities.

16> Dry nitroglycerin over sulfuric acid in a dessicator (dehydrator). It may take the nitroglycerin several days to dry out.

How to use:

1> Add the nitroglycerin to sawdust (fine) and detonate with blasting cap OR place in pipe then insert blasting cap and detonate. Better results can be achieved using a compound detonator.

 NITROMETHANE LIQUID EXPLOSIVES

Materials:

nitromethane               - available from chemical supply stores

aniline,household ammonia (from glass cleaners),ethylenediamine, or triethylamine

beaker, or measuring cup

scale

Procedure:

1> Place 6%  by weight of sensitizer (aniline,ammonia, etc.) in beaker or bowl then add 94% by weight nitromethane.

2> Mix slowly for 10 seconds then use as below.

 *alternate method*

1> Add 1/2 pint of sensitizer to 1 gallon of nitromethane or add 3.2 lbs. of sensitizer to 50 lbs. of nitromethane.

How to use:

1> This explosive can be used simply by filling a bottle (beverage) then inserting blasting cap in top. Detonation velocity equal to TNT.

 NITROMETHANE SOLID EXPLOSIVES

Materials:

nitromethane

ammonium nitrate (powder) - anhydrous!!

bowl, can, or other rigid cointainer

Procedure:

1> Take 160 grams of ammonium nitrate which has been ground to a fine powder then place in container. Pour in 64 grams of nitromethane. DO NOT MIX! MIXING WILL EFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE EXPLOSIVE!

How to Use:

1> Scoop explosive and place in pipe with end caps then insert balsting cap with fuse. Detonation velocity is equal to that of TNT.

 ASTROLITE LIQUID EXPLOSIVES

Materials:

anhydrous hydrazine    (corrosive & flammable liquid!!)

ammonium nitrate

beaker or other

Procedure:

1> Place  2 parts ammonium nitrate in container then add 1 part of anhydrous hydrazine. DO NOT INHALE FUMES! The fumes given off are toxic.

 *To make Astrolite A-1-5, add aluminum powder to mixture. The aluminum will not dissolve but will improve performance of the explosive by 800 m/s.

How to Use:

1> Pour astrolite in bottle then insert detonator (compound for full effects) then detonate. Detonation velocity 7800 m/s for astrolite G, A-1-5 velocity 8600 m/s .

you can get all the parts for a very small amount of money.



This project requires you a direct connect to the phone line.

Note, that some fone companies object to to customers<thats you>

making such connections for fear of that they might introduce large amounts

of high voltage to the lines. this proj. does not createhigh voltage,

but i wouldnt go callin them and askin if it's ok.

About 3 or four years ago, a real good friend of mine was teaching a ML

Programming course for the Apple 2 series.  I, being a good friend and

quite bored, asked him about cracking Apple games.  He told me that he had

spent the last summer cracking programs.  He showed me a method that he came

up with entirely on his own, boot tracing.  Little did he know that this was

already quite popular but he developed his own method for doing it which from

reading other files about it, is the simplest I've ever seen.  (To give you

an idea, I had SN0GGLE (I've never played the game but a friend had it on

disk.) completely loaded into memory ready to be dumped in about 12 minutes.)

Ok, first of all, ALL programs can be boot traced. The only thing is that some

may not be easily converted into files.  The only programs that you should try

if you aren't real good at ML, are ones that load completely into memory. Also

to do this you will need a cassette recorder. (don't worry the program we will

save won't take too long to save, and if all goes well it will only be saved

loaded once.) I hate learning the theory behind anything so I'm not gonna

give any theory behind this. If you want the theory, read some other phile

that does this the hard way.



First make sure your cassette recoder works by BLOADing some program and

typing:

CALL -151

AA60.AA73

You'll see something that looks like this:

AA60-30 02 xx xx xx xx xx xx

AA68-xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx

AA70-xx xx 00 08

or whatever...The 30 02 is the length ($0230 bytes). The 00 08 is the starting

address ($0800).  Oh well, now you need to try and save the program. Type:

800.A2FW   (A2F=$800+$230-1)

1000<800.A2FM

800:00 N 801<800.A2FM

800.A2FR

1000<800.A2FV



Once you are sure that the cassette works, (by the way do be stupid and try

that on a //c!) we can get to the good stuff...

First move the ROM boot-up code into RAM...(all steps will be from the

monitor * prompt.)

8600<C600.C6FFM

86F9:5C FF

(Now load in step 1 of the boot.)

8600G

C0E8  (turn the drive off

                     Volume One, Issue Two, Phile #8 of 9





                     The Hackers Guide to RSTS-E 8.0



                       Data Line.  TWX 650-240-6356





            Rsts is one of the most versatile operating systems available for

the PDP-11 series of computers.  It can emulate both RSX and RT-11 (though not

fully), and is often a choice where multiple concurrent operating systems must

be online.  I was a system manager on an 11-23 for about a year and learned a

fair amount about the OS (perhaps forgetting a good deal in the interim).  This

phile applies to release 8.0 and the entire 7 series.  By the way, version 9.0

is it - DEC is discontinuing RSTS with that release and using 9.0 as a bridge

to VMS for the PDP-11 series.  The logon will tell which version you are

hacking.



        If the SYSTAT-before-logon has been disabled (It probably has), no big

worry.  Account 1,2 must be present on the system and contains most of the

system utilities.  On booting, the account is called at least 8 times to put

batch processors and spoolers online.  Changing [1,2]'s passwords in the

command file is a tedious process - most system managers are too lazy, so it

won't change often.  Oh yes, the default PW for 1,2 is SYSLIB.  This knowledge

should cut hacking time considerably for many systems. When you get in, RUN

$MONEY.  This gives all accounts, KCT's (Billing units), accesses, time on

system, and PASSWORDS, if you ask.  Don't reset the system when it asks, it

merely zeroes the program and not the hardware, but could tip someone off that

he system had been hacked.



           Personally, I like running out of a new account, so RUN $REACT.

Pick a new account #, making sure the first number (before the comma) is a "1"

to get full privilege.  Accept defaults for disk placement.  As for Cluster

size, I prefer 4.  It's large enough to get fast disk access, but small enough

so that little space is wasted for small files.  Cluster size is shown (CLU or

CLS) on MONEY and on DIR/FULL.  Follow conventions and you'll stand less chance

of being noticed.



        RSTS has some of the most complete HELP files short of a CDC mainframe.

HELP HELP will give the forst screen of the nested menus.  Be sure to do this

from a privileged account or you'll miss about half of the best commands. HELP

SYSTAT will give a thorough overview of the system setup & status program.



              RUN $SYSTAT (or just SYS if the Concise Command Language is set

up normally).  On the left is a report of te system users including all

background jobs (print spoolers, batch processors and the like), their

keyboard, and what state they are in (RN=run, ^C=waiting for input, DCL=logged

on, no program running, DR=Disk Read, DW=Disk Write).  To the right is a list

of busy I/O devices.  At the end is a full report of Disk names (DR:=Hard, DU:=

floppy), and space allocated/free.  To cause some havoc pick a target KB,

preferrably one running a financial type program.  Note the Job # in the

leftmost column.  Simply type UT KILL # and he's totally gone, without so much

as a logoff message.  If done during a Disk Write - get out the backups!!



        If just tying up resources is more your game, RUN $VT50PY.  It gives

the utilization readout on a 20 second basis, or whenever a key is struck.  The

program itself uses a lot of CPU time, so when the Interval <20>? comes up,

enter a 1 and watch the EXEC percent go through the roof.



        If wasting paper is more your style, find the KB: number of the printer

(KB0: is the console) from SYSTAT when it's in use, or try LP1:.  Find a long

text file (DIR [*,*]*.txt) and COPY LP1:=filename.  Don't forget the colon when

referring to keyboards or printers.



        Try DTR.  If DATATRIEVE is online, you can set up a database of huge

proportions.  Again, full help is available.  SET GUIDE (configure your

terminal for VT-100) and it takes you through every step.
