Subj: SINGLE FREQUENCY PHREAKING

Have you ever wondered how those blind
kids, mentioned in the Oct. 1971 
Esquire article, were able to whistle
free long distance calls? You don't
really suppose they were whistling
multifrequency tones, do you? My 
research point to In-band Single
Frequency Signaling as the probable
method used. This method of signaling
has largly been replaced by
multifrequency, but is still in use in
some areas. If you want to experiment
with it, you need a dial mechanism of
the type used on rotary phones and a
2600 hz oscillator. Wire it up so the
momentary breaks representing digit
pulses oass bursts of 2600 hz. Example:
the digit "3" would  be three bursts of
the 2600 hz tone. Because this is a
purely AC method of signaling, the tone
can be acoustically coupled to a phone.
It is used very much like a blue box
except that after the initial 2600 hz
disconnect you simply dial the desired
number. Of course the original organic
method is still possible. If you have
perfect pitch and terrific control of
you whistler, you could still do it
like those naughty blind kids of old.
(I checked myself with a frequency
counter and found that I can't whistle
2600 hz worth a hoot). Joe Engressia
descovered this method and was
eventually busted for using it. After a
short stay in jail, he was released
with a warning. He is currently working
for a small independant phone company.
Be advised that this method of
phreaking is just as dangerous as blue
boxing. If this has all been "Greek: to
you, then go to a good technical 
library and look up The Bell System
Technical Journal for November 1960,
"Signaling Systems for Control of 
Telephone Switching". While you're
there, look in the Gerneral Periodical
Directory under "telephone". Articles
with "phreak" or "freak" in their
titles are susally about methods the
phone company is using to catch you.
This too is an important part of your
education.

Gee you guys have done well. now its my
turn to show what ive been playing with
for a while. Some of this you may have
seen on another board (my message on
that board of course, not someone else's)
dod as everyong is calling it is
800-368-3656 very simple system. go
ahead and type help then itll say go
then if you act like you dont know
where your ass is itll give you a menu.
at this menu i typed A then i typed D
then for a username i typed ERICKSON
but i dont have a password becuase i
havent had time to murder the system
yet. The 800 is probably traced by no
becuase its been on a few baords but
you chancetakers(including me) would be
less he sitant not to dial it. Rca
something or other is at 800-526-
3881 and a voice activated system is on
a new 800 exchange 537-2000 hard to
find passwords but not their user ids.
a password for 800-422-0211 is 999# but
i dont have a password and there are
several several accounts of course,
three digits most likely. then try
8332,651123 on:
800 255 0129, 548 0800, and 372 0773 if
in texas. another little toy is
800-328-0861 an  account is 99999999
(thats 8 9s) then pound. so far only
found function is 3*. how boring, i
know. help me crack the is wierd number
800-243-7676 hit all kinds of digits
then #
and all itll say is "error". also you
may dial 800 abd these numbers and
their codes for both U.S. and overseas
extenstion: 328-2446
100,101,106,108,120,175, or 278 or 9
and there is
.        lots more too it 9387 then
163,190,191 and then some (like the
usual 9 and 8) 1470 accounts too easy
to find. 3808 54587,54983,74060, then
anything like 126-199 or 5,7,9 also
8957 and the code is aleady dead, must
be dangerous. LOGIN HUT HUT at @ at
212035506533 at night 800-243-3232 can
be used to dial out. (let the guy
answer his stupid phone, you say
nothing, he'll hang up and the system
will give you his local dial tone.
nifty uh?) 011-44-379-2587 is some

LOCAL NEWS, STOCK REPORTS, JOKES AND
CHILDRENS STORIES-  THE MAY SOON ALL
BE AVAILABLE FOR A SMALL FEE AS PART OF
A NEW SERVICE CALLED AUDIOTEXT.

THE NEW SERVICE WILL BE SOLD TO
SPONSORS SUCH AS BANKS PUBLISHERS AND
RADIO STATIONS ACCORDING TO C&P TELCO.

THE CONTENET OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SPONSOR. THIS
SERVICE IS THE SAME AS THAT PROVIDED TO
NEW YORK CITIZENS, AND WILL ALSO USE THE
976 PREFIX THIS WILL BE THE FIRST
SERVICE OF THIS TYPE OFFERED TO
CHARLESTON WV, AND WILL PROVIDE MUCH
ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE LOCAL CALLERS.
HOWEVER, I HAVE SERIOUS DOUBTS AS TO
THEM GETTING CARRIED AWAY AS NY DID
WITH THE SER. THERE WILL MORE THAN
LIKLY NOT BE PORNO LINES IF I KNOW SOME
OF THE UPPER CRUST TYPES HERE IN
CHARLESTON.

IT DOES APPEAR THAT ABOUT 70 LOCAL
BUSINESSES HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST
IN THE SERVICE. BECAUSE OF THE LARGE
MARKETS AVAILABLE TARIFFS WILL BE FILED
ON FEB 15 AND 17 FOR VIR AND MARYLAND &
DC PROSPECTIVLY, ROANOAK WILL BE
INCLUDED IN THE VIRGINIA SER. OF
AUDIOTEXT. C&P (CHARLESTON) WOULD LIKE
TO SEE THIS SERVICE IN EFECT BY MAY 1,
84. SO SPREAD THE WORD. AND IF THIS MSG
SOUNDS A LITTLE LIKE A COMPANY MEMO
THAT BECAUSE THATS WHERE THE
INFORMATION CAME FROM.

WOULD YOU EXPECT ANY LESS FROM

RUN BY AN APPLE ][, AND I WENT DOWN TO
THEIR OFFICE, GAVE THEM SOME WARES, AND
JUST HAPPENED TO 'BORROW' A COPY OF THE
BACKUP DISKS FOR THEIR SYSTEM !! HERE
ARE SOME CODES:
6135935,6135938,6135940. FROM THE
SOFTWARE RUNNING THE SYSTEM, I AM
POSITIVE THAT ALL CODES BEGIN WITH
A '61'. THAT EFFECTIVELY MAKES THE
CODES 5 DIGITS, WHICH SHOULD BE EASIER
TO HACK. LATER ON....
