7. FIGHTER/SHIELD OVERLOAD BUG:  Ships have built-in limits for fighters
   and shields -- the Scout Marauder is only supposed to carry 250
   fighters and 100 shields.  If you use negative numbers when
   transferring fighters and shields through the corporate transfer
   menus, however, those limits don't apply.  If you have a teammate
   *take* you a negative number *from* you instead of giving you a positive
   number, he/she can load your ship with up to 32,767 shields and 32,767
   fighters.  (For a faster way to overload with shields, try using
   negative numbers in your citadel. <g>)  However you do it, be warned:
   if you dock at a port with extra fighters and shields, you will lose them!

8. SO MUCH FOR STARDOCK!:  A Scout Marauder, overloaded with 32,767
   fighters and at least 20,000 shields using the methods outlined
   above, has very good odds of destroying StarDock or any of the Class
   0 ports.  Just load the ship up and attack:  *DON'T* break off your
   attack until you're out of fighters, and you have about 2-in-3 odds
   of success.

9. THE MORONIC FERRENGI:  The game makes neutralizing the Ferrengi very,
   very easy.  All you need to do to insulate yourself against their
   attacks, for example, is carry one fighter and many shields.  When a
   Ferrengi attacks you, he will only do 0-2 damage points at a time.
   Even worse:  to knock the Ferrengi completely out of the game, all
   you have to do is destroy the fighters in their home sector and
   deploy 3,000 of your own fighters in the sector.  From that point on,
   they won't regenerate, even if they still own Ferrengal:  all that'll
   be left are the Ferrengi already wandering around the galaxy.  In the
   first few weeks of the game, this tactic costs less than a million
   credits.

10. THE INFALLIBLE CLOAK:  Buy cloaks.  They're a great bargain.  In
   1.03, it's impossible to attack a cloaked ship, and regardless of
   what the docs say, cloaks *do not* fail.  Compared to the cost of
   being blown up, 25,000 credits a day is trivial.

11. SHIELDS AND P-MISSILES:  The docs are also wrong about the effect of
   shields on the p-wave.  P-missiles *do* work against shielded planets.
   They also work against shielded ships and ships parked in FedSpace.

12. THE USELESS SENTINEL:  Don't buy the Tholian Sentinel.  Period.  The
   Sentinel is supposed to have 4:1 odds when defending a planet against
   an invader.  This feature doesn't work.  If an invader attacks the
   *ship* first -- rather than trying to land and *then* attacking the
   ship -- the Sentinel only gets 1:1 combat odds.

13. MANY FERRENGI AND ALIENS:  When a sysop rerolls the game with
   BIGBANG, several files (including CONVO.DAT, WALLDAT.DAT, and, most
   important, FERRENGI.DAT and ALIENS.DAT) are not properly initialized.
   Some new games will be swarming with powerful aliens and Ferrengi.
   Sysops should remember to delete these four files when restarting
   games.

14. THE "6666" BUG:  Always set your military reaction level to 0% if
   you have more than 12,000-13,000 fighters on your planet.  If an
   invader attacks without a p-missile, the invader has more than 26,000
   fighters on his ship, and your MRL is greater than zero, *all* of your
   fighters will attack him and will be destroyed -- even if you have
   many more fighters than you should need to kill the invader.

Again, this list is *anything* but complete:  it's just an attempt to
outline the strategically most important bugs.  Hope it's useful.

Take care,
