I'D LIKE TO PRESENT, THE HIKER PHREAK AND "I LIKE CHINESE"...

I LIKE CHINESE

SPOKEN INTRO:
The world today seems absolutely
crackers,
With nuclear bombs to blow us all
sky high.
There are fools and idiots sitting on the trigger,
It's depressing and it's senseless
and that's why...

INTRO:
I like Chinese,
I like Chinese,
They only come up to your knees,
Yet they're always friendly, and
they're ready to please.

VERSE:
I like Chinese,
I like Chinese,
There's nine hundred million of
them in the world today,
You'd better learn to like them,
that's what I say.

CHORUS:
I like Chinese,
I like Chinese,
They come from a long way
overseas,
But they're cute and they're
cuddly, and they're ready to please.

VERSE:
I like Chinese food,
The waiters never are rude,
Think of the many things they've
done to impress,
There's Maoism, Taoism, I Ching
and Chess.

CHORUS:
So I like Chinese,
I like Chinese,
I like their tiny little trees,
Their Zen, their ping-pong, their
yin and yang-ese.

VERSE:
I like Chinese thought,
The wisdom that Confucious
taught,
If Darwin is anything to
shout about,

The Chinese will survive us all
without any doubt.

CHORUS:
So I like Chinese,
I like Chinese,
They only come up to your knees,
Yet they're wise and they're witty,
and they're ready to please.

VERSE: (IN CHINESE) [I'm afraid the computer hasn't a Chinese key]

CHORUS:
I like Chinese,
I like Chinese,
Their food is guaranteed to please,
A fourteen, a seven, a nine
and lychees.

CHORUS:
I like Chinese,
I like Chinese,
I like their tiny little trees,
Their Zen, their ping-pong, their
yin and yang-ese.

FADE:
I like Chinese,
I like Chinese...
