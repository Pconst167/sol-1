2/60: DOS 5

Has anyone had a chance to really work with DOS5.  We're thinking of upgrading 
in the office and had such a problem with 4 that everyone has become very 
leery.  (You know, if it ain't broke, don't fix it)  I'm sure you'll find this 
hard to believe, but I'd really just like to have a month where things go 
almost smoothly or -- even (dare I think it?) normal, whatever that is, you 
know, without having to go through everyone's directories and clean up 
software.  I'm also getting very close to convincing this paradigm that I work 
for to go network!!! to even use a tape backup!!!  Six months ago, this man 
thought using ink in a pen was advanced.  Anyway, I'd like to move up to 5 if 
I have enough feedback from you guys that helps me intelligently convince him 
that we would benefit.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.

it has a few utilities that can be found elsewhere (norton's), but it does 
load ito high memory, thus freeing up a great bit of memory over dos4.  there 
have been some problems with windows, but the readme file in the package 
details how to cure problems with many software packages.  i say give it a 
try.  there have been few problems, that i have heard of, and most of them 
were detailed in that readme file.

i am watching a story on CNN right now about new portable computers with flat 
color vga monitors.  they look great, with awesome color capabilities.  the 
screen is made up of loads of tiny transistors that control the color, rather 
than the picture tubwe.  only one american manufacturer is making them, dolch, 
but toshiba and nec are making them elsewhere.

them off of batteries if you didn't mind swapping them out every hour or so!

you when it's all in a compact COLOR unit no bigger than your average laptop

that helps some, but you still have to specify the EXACT path for 4DOS to go 
to, and to as many levels down as the directory is.

With LCD31A you can change to ANY directory at ANY level on ANY disk drive, 
with only a partial name.
For instance "ch dow" or "ch own" goes from any other directory to my 
"C:\COMM\DOWN" directory.  "ch b" takes me from anywhere to "C:\COMM\DOWN\B"

I also like 4DOS's move command, but I hear MS-DOS 5.0 has that now, along 
with the command line editor.

Is that Microsoft and Central Point Software teamed up and came out with DOS 
4.01 that could do some neat tricks (like the command editor...)  But nothing 
truly new except for the ability to move some of the TSR's to High Memory.

    Anybody who actually has had a review wish to comment.  I am only going by 
others word, and want to find out wether it is worth upgrading to or not.

... than just an enhanced 4.01 with HIMEM and UMB (High memory and Upper memory
Blocks.  I just LOVE Acronyms! :) ).  It's got a few neat features, some of
which I haven't even BEGUN to start using.  DOSKEY adds two features that DOS
has been lacking for QUITE some time.  The DOSKEY TSR (another acronym) keeps a
'command history'.  You can use the Up and Down arrows to look up a command
that you typed awhile back, unlike the F3 key which only recalls the command
just executed.  You can also search for commands in the history and stuff like
that.  VERY useful when you type the same command over and over again!  DOSKEY
also has macros.  You can string several common statements together into one
key.  Like, I have this HD menu program.  To start it up, I have to type

cd C:\3dmenu
c:
3dmenu

so, I just made a macro (called menu) that types all that for me!  

There's also the DOS shell, that lets you access programs and files from a
Windows-like environment.  It comes with a watered-down version of Microsoft's
QuickBasic, and a nice editor replacement for EDLIN.  Then, there's stuff like
the catalog telling you how much space is LEFT on a disk, as well as how much
is in use.  There's the MEM command, so you can check free system RAM and see
how you're doing on RAM use.

I like DOS 5.0 so far.  It only cost me $60 (most places around here have it
for $70.  I got mine a CompuAdd up off of 70), and it's worth it so far.

Only one problem with it.  I'm trying to get EMM386.EXE installed, so I can
load stuff into UMB's.  Only problem is, Windows 3.0 won't run in Standard or
386 Enhanced mode when I try to use the RAM or NOEMS switch.  I know why it
won't work with NOEMS, but the RAM switch is supposed to eliminate the problem
Anybody else have problems with Windows 3.0 and DOS 5.0's EMM386.EXE???

Original by : Gardener #206 @9955


sounds like, except for the high-memory support, most of DOS5.0 has already 
been available as the shareware COMMAND.COM replacement "4DOS".  It has 
command history, a move command, mem command, versatile DIR command with space 
used/left displayed, and tons more like the SELECT command that I've only used 
a few times.  SELECT is invoked with a drive/file wildcard spec and a command, 
and then you select files from the list on screen point&shoot like, and 4DOS 
will run the command for each selected file.

QBASIC and the shell, if it's better than 4.01's shell, are probably worth 
some of the price.  A few extra low-ram K makes up the rest.
Who cares about the new editor?  There are at least a hundred  editors of all 
kinds out there as pd/freeware/shareware/commercial.  Pick the one you like 
best.  I'm sure I'll still prefer VDE 1.61 to any editor DOS has to offer, and 
VDE's freeware.

  If there was that one extra decision you needed on making you get the new
 MS-DOS, then the new Shell would probably tip the scales for you.  First of
 all, if you have Windows, don't even worry about the Shell.  BUT, if you do
 not use Windows, then the Shell is the closest thing to it.  Can't run
 Windows-specific applications from it, but it looks and works quite similar
 to version 3.0.

Even looks good in CGA ...

Yes, you can still get better memory savings using QEMM.  In fact, if you use 
QEMM and don't use "DOS=HIGH" in config.sys, you'll end up with more memory 
than if you let DOS try to load itself high.  The reason for this is that QEMM 
is better at loading DOS high than DOS itself is.  Not surprising, really, 
since QEMM is many years and many versions old, while this is the first 
release of DOS with this capability.  I think Microsoft would have been much 
wiser to license QEMM from Quarterdeck (like they licensed the Mirror software 
from Central Point Software).  It's probably going to be some time before DOS 
is as good at managing memory as QEMM is.  But at least it's finally moving in 
the right direction.

If it's a program written to run under DOS, it doesn't matter if you run it 
under OS/2, it won't be able to use any more memory than it normally would (it 
might have more of the <640k area free, but that's it).  It would still have 
to use Extended or Expanded memory to get anything beyond that, and you 
certainly don't need OS/2 to do that.

Heck, I can do better than that.  I've had a QEMM system set up with 730k of 
conventional memory free.  There's a Quarterdeck program called VIDHIGH (or 
something like that) that will re-map the video memory to low and give you a 
total 760k free (out of which you need a little for the DOS and (for me)

  Man, I wouldn't even know what to do with all that memory!  I'm happy with
  614k and EMS as it is!  =)

With all the normal drivers (biggest are mouse & smartdrv) that gave me about 
540K in 4.01 loaded, I now have 615K free.  It does prevent me from running 
both a 512K smartdrv and a 713K ramdrive, and it does prevent Win3 from 
running in Standard mode.

I have a patch somewhere that lets you use a mouse with telix. I'll see if I 
can find it and get back to you.

I have a 1.3 Meg Ramdisk and a 2.3 Meg / 820k Hyperdisk cache set up with
setver, hyperscreen, ansi, mirror, and doskey and I can still run Win3 in
standard mode...  I have a '286 with 4 Meg and only 570k or so free at the
DOS5 prompt....

but two megs total ram.  Sure, if you have four then you can have huge 
ramdrive/smartdrive allocations.  I had my 2 meg full up with smartdrv and 
ramdrive (what else is the extra ram useful for anyway under 4.01? ), so when 
I went and threw the TSRs and drivers up in high RAM, obviously something had 
to go.

YEP, QEMM will get you 655K or so, depending what TSR's you have, and what 
stuff can LOADHI. that's what i did on this 386SX.

I'd watch it with QEMM version 6.  I've been using it for about a month now 
and it definitely has some bugs.

I'm curious as to why someone would still want to use 4DOS with Dos 5.0.  
Seems like most of the nice things about 4DOS have been built into DOS 5.0 
(macros and command line editor, for example).

the F9 filesearch ability of 4DOS?  Or the aliasing ability?  Or
batch-to-memory files?  Does it have the command stack; and if so, is it as
advanced as 4DOS'?

If not, one of these may be why people would still want their DOS 5.0 to have
4DOS.  If not, I can't figure out why they want it either.

has a command stacker that is supposed to compare favorablly with 4DOS. I
haven't checked about its file search capablility since i used Norton's for
that. As far as aliasing, I'm not sure what you mean. If you would explain
perhaps I could check for you.

It doesn't have the built-in filesearch like 4DOS, but then, I use WHEREIS, 
which is much better than the 4DOS search anyways (it will search across 
whatever drives you specify, inside all kinds of archives if you want, and has 
many other advanced features).  No aliasing either, which I would like.  It 
does have "batch to memory" files (macros) and a very nice command stack 
editor.  It also has the ability to string multiple dos commands on a line 
(you separate them with ctrl-t), which allows you to make batch files that are 
much cleaner (takes out a lot of the crazy if/goto's).

Could very easily be accomplished by making small macros (batch files in 
memory) to handle the aliasing for you.

Thanks
