Has anyone out there had any experience with the Dark Avenger virus?  I think 
I have two strains of it.  One is called Dark Avenger, and the other is Dark 
Avenger 2000.  Problem is, SCANV82 only detects Dark Avenger.  So does 
CLEAN82.  I found the other strain using a different scanning program.  I 
finally traced the DA 2000 virus down to one file, but SCAN said that it was 
clean.  But if I ran the file, SCAN detected it in memory, but still not on 
disk.  Needless to say, I deleted the file, but I'm worried about other files 
that might be infected in the same way.  I don't have access to the program 
that found it anymore.  Any suggestions?  I need to know where to get other 
anti-virus programs besides SCAN and CLEAN.  I also need to know where the 
newest version of VSHIELD can be obtained.   Anyone?   Anyone ?  HELP!
                                  Thanks,
                                  The Controller

From: The Radio Control Model Plane BBS [818-919-2879]

I just got a "JOSHI" Virus on my HD about a week ago.  It did something funny 
to my boot sector so that I couldn't boot by pressing the "ALT-DEL" process.  
Anyway, I used "Central Point" and "NORTON VIRUS" scan to detect and get rid 
of it, only after a week later..... I get a warning again!  It warns me that a 
JOSHI VIRUS is present, and that I should use Central Points Virus Scanner 
(CPAV.EXE) to clean it.  But when I do this, the Scanner doesn't detect 
anything!  The program I run is called NDD (Norton Disk Doctor) which when 
scanning the HD gives me the warning sign.
     This is my second computer that the virus is on, and it's got about 200 
Meg worth of stuff I don't care to delete.  Can anybody tell me why it's 
giving me these warnings, because when I run the Central Point & Norton Virus 
scanners, they don't detect anything.  I am booting of a "safe" floppy.  So 
it's not like stupid or anything.  I also tried putting in a new Command.com 
and the two system hidden fils, but I still get the message.  Apparently, the 
cleaning process still has left some or all of this virus somewhere in my HD.  
Any suggestions?  I don't even use the comptuer right now.  I've written to 
Central Point, but I don't know how long this is goin to take.  Help!!!

This Virus was discovered in India in Mid 1990.

This Virus can be hard to remove, if your not careful... From what I have 
read, you have NDD, if so, then you should have NU (Right?)...

It was your HD right?

Next fire up NU and take a look at your partition tables first two bytes, and 
see if they are EB 1F, if so, your infected...  This is a Jump Instruction 
that moves you to Track 0, Sector 2-6 which contains the rest of the Viral 
Code.

To Remove the Joshi Virus:
    #1 Shut off the system (Wait a Minute or Two)
    #2 Boot from a KNOWN CLEAN WRITE PROTECTED floppy DOS disk
    #3 Back-Up your hard drive(s)
    #4 Perform a LOW LEVEL FORMAT & Re-Partition the HD
    #5 Restore your Data, and re-check your work for problems.

This should do it......  Sorry it isn't that easy, but you have run into a 
little bugger of a Virus...

     You can try McAffee at 408-988-5138 or 408-988-4004.  These are BBS 
numbers.  You can download the latest version of Vshield, and be "almost" 
certain that you're getting the original pacakage.  But it's in the San Jose 
Area!  It's in California, but it's still San JOse!  They have version 84 out. 
I don't know if it'll help.  The new scan 84 I have doesn't detect a "Joshi" 
virus on my other computer, but the Anti-Virus by Central Point does detect 
this.  So I don't really know if it's that good.

I tried Vshield 84, Scan, and Clean on my hard disk.  Nothing detects this 
virus.  It says its a "JOSHI" virus..... this happens when I put "Central 
Point's Antivirus" loaded.... and then I run programs like "FDISK, NDD 
(Norton), and Speedisk" which all checks the boot sectors and "partition 
tables."  Bootsafe comes out with a warning saying "Joshi Virus Present, clean 
with 'CPAV', but when I run this program, it does not detect this virus.  It 
does not detect "anything"!  It scans the whole disk, and says 'no virus 
found'.  This is the same with "McAffee and Norton".  Nothing detects this 
"virus" except "Bootsafe"!  I don't think the virus is there, but who knows!  
My friends still insists that the virus is just what was left after I cleaned 
out the hard disk about 2 months back.  
   I've since then re-partitioned and reformatted my hard disk.  Still, when I 
run Bootsafe, I get the same results!  I need help!  Anybody????

1.   It is a beta test version, nit yet released as fully working, or:
2.   It is anothet of those phoneys, a virus spreader itself.

that you don't even HAVE a virus.  Virus detection programs look for certain 
"signatures" that indicate the presence of a given virus.  Sometimes other 
programs may have a pettern of bytes that is the same as one of these 
signatures without actually con taining the virus.  So your detection program 
senses this pattern and says "Whoa!" with no problem at all being there.

I suggest that you spend the loot to call McAfee's bbs and ask them about it. 
They are very helpful...

has a bug that it almost always says you have a virus, whether you do or not.

I have seen many times that progrma doing this, even on brand spanky new drives
out of the box.  I wouldn't worry about it too much.  If you are THAT worried,
call the maker of bootsafe or CP....someone there might be able to help, but
they'll probably tell you the same thing (not bootsafe though....<G>)

Do NOT low-level format an IDE hard drive!!  You will ruin the drives.  Get
the Spinrite program.  It will tell you if your drives can be low-level
formatted or not.  But I can assure you that an IDE drive can NOT be
low-level formatted!

Scan V84 was definitely out at the time of that post, maybe you should try 
again. 

I have all three utils on my HD right now, downloaded from this board.

Just keep looking til you find it.  McAfee's scanner will find the Josi virus. 
I suggest you try:

SCAN C:*.* /A
SCAN D:*.* /A

The book you got with your Hard Drive is correct.  Do not low level format it!

SCANV84 has been out for quite a while now (I believe since the 9th of this 
month)... I am a Beta Tester for McAfee, and I did have the Beta Scan V84 
since the First of the month..  

Now Read This

Scan V.84 is the Newest, it isn't a Trojan/Virus/Hack  Get it, use it, love 
it...
