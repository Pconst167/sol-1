here's the lyrics you requested...                
                
                
         SIT ON MY FACE

Sit on my face and tell me that
you love me
I'll sit on your face and tell you
I love you too
I love to hear you o-ra-lise
When I'm between your thighs
You blow me away.

Sit on my face and let my lips
embrace you
I'll sit on your face and then
I'll love you truly
Life can be fine if we both
sixty nine
If we sit on our faces
In all sorts of places
And play till we're blown away.


Hope that settles the arguement...
