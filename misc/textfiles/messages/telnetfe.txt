   Re: LOOKS LIKE A HACKER

I've encountered a certain situation twice in the past week that leaves
me with a few questions. Upon connecting to my Telenet indial node, in
between attempts to connect to either a Telenet service or outdial 
modem, I've gotten the following message:
         CONNECTION FROM  301 18A

The first time this happened, whoever was on the other end began typing
several obscenities. Tonight when this happened, the person attempted
to generate a false "@" prompt. Whoever was doing this was trying to
lure me into typing in my PCP acct and password. Sure enough, when I fed
the prompt a made-up acct, hit return...I got back what I know was a 
misleading prompt.  

I don't think my acct/pw got to him/her, but it scares me that someone
can make such a connection. I called up the Telenet service number to
report this, but all I was told is that nothing can be done except to
change the password, at MY expense. Anybody else have this happen to
them?

   Re: IMPORTANT

The *PCP HACKERS* are working to show PCP what we think of their awful 
service and policies. We have been STEALING PCP IDs and PWs and using 
them. We can HACK into TELENET and connect to your indial modem without 
you even knowing it. Then we watch you hammer at a distant modem with 
those dialing scripts and it fills our screen with your pw and id. You 
don't see your pw but *WE DO* and we have hundreds of PCP IDs and PWs. 
Your TELENET  *CONTRACT*  makes YOU responsible for all charges to your 
ID, and PCP just sent out bills from back in September! We want more 
outdial modems and less BUSY. We want responsive Customer Service. We 
want a realistic CONTRACT, 300 and 2400 baud. SCREW PCP until then!!!

I don't know if message #6057 is for real or not ( I find some of the 
claims hard to believe ), but perhaps PC-Pursuit should make it just a 
little easier for users to change their passwords.  I understand it's 
quite a nose bleed to get one changed.

(regarding a message on "hacking" PC-Pursuit)
.
    I just called Customer Service and expressed concern about it.
Unfortunately, they say it's entirely possible.  And that they're
working on the problem.

    That was not my experience.  I changed mine last Monday.  Took
less than 10 minutes on the phone (the 1-800-TELENET number), and
the new id/password was in effect immediately.

   Re: YOUR INTENTIONS

    You claim your aim is to get better customer service from Telenet,
more modems, et al.  Has it ever occured to you that your "screw the
system" attitude may be causing more trouble than it solves?  Screwing
up Telenet's ability to provide service seems unlikely to result in
better service.
    That's always struck me as an argument against violent revolts;
from socialist to anarchist.  Patterned after my comment above:
Blowing up a rich man's house does not put a roof over a poor man's
head.  See you in the Issues area if you care to debate it.

   Re: ID PASSWORD SNACTCHING

If password pirates are able to steal PC Pursuit ids and passwords,then 
it is possible for them to steal the ids and passwords of business 
users that use the Telenet network. Such stolen ids and passwords would 
enable such pirates to make illegal international data calls at someone 
else's expense. THE ENTIRE TELENET PACKET SWITCHING NETWORK MAY BE IN 
DANGER!  If this is true, hopefully there is someway that Telenet can
correct this security problem. We could see the termination of the PC 
Pursuit service because of this!

Re: 6057, 6062
 
It's for real.  I've gotten a new user id and two new passwords in the
past two weeks because of this situation.  It's not true that these
jokers can intercept your session completely undetected, though.  If
you see a message such as "CONNECTION FROM xxx yyy", disconnect 
immediately or contact customer service on a second line.

Re: 6057
 
As I see it, the only thing you're accomplishing is to destroy this 
system completely.  I'm sure we won't see any of the things you 
mentioned (more outdial modems, less BUSY, responsive service, better 
contract, 300 and 2400 bps) any sooner if Telenet has to spend 
considerable time and effort plugging leaks in their security.  In fact, 
we may never see them at all.  Here's hoping they catch you soon....
