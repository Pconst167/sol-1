[ Reply to ] Spock and command of Enterprise...
[Msg Status] No reply needed.
__________________________________________________________________

  He was also in command during the episode "The Doomsday Device".  When Kirk 
was aboard the Constellation, Matt Decker assumed command to go chasing after 
the planet killer after he destroyed his own ship. McCoy wanted Spock to take 
over, but Spock quoted regulations, saying that if McCoy could certify him 
medically unfit then he would take command. Unfortunately, McCoy hadn't had 
time to run a physical on Decker.
  Later, when communications had been restored to the Constellation, Kirk 
found out Decker was in command and ordered Spock to take over.  This was also 
against regulations, but Kirk gambled his career that Decker wouldn't report 
to Starfleet(besides, Decker was clearly looney/in shock over the loss of his 
ship).
  The funny thing about this episode is why McCoy didn't use his authority as 
Chief Medical Officer to order Decker in for a physical.  In many other 
episodes it is made clear that if the doctor judges(on his sayso) that someone 
is acting erratically, he must undergo a physical.

Why bring Denise Crosby back?  Have you seen that delicious form she walks 
around in?  Many Trekkies watch for it, me included.

I thought "In Theory" was one of the most entretaining Treks of the season.  
Data's antics even had my Dad(non-Trekkie) laughing.  Picards best line was, 
"Now would be a good time O'Brian." in his usual deadpan.  

As for Data's "fledgling emotions" remember him telling Tasha's sister that 
familliarity with a person made communicating easier?  I nearly shed a tear 
when he said he would delete the appropriate program.  Emotion indeed.

I suppose that the obscure Enterprise was not Captained by a flamboyant 
personality.  One not trusted with all of the Federations toughest problems or 
likely to get into trouble.  

I also think that the Picard Maneuver(ie tug) shows that uniform designers 
will never catch up with designers of casual wear in the comfort area.  Is 
that too strange?

My thinking is that promoting Picard to Admiral and Riker to Captain would be 
great if we only want Patrick Stewart in SOME of the episodes. The problem 
with him continuing on as a flag officer on board the Enterprise is that the 
Enterprise is not a "fleet" vessel. It operates on its own too much of the 
time for it to be a true flagship of a group of ships.

By the way, I just read Vendetta, too. I thought it was well written, and it 
kept my attention better than most other SF, not just other Star Trek novels. 
Peter David did a very solid job of writing, and of trying to tie up loose 
ends. The story was basically believable, although there were some tiny 
problems caused by the TOS vs. TNG warp speeds. He leaned heavily on the 
technical manuals, however, and really tried to do his best. Good job.

The new issue of the Star Trek: Next Generation comic had a note in it that 
there was still some sort of Tasha Yar flashback or something planned, and 
that they had gotten that information from Denise Crosby. Unless this was 
deliberate misinformation, we may still see some surprises.

    I saw a time line chart somewhere that showed the evolution of the 
Enterprise from Aircraft Carrier to NCC-1701D, and on this time line it 
mentions that Kirk is killed in an accident on NCC-1701A, leaving Sulu in 
command. NCC-1701B had a VERY short-lived history, as it was supposedly 
destroyed in a warp accident trying to reach the Galatic Center. NCC-1701C was 
reported destroyed in battle with the Romulans (big suprise here, eh?), and 
finally NCC-1701D is now flitting around the universe looking for trouble, and 
finding it.

RE: Better yet ...

I can see several reasons why the transporter is not used radomly. First their 
are regulations on a starship that could prevent that. As to reasons for 
regulations... gee their could be any number of ridiculas(sp) reasons. 
example.... Some high ranking officer thinks starship crews don't get enough 
exercise being cooped up for months even years at a time... so they get to run 
around the ship.
Another reason, and perhaps more practical, is that the transporter requires 
energy. I would imagine that a sight to sight transport would take more 
energie that a normal transport from the transporter room. Why, I am not 
sure... it just sounds good.

RE: Number of items

It's a rough one, but my guess is that the writers' constanly screw up on 
this! 

See, a normal matter-to-matter transporter can beam an object ANYWHERE it 
wants, even into solid matter...

So I don't believe that the original transporter in a ship-to-ship transfer 
has to do anything at all...

Because if a transporter can beam into any space, can't it RECOVER from that 
space as well?

Why above Earth would the first unit even have to function?  Couldn't the 
second unit just lock onto the object and transport it?

But, then again, there are supposed to be some kind of security devices on 
Starships that prevent unauthorized beaming...maybe by sheer stupidity they 
can't be overridden...

the camera angles were real different. There weren't as many "head on" shots.. 
there were a lot of side shots and "over the shoulder" shots. Data's voice 
sounded different. Listen to it when he, Picard, and Riker were gathered 
around the computer. He sounds like he's spitting out his words. There was a 
lot more "mugging" by the cast (Riker does it all the time so he's not a good 
example. But Stewart himself is. WORF: "Sir." PICARD: (Soapy pancake smile) 
"Perhaps not". 
    I like Stewart's directing better. The camera doesn't bounce around as 
much and the angles are interesting. They don't work all the time, but they're interesting.

discovers their 'nursery' where the 'baby Borgs' are first connected into the

Whether they actually have sex or not is another matter entirely. They
probably use in vitro fertilization and have machine "wombs" (can't imagine a

    Just got back from seeing the entire Star Trek cast at the Shrine 
Auditorium in LA.  Star Trek VI is finishing principal photography and should 
be released in December 91.  Trek VI, The Undiscovered Country looks VERY 
good.  Christopher Plummer does indeed play a Klingon.  Sulu is the Captain of 
the U.S.S. Excelsior, with Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whittney) as one of his 
crew.  There should be some footage on Arsenio Hall in August according to 
BIll Shatner and Ralph Winter.  Director Nick Meyer appeared in a short video 
for the celebration on location at the set for Trek VI.  There were shots of 
LOTS of klingons, as well as Dr. McCoy being tossed into a snow bank and Sulu 
beaming down with two of his crew, all brandishing phasers.  NO plot details 
were revealed.

    Shatner and Kelley each gave their account of a matter the disappearing 
english muffins on the set of Trek VI.  I'll post each person's account soon.  
Nichelle sang a song she wrote for Gene (three times!! Aaargh!)  Walter 
complained of being mistaken for Tattoo on Fantasy Island.  Jimmy rambled 
about a seroius problem with his vocal cords (cancer?), but never told us the 
diagnosis.  He had called Ralph Winter in December to ask if he could record 
his lines, afraid that he would no longer have the ability to speak by the 
time the movie began shooting.  George talked about Seatrek and the French 
people who tried to imitate his laugh (Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah...).  Nimoy talked about 
the development of Spock and his love for the character.  Majel opened the 
show with a retrospective of Star Trek.  Ralph Winter spoke of Trek VI and 
showed a trailer for the theaters (Awesome!! - but no scenes or plot details).
Gene Roddenbery showed up last in his wheelchair with his son, G.R. Junior, 
and recieved a letter from George Lucas (delivered by Darth Vader) as well as 
a collosal telegram from the fans thanking him for Star Trek. Grace Lee 
Whittney was also there to talk about being back with Trek.  This will be the 
last Old Trek, but no one is betting money on that.   -- Steve Manitsas

Deforrest Kelley:

    Christopher Plummer was eating these English muffins that smelled 
wonderful, so I asked him where he got them.  He showed me the bag on the 
table in the back.  I popped one in the toaster.  The makeup director asked to 
check my makeup, and when I went back to the table, the muffins were gone.  I 
put the last muffin left in the toaster and the same thing happened!  Then I 
looked around, cuz I KNEW shatner must be behind it.  He was sitting at the 
end of the table with his mouth full, choking with his hand at his throat 
saying "Call 9-1-1!"

William Shatner: (in the manner we know and love so well...)

    Kelley and I were doing this scene where we would crawl out of this.. 
really.. tiny.. hole, and-then-fall-in-the-snow.  It wasn't right.  The 
director said to do it again and I rolled back int he hole, and Kelley... 
stooped.. down.....    slowly... with his hand on his back.  We came out 
again, and this time, when we had to redo the scene, Kelly ROLLED into the 
hole, ... and got stuck.  As he was stuck in the hole, he told me he was 
afraid of forgeting things, he was getting old.  THEN!  -- I KNEW HIS WEAKNESS!

    Kelley walked to the food table and cut his muffin in half and put it in 
the toaster... and WATCHED it.  I grabbed the makeup man and pointed at Kelly, 
"DISTRACT HIM."  The makeup man called him over to check the make up, 
pretending something was wrong.  I ... GRABBED.. the english muffin from the 
toaster.  Kelley returned to the table and stood in front of the toaster.. 
waiting... and waiting...  and waitng...

In the TOS episode "Day of the Dove," it was stated that intraship transport
was very dangerous because the slightest error would be fatal.  Now, we can
assume perhaps that the transporter system has improved since TOS.  But even
in TNG, it is safer and more accurate to use a transporter pad whenever
possible, and reserve "direct beaming" for emergencies.

Well, the idea of a person getting stuck inside a wall or floor because of
some sort of "dematerialization" is an old one, common in a number of
science-fiction stories.  It's almost cliche.

As for the special effects involved, it was clearly a dummy.  I guess they
were trying to save a couple of bucks with the special effects.

Not to mention that I think it was unrealistic.  First, she wouldn't have
died that quickly.  Second, if she were dead or unconscious, her head

I have found is that data is really good at giving computational analysis but 
falls apart completely in human relations. This machine has been around humans 
for unpteen years, yet he cannot master simple mimiking of humans. He need not 
create programs of accurate reproduction, and finding an appropriate time to 
use them, he need only copy until the trial and error phases indicate when a 
situation merits a certain response. After all isnt that what we humans do 
anyway. We copy each other. If the response is wrong we store it away for 
futute refernce, and try it out on different situations until we find one that 
it fits well. He always seems to look and act ackward. I beleive any machine 
would have been able to formulate a good human mimiking program after rising 
through the ranks of Star Fleet. Even our own simply PCs can learn by the 
imput you give them in a simple routime of a game or such. I think for such a 
great machine, they purposely reduce his potential.

Captain Garrett was killed when the Enterprise C was in its future, the

why, watch the episode Yesterday's Enterprise).  Lt. Castillo took over for
some several hours during which he helped repair his ship, and the scout
returned to base and sent 3 battlecruisers.  I know, I watched the episode
VERY recently.

RE: RE: Replicators and Transporters

Home Chicken: I don't aree that they are unable to create people and such from 
the replicators.. I believe that they won't create humans because of ethics. 
While the computers in ST have the power to store the genetic codes this newly 
created being would have to be taught everything... 
They are able to create meats and alcohol (although it is called synthehol... 
and doesn't appear to have the alcohol content meaning it lacks the yeast used 
to give it the potency). 
However it can replicate the proteins found in meat with accuracy.. perhaps it 
can replicate anythin but not neccisarily imbue it with life...

Jeff Stevens: I compared the klingons to the russians as they currently are... 
one could compare the romulans as cold War russia... where the ferrenghi go 
I'm not quite sure.. maybe a sort of midle east nation somewhere..

As for Patrick Stewart's directing of Data's love episode: I thought it was 
quite good. All'n'all... The part about him erasing her program was kind of 
sad but wrong.. if data desires nothing more than to be human he must've 
realized in his studies that love is one of the most important human emotions 
and as such would desire nothing more than to keep that program and in fact 
study more and more texts in hopes of one day really desinging a program that 
mighty fully deal with the concept..

RE: No, you're right, we don't,,,

For all of you to know, FASA is not a reliable source on the Star Trek Saga!  
FASA is a Role Playing Game company.  I have proof that they stretch the 
limits of the Enterprise.  They change everything and anything.  It maybe 
based on Star Trek, but it isn't the rea thing and you shouldn't rely on it 
for information.  Second, Star Trek novels can't be a source either.  Tehy are 
written by writers, but the writers of Star Trek are not consulted.  The fact 
it, you can write a Star Trek novel too.  The writers do sometimes change 
things around.  The novels are only BASED on Star Trek, they are not approved 
by Paramount of Gene Roddenberry!

No, Yar didn't exist once the Enterprise-C went back, they had just the 125 
officers they (124 since Garret died) normally had, but since Tasha didn't go

wouldn't transport inside the ship be authorized in case of extreme emergency? 
 Remember the TNG episode where Worf's mate was attacked in her cabin -- he 
found her still alive and called for help -- which arrived about 3 minutes

anything (just punch the right buttons on the computer and all's well).

Commander Riker enjoyed (for the first few moments, anyway) Future Imperfect. 
This might be one good way of representing him in another episode. BTW-just 
what is Counselor Troi's offical rank? She is seated at the bridge, and 
according to Star Fleet regulations no one under the rank of Ensign may sit 
there, yet she wears no formal uniform.

To reply to an earlier message, the Vulcans show very little emotion towards 
one another, yet the one thing that they do show  emotion at is the 
'Pan-Thur'. I believe I spelled that right. The Pan-Thur is where two Vulcans 
get 'in heat', and for one brief moment, express feelings through a mind-link, 
sharing the other's thooughts and movements.

One other problem that may occur with just constantly beaming folks from spot 
A to the bridge (or wherever) instead of the transporter room, is... what 
about the number of people already present at that place.  Wouldn't it be sad 
if, just as Picard was beaming straight to the bridge, riker stepped right 
into that same spot?  Ooops.  I think they prefer specific tranporter areas 
and (on many planets) landing areas.  Far fewer passerbyers getting screwed up 
in things...

don't even need ONE transporter!  Didn't you see the episode where Data went 
to visit Dr. Soom (however you spell it)  The transporters can perform 
site-to-site transporting so that you don't even need one.  Same for last

        Kirk had been victimized by amnesia after touching some alien device on

TO: Jeff Stevens #34 @6460

    According to the now infamous tech manual (the writer's one, heaven and
Roddenberry forbid I should quote the Franz Joseph one), the following chart
holds for the Enterprise:

Ship Number                  Commander           Class
NCC-1701                     J.T.Kirk            Constitution
NCC-1701 (refit)             J.T.Kirk            Constitution
NCC-1701A                    J.T.Kirk            Constitution
NCC-1701B                    ???                 Excelsior
NCC-1701C                    Rachel Garrett      Ambassador
NCC-1701D                    Jean-Luc Somebody   Galaxy

Another interesting note or two:  NCC-1701-D was launched in 2363, the first
year of ST*TNG was 2364.  Also, ship classes are named according to the name
of the first ship of that class that is launched.  Therefore there should be a
USS Galaxy somewhere around, and maybe there is still a USS Ambassador.
    Also, of course J.T.Kirk was not the only commander of some of those
ships.

    I noticed "In Theory" was written by Joe Menosky (sp?) and Ron D. Moore. 
These two are the executive story editors.  Someone said they were wondering
what the writers planned.  I think you can take this episode as a good example
of how they view Data, since the authors are rather high up the chain of
command.

RE: A few reasons why Star Trek should/could never be
TO: The Neon Samurai #278 @5415

    You bring up some interesting points in your comments on why Star Trek
could never be.  You are also interposing your opinions and working with
incomplete information.
    As to the transporter:  Who says it cannot handle that amount of energy? 
Why should it not be able to?  And for static, a subspace pathway called an
Annular Confinement Beam is opened to be used by the transporter.  The energy
is sent directly through the ACB.
    As to color and fashion:  Fashions change.  I just read an article last
week about polyester returning due to a change in chemistry and fashion.  The
colors are your own taste.  Fashions and tastes change and oscilitate.  Your
tastes are no reason to condemn something else.
    As to the warp speed, you have omitted the "pseudo-science" of subspace
and warp fields.  When we talked about Wesley's bubble, someone pointed out
how many of the theories put forth by minds such as Stephen Hawking come close
to some theories mentioned or touched upon in the episode "Remember Me."
    I don't mind a two way discussion, but you have facts for only one side. 
Get all the facts, then you'll be ready to discuss everything.  You do like to
know all the facts before you make up your mind, don't you?  I mean you have
no objection to learning both sides of the issue, right?

From:^Iconian Gateway [404-426-1941]

I read Vendetta recently, and I have one major objection.  According to the
book, the Federation is already dead.  It just hasn't stopped moving yet.

Look, the Preservers were the most powerful, technologically advanced
civilization ever known to exist.  They lost to the Borg because they
disliked war.  However, when they finally put their hearts into it, they
managed to create an ultimate weapon.  It took a grand total of 5 Borg cubes
to destroy it, and only 3 really were important to the actual destruction.

I think that David has misplaced the strength of the Borg.  In his book, they
are just plain powerful.  It's like going up against an irresistable force. 
However, in the series (true canon, here), they are nasty principally because
you have to invent a new weapons system each time you attack them, because
they'll adapt instantly.  THAT'S their true strength, that and the fact that
they're so big that a single blast from just about any weapon wouldn't hurt
them enough to put them out of commission before it became useless.  And they
repair fast.  Naturally, a fleet of Starships armed with regulation strength
phasers and such wouldn't even harm it.

According to the book, of the 3 ways to defeat the Borg reliably, only one
would wo k. rThe 3 ways are a) create a weapon that simply cannot be stopped,
by the laws of physics (whatever they are in Star Trek), b) Create a nasty
weapon and a jammer too, so they never find out what hit them to adapt to it,
and c) become a Borg, or the equivalent, and adapt as fast as they do.

According to Vendetta, only type A attacks would work, they'd be too powerful
to be hurt by type B and C attacks.

Just talking,
Caesar

I thought you would like to hear a few "facts" from much less than two hundred 
years ago..... to sort of go along with the impossible ones ST predicts for two
hundred years in the future. Please keep in mind that these "facts" were 
"unbreakable laws" supported by the science of the time.


1. The human body will not survive at speeds greater that 25 miles a hour.

2. Man will never fly.

3. The moon is not reachable.

4. No machine is capable of playing Chess.

5. It's impossible to break the sound barrier.

"As you approch light speed, the mass of the ship expands", so says Albert.... 
Maybe thats the key to FTL travel. To travel 10 light years, you accelerate 
your ship until the ship size grows to 100 light years, then slow it back down 
again.... but first select a different center of mass! The ship will colapse 
around the new center, leaving you at your destination!

              Okay, here goes my xplination. Probably not right, but what the 
heck. Okay, even at warp 9 the Enterprise is not moving at light speed. The 
ship travelling behind it at warp 8 isn't either. Light moves in all  
directions, so, the light to see the rear ship Would be travelling at "light" 
speed, so in an iundetermined amount (i'm not too surw how fast any "warp" 
factor is) of time ( relatively fast I assume) the light from the rear ship 
would over take the Enterprise, thereby registering on their monitors.
               I 've always wondered why the Enterprise can't move faster than 
the speed of light. If, as the thoery goes, mass inctrease as the energy of an 
object increases, and vice versa, wouldn't that be assuming that no other 
outside force is affecting the speed. If the Enterprise kicks it's engines up 
and hits the speed of light, then why could they not do it (kick up the 
engines) when they are at the speed of light. Then moving faster, having both 
the needed energy, and mass, to go past it. Also if aomething ever got to the 
speed of light (real life now not ST) then droped off a piece of itself, 
wouldn't the energy at that point be greater that the mass, thereby speed ing 
up until the weight and mass were again even? Hmmm...
                Any way, hope that answers your question.

    Like a bad check, I've just bounced back.  I had a comment on this post,
but I thought I'd mention a few things from the tech manual about transporters
while I'm at it.

1) If you convert a person to energy, you have a heck of a lot of energy that
has to be handled carefully.
2) It takes a lot of energy to run the t-porter.
3) Casual t-porting (I'm tired of typing) from one deck to another would waste
mucho energy.  That's one reason it's not used.  It's also overkill.  Kind of
like driving to your next door neighbors (unless he's 25 miles away).
4) Site-to-site transporting does require a transporter, but that doesn't mean
the user has to ever actually be in the chamber.
5) Site-to-site is only used in emergency.  Why?  The outrageous amount of
energy involved.  More than normal transporting.
6) If an enemy ship has its shields up, there is no way you can transport a
photon torpedo aboard (or anything else, for that matter).
7) T-porting a photon torpedo would be dangerous anyway, since they contain
anti-matter.  Everything has to work just right or ka-boom.
8) The shuttle had an emergency transporter.  Data pointed that out.  They had
to use it because the Borg had modified their shield.  Apparently all these
little expeditions to the cubeship were getting annoying.

Warp:  I'm not sure but warp drive is, like subspace, not of this universe.  
I'm not certain if it's a universe where the speed of light is extremely fast,

into warp, there is no image of it simply because it's not there.  So you 
would not be able to se the image after a few days because no light from this

warp universe, the speed of light must be very fast (not the second choise) 
because, as someone else mentioned, a ship traveling through warp can see

Transporters:  At first I though it was tradition.  You know when the first

tradition stayed.  However, I don't think so (maybe to some extent but not 
completely).  The act of converting matter to energy is (relatively) easy.  We 
can do it ourselves, and should be to ST standards by the end of nest century 
(assuming all goes well).  However, converting energy to matter will take us 
another century.  It is a (relatively) simple mechanical problem.  But, to 
shoot the energy several kilometers away and Then convert it, well that seems 
impossible.  After all, you now don't have a mechanism to do it.  Instead you 
have to use some sort of beam, either in our universe, or in subspace, that 
converts matter (or energy) into the opposite when it comes in contact.  Sort 
of like the beam in Macroscope.  So the energy is

RE: FASA

Admiral:

You made one slightly confusing statement back there, in claiming that "the
novels are only BASED on the series, they are not approved by Paramount or Gene
Roddenberry."

That's accurate for purposes of determining what *information* is "canonical"
to the ST film and TV series -- the merits of which policy can and have been
debated until we're all in the hospital with sore typing fingers.

HOWEVER, it is emphatically not true that Paramount doesn't approve the novels
generally.  Reading novel proposals and MSS delivered from Pocket is apparently
one of Richard Arnold's jobs, and there are others with influence on this
process.  (Peter David tells the story that he won Paramount "approval" for
Q-IN-LAW, the novel in which Q must cope with Lwaxana Troi, by managing to get
a manuscript of same into the hands of Majel Barrett, whereupon Barrett
apparently *leaned* on the licensing folks....)

I agree 100% about the splitting of Kirk and Spock. The first time I saw TNG, 
all I could think about was how they had split Spock's role and abilities into 
two different characters, although for some reason, I never clicked on that 
Kirk was totally split. Riker seems to fill the 'macho' role that Kirk 
played(bedding just about every woman who comes aboard) and I suppose Picard 
fills the good leader part of Kirk. Just as I've been thinking, TNG needs 
twice as many characters(and 3 times as much money) to do what TOS did. Sounds 
like we have a little error here. Just like I always say:TOS is BETTER!

Just FYI, Kirk's father was also on board the starship with April. He 
functioned as the security officer and perhaps as something else. There was an 
espionage investigation during the course of the story and he headed that up. 
He played the role of advisor and actor(one who does actions) of April. His 
name was George Samuel Kirk Sr. According to the novel, he never told his sons 
about it and it was kept under the highest security ad STC because when the 
Enterprise confronted the Romulans, according to the Enterprise's memory banks 
no human and romulan had ever met face to face, which was what happened in the 
novel.

Although some of the characteristics are similar and I DO belive that Spock 
was split into Data and Troi, it is intended to be an opposite battle. Spock 
fights to repress his emotions, while data strives to gain his. However, same 
old conflict, I think its just a gimmick for more story lines....

I meant ^^^^^^Worf. Anyway, that is a good point. I originally reiterated that 
I thought Spock was split into Data and Troi. The point about him also being 
split into Worf-the resident alien,  is a very valid one. Half of spocks's 
purpose originally on TOS was just to be very alien yet accepted and 
aprreciated. Looks like TNG was able to wring even more characters and story 
lines out of good ol Spock. And seeing as they split Kirk into Picard and 
Riker, seems to me that TNG is getting a bargain out of TOS. What a crock..., 
tell me why TNG needs five times as many characters... because each individual 
character is about as deep as a wading pool! This seems to be a 
plot-stimulating move and coming from "The Great Bird of the Galaxy" I find it 
pretty disappointing. I think the only I appeal I see(which is very little) 
for TNG is the overworked but good FX and its subliminal resemblance to the 
original.

P.S. How 'bout this split:McCoy's emotional understanding into people like 
Crusher, Yar, and even Riker picked up a bit of McCoy's pricelss rhetoric and sarcasm.

    If you check out an earlier issue of the Star Trek comic book, the 
Enterprise transported some Klingon photon torpedoes from coming at them to a 
spot right behind the Klingon ship.  Furthermore, they kept their inertia and 
hit it dead on.  Lots of readers complained, but the editor told them that 
Paramount (and Gene Roddenberry's staff) approved.  Of course, he admitted it 
wasn't a very safe or easy thing to do and would only be resorted to in 
emergencies.

Didn't Albert Einstein say you can't break the speed of light?  Many people 
said that about the speed of sound before it was broken.  We did it!  Some day 
we'll break the speed of light as well.  Now that does not mean Einstein was 
an "IDIOT"!  He was quite brilliant.  But I do believe there are is no such 
word as "IMPOSSIBLE".  The first time something is done no one before that 
knew how to do it.  We will break the speed of light some day.  Then what will 
they say is the ultimate speed?  Maybe it's thought.  Have you ever day 
dreamed about something and almost thought you were there when in reality you 
weren't.  Now harness that speed and you can go anywhere in the universe in a 
matter of a second or two.  Maybe that's the ultimate speed!  Maybe even that 
can br broken!   Again I say, then what will the say the ultimate speed is?

The 'void' as you call it passed through the deck where she was walking, and 
then left... as she was falling the deck 'phased back into reality' (for lack 
of a better phrase)  I personally thought there should be at least a little 
blood to show the bodily separation...  as it looked in the show all of the 
trauma was immediatly cauterized stopping the flow of blood....

Perhaps as the camera panned down on her, have her head drop forward and 
perhaps have her hand go limp as a pool of blood spreads out upon the

 1) You're all basing this on 20th century technology.  part two of this is
that who knows what techonolgy we will have next year or in five years or in
100 or 500 years.  Maybe the fuel of tommorrow maybe a refined jello!  Imagine
that we can run machinery on Bill Cosby's jello!  This is just an off the wall
comparision to that we just don't know what lays a head in techonolgy so yes
it can be possible to do anything in the trek world of Gene Rodenberry because
he's based it on us and taken it to where HE thinks it will go.  After all if
you were to tell an 11th century person that people will be cured by moldy

No, you wouldn't.  The starship would be traveling too fast to be perceptual

traveling in a subspace warp bubble which can only be seen with special

But the way I remember it...As an object aproaches the speed of light the mass 
increases, but the length, in
the direction of travel, decreases.  Slso, in our universe you cannot reach 
light speed, not that you can't go light speed (photons go that fast) but you 
cannot reach it.  Close, but not quite.  In fact, electro-magnetic radiation 
is created already going the speed of light (so it dowsn't break this theory).

Actually, you CAN beam through shields.  It is just very, very, very,

    Going from transporter to transporter would seem logical for 3 reasons:

1.  Added precaution for the individual being teleported
2.  Added precaution for security of the RECEIVING ship
3.  Almost "curtosy" to the receiving ship

    If you were captain of a ship, you wouldn't want people just rudely
appearing at random in your ship (possibly on top of someone else).  It
would also be very unorganized and unlike the federation.  It also possibly
allows a small hole in the force shields for receiving at specified times.
Of course, the any added precaution to keep someones matter from splattering
in outer space would also be suggested.

It is the difference between knowledge and experience.


He has to continue to evolve, because although he can, with the help of the

a lack of experience in interpersonal relationships.  That's something Spock
didn't have a problem with....But with Data, it was a complete tabula rasa.

According to him, the Enterprise accellerates up TO c and beyond in less than

    Warp-capable starships DO move faster than light.  Or -- faster than light 
HERE.
    What the warp drive does, as I understand it, is generate an envelope of 
OTHERSPACE around the starship.  There, the speed of light is higher -- MUCH 
higher -- than it is in normal space.  The starship can move REAL fast, 
without conflicting with e=mc^2...
    the Impulse drive, on the other hand, should really be called the warp 
drive because what it does is warp normal space, generating "waves" in the 
continuum.  The starship moves on the waves... sort of like surfing...

The ships in Star Trek dont have to be well rounded, etc. because there is not

Aliens, 2001/10, and heck even Battlestar Galactica are realistic.  Especially 
since the ship in 2001 (I'm racking my brains out for the name of it) didnt 
make any SOUND in space, another reason why the ships in ST are a little out

RE: Spock-Data/Troi/Work
TO: Screaming Eagle #70 @5650

    Most of this is in reply to Screaming Eagle.  Before I talk about the ST
stuff (either TOS or TNG), I want to say to you, Screaming Eagle, that I'm
glad to see you on this sub.  You articulate your points well and you back
them up.  You don't try to give people a quick opinion and insult them by
refusing to back it up with only insinuation or insults.  I'm always glad to
see posts by anyone who can state a point of view and support it.

    Now, on the ST part.  I disagree.  I've said before that I like TNG better
than TOS.  When I started watching, it seemed to me that TNG had several
"splits", most notably Kirk=Riker/Picard and Spock=Troi/Data.  I don't think
so now.  I also made lists of the casts.  I have to admit I left Tasha off the
TNG list (so if anybody wants to add 1 to the TNG talley, do so).  I am not
making a comparison, but by listing characters I get:

TOS
Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scottie, Sulu, Chekov, Uhura

TNG
Picard, Riker, Beverly, Geordi, Data, Worf, Troi

I counted seven each.  I did not count Guinan, Barclay, Janice Rand, Lt. Kyle,
O'Brian or others.  I also have to admit I left Wesley off the list (maybe
because he's not on the current TNG cast list).  I get 7 characters versus 7
characters.  I don't think the splitting was done to "create more characters"
or to get more plotlines.  I wonder, though, if the original thinking was what
abilities and traits were needed.

I have to agree, though, that both Worf and Spock were the resident aliens.  I
prefer to use the word token.  To be honest, I think there is a certain amount
of tokenism.  In TOS, there was a token woman, black, Russian, oriental, and
alien.  Now we have a token alien (although Troi is 1/2 alien--the token
half-breed, like Spock), handicapped person (excuse me, differently abled for
the PC people), token women, and token black.  In some cases the roles are
combined.  Notice that the stories still tend to center on WASPs (White
Anglo-Saxon Protestant), or on Worf.

Something else to consider:  We saw how the cast list changed from "The Cage"
to "Where No Man Has Gone Before" to "The Mantrap" (first aired TOS). 
Creating a cast and a series is dynamic.  Changes are constantly being made. 
I seriously doubt the initial goals were that close to the end results. 
Characteristics and traits were needed, and they were probably adjusted until
a tight ensemble was worked out.

I have to admit, I am glad to see the de-emphasis on science from the crew
point of view.  I thought Spock's role as science officer was over-emphasized
to the point where it was sometimes hard to remember he was also the first
officer.  BAsically, there was no executive officer.  Science and the science
officer always provided the answer.  I'm not speaking against science, since I
love it and SF a lot, but it seemed unrealistic for a military captain to
always look to the role of science officer for help.  True, Spock was
technically the executive officer, but that never seemed to come out.

    In response to the post about the Enterprises's interior being too perfect
etc.  I would have to agree that Enterprise is a very comfortable ship.  The
computers are ... user friendly and most of the time everything to do with the
Enterprises systems runs smoothly.  

    The interior of Enterprise was not always so comfortable.  Look at the
older Enterprise ncc17101.  You can tell immediately that it wasn't a luxury
liner.  The new Enterprise ncc1701d houses the crew's family.  They - well make
it comfortable for the crew and family.  The new Enterprise is realistic I
think because when we eventually travel through the galaxy, we will want to
make space travel as comfortable and convenient as possible.

RE: More thoughts on Albert....

Quoting Captain Quirk...
"As you approch light speed, the mass of the ship expands", so says Albert....
Maybe thats the key to FTL travel. To travel 10 light years, you accelerate
your ship until the ship size grows to 100 light years, then slow it back down
again.... but first select a different center of mass! The ship will colapse
around the new center, leaving you at your destination!
... End of quote

That would work, save for the problem that *all* lengths along the velocity
vector of the ship appear to be dilated, so that the mass of the ship becomes
concentrated spatially as reckoned by a "stationary" observer of the ship. 
There really aren't any
tricks anyone can pull to get around the physical laws, as we know them to be.

Well, I see the point the fellow was making. Often they are bent on doing
damamge to something (like the Borg ship in BoBW) and they can transport over
and do damage, but they can't beam a bomb over with them (or without them)
and blow the ship into subatomic particles. No excuse possible except 'Well,
I didn't think of that'. The excuse about antimatter being dangerous to
transport is ludicrous. They've done it several times; the last time was
Wesley's science experiment he beamed to the USS Hathaway; and very casually,
I might add.

Transporter bombs would do one thing, though: They would insure that shields
would be up at most any encounter.

RE: The only real problem there is

as you approach the speed of light..likewise (per the LORENTZ-FITZGERALD
CONTRACTION..look it up in any college physics book) ..when a body moves
through space its dimension parallel to the line of mass should become less by
an amount DEPENDENT UPON ITS SPEED.  if the speed of the body is v, and that
of light is c, then the contraction is in the ratio of:

                                     ----------
                                    /    (v*v)   .

                                 \/      (c*c)  
  so, at the speed of light, v=c you get a ratio of the objects length of 0:1,
or a length of 0!  so the mass of an object has increased infinitely, and its
length is zero at the speed of light.

After reading some of these messages, there seems to be numerous criticisms 
dealing with the realism of Star Trek (specifically the Next Generation) sucha 
as the føÄAµýemale crewman who got "stuck" between decks.  Such scenes may 
appear to be unrealistic and the makers of the show are probably aware to such 
nuances.  BUT, they make it that way as to produce a dramatic effect.  I wish 
I could think of better examples of this, but I think you can still get the 
point.

Another thing about realism.  There is one aspect of the Next Generation that 
tries to keep its realism.  That is the computer graphic displays.  Whenever 
you see a close-up of a computer readout, what you see is completely relevant 
to what is being talked about.  I ïkþòô¨¶¥úÊfÿÿË]‹÷ ÿrecord every new episode 
and have carefully examined such scenes.  It's pretty neat to see that they 
don't overlook such items and that adds to the realism a bunch!

you needed to watch the show a little closer.  Yes, O'brien was able to beam
into the Phoenix, because he KNEW the energy cycling pattern repeated itself
every 5 minutes, or so....it was THAT knowledge that allowed him to be able
to time his transport over to the Phoenix....but to do that with a Klingon
ship, or a Romulan ship would be darned near impossible, without knowing the

I agreee, they screwed up the borg in the book. They were not quite "right".
I don't really know any other way to put it. The fact that instantly, there
was a way to defend against a bean on anti-matter from an apparently ordinary
Borg ship seemed a bit TOO far gone to viewed as realistic as far as the
storyline went. I'm sorry, but the magnitudes of power being thrown out there
were just to much to be simply "defelected". They brought the borg down to a
fightable level with near Star Fleet technology. That's a NONO in my book.
Gee.. a race whose biggest strength is the ability to adapt to its environs..
kinda like the human race?

Actually, the writers keep showing the replicators reproducing VERY complex 
molecular combinations: FOOD. The limitations that they tend to keep to are 
two: You can have a complex structure made up of a simple material, thus 
producing a wine glass, or you can have a complex molecular component in a 
simple form, thus producing the liquid wine (with synthahol, of course). I 
think these two limiting descriptions would cover what we've actually seen 
produced, and still keep the bloody thing from replicating phasers, or intact 
Borgs, or things like that.

Personally, i liked that touch as it reminded me of "The Philadelphia 
Experiment"

as to why she didn't fall into the void, from what I understood, there wree 
bubbles of subspace inbstability (ie holes in the fabric of space/time)  if 
the instability phased out the floor just as she stepped on it, she would have 
dropped down and when the deck phased back in, ouch.

Hopefully, in a future episode they'll devote some time to the replacement of 
that deck section (eiither rthat or put up with the crew passing around 
stories about the haunted corridor since part of that woman's body would' 
still be in the floor.

What gets me though, is that she looked like she was only into the deck up to 
her hips, I can't image why she didn't survive a little longer, at least long 
enough for a dramatic 
"O`brein, medical emergency, beam two to sickbay" and having a chunk of the 
deck on the examining table.

Spot, Spock, or whatever the hell Data called it (sounded like "Spot" to me)

    While objects in space may appear to be "jammed up" specks of dust, the 
vastness of space between them is unbelievable. Two entire galaxies can collide
and pass through each other without a single star colliding with another. The 
probability of a spaceship travelling at incredible speeds through a galaxy 
colliding with another object is a reality, but of such incredible odds that a

140/150: Transporters

That theory about transporting a photon torpedo onto an enemy ship could not 
work because, when a ship's shields are up(almost always during battle), 
transport between the ships is impossible(I won't even BEGIN to cite example 
of this happening in ST). However, if you read the novels, in the TOS Novel 
"The Kobayashi Maru", Scotty tells about his Kobayashi Maru test where, when 
all of his weapons were destroyed he transported photon torpedos and 
antimatter bottles right next to the enemy ships and caused an explosion. In 
case you really wanna know...It was later stated that that strategy wouldn't 
work in real life. It was theoretically correct and that's why the Simulator 
Computers accepted it, however, when Scotty was debriefed afterwards, the 
reviewing admiral opens an encyclopedia(paper encyclopedia in ST times?) and 
points out "The Aberdeen Incident
" in which Montogomery Scott, an Aberden youth tried an experiment of placing 
photon torpedoes in proximity of homemade shields, similar to Klingon ones, 
and an explosion DID NOT ENSUE. The scientists were never sure why(according 
to the novel) but it just didn't work... Hope I answered your question...

   How long can the shields remain up without draining them or the power 
source out?  Could the Enterprise have put the shields up to prevent "the 
devil" from transporting aboard the ship?  Could Q get on the ship even if 
shields were up?  Maybe another entity?  As I said in the last post.. "You 
can't actually get through the shields" but maybe you can... if you have 
massive ammounts of power.

  I like what they did between movies...release a kit for Trek II, III, and 
IV.  The only difference in models was: One was the original refit NCC-1701.  
The next was NCC-1701-A(The only thing they changed was the DECAL!!!  No 
wonder sales were so dismal!!!  All you'd need to do is call up Ertl(they give 
a toll free number) and request the decal sheet with the 'A' on it...and you 
have a new model.
  I think they also released a kit of the NCC-1701-A with the Galileo 
shuttlecraft(from Trek V)...

  The closest analogy that I have seen so far was when Dr. Pulaski replaced 
Dr. Crusher as Chief Surgeon.  She was similar to McCoy in that she was strong 
willed.  She even had an extreme dislike of the transporter similar to Doctor 
McCoy.  The thing I liked about her was that she did not get along with Data.  
She was constantly challenging Data's assertation that he was "alive".  This  
was similar to the Spock/McCoy arguments, but not a carbon-copy of their 
arguments.  This added some spice to the show, and I was sorry when whiney 
(oh, save my son, Jean-Luc) Dr. Crusher returned...

RE: Get a life.....

I have been waiting for someone to take this stand.  Look into the Science 
Fiction writing of the 30's.  To think they actually envisioned lap top 
computers in every home, wall sized television, test tube babies.  The people 
of their time emphatically denied the ability to actually have these visions 
realized.

Just because we do not know how to create these "Star Trek" visions now, does 
not outlaw their future creation any more than the Science Fiction of past 
years.  

As the theory was put forward in past times that Man is a product of evolution 
from lesser creatures, only "Arrogant Man" assumes that our present stage of 
evolution is the ultimate.  It is more appropriate to say that Man is 
continuing to evolve and the future holds limitless accomplishments.

Have some faith people, believe in the future of Man.

RE: Question:

There were 79 aired episodes of the original Star Trek Series.  They are 
available on cassette tape from CBS home video.  I have a set.  If you would 
like to information about their purchase (The collector's edition) please 
E-Mail me an address and I will send the brochures to you.

There is also the release of the original pilot (the one turned down by the 
networks) called "The Cage".  Parts of this original were used in the episode 
of "The Menangerie" (two parter).

It is interesting, if you get a copy of "The Cage" it contains the parts used 
in "The Menagerie" in color (the original pilot was in black and white).  It 
is an interesting comparisson to see the original change from black to white 
as the original pilot was cut and these parts computer colored for the use in 
the series.  The effect of added color is truly amazing.

Hope this was of some help.  If you were a local to Lake County you could come 
into the bar I own and view them.  I run them constantly in my bar.  They have 
quite a following there.

RE: Visit to a Wierd Planet

This is one of my favorite books.  It has a wonderful story in it that always 
thought would make a great ST film.  It is about Kirk being "mind ripped" by 
the Klingons and transported back in time to present day, where he has become 
an inmate of an insane asylum and Spock's undying efforts to find him while 
all others lose hope.

Anyone read that one?

RE: Well,

One reason I've heard for sometimes using two transporters is that the energy 
usage is less if they share the load than if one is doing all the work. I 
think the book "Memory Prime" is where I heard this.

One theory I have is that the receiving transporter provides a constant 
reference to transport to, whereas using a single transporter requires it to 
search for a suitable place to lock on to.  "The Menagerie" and "Star Trek II: 
The Wrath of Khan" both expressed concerns about reappearing inside rock.

The "Enterprise" has always been the jewel of Starfleet, and the best captains 
have been assigned to it.  But, if the captain assigned to NCC-1701-B was not 
of the same calibre we've seen (it would have to be "no where close"), 
Starfleet might want to put that behind them.

On the other hand, "Star Trek VI" is supposed to be the final movie, so we 
might see the baton passed from Captain Kirk of 1701-A to a new captain of 
1701-B.  (Anyone heard a rumor as to what happened to 1701-A after it was 
discovered to be such a dog?)

RE: was that canon??

Bought that a while back.  In it are several memos, amongst them the names of 
the people who have captained the Enterprise.  Also in it are the accepted 
starship names, as well as a series of memos about Vulcan names (lists of 
five-letter combinations that begin with S and end in K, I think) and how to 
pronounce them.  (Glad that G.R. decided on a little variety for Vulcan names, 
in keeping with I.D.I.C.)

The book has been re-printed, perhaps with new information.  I consider it 
canon because it is a documentary-type book about how "Star Trek" was created.
