Just a thought, but when Rand finally does go to Tar Valon, 
and looks upon Dragonmount, will he see himself (Lews       
Therin) dying thousands of years in the past?Could this be  
another Lews "trying to take over point" in the story?

 Who knows? ( besides Robert Jordan )  Maybe the stronger   
the flashback, the stronger the hold Lews Therin Telamon has
over Rands personality.  And seeing his own death would     
certainly be very strong.

I've also noticed that the more Rand channels, the more     
Lews tries to take over.  If there is a Power war near Tar  
Valon, couldn't this place, above all else (except Shayol   
Ghul) be the place for Lews to finally take over?  I think  
so.

 It's possible. I think it would also depend on what he     
tries to channel, such as how much he tries to channel.  But
I'm not quite sure Lews is totally going to take over. Not  
because of anything in the story, I just don't think Rand   
al'Thor will disappear from the scene. I just can't wait to 
find out how R. Jordan will right it.

I don't think Rand willdissappear either.  Maybe there will 
be some points where Lews is stronger, but in the end Rand  
will be the main personality.  Oh, just realized- what if,  
in the end after the DO is killed or driven off, Lews is    
still in Rand's mind?  Would he just go on living, having a 
second person inside him?

   I just thought - wouldn't Dragonmount be a good place for
Rand to get Lews out of his mind?  It could be that Lews'   
memories get stronger and stronger, and then finally, right 
before he takes over Rand, the memory of his death comes and
banishes those Lews memories for good.

 Here is an idea. Lews will remain with Rand long enough to 
fight the Dark One. Then if Rand/Lews is still alive Rand   
al'Thor will be the dominant personality.

Either he'll (Lews) will somehow die out by seeing his own  
death, or he'll go crazy by remembering what he did even    
more.  For that, I guess we will hear a lot of "Ilyena,     
forgive me!!"

You're all wrong, there's no other personality trying to    
take over Rand. Ya, ya. right. Bar tender, one more round!  
I can quite, anytime. Denial, that's the way to go.         
Actually, it SAYS in several spots:                         
 "let the Promised One be born of the mountain, according   
to the prophecies as he was in ages past and will be in     
ages to come..."                                            
 "yet one shall be born to face the Shadow born once more   
as he was born before and shall be born gain, time without  
end."                                                       
 "And his paths shall be many, and who shall know his       
name, for he shall be born among us many times, inmany      
guises, as he has been and ever will be, time without end." 
Note the HE not THEY. If Rand was a composite entity, they  
would be a composite of different souls. Rand isn't. Rand   
is Lews. Rand is every Promised One of every Age of every   
Turning. There is one entity that is born again and again   
to fight the Dark One. As a matter of fact, in TSR, Egwene  
expresses the belief that everyone is reborn again in the   
next Age. I don't have the quote on hand, but I can post    
it if necessary.  Moiraine

Pardon me my friends but I'm going to go hang myself in my  
living room...DRAT!  Why is it that I always miss one       
thing-the most important thing, of course.  Okay, then.  If 
Rand is the "One" in all places, all time, then if he went  
to another world through a Portal Stone he would not find   
another Rand there?  I think it said something of "other    
exact dimensions" or something of the like with the >>>     
same people.  Like the old Superman vs. bad Superman duel in
an exact backward dimension.

By the way bartender, I think I'll definitely have another  
one.  Zima, no ice please.

I think like the Amber series, the Mirrors of the Wheel are 
only pale immitations of the real world. And I think Verin  
said that if the Dark One was let out in one mirror he would
be let out in all realities. We haven't discussed the       
various worlds/realities of (sarcastically) "Randland."

    I wasn't excactly aurguing this point.  In fact, you are
probably right.  I believe, however, that Rand is having a  
little trouble with his memories.  Wouldn't you be rather   
surprised if you remembered things that you believed never  
happened to you.  It doesn't really matter that it's Rand's 
memories, it only matters that Rand believes that it's      
impossible for him to remember them.  Perhaps when Rand goes
to Dragonmount he will become at peace with his memories    
after remembering his death.  Of course, he might go mad,   
like I would (G).

Yes, I agree, it's how he looks at his new memories. He     
views them as alien, thus they have been given the persona, 
Lews. Make sure to export the prophecies AND everything you 
find in "BEHOLD." You'll love it.  Moiraine

     1. Histories from the Fourth Age. I have nothing to    
add to Mr. Millard's analysis on why these must be included 
as prophetic fragments towards Rand's future. Certainly, as 
he said, it must be taken into consideration that the       
passing of time might perhaps distort the amount of         
credible information that they provide. This is actually    
covered in the series during a conversation on the          
distortion of history between Thom and Elayne (TSR, Chapter 
20, p230-231) on the Wavedancer. Additionally, the fact has 
been reinforced in each book during the beginning paragraph 
of the first chapter.

as ashes. The seas boiled, and the living envied the dead.  
All was shattered, all but memory lost, and one memory      
above all others, of him who brought the Shadow and the     
breaking of the world. And they named him Dragon."  (from   
Aleth nin Taerin alta Camora, The Breaking of the World.    
Author unknown, the Fourth Age)                             
1.02 <EOW, prologue, Dragonmount, xv>                       
"And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before   
and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land   
and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things    
failed, and hope died. And men cried out to the Creator,    
saying, O Light of the Heavens, Light of the World, let the 
Promised One be born of the mountain, according to the      
prophecies, as he was in ages past and will be in ages to   
come.  Let the Prince of the Morning sing to the land that  
green things will grow and the valleys give forth lambs.    
Let the arm of the Lord of the Dawn shelter us from the     
Dark, and the great sword of justice defend us.  Let the    
Dragon ride again on the winds of time."  (from Charal      
Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. Author        
unknown, the Fourth Age) [a portion of this ("And men cried 
out to the...the winds of time.) was also on p577, TGH,

1.03 <TDR, Chapter 56, People of the Dragon, p675>          
"And it was written that no hand but his should wield the   
Sword held in the Stone, but he did draw it out, like fire  
in his hand, and his glory did burn the world. Thus did it  
begin. Thus do we sing his Rebirth. Thus do we sing the     
beginning." (from Do'in Toldara te, Songs of the Last Age,

"And when the blood was sprinkled on ground where nothing   
could grow, the Children of the Dragon did spring up, the   
People of the Dragon, armed to dance with death. And he     
did call them forth from the wasted lands, and they did     
shake the world with battle." (from The Wheel of Time by    
Sulamein so Bhagad Chief Historian at the Court of the

     2. Prophecy. Much as Mr. Millard says, the prophecies  
of the Wheel of Time are often the most reliable and        
revealing sources of information given to us. The prophecy  
most central to the books, the Karaethon Cycle, is perhaps  
the best supplied. However, other prophecies which must     
come into consideration number, the Jendai Prophecy (The    
Sea Folk Prophecy), The Prophecy of Rhuidean (Aiel          
Prophecy), the Dark Prophecy found in Fal Dara, and the     
Cycle of the Horn. Included in this compilation is a        
passage from Vandene analyzing portions of the Karaethon    
Cycle and a passage from Verin that analyzes the Dark       
Prophecy. Both analysis provide the vital information       
needed to comprehend the complete import of the             
respective prophecies.

never fall until the People of the Dragon come to the       
Stone. Another says the Stone will never fall until the

"He has yet to break the nations, or shatter the world.     
Even scholars who have studied the Prophecies for their     
entire lives do not know how to interpret them all. What    
does it mean that he shall 'slay his people with the sword  
of peace, and destroy them with the leaf'(unfulfilled)?     
What does it mean that he 'shall bind the nine moons to     
serve him'(unfulfilled)? Yet these there are given equal    
weight with Callandor in the Cycle. There are others. What  
'wound of madness and cutting of hope'(uncertain) has he    
healed? What chains has he broken, and who put into

as he was born before and shall be born again, time         
without end. The Dragon shall be Reborn, and there shall    
he clothe the people, and he shall break the world again    
by his coming, tearing apart all ties that bind. Like the   
unfettered dawn shall he blind us, and burn us, yet shall   
the Dragon Reborn confront the Shadow at the Last battle,

"'Five ride forth, and four return. Above the watchers      
shall he proclaim himself, bannered cross the sky in        
fire...' Well, it goes on. The point is, the word ma'vron.  
I say it should be translated not simply as 'watchers,'     
which is a'vron. Ma'vron has more importance to it. I say   
it means the Watchers Over the Waves, though they call      
themselves Do Miere A'vron, of course, not Ma'vron...But I  
believe it means the Dragon Reborn will appear somewhere

"He can wield the One Power, so I have heard, and he holds  
the Sword That Cannot Be Touched. The Aiel have come over   
the Dragonwall to his call; I have seen several in the      
streets, and it is said they fill the Stone. The Stone of   
Tear has fallen, and war breaks over the nations of the

you are here in this city. That is in the Prophecy as       
well. 'The White Tower shall be broken by his name, and

translated by Verin Mathwin, Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah.)  
                                                            
  a. Verin's interpretation of the dark prophecy            
2.25 <TGH, Chapter 7, Blood Calls Blood, pp90-92>           
"'Daughter of the Night, she walks again.' That can only    
mean Lanfear is loose again. Or someone wants us to think   
she is...Other names are clear, too, Mother. Lord Luc, of   
course, was brother to Tigraine, then the Daughter-Heir of  
Andor, and he vanished in the Blight. Who Isam is, or what  
he has to do with Luc, I do not know, however...("Isam had  
been the son of Breyan, wife of Lain Mandragoran, whose     
attempt to seize the throne of Malkier for her husband had  
brought the Trolloc hordes crashing down. Breyan and her    
infant son had both vanished when the Trollocs overran      
Malkier. And Isam had been blood kin to Lan. Or is blood    
kin? I must keep this from him, until I know how he will    
react. Until we are away from the Blight. If he thought     
Isam were alive..[Moiraine's thoughts].") 'The Watcher's    
wait on Toman's Head,'...There are a few who still cling    
to the old belief that the armies Artur Hawkwing sent       
across the Aryth Ocean will return one day, though after    
all this time...The Do Miere A'vron, the Watchers Over the  
Waves, still have a...community is the best word, I         
suppose...on Toman Head, at Falme. And one of the old       
names for Artur Hawkwing was Hammer of the Light...Now,     
'the ancient tree,'...There have always been rumors-no      
more than that-that while the nation of Almoth still        
lived, they had a branch of Avendesora, perhaps even a      
living sapling. and the banner of Almoth was 'blue for the  
sky above, black for the earth below, with the spreading    
Tree of Life to join them.' Of course, Taraboners call      
themselves the Tree of Man, and claim to be descended from  
rulers and nobles in the Age of Legends. And Domani claim   
descent from those who made the Tree of Life in the Age of  
Legends. There are other possibilities, but you will note,  
Mother, that at least three center around Almoth Plain and  
Toman Head...The Time of Change, of course, refers to the   
end of an Age, and the Great Lord-" (quoted from Verin      
Mathwin, Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah)

'gainst the fall of long night,(unfulfilled)                
the mountains stand guard,                                  
and the dead shall be ward,                                 
for the grave is no bar to my call."(Thom reciting a verse  
from The Great Hunt of the Horn)                            
2.27 <EOW, Chapter 53, The Wheel Turns, p655>               
"There are Darkfriends still, as well as Halfmen and        
Trollocs, and those who come to the horn will follow        
whoever winds it." (Moiraine speaking to Lord Agelmar in    
Fal Dara)                                                   
2.28 <TGH, Chapter 5, The Shadow in Shienar, p55>           
"Agelmar was familiar with the Prophecy of the Horn; most   
who fought the Dark One were. "'Let whosoever sounds me     
think not of glory, but only of salvation.'"(Moiraine       
speaking with Suian)                                        
2.29 <TGH, Chapter 47, The Grave Is No Bar To My Call, p560>
"'The Pattern weaves itself around our necks like           
halters,' Artur Hawkwing said. 'You are here. The banner    
is here. The weave of this moment is set. We have come to   
the Horn, but we must follow the banner. And the            
Dragon.(fulfilled)'" (Artur Hawkwing speaking to Rand

     3. Foretellings. Mr. Millard did not place specific    
emphasis on the various Foretellings mentioned in the       
Wheel of Time, however they should be given equal weight    
with Dreaming, Viewings, and Prophecy as predictive of      
future events.

"...From this day Andor marches toward pain and division.   
The Shadow has yet to darken to its blackest, and I cannot  
see if the Light will come after. Where the world has wept  
one tear, it will weep thousands...Pain and division come   
to the whole world, and this man stands at the heart of     
it.(uncertain)"(Elaida's Foretelling of Rand al'Thor in     
Caemlyn)                                                    
3.02 <TSR, Seeds of Shadow, Chapter 1, p29>                 
"The very first thing Elaida had ever Foretold, while       
still an Accepted-and had known enough even then to keep    
to herself-was that the Royal line of Andor would be the    
key to defeating the Dark One in the Last                   
Battle.(uncertain)" (from Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan's,      
(then) Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah, thoughts in Tar Valon.)

3.03 <TSR, Chapter 26, The Dedicated, p300>                 
"Besides, the Da'shain yet have a part to play, if Deindre  
could only see far enough to say what.(unfulfilled)"<p300>  
"You will carry the...things...to safety, Jonai. Keep       
moving, always keep moving, until you find a place of       
safety, where no once can harm you.(fulfilled)"<p301>       
"Keep the Covenant, Jonai. If the Da'shain lose everything  
else, see they keep the Way of the Leaf. Promise me."<p301> 
"...And remember-keep moving. Keep the Aiel safe."(related  
by Solinda Sedai during the Breaking)<p301>

iii. Gitara Moroso's Foretellings.                          
3.04 <TGH, Chapter 8, The Dragon Reborn, p109>              
"He is born again! I feel him! The Dragon takes his first   
breath on the slope of Dragonmount! He is coming! He is     
coming! Light help us! Light help the World! He lies in     
the snow and cries like the thunder! He burns like the

Keeper of the Chronicles)                                   
3.05 <TSR, Chapter 34, He Who Comes With The Dawn, p392>    
"...disaster would befall her land and her people, perhaps  
the world, unless she went to dwell among the Maidens of    
the Spear, telling no one of her going. She[Tigraine] must  
become a Maiden, and she could not return to her own land   
until the Maidens had gone to Tar Valon.(fulfilled)"        
(related by Tigraine, (then) Daughter-Heir of Andor (also   
known as Shaiel) to Amys, of the Nine Valleys sept of the   
Taardad Aiel, and by Amys to Rand al'Thor)                  
                                                            
     4. Dreams. Between Egwene and Perrin's dreams, we      
discover perhaps more combined then through any other       
prophetic passeges in the entire series. In some ways they  
predict a greater scope of what is to come, but in most     
cases, the dream is fulfilled in  the book it premiere's    
in. Just for reference, the Wise Ones on dreaming; "Almost  
anyone can touch Tel'aran'rhiod, but few can truly enter    
it. Of all the Wise Ones, we four alone can dreamwalk, and  
your Tower has not produced a dreamwalker in nearly five    
hundred years. It is not a thing of the One Power, though   
Aes Sedai believe it is. I cannot channel, nor can Seana,   
yet we dreamwalk as well as Amys or Melaine. Many people    
brush the World of Dreams in their sleep. Because they      
only brush against it, they wake with aches or pains where  
they should have broken bones or mortal hurts. A            
dreamwalker enters the dream fully, therefore her injuries  
are real on waking. For one who is fully in the dream,      
dreamwalker or not, death there is death here. To enter     
the dream too completely, though, is to lose touch with     
the flesh; there is no way back, and the flesh dies. It is  
said that once there were those who could enter the dream   
in the flesh, and no longer be in this world at all. This   
was an evil thing, for they did evil; it must never be      
attempted, even if you believe it possible for you, for     
each time you will lose some  part of what makes you        
human. You must learn to enter Tel'aran'rhiod when you      
wish, to the degree you wish. You must learn to find what   
you need to find and read what you see, to enter the        
dreams of another close by in order to aid healing, to      
recognize those who are in the dream fully enough to harm   
you, to..." (<TSR, Chapter 23, Beyond the Stone, p272>)

"First there had been a man with a mask over his face, and  
fire in place of his eyes. Despite the mask, she had        
thought he was surprised to see her. His look had           
frightened her till she thought her bones would break from  
shivering, but suddenly he vanished, and she saw Rand       
sleeping on the ground, wrapped in a cloak. A woman had     
been standing over him, looking down. Her face was in       
shadow, but her eyes seemed to shine like the moon, and

his shoulder it was Thom on the litter, not his father,     
sitting cross-legged and juggling in the moonlight./'The    
Queen is wed to the land,' Thom said as brightly colored    
balls danced in a circle, 'but the Dragon...the Dragon is   
one with the land, and the land is one with the             
Dragon.'/Further back Rand saw a Fade coming,...Two         
severed heads hung at its mount's coal-black shoulder. Lan  
and Moiraine, faces distorted in grimaces of pain. The      
Fade pulled on a fistful of tethers as it rode. Each        
tether ran back to the bound wrists of one of those who     
ran behind the soundless hooves, their faces blank with     
despair. Mat and Perrin. And Egwene<442>...'You are mine,'  
the raven said, and the sharp beak stabbed into his eye.    
He screamed as it plucked his eyeball out of his            
head.<443>"(Rand's dream on Almen Bunt's wagon on the way   
to Caemlyn)

"It seemed to Rand that he was sitting at table with        
Logain and Moiraine. The Aes Sedai and the false Dragon     
sat watching him silently as if neither knew the other was  
there. Abruptly he realized the walls of the room were      
becoming indistinct, fading off into gray. A sense of       
urgency built in him. Everything was going, blurring away.  
When he looked back to the table, Moiraine and Logain had   
vanished, and Ba'alzamon sat there instead. Rand's whole    
body vibrated with urgency; it hummed inside his head,      
louder and louder. The hum became the pounding of blood in  
his ears." (when Rand fell off the Caemlyn wall)            
4.26 <EOW, Chapter 43, Decisions and Apparitions, pp549-551>
"He stood staring at the wooden door,...down into           
blackness and death."                                       
4.27 <TSR, Chapter 2, Whirlpools in the Pattern, pp53-54>   
"Through a shadowy forest Moiraine was prodding him with    
a sharp...Festering flesh almost obliterated the heron      
branded on his palm; white bone showed through red-edged    
gaps..." (Rand's dreams in Tear)                            
4.28 <TSR, Chapter 50, Traps, pp571-572>                    
"Eyes, closed, Rand stroked through the water. Nicely       
cool...The woman looked at him, still neck-deep in the      
pond; her mouth tightened with irritation, and she          
vanished."                                                  
4.29 <FOH, Chapter 4, Twilight, p95>                        
"Not protection from his own thoughts, though. Three women  
invaded them continueally. Not Isendre,...Aside from the    
nightmare, they were all pleasant dreams."

in the Waterwood back home in the Two Rivers..."(from       
Rand's thoughts in Rhuidean)

"...a confused dream of Min and Elayne helping him throw    
Aviendha, wearing nothing but that necklace over his        
shoulder, while she beat him over the head with a wreath    
of segade blossoms."(after Melaine's weading)               
4.32 <FOH, Chapter 22, Birdcalls by Night, p288>            
"This time he dreamed of Aviendha hurling fire, only she    
was not hurling it at a Draghkar, and Sammael was sitting   
by her side, laughing."(after the "Golden Bees" attack)

Egwene; he was not about to dive into that again until he   
was sure. Sure of something. Sure. If Dealings with the     
Territory of Mayene was to be believed..."(Rand's thoughts  
while dealing with the High Lords of Tear)                  
5.19 <TSR, Chapter 21, Into the Heart, p241>                
"Thom Merrilin had given him good advice; obviously her     
spies had missed some of the notes he had slipped into      
Rand's pockets. But the rest? It was madness. He could not  
have had this for an answer on the other side of that       
ter'angreal. It was not possible, surely." (Moiraine's      
thoughts in the Heart of the Stone)

"'Unless...Does this come from your answers in the          
ter'angreal? Cairhien, and Callandor, and Rhuiidean? I      
told  you those answers can be cryptic. You could be        
misunderstanding the, and that could prove fatal. To more   
than you.'"(Moiraine in conversation with Rand)

"No one may step through more than once. Only once. You     
may ask three questions, but you must ask all three and     
hear the answers before you may leave. Frivolous questions  
are punished, it seems, but it also seems what may be       
serious for one can be frivolous coming from another. Most  
importantly, questions touching the Shadow have dire        
consequences...If you asked about the Black Ajah, you       
might be returned dead, or come out a gibbering madwoman,   
if you came out at all. As for Rand...I am not certain it   
is possible to ask a question about the Dragon Reborn that  
does not touch the Shadow in some way."(Moiraine in

Unlike the ter'angreal for the accepted in Tar Valon, the

Jay, no offense, but don't you have anything better to do   
than ask me? I borrowed most of the stuff from compilations 
done by other people. The rest was found when I reread TSR  
and while my friend reread the series. It wasn't very hard  
and didn't take that long to make. Besides, if I'm here to  
discuss wot and I'm semi in charge of Jordan's fan club,    
shouldn't I know what I'm talking about? Shouldn't I be >>> 
interested in going indepth? And I've been here for three

brother? get's pretty d*mn boreing the thousandth time I've 
seen it?  There are some of us who like to go beyond the    
first obvious questions and give Jordan's works the credit  
they are worth. Someone on Internet has CREATED a Dark One

have everything in a text file and I've figured out that    
Prodigy's messages are roughly sixty character's wide and   
sixty one-sixty two lines long. I have adapted all of the   
files I want to be uploadable into this format heading      
each "note" with a <note 1 of x> so that I know how much    
to copy to the clip board. I have Prodigy for Windows, so   
what I do is cut and paste things onto the bulletin board.  
It doesn't take me more than 20-30 minutes of Plus time to  
post everything I have in files. Also, I archive all of our 
conversations here in WoT. So, what I do is every week or   
so, export everything in this subject and then reply to     
the notes as I'm reading all in a text editor while I'm     
off-line. Then get on Prodigy again and paste my replies    
where I want them. For the past two or three months, I      
haven't gone over my two hour alotment and ever since I've  
started exporting, I've never gone over four hours. I save  
money this way! You should think of doing it. Moiraine      
Sorry to have jumped on your back before. I was a little    
offended.

Lews, thanks for the support. I was beginning to think      
that everyone just ignored all of my directional notes.     
There's some new stuff in Export this that I typed out      
from previous issue of The Chronicles. On the first issue,  
I didn't have a laser printer, so I got someone else to     
type out and print up the guide to WoT. Thus, I didn't      
have the info in a file. So, Egwene's summary of Eye of     
the World is available in the Export this subject now.

I meant dimwit affectionately. I'm a trifle annoyed that    
everyone seems to ignore me. If you took it the wrong way, I
will break our rules for once and say I'm sorry. You must   
understand that for everyone's protection we devised a rule 
that under no circumstances may anyone in this club write   
anything that is meant to be offensive. The reason being    
because there was a bunch of misunderstandings about a year 
or so ago which lead to the infamous apoligy board. Our     
members found the whole thing so rediculous that we promised
eachother never to say the S word again (s o r r y). This   
means that if we find something on the board personally     
offensive, take a second and try to find another way of     
looking at it. I assure that I think that absolutely no one 
on the Robert Jordan board is really a dimwit. I hang out   
here for the intelligent conversations that do occur much   
more often then anywhere else I've been. Again, if I        
offended you, I assure that it was not intended to offend.  
Please remember that always...Moiraine

What if we look at the motives for killing Asmodean?        
Someone didn't want Rand learning about his powers, but     
Lanfear always said she wanted him to learn so they could   
rule together.  After falling into the Ter'angreal, even if 
she got back, would she really want Asmodean dead?          
(Regrettable - I liked him.)                                
And what about Lan and Nynaeve?  Moiraine's an interesting >
lady, but would she really be kind enough to give Lan to    
Nynaeve after she died?  Especially since Nynaeve seems only
to want to destroy Moiraine...                              
I'm lost on the Tigraine/Shaiel thing, though.  I guess I'm 
really behind on some things...Anyone care to explain?      
Has anyone noticed how close the names Ilyena and Elayne    
sound?  Is this foreshadowing?  Lews married Ilyena - will  
Rand marry Elayne???                                        
Just some thoughts, but let me know what you think.

I'm not sure about motives for killing Asmodean. As for     
Moiraine, she's not as  severe as she seems. She WANTS      
Nynaeve and Lan to be together, though she knows Nynaeve is 
set against her. Remember, Nynaeve hates  her for doing     
something she had to do to save the world, bring the Two    
Rivers people into the fight, so it's really an unfounded   
hatred. I wouldn't be surprised if Nynaeve becomes a Blue,> 
and becomes very much like Moiraine.                        
Ok, Tigraine/Shaiel: in the first few books, Tigraine was   
listed in the glossary. She was the Daughter-heir of Andor, 
and married Taringail Damodred, bearing a son, Galad. Then  
her brother Luc disappeared, and so did she, into the Waste 
a few years before the Aiel War. Shaiel appeared in the     
Waste a few years before the war, too, and asked to become a
Far Dareis Mai. She said she regretted leaving her husband  
and baby son on the other side of the Spine. Near the start 
of the Aiel War, she and a clan chief fell in love, and     
during the war she got pregnant and  kept fighting, all the>
way to Dragonmount, where she gave birth to Rand and died.  
Her Aiel husband (if they actually married, I forgot) led a 
squad into the Blight, and in one battle he was given a     
fatal wound. He returned to his squad and said the man who  
killed him looked like Shaiel. If Shaiel IS Tigraine, then  
the man who killed Rand's father was Luc, since, being      
brother and sister, they should have a family resemblance.  
And Luc has turned evil through merging with Isem, if that's
what he did. So it all makes sense.                         
                                                            
As for Elayne/Ilyana, yeah I too noticed. The Wheel weaves->
in  mysterious ways <G>. Rand will probably marry Elayne.   
And Aviendha. And Min. Min knows she has to share Rand,  as 
 does Elayne, and among Aviendha's people, it's acceptable  
for a man to have more than one wife, and since they're all 
friends, they'll probably live with it. Rand will be a very 
tired husband, though <VBG>

Nynaeve's dislike for Moi probably has more to do with Lan  
than the Two Rivers folk.                                   
I think the Battle Ajah is the only one suitible for a woman

     For some reason, I have always hoped that Rand would   
marry (or choose, if he is never able to marry) Min.  Out of
the three, I like her the best.  I don't suppose anyone out 
there has discovered some hint as to which of the three will
get him (if any of them do)?

If I had to take a geuss it would be Elayne.  Elayne looks  
like Ilyena, will make Rand her warder, and Min siad she    
will share her husband with two others.  An affair could    
kind of hurt the prestige of a royal family.<G>

 As for who Rand marries, I don't know. But if you noticed  
all three SHARE him.

     I had hoped that the "sharing" would end after Tarmon  
Gaidon (if he survives).  Oh well-- just my romantic side   
getting the better of me <g>. Nothing indicates this would  
happen except the wishful thinking of Elayne and Min (Av    
seems determined to deliver Rand safely to Elayne).

  How can all three share him?  Lets say Rand is to prudish 
to have three wives. (Or maybe to smart? Ha Ha).  Scenario: 
                                                            
3 to share Rand:  1. Elayne Bonds him as warder.            
                  2. Min marries Rand.                      
                  3. Aviendha and Rand have child.  There   
was some indication this might already be started. >>>      
When Wise Women & Avi were talking in Cairhein about Avi's  
success with Rand might be better than thought, they quickly
stopped talking when Rand was around - flimsy, but possible 
support.

Wait a minute, how can you make the assumption that Shaiel  
and Tigraine are the same person? I'm confused. Would that  
make Rand and Elayne related somehow? Is this going to turn 
out to be another dissapointing situation like in Return of 
the Jedi?

Easy to make the assumption: all the facts fit together.    
Tigraine disappeared into the Waste shortly before the Aiel 
War. Shaiel was found in the Waste shortly before the Aiel  
War. Tigraine was married to Taringail and had baby son     
Galad. Shaiel regretted leaving her husband and baby behind.
Tigraine's brother, Luc, disappeared into the Blight, and we
have seen his return, evil. Rand's dad said he was killed-> 
by a man in the Blight that  looked like Shaiel. Family     
resemblance. But don't worry! Elayne and Rand aren't        
related. Rand and Galad are. They shared the same mother.   
Elayne's dad is Galad's dad, so they're related as well.    
Elayne and Rand have no parent in common, but technically   
Rand should have some sort of Andoran title of nobility in  
addition to all his other titles he's accumulated, because  
his mom was once the Daughter-Heir of Andor. Everything fits
together, if you just look. It's the Wheel's way of weaving 
the Patterns of all these people together <G>

However, I could be completely  wrong, and in the next      
couple books Jordan could throw in some twists, so we'll see
that Rand and Elayne ARE siblings, ala Return of the Jedi.  
And we'll also see that Ishamael is really Rand's father

If Rand hit Lanfear or Ishmael with the strongest balefire  
by combining with women with the the great sa'angreal could 
he change the pattern so that the DO was never freed in the 
Age of Legends?

More than likely they'd just destroy the Pattern and that   
would be the end. THE end. Not just an ending. When         
Moiraine warns Rand not to use Balefire, she says           
something to this effect. I think she mentions it when      
Rand kills the Dark Hounds that try to kill mat at the      
beginning of FOH. I don't have FOH right now so I cannot    
be more specific. Moiraine

That would create such huge paradoxes...I don't like it,    
largely because it would mean nothing in any of the books   
ever happened.  Rand & co. would cease to exist if he did   
that (if such an huge channeling is even POSSIBLE) because  
of the immense change.  I doubt the Pattern could handle    
such a strain, such a key thread being ripped out so far    
back.  It would fall apart like a tapestry that had threads>
torn out from the middle, threads that connected to         
countless others and were involved in key connections.  That
is the analogy that is used for the Pattern throughout the  
series; applying it here makes it seem unlikely that such a 
massive use of balefire would be the ending.  In addition,  
from a purely aesthetic viewpoint, it seems like a collasal 
copout; that nothing ever really happened because it was all
undone.  No Last Battle or anything.

I really do begin to appreciate your Rand's prison idea. Did
you read my analysis? I included it and gave a decently     
detailed report for it, considering I had been working on   
the bloody thing all day and was extremely tired when I     
finally finished it...Moiraine

Add to that paradox our understanding of the Dark One's     
prison (i.e., he's imprisoned by the Wheel of Time which    
weaves the Pattern but is also somehow woven back *into* the
Pattern). Therefore, destroying the Pattern would destroy   
the Wheel which would free the DO.

I just updated my books and I've decided that your          
subscription is up as of the August issue. I'll send you a  
little note saying that, don't worry. (really, you've been  
riding on my generosity for a couple of newsletter, but I   
figured that all of those who were the originals to         
subscribe deserved many freebies and my thanks!) But, the   
file in Pred&Thts is an updated version of TC. I've even >> 
updated it since I've uploaded it since I have found some   
more dreams of Rands! Stupid man, he's had more dreams than 
anyone else combined. To bad their all non prophetic!

There are all sorts of avenues left open to "evil deities"  
in fantasy once their universe is destroyed. Most notably,  
I'll refer you to Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melnibone     
series. The primary goal of the Lords of Chaos (the         
controlling evil entities) was to destroy the universe (at  
the end of a millenium) in order to recreate it under their 
own fashion. They succeeded quite well.         --Machin

    In the next book, Lord of Chaos, does anyone think Rand 
will start kick some Red Ajah butt? They no longer have a   
reason for existing now that Rand has claimed all men who   
can channel.                                                
    Another thought, how will Rand keep from going crazy? I 
think he will get the two great sa'angreal, get Nynaeve (the
strongest woman) and together they will somehow cleanse     
Saidin. Rand made a comment about this somewhere in Fires of
Heaven. He was wondering if there was some possibility of   
shielding or cleansing Saidin.

It seems to be a good possibility that the taint will be    
healed.If the Eye of the World was created by tapping       
through the taint and the Aes Sedai back then were able to  
get some of the pure saidin,then that shows that it must be 
possible still.There must be some flaws to the DO's taint,in
order for that to happen.Also,if the DO has the ability to  
taint saidin,then most likely there is a way to cleanse it. 
The only thing is,though,I have thought all along (and also 
because of some of RJ's comments) that there is going to be 
some twist to all of this.I think he has some ultimate      
scheme worked out that will be much different at the end of 
the series than the "happily ever after" endings we see in  
most series' endings.Everything right now seems to fall     
right into Rands hands,not easily,but still a little too    
easy.Somehow I think that RJ is "lulling" us into a false   
sense of security and that he is going to "drop the hammer" 
sometime soon and that Rand is going to find things much    
tougher than we realize (or Rand realizes).I think that     
the ending is going to be something that none of us expect. 
And I kind of hope that is how it will be because the series
is already different from any I personally have read and to 
have a different ending than most would surely make this    
series stick out in my mind even more than it already does. 
I think we are going to have a bittersweet ending.But,I     
certainly am not RJ,and I certainly don't know.(But I'd like
 to.....)

Interesting note, the eye of the world was made with        
thirteen of the weakest male channelers.  I think the words 
were "just barely trained" or something like that.          
  Anyways on to the Red Ajah.  There has been questions     
about what the different ajahs did before the breaking.  I  
believe that with a lost of power athey had to divide their 
responsiblities.  The red on the other hand started         
something entirly new.  Why?                                
    Well, We know there were Aei Sedai that went to the dark
side during the war of the Shadow.  Therefore the begining  
of the Black Ajah.  Now, the Dark one also knows that as the
first Dragon dies, it will be the second dragon that defeats
him again.  So, who better to look for that next Dragon than
Aei Sedai, and who better to deal with him than an Ajah     
who's purpose is to hunt down men that can channel.         
Therefore I believe the Red Ajah was started and is still   
almost entirely Black Ajah.  I'm sure there are member of   
the Red Ajah that are not Black Ajah, such as Elaida whom   
I believe is truely afraid of men that can channel.         
   Well, can't think of anything else to say <G>.

Ronald,   I also doubt that Elaida is black ajah. Her Keeper
of the Chronicles is black ajah and is trying to undermine  
Elaida.                                                     
   I personally think that Rand should gather all red ajah  
together, give them the opportunity to pick another color or
be permanently stilled. He must learn to be hard and deal   
with his enemies harshly. (Aiel philosophy)    ---->>>      
   If Rand had the Great sa'angreal, the statuette, could a 
circle of thirteen manage to shield him. They refer to the  
process as being ALMOST impossible to overcome by a male    
channeler. The word 'almost' would indicate that a very     
strong individual with the ultimate sa'angreal could        
overcome the circle. Any comments?????

Oh, contraro, Rogosh. The Eye of the World was made with a  
hundred women and men working in unison and all gave their  
lives in the effort.                                        
<EOW, Chapter , Meetings at the Eye, (p744)>                
"It was the first days of the Breaking of the World, when   
the joy of victory over the Dark One turned bitter with     
the knowledge that all might yet be shattered by the        
weight of the Shadow. A hundred of them made it, men and    
women together. The greatest Aes Sedai works were always    
done so, joining _saidin_ and _saidar,_ as the True Source  
is joined. They died, all, to make it pure, while the       
world was torn around them. Knowing they would die, they    
charged me to guard it against the need to come. It was     
not what I was made for, but all was breaking apart, and    
they were alone, and I was all they had. It was not what I  
was made for, but I have kept the faith."                   
Of course, now we know that it was NOT in the first days    
after the defeat of the Dark One, though perhaps it WAS in  
the first days of the Breaking. Coulin was sixteen when     
the Dark One was resealed into Shayol Ghul and it must      
have been over sixty three years after that that the Eye    
of the World was made and when the Stone was created and    
Callandor put in place. Because Jonai was sixty three when  
he left the Hall of Servants and Paaren Disen (Paradise).   
It's my theory that where Shayol Ghul and the Blight now    
lies is where Collam Daan once lay beneath the Sharom, but  
that's only a guess. Moiraine

I love you! Do you know that? I mean, that's exactly what   
I think about Moiraine's character and suprisingly that's   
exactly what I think about Nynaeve. I think that they are   
much more alike than Nynaeve is willing to admit to and     
I've often thought that it would be extremely ironic if     
she chose Blue Ajah and continue Moiraine's fight against   
the Dark One w/ Lan at her side (when Myrelle passes him    
on to her). I thought it would be ironic, that doesn't      
mean that it will necessarily happen, or even that I put    
too much stock in it happening. I just believe that         
Nynaeve and Moiraine are much more similar then Egwene and  
Moiraine. To add to that list, I think Moghedian's right in 
there w/ them which explains why Nynaeve took such a        
liking to her specifically. I think Moghedian is A-(loaned  
out my FOH book)(she's the one who dresses like             
Birgitte-also ironic).                                      
As for Elayne possibly being Ilyena reborn. I'm not sure    
that Ilyena could channel. I've raised this point when      
someone tried to place a timeperiod on when Lews must have  
broken up w/ Lanfear by and have married Ilyena. The War    
of the Shadow lasted for three generations. From when       
Charn was probably in his twenties to when his grandson,    
Coumin was sixteen and it was announced that the Forsaken   
had been bound w/ the Dark One in Shayol Ghul. At the       
least, the War of the Shadow must have lasted sixty years   
(nothing near the ten years that Lews cited in EOW)         
Therefore, it is altogether possible that Ilyena was born   
at the beginning of the War of the Shadow had Lews's        
children mid war and had grown to mid age by the end of     
the War, if she was unable to channel. Consider this also.  
For Lews to have died when he did, that meant that the War  
was over and the Forsaken already bound. As a matter of     
fact, it could have been any number of years AFTER the War  
that Lews actually went mad and killed everyone who was     
close to him. Also, Lews was middle aged looking when he    
died, and Moghedien was two hundred years old when she is   
imprissoned and considered still young for an Aes Sedai.    
Thus, Lews could have been over four hundred centuries      
years old when he died. Consider the number of relatives    
he could have had by then if Ilyena was able to channel     
and had been a part of his life for a couple of centuries.  
I imagine that they only spent a small portion of Lews's    
life together and that he only had a handful of kids when   
he went mad and did the act that named him Kinslayer.       
Thus, I don't think that Ilyena could channel.              
Additionally, she didn't save her children or anything      
which she might have been able to do should she have been   
able to channel. I imagine that she would have protected    
her children, at least, if she had the opportunity to do    
so. Clearly she didn't.
