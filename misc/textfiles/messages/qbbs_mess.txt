Barron,
 
   I was not attempting to yell at you.  I guess it was just that everyone
expected to have the editors included in the release.  As far as I know Adam
does not want to show faveritism and so will not include the full screen
editors in any package.   Sorry if I looked like I was yelling at you.  It
was unintensional.
 
   However,  I thought that you might like to know that SHEDIT will be
released soon.  I am supposed to have the docs done by Wed so I would look
for it by the end of the week.

Ok, I will keep an eye out for it. Since I run a Stand Alone BBS It would
help if you could give me some phone numbers of BBSes where I could get it.
When QBBS 2.00 came out I only had 3 numbers where I could get it and I only
had access on 2 of them. needless to say the 2 I had access to were busy all
day long! & The 3rd one would only give new users 5 min and 10k per day. Made
it a might difficult to DL the QBBS files!
 
As for thinking you were yelling, When you CAPATALIZE almost every other
word like you did it tends to convey the impression of anger. Sorry I
missunderstood.

I hope 200 people don't beat me to answering this, but...
 
To force QuickBBS to exit to the batch file, you need to use the -e
option; for instance, to re-log the user after he/she has left the
BBS and wants back in, you need a line like "QuickBBS -R -E0" in your
batch file.
 
At least that's the way it works on *my* system.. but I only have
v1.00 ... anyone know where I can get an update? <eyebrow wiggle>

This is the first of any problems I have heard about SHEDIT and QuickBBS
getting along.  Simply place SHEDIT.EXE in your QuickBBS directory and enter
SHEDIT.EXE as the message editor string in QCONFIG.  You should be all set
once you do those things!

The correct errorlevel statement I use in DOS is this:

The equals sign (=) may have been causing the problem.

Just some thoughts here.
 
1...a way to printout the list of the menu (menuedit)
2...blinking colors for menus.
3...a goto line-lable or gosub line-lable in the questionaire command    
language.
4...the ability to change direction of read in mid step
5...the ability to look up in the user-list when getting ready to post     a
message.  (what would really make this option super is when the     list is
printed, allow the user to enter a line number and the     converts to the
name requested...Hmmmm)
6...status line, list how long user has left on system and what menu    
they are in...
7...you have export of messages just fine, how about import and edit of    
messages???
8...when exporting to printer...can we have a tof option?

Subj: Message Data Base

     (For only being a user of QuickBBS and not a QuickBBS sysop, I sure do
ask alot of questions don't I?)
 
     It used to be under 1.02 that when the user did a Type 22 check for
personal mail it would show all messages that were marked as being new since
the last session.  Now it seems that once the user has read his mail at the
beginning of the session the switches are set off and the Type 22 no longer
works.  As I recall on Version 1.02 the Type 22 could be run successfuly as
many times during the session as the user wanted.  Now it can only be run
once (assuming that the user didn't read the mail when he first logged in.) 
My personal preference would be for the new msgs to stay marked during the
entire session as they do in TBBS.  Another option might be to add a question
to Type 22 asking the user if he wants to see the previously recieved mail as
well.  But if you do that you might add the "Starting at msg number:" prompt
as well.  Just suggestions.
 
     There seems to be a problem with the user's last message read pointer. 
I can log in here and recieve a bunch of new messages, read them, but then
when I go to read the rest of the messages in those areas QBBS will report
"No New Messages".  Then I go to look for the last message that I really did
read and it will be 100 messages back in the base.  I'm not sure what the
problem here is, but I can offer some ideas.  Perhaps the pointer gets set as
the user reads messages?  So that if the pointer is set at 4000 and the user
read a new msg at 6000 when he does a Read New it starts scanning at 6000
instead of 4000 as it should.  Maybe?  This would cause problems for the user
switching areas instead of doing a Read of combined boards (area 0).  Or
perhaps the pointer is not getting set correctly when the message base goes
through its nightly pack and renumber?  Any ideas?

This is a real NASTY bug, I am fully aware of it and should be fixed in the
next release.

ATTENTION ALL:  Do not use the ADD USER function of USEREDIT (F8 key)!!!

I have used the BT-286 program on my Equity III+ (12MHz) and can say that
there seems to be no difference at all.  Do read the Binkley Echomail
conference about using it.  They talk about the technical aspects.

Well, I just tried this on-line after I read this message and had no
troubles adding a user and no Run Time Errors.  I don't have alot of the
problems that others are reporting.  The only 2 problems that I have are with
the lastread message pointers and with upgrading a user's access while he is
on-line, i.e., the user is logged off about 2 minutes later and upon looking
at his record with useredit, it shows 300+ minutes used.

Bob, you arn't the only one with that problem.  I've been working with Chris
Brown here in Waco and he's run across the same exact problem with the same
exact error message.  What's really strange however is that he had V2 up and
running for about 3 days prior to this happening. Now we cant get it to come
up at all under V2 and have had to fall back to V1.02.
 
What I suspect has happened in Chris's case is that one of the files that
got converted either didn't convert properly, or that he ran a  version 1.02
program such as UEDIT on a version 2 USERS.BBS file.
 
Adam, Please list which files are effected by CONVERT so I can cross ref
this problem and see if by deleting these files and firing up V2 will correct
it.

     OOOPS!  I released SHEDIT with some bugs that I hadn't detected.  They
are fixed now and any of you that have had trouble with SHEDIT kicking you
off, that problem should be fixed as well.  The new version also supports the
IBM's extended keys ( the cursor pad ) as well as makes an attempt to handle
the VT-100 arrow keys in remote mode ( I have not had the chance to test this
but it should work <BIG GRIN> ).  Please feel free to complain and send your

     One, SHEDIT was developed using PC-DOS v3.3.  Two, since it runs on
MS-DOS v3.3 I will assume that the gentelman claiming that SHEDIT wont run on
MS-DOS v3.3 is not running on standard hardware.  Please if you have problems
with SHEDIT ( or any ShareWare product ) tell the author  ( in this case me
), don't go makeing your own conclusions since you haven't even seen the

  I've had it happen on One ocassion, a user did indeed answer Yes to the
full
 screen editor (even though I had written a rather strong message in my new
 user file stating NOT to use the full screen editor), what it did was
stayed
 in the editor until I arrived to see it was down, after I locally exited
the
 editor and it noticed the carrier drop and ran back to binkley and set up
 properly.
  I do have a solution although I havn't done it yet (got busy), but what I
 might try is have two config files, one of them will have my editor dos
 command string, the other will not. What I'll do is when I hit my F1 key in
 binkley before going to local Quickbbs (ala Quickbbs -L), I'll rename my
 appropriate config files so that it'll read locally with the editor, and
 remote users will not get the editor option. I don't think this will cause
 a problem that I know of, I've yet to try it though.

Subj: Errorlevels in local


  Can anyone tell me (ADAM?) if errorlevels work in local mode? I set a
 errorlevel in local mode (Quickbbs -L -E5) in a attempt to have the system
 check for outgoing mail (echo and net) when I log off, it does'nt appear to
 work though, as soon as it exits (and quick does announce that when it
 boots local that it'll exit with a errorlevel of 5) it just reboots binkley
 and does'nt go through my Echogen and mailscan routines in my batch file,
 my batches work fine if I log on remotely from my other system, but don't
 seem to work local. I just want to know if I should check my batches some
 more or if its a bug. Thanks.


PS Presently I just use a errorlevel F key out of binkley to check for mail
local after I log off local.

     Some people have reported a clear screen problem and I have noticed
that although it doesn't happen on my computer ( I use NANSI.SYS ) in local
mode It does happen to me in remote mode.  I have inserted a kludge that will
fix that and will be looking into getting it to work without the kludge.  The
problem seems to be that the ANSI driver in use doesn't interpret the screen
clearing code correctly ( "ESC[2J" ).  I know of no other way to clear the
screen using ANSI codes.  If anyone can help me please feel free.

     I must have remembered the way that it worked incorrectly.  It would be
nice if it did just Mark the msgs like TBBS does so that they can be refered
to multiple times.
 
     When doing a Read Selective on From, To or Subject, Quick starts with
the very first message in the area and starts scanning forward.  It would be
nice if the user could narrow the search a little by putting in the msg
number to start the scan at.
 
      And my recurring wish:  it would be nice if the Editor commands
included A>gain so that the msg being replied to could be viewed again with
out saving the msg first.

What seems *really* odd to me is that I never had version 1.02 up --
hence, I've never run convert.  My board is in the very early stages of
creation.  Was following along in the doc file, after running the config
program, creating menus, etc.  Got to the point where it says 'Power it up
for the first time.'  But I've never been able to get it going.  I thought
that maybe the system couldn't find the config file, so I copied to each and
every directory (just to be sure), but still get the same run-time error.

This only seems to happen when you move someone's security level up or down,
sometimes other places.  I guess you can say it is random, that is why I am

ECHOKDUP hasn't been changed to accomodate Version 2.00 structural changes.

To my knowledge the Z on the end of the string will reset everything you
just told the modem.  This could cause the modem to NOT answer the phone,
being that the default for S0 is 0.

Hi Adam!
    Well, I'm just about ready to switch my board over to QuickBBS but am
having one small problem before I can turn it loose.  For the life of me I
can't get BBSLIST to run for me.  I have tried to get it to run with a type 7
and a type 15 exit but am getting the same results in either case.  The board
goes out to either shell or exit but it always comes back to the QuickBBS
menu.  I have placed the BBSList file in the QuickBBS directory and have
entered on the menu line a type 7 with BBSLIST.EXE 2400 (just to test at that
speed).  It just comes back to the menus.  I have successfully gotten the
TODAY (semi-door to work) but, just can't seem to figure out BBSlist.  Is it
me or is it the 1.02version of the BBSList?  (Probably me).  I'm running out
of ideas to try to get it to work.  Any suggestions would be really
appreciated.
    Hoping soon to have it figured out and up and running (with registration
fee soon to follow).
   Thanks in advance for your help.
                                         Charlie

Subj: Re: MENUS

 
How about an ability to call a menu and pass it a parameter?
 
For instance, instead of doing a type 2 menu call, you could do (for
example's sake) a type 45 and pass it the menu name and another piece of
data, as in "MSGSMENU 23".   Then, in the menu, have a special character
designated as the "variable" to represent whatever data is passed to that
menu.  For instance, you could use CTRL-B (since CTRL-A is already taken) and
place it in the 
Optional Data area (along with anything else, but in this example, I'll just
use the CTRL-B by itself).   Whatever data was next to the menu name i this
type 45 call would be substituted for all CTRL-B's found in that menu.
 
This would make it a heck of a lot easier for creating all those message
area R)ead, P)ost, S)can, etc... menus.  You could make a generic one and
pass it the board number.   Ideally, you would have at least a couple of
these variables, and they would work like a dos batch file.  Maybe 3 of them
(I would think that would be enough to handle most things) and use
ctrl-b,ctrl-c,ctrl-d to represent the data passed to the menu in the Optional
Data area. 
 
This would cut my number of menus at LEAST in half and make it a whole lot
easier to maintain and make changes to the message areas.

is not what I get after the file is saved. I have no explaination for this. 
I have used used TDOODLE for ALL my PCBoard screens and menus, it takes up
less memory, less disk space and is very simple to use.  (No animation, but a
polll of my users said they don't like watching a "neat" little screen
display every time they log on or as a menu)  This is compounded by users
that log on at 300 to 9600 baud, what looks good to some is either too slow
or too fast to others.

I will be more than happy to help anyone in the Columbus area after the 17th.
I am tied up by to tight deadlines at work and I must have them done by this
weekend. I'm still trying to figure out how. I went out tonight for a couple
of hours just to clear my head and grasp hold of reality again before I get
pulled back under tomorrow. Give me a holler anytime after this weekend, my
board is up 24 hours/day normally, and can be reached at (614) 476-4967. I
will say this though, I would give serious thought to converting from
whatever you are running now to anything else. For what my opinion is worth,
the whole BBS software game over the last 7-8 months has been to see who can
come out with the mostest first and as a result, we, the Sysops of the world,
are having to suffer through bugs that are the result of hurrying to be
first. I know this is probably not the kind of message that everyone wants to
see in this echo, but like I said it is my opinion, based on my experience.
There may be others out there in modem land, and I'm very sure there are, who
love QuickBBS and wouldn't use anything else. Well, wait till the first time
they have a mail bundle tossed 4 times before they catch it. (Happened to me
today) Then have to go back and kill all the duplicates manually because the
killdups function doesn't seem to work properly. I know this may sound crazy
but it did happen and I hope to get a message in here to Adam Hudson sometime
tomorrow with details. I am honestly about ready to trash the idea of running
a BBS and just run BinkleyTerm and Confmail as a point to get the Conferences
I want to read and the heck with everything else. Sorry for the long
monologue but as you can see by the date/time mark it is late and I am really
miffed over the problems this package seems to have with EchoMail, especially
packets produced with ConfMail.

It will work with the QuickBBS formatted Areas.BBS file.  Setup as follows
and it will work:
 
SET AUTOECHO=c:\autoecho
 
cd \quickbbs

copy areas.bbs \autoecho\areas.bbs
cd \autoecho
autoecho
copy areas.bbs \quickbbs\areas.bbs
cd \quickbbs
MailToss -K
oMMM ......
etc.....
 
Make sure you create a SYSTEM1.BBS file in the AutoEcho directory that has
the Message Path set to wherever you told Quick the Matrix Message Areas
were. Make sure you set the message type to MATRIX/Net Mail.
Make sure you run AutoEcho AFTER EchoGen and BEFORE MailToss.  BEFORE
MailScan and EchoGen (scan), and in all cases before oMMM.
 
This worked fine here (after I created the SYSTEM1.BBS file with the proper
NetMail message path in it, and put it, AutoEcho, and the AREAS.BBS files in
the subdir pointed to by the AUTOECHO environment variable.

cannot use it I am not going to register it!  What are you, a loogan or
something?
 
Secondly, I installed 2.00 when I finally managed to get a copy after
release, and quite a few of the problems that it had with 1.02 have been
fixed, however there are EXTREMELY SERIOUS FLAWS IN THE PROGRAM THAT IN MY
HUMBLE OPINION MAKE IT UNUSABLE IN MY PARTICULAR CASE.  For that reason you
can expect that I shall not register it until those problems have been fixed.
 
To enumerate the idiocies and non-FTSC crap that QuickBBS does but should
not:
 
1)   It MUST NOT put sh*t at the end of a MATRIX message.  Tear lines are
for      echomail messages, not netmail.  I hate the bippity-bop flippancy
with
     which this has been added and subtracted from version to version.  One
     minute it is there, the next it is gone.  Anyone tossing the coin to
see
     if it is fixed in the next version?
 
2)   The stupid fucker stops sending data when the modem drops the CTS line.
     Yet it insists that it does fossil I/O.  Since it is THE RESPONSIBILITY
     OF THE FOSSIL DRIVER AND ONLY THE FOSSIL DRIVER TO DO ALL HANDSHAKING,
     WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS LITTLE TURD DOING EVEN LOOKING AT THE FUCKING
MODEM
     CONTROL REGISTER?  If Adam needs help accessing the Fossil Driver
     correctly, I have a WHOLE LIBRARY of Turbo Pascal 4.0 routines that do
     FOSSIL revision 4 and 5 I/O properly.
 
3)   The program seems to inspect the MCR all the time and doing crap that
it      should not be, yet at importandt times (like when it is trying to
     download), the shitter just sits there idly waiting for a char to come
in
     even after the caller has hung up!  Whatsa matter, forget to check the
     carrier, or just forget to detect the message from the Fossil that
     carrier was dropped?
 
4)   See previous posts for more problems with it!

Thank-you,  All the further info I can give you is that the EchoGen looks
like it is trying to display the AREA:xxxxxx line from the top of the
message, however it appears to be displaying several extra characters from
the message(?) before it.  It usually produces anywhere from 5 to 30 IBM
graphics chars intermixed with beeps and bells, and occasionally other ASCII
control codes.  I have compared the junk to the message contents, but can't
seem to find a match-up for it.

Thanks again.  That covers the major complaints.  I know that alot of people
will be happy with that option (especially everyone who runs AutoEcho and
Server, or has to communicate with one :-) ).
 
Other problems, how do I force Quick to not stop sending data whenever the
modem drops CTS.  As you know, with a locked DTE/DCE with the HST of 19200
baud, the data goes from the fossil to the modem in 64 byte (1/2 modem
buffer) blocks.  I have 16K buffers in the fossil, and there is no reason
Quick can't pump them full of data and let the fossil handle the CTS like it
has been told to by the B,0,19200 option.  It just needlesly degrades the
performance of the entire system (when I run at 14Mhz with a 1600K disk cache
and it ALMOST goes as fast as OPUS 1.03b running at 8Mhz under DESQview, 512K
cache, with a Local Opus reading/writing messages, a Clippered application
madly working on a 1M database, and an MBP Cobol Compile running all at the
same time under DESQview.)

I have run into a "seemed" problem with ECHOGEN. A lot of people are useing
SIRIUS to respond to messages in the net. When one of these messages come to
a QUICKBBS 2.0 system Echogen will handle it correctly and send it on to
other systems, but will not import it into the BBS itself. The problem is
really with the SIRIUS user, they don't have it configured right to add the
ORIGIN Line as well as the SIRIUS Tag line, but it is such a widespread
mis-setup that Quick will have to be able to handle it. With to 60 or so
echoes I handle, 30 to 40 messages a day are not tossed.
  
Adam, I would appreciate a response I can post in the National SIRIUS Echo.

Adam,
     In addition to all the problems I see noted in previous messages, we
are experiencing other problems:
1. Whenever a caller "pulls the plug" instead of logging off normally, the
board crashes (didn't happen in 1.02). This is no big thing, since we run the
board through a recycle batch file. The only problem is that the time used
that day in the USERS.BBS file is set to 0.
2. Download limits are not checked for Zmodem or SEAlink. Apparently Ymodem
works just fine. This was a problem in 1.02 also. In conjunction, the bytes
downloaded that day, in the USERS.BBS file, is not updated for Zmodem and
SEAlink transfers.
3. User's time used being set to some high number and time used that day
display set to something like 65535. We had this occur twice, both times when
a user was returning from a batch Zmodem transfer.
4. Screen does not clear after log off, causing the new fossil driver
messages to be printed on top of the last user screen (problem did not exist
1.02).

You bring up a very valid point/possibility.  Say Adam, is there a

   If you are using v 2.00, then you need not put a 3 after MAILTOSS. 
Simply tell QuickBBS (by using QConfig) that your Net Mail board is # 3. 
That seeeeeeeems to work just fine for me.  Hope this helps .....

spell it?)  I would like to be able to leave them with a short file.  I have
seen it done before.
 
Does anybody know where I can get a FOSSIL driver that has ringback?

Well, I trashed my Zmodem protocol because I thought it was the culprit
since the error occured directley after using or attempting to use it, or at
least it might have had something to do with it... But the "bug" has
re-occured again and someone else's log got 6+ hours added on, so Zmodem
was'nt the problem after all (but it did'nt work anyway). I have'nt been able
to pinpoint a pattern associated with the "bug", it seems to happen at
random, although so far, it has happened only to people who have not logged
in for at least a couple weeks-has'nt bothered the active users yet. I have
put a message on my opening screen pertaining to that "bug" in hopes that
users won't think the sysop is the one who's logging them off.

that is not what it was but i got it figured out!
my modem was not acutally recieving the S0=1 nor anything else for that
matter (well mabye somthing sice it was replying). first of all my modem does
not like the CR before the INI. string it has to be removed. The other was
the way my CONFIG.SYS was set up. I was messing with a multi tasker and it
re-did my config to suit it I was forced to go back and put X00.SYS back in
and other stuff. the order in wich you install some things affects
operations. X00.sys has to come last or for some reason on my machine (a
clone) the modem does not always recive the commands. this is my theory. now
it accept everything!

Keith:
I have no problem with you listing your problems with QuickBBS my problem is
language like yours is why we will lose the PRIVILEGE to have a BBS on the
telephone lines.  If you think that having BBS is a RIGHT you are badly
mistaking as it is only a privilege. If you follow the news on the F.C.C. you
will find that they are under a LOT of pressure to get us out of the BBS's
and get rid of us.
With people like you using that type of language (which by the way is
illegal per F.C.C. laws) we will lose this fine hobby. So if you can find it
in your view PLEASE use the english language in a manner that will let me
continue to have a BBS operating.
Yes, F.C.C. does have some control over the telephone company.

Don't forget to advise anyone that tries this that they better tell
Qconfig that Ansi graphics are not available, but allow the user to
toggle them on once logged on.  If you have an editor declared in
Qconfig, and you have ANSI allowed, Quick will ask any new user that
says yes to ansi graphics if they want to use the full screen editor.
THen, when they go to enter a message it's a guaranteed lock up for a
remote user.

Not true. The board number for netmail is set up in Qconfig now, not

I've noticed the same amount of time spent. It usually exceeds 300
minutes.  Sometimes as much as 400 minutes appears in that field.

Oh yes there is such a thing as Ansi music.  In fact, I just saw a
program somewhere (didn't bother with it) for creating ansi screens
with music for use on bbs's, and I if I'm not mistaken, there was a
system around here that had a collection of ansi pictures with music.

One of the reasons I always like THEDRAW over any of the other ansi
editors was it's abiltity to save a portion of the screen.  Maybe
you're missing something (or creating animated screens which must be
saved in full).  Next time try this. Create the screen, hit ALT-B to
mark the portion of the screen you want to do something with and when
you mark the end of the block, THEDRAW will ask you if you want to
"M)ove, C)opy, S)ave... etc.".  Hit S and and you can save just the
portion you block marked.  The "S)ave" option won't appear if you're
creating an animated screen or more accurately, it won't appear if you
are in ANImated mode (shown at the bottom) even if the screen you're
creating does not contain any animation.

Lets see if I can explain this one...  After entering about three
netmail messages the other day, then logging off, I noticed that two
of the messages were found and exported quite quickly and there was
something like "Scanning the Quick-Net message base". That may not be
the exact statement. Then it said "Scanning the QuickBBS message base"
and found the third netmail message I had entered, but it appeared to
take a LOT longer to find and export this message.

What's the difference in the two methods and how is it determined?
Just curious.

To use PCBoard doors with QuickBBS, you run a little program right after the
user selects the door that creates a PCBOARD.SYS file.  The program, of
course is in your .BAT file.  There is one such program called QuickDOOR.  It
is available on my BBS at (501) 521-4734 or on the author's BBS at (501)

Subj: BBS registration

I need to correct a listing in your Registered User's List.  I am listed as
the registrant for v. 1.02.  In actuality, I was registering the software for
Dr. Rolf Roley, of Athens,GA. I am installing the software for him and acting
as co-sysop of his board, but the registration should be in his name, not
mine.  Thank you.
 
Looking forward to the release of 2.01!

   Now, you aren't suggesting a network separate from Fido-Net are you. If
you are it's not a good idea at all.

   Don't forget that EGA and VGA displays can go beyond 24 lines and that
full page displays like those for Desk Top Publishing DO go to the 66 line
maximum - an excellent reason for QuickBBS to allow a user to specify up to
66 lines per screen. NOW, if it would accomodate 132 column modes...

Subj: Viewing ASCII foles

I'm making progress in getting a BBS to be able to display ASCII text to
users that want to look at various files in a random manner, but I still need
some help!
 
I got Van Buerg's DRLIST and it works great from DOS.  I can call in
remotely and bring up a file, but when I try to call the program from a menu
(currently using V. 1.02 of QuickBBS) the program doesn't echo to the remote
screen.  On the local monitor it sits waiting with the prompt:
 
Enter Filename:
 
and the remote terminal freezes up.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Thanks in
advance!

Subj: Echogen/Echomail Toss Problems

Hi All!
   I'm busily converting my RBBS board over to QuickBBS but am having
extreme difficulty in getting Echogen to Toss the incoming mail.  More
specifically ECHOGEN -A -U -T goes and does it thing fine until it tries to
get PKXARC to unarc the incoming arced mail packets.  ECHOGEN finds the
correct filename in the correct directory as specified in the ECHOMAIL.CTL
file.  Then when ECHOGEN invokes PKXARC, PKXARC returns an errorlevel of 3
and the message PKXARC can't find -R.ARC is displayed!   For the life of me I
can't figure out where the -R is coming from?  Has anyone else encountered
this perplexing problem before?  Also, the MAILTOSS program works fine but
PKXARC is not envolved there.
   I just wanted to drop this message off first to see if anyone else had
seen this problem.  If not, I'll provide a more detailed description of what
my setup is and what's in the various CTL files. Thanks.

Not sure what to say on this one, maybe if I knew how the ANSI music worked

I use a Pascal version of SEA's code (I sat down and converted it), however
it has not been fully perfected and still has many problems.  The code acts
real strange and none of the problems make sense (what problems do?).

If you have other *.MSG files in that directory then EchoGen will account

You can give my system a call, there is a separate section for QuickBBS
related files (utilities and such).

There is programs already written to run RBBS-PC and PCBoard door programs
and things.

Right now I am not accepting beta-test sites, I have a small group of
testers already which I will most likely keep.  I like to keep the group
fairly small and managable.

It will compare the date on the message, so for local mail it is the time it
was entered on your system and for EchoMail is was the time it was entered on
the originating system.

Currently there is no option of where the messages files are placed, and

The first method is the quick shortcut way, if any problems are detected
when this first method is in progress then a full scan of the message base is
done.  Your third message must have had something MAILSCAN didn't like and
therefore did a complete scan.

If the other net-mail is from your system then you can get it in using
MAILTOSS, simply append a -F parameter in front of it.  You can refer to the

   The E-Mail selection isn't used at this time. What I would like to see is
this changed to something like "Usenet" or whatever and be processed just
like EchoMail EXCEPT, no Tear Line, Origin Line, or SEEN-BY's appended to the
message. I need a way to get my Usenet news groups out of QuickBBS without
the Fido-Net dependant information mentioned above. The MailIn/Out and
NewsIn/Out programs that I use to process outbound News adds a signature file
at the end of each message and a special ORGANIZATION environment variable
holds my Usenet compatible origin information. This is specific to the UFGATE
package which is what all the Gateways that I know of are running.

   It isn't possible to have a generic help system since no two QuickBBS
systems need look alike and usually don't. If one uses descriptions that
really tell what a selection does, users shouldn't need extensive help. At
least I've never had any complaints. My menus are available for D/L or F/Req
as CASP-MEN.ARC (all 80 or 90 of 'em!).

One of the most common causes of multiple tosses is a grunged mail archive. I
have published in this echo a batchfile fragment set that will get rid of the
offending archive before it trashes you. ANYTHING that uses an
internally-called Archiver that does not delete what it classifies as a
fragged file will cause the same set of problems.
 
QhichBBS is not perfect, but it is working well enough that I manage to run
52 echo areas and feed more than 20 other nodes with it. I like the speed,
space savings, and the fact that there is not much that has occurred that
wasn't either fixed or supplied with a workaround.

Such messages can be a consequence of the way that FrontDoor builds packets
- seems that it occasionally puts more than one NULL byte between packeted
messages, which causes some fields to look EXTREMEMLY odd. Jo has been
notified. I get around it by ARCmailing EVERYTHING that may contain more than
one message.

The WXmodem protocol does not operate at anything above 2400, now that I
think about it.  DSZ should go alright with the 19200 though.

The problem is that QuickBBS does NOT know the actual baud rate when you
lock the port.

No need to worry, the soon to be release 2.01 fixes this.  It will allow you

There are ANSI Cntl codes to produce music. If you'll look into the 'brief'
documentation that comes with 'MOONSONG".ARC it mayt provide you some clues. 
I think possibly that many sysops are as 'bad' as I in accidentally typing
the wrong character at times, I SURE am, and it is very possible to type a
'music' code rather than the one intended.

Is there something missing from the Shedit.ARC file?  The 'Quotes' aren't
there and there are no instructions in the .doc file to indicate what the
editor is looking for in a quote file eg. <QuoteFileName> or exactly how to
create this file.  The Cntl-KQ function puts (I suppose) one in Quote mode,
but reads that there is nothing there and I have yet to find a way in that
mode to create one, anytime you press ANY key that is supposedly a control
combination, as soon as you hit the Alphabetical Key in combination, you get
sent back to the message being edited.
.
AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE?????  I DO have a H.S. Diploma, with EXCELLENT
grades in English and have read the scanty (To say the least) documentation
of Shedit.  I am not degrading the Shedit program, it seems to otherwise work
great, it is just that the Editor startup line has my users (and ME) asking
questions about the reference to 'Quote', etc.
.
Sure would apreciate some help in this matter!

I just ran into something that I feel really needs to be addressed.  As you
know, Paging of the sysop is set in the Config.sys file.  I have three times
during the day that I allow myself to be available for chat, but I don't want
to be desterbed by the normal users during the rest of the day, However, I do
want a way that I can be paged by my special users on the off hours that I
would normally not be available for chat.

The problem here is that there is only one time slot for chat and there is
no way to make a ^G beep the console under present conditions.  I tried
making a file of ^G's that only my special people could get to at any time
but ran into a problem right off the bat.  It rings the users bell just fine
(drives them crazy), but nada on this end.  How about either implementing
more chat schedules (three at least) or creating a ^FG combination that can
be used in an .ASC file to ring the console bell? (preferablly both)!!!

I am haveing a problem with net & echo mail and was wondering if you had

When I log on locally and enter net or echomail the system does not pack it
up until a remote user logs off. Then it packs it up and moves it to the
outbound area.

I just changed to a HST 9600 modem and it didn't do that until then.

     I have been getting a lot of messages about SHEDIT logging people off

X00 v1.08 and SHEDIT was developed using OPUSCOMM v5.2.   If I am not
mistaken, v1.09[b|c] are beta test copies of X00 and therefore this is
probably a problem in the FOSSIL.
     Please, if someone is having this porblem and they are using X00 v1.08,
let me know so that I can narrow down the posibilities.

between Opus and Quick several times now.   But I also happen to think that
the FTSC standard 1.MSG, 2.MSG, etc etc is the absolute most absurd thing I
have ever seen, which is the major reason I want to run QuickBBS.

But all the problems (real and imagined) with QuickBBS do not excuse your
attitude in this echo.  You could have said everything you did without
resorting to gutter eloquence... there is enough of that in some of the other
echos, although I have to admit that your message was one of the worst I have
ever seen in a National echo.  I really think this is one of the more
informative echos and one of the only two that I follow on a daily basis any
more.  I would really hate to see it deteriorate into a useless FLAME
forum... like so many others I used to read.

hmmm...  very strange.  Seems like Shedit will not exit if a user hangs up
while in the editor...  I have to reboot the BBS.  Am I overlooking a
command-line parm??  Has anyone else noticed this??

Subj: Re: MENUS

think it is a good suggestion too. So if you are open, what do you think of a
file called guest.ctl? Were the sysop may define guest users.. It can be set
up like this.

Name            Security Level     Password    D/L Limit
---------------------------------------------------------
Guest User      10                 Guessy      400
QuickBBS User   5                  Adam        200
---------------------------------------------------------

SysOp wants no guests, Just don't have the file.. What do you think?

Why not just start using the function keys?

You can also shorten Ansi screens with Edlin... You just have to know what
codes to take out. Its real easy with ASCII just delete all the blank lines..
