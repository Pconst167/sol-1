Maybe it's like the 2-1?  (my 3-1 manual seems to have vanished)  The 2-1 was:

 1 - n/c
 2 - TXD
 3 - RXD
 4 - *RTS
 5 - *CTS
 6 - *DSR
 7 - GND
 8 - *DCD
 9 - RI
 10- *DTR
 11-16 - n/c

OK, Kevin, but I already have that pinout (which is, I'm sure, the same, they
wouldn't want to supply 3 or 4 different cables), but what I need to know is
the PHYSICAL layout of the pins; ie. which is pin 1 and in what order are they
numbered? Oh, now that I look at it, your numbering doesn't match since this is
a 10 pin header, not a 25 pin or 16 pin or whatever. So, since I've been
calling Tony for a few days now with no answer, I guess I'll just have to wait
until someone who knows the actual layout of the 10 pin header can let me know.
Unless I get really ambitious and look up the level converter chip and the 6551
in the data sheets at work and trace the wiring, sigh.

Thanks, Kev.

I don't know what the answer is to that question, Bob. I've been looking for
similar techniques of creating window overalys on virtually any terminal and
have been experimenting with Curses. I've tried using NCurses from the TOPS
disks, but it appears to be imcomplete as far the Unix standard Curses. Ed at
Delmar sent me another version of Curses last week but I haven't had time to
monkey around with it yet. As a matter of fact, I hadn't even tarred and
feathered it yet... I guess that should be untarred and defeathered (tar and
compress).

If you find the information on Termcap windows, I'd really like to hear about
it. I'm working on an OSk application now that really needs decent window
overlaying capabilities -- whether it be Termcap or Termcap plus Curses. I have
the front-end working quite well on a PC using PCCurses and hoping to find
and/or fix a decent version of Curses for OSk to really dig into development.

Greg,
 For your information, I uploaded a port of Pavel Curtis' Curses into
DL12 some time ago.  This is terminfo based (included ) and as nearly as
I can tell compatible with SYS V.  Should be _much_ better than old
Curses.

Very well. BTW, error #205 is a whole different story. That usually means the
header is garbage, and not just INCORRECT. Have you tried looking at DUMPs of
the offending file/modules to see what they head in there? Look for telltale
signs like 8th bit stripping, etc.

I still have all those files on disk.  I'll see what I can do with that
technique.  If I do spot the problem, what will it take to fix it?  I cannot
use DED since it is ar'ed and I can't get unar files because I don't have sterm
(yet) because I can't make the modules work (so far).... Once I do get Sterm, I
can, of course, go get AR09.BIN, DED, and whatever else, so I want to see if I
can do something in the interim.  And if I can do something now, it would be a
good experience to tackle it (just like when I used DSKI$ and DSKO$ on a DECB
disk to get a better idea of how the file allocation table is put together).

Right for now, let's concentrate on seeing what's there. We may be able to
diagnose the problem looking at the file. Fixing it is a separate stage. ;^}.

I looked at a DUMP of the file.  I didn't know what I should see, but I did at
least see   sterm  at the top, so I know something is probably OK. Going back
to the orig. question of this thread, I tried my DECB POKEs under Basic09. 
They worked.  So I created a short procedure and PACKed it with redirection to
the cmds directory.  I ran ident on it and found how short that thing is: 
Module size 63.  I did it without parameters being passed to the procedure.  It
just looks at the memory address and POKEs the opposite value.  The entire
operation took less than 10 minutes.  Maybe I'll upload the source code anyway.

One caution messing with the cassette port/PIA's: make sure you only mess with
the BIT(s) you're conncerned with. A lot of other stuff is also controlled at
the PIA level.

 A VERY good response, but if I remember correctly, xcom9 has to have the ASCII
filter turned OFF for a successful XModem transfer?

BTW, I checked the DLs, and could not locate X102.ar, or any other files with a
keyword of x10, or a filename starting with "X", which included the source for
you X10 package... any idea who might have a copy of the source?

Great:  via these threads I am finally starting to get OS-9LII to work for me
rather than the other way around.  I may be getting a PC drive to add to this
system as early as Tuesday.  How do I get the drive connected inside the case
(horizontal FD-502 system)?  I want to be sure I get it right.  This is not in
my immediate plans, but can I support a third floppy drive?  I think it would
be useful for me, but I am giving higher priorities to more RAM, a faster
modem, more programs, and a few other items.

Pete Lydall?  Would he have modified that file?  Someone told me about a year
ago that there was such a file here on CIS.  Now that I have joined CIS I can't
find it.  If only the information was made available that describes the
workings of that file so you could make your own custom version depending on
what type of terminal you have.

Thanks!

Fm: Bob Archambault 76506,3544
To: Kevin Darling 76703,4227

I am trying to use TSMON (along w/ LOGIN & password of course) from a Level One
disk on a Level Two system, since I don't have the Dev Pack. It is working,
with the exception of a couple of problems.

1. It logs ALL users, regardless of the ID #, as user 0 (superuser).

2. I can't echo a message from my computer to the terminal, for example:
echo>/t2 Hi Dave, how are you    -  it will lock me up until I press <BREAK> 3
times, then it echoes the message!

3. At the User Name: prompt (on the terminal) it displays as:
        User Name:.     -- a period right after the colon, forcing the user to
delete the period before typing his user name, else the system rejects him.

Now is all this due to something I've done wrong, or is it an incompatibility
between Levels One and Two, and if that's the case, can I patch the TSMON &
LOGIN files to work correctly. I've tried a couple of the TSMONs on lib 8 here,
but they don't work at ALL.

Any help would (once again) be GREATLY appreciated!

Thanx in advance,

      Bob

Hey y'all ... I found my original article on the GrfDrv patches ... this
includes why we cannot have a 225-line graphics mode (we *can* have a 28-line
text mode), but it carefully describes how Level-2 can be modified to support a
225-line graphics mode.  Primarily for the "new level-2" dudes if we can get
y'all to read it before it's too late.  It also describes the bugs in the
ACVC/GIME chip, including the newest chip I've been able to order.

Now this file completes everything I've been uploading and have been wanting to
get responses on ... I'm still waiting for any kind of specific responses on
all of my articles!  I've not gotten any help on Delphi, either, and/but I was
expecting CIS to have the smart dudes here!  These "questions" I have are way
too big for the forums, and that's why I bothered to type them into "articles".

A few of these articles are already several months old.  I'm suspecting there's
just not any interested anywhere.  Or it could be that several months are not
long enough to digest them.  Or y'all don't know the articles are here (been
missing/skipping my "To: All" messages here!).

Or perhaps the CoCo REALLY IS DEAD AND BURIED.

My check for renewing my OS9UG membership got sent back, saying they're being
restructured.

I.e. CIS is my last hope for input on the projects I'm trying to get going.
