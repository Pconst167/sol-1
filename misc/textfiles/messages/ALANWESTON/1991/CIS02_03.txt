Steve;

  I got a chance to play around with the pgm. a bit today, and got it to print
in a tabular fashion without using pos_cur.  I eliminated the CURSOR calls in
the print_event function, but haven't had a chance to remove them from the
add_event function yet.

  Just uploaded the source to DL10, marked for you.  Let me know if this solves
your "garbaged-up" output on the WYSE.

Jim,

Had a few minutes to test out the new source. Your changes did eliminate the
cursor control characters I was seeing ... as well as your change to the path
for dates.files again allows multiple users their own dates.file.

However ... I'm now seeing a '1st' in the type of event field, if there's
nothing normally there. For instance, a run of dateck brings up Ash Wednesday.
There's nothing special suposed to be in the type of event field, yet I see a
'1st'.
 I'm also seeing something wierd with todays date ... the year seems to be
munged.

Popping the source into my handy editor and searching for '1st', I get one hit.
A comment line in some code testing for the 1st. Nowhere else. Can't for the
life of me see how that's getting printed, tho.

Thoughts?

  Glad to hear that we can do away with the pos_cur(x,y) stuff... now all I

  The 1st that you're seeing is due to the fact that I changed the logic a bit
to not display a year span for annually recurring events like Christmas, etc.
By setting the year field for such dates to 00, no year span gets printed.
  However... for events such as Ash Wednesday, Easter, Thanksgiving, etc. that
do not fall on the same date each year, it's necessary to manually edit the
dates.file to re-set these dates to the current day/year.
  At some point, I'd like ts incorporate a way to dynamically calculate these
dates, but I don't remember how most of them are calculated.  Labor Day I
know, but not the rest of them!  Anyone???

Pete, Yes, I had a look at the termcap stuff you uploaded. Not too much help
for my problem. Looking over some of the termcap entries in the OSK termcap
file I notice that there are a number of entries for different terminals which
are not covered in the termcap capabilities list in the OSK docs. Does anyone
know of a more comprehensive list?

Actually, adding your own functions in not a problem. I could easily add to the
file entries for anything I want. I suppose for cursor on/off I could use C1
and C2 or whatever. The thing I'd like to know is if there is already a name
for this function or, if not, any suggestions for a standard name.

Yes, the 4-in-1 does require the add-on power supply for the Hard Drive
interface.  That one stumped a friend and I first time we tried to set up his
drive -- the manual mentioned the power supply only under the Serial Port, but
it is required for the HD as well. (not the clock, tho.)

Also, I am in the process of releasing a new version of the CCHDisk driver (v
4.7) which will let you do the physical format under OS-9, rather than using
that Basic program.  Also has a few other tweeks specifically for Seagate
STxxxN drives (though it is not limited to Seagates).  Should be available in a
few days. (Gotta reformat the doc file.)

Kevin:

So what your saying is it should be possable to work up an EPROM that would
just boot off the HD. Now what kind of a job would that be for someone like me?
I can plug things in, solder in diodes, and patch modules, but I,m not really
up on figuring out what to patch, and what to to change things to.

Am I correct in thinking that the EPROM would have to know where on the HD to
find the kernel (track), and then a new BOOT mod would have to be written in
say assembly. Of course the code in the EPROM would have to be machine code to
start things off, right?

I just noticed something, looking through a couple of folders I have of boot
modules, that REL BOOT and OS9P1 are not in there. Interesting. When we do an
OS9gen, these must be pulled out ot memory, right? Am I getting in over my head
here? By the way, when I get this figured out is there somewhere a guy can get
EPROMs burned for a resonable fee? Also I'm not a programmer, so any books you
might think would help me on my way on assembly would be most appreciated. I
have Bill Barden's book for EDCB, would this do me some good to go through?

The bootfile is located via a LSN pointer in LNS0 on the hard disk. The boot
need only look there, and then seek to the designated spot, and read the
bootfile.

In coco land, os9p1, REL, Boot, and Init (?) are on track 34 of the boot
floppy, and are loaded by the DOS command (reads 18 sectors from track 34 into
memory). Once loaded, they jump into it, and it takes over by enabling the
appropriate RAM mode, copying the modules to high RAM, and then jumping into
os9. That's the 1st level boot. Then os9's Boot module takes over (via OS9p1)
and loads the OS9Boot file.

So really, all the EPROM would have to do is know where to find the first part
of the Boot. Then OS-9 will just read the rest of it off the disk?

Lute -

A standard (well, COCO) bootstrap is really three separate stages of
bootstrapping:

1 - The DOS command reads track 34 into memory, and executes the
    REL code manually. The REL code takes the rest of track 34
    (which contains os9p1, boot, and init) and relocates it
    to upper memory. Then it jumps into OS9 (or OS9p1).

2 - OS9 calls f$boot, which eventually locates and starts the
    BOOT module. The BOOT module goes to the floppy (hard coded)
    and looks at LSN0. It gets the location of the OS9Boot file
    (or whatever it's called - name is unimportant) in terms
    of absolute sector number (LSN), and the size of the boot file
    from the LSN0 info. It seeks the disk to that point, and
    reads exactly that many bytes (modulo 256). It then passes
    control back to os9.

3 - OS9 then finishes initialization, and starts Sysgo/CC3Go. Sysgo/CC3go
    gets parameters from Init (working and exec dirs, standard I/O
    defaults, etc.) and sets them up. It then forks a shell
    to perform the startup script, and upon completion of that,
    forks another shell, which is the first user shell, and the
    initial OS9: prompt that you see.

I did, I varied the foreground and background from 0 to 7 and all the
combination possible. It have not effect. Montype would change the display on a
monochrome. But not to a point that I can read it.

The only way I can change them at this point is to change the palette setting
with control in MV. Then the changes would carry through to the window setup in
aif. But doing it this way would render the MV window unreadable.

Hope there is some other way or I will have to go back to the old fashioned way
of startup a pro program.

I started up MV from startup file to /w3. The env.file palette was on the
previous message I posted. The palette was change await back to a more pleasing
set then the standard set from the Tandy Disk.

I found one thing the hard way. The aif file change have not affect on the
window if you have start the application before during the same session. You
must reboot to see the foreground and background changes.

After playing around a little more with the MV and some applications. I have
came up with some workable solutions. Having a color monitor to turn to to
identify the actual color help.

With a monochrome monitor(The one i got was used a video monitor and the grey
level is not as as stable as a computer monochrome monitor). You can set the MV
palette as follows.

Palet0=0,0,0 palet1=3,3,3 Palet2=2,0,0 Palet3=2,2,0

You can set the dynacalc aif file as follows:

2,80,24,0,4

This will show up as a red on black screen on a color monitor and a very
readable white on black on a monochrome. The Dynacalc used is the Ver 1.00.00
from tandy copyright 1984

The Dynastar aif can be set up as:

2,80,24,2,0

This will also yield a fairly readable screen. There is still a minor problem.
The cursor is not visible and the command prompts are not visible. This is the
ver. 3.4 for coco III lvl II.

Hope this is of some help and maybe there is fix for the problems I got.

Right, the MV startup uses the env.file to set the global default colors, so
any programs started beforehand would use the stock global defaults instead.

The env.file seems to affect only one window. Another type 2 window started up

   One thing I have not seen metioned yet is that DynaStar v3.4 knows about
CoCo windows. It keeps it's own record of palette slots to use in it's termset

Thats right, but the MV env.file mess up the default palette slot to an point
that DS V3.4 will not be visible. I have my Termset use white on black type 2
windows in all the windows. It works fine if I start up DS from a stock type 2
windows with default color palettes. If the application before that switches/or
changes te the palettes. Then DS will use the altered palette. Mv is teh one
that alters it. What I want is for the aif to tell the DS window the altered
palette slots. It seems to me we need to have some way of letting the aif reset
the palette slot back to the default before DS starts. (The MV gshell may start
in a different window every time. I don't want to mess around with the
termset.)

All you have to do is put WindInt in your boot file and GShell in your CMDS
directory. It also helps to have env.file in the SYS directory and add the
additional window descriptors (w8-w15) to your boot file also. And if you want
to be able to fork the standard Tandy apps, you'll need to copy those to your
CMDS directory alsot(.

Hmmm, using a subroutine module for ved_size is probably a good idea--but I
have no idea how to do that. Guess the module would have to be written in
assembler and then what? We get the address of the module via modlink and then
jump to the entry point? Return stuff in registers.

The control code thingie is okay. Yes, I have the single board proto. I figured
out the screen stuff from the termcap file--not much there is there? Unless I'm
missing things, it lacks all the goodies like underline and reverse video. Just
as well, it forced me to set ved up so that it can deal with stupid terminals.
And when I get the updated software it'll just be a matter of updating the
termcap entry. Oh, and I do hope that the final version of the window driver
will have entries of an extended character set ($20..$FF).

That does bring up a good point. Are there OSK C functions for setting up
subroutine modules? Are there any out there for OS9 LII? Calling of subroutine
modules can be hacked together, but there is no standard that I'm aware of for
setting up C subroutine modules, and I have also never heard of a cstart.r for
subroutine modules. This might require linker changes too, ugh.

I have an ulterior motive here, since I'm working on a large C project that
_might_ benefit from subroutines. Thoughts everyone?

About a week or so ago, you asked about making the arrow keys work under
DynaStar, after applying the GShell+ patches.

The utility (patch file) you are after is called KeyTable, and is contained in
DSPAT.AR in DL10.  This is the latest version of the file, and should be
compatible with your upgraded version of CC3IO.  I have tried it with most
CC3IO upgrades successfully, including the latest version released by Bruce
Isted in ESW110.AR (Eliminator S/W version 1.10).  Exception: I haven't got a
serial mouse working, so have only tried the ".joy" versions from Bruce's file.

Good luck... let me know if you have any problems.

Cheers... / ken

DMAPPS is not an executable module (does not start with 87CD), therefore it
should get a module header is incorrect error.  DMALT is executable and should
be

Lee,
  I figured out my problem. I had customized my Deskmate3 disk, I have it all
on one double sided disk and stepping at 6 milliseconds, but when I configured
it, I must have left out the /M1 and /M2 descriptors because at that time, I
didn't have a modem,(I waited till the shack reduced them to $9.95) but anyway
all I had to do was copy the /M1 to my Deskmate3 and now everything is A-OK.
Thanks for the help.
 I do have another problem though, I can't figure how to handle any of the
programs I have downloaded (binary or arc). I tried changing attributes,
loading to memory and Basic09, I wonder what I'm doing wrong?

As for the binary stuff, it needs to have any x/y-modem pad characters removed,
then you can set the execution attributes on with ATTR.  DED can be used to
help truncate the downloaded binary file.  DED is another utility that you can
find in the libraries here.  Then you just put the module in the current
execution directory.
   As previously stated, you have to use the AR utility to deARchive files that
are suffixed with ".AR".

   On the binary files, if they are packed BASIC09, you'll still have to adhere
to the same rules that detail where RUNB and other support modules have to be.

The simplest way to strip X/Ymodem padding is:

  1. Set execute permissions on (attr filename e pe)
  2. Load the module (with padding attached)
  3. Ignore any error messages
  4. Delete the disk image of the module
  5. SAVE the module from memory to disk.

After step 5, the padding will be gone, as the module header size field
determines how much is written to disk (actually, how much is loaded as well.
When loading, os9 will see the anticipated end of the module, note that it's
not at EOF, and look for a subsequent module in the file (SYNC BYTES). If not
there, it should bark about an illegal module header, or the like).

Scott,
  The file(s) you are looking for are in LIB 9.
  All the files will pop up if you type the command: BRO AR*.*
  whilst in LIB9.

  AR.DOC is the documentation file. Read the descriptions, and you'll see that
there are separate .BIN (executable files) for both 6809 & 680x0 machines.
AR.AR contains the full boat and source code as well.
  If you do download one of the .BIN files, you may want to RENAME it and take
the .BIN extension off (ie....RENAME /d?/AR09.BIN /d?/AR), and you WILL need to
set the atributes adding the "pe" and "e" attributes. The command which will do
the job is ATTR /d?/AR -PE -E
   Hope that helps.

with the LOGIN and TSMON commands/modules. Nothing was mentioned about them in
my documentation and, after looking through the disks, I find they don't appear
on either of them. Did I purchase the RS 2.0 UPGRADE only? In order to have
password security on my /t1, etc. do I need to get the 01.00.00/01.00.01
version also? I am perfectly able to get a shell running on /t1.... What am/did

Login and Tsmon were not included in the Level II release of OS9. Instead, they
were bundled on the Developer's Pak.

Not to worry .... there are several replacements in the LIBRARIES. Do a Browse
on LOGIN and see what pops up. LIB 8 should be the place to look.

Give a shout if you need more info.

A 232pak or equal is almost a requirement for modeming with OS9. But ... if you
have a RSDOS terminal package that supports xmodem or B protocol, you can use
one of the converting utilities to move the file from RSDOS to OS9.

DOSOR9 comes immediately to mind. Give a yell if you need more info. In the

That means that the file obviously doesn't contain an executable (or any other

Questions:

Did you download it as an '.ar' file? If yes, have you already used 'ar' to
unpack it? Is it any other form of packed file (uuencode? Pak? Arc? Zip?)?

Where did you get the file, and what is it's name? If you can't figure any of
the above out, that may help, along with a dump of the first couple sectors of
the file..

In order to get AR'd programs unpacked, you need to download ar.bin in DL9.
After downloading it (it is NOT compressed or packed) put it in your commands
directory, rename it to 'ar', and set execution priveleges (attr /dd/cmds/ar e
pe).

If you don't have DUMP, grab XOD.ar in dl9. A really nice public domain dump
command. There's also a PD save command over there, I believe.

Ar.arc? Odd - I would have expected it to be ar.ar. If the latter were the
case, you could unpack it using ar by:

   ar -x ar

Fm: Steve Adams 71610,3707

    Howdy! Since I use OSK subroutine modules a lot, I thought I would

throw in my two cents worth.  I cannot speak for OS9 LII since I never

really used it in depth.  Forgive me if I cover old ground.



    First the advantages:



    Advantage #1) Subroutine modules are an excellent way to expand

the functionality of a program at run-time.  If the interface to the

subroutine module is properly defined, programs can use them to add

new features dynamically.  (slight bragging follows) I wrote an object

oriented graphics editor for designing user interfaces that can be

expanded by the user to include new I/O objects.  The new objects can

be edited as if they were hardcoded into the editor, including

rubber-banding, without making any changes to the graphics editor.



    Advantage #2) An unlimited number of subroutine modules may be

used by a program at once.  If trap modules are used, only 15

different modules may be used at once.



    Advantage #3) As with any properly written OSK module, they may be

shared by several processes to reduce memory usage.





    Now the disadvantages:



    Disadvantage #1) This is probably the most frustating.  No static

variable space may be used within the subroutine module.  This limits

you to using stack variables, and 'malloc()'ed variable space.  Some C

variables declared in cstart are accessable from a subroutine module.



    Disadvantage #2) Because no global variable space is allowed, jump

tables are not allowed.  This effectively limits the size of

subroutine modules to 32K.  If you are REAL careful with your coding

and avoid distant 'bsr's, this size limit can be expanded.



    Disadvantage #3) There is no standard interface to subroutine

modules that I know of.  This makes its harder to get started

initially.  This can also be viewed as an advantage once you know what

you are doing, since it allows your interface to the module to exactly

match your applications needs.

        (continued from previous message)



    Here are some (I hope) helpful hints for using C with subroutine

modules.



    Use the -i and -x command line options with 'cc' when

compiling subroutine modules.  This will cause the cio and math trap

handlers to be used, and reduce the size of the subroutine module by

about 10K depending on the functions called.



    To reference C variables declared in cstart.r, include the

following code segment in the assembly language header to the

subroutine module:



* Resolve the references generated from Cstart.   Originate from -$8000

    org    -32768

_sttop      do.l    1    stack top

_mtop:      do.l    1    current non-stack memory top

_stbot:     do.l    1    current stack bottom limit

errno:      do.l    1    global error holder

_totmem:    do.l    1    total data memory used

_sbsize:    do.l    1    top of process memory (sbrk)





    I hope this stuff is useful.

Steve, that information is helpful, since I don't have an OSK machine yet, I
haven't gone to far in learning how things like subroutines may work
differently than with OS9 LII. I was hoping that subroutine handling functions
were available for OSK, mainly because I just didn't want to have to do some of
the things you described, like hard coding cstart.r variables, using assembler
code, etc. And I agree, the major disadvantage of subroutines is the inability
to access static variables. I'm not too familiar with jump tables tables, looks
like its time to dig into the manuals again! Thanks for the info..

Floyd, I've got your games: gemquest, spacezap, tank, dungeon. Wwould like to
register them shortly, they are are with excellant graphics. I am however
running into a few error messages and problems though. Dungeon, OS9  runs quite
well but does it end? I get to the point of where the man is surrounded by
one-way tunnels, and I can't find the way out.

Spacezap  when I downloaded this one it didn't have a graphics window maker so
I used the one that came with tank but the fonts do not come on the screen just
a row of dots instead of letters.  I can run tank first then I can have the
fonts come up but then I constantly get error 194 right after the game comes
up, Zap #30k doesn't do me any good ethier, same error code.

Tank, when I'm on a high level seems to error out on me, missed the code number
there.

Gemquest, on level 4 when I'm there I'll always end up with error #55

Could be bad downloads from other boards But I would appreciate your help here,
and keep on the good work! Wayne Laird

Good questions.  For The Dungeon Depths, there are 15 levels.  Some of the
levels are very tough as you discovered.  I'm not sure what the problem with
the fonts on SpaceZap is.  In Tank a couple of the levels included with the
game were bad.  You can find the corrected levels on here (LIB 10).  If you
download my patch file (can't remember the name of it right now) from LIB 10,
it will {ix the error in GemQuest plus some bugs in some of my other games.

Paul,
  Are you sure it isn't the other way around (a program that runs under OS9
that lets you read/write PC diskettes)?
  The program that runs under OS9 is called PCDOS.AR and is in LIB 10.

There was a program called "CoCoUtil" (and later CoCoUtil II) that ran on
MS-DOS machines, but it would only read RS-DOG disks.  It was commercial.

I have corrected the error in my documentation of Carl Kreider's C library.
These docs are available to anyone who wants them.  I will not be uploading
them here because of the size, but will send a disk will all docs, the
man command for reading them, and the updated mroff for making the man
pages--including source code.

If anyone would like a disk, please send a disk mailer and a blank disk
with enough return postage to cover the charges to:

    Mark Griffith
    953 W. Wisconsin Ave.

If there is enough call, I can upload the archives here after splitting
them up to keep the size down.  Reply to this message and Steve Wegert
will forward then to me.

I appreciate all the comments many people have made in getting the errors
out of the doc files.  Thanks to all.

You can still buy MIDI packs from RUlaford Research in Oregon. They may have

in Rochester NY,{whose stuff was recently reviewed in Rainbow.  Their MIDI Pak
may or may not be compatible. I think RUlaford wants about $80 or $90 for their
Pak. Some folks have hacked RS232 Paks into MIDI, but it's not for the faint of

Hi Glen, congrats on your D-50.  I'm glad to hear those are still being sold --
seems every model is "obsolete" after 6 months. Yes, I'd heard the D-50 is much

Hi Mike... The only reason I could afford to buy the D-50 is because Roland is
dumping them to make way for the D-70. I find that in many ways I like my MT-32
better, but the D-50 is a VERY capable machine too. It works best as a
controller, as it is somewhat lacking in multi-timbral abilities. About the
editor - it is coming along VERY slowly Don't hold your breath... I will upload
on Delphi - I spend most of my time there because of the 20/20 thing. Bye...

UltiMusE-III also beats the 64K limit by mapping various object-code routines
into an 8K segment kept open for that use. Uses C-coded machine code, and
WizPro uses packed B09 RUNB modules, but basically same idea.

Umuse also fights the 64K limit by forking off the whole grafix end of the
beast and PIPElining to it.

Congrats,

Finally saw that Kyum-Gai (OS-9 L2 version) is at last seeing the light of day.
And I hope it's a bright new day, too.  I think it will be if we, the OS-9
