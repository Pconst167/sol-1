yes, I meant that what I saw typed via echo was all in lower case!
But when I logged off and back on, re-checking the posted message showed that
some caps were correct (those at the beginning of a sentence) others were still
in lower case (those in the middle of a sentence).  But even the CIS log-on
lines were in lower case!

Where sterm seemed to hang up is where CIS goes to check on your mailbox for
new mail.  Sterm never got past that point.  Mebbe there's an incompatibility
with Sterm's 8N1 parameter requirement.  -ph-

The only thing to change is the terminal program: I usually use UTRM40, DM3, or
CIM (via 1000TL/2).  Sterm is new to me and I tried it just for the experience

Success!  It seems that previous attempts were done when power line glitches
were occurring (house wiring - complete with intermittant circuit breakers;
lights would flicker in other parts of the house).

I even downloaded a file using B send ahead protocol. It took 99 sec. to dl a
17733byte file (2 errors); net baud rate 1423.

Two questions arise:  during library browsing, text transfers, etc.,   some
lines are repeated, and some menus get scrambled on screen.
Sometimes ctrl-c must be used to stop repeat scrolling.  What causes this
(note- power line problem isn't yet resolved fully, but doesn't
seem to be a factor at this moment)
  Lastly- can't get sterm to even boot using MV, only OS9.  MV gives a >can't
open /t2<  error.  Any special changes to env.file?  I've never run a comm
program in MV.  -ph-

Paul,

Last things first ....

Sterm can run from Multiview ... used to do it all the time. Make sure the
env.file lists /t2 as a valid device in the SCFDEV line. (I'm assuming that /t2
and ACIAPAK is already in your bootfile.)

Back to the sterm issues. It sure sounds like a combination of buffer over-run
and missing interupts. Have you installed thhe IRQ hak?

Have you installed the patch to ACIAPAK to increase the buffer size and have
you installed the patches to MV to speed things up ... greatly.

These are all required modifications for happy computing with the CoCo 3.

(You can confirm the buffer over run problems by stepping down to 300 baud. If
you don't notice the repeating text, then that's it!)

Steve

PS ... I'll nab the file names of the above mentioned patches ad pass then
along.

Then run in order:

It's a bit more complicated than just adding a descriptor to pick up another
serial port, Everett.

If you already have /t2 installed and are using a stock addressed rs232 pak,
plugging in another stock 233pak won't work. It's hardware address will need to
be modified so as not to be in conflict with the other.

If you get hold of one of the paks from Ken-ton, it's addresses will be set up
so they don't confilct.

os9p3 is available for download here.  Just go to LIBrary 9/Utilities.  The
file is os9p3.ar which means you will need to extract it with ar.bin which you
can also download.  The size of os9p3 is less than 10K.  It will take you about
45 seconds to download it at 2400 baud, or about 8.5 minutes if you use 300
baud.  Be sure to carefully follow instructions for installing it in your
system or you will not be able to boot os9.  One more thing: I presume you have
Level 2 which is required.

The way I have come to prefer is to use the program EZGen.  You cannot download
it; you must buy it.  EZGen, however, is not good for those who are not already
familiar with boot files and the like.  If you have two disk drives, follow the
directions in your OS-9 manual for the command os9gen.  Using os9gen on a
single drive is possible but rather difficult. To build your new bootlist, you
must first find out what is already in your os9boot.  You can do this with
Modbuster or Bootsplit both of which can be downloaded.  You can also use ident
-s os9boot.  The order in which modules appear in your boot list ranges from
important to absolutely vital, and you have no easy way to know just how
critical it is on your CoCo3.  In some cases, you even have to get certain
modules into one block of memory. So follow direcctions for where to insert
os9p3 and build your bootlist accordingly.  For the future, you might find
EZGen a good program to have. So if you want to get it now anyway, I'll help
you do it right.  Tip No. 1: Make at least one backup of your present boot disk
so you can always wipe the slate clean.  I've been quite successful with EZGen,
but I have had to restore my system disk from the backup before.  Don't learn
the hard way.

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

I'd like to use an intercept to check for the user hitting the keyboard abort
key. When the key is hit my program should go and delete a bunch of temporary
files and do some other cleanup chores, then it should terminate.

The example on page 82 of the Microware C manual shows an example of this. The
interecpt routine sets a global flag which the main loop of the program
monitors. This is not workable, since I don't have a main loop which is checked
on a continuous basis--control could be in any of several areas, so checking a
flag is out. On the other hand, I can't do I/O, etc. until after I leave the
intercept . . . and simply branching to another routine IS NOT leaving the
intercept. So, what I need is a method to tell OS9 than it's okay to leave
system mode, then I'll call my cleanup routines and exit. Anyone know how I
tell this lie to the system?

BTW, I guess the same problem occurs using longjmp() if you want to restart the
program after a signal.

The fact that OS9 leaves you in system mode after a signal interecpt is a real
pain if you are writing an application. Too bad there isn't some kind of flag
which could be set when the intercept is set up to signal system or user mode.

Bob,
  Microware does not recommend doing I/O while in the intercept routine as
signals to that process are enqueued while in the intercept. You could lose
signals. Use of I/O in an intercept is therefore an application decision.

 #include <signal.h>
 intercept(sig)
 {
    switch (sig)
    {
        case SIGINT:
        case SIGQUIT: cleanup();

Dear Kevin:


I am working on a project and I need to show the x/y co-ordinates of the mouse
on the screen. The only code I could find in the Tandy OS-9 manual was for the
low or medium resolution joystick.

I used the sample from your Syscall Tutorial

PROCEDURE SS_Mouse

TYPE stack=CC,A,B,DP:BYTE; X,Y,U:INTEGER

DIM reg:stack


BASE 0

DIM I_GetStt,SS_Mouse,mouse(32):BYTE


I_GetStt=$8D

SS_Mouse=$89


LOOP

reg.A=0

reg.Y=0

reg.X=ADDR(mouse)


RUN Syscall(I_GetStt,reg)


PRINT "Mouse X = "; mouse(28)*256+mouse(29); " ";

PRINT "Mouse Y = "; mouse(30)*256+mouse(31)


EXITIF mouse(8)<>0 THEN

PRINT "Left button Hit"

ENDEXIT

ENDLOOP



I get the following:

PRINT "Mouse X = 31091 Mouse Y = 25441 Left button Hit

What I would like to be able to do is get numbers like x=(between 0 to 639)
y=(between 0 to 191)

Plus the numbers didn't change when I moved the mouse. What am I doing wrong?

Confusedly yours, Br. Jeremy,  CSJW

Also, this assumes autoselect of mouse; that is, that you've run one of
