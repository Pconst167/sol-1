Funny you shold ask. the A.R.R.L (Ham Radio) Convention hit my home town and I
picked up a 1.2 Meg 5-1/4 (TEAC) drive fairly cheap.  The drive descriptor that
I finally got to work (after many tries) looks just like the d0 and d1 supplied
for the 3-1/2 inch disks, except for sct and tos, which are both hex 1c (28
sectors per track). That gives me 1.14 megs.

I also played with a "standard" 360k 5-1/4 drive, but never could get it to
work.   I have also failed miserably in attempts to get the 1.2m drive to read
a 360k disk - not sure it can be done.

I found that 28-sector figure for the 1.2 meg disk by experiment - started with
16 sectors and it worked - 30 bombed, 26 worked, 29 bombed, 28 seems to be the
max.

If you haven't checked out the moded command yet, try it - I used it to make a
d2 descriptor out of d1.  I load and iniz it from my startup file (couldn't do
that with level II).

Good Luck John Wainwright

Yes, I have a 5.25 floppy on my MM1.  And, it works correctly.  And, I recall
that it was a major pain in the rear end to figure out the one cable
combination that would make it work right.  If you have one of those 'twisty'
cables, then I suggest doing:

 1) replace it with a 'straight' cable (use drive select 0 and 1)

 2) PC drives (who use the twisted cables) use only DS 1 and 2.
    Because they skip #0, try re-assigning your drives for 1 and 2.
    Then play with which connector works on which drive...

If you still can't get it to work, give me a buzz @ 317-668-8878.

It sounds like you know alot about copyrights so I ask a few questions. Is a
"copyleft" legally binding?  Was there any court cases where GNU went after
people violating this so called "copyleft"?  Does the international community
recognize the term "copyleft"?  Is there a book on how to copyleft software?

I got the book "How to Copyright Software" by M. J. Salone, and it said nothing
about copyleft.  I personally suspect GNU is trying to intimidate people from
protecting their intellectual property.  The book says nothing about
incorporating routines from a library (I am most worried when it is public
domain, i.e. "CLIBT.L").  Instead it makes the claim that the copyright office
doesn't make a distinction between compiled program and source code. (medium
independence?)

I just want to display my copyright to remind people not to exploit my work for
commercial purposes. (BTW I am unemployed)

To the best of my knowledge, "copyleft" has yet to be tested legally. It is an
attempt to further Richard Stallman's notions of intellectual property (he
thinks there's no such thing), and is typically accompanied with derogatory
labels applied to those who disagree (e.g. "software hoarders").

I'm not a lawyer, though, nor do I play one on TV. :-)  If you really want good

Naw, from the poking over the machine and schematics that I have (mind you,
things may have changed - though I doubt they would have this), the MIDI-able
port is <HARDWARE> selectable for either normal serial or MIDI clock rate. The
MIDI crystal isn't on the paddle board, as they just stole the midi clock rate
needed from some other circuitry (don't have the schematic's here or I'd
refresh my memory) and bring both clocks to a jumper select on the main board.
Maybe your 'quickie hack' system is earlier than mine (late last year)??

Although, I see no reason why someone couldn't bring their own clock into the
select jumper...

No Sir!  I hadn't been aware of the problem you mentioned.  What print dump are
you using and for what printer?  I've used the Epson, IBM, DMP105 and CGP-220
drivers here and had no problems.

Does the problem go away if you print with Squashing off, (From the menu), or
if you print Squashed pictures from disk?

Mike,

I use the Epson driver, even on my Citizen Printer.  The other printer that I
use is a 'real' Epson FX-1050.  The problem of squashing/unsquashing seems to
be unrelated to the print problem.  (One of my previous messages appears to
have gotten squashed itself, making it look like I was saying that the two
problems were connected.  As aar as I can tell, they're not.)
   And I haven't noticed any differences in the printing problem between
printing from the MVCanvas menu or directly from a command line using PRTDMP.

   Here's a more detailed explanation of what appears to be happening.

   The squashing/unsquashing problem seems to have a tendency to clobber RAM. 
If I deal only with unsquashed .VEF files then I don't have any problems with
RAM being stepped on.  However, if I deal with squashed .VEF files, then I
generally get my RAM stepped on.  The system doesn't completely crash, usually
I can still switch from window to window using the <CLEAR> key.  If I try to do
anything on the GSHELL+ screen, like refresh the screen by clicking on the
directory bar, I find that some of the font area has been clobbered as well as
the location in RAM where the icons and mouse pointers are stored.  That in
itself is pretty weird, because if the mouse pointers have been clobbered, then
I shouldn't be able to see it on the GSHELL+ screen in order to place it on the
Directory bar in order to refresh the screen display.  Makes me wonder if just
some address pointers are getting corrupted somehow.  When I load a squashed
VEF file the mouse pointers on the MVCanvas dosappear, too.
   Things go down hill from there.  When GSHELL+ redisplays the directory, the
icons are gone, the file names still display but the icons don't appear on the
screen anymore.

---------------

The printing problem appears to happen when there's a lot of dithering on the
screen.  If I use colors other than black and white, the MVC PRTDMP program
tries to simulate those colors by dithering the output.  That forced dithering
seems to cause the printer to jump about skewing lines, sometimes even dropping
out of graphics mode and printing double wide,

special fonts, or even narrow characters.
   As I recall, the dithering that occurs somewhat naturally even with just
black and white will throw the printer into a tail spin.  I'll have to check
that again to make sure, though.

----------------

One other quick questions.  Please review the steps that I must follow in order
to use one of the fill patterns.

-----------------

   I can send you copies of printouts that are badly scrambled.  And I can send
you copies of the same picture that printed okay when I changed the colors to
black and white only.

Thanks,

Lee


P.S.

And now for something completely different...

   I purchased a copy of ShellMate through FHL.  I sent Frank a letter
detailing some of the problems that I had with the program just in the first
couple of hours of use.  He said that he had sent the letter to you because you
were acting as distributor for the product.
   Do you know if you've even received my letter from Frank?  What's the status
of ShellMate?  Is the product dead?  Should I try to get my money back? What?

Dave,
 I have talked Microware out of source in the past and severely altered the
Z8530 driver for our MVME147 system. I can't upload it as it is still basically
Microware's copyrighted source. What you *can* do is disassemble it with debug.
You will obviously have no symbols, but it might help. Maybe the people who
sold you your system will give you source to the drivers you do have. You are
correct in assuming they will be very similar, though the device set-up and
configuration stuff (eg: baud rates, bits/character) can be challenging,
especially if you want to provide hooks (setstat()'s) to change them on the
fly.
 That was 3 years ago. Since then, we wrote our own block-oriented file manager
(for protocol conversion) and *every* device driver I have written has been
doing some protocol's level II under *that* file manager.
 Good luck!
 Mark

Thanks for the info. I've contacted Peripheral Technologies and they're going

On September 17, 1991 from 8:30am to 4:00pm
    at  The Westin Galleria Hotel
        5060 West Alabama
        Houston, Tx  77056

and later

on September 19, 1991 from 8:30am to 4:00pm
    at  The Doubletree at the Campbell Center
        8250 North Expressway
        Dallas, Tx  75206

there will be Real-Time Computing Exhibitions.

  September 17, 1991 is a Tuesday, and
  September 19, 1991 is a Thursday.


The Exhibition is being arranged by Concept Development, Inc. and Systran
Corporation and sponsored by a variety of leading real-time system
manufacturers.  I'll try to have brochure copies at the next OS9/CoCo meetings,
if we meet in September before the Exhibition.

According to the letter that I got from Microware, they will be exhibiting the
following real-time software products:
 - Professional OS-9 Operating System (68030/VME)
 - Industrial OS-9 Embedded Operating System (68332/68340)
 - OS-9000 Operating System (80386)
 - RAVE (Real-Time Audio Video Environment)
 - OS-9 X-Windows

According to the brochure, there will be more than 25 sponsoring companies
involved with the exhibition.  (Some local, some from out of state.)

Motorola, SimPact Associates, Inc, Ready Systems, Force Computers, Inc.' and
many more will be showing off their wares.

Now to the important stuff...

Admission to the exhibits is FREE.... and according to the brochure... Food
constituting a light meal and refreshments are available throughout the aday at
NO CHARGE.  If you want to attend simply RSVP, or for further information call
1-800-733-1811.

CoCo3/OS-9ers should not expect there to be any 6809-based OS-9 system up and
running at the exhibition.  The preponderence of equipment looks to be 80386-
and 680x0-based.

(It looks like we are having an OS-9 'Fest here in Dallas (and earlier in
Houston), unfortunately it doesn't look like there's likely to be any
CoCo3-related stuff, but it could be fun to see some of the 68K/386 exhibits.
Hmmmm... I wonder if we could whip up an CoCo3/OS-9 exhibit in time for the
show.  Of course, there'd probably be a really high booth fee.  Just a
thought.) LV

Fred,
   Well, I'm pretty darn sure it's not for the lack of money!
   If like any other company, you set up a budget, with a campaign, and go for
it.....their campaign probably ended....nothing more, nothing less, and
certainly no sign of impending disaster.
