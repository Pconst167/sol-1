Bruce,

I'm trying to get your tsrun/tsmon package to work on my
system. My config is as follows:

512K Coco
B&B Hard Disk
SACIA driver (multipak version)
RS232 pak on slot 1

I have set up the following init file called init.t2 in /dd/sys:

ATZ
ATM0Q0V1X1&D2&C1S0=2E0
Unsupported baud rate on this phone line.
"CONNECT 2400":04
"CONNECT 1200":03
"CONNECT":01

When I call the programs like so: tsrun tsmon /t2 /dd/sys/init.t2 &
the system crashes with horizontal lines flashing on the screen upon
access to the disk.

If I run just "tsmon /t2 /dd/sys/init/t2 &", the modem is 
initialized just fine.

Do I need to do any special xmode to /t2 or set the modem kill bit?
If so, could you tell me how?

Hugo,
  I've tried tsrun, and it doesn't crash my system.  I don't know what is
wrong, but I'll get back to you if I figure it out.  If possible, don't use
tsrun... it is only really useful if you have set the "modem kill bit" (see
xmode in your OS-9 manual) anyway.

Just for the sake of science, could you give me an xmode of your /t2?

By the way, when I use your xmode on window devices, it doesn't work. (i.e.,
window parameters not shown, and cannot be changed). Is this correct?

Finally, could you explain swapped DSR DCD? Why would I implement it, what is
it supposed to do? How do I do it?

(Sorry for all the questions!)

~ Hugo,
  OK, here's an XMODE listing of my /T3 port (I don't have a /T2 port in
memory):

 nam=T3 mgr=SCF ddr=DACIA hpn=07 hpa=FF60 upc=00 bso=01
 dlo=00 eko=01 alf=01 nul=00 pau=00 pag=18 bsp=08 del=18
 eor=0D eof=1B rpr=09 dup=19 psc=17 int=03 qut=05 bse=08
 ovf=07 par=02 bau=06 xon=11 xof=13 col=50 row=18 xtp=45
 wnd=45 val= sty= cpx= cpy= fgc= bgc= bdc=

  It sounds like you're referring to the "wnd= val= sty= ..." stuff near the
end of the XMODE listing of a window descriptor.  As you will see in the
following listing, they can be changed, but only if the window descriptor's
option table size includes them.  Get my "WINVDG.AR" package if you want window
descriptors that are already set up that way, or you can modify your own window
descriptors by changing the byte at offset $0011 to $24.

 nam=W1 mgr=SCF ddr=CC3IO hpn=07 hpa=FFA1 upc=00 bso=00
 dlo=00 eko=01 alf=01 nul=00 pau=00 pag=18 bsp=08 del=18
 eor=0D eof=1B rpr=09 dup=19 psc=17 int=03 qut=05 bse=08
 ovf=07 par=80 bau=00 xon=00 xof=00 col=50 row=18 xtp=01
 wnd=01 val=01 sty=02 cpx=00 cpy=00 fgc=00 bgc=01 bdc=02

  Finally, swapped DSR+DCD is useful if you want your 6551 ACIA based serial
port to be able to receive characters even when DCD is not valid.  This is of
most interest to BBS SysOps, who want their BBS to be able to recognize when a
caller hangs up (DCD would go from valid to invalid) and reset itself, rather
than going through the hassle of the modem kill bit killing their BBS program
and then having to use a program like TSRUN to restart the whole thing.  The
easiest way to implement it is to simply swap the two lines on your serial
cable and then set the appropriate bit in the XTP byte.
  And don't worry about the questions, there hasn't been too much mail for me
here lately, so this is a nice change!

OK, I'll read your response offline.

Ah, so swapping involves some actual wire crossing, YUCK! By the way, what
would that do to telecom programs? Could I still call out?

I've been having nothing but frustration with your tsmon :-(.

I've had a friend calling in for testing, and tsmon never seems to recognize
when he presses ENTER.  I tried the Developer's pak tsmon, and it worked fine.
The only problem is when people hangup unexpectedly, which is something I'd
like to protect against!

I'll upload a summary of my efforts in another message.

Bruce,

As I said, I've had problems with your tsmon/tsrun combo. Anyway,
here's the init file that I send to the modem via the tsmon command
line: TSMON /t2 /dd/sys/init.t2 &

ATZ
ATM0Q0V0X1&D2&C1S0=2E0S25=100
Unsupported baud rate on this phone line.
"CONNECT 2400":04
"10":04
"CONNECT 1200":03
"5":03

Is there anything obviously wrong with it? When a caller calls, the modem
answers, carrier detect gets established but pressing return (I can see
the RD light flashing) yields nothing except a series of dots (SOMETIMES).

Here is an xmode of /t2 as I have it set up when I run TSMON:
 nam=T2 mgr=SCF ddr=SACIA hpn=07 hpa=FF68 upc=00 bso=01
 dlo=00 eko=01 alf=01 nul=00 pau=00 pag=00 bsp=08 del=18
 eor=0D eof=1B rpr=09 dup=19 psc=17 int=03 qut=05 bse=08
 ovf=07 par=0C bau=04 xon=11 xof=13 col=50 row=18 xtp=05
 wnd=05 val= sty= cpx= cpy= fgc= bgc= bdc=

Anything visibly wrong?

When I run the stock developer's pak tsmon, everything works peachy,
except if a caller hangs up without typing "ex", things get messy.
What possible difference can there be between the two where the stock
TSMON sees the CR and your TSMON doesn't???? I'm pulling my hair out
on this one.
I wonder if it's a problem of your tsmon never getting the CONNECT
string and running at the wrong baud rate???

~ Hugo,
  I'm afraid I don't know what is wrong, but I can pass along a couple ideas
that others have given to me when they had solved their tsmon/modem problems.
The first is from Rich Mailer, who found that his "Zoom" type modem hung up too
quickly when DTR dropped momentarily.  What happened was someone called in, the
modem connected, and then hung up on the caller.  The solution was to increase
the amount of time allowed before a DTR interruption causes the modem to hang
up.  Sorry, but I can't remember exactly which S register controls that... and
I can't find an equivalent S register in my modem manual.
  The other thing is related to exactly when the modem sets DCD enabled.  On my
modem, the CONNECT message comes in first, and then after that the DCD line is
enabled.  If your modem does this then you'll have to do the DSR+DCD swap to
get it to work with a 6551 ACIA.  Check your modem manual for info regarding
the DCD signal, you may be able to set it so DCD is enabled before the modem
sends result codes and CONNECT messages.  You can check if DCD is enabled too
late by getting someone to call in at the default baud rate, and then manually
typing in the CONNECT message after the modems have connected. Remember, when
my TSMON is given an "init" file parameter it doesn't respond to just a CR,
unless there's a line in the init file that has a CR connect message in it. 
You could do this with a file editor such as dEd, BTW.
  I can't see anything wrong with the sample "init" files you've posted.  As a
matter of fact, I used the first one you posted in a test and had no problems
with it.

Ok I see that the Grfdrv article is not here - I guess back then I only had an
account on GEnie - I'll get it up by the weekend then.  It was sparked by the
25-line text zap found in SuperComm's docs and all due respects paid therein.
I've had a few gripes about my copyrighting these articles - well the record
shows on Delphi that way too many things are plagerized and the patches are
never recorded in the database themselves, which makes other users ask the very
same questions every time the subject comes up around the world.  (Well here on
CIS, too, it's that way but more organized.  :-)  So to stop the abuse, I wrote
up everything we had, did all my own research (again credit is "paid" where it
was due - I do own all of y'all's books, not a photocopied one!), thought up
how to get those other modes working (yep a rewrite was needed) and I spit the
article out in hopes y'all would read it before the upgrades were finalized -
1.5 years ago!  So that's why I do them seemingly legal-sleeze things.  If I
mention something as specific as "I hope the authors of the L-II upgrade will
read this", well that's kinda giving y'all the authority to use it right then &
there - or so I thought!  :-)

As for the stat calls - the ACPDS7.TXT file mushes thru what we've been able to
accomplish so far with our Acia driver - I have been told by Ron Bihler that
Bill Brady will let us share it now.  I'm still waiting for the responses cuz
what we still need help on is already explained in that article (CIS and Delphi
both have it).  Again it's <C>'d cuz of the willful plagerizing that goes on
and I need to keep track of what we are all talking about when the help (e.g.
you & whomever) does come.  In order to support this driver, there is a
customization pgm to set the size of the send & recv buffers (separately). It
is *known* to cure all RiBBS ills, the y-reg problem with C-language pgms, and
the like, plus I can pretty darn well keep up with 9600 uncompressed I/O so
long as the host pauses at a full screen.  It still won't do 1k Xmodem

uh got cut off ... This ACPDS7.TXT file might shed some light on the subjects
we're needing help on.  Might show something "hidden" that messes up our 1k
Xmodem at 9600.  I actually stated in it that maybe there's a long-term timing
problem between the Acia & modem at 9600 or greater speeds, otherwise I dunno
why 1k Xmodem can't keep up while a whole 1920-byte 80x24 text screen will look
perfect.

I do have the L-I docs that R.S. sold way back then, around when 1.1.0 was
available.  Got the 2.0.0 docs also (they actually had my name on the mailing
list, kin U beleev?!).  So the ACPDS7.TXT shows what we're after and where
we've already been.

This time around, if the cost of an upgrade for L-II becomes such that the
manuals get editted, please consider an "optional" set of manuals for the
people who'd need the "complete" docs on everything.  Even big blue sells their
software/manuals that way: most users simply don't need a Diagnostics book or
example! - that's for the systems pgmrs!

Our local PBS station just broadcasted this week's "Computer Chronicles" and
the subject was CDROMs!  The companies are finally sending the same CD for both
PCs and Macs with the machine accessing the appropriate application pgms.  So
one hopes those of us who want to hook a drive up, can call or write the
software co. to get the poop on their database formats (as opposed to the ISO
sector & directory formats which *should* be standard, and OS9 would need the
file mgr for).

I called our local CDROM expert - my goodness he didn't want "us" to be able to
read these critters.  He even went so far to wonder whether what we're wanting
to do is a copyright violation.  I said - Listen, if I go down there to plunk
down $895.00 for Compton's Encyclopedia, is THAT a legal copy OR WHAT?

So ... y'all see the flack I'm getting ... bunch of crap if you ask me ... this
might embroil me enough to do some serious letter writing to those govmt
agencies that handle this kind of stuff, from anti-trust to freedom of
information in the case of those NASA CDs being shared (and Library of Congress
etc.).  Wonder if the Supreme Court would want to decide whether an "empire"
like CDROM is turning out to be, if it's unruly to force people to buy
particular kinds of computers instead of providing the format in order to
access a legally-bought CD's information.

IBM publishes their standards!  You can find out how RFT documents work and any
company can write their pgms to support that format (an idea I was hoping would
encroach on the people who write OS9 word processors).  It might be that
Compton's, for example, *does* share its database formats with those who've
bought the CD, and how to uncompress the pictures & animation.  That'd be okay!

Fm: Curtis Veit 76067,3225
To: Steve Bliss 75716,117

This could be done a couple of ways. 1. write a clone of the mac file system
for OS9 so your system can read
        the directories and files as they are. 2. Write a utility for both the
Mac and OS9 to read and write using
        some arbitrary simple format (perhaps something already written
        would work, such as tar). You would need to set aside a partition
        on the hard disk for this shared area. (Yes the Mac can partition
        hard drives with third party software like silver lining, (from
        LaCie I think). This can be done by bit diddling on the hard disk
        IF ... 1. You have the info telling how? (I've seen it but I don't
        know where). 2. You are brave and like to risk all the data on your
        disk. 3. Write a utility to pass info from the Mac to OS9 directly over
the SCSI
        port. (this is probably the easy choice (comparatively)). After
choseing one of the above be sure to set up your SCSI IDs so they don't
conflict (I believe the Mac is ID=7, not adjustable). The Mac hard disk is
usually ID=1 and is adjustable directly on the drive if nowhere else.

If you actually attempt this I'd love to hear about it. As you might guess from
the above there might be alot of pitfalls along the road to any of these
solutions.

It definitely isn't wired for 32 column. It runs there but doesn't fit.

I think Bob may have a handle on the problem (msg.#9676) and I am going to try
his suggestion. The main symptom (as Bob mentioned) is that the screen just
simply doesn't show up. If I press the proper keys in response to the program's

up MV and can be freed if I use the keyboard mouse  to get to CONTROL and get
out again. I replaced the IC  in both  of  them. One seems to be fixed for a
few days and back  to the same problem again.

The other problem I encountered with one of them is that when the cursor 
reached about one inch from the right edge or the  bottom edge  of the screen
it "jump" to the edge of the screen. There is nothing  in between. I tried to
fix the problem by replacing  all the   component  on the board. Is there
anybody out there with  a service  manual  covering the part list of the  hires
interface? What  is the value of C1. I replaced all the other components and
the problem presists.

I think I've seen the behavior Nam Pui describes.  There's a strip down the
right hand side of the screen such that if you enter it, the mouse cursor is
immediately dragged over to the far right side of the screen, making it almost
impossible to position the mouse within that strip.

The problem I've more recently had is jittery mouse, with the mouse cursor
jumping back and forth even when the mouse is stationary.

What this probably *really* means is it's time to seriously look at smouse.ar.

Hey James, I also have a mouse that is very sensitive on the right edge of the

For your jumpy cursor, try moving the mouse cables around a little. I had the

rest of my loaded utils 16k, and grfdrv 8k.  My term is patched to come up as a
type 2 window and uses 8k. Thats it...72k.  This means I should have 440k free
mem. Where is the other 48k?? Thanks in advance...Dave

Shell itself would need a block for it's data.  The kernel itself may add
another block, plus one for it's data (process descs, path descs, etc).

With MMap and PMap, you should be able to see exactly where all the blocks have
gone.  Got those?

Kevin,

I do have MMap and PMap, but this my first real forage into the heavy duty,
behind the scenes OS9 works so I've been getting "slightly" confused and
disoriented of late :-).  I read in The Complete Rainbow Guide to OS9 that OS9
Level II needs 64K for the operating system (pg 10).  Does this mean that even
if OS9Boot needs only 32K of memory, an additional 32K is still put aside by
the OS?  Are the Boot, OS9P1, and REL part of OS9P2 or are they already in the
system (ROM)?  I've been doing my calculations assuming that they are part of
OS9P2 and take up part of OS9Boot's 32K.  If they are not merged in with OS9P2
then they take up a separate 8K block.  Or do they each take up a separate 8K
block (which comes to 24K).  Even if thats the case, I'm still short 24K
somewhere.  Shell+ is already linked in memory so Term should just take up an
additional 8K for the term-window itself.

I'll try using MMap and PMap again and see if I can get this figured out down
to the BYTE (yeah, right).

Thanks,

Dave

With no help from the Tandy OS9 LII manual (man, is it confusing) and with the
help of your pmap and smap utilities, I've come to few conclusions about memory
use under OS9 LII.  Is any of this right or am I way off base??:

When a module is loaded into memory, only its module size uses up memory(at the
top of free RAM).  When a module becomes an active process, its data then uses
up memory(at the bottom of free RAM).  These memory requirements can be found
with ident==>Module size and Data size.

Everything in OS9Boot is considered active and takes up memory in both code
(top) and data(bottom) RAM areas.  All these modules together, along with Boot,
REL, and OS9P1 are known collectively as "System".

If modules are merged, as in OS9Boot, they load without leaving 8K block gaps
between them.  Therefore, if a merged file has modules needing altogether 25K,
then you actually use 32K of RAM or 4 blocks.

Code blocks and data blocks are separate and use up 8K blocks individually of
eachother.

EVEN if the total System memory requirement is less than 64K, 64K is still
reserved and whatever the difference is not useable.

Now for some questions :-) ==>

1) Why doesn't PMap show the memory blocks for active windows?

2) If you iniz or wcreate two 4K windows, do they use up only 8K together, or
do they each use 8K(through my fumblings I've seem to come to the conclusion
that they both wind up in the same 8K block)?

3)Why does SLED use up 16K of data RAM when ident shows it to need only 8K==>
data size: #4101 ??

4) Why do I invariably never get my memory back when I deiniz or display 1b 24
a window?  The window disappears and so does the memory!!!

Hey, who knows...5, 10 more years of this and I might even be able to write a
decent program ;-).

Thanks...Dave

Dave - you're right on target, with the sole exception that: the System process
doesn't go ahead and allocate 64K of RAM, but will get more if it needs to.  If
your PMAP shows the system map to be all full up, then that happened.

PMap only shows what "64K images" have been assigned to process descriptors
(it's a Process Map).  It's to help you visualize how block numbers are shared
if they hold a module, and to show that code is mapped in high and data mapped
in at lower addresses, and to help debug memory requirements, etc.

MMap kinda shows the window RAM usage... the window memory comes from the
highest block numbers (with the kernel taking up block 3F at the very top).
WDir (in the libs) will actually tell you the block number(s) being used for
each window, if that'll help.  Each little tool tells a piece <grin>.

The SLED answer: I dunno, but any program can ask for more RAM after it starts
up, which could be what's happening there.

Yes, two 4K windows will try to use the same 8K block if possible. Use DDir to
make sure that the deiniz actually gave up the window.  There is a bug with the
text windows tho... what happens is this: if the window was visible when it's
given up, it is CLS'd.  Unfortunately that happens AFTER a "this block is free"
flag ($FF) was stored in the first byte of that 4K section when the RAM was
given back :-(  So the memory effectively disappears from use. Ouch.  I'll see
if I have a patch.  Fast grfdrv?  - kev

Kev...

Thanks so much for the explanations!!!!

Ok..when I did PMap, System used only 48k.  I was still missing 16K somewhere.

Then it kinda dawned on me...I had two immortal shells running.  Since Shell is
loaded in memory, it takes up 8K. When it comes alive in /term, it needs to
take an additional 8K for data.  When the second shell came up, it also needed
an additional 8K for data, but lived in the same 8K code block as the original
shell.  I had counted only 16K for both shells when in reality it was 24K. 
That accounted for 8 of the 16k still missing.  Now, even though mfree is
loaded into memory, when it is called it takes up an 8k block of RAM for ITS
data.  Therefore, when you do an mfree, you actually have an extra 8K that will
be given back once mfree is finished (ie  mfree=48K + 8K for mfree data which
will be returned = 56K).  Did I find my missing 16k or am I reaching for
straws(or bytes)????:-)

As for losing memory with my windows...usually the window is visible when I
deiniz or display 1b 24.  This is because I run basic09 in one window and Sled
in another (sled/basic09<>>>/w#).  If I quit B09 and sled, the window remains
(dead of course).  I use wcreate to make my windows...does this make a
difference?? Actually, I do iniz one window right away and merge stdfonts,etc
to it.

I just download fstgrf today...as a matter of fact I just finished making a
bootable shellplus with alot of the patches I'v been living without(gfx2,
fstgrf,cc3disk.ipc,scffix,new copy and list, and ls).  Iwas able to give myself
an extra 16k of ram(64k total now) with everything either loaded or in an
/r0/cmds/file.  Which comes to my final :-) question.

When I try to format a disk with my newly booted shell+ and patches, I get an
error 237...insufficient Ram.  Mfree says I have 64k free.  Did the CC3Disk
patch cause this??? All other cmds seem to work fine.

CRC of patched CC3IO: $E11F29, Edition #11

Once again, thanks for your patience and help.  I'll get Wdir and see if I can
figure out these windows....does fstgrf fix this???...I didn't check it on the
new boot...hm...

Dave - gee, you sound like an expert <grin>!  Yes, I think you found your
missing memory.

The 237 is different from 207.  207 means not enuf RAM left in the whole
system.  237 means there's no room left in the system 64K map.

In the case of format, that meant there was not enuf system ram (SMap) left to
allocate for the necessary 6K+ track format data buffer.

That's a toughie, there, and I think we all run into it... especially with the
large bootfiles we now have.  Only solution: either kill off some shells, or do
formatting when you first boot up ;-).

PS: is /r0 inside your 512K?  If so, it makes more sense to merge and preload
any commands, instead of storing them on internal ramdisk... as loading and
executing them means you're using twice the RAM!  Ramdisks make more sense for
data only under OS9.  best - kev

Kev,

I could've kicked myself when I read about /r0.  I was so enchanted with the
speed, that I totally forgot/didn't realize that I would use up twice the ram.
Oh well, time to write a new OS9Boot :-)!

About error 237...I understand the part about not having enuf system ram left..
SMap does show it using up the full 64K.  But, I don't understand what killing
Shells will do.  I don't have shell in my OS9Boot.  It loads separately with
other merged files and then I link it in the stsrtup file.  OR...does it load
into System ram???  But PMap shows each shell (2 altogether) to occupy a
different 64k block. I'll kill one of the Shells and see if it works, and if it
does I'll be da*ned if I'll know why >:-| !!!

As always, THANKS!!!!

Dave - ok, the part about killing off shells, windows or other programs (last
first) to carve out some system map space for format is because:

OS9 uses up that system space for process and path descriptors, and window
device variables, etc.  Check your SMap, start a new shell, then check SMap
again.  Anywhere from two to four or more pages are used up for each new
process.

So.. by getting rid of the lastmost-setup devices/processes, you can sometimes
regain enough free system map space for the format buffer.

Kev,

Got it about the system map space!

I finally got up and running with commands loaded into mem instead of /r0 and
patched shell+ so it would only reserve 1 page of mem when it chained/forked a
process instead of 31 pages (thanx Paul Seniura!).  This now leaves me with a
whopping 112K free,  including a 77K ramdisk :-)!! Takes a while to load, but I
think I can live with it (he he!).

Thanks for the help....I really learned a GREAT deal!!!!

I am new to the forum and new to OS-9.  I have been looking into different
operating systems for use in a real time embedded system for my company.  I
have heard a lot of good things about OS-9/OS-9000 and I'd appreciate any help
you forum members can give me.  Some questions I have are:

1)      What company distributes an 80386 version of OS-9000?
2)      Is OS-9000 a real time system (priorities, pre-emption...)?
3)      Does anyone out there use OS-9000 in a real time environment?
4)      Does anyone out there run OS-9000 on an 80386?

Thanx for any help you can give me...

William, although I can't answer your questions quite yet, give me a couple of
weeks and I might be able to give you a bit of insight. You see, I have OS-9000
on order (it should arrive within the next few days), complete with the RAVE
graphics system. I have been using OS-9 for years and if OS-9000 is even 3/4 of
what OS-9 is, then I predict it is EXACTLY what you are looking for. I decided
to move to OS-9000 after studying a set of OS-9000 and Rave manuals for a
couple of months and finding that Microware has apparently not left anything
out from the OS-9 product, and actually added a few nifty new things.

I'll report back here as soon as I have a chance to play with it for awhile.

By the way, I am the Engineering Manager for a company who designs industrial
controls (primarily for resistance welding robots), hence my interest in real
time control systems. Besides, computers are one of my hobbies and I just HAD
to have the most powerful operating system you can get for a home computer
<grin>!

One last comment (for the benefit of you UG guys that are reading this
message): I'll get back into the OS-9/68000 game when CD-I FINALLY SHOWS UP AT
THE CES IN JUNE!!! In the meantime, I've bought myself a PC.

MS-DOS does indeed suck, and Windows ain't much better. Give me GEM or MAC any
day. I hope I can do some good stuff with Rave.

Denise, I had listened to a bit of Rhapsody earlier, but last night I had time
to listen to the whole thing and found that it doesn't quite get to the end.  I
think the last note was an eighth-note chord after bar 230 or 231.  Using DED
to examine the .ar file shows a string of nulls at the end which doesn't look
normal.  Did you have any indication that the upload was unsuccessful?  Have
you downloaded it yourself to check its condition? Perhaps you should chat with
the sysop and maybe upload it again??  Sounds good, and I would like to hear
the proper ending.  There's always the possibility that the problem is on my
end somehow, so please let me know what you find out.  A vagrant thought; you
did end the last measure with a bar, didn't you?  Thanks and regards, Ches.

Fm: Dan Charrois 70721,1506
To: all







c/0.1/0.1/ I have a problem with communications on my Coco.  I have used the
serial port for quite some time, both under RSDOS and with OS9 using the
"build-your-own internal RS232 chip" featured in Rainbow several years ago. (I
believe it was called "The forgotten chip".  At any rate, it has just decided
to stop working.  Even using thbitbanger method of communicating with the port
under RSDOS doesn't seem to do the job. I have disconnected my modification
from the SALT chip and the computer is able to communicate with the printer
just fine (I re-installed the trace that needed to be removed as well..) 
Things should be back to normal, but although communication with the printer
through the bitbanger is possible, it is not with the modem. (It seems as
though the modem must be a little more fussy with voltage levels than the
printer is.)  Digging a little deeper, I found that sending a 0 to the port
gave 0.1V at pin6 of the SALT and a 1 ives 4.7V.  This seems fine enough.  But
pin 12, which seems to be connected to the output port (and hence the
peripherals) outputs a 4.1V on a 0, and 1.2V on a 1.  I thought the standard
was in the 12V range..?? At any rate, this subtle difference dsn't make fr
great logic levels, and I think this is why the modem can't figure out what's
going on.
  So, what I'm asking is, is this response to be expected for a SALT chip, or
should I look into installing a new one?  This is rather frustrating since I
operate a BBS under OS9 and it'll have to be down until I fix this.
 Thanks for your reply....Dan

Haven't checked it on my machine, but I believe the output should be around +/-
5 volts... they define RS232 as +/- 3 to 12 volts, I think.

Sounds like no negative regulation going on.  The input at pin 15 should be a
negative voltage (unregulated) of at least -10v.   If not, check those large
diodes at the pwr  supply.

Well thank you!  I'm about to upload a mess of CMFs for the Roland MT32 I found
on CIS' MIDI SIG.  PolySoft shared some demos of their commercial "jukebox"
library.  They sound so good, as soon as I get the MFConverter 100% right, I'm
going to order their libraries!  And then I found four Impromptus (piano
concerts) on IEMUG some time back, so I'll upload those, too.

Once the MFConv utility comes out, I highly discourage uploading and sharing
the CMFs since everyone's MIDI systems are different.  The MFConv util will
have lots of options to selectively NOT output those special MIDI controls.
This means someone could convert then upload an EDITTED PIECE!  That's a no-no
in several of the "permissions" I have seen over at the MIDI SIG, whereby they
want to share their pieces but in their entireity (regardless of the converted
form), which is what these CMFs are that I've uploaded. Let a user convert &
modify his own version, that's okay, but don't upload it.

These are just to get everyone's mouth watering.  I suspect once we can get
into/out-of UME format, we'll ask to delete these versions.  That is, if Mike
Knudsen will start supporting the extra MIDI controls (he knows which ones I
mean :-).

Let me get busy uploading ... -- Thx, Paul Seniura (76476,464).

Hi.  Unzip 3.0 I found on Delphi and/or the RiBBS HQ BBS.  They kept putting
out a really bad-working version from Sam Smith's Tools BBS (who makes/ports
things to Amiga I think; I forget).  3.0 is the first one that has held up
across different Zip files.  Ported to OS9 by Vaughn Cato.  If somehow we can
get permission, I think I have the complete package as distributed.

Oh lemme peek inside his original file here ... (dontcha love true multitasking
windows so I don't hafta logoff to do it?!).

It seems that Vaughn made this version of UnZip "from the general UnZip that is
provided as source code and is available anywhere".  But he went on to say he
couldn't share the sources for OS9 as modified *because* of a restriction for
sharing modified sources.  He only shared the executable and the short readme
that says this.  I'll post it and let the Sysop decide.

Btw Sam Smith (I *think* it *is* Amiga software he ports things to) is the main
dude to ask for the sources, in fact I've called his BBS up a few times in the
past.  Get a '-?' listing when ya get it runnable, and it'll mention his BBS
phone # etc.  :-)

Frankly I don't like the Zip format -- smells of a copyright violation with the
U.S. Post Office if you ask me.  Plus this is the format that Phil Katz
invented after getting sued by (and lost to) the SEA folks (ARC people), if you
remember that broo-ha-ha.  Katz changes this format, too, more drastically than
any other format I know of (even IBM's mainframe stuff!).

Come to think of it, the PC people with their "software distribution networks"
over the Fido system, has been (still are) using a PAK extension to all of
their compressed files -- AND THIS IS *NOT* COMPATIBLE WITH G.B.Janssen's OS9
Pak utility that is found here.  Moreover, Janssen's PAK is copyrighted a at
least a whole year EARLIER than the earliest copyright for the PC "version". I
promptly reported this to the Fido officials and *boy* did they yell back at
me.  If they do it it's okay, but if we can PROVE we were "first" with a naming
convention and how it can cause confusion, we get our faces slapped.  I mean
this is exactly what SEA/PKWARE were feuding over minus the source-code
stealing.  That slap in my face got me so frustrated (we can't unpak their
goodies etc., plus it IS NOT in a form usable by DeArc no matter what they
say).  I've not kept up with Fido and haven't been hooked up for two or more
months now (mainly getting the MIDI & hardware mods going but the Pak issue

Paul, that's an interesting list of incompatibles.  I had suspected some of it

Your aside remark about the pleasure of multi processing allowing a quick look

trust you know your message was too long and was truncated?  I saw on the MIDI

Dear Forum Members,

I have been trying to run ar68.bin on my 68030 VME computer for several weeks. 
I have contacted several Forum members and Microware customer support, but I
still have problems.

The problem I am having is that when I try to run ar68.bin, OS-9 thinks it is a
procedure file and prints 'Can't execute "J" ...'.
When I do an IDENT on the file I get the message 'incomplete module'. 

When I looked at the file size in the file itself, I found that it was larger
than what the dir command showed.  I think this indicates that the file was
truncated, but I am not sure how this happened.

If anyone has the source to ar68.bin, or knows how to fix the problem, I would
like to hear from you.

Sincerely,

Hi Scott - the source to AR should be in DL9... unfortunately, it's in AR
format :-).

Can you load AR?  If so, then you can Save it back out and that should fix
things up.  Ooops.  Wait.  You say part of it is missing?  You may have to
download it again.

PS: the "can't execute J" thing.... always confuses people.  What that means is
that you have the command in the wrong place.  Try moving it to your commands
directory, and be sure to set execution attributes on it.

Here's the deal.  As you know, OS9 searches memory first, then the exec dir,
and then looks in the data dir for a *shell procedure* text file.  GRIN. Guess
what the first byte of an OS9 module is in ASCII?   If you guessed "J", you're
correct!   The shell tried to run it as a shell script, and got terribly
confused.   best - kev

Kevin,

Thanks for responding to my request.

Unfortunately, since the AR program source is in AR format, I can't unpack it
until I get AR running.

I tried downloading the file 3 times, twice on Compuserve and once on a
friend's PC using the Bit-Com communications program.  All three files compared
the same and produced the same result ... 'incomplete module' when I ran the
IDENT program.

I was hoping you might have a copy of AR unpacked which you could send to me or
upload onto Compuserve.

If you can't upload or send the source of AR, maybe you could suggest some
other approach to this problem. 

Thanks,

What happens when you try to load it?  "load -d ar"  Does OS9 refuse?

I've asked that a copy of a merged text version of the AR source be placed into
DL9 for you... should show up within a coupla days.  Worst case, you can edit
that out into separate files and compile it.  Keep us informed.

I am not sure if anyone else out there does source code version control. We use
something called Software Management System (SMS) from Intesoft in UK. It did
not come with a "what" command like Unix SCCS (with which it is loosely
compatible) so I wrote it. If anyone wants it (other than to just see what it
does), respond and I'll upload it.
 If you just want to know what it does, here it is:
 You put a line in each source code file like this:
 static char *smsid = "$Header$";
 sms does substitution in $Header$ of a string identifying the source code
name, version, and date. "what" displays these strings in a binary (or .r, or
c for that matter) and you can see what versions of what files are linked into
your module. Now you know. If you have no source code control, it will be of
little use.

 A friend has found a strange problem with Basic09 and we both would like
 to hear your ideas. From a VDG screen, run a GFX("mode",1,2) GFX("quit").
 Try to rerun the program. I keep getting errors which only clear up with a
 $display # where # can be anything. If I replace the "quit" with a print or
 put #1 chr$($12), I still get the same error. However, if I shell "display 12"
 then the program works just fine.  GFX is just doing a write $12 to CC3IO as
 is the print and put. So why do I need a shell intermediary?
   The error varies from 246 to 207 to others, but is based on problems with
 screen deallocation. Even a $display 0 clears up the problem. Any ideas?

 It sounds like what I experience when io is blocked to a screen.  Instead of
 "display #" if I just do a dir or procs or any command that generates io
 on the current screen it fixes the error.  This also happens when I abort
 a command that uses pipes and so I attributed it to io that doesn't get
 flushed to the stdout (maybe because its buffered?) until you do something
 like running another command that flushes the buffer.

 Is this just another "feature" of os9?

Tom - I can't duplicate the problem here, but then I'm patched a bit.

I wrote a two line basic09 program: run gfx("mode",1,2) and run gfx("quit"),
and it worked over and over.

My GFX brain is rusty tho.  What kind of screens have you used before this is
done, etc?  Also, is a progam always alive on that VDG window?

Bruce,

I've built myself an rs232 cable with swapped DSR/DCD so now there shouldn't be
a problem with the serial port not receiving connect messages from the modem. 
With the swapped DSR/DCD, I now xmode /t2 XTP=85 instead of XTP=05 that I used
previously. Is TSMOn smart enough to deal with the "OK" messages sent back from
the modem?

As far as modem connect, that part is fine. The connection is made, but TSMON
just doesn't recognize the caller's carriage returns. After a call-in attempt,
a PROC command shows that TSMON is suspended.

Variables: 1. I use Dennis Skala's clock driver for the B&B. That driver is
supposed to be compatible with the clock you provide in the Eliminator software
package.

2. My multipak is not upgraded. Before I used the hardware clock driver, the
system time would advance at an exceptional rate during serial port
transmissions.  I notice the keyboard repeat is "enhanced" during serial
transmissions also.  Could it be tha the non-upgraded multipak can be causing
me grief??

Someday this will be behind me, but right now it's tough to keep a smile on my
face!

Hugo - definitely yes: the non-upgraded MPI is causing your clock/keybd
problems.  It's because when the cpu reads the GIME irq register, your MPI is
turning on and overwhelming the data bus with false info.  The upgraded MPI
doesn't do that.  best - kev

Umm. The term programs only require that the characters incoming are found, and
the extra fake interrupt flags (caused by the MPI) actually would help there,
perhaps... altho causing some cpu time to be wasted checking for irqs that
didn't really exist.

OK, I've been testing again with my friend today and things were especially
bad. I would start any tsmon (microware's, Bruce's, Bruce's patched by my
friend, etc) and every time, your proc command would show Tsmon suspended.

I've ordered the satellite board upgrade for my mpak from Howard Medical.
Should arrive next week sometime. Hopefully, upgrading will solve the problem
because I just don't see where I'm doing anything wrong. And I want to get UUCP
up and running so bad now!

What's weird is that my friends Mpak isn't upgraded either, and he has no
problems. Such is life.

~ Hugo,
  As Kevin said, the un-upgraded MPI is probably causing some of your problems,
so get it upgraded ASAP.  As for the B&B clock, it should be OK. Actually, it
really wouldn't matter if it had the GIME IRQ toggle or not, except Rx
characters might be lost more often.  But I doubt it'd cause the total lack of
response you're seeing.
  A couple more things to check.  If your modem has LED status lights, can you
see if the Tx and Rx lights come on (virtually) solid as soon as the connection
is made?  If so, your modem echo isn't being turned off by the "initialization"
string properly, although it looked fine in your example "init" file.  Also,
your serial port's echo isn't being turned off by TSMon, though it's supposed
to do that whether or not it was enabled in the first place.
  Also, try enabling "forced DTR".  That'd be "xtp=C5" with swapped DCD+DSR, or
"xtp=45" with regular DSR+DCD.  That should prevent any small period of time
where DTR is dropped when TSMon forks LogIn, though it really shouldn't happen
at all.
  Speaking of LogIn, what happens when you try "TSMon" in a window.  No "init"
file, just start TSMon all by itself.  Does LogIn work properly then, finding
the password file (./SYS/password or /DD/SYS/password, or whatever your LogIn
wants) and so on?
  One other thing is you said "... caller's carriage returns.", but you didn't
say whether the caller tried typing in the full "CONNECT" message followed by a
carriage return.  Please try that and let me know the results.
  I'm sorry I can't be more help, but I only use the TSMon program's most basic
(original) capabilities.  I did have a terrible time writing it (as Pete Lyall
said, and auto-baud TSMon is among the most difficult trivial programs to
write) and getting it to work decently.  And it does work for me, when I test
the auto-baud stuff... though as you've found out some people have no luck with
it at all.

Bruce,

The other day I tried the stock tsmon, and immediately upon initialization, a
PROC command would show the process as suspended. The other day it worked fine.

Then I tried your tsmon with and without the initialization file.  Sometimes it
works, sometimes it doesn't (set up corectly). However, sometimes it seems to
set up just fine. Then a caller calls in, and the PROC command shows the
program as suspended with an AGE of 255.

So either with or without an initialization file, your tsmon does absolutely
nothing except get suspended once someone calls in.

By serial port echo, does that mean I should set eko=0 ?

TSMon works fine in windows.

~ Hugo,
  I don't think being suspended is the problem, but maybe it is a clue.  The
serial driver must be suspending TSMON because it tried to read when there was
no data available, which is normal.  The problem appears to be with either the
hardware or driver for the serial port.
  You need to be using a driver that supports the get/set status calls required
by TSMON, such as SACIA.  ACIAPAK will not do the job, unless it is a
customized version, and even then if there are problems I can't help you at
all.  If the driver isn't at fault, then you need to ensure that DCD is valid
for the 6551 ACIA to receive data.  If you have swapped the DCD+DSR lines, make
sure that your modem forces DSR valid (which is then swapped and hooked up to
the 6551's DCD input).  If you haven't swapped DCD+DSR, then make sure your
modem enables DCD before transmitting any data to the 6551 ACIA.  Also, make
sure that the /T2 descriptor's "swap DCD+DSR" bit in the XTP byte matches the
serial cable.
  I think you mentioned once that you've done the DCD+DSR swap, so the first
thing to do is ensure that the modem forces DSR enabled all the time.

Bruce, I'm doing one last ditch effort. On the software end, everything is in
order. I have a swapped DCD/DSR cable, I have set XTP=85, and I'm using the
SACIA.mpi driver.  I'll let you know what happens once I install the satellite
upgrade board in my multipak. Kevin Darling recommended that I perform the
upgrade since it may be possible that my problems are MPI related.

Hugo,
  Yes, by all means do the MPI upgrade.  It could be the problem, I've seen
stranger things!  Anyway, did you check to ensure that your modem forces DSR
(now hooked to the 6551 ACIA's DCD input) enabled?  Also, I assume SACIA has
been set up for the appropriate MPI select code...?  By default the sacia.mpi
driver sets the MPI for floppy controller in slot 4 and RS-232 Pak in slot 1.

As of yesterday, the MPI upgrade board is installed. (My first hardware

Now, I need to have someone call in to test that %&$#* TSMON.  If it doesn't
work, I'll scream.

By the way, I was meaning to ask you about that slot select stuff mentioned in
the eliminator manual.  It says something about setting a byte at some offset
in SACIA. I don't quite understand what you were trying to explain.  Right now,
my floppy controller (Disto DC-7) is in Slot 4, B&B controller is in slot 3,
and rs232 pak is in slot 1. Is this the definitely the default that SACIA.mpi
is set for?

I'll let you know how the tsmon stuff goes once I can get Bob Billson to call
in. (He was working with Rich Mailer, if you remember).

Hi Dale.  You already got the hard part done.  Now set the file permissions on
Ar, so that OS-9 will let you load, run, and/or delete it:

 attr /d1/ar e pe w

You might also want to copy it to your CMDS dir.  Or just load it with a full
pathname, like

 load /d1/ar

Okay, once you get it loadable, then you need to know how to use it... which is
the semi-complicated part.  Basically, you CHD to the directory where you want
the broken-out files to end up.  For example, let's say you downloaded sterm.ar
to drive 0.  First, make sure it has the ".ar" extension on the filename.  Now,
if you wanted to break it out to drive 1, you'd say:

 chd /d1               <== where files will go
 ar -x /d0/sterm       <== where sterm.ar is now

All the files will be de-archived to /d1. Ignore any "archive" errors; they're
probably due to xmodem padding adding junk to the file and confusing ar.  You
can also do an "ar -t /d0/sterm" and check what files are in an archive first,
if you wish.  Yell if need help.

About the MFConverter.AR package I uploaded.  You need to read the
documentation, especially the RULES section, before using the program.
Basically, it's like this:

I'm going to ask that all the Sysops to not accept CMF files (output from the
MFConv program).  In fact I'm asking you not to share any such output on any
system whatsoever.

If the original SMF file can be shared, THEN SHARE IT INSTEAD, and it *should*
be placed on the MIDI SIGs rather than the CoCo or OS9 SIGs.

Once the MFConv and MFPlay programs have been on the OS9 SIGs for a sufficient
amount of time, I will delete the CMFs I have posted myself.  I'll make a new
archive with the two programs and new documentation sans CMF files.  There will
be plenty of SMFs to download and use in the MIDI SIGs everywhere.

I feel by providing some sample CMFs will help in getting a firm grip on how to
use the MFConv program.  These samples can be used as a comparison to see if
you are running MFConv correctly.  After a while, even myself will succumb to
these rules and won't be sharing CMFs anymore.

You're whining "Why the restrictions?" I bet.  If you need reasons, they are
explained in the readme file.  So please read it before commencing.

I'm posting the same rules on every network I have accounts on.

From: BOB BILLSON

Can you ask anyone who might be able to help, how to get 
Shell+ v2.1 NOT to strip the '%' from a command line?
 
I am attempting to write a smart mailer to be used with both of current OS-9 
UUCP programs out there.  In order to be able to handle Internet-style 
addresses properly such as:  bob%kc2wz.uucp@fdurt1.fdu.edu
 
When Shell+ gets done with the address it becomes: bobkc2wz.uucp@fdurt1.fdu 
.edu  definitely not the same thing.
 
Quoting the address like you can do with '!' to protect it from the shell 
doesn't help.  Shell+ still removes the '%'.  I guess no matter what it treats 
the % as a shell variable.
 
Seems like a bug in Shell+.  Does anyone have a way to fix this?

You have to preface any command that has a percent sign (%) in it with a SHELL+
2.1 command to turn off the shell variable feature.

 OS9:-v
 OS9:{command with a % in it}
 OS9:v

 The -v and v turn the variable feature off and on, respectively.


I ran into the same problem with RSB commands which use a % to point to an
drive containing in RS-DOS diskette.

This could be interesting, we've been playing with a ported version of LHArc
now for about 6, maybe 8 months!  Did you define a new extended header for OSK
file info? (Store the attributtes, etc...)  This version does, and I'd hate to
see multiple/different versions around for OSK.  We've have been creating and
extracting data with LHArc for some time now.  So we need to keep something
like this standardized.  Know what I mean?

Mike:
   I just did a quick and dirty port of the UNIX version.  I needed it in a
hurry - the PTB on FidoNet decided to change the archive method for FidoNews
from ARC 5.12 to LHArc without warning anyone.  My only other choise would have
been to find someone with a Mess-dos machine to unpack the FidoNews files for
me.  So I FTP'ed the UNIX port of lharc and ported it.  I only use it to unpack
FidoNews issues (a minor pain since the files arrrive on my CP/M-68K machine
and I have to ship the file to my OSK machine to unpack and repack as an .ARC
file for processing on my CP/M-68K machine).  I also ported the UNIX version of
UNZIP too (a simular quick and dirty done in "self-defense").

It seems that the mess-dos world seems to be insisting on using these
non-portable archiving methods...  And seem to have little interest in
supporting people with other operating systems (as if such people are some
oddball minority or something).

 Hello all.

 I don't know if this question was asked before but, here goes.  I was
 wondering if someone can give the information needed on the hardware/
 software needed to connect OS-9 to "packit" radio?

 I know a cupple of "ham's" in my area, but they are using clone systems
 so that don't help any!  If someone could point me in the right direction,
 any and all info you could give is GREATLY appreciated!!!

John,

"Packet" (not 'Packit') radio is a general term that doesn't always tell
exactly what you're going to be doing.

If you're merely wanting to hook up your computer to a TNC and do real-time
control of the TNC, to talk on the air, do the TNC controlling, etc, then any
terminal program should work... as long as you are NOT using a standard RS-232
ROMPack (which requires that the Carrier Detect be held hi in order for
incoming data to be passed along back to the computer).

Since OS-9 is an operating system that operates on several different, very
divergant, computer systems, you'll have to specify your hardware before we can
tell you much more.

Greeting-
     I have uploaded a modified version of Pete's uptime utility to the utility
lib.  It can be found in uptime2.ar. The mod consists of putting the date and
time in the uptime display. Works great under os9 and under Coherent (the $99
unix clone) My question is why does it bomb out under OSK?!  someone with more
OSK experience please fix it and point the errors out to me as I have been
having no luck with anything involving time under OSK!

      Thanks for any help, and to those folks who use the prog under OS9 enjoy!

Brett,

I took a look at your code and found a couple of things you might have missed
in the manual.  First, the 'tm' time structure is defined under 'mktime()' in
the MW C manual.  tm_mon is the number of months AFTER january, so in order to
get the correct month add 1.  The code was also failing to compile cause there
is no headers 'utime.h' or 'lowio.h'. In order to get around that I used an
#ifdef OSK preprocessor directive to include the proper defines and headers for
OSK.  Also I changed the variable 'clock' to 'clck', cause clock is an OSK
function.  All the long's in the code I changed to 'time_t' and added a typedef
long time_t to the OS9 ifdef switch, mainly cause that's what the OSK time
functions return and are defined as in the header 'time.h'.  (Plus it made it
easier for me! It works fine now.  One more thing, If you really meant
/R0/SYS/uptime to be the filename, I assume you're iniz'ing the Ramdisk and
making the SYS directory on /R0 before running the util, right?

I think I've found the problem.  But I still don't have the solution.  Dosor9
didn't finish with the disk, it was ending with an FC error in 2330.  I think
it only wrote the directory and then ended because sterm1.ar was too long. 
When I tried to us it on sterm.ar it said "too fragmented" and ended.  What now

Dale - okay, that makes sense.  Under rsdos, try copying the file to a fresh

libs which handles files larger than 64K... that's the main prob.

 I have been ofered a WD 1002-HDO controller.
 The person that has them has told me that they are a
 direct replacement for the WD 1002-05.
 The instruction set in the WD1002-HDO is more extensive
 but otherwise the same as the WD1002-HDO. Now I have no
 real way to check this out so I am hoping that you may
 know something about these controllers and will be able
 to solve this dillema for me.

When I was last paying attention to the WD-1005-xxx series, I was told by Kent
Meyers that the HDO was hard disk only (or was it Steve Odneal, who put out the
predecessor to the Isted system?) That's my only reference to the HDO unit, as
all of mine (3) have been -05's. If you can't get a response from Bruce, try
calling Computer Surplus listed in the Computer Shopper. They were selling
WD-1005's for long time (may still have them) and could probably tell you.

  As I said in EMAIL, the WD 1002-HDO is a "Hard Drive Only" version of the WD
1002-05.  It supports hard drives exactly the same as the -05, but can't be

Fm: Chris Bergerson 72227,127
To: All

I'm looking for some suggestions...

I'm running OS9 level II on my Coco, and would like to monitor the status of a
voltage level as a background task, and periodically record the value of the
(binary) level to a log file.  I've written a program that almost works, but
there is a problem.  I have wired the signal to the left joystick X input.
Apparently, though, the returned value is valid only if I am in the calling
window.

Wiring the signal to the fire button won't work, of course, since if the signal
is true, the keyboard will be locked out for all other processes.

Most of my available ports are tied up.  I've got a hi-res interface tying up
the right joystick input and the casette I/O. The printer, of course, is
hogging T1.  I've got a MultiPak with slot 1 being a dual RS232 pak, slot 3 is
the HD adapter and slot 4 is the floppy controller.  I'd prefer to keep slot 2
open.

What can I wire my signal to, such that it will not conflict/ interfere with
other processes?  The output of my device is either 0.7V or about 5 volts.

What about using a bit of buffering circuitry (and possibly level reducing) and
using that cassette data input line? That's certainly unused under os9.

Also - you could get 'dirty' and write a program that interrogates the other
joystick input (using your OWN low level routines to manipulate the joystick
selector MUX and comparator - using the system's would obviously create the
problem you've encountered). Other possibilities include using unused lines on
one of the PIA's and hanging a wire out the back.

Pete

P.S. You could get some joystick tweaking code from the color basic rom
disassemblies, if you have the "UNRAVELLED" series. You'll need to be careful
to lock interrupts while you're manipulating any control registers and restore
things as you found them.

Thanks for the good suggestions, Pete.  Seems to me that there's also an unused
input to be found on the RGB connector.  I do like the idea, though, of writing
a non-system routine to look at one of the joystick buttons.

Best for use with Compuserve is Sterm version 1.3. Handles BPlus protocol,
which is optimal for file xfers here. Also manages X modem, and possibly
another.

For the minimalist, Xcom9 is best. Fast, small, and handles Xmodem.

I doubt you'll get more than 2400 baud service out of a coco3 running os9/LII.
Interrupt response time, buffering problems, and inherent limitations of the
hardware require special attention and adjustment to get any faster.

The last measure has only the first eigth note showing. After that, there is
only rests to fill the last measure. All you need to do is add a end bar. Yes,
I was asking Wayne to change the message to read that the entire score was
there, only the bar was missing. He replied to me that all I need to do is do a
Bro to the file and reply CHA to change the descript message. Interesting,
Compuserve dosen't tell us how to change a file message once it's uploaded, but
Wayne did. Might make note of this if you want to change file upload messages.

Hello all, I have a hardware/soldering type question. I just acquired the
satellite upgrade baord for the multipak. The wires on that thing are really
thin.  Question is, do I have to strip the ends a bit before soldering? If yes,
is there a recommended procedure other than wire cutters/strippers? I think
wire strippers would just break the wires since they're so delicate.

This will be my first hardware "hacking" other than creating myself an rs232
cable and installing the 512K upgrade.

You could just use the blades of a pair of dikes (diagonal cutters) or even a

little wire wrap tools.

Hugo,
   If you have an enamel coated wire, one way to strip them is with some
sandpaper. You could use a knife too scrape a little test spot on one of the
ends, too see if it is just an enamel coating or not.

Hugo,
    Yea, sandpaper works pretty good on enameled wires, you don't run the
chance of nicking the wires. Another process I have used is to run the wire
through the flame of a match or lighter. This will burn the insulation off,
leaving a charred residue on the wire that can be easily removed.
    I only do the flame trick as a last resort because I don't know if heating
the wire up like that weakens it or makes it brittle.
    Maybe someone with more or a metallurgy background would know for sure.

RE: using the flame method.....I learned about using flame to get insulation
off wires in the army setting up commo equipment.  As a matter of fact, its the
only method I use cause its so easy.  You just have to make sure that the flame
doesn't stay on the wire too long (ie about 3 sec) or else some of the metal
might lose some of its conducting capability.  A good way to be careful is to
watch the insulation.  As soon as it starts to melt, that is long enough.  The
insulation can then be easily pulled off the wire. --Dave

David,
   I have to agree that if it is done carefully the flame method is in some
cases much better. A very slight nick in a vibration prone wire will cause more
problems then the damage that might be done to the wire by heating it.

Keep in mind that any MV window has at least a one character border all the way

As far as the termcap.l stuff, the biggest thing that changes is that if you
don't allocate a buffer for the tgetent() function, you may use a NULL and a
buffer will be auto-allocated for you. I used it this way for convenience, but
there may be some memory allocation bugs. Simmy Turner took to just allocating
the buffers manually.

As far as the ttytype file, see the 'update' command, if it's here. My 6809
stuff is offline, but I could get to it if you have no other paths.
Essentially, the ttytype file looks like this:

  [+|-|@]devname crttype

There may be multiple lines, one per device. The syntax is:

  + = enabled local terminal
  @ = enabled modem based terminal
  - = disabled terminal

..WHOOPS! I just realized I'm combining two descriptions here! One is the
'ttylist' file associated with Mtsmon, and the other is ttytype.. sorry! The
layout is just:

 /devname  crt_type
 /t2 vt100
 /w1 coco3
 /t3 wyse50

etc.

The file may be in /dd/sys or /r0/sys (latter is faster), and is manipulated
with a utility I called 'ttyset', which should be in DL9.

Sorry about the confusion, and toggle me if you need to be further confused!

    Kevin,
          Have been trying to get a copy of your book "Inside OS9
     Level II". Microcom said it was out of print when I called and
     to try at a later date. I called back a month later and was
     told that they have a lot of requests for this book but they
     still don't have any. Know of another source?

     Was reading the message string about tsmon and saw that you
  require a different driver SACIA instead of ACIAPAK. Where can
  I get this?
     Also, here is what I want to do; I have an IBM compatible in
  another room which I want to hook to my Coco3 via the RS232 ports.
  I have a multipack with an RS232pak connected to a modem and will
  get another RS232pak for this remote terminal.
     Is it possible with a configuration like this to somehow
  pipeline the modem through OS9 and out to the remote terminal
  where the remote can do an X-modem download at 2400 baud using its
  own program timing?
     When using tsmon with a IBM PC on the other end, what keys
  generate an escape in OS9 ?
     Hope you can help with this,
                                    Thanks,
                                      Paul

Paul,
  You'll find the SACIA driver in my esw110.ar package, available here on CIS
in this forum's CoCo OS-9 data library.  You can hook your CoCo up to a PC,
but you will need to modify the 2nd RS-232 Pak to work at a different address,
even though the two RS-232 Paks are plugged into different MPI slots.  There
is a text file that describes how to do this, but I don't know where it is or
what it is called... maybe BRO/KEY:RS232 in the appropriate LIBs will turn it
up.
  You may also want to install the "MPI IRQ Hack" to allow both RS-232 Paks to
be IRQ driven.  The "MPI IRQ Hack" is described in the manual in esw110.ar, as
well as in other files available for DL here.
  If you're using a serial port descriptor that is set up with "standard" OS-9
values, you'll find that the PC's Esc is CONTROL-BREAK (ESCAPE), Ctrl-E is
BREAK, and Ctrl-C is SHIFT-BREAK.

I used to do that when I had the Gimix hooked up. I had 6 terminals and 2
modems connected. I also had a PC in the studio, attached by serial line to the
Gimix. I'd log into the gimix using Procomm to make the PC look like a VT100,
and then use Sterm on the gimix to dial into cis. I'd use Kermit to transfer
files between the two boxes.

You could probably also write a very simple pass-thru utility, but it gets
complicated when you try to figure out how to pass out of band information,
like how to disconnect, for example.

Mark,

    I downloaded your LogIn utilities and am having some problems setting it
up.  My problem is with the ADDUSER utility.  When I run it it accesses /dd for
a moment then asks for the username and UID.  After answering the prompts, it
reports "adding new user ..." and then ends (I'm back to the shell). I gathered
from the docs that it was supposed to create the necessary files and generally
"set things up".  Do I need to create any files/directories before running
ADDUSER?

At 160 feet you may run into problems.  The RS-232 standard says no more than
fifty feet--this constraint is present because if a serial device puts out a
signal that is just within specs, past that distance it isn't usable.  A place
I used to work had trouble with that once: we had terminals hooked up over a
distance of fifty feet or a bit over, and they worked just fine, but a lab
instrument with RS-232 out was flaky.  A friend with more hardware knowledge
than me or my boss hooked up an oscilloscope, and one could see very easily the
effects of cable capacitance and resistance.  Smoothed that signal right out
into mush.

One can get special low-capacitance cable for longer serial runs, though I
don't recall how far one can go with it.

While the serial spec (well, RS-232C) states a maximum length of 50 feet, I
regularly get away with many times that. Had runs in my old house that were in
excess of 200 feet, and I have been to sites where customers run lines
approaching 1000 feet.

Hi, all.
 I am seeking advice about a keyboard I plan to buy my wife. She wants to learn
to play piano, and I thought an electronic keyboard would be a good way to let
both of us see how serious we are. I have only $500 budgeted. Do you guys have
any suggestions?

 Thanks!

Some questions back at you:

Do you want it to be MIDI capable? (highly recommended, and most are)

Do you want full sized keys? (also recommended)

Do you want it to be multi-timbral (be able to play many instruments at once,
i.e. piano, flute, drums, etc.)?

Best bet would be to get something on the lines of a Roland D5 or D10, or
possibly a Kawai K1 or K1-II. The used market has the K1's at under $450
frequently, the D5 may also be near that point (discounted) new.

Two suggestions:

a) Check out the local for sale rags... we have the Recycler here in LA, and
have 4-5 PAGES each week of used musical equipment for sale, mostly priced
aggressively.

b) Type GO MAO (Music Alley Online...a music store here on CIS) and leave a
note for Jamie Robertson. Lots of folks have bought (new) stuff from Jamie at
incredible prices (self included). He's also very friendly, and helpful.
Telling what you're looking for, and what your dollar cap is, and I'm sure he
can provide some suggestions. He's very well thought of on both the MIDI Forum
and on USENET's rec.music.synth group.

Also, pop over to the MIDI Forum and ask questions. Very active forum over
there, and probably every piece of musical gear available has passed through
_somebody's_ hands over there. You'll get the straight skinny on what performs
well, and what doesn't.

Lastly - worst thing you can do is walk into your local music store
uninitiated... The prices posted are fictitious. There's list price, the posted
price, and then there's what the dealer will REALLY sell it for (typically
20-30% below list, sometimes lower). Have your facts together, your reviews
read, and know what the going prices are (approximately). If you have a
reasonable music dealer, he'll come to know you andwill give you the discounted
price w/o asking once you're a regular.
