thanx for the advice Dave!  I'll be looking forward to hearing from you on your
OS-9000 experience.  By the way, what is RAVE?  I have sent Microware mail
asking for them to mail me info to work and I haven't seen a thing for three
weeks!  I'm curious to know what you paid for OS-9000 for the 386 if you don't
mind.  One final question,  are you getting OS-9000 for screwing around at home
or are you considering using it for robotics?

Once again thanx for your reply...

William, I WAS planning on using OS-9000 for use in talking to the GM MAP
network (their world-wide factory network) by writing a driver,  but <gulp!> my
company just announced that they are just about to go under and... well, I
jumped ship and am starting work with a NEW company in a week which does
military work. I may still do that MAP network stuff for GM though, but on a
contract basis directly with GM. In the meantime, I'll be using OS-9000 at home
for my own computing pleasure.

I got the full-blown "PRO" version, which sells for $995 directly from
Microware. The RAVE "DevPak" is another $750.

By the way, RAVE stands for "Real-Time Audio/Video Environment" and provides a
very elaborate set of tools for developing real time applications which use
sound and/or graphics.

Now for the down side: The present releases for PC/OS-9000 and RAVE require a
very specific hardware configuration for your PC. First of all, your maching
MUST be a 386 or 486 and have more than 640K of RAM. You MUST have at least one
hard drive with a decent amount of free space on it. If your hard drive is
SCSI, your controller card MUST be an Adaptek #1540. If you plan on ever
running RAVE, your system MUST have an ATI VGA Wonder card with 512K of video
RAM. And although the VGA Wonder+ card has a mouse port and comes with a bus
mouse, you cannot use it. Instead, you must have a SERIAL mouse connected to
COM1: or COM2: (Microware recommends the Logitech 3-button serial mouse for
best results). Presently, PC/OS-9000/RAVE does not support any sound cards, but
rumour has it that a driver for the Creative Labs' Sound Blaster card is
forthcoming.

I thought I had all of the above basis covered when I bought my machine, but
alas, I wasn't aware of the Adaptek SCSI requirement and ended up with a card
by Always Technology. I'm now trying to sell it back to my dealer so I can but
the Adaptec. <sigh!>

So so far, although I've had the stuff since last Friday, I still can't install
it on my machine.  <Dave Kaleita>

Sorry to hear of your configuration woes david!  I'm primarily interested in
using os-9000 in an embedded environment.  I'm sure I will need to develop on
an os-9000 PC so your configuration problems are good things to know up front.

Sorry about the job folding up, but I hope you'll keep me informed of your
OS-9000 progress.  I have a bunch of hard heads in my company that believe that
only through a bare kernel can a programmer achieve oneness with the universe. 
Forget the fact that they spend man years redeveloping the wheel, it's the
journey not the destination that thrills these masochists.  I'm hoping to get
as much info on full featured OS's like os-9000 so I can take some of the wind
out of their sails.

Keep me updated and good luck with your job and your OS-9000 system!

I have a little bit of good news, if it holds up!  Someone has bothered to help
us make a Std MIDI File format converter based on the program he wrote for CP/M
on the Commodore Adam computers, written in "Small C" with some assembler for
speed and efficiency (I wonder why :-).  He's on CIS and I'll be checking once
in a while for something in my in-basket.  They've had such a program for some
time it turns out.  Everyone else seems to be keeping it a secret, cuz I have
asked 'til I'm blue in the face (*not* a reflection of the blue OS9 window I am
logged on with! :-).

Well, being the "realist" that I am -- "realistically pessemistic" -- I'm still
going to prepare myself to reinvent the wheel ONCE AGAIN <alas/*ahem*>. I am
uploading another article that requires all the expertises anyone here can
muster-up.

The help I need is OS9-specific and not really MIDI-specific at all.  I'm
thinking we can spawn subtasks that'd run copies of the same subroutine,
passing back SMF chunks of MIDI info inside the Format-1 tracks to the main
task for deciding how to sort the tracks together into a CMF output file.

I'm going to attempt a text drawing of what I mean and upload it.  If you can
help me, please download it.  It'll probably be too big to fit in a forum
message for CIS but maybe on Delphi it'd fit, eh?  I'll put it up on both, so
don't think you're seeing double!  Again it'll be for personal use only and I
again will thank you beforehand for your trouble in helping me!

I guess I'll call this article something like MF1TO0.ART for "MIDIfile Format-1
to -0 Article".  Please look for it.  I do hope the CP/M C sources will do the
job, but just in case it doesn't, this article will tell enough of what we'd
like to attempt to do.  Kinda new territory here.

If we can get this done, the *only* thing we have left to gripe about is that
we can't undo LHARC'd files, and some other formats like SIT, ZOO, etc., to get
access to SMFs around the world.

Pete,
 Thanks for your quick reply! To some extent, I'm not sure what I'm looking for
<g>. I want something that she can learn piano on for awhile. I don't know if
she needs all 88 keys at first. I *do* know that full-sized keys are a must. I
could hook her up to my CoCo if we had Midi, which would win me points to keep
the sloppy-looking thing running!

 I would rather have midi than multi-timbral if one of the voice(s) it did was
a reasonable piano. Her sister plays a Roland that has pressure-sensitive keys
like the Clavinovas, but maybe that isn't necessary (is it?).
 Do all Rolands do that (I mean where, the harder she hits the key, the louder
it is)? Her sister's has pedals. Will she be able to practice piano without
them?
 To quote - "I'm so confused!".
 I will go mao and ask over there like you suggested. Thanks for the tip.
 I heard you about the music stores. I feel like I'm in a car dealership in
there (some of the prices help lend the aura).
 When I get something, I will be asking even more here trying to get my CoCo
midi-ized!

Many of the keyboards include a piano-esque sound. Usually, the higher the $$$,
the better the approximation (grin). The rolands have piano sounds, although
nobody will confuse them with a Steinway or Borsendorfer (sp?).

Most present day midi keyboards offer velocity sensitivity. That is, the timbre
of the sound is affected by how hard (fast) you strike the keys. I believe the
Kawai also supports 'aftertouch', which allows you to press extra hard on the
key to cause some kind of (user specifiable) modulation (frequently vibrato,
pitch bend, etc.)..

In both cases (Roland D5, Kawai KI-II) you will probably get all that you need
for close to your price point (after discounting, of course).

Prepare to enter a long and expensive downward spiral...

No problem.....

BTW - there are LOTS of devices out there that are MIDI capable, and have
weighted, wooden keys. These are typically higher end units, and many of them
produce no sounds at all (just MIDI output). They're called keyboard
controllers. Probably the most popular of these is the Yamaha KX-88. It can
(occasionally) be found at around $1200 (discounted).

BTW - getting married soon, eh? I may be also finally breaking down.. looking

I looked last night at a music store here. The salesman wanted to direct me
toward a Casio that they had on sale for $430. I didn't bite, as no one has
recommended them. Besides, there is a Kawai Spectra for not much more than that
at Music Alley and they appeared to be built a little more ruggedly. Who knows?

Big advice here: stick with a mainstream model, as best you can. Reasons
include:

   a) Support - in terms of editor or librarian software, 3rd party
      sounds, hints/tips from others how to operate it best, etc.

   b) Resale - If/when you decide to sell it, selling an obscure maker
      or model is very tough. Selling a well known/supported one
      is relatively easy.

Casio's are neat, but they usually fall into the 'home' or 'amateur' catagories
(I know... I've had two of them), and I haven't heard of te
. er .. the Spectra. I'd push back in the direction of a D5 (Roland) or K1
(Kawaii) if I were in your shoes. The latter is VERY well supported, largely
becaue Kawaii hit a good price point, and a lot of people who wanted a
'serious' synth for lower pricing bought into it. As a result, a lot of the 3rd
parties make sounds for it. D5's are also fairly well supported in that they
can use the same patches & tones as the D10/D20/D110.

Pete,
 Well, I spent all day Saturday with a (young) friend who is also quite a good
keyboardist. We found that the K1 and D5 are (just barely) out of my price
range new (around $550.00).
 The one possibly interesting thing I found was a Casio VZ-1 for $430 that
supposedly lists for $1150 (at Sam Ash). My friend liked it a lot better than
the Kawaii Spectra ($600 at Sam Ash, $500 elswhere) because it had a greater
variety of sounds, but agreed that the Kawaii was likely a better quality
keyboard. The Casio is also easily 3 times as big as the Kawaii, which is only
about half again as deep as the keys themselves. Are you familiar with this
model Casio? Is it likely to be better built than other Casios (shoot, it
*says* "Professional" right there on the front of it! <g>)?
 We've got less than 3 weeks 'til 'M-Day!! (Believe it or not, no, I am not
getting nervous!)

The next statement will bring grimaces from Casio owners, but the stigma of
'toy' is pretty much affixed to most Casio stuff, however unfair. The VZ-1 and
FZ-10 were pro gear, and are reputed to be excellent units. Casio (I'm guessing
here) seems to have dropped out of the pro gear arena, and the result is blow
out prices.

Bottom line: if you really like it, and it fits your price plan, grab it. I
believe that is a multi-timbral unit. I also hear that it has some of the same
characteristics sound wise as the FM synths (aka Yamaha).

Pete,
 Well, I went for the new Kawai Spectra (KC-110). It looked like it might last
awhile, and I just wondered about buying something that was as discounted as
much as the VZ-1 was. One of our new neighbors in our apartment building has
(and teaches piano on :)) a Korg ??? digital piano, so we may be in better
shape than I first thought.
 Now the hard part - *not* taking it out of the box and playing with it myself
before I give it to Laura!!
 So ....... what do I need to get to Midi-ize my CoCo<g>?

Best bet for COCO & MIDI is to get to Rulaford Systems (Associates)... They
sell a MIDI pak for $75 +/-, and they probably also sell Lester Hands' LYRA
(Notation) and possibly CM3 (a sequencer.. a digital record & playback
capability w/ multiple tracks).

If you're running undfer OS9 LII, then the Ultimuse program by Mike Knudsen is
probably the best (for Notation... no sequencer exists for LII).

The Korg folks make a REAL nice piano... The Korg SG-1D was the first MIDIable
piano I ever heard that sounded and felt like a real grand piano. You have a
lot of options in the ~1500-2000 range with respect to decent MIDI pianos.

Hi Mark, I've been interested in watching your search for the right musical
MIDI instrument.  I "play" the computer keyboard pretty well but can only pick
out Chopsticks on a piano keyboard.  I do enjoy music and have really enjoyed
transcribing sheet music and then "arranging" the set of musical instruments to
play the tune.  I've used both LYRA and UltiMusE (UME) extensively and enjoy
them both.  LYRA permits sending messages along with musical notes to the
synthesizer to reset the selection of voices, allow "bending" of notes, etc.
while UME has a somewhat easier-to-use note entry scheme.  As Pete told you,
UME works out of OS9 while LYRA works out of Radio Shack Basic.  LYRA was
written by Lester Hands who now sells the product from MusicWare, Hamlet Route
1261, Seaside, OR 97138 (tel 503738-0119).  Mike Knudsen's UME can be obtained
from Second City Software, P.O. Box 72956, Roselle, IL 60172 (tel
708-653-5610).  Both Les and Mike drop in here occasionally; Les has CIS ID
70135,430 and Mike has CIS id 72467,1111.  Regards, Ches.

Hiya.  I own a Clavinova (lovely instrument, though out of the price range in
question)--it has what you're talking about (called "velocity sensitivity"). I
don't know whether the Rolands have it--it does add to the cost of a keyboard.
(The Clavinova has two switches per key, arranged so that one closes first,
then the other.  The time between the two closings indicates the velocity. 
Adding that kind of hardware to determine velocity is what increases the cost.)
But...if you're wanting to learn piano technique, I would think that velocity
sensitivity is important.

James,
 Since we have a small 1-bedroom apartment (North NJ real estate prices), if
she gets real serious, a Clavinova is probably what we'll end up with instead
of a full-sized piano. I was really impressed with the feel and sound

of the ones I looked at, but it is more than I should spend 3 weeks before
getting married. (Actually, so is $500, but, oh, well!)
 Her sister's Roland has it, and Pete says most keyboards anymore have it these
days. It's easy enough to test!

I don't know about your wife but my two girls insist that the only instrument
fit to learn piano on is a PIANO.  ( A real one full of wires and hammers and
such like bits.  Perhaps a well used second hand piano would be the ticket. It
is very difficult to find an electronic instrument which has the touch of the
real thing.  Me - I love the flexibility of a MIDI but then I am not a
musician.  To get an electronic instrument capable of a GOOD piano sound will
run way!! over your budget. Caveat Emptor. free advice from me is worth what

Well, I tried an overlay with a MV window in it with the menu bar and scroll
bars.  The menus worked just fine, but the menu id number was returned as 0
when I clicked on the scroll arrows.

I was able to get an overlay with menu also, but I have the same problem. The

Here's something you might try.  On the overlay, use the ScSize syscall to get
the size of the overlay.  Then, when the mouse is clicked, check to see if the
pointer is over where the scroll arrows would be.

Zack,

I just downloaded your files concerning installing RS games on Multi-Vue. Right
now, I'm asking about FS2MV.AR, putting Flight Simulator 2 on Multi-Vue!

I set everything up exactly as described on fs2.doc. What happens is the icon
is perfect and the caption reads fs2. When I doubleclick on the icon, it starts
to load something, the screen changes to an all-blue background with a white
cursor (looks like 40 column) for about 3 seconds. Then the gshell screen comes
right back as if nothing had happened (right back to MV again).

What could be the problem? I'm new to this Multi-Vue stuff, and so far I'm
finding it real interesting (and a little frustrating :-)) Any help would be
gratefully received!!!!!!

Thanx,

 Bob

As the documentaion file states, once the screen returns to GShell, you must
CLEAR over to the window which will be running Flight Sim. Currently, GShell
cannot fork a VDG-based application directly. My program does the next best
thing, allows you to start the VDG-based app from an ICON OSN double click, but
unforch, you MUST CLEAR to the window which will be running the VDG-based app.

Boy Zack,

Are you a tough man to reach!! :-)  Must be busy with some of that new 68000
stuff, eh?

I understood in your docs about CLEARing to the VDG screen for FS.
Unfortunately, it doesn't work. Apparently, for some reason, that new VDG
screen is NOT established or FS is looking for something that isn't there.
Kevin gave me a hint to check my Init file, so I'm heading there first.
Hopefully, that'll do it!

Thanks for getting back to me!

Next thing to check is to make sure you have VDGInt in your OS9Boot file. To
support VDG type windows, you must have VDGInt.

The INIT file was the problem. I changed it as Kevin told me, and it now works
perfectly. I was getting a little discouraged in that I followed your docs to
the letter, and it still didn't work. I NEVER would have known about that INIT
file without some help. When you write your docs, please remember to explain

The problem was in the INIT module of the OS9Boot file. I had to change the
byte value at offset $0C from $0F to $0C. Something about a polling table &
IRQ's.

That is something I have never heard about. Somehow, my INIT module does

I will include a note about that in a special readme file on all subsequent

      An enlightening file. In it is mentioned that after modifying an RS232pak
you can use one with ACIAPAK in slot 1 and one with MODPAK in slI can't use
ACIAPAK for both? Right now I have a Modempak and an RS232pak with only the

getting error 102 (Bus Trap).  I'm pretty sure it's a stray pointer, but
tracking it down is not very easy.

Mike:
        I don't use LHarc much except to unpack FidoNews.  I only use Zoo or
compressed tar files, since they are most widely available.  Since I don't deal
much with MS-DOS systems (only FidoNet nodes and FidoNet stuff - NODEDIFFs and
FidoNews), I don't feel any need to use these "poorly" designed MS-DOS
archivers.  I also have little desire to bother with the ultimate in
compression. Worrying about saving a few bytes here and there is not worth
hasseling with non-portable code.  I only bothered with UnZip so I could get at
some source code some MS-DOS people ZIP'ed...

        I didn't get a chance to read your message until late Sunday night. I
only call CIS on the weekend.  I snarfed the UnZip code from BIX's unix
listings. I did a quick & dirty port - sort of the pound to fit.  I think I did
things like delete the code to update the file attrs rather than try to put in
OSK code to handle it (I didn't care about preserving file dates, etc.) and I
didn't even look to see if unzip dealt with text file handling (i.e. fixing
MS-DOS's CRLF's to UNIX's LFs or OSK CR's) - since I have a program to converts
between text file formats this was an unneeded feature.

        CompuServ's file xfer is also very slow (I only have an XModem/checksum
program) - seems to have very large packet turn-around delays.  CompuServ's
"local" number is also a long distance phone call, so I really don't want to
stay on too long.  The best thing is this:  I can put my UnZIP code onto a
Universal Format 3.5" floppy and send it via Snail Mail.
                        Robert

One final report regarding my experience with your autobaud tsmon.

1. It just doesn't work, at all.
2. My Mpak is now upgraded, it works fine, the software clock doesn't
   go nuts during rs232 transmissions anymore.
3. I tried both a DCD/DSR swapped cable and a regular cable and I
   always made sure to get the XTP settings right.
4. I tried TSMON alone (wait for CR) and with an init file.
5. With the swapped cable, the modem would answer, but as soon as
   a connection was made, it hung up.  I etting modem register S25 to 25 or more but
   it didn't make a difference.
6. With a regular cable, the connection would be made, but login
   was never initiated, even running TSMON without an il
ito as c mb.kSNwc osfe uuftneyds'

~ Hugo,
  Well, I don't know what is wrong... I know my tsmon works for me, with and
without the init file.  If tsmon doesn't work for you even in the "dumb" mode
(no init file), then the only thing I can think of is the wrong driver is being
used.
  Using the xmode utility supplied with the "esw110.ar" package, check the T2
descriptor you're using to see whether SACIA or ACIAPAK is the driver.  If you
have both SACIA and ACIAPAK in your boot file, and the T2 module is for
ACIAPAK, then there's no way my tsmon will work.  Just grasping at straws here
now...

Frank -

When you use config, are you specifying that you want the 40 and 80 track
drives that have DS (double sides). Also, in those disk descriptors, is the
number of sides set up to 2?

If you don't have it, grab the 'dmode' utility here in either DL9 or DL10.
It'll tell you (and us) a lot about your disk setup.

the cable (and pins in the connectors) are in place then all you need to do is
build a boot disk with the descriptors for 40 track double sided disks. You do
not have 80 track capable drives if you have been running RSDOS on them.  Here
I have 2 40 track and 1 80 track 2 siders.  The 80 track is a 5 1/4 some days
and a 3 1/2 on others.  Have not gotten around to making one or the other
permanent and the 3 1/2 will probably see very little use until I move to OSK.
For downloading - no problem in OS9 or RSDOS or even MSDOS so long as you have
the software to swap files from one format to another.  Several programs here
to do that.

FRank -

Depends... if you have an OS9 terminal program that will download (such as
Sterm or Xcom9), then you're miles ahead. If you only have RS-DOS stuff, then
you can use a program called DOSOR9 in DL10 to get it from RSDOS disk to OS9
disk.

Additionally, you may need the 'ar.doc' and 'ar09.bin' files in DL9. These
allow os9 'ar'chives to be decompressed and unpacked.

Hi!

I  have been tinkering with an experimental interpreter (written
in  C) of an object-oriented "Forth-like" language I call  "XX".
It  now  only  handles longs and doubles.  In checking  out  the
arithmetic operators, I found the following anomaly:

                -100 / -5 = -20   ???

Here is a sample program to prove my point:

                    /* Module:  testlong.c */
                    #include <stdio.h>

                    main()
                    {
                        long x,y,q;

                        x = -100L;
                        y =   -5L;
                        q = x/y;
                        pflinit();
                        printf("x/y=%ld/%ld=%ld\n",x,y,q);
                    }

The printed result is:

                        x/y=-100/-5=-20

Is  this a compiler bug, or am I missing something about integer
division?

What would be the best solution to work arounr it?

                    if (x<0L && y<0L)
                         q = -x/y;
                    else q =  x/y;

Maybe?


Thanks, Bob.

Paul, I am really enjoying your MFCONV and MFPLAY software!  Pulled an MFF1
file of Roseleaf Rag (the smaller of two files on the MIDI forum) and found
that the first track just sets parameters and the second track is the music so
MFCONV/MFPLAY works fine on it and it is a mighty pretty Joplin rag.  Also
pulled the Cathy file off MIDI and found that the last three of four tunes are
in MFF0 format so they work well and sound absolutely delightful (for those of
us who like Irish music anyway). The PolySoft stuff sounds marvelous; please
share more info on that source. Is it a company that makes a business of
selling music in MIDI format? What is full address etc.?  And the four
Impromptus are also great, both as straight piano pieces and with various
instruments chosen for some of the channels.  Please identify IEMUG for me. 
Thanks for your efforts and good luck in your search for MFF1 to MFF0 tools and
better timers.  Highest regards, Ches.

Hi Ches,

Yes I was thinking some of those MFF1s will actually work with this software.
Many of them, though, have Tempo Maps as that first track which we wouldn't be
able to honor while you're "playing" the second track.  Those kinds of first
tracks, also, would develop a kind of huge pause before the music would start
playing.  And remember we have a designed-in bug in-between the tracks, where
that correction factor thinks it is "off" at the start of the next track (other
than the first) by exactly the tick-count of the previous accumulator.  That
sticks a value into the correction factor that is the two's compliment of the
cumulation up to that point (if there was a real tempo change somewhere in the
previous track) or it'd be exactly the two's compliment of the "time" of the
entire previous track!  Sorry, but if that is happening, I did mention that bug
will stay there until we have a MFF1-to-MFF0 converter.

Ok PolySoft I think has a "private" SIG on GEnie.  Gotta be a member (yeah I am
not one).  All I have is the readme file from them that says to give their
toll-free number a call:  1-800-777-8010.  I think they are really a MIDI music
shop and are doing these scores/files on the side.  They must have access to
some right-fancy software & hardware if they've been able to figure out how to
deal with those MT-32 timbre settings!  Sorry 'bout not putting that info into
our archive.

IEMUG means "Internation Electronic Music Users Group" and is a Fido-based
network started by John Fordenbacher right here in Okla.City.  Maybe, maybe
he'll still have his node on-line, but I think he's changed his node to the
"Christian Music Network".  His BBS # is 1-405-733-3102 and tell him I sent ya
to ask him about IEMUG & where you can call in your own area to pull a listing
& place a "FReq" (File Request).  Access *will* cost probably around $25/year,
but you pay this to your own area's IEMUG Sysop, not to John (I think).

(Btw I was hoping Ron Bihler's RiBBS would be stable enough so I could become
an IEMUG node; but alas the Fido officers here won't let me pipe in any
National Echos cuz of the way Ron is doing things.  There are other problems,
too, such as how Ron has named his modules the same as other
commercially-bought software packages I have.  Take note you software authors:
this SEVERELY LIMITS the multitasking capabilities of ANY such system!  [This
is why I chose "MF" as a prefix for these SMF routines, hint hint.]  So I've
just about ditched running my BBS.  Absolutely no other BBS package for
CoCo/RSDOS or OS9/6809/68000/etc. can do Fido -- NONE of them.  Are there MIDI
networks on Usenet, I wonder?  Maybe we could use Rick Adam's port of UUCP.)

Sorry ... I don't mean to be this way on a Reply.  Hopefully some of the big
dudes will read this and realize I pre-bought my CoCo3 several months before
Radio Shack started delivering them to the stores.  Going on 4 or 5 years ago
now!  (I bought 2 more since then mostly as "spare parts", and one got zapped
already.)  I can still find my original copies of OS9 v1.0.1 & v2.0.0 (and
their books -- btw they don't have the info I need for the ACIA driver or the
TMR project).  I have a friend's original 64k-upgraded Grey-cased CoCo1 I sold
him (I need to put a keyboard on it for him).  I've recently added ANOTHER
40-meg drive to the B&B interface! (was hoping I could get RiBBS going again.)
What I'm saying is I've been staunchly supportive of OS9 ever since I can
remember and have many old issues of Rainbow to boot.  Nothing in these last
several years have shown me that anything is going to change, nothing to let me
believe we're EVER going to be part of the world out there.  So I'm holding on
to what I have, pray that it won't break down, and also pray that I won't be
the only one left with a 6809!

Oh well, let me cool off a bit, and I'll look at the MFF1-to-0 code some more!

I am having problems with my modem, a BSR Model. It is Hayes Compatable. It

I am having problmes is when I try to use other programs to access the /T2
port. For example, I have attempted to send ATDTPhone# strings to my modem and
nothing happens. I have also had the same problem with a dialer program PFV2 (I
think it is on CIS, if not I will upload it after I check.) What do I need to
do to initialize the modem port? I use a Tandy RS232 Pak and I have /term /t1
and /t2 in my boot file. As I said it works with Osterm and has worked under
RSDOS with Ultimaterm 4.0 so I know that the modem is ok. Is there something
that those programs do that I should include? Thank you for any and all help.

Joerg - sure, altho you have to hardcode the window number:

 xmode /w5 type=1
 shell <>>>/w5&

Or the like.  The "xmode type=1" tells cc3io that this is a vdg device. You can
have more than one.  Notice that all real window descriptors have type=80, btw.

I bet there are some vdg descriptors in lib 10 here somewhere.  Some people
have made /v1 /v2 /v3 etc descriptors just for fun, y'see.

Some good news!  With a fellow CIS chap by the name of Chris Braymen, I am now
working on a MFF1-to-MFF0 converter.  He's done it in a "Small C" way where
Long Ints he deals with in #asm-imbedded code for CP/M machines (uh I think
it's only Intel 8080 code; sorta close to TRS-80's Z80 CPU so I *think* I know
what's going on!)  Anyway I'm going to test what I hope is the correct C Long
Int code very shortly (might even log back on to CIS this weekend!).  Chris
does it via reading into RAM the entire file and uses char-array pointers to
keep account of where he's at in the (simultaneous) MFF1 tracks.  (We are doing
E-mail to figure his code out, cuz Chris now has a C compiler that supports
Long Ints.)

If this works (and if OS9 & MW C works good enough this way even with huge MFF1
files), I'll not need that much help on the article I wrote that asks y'all to
help me with a multitasking version of this converter program.  But that
article *might* still be a viable project at any rate -- I know of many SMFs
that probably won't fit inside #56k data area size (if we can keep Chris' code
below 8k!).

So please do keep on with the feedback -- I need every byte I can get!

controllers. Anyone who is using such a setup, I would like to hear from you.
(Boy that is terrible grammar) I would like to buy a hard drive at Rainbowfest
next month. I would like to have a 40track double-sided floppy with a hard
drive, if that makes any differece. I have DISTO's 4-in-1 board in my
supercontroller 2. Could anyone recommend a Hard Disk (scsi compatable)? Would
an Seagate 225N with controller work? Or do I have to have a seperate
controller. I hope to be able to buy one at Rainbowfest next month, so any
vendors out there or people with hardware to sell, plesa

Well...after looking around, and asking folks, I've settled on getting one of
the Quantum 105 Mbyte 3.5" SCSI drives.  Embedded controller, tiny little thing
(only 1" high), 15 ms average seek time, and $385 according to an ad in the
latest *Computer Shopper*.  (No doubt closer to $400 with shipping etc.)

That's what I hope to install on my MM/1 when it arrives.

Thank you for your response. I will start looking through the adds. I would
still like to hear what others are using. In fact I would like to see a
hardware survey of all users. For example: I have a COCO 3 with Disto 512k,
Multi-Pak, SC-2, 4-in-1 board, 2 FD-501 drives, 1200 baud modem CM-8 monitor,
and over 700 floppies of programs.

The registered version is just official.. nothing different ('cept the Info
screen doesn't have the sales pitch anymore <grin>).

Source code.. hmm.. well, I suppose I could.. it _is_ freeware, and I'm not
trying to make money off it (the $10 "registration" was more of a convenience
for people not wanting to download it, tho it has managed to put an extra $40
in my pocket..)  If there is enough demand for it I suppose I could upload the
source.  (Anyone?)

Brian I would like to modify the source so it inserts a 1 whwnever the call is
registered as long distance. I would also like to modify the dailer strings.
For some reason when I do the sort by name, the entries don't seem to get
sorted. I type in last name, comma, space, first name for ALL name entries. But
still it doesn't seem to sort them alphabetically. Maybe I shoule try
lastname_firstname ?? Even if you don't upload the source, could I send you a
disk and psotage to send it to me ? Thanx TC

Hehe.. PBook seems to be too smart for your own good.  You're supposed to type
in names as Firstname Last, ie Brian Stretch.  PBook is smart enough to sort
alphabetically by the LAST WORD in the name string.  If you type Lastname,
First, you'll be sorting by first names.

You can already modify the dialer strings.. modem prefix and postfix can be
changed for each entry.

That help?

Your right. It was too smart for me. I'll have to reenter all the names over.
Neat idea on your @art. I would like the dialer strings to be the same for all
the entries, so I don't have to  enter them each time. If i do it once why
should I do it every time ? Waste of my time. There are other things I would
like to change to, but I need the source code. What do you say Brian ????????

I need some help with making windows that doesn't include GFX2. I was trying to
to make windows by using the method in the back of the OS9 Level II manual, OS9
Windowing System. I tried using PRINT chr$($1b)+chr$($22)+chr$($1)+chr$(etc...)
but didn't get the results that I wanted everytime. I wrote a little module
that recieved values in the INTEGER type and used them in a line that made them
CHR$(number). It worked sometimes and sometimes it didn't so I tried BYTE and
still got the same results. I had a similar problem when I tried setting the
PALETTE colors that way too. What I need to know is how am I supposed to do
that? Does the planets have to be aligned in the correct order or what? Or am I
just missing something? Thanks for the help in advance....

I think you're going to want to use PUT instead of PRINT.  You may be running
into the write vs. writeln problem.  (writeln, which is what I bet PRINT to an
SCF device will use, does some stuff that can interfere with windowing escape
sequences.)

Judging by the messages, you've already found that PUT works fine.  If one of
the standard paths is the window you're after, use it--if you want to open
another window, use the path number that OPEN gives you.

I've found that using the standard path #1 works real good. This program that I
am working on is downloads manager for RiBBS v2.0. It will maintain the
files.bbs and desc.bbs files. I use an indexing method to sort everything. It
works real well and is pretty quick. I hope to get it done soon. I'm putting
some finishing touchs to it to make it look good. Working on it in my spare
time sure does take forever it seems like! Thanks for the help

I've already got half of it done. This half will sort/setup the 'desc.bbs'
files in the RiBBS downloads areas. It has a mini built in type of
wordprocessor that has word wrap. I've had a couple of "Hey, we needed that!"
out of it so far. I found a need for that utility when I first started running
RiBBS back in May of 1990. I've been working on this ever since. It has been a
learning experience!

George,

As JJ mentioned, what's mainly happening to you is that the PRINT statement
does an edited write... in other words, CRs have LFs added and so on. Which
means chr$(13) or chr$(10) will add in extra data which messes you up.

The solution is to use unedited writes... with the PUT statement.  For example,
a procedure to change palettes might be:

 PROCEDURE setpal
 (* usage: RUN setpal(path,palettenumber,palettevalue)
 PARAM path,palnum,palval:INTEGER
 DIM esc(4):BYTE
 esc(1)=$1B
 esc(2)=$31
 esc(2)=palnum
 esc(3)=palval
 PUT #path,esc
 END

The "PUT #path,esc" sends out the 4 bytes composing the "esc" array without any
output editing.  Another example with two-byte values for moving the current
draw pointer might be:

 PROCEDURE setdptr
 (* usage: RUN setdptr(path,newx,newy)
 PARAM path,x,y:INTEGER
 DIM esc(6):BYTE
 esc(1)=$1B
 esc(2)=$40
 esc(3)=x/256
 esc(4)=land(x,$FF)
 esc(5)=y/256
 esc(6)=land(y,$FF)
 PUT #path,esc

The x/256 gets the high byte of an integer, the land(x,$FF) gets the low byte.
Yell if unclear. - kev

Hey, I tried how you said for making windows and worked!!! Instead of 'PUT'ing
the BYTE info to a prespecified path, I 'PUT' the info to path #1. One
question, Can I 'PUT' the info to pre-specifed path and if so, what do I 'OPEN'
the path as? e.g. OPEN #path,"SOME DEVICE NAME":WRITE/UPDATE etc....

Now if you want to get fancy (like have several "overlays" all of which are
active for input/output), then your only choices are to either fake the areas
yourself (with cwarea and/or cursor xy calls)... or to open another /w on top
of the current window.  That requires turning off window protect, and being
careful to not scroll the screen under visible screen areas which you don't
want screwed up.

Here's how I get Kyum-Gai to run in a Multi-Vue environment.  I've done the
same for King's Quest, Leisure Suit Larry and Life.  I did it as more or less
of a challenge, when I read or heard someone say that running VDG applications
in the Multi-Vue environment was pain.

Here's what the AIF.GAI file looks like:

 shell
 kyum.gai
 ICONS/icon.kyum.gai
 0
 7
 80
 24
 0
 1

It uses SHELL on the program line and the second line is where I put the
KYUM.GAI shell script.  The rest of the AIF can be just about anything that you
want it to be.  I just modified an AIF that was used to open a shell on an
80x24 4-color graphics window.

 1.  echo Modify W14 for VDG operations
 2.  xmode /W14 type=1
 3.  echo Initialize W14
 4.  iniz  /W14
 5.  echo Change Data Directory to Kyum.Gai
 6.  chd /dd/games/kyum.gai
 7.  (ninja <>>>/W14;deiniz w14)&

Lines 1, 3 and 5 simply display a canned message to the user indicating what
step of the script is ibout to be performed.

Line 2 changes the /W14 descriptor to be one that will work with VDGINT.

Line 4 initializes /W14 (read INIZ in OS-9 Manual for details)

Line 6 points the current working directory to /dd/games/kyum.gai.  All of the
files that are in the root directory of the distribution diskette are in this
directory.

Line 7 starts the program called NINJA.  When NINJA ends, the deiniz command
within this line will close the window that NINJA was using, and deallocate its
memory.

I just uploaded a file called AIFGAI.AR to Library 10.  It should be available
tomorrow.  AIFGAI.AR is a packet that includes the AIF, ICON and SHELL script
that I use to start Kyum-Gai in the Multi-Vue environment.

I figured out the method that I showed you, more or less, as a challenge.
Somebody in my local computer club was having the same trouble.  Then after I
got King's Quest, I figured out a way to crossover the barrier between
Multi-Vue and VDG screens.

Keith -

Parallel is usually much more restrictive than serial. Typically, parallel
should be 15 feet or so. You may get away with more, but probably not much
more.

LAN - sure, once it's defined/available.

You should not have much of a problem traveling 160 feet on serial signals. I
used a run close to 400' in my old house employing basic 6 conductor phone wire
(tan insualtion kind.. not even shielded).

Keith,
  Although I doubt it's applicable now...I'm getting little bits of info now
and then on LANs which run on a wireless type system. I believe one of the
companies is awaiting FCC approval on a frequency group (then, maybe they've
already received it)...but that probably will be something in use in the future
and would cure your "160 feet" problem.

You can translate from RS232 to a method that permits a longer haul, then
translate back to RS232.  There are a variety of short haul modems for that
kind of thing.  You could go from RS232 to a couple of twisted pair lines and
back to RS232 with some line drivers if you want to whip up something yourself.

The last entry in my password file is the program to fork. For most it's shell.

There was one login utility out there that kept a record of the date/time of

You're doing it right ... just leaving out a step. When you change a
description, you're dumpped into the EDIT editor ... and it pulls in a full
copy of the current description ... so you can actually EDIT it if you like.

Need to do a complete re-write? Type a  /P   on a blank line (inside the
editor) to display the first line, then type /d999  to delete the next 999
lines, then re-enter your description.

A /EX will save your changes and exit the editor.

either with RUN gfx2("FONTS,200,[font # from 04-25) , I also have tried : merge
/dd/sys/fonts/broadway;dispaly 1b 3a c8 06 <>>>/w1, and all I get is garbage,
which appears to be the code for the particular font listing to the screen. I
would like to be able to use the fonts in BASIC09 more then Shell Scripts,. How
do I do it? Thank you,

Jeremy - it sounds like you're doing the right thing... merge the font(s), then
select it with gfx2 or display 1b3a.  The broadway I have is C8 08, tho. Is the
window a gfx type window?

Offhand, hmmm. If you get garbage it may be because you had merged another font
on top of (the same group/bfn) one already in use.  When you select a font,
grfdrv stores a pointer to where it is in memory. Merging another with the same
group, or killing off that buffer and loading another, could change the data
without grfdrv being aware.  Does that make sense?  Kinda like switching disks
and confusing RBF as to the current directory spot.

So. Start from scratch, merge the fonts you want to try out, then open a gfx
window and try the font change again.  Should work okay.  Also, do you have the
"dump" command or "ded"?  You can look at the first few bytes of a font file to
see what the group/buffer is (altho you may know that).

I've been doing some playing with my coco serving as a terminal for my MM/1.
Using a disto rs232 in a no-halt controller (the rs232 is interupt driven via a
patch cable from the port to one of the leads on the disk controller (darned if
I can remember which one...).

So, what is the fastest, reliable baud I rate I can expect to use? Logging on
to the MM/1 with xcom9 or stem--no flow control & 4800 baud works perfectly;
with flow I can get 9600 to work pretty well; nothing seems to help 19200. Is
this normal? Would an rsdos program like ultimaterm (if I can get it to
recognize the disto pack) work better at the higher rates?

If you're gonna be using the CoCo for a terminal, expect 4800 baud to be the
best the screen can keep up with.

A good test to see where it will fail would be to list the 'u' log from the
forum (lots of small lines). It'll start falling all over itself very quickly
into the dump.

Steve.  We use 9600 baud with no problems.  Maybe I am reading something out of

Robert ...

If your application used some other screen driver than the stock CoCo, all bets
are off and speed of 9600 baud _may_ be possible.

I've been trying to run my CoCo 3 at 9600 baud (just got a new PPI 9600 baud
modem, and find that even tho I'm using a hardware serial port, my thoughput is
4800 baud. No amount of tweaking will let me cross that barrier.

And that's using a Wyse 50 tube hung off /t2.

If I were using the CoCo screen, I start to loose character at speeds just over
2400 baud. If I monkey with the receive buffers in my descriptors, I can push
it to 4800 baud.

Bob,  In this case We were using two coco II's with the bit banger port,
plugged into the rs232 ports on the superboard on a coco III.  The limiting
factor was 9600 baud from the bit banger ports and the program termix that we
were using to communicate back and forth.  The coco II were being used as
remote terminals to the coco III.  Note the 'were'; since I am now using two
1000EX's in the place of the coco II.  Even here, I am still limited to 9600
baud, since this is the fastest the serial boards for the EX's can go.  I have
used the Model IV rs232 port to the coco III at 19,200 baud with no problems.

I'm trying to write a no-frill terminal driver to be used in testing some
programs being written on the MM/1 on a coco acting as a terminal. As a start I
coded the following very "simple" program...

   #include <modes.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   main()
   {
      char databuff[300];
      int termpath, t;
      if(termpath=open("/t2",S_IREAD+S_IWRITE))<1) exit(errno));
      for(;;){
         if((t=_gs_rdy(0))>0){
            read(0,databuff,t);
            write(termpath,databuff,t);
         }
         if((t=_gs_rdy(termpath)>>0){
            read(termpath,databuff,t);
            write(1,databuff,t);
         }
      }
   }

Problem is, it just doesn't work. It terminates after a few characters are
sent/received. If I use sterm or xcom9 with the same setup all works fine. So I
assume that I have to some error checking when reading??? Any one already been
though this?

Kevin,

Thanx a MILLION for that program! It works great. Once I "customized it as you
said, I put "Sub Battle Simulator" on MV, and it is perfect. I want to put the
rest of my games on. Which brings me to another question, do you know of any
reason that I can't get Flight Simulator II to run with it? I tried the same
program you gave me and set it up the way I did for Sub (w/ the proper names,
of course) but it will come up in the AIF window and read: "starting fs" and
then &006 but about 3 seconds later it will go back to MV with NO new VDG
window established. I know that FS needs 2 special modules in the bootfile, FT
and FTDD. I have gen'd a new bootfile with those modules. I also have VDGInt,
of course.

Thanx again Kev, for letting me draw on your expertise!

Bob

Bob - can you start FS by hand?  If not, then besides the FT and FTDD modules,
make sure that your Init module was patched to allow more virqs (the old $0F to
$0C thingie at offset, what? $0F in Init?  You know the one).

I use OSTERM 2.08. I cannot get YMODEM to work properly on CIS. I am currently
set at 7-e-1 at 1200 baud. If I try YMODEM, everything freezes up. Sometimes
control-c will help, other times I have to disconnect. DOes YModem work on CIS
os9? Customer service suggested using 8-n-1 but for some reason it doesn't work
with OSTERM 2.08 on CIS. I have to change modem options. Please Help. Thankyou

I recall that OSTerm has a Ymodem Batch option and I've used it on CIS but not
lately. Have you tried Ymodem Batch? I think if you do you'll have better luck.
Don't worry about the 7-e-1 stuff. That's all handled under the hood.

I will try dl-ing something right now and see what happens. Thank you for your

other programs such as Phone Book Version 1.1 (PBOOK1.1) by Brian Stretch. I
cannot get it to work. It will not
 initialize my modem. The same is true if I try to send various commands to it
from a Basic09 program. I have ACIAPAK (It is the stock Tand y version) and
/t2. I have no idea what I am doing wrong. I use a Hayes compatable modem. A

~ The problem you're probably having is that CIS' YMODEM is in fact Y-Modem

Thank you. I tried the ymodem-batch and it worked, sort of. One problem. I
could not get it to write properly to drive 1. I not sure what the problem is.
I use a slightly patched version of OSTERM that created a seperate /dd/com

 that I am not certain of right know. I will try playing with an unpatched

I've heard from some folks that at least some of the TOPS stuff is dependent on
the way things work on Atari STs (i.e. what the programmers who wrote or ported
it were using).  Initially, the TOPS people didn't send out source code, but
they may be doing that now, so it may be possible to find and correct the
problems.

A CIS Guru question for you, sir:

Occasionally at work, I need to download a file to the Unix machine (usually a
binary). I need to override my default 'B Plus' protocol setting and use
Kermit. If I type:

 DOW/PROTO: KERMIT

It complains of an unknown protocol (harumph). I end up popping over to DEFALT
and requesting a protocol selection of SHOW MENU for that session (could just
as well hard select Kermit at that point).

Am I missing a trick here, or is the PROTO option braindead?

Thank You! Thank You! Bless You!

You are a guru..., an OS-9 god!

Your suggestion to change that byte value in the Init file was EXACTLY right!
It now works perfectly, and so does that B09 program you gave me. By just
changing the names of the "game" , as you told me, anything I try is now
running perfectly as a MV application.

Any chance of you teaching classes in OS-9 & programming? :-) How did you ever
learn this thing upside down & right side out like you did. PLEASE don't say by
reading the manual, 'cause then I'll really feel dumb <GRIN>.

Bob - glad it all worked, but you did the hard part by continuing.  I just

Yes, reading the manual helped a LOT.  But some of us "cheated" and also took
OS-9 apart, which helps now and again.  More importantly tho, the same
questions pop up all the time, which means once you figure something out (or
someone else does :-), then you look good answering the next time...

thx - kev    PS: tell me you understand that program, and I'll be even happier!
If you don't, ask away!

A few questions. Is there any good books on 6809 Assembly language applicable

limited to menu items of no more than 15 characters. I noticed this is
documented on pg 9-14 of the Multi_Vue manual. It states menu title 15 chars
max and on pg 9-15 MI.TTL item name 15 chars max. Is there anyway to patch this
so as to increase the length of the menu title or menu items?

is an Osborne/McGraw-Hill book; I don't know whether it's still available.

Righto.  Of course, you could always impliment your own menu routines, to let
you have more chars if you need to.  That's actually allowed for pulldown
menus... lemme think... just specify no items, and do your own overlay
pulldown.  You also have to update the menubar when done, so that the selected
item goes back to normal.

Sb: #5.25" floppy weirdness
Fm: James Jones 76257,562
To: All

To quote the Princess Leia character in *Hardware Wars*, "Help me, Augie ben
Doggie--you're my only hope!" :-)

I just got a new floppy disk drive that I am trying to run hooked up where my
late lamented 5.25" floppy disk drive used to be connected, so that once I
convince myself this new drive works, I will replace my remaining old floppy
drive and put in a 3.5" floppy where the new 5.25" floppy is now. Now that
that's cleared up :-)...the new floppy is supposed to be much like the old
one--96 tpi, 80 track, double-sided, double-density.  I set the drive select
jumpers appropriately, made sure the terminator ("I'll be back...") was in the
right place, and booted up.  The old drive works; the new one goes
wugga-wugga-wugga when I try to access it.

(OTOH, it only comes on when it's reasonable to, so I know I don't have the
cable on backwards, and the drive select is right.)

I should have such luck as for the jumpers on this drive to be like the old
ones--instead, I see by the four drive select jumpers one labeled "S", though
the jumper *may* be covering the letter preceding.  By the drive select jumpers
and the "S" are three labeled "LD," "U1," and "U2", with the LD one jumpered. 
Off to one side are three jumpers labeled "HS," "HM," and "HL," none of which
are jumpered.

Does this sound familiar to anyone?  I guess I'll try switching the drives,
though I can't see that that would make any difference--there wouldn't be
anything in the controller specific to drive 1 that would have been fried when
the other old drive went south, would there?

At the least, I think you need HM jumpered, so that the head loads on motor-on
(assuming the drive actually has head-load solenoid).

Also, try it on the cable by itself and see what happens. luck!

Mark,

Here I am trying to install your UUCP program.  Unfortunately, I haven't gotten
by adduser yet.  When I start adduser, first of all it doesn't take a command
line parameter like "adduser bob" (i.e. it prompts for a username anyway).

So at the username prompt, I type in the name (Bob for argument's sake), press
return, then it asks for User ID #. I type in a reasonable number, press
return, and the program just ends with no errors or any discernible disk
activity.

What am I missing here?

That's what I ended up doing too. In addition, I changed a call to create() (a
Kreider lib version) to Microware's creat() and that worked fine after a
compile.  The create() call had two arguments called S_IUPDAT or something and
I had no idea what that stood for as far as permissions and such.

    Ooops, soulda warned you about that. Mark apparently uses header files that
aren't stock Kreider or MWC. I added the S_IUPDATE to my modes.h file. Isn't
"portable" C nice? With only a little work and frustration (took me about two
hours to figure out what was wrong) you can port a program from one CoCo to
another CoCo.  :>

While Mark does rely heavily on the Kreider libs and non standard header files,
both have been available in the libraries for some time now.

Using other than stock 'anythings' can sometimes create an atmosphere of
confusion. The benefits of replacing the stock libs and header files with those
found here outway the disadvantages. By now, folks consider the Kreider Libs to
be standard.

The S_IUPDAT is just defining (S_IREAD+S_IWRITE).


Mark stays in touch. Feel free to leave him a message if other problems crop
up.

I also have the Kreider libs handy, but I also have the Kreider headers handy
too. The S_IUPDATE issue was just a wrench in the works for me.  I don't do
enough C compiling to know these things. Anyway, I did solve the problem by
using an original Microware function.  I hope to be able to communicate with
Mark via my own UUCP site very shortly.

I'm sooooo new to OS9 that I might be considered a preschooler. You've got your
work cut out for you.

     Before I start, what is OSK?  Now, after reconfig, I formatted a disk in
/d1, all went well, showed number of sectors in a strange format and showed
much free space avail under the FREE command.

     Went to format /d3 and get Error msg #221, Format /devname <opts>, etc. 
Found in book to call /d3 (/d1 2), like calling it drive 1.5. Am I right so
far?  Anyway get Error #207.  If I try to reformat /d1, get Error #207.  Must
be rewrite protect, for both sides??  Does this mean Drive 3 was formatted
along with Drive 1.

     I just love getting in over my head!!  Also, I can't open Help file or
Error msg. file.  I'm sure everyone but me knows.

Perhaps more details would help.  What output do you get if you type the

wired?

(I've used osterm and telstar, and they seem to be able to dial reasonably.
Aside from xmode /t2 type=0, I don't think I've done anything special to the

Everyone might want to know that I've gotten most of Chris Braymen's MFF1-to-0
program working.  Rewrote it to use long integers, chopped out some rather
entangled "good-bad" data checking (wasn't needed), and by golly after it's
fully linked with MW's Clib.l it comes in at under 8k-512 bytes!  This is good
since it uses RAM to load the MFF1 file and index thru all the tracks.  Kinda
spiffy, too, since this is doing mostly reformatting work.

Having a snag every now & then, tho.  Dunno if we have bad data in a few of the
MFF1 files being used in testing this, or if the Dearc/UnZip3 is gushing out
some junk from the original compressed files.  Ends up putting out bad delta
times in the MFF0 output (definitely not the MFConv pgm doing the damage).
Making darn sure we're using binary I/O routines (FRead, FWrite, etc.) ya know.

So bear with me; as I find time, this will be good enough for maybe 80% of the
MFF1 files being shared.  (The other 20% will be too large for the 48k+ RAM
region available.  I guess we'd need a direct-SEEK disk file version to handle
the big jobbies?)

Converting MFF1 files to MFF0 also entails rewriting part of the MFF0 output to
incorporate updated length fields etc. in the SMF header.  This means pipes
ain't gonna work -- sorry.  (Yes I'm being careful not to use 'lseek' on the
buffered files!  I'm using 'rewind' which should be okay.  And I'm using the
'_RBF' flag -- may need to resort to using old-fashioned Reads & Writes to
ensure pure binary data!)

Chris mentioned he's able to compile long ints now, so tonight I'll ship him
the code I've created and ask him to test/debug it.  -- Thx, Paul Seniura.

(P.s. Am testing a version of MFPlay that will load the entire MFF0 file to be
played into RAM, i.e. the mostest-accuratest way we can do timed I/O with Sleep
calls.  Again this can deal with maybe 80% of what's out there without going
over the 48k+ data region.  But one or two of those PolySoft demos still slow
down although not so noticeable!)

Ian - it's also possible (maybe even probable) that CRC will sell off its CoCo
stuff/rights to someone who wants to continue the line.

I have an Okidata microline 92 sitting in the closet collecting dust (printer).
It's a 9 pin with a NLQ mode (near letter quality.. approaches 24 pin
appearance), does 180CPS, bottom and rear paper feeds, and uses inexpensive ($2
or so) reel ribbons. Essentially, it's a tank..never a glitch. I also have the
optional tractor feed unit for it (pin feed an friction are standard). It has a
parallel interface. I may have a Botek serial to parallel floating around as
well, if needed.

I'd like to reclaim the closet space and get $75 for it... any takers?

Sb: Smart Watch Drivers
Fm: Lee Veal 74726,1752

     There's a fellow in our local club that uses a SuperController
  II, and has a SmartWatch installed in its ROM socket.  He has a
  question concerning the drivers found in SWCLOC.AR in Lib 10.  They
  are all slot-specific which seems to mean that they assume that an
  MPI is plugged into the system.  However, since he doesn't use an MPI
  (the SCII handlesuhis HD, FD, and RS-232), he's wondering if it even
  matters which SWClock driver and GetClk program he uses in his
  system.

       The only differences that I've been able to find among the like
  modules contained in the ARchive (besides the CRCs) are the slot
  select codes.  For instance, the module SWCLOCK4 has, starting at
  1EB, an 8633 (LDA immediate) followed by a B7FF7F (STA), and SWCLOCK3
  has an 8622 followed by the POKE (STA) that actually does the slot
  select.
       Since the B7FF7F is addressing the Slot Select byte that only
  means something if an MPI is plugged in, would it be necessary to NOP
  the 86xxB7FF7F instruction sequence with 1212121212, if no MPI is
  plugged into the CoCo?

I think I've found a bug in the latest Kreider library.
Using the program below, I get a wrong result of

Fri Mar  5 18:59:20 1991

even though today is April 5th.

   #include <utime.h>
   #include <stdio.h>

   main()
   {
   long curr_time;

   curr_time = time((long *)0);
   puts(ctime(&curr_time));
   }

The version of the lib that I'm using is 30,575 bytes long
and was created 12/7/90 (I think).  Have there been any
updates since then?

There was a problem that Carl worked on regarding a month index being off by
one. Perhaps when he fixed it, he broke other functions that used it (cringe).
Try Carl directly at 71076,76.

PETE;

     WE DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT I CANNOT ACCESS THE FLIP SIDE OF MY FLOPPIES. 
YOU SAID TO DOWNLOAD DMODE.AR, WHICH I DID.  I TAKE IT FROM YOUR MESG. DTD. 24
MAR, THAT I NEED TO GRAB DOSOR9 FROM DL10 WHICH I WILL DO NOW.  BOB PALMER
SUGGESTED THAT I RE-CONFIG AND CHOOSE 40 TRACK.  I DID. I GET ERROR MSG. 221
"FORMAT /DEVNAME <OPTS>. WHEN I TRY TO FORMAT THE FLIP AS IN /D3 OF /D1.  MY
QUESTION NOW IS, WITH 40 TRACK, DURING <FORMAT>, IS BOTH SIDES AUTOMATICALLY
FORMATTED FROM THE COMMAND <FORMAT /D1>???

     CATCH YOU LATER - FRANK
