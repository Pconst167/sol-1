Here is the source code I used for the relay program.
PROCEDURE CassRelay
V=PEEK(65313)
IF V=60 THEN
POKE 65313,52
ELSE
POKE 65313,60
ENDIF
END
I haven't had any problems with this PACKed procedure so far.  Do you

Yep -


I don't recall if the cassette is controlled from  one of the PIA port or PIA
control bits. In either case, the preferable method is to take what you PEEK at
that location, use AND to clear or OR to set the appropriate bits, and the POKE
the updated value (believe that they are LAND and LOR, or something like that
in B09).

I tried a DUMP of sterm on both the DOSOR9 disk and the OS9-formatted disk
sterm was copied to.  The results were totally different.  The results I got on
the DOSOR9 disk might be OK, but are not on the OS-9 disk.  I had DUMP running
in the 40-col mode.  In the middle, every line went E5E5E5... and in the right
col, every line was just lowercase e's.  No wonder I kept                    
;getting ERROR 205 when I tried to load sterm from the true OS-9 disk. How
could copy -s have messed up the copy like this?

Aha... evidence. The 'E5' patterns is what the formatter puts in the sectors

OK, but why didn't copy -s actually put the file on the disk?  It did at least
put an entry in the file allocation table.  Under what conditions will copy not
copy?  And for those times, how can I copy a file, short of Backup of the whole

Can't help you there... I wasn't there. Was the disk write protected? (probably
not if the directory and FD sector entries made it.. BTW, there is no FAT per
se under os9). Was there a bad spot on the media that caused copy to die out
prematurely? Was the disk drive flakey or dirty? Any of the normal disk related
suspicions apply.

Best bet is to repeat the whole affair, checking results at every step. That
way, at least we can point a finger at the culprit, and move from that point.
Has this been consistant with all file copies? Have you got the latest copy of
DOSOR9.BAS? Is your 'copy' good (ident it)? CHeck its version and CRC with
others here.

Eh?  The TC9 has a 6809 (well, perhaps a 6309, but it's equivalent) in it.  It
would be very hard indeed to make that emulate a Macintosh.  If there's some
plan to make "the Tomcat" (I put that in quotes because with so many options, I
am not sure the definite article applies) emulate a Macintosh, I would very
much expect that it will require an addition 680xx board.

From what I understand the TC9 will be compatible with most if not all

I had several "threads" started here, one for each issue.  Kevin, for example,
replied to the TMRDRV.TXT thread and -- while I appreciate his time -- it
didn't help one bit because I need some details.  And CIS won't let me upload
an entire 17k MESSAGE of what we are discussing in our brain-storming sessions
at my place!  Hence the "articles".

I uploaded many of these articles several months ago on both CIS and Delphi.
Most of the users on Delphi actually took the time to tell me they couldn't
help.  Contrast that to the "dead air" I'm getting here.  I had hoped CIS would
be a "better" place to discuss this, since the gurus "live" here and how CIS
costs so much more than Delphi & GEnie (which *is* carrying a *very* dead
CoCo/OS9 sections).

Now, someone knows how these new OSK machines work.  Paul Ward hasn't mentioned
any specifics at all, and I know Frank Hogg and the "Delmar" Ed frequent this
place, too.  Am I to understand that NO OTHER 68K machine has hardware timers
akin to the 12-bitter in the CoCo3?  Am I to understand that there is no
Microware-defined SVCs for the specific calls I have mentioned in my articles?
Do I take this lack of response as that no one knows what I'm talking about?

Do y'all understand why I am perplexed concerning the lack of responses I'm
getting?  At least people should say "something" rather than "nothing", or give
me some ideas where to go write for such info.

I'm getting "none of the above" type of help from everyone here!  I wish I
didn't need to get this upset, but I think this PRECISELY shows why OS9 is such
a dead system, and why it shows OSK will *soon* BE a dead system.

Don't mean to belittle anyone ... but I *am* starting to wonder.  I'm one who
wants to "do" things rather than wait for someone to come up with something
useful.  I have bought everyone's books on OS9 and I'm still very much in
creating some new leading-edge ideas and projects (at Okla.D.O.T. we sometimes
say "bleeding edge" ideas!).

I know I can do these projects -- but I need a lot of input.  And of course I
do plan on sharing everything for free.

To: all

Is it possible to set the file attributes when using creat()?

If I do something like creat(filename,S_IREAD+S_IOREAD) I get a "illegal mode"
error. I've tried various combinations, but the only ones which seem to take
are S_IREAD, S_IWRITE and S_ISHARE. Trying to set any public bits causes
errors. I'm beginning to think that creat() will always set the file
permissions to S_IREAD+S_IWRITE and uses the 'mode' param as the access mode
when opening the file. But this is not what the docs imply. I know I can use
create() to do what I want, but this has really got me bugged. I see that there
is a mask defined in the modes.h file, but I really don't understand what to do
with it. This is probably really simple and I'll feel stupid (again) once
someone points out the answer....

Oh, I tried this under Level II and it seems that the file is always created
for public read and owner read/write, no matter what the value of 'mode'. No
errors, but mode doesn't seem to have much effect either.

Bob,
 The documentation in the Microware manual is misleading: under creat(), it
says "The permissions are ..." when it means "The access permissions ...". The
function you want to use is create():
 create(name,mode,perm[,initial_size])
 where mode is the access permissions as in creat(), perm is the file's
attributes - what you are wanting to set.
 You can probably guess how I knew the answer to this one so fast!

I recently discovered what I think may be a bug in Shell v2.1. I sometimes get
an Error 201 when I use either one of these commands:

  SHELL "tmode echo"

 -

  SHELL "tmode -echo"

 This happens while I'm working on a Basic09 program and I test run it. If this
is not the case, somebody tell me why it
 does that.


 Thanks

George

Hmmm...201 is "illegal path number".  What state is standard input in when you
try to do the tmode?

Is it possible to add a ribbon cable between the connector on the side of the
CoCo3 and the FD-501 floppy controller?  I'd like to put the controller inside
a box with the floppy drives and am wondering if the ribbon cable will cause
any problems.  Also, what about a ribbon cable between the CoCo3 and one of the
Disto interfaces?

There are (or were) extension cables available.  But you should make your own
instead if you can.  By making your own, you have control over two very
important factors: a)the cable should be as short as possible, and b)you can
use low-capacitance cable.  Also look for well-shielded cable.

Shielded cable?  I was thinking of using plain old ribbon cable.  Guess that
wouldn't work, eh?

Also, I asked this before and nobody responded.  Can someone give me the phone
number for CRC?  I can't find a copy of Rainbow and would like to get prices on
the Disto controllers.

Thanks in advance! David Betz

There is shielded ribbon cable available, but it seems to be a bit on the side
of expensive and hard to find.  You can make your own shield as well. I don't
have a number for CRC (do you actually mean CMC??  If so, your local RS should
have it.)

Hmmm...  Maybe I *do* mean CMC.  What I'm looking for is a place that used to
advertise in Rainbow and sold Disto disk controllers.  Unfortunately, I'm
unable to find a copy of Rainbow (even at my local RS store).

David - you were right: CRC.  Canada: 1-514-383-5293 is one number I have
(might be old).  They're selling off the last stuff the have... I believe
someone else will be taking over the CoCo hardware from them soon.

Which controller are you looking for, btw?  Might be someone around selling
one. best - kev

Thanks, Paul.  Pulled in mffcp.ar last week (just before a trip) and used it
just enough to have my appetite whetted.  After a few more hours, I have just
barely scratched surface of what I want to do.  Thanks for this fine addition
to the tools for music file manipulation.  Regards, Ches.

Geez, I guess I have to ask .... :-(


How was the 'fest? I would have thought someone would have posted a min review
by now for those of us that couldn't make it.

Did all 3 OSK entries make their grand entrance? Anything else worthy of note?
Inquiring minds want to know!

Well, let's see.  Mike Knudsen's two-part review that showed up in the BITNET
mailing list will, no doubt, appear in the DL, but my recollections are as
follows:

1.  I was rushed, so I didn't get a chance to see things in as much detail as
I'd have liked--for example, I should've played with the Tomcats on display and
asked whether the TC9s could run non-OS-9 software yet.  (I don't want to run
any such software, but I am curious to see it actually work.)

2.  I didn't make it to all the discussions--in particular, I didn't get to
what appears now to be a traditional panel discussion featuring FHL, Delmar,
and IMS representatives.  I did catch the tail end of it, though, and I was
struck by two consecutive questions among the last few.  One: can we hook up
our old CoCo hardware to your machines?  Two: when the world goes for 64-bit
stuff, can we still use your machines?  (If I were a manufacturer or seller of
systems, I think I'd be pulling my hair at that point.)

3. There were fewer but bigger booths--eighteen, I think.  Still some
interesting stuff, though: Burke**2 was showing stuff to hook up a scanner to a
CoCo; FHL now sells Ultrascience's products, and was advertising a cheap 68000
board as a TC9 speedup; IMS was showing various demos on MM/1s, including a
very interesting thing that looked like a frame grabber that Tony DiStefano had
hooked up to a camera on one end and an MM/1 on the other, if I observed
correctly; Delmar was showing various demos on their systems (some sound from a
Soundblaster, if I remember rightly).  Tandy was selling CoCo stuff for *real*
cheap--I hesitated about buying an Orchestra-90 and a guy said OK, I'll let you
have 20 of them for $10 (!?!).  I turned him down, because I didn't know how
I'd get them all home!

(Oops!  I should say "inexpensive," not "cheap;" don't want to give the wrong
impression about FHL's board!)

Perhaps of mainly personal interest, I picked up most of my MM/1 kit--still
waiting for a slight assembly bogosity (the assemblers used substitute parts
where they shouldn't have) in the second board to be corrected, but that
shouldn't take long

..oops, went over the limit.  Anyway--it shouldn't be long before the extra 2
Mbytes of RAM and the SCSI drive that are calling to me are connected and
running, and then I'll be an even happier camper than I am now.

Met lotsa nice folks, including Brother Jeremy (nice tabard and tunic, and a
most pleasant person).  Had fun.  What more could I ask?  (Well, it would have
been nice to stay longer; next time I'll resist the temptation to stay with
friends, despite the hotel bill and even though they are good friends.)

Erich - take apart the FD502 case, and I believe it has the second drive
connector already there.  The only caveat is that I believe Tandy installs a
small fan when a 2nd drive is added, as the power supply in there is a little
overloaded and will run very hot with both drives turning.  You might consider
adding an external fan on the back, or something.

Oh. Tell us what jumpers are marked on the 2nd drive you get... will give us
all a clue as to how you should set them. best - kev
