Now I am lost too.  You say"went to format /d3 and got error msg "221." The
error translates as MODULE NOT FOUND.  If you were to do an MDIR I suspect that
you will not find a module by the name od D3.  This means that you do not have
a descriptor for a drive called /d3. (normall

- ooh - butcher job of editing. (normally /d3 is the fourth drive  ie /d0 /d1
/d2 /d3 and unless you want to become a hardware guru stsy away from trying to
have more than 3 double dided drives ) Remember - you can only format drives
for which the computer has a descriptor in your system right now you have
probably got /d0 /d1 and /dd yes?  /dd is usually an alter ego for /d0 but can
be the hard disk or anything else. what do the descriptors you have contain? 
they must correspond to the physical hardware - ie if /d0 is single sided then
the descriptor has to say so if /d1 is double sided likewise.  Please remember
- double sided OS9 disks are NOT like under RSDOS - there is ONLY ONE DISK.  ie
/d1 being double sided 40 tracks will have 1440 sectors (decimal) arranged
alternately fron one side to the other on the diskette.  The drive can read and
write and format single sided diskettes (to format you first use dmode)9 to
read or write just stuff it in. Does this make sense to you? re error and help
- in the /d0 SYS directory do you have the files ERRMSG and HELPMSG? do you
have the commands error and help in your commands directory?  What happens when
you type error 221 <enter>?

Hi Mark.  I hope you go with UltiMuse under OS9. I did write a MIDI recording
program and got it working, sort of, but my old RUlaford MIDI Pak has a 6850
chip which Motorola says wona't do the 1.8 MHz Coco3 clock rate, and the chip
rebelled by dropping bytes now and then, just enuf to spoil the music.  SO
until I get a 68B50 chip to upgrade it, I can't do a MIDI recorder under L2. 
Once I do, I'll try to write a timing-diagram (piano roll format) grafix editor
and maybe a smart program to translate your playing into Ultimuse notation.
Pretty busy with MM/1 OSK port of Ultimuse and the income tax right now tho,
with a Rainbowfest coming up.  --mike k

UME will start out the same under OSK, but a lot faster (you should see how
fast it draws a score now-all messed up, but FAST). New features will come very
fast after that, and some will also go into the Coco version as well, which
still has a few promises to pay off on per features in upgrades. Recording MIDI
on the MM/1 will not require any extra hardware, but on the COco it needs a
MIDI Pak with an yupgraded 68B50 chip. --mike k

Mark, I hoped you found a touch-sensitive keyboard in your $500 range. Used to
be you couldn't touch one under $1000. Anyway I agree that for learning piano
you definitely want that feature.  I shudder to think I almost bought one
without it.

However, some very cheap units CAN respond to MIDI touch velocity values and
play with expression under Lyra or UME, even tho your fingers can't get the
expression on the little keys.

By the way, neither Lyra nor UME really need a hardware MIDI Pak interface, but
can run off a serial cable in the back (the printer port). Only to record hand
playing do you really need the Pak, tho complex pieces may play better with it.

Mike,
 Yup, I bought a Kawai KC10 for $495.00 It's *very* small, and I'll eventually
write a user interface on the CoCo to program it (right now, you need the
manual in front of you to do anything). It has a 2 or 3 reasonable piano PCM
samples and a total of 128 samples and other sounds. I saw a Casio that looked
like a better deal, but the Kawai had a much less busy front panel and was 1/3
the depth.
 I would eventually like to record hand playing - you know, play something and
have the computer spit out sheet music. I have been reading some on the MIDI
spec, but am trying to get married *and* get our work project into Beta (at the
White Plains DCO - FOA is Atlanta).

Mark,

What a dream, to be able to play live into a MIDI box and have a computer spit
out sheet music! Unfortunately, computers resolve time better than we do, so
you've got to do some serious quantizing either before hand or after the fact
-- and after the fact is awful tedious! I think that doing what you want
"transparently" will be harder to crack than generic voice recognition.

Still, with some good software from folks like Knudsend, we can at least get as
close as the PC folks.

Best,

OK.  Does that Kawai KC10 have touch-responsive keys, or at least thru MIDI? At
least you can program it -- many tone-boxes now cannot be programmed AT ALL
without a MIDI computer.

I've written some test programs to record MIDI on OS9-L2, but I need a faster
68B50 chip in my MIDI Pak to make them work right, so on the back burner right
now.

Yes, the Kawaii has both velocity-sensitivity and MIDI thru. It may as well
require an external computer to program, as you have to have the manual in
front of you while you're doing it. (eg: each "sound" is just a number between
1 and 128 - you look it up on a table in the manual.)

Yes, nothing can really replace a REAL piano, but some of the tiny spinet
models, especially those made today, sound much worse than any decent
electronic piano, and their touch is terrible too.  Just as some electronic
organs are better than some pipe organs.

But as you hint, a big old upright, once overhauled by a professional
tuner/technician, will sound and feel better than anything (except a big Grand,
if you have room!).

And you can't loan your real piano to you sister, unless she brings lots of big

Hi Paul.  Would you want to try incorporating my Virtual Memory techniques into
your MFF players?  Or maybe the VRN "device" allegedly on Delphi?

WHen Dale Puckett published his one-page description of how my VMem stuff works
in Rainbow, I offered to give him a cleaned-up source of the relevant routines
to publish. I could probably fix you up with something like that, tho I don't
have a lot of time to help you out with them. They use Grafix put-get buffers,
but could be easily zapped to use Data Modules.  And they are NOT buggy, at
least not since the first version.

It wouldn't be that hard to get UME to "play" into an MFF file -just another
item in a long list of projecdts.  --mike k

Hi Mike,

I think I already got the VRN thingie.  I'd have to redo it since I'm always
using Rick Adams' VI editor (patched TS/Edit).  I don't usually mess around
with games so I've never installed it, yet it could be helpful in grabbing RAM.
But it would need to do the entire bank-switching inside one 60-Hz tick.

Right now my ideals are to provide a generic player for any OS9/6809 machine,
not just for the CoCo3/Level-2 crowd.  There's some who still have Level-1 and
possibly the older CoCo models, etc.  They won't be able to use such a player.
A program that reads input from a file will let anyone use whatever hardware
(cache or DMA) they have, including RAM-disk cards etc. -- you know:
flexibility.  So far, I can hear a very slight pause when there is a lot of
super-fast MIDI stuff going on, more likely a delay caused by our RS232
hardware hogging all the CPU cycles (hard-wired IRQ lines etc.).

And simply using 'malloc()' seemed to be good enough for those busy files. That
is, until I downloaded a ZIP'd file that was compressed 81% which produced a
MFF1 that was over 118k big!  We're going to have to rewrite this converter to
do SEEKs for files like that.  And then that version will be generic enough so
anyone can compile it & use it.

If you get my drift: Part of the problem with IBM[tm]/compatibles software,
whether it be on a PC, PS/2, mainframe, AIX, 8100, etc., is that they write
everything to be memory-resident.  The fastest file archivers use all the RAM
they can grab.  I'm not disagreeing with this practice, but it makes special
problems for porting and multitasking.  (For example, IBM promises that
OS/2[tm] version 2.0 [EE or not] will be a lot smaller code-wise because
they'll have finally found a way to use common routines, kinda like a run-time
library.  I bet someone saw how OSK uses similar common modules to do the math
and I/O!)

Finally, I'm hoping we can ditch all this CMF stuff once we can have Two-way
paths between SMFs and UME.

OK -- some of your message scrolled off the screen, but at least CTRL-S works

always nice to hear about IBM's screwups (I'm not putting an [tm] after their
stuff, wonder why anyone would, grin).

Don't know what CMF is -- guess SMF means MFF, standard midi format? Yeah I
will get UME to play into MFF files.  ANd I do have a little MIDI recorder for
Coco OS9-L2, it works except my hardware 6850 wona't hack the fast clock rate,
so gotta find a 68B50 before I can do anything constructive.

Hope you're getting some use out of UME, despite its limitations. Say, did I
ask yourpermission to just play (not give out!) the ST:TNG theme at RainbowFest
this weekend?  Tanks, mike k

Hi Paul (the Ward variety).  Kev Pease *finally* got his copy of my proposed
standard for MIDI data movement within the MM/1. It allows the driver, not the
application (like UME) to do the timing.  It uses timing bytes slipped in here
and there between the chords.  Kev P and I have talkede about it once since he
got it, as to what features and statcalls will get implemented (I threw in
everything I could think of) and which are not so useful or easy to do.

I really hope to have something runing for MM/1 at Fest, but right now the
other Kev's early-version mouse driver is giving me fits. --mike k

Seriously, I'm very much looking forward to seeing what you get running on the

possible to have a driver play back samples?  (Dunno how useful that would be,

I need to get in on this so the CoCo3 can do the very same thing.  In

do the timing, causing the driver to route the I/O at the correct moment.

Also, I hope no one is plagurizing what we were discussing in that article. I'm

I haven't posted mine anywhere, since Kev Pease had to hack on it some in terms

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

Help!!! I've run into a possible problem with a program I'm writing. The
program has a help function which uses a special ASCII file for displaying the
various screens. The first time the user access the help function the file is
opened for read and scanned. The locations of the various menus and their names
is stored in an in-memory buffer. Once this scan is complete the displays of
the various screens is very fast. The file is left open and the pointers are
retained for future accesses.

This works very well. As a matter of fact, other processes can also access the
file, and since everyone opens for READ-only there is no record locking to
worry about. The problem comes if someone (like me!) decides to make changes to
the file (like adding an additional screen) when the file is in use. Making
changes really fouls the pointers up for the other guy.

So: Can my program sense somehow that the file has been modified? Or, can I
flag the file someway so that it can't be opened for WRITE when it being used.

The only easy method I can see is to set the attributes to read only, forcing
the superuser to do some deliberate fiddling before making changes. Anyone got
any other ideas? What I need is something like the 'shareable' premission which
will let others read, but not write....

As far as testing the file for modifications, what about doing an _gs_size()
call before each access. If _gs_size != old_size, then rescan. Obvious gotcha
is if you didn't change size, but altered the file (corrected a typo  etc.).
Another option might be to flag the time at file open, and then check the last
modified time before each access. This may or may not work, as I don't remember
if the last modified time is updated before the file is closed.

Pete, Thanks for the earlier help with my open files delimma. Actually, the
solution was pretty simple: When I go to save a file I open it for write in an
non-shareable mode. If the file is currently being read by another process
(like my help function) the open will fail and I can alert the user. Tricky
stuff this OS-9. What gets me mad is that I spent hours developing complicated
schemes using file locking, etc. which didn't work - oh well, the joys of
programming.

Erich -

The ERROR 43 says 'cannot find the module' essentially. In the 1st case, you
didn't have a CLS program. In the second case, it appears that it couldn't find
the 'inkey' code in your execution directory. Is it there, and are the
attributes set to allow its execution?

Another easy (and somewhat speedier) technique is to merge a copy of the Inkey
routine onto the end of the packed module (once you have packed it, that is).

As far as availability, one method might be to use the SYSCALL module to effect
a F$Link to see if a module were in memory. Proper methodology dictates that
you'd also have to do a corresponding F$unlink to bring the link count back to
normal.

I know inkey was on the same disk.  I think it was in the execution dir.  I
never set its attributes (I thought RS would make all their programs
executable, but I have already found that to be not so).  I'll see how that
goes.  Then I'll try again with merging.  At least I've made it this far!

Going over the book "Termcap and Terminfo" has been a lot of fun, and pretty
informative. I highly suggest that anyone writing termcap applications gets a
copy of this (O'Riley and Assc., 632 Petaluma Ave, Sebastopol, CA 95472).

It mentions that there is a 'wi' termcap entry which defines a window. The
params for 'wi' are the window xstart,ystart,xsize and ysize. However, it does
not mention how to start the window. Any of you UNIX types have any more info
on this? The reason I ask is that if windowing is already defined by termcap
then it'll make writing portable applications much easier. And the applications
can then take advantage of 'hardware' windowing on units like the mm/1.

  Interesting possibilities raised by the I^2C interface...... home control of

home-sitter for those travelling, living alone, or just the tinkerer (that's

  Will this interface require the (promised) MM/1 bus to take advantage of some
of the features?  I am getting a picture of a plug-in card with TTL logic and
dip relays for some of the functions described above.  Is this something that
IMS is planning to do?

Jim,

Many of the I^2C interface projects can be done outside of the MM/1 case. That
means that most people won't EVER need to purchase the extra-slot bus. Even if
someone DOES buy the extra slot bus, the extra cards may or may not use/support
I^2C. That somewhat depends on third part support.

Interestingly, almost all of our customers are quite happy with the existing
I/O, even though IMS is committed to its expansion bus option.

Anyway, the I^2C will definitely NOT REQUIRE the MM/1 extra slot bus.

It should be really fun to work with, and I think will greatly satisfy the CoCo
Community Craving -- you know, if you can't do hardware hacking with a
computer, forget it.

No -- it was a summary that is basically the same as on DL15. Apparently, our
sales department sent out a few of the Dear Valued letters without the

Aha! I wondered why I didn't find the "enclosed document" that I was to find
interesting, but I figured it would be covered in your postings here and on
D****I. BTW, how's that shipping schedule on kits going?  I am fighting a
terrible urge to chase UPS trucks.

Just decided last week that I could make to Chicago for the R'Fest - round trip

Great! Glad you can be there!

We'll be shipping kits this week. Manufacturing delays not of our doing have
aged me considerably. I'll be the guy with the white hair and cane ....

We'll also be handing out some machines to those folks who would have been sent
out in the first batch anyway. That only gives them about a ten day head start
on the people going out in the first batch. Then we have two MORE batches to
fill!

Lots of orders, and they keep on comin!

  Interesting possibilities raised by the I^2C interface...... home control of
zone heating/cooling, door/window security, auto-dial and play pre-recorded
message based on event trigger, etc., etc.  Kinda like an electronic
home-sitter for those travelling, living alone, or just the tinkerer (that's
me).

  Will this interface require the (promised) MM/1 bus to take advantage of some
of the features?  I am getting a picture of a plug-in card with TTL logic and
dip relays for some of the functions described above.  Is this something that
IMS is planning to do?

  What's the latest on the shipping schedule?  Are you going to be shipping
kits out before the Fest?

You have a very good point. We certainly will distribute them in chronological
order. SOME computers will be shipped right before the Fest, some delivered
during, and SOME delivered right after. Your system will be in one of those

Fm: Jay Truesdale 72176,3565
To: all

I downloaded the 'conf.c' program from lib 12 here which doesn't work on my
system which is running OSK V1.3.

I've narrowed the problem down with following test program.  On the first
execution of this test program the data module is successfully created as shown
by the output from an 'ident -m':

 Header for:      confblock
 Module size:     $1050       #4176
 Owner:           0.0
 Module CRC:      $330C42     Good CRC
 Header parity:   $3222       Good parity
 Edition:         $1          #1
 Ty/La At/Rev     $400        $8000
 Permission:      $333        ------wr--wr--wr
 Data Mod, Sharable

The 'munload' step at the end fails with an error 221 "(E$MNF) Module not
found."

On the second execution of the test program, the 'modlink' step fails with the
same error.

 /* test.c  */

 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <module.h>
 #include <errno.h>

 #define BLOCKSIZE 4096
 #define DATA_NAME "confblock"

 char *_mkdata_module();
 mod_exec *modlink();
 int munload();

 main ()
 {
   int error_save;
   mod_exec *commod;
   char *module_ptr;

   if ((int)(commod = modlink (DATA_NAME, MT_DATA)) == -1)
   {
      error_save = errno;
      printf("test: Error number %d after attempt to link to confblock\n",
         error_save);

      if (error_save != 221)
         exit (_errmsg (0, "Error %d while linking to module\n", error_save));

      printf("test: Attempting to create a new data module.\n");

      if ((int)(module_ptr = _mkdata_module (DATA_NAME, BLOCKSIZE, 0x8000,
         0x0333)) == -1)
         exit (_errmsg (0, "Error %d while creating module\n", errno));
      else
         printf("test: Data module created.\n");
   }

   if ((munload (DATA_NAME, MT_DATA)) == -1)
      {
         error_save = errno;
         printf("test: Error number %d after attempt to unload confblock\n",
                error_save);
      }
   exit(0); }


I'm baffled.  Anyone got any suggestions?

Thanks in advance!  -J

I wonder if it's the combination of LINK/UNLOAD.... I believe UNLOAD is a 'zap
til gone' call (not near books at the moment), as opposed to UNLINK, which is a
'decrement link count'. Incidentally, if just attempting to link to verify
existance... nah, never mind. I was thinking of the UNLINK command, which uses
the sequence LINK, UNLINK, UNLINK. The first locates the module and sets up
pointers, the second undoes the link that was just done, and the last effects
the actual unlink.

I've finally gotten a CoCo3 based OS-9 system running and now I'm looking for a

better)?  Alternatively, how about just a floppy/serial card? I'd like to stay
away from using a contraption like the multi-pack interface.  Something with
everything in one cartridge would be best. (Do they even make such things?)

Considering that CRC-Disto is phasing out their COCO line, this may be a good
time to go with their SC-II , and 4-in-1 card. Rainbow has had it adverstised
for $200.00. Perhaps they will have a good 'Fest deal. Also try COCOPRO at
313-481-3283 or Jim's COCO corner, a BBS
 that has an order line for COCO PRO at 313-292-4713. Hope this might be of
some help.

I am trying to write a dialer program to work with my modem, a BSR HAyes

 standard terminal programs such as OSTERM 2.08, I cannot get the port to work
properly. I use /t2. Under OSTERM the command strings:

ATZ

ATX1VIQO (maybe that 1 should be an I)

ATDT

and this works. Why won't : OPEN PATH #/T2 WRITE /T2, "atz" ETC

work. What else do I need to do. I have asked for help with this on several
occassions, but as of yet nothing that has been suggested has worked in helping
me with any of the dialer programs which I have downloaded for CIS. I have
absolutely no idea what is wrong. Any code
 would be deeply appreciated.

Jeremey -

You need to have a carriage return on the end of the command for the modem to
interpret it.

Also - years ago I wrote a dialer program in ASM. It should be in DL9 (or in
the offline DL9 archives), if you're interested.

~ Brother Jeremy;

   Both  disks have to have the same number of 'sides' for  PCDOS to  work 
properly.  This is not a restriction of PCDOS,  but  is hampered  by the COCO
single sided drive. (It's hard to read  the 'opposite'  side  of an IBM double
sided drive, when there is  no head to read it on a COCO single-sided drive
<grin>.)

   Once  upon a time I had single sided COCO OS9 40 track drives. I got along
fine using Bob Santy's PCDOS fine, IF I formatted the MS-DOG disks first as
single sided.

  eq. (assuming a two floppy IBM system) . .

     A:>FORMAT B:/1   {the /1 means format as single sided}

   Then  I  could . . .

     OS9:PCDOS -GET /D0 FOOFOO.TXT  /DX/FOOFOO.TXT

just fine.  I even used the COCO 40 trk disks as 'flippys' on the IBM just
fine.

   'Flippy'  meaning I punched another write protect slot on  the other  side
of the floppy, and added another 'read hole' opposite the  one already there. 
Then I formatted the disk on the IBM  as single sided, flipped it over and
formatted the other side of the disk.

   This  worked  great for transferring files and allowed  me  to maximize the
space used for transfers.

Enjoy;

Mike

Haaland's place of employ (Stardust) for the next few nights. Going with
another couple, who are old friends (and responsible for Marsha an I meeting
each other). Getting married Friday at 3:30 in the afternoon, and then will
probably head down to the couple's condo in Palm Springs for a day or two of
sun and eating non-Iraqi dates ;^}. Should be back Tuesday.

I feel strangely calm about all this after over 6 years of feet dragging. To
say that Marsha has been patient would be an understatement. See you all on the
'other side'.

Pete

P.S. Kevin - you know this means that YOU'RE NEXT.

The long divide bug you found is very old indeed.  It exists in the origional
Microware library.  I will fix it in mine before I upload the next version of
the library.  In the meantime,

 at offset $617d is 6c 01 in clib.l
 or offset $7d02 is 6c 01 in clibt.l
 change that to     63 01

Ah, the fruits of haste....

I fixed an off by one bug in localtime() last December, which, since ctime()
calls localtime() broke ctime().  I neither looked at it or thought about it. 
So, here is the deal..

 at offset $14c5 is 83 00 01 in both clib.l and clibt.l
 change that to     12 12 12

and the problem will go away.

Sorry to one and all.  And tell anybody else you know. I will put up a fresh

Recently there have been two bugs found in my 6809 library.  One is in ctime()
- I put it there when I fixed localtime().  The other is in the long division
routine - it is Microware's bug.

I will put up new versions of the libraries, but for those who don't want to
download the whole thing for these two bugs, here are patches.

For the ctime() problem:
 at offset $14c5 is 83 00 01 in both clib.l and clibt.l
 change that to     12 12 12

For the ldiv problem:
 at offset $617d is 6c 01 in clib.l
 or offset $7d02 is 6c 01 in clibt.l
 change that to     63 01

If I remember rightly, /t1 is the bit-banger.  It's not suitable for any

bitbang.ar, which I think you can find in DL10.

You're right, /t1 is the bitbanger.  I just want to be able to transfer some
files back and forth between a CoCo 2 under RSDOS and a CoCo 3 under OS9 via
null modem cable.  I have only one RS232 pak.

I guess an option would be to devise a null modem cable that would connect the
RS232 pak on the CoCo 3 to the bitbanger on the CoCo 2.  I have no idea at all
how to do that.

Check out SERIAL.TXT in LIB 2. It contains all kinds of valuable information on
serial communications, how to set up the various CoCo (and other) serial ports,
and how to make cables to interconnect them. And yes, you are correct, the best
way to do what you want to do is to use the bit banger on the CoCo2, and the
serial pak on the CoCo3.

you can get 17 of the 512-byte sectors on a track, then you should be able to

     The specs for the 40MB Miniscribe drive was somewhat less than 852.
     I noticed the highest cylinder that the specs listed as formattable
     was quite a distance from the "landing zone" (park track). It did not
     take a brilliant deduction but I figured that the space between the
     park track and the highest track was usable. So, I modified my
     descriptor to format it, too. It formatted fine, and I've been using
     that space (and the 2 extra OS-9 sectors per track) nor about a year.
     It turned out that using the documented high track made the calculations
     come out to a size that more closely  matched what a typical 40MB hard
     drive was supposed to be on an IBM or clone system. OS-9 WINS AGAIN!!!!

 Try it out.

Hi Kev,

One more question about Multi-Vue! I have my execution directory set up as
/d1/cmds. Now, this allows me to have my MV disk in /d0 and my applications
disk in /d1 - so far , so good. Now, if I want to use any of the MV functions,
I have to "set execute" to /d0/cmds, this I assume is normal. Now for the
question. If I change applications disks (/d1), I STILL have to do the "set
execute", and RETYPE /d1/cmds even though it already says that. I assume that
this is the equivalent of the CHX command in the normal shell. It is a pain in
the butt to do that anyway - so is there a way around that? My feeling is that
if the execution directory is already set to /d1/cmds, it should accept ANY of
my applications disk without having to retype the SAME dir name. In lieu of
that, would there be a "macro key" or something I could use to indicate the
exec is STILL /d1/cmds but a different disk?

I know, Kev - I come up with some BEAUTIES, eh? <grin>

Thanx much in advance!!

        Bob

The problem is that despite the name, not all /d1/cmds are alike (i.e. at the
same LSN on the disk).  OS-9 processes just keep track of the device and the
LSN of their current execution and data directories, for speed's sake.  (Any
time you, say, chd /h0/src/sysutils/spanner, you'll be very glad that's what
OS-9 does, because otherwise it would have to always work its way down from /h0
to the current data directory any time it saw a relative pathname!)

 Greetings Bob;

   What James said is true, but there is a way to cheat.

 Using your example, do this . .

 Format  disks  for /d1 and then MAKDIR CMDS on each disk  before  putting
 anything  else  on them.  This way all disks you do like this  will  have
 CMDS in the same place on each disk.

 You  can  then go ahead and copy files over to this disk and you will  be
 all set.

 eq:  when you exchange one of these disks for another like formatted  and
 MAKDIR  CMDS  disk,  CMDS will be in the same place, and no need  to  chd
 /d1/cmds.

 This  is an old trick we use to use back in OS9 LEVEL I, 35 track, single
 sided disk days.

 Enjoy,

 Mike

   As far as I can tell, I made the toc file point to disk2 side1 which
contains all the vol.n files. The toc file, though, doesn't tell that disk2 is
in /d2 and not in /d0 which I booted from. So I copied all the data files on
the /d0 disk to /d2 also and chd /d2 ; chx /d0/cmds after boot ; then Sierra
-r. It seems to go looking on the right drives but I just get a blank screen.
   The other side effect is that the disk drives run slow. The drivers are
patched for 6ms but they are running somewhere between 30ms and 6ms. I think
the problem might be in the boot, so I am going to build a new boot using the
original system master modules, as I know at least CC3Disk is not the original
version.

SH.ar I think is for OSK only although it's been a while since I downloaded it
and I may have forgotten the 6809 version if there was one -- or were you
interested in just the source code (which I believe does not exist in the US)?

Incidentally, after a few weeks with the Bourne shell on my MM/1, I'm sold. The
only weirdnesses are the redirection convnetion and the fact that it doesn't
automatically fork RunB. I get around the first by setting up aliases for all
the basic programs I use, a la

        alias drive runb drive
        alias color runb color

.
 and put that in my $home directory's .profile. On the redirection thing, I
either bite the bullet and do it the way Bourne intended, or I just call the
OS-9 shell, do the deed, and ESC back to Bourne. Neither is a big hassle.

You may want to make sure that you don't type

                del  .*

under the Bourne shell. The os9 shell will properly delete all file names that
begin with "." EXCEPT for the current and parent directory entries. I heard a
report recently that another shell for OS9, maybe the Bourne, will delete even
those entries, and then walk backwards through the directory tree to delete
everything above.

You might want to consider getting a second drive.  If you have either the

IBM compatable drive in there.  I have a FD501 setup in which I removed the
original single sided drive, and replaced it with a 720K and a 360K disk
drives.   I use the 360K drive as drive /d0, and the 720K as drive
 /d1.  This in combination with the LR Tech 40Meg HD as /H0 makes for a
beautiful set.  This sure beats disk swapping anytime.

I am not going to =consider= getting a second drive:  I am **going** to get a

it.  It is at the top of my hardware purchase list.  I have been wondering
about using a IBM PC drive, it would sure save $$$.  I have the FD-502.  For a
PC's drive, would any advance preparation be needed to make it work on the

installing a 2nd drive that appear in the manual that accompanied the FD502? 
How about a 1.2Mb 5.25" PC drive?  I have more than a few such PC disks, and I
would like to transfer their data to DECB and/or OS-9 once I have a transfer
utility.  If I got a dime for every time I've had to switch disks I could pay
off the national debt:-).  I know I will miss diskswapping as much as I miss
CLOADing/CSAVEing and now reading 80 columns on a regular TV set.

Erich, I have another bit of help for you also that may be of some intrest. 
Depending on your set up, you should be able to use you 502 as a double sided
drive under OS9.  Although this wont solve all your problems, it will allow you
to at least have BASIC09 on the same disk as your other OS9 directories, ie.
CMDS, SYS, OS9BOOT.  If you have DMODE, it's a big help in pulling this off As
far as adding an IBM drive, it shouldn't be any problem, make sure the jumpers
in the drive are set right. Also, be sure and check the controler ribbon
conectors.  These may have to be changed as TANDY decided to leave out a few
pins on some of them making accessing side two immpossible.
  Back to the original subject.  DMODE will change your drive configuration for
you while using that drive.  The easiest way to do this is to type DMODE /d0
sid=2.  Then FORMAT /d1 a new disk. It will be double sided.  Put your original
disk back in and run CONFIG.  Your new boot that will be on your new disk will
cointain the double sided drive module. Then DSAVE /d0 /d0 ! SHELL.  This will
copy the filess from your single sided disk to your double sided one.  Do the
same DSAVE again with the BASIC09 disk. All you OS9 directories are now on one
disk, this should help out with BASIC09 problem as well as saving some trouble.
Give me a call back and let me know how it turns out.

As Stephan stated, the FD502 is a 360K disk drive.  Check your connectors in
the case to make sure that the pins are not pulled.  If they are you can make
another cable using the standard connectors and 36 wire ribbon.  You will have
to remove two wires from one side of the ribbon.  The controller for the disk
drive as far as I know can only support double density disks, that is 360K or
720K.  I accidently bought a 1.2 Meg disk drive and used it in my
configuration, and found out that it wouldn't work.  Fortunately I found
another person who had a 720K drive, and swapped with him.  The problem, was
that the 1.2 Meg drive has a data transfer rate that is higher than the
controller could handle.  Maybe that problem has been resolved by now, but
check here before you do it.

Erich, Just a note to my note.  Try using COBBLER insted of CONFIG.  COBBLER
makes an exact duplicate of your OS9BOOT with any changes that you have made
while online, ie. DMODE sid=2, XMODE, TMODE, etc.  Then use DSAVE as previously
stated.  Another reason to use it is you don't have to go through all that
trouble you would for CONFIG, switching disks, selecting modules, etc. If you
need DMODE, I can get it for you, I'm not sure if it's in this DataBase or not
(I think it's Freeware, hope I didn't just offer the wrong thing in fornt of
God and the whole world <grin>.)  To get the correct syntax for DMODE, just
type DMODE /D1 and it will list the parameters.  Hope this is some help to you,
Talk to you later.

Ohhhhhhhh.  DMODE is in a SIG.  No wonder I couldn't find it in my Lvl2 manual.
I was getting ready to ask you if you had the command right or if you're using
Level 1, 3 or 4.  I'll see if I can find it in a LIB here. As long as it is not
ar'ed I can get to my OS-9 disk.  I have a copy of Sterm I will use to get ar
et.al. later, but I have to re-reconfig to be able to use that (cf. CoCo Forum,

Erich,  If you have any problem with the DMODE.ASM, I'll be happy to upload my
DMODE without the AR, it's fairly short so it shoudn't be too much to down load
fo you.  Another good one to usee is WMODE, does the same thing to your screen
settings. You would be able to boot up with an 80 or 40 column screen if you
desire.  If I can be of any further help, just call.

Another question,

I just installed in my COCO 3 a modified RS-DOS chip that accesses my drives at
6 ms. I also have my device descriptors set-up to run all my drives at 6 ms.
However, when I boot OS-9, here's what happens: I type DOS, the drive runs at
6ms UNTIL the OS-9 BOOT message appears then they switch back to 30 ms until
the OS-9 startup message appears then they go back to 6ms. Is there any way I
can keep my drives at 6ms through the ENTIRE boot-up process?

This seems pretty weird to me! (what else is new *;-> )

Thanx,

Bob - yes, it's the BOOT module going at 30ms.  Try this patch:

 00C0 03 -> 00
 017C 03 -> 00

Let's see. You'd have to patch BOOT in memory, then os9gen or cobbler a new
bootdisk (unless you have ways of patching the kernel on track 34... possible,
if you go look for the Boot module up there). - kev

Does OS9Gen or cobbler correct the CRC when either one of them are re-creating
the boot?  Wouldn't changing 03 to 00 at 00C0 and 017C cause a problem in OS9's
CRC verification?

Bob - yah, REL, BOOT, and OS9p1 aren't in the os9boot file.  They're stored
on track 34 of the bootdisk (emulating normal OS9 computer ROMs, in a way).

Do you have modpatch?  Try that, then the os9gen/cobbler.  A modpatch file
would look something like:

l boot
c 00C0 03 00
c 017C 13 10
v

That would link, change, and verify.  Perhaps someone else with more modpatch
experience can jump in with more details?

~ Stephen,
  You need to fix the Init module, or use the one from the original FS2 boot
file.  If you want to fix your current Init module, all you have to do is patch
the byte at offset $000C.  Change it from a $0F (or whatever) to $0C, and then
verify the CRC.  That should fix you up.

There were one or two games which assumed coco's could only go to 512K... and

Bob - Basic can call assembly language subroutines, so should be possible to

I'm just thinking of the 6809 docs.

The parameter passing from basic is shown in the basic manual... the C
functions would just have to be wrapped up in a subroutine module. I know a

Bruce, According to a review published in Rainbow Mag. May/89 the printer
drivers for DMP110, CGP220 and others was available as P/N 90-0911 for $19.95
from most RS outlets ?. I recently succeded in getting the DMP430n driver,
included in the Publisher package to work quite well with my CGP220 (640 dpl)
which corrosponds to Publisher output format by changing offsets 247,248 and
25C,25D from 0320 to 0280 plus a little tinkering with offsets 4D,4E to adjust
the L margins more to my liking the only problem still present is that when
borders are selected the right border is just off the paper like at column 82,
Hi I suspect the DMP110 would probably work ok with the 640 dpl setting I use
but with only say 2/3 of page printed, while using 03C0 (960) at above offsets
would probably break up Publishers output.

I believe you can for one of your drives.  You will have to reconfigure your
OS-9 for a new drive descriptor.  I know this can be done on the FD-502. BTW,
are you also using DECB?  I don't know how your new drives will affect DECB if
at all.  I don't have 720K drives; I found this out in my PACKing in Basic09

DECB is the deck on which they serve the Columbian coffee... er.. (sorry -
early and pre-coffee here!).. actually, it's the acronym for Disk Extended
Color Basic. It's the maximum Radio Shack Color Computer configuration (that
is, before OS9 showed up). It involved the original Color Basic Rom, the
Extended Color Basic Rom (mostly graphics and enhanced string handling), and
the Disk Basic Rom (which was mounted in the controller). A total of 24K of
Basic/OS. The ROMS resided at $A000, $8000, and $C000 respectively in the 64K
address map.

You've already been told what DECB is.  Why might you want to use it?
1. There is a lot of software for DECB for sale and available for you to
download in the CoCo Forum.
2. It is not as powerful as OS-9's Basic09, but you can do a lot with DECB,
and programming in DECB is at least to some extent easier than in Basic09.
As soon as you turn on your CoCo, you probably see something like
   DISK EXTENDED COLOR BASIC 2.1
at the top of your screen.  You could say that DECB "boots up" in milisec-
onds.  Just go through the Extended BASIC manual that came with your CoCo
and you can begin writing (simple) programs in an hour's time.  Becoming
well acquainted with DECB can help you understand Basic09 better.  And
your Extended BASIC manual is designed to help teach you programming,
whereas the Basic09 section of the OS-9 Level II manual better serves as a
reference for those who already know what they're doing.  Also, high res-
olution graphics is a lot easier to accomplish under DECB than Basic09.
I use both, but some users have totally left DECB for OS-9 (and not without
some good reason).  BTW, there is a program called R.S.B. that lets you run
DECB under OS-9.  I don't have it, though.

If you're into burning  your own ROMs, then you could patch in the necessary
autoboot from floppy.  I know a fellow over in Ft. Worth that set up his
floppy-based system so that when he powered it up, it would check to see if an
OS-9 Boot disk was in drive 0, and if it was, it would boot from it.

I've got a RS FD-501 controller and I understand that the proms for it are

better off investing in a new floppy/hard disk controller. Anyone have the

units?  Alternatively, does anyone have a hard/floppy controller for sale?  I'd
prefer one of the non-stop controllers.

David - sure can.  What you'll need to do is to hook up one at first (as /d1)
so that you can still boot from the 40tk drive until you've gen'd up a new 80tk
bootdisk.

The L-II disk has the descriptors needed, I think.  Something like "d1_80ds.dd"
or similar.  Or use "dmode /d1 sid=2 cyl=50 stp=3"  to make any /d1 double
sided, $50 cylinders (80tks), and 6ms step rate.

Hardware-wise, you should be able to just set the jumpers to the drive number,
and for HM instead of HS (head load on motor, not select), and plug it in.

Get them, then yell for help if needed.  At least half the people here must be
using them, altho perhaps have forgotten over time what they did to make a new
boot <grin>.  Like me.  - kev

Sb: Monochrome boot
Fm: Ian Hodgson 72177,1762
To: All

The addition of a second CoCo III with a monochrome monitor (the other one has
a CM8) has made it evident that I would like to attack whatever module has the
initial palette and sets montype during boot so I could change things. So, the
question is: what module(s)? What offset? Too bad; when I graduated to the CM8
a couple of years back I turfed all the window descriptors and boot files I had
so painstakingly set up for monochrome. Now that I need them back, they're not
there, sigh. Anybody know where to look?

Oh, a second question. While I was at it I got a no-halt controller and 3 in 1
board. I presume STERM is the way to go? DL'd it the other night but still
haven't cobbled together a power supply and DB25 to 10 pin header cable so
haven't trid it.

And a comment for those who may be looking for a printer: like many others I
was attracted to the Star NX1000 a couple of years back and bought one. Great -
at first. But it has the world's shortest printhead life (like some cars where
you replace the brake disks every second pad change you apparently need a new
printhead about every second ribbon on the NX1000). In addition to the one I
have here, we have 4 at work and they are all the same, so beware of low cost
as your only consideration. Symptoms of dead printhead: Grey (rather than
black) characters, even with a new ribbon, and poor dot registration that makes
the characters look fuzzy. I have 3 other (older) printers and there is no
problem with printheads even after 10 years in one case so I suggest you
consider the price of printhead replacement as part of the cost of the Star.

The fonts that you get with the Home Publisher are data fonts only.  They are
represented in graphics format and not in an 8 by 8 or 8 by 6 Also the STDFONTS
that come with OS9 have some control codes imbeded into the file to load the
character set into a buffer for the graphics window to use.  There is no way
that you can use the Home Publisher fonts from shell without doing some major

i've spent quite a bit of time reading the docs, and will continue to do so,
while i do want to switch over as soon as i can, i'm not in /that/ much of a

 the error 203 that i mentioned comes not from RiBBS, but from MenuEdit itself.
it'll set up it's black text on white background screen, print the MenuEdit
main menu, then error out with #203.

FidoNet RiBBS echo would be a good idea, except i haven't found a local node
that carries it here in columbus, oh.

For those of you that think IBM is too stuffy,  the following made it's way
into my incoming mail -

------ ------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: IBM Ball Replacement

Abstract: Mouse Balls available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit)

Mouse balls are now available as FRU.  Therefore, if a mouse fails to
operate or should perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement.
Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse
balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel.  Before
proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside
of the mouse.  Domestic balls will be larger and harder than foreign balls.
Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop-off method.  Domestic balls
are replaced using the twist-off method.  Mouse balls are not usually
static sensitive.  However, excessive handling can result in sudden
discharge.  Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used
immediately.
It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls for
maintaining optimum customer satisfaction, and that any customer missing
his balls should suspectmlocal personnel of removing these necessary
items.

To re-order, specify one of the following:

P/N 33F8462 - Domestic Mouse balls
P/N 33F8461 - Foreign Mouse balls

Now that Desert Storm is over, the story can finally be told...
 
  Inertial Guidance used in Iraqi missiles (for the layman)
 
  "...the missile inows where it is at all times.  It knows this because
it knows where it isn't.  By subtracting where it is from where it isn't
or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains
a difference,for deviation.  The inertial guidance system uses deviations
to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position 
where it is, to a position where it isn't, arriving at the position
where it wasn't, it now is.  Consequently, the position where it is,
is now the position where it wasn't, and it follows that the position
that it was, is now the position where it isn't.
  In the event that the position where it is now is not the position
where it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation (variations are
caused by external factors, and the discussion of these factors is not
considered to be within the scope of this report).  The variations being
the difference between where the missile is and where the missile wasn't.
If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be
corrected for by the Mark II sys em, however the missile must know where
it was also.  The 'thought process' of the missile is as follows:  
because a variation has modified some of the information which the missile
has obtained, it is not sur  where it is.  However, it is sure where it
isn't (within reason) and it knows where it was.  It now subtracts where
it should be from where it wasn't (or vice-versa) and by differentiating
this from the algebraic difference between where it shouldn't be and
where it was, it is able to obtain the difference between it's deviation
and it's variation, which is called ... error."

 ...This company also produces an extremely accurate 'command guidance
    system'...

I use Ron Lammardo's VEFIO command all the time for doing just that.

I believe it should be in Lib 10 here under VEFIO.AR.  Also might need WINFO.AR
subroutine module if that's not included with VefIO.

It allows you to snap any window to a file.  Then you can do what you want from
there (edit/print) with any tools you have.

When Dale wrote that article tho, there was no such tool, and I had to go
rummage through coco memory to snap out the pictures by hand <grin>.

I know that OS-9 can address the CoCo3's cassette port since OS-9 can make use
of the hi-res joystick interface.  But since I have only one program which uses
that interface, the cassette port goes almost totally unused. Can I use the
cassette port for a third floppy drive, a hard drive, a RS232 pak, a printer,
ordinary analog audio in or out, or just *something* useful?  Since the CoCo is
not exactly loaded with I/O ports and my 3-slot MPI can do only so much, I want
to get the most of what ports I do have. Any ideas?

One problem might be that any sounds also use the joystick chips, and so it
might be tough to use the cassette port for anything without possibly running
into trouble.

I think some have used the motor relay for things, tho.  Just POKE'd from
basic09 etc.  That give you any ideas?

One, yes.  I can use that relay to kick a bigger relay to turn on or off
something a little bigger than a cassette recorder.  I can have a PACKed
procedure doing that in the background, perhaps based on the current system
time or a command I might be able to create.  Do you know what that POKE is? I
have such a POKE that can be used in DECB, but I doubt that it would work in
Basic09.

Erich - not offhand, tho I'd guess that the same poke would work just fine
under basic09... it's to the hardware, of course.

There may even be a command for toggling that relay someone uploaded.  I'll
look.  Perhaps someone else with a better memory can check the poke address
also.  But give the one you have a shot and see if it works.

Good thing the source code is there:  I cannot unar files (or get a binary file

need RS's C Compiler to run it?  I have tried to get that but was told they

I thought your RELAY pgm had a RELAY.ASM in ASCII (as does DMODE.ASM).  After
reading your msg I found that was not the case, so I cannot presently access
your program at all.  I tried getting AR09.BIN but could never get it to work. 
I cannot get the current sterm since I cannot unar the ar'ed files and the
unar'ed is over 100K; my limit is 40319 bytes.  An earlier sterm was sent to me
unar'ed via CISmail.  I got it DOSOR9ed but cannot make it work on a true OS-9
formatted disk.  Several threads in the CoCo Forum describe what the problems
are and what I have done so far.  These include "ar Problems", "OS-9 reCONFIG",
"Preparing /d0/sterm" and one or two others. Set your message age selection far
enough back to search and read.  I think 60 days is far enough back.  But if I
don't get this resolved fairly soon I I will just have to call downloading
anything from this forum (and others with OS-9 pgms) to be a lost cause.

FWIW, those discussions should have been held here. What better place to
receive OS9 assistance than the OS9 Forum?

For starters, I'm making the following assumptions. Correct me where I'm off:

  a) You're using a RSDOS based terminal package
  b) You're using DOSOR9.BAS to move the files

Strategy: grab a small os9 terminal package that's tried & true to go after the
bigger stuff.

Preparation: You will need to have the IRQ Hack installed in your RS232 pak in
order to get satisfactory serial I/O under os9. Read the file in DL2 called
SERIAL.TXT for background. I may also have a separate file up there called
IRQHAK.TXT. Again - READ this/these for background.

Action: use your terminal program to go after Xcom9I.BIN (xcom9 - am Xmodem
capable terminal program that runs under os9 LI or LII), Xcom97.txt (the basic
manual for it) and Xcomch.txt to see what the special tweaks in Xcom9i.bin are.
All are plenty small enough to fit in 40K.

Next, use DOSOR9 to get Xcom9i.bin over to your os9 disk. Name it 'xcom9' and
place it in your /d0/cmds directory. Having done that, type: ATTR
/D0/CMDS/Xcom9 e pe [enter].

Read through the two Xcom9 doc files. Ensure that you have the IRQ hack
installed. For those fearful of soldering, a jumper clip may be used (wire with
dip hooks on each end) instead.

Set your T2 descriptor to the appropriate baud rate using Xmode (note: DON'T
'INIZ T2' before you do this). Then start up Xcom9 like this:
    Xcom9 /t2 [enter]

Xcom9 should start up and give you a status line. Don't worry about the
display. You can simply type the dial command you use to get onto CIS (ex:
ATDT5551212[enter]).

Once you've connected & logged on, you can initiate an Xmodem download of a
file by typing: DOW filenm.ext/proto:xmodem (from within the libraries of
course). Then setup Xcom9 to receive the file by typing the command key (either
Clear or CTRL @), X (for Xmodem), R (for receive), and probably B for binary
(forget....). You can now download directly to disk any sized file that will
fit there. I'd reccommend AR09.Bin and the Sterm package for starters.

My terminal program is Mikeyterm 4.7 running under DECB.  I transfer text files
with TRSCOPY and binary files by DOSOR9.BAS.  I do not have a RS232 pak; I am
using the DC modem pak.  I know that can be converted to a RS232 pak, but I
will lose my modem if I do that.  I have never successfully exported to OS-9 a
pure binary file.  If I run Ident on the DOSOR9ed file, I ALWAYS get a Module
header is incorrect! message, even if the CRC is good (it usually is good). 
Once I Copy the file to a disk that was formatted by OS-9, and then run Ident
on the copied file, I ALWAYS get a Moudule header is incorrect! message and
nothing else.  If I try to load it anyway, I will get an illegal module error
message.  The only hope I see is getting a ASCII Basic09 "loader" that will
"create" the program.

IF you are getting MODULE HEADER INCORRECT, it could very well be that the file
has Xmodem padding (xmodem rounds all files it transfers out so that they are a
multiple of 128 bytes in length). When you do IDENT on a file, IDENT reads the
module header, grabs the length and crc information, and then reads that far
into the file to see if the CRC is correct up to that point. If it is, and if
it is not at end of file, ident assumes that you have merged multiple modules
into a single file (which is perfectly fine). It then goes on to read the next
module header, but instead of seeing $87CD (header start bytes for os9/6809),
it sees Xmodem padding and complains that MODULE HEADER IS INCORRECT. This may
well be your problem.

The fix for this is easy:

 1. Move the file to your CMDS directory
 2. Set its attributes to E and PE
 3. Load the module (it's in memory now)
 4. Delete the 'padded' copy in your CMDS directory
 5. Use the SAVE command to save a copy back out to disk

Note: this is not REQUIRED. The LOAD command will only load in as many bytes as
look legitimate (i.e. length) anyway, so you could run programs even though
they have padding on them in the interim. Merging with padded files wouldn't
work though.

If you need a copy of the SAVE command (LII didn't have one), there's a PD copy
in DL9 or DL10.

If you're using LII and have Virq's active (you do unless you changed
something) and have the M1 descriptor and its driver in place, you should
probably be able to use the Modempak under os9 as well.

On the CoCo Forum, I have been told about the XMODEM padding.  When I try to
load these files, I get ERROR 205 (Illegal Module Header).  I thought I didn't
have a SAVE but in actuality I do.  The DC modem pak can be used under OS-9 IF
the module MODPAK is present.  When I reCONGIGed to add /m1, ACIAPAK made it to
the new disk but MODPAK did not.  I re-reCONFIGed adding /m2 and did get
MODPAK.  Beyond Basic09, I have not been merging modules.  My OS-9 is LII. 
This may soon be moot, however:  this morning, CoCo Fourm sysop Steve Wegert
offered to USMail me a copy of Sterm (no version specified).  If that doesn't
do the trick, nothing will.  So I might be getting up and running after all.

Baiscally, without the RS232 port you're dead in the water under OS9. You could
use your RSDOS terminal package, and then use DOSOR9.BAS (DL10) to convert the
snagged files over to os9.

I just bought a Disto Super Controller II with the 3 in 1 board (version 2.0).
It was part of a bunch of surplus stuff and is missing the RS232 cable. The
manual I got with it is for the 4 in 1 board. My problem is that I can't figure
out the pinout of the 10 pin RS232 header connector on the board. The pin
numbering in the manual doesn't seem to match because it shows only 2 pins N/C
but the 3 in 1 has 4 pins not connected. Also, the physical layout of the pins
is not given. With my eyes, tracing the wiring back through the buffer chip to
the ACIA is a daunting task. Can anyone help? All I want to do is to make up an
RS232 cable for the beast and get it working.

Also, the manual says it needs a 12V at 300mA power source. 300mA?????? That is
one heck of a lot of current. Has anyone actually measured it? I have a couple
of 9V transformers here rated about 100mA and would be happy enough to build a
supply rather than pay Radio Shack their price for a supply (which is no longer
in the catalog anyway).

Any takers? I've got STERM ready and waiting to go, but need to sort this one
out.

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

I'm considering adding some more muscle my VED text editor by permiting it to
access extension modules. The plan is to have a command os9exec() to a user
supplied program which could do "whatever". VED would pass a number of params
to the user program, including the start and end of the text buffer and
pointers to a number of internal routines (the menu routines, etc.). The user
program could then access the text in memory and use the same interface to make
a very transparent extension. I suppose a possible extension could be a
spelling checker...but that's not important.

Questions:

1. Under systems with MMUs is the memory of the parent process available
   to the child?

2. Just what kind of params should be passed to the child? The params would
   be accessed via argc, argv[] routines since I plan to have extension
   just be a standard C program; no complicated subroutines, etc.

So, any suggestions or comments?

Just remember that if you're planning to use argc/argv that all of your
parameters probably should be ascii-fied, and that the arglist still needs to
be terminated with a CR (or the parsing routines will go to Mars).

Dave, I read your file on downloading with DeskMate 3 but seem to still be
having trouble with it.  I usually use another term prog but my rs232 is not
working properly so I'm reduced to using the old standby, the Modem Pak. 
Anyway, I followed your directions, the screen says 'Xmodem Transmit Begun',
something like that, but nothing goes to the drive.  Any help would be
appreciated.

Be on the lookout for MFFCP.AR in Library #4 -- the latest complete package for
playing Standard MIDI Files under OS9/6809.

Two new programs:  MFF120 and MFPlay_mem.

New docs for MFF120, while the docs for MFPlay have been expanded to include
MFPlay_mem.

MFConv and MFPlay programs haven't needed updating but are included along with
original docs for MFConv for completeness.

Yep, now we can convert MFF1s to MFF0s!  And play 'em to boot!

--  Thx, Paul Seniura.

Well guys the waiting is almost over and my nerves are raw. The #$%@#$ fest is
once again upon us. I am as ready as I will be... which is to say I am 'not'
ready. However I will never be ready for these things, seems like a few extra
days would always help when in realality(sp?) it wouldn't. It's just like
money, time that is, no matter how much of it you have, you can always use
more.

We only have two booths at the show and that will not be enough to show all the

new goodies we will have. The TIGER will be the big hit of the show and to find

out about it you will have to go.

We will have a VERY special deal on the TC70 AT the show BUT if you call by
next Tuesday you can get it too.

I won't tell you what these are because my competition gets on here too. BUT
I'm sure that fellows that go to the show will post the info. If not you can
call Monday or Tuesday and we will tell you the deal.

I'll be back on after the show, have to get some sleep before the long drive in

the morning.

Hope to see you there.

Does anybody know of any financial calculator/amortization type programs in the
LIBS here?  I did a quick bro key:calculator in DL9 and the UG lib but didn't
turn up anything.

Anybody remember the formulae for calculating loan amortization?  I used to
have some cookbooks around, but can't find them anymore.

 Thanks,

Jim -

There's a reasonably good RPN calculator there (or it should be there). Much as
I hate real RPN calculators, I use it (and have ported it to both Unix and DOS)
for quickie calculations. Might also want to scan the UGLIB.

I'm a big fan of yours. I've only used your Musicbox program a couple of times
so far, but it looks great! I've done quite a bit on ORC, but my lack of a
multi-pak interface prohibits me from using that with disk, so your program was
the answer to a prayer. I am a serious musician, so your LYRA3.AR looked very
promising. My problem is that I can't get it to run. When I ident'ed the files,
I get a bad CRC on MUSIC.DAT . I used Mikeyterm to download. I have a 128k
coco3 with disk. I'm on a tight budget, so I am reluctant to download the whole
file again. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
