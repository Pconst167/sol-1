The problem is with my drive cable, the one that came with the FD-502. The
34-pin connector for /d1 could not reach the card edge on the drive.  I called
the dealer for help and I was told to zigzag-route the ribbon cable so that it
will reach.  He said it definitely will reach then.  And it did, only problem
was that I could no longer close the case with the ribbon cable now in the way.
So I called again.  This time he got a FD-502 case and the same drive I bought
and proceeded to try to make the cable reach and the case close.  And sure
enough he couldn't do it either.  He offered to have one of his people create a
new drive cable for me with a real FD-502 case and the same drive as a guide. 
A cable that will zigzag but will reach and still let the case close.  This
cable would completely replace the present one, incl. for /d0.  It's been
nearly a fortnight and I'm still waiting for the cable.  The delay may be
caused by delays in being able to ship some other items I ordered so it would
be in 1 big pkg, but I've not yet enquired.

    Good luck with it. I've built those cables myself; it's not too hard. There
are these connectors that you press onto the ribbon cable at any point you
want. They have teeth that bite through the cable; sort of like those blue
Radio Shack RS-232 connectors.

      I dial directly into a CIS node in Metuchen NJ via Atlantic (NJ) Bell. I
get no errors using X-Modem. That test that showed up the 3 errors; I was
downloading a file to ramdisk while doing all kinds of disk accesses and things
with the remote terminal just to see if I could lock it up. How many devices do
you have hooked to your IRQ line. I have 3 6551's and 2 disk controllers.

    So you've got basically the same amount of stuff on the line. Does yours
make errors if you start doing alot of things on a remote terminal while
downloading? I remember when I was getting lots of errors that taking the
RS-232 port to the printer off line seemed to decrease the errors. That didn't
make any sense to me as it shouldn't be generating any interrupts. I'm going to
try it with that pak pulled for kicks.

The office is served by GTE while the house is SWBT. Actually, I'm rather
pleased with the GTE merger. As a result, I can drop my dedicated long distance
line at the office and go 1+.  Contel could never say 'equal access'.

Hmmm Air Force & DIA, huh?  Got my intro to computers in the 60's when I was in
the Air Force & stationed at NSA.
   However, the real reason I jumped into this thread was: If you didn't get an
offer on the "286" board you mentioned in another area yet - I'll take it.  I
have a kinda home-built "XT clone" that could stand an upgrade.  Send me an est
of total cost (incl ship), and I'll mail you a check (unless someone already
grabbed it).

I heard about the GIMIX a time or two but I never knew that it used a 6809. 
For that matter, about all I know about it is that it exists.  I have no
objections to OSK coming of age.  I just wish, however, that uploaded files
that are not in a Lib (or Delphi topic (esp. New Uploads)) specifically set
aside for OSK be denoted as such in the description.  Just like all the
"(C3)"'s you see appended to the Group Names for old files in Delphi's CoCo SIG
denoting that the group is for the CoCo 3 only.  I've already wasted time and
money downloading some things that I can't do anything with only because I
didn't know it was OSK until I read the documentation. Since Delphi allows
descriptions to run on for multiple screens, typing an extra 3 letters at the
beginning or end isn't that much to ask for.  Not really even for CIS's
549-char limit on descriptions either.

I found it too!:-) Unfortunately I may find that installing it will be a
problem.  As the Ar remains unextracted I can't say for sure.  If the IPatch
calls for the original CC3Disk.dr, I'm not going to be able to complete the
installation. I have already patched CC3Disk for use with PC-DOS/RS-DOS and I
do not want to lose that patch.  With that patch being an IPatch as well (and
the doc for the PC/RS-DOS CC3Disk patch does call for the original) I'm not
going to be able to reinstall the IPatch if I IPatch the original for caching. 
And if both want to change the same bytes even constructing a table to keep
track of both patches to facilitate manual rebuilding of the module....!  So if
the caching IPatch will not work with my patched CC3Disk, I have to wonder if I
will have any alternative short of creating and maintaining two separate boot
disks--a normal one and one for when I want to use PC-DOS or RS-DOS.

For users of MFCONV (Thanks, Paul), the song "Until the Real Thing Comes Along"
(MIDIFORUM - DL10 - UNTIL.ZIP) is a real nice addition to a music library - I
enjoy it!  I'm using MFF120, MFCONV, and MFPLAY with a Roland MT32 and used
MFCONV to select the intended instruments, and move the drum channel from 3 to
10, but there was one sour sounding drum beat. Exploring with trace and MTMIDI,
the offending sound was found to be MT32's sound called Electric Snare Drum.  I
have a short Basic09 routine to change from Electric to Acoustic Snare in the
CMF0 file - any interest??  Ches.

Hi all... To all those who downloaded the version of Snap.ar in the database ,
check the size of the AR. If it is 7424 bytes long, or if the Module CRC for
your Snap file is not $850691, delete it! Don't risk using it and possibly
destroying something. I wanted it removed from the database the day after I
uploaded it, but nothing has happened so far. The proper AR is 7420 ($1CFC)
bytes long and the proper Snap Module CRC is $850691. It has been uploaded, but
has not yet been posted. When you get it, NOTE: Read the docs! You MUST have
the 25 line patch installed. Snap will crash big-time on a stock window system.
I may write a small-screen version - wouldn't be too hard... Also, you MUST
have Winfo in your CMDS dir.
