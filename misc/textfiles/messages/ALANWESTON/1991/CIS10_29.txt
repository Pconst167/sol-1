Keith - info on G-Windows?  What do you need to know?  Ed Gresick can probably
tell you anything you wish... he had it running on his System IV at the fest.

I, for one, would also like to hear about some of the accomplishments of the
two other OSK box distributors. Far and away, Paul has posted more information

Ev - I think others have mentioned how to get gshell 1.24.

Umm... memory utils... do you have mmap and pmap?  Do a "bro util*" in Lib 10
and download the three files you find.  They're some tools to help see what's
going on.

Kevin,

Might Everett's lockup problems while using Gshell and his BBS simultaneously
be caused by the fact that Gshell shuts off interupts when the menu bar is
rolled over from menu to program and back to menu?  Also, doesn't the Hi-Res
Mouse adaptor cause CC3IO to shut down interupts while it's calculating the
"pointer" position?  Seems like you mentioned these to me some time ago, when I
was having trouble keeping my GShell and my terminal program going at the same
time.

MMap is pretty straight forward.  It shows the use of the 64 (or more, if you
have a fixed mmap and more than 512K) 8K blocks in your system.  Example:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
 #  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
 0  U M M M M U M U M M U U M M U M   <-- boot modules and commands
 1  M M U M M M M M M M M M M M M _
 2  M _ _ _ M M _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 3  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ U U M   <-- video mem and kernel

They're arranged in hex layout.  The upper left is block $00, the bottom
rightmost is block $3F (63).  "M" means the block is being used for modules(s).
"U" means it's just used for data/graphics.  "." means you don't have any
memory there, and "_" means the block is free.

OS-9 loads the bootfile and commands into the lowest free block numbers. On the
CoCo-3, the uppermost blocks are allocated downward for video memory, because
graphics memory must be contiguous.

You can use the output of "dirm" or sometimes "mdir e" to check and see what
modules are in what block numbers.  The main use for "mmap" is to get a better
visual feel of where your memory blocks are going to :-)

BTW, your mmap output will probably bogusly show "U" where mine has "M"s in the
first few blocks... that's because the original CoCo L-II had to do some tricks
to allocate bootfile memory.

PMap is far more informative.  It shows which block numbers are allocated (and
where they will be mapped) for each process.  It visually demonstrates that
data memory is mapped in at the bottom of each process' 64K map, and that
modules are mapped in a the top.  It also lets you diagnose problems where you
run out of process map memory (error 207).

  ID   01 23 45 67 89 AB CD EF  Program
 *---  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  -------
   1   00 .. 05 01 02 03 04 3F  SYSTEM   (kernel)
   2   07 .. .. .. .. .. 08 09  shell
   3   0A .. .. .. .. .. .. 0D  PMap
   4   0B .. .. .. .. .. 08 09  shell
   5   12 .. .. .. .. .. 08 09  shell

Here, we see that the kernel itself has allocated blocks 0,5,1,2,3,4 and $3F.
Combined with SMap, we can know exactly how much memory the system can still
allocate for the kernel (for proc descriptors, etc), and we see one empty spot
where another 8K block (or module) could be mapped/linked in.

The shell module is obviously merged in with other modules, in blocks 8,9...
because we can see it mapped in all shell procs.  But each shell has a
different data block (on the leftmost of its line).

The ID is the process id number.  The numbers across the top are useful for
people heavy into debugging/etc... they give the logical address within the 64K
maps.  That is, the first 8K block is from $0000-$1FFF.  The second 8K block is
from $2000-$3FFF, and so on.

PMap is pretty handy with Basic09 stuff... because you can see your basic09 map
getting filled up as subroutines are linked in (like gfx2, etc).  Ask again
about anything that seems unclear. - kev

How do I use the "eof" syntax in basic09 to find the end of file on a diskfile?
Do I have to read the entire file to get the end pointer? This is using random
access by the way I want to set up a checking account file. when I update I
want to add to the end of the file I am familar with disk basic files and know
how to use "eof" there. I am trying to learn basic09 because it looks very

The best way to do what you're after is to use a getstat call to determine the
current length of the file.  Check out the syscall procedure, along with page
8-113 in the CoCo 3 OS-9 Technical Manual.

Denise,

Basic09 is neat.  Great for writing quick little tools and packing them into
new commands.  One way to seek to the end, is to use the Syscall subroutine
to access a low-level OS-9 status call, to get the filesize.  Then seek
to that spot and start adding on from there.

WARNING: seeking to a higher
number will always expand the file to that size.  Do NOT do something like
a "seek #path,4000000" because it'll try to grab 4 megabytes from your
disk... and all you can do is wait until it gets it or errors out <grin>.
Anyway, here's a sample you can run on a small ascii test file you've made:

PROCEDURE filesize
TYPE stack=CC,A,B,DP:BYTE; X,Y,U:INTEGER
DIM regs:stack
DIM path:BYTE \(* BYTE not INTEGER in this case

DIM I_GetStt:BYTE \I_GetStt=$8D
DIM SS_Size:BYTE \SS_Size=$02

INPUT "file ",f$ \ (* get a test file name that exists
OPEN #path,f$

regs.A=path
regs.B=SS_Size
RUN syscall(I_GetStt,regs) \ (* get the filesize

high=regs.X
IF high<0 THEN 
high=65536.+high
ENDIF 
low=regs.U
IF low<0 THEN 
low=65536.+low
ENDIF 
filesize=high*65536.+low
 
PRINT "filesize=",filesize \ (* print the filesize
SEEK #path,filesize \ (* seek to end of file
PRINT #path,"*test" \ (* optionally, add a string to the file
CLOSE #path
END

set, plus postage. Let me know what you think. He is on Delphi,
 so if you do not have an account there, let me know and I will contact him.
 I am inclined to tell him to send them to me C.O.D. and then wait for your

be waiting for your reply. With all best wishes, Br. Jeremy, CSJW ps. I also

 Hi Steve,

 Yes, it has been a while.

 We've just been quietly selling and shipping machines.  There are some
 new things in the works and we'll announce them when we're ready.

 But, we are getting ready to announce G-Windows.  I see Frank (FHL) has
 already posted the 'sales pitch' for G-Windows.  And he's done a good
 job of describing it.  We do have one advantage with the SYSTEM IV over
 the TC-70, better resolution - up to 1024 x 768 x 256 if you want it.
 I'll post details soon.  We are also looking at another GUI/Windowing
 system.  Quite a bit different.  Can't say whether it's better or not -
 this is a very subjective thing.  Also, we have an in-house project for
 a TUI/Windowing system for text only systems in the works.  Be very
 similiar to a GUI except it's designed for all but the dumbest text
 terminals.

 Re K-Windows for the SYSTEM IV, you might want to 'observe' to Kev to
 'get on the ball' <g>.

 Hi Steve,

 Yes, it's me again - twice in one day.  Perhaps your request for updates
 was transmitted to the 'powers to be' re G-Windows via mental telepathy.
 At any rate, some good news.  We reached an agreement this afternoon.
 All that needs to be done is sign the paper work.  In the meantime, a
 Port-Pak should be in my hands in about two weeks and we can do the formal
 port.  Shouldn't take too long.  A demo package will be available shortly.
 Additionally, we will be offering a separate package for programmers who
 wish to write software to run under G-Windows.  This will provide hardware
 independence!

 I'll have a formal announcement up in a couple of days.

It took me a while to figure it out for I had no docs at all when I first got
sterm, albeit an older version.  Both my original 1.2 and the new 1.5 work the
same way.  First hit a ctrl-break to generate the ESC character. Release the
keys.  Then press the letter.  Example (to change directory): Press and hold
CTRL, then press BREAK.  Release both.  Press and release D. sterm now asks for
the new directory, which is where your downloads will be put until you change
again.  Do this Ctrl-Break twice in succession if you need to send an ESC
character over the modem.

Sb: #Disk format advice
Fm: Barry L. Bond 72235,1530
To: All

Long lost greetings!

     I'm back seeking advice!  Disk formats are among my least knowledgeable
areas of OS9.  I have a TC70 and would like to write some backup data to 5.25"
floppy disks in a format (std?  stdd?  <grin>) which would be best should I
ever decide to read these disks on another OSK system (System IV, MM1, or even
a VMEbus system).

     What descriptor settings/format should I use to best accomplish this goal?

     I'm still financially unable to be here with the frequency I used to be,
but I'll be popping through every now and then!  Just a warning!  :-)

 Hi Barry,

 Long time no talk - hear you have a UUCP link going?  Care to share
 details?

 Assuming you have Version 2.4 of OSK, the recommended format (by MW) for
 media interchange is the Universal Format - 16 sectors/track all tracks,
 track and sector offsets of 1.  If you want to interchange disks with
 people who don't have 2.4, I suggest using the 'MIZAR' format.  This is
 16 sectors/track all tracks, track and sector offsets of 0.

 Stay in touch.

Sb: Pulling MultiVue Apart
Fm: Erich Schulman 75140,3175
To: ALL

Exactly what does the Autoexec file in MultiVue do?  I would like to be able to
use my MultiVue boot disk for all OS-9 boots rather than just for launching
MultiVue.  If it is not necessary to keep autoex as autoex, I'd like to rename
it to StartMV or something like that.  Then I can use a utility I found called
OptStart so that on bootup I can press the space bar to launch MV or not press
it to boot normally.  And if I want to use MV later in a session, I can type
/d0/cmds/StartMV rather than putting the MultiVue boot disk in /d0 and typing
reset<CR> to reboot.  Also, whenever I quit MultiVue, the screen clears and my
pointer is where I last left it. But there's no OS9: and the system is totally
locked up.  To make the aforementioned more useful, it would help if I can
return to OS-9 instead of having to reboot.  All this nearly makes MV a 3rd
operating system to me. Is there anything I can do?  Finally, the manual states
a limit of 5 devices may be defined.  Is this 5 RBF + 5 SCF devices =10 total
or 5 total devices whether RBF or SCF?

In "The Rainbow Guide To OS-9 Level II:...", the author talks about /dd and
mentions that it's possible for /dd to point to a RAMdisk since /dd is merely a
copy of a device descriptor.  Since this is a change I want to effect, can I
make a copy of my /r0_256.dd and patch to name it DD, then insert it into my
os9boot where I now have /ddd0_40d.dd?  If my scheme won't work, what ought I
do instead?

Yup, that should work fine (patching a copy of R0 to be DD).  Of course, make
sure your startup file doesn't do any /dd references <grin>... unless the
needed files are already copied out to the ramdisk.

The only problem I can think of, would happen if your Init or Sysgo modules had
been patched to look for /dd.  Just take a look at them and make sure.

I've never patched Init.  I don't have a SysGo but my CC3Go has never been
patched either.  (Were you thinking of Level 1?(g)).  Why would these be
patched to point to /dd?  My guess is for those who have a hard drive and want
a ddh0_80.dd or whatever, right?

Fm: Erich Schulman 75140,3175
To: ALL

I've been using STerm 1.5 with the Quick-B option enabled, and whenever I
download in Quick-B I get a lot of errors, esp. in the beginning of the
transfer.  On a 100K file, STerm's error count increased much faster than the
block count for the first 15K or so, then slowed down--but I had errors til the
end.  This problem happens with every download in Quick-B and never happens
with a download in regular B where I may have downloaded files as large as 200K
with no errors.  These downloads are usually at 2400bps though I have tried
1200.  I used esc-d to set the directory to r0 prior to logging on.  I am using
/t2 under ACIAPAK with an expanded buffer though I intend to install SACIA
soon.  The RS-232 pak is the "Marty Goodman pak" sold by CoCoPRO! and the modem
is a Supra 2400 which does not support compression or error correction.  Is
there anything I can do about this problem?

   Along this thread: I installed the newest version of STERM (1.5?) and also
SACIA and am using a Disto Deluxe RS-232 pak. When downloading with Quick-B to
/r0 I get about 1 error every 10 blocks; not as many as Eric but I used to get
NO errors. Seems to me this corresponded in time to when CIS changed their
library software again. Any ideas?

Interesting Paul!

While it's easy to pin the blame on the XDL software recently installed, I've
not heard of anyone else (outside our forums) reporting protocol type errors.
And wouldn't have expected to, either. But I'll keep my eyes peeled.

I'd look towards anything that may be different on your setup. Are you running
any background process while downloading? Do you get the same errors while
uploading?

What did you use before installing SACIA? Were you using the irqhak at the
time, and now have discontinued it's use because of SACIA?

Get the magnifying glass out, and look for the obvious. It's generally the
culprit with things like this.

(By the way .... I've not experienced any problems with errors after the XDL
software came down. But I'm also using the irqhak.)

Erich,
 I don't know of an "undelete" utility per se, but have used "fsedit" to get me
out of a jam or two. It requires a pretty good understanding of the os9 file
system and can really mess up a disk if not used carefully. It most definitely
*can* be used to "undelete" a file, assuming the blocks freed up by the
original delete (unlink()) have not been re-used.
 You will have to run "dcheck" and let it fix the thing after you "undelete" a
file because you will now be using blocks marked as free.
 I would download it (I *think* it was in the utilities database) and
experiment on a floppy disk that you format and "dsave" a few files and
directories to so you can trash it and just re-format and start over.
 Of course, you would want a complete backup before "fixing" anything with
"fsedit".
 Good luck (you'll need it)!

     Here's a real wierd problem.
       I have a Coco3 with 1Meg memory, kernal patch installed to
    recognize this memory;
       Disto SCII no halt floppy controller with 3 in 1 board
    installed. The serial port here is /t3 and is connected to
    a remote terminal at 9600 baud. CC3Disk.slp is the driver
    used with the controller. SACIA is the driver for the serial
    ports;
       Another serial port /t2 which is one of those DCM kit
    things. This is connected to a printer;
       Another serial port /t1 which is a Disto Deluxe RS-232 pak.
    This is connected to a modem;
       A Burke & Burke CocoXT hard disk adapter connected to a
    58 Meg MFM hard drive.

       Here is the problem: Everything worked fine until I hooked
    up a remote terminal to /t3. If I boot up the system all is
    well. If I go 'shell i=/t3&' all is still well and I get an
    OS9 prompt on the remote terminal. If I run any commands from
    the remote, like mdir which works fine, the next time I go to
    make a disk access from the host, the system locks up. A disk
    access from the remote also locks up the system. There are no
    "sparklies" when it locks up but the keyboard will not respond
    and I can't change windows with the 'clear' key. As long as I
    don't send any commands from the remote, the disk accesses work
    normally. I am using Shell+v2.1 if that matters.
       Any help would be greatly appreciated.
