Joerg,

The cross-library searching will be introduced in all forums, sooner or later.
Forums rotate as to which ones are test forums for new stuff, and we're just
not on that list right now :-)  So hang on, shouldn't be long before all forums
have that feature.

PS: speaking of keywords, have you ever tried this: just typing "key" in a
library?  It lists all the keywords people have used.  Sometimes handy.

Joerg,

Latest on the across library search software is that it hits the general forums
mid to late October. As a result of the testing you've run across in the UNIX
forum (and a few other beta sites) a few more performance issues are being fine
tuned.

Hang in there!

 In other words, it ain't ready, yet.  But they're working on it.

Just FYI, Joerg, all of the forums run the same software, in general.  There
are some forums that are beta testing upcoming software features/bugs, so what
happens in one forum will generally propagate to all of the forums in due time.

Thanks Roy. I'm not sure exactly what the code is doing -- I'll have to print
it out and study. Yes, I was the one wanting to do the longjmp() out of the
intercept (well, I don't nesc. *want* to do it, I was trying to find out if I
could and don't forget that this started with just wanting to do I/O in the
intercept which I guess is okay now). But with all the problems being created
it might be better to forget the longjmp() stuff and just do an exec() or
whatever and restart the program. It seems to me that this would ensure a
cleanup. Guess that one could pass some params to the 'new' program telling
that this is a re-start -- might even use a data module for intitialized
variables.

Dear Friends:

Recently, I was given a Harddrive packaged by the Integra Company. It contains
a Seagate 178N HD and power supply. While it is originally for the MAC the
internal cable mate up with the cable from my DISTO 4-in-1. It is possible that
there may be a sector problem on the HD, but I was able to get it to lowlevel
format under RSDOS. Here begins, the problems. I have had the SC-2 and 4-in-1
hooked to my COCO3 with 512k and a model 26_3124 Multipak for almost two years.
The only part of the 4-in-1 that I have used so far is the RTC. This did not
require the nine volt power supply to work. I plugged in the nine volt adapter,
supplied by DISTO and I could no longer get a directory under RSDOS or OS9. If
I turned the power supply off, then I could get it. Next I booted up OS9. I
loaded in the following modules and CMDS from the DISTO disk:
cchdisk_SCSI_LII.dr, h0_4in1SCSI.dd, and HMODE. I then did an mdir and got:

I loaded format, and made sure it was then, I typed Format /h0 r

Well if you don't want to longjmp, the next program lets you return.  Both

The only reason why I pointed this out is because my local Tymnet node seems to
prefer that I use ALL CAPS when I call to logon to Delphi. When I go to log on
there, I normally set all caps first and then start the term program.  Since
fixing the problem is, I don't believe, a major change, perhaps a small IPatch
would be more appropos than a big reupload.

Erich,

There are many OS9 programs that have case sensitive arguments. This is even
more prevalent with OSK, the "ls" command distributed with the MM/1 has
arguments that _must_ be specified as upper case. I know of several programs
for which arguments with the same letter mean totally different things as upper
or lower case.

I see that in this case :), Mark has elected to change Sterm to be case
insensitive, which, as the program author, is his choice.

Normally, case sensitivity in a program does not bother me.  It's just that
with a terminal program, I was hoping for insensitivity because a service I use
a lot "prefers" all-caps for my logons.  Since Ultimaterm always puts me in
all-caps as soon as I drop into terminal mode, I wanted to continue along this
line by being in all-caps as soon as STerm has me in terminal mode.  I've found
that under Ulterm, if I call CIS before them, I usually forget to restore all
caps and am not reminded until Tymnet refuses to get me through.  And Tymnet
won't let me through to the service unless my full logon procedure is
absolutely flawless.  One lowercase or mistyped character and I have to hang up
and redial.  I did complain to their customer service. They acknowledged the
situation but said there is nothing they can do about it.  My sole intention of
starting the thread was for purposes of easier OS-9 logon to that service, not
to stir up trouble.

But of course - and now you have just explained how the fool thing got to be
different!  I just switched to a 2400 baud modem.  Wonder though why the 300
baud did the same because I have occasionally used that rate for mail browsing

software ignoring the fact that at least on here it is of no consequence to
probably the majority of the users.  Oh well.

Microsoft isn't doing OS/2 anymore, they've completely pulled away from it. The
beta version of OS/2 v2.0 is the only version of it there will ever be. IBM is
continuing without the support of Microsoft, but you can imagine how far that's

 Ever since I got my CoCo3 and OS9 Level II and CM-8 monitor, I have been
disappointed by not being able to use my D.L. Logo the way I could on my CoCo2
with Level 1. So many things don't work anymore, especially the color, but also
the SSC and the SAY primitive. I got around the problem with the SAY primitive
by booting Level I again, but I still would like to get color back with my
CM-8. I'm pretty fair at assembler, though I don't have an assembler for OS9.
The various tricks around for changing the use of artifact colors haven't
seemed to work on D.L. Logo, so I'm wondering if I could somehow disassemble
the program code and find a way to use the newer color modes. I realize this is
a long shot, but I miss my turtle so much. I want to teach my kids Logo, but I
don't want them to have to go through the hastle of unplugging the CM-8 and
plugging in a TV whenever they want to push the turtle around. Any thoughts?

 I may be wrong, but the last time I had a CM-8 and a TV plugged in

it has something plugged in the CM-8 port and can't do the artifacting when it

Pete,
 OK, I went and specified /M1, which, of course, didn't work since my Deskmate
boot disk doesn't load that driver, neither does it load /T1. I do have the
DCM-6 modem that hooks into the bit banger. I assume this is /T1.
 What is the best way to add /M1 to my Deskmate configuration?

Ugh...

Essentially you'll need to build a new bootfile using your favorite tool (i.e.
either OS9GEN, COBBLER, or CONFIG).

I believe that M1's associated driver is ACIAPAK. If that is true (you can do a
'dump M1' on the M1 device descriptor module on your disk and verify that it
says ACIAPAK), if your standard kernel already has ACIAPAK in it, you're not
too far off.... You can put the disk with M1 on it in the drive and type
something like:

   load /d1/modules/M1.dd

to get it into memory, and then insert your deskmate disk into a drive and type
something like:

  cobbler /d? (where ? is the target drive)

If none of this looks like it will work, you'll need to 'hand build' a new
kernel. That involves taking your current bootfile, splitting it into modules
(get the bootsplit utility in DL9 or DL10), making a list of them, and then
adding the M1 to both the list and the group of modules. Then you'd use OS9Gen
to glue them all together again, uisng the list to drive OS9Gen's input.

Let me know how (or if) you fare....

 You've given me some more things to try. I tried using "config" but it didn't

"cobbler".

I checked under the key of "tail" as that seemed most likely to "hit" if the
program is there.  I did this in Libs 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11.  I even checked Lib
12 even though I can't support it.  Delphi has something like that for the
68000 only so I thought I might see if your util would be a 68000 thing as
well.  In all the Lib searches I came up empty.  As I do have the catalog files
for most Libs downloaded, I'll make a more exhaustive offline search.

If that's the case, then perhaps it's in the great bit bucket. The procedure
Bruce Mackenzie showed you is essentially all you need to do. The same can be
done in BASIC or BASIC09 easily (in fact the original FED was written in B09).

If I still had a C Compiler on an 09 machine, I'd write you a quicky tool.

Erich,
 If you have access to a C compiler the following should do the trick:

 #include <stdio.h>

 main()
 {
      char c;

      fseek(stdin,129l,0);

      while(fread(&c,1,1,stdin) != 0)
           fwrite(&c,1,1,stdin);
 }

 This would produce a program that would copy a file from standard input to
standard output minus the first 128 bytes.  You'd call the program with i/o
redirection, ie chop <inputfile >outputfile.  By the way, thats an ell in 129l
not a one.  I would imagine you could do the same thing just as easily in
basic09 if you're not into C.

I have been wanting to get a C compiler but I no longer hold out any hope of
getting Tandy's.  Maybe the SmallC on Delphi will suffice.  With the source
code you gave I may be able to translate this into Basic09 as you had said.  So
far I've had little success with doing disk operations in B09 though I am
finally starting to "get the hang of it".  Despite the hassle of two transfers,
I also wonder about the potential of doing this under DECB.  The only binary
editing I've ever done in DECB is with a dEd-like disk zapper utility.

 You could do it in DECB but it would be a hassle.  I had a look at tail09.ar

If you have tsed or tsedit, you can edit a binary file with it.  Not really
easy to delete 128 bytes at the beginning, but possible.  Try a series of "8x"
commands (16 of them).  That will remove the 1st 128 bytes.

OS9, according to a discussion I had with Frank on this subject a few months
ago.

It'll speed up programs run on the 6809 by 2-3 times, Frank says
'conservatively' but a friend of mine, who repairs/works on computers for a
living, tell me more likely, according to the architecture, it should speed up
programs by 5 or 6 fold.

Qnx is written by Quantum Software , and I beleive their head office is in
Kanata , Ontario near Ottawa. I have seen ads from them in many pc type
magazines, and I beleive there is even a fido echo for them.
I havent checked for areas here or competeing services.
Qnx is a separate OS tho, it is unix-like but not dorectly compatible, or at
least that is what I have picked up from some of the other areas.

Btw I have used an application running under qnx many years ago. I wasnt
impressed, but it was running on a pc with a cassette port on it.

To the author of Aterm -->  Chris ?????

I apologize, but I deleted out your message and file to me before I saved the
number in my personal area (Guess being a recent new member shows...<G>)

Anyway, I tried out the version of Aterm you sent me, and it locked up my
system every time.  (No menu, no nothing....just a freeze up)

I did get Aterm to 'partially' work once using the aterm.ctl file, but I
haven't been able to duplicate my efforts again.  (The 'partial' working means
a menu came up, but nothing would work after that...)

Anyway, if you've some thoughts, maybe we can work on this further.

What type of machine are you using your 'home' version of Aterm on???

Hi Mark,

 I was playing with the source from STERM 1.5.1 (from lib 12) last night and I
finally got it to compile on my MM/1.  (It even works, using it at this
moment).  My compiled version is a little longer than the one in the archive,
most likely because I had to make my own "getopt.h" and a couple of ".r" - type
files for the linker.  Since I am not real brilliant in "C", this took a while.
Is there an enhanced library for OSK (like the Kreider libs for Level II on the
COCO) that I missed somewhere?

  My purpose for this exercise is mostly just to learn more about "C" and the
MM/1, next I'm gonna try to add ZMODEM to STERM.

  Are there any hardware hackers out there this weekend that didn't go to the
Fest??  Kev P. - are you out there?

  Does anybody know what the 48 pin chip marked BT478KPJ66 is on the MM/1 board
nearest the video out port?  Also see msg. #12492.

  If I could find out what it is and what it does, I might consider trying to
find a replacement this weekend and popping it in, as the one in my MM/1 blew
it's little brains out all over the inside of the case when I powered it on.

  I really don't want to be down for ANOTHER month!  H E L P !!

..Jim
