Br. Jeremy,
     GSHELL will let you execute almost any program in multiple windows on the
same screen provided you give it an icon file and an aif file in which you
define the window type as one of the graphics screens and in which you define
the minimum window size as something less than the size of the whole screen.  
Icon files and aif files are discussed in multivue manual.  I believe there is
an icon editor in LIB 10 here that will help you create an icon file.  Of
course the the particular program can mess you up if it opens a window on its
own and switches over to it.  Also, it's nice if the program puts a boarder
around the window, which GSHELL doesn't do automatically.

To have two windows on the same screen, simply DWSET the first one to some size
and position, using any screen type... and DWSET the others using type 0 (which
means: use my currently selected input window's screen).

Of course, you can't normally overlap them (unless you have a need to and don't
mind one possibly overwriting the others... turn off protection with DWProt (?)
to allow overlapping).

Muddy enough?  Just give it a try. - kev

Wayne,
 The problem wasn't here (or in STERM) after all. I didn't realize until later
that the backup (DeskMate) was also having trouble. However, while STERM
stopped recieving,and reported ever increasing errors, DeskMate closed the file
and pretended it was ok. Thanks anyway-

 Thanks for the help-both times. The big file problem wasn't really STERM, but
the service sending it, since DeskMate3 also didi the same thing, (twice) and
didn't report it, but just closed the file like it was ok. The puzzelment is
after the last valid block (while the #errors was counting along), there was no
way to break out except hanging up or zapping the window out from under it.
ESC-A didn't work,DeskMate didn't gripe, so I blamed the program for crying
wolf when it should have.

 Still not toally sure whats going on.It seems as though the first error marks
the end of a download.(ie: never completed a download with errors). And today,
a download crashed at 200 blocks, much shorter than many successful ones. The
crash at 400+ blocks I've (maybe) got a handle on, but this is a whole new
#$%&&#%$. Any reason the ESC codes would quit working? Or mebbe my machine is
crashing in some subtle way? It's a real hack-y cabled ModemPak with the rom CS

Rick,

A suggestion for you to try out. Play a bit over in PRACTICE forum downloading
some smaller files. It's free of connect time over there. That way you might
beable to spot a pattern without costing yourself a fortune in  connect
charges.

Watch for things like ... ASCII files downloading correctly and binary files
failing ... or the reverse. Watch the file size. See if there is some kind of
pattern there.

Double check your work on the modempak hack... loose connections?

I can't think of any reason the ESC codes should stop working. Start looking
for other problems ... perhaps hardware related.

Pete's got the syntax correct on mail to CIS, but just missed it on sending CIS
mail out. The interface is picky so:

>INTERNET:path

For intstance, to send me mail at my university account it would be:

>INTERNET:steve@wuarchive

The position of the bracket as well as the colon is critical.

Pete said it best: "Go EASY and type HELP INTERNET. It coveres all the bases.

No, Phil...doesn't matter where the braces go.

This line is also acceptable (but less readable) in C -->

inkey() {char c; read(0,&c,1); return(c);}


You might have probs reading that line 6 months later if you do it that way,
but it's legal.

Yup, It won't.  There is two fixes: 1) put a \n on the first string. If you
don't want to do that, 2) do a fflush(stdout); before the inkey. Actually,
there's four. 3) use writeln() or write() instead (I highly suggest this -
check out the difference in code size if you don't use any printf's!!) 4)
there's a way to tell printf to use read/write calls intead of readln/writeln. 
I think it's doc'd somewhere under fopen (?).

Personally, I do everything with read/write/readln/writeln.  Everything. Even
code I write on PC's - I have written a readln/writeln function for use there. 
The bottom line is - you're going direct to the system i/o. But the
disadvantage is you have to put everything together into one string (or make
multiple calls) and you don't have %d and %x.  But then, I've written routines
to do conversion to decimal and hex for printing too. It all depends on how
much of what you are going to do.  I hate mixing reads/writes and printf's, and
I prefer not to use printf's at all if I can help it, but sometimes there's no
better way.

Phil,

The statement _is_ executed, but the output generated by the statement is
"buffered". This means that the data is placed in a buffer, but not actually
output to the path (in this case its not displayed on the screen) until one of
several things happens: the buffer fills up, an end of line sequence (\n or a
CR on the CoCo), or the buffer is "flushed" using the fflush() function.

Phil,

Since you didn't include the whole program in your original message, I can't
say for sure, but if those were the only statements in your program, then the
buffer will get flushed when the path is closed (which I realize now I left out
of my last reply) when the program ends.

What I'm looking for is something to work like Basic09 inkey. I'm very new in C

Phil,
     Your function can easily be modified so as not to hang in the read:

 inkey()
 {
      char c;

      if(getstat(1,0)==0)
      {
           read(0,&c,1);
           return c;
      }
      else
           return -1;
 }

Here a returned value of -1 indicates that no key has been pressed.

I think that the Windex program files were mentioned in reference to a tutorial
that I downloaded some time back. If I have the correct name, these files were
some sort of window creator/manipulator program. I am trying to increase my

 Again, I think that these are the programs that I was refered to. I am looking

oh for those using Dynacalc under Level II gfx windows here is a fix for the

offset      old    new ------      ----   --00C4     FF FF FF   1F 20 FF 00CC
FF FF FF   1F 21 FF

what this does is use inverse command to highlight the column markers your
allowed about 6 chars for each so you could even change colors! I even used
boldface for graphics screens just to mess around.

Perhaps the x10 stuff could be combined with the Radio Shack x-10 based alarm

systems, but there are several components to it.
I am considering whether to go this route or to change from a coco pnp
controller to one of the tw523 (?) modules and dedicate a coco1.

The Circuit Cellar Ink is a good magazine to check out x10 and CEBus info by

Hi Bruce--when I put in the extra lines, the program acted like:

inkey()
      {
       return ;
      }

It didn't wait to pickup a keyboard entry.

Oh, I thought you didn't want your inkey to hang up if no key had been pressed.
If you want it to stop and wait for the next keypress then your original
function should work adequately.  Very often I need to check for a keypress and
if no key is pressed continue with some action.  In such a case having the
program hang in the inkey can cause problems.

So really, whats still troubling you is that printf() doesn't imediately output
your string to the screen.  Again, this is because all the standard library I/O
functions are buffered.  What this means is that rather than outputing the data
imediately to the device driver the functions store the data in memory first. 
They wait until the buffer is full or until a charage return occurs in the data
stream and then dump the data to the device driver in one block.  If you want
your data to go to the screen before the inkey you can force C to dump all the
data in the file buffer to the output device by giving a fflush() command.

Hi Paul,

Got my second 1.44m floppy drive today, thanks again for the quick help on
that.  My MM/1 now has some more "elbow room".  Now, if I could just take that
40m SCSI HD off the shelf and do something with it .... (meanwhile , I'm still
learning to use what I have already. )  I thought OddJob was a program, to me
it looks more like a programming language (and a big one too!).  Much to learn.
Sooner or later, there has to be a "Technical Manual" - I want to get on the
list for that one.  Keep up the good work!

Great going! You can try the diskcaching on your /d0 drive for your commands.
Then you can use /d1 for your data and so on.

OddJob is a language indeed, much like AWK and the UNIX C Shell, all rolled

I haven't had any problems either, and now that I have a PM9600SA, I have been
doing 9600 baud downloads on my MM/1. Maybe Jim's problem is related to line
noise (of course with the PM9600SA there isn't any). I do know that there are
some problems with the serial driver (SC68070), that _may_ be related to flow

You wanna see something fly... set your baud rate to 38,400 and dial up the
PM9600SA on the mainframe. The compression really makes a difference since your
PM9600SA will expand the datastream it receives at 9600 baud into a sizzling
38,400 to your interface.

After being offline for a week due to cutting the plug off my CM-8 and
replacing it with a DB-9, I'm baaaaaack!!

Coupla questions been burning for a while:

  1. Anybody got their I/O board yet?
     a. What kind of SCSI drive did you hook up to it?
  2. Anybody been able to select different fonts from the .BITMAP dir?
     I've tried all sorts of combinations of 'merge fontname.fnt', but
     stdfonts never seems to grow, and dump output never changes.
  3. Anybody gotten PCF working?  or have any ideas short of uploading
     30M worth of data to CIS and  tthen downloading to the MM/1?  File
     transfer with 3 computers and 2 monitors will be a cchallenge!!
     Preferred method would be PCCDOS to 5 1/4" from the CoCo and
     copy to 3.5" on the IBM, then PCF to the MM/1.
  4. Anybbody using DiamondScan or NEC monitors?  Is the improvement in
     resolution worth the cost of the new tube?
  5. Anybody gotten 'playm' to work yet?  All I get is a 237 error -
     "out of ram".
  6. Occasionally the computer will boot with a really weird colorset. mon
dTryingg   to setimmee oon a wwhhite on pale greeeen scrreenn isn't easy!
     Doing a plt restores the original colors.  Question is: what
     causes the palette controller to not reset to a known state?

  One final question that doesn't deserve a number as it's kinda rhetorical -
does ANYBODY actually LIKE uMACS or EMACS??  And here I thought VM/XEDIT was
arcane and cryptic!  Looks like Bob V. will do a land-office business as more

Well...it turns out that the floppy driver I have doesn't do sector sizes other
than 256, which means that PCF will have to wait a bit.  (I think Carl Kreider

Moving stuff over?  Well...I'll probably wind up doing it one of two ways:

1. Kermit from the CoCo to the VME box, which does have a 3.5" floppy drive,
   and go from there to the MM/1.

2. Kermit straight from the CoCo to the MM/1; it's logistical problems

Welcome back, Jim! :-)

1. I have two drives... a Seagate 157N and a 296N, I think.  But the Quantums
seem to be very popular.

2. The stdfonts module is simply a default.  Do like you did on the CoCo...
merge one of the fonts and use "display 1b 3a c8 xx" where xx is the buffer
number (yell if you've never done this on the coco).

3. I think PCF use is waiting on a newer floppy driver.  For transferring data,
I'd use a null modem between the computers, perhaps?  Or copy to coco disk, use
coco to xfer to pc disk for now.

4. Nah, not right now.  The CM-8 works well.  The DiamondScan is much brighter
for room presentations tho, I've found.

5. For playm, you'll need twice as much ram as the size of the sound file (for
conversion from mono to stereo data).  Oh. If you don't have the I/O board,
then you can't play those files anyway :-)

6. My fault on the boot to weird colorset, a glitch in setting things up,
somewhere.

Concerning fonts:

What you do is 1) merge the font with 'merge fontname.fnt', then do a dump of
the font you merged.  2)  Look at the second set of 4 characters from the dump.
3)  type 'display 1b3a' plus that second set of four digits. This selects that
font.  Incidentally, you can merge every font in
BITMAPS and not take up any additional memory.

EMACS:

Yeah, I like it.  Just a matter of personal taste I suppose.

 Actually, two people (out of about 15) in my development group at work prefer
emacs (I am one of them). It got really funny when we sat together several
weeks ago in a C++ class. The computer we did our projects on did not have
emacs and neither one of us knew vi well enough to get much done. We were
always writing down all the cryptic little command sequences on slips of paper

get used to. I used vibAre I used emacs. I like emacs better. Oh, well!

  Interesting compariison between your Vi users and uMacs users.  I used TSED
on the CoCo for so long that the UNI* system at the local JC wasn't too much of
a difference the last time I took a class.  The 'cryptic little commands' are
indeed indigenous to editors as a whole!

  How did you like your C++ class?  Borland's been bombarding me with special
upgrade offers for their object oriented C++ compiler and I'm getting close to
springing for the $100+ that they want.

Ugh, if you're really into C the way it is now, you might want to put off
diving into C++.  They really do things differently (OOP, that is)!  A friend
of mine has been studying up on C++ trying to learn it from scratch (isn't much
up on C yet anyways), and in fact that is what the books seem to be
recommending - people who really know C really hate C++.  People who aren't
that much into it find it easier to get used to.  Evidently there's a lot of
'unlearning' to do...

To some extent, it doesn't matter whether I like C++ or not, we're "stuck" with
it on our present project. Whether we use classes or not is up to us. Contrary
to Scott's observations, *I* think I may like it. Using classes enforces data
hiding in a way we only approached on our last project. Just to whet your
appetited, I'll give you a feature you may like:
 If you have a function, foo(), it can actually be several functions with the
same name, but different prototypes. This means you can have several functions:
 int foo(int arg);
 int foo(char * arg);
 int foo(void);
 void foo(int arg1, int arg2);
 int foo(int arg1, char *arg2);

 - all having the same name. In your mainline code, you just call it with the
proper argument type and the compiler knows which one you actually want. Pretty
slick, huh? (FWIW, this is called "overloading")
 As far as being happy with the current version of C, I *do* believe we will
have to migrate to ansi C anyway, so why not go "whole hog"? I would go for it.
A little serendipity: Borland supports C++ in their forum here on CI$:
 go bprogb

Jay,
     I've run up against the same problem.  It's a real pain having to type in
string inializers in single character format.  So I got to thinking why not
write a conversion utility to expand the string notation to single character
notation automatically.  I did and I just uploaded the program to lib 3 where
it will appear as soon as the sysop enables it.  Have a look at 'strchar.ar'
and see if it can help you out.

t0 should be a canonical PClonoid DB-9 serial connection--at least the PClonoid
cables I got to connect to DB-25 worked fine on it and the other serial outputs
from my MM/1.

For the rest, all I know is what I saw on the kit assembly instructions, and I
fear I can't deduce what some of those jumpers do from the brief descriptions
given.

The pinout of /t0 is as follows:
 1 - CD
 2 - RX
 3 - TX
 4 - DTR
 5 - GND
 6 - n/c
 7 - n/c
 8 - n/c
 9 - n/c

(I hope that's right).  Note that normal PC/AT style DB9->DB25 adapters do have
the correct pinout, but since CTS/RTS are N/C on the MM1 T0 port, some modems
will not want to talk to it.  The solution is to tell the modem to ignore
CTS/RTS handshaking if it can, otherwise get a break out box and tie pins 4-5-6
together (on DB25 to modem that is).

DOWNLOADED, SEEMS TO BE INCOMPLETE OR JUST WRONG.  THE TEST PROGRAM I RAN ON MY
REWORKED BISON GENERATED A C SOURCE THAT WOULD NOT COMPILE BEACUSE TOKENS WERE
NOT BEING #DEFINED.  AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THIS IS AN CODING ERROR ON BISON
PART.  AT THIS POINT I JUST GAVE UP. BY THE WAY, THE TEST PROGRAM I RAN AGAINST
BISON WAS THE ONE THEY USED AS AN EXAMPLE IN THE BISON DOC'S.

JJ;

  Thanks for the words of encouragement... I need 'em at this point!

  My first setup was using a 20' retractile cord stretched across the kitchen
to the phone jack.  I suspect that this cord has some broken connectors in it,
as our oldest daughter used to talk for hours and progressively wrap the cord
around her waist as she paced the floor.

  Switching to a straight 20' extension cord that is almost new, at least I was
able to download successfully at  2400 baud.  <T>ransmits still got garbled.
  Tonight I dropped back to 1200 and was able to <T>ransmit 2 separate messages
with no errors.
  Next step is to go to ramdisk and shorten the modem/phone jack cord still
further.
  One benefit to running into problems like this is the added knowledge gained
by RTFM.  I found in the VIVA manual that ATDS=n will dial up to 4 numbers
stored in non-volatile memory!  Neato!

Well, here we go again!  Consider the following C code with
the character initialization changed by Bruce Makenzie's 
program.  I added the terminating null character to each 
string  myself.
 
struct _mtable {
    char _mnem[8]; 
    int  _mvi;      
    char _mvc;     
};
 
static struct _mtable mtable[3] = 
{
    {'!','d','u','m','m','y',0}, 1,      2,
    {'a','b','c','d',0},         3,      4,
    {'a','d','d',0},             5,      6
};
 
This looks fine to me but the C Compiler says:
 
test4.c : line 10  ****  } expected  ****
 {'a','b','c','d',0}, 3, 4,
     ^
test4.c : line 10  ****  ; expected  ****
 {'a','b','c','d',0}, 3, 4,
                      ^
test4.c : line 11  ****  too many brackets  ****
 {'a','d','d',0}, 5, 6
               ^
test4.c : line 11  ****  identifier missing  ****
 {'a','d','d',0}, 5, 6
                ^
test4.c : line 11  ****  identifier missing  ****
 {'a','d','d',0}, 5, 6
                  ^
test4.c : line 11  ****  ; expected  ****
 {'a','d','d',0}, 5, 6
                  ^
 
The C code looks OK to me according to my main reference, 
I'm going to dig out my other C books and have a look.
 
It kinda looks to me like only the first chatacter is being
assigned to the string variable. (?)
 
In the meantime can anyone see what's going on here? 
This has to be a simple syntax problem.  (I hope)
 
Thanks, -J

Try the following to initialize your structs:

 struct _mtable {
     char _nmen[8];
     int  _nmi;
     char _mvc;
 };

 static strict _mtable mtable[3] = {
     {{'!','d','u','m','m','y','\0'}, 1, '\2'},
     {{'a','b','c','d','\0'}, 3, '\4'},
     {{'a','d','d','\0'}, 5, '\6'}
 };

That's the way you initialize Menu arrays under Multi-Vue.  Let me know if it

As kev says, there is two ports.  One of them may be used for MIDI 'instead'.
The switchable MIDI/Serial (T1) port is, in fact, user selectable.  There is
now a jumper to set the xtal frequency, although you do have to buy the proper
'paddle' board from IMS to have the right connections...

  Looks like the drop back to 1200 works in eliminating garbled transmitted
text.  Next step is to go back to 2400 using a ramdisk. Don't know what the
problem is at this point, but it may just be that this VIVA 2400 is at the
edge.   Stand by for further news as it happens.

How can basic09 determine if it is running in a text window or graphics window:
this is  important if overlays are used since color choices in one will not
apply to the other?  -ph-

Paul - use the syscall command to do an I$GetStt (get status) command with
SS.ScTyp as the desired subcall:

 procedure GetSType
 type stack:CC,A,B,DP:byte;X,Y,U:integer
 dim reg:stack
 dim SS_ScTyp:byte \ SS_ScTyp=$93
 dim I_GetStt:byte \ I_GetStt=$8D

 reg.A = 1 \ (* path = stdout
 reg.B = SS_ScTyp
 run syscall(I_GetStt,reg)

 print "Screen Type = ";reg.A
 end

Fm: Lee Veal 74726,1752
To: All

I was recently given a used (but working) DS-69B).  I've had a lot of fun with
it.  As I've learned more about the unit and software, facts that made no sense
to me at first have become more and more clear.
   One such fact was the use of the included program called SLOWPIC.BAS that
captures an image using a 64-level gray scale.  As a result of running
SLOWPIC.BAS a file is built which holds (I assume) the digitized picture that
SLOWPIC.BAS scanned in from the attached camera.  However, my puzzlement comes
from trying to fegure out what the file is to be used for. Is the file produced
by SLOWPIC.BAS for printing, displaying (on screen), both, neither, or what?

   I still haven't located the rumored OS-9 Lvl 2 drivers for t-e DS-69B. (A
friend logged-on to BIX and checked, he downloaded a directory and gave a copy
to me.  So far, I haven't seen anything that looks like OS-9 Lvl 2 drivers for
the DS-69B.)
   I've noticed that the unit still seems to be incompatible with my B&B
Autoboot process.  (i.e. When the DS-69B is plugged in, my system will not
autoboot (or manually for that matter either).  I've downloaded all the
CoCo1/2/3 memory maps that I could find.  The memory maps that I've found in
the CoCo and OS9 libraries don't include the DS-69B's I/O address.)
   Does anyone know if Micro Works still exists somewhere?  If so, what's their
address and ph. #?
   Any help will be greatly appreciated and I will personally reward anyone
that helps by mentioning you in my last will and testament.  (When I get around
to writing it, that is!!!  Just waiting to fulfill the "sound mind" proviso,
I'm sure that any day now a rush of sanity will wash over me.)

Thanks,

Lee,

I might be able to figure out the address of the DS-69B from the basic program,
that might help in figuring out the OS9 boot problem. I don't know anything
about the driver, but it shouldn't be that hard to figure out from the basic
program. I'll take a look at it, but I can't promise anything.

I too tried to find out what the problem with the DS-69's and Lvl II were a few
years back.  What I found out is that the hardware messes with OS9 systems
memory and stomps on OS9.  I called Micro Works then and was told that it could
not be made to work with Lvl II.  At one point I was going to send my unit to
Kev D. to let him write the software and readdress the unit, but once placed in
the queue, I forgot about it.

If someone has developed OS9 software for the DS-69b, It hasn't been mentioned
here.  (At least to my knowledge)

I'm pretty sure that it's addressed the same as the B&B HD interface too.

Phil,

The X10 software does not work with either of the tandy versions, it works with
the serial version only.

(oops... PHIL)

The Tandy unit is connected to the cassette port, which is unfortunately nearly
impossible to use under os9 (at least for non-babysitting input). You'll need
the X10 plug & power serial version (CP-290?) sold at Egghead Software attached
to a serial port. Figure ballpark $50-60.

Dunno what a Crutchfield's is.... if it works on the IBM, probably.

Sure (re: Delphi).... someone was supposed to do that already though. Might
