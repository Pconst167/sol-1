Hi James... Oooooooh! Sounds nice! I ordered an 80 Meg HD with mine - had
enough of always being out of room on my 30 Meg. 105 must be lovely! Oh well,
you know that data always expands to fill all available space, though... How's
all the sound I/O stuff work? Do you have any MIDI stuff?

Huh?  What do you mean you had to crank up a window to view 'em?  Who did the
GIFShow your using?  I never released any version that only handled 320 x 200. 
But they will "squish" the image onto a 320 x 200 or 320 x 400 screen in the
original GIFShow.  Also the one you probably have did NOT support the palette
chip, cause I wrote it on a prototype that didn't have a palette.  (Boy am I
glad they everyone nudged IMS into having Kev Pease put on eon the board) <g>.
Most 256 color GIF's really suck with only the stock boot up colors.  Now with
8 bits of R-G-B each, instead of 3 bits red, 3 bits green and 2 bits blue, you
can get some very realistic colors.

I guess I should release the latest version that handles GIF89a files. It'll
display ANY GIF and use the correct colors, plus do plain text rendering,
multi-image files.   Best bonus is the speed optimizing done by James Jones. 
(Thanks again JJ!)

BTW - I saw Glen mention ViewGIF.  He started with the same basic code I
started with too.  A GIF(TM) to Postscript(R) convertor by Scott Hempill. I
think it's in the Libs here as GIF2PS.C  or something like that.

    I guess that thing with backup was a fluke since I've used it a few more
times with no problem. I've got a copy of backup lightning also but I don't
leave OS9 and reboot. Alot of disk swapping to back up a 720k disk with one
drive. I like to copy them to a 720k ramdisk and then back out. Did you look at
a disassembled clock yet?

I can't use a 720K RAMdisk as I have only 512K total and I start up on 360K
(and usually take off another 256K for RAMdisk).  I still have yet to be able
to install my 720K drive.  I'm beginning to think that I'll Backup my 720K
disks by WCopy'ing dir-by-dir to RAMdisk and then to 720K as I remember all the
disk swapping I did with 360K that drove me to Backup Lightning.  I'm going to
see about disassembling the clock today; I've had a lot on my queue(g).

I remember seeing a message in this forum a long time ago about how you can do
something like dmode /d0 sid=2 to access the back of a flippy in /d0 as though
it were a /d2 (just as you might do in DECB).  As the message has scrolled off
long ago I thought I might ask how this could be done.  (At the time that
message was around, I was still struggling with getting a download of Ar 1.2 to
work, so DMode'ing was among the least of my concerns; hence, I never took note
of what was said then.)

I ought have a Disto SC2 on the way soon if not even now.  Can that controller
step at 3mS?  If so, what DMode would do it?  Who offers drivers that do cache
(and the software to set it up), or do I need to use hardware caching as some
PC's use?

Except for clock speed, I keep getting this CoCo3 closer to a 386SX:-)

Hi Wayne... I just uploaded Snap.ar the other day. I was messing with it today

Could you pull the current version off the database ASAP? I'll have this fixed
real soon and re-upload. Meanwhile, I don't think the bug is fatal, but it is
ugly and confusing. I guess we should warn against modifying any files with it
until I fix it, just in case.

Hi all... I just uploaded 'snap.ar' to the utilities database the other day. I
just realized that after the new additions, I forgot to re-test the modify
routines. They now have a nasty, ugly bug in them - I hope it's harmless, but
until I re-upload a fixed version, it would be safest not to use the modify
command. If you have downloaded it, either scrap it and get another copy when I
re-upload, or use it only to view files and diddle file lengths. I'll reupload
ASAP.   Glen Hathaway COMPER 71446,166

That's what I meant.  64 is the ASCII equivalent of 'd', and e4 is 64 + 80,
i.e. 'd' with the most significant bit set.  That's the way OS-9 recognizes the

OH....Gee I guess I know more than I thought. I will try it and let you know

From what I gather, it is basically a 10mb "floppy", or more like a removeable
hard drive. It needs some work on it, but I think I can get it up and running,
after all I managed to fix my hard drive. Although dropping it down a flight of
stairs is not the normal way one
 fixes a hard drive. I will probably have a host of questions about the B_BOX.

Kev;

  First thing I did after getting the MM/1 was to purchase another 3.5" drive -
almost an identical twin to /d0 - for moving files around. I HATE swapping
floppies!!!  I backed up all the distribution disks to brand new 2.0 M disks
and was using them until the MM/1 blew up - well, more like a loud POP,
actually.
  Now, I can only read one out of the 8 or so disks that I have data on. It's
beginning to look like the stepper in the drive took a dump, as it doesn't want
to read much past sector 0.  I will play around with it some more and get back
with detailed errata.  What's got me worried is that 'format' won't work on
this drive - it gets almost done and then errors out with a '246' (I think)
seek error.

  re: nylon spacers
  Yep, the kit has some in there, but using them with the aluminum standoffs
puts the board about 1/16" too high for the rear connectors - and also there's
nothing in the installation docs about using them. Lesson learned the hard way!
