Thanx Kev,

I'll look around for the heck of it and see what will run on a terminal. Maybe
some of these databases, etc. that you talked about.

Whatever happens, it's fun to experiment anyway!!!

Sounds interesting!! From what you said, it sounds like you're running a BBS
while multi-tasking with your other personal stuff, is this the case?  Also,
how about the names of some of the programs you have that DO run well on a
terminal??

Bob ...

While not exactly a BBS, you've got the general picture. I actually allow shell
access to a few trusted folks for whatever suits their fancy. Of course, I have
a electronic mail package installed, so we can leave messages between ourselves
... as well as running Mark's UUCP programs so I've been known to shuttle a few
files back and forth across country as well.

All on this lil' CoCo 3.

So far as character based games that run well remotely, I have an Adventure
game, cribbage, solitare, tic-tac-toe .... more serious applications include
dynacalc, scred, uemacs, dynastar and IMS (database)..

Fun? It's soooo much fun I've put my money down for a MM/1. OSK should give me
a few more challenges!

    There are a lot of useful programs that can be run from terminals that are
attached to a CoCo3.  However, there are some programs like some of the CoCo3
specific games that were never intended to be run from a terminal. Now if you
had a terminal that could in some way simulate the memory moves that it takes
to support a VDG-based game you could run it, but you'd still need some serious
mods to OS9's serial drivers so that the memory move
 commands could be sent downothe serial line.

There are are some word processors that will run from a terminal by simply
 specifying to the wordprocessor what the characteristics of the terminal are.

It's not a lie to call OS9 a multitasking / multiuser operating system.

I routinely use Dynacalc and some other programs from terminals.

When I said that it was a misnomer (OR lie) that OS-9 was truly multiuser, it
was due to my ignorance of what is possible on a terminal. Now that you, Kevin,
and Steve have all explained some of this to me, I am learning a little more
about it! I now apologize to everyone (including Microware) <GRIN>, for making

If you can get your terminal to respond to OS9 Escape Codes, as Kevin
mentioned, then you should be able to run things like DED, OS9 Profile,
Dynacalc, the PD game called SOKOBAN, and some others.  The key is, though,
whether Ultimaterm can interpret incoming OS9 Escape Codes that an application
like the ones mentioned is going to send as screen formatting commands.

I've got a lot to learn about this - and I'll probably ask a hundred more

If I run OS-9 on my terminal, can I redirect my output to /t2 and my input FROM

the terminal??

Thinking some more (big trouble!!) about the termcap/basic thingie... I think
that what I was alluding to in my 1st message was that we should avoid termcap
and use something like the coco GFX2 interface. It'd just be a matter of using
different interfaces for different setups--and so long as all the interfaces
had the same calling setup and programmers agreed to determine the interface to
use from the system instead of hardcoding then everything should be sweet.

Don't know, but are you doing a GFX2 thing for the MM/1?

     Nope,
           They aren't RFI. They don't occur at all if I boot up with earlier
versions of my boot disk. If anything, this computer generates quite a bit of
RFI that I can tune in on my shortwave or watch on my television. But I don't
use them at the same time so it doesn't matter. The bars that flash on my
screen are very digital looking. Thanks anyway.

     Well, I did some checking: I booted up starting with an old boot disk and
used sucessively newer disks until I found where the problem started. The
problem started not with the addition of the hard drive or any of the serial
ports, but with the addition of SACIA.
     I also tried the interrupt driven version of B&B's CC3Disk and this was
radically wworse. You could see lots of missing characters while online at 300
baud.
     The horizontal bars that occur are very digital in nature. They look like
those above Ascii 127 characters that you can generate in RSDOS but they flash
by too fast. However, when I see them I know there will be download problems.
     I have another boot disk that has a CC3Disk version that is used when
running PCDos. This does not support the no-halt floppy controller but it too
causes the flashing bars even without SACIA present. There are no download
problems in this situation though.
     When I log on to CIS after I get the CONNECT message from the modem, I hit
Cntl-C. With the standard ACIAPAK driver, I have to hit return to send the
Cntl-C down the line. With SACIA, I don't have to hit return; the Cntl-C
apparently shoots right out. This is a nice feature for CIS use.
     Is there maybe something in SACIA that needs setting with the new XMODE it
comes with in order for it to perform correctly?

                              What do you think?

Was there a corrected clock module that was also needed with the SACIA modules?
Seems to me the 'soft' fix to irq problems was in the clock module.

Can't speak to the stalling ^c problems. My control codes shoot out just dandy
... no need to hit <enter>.

As far as new xmode settings for SACIA .... you have increased the xmit/receive
buffers, jes? A small buffer could be the cause of your troubles.

I've left Kevin Darling a mail message about procuring KWindows for the TC70,
he responded back that he'll have to get back with me.

KWindows, from everything I've been told, is very close to the windows that we
have in the OS9/6809/CoCo windows.

GWindows is much more like a MAC set of windows....I've just gotten a test
version of GWindows, and the Desktop is phenominal.....so close to a MAC's
look, and feel, that it's spooky  (g).

Microware, I understand, is supposed to be working on an XWindow format for
OS9...but I don't know the details of that environment at all.

At least, for now, GWindows, and KWindows, is what we have for OS9/68K.

Of course, that's twice as many options as we had for the CoCo......

Yah, all we really need is for someone to write a standard library set which'll

calls have been ported to X, Mac, ST and MGR, I think.  Add in G/KWindows and
we'd be cooking with gas.  Just relink a program.

PS: hang tight.  Overlapping windows using the L-II upgrade technology (which
includes moving from screen to screen) has been going in all this week. Should
be done soon (KWindows).  Mike H and I are making sure it all works out.  So
far it's been pretty neat to see Tetrix running in any size window... and it

 Jim,

 LOGON will work with MW shell, csh and sh.  (I use csh most of the time.)
 Read the docs on logon.  You need a 'sysinfo' file in your systems
 directory as well as a couple of other files.  I forgotten what's all
 required.

 In your startup file, you'll need a line like -

 '/h0/ETC/CMDS/setup /h0/SYS/sysinfo'  assuming you've installed the
 stuff as TOP provided it.

 Works fine on my system (SYSTEM IV) - I use it all the time.

 One caveat - if you ever go to a 030, it won't work - something to do
 with the memory security module.  Not having the source, don't really
 know what the problem is.

Jamie, some early CoCo Disk Controllers won't work with a CoCo3 when it's
running at the 2MHz speed.  Level 2 on the CoCo3 runs at that speed.

How old is you disk controller?  FD-501s and FD-502 will probably be okay, but
earlier ones may not be able to respond properly to a CC3 that's running at
2MHz.

I had the same thing happen to me when I first started using Level 2.  I had a
disk controller that I got with my very first gray CoCo 1.  Radio Shack was no
help then either.  I discovered that Level 2 would boot with my J&M Disk
Controller, but I only had one of them, and I had two CoCo3s.  I had to
purchase a better controller.

Fm: Jim Sutemeier 70673,1754
To: all

I will be selling off all of my CoCo equipment, now that I own this
Tomcat70....

To those of you who know me, and my BBS, the <Plain Rap> BBS, I will shut down
this BBS temporarily -- until some BBS software is ported over to the OSK
environment.

First item for sale will be.....

One Seagate ST1100 (100 meg) hard drive, complete with Burke & Burke interface,
power supply and cabinet.

I bought this drive less than 120 days ago, when I thought I was gonna buy a
Tomcat9, and the asking price for the complete set is less than I paid for the
drive.

Included will be my complete cmds directory (about 200 cmds), plus I will
'throw in' all of my BBS downloads (about 1200 files, pictures, text files,
help files, etc., etc.)

The package would be ideal if you wanted to run a BBS, if you've a mind to.

Asking price:  $350  O.B.O., plus S&H

Sb: #Aborting Edit?
Fm: Erich Schulman 75140,3175

Is there any way I can tell Edit that I want to quit without saving? I've tried
ctrl-c, ctrl-e, and even KILLing it from another shell in another window.  Edit
just won't let go.  The only thing that has worked is pressing RESET twice and
rebooting.  Almost surprised that works(g).

I'm sure there must be a way of exiting Edit without saving, but until someone
looks it up, you could just do what I'd probably do:

Flip to another window and copy the original file to a different name.

Then quit edit, and shuffle things around as needed to get back where I was. 
But then, I'm lazy :-)

I know there is some way to do it because I once did it by accident. But I have
no idea what I did to do it!  I always use Edit with files on a RAMdisk and
since I was working on my startup file copied from /d0, I lost nothing.  Why
should it be so hard to leave Edit without saving your changes--I thought one
of the "rules" of OS-9 is that you let a ctrl-e or a KILL terminate your
process but here is something on the original system disk which is different. 
A hard disk defragmenter, I can understand why you'd intercept attempts to
stop, but a _line editor_??

As a rule, /term and /w1 are always active with shells on my system so I'll try
out your method.  I do nearly all my text editing with Simply Better.  Even
having to RSDos DECB<-->OS-9 is worth the ease of SB over Edit.  I only use
Edit to make little fixups to patch scripts, Basic-09 listings I download,
Startup, and so forth.  And I'll use its counterpart built-in to Basic-09 for
new programs so I can get the immediate syntax checking.

Oh well.  Thanks just the same.

Erich,
 You can do something similar to what Kevin suggested by using the
shell command from within the editor:

 .shell rename oldfile save

where oldfile is your original read file.  Once renamed edit can't find your
original file when it tries to delete it.

If that is the case (MFM only) then I had better locate what I want quickly, I
feel as if I am dealing with a fossil then, and access to the MFM drives seems
to decline with time. Thanks for the reply.

Get a copy of Computer Shopper and look for MFM drives there.  You may need a
whole evening to come up with a shopping list (concentrate on the last 1/3d of
the mag and use the indexes) but you should be able to come up with an adequate
list.  Don't expect any help from the dealers; ask your questions here and
place your order when ready.

My hard drive, on my coco system just crashed, and I have decided to throw in
the towel.  For whoever is willing to pay the shipping, I will give away the
hard drive, the LR Tech System, the multipack, and a coco III with 512k of
memory.  When I can afford to, I will get Ed Gressick's System IV, as a replace
 ment system.  Probably some time next year.  If you are interested please call
me at (215) 322-5455, and I will work something out with you.
