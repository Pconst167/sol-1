Dear Friends:

 I am looking for copies of the following books:

6809 Assembly Language Programming by Lance Leventhal

The MC6809 Cookbook by Carl Warren.

I understand that both of these are out of print. If you have a copy which you
would be willing to sell, please let my know as to price, etc. If there are any
other book that you could recomend, please let me know. I have Bill Barden's
and Laurence Telpolt's books already. This leads me to several questions which
I would like to raise.

These last two books were written for assembly language programming under
RS-DOS. I know that RS-DOS assembly language programming is different from OS-9
assembly language programming. Why? I know that under OS9 Level 1 and 2 code
must be position independent. Would a program written un RS-DOS work under OS-9
if it were written as position independent code? Finally is it possible, or
worth it, to rewrite position dependent code to position independent code? Or
would you have to take each section of position dependent code and convert to
modules which could then be managed by some sort of 'skeleton program.' (I have
absolutely no idea of what I am talking about, but it sure sounds impressive
anyway.)

I know that this is a lot to ask, but if anyone has some sort of bibliography
which would help me learn this, perhaps a course outline or reading list, etc.,
which they would be willing to share, please let me know. I really would love
to learn more about programming, but in my present obligations, I am not free
to be able to take any college courses, so I have to do this on my own.

I look foreward to your replies.

With all best wishes,

Br. Jeremy, CSJW

It's definitely possible to someone's position-dependent code and change it to
position-independent (I had to do that for Kyum-Gai game which was written for
RSDOS)... but I don't recommend it for fun <grin>.

Basically, you have to look for anywhere that the programmer had hardcoded an
address, and change it to position-independent code (PIC).  And wherever he
used the jump instruction (JMP) had to be changed to branch (LBRA).  Same for
subroutine calls, of course.  Some of that can be done with an editor in
global-replace mode.  Some is harder to find.

I was about to say that I'd donate a copy of Leventhal's 6809 book, but looking
at my shelf, I must have loaned it out long ago :-)   kev

You might be interested in a book that is IN print, albeit not specifically
geared toward the CoCo.  The book is "Programming the 6809" by Rodnay Zaks and
William Labiak (Sybex 078-4, $21.95).  Since bookstores order by ISBN number,
you might want to give them this book's number which is 0-89588-078-4.  It took
my local bookstore 3 months to get it so be prepared for a long wait.  You may
also be able to find more available books online. Books In Print is on CIS, tho
I've never used the service.  GO INDEX to find it.  Be forewarned that this is
a surcharged service.

MaGraw-hill have an online ordering thingie here on CIS. Have you checked there
for the Leventhal book? This book has been my programming bible for a long time
(and no, it's not for sale!). (BTW, the 6809 one is much better than the 68000
version I bought--the 68000 book is almost totally useless due to the poor
index, I believe there are better choice around for this). The only other book
I've used is one written by Bill Barden and published by Radio Shack. You might
get lucky and find a dusty one at a Shack store, but it has been out of print
for quite some time.

The thing that I wonder about is: what happens to all those old computer books.
I'm quite a used book store prowler, and I never see them there. Maybe someone
should set up a mail order used computer book store-or is there already one
around?

Dear Bob, I have Bill Barden's book. I am looking for things which might be a
little more COCO3 specific. If I remember, I believe that I saw your assembly
library. I will be downloading a copy. Someone said that you sell the source
for it. I will be ordering that as soon as my resources allow. --Br. Jeremy,

I would not waste too much time looking for coco3 specific assembler stuff. The
best way to start is to have a look at short assembler programs avail here and
start to figure out how things work, and then start making changes. Yes, the
source for my assembler library is avail. I don't sell it, but I ask people to
send in a donation to compensate for my time, etc. I suggest $20.00 in
something or other I wrote, but it's really up to the individual (more or less
$$, it's up to you).

Hi Br. Jeremy,

(I'm the bald-headed character you met at the door as you were leaving the
COCOFest in Chicago last April).

I finally got that MM/1.  I will keep MOST of my COCO stuff, but I do have a
copy of "The MC6809 Cookbook" by Carl Warren that I don't really need.  Send me
your address - no charge for the book, it needs to belong to someone who will
use it.

You know, you're right....my procs command spews a bunch of stuff that is
innacurate.  Hmmph, have to ask Frank about that one....

What do you mean when you ask me 'what your set up like?'.....as far as I know,
for right now, I have the 'stock' TC70 system here, but will be adding an
Accelerator Card, some more memory, a 2-port serial card, and, of course,
GWindows in the very near future.

Ahh .... so it is consistant (procs output problem), I'll pass that on to my
friend.

On the set up ... you got it right. I wanted to be sure I was comparing apples
to apples. He's running a stock TC70 with the extra ram
 (already replaced once), 10 serial ports ... of which only 3 work due to what
appears to be poor cabling between the connectors and the board (output
directly from the board is OK), a SCSI tape drive (still no drivers ...)and an
extra floppy drive (that doesn't work. Appears to be strapped incorrectly.)

Thanks for the details!

A program does not have to be upgraded to run under MultiVue, but just because
a program can run under MV doesn't mean that it will take advantage of the
graphical interface.  You are supposed to see an icon for the application, not
the aif.  LIST the aif and look for where the aif says where the icon is
located (3rd line, I believe).  Add your execution directory to the front of
that.  For example....  Place a MV application in /d1.  Click the /d1 icon.  Go
to the disk menu and click Set Execute. Type /d1/CMDS *even if the window
already says that*.  Now if your aif says ICONS/icon.Program, the icon will be
looked for at d1/CMDS/ICONS/icon.Program.  That's /d1/CMDS for your execution
directory plus ICONS/icon.Program from your aif.  Be sure that you turn on the
execute attribute for your icon!  That's attr /d1/CMDS/ICONS/icon.Program e. 
You should now have the icon with the application's name when you are viewing
/d1 instead of the aif.  Now, when does your MV lock up:  what are you doing
that results in a lockup?  Are you sure that nothing is waiting for action on
your part?  or that something isn't trying to process?

I am seriously considering FHL's Tc9 as my next computer.  However there are
some things about it that I have not been able to determine.  For example, does
the computer already come with the infamous Kbus so I can add the 68000 cpu? 
Also will the 68k cpu also be able to run OSk in addition to being a
coprocessor for Level II?  Is there anyway to increase graphics resolution?
    I would also like to hear from someone who has already purchased one for
eir opinion of its performance (are there people out there who have one?). This
information would be very helpful.

                         ThankQ

TC9--> you would have to purchase a KBus to use the Tiger Card, Jason.  The
Tiger Card is $130, and the KBus is $150.

I don't see why the 68K cpu couldn't run OSK programs, but I suspect the best
use of the 6809/68K marriage is using the 68K card as a memory management
handler for the 6809.

Graphics resolution would be the same as for the CoCo....

There are some TC9's out there (saw a message on I think it was Delphi from
someone that had one), however, Frank is unhappy with the manufacturer of the
TC9 cards, and has now suspended shipping of the TC9's for what he terms 'quite
a while' so he can iron out a couple of buglets and also get a new
manufacturer.

According to the most recent file on the Tiger that FHL uploaded here,
OS-9/68000 has been ported to the Tiger, but essentially none of the software
one would want to have to assist the 6809 (6309?) in running OS-9/6809 Level II
has been written. (Things may have changed since then.)

Kevin, Hi! It's been a long time since we last talked on Delphi. I don't get on
Compuserve that often but I just thought I'd drop in and see what's going on
here. I know that you've been involved recently with some OSK projects and
that's part of what I wanted to talk about. A few months ago, I picked up a
System IV computer and I've been spending some time getting familiar with it. A
couple questions:

1) Has a standard been talked about yet for graphics on the OSK machines? Has
anyone come up with standardized GetStt/PutStt routines or windowing codes yet?
If not, are there plans to create such a standard?

2) How about a standard for mouse drivers? We were just discussing some of the
specs on Microsoft & Logitec mice over on Delphi and I'd like to write a driver
to use these. But, there's no sense working on one if it can't be used
universally.

Any information you can give me that will help me to write standardized user
programs would be appreciated.
