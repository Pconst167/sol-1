Yup ... we're pretty much set up the same. And yes ... doing CPU intensive

You can only push these CoCo's sooo far. I have a 9600 baud modem that really
is doing me no good. The poor 3 can't keep up.

Can't wait for the MM/1 to show up. It's been three weeks since I placed the

    My name is Mark North and I'm new to telecommunicating. I have a CoCo 3
with one meg of memory and a Disto SC 2. I bought the Wiz and got WizPro along
with it and I am having trouble get them running. All I get is single
characters between '> <' in the single line window in the bottom of the screen.
It looks like the modem is never hearing from the computer.
     I have seen since I've been on Compuserve with AutoTerm that many patches
should be done to my system to make everything work well. I was extremely
pleased to find out that it wasn't really my fault that printer kepted getting
stray linefeeds all the time.
     My problem with the Wiz is I just didn't get enough from the docs. I think
my boot file is OK, but since I'm a rookie at using any terminal package, I
have run out of plans to try. I joined Compuserve to talk to others with
similar equipment and intrests.
     I need to log on to the service under the operating system to download all
the patches and such that I need. Someone PLEASE HELP!

                  Thank You for Your Time and Interest 70412,2312

My impression was that we had the problem taken care of... didn't you upload
the new version, and have that upload acknowled by Mike Ward, just a couple of
days ago, or am I hallucinating?

In any event, all versions of SNAP.AR  are now moved from public view.  Your
upload was dated 12 Nov and modified on 13 Nov.  So, I think we'll just ask you
to upload the correct version, again, to make sure we have the right one.

Hi Wayne... I'm sorry about all this mess. Tell ya what. Just pull it all off.
I've got a new, improved version almost ready - more bugs squashed and more
features. I'll test it THOROUGHLY this time and re-upload probably Sunday. The
only thing I'd like to know is: did the version uploaded here work for most
people? Paul Jerkatis, over on Delphi, had major problems with it. I think the
problem was that he didn't have his grfdrv patched for 25 lines. I'm putting in
a test for screen size that will allow you to exit gracefully if you don't have
the patch, instead of crashing the OS.

Hi Wayne... Already done. As far as I know, it's bug-free, but if you write
software you know how that goes... Some are sure to show their ugly little
heads! I'm now playing with adding a print-sector command to send a sector to
the printer and thinking of putting a file stripper in. After all, when
stripping control codes, etc. out of a file, you almost always end up having to
chop off X/Ymodem padding or something. Why not have it all in one program?

Hi Colin... It's real tough to work without a printer - I know what it's like
cause I did it for a long time. You learn to print by hand - fast! What a pain!
Anyway, I'm trying to get Snap in shape, both by finishing it, and by cleaning
up the code - modularizing and generalizing subroutines, etc. That way, when it
comes time to port it to OSK, it should be (pardon the pun) a Snap. Actually, I
was quite amazed at how easy it was to port it from quick and dirty RSDOS code
to legal OS-9 code. Went pretty quick - hope the OSK port goes as smoothly...
BTW, Snap now has both a working Diddle and a Verify command. If I add a few
more things, it'll be a definite Ded beater!

I don't believe there is anything you can download here for the software fix. 
If you have access to Delphi you can download it there BUT you will have to pay
$3.50 extra.  Even then this is one case where having the documentation (the
magazine) is a very good idea.  Order the back issue if you don't have it. 
Then type it in or cough up the $3.50 if you're short on time--you'll do a lot
of typing for this.  As for your RSSave, place the Disk BASIC disk in Drive 0
and an OS-9 disk in Drive 1 (RSSave should already be in memory, and so should
RSDOS).  The OS-9 disk should have a copy of RSDos on it.  Type chx /d1/cmds
(or wherever RSDos is).  Then type rssave /d0 /d1 ! shell and watch your files
get transferred to OS-9.  You must have a copy of RSDOS on the destination disk
with the execution dir set to it because RSSave will want to load RSDos and
OS-9 must be able to find it.  Give this a try and leave another message if you
still have problems.  It took me a few tries to get RSSave to work right but it
does.

From what I've read it seems to me that's what the wire would be for but I
really can't say for sure.  I should have a SC2 on the way soon but not with a
2-in-1.  I may know more when I get the package but even this isn't too likely
as I'm not getting the serial board with the controller.  Do you know which
data lines the wire connects to on each side?  Compare pinouts to whatever docs
you may have.  If your downloads are reliable and you don't have a lot of
dropped characters you're probably doing fine as you are.  I like having ended
my problems but about all I use OS-9 term pgms for are downloads >68 Granules;
otherwise, I use Ultimaterm in DECB.

Bob - that wire is to connect the IRQ from the serial board to the coco bus.

IRQ hacks actually come in two related flavors:  ones which tie all the MPI
slots together so that all slots can give an IRQ... and ones which bypass the
GIME so that IRQs go straight to the 6809 cpu (or which use software to make
the GIME irq handling more reliable).

The whole idea is simple: to make sure that IRQs have a clear path to the cpu
and are always recognized.   The actual execution of this idea gets a little
muddled, depending upon the type of external hardware/drivers :)

As far as I know, the CC3Disk driver in the Disto package is the same as is
created by patching the stock CC3Disk with the IPC file found in PCDOS/RSDOS.
The version number for either is #10. I am not certain of the version number
needed for the caching program. --Br. Jeremy, CSJW

The version number or revision level is not a good indication of whether the
Disto driver is the same as the CC3Disk driver as patched for PCDos/ RSDos.  To
determine this one would need to run Ident on each and compare the CRC's.  Or
use cmp on the two files.  The problems I described earlier with caching do
exist, but on Delphi I got a great way around it--at least until I have a SCII.
I can rename CC3Disk to CC3XDisk and insert the IPatched CC3disk with caching
into the boot file as CC3Disk.  Then I insert copies of my /d0 and /d1 but
renamed to /x0 and /x1.  Now I can do something like rsdos -get /x0 os9prog.bin
/d1/os9prog.  Of course I won't have caching on floppies when referring to them
as /x_.  Of course once I get a SCII I'll be right back to where I started from
since I wouldn't be able to IPatch the CC3Disk_disto for caching.  But if the
Disto driver really is the same as the PC/RSDos one I'll be OK.  I was told on
Delphi that the Disto driver was written so as to allow no-halt to take place
so I doubt the 2 are the same modules.

Hello,

     Another letter looking for help to get up and communicating under OS9
Level 2. I have the DISTO Super Controller 2 with a 3 in One board which has a
Real Time Clock and its own custom module. Can anyone confirm the wiring scheme
used for the DISTO Super Controller 2 RS232 port? It is part of what is keeping
me from using The Wiz and WizPro under OS9. Here is what I am assuming it is on
the 10 pin ribbon cable:    1 2 3 4 5
                         6 7 8 9 10.     This is looking at the cable end. The
convention for a ribbon cable, as I understand it, is odds on the top and even
on the bottom, but this seems to be the way I found the wires in the cable
originally and that's how I read the levels coming off the the port itself. I
have found a dead power transformer for the RS232 port caused by a short
between the power feed pins on the 3 in one board shorting against the slightly
insulated case. The 10 pin ribbon cable was upside down due to a notch that was
missing in the aluminum case.
     I was led to believe by the documents for the above mentioned
telecommunications package that patches to the level two operating system clock
modules was not a good idea. Should I have any patches or not to the DISTO
replacement clock module. Will it work with the Wiz? I will only be
communicating at 2400 baud. Do I need the standard ACIA modules loaded also? Do
I need /T1 or /T2?
     I also have the DISTO 1 meg upgrade. Is there anything besides the
avoidance of starting a window outside the first half meg that I should be
aware of with regards to the Wiz or WizPro?
     I am looking forward to getting the patch for the annoying linefeed
problem with the parallel printer port. From what I've noticed though, it is
really the very last character sent which is repeated.
     Thanks for your time.  70412,2312  Mark North.

I thought all I had to do was modify the dynacalc.trm file so that all of the

well, it would be nice.  Someone told me a few years back that there was in
fact a new dynacalc.trm file somewhere here on CIS - and that you had to have a
different .trm file for each terminal - i.e. one for the coco and one for the
Televideo terminal - under OS9.

There is a file that tells you what the dynacalc.trm file contains and how to
modify it (well it shows you how much space is allowed for each code) its
included with the new HELP utility (the structured one) its nothing but a small
textfile. if you wish i can Email it to you. this will allow you to modify
dynacalc.trm to suit other types of terminals other then OS9 terminals.

If anyone here has used this action, I've a couple of questions.

1) How would you read in the files within the directory, as chars into memory,
then manipulate??

2) How do I test for end of directory?? a NULL or what??

Any other info about this option would be helpful.....never have used it, and
apparently many programmers haven't either.

Jim,
 You read from the directory as you would from any other file.  Under OS9 (I
can't speak for OSK--check your docs) each directory entry consists of a 29
byte name field followed by a 3 byte logical sector number for the file
descriptor sector.  The microware OS9 C compiler defines a structure in
direct.h to help access the directory:

 struct dirent{
      char dir_name[29];
      char dir_addr[3];
 }

 So all one need do is define a structure of this type and read the directory
entries into it:

 struct dirent dat;

 in=fopen("/dd","d");

 while(fread(&dat,sizeof(dat),1,in)!=0){
 .
 .
 .

 If the entry is unused the first byte of the filename is set to zero.  The
last byte of the filename has its MSB set so you have to clear this bit and set
the next byte to zero to make it a proper C string.  At the end of the
directory fread() returns 0 for EOF.

You will want to read entries into structures that contain names and LSNs.  I
wouldn't be surprised, though, if the Kreider library has the BSDoid routines
opendir(), readdir(), and the like, that make scanning through directories much
easier.  Check it out.

Erich,

A long, long time ago, I made a couple of minor mods to edit. I'm not sure
whether I ever uploaded them or not. One was to set up a special key (I used
ALT/BREAK) that aborted the edit (there is no way to abort an edit without the
patch). The other was to execute one edit command (I used to do a .load to load
a set of macros I had). I think there were some other little things I did to
it, but don't remember. I haven't used edit in years, but if you're interested,
I'll scrounge around for the mods (probably on a floppy with a 1/4 inch of dust
on it!).

I don't use Edit much myself; I usually give that job to Simply Better in DECB.
There have been some occasions recently since I started the thread that called

interested in something better if you find it.  You might want to wipe the dust
off the floppy before inserting it(g).  Just UPLoad it if you find it as it
might help others too.

Interesting, I don't have that problem connecting to CIS, but I DO have that
problem when connecting to Delphi. Do you use a CIS node, or Tymnet? I connect
to Delphi using Tymnet (when I use SprintNet instead, I don't have a problem).

I suspect that the problem is caused by the fact that Tymnet sends its initial
message at 1200 baud (thus the string of odd characters, and lots of 'x's).
This generates a framing error, and I'm wondering if the serial driver on the
MM/1 is handling this error properly (could also be some idiosyncrasy of the
built in serial port on the 68070).

It is a problem in the driver, I understand they are working on it. I can CAUSE

To: All

     I have come up against a little problem I can't solve. I use a memscript
(with Shell+) to set up a graphics window with a dark green background. The
memscript reads:

     merge /dd/sys/stdfonts
     merge /dd/sys/italic
     merge /dd/sys/stdptrs
     shell i=/w7&
     display 1b 31 1 2 >/w7
     echo New window is /w7

I generally execute the memscript while I am in term, with a data directory of
/d0 (which is the way it boots up). If I do this, the line:

     display 1b 31 1 2 >/w7

does not appear to have any effect and I get a bright blue background on the
graphics screen. If, however, I do a chd to /r0 and then execute gw, there is
no file on /d0 called gw (though I thought the memscript would have had
priority) and there is certainly none on /d1.

     So what is going on? Why should the results depend on what working
directory I am using? Doesn't make sense to me. Anyone have any ideas?

Yes, when I chd to /r0 first, it works fine. Graphics window then comes up with
the colors I want. If I am in /d0 or /d1, however, the background color stays
at the default bright blue. What I can't figure out is why the directory
selected should have any effect at all on the operation of a memscript. At
first I thought I had a file of the same name on the selected disk, but not so.
Odd. I don't have block turned on, so I can output to a window which contains a
shell.

For an OS-9 term program, I am using the Telecom program in DeskMate 3. (I
usually use Ultimaterm in RS-DOS), and I just bought a 2400 bps modem. I now
have a question: When I attempt to use 2400 bps under Telecom, I LOSE
characters like crazy , sometimes almost full sentences! If I slow her down to
1200 or less, it works fine. I am using an RS-232 pak as /t2...CoCo 3 512k OS-9
Level Two V 2.00.01 ( in case that is helpful).

My question is...is this a weakness of DeskMate 3 or is it something with OS-9?
All the info I have says I SHOULD be able to go up to 19,200 bps.

By the way, it works perfectly under Ultimaterm!

Any guidance would be appreciated!

Thanx!

Bob

I have just uploaded a replacement for MAKDIR. This version duplicates the MW
version, with the added features of being able specify the initial allocation
size and converting the names to uppercase. The archive contains source, binary
and docs. Look for makdir.ar in lib 12.
