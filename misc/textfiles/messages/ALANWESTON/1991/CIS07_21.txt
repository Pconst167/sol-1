I am running a Tandy coco2 and Deskmate. I have tried several times to download
files from CIS and have failed on every one. How do I get a download to work, I
have tried xmodem and the host always times out. I would like to download a
real terminal program if I could only get it to work. Can anyone help me?

Hi Tom - hopefully someone can help you out.  Are you using an RS232 pak and
some kind of modem?  Or a modempak?  Logging on and everything else goes okay?

Kevin,

I'm using a modem pak, I just added the m1 driver for it about a month ago. I
did so with the help of the folks here and it works great! I have no trouble
logging on, reading messages , etc. the only problem I have is downloads.
Thanks for the reply.

What trouble downloading do you have? If you're using Sterm, it should be a
snap.

 Sorry Tom, but the original DeskMate doesn't support xmodem as far as I know.
If it does,you'll get a XModem? yes/no window after selecting download. Without
XModem, CIS times out since no CTS can be sent if DeskMate doesn't know what's
going on. If STERM runs under Level 1 I'd be glad to sent a copy, but with
CoCo3's going for $60, it might be time to upgrade. I even bought a spare
Level2 for $4.95 just to get another manual! Otherwise, Rickeyterm and
GregEterm are cheap and work, to boot. Best of luck,  -Rick

Where did you get the level 2 for 4.95? For that matter I haven't seen coco 3's

All the CoCo stuff is SOWG  (Sold out when gone) and Tandy has a sale list that
should have the real low proces on the stuff.  Here in Las Vegas, they never
tell you about the SPIF (sp?) List pricing.  YOU have to ask.  Maybe you should
ask your local shack manager "Why can the whole country get CoCo's for XX
amount and Level II for $4.95, and You're selling it for XXX?"

Happy shopping!!!  <Grin>

Tom,
 I found all of this in the Milwaukee area. There is a wide range, some stores
are selling all software for $4.95 while others still have some things at full
price. Been driving everywhere, (probably a dozen stores this week), and then
buying stuff on the way back home. When the 502 dropped to $60, a few stores
sold CoCo's for the same price. Guess it depends on how much room and patience
each individual manager has! Somebody bought most of the remaining CoCos here
last week, so I'm expecting to see 'em on Home Shopping Network next week. Hope
ya find an XModem, the libraries here are GREAT! - Rick

I checked with my local store and they don't have any level 2, and if they did

 Down'ed STERM 1.3 on the 19th,after I RTFM on DeskMate3.Also down'ed 1.5 on
the 20th (surprize update!). If anybody can help me on this one final problem,
I'd REALLY be thankful, and besides, can finally use DeskMate for a frisbee:
   STERM 1.3 will work ONCE after boot, STERM 1.5 never!
   The error is always 'no MODEM defined' with the one exception above.
   (I'm using sterm /m1 to start both versions)
   Do I need the new TERMCAP thats bundled with 1.5 source? I took a few
  days to reflect/retry and mebbe avoid another Stupid Question, but this
  has me whupped.
 Thanks for all the help- Rick

Rick,

I'm not fimaliar with sterm, I am using Deskmate. However 1 question, do you
have an m1 driver in your boot file. Check your module directory and see if
it's there. What are you using for a modem? a modem pak or rs-232 and external
modem. I could be wrong but if you are using rs-232 and a modem you need to use
/T2, and a modem pak uses /M1 Hope that helps.

I'm not sure what the problem with Sterm 1.3 is, but with 1.5, you must specify

Bill has given you the NEW syntax for Sterm 1.5. A quick reference of the
syntax can be had by typing STERM -?. Mark's added a nmber of command line
options.

The termcap in place for 1.3 should be forward compatable with 1.5. Might be a
few minor entry updates, but nothing major. I wasable to replace my old version
of sterm with 1.5 by exchanging binaries. Nothing else.

You might look at lib 7 (or maybe 10) for XCOM9.  It runs on OS9 Level one and
it does XMODEM. Of course, its a binary file, and you need XMODEM or CIS-"B" to
get it. (Catch 22).  Do you have an RS-DOS term program that does XMODEM
(Mikeyterm, Gregeterm, ULterm ) - then you could use one of the RS-DOS to OS9
transfer utilities? Good luck & keep trying. JohnW

No, all I have is deskmate and a modem pak. The modem pak will do an xmodem but
I have no way to put it on a disk. The modem pak without os9 will only access
cassete. Any way to download the file you mentioned and copy to disk? In other
words it MUST have line numbers or the computer will give an IO error. If it
does have line numbers it should work if not I guess it's catch 22 again. Any
Ideas?

Hmmmmm,

Plan A: I could convert it to an "S-record" ASCII file (see EXBIN and BINEX in
your OS9 manual) and then EMAIL it to you.  It might take you a few tries to
get a good download with no error correction. This assumes you have the OS9
Level I operating system (not just the bare boot that comes with Deskmate).
Plan B: Send me your address - I'll mail you a disk.

Hi.  Yes, there is some outift that will really rebiuild your MT32, for a
pretty stiff price.  Also I can buy a ROM upgrade to my Korg SW-8000 (that's
DW, not SW) that will add lots of features.

No I don't know the XTGEN2 interface -- just WD-1000A or whatever I got 4 years
ago for my B&B.

Yes, if your directory has more than 42 (I think) .UME files, Umuse3 knows it
can't save that much background, so it opens the window for the file names in
Non-Save mode.  I really should add code to redraw everything when you do
that.... Meanwhile, try splitting your UME files up by type of music, or synth
model, or mood, or whatever. Regards, mike k

There was a rumored version of a Level 2 upgrade that allowed you to use the

the MM/1 does that with the right button.

I hope that the OS9/COCO community will keep going strong. Many of us cannot
afford to move to one of the new machines. I realize that the commercial
programmers have to go where the money is. I also realize that the hobbyist
will support whatever machine they use the most.
 For example, MAX-10 is the only RS-DOS program I ever use. I just noticed
COCOPRO listed a NEWSPAPER-09 in this mnonths Rainbow. Does anyone have any
info on it? I still hope that the OS9 Level 2 upgrade will materialize. I hate
to keep haunting people about it...but... we need it badly. -Br. Jeremy, CSJW.

clear enough towrite code from?

I appreciate that you might not want to rely on my VIrtual Memory scheme, which
won't work on GIMIX boxes et al.  But my scheme could be easily converted to
Data Modules, which *do* work on any flavor OS9-L2.

Sounds like MFF1 files are like LYRA files -- you have to watch all the tracks
to see who's playing next!  Right, a RAM disk will help a lot, but virtual
memory would be much faster. I do intend to upload a sanitized copy of my virt
mem routines so anyone can use them.  I just uploaded my bit-banger serial MIDI
driver. {_Sheesh, you wastiong your gorgeous video theatre setup on RERUNS?!?

Hi Mike,

CIS costs too much and I *wish* the OS9UG would "move" to a cheaper place to

Hi James.  I got that source a while back -- don't remember whether it was from

working enuf to test it, but haven't seriously fooled with it. Would like to,
but many other things to do, like new UME features. BTW, the MM/1 port has
already helped add features and remove bugs from the Coco version -- it can now

There is a very old MTPanel program for diddling the MT32 -- pretty nice, all
written in C.  I have it here, but forget who wrote and uploaded it too. Larry
Miner did the Yamaha PSS480 version called PED.

Soon UME will have MIDI Events, both little 2-3 byte zaps from in the score
plus whole file writes.  Yer right, the factory patches could use a LOT of
work.  So could Roland's cursed note-dropping algorithms.  --mike k

 I've gotten over that little one, and have really had a good time entering and

"feel", but it worked great without it, IMHO. I bought dynacalc for $5.00 at
the same Rat Shack, BTW. Now, after not running my CoCo for almost two years,
it runs umuse3 on /term, dynacalc in /w1, and ubox3 in /w2, and stay on most of
the time.
 After noting how nice the windowing is on my home computer, we'er getting Sun
Workstations at work, using Sable C++ interpreter for debugging. Now *that* may

John;

  Me too... ordered in July and opted for the kit when it looked as though the
FCC was going to hold things up.   I've been told that I'm #39.

  Talking to Paul last week he said that they're shipping out 35 computers
twice weekly (this starting 6/10). 

  There's 2 ways of interpreting this... 
    35 x 2 = 70 computers/week   or
    17 x 2 = 35 computers/week

  Either way, it would seem that both you and I should have received our MM/1ds
by now.

  Paul said that mine is scheduled to be shipped on 6/30, which doesn't
compute at all... unless they're shipping NEW orders before those from us that
ordered almost a year ago.  One would think that back orders would be shipped
out first, and then new orders... at least that's the way I'd do it - support
those that believed enough in me to plunk down their hard-earned cash  when
this was just an idea!
Either something is rotten in Denmark, or we're not getting the full story,
and I'm almost ready to chuck the idea of an MM/1.

Jim - or it might mean that there were a lot of people who plunked down cash a

Very likely, all the small companies hand-assemble/pack the final computers,
and hand-copy the disks... that's a lot of work there alone.

And there's always the unexpected.  Lots of that, in parts, cases, deliveries
by suppliers etc.

You should see some of the complaints on other forums... and they're about
multimillion dollar companies!   So I think continued patience will work out in
this case.

  Understood -- no problem with the unexpected..  I kinda expected that <g>.
My problem comes from the lack of and mis-information coming from IMS. It's
kinda like standing at the counter in a busy store and being 'invisible' to
the clerks there.

  Yep, we decided to move after our first trip out there last summer.  Fell in

  By the same token, I would hope that my comments about information (lack of
and mis-) were not construed as 'casting aspersions'.  My intent was to veice
my frustrations about being 'in the dark' for so long and to hopefully clear
up some of the mis-information that's been spread about.

  Case in point:

  In the 1/7/91 kit announcement it was mentioned that the MM/1 has been
shipping to industrial users and developers since April, 1990.  At the end,
there is an invitation to place orders for FEBRUARY delivery.

  In the update file after the Rainbowfest:

IMS announces widespread shipping of MM/1 computers.
Currently, dozens of computers have been shipped...
The pace of shipping is now brisk. This week has seen the shipping of dozens...

  I could go on, but I think younsee my point.  In a dynamic situation, info
must be updated on a regular basis when you're dealing with customers.

  I can appreciate your busy schedule and coping with unforseen events as I'm
in the same situption.  My customers, while they might not like the delivery
schedule we've worked out, understand delays that are beyond my control, and
are quite understanding when they happen -- but ONLY when I inform them that a
situation has occurred!  Communication, therefore, has become a major part of
my job description.

  I apologize for putting you on the spot like this, but it looks as though
my note DID trigger the info we've all been looking for.

Jim,

You misunderstood my numbers, but they are not far off. Still, as I told you on
the phone, we ship out approximately in the order that we received the orders.

The variables that go into shipping are exactly these, just so you don't think
I'm keeping anything from you:

Who ordered what When do we receive cables for floppies, parallel ports, etc.
When are the modified cases ready Cash flow for that week When quantity
purchases need to be made Man power assigned to a given day

Once these factors are considered, a schedule is set up. When gaps occur,
simple to assemble kits are inserted from folks who ordered later. That means
that, in a given month, like June, we have approximatedly 10% of the folks
being shipped out that ordered somewhat later (like a few weeks later) than
folks who ship out in early July. The difference is only a few days.

We work three people around the clock to get these systems out. Each system,
with case and two board set, manuals, cables, boxing, labeling, and shipping,
takes approximately four hours. Others take longer when we go throught
inventory for extra drives, hard drives, custom cables, monitors, keyboards,
and so on. It is very complex.

No one here at IMS is holding you up. Data has been fluid as we have been
handling literally thousands of details.

Incidentally, ALL computer companies experience delays. Compaq recently told a
major customer that they were unable to ship for three months. Reason? Memory
chip availability at the price they wanted. In other words, they were pinching
dimes and holding up big customers. At least IMS doesn't do THAT!

Please do stay in touch at 202 232 4246. We'll tell you exactly what we know,
and what we cannot know, and we will tell you the day your kit ships.

Yours truly,

Paul Ward

One small problem, though, I forgot all about a monitor cable, so I haven't
been able to fire it up yet. Do you know if its easy to make a cable for a
CM-8? I'm going to try calling IMS this afternoon about one of their adapaters.

Bill, I don't know what the Monitor End of the CM8 cable looks like, but I do
have the pin-out for the COCO end (that 10 pin connector that comes with the
CM8) I had to make up a cable for the Magnavox monitor for my coco.  Knowing
the arrangement for the plug on the computer end of the cm8 cable, it shouldn't
be too hard to cook up an adaptor for the MM1.  Here goes. 1. Ground 2. Ground
3. Red 4. Green 5. Blue 6. No Connection 7. Sound 8. Horiz Sync 9. Vert Sync
10. Ground

Hope this helps.

information sheet that contains board layout, jumper configuration, etc. but it
didn't come with the kit. I have tried calling IMS for two days, but all I get

PC-XT at the office on a shelf (or in a drawer) behind Ed's desk. It has
pinouts for various things in it. Maybe you'll get lucky!

I managed to find a couple of files on the IBMHW and Zenith forms. It looks
like the pins match up one for one on a DB9 connector, so I'm going to go pick
up a coulple of DB9 connectors, I need one for the serial port too.

Thanks, Colin, I almost had it right, that is exactly what I needed. I have
tried calling him then, but apparently everyone else does too, since its
usually busy. The problem is compouned by the fact that I can't make long
distance credit card calls from work, so have to go outside to a pay phone.

One thing we have begun to implement is a voice contact with each customer
before shipping. It seems as though what people order and what we send are
accurate, but what people actually NEED is different, and we are learning the
questions to ask, e.g., what monitor are you using?

I did have the jumper descriptions all along, I was looking for an actual

The descriptions could have been more thorough, but the info is adequate for

Bill,

     If you ordered soon enough (as in when IMS said that the MM-1 was standard
with a CM-8 connector) then they will give you a cable FREE (if you really care
to wait for them to ship it, that is...).

     There is also the pinout for the MM-1 video connector in the latest issue
of The OSK'er.  I believe it matches the MM-1 pin-for-pin.  If you want me to
look it up for you, just yell and I'll be glad to do it.

Hi Paul,

Since I live alone and work during the day, I am hard to catch on the phone
before 5 or 6 EST.  I am home most evenings and weekends.  I will call you
Thursday or Friday.  Ummm, when we "doublecheck" my order, which of us will be
looking at a box of computer parts? - In other words, does this mean it will be
shipped sometime after next Thursday or Friday, (whimper), or you have already
shipped it and want to know if I got everything I wanted (LARGE Grin)?  How's
it going with the "old" SCSI chips in the second boards?  (If you toss a few in
the box with my MM1, I'll be happy to test them and ship back all but one-
hehe).

Your box is being burned in now. Shipment will be by UPS going out sometime
Tuesday or Wednesday. Sorry I can't be more specific, but you are one of
fourteen machines going out on those two days. Anyway, BEFORE we send it, we
need to make sure we are synchronized. We have an order summary printed, but
often Mary Kay Weglein did not ask questions like: Do you need a CM-8 adapter
cable? Do you need a 5.25" floppy to transfer data to the MM/1 from your CoCo?

So give a call.If you will be in over the weekend, call 202 232 4246 and leave
a message to that effect. I check the office voice mail once a day over the
weekend.

I will be at home on Sunday morning - will leave a message on your machine. In
case I miss connecting, here is some info.

Monitor - I have a Magnavox analog monitor xCM535 (forgot first character of
the model) - 640x200 analog or digital - uses an 8-pin DIN plug for input. I
have a home-made cable to connect it to the COCO, planned to just put a second
plug on the same cable when I got the MM1, but if you have a pre-made cable for
the magnavox, I'll buy it. Disks - My COCO has both 5-1/4 and 3-1/2 disks.  As
long as the highdensity drive in the MM1 can read a 720k 3-1/2 floppy, I should
have no problem with data transfer. I have a keyboard (NOT the brand that
someone mentioned he had trouble with). (I also have a 40m SCSI hard drive that
I hope will work when the second board comes through). I also have a large box
of tools and a lot of assorted connectors and wire - that MM1 WILL be up and
running the day it arrives.

Paul,

It's HERE.  The MM/1 arrived Thursday. I am a "happy camper".  Re the message
on your office phone, the 3.5 in high density drive that came with it was DEAD.
It took me a while to make sure I didn't have some jumper in the wrong place
(tried everything but exorcism and explosives) I bought another drive (I had
planned to get a second one anyway) - the second drive worked, but wouldn't get
all the way through a FORMAT - hung up at cluster 58h - sometimes a little
further.  Now I was sure I had fouled up somewhere (nobody gets TWO bad drives
in a row, right?). More checking.  After several hours, I took BOTH drives to
my local PC guy and hooked them to a working "286".  Sure enough, first one
DEAD, second one wouldn't format.  Third drive did it.  Just finished making
backups of all the distribution disks so I can do some serious fiddling. Wanted
to use the MM/1 to post this message, but the 9 to 25 pin Rs-232 adaptor I have
is the wrong gender (Murphy is with me) - I'll get one tommorrow. This message
complements of my faithful old Tandy 2000 - can't use the COCO either, it lost
its monitor to the MM/1.  I'd swear I heard the COCO whimper when I swiped it's
Magnavox - I may have to get it one of those close-out CM-8s to console it. 
Back to my new toy.

Later,

Oh, I almost forgot, where do I ship that DEAD drive?

I am number 19 on the list. According to Paul Ward, my system was shipped out
last Thursday, June 20. I haven't received it yet though. (I live in Canada, so
it is probably tied up at customs.)

Anyway, I dispute Paul's statement in his posting on 14 June that "dozens" of
systems had been shipped. Better not have been, as I was number 19 on the list.
;-)!!

Hopefully mine will be here soon. Ken Scales (#21) has his machine, but it was
initially sent without the disks. They arrived yesterday though. (24 June)

Well, no. Dozens implies (at least to me) more than one dozen, ie two dozen, or

Well, once again I thought I'd remind everyone I'm *still* awaiting responses
of any kind from the various articles and documentation I've uploaded over the
past 8 months or so.  I'm even dreaming up more projects to do on the CoCo3. 
I've not typed up or uploaded other things I've already accomplished because I
see we're not getting anywhere at all on the current items.  The Rainbow
magazine has even mentioned some of the articles (some are still too new), but
I've gotten no useful feedback whatsoever.  (I capture *every* message in the
OS9 forums on CIS and Delphi and look at my E-mail if any.)

Have we actually lost that many CoCo/OS9ers to the other wolves?  The only
other thing I can assume at this point:  Is everyone too busy with other
projects?

I'm *very* much ready to commence on the 12-bit Timer Driver/SVC for OS9, and
possibly updating the set of SMF Converters/Players to utilize it.  What I need

No, despite what some editorials and people say, I don't think we've "lost that
many to the wolves" :-)   Times are just tight, and people are very busy, at
the moment.  All you have to do is to read other computer forums to find out
that this is universally true.

I was going to reply to your grfdrv article months back, but lost both it and
my answer when my ramdisk got clobbered during a thunderstorm glitch.  I'll try
again.

Grfdrv uses a max window size table (which you gave patches for), and figures
the max gfx coords on the fly.  So no, it doesn't use IT.ROW directly. The
scaling math is hardcoded to 191 tho.

Your suggestions for either extending grfdrv into the extra block in the
graphics system map, or using it to map in longer screens, are valid. What I
used it for in the end, was as a place to map in a lookup mask drawing to
covered/overlapped windows.

You've given me another idea tho.  The OSK window system has totally separate
driver internals for each gfx mode.  The CoCo window system had it all together
within the 8K grfdrv module.  Perhaps if we split up grfdrv into specialized
modules, we could add more functionality and speed without using up more
graphics map space for a larger grfdrv.

That wasn't possible back when we had to worry about 128K systems, but how many
people have those now?  :-)  best - kev

Clyde - My name is Bill Healton, I have an Atari 520STfm. I have been running
OSK version 2.2 since mid-1988. I tried rz/sz but came up with the ever
prominent(on ST/OSK) Error #000:102; a bus error. This is apparently due to
the fact that unlike most of the other OSK systems, the ST leaves the low RAM
area available to Atari TOS calls (I/O mostly). The ST also has a hardware
generated bus error when this area is accessed in non-system mode. This
typically keeps most of the good programs from running. I would like to see
more programs work. I believe this can be accomplished by installing a bus
error handler routine if I can establish what is generating the errors.

The following is what running sz &rz with a "-?" option generates:
sz -?
Send file(s) with Zmodem/Ymodem/Xmodem Protocol
    (Y) = Option applies to YMODEM only
    (Z) = Option applies to ZMODEM only
Error 000:102

rz -?
rz 1.08 09-15-86 for Error 000:102


If you can determine what code could be generating the Error 000:102 this
would be a big help in trying to resolve this problem. I suspect any
non-variable/non-OS9 call, especially a D_xxxx direct access.

Thanks for your help...Bill Healton 73367,357

I just purchased an FD-502 at the new $59 price and want to add the second
drive to it.  When I opened the case, I noticed that RS used strange power
connectors for the drives.  Does anyone know where I can get adaptors for
normal floppy power connectors?  Alternatively, I suppose I could cut off the
connectors and replace them with normal connectors.  Does anyone know how the
new connectors should be wired?  One last question:  there is a second
connector coming from the power supply in addition to the power cable for the
second drive.  Any idea what that is for?  There doesn't seem to be any
corresponding cable connected to the first drive.

Thanks in advance, David Betz

David-
 The weird little connector is for the fan Tandy includes with /d1. Personally,
I've never used it, although I always reroute the ribbon cable so it doesn't
cover up the power suppy! I tried color to color on the weird drive power, that
didn't work on a TEAC 55B. So the old 501 pwr. supply is hacked in for now (BTW
the Kings Quest card exactly covers my TEAC as a case!) Although you can get an
adapter from CoCoPro! 1334 Byron Ave. Ypsilanti MI 48198 for $6.00. Best, Rick

Sb: #Allocation help
Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

I'm wondering if anyone has a suggestion for me. I'm using a singly linked list
to store strings of an unknown length. We I started I set up the following
structure:

 struct data{
   struct data *next;
   char *text;
 }

Then I'd malloc() memory for the structure and for the text storage. Of course,
the two memory requests are not necessary, so I'm now getting enough memory for
the 'next' pointer plus the text. The question is: is there an elegant way to
ensure portablility and make this a bit more readable later. For some reason,
the following leaves a great deal to be desired:

 woof=malloc(sizeof(struct foo)+strlen(buffer));
   ...check for valid p & setup links
 strcpy(woof+1,buffer);

I tried setting up a dummy pointer in the structure, but that doesn't seem to
work. The other solution is to have 'text' in the structure defined as 'char
text[1]' and then do the malloc() for sizeof(struct data)-1+strlen(buffer). One
of the problems with this is that we have to assume the order of the data in
the structure, and I don't believe that element 1 in a structure HAS to follow
element 2 (even though it does in most implementations). Guess the safest is to
do 2 malloc()s.

Any ideas?

The canonical C sleaze method is the trailing one-element array method.  C
*does* guarantee that the order of declaration corresponds to the order of
fields in memory for structures, aside from some fine print concerning bit
fields (the vagaries of byte ordering and the like don't let one say quite as
much about them as about plain old members of structures).  Strictly speaking,
the method doesn't *have* to work (an interpreted C, or some system with bounds
checking, --er, attempts--to go past the end of the array as declared), but in
practice it will work.

Not just that JJ/Bob, but aren't several compilers setup so that structures
start on word or longword boundaries? That could screw this up, and two mallocs
may be the best way to do it. Don't forget, malloc() may not have to call the
system twice if it preallocated a large enough block to begin with.

Pete/JJ, I think that the 'nicest' way to do the allocation *is* with two
malloc()s. But, even if malloc() doesn't need to call the system at all for
memory it still exacts a fairly heavy price in overhead. Each malloc() has to
keep track of the memory point and the size (I believe it uses a linked list
for this). Something like 8 bytes per call? The other un-nice thing about two
malloc()s is that two free()s are needed to get rid of the stored stuff--again,
not a big deal, but one more thing to go wrong!

BTW, I "discovered" an interesting thing about the the 68K compilier--it does
structure assignments and will pass structures by value (pushes the whole thing
onto the stack!). Don't ask just how I found this out <grin>.

Since you <grin>ned, I bet it was by passing a structure (sounds painful, eh?

Mark Griffith responds to several comments regarding IMS status ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
To All Those Waiting for an MM/1:

I understand how frustrating it can be waiting for a machine that you have
paid for so long ago.  I also realize how easy it is to let thoughts of
misdeed creep into your mind while thinking of your hard earned cash being
someplace else and not seeing anything for it.

Let me assure you that IMS is not intentionally withholding any machines from
anyone, nor are they shipping machines to new customers forcing older
customers to wait.  The process is slow.  Everyone involved has a steady
full-time job other than IMS and can only process orders evening and on the
weekends. Also, as Kevin pointed out, it is slow copying disk and putting
everything together by hand.

Also, there are the ever present problems with manufacturing the boards.
What do you do when the manufacturer makes a mistake and the first batch
of boards don't work?  You have to fix them all by hand which takes even
more time and pushes everything back.  What is something else happens on the
second batch?  Everyone is trying hard to get the machine out the door, but
there are always delays that cause expected shipping days to pass by with
out reaching the goals that were set.

Compound all this with the perchived absence of Paul Ward from the public eye
and people start crying "foul".  Paul is spendin ALL his spare time trying
to get the thousand and one things done that need to be taken care of each
day to keep this all running.  Add to that the need to promote the machine
and talk to financial backers, give demos, etc., he just doesn't have time to
appear here or on other forums.

So, give IMS a break.  They are working hard at it, and implying something
is rotten in Denmark just isn't being fair.

Some files were missing from the original MM/1 distribution disk set. The new

Well, after a few startup problems (all mine, by the way, the kit went together
flawlessly) I now have a working MM/1. Lots to learn, now that I can really get
my hands on OSK. From what Paul Ward has said (msg 11226) we should be getting
I/O boards soon, then I can really get going, since I can hook up a hard disk.
I picked up a CM-8 for $134 at a local Radio Shack today, so that will be my
MM/1 monitor for now.

That's fast! I'm online now with the MM/1 and Sterm. What is out there in the
terminal program market that I could use for VT52 or VT100 emulation? I need to
dial in to the mainframe at work (they're buying me a 9600 baud modem) but I
need something like VT100 to pull it off. I wrote my own terminal program for
my CoCo, but really don't want to do that again!

You should ask Kevin Darling about VT52 or VT100 emulation stuff. I know he's

To: All

  I've figured out where OSTerm v2.0.8 "cheats" and have changed it to call
some routines I've tacked onto the end.  These routines depend on a driver that
supports the enhanced SS.ComSt call (which returns 6551 style DSR+DCD status
info in the [B] register), such as DACIA/SACIA and most of the RiBBS supporting
drivers.  This allows the auto-dialer and some other functions to work fully,
no matter what serial hardware is used.
  I have put together an ARChive containing the IPatch file and brief
instructions, and uploaded it here.  Look for "O208IP.ARC" in the telcom (7)
data library.  DeArc is required to extract the files from the ARChive, and Bob
Santy's IPatch utility (from "PATCH.AR") is also required.

The printing biz which has been rough with many big shops closing their doors
does seem to be improving. I hope the rexession is over.  Still using os9
 level 2 on my coco and basic09 software to do estimating, history of jobs,
 paper orders, customer database, and a few other things.  I want to buy
 a new osk machine, learn C and connect my coco as a graphics terminal
 along with 2 or 3 other terminals in the shop.  What about extra rs232
 ports on the mm/1 I know you have 5 but I will likley need more? I hope
 to convert some of my printing programs to run under osk and make them
available.

What about a 'simple' step upwards??  Get a Tomcat9 instead of going into the
6800 series completely.

The TC9 is 6809 based, so you can use ALL of your current B09 and OS9 software,
plus, if you get the Tiger Card, you can run background animation from the
Tiger, while the TC9 runs another program.

(That's an EXAMPLE, the possibilities with the Tiger Card are limitless).

The TC9 (which I have ordered), will cost literally hundreds less than the
MM/1; run ALL of my current software at 2+ times the speed; plus with the
Tiger, opens up new programming possibilities.

While I do respect the possibilities of the 68000 based computers, the TC9
seems to me to be a more logical choice.  (It's a 'minor' step upwards, yet
could be a huge leap, too!)


As to C programming, that is the wave of the near future for computers. I
signed up for 3 courses in a local University on the language, as C (for the
next 10 or so years) WILL become the language of choice. It is able to be
ported to other systems, can manipulate bytes, data, strings, arrays, unlike
B09.  (I'd be a fool to say it's 'user-friendly'..., but in it's simplicity,
the power is overwhelming, compared to B09)

Good luck on your projects....also, please consider the TC9....might just be
what the doctor ordered....

I'd be very interested in hearing the basis on which the claim of a 2* speedup
between the CoCo 3 (presumably running at about 1.8 MHz, as it does under OS-9)
and the TC9 is made.  Is that overall, or for I/O bound or CPU bound programs,
or what?

Tell you what, as soon as I get my TC9, I'll post a message (or three - grin)

As I do run a BBS, and am quite familiar with loading times, etc., of my

 I hope to learn c, and port my software over to osk then I may try to market
 the package as a value added guy.  I am running out of process memory for
 some of the things I want to do and so osk instead of tc9.

 I have mentioned it to Paul Ward and he has some interest, however I cannot
 guarantee that I will reach a point that I can adequatly document or support
another printers use of it.  Also all my printing friends I have approached
 to test my system are not willing to buy the hardware.  I could not run
 my shop without it and we are more efficient, give our customers faster
 and more accurate info, and make fewer mistakes than with manual systems.
 Yet I cannot be sure another shop will be able to use it as well as I can.
 Should I find someone to beta test I will have something going in the

Hmmmm .... make me a deal big guy! I could be convinced.  ;-)

By the way, I've been yammering the benefits of the MM/1 to Barry Bond,
recently. A lightning storm cooked his 68000 system recently. Last word from
Frank Hogg (he purchased it years ago from him) was the damage was too
extensive to repair, so he finds himself in the market.

Might want to give him a call at 407 382-2816 and discuss his options. I'd bet

The dump looks fairly standard with the xception of the baud rate. You might
try coming up in 8bit mode,  (baud=4) and type = to 0 and see what happens.
With it set to 6, you're set to 9600 baud when you execute. Make the changes
before you run the term program.

path to another device from within a device driver.

However, don't do so within the driver's INIT routine, because the device table
is incomplete at the time, and can get screwed up on many versions of os9/osk.

I assume this is for a BBS thingie?  - kev

Thought y'all be interested in this:

It seems that MIT's Sea Grant Program, in the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles
Lab, uses OS-9 on a robot sub.  The MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab wrote the
main software.  Grad students get to work on it.

So now you know where to go to college :-)

I've been using the new CC3GO that reads a file /dd/sys/shell.parameters on
boot-up. This allows me to set path= when the startup shell dies. i.e.
path=/dd/cmds/apps /dd/cmds/utils /dd/cmds/rs.
 The problem shows up when I run mutliview. The shell it creates doesn't
respect PATH LIST of the parent shell and even if I open a window using the
gshell s-key and do a path= it doesn't help.
 The $20,000 question it can it be done, how and who's got e beef.

it back to $3F.  (or whatever dir e shows it to be)

select -- with any number for the drive number (0,1, or 2).  Anybody else ever
use this combo, or something similar?  The drives worked FINE under my old
XEBEC controller I got from Owlware (which doesn't work very well with the
DISTO interface). HELP!!  How should the jumpers on the ADAPTEC board be set
(got it from a surplus place, no docs, and ADAPTEC won't support retail

Fm: Robert Heller 71450,3432
To: anyone

I recently upgraded to OS-9/68K V2.4 on my Force CPU-30 and now have
some time to fuss with the tape drive (after backing up 25Meg to 40
floppies).  With this version of the SCSI drivers, my "oddball"
(Archive Scorpion (5945C) + Adaptec ACB3530 SCSI <=> QIC-36
controller), seems to work.  Sort of.  Using the Viper driver (meant
for Archive's QIC-150 SCSI drive) it reads QIC-24 tapes fine.  What it
writes is another matter.  I did a fsave and then tried a frestore -v
and got a message that the ident block was bad.  I then tried using a
PD tar program, but when I tried to read it, got a tar header checksum
error and my home-grown tar clone on my other machine (Stride 440 -
same type of drive, with Archives QIC-02 <=> QIC-36 controller board)
also had trouble reading the tape (various errors).

What I'd like to know:  do I need to write a completly new driver for
this combination or is there some minor thing I need to change with
one of the existing drivers to make this work?  Or is there something
wrong with the drive or controller board?  No driver errors are
reported in any case.

I would like to be able to use the tape for backups - using floppies
is a pain...

Robert,
 Since you just bought your upgrade, you should have some free tech support
coming from Microware (I believe 90 days). I know they support the Viper
drives, but do not know about others. You may have to write your own driver.
The driver for the Viper is sbviper. Good luck.

Dear Friends:


I have been working on converting Mike Sweet's CGFX library from C to BASIC09.
I almost have the dialog boxes routine converted. I have figured out how to do
radio buttons, and am now working on clickable buttons,etc. Still some bugs
though. I will be uploading what I have developed in about 2 to 3 weeks.

I would like to offer a suggestion. Often people develop little sub -routines
such as these while working on larger programs. For various reasons, they
choose not to make the source code of the entire finished program available.
While I have no problem with this, since most ask for a small donation and then
will offer the code to registered users, I would like all to consider being
willing to share these subroutines, or "snippetts" of code. Perhaps a sort of
Programmers Den or Tool Box Area.

I think that with the RS version of the COCO discontinued, and this time of
transition to the new machines, we need every one to support our little COCO's.
and share code, etc. I originally bought mine to interface with a Model
Railroad, as per a series by Bruce Chubb in Model RailRoader magazine (Feb
'84-Aug '86), later reprinted as Build your Own Universal Computer Interface,
by Tab Books.

Next one of my altar boys gave me a copy of Rainbow. Before long, diskdrives,
monitors, printers, etc entered my life. I bought a word processor program. And
after trying several settled on MAX-10. I recented noticed that Rainbow had a
COCOPRO add for a new OS9 WP. Has anyone tried it. It is called Newspaper-09.I
will be ordering one soon. I can already think of several enhancements that I
would like to see in it. (See MVWORD)

With all best wishes, Jeremy, CSJW.

I think on the rising incidence of rape, of fascist conservatism in the US, of

are not in fact in need of ministering. We are all a little developmentally
disabled, and it is often only through extensive self-deception that we make it

On the other hand, facing one's weaknesses, meeting the challenge, and growing,
make you strong. Only by admitting incompleteness can one hope to be more
complete.

Also, avoid wise advice such as this. The wise don't need it -- the fools won't

some files on what is known as copylefting over on Delphi. I will try to upload
it when I get the chance. Basically it is a plea for material to be released
uder copyright simply so that no one can claim exclusive rights to it. There is
talk of working out a deal for OS9 Level Two with Microware. Imagine full
source code available. Then the patches could be posted because the code was no
longer a "trade secret." I will try, as I said to post it in the next few days.
Jason explains this much better than I am doing so here. I hope that this

I may have mis-understood your question, but proper syntax for the newest
version of Sterm is:

Sterm -f -l /t2

where the -f option is the 'non-floppy' mode to allow B+ protocol, and the -l
option is used to indicate which serial port to use.

Sterm -?  will net a nice list of new options supported.

Hi,

If you read the docs, you'll notice you can define a modem port as an
environment variable and then you don't have to use the -l option to start
Sterm.  This applies for OSK only.  Put this in your startup file:

    setenv MODEM /t2 (or whatever port you want)

     This isn't hard. You unplug the Rom chip inside the disk controller and
then remove its socket. You then solder the smartwatch in its place, plug the
Rom into this, and solder a small jumper wire. If you can solder small IC pins
to printed boards reliably, you can do this.
     Don't make the mistake I made: I soldered the smartwatch in place of the
disk controller chip. It goes under the ROM chip.

Is there any way to open a window and switch to it within a shell script (CoCo

window. I have used the "type" program, which does open and switch, but if I
use type in a shell script then follow it with a command line, the command line
takes effect in the original window. Suggestions? Basically, I would like to
open a type 2 window, change to /r0 in that window, and run sterm with
parameters, all from a shell script.

Ian, yep you sure can.  Hope this does what you need:

  * script to create and select type 2 sterm window
  *
  (display 1b20 2 0 0 50 18 1 0 2 1b21 </2; sterm <>>/1&) >/w

Here's how that works.  The "(....)>/w"  starts a subshell with its standard
output pointing to a new window descriptor (and remember, scripts all begin
with the script file itself as the standard input!).  Stderr is still the
current window, tho.

The subshell then runs "display ...", which dwsets to stdout (the new window)
and then selects to stdout (the new window) using the extra "</2" to make sure
that the Select immediately works (stdin has to be the current window) from the
script.

Finally, Sterm is begun with its stdin/err redirected to whatever is stdout
using "<>>/1", which is also the new window.  All this must take place within
the same subshell () because we're doing this all to one main path.

Work it through... it's kind of fun to figure it out <grin>.  - kev

It took me a while to get this, but here is how you do those sterm commands.
Press and hold CTRL, and while holding it, press BREAK.  This generates your
ESCape for sterm.  Now release both keys.  Press the letter of the command. The
ESCape is "sticky", which means you don't have to press all three keys at the
same time.  Do this for ESC-Q and you should return to the shell OK. Since I
didn't see anything you posted earlier I can't diagnose exactly what's wrong. 
It seems you do it the same way I do when I use sterm.

Now if I can just get sterm to work with my Hayes-compatible modem....

care about modems.  All it does is open the port.  If something is not working
it is probably your serial port and/or driver.  If you can give some details
maybe we can help. Mark

I had an unsuccessful thread on my sterm problems a while ago.  Last I heard,
the xmodes of /t2(?) were to blame.  When I try to use my CoCoPRO! RS232 pak
and Hayes modem (DCD line forced high) with sterm 1.2, everything just locks
up.  CIS will not recognize me when I ctrl-c; local boards don't either. The AT
commands really don't even seem to work at all.  And neither does the esc-p
phone dialer.  Let me know what xmodes or anything else you need to know and
I'll see about sending it up.

Erich,

Sorry to hear you're still having trouble with sterm. Tell us, do the modem
lights dance when you hammer onthe keyboard in sterm? (is sterm commuicating
with the port?)

On the off chance that I somehow gave you a patched copy of sterm 1.2 to a port
other than /t2 (I use /t5), try calling the program and specificly indicate the
port:

 Sterm /t2

And by the way ... don't fret about the the dialer code. Mark yanked it in
later versions. It never worked the way he wanted.

Nope, nothing seems to ever reach the modem.  I especially suspect that
considering no AT command does anything.  I always specify a port since it
seems to be required.  Just sterm didn't work with anything (incl. the modem
pak) when I tried that.  It's been a good while, so I no longer recall exactly
what happened.

Tom,

Glad the diskette arrived in one piece!

Erich has explained how to do the <ESC> sequences. A bit of finger gymnastics,
but you'll get use to it.

You're calling it correctly ... you should just be able to pick up the phone ad
place a call to your local CIS number as you'd normally do. Get carrier, then
press the modem's connect button.

Can you give m a few more details on what exactly you're doing (step by step
would be helpful) ad what response (if any) you get back for either the system
or CIS.

I tried to get the esc function to work and be able to use sterm, but I have
had no success. I pressed cntrl(clear) and while holding it hit break and then
tried 1 at a time every command on the list. None of them responded. I start
off typing sterm/m1 and I get what appears to be a help menu with a list of
commands. The curser is at the bottom of the screen and isn't blinking. If I
try to connect with the modem nothing happens. None of the commands listed work
even if I hit all 3 keys at once.

Tom- Just started using sterm myself, but here is what's happened to me so far-
 STERM won't accept anything from me without a connect. If this is always true
that might explain the dead keyboard. My modempak is Y'ed in, so can't help
with slot placement,etc.
 After booting deskmate, STERM won't work anymore! DM seems to do something
wierd to the ports. If you are booting deskmate and then closing it to get a
shell, try killing startup and running STERM first, that's the only way I can
get mine to work.Mebbe someone can explain why this is so?

Tom- Actually, what I'm doing is booting STERM and waiting for the 'STERM is
online at 300 baud'. At this point, it won't accept any commands, but dailing
up anything gets it scooting along. Just a thought- I know all the CoCo3's with
multipaks need an IRQ mod, consisting of a diode and connecting all the pin 8's
together (see DIODE.TXT in Lib10). Don't know if a '2 needs this at all, but it
sounds like you are basically up and running in software,so maybe hardware?

A bit of diagnostics:

Bring up sterm by typing   sterm /m1 <enter>

Depress the connect button on the modem pak. This will give the impression of
having a carrier.

Now ... try and <esc> <h>, does the the help screen repeat itself? If so ...
then you're doing things right, and shold be ready to go. If not, give a shout,

Be on the lookout for an update to the original TMRDRV.TXT article called
TMRDR2.TXT.  A synopsis:

With help from some fellow OS9ers on Delphi, I've been narrowing down the
different methods that could be used in our Timer Driver.  Keep in mind the
need for much MUCH higher accuracy and resolution than the ol' VIRQ way, and we
also need absolutely the quickest way possible to action the user program into
gear when the timer does pop.

I also need to SET STANDARDS on the SVC Number(s), GetStat/SetStat numbers, and
the parameter structures.  We gotta have these things acceptable and "official"
with the community so people can write programs to use the 12-bit timer and to
have it behave in expected ways, not to mention a common access method.

We apparently no longer have a User Group -- we won't have an "official" body
who'd normally analyze and approve of an access method used by these kinds of
functions and projects.  You and I are the only ones that can tandemly agree
how to design and use these kinds of interfaces.

So I need your support .. and I need it NOW, please?

That depends on the particular make that the makefile is written to work with.
There was long ago a sort of primitive make, makefiles for which can, if I
recall correctly, be recognized by the = that appear at the beginning of some
of the lines.

There is a freely-copyable make that is more like Unix make than Microware's
make, and there's a make (I think freely copyable also) that was written to
work like Microware's make.

What it boils down to is, we'll need to see a sample of it before we could say.
Could you post the first few lines?

Kieth,

I've played with Rick's UUCP package, and it's nice!  BUT, you need to make
quite a few changes to the source code to get it to compile under OSK. He used
the _os9() 6809 routine for Get/Setstat calls which need to be changed to the
equivalent _gs_xxx or _ss_xxx functions in OSK.

What I did is used the preprocessor directive

 #ifdef OSK
 _gs_xxx
 #else
 ...
 ...
 _os9()
 #endif

Other than that, you need to use -DOSK when compiling the thing. So, if you
haven't done it before (Ported a program from the COCO) it will be a challenge,
but very doable.

I have sent E-Mail to Rick, asking for permission to port/post a new version
that will support both OSK and 6809 OS9.  SO you may want to hang on for a
while till I get a reply.  If he says "go for it", I'll post the sources here.

Tom- Glad you're STERMin! Thought I'd jump on your thread and leave a few
comments on CoCo3-
 Do you have 512K? If so, get a RAMDisk driver from Lib10. You can chd /r0 and
start STERM with -f /m1 (or -f -l ?m1 for 1.5), and B+ downloads really fly!
 Just remember to save the RAMDisk(oops!). Word of caution- if you haven't
upgraded
 the multipak do it right away. Semms the MPak and the '3s GIME 'fight it out'
for control of the system buss, so even when it works, it doesn't work.
 Things could explode! I've noticed Marty Goodman made a kit to convert your
ModemPak into a real RS-322 pak for cheap. If you're into hardware hacking at
all, call CoCoPro for a price.(Used to be about $25).

A RAM disk is one that exists solely in random-access memory; it's used to keep
stuff that wants to be accessed quickly and is either temporary, copied from a
permanent source, or copied back to a more permanent medium (because its
contents are forgotten as soon as you power down the system!).

My system has a 96K RAM disk; the device is named r0.  I can type "dir /r0"
just as I can type "dir /h0", and the analogous thing will happen.  I can type
"mdir >/r0/mdir.out" and the output of "mdir" will go to a file on the RAM
disk, named "mdir.out".  See what I mean?

Tom- An expansion or the previous answer-CServ (and STERM) can use the 'B+'
protocol,where CompuServ doesn't wait for your CoCo to check out the last block
sent before it sends the next one. The fly in the ointment is the stock RS disk
controller, which stops the CPU while it writes/reads the disk. SIince a
RAMDisk is a imaginary disk drive, it doesn't use the RS controller and saves
at the speed of RAM. Do a CTRL-ESC-Z on an xmodem download and see what all
those HALTs do for you! The RS-232 kit I told you about converts a modempak
into a 300-9600 baud serial port,although you lose the crappy modem. Best- Rick

Rick,

1 meg sounds nice but I think you need the 512K to be able to use it. That was
how I understood the ad I saw, the 1 meg upgrade required a 512K machiene to
start with. Any way they are getting cheaper all the time and who knows mabe
they will come out with even more. Someone has got to support these things
since Radio Shack won't.

You're using my favorite, already!

Sterm offers the best for the least hassle on CompuServe. The only suggestion I
could make would be to move up to the latest version (1.5) when you're ready.

There isn't much difference in features for your application but Mark has
improved the throughput slightly.

There's no hurry to do so. 1.2 is a solid implementation.

Thanks for the advice, I think I will just try them one at a time and see waht

How do I keep the help menu from scrolling half off the screen?

No can do, Tom ... at least as Mark wrote it. You can redisplay the the help

There's also a script around here somewhere that allows you to split your

Fm: Art Doyle 71565,262
To: ALL

Hi!


I have one of those strange mailing list applications where only the free form
spreadsheet data editing features of datamaster have proved adequate.
Unfortunately, I seem to have uncovered a bug in the program which prevents
it's use with a file of over 1000 records (24K), since it insists on crashing
with complete window lockup. I have tried experiments with known clean files,
and in every case, I can induce this problem when I get to the stated limits.

Since I have tried unsuccessfully on at least three separate occasions to buy
the latest copy of datamaster from Computerware, I am left with migration to
another program or possibly another platform to perform my tasks. Other
possibilities might include breaking the files up by using separate windows or
by indexing with profile's??? sorter.

In the past few years, I have purchased and put aside Sculptor, data-windows
and Van der Poels mailing list program as unsuitable. Datawindows may not be
the greatest filer out there, but it does perform this function well.

If any of you have the newer version of datamaster (1.01), and are not in need
of it, I would like to purchase it for full price. Alternately, if one of you
could prevail on Mr. Paul (Serby?) to sell me a copy it would be much
appreciated.

As you have probably surmised, my copy of datamaster was not purchased. It was
acquired ONLY after Computerware refused to sell it to me 3 times. It is the
only piece of software which I have ever obtained in this way. Unfortunately,
even this fact did not sway Computerware. After selling me the other programs
to interact with this code, they blocked completion of my system.

I don't know why Computerware became so embittered on this market, but
hopefully time has softened Mr. Serby's stance.

Suggestions?

Hmmm...looks like a Unix-like makefile to me.  (Microware's make thinks that
targets without suffixes have to be executables, which does sometimes get in
the way.)  You should look for one of the freely-copyable makes that take that
sort of makefile.

From what I've heard on the CoCo Forum, the gime chip is probably loose. Open
your CoCo if it is no longer under warranty and push the chip firmly back into
its socket.  Be sure you ground yourself (Radio Shack's antistatic wrist strap
is fine--attach the clip to the RF out jack).  To find the gime chip, the CoCo
Forum has a graphic called INSID.PIX or something like that which will show you
about where it is.

Hi!  First, I guess we need to know what flavor of OS-9 you're using... the
6809 or the 680x0 version?  Perhaps even what kind of system, in case someone
else has one (unless you're making your own, of course).

You might also want to change you forum name to your own name, instead of using
a company name (or use both, if possible).  Use the OPTions menu to do that.

Some of the libraries have summary files, but I find it easiest to just go to
each library and capture the output of a "sca/sho" command... which gives
names, dates, size and a one-line comment.

Again, welcome!  best - kevin

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

I'm having a weird problem with pipes and forks (sounds like a dinner...).
Here's the deal:

 1. Process1 opens a pipe,
 2. '1' starts process2 (a filter of some kind),
 3. '1' sends a bunch of data down the pipeline,
 4. '1' closes the pipe and waits for the child (process2) to end.

All this works fine if the program forks process2 directly. However, if I fork
'shell' with process2 as a param things hang up. The stuff I send down the
pipeline gets processed okay; but the child(ren) never die. I suppose I could
just forget about using the shell, but it'll take care of setting up the
command line for me which I'd have to do otherwise. Besided, it's really
bugging me.

This is all in C on OSK using os9exec() with fork().

I suspect that I have to terminate or wakeup someone with a signal. Not sure
who or what. Any suggestions?

Can I assume that you add a "&" on the shell line forking the child? Hmm. I
guess you must or your parent program wouldn't continue operation until the
child died.

I would think that when the parent closes the pipe, the child should die,
assuming the child dies when it detects the read error (or eof? not sure) on
the pipe.  Hmm.  Got a tiny example code which would fit up here?

Kevin,

Here's a bit of code. Remember, this is 'C' -- but since it just calls the
system F$Fork even die-hard assembler types like you should be able to help
<grin>:

First off, a bit of the section which starts the pipeline:

   char *argv[MAXARGS];
   FILE *out_file;
   int childnum, pipe, oldin, oldout, os9fork();
   extern char **environ;

   if((pipe=open("/pipe",S_IREAD+S_IWRITE))<0)
         terminate("Unable to open '/pipe'");;

   oldin=dup(0);   /* save current stdin/out */
   oldout=dup(1);

   close(0);        /* set stdin to new pipe file */
   dup(pipe);
   close(1);        /* set stdout to current output file */
   dup(fileno(out_file));

   argv[0]="shell";
   argv[1]=newprog;
   argv[2]=0;
   childnum=os9exec(os9fork,argv[0],argv,environ,0,0);

   close(0);       /* restore original stdin */
   dup  (oldin);
   close(oldin);

   close(1);        /* restore original stdout */
   dup  (oldout);
   close(oldout);

   if(childnum<0){      /* fork failure, close the pipe file */
      childnum=0;
      close(pipe);
      terminate("Unable to fork pipe process");
   }
   else{
      fclose(out_file);            /* close old output file */
      out_file=fdopen(pipe,"w");    /* set to pipefile */
   }

And here is the snippet which gives the problem.

   fclose(out_file);   /* close down the pipeline */

   /* wait for a pipe process to finish it's thing... */

   if(childnum){
      wait(0);
      childnum=0;
   }

Continued...

I can get the code in the last section to work perfectly simply by changing the
argrument list to:

   argv[0]=newprog;
   argv[1]=0;

When this is done 'newprog' is forked directly (and runs concurrently) with its
stdin/out redirected as needed. Then when its input is closed it nicely dies.
However, as written, there is a shell in between my main process and the child.
In this case the closing of the pipeline just causes things to hang forever.
Well, not forever -- if I hit CTRL-E the shell(?) dies along with the child and
things continue on as needed. I suppose I could send a terminate signal, but am
I guaranteed that the child will have finished if I do that? The reason for
using shell as an intermediary is that I don't want to have to rewrite the
parseing code to break up arguments (under OSK the shell, not cstart breaks up
the command line into null-terminated strings) and do redirection.

Bob -

A) Is it that the children never die, _or_ that the parent (actually
GRANDPARENT) never get a death notification? If this is the case, it's because
Shell breaks the parent/child lineage, and the child would have noone to report
to if the Shell goes away.

B) Have you tried the 'popen()' call? (if 6809)... If not, that's what you
probably want. Mirrors Unix 'popen()' exactly.. i.e.:

  int path;

  path = popen("procs", "r");    /* fork a 'procs' command; read its output */
   .....
  pclose(path);

Actually - I can't remember if popen is high level (fgets, etc.) or lower
level... I think now that it's HIGH level...

In any case, there should be a code fragment around that implements popen() in
LIB 3 if you're running 68K and haven't got it in the library.
