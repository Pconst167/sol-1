Kevin:

I have a question for you, I noticed that someone asked about putting the boot
in a EPROM. Do you think that it would be possible to burn every thing up to
the reading of the startup file in an EPROM? Some way of booting without a
floppy. I now have a SCSI HD using the Disto adapter and Ken Scales drivers.
And I have noticed that on bootup, it reads from /D0 up to the point of the
startup file, which is read from /DD (/H0).

By the way, does OS9 automaticly change to a hard drive as the primary drive
when one is on line?

If you have a large enough EPROM (typically around 32K), you can burn the whole
mess into EPROM. Most coco's are setup with 8K ROM slots though.

The thing that causes /D0 to be read is the preboot (part of track 34), and
then the Boot module. When the Boot module completes, it hands off to Os9,
which in turn runs Sysgo, CC3Go, or whatever is specified in the Init module.
The Init module also controls who the Root directory will be at startup, so
this is the place you need to tweak for HD startup.

Once you have customized your INIT module, cobbled a bootfile, and burned it
into ROM, you can do what you like.

Well, let's review the relevant boot sequences:

 1. DOS command loads in kernel track (REL,BOOT,OS9P1), executes it.
 2. REL relocates (copies) kernel track code to $ED00, sets GIME etc.
    REL then jumps to OS9P1.
 3. OS9P1 inits vars, verifies kernel modules, tries F$Link to INIT.
    Link fails, so does F$Boot which calls BOOT.
 4. BOOT loads in os9boot file from floppy.  OS9P1 can now find INIT.
 5. OS9P1 tries link to OS9P2, jumps to it (else does F$Boot).
 6. OS9P2 inits vars, checks INIT for default device, CHD/CHX to it
    (else F$Boot)
 7. OS9P2 checks INIT for default term, opens it.
 8. OS9P2 starts up CC3GO.
 9. CC3GO tries to CHD/CHX to /H0.  Does startup shell, etc.

To boot without a floppy, the best method is to make an EPROM which loads in a
kernel "track" off the hard disk... and also make a BOOT module which reads in
an OS9boot file from hard disk.  This leaves everything updateable, and the
only thing you have to really change is the BOOT module.

Still, you could burn everything (bootfile and all) into EPROM which copied
itself into RAM... with a BOOT module that just returned "okay".  Or change
OS9P1 slightly so that it verifies _all_ the EPROM'd modules (then BOOT
wouldn't get called at all!).

No sweat on the addressing of the message. I've forwarded it to 'ALL' as you
have requested.

On the lastest version of Sterm ... I still use 1.3. There may be another
release in test stage ... but 1.3 is the most current public release. The
screwup with the window seems to be tied to the Termcaps library, not
necessarily with the Sterm Code.

I'll check with Mark and see if there's an update coming anytime soon.

Kev,

Probably the only workable way to deal with MIDI output would be to have the
driver handle timing. This means passing timing information with the outgoing
MIDI data to the driver. It would end up being fairly complex. I think the most
realistic place for all this timing and stuff is out on a hardware interface,
rather than bogging down the CoCo with all those interrupts.

On the internet mailing address, those used for UUCP don't translate directly.
Example:

  Internet: pete@wlbr.imsd.contel.com

The imsd.contel.com is a domain name assigned to my company out here. It is
registered at SRI, where the internet numbers are controlled. Saying
'imsd.contel.com' is the same as using a Internet address (TCP/IP) of
 192.26.147.???. In our case, 'wlbr' is a local host with a node number of 8,
so the resolved Internet address for wlbr.imsd.contel.com is 192.26.147.8. The
'pete@' part just says that when it gets to that machine, further direct it to
user id 'pete'. Now - how this message gets routed from its source to
pete@wlbr.imsd.contel.com is a complex issue, and one I'm not slick enough to
explain.

The UUCP addresses however are VERY literal. In my case, the UUCP address would
be {major backbone sites}!jplgodo!wlbr!pete, where the message will actually
pass through each of the specified sites, until it reaches wlbr, and is
ultimately mailed to me.

I don't think it is a problem, particularly if things link ok. Re: _tidyup,
would be _referenced_ in putc_c and such before it is _defined_ in cfinish_a. 
This will cause the linker to snatch it out of the lib to satify the unresolved
reference.  It is a one pass linker, so you can only have forward references.

Bruce, I've been using the eliminator with the real time clock for about one
month now and I have noticed that the system seems to speed up about every 15
seconds (like a power burst) when I am running Pacos9. The momentary speed
increase only happens when I am using Pacos9 as far as I can tell. Any ideas on
why this is happening and how to solve it would be greatly appreciated

You know, that is sort of odd--there are times when I run pacos9 that things do
seem to speed up in short bursts, and the creatures seem to dash about the maze

Jim,
  I haven't seen a problem such as the momentary speed up that you describe,
but it sounds like a problem that could be caused by a marginal GIME chip.
Since the 60 Hz tick count of the GIME's VBORD IRQ is used by the RTC clock
module (same as the software clock module) that'd be the first thing to check.
  Do you happen to know what version (1986, 1987, or 1987A - I think those are
the versions the GIME has gone through) GIME chip you have?  If your CoCo 3 is
pretty old I'd suspect it had a questionable 1986 version GIME.
  Oh... before going out & replacing the GIME, sometimes all it takes is a
gentle press to seat it in its socket properly... if you don't mind opening the
case.
  Also, are you using a Multi-Pak Interface, and if so, is it upgraded for use
with the CoCo 3?  If its not upgraded, do that first before you do anything
else.

  Bruce

James,
     Put your tools and testers away <grin>, there is nothing wrong with the
hardware. The speedup you see in pacos9 is all software related. Kevin was
right about part of what you are noticeing, with the new GRFDRV installed the
ghosts will sometimes line up on a byte boundry which makes the gets/puts
faster, this is part of the speed increase. The other part of the speed
increase you see is if pacman is not moving, when pacman is stopped, the
processing time that would be devoted to moving pacman is now available for the
ghosts, which causes them to speed up.
   If Bruce Isted's VRN was available at the time, it could have been used to
fix that problem by setting the program up to move the objects under control of
interrupts.
   I had some code in the program that would waste the processing time that
pacman wasn't using, so that the ghosts didn't speed up noticeably, but I took
it out. It seemed terrible to be throwing away processing time and anyway the
more I thought about it, I thought that the speedup of the ghosts when pacman
stops might add a little more of a challenge to the game.
  So James....Do Not Attempt To Adjust Your Set
           We Are Controlling What You See....

Jim,

I've had a quick chance to play with the C version of dateck and have run up
against some concerns with what I'm sure you've considered as improvements.

Having to go hunting for screen.h tipped me off to some impending problems.
Looks like you're supporting  CoCo specific screen control. Doesn't look veddy
pretty on my Wyse 50. :-) The BASIC09 version was a straight ASCII version ...
jes?

Also ... it looks as if you've limited it's use to a single dates.file. I have
my system set up for dial up use and support a hand full of users... some of
which maintain their own dates.file. Any chance of changing that back? Would
make multi-user life better.

re: Multi-users
  Did you modify the original B09 source to allow multiple users?  I just
checked my latest source, and it's exactly the same as the C version. Are you
saying that the program needs to look at the userid and select the relevant
file depending on UID?  I'm kinda in the dark on this one, as both the C and
B09 source call for the dates.file to be in /DD/SYS... i.e. no provision for
multi-dates.files.

re: screen control
  Yeah, the B09 version used TABs to position the cursor, and in C, I opted to
go with the rudimentary calls in SCREEN.H.  What happens on the WYSE?  and more
importantly, can you point me to some generic C calls for positioning the next
output to be at a certain column/row?  I could do a little calculating of the
name field and write say, 60 - n blanks, but I was hoping to eliminate that
sort of stuff.

  Appreciate the feedback!

Regarding multiple users... best technique (unix apps do this) is get the
user's ID, and then use that to do a getpwuid() [forget if that's exactly what
it's called... see the password(3) function of the Clib docs]. That will return
a pointer to a structure that is the user's password file entry broken down.
One of the members of the structure is a pointer to a string that is the name
of that user's home [login] directory.

Once you know that, your program can chd() there, and then open the dateck data
file. This way, every user inherently gets access to his own file, and the
program is automatically multi-user.

Re: independent screen positioning... you just discovered what termcap is for.
Termcap allows you to make generic calls that are used to manipulate any
terminal that's being used (assming it has been defined by an entry in the
/dd/sys/termcap file, and you know the name of the terminal the user is using.
Pop over to DL3 and snag the two man pages discussing termcap that I recently
uploaded. I'll be happy to answer questions after that. Consider it an
investment in the future too, as OSK uses termcap too.

  Dunno if I want to get this esoteric in a pgm. that I'd like to keep as

 Ahh... looking at the original AR file, you're right... I did modify my copy
to specifically look in the /dd/sys directory during a cleanup of my root dir.

  You can easilt modify the C source to emulate the B09 program by just
deleting the "/dd/sys" portion of the INFILE def.  That way your users will
have access to their own dates.file in their OWN data dir.

 re: messed up output on the WYSE

  I'm going after Pete's termcap files right now, and will see what I can do
to make it a bit less machine specific.
  In the meantime, if you wished you could do something like :

 s_len = strlen(name);
 for (pos = 0; pos <= (54 - s_len); ++pos)
    fputs (x20,1);       /* not too sure on this.. haven't tried it */ 

 in place of the CURSOR(x,y); statements.

  Don't have a clue where the stray ASCII chars are coming from.

  Will get back to you after perusing the Termcap stuff.

Ok ... took a peek at my copy of the B09 source for version 1.2 (12/2/89) and
saw that filenam="dates.file". No reference to /dd/sys at all. Perhaps you have
changed that in a later version.

I was able to redirect standard out and err to a file and capture the output of
dateck that I see on my Wyse 50 (well almost ... there's a couple of screen
control characters missing at the begining of the date hit lines, but you'll
get the picture).  Capture follows:

<<>>

<cntl><B>!%Today is February 23, 91

Searching 02/23 to 03/25 :
02/28   Ash Wednesday<cntl><B>M%<cntl><B>!& 1st
03/17   St. Patrick's Day<cntl><B>M& 1st


<<>>

I had to change the ^B's to <cntl><B> to keep the CIS editor from sending me to
Mars, but you get the general drift.

I see Pete's already pointed you to termcap, so 'nuff said there.

Bruce, I am not using a multi pak interface. As well the problem does not seem
confined just to the one coco. I have a second newer coco3 that also has the
same problem as the older coco3. The problem I encounter is the same as James
Jones described in message 9206. The newer COCO3 was boughtin 1989 during the
coco clearance sales. The eliminator system I am running is composed of the
eliminator, on seagate st124 drive (20meg), one 40meg imprimis wren II drive,
one 3 1/2 720K drive and one 360K 5 1//4 drive. Also I am using a monochrome
monitor with the disto monocrome adapter on this system, along with one
joystick. Could the problem be with either the RTC or with pacos9?

Jim,
  I really don't know what the problem is... I have pacos9 (CRC $FE5BF0) but
I've never noticed any problem.  Of course, I don't play too many games, except
when I need a break and probably wouldn't notice a problem if it bit me.
  I doubt the problem is with the RTC, but you could check by making up a new
boot file that has the software clock module in it.

Jim - I've forgotten whether Pacos9 used the windowing system or not... if it
did, then perhaps it hits on the fast Grfdrv PUT boundaries now and again, and
that's the reason for the speedups you see.

He wrote it before that grfdrv was widely available, if I recall.

Bruce, after I sent my last message I discovered two interesting things. First,
the old grfdrv driver seems to work fine with the RTC. Only the new grfdrv
seems to cause the problem. Also, the system works fine with the new grfdrv if
the RTC is not used and the clock driver sent with the eliminator package is
used (or the old clock driver that came with OS9 Level II - I am presently
using your clock with my disto system and it works fine). Is it possible that
the new grfdrv is turning off the interupts?       Jim Pottage

Fm: Paul Rinear 73757,1413
To: Anyone

    I use an old printer that has trouble keeping up at 1200 baud.
 If I use xmode to set null=120, there is enough delay for it to
 work. However, consecutive line feeds are unbearably slow.
    I tried setting null back to zero and writing a filter that
 counts output characters until a 'return' and then sends a number
 of nulls based on this line length. The shorter the line the shorter
 the delay after a return.
    Using this command :
                         list filename ! filter > /t2

           I get no delay no matter how many null characters the
 filter sends out.
           Should this work, or is there something in the device
 descriptor that ignores these null characters ?

                                      ??????,
                                              Paul R.

Paul - your filter would have to do I$Read and I$Write (vs WriteLn which would
ignore nulls, you see).  What language are you using?  (if you don't

     I wrote it in C using getchar and putchar. No good?
  While on the subject of languages, I have another question: I got
  the Level I assembler (asm) so that I can assemble code generated
  by the Pascal translator program. It seems to work with no errors,
  but it leaves no object code anywhere. ??
     I ordered a copy of your book, Inside OS9 Level II, and there
  is a three week wait. Maybe it will help answer the last question
  I left (about renegade windows?).

I can't recall if Asm automatically leaves a module in your current CHX dir or
not.  If not, try something like "asm file o=filename"... been a while since I
did that.

On the filter, try redirecting its output to a file, and dumping it to see
what's actually coming out of your filter.  Might give some clues.

Paul -

Getchar and putchar use buffered I/O, which will intelligently select
I$writ/readln or I$write/read.... You'd be better off using read()/write()...
There's some skulduggery you can use to force binary operations, but this is
cleaner...

Re: asm no generating code... hmmm. Did you try:

 asm l o=/d0/cmds/woof woof #20k

The 'o' argument tells it to generate the binary... actually, you could have
omitted the filename and it would have defaulted to the execution dir and the
same name as the source.

  The 'o' argument works, and I get an output file. If I set the attributes and
then load the file, it shows up on an 'mdir' but will always load from disk
again when I try to run it. It also will load into memory without the execute
attribute set. This is utterly useless.
  I will try your suggestions on the C code.

If it loads from disk if it is already in memory, then very likely your MODULE
name is not the same as the FILENAME. Make sure that they are the same.

Also - I _dare_ you  to load an executable without execute permissions... are
you SURE it's actually in memory?

    My mistake on the attributes; I had the source code file named the same as
the executable and I attr'd that one.
    On the other point, it doesn't seem to matter if the module name is the
same as the disk file name or not, it still goes to the disk. The module is
definitely in memory. Makes me think that the module itself ia is accessing the
disk. It is only a test program of the 'hello world' sort.

If you type 'LOAD xxxxxx', it WILL go to the disk regardless. If you type
'xxxxxx', it will:

   a) See if the module is in memory... if yes, link to it and execute it.

   b) If NOT a, then see if it lives in the execution directory. If yes,
      load it, link to it, and execute it.

   c) If NOT a AND NOT b, then look for a file by that name in current
      data directory, and treat it as a shell script (i.e. fork another
      shell with it's input redirected to that filename.

See which of the above applies to you. Unless your program explicitly accesses
the disk itself, this is the behavior that will take place.

   I'm familiar with that. I "load test" then I "mdir" to check for it in
memory. It is there named 'test'. So I type "test" and it heads right for the
disk. So the module must be accessing the disk. Here is the source code:

$TITLE Test $SUBTITLE pas PROGRAM message (input,output); BEGIN
    write ('good grief') END.

Paul -

You didn't state previously that it was a Pascal module you were having
problems with (did you)?

If that's the case, pascal translated stuff requires a runtime support module
(not unlike Basic09's RunB) called Support (or Support1 or Support2, depending
on the parameters you use). That's probably what's getting the disk spun up.

Hi Kevin:

Like I mentioned before. I have applied the gshell+ patched to the gshell from
RS. Now I got the Gshell+ 1.24a. Everythings worked fine.

The  next  step  is  to  get my application  to  start  with  the aif.xxx file.

The palette of the control are set as follow: PALET0=0,0,0 PALET1=3,3,3
PALET2=2,2,0 PALET3=2,0,0 PALET4=3,0,2 PALET5=0,0,0 PALET6=3,2,3 PALET7=0,2,0
PALET8=3,2,1 PALET9=0,0,3 PALET10=0,1,0 PALET11=2,3,0 PALET12=3,1,1
PALET13=3,3,0 PALET14=2,0,3 PALET15=0,3,3

The aif.txt file for dynastar are set as follows: ds

ICONS/icon.txt 0 2 80 24 0 1

The result is a white background, amber foreground, and red menu. It  is  fine
on a RGB monitor but on a monochrome monitor  it  is impossible to read.

The   change  of foreground and background color in the aif  file have no
affect on the screen being set up by gshell.

The  following  aif.cal  file  for  dynacalc: dc

ICONS/icon.cal 0 2 80 24 0 1 resulted   in   black  background  and  blue 
foreground.    Also unreadable  on monochrome screen. The change of the aif.cal
file also have no effect.

What can I do to get a normal white on black type 2 screen?

Any help is apreciated.

Hmm. I think that palette 0 defaults to white, and 2 is black.  So change the

be Ninja, the popular CoCo 3 RS-DOS arcade game, has finally successfully been
ported over to OS-9.  The game coding was done by Glen Dahlgren (myself, an
RS-DOS game programmer for Sundog Systems) and ported by Kevin Darling (a name
known to all as the OS-9 guru) and Eddie Kuns (author of KBCom and contributing
editor for Rainbow magazine).  The result is simply fantastic. It was
originally created as a response to the statement by a well-known RS-DOS game
programmer that it was impossible to create a fast, well-programmed arcade game
under the OS-9 environment.  Kevin Darling took it as a challenge and, along
with a little help from Eddie and myself, ported the arcade game over to OS-9. 
Now OS-9ers can play one of the top CoCo 3 games without sacrificing your OS-9
features!  Have multiple Kyum-Gai's in memory at once. Multitask while playing!
Don't worry about moving to another window, as Kyum-Gai will auto-pause and
wait for your return!  This is a landmark piece of software and I'm glad to
announce, especially to those who have been waiting patiently for it, that it
is now shipping!  Now you can have an incredible CoCo 3 arcade game installed
on your hard drive!  Check out the ad in Rainbow and hopefully soon in the
OSKer!  It retails for $29.95, and can be purchased on-line in Delphi's
shopping service, or directly from Sundog Systems!  Thanks for your time!

I'm very glad to hear that it's now available--and if I remember rightly, Kevin
commented in a posting a while back that the code in Kyum-Gai was quite well
structured, simplifying the port considerably.

Expect an order from me shortly!

(Of course, there *is* the obvious followup question. :-)

Well, if the obvious followup question is where you can get a hold of it, I can
certainly answer that one!  Sundog Systems resides at:

We'd be glad to take your order!  ;-)

<grin>  The obvious followup question I had in mind was, what other games would
you be porting to OS-9?  (Obviousness, like beauty, is in the eye of the
beholder, I guess. :-) :-)  Thanks much for the address and phone number.

Ahhhh!!!  My idea of obvious is, of course, much different than your! <grin>
Actually, to answer your other obvious question, it really depends on the sales
of this program.  I've got a few well-known OS-9 authors who would be very
interested in converting other games.  If Kyum-Gai: to be Ninja (the OS-9
Version) proves itself in the marketplace, then I would be very open to the
idea.  Remember, you can promote this!  Word of mouth is one of the most
powerful movers in this market.  If a lot of people hear, and therefore buy,
the program, we'll be churning out more!

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

I notice in the termcap docs I have for os9-68000 that there is no definition
(name) for cursor on/off. The program I'm writing would like to do it's own
cursor stuff, if the terminal's cursor can be turned off . . . so, does anyone
know if there is a definition for this? I suppose that I could pick something
at random (from what I understand from termcap nothing is really predefined),
but I'd like to keep some consistancy. I guess the other way to handle this is
via the programs own config files, but it would be nice to keep all the output
things in termcap. Any suggestions appreciated.

I recently posted full termcap docs to DL3. You may want to refer to them (if
you haven't already). In the meantime, I don't know for sure if a cursor CAN be
turned off using conventional termcap.

Rory,

"Dead", the CoCo is not (just ask all of the people who are using it right
now!).

The CoCo line is being allowed to go SOWG (Sold Out When Gone) and there's no
replacement coming from Radio Shack, so the chances of seeing anything new from
Fort Worth are slim to absolutely none.

Of course, you can still buy TRS-80 Model 1 parts from Tandy, today, so the
technical support for the computer will continue for a while.

What next?  You can (a) stay with the CoCo or (b) go to another platform. If
you're interested in OS-9, there are much worse platforms to use than a CoCo-3
running OS-9 level 2.

  Anybody have any experience with ASM on the HP-9000? I'm in a 68000 ASM class
with about 50 other students, and needless to say, the lab instructor's time is
at a premium.

  What I'm looking for is the cmds to asm and link my source file to produce an
executable.  I can get it to asm O.K., but can't get it to link with the
externs to produce runnable code.  Any input welcome!!! (gotta use the HP until
my MM/1 arrives!)

Is anyone using a Seagate ST-225N hardrive with the Disto 4in1 ?

If so, could someone shed a little insight on formatting the drive using
Disto's Low Level Formatter ?

I get nothing but errors, all of the time.  Does the 4in1 require a voltage
input in order for the hard drive controller to work ?

I have just about run out of patience trying to format this Hard Drive, I don't
think there is a problem with the Drive itself, but if this keeps on, it will
make a good doorstop.

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

In writing my VED text editor for OSK I've come up with a minor problem. It
seems that OSK does not have a standard SS.Screen_Size status call. I
understand that Kevin's drivers for the MM/1 will have that, but using this
will mean that the program will only work in that in that environment. VED will
use termcap to determine all the other terminal stuff, but using termcap to get
the size is a problem since termcap does not know about windows (Kevs or anyone
elses). My plan is to use a small auxillary program called Ved_size (or
something else equally creative) which would simply get the screen size either
as a constant or via a getstt and exit with the size as its F$Exit paramater.
As new drivers etc. are developed the user would need to replace this program.
I was thinking that VED could fork to ved_size and get the resultant
information from the error status returned to F$wait (use the lower half of the
long word for the columns, the upper for the rows...). It does seem rather
convoluted to me...anyone with a better idea? Comments?

BTW, VED is up and running on my single board MM/1. Some debugging left to do,
etc., but it should be ready for market within a month or so. Now I just have
to decide if I should follow my low-price philosophy or try to hang on to the
high-price one the OSK market seems to like.

Well... don't fork to ved_size, but call it as a subroutine module instead?

PS: sorry haven't answered you about control codes.  I understand that you have
one of the non-palette prototype machines?  The latest driver hasn't been
back-ported to that one yet... and I've forgotten what codes the old driver
supported.  The new one supports many more.  Hang tight. Working on it. best -

You can't use the lines and columns entries in the termcap? These would be fine
for conventional terminals, and the scsize call would be supported for winders.
Sounds as if your bases are already covered...

Re: pricing philosophy.... remember two things -

a) A lot of GOOD PD stuff is available (uemacs, stevie [vi clone], etc.) that
has been or is a candidate for being ported to an OSK environment.

b) Keeping prices within the impulse-buy range is certain to net you a greater
volume of sales.

The formatting for the St225N ussually gives an error on the first attempt, Try
formatting a second time without shutting the system down. A better plan would
be to contact Ken Scales on Delfi, or leave him electronic mail on compuserve.
He has a new patch for the disto SCSI drivers which solve a problem encountered
on booting up, and also allow formatting. They also allow better multi tasking.
If you can not get a hold of him leave me another  message and I will contact
him for you
