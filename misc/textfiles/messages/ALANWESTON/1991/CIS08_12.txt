Hello Pete: I am using cgfx ver 7 of the lib.

The SRC de i The SRC dir is on the hard drive

The cc that I am using is the one from tandy.

Also the cstart.r

The only thing that I modifided with the cc was for it to look at /dd instead
of /d0 (/dd = 40 Meg hard drive)

There's the problem.. I believe c.prep and possibly c.link also have hard
references  to /d0.... Browse the DL3 area for a definitive listing of patches.

Pete:

I figuered it out, I THINK.

I had rma and rlink renamed as c.asm and c.link on the hard drive /dd but not
the module. I THOUGH I DID THAT THOUGH.

I used EZGEN to do the following: ezgen /dd/cmds/c.asm l rma r c.asm v q

Any how it works now, as before this error. I must have copyed the NEW asm ,
rma to the hard disk after I got it and forgot to rename it interenally.

Thanks for the HELP.

Another question, How do you set up a graphics screen under C?

As far as I have gotten is, I can clear the screen and write my name there.

THANKS AGAIN.

Keith,
     Here's my standard code for opening up a graphics window from within a C
program:

 #define PATH fileno(wout)

 main() {
      FILE *win,*wout;

      win=fopen("/w","r+");
      wout=fdopen(fileno(win),"w");
      DWSet(PATH,8,0,0,40,24,15,0,0);
      Select(PATH);
 }

This should get you up and going.  If you have any other questions about the
graphics library give a yell.

Hi Glen.  Just thought I would give you a chance to see a message from my new
toy (TC70) Boy is it a good thing that I got this running - this afternoon the
COCO died. Will run happily and run rom games but cannot receive data from the
disks. I can control them - do dirs etc - but just get no data.  Sounds like
that famous replace the 68b09 bug has bit. This comes courtesy STERM 1.51 on
the  TC70 where it runs like a champ - not even recompiled.  Funny thing is it
runs from the screen fine but fails from the /TERM terminal whereas the comms
program supplied with the machine runs from /TERM but dies from the screen
(labelled VT70).  Time to download the source and try to figure things out.

PS: I tried it once in an old Tandy 2000 case.  Tips: be sure to hook up at

supplies may not turn on enuf juice with just the coco board in there. Second:
some supplies may require a large filter capacitor placed on your 5 volt
connection to the coco.  I think the files may mention this tho.

Paul,

I believe that Deskmate strips the high order bit (the 8th bit) out of what is
being sent to the display so that loging in at 8N1 makes it appear that
everything is kosher.

If I remember right (and if I don't you can be sure that someone will be here
to set me straight) OS-9's drivers don't have the capability to switch from 7E1
to 8N1 on the fly, once connection has been made.  Thus, switching is a process
of closing the previously open path, changing the parameters, and then
reopening the path.... quite a lot to get done.  Like I said.. if I'm wrong,
someone'll hit me upside the head with the correct info (and I do sometimes get
confused about which computer I'm using at the time).

A stat call was added with OS9 LII that allows changing baud rate, word length
and parity on the fly. You are correct, though, about what had to be done with
ACIAPAK under OS9 LI on the CoCo. Even now, some terminal programs do it the
hard way, either because nobody ever changed them, or wanted to keep
compatability with LI.

This sounds like a baud rate mismatch. Sterm uses the baud rate set in the
descriptor (T2). Do you get any response from the modem after connecting? Do
you see the timeout message from CompuServe?

Try setting the baud rate in T2, like this:

 xmode /t2 baud=4

This will set the baud rate to 2400 baud. Also, its important _not_ to INIZ T2,
since that will lock in the initial baud rate. Also, do the xmode before
starting Sterm, as long as Sterm is running, and the path to T2 opened, xmode
will not have any effect.

What's happening with the modem lights? Is CD lit all the time? How about TR?
What happens to TX and RX (maybe called SD/RD) when you bang on the keyboard
while in sterm?

Whelp, there was definitely a baud rate mismatch:  modem didn't throttle down
to 300 or 1200 from 2400 where it powers up (HS & MR are lit). As soon as sterm
boots, TR lights; SD & RD blink when keyboard is hit, but CD never lights.

So I tried booting sterm from xmode /t2 baud=4  with the same results.

Then I tried some null modem sterm xmodem transfers to a  floppy, then the same
file to a ramdisk.  The file was over 100kbytes. A stopwatch showed a savings
of 25% when using the ramdisk!  But I also notice how it is that all the time
computers save me, I spend learning more about computers!

Rechecked null-modem, xmodem transfers to a floppy & ramdisk;  original
findings stand for Sterm:  25+% savings to a ramdisk over
a floppy.  This seems to be unique to Sterm, and the transfer stats appear to
be in error for the floppy transfer.
Retried the same experiment using Uterm and the transfer times for both floppy
& ramdisk were comparible, only a few % faster for the ram save.

My CD laight is on when I use Sterm. Infact, the RS232 pak requires an active

If your modem is Hayes compliant, an AT&C should fix you up. Otherwise a quick

Per the Hayes 'AT' command set default grammar and syntax, an omission is the
same as a '0'. The supposed result is that you have effectively typed an

What Pete said!   :-)


Just kidding ...

With the non dip switched Hayes compatable modems that have been shipping for,
say, the last 5 years or so, the AT command set is how one programs the modem.

The &C parameter controls the condition of the DCD (or carrier detect) line. By
typing AT&C you're telling the modem to make that line high at all time. This
would be the same thing as we used to do by jumpering pins 6-8 and 20 together.

The ACIAPAK requires a high signal on DCD before it will respond to you.

Better?

Ok, AT&C got the CD lamp lit.  I got on line and logged on ok.  When
downloading, what option does one choose from the CIS menu?  Is it
Ymodem,  send-ahead, B+, for the quickest, most efficient transfer?

Also, what option is used from Sterm menu? Only xmodem is given.  If you boot

Paul,

When using Sterm on CIS you're missing the boat if you're not using B protocol.
It's by far the most efficient protocol on this service.

It's built in to STERM ... no commands necessary. Enter the library of choice,
select a file to retrieve and type DOW. The two computers work out the details
by themselves asking you a couple of questions about protocol and transfer type

On the '-f' option you're correct. If you don't have a hard drive, you must be
transfering from a RAM disk.

Not to worry if you pick inadvertantly invoke the 'f' option. B proto is smart
enough to know when it's going up hill and drop down to Classic B when needed.

Hi! They changed their minds (or lost them <g>) - we're getting HP 9000/700

running OSK that I won't notice too many differences except for not getting

I checked it out and the LED's are active.  I also tried out xcom9 with the
help of the docs i found.  It won't work with /t2 either.  When on CIS, I lose
the first 4 characters of every displayed line.  I was hoping to use xcom9 to
just get another term program but I can't get it into command mode to start the
download.  At least CIS timed out in one minute rather than the usual five.

Erich,

With the LED active and you're actually getting online I'm begining to suspect
an interupt problem. Dropping characters sounds too much like the old IRQ
issue. Have you performed the IRQ hack? I perfer this method over that of the
diode hack approach. Haven't heard of one of those working correctly yet!

Stock OS9 software has problems with missed interupts. THe hardware solution is
the imfamous IRQHHAK as described by Pete in LIB 10's IRQHAK.TXT.

Others have suggested a diode approach. While it's theory is sound, I've not
seen it work here or elsewhere. Apparently the choice of diode is critical.

Another thought crossed my mind on your dropped chharacter problems. What type
of window are you trying to run sterm in? If it's a Graphic window, then that
may be contributing to your problems. Screen updates on a graphic type window
are too slow to keep up at 2400 baud.

Without the IRQ hack and perhaps on a graphic window, things would look like
heck!

It is a 80*24 text window that I've been having these problems in.  I finally
tried out sterm on a local board so I can download a 180K(!) GIF at 1200bps.
Same problems but better than I'd ever seen it.  They don't have CIS B protocol
so I tried esc-S to shell out to XYDOWN and get it by YMODEM.  They timed out
with 0 bytes transferred.  I immediately got a message that sterm was back
online as soon as the disk drive stopped.  No other indication of problems.

I do complete the logon process.  As far as I know I am not going into command
mode since CIS still responds to OFF. But as soon as CIS is supposed to display
my custom logon menu, I just get a lot of garbage.  The right characters for
the most part get here but only a few show up on each line; ;and usually only
every other line has anything on it.  And the text scrolls by me very fast.

An easy way to confirm the IRQ issue would be to slow things down to 1200 or
300 baud. If you don't see any missing characters then we've found your
problem.

One is the famous DED.AR which I believe is in Lib 10.  The other is SWAVE.AR
which I believe is in Lib 6.  I may be getting the GCS File Transfer Utilities
as advertised in Rainbow.  They say that will handle both DECB and PC disks-a
plus for me.  So I could then GCS OS-9 files to OS-9 and properly de-Ar them. 
I wrote to them to ask for some more info about the program.

 Just an idle question- if you have OS9, and want an OS9 file, why used DECB?
If using the 'banger' port,  I know there's drives for Lvl2 and I *think* even
a Lvl1 version,thou I might have seen that one elsewere. Couldn't help but
wonder, since DOSOR9 sounds like extra work anyway.

The Telecom section has a couple of threads I started where Steve Wegert and I

In dosor9 try adding this line:

I'm not sure if I RENUMmed any lines so the above should follow this:

Either IRQ hack should have no ill effect upon the proper operation of your

Personally, I've not had much success (nor have I heard of others) with the

Pete,

I'm sending you this message a second time, looks like you didn't get it the
first time (maybe I screwed up you ID).  Anyway...

Would it be OK for me to upload your X10 software package on Delphi?  People

As long as is distributed in BOTH of its original packages, then I guess

 Just another problem- When using STERM, I get exactly 484 blocks,and then the

switch and CLEAR key. I've got RAM and disk space, but after mucho downloado,
I'd like the rest of the file,also. I waited untill 32 errors before hanging up
last time,and tried every ESC sequence in the docs to no avail.Can SOMEBODY
help? (whimper)

I am now using sterm at 1200 baud.  It's working pretty much.  But I am still
getting some lost characters and garbage.  I wouldn't trust this program with a
download like this.  I'll try xcom9 next.  I suppose I could try out 300 baud
but if I am going to do that it would be easier to just use the modem pak.

Ok ... this is good news!

With the dropped characters going away as you drop baud rate, it's pretty much
assured it's an IRQ problem.

First step is to immediately install the hack. It's simple, and reversible _if_
you're careful.

To output a tab: putchar('\t'); However, it will not display on a CoCo window
because code 9, normally used for tabs, is instead cursor up.  There is no
'tab' on CoCo windows.

To get a key, try the following routine:

inkey() {
  char c;

  read(0,&c,1);
  return(c); }

That reads one character from STDIN direct, places it in c, and returns tha
value to the caller.

You can send mail to a CIS account from the Internet by mailing to:
USERID@compuserve.com, where USERID is the desired individual. In my case,
that'd be:

   76703.4230@compuserve.com

NOTE: use a PERIOD to separate the numbers... not a comma.

I believe to SEND to the Internet, you have to preface the address with
something like:

INTERNET>{address}

Try GO EASY, and then ask for HELP.

Hi all, I'm new in this forum, so I don't know if I got the right section
number... My problem is the following: I got an Atari-ST with Cumana OS-9 Level
II, Version 2.1 (I heard it's not the newest one, but I don't know what newer
releases offer). Until now I used a normal 20M SH205 harddisk with a 9M OS-9
partition. Now, since a week, I got an additional drive, actually a removable
cartridge with 44M disks and prepared a cartridge for OS-9. But, as it's a
second drive on the Atari DMA, I have to run it on host adapter address 1
instead of 0, which still is used by the SH205. I tried just to add h1 to
OS9Boot, but I was never able to access the second drive under OS-9. The only
thing I could do was to put the host adapter of the second drive to 0 and turn
off the SH205, this way I was able to install OS-9 and use it, but this way I
can't access my "old" OS-9 partition. But at least to transfer files from the
old partition to the new one, I'd be very happy to be able to access both
drives at the same time - does anybody know how to reach it, or where I can get
a driver that can manage to install a drive on another host adapter address
than 0? I know that this question probably sounds a bit stupid, but maybe
somebody has just an easy answer.... who knows ;) Thanks in advance, and sorry
for my bad English (actually I'm Swiss, that's why), greetings,
            Andy

Greetings, Andy!

I suspect that you're the only Cumana port owner here, altho several people use
the US version on the ST.

In fact, there was a very recent question about using two SCSI devices on the
US version, and apparently it doesn't handle more than one, either.

I'll ask around elsewhere for you.  But until someone (I might try) works on a
HD driver which uses the SCSI ID byte, I think people are stuck with only one
device.

of us should test that.

If the internet ftpmail site can uuencode the data first tho, wouldn't that
work?  Assuming they will, of course.

Hi Scott--I started using the function inkey and it does the job buttttt. The
program will not execute the previous printf statement until the function
returns.
     printf("this will not print");
     ch=inkey();
     printf("next statement");

If I enter the letter 'x' then what I will get is: xthis will not print next
statement

It will sit and wait down in the inkey function and after an entry, it will
execute the previous printf and immediately the next printf ??????

Phil,
     I think I can help you out here.  First, all FILE I/O is buffered. C
doesn't send anything to the screen until either a charage return is
encountered or until its buffer is full ( 256 characters by default). If you
want your first string to be sent to the screen before the inkey you either
have to put a /n at the end of it or fflush(stdout). Second, the program hangs
in inkey because it does its read system call without checking for data
available.  The os9 read call sits around waiting for a keypress if there is no
data in the device driver buffer to send.  You need to do something like:

 If(getstat(1,fileno(stdin))==0)
      read(fileno(stdin),&ch,1);

Hope this makes sense.  Buffering does make keyboard/screen I/O a bit clumsy at
times.

I'm just getting back to this C Compiler problem that I mentioned a couple of

Anyway, it appears that it is a compiler bug.  Great.  I've got this good sized
structure that I need to initialize and I REALLY don't want to retype several
hundred lines of initialization if I don't have to.  Is there anyway to get
around this problem?  Something that I could do with a global change in an
editor?  I'll mess around with this myself a bit but I B no C guru....

I suppose that there no chance of getting Tandy to fix this?

I'd say there's minimal chance of getting Tandy to fix it.  About the best one
could do, at some expense in data space, is separately declare some pointers to
the strings you have in the structure initializers, and--no, that wouldn't do
it.  Unfortunately, there's not a good way to do it, and even the least bad way
would double the storage requirements for the strings.

To: All

Attion all Disto Super Controller Users. I have recently solved a rather
lengthy problem with my hard drive. Over the past year I have had 4 SCSI drives
crash on my machine. All of them were completely destroyed by my system. After
a great deal of trial and error I finally found that my 2 in 1 board was
defective and was blowing the drives. Three of the four drives were never even
formatted because they died on the initial format. I had the interface (2 in 1)
tested by CRC and after they destroyed one of their drives they confirmed that
the card was indeed the problem. Sunsequently I have had a report from Jim
Snider (who I believe is a technician for COCO Pro???) report that he has heard
of this also happening with a few four in one boards. I do not believe this is
a wide spread problem, but it is something to keep in mind if your hard drive
crashes. Moreover, CRC stated that they had never encountered this problem
before, so it will probably never affect most users. If you have had a similar
problem please leave a message on the board and check your controller. As well,
it may be of some interest that the drives that I blew were Seagate St125N's
and ST157N'S and the ones reported by Jime Snider were ST157N's.

Some questions: 1. Under Multivue, certain applications allow you to size a
window by dragging the mouse from one point to another (CALC and CLOCK). Pg
2-17 of the Tandy MV Manual.

2. On pg 2-16 of the Manual it states that you can have two or more
applications running on the same screen at one time.

Can the first be done under BASIC09 and if so does anyone have some code to
share that shows how?

How do you open multiple windows on one screen under BASIC09. In my startup
file I do this with display codes, based on a script by Rick Adams that I got
on Delphi. (I hope I spelled his name correctly.)

Finally I use the patched versions of GSHELL. One thing I have wondered, is
there anyway to change the icons used for the disk drives? If I was to 
disasemble Gshell, using the Disasembler available on CIS, where would I be
looking for to find the "icons"? If I could do it, I would like to  then
develope a Hard Disk icons. If I can do it, I will be happy to upload the
patches?

I haven't been able to get as much programming work done as I would like to,
what with my obligations at the Monastery and outside work, but I hope to soon
have my dialog box maker ready to upload. I may just upload what I have at the
end of the month as a fixer-upper," if it is not completed.
