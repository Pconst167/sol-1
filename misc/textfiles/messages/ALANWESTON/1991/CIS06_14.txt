I had written up some patches for TSMON/LOGIN for using LI's under LII some
time ago (in fact, I believe they were published in Kevin Darlings INSIDE OS9
LII book). They may be in DL10 or DL9. If not, SOMEONE will have access to
them.

Some time ago I saw a product advertised that allow you to use part of a hard
drive for basic and part for OS9.  I don't remember the name of the product or
the company. Does anyone know of such a product.

I am using shell+ 2.1 and I divided my CMDS directory into three parts. After
defining extra paths the these directories everthing runs fine, except icannot
load commands from these directories without using full path list.  Does anyone
know of a way around this, such as a LOAD command that makes use of the path
list provided by shell+?

                                    thank

Well, here's how I have it in my program. Its after I close all paths that I
have open. The syntax was SHELL "tmode echo" or SHELL "tmode -echo" at the
beginning of the program. I had better results when I set it as a varible
first. e.g. b$="tmode echo"\ SHELL b$
 After the 201 error would occur, then it went into debug mode and scroll like
this:

 D:what?
 D:what?
 D:what?

The only way I could make it quit was to turn off the computer and reboot.
Needless to say, I would sometimes have to rewrite something
 that I had programmed in. What a pain! I started saving everything before I
would test run it from then on. Thanks for the help. :-)

Hmmmm.  Sounds like you managed to close the standard paths, so that poor old
BASIC09 would try to read a command in debug mode and fail.  Check the places
in your code where you explicitly close paths, and make sure you have the path
numbers you intend to close in the variables that appear after the # in the
CLOSE command.

I have found the FD500 series of power supplies very marginal. I have two
half-height drives hooked to mine and one day the transformer smoked out
(overloaded) Since then I replaced it (using two larger transformers a 18V and
a 12V 2 amp each from RS) for the two regulators and bought the 1" micro fan
from them. Using a small dropping resistor to quiet the fan (plus you

don't need all the windflow) it runs quiet and cool now. The transformers are
outside the case now.

I dunno one of these days I think ill just get a big switching power supply and
run all my drives from it and eliminate the hassles (plus save plus in my
strip!)

What I am starting to think of doing is designing my own power supply and
making it completely external.  I will then remove the present AC cord and put
in its place a new cable for power which will terminate where the present
supply does.  I'm thinking of designing so I have total control over the size
of the transformer, the filter capacitor and/or inductor, and the degree of
regulation.  Just one other problem tho:  I still have some warranty time which
I would rather not kill; RS has told me that installing a second drive will not
void it, after all, the manual has step-by-step instructions

Well you could try the second drive to see if the power supply gives you
problems. If you order the drive from them it should include the fan but
probably the best bet is to buy the drive third party and save some $$$.

The two connectors are already in there. just a matter of plugging it in and
your set. One word of caution. the FD502's sometimes don't turn the motors on
without a drive select. I don't know if they corrected the problem but if your
adding a second drive you must check for this. Simply do a dir1 (in rsdos) and
look and see if drive 0 motor is spinning. then do a dir0 and look at drive1's
motor.

A note from the incautious side- I added a TEAC 55B to my FD-501 about three
years ago.
 No problems yet, although it needed a new connector crimped on, since the
TEAC's slot was on the wrong side and Tandys ribbon
 couldn't reach. Don't know if they changed the power supply, but it
 couldn't get much cheaper. Good luck with the upgrade:-)

I have a weird question. I have an old CoCo1 (F-board) and it runs fine except
with a disk controller. Rom paks work and basic works fine but plugging in a
known good controller causes it to show garbage on the screen and gives the
appearance that the controller is zapped! but taking the controller and
plugging it into another machine it works fine.

Any idea which chip in the CoCo could be bad? (has to be the machine) I can't
locate my old service manuals for the CoCo1.

The controllers used for the test was a FD502 controller, Sardis, and a hard
drive specilist. none work in the CoCo1 but all work in other machines just
fine.

Sounds like there's something fried in the 6883 SAM chip, Mike.  It's the
interface between the 6809 and the Disk controller... and some of the ports are
used only for the disk timing, which wouldn't be used on a ROMPack.

Well, as I said, changing colors shouldn't cause an error #203 in menuedit. At
this point I would suggest making sure the modules are merged as described in
the docs, and of course make sure the execution biits are set. You might also
check and make sure the path nam is correct in option 1 of Rconfig. The path to
the menus should be a path to a directory. I would hate to tell you to start
from scratch, but even I had to do this a time or two. But after I got the
first version of RiBBS running, I had no problems installing the late version.
So go back and check your work, and let me know the results in detail. I do
check in here about once a week, so feel free to ask for help, since there
doesn't seem to be a node that carries the RiBBS echo in your area. There are a
few a state away, however. If you should be a member of Delphi, there are some
RiBBS sysops that get together there on Saturday Evenings. Warren Hrach also
puts together a RiBBS to Go package, with RiBBS already set up ready to run on
about 5 floppies. You can contact him at his BBS, Ocean Beach (1-619-224-4878

Rick - sorry for delay in response.  Yes, you'd just poke the slot switch,
but in order to stay out of each other's way, driver programmers adopted a
plan back in early 1988 for this.  Here's an old copy:


                    Driver Coordination Specs
                    =========================

1. Drivers that change the SCS slot should set D.DMAReq so that the floppy
   driver will know to hold off motor shutdown. Custom floppy controllers
   may not have to do this, but other drivers should if the production 
   CC3Disk and it's clones might be used in a system.

2. A floppy driver may assume at all times (except in its IRQ entry if used)
   that the MPI slot has been reset to the floppy controller. Again,
   this is for backward compatibility with CC3Disk.

3. Therefore, any driver that changes SCS in normal operation should:

    set D.DMAReq
    save the old slot
    set new slot
    do cmd setup code
    reset old slot
    clear D.DMAReq

3b. If you F$Sleep, reset the slot to the floppy first of course.

4. IRQ routines should:

    save the old slot
    set new slot
    do irq code
    reset old slot

5. Interrupt-driven devices that rely on GIME CART irq's should toggle the
   enable bit to allow use of multiple irq-driven devices either on the
   same main irq slot, or with MPI's that have all CARTs tied together.
   Example code in your interrupt routine (in addition to #4 above):

    ....            clear source device interrupt
    ldb <D.IRQS     let Clock know
    andb #^$01        you've handled the
    stb <D.IRQS       CART interrupt
    lda <D.IRQENR   get enable byte
    tfr a,b     
    anda #^$01      drop CART bit
    sta >$FF92      clear enable
    stb >$FF92      reset enable

6. If you don't use or set the CTS (slot for interrupt), be sure to use
   a mask algorithm to leave it as-is when you switch slots, so that
   interrupts from another device (like the RS232 pak) may get through
   while your code is running normally.

Rick - seems to me that some MPIs sat a little higher than the coco-3, and that
causes some problems.   Yeah, I hate it when I jiggle the MPI by accident,
also!  Perhaps you could buy/make one of those MPI holder thingies: it's a
plastic piece that fits under both and holds them together.

Altho actually, about once a month I *have* to wiggle the MPI to "clean" up the
connectors a bit ;-)

Hi Rick,

Lessee the quickest way to scan for my files would be to use the following
command while in any particular LIBrary:

   BRO *.*[76476,464]

Just like that.  That'll show you everything I've uploaded with my CIS ID.

The articles are spread around in different libraries since they cover
different topics, some CoCo-specific, some generic.  I have some files in LIB 2
Tutorial, LIB 4 MIDI, LIB 7 Telecom, LIB 9 Utilities, and of course LIB 10
OS9/CoCo.

I've uploaded these same files to Delphi (and GEnie I *think*) so it might be
cheaper to call those places and get these files if you'd rather.  (I *wish*
the OS9 Users Group would consider "moving" to a cheaper place to "live".)

Lemme know what ya think!  -- Thx, Paul Seniura (76476,464).

Kev,

I dl'd LOGIN2.PAT from lib 10 as you suggested. The only problem is that the
patch is in the DEBUG format. I don't have DEBUG, but I do have MODPATCH of
course, AND also dEd from these libraries. With dEd I can change any value in
any module.

Can you tell me how I read the DEBUG commands and how I can apply them to
either MODPATCH or dEd???

I understand that for example   =49 means to change the value to 49, but I'm
confused about things like   . .+52  what does that mean? I'm just NOT familiar
with DEBUG!

Bob,

I think under debug, a ". .+$xx" means to go forward xx bytes from the last set
position.  Which in the case of Pete's file, is always from the last "l" for
"link" command.  Each "=" after that goes forward one address.

So, say one section has:

 l modulename
 . .+45
 = dd
 = ff

You would translate that under Modpatch to be:

 l modulename (unless already done)
 c 0045 00 dd
 c 0046 00 ff

Actually, I don't know if modpatch will do those changes if the old byte
doesn't match.  Hmm.  So you might need to dump or ded the module and see what
the old bytes at those offsets were first (oops.. you said you had dEd, so no
problem... just go to that offset(s) and change them!).

Bob -

The syntax '. .+52' translates literally to:

 Set the current location pointer to the value of the current location pointer
+52.

Keeping a list of what the offsets translate to, you could probably:

    1) Use dEd to modify it (use a copy!)

    2) Write a quick C or B09 program to layer in those
       changes at the appropriate file offsets.

Pete

P.S. Or you could get someone with DEBUG to make the changes for you.

Pete,

I still have a couple of problems. First, the first changes you make are right
in the message that LOGIN prints- "Password?"  Somehow I don't think that is
what you intended. Secondly, the last change is at
 .+49B , that is a problem because the LOGIN file I have is only 3E8 long.
Third, you  l login  quite a few times. If the next offset is  . .+71 is that
+71 from the last change or +71 from the beginning?

I have a feeling that something is drastically wrong here. Any guidance would
be gratefully appreciated!!!

Sounds as if you have a different login than the one the patch applies to. I
don't recall, but it probably applies to LI V 2.00's Login.

The purpose of performing multiple 'l login's is to reset the current position
pointer to the beginning of the module so I can deal with absolute offsets
(rather than having to compute the difference between two offsets).

OK Pete,

That is what I was afraid of. So  if my login was the same one that your patch
was for, then I would be able to use dEd and use the
 .+xx as offsets from the beginning of the module. That's what I thought in the
beginning. What confused me was the last change
 .+49b  MY login is only 3e8 long !!  MUST be the wrong one.

Any idea where I could get one that works? I tried a couple of the replacements
here on OS-9 libraries...NONE of them worked at all.

If only I knew someone with a Dev Pak  <grin>!!

Do you have a LII box? Have you considered MTSMON? It's a multiple TSMON/LOGIN
that won't create a new process for every tty line and therefore conserves
precious system space (i.e. no allocation of 512 byte process descriptors for
each). It's more complex than using Tsmon/Login, and you may have to make some
system chnages (password file format, add a few files). Bill Dickhaus took the
generic LII version and COCOfied it. You may wanto to give him a jingle.

Another thought is with LII's being sold off cheaply ($10) these days, perhaps
the DEV KIT is being sold off as well?

In the meantime, try to find a copy of the original TSMON for LI v 2.00.

Pete,

I thought of getting a DEV KIT cheaply, also. However, finding one is like
"hens' teeth" as the saying goes, virtually impossible to find. The TSMON/Login
I have was from a Level One V. 1.01.00, probably why the file is different?

If you're sure that your patch works on the Level One V. 2.00.00, I'll stop by
a RS this weekend and pick one up for $9.95, it would seem to be the easiest
way - IF you're sure it'll work :-)

Thanx a lot!

~ I've got a slightly dog-eared copy of the Level I, version 2.00.00 upgrade
package that you can have for $5.00 plus postage.  It consists of a 1/4" thick,
(or so), manual, which explains the "new" commands which it contained, along
with 1 or 2 disks.  Leave an address in email if you're interested.

I didn't see the start of the thread, so I'm not sure why you're looking for
2.00.00.  This upgrade package does require that you already have OS9 Level I
and it's docs.

Could you check that 1/4" manual and see if the upgrade affected the LOGIN
command? If so, how was it changed? That is why I'm looking for V 2.00.00,
because a patch on these libraries will suppoesedly patch it to work with OS-9

I've used most, if not all, of the TSMON replacements (at least for testing)
that are in the DLs here.  As I recall, some of them use different names for
the "password" file than does the stock version.  Also, when you invoke TSMON
(any version that allegedly works), you usually have to be pointing to the ROOT
directory, so that TSMON (LOGIN actually) can get access to the SYS directory,
where the "password" files.
  Also, concerning the "password" file, even if the replacement TSMON/LOGIN
programs use the same name, often the format of the entries within the
"password" files vary from program to program.

You can start TSMON from any directory as long as (for LOGIN) you have a SYS
directory nested in whatever directory you're using as the current data
directory when you initiate TSMON /Tx&.

Disregard the last message, I figured out how it works. But we're looking at it

is NOT my problem, LOGIN is!

I need a version of LOGIN that works with Level Two. TSMON, password motd, all
work FINE!

I don't know, I'm about ready to give up on this. If only I knew someone with a

I downloaded that LOGIN.AR package and naturally, it doesn't work. I can't get
past the password. It won't recognize my password file (from stock TSMON/LOGIN)
nor will it create it's own (using the adduser utility in the package). I do
have all the appropriate execute attributes set, so that's not the problem.

Can you give me an example of how the password (/dd/sys/password) file SHOULD
be set up? Maybe that will help me out. Of course, the docs are not the
clearest in the world so maybe you could give me a quick lesson on the entire
system set up (ONLY what is required to use LOGIN)!!

Marks password file is in stock Microware format. Fielded data, delimited by
commas, starting with User Name, password, ID#, priorty, execution directory,
user directory and program to fork.

The only 'gotcha' is the password field is encrypted, so stuff that with six
zeros for starters. You can always use the password command later to reassign
properly encrypted passwords later.

Make sure public read is set and you should be fine.

Let me know ...

I would have thought LOGIN would have created the necessary files it needed
_if_ they didn't exisit. But no matter ...

In  /dd/log each user has a .login file that contains the following info:

 DATE TIME    in the following format
 Tue May 14 08:45:44 1991

file name is in the format of username.login (e.g. steve.login)

It is from this file the system can report your last login date.

Keep us posted. This version is far better than any stock LOGIN that is
floating about.

Thank You Steve,

I was finally able to get it working using the info you gave me. It appears
that the ADDUSER.BIN file in that package doesn't work and that should have
created these files. But once I did it "manually" it worked. One problem still
remains however. When I do a - tsmon /t2&
 and someone logs on the system. When they get the username, password and OS9
prompts, they also get a period, like this:    OS9:. Then he must delete that
period and type the command (or password, etc.) or there will be an error. When
I try it on /term or a different window ( tsmon /w7&, for example) everything
displays perfectly.

What do you think is causing it to send out a period across the modem after
each prompt??

If that can be fixed, then it will work perfectly!
 Your assistance is appreciated muchly :-)

~ Hugo,
  Since the RS-232 Pak is in slot 1, and if the floppy controller is in slot 4,
then you may want to stick with the standard $03 slot select code in the SACIA
driver.
  Unless you want to use the B&B autoboot code, and I'm really not too sure how
that works.  I suppose if you have the MPI's external slot select switch set to
slot 3, then the $02 MPI slot select code would be what you want in the SACIA
driver.  Since all this happens after OS-9 boots up I really don't know how
much difference it makes.  I guess what I'm saying is, experiment, and please
let me know what works!  <grin>

Bruce,

The way I have things currently, I boot directly with the hard disk using B&B's
XT-ROM.  The MPI slot switch is set for slot 3 and the B&B interface is located
in slot 3.  The floppy controller is in slot 4, but I don't power up the
floppies unless I'm doing some file moves.

To tell you the truth, I don't see much difference using $03 or $02 at offset
$0014.  I just figured I'd ask you for the correct numbers just to have things
j-u-s-t right.

Also by the way, I have strapped together the pin 8's of slots 1 and 3
(locations of rs232 and B&B, respectively).

The reason I'm asking all this is that I'm running Mark's UUCP, but the system
hasn't been 100% bulletproof as sometimes I get missed characters, and such. 
The strange thing is, it ONLY happens with UUCP, I have NEVER experienced lost
characters with OSTerm, Sterm, or any other com package.  I figured by setting
things up per spec, I might solve the problem.

~ Hugo,
  Since you only occasionally miss characters when using UUCP, I'd think that
UUCP was probably just a touch slower with Rx than any of the other programs
you mention.  Perhaps adding one more page to the Rx buffer is worthwhile, just
to handle the occasional UUCP buffer overflow?  It should just be an Rx buffer
overflow, unless UUCP masks IRQs a lot, which I'm sure Mark wouldn't do.

I guess UUCP might be slower on the Rx than Sterm, I hadn't thought of that.
Hey while we're on the subject of Rx/Tx, could you explain the difference
between hardware and software flow control?  Is one better than the other?  I
was thinking that maybe I should enable some sort of flow control....

Hugo,
  The difference between hardware and software flow control is usually the
difference between the flow control being part of the data stream (on the Rx
and Tx lines) or being on separate lines.  The distinctions beyond that tend to
get blurred.  Basically, if I say software flow control I mean that one end
transmits a character (usually XOFF, or ^S) to tell the other end to stop
transmitting, and then transmits a different character (usually XON, or ^Q) to
tell the other end it is OK to transmit again.
  Hardware handshake (to me) usually refers to any of the other RS-232 control
lines, such as DSR/DTR or CTS/RTS handshaking.  Depending on the serial chip
(or hardware) used, these "hardware" handshakes may be partially or totally
under software control.
  Does that make any sense to you?  I'm not sure it makes sense to me...
    Bruce

Not totally clear on that.  Is hardware control from modem-to-modem or
computer-to-modem?  I'm still having difficulties with UUCP so I'll try
anything that will stop these annoying problems.

It's amazing, my coco dislikes communications, but only sometimes. First your
tsutils didn't work, now uucp works great for several days, then it completely
fails every time, etc etc..

~ Hugo,
  Hardware and software handshaking may be computer to computer, computer to
modem, or whatever.  I think of it more in terms of Tx/Rx data (software)
handshake or separate pairs (CTS/RTS, DSR/DTR) of lines that are dedicated to
(hardware) handshaking.

~ Hugo,
  Hardware and/or software flow control have nothing to do with the difference
between computer to computer and computer to modem connections.  Either method
of flow control may (or may not) be used with either type of connection.  The
difference (to my way of thinking) is whether or not the flow control is
transmitted with the data stream.
  That is, if the flow control consists of special characters that both ends
agree on to tell each other when to send and when to not send (typically XON
and XOFF characters) then I consider that to be software flow control.  If the
flow control consists of control/status lines that are not the Tx/Rx lines,
then I consider that to be hardware flow control.

I just recently installed a diode irq hack.  Therefore, I figured your
"special" clock module would be redundant.  I'm now using the standard
Microware clock.60hz.

Unfortunately, the diode hack didn't solve my uucp problems as the same thing
happened today ( I assume lost characters and/or bad data in some way).

By the way, I'm using SACIA.mpi, slots 1 and 3 of the mpak have their pin-8's
strapped.  The rs232 pak is in slot 1 and the B&B controller is in slot 3.

My final final attempt to solve the uucp problems will be to replace the 6551
chip with a 6551A.  If that doesn't work, I guess uucp will have to wait until
I get a new 68000 machine.

Hugo,

Let me toss in my two cents:

With every report of interupt type problems, the unit had the _diode_ hack in
place. The success of the diode hack seems to be in direct relation to where
the diodes were purchased. Seems the Shack has a batch of bad diodes.

Rather than rip that out, the easy solution would be to use the new Clock
routine that handles interupts correctly. There should be no reason why they
can't co-exisist.

Is there a way to check if a diode is bad (with a VOM?)

(I'm beginning to think my problem may be software related)

My problem is, Osterm and STERM work fine with my current setup. UUCP works
error free, maybe 40% of the time.  My system seems to be the only one
suffering these problems.

Shades of my high school Basic Electronic class have surfaced with someting
about testing diodes with a VOM. Perhaps continuity in one dirrction only
indicates a properly functioning diode.

Gee, I didn't even get that information when I was in High School 30 years ago.
I had to wait until engineering courses in college for diodes and tubes. 
Transistors I found out about later.  Its a good thing that I had trouble with
electronics, so I went into some other engineering field, like aerospace.  Now
you can't do aerospace without electronics.  Darn.

But then again Robert .... I had this 'unnatural' interest in electronics. I
was always trying to wire something together. I recall a situation in 3rd grade
where I (with the help of my teacher) took an AC power supply, rectified it and
hooked up a couple of telephones set. The class was impressed that they could
actually speak over the phones ... impressed, that is, until the day I crossed
a couple of wires, and smoked the insulation off the wires, filling the room
with a wonderful aroma!

Fortunately for me, this did not end my tinkering career. Mr. Schmidt saw it as
an experience and showed me the error in my thinking...

~ Hugo,
  No, just because you're installed the "diode" IRQ hack doesn't make "my"
clock module redundant.  As I said before, the SACIA driver has had some
recheck IRQ service code removed, and this recheck code was placed in "my"
Clock module.  The reason for this was to eliminate the need for every IRQ
driven driver to do the IRQ recheck, thus saving valuable system space.  If you
use "my" clock module with SACIA it will be much more dependable.  If you use
another Clock module with SACIA you will most probably lose characters at 2400
baud and above.

I'm aware of Dennis's clock driver, I even used it in the past.

Someone hinted that I should disable the hires mouse and see if
it made a difference. I did, and have had 2 trouble free days.
If it keeps up, I'd say the hires mouse was the problem.

Hi Kevin,
Well if I had a choice of Vegas or Atlantic City for the next fest, then I
would choose Atlantic City. This is a purely prejusticed decision based on
location.
Our company recently held a conference in Vegas. An interesting observation was
that the room rates at non-gaming hotels were double gaming ones. We had to
choose a non-gaming one so that our client companies would approve sending
people to the conference. I assume the fest is not under such restrictions.

~ Yeah, I know!  The whole reason the rooms are cheaper at 'Gaming' hotels is
exactly that.   Gaming supports the hotels.  The Non-Gaming resorts can't pay
the overhead if they try to compete with Gaming resort room rates.  And you
should see the rates for those that 'play'!!!   Dirt cheap!  'Cause they know
you'll more than pay for the room at the tables.

Atlantic City?  I didn't even know they had Hotels!  <Grin>  Besides gambling,
what is there to do in AC?  Oh, that's right, Drive to New York, right?  <hehe>

Vegas would be the perfect City for a West Coast Fest.  'Cause it's durn cheap
to get here from anywhere, and with $4.95 prime rib and $6.95 steak and
lobster, plus tons of $25 to $50 rooms, How can you go wrong?

You won't find AC like Vegas.  Anyone been there lately?  I'm curious about AC
pricing. <g>

I'm sure folks can get a great deal on airfare from they're local travel
agents.  Only problem with Vegas, is there is no large CoCo user base here, But
we do have "Multi-Tasking for non-Rocket scientists"' Bill Vergona! <snicker>

BTW, Comdex is in Atlanta in the spring, and Las Vegas in the fall!  We could
schedule an LVFest right before or after COMDEX so CoCo folks could go to both
in one trip.  Hey!  and we could all go to a Runnin' Rebel game!  Great timing,
no?  'Cause you won't see 'em on TV this year.  <Groan>

Yes, the StG Login package (now named 'StGNet') is available from Animajik
(818)761-4135.  I believe it is priced under $50 for the current version 3.0. I
would suggest getting that version now - the new version 4.0 is about done and
will support OSK machines as well - all owners of V3 will get V4 for free.

If you have not received issue #4 of the OSKer by now, then there is a problem
with your subscription.  If so, give me a call at (317) 241-6401.

I am just starting to get into "C". I had downloaded Carl Kreiders's C Library
and Mike Sweet's CGFX ver. 7. Do I replace the stock Tandy C stuff with these,
or do I merge them, and if so, please tell me how. I am still at the learning
point, so an Idiot's guide to C is probably what I should see,  see what is I
need to see for C. (I should be shot for that one.) --Thank you, Br. Jeremy,

Brother,
    Carl's library DOES replace the current ones that came with the C Compiler.
What I did, was make a backup of the original...delete Tandy's version and then
pile Carl's libs in there. The CGFX library is an ADDITION (unless you have the
Developer's Kit...then it would replace that version of the same type LIB).
    In either case....you'll make calls that the LIBs call for....and you'll
utilize the LIBs when you go the LINK them in.

Br. J -

You replace the Tandy/Microware clib.l with Carl's. Also, replace the T/MW
cstart.r file as well. These will be in your ??/LIB directory.

Next - run (don't walk) out and purchase a copy of the Waite Group's " "C
Primer Plus". An absolutely fabulous book that is well written without being
haughty or aloof, is loaded with examples to reinforce the text, and is
sprinkled with humour to make the initial exposure to C bearable. After buying
6 or so other texts, it parted the clouds for me. Others have also raved about
it, and I found out the local University uses it as their C text (of course,
_they're_ Lutherans.. <g>).

Pete

P.S. It's worth the trauma. All of our previously 'assembler only' hacks who
learned C never went back. Figure on about 30 days before the lightbulb gets to
full wattage.

P.P.S. A quick edit/compile/debug cycle is best for learning. Keeping as many
of the compiler modules in memory, and using a RAMDISK or hard disk is optimal.
We also have a replacement 'cc' command that helps facilitate this.

I am also using a bunch of new fonts -- I don't know if they were modified in

apparently left them on my MM/1 at the fest.

Use the new fonts as you would on the Color COmputer 3 -- merge one then use
display 1b3a followed by the group and buffer numbers.

Right now, the font I favor is a sans serif thich font that looks great on the
640 x 420 screens.

Hi Ches,

I've been taking a break.  Plus I've become highly DIScouraged trying to come
up with a converter for SMF-from/to-UME format since Mike K. has been too busy
to reply to any of my messages for more than a month!  (I've checked
"everywhere" today and there's been no sign of him.  He's been busy getting UME
going on the MM/1 I understand.)

Like I've said before, I was reallllllyyyyyy hoping to get something started so
that we can ditch the CMF format altogether.  I can see it's not going to be
very soon at all.  I'm going to have to redo MFF120 to use 'lseek()' because
that's the only way I know to let it process any-size files with no
restrictions -- *and* to keep the utility generic enough for all flavors of
OS9/6809.  That means I don't want to use CoCo3/Level-2-specific "memory
allocation calls", or what Mike and others term "virtual memory".

I've not heard from Chris Braymen either.  Dunno if he'll get our long-int
version of MFF120 to work on his box or not.  Then he also could definitely use
the lseek version.

The lseeks will cause the disk drive to thrash all over the place -- I am
*sure* of this even before rewriting it to do it.  The code must look at every
MFF1 track in succession to find the next-earliest note(s) to
play/convert/merge.  Instead of keeping pointers to the allocated RAM, we'll
have to keep pointers to lseek values.  And every time we reference the byte in
RAM, we'd redo it with a 'getchar()' instead.  See?

But then, that's why we have RAM disks, eh?  I'll see if I can get started on
it this weekend.  Take my mind off the TV reruns anyway ...!

Paul, let me offer a word of encouragement.  Yesterday, I was pressed into
service as a last minute program substitute for a mother/daughter function at
my church.  Your conversion programs helped me WOW the audience with great
music from our favorite little computer.  Again, please accept my thanks for
such a nice addition to the CoCo/OS9 repertoire. (And to any "lurkers", try the
MFFCP.AR conversion program in DL4 - you will like it). Incidentally, I have
been unable to locate PolySoft - not in 800 directory nor in the Portland
telephone operator's list of companies.  Wonder what happened to them. Their
sounds in the demo you uploaded are tremendous.  I recently purchased a 3-song
disk from Music Data (Their "In the Mood" is 65K, sigh), and the comparison
with PolySoft music is interesting.  Music Data uses the standard voices in the
MT32 which are not quite as lifelike as those loaded into the MT32 by PolySoft.
PolySoft's tempo and rhythm are a bit better than Music Data also.  Regards,
Ches.

Well thank you, Ches.  I'm testing the rewrite that uses 'fseek()' to index
through the MFF1 file, instead of loading the file into RAM.  Got one bug out
of the way.  I compared its output to one generated by MFF120, and it matches
100%, so it might be ready pretty soon.  Gotta say it does take about 7 times
longer indexing it from the MFF1 file rather than RAM, even when that MFF1 file
is copied to a RAMdisk.  It'd be great to have a cache driver -- I have
Performance Peripheral's floppy controller and their CC3Disk driver has cache
support settable by the user, but this company is no longer in business.  In
essence this could be used to "load" the MFF1 into the CoCo3's RAM without
having to rewrite this program at all.  Once enough of the MFF1 has been
indexed, the drive would never need to physically reread any of the data.  But
a RAMdisk is still faster since the data is right there in RAM in the first
place.

Some people have uploaded MT32 patch files to the CIS and GEnie MIDI SIGs. If
loaded properly, they can be used with UME.  Haven't tried it, but if UME
simply uses the MIDI channel setups in your MT32 as-is (i.e. the UME file does
not have "instrument" icons in it), your UME file can simply play the notes on
those channels and the MT32 should play with those loaded patches.

Someone around here on this OS9 SIG was trying to create a patch librarian and
patch editor for the MT32 -- where is he?!  I saw Pete Lyall's FB01 software
(or was it for a CZ model?), but where's the MT32 guru?!  I can't remember his
name ... but he uploaded a MT32 Setup program that was working just fine!  It's
here somewhere ... was waiting for his librarian & editor for patches ...

Paul, here's some info for your comparison.  I have a Tandy 1100 laptop PC and
a KEY Midiator.  I used the demo version of Cakewalk 4.0 to get the following
data using the Efficiency Rag from the MIDIFORUM.
   
     Load time for EFCY.MID (Format 1) (file size: 17,920) 2:17
     Load time for EFCY.MID (Format 0) (file size: 19,584) 3:55
   
       (Used MFF120 for conversion of Format 1 to Format 0)
   
     Playing time for loaded Format 1: 2 sec to start of music, 3:25 playing.
   
Comparison data for OS-9:
   
      Conversion time from Format 1 to Format 0: 0:52
      Conversion time from Format 0 to CMF0:     2:13
   
      Playing time for CMF0 (incl. loading time): 5 sec to start, 3:25 playing.
   
   
I have ordered SongWright, a notation type of transcription/MIDI editor/player
for PCs.  Its author says it will load formats 0, 1, and 2, but will save only
in format 1.  My interpretation of the help files with the Cakewalk demo (as a
demo, the save feature is disabled) is that it also saves only in format 1.  I
interpret all of this to mean that Cakewalk (at least) uses format 1 tunes more
efficiently than format 0.  Seems strange, I'd have thought having the time
merging of the tracks already done would make loading of the tune faster.  It
also seems to me that OS-9/MF... is roughly equivalent, and perhaps faster from
start to play than Cakewalk.   Regards, Ches.

On the 'bright' side... If you can get hold of a standard version of dynacalc,
it will run on a coco , and you could use the standard terminal definition

with a cable like the following:

4 Pin DIN Plug                     25 Pin DB25 Male Connector

      1                                     8

      4                                     2

Now, the printer manual states that it needs an "RS-232C" connection.

It says it needs the following:

1 - PG (Protective Ground)
2 - TD (Transmitted Data)
3 - RD (Received Data)
4 - RTS (Request to Send)
6 - DSR (Data Set Ready)
7 - SG (Signal Ground)
11 - SSD (Supervisory Send Data)
20 - DTR (Data Terminal Ready)

Can someone describe how I can possible jumper some of these so that
my CoCo can talk to my laser printer? (not a true laser, but usually
referred to one as)

Or maybe tell me what would be necessary to get this to work?

You should probably make your /dd reflect whichever disk you want it to be.
Normally for a two drive system that would make /dd be the same as /d0 so that
would be 40 track ds.  No you do not need /d2 unless you have three separate
drives.  You can build your own 80 track drive by editing an existing
descriptor to fit (the number of tracks becomes whatever 80 is in hex) and also
setting the track density to 96 per inch.  Read through the system manual.  If
you have trouble I can give you a typical - seems to mee that there was an 80
track descriptor - no I apologize - that came with my SARDIS no halt
controller. One elast thing - after doing an XMODE to change the baud rate you
will need to do a COBBLER to write out the bootfile in its new flavour.  Then
the speed will stay as you have set it. Easy yes? Bob.

HELP ME!!! I have a coco  2 and am using os9 level 1, also using Tandy deskmate
My problem is that I can't get my modem program pak to work with eithor one. I
can't view the service I'm connected to and can't up/down load files to/from
disk. I have tried everything I can find in the manuals but nothing works. does
anyone out there have the answer?

To use the modempak you'll need /m1 in your bootfile. Is it there?

I never found Deskmate to be of much use for me, instead I used xcom9
(available in the Telcom library).

If you'd give us a bit more information on what your system _isn't_ doing, ad
what errors (if any) are being reported, I'm sure we can be of some help.

Fm: PaulSeniura 76476,464

Is anyone working on a new(er) up-to-date GIF viewer for CoCo3 Level 2? About a
year ago, I noticed CIS has put out GIF 1989a specs.  The viewers we currently
have are GIF 1987a and are messing up when trying to show some of these "newer"
GIF files.  For example, Tim Kientzle's View 4.1, as well as Vaughn Cato's
ViewGIF 2.0 and Chris Babcock's O9GIF 2.1 were all saying that they cannot
process a certain (naughty) GIF picture I have, but Mike Dziedzic's GIFOS9 1.1
does try to show it.  View 2.1 was saying how it doesn't support "non-global
bitmaps" in that GIF picture.  CShow for the IBM-PC crowd works just fine (of
course).

I've been tempted to modify viewgif to do 1989a--don't know whether I could do
non-global palettes, but it would be a *great* pleasure to make it know about
aspect ratio, which is one of the changes for 1989a if I recall correctly.  I
think it also wants colors in descending order of importance, which could make
life easier in some ways.

One of the enhancements of GIF 1989a is the use of text on top of the picture,
where the letters or fonts are shown with the background showing through
(transparent) or colored (transclusent[?] or opaque). Yet another enhancement
is that the GIF info specifies the length of a pause or delay for animation,
overlays, the text I just mentioned, or whatever else is needed.  The sample
that came with CSHOW, the IBM-PC compatible GIF viewer, kinda does all of that,
all in one GIF file. It just so happened that some GIF file I found had
contained some non-global stuff which was defined in the original 1987 spec.

Not that I can afford one (anytime soon either), but are the OSK machines from
FHL, IMS, Delmar, etc., able to (or will be able to) show those GIFs that are
essentially VGA pictures?  You know, the 800x600x256 resolution?  IBM has yet
to publish their XGA specs, but the latest CSHOW already supports IBM's own XGA
card.  Keep hearing & reading that the MM/1 and Delmar has support for VGA but
--alas-- where's the software?

Yah, the MM/1 shows the VGA pics, altho in 320x420x256 res instead (looks
fine).  The PT does even better on a VGA monitor with its VGA card, of course.

Far as I know, both have GIF decoders.  Kinda large files to download, tho :-)

Is Mike going to develop it for us po' folk?  If not, and if it's shareable,
might I take a gander at it?  Mike hasn't been answering my e-mail on CIS or
Delphi, seems to be too -- TOO -- busy making things for the MM/1 and
forgetting about "us".  For one thing, he &/or Ed Hathaway promised us they'd
make good the promises stated in the UME-3 docs.  About two months ago, Mike
answered back stating he will get it finished but after he gets them working on
the MM/1 first.  That is IRRITATING -- I and many others have been waiting for
TWO YEARS to the day (almost) waiting for those enhancements.  I'm getting
tired waiting ... I even bribed him & Ed that I'd send in a second $59 once
they get it all finished and implemented correctly.  So, if you have something
we can go ahead and port over, by all means let's get it going.

Sorry 'bout having to bring things out into the open, Mike & Ed, but it's now
beyond my comprehension what y'all are trying to do.  I believe it is time for
others to know why I'm disgusted with UME and its support -- shoot, I don't
even have a copy of the latest version, after what all we've already discussed
and been through over the last two years.  If I knew things were going to be
this way a year ago, I would have tried to develop my own editors.  Nothing's
stopping me, except I *did* pays my money in trust that those features would be
available by now.  I decided instead to get the SMF support rolling, if for no
other reason to show that y'all didn't do enough homework and to show why y'all
need to support SMFs.  I'm presently awaiting a response from Mike to see if he
& I could get together and whip up some UME-SMF converters (both ways, not just
one).  Still waiting ...

I'm not saying UME isn't a good product -- it's the best from what we have to
choose.  But look at how difficult it is to get features supported that we
really need!  I'm through hollering now; thanks for putting up with me.

To the best of my knowledge, the source I have, written for the ST, is freely

I suppose I will duplicate my response here as I've had to respond to others on
Delphi asking the same question.

First of all, as I've mentioned before, Mike Knudsen has been too busy to
answer my questions via e-mail.

Secondly, I've had several specific questions about his documentation of the
UME file format.  When it comes to the part about the "event" arrays and such,
for example, it was poorly written.  Needed some examples to show other
programmers what was expected, maybe even some C code fragments, and so on.  I
believe the last time I asked for some help was in February of this year.
Wanted to know, for one thing, whether MFF1 or MFF0 was the way he expected the
music to be stored.  I couldn't tell with his docs.

Thirdly, the fact that he hasn't made good on "true" MIDI support for certain
MIDI commands, such as pitch bends, controllers, after touch, etc., that we
would have a terrible time figuring out how to convert (or simply throw out)
the data that isn't supported.  As an example, I'm not talking about the "fake"
support for Crescendi & Diminuendi he's apparently put into 4.7.x -- we need
"real" after touch support.  I've suggested ways to graphically show these
kinds of MIDI commands, and even explained how to use simple linear algebraic
equations vs. time to do the real-time MIDI output.

Fourthly, we don't have a decent way to store numerous SysEx data.  If a SMF
has SysEx in it, what will UME "do" about it?  We don't have any way to keep a
library of SysEx, including non-UME software & packages.

Fifthly, what do I do with 24-track SMFs?  Where do I store the instrument
patches in his table if there's more than 16 of 'em?  ETC.

That's just the tip of the iceburg.  All of this was via e-mail on Delphi (and
on CIS e-mail, too, some of it).  Still waiting for some help.  Get the
picture?  -- Thx, Paul Seniura (76476,464).

The "theoretically correct" technique for seeing if a file already exists is
with the access() function. Using perms of 0 just tells you if it is there, or
you can see if it is access()able <g> with whatever permissions you want.

Yes, access() is the correct way to see if a file exists. In the segment I was
working with I really didn't care if the file did or did not exist. I was going
to overwrite it no matter what. Creat() is nice for this since it will
overwrite an existing file. Create() will not. But with creat() you can't set
the file permissions (as we both now know!!), and I did want some special perms
set . . . so that meant I had to use create(); but it fails if the file
exists... so then it is back to combinatation of create() and open(). No big
deal, but it seemed that creat() would have been so simple. Besides, now
everyone knows of yet another ambiguity in the MW manuals.

Steve,

According to the Deskmate manual,the modem pak must be in slot 1 and the drive
controller in slot 4 They are. After setting the communications status settings
I select the view menu. From that menu I select terminal as instructed by the
manual. I now have a blank screen and when I try a call nothing happens.The
screen remains blank. the only thing that will show on the screen is what I
type, if anything. I usually get cutoff long before I can figure what is wrong.
I assume this is because my logon wasn't recieved. If I try the modem pak in
any other slot I get an error, It says that an error occured trying to open the
rs-232 driver,can't open. I don't know what else to try, I called Radio Shack
and they don't have the answer. Can you help?

Again ... the modem pak requires /m1 descriptor and the ACIAPAK driver to
funtion. There should be a menu where you can specify the serial device in use

Hi Paul - rsdos will work with the SC-II driver... unfortunately, pcdos doesn't
(I'd have had to include a halt-driver mode also).  Since people have taken
apart the driver and fixed a coupla bugs in it (the main one only hits if you
boot direct to hard disk... an "iniz /d0" fixes it), I was hoping someone would
do the pcdos dirty work <g>.

Most people just keep two boot disks... and use the old driver boot if/when
they need to do a pcdos xfer.  I think I should just go ahead and post my
driver source code, and let people add the needed halt code.

Yes!  Found a book.  As soon as I can walk again (sunburn) and drive, I'll get
it out to you. thx! - kev

graphics and did color got color by taking advantage of the limited bandwidth
of color TVs--they generated color the same way that you see a faint moire
pattern of red and blue when a used car salesman appears in a black-and-white
herringbone pattern jacket on a commercial.  Your CM-8 is too good to be fooled
like that, and you'll just see a pattern of adjacent black and white stripes. 
To get the colors, you'll have to go to composite or color TV.

Steve, I tried using /M1 on deskmate and got an error It said an error occured
trying to open the rs232 path can't open In the deskmate manual it says to use
/T2 but that only gives a blank screen. I have deskmate version 1.00.00 and it
uses os9 version 2.00.00 How would I go about obtaining and  installing the m1
driver since I don't think it is in there? Also would this work for my os9
version 1.01.00 level 1 ? I just added a second drive to my system and would
like to be able to use the drives with telecomm. I apprieciate your help
Thanks,

Well, it's enough to make a person crazy... it's sad enough that the Atari ST
almost came with OS-9 as its standard operating system, but didn't... but now
we also find out (from this exchange on internet):

   Amiga Owner #1: "Given the grief that many of us suffered under [Amiga OS]
1.0 and 1.1, I wonder if we wouldn't have been better off with C= buying
OS-9/68K, which was reasonably stable, at the time, then adding [graphics]."
   Amiga Owner #2: "I asked about that, at the time. The response I got
indicated that nobody at Amiga had ever heard of Microware.  Weird."
   Commodore Honcho: "Not quite accurate.  In the days when we were looking for
a replacement for the original CAOS  (we had the tripos port in hand, but...) I
talked to the folks at Microware (since I was already talking to them about
another project using an OS9 varient.). At that time their unit pricing even
for large volumes made their operating system uneconomical for us to use. Which
was a shame."

"A shame" indeed!  If both the ST and Amiga had come with OS-9, perhaps we'd
now be reading interviews in TIME magazine with MW President Ken Kaplan,
instead of always just with Bill Gates :-(.   Drat.

? The pricing of MW's OS-9/68K has always been on the exorbitant side.
Especially after they withdrew their "personal" version OS-9.  We, CoCo3
owners, really got it good with the OS-9/6809 for only $80.  Granted, after
Multi-Vue and the Dev. Pak are added the price breaks the $200 mark, but still
you could get a lot done without the add-ons.  And at $230, as I recall, it was
still a good deal compared to the 68K versions.

But you're right, I think MW missed a great opportunity by not catering to the
ST and Amiga market.  Of course, we seem to be only one side of the story based
on the previous internet messages.
   It would be interesting to hear both sides.

if I use /t2 like the book says I get a blank screen. If I try /m1 I get an

used to add modules to a boot file, is this correct? If so , how would I add a

I'm no longer a coco'er, so some of this is a stretch for me memory wise... I'm
not sure where/when the /M1 module was first distributed.

Is there any possibility that it exists in the bootfile on the 2.00.00 disk?
Try this:

   Ident -s    Ident -s /d0/OS9boot

And see what drivers and descriptors are there....

Something else just occurred to me. Because of the inadequate handling of the
IRQ's for devices in the multi-pak, we developed something called an IRQ hack
that tied to the RS232 pak. This allowed it to receive serial interrupts. In
the case of the modem pak, this wasn't necessary because they (Tandy/Microware)
included a _virtual_ IRQ driver (VIRQ) that would issue interrupts every so
often. They'd use this to act as sort of a baby sitting timer for checking the
modem pak. This all boils down to the fact that if you use /M1, you may also
need to unearth VIRQ. I believe that VIRQ wasn't implemented until 2.00.00.

Again - see what's in the 2.00.00 bootfile. In fact, omit the -s option and get
the full poop on all the modules. We're mainly interested in finding M1, it's
driver (the descriptor will list which driver it is affiliated with), and
whether or not you have VIRQ.

Tom,

Since you are using Level I (right?) you should be able to load M1 and MODPAK
without having to build a new bootfile, then if that works, we can help you
through making up a new bootfile. If I remember right (its been awhile, and I'm
at work, so can't look this up) the drivers and descriptors are in a directory
on the master system disk, probably the MODULES directory. Load M1 and MODPAK
from there, using full pathnames (like: LOAD /D0/MODULES/M1). Then try setting
the serial port in Deskmate to M1.

There are a couple of options:

 a) Use 'shell+'. This is a hacked version of the standard shell that
    supports shell variables, parameters, and control statements. Should
    be in DL10. May require LII (Os9 Level II).

 b) The os9 UGLIB (DL5) has a tool called 'go' that accepts parameters,
    and forks command lines with these parameters substituted. If it's not
    online, it can be recalled.

Hi Chris - I assume from the section that you're using OS9/68K.

The current Microware shell doesn't accept command line arguments <sigh>. I
suspect with the coming influx of OS9/68K users, that we'll be seeing a new
shell that does pretty pronto, tho.

In the meantime, drop into Library 12 and do a "bro /key:shell" and see if you
find anything useful.  I believe that there's a Bourne shell in there, for one.

Like you, I find "chd" instead of "cd" is driving me crazy... especially since
the "pwd" of 6809 OS-9 is now "pd" under OS9/68K (OSK for short).

OK.  Whenever you switch floppies in the drive, you need to chd and chx (there
are some possible exceptions, but they are few, and can wait until you have a
better understanding of what's going on).  The reason you need to do this is
that OS-9 disks aren't like Disk BASIC disks.  In Disk BASIC, the directory is
*always* in the same place, has the same size, and so forth.  Under OS-9,
different disks can have their directories (note the plural) in different
places.  (There is some stuff that's always in the same place, but it isn't a
directory, though it tells how to get to a special directory, called the *root*
directory of the disk.)  All a process remembers about the directories, data
and execution, is what drive they're on, and what sector on the drive they
start at, so changing disks will fool the process--in particular, the process
that runs the program "shell" that interprets the commands you type at the
"OS9:" prompt.

Fm: Ernest Withers Jr. 71545,1117
To: All

Can anyone help me with a small problem I'm having with my new modem and CIS? I
bought a Best Data Products SMART ONE 9632X V.32 9600 baud modem that is
currently connected to COM1 on my Tandy 3000 HL. I still have my 2400 baud
modem connected to the CoCo 3 and will move this 9600 to my MM1 when it arrives
 (soon I hope). Now for the problem. The new modem works fine EXCEPT after a
CISB+ file transfer. After the successful transfer I get no response from CIS
and even sending a CTRL-C gets a strange graphics character echoed back to my
screen. After a while, if I stay connected long enough, I get a Host Time Out
message. I don't normally stay connected that long because of the connect
charges. The files ARE successfully received and will unzip on the 3000 or the
OS9 files will un-AR on the CoCo. If I select Xmodem or Ymodem, everything
works great. I get normal responses from CIS after the transfer. This problem
happens when I call either the 2400 baud node or the 9600 baud number. On the
3000 I'm using PCPLUSTD for the term program. I prefer to use B+ transfers for
the speed (approx. 1K per sec.) but will drop back to Ymodem if I have to or
does CIS support Zmodem?

By the way, I asked this question almost two weeks ago in the IBMCOM forum
since the modem is being used with an IBM compatible. I never got a single
reply@and now the msg has scrolled off.

That says something for the attitude and friendliness of the CoCo/OS9 community

Thanks for any help.

Ernie.

Earnie,
    Just a quick reply on your modem problem until I can check out something.
First, the people who wrote PCPLUSTD have their own forum here on CIS.  Just
type GO DATASTORM at any prompt, and post your question over there.  They are
very good at getting problems solved and are quite eager to go the "extra mile"
to make you happy.  They also have some good add-on things in their databases.

Second, it sounds like the CIS computers are waiting for your computer to send
something.  Try the following key-combinations in this order to see if you can
"wake-up" the connection:    <ENTER>, then <CONTROL-Q), then <ESC>.  Try these
on at a time, but if one doesn't work then try the next.

I will go try to down-load a short file using B+ to see how my rig works.  I
don't quite have the same set-up, but I do use PCPLUS version 1.1B.  It has
been a while since I used B+, and I forget if it acts like yours or not.

Don,
     I downloaded the Sept. 1988 version of PCPLUSTD  from the Datastorm Suppor
Forum and that cured my problem with B+ downloads. Everything seems to be
working OK now. Thanks for the help.

Ernie,
     Glad you got it working OK.  As I said before, I am using the commercial
version 1.1B.  If you send in the sofware up-grade, that is what you get.  One
thing to note, that version was often less expensive via a software house (i.e.
Compuadd here) than you could get it from Datastorm!!  This was a fact that
THEY frequently pointed out to people on their Forum, and was a major factor in
me believing in them.  They have a new version 2.0 out now.  From what I have
heard, it is having some "new software" blues (bugs).  I elected not to get it
as version 1.1B is VERY solid and does all I want.

Cheers, -Don Spoon-

Jeremy - perhaps it has some xmodem padding on the end or something... try
loading it, then saving it back out and see if ident comes up okay then.

The descriptor has been set up so that each "cylinder" = 8K of space, so you
can dmode cyl=xx  in hex numbers to whatever you'd like.  For example, 320K
would be 40 "cylinders" of 8K each, so that'd be "dmode /r0 cyl=28".

I think ;-)

Pete, I took out my deskmate disk (os9 version 2.00.00) and exited deskmate.
This puts me in the shell. Now a new problem, every command I type in comes
back error#216. I tried the ident /d0/os9boot on this disk and got the same
error. I also tried it onn my version 1.01.00 os9 system disk the boot file
doesn't contain m1 on  that one. It contains the following: IOMan   RBF  
CCDisk   D0   D1   D2   D3   SCF   CCIO   TERM   RS232   T1   PRINTER   P  
ACIAPAK   T2   PipeMan   Piper   Pipe   Clock SyssGo   Shell Can any of the
drivers in this bootfile be modified and rennamed to M1 or is that a whole
different thing? How can I get into the deskmate disk to find out what is in
the bootfile? I can't get any of the shell commands to work. Is there a
different set of commands  for the 2 different versions?

Thanks

It sounds as if the deskmate disk is distributed with few (if any) of the stock
os9 commands. Not a real problem, though... do this:

   1) On original disk, type LOAD IDENT

   2) Remove original (normal os9) disk, and insert deskmate disk

   3) Type: ident /d0/OS9Boot (optionally output it to a printer if
      you have one ready by: ident /d0/os9boot >/p)

   4) Replace the deskmate disk with the original, and type:

       unlink IDENT

All this sequence does is place the ident command in memory so the system
doesn't have to hit the disk up for it.

I think I see where we're headed with all this, and it looks like two possible
courses of action:

  a) Find a real copy of OS9 2.0.0 so we can build you a kernel with
     M1 and it's device driver (I can't recall if that's ACIAPAK
     or MODEMPAK).

  b) Get an RS232 pak with an external modem connected to it. There
     are several advantages to this approach, but the most obvious
     is that you can go faster than 300 baud, and that you can use the
     serial port for other things as well (with A/B switches, etc.,
     like to use an X10 Powerhouse, or connect directly with another computer
     if you have one).

Let me know how the 'ident' goes.

Steve -

What's the general poop there? Are both /M1 and /M2 both for MODEM PAKs? Is
this to say that /M1 under ACIAPAK's control will manipulate the MODEM PAK, or
does it mean that /M1 is supposed to be a modem connected to the RS232 PAK?

The way I understand it, both /m1 and /m2 are for the modempak. /M2 uses MODPAK
to manipulate the modem pak (and I believe is a virq device) while /m1 relies
on ACIAPAK.

Try chd /d0 and chx /d0/cmds --that should get you further along.  Also, give
serious thought to buying a copy of *Start OS-9*, which will take you through

Pete, I tried ident like you said and outputted it to my printer, Here is what
I got.

IOMan   RBF   CCDisk   D0   D1   SCF   ACIAPAK   T2   PRINTER   P   CCIO   CO32
TERM   Clock  Sysgo   Shell These are all the modules listed onn the printout.
There is no M1, I looked  in the modem pak manual and it says that the M1
driver needs the modem pak in slot 1 because it uses a hardware interrupt. And
the m2 driver must be used in any slot except 1 because it used a polled
software interrupt.

It also says that os9 version 2.00.00 has these drivers. Is it possible that
deskmate has deleted them and the cmds file. If I were to copy the cmds file to
my deskmate  disk I  think it may allow me to use os9 commands. Do you know of
anyone out there  that may have a copy of the proper boot file to make my modem
work?

Thanks for your help

Actually, based on what Steve Wegert has cleared up for me/us, you should
probably be able to make a few simple changes to /T2 to make it an /M1. Or, you
could still call it /T2, but just make the adjustments (patches) to it to make
it functionally an /M1.

Steve - if you have the modules handy, could you generate a CMP output of the
two modules (under 2.0.0)? Hopefully they're the same size.

Tom - once we get the list of changes, you can apply them with debug, and we
can get going.

In the meantime, some tools that may also be useful in this venture are:

 dEd, mverify, bootsplit, lmerge, an/or Patch.

If you don't have them yet, do you have a way to download them from DL9 or DL10
and get them onto OS9 disks?

Pete, I can't download a file and put it onto a disk unless the program has
line numbers. I have to download to the cassette buffer, save on tape, switch
to disk basic, load  the program into memory,and copy to disk. If it is an os9
type program or file, they usually don't contain line numbers and I can't
reload them under disk basic. I have to use the modem under extended basic
without the os9 system working right now so if these are not too long I could
take the file and output it to the printer and then type it in to os9 manually.

Otherwise I don't know how we could do it. Let me know when you and Steve get
the changes I need worked out then I can get this thing to work. Thanks for all
your help.

I was somewhat afraid of that. In that case, we may have to:

a) Get the poop from Steve (or others)

b) Have you use debug to make changes to T2

c) Use SAVE to put a copy on disk with an updated revision number

d) Use VERIFY to get a proper CRC

e) Load the updated & revised version (after decrementing the in RAM copy's
revision number)

f) Do a COBBLER to generate a new boot.

Let's see what shakes with Steve.

Hello, Ale!   Your English is fine.

Hopefully, someone more into databases will know of something which can help
you out.

I'm very interested in hearing more about your CD-I project... can you tell us
any details?

thanks.. and I hope someone can help you.  regards - Kevin

Hello Kevin !!!
Thank's for the reply.
Well....it's a long story about our project on Cd-I, so I'll tell you only
about our needs of B-Trieve.
In Italy we develop and produce software for Cd-Rom( products like
Enciclopedias, about Cooking, our last Cd-rom contain 1500 recipies with
images, Medical Cd-rom for the family also with images ......).
Now we would like to "import" some of these products on Cd-I and Commodore's
CDTV.We woluld like to do this as soon as possible, our information retrieval,
which we actually use for Cd-rom, is based on B-trieve, we would like to use it
also with Cd-I and the problem is that in Italy nobody knows about something
like B-trieve that works also on Cd-I.

Looking forward of hearing news from You....
Regards from Ale.

Your Btreive on a CD-Rom project is actually very similar to something I'm
working on myself (indexed storage and retrieval on Worm & MO's).  I would be
happy to port B-treive to OS9 FOC (free of charge), but I don't have the code
or better yet just tech spec's on the B-treve format.  I do have access to CD
players though, so I can test it out if somebody could get me the code or
specs...

Pete, I have been playing around with both the Deskmate and os9 disks. The
deskmate disk cmds file does not contain most of the os9 commands. I have used
copy to add some of them to it and had success in doing so. It does however
list a bunch of commands in the directory that all start with dm (deskmate). I
don't know if these will be of any help but here is a list of what the cmds
directory contains without the ones I have added. STARTUP   Desk   DMmenu  
DMapps   DMcaln   DMcards   DMledger   DMpaint   DMterm   DMTEXT   DMalt  
DMdrv   DMprn   DMcal   DMtim   DMdsp DMopt   DMhelp   DMdskini   DMbackup  
format   DMmenu.hlp   DMcaln.hlp

DMcards.hlp   DMledger.hlp   DMpaint.hlp   DMterm.hlp   DMtext.hlp   DMalt.hlp

I so far have added : DIR   rename   MDIR   COPY   COBBLER   DELDIR   OS9GEN  
XMODE   BUILD. I don't know if any of this will help but I thaught I would fill
you in anyway. Thanks again for your help

Try booting that kernel, DON'T iniz T2. Then use debug (from another disk if
you need it) to apply those changes to an in memory copy of the T2 descriptor.
THEN INIZ T2 (or M1, if you apply the rename).

Now try it out with your modem pak & deskmate. If it works, just use cobbler to
throw a copy of this kernel on a new os9 disk and your done.

I'll be away for about a week, so perhaps Steve Wegert can help you from here
on in. Good luck! Sounds like you're 97.5 % of the way there.

Hi. I just received UltiMuse3 from 2nd City yesterday. I have already entered
my first score (O Sacred Head - a small hymn by J.S. Bach and others), which
should say something about its ease of use.
 I could not get it to read a file from within umuse3. I could enter the
filename as a command line argument, but if I attempted to read a file (from
the files menu), I got something very close to "DirRead: cannot malloc enuf"
and a "Press enter or click to continue" prompt. I have tons of free,
contiguous ram (performing mfree from the sub-shell in umuse3 gave over 200k)
as I have no windows or other shells running. I have tried forking it with "ex
umuse3", but the extra 8 or 16k didn't make a difference.
 Am I doing something wrong?
 BTW - I really, really like it!!

Let's see...could you perhaps have more stuff in the address space umuse3 is
running in than should be there?  Did you give an explicit memory allocation on
the command line?  (I think that one shouldn't.)

Thanks for the ideas. No, I didn't do "umuse3 #32k" - the manual explicitly

I believe that Umuse works better without Shell+'s automatic allocation of 8K

Mark, hang on for a response from Mike or call Ed at 2nd City.  That malloc
problem is a C language problem that has come up before (for me and others) but
I can't remember the fix.  It has to do with 8k sections of memory and how they
are used rather than gross memory availability.  You may learn something
helpful from the documentation that came with the software, but I suspect Mike
thought he'd killed the problem and doesn't mention it in the documentation. 
Great program, UltiMusE!  Ches.

OK everyone, I have a problem and I'd like to fix it. I am currently

reliably for me.

Details:

1. My system is set up to RECEIVE calls from another Coco running 
   UUCP 2 towns over.  The other guy is also using Mark's software and
   he in fact provides a mail feed to another coco user as well.  They DO
   NOT experience any problems whatsoever.
2. My machine autoboots using the XT-ROM. GSHELL is started
   and is the only window open.
3. I have the following hardware/software:
   - 512K coco
   - Upgraded 26-3124 Multipak with pin-8's on slots 1 and 3 strapped.
   - Deluxe Rs232 Pak in slot 1
   - B&B RTC in slot 3
   - Diode IRQ hack between R2 and R7 (installed correctly)

Fm: Hugo Bueno 71211,3662
To: All

The actual problem, which occurs about 90% of the time, is that my Coco
gets "stuck" when receiving data.  That is, a transfer starts, a couple of
packets get through, then my machine doesn't acknowledge.  I can make the
transfer start again by opening a window and typing DIR (sometimes more
than just once is required), or even pressing ENTER a couple of times.
Is anyone out there aware of anything that would cause this despite the
use of all the latest software and hardware upgrades??

Here is an XMODE of my T2 descriptor:

 nam=T2 mgr=SCF ddr=SACIA hpn=07 hpa=FF68 upc=00 bso=01
 dlo=00 eko=00 alf=01 nul=00 pau=00 pag=00 bsp=08 del=18

 ovf=07 par=0C bau=04 xon=11 xof=13 col=50 row=18 xtp=05
 wnd=05 val= sty= cpx= cpy= fgc= bgc= bdc=

The kicker is that the Coco sending me the mail is pretty much
the same hardwarewise and softwarewise, except he uses GRFINT
instead of WINDINT.

Tom,

Bear with me as it's been a long time since I've used debug. I tend to
perfer dEd under Level II.

First, make sure you're booted up, have a copy of debug either in memory
or on a disk that your execution directory can find. Next, make sure
t2 is in memory (MDIR will confirm this).

I suggest you review page 161 and 162 in the orange Program Development 
guide that came with your level I OS9. Pay close attention to the 
section named 'Patching Programs'


Type DEBUG <enter>

1)  At the DB: prompt, type  L t2 <enter>          * this starts us off
2)  expect an address and a value to be displayed. Make note of the address.
3)  At thhe DB: prompt, type . .+10 <enter>        * that's . <space> .
                                                   * and move us 10 bytes in
4)  your starting address will be incremented by 10 and it's current
    contents will be displayed. In this case, it should be 68.

5)  At the DB: prompt, type =6c <enter>            * change 68 to 6C
6)  At the DB: prompt, type L t2 <enter>           * get a common ref. point
7)  At the DB: prompt, type . .+27 <enter>         * don't forget the space
8)  At the DB: prompt, type =01  <enter>           * if already 1, skip it
9)  At the DB: prompt, type L t2 <enter>           * rewind counter again
10) At the DB: prompt, type . . 2E <enter>         * you get the picture
11) At the DB: prompt, type =4d <enter>
12) At the DB: prompt, type =b1 <enter>
13) At the DB: prompt, type $SAVE temp m1          * save a copy of m1 as temp
14) At the DB: prompt, type $VERIFY u <temp >m1    * set the CRC and rename
                                                   * temp to m1
15) At the DB: prompt, type $ATTR m1 e pe          * set the attributes
16) At the DB: prompt, type $DEL temp              * clean up
17) At the DB: prompt, type q                      * I'm outta here!

At this point you have a modified t2 (now called m1) in memory. Fire up
Deskmate, choose m1 as your device and see if things won't work better.
If they do, use cobbler to make a new boot of the image you have in memory.

Let us know what happens.

I'm having a little trouble with DeskMate 3. I know thhis isn't the greatest
program around, but for $4.95 it could be handy in a side window. (WWith
DM,Basic09##32k, and a shell theres 200k left!) I was able to Config VDDG and
WIND together, then XMode'd printer baud,modpatched step rates, set montype and
Hi-Res mouse (using SRB's setype from CoCo Artist disk),and cobbled the whole
 meess. The only thing that hheld wass the stepping rate. DM uses the printer
at 2400baud, but none of the windowss do unless I XMode again. Also DeskMate
comes up in montype c and can't use thhe Hi-Res mouse at all(cursor wraps about
2 1/2 times). Even when I reset all of the above in startup, as soon ass I fork
DeskMate, it all goes away again!
 Can anybody help me do any of the following:
          a. Get XMode to hold or
          b. extend StartUp past the DeskMate command
          c. get DM to boot in RGB
          d. scaale the moouse for Hi=res
 Note: I've got DeskMate on a Apps disk in /d1 (My only double sided)). Is this
 messing up CONFIG.DESK?

I'm noticeing thhat third party programs usuaally work better than Tandy's own,
ie Lvl1 DynaCalc from 1985 runs in an 80 col window no sweat. Mebbe if Tandy'd
demanded thhhis kind of flexability in their own sooftware, thhhe CoCo wouldn't
be dead!

Fm: Paul Rinear 73757,1413

   Help!
           I bought one of those Marty Goodman RS-232 kits; the one
      that uses a modified Modpak. I wired the thing up; that
      wasn't too hard. I wired it to use addresses $FF6C thru $FF6F
      since I already have a Disto RS-232 pak hooked up. Both paks
      are installed in a multipak which has all the interrupts
      wired together. The diode hack that connects the interrupt
      line to the CPU is also installed. These hacks have been
      working fine for awhile now.
           So.... I thought that to address this new port all I had
      to do was make a new boot disk with a /t3 device descriptor on it
      that had its physical address modpatched to $FF6C.
      Apparently not: I get a 'module not found' error when I try
      to access it.
           If I just boot up with my old boot disk that only has
      /t2 on it, I can modpatch /t2 in memory and write to the pak
      at $FF6C. It works with a printer somewhat. By somewhat I mean
      that I don't really want to use it with the printer cause when
      I first turn my system on the printer sends a signal to this
      pak which it can't handle. The system locks; a reset fixes it
      however, and I can then boot OS9.
           So.... I tried this pak with my modem. In the instructions
      it says to set the modem to always produce a positive CD signal.
      Fine, but both the TXD and RXD lines go high and stay high if I
      do that.
           I think there is more wrong here than just a software
      problem, but my only question is about the software. How do
      I set up the boot disk to recognize two RS-232 ports ?

                             Tearing out hair,

Paul - dump your /t3 descriptor... I bet it has "modpak" as the driver in it
instead of "aciapak".  Try taking a copy of t2 and patching it just to change
the name to "t3" and address to FF6C, and that should work.

Thanks Ed. In fact, I finally got through to Tony diStefano and worked it out

to finally have an OS9 terminal program and not have to use RSDOS to keep
transferring the files over all the time. I must say, though, that while STERM
works flawlessly and Quick B is very nice, Ultimaterm was a much more
sophisticated terminal program and I miss my auto log on strings. Even a couple

Recently there have been two bugs found in my 6809 library.  One is in ctime()
- I put it there when I fixed localtime().  The other is in the long division
routine - it is Microware's bug.

I will put up new versions of the libraries, but for those who don't want to
download the whole thing for these two bugs, here are patches.

For the ctime() problem:
 at offset $14c5 is 83 00 01 in both clib.l and clibt.l
 change that to     12 12 12

For the ldiv problem:
 at offset $617d is 6c 01 in clib.l
 or offset $7d02 is 6c 01 in clibt.l
 change that to     63 01

My apologies to all.

Carl
               Going through my disk, I find the values at $617d in clib.l
      and $7d02 in clibt.l to be 6c 61 and not 6c 01 as you stated. Is
      this just a typo ?

Does anyone have a SCSI controller on a COCO3?  What disk interface and driver
do you use?  Is there any advantage over the XT type controller (MFM drive,
DISTO [and B&B?] interface) or whatever controller that LRTech (through
Owlware) uses with its old interfaces (Xebec something not 1410)?  I know that
a SCSI controller/drive would prepare for a bigger machine, but I have MFM
drives, and don't have the money now.

The folks I recall as having SCSI setups for the CoCo are RGB and KenTon.
Advantages?  Well...as you mention, SCSI hardware will move to other hardware
readily.  Also, one can get some pretty respectable SCSI hard drives these
days--back when I got a 30Mbyte RLL drive for my CoCo, I shelled out $300+ for
a 30 Mbyte, 65 ms, 5.25" half-height drive that was rather noisy, and then I
needed to spend $100 for an Adaptec RLL controller.  That was--gee, I guess
maybe three years ago.  Now, for less than the total $$$ on that, I can get a
105 Mbyte, 15 ms, 3.5" drive less than an inch thick, with on-drive cache and
embedded SCSI controller.  Four times as fast, three times the capacity, eats
less power, and costs less $$$.

Next thing--SCSI isn't just for disk drives; there are SCSI tape drives (if one
could just get SBF for OS-9/6809...sigh), SCSI printers, Tony DiStefano's frame
grabber that was demoed at the IMS booth at RAINBOWFest hooked up to the SCSI
bus.  So...if one has the appropriate software, one can use a variety of I/O
hardware with SCSI.

SCSI devices can also be told to go do something among themselves without
bugging the "master" until it's done, but I don't know whether anyone's written
the software needed to set up that kind of I/O.

Fm: PaulSeniura 76476,464
To: all


I just posted a file in LIB 4 called 'MFF10.AR':

A TEST version of MFF10 is archived here in this file.  It has the same syntax
as MFF120 (provided in MFFCP.AR):

    MFF10 [output.mf0] <input.mf1

The output filename will default to 'tmpout.mf0' if not specified.  The input
filename (redirected as shown) is (still) absolutely required at this time.

Use MFF10 in place of MFF120 when the latter issues an error message about the
MFF1 input file being too big and needing too much memory.

..

I have tested MFF10 written with standard C library calls (e.g. 'fseek()',
'fread()', etc.).  The same 90k test file took 18 minutes.  The version
archived here is using the OS9 System calls ('lseek()', 'read()', etc.).  This
is about a 16% time savings when we stay away from C's automatic buffering.

Which brings me to an OS9 technical question that I *do* need answered:  With
the random accessing provided by OS9, say I need to read Byte #287 (decimal)
and then Byte #291 and then maybe Byte #259 (these byte-offsets would be in the
same 256-byte block after the physical I/O gets Byte #287).  In MW C language,
I do a 'lseek(pn,lngpntr,0)' before doing a 'read(pn,&buffer,1)' for each &
every byte.  The 'pn' file is opened read-only so OS9 should not keep track of
locked records etc.  The question is whether OS9 bothers to do further physical
I/Os (past the first one) for the second & third 'lseek/read' -- is OS9 smart
enough to know the 256-byte buffer *already* has the second & third bytes
needed and thus has an "efficiency" or "mini-cache" facility (sort of) built
into the o.s.?  (Please note I'm *not* talking about C's automatic buffering.
I'm asking whether OS9 itself will superfluously perform further physical I/O
when it's not needed in this manner.)

If this isn't true, I'd like to try enhancing the throughput in this manner
before making a final version of MFF10 available to everyone.  It should boost
the "speed" a bit more, and since some of us po' folk can't afford the new
horsepower, would it be worthwhile to include this logic?  Please, if you know,
let me know!

"Is OS-9 smart enough to know that the 256-byte buffer *already* has the second
& third bytes needed... ?"

Yes, RBF notes if an operation can occur within a sector it already has in
memory.  You can check this easily yourself with a simple Basic09 program:

 PROCEDURE Test
 DIM path:INTEGER
 DIM d(64):BYTE
 OPEN #path,"/d2/testfile":READ
 LOOP
 INPUT k$
 GET #path,d
 ENDLOOP

Change the filename to suit.  The program will read 64 bytes each time you hit
the Enter key.  By watching the floppy (or hard disk) light, you can see that
the disk is read only once every 4 times (64*4=256 bytes).  - kev

Hi Kevin,

Thank you for the idea.  I need to stick a SEEK in front of the INPUT to
emulate what we're doing in the MFF10 program -- the logic could actually make
the file's location pointer go backwards but still in the same sector.  If RBF
is doing this "work" for me, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do to enhance the
performance of this program.  Other operating systems might not have RBF's
smarts, but that's *their* problem!  :-)

It's funny how fseek/fread does its buffering like this but it adds enough
extra executed code to introduce a very noticable amount of time to do the same
thing when compared to lseek/read.  Hmm, if Carl Kreider's libs are stable
enough, I could relink all these programs and see how they behave ... hmmm...

Paul, I have a problem with MFPlay (I think).  I used MFF10 to change a .mid
file to a .mff0 file - no problem.  I then used MFPlay.mem to play the file but
it bombed out because the .cmf0 file was too large to load.  I went back to
MFPlay and the file played, but was unacceptable because of the time taken for
disk i/o activity.  I started rammer and then got 'error openning '/midi path'
error.  Apparently there is some kind of conflict between mfplay, my midi
driver, and rammer (/r0).  If I deiniz r0, mfplay works again, but if I iniz
r0, it can't find /midi.  (Similar problem with MTPanel and MIDI editor so the
problem is not likely to be unique with MFPlay).  Any ideas???  Ches. P.S. I
think you asked who the MT32 editor guru was - Jonathan Cluts is his name.  I
sent him a message and urged his continuing with the editor, but his interests
were elsewhere at the time.  chl

Hi Ches,

I really hate to say that I've not been impressed with the Rammer software.  I
ditched it quite some time ago -- actually when Tandy released the Development
package with its own VDisk drivers.  An outside company released a patch not
too long ago to fix a bug with it, and I've not had any problems one little bit
since.  (That patch is around here somewhere, but I can't remember offhand
where or the name of that company.)  The only thing about Tandy's version is
that once you INIZ it, it's ready to go, and it won't allow any Format
operations.  (I just DELDIR the heck outa it!)

Run MDIR when you have INIZ'd /R0 and see if it is clobbering anything.  Both
MFplay versions are openning the /MIDI path the *very* same way -- the only
code that is changed is how we read in the input CMF file, either in small
chunks (set by the length fields) or in one huge chunk (in the MFPlay_mem
version).

I don't know what else it could be.  Even RiBBS v2.0 uses /R0 very effectively
(once I got Ron Bihler to fix a big bug in his message editor!).  And of course
I d/l with STerm and SuperComm to /R0 all the time, capturing messages etc.

Let me know what you find out.  And see if you can install Tandy's version but
do find the fixes for it here somewhere.

I was thinking about your problem some more ... it might be that MDIR will show
everything just fine when you have your Rammer going.  If /MIDI is not openning
while Rammer is being used, I'll bet OS9 cannot grab enough system memory to
build a device-memory buffer for /MIDI.  If you have Kevin Darling's UTIL
programs (they're here on CIS), SMap will show the allocation of system RAM at
the time it is run.  It's got to be something like that -- Rammer is obviously
gobbling the RAM up there.  Does the disk version of MFPlay print an error
other than #001 when this happens? -- Thx, Paul Seniura.

I'll have to dust off Kevin's utilities and take a look.  I have tried the
Tandy RAM and R0 with identical results.  I've tried reducing the amount of
memory used, but I suspect it has to do with block use rather than the more
general memory usage.  To remind you (for what it's worth), the problem began
with the recoding of mfplay to play from memory.  The only error is 001 and
opening is misspelled as openning which might help you to find where it is
being triggered (openning MIDI error or some such similar message).  Related
topic, I've looked all over the MIDI forums for the PolySoft stuff without
success.  Could they only be on Delphi?  Since I don't subscribe there, could
you upload the demo to dl4 here?  Regards, Ches.

Ches, I swear I got the PolySoft file from GEnie's MIDI area myself.  You
almost have to use keyword search there cuz the way they work you could miss
it.  Or look for a filename like 'MT32ST.ARC' or use 'ATARI' for the keyword.
We've been told it's not authorized to be shared in the normal manner.  I also
swear I saw it in the CIS MIDI SIG here, too - I've seen it in both places not
very long ago, but I'll be darned if I can find it now (I just tried tonight).
Could it be they yanked it so soon or went out of business?  It's been at least
3 months since I've toyed with those things, but I believe they were originally
uploaded in Nov.'90.  If you still can't find 'em, ask the SIGops what has
happened, and if it's impossible to find out, I don't know what to do since
they have restricted rules in sharing those things.  (I wonder if sharing the
converted files shouldn't have been done, too?)  I still have my copy of the
original .ARC on my CoCo3 system if someone will just tell me what I can/can't

any interaction between them.  The problem comes after iniz and before format,
that is mfplay works before R0 is inized but not after it is inized.  Doesn't
matter about the formatting.  If I dmode and format a large ramdisk, then I get
an out of memory error, but I get the 001 error before using significant
memory.  Does this signify some kind of problem in reading or writing to MIDI
and/or R0??  Is there one kind of read/write command for RBF and another for
SCF devices?  And why does the system view /R0 as different from /D0 or /H0??? 
I must go back and check the dd for those, but I seem to remember them to be
the same as R0.  Could it be in the device driver??  Thanks for looking.  Ches.

Well, it should not matter at all.  I use Tandy's modules with a patch from a
company who found the blocksize error - it wasn't getting enough 8k blocks to
fill out the entire size of the virtual disk.

Ok, the last resort is to get with the dude who wrote your MIDI driver itself.
I wrote my own drivers, as you might guess from the ACPDS7.TXT file I've posted
here.  (I am balking at sharing it due to "no response" from my pleas for help
on all three networks!  And sadly-lacking OS9 manuals with full descriptions of
the Get/Putstat calls.)

I'm surprised you'd try to run MFPlay with MultiVue.  When MV is running, it
has that mouse going all the time, I think.  That steals CPU cycles as well as
IRQs.  If the 60-Hz cycles don't come through, for F$Sleep delays, we could end
up missing some beats and the songs won't get played as accurately.  In fact,
I'm still having trouble getting the real busy songs playing without a
noticeable slow-down, and I'm using a modified RS232 pak and hard-wired IRQ
line, and tight efficient code in my ACIA driver with big I/O buffers.

Well, let me know if you find out what that conflict turns out to be!

Using mfplay_mem under multi-view shows no sign of slowdown except when I
"clear" from one screen to another.  Of course, the slowdown may be occurring
but just too little to be noticeable.  Running mfplay and /r0, I think I sense
a little slowdown in the PolySoft In The Mood selection, but I doubt a casual
listener would spot it.  My sensitivity has been honed a bit by listening to
that song through your various versions of mfplay as the delays became smaller
and smaller.  Thanks for the responses.  Ches.

Paul, it is tough when memory fails (either computer or human) - please accept
my apology for blaming my problem on mfplay!!!  When you first recommended
using a ramdisk some weeks (months?) ago, I found that there was some sort of
conflict between /midi and /r0 when I was running with MultiVue.  If I don't
start MV, no conflict between /midi and /r0.  Still don't know why, but if I go
without MV all works well.  Again, my apologies for wasting some of your time
on a problem not of your responsibility. And thanks once more for creating a
way to hear standard MIDI files. Regards, Ches.

That PolySoft stuff should be in the MIDI SIG here and on GEnie -- I grabbed
the Atari ST file and I think it was called MT32ST.ARC.  Other versions are
there, too, like for Cakewalk & Macs etc., so I found that the ST archive had
MFF1s sitting there waiting to be played.  And that archive had a small ReadMe
file which had that phone number I typed to ya.  (Their private SIG is on
GEnie.  I haven't logged on in quite some time, and if that phone # doesn't
work, I can only ask on GEnie what has happened.)

Finally got my uucp to work right.  The solution was to disable the
hi-res mouse.  I was running uucp in the background with gshell
as the only main, open window.  Someone on Delphi dropped that hint
along with an explanation that the mouse takes more and more cpu time
the further it is from 0,0.  I guess even SACIA coudln't deal with that.
 
All the while I was looking in the wrong places....

To all:

I promised Mark Griffith that I would say this:

  A couple of times, I left messages here indicating that I was having
  trouble getting Mark's uucp to work.  I just want to clarify that I 
  didn't mean I had trouble with his actual program.  What I meant was
  that I was having trouble making my set-up work with his obviously
  well written and debugged software!  Sorry Mark!

  I'm glad to hear you've got things sorted out.  Just to complicate things, I

OH SAY CAN YOU "C"...? Sorry I couldn't resist. I am in the process of working
on a program called MVWORD. I recently uploaded a file (MVWORD.AR). I am
currently working on the dialog boxes. While I am writing this in BASIC09, the
current version of GFX2 does not easily allow for Dialog Boxes (radio buttons,
etc..hint, hint KD?) I noted that on page 12 of ver 7 of Mike Sweets CFGX
library reference, there is an example of some code for dialog box functions.
At the moment I do not have access to a C compiler, but I was wondering if some
one did, I you might be willing to make a small demo program using this code
and upload it? In fact, if one of the C-programmer's out there would be willing
to write some demo programs using the CGFX library and post both the source and
the executable modules (I hope that's the correct terminology) it would be of
great help to all of us struggling C programmers. Thank you for your help,

Well,  Do you have Tandy Drives on your CoCo?  If they are FD-502's they are
double sided.  You just need to make a boot with the dual sided descriptors in
them and fix the drive cable.  If they're FD-501's then they're single sided.

Personally I like the CC.AR in DL 3 as a front end to the CoCo compiler. es /R0
for temporary files and really speeds up compiles.  If you run into any Q's,
just fire 'em this direction.

RAVE from MW which could be ported, and G-Windows, and MGR, and X, etc), but
the main thing stopping us on the Amiga is that we don't have the Amiga OS9
port in hand here in the US.  People are working on this tho.

You're not alone, btw... I get a lot of email here on CIS and on the Internet
from Amiga owners who'd like to be using OS-9 again.  Many of the better Amiga
OS commercial programmers came from the coco/os9 world, also.

This is now getting to the tough stage.

I would have expected you don't have a t2 any longer .... that's what you were
changing. It should have been rename into m1. Do you spot some 'unknown' module
hiding in memory? That might give us a clue.

When you were doing the debug, did the values that were displayed match those
in column 2? If not, perhpas you have a different
 /t2 than I have.

Do a MIDR right after making all the debug changes and see what's there.

This type of project via modem is difficult at best. So many places to go

Review docs on debug and cobbler and try again, paying close attention to the
values that debug spits out. This is fairly straight forward in theory ... but
in practice, can get hairy.

Cool!

See! ... I told you we'd get there!

Now .. lemme ask. When you saved the patched m1 module ... did you use VERIFY
and the u option? That's critical. The u option tels verify to UPDATE the CRC.

If all else fails, you can patch the CRC manually. The last 3 entries in our
list _is_ the CRC. Just review the steps that got you to this point, and you
should be home free.

Steve, I'm back to the modem pak direct without deskmate. I did save the
updated m1 module and did use the verify u . I tried making a new deskmate disk
with the one I used cobbler on and after copying all the files manually to it
(time consuming) I fired it up and tried it . M1 doesn't exist on it. The
cobbler didn't put it in the bootfile. If I update the crc manually,  do I need
to use verify too? I am so close now I just want to finish this thing. Thank
you for your help  with this project. I would not  have gotten this far without
it.

If you've received the JOIN message while in the forum, some folks in the
COnference area have INVITED you to JOIN their group.

Enter the CO area, select the room number where they reside (you can issue a

Hmmm .... just a thought, Tom:

Have you done an IDENT on the module you saved or just what's in memory?

If the save module is good, what you might try is booting up a fresh copy of
OS9 and loading the new module in memory, and then cobblering up a new boot.

IF you're running cobbler before you ditch the old version in memory, or even
if you're trying to load the new on on top of it (won't work) the bad CRC will
keep it from moving during cobbler.

Sounds as if the patch wasn't accepted properly... the CRC of the M1 or T2
module is probably bad in the bootfile, and thus isn't accepted at boot/load
time. Try doing an IDENT /d0/os9boot on one of the newer bootfiles.

I think that the Foxware product was vaporware.  As I remember it,
the ad you mentioned was the only one ever printed.  

Now, I just recently saw a message on the bitnet coco list that members
of the Australian os9 group have posted their own version of a CCenv
which is modeled after the turbo c environment.  It'll probably
make its way here at some point.

Best bet on fixing your GShell problem is patching an original with the last
set of patches.  I think they are in GSHEL3.AR  or some such file.

I can't seen to remember what was done to fix the problem you've been haiving,

After doing a BRO/key:GSHELL in DL 10 i came up with the file GSHEL2.AR as the
patches to GShell V1.24 to create V1.24a.  This is the patch that fixed the

GSHELL.AR  is the patch to the STOCK GShell to create V1.24.  That sould get

I can't think of any other way to generate and ESC, except CNTL-BREAK on the
CoCo keyboard.  A few years back,  I found another way....  I bought one of Bob
Puppo's XT keyboard interfaces.  Besides the modem, it was the best hardware
purchase I made.  It allows you to hit an ESC key only.  I think you can still
get the interface form FHL (Frank Hogg Labs).  The other bonus is that you can
use any XT/AT keyboard with the CoCo you want and put the CoCo under the desk.

impossible to download a binary file in this forum, which means I am really not
much better off than before I got this program.  Could there just be an
unlisted ESCape key sequence that sets these protocols?  Or should I look for
another OS-9 terminal program?  Or just stay with Mikeyterm 4.7 and DECB?  I
have had OS-9 LII for nearly 6 months and have accomplished near-nothing,
beyond four different boot disks.

Hi Erich - sterm will download using the much faster CompuServe "B" protocol,
which is why we all use it here.

When you're ready to download a file (in this example, after BROwsing), you
could type "dow /proto:b" which will prompt you for a filename on your disk to
go to, and all is automatic after that.

Or better: leave here and "go default" which is a free area on CIS where you
can set your default transfer protocol to "B", and then you'll always download
using it by default here on CIS.  Then you can just do a "dow" command on a
file and CIS will automatically use the B protocol.

This sounds harder even than it is... just GO DEFAULT and follow the prompts
for default transfer mode for Permanent sessions/settings.  Then come back and
try doing a download.  Yell if have troubles.  best - kev

Eh?  B protocol should work perfectly well for downloading binary files. What
makes you think that without XMODEM or Kermit protocol it is impossible to
download a binary file?

What _may_ be confusing you, Erich, is the absence of any command for a B proto
download on the startup screen of Sterm.

Not to worry ... B proto is built in. When you type DOW at the LIB prompt, and
specify B proto, CIS takes it from there and initiates the transfer.

B proto is yards faster than either xmodem or Kermit on CompuServe, but you
still  can use either by Shelling out and running an external protocol utility.

For instance, I log on routinely to a system in Florida and transfer files with
SZ/RZ (a zmodem external utility). Likewise, I'm forever moving files back and
forth between the office and home using Kermit. Just <ESC><S> to a shell and
issue the comands.

But here .... nothing beats typing DOW and letting the system take over!

What happens is that I ESC-c which turns on capture.  This seems to be doing
exactly the same thing as CTRL-1 on Mikeyterm.  Everything winds up in the
buffer (protocol menus, Enter a filename for your computer prompt, etc.). And
this capture seems to me to be no different than telling CIS dow filenm.ext
proto:capt.  I have considered altering my profile to a protocol in place of my
present "SHOW MENU".  But I make frequent use of both XMODEM and CAPTure on MT.
And I am planning to get a new DECB terminal program that will give m VT-100
emulation.  It supports YMODEM, which is one more protocol to deal with.  So
SHOW MENU seems to be the best for me to use until once and if I have terminal
programs for both DECB and OS-9 that both support the same fast protocol (e.g.,
YMODEM (or ZMODEM once and if CIS supports it)).

Nothing wrong with the SHOW MENU option. I'm still set that way .. out of
laziness, if nothing more..

<ESC><C> is similar to Mikeyterm's <CNTL>-1 in that it captures incomming data,
but while MTERM is limited to appx. 40K, STERM is only limited by the amount of
available disk space.

Downloading directly to disk is a big plus when dealing with large files.

OK, but how does that ESC-c enable downloading in CIS B protocol?  It seems I
can only ASCII CAPTure on sterm.  Perhaps I just don't know enough about how B
protocol works, but I just don't see it.  I may go back to the Practice Forum
and just try to download something and see what happens with it.  At least I
won't get a 4-digit bill experimenting.

Erich,

<ESC><C> won't enable B proto downloading. That only opens a capture buffer for
ASCII captures.

B proto is automatic. Lemme try this:

When you type DOW filename and select B proto, CIS polls your terminal program
with an specific escape series. They call it an INQUIRY.

If your terminal program supports B proto, it "knows" to respond back to the
INQUIRY with an appropriate answer and the transfer takes off. If not, it sits
there dumbly for 3 attempts (just to make sure it got it right) and bombs out.

This is all going on between the host (cis) and the remote terminal (you). The
operator has no involvement other than answering what ever prompts the system
may throw at you.

Give it a try and you'll see what I mean. Enter any LIB, and nab a file using B
proto. Sit back and watch!

Ross,

If I recall, Deskmate is on a 'limited distribution' OS9 disk. There are some
utilities (commads) but not many ... but it will give you a flavor.

On the other had, Dynacalc is only an application disk. Somewhere on the
package it should tell you you need the Operating system for proper execution.

Steve, Ross; Dynacalc from Radio Shack comes with a limited level one bootup
capability.  So you can use it as a stand alone package.  However that is the
32 column screen.  You can run dynacalc under level two, with the 80 column
screen.  I forget if there was a patch required to run it.

There's not a patch to allow it to run on Lvl 2.  Dynacalc automagically
adjusts its worksheet dimensions to accommodate whatever size window it happens
to be started in.

There is a patch to take out the extra linefeed that it does during print
operations.  Also there's a patch around somewhere that allows the use of .dyc
as the spreadsheet file extensions instead of .cal which gets mixed up with
Deskmate's Calender files.
   The extension overlaps only really causes a problem in a hard drive
environment where you would (and could) have deskmate and dynacalc up at the
same time particularly in the Multi-Vue mode of operations.

The reason I knew about the Boot up ability is that I've been demonstrating it
at the store.  However I have to first boot up on the later version of OS-9
level one, to allow it to work on the coco III's which were all that we had in
the store.  I think that we have 4 copies of dynacalc in my store at 4.95 each,
and also have a OS-9 level II startup kit at ? 9.95 .  I don't know what else
we have since they're all bagged up in the back of the store. We just went thru
a complete remodeling, and I don't think that the manager wants put them back
up on display.  And I agree.  There realy isn't room on the shelves for this

If I'm not mistaken, standard search pattern for OS9 is, check memory, if not

Have you tried issuing a  'chx /dd/cmds' and 'chd /dd' to get things pointed in
the right direction after you've swapped in the applicaion disk?

Are you talking about the Tandy Version of Dynacalc requiring the DIR command

Rick, before I got a hard drive, I patched Dynacalc at location $0B70 which
should read on your system "dynacalc.trm".  I changed that using dED to read
"/dd/cmds/dyt", then requested that dED re-verify the newly patched Dynacalc.
  This patch will make Dynacalc look for the a file called "dyt" in the CMDS
directory on your system's Default Drive.  You'll have to copy dynacalc.trm
from your data disks to /DD/CMDS with the name DYT, but at least you won't have
to have copy of it on most, if not all, of your data disks.
  Dynacalc.trm is almost 13K, so it will take some space, but at least it will
only be taking up space in one place.

Dunno if the coco version is the same, but the generic version of Dynacalc
would look in the execution directory if a copy wasn't found in the current
directory. Of course I had to keep multiple copies in various directories
because of different terminal types I had. I ended up writing a 'dc' shell that
would check the crt type (via a /dd/sys/ttytype entry) and copy the appropriate
.trm file to the local directory before invoking Dynacalc.

I guess you could put Dynacalc.trm in your SYS directory, too.  You'd just have
to move the $0D (carriage return) that delimits the file name string in
Dynacalc one position to the left.  Or you could just change the string to
"/dd/sys/dytr" or something like that so that the string length was exactly the
same as the old.

Anyway, there's more than a few options that can be done or not done as the
case may be.

I too picked up Deskmate at a closeout price. I did find that it contains os9

os9 you can use COPY to add the commands you may desire to the deskmate disk. I
just added an M1 driver to mine with the help of the folks here and I now can
use my DCM pak with deskmate. You would be making a smart investment if you
purchased os9 while you still can.

I'd suggest downloading RELAY.AR in Lib10.  Once you use AR to unARchive it,
you will get a new command to add to your /cmds directory.  Then all you need
to do is type relay on or relay off.  /t1 is not needed for this, but I presume
a remote user under /t1 can reach Relay as you can under /term.

   First, you must be in the OS9 environment. Or, be able to transfer the file
over to the OS9 environment using DOSOR9.BAS.
   Download AR09.BIN from LIB 9.
   Once this file is on an OS9 disk...make sure the attributes are PE,PW,E,W
(the PR and R are optional, but the others should be set on).....and then
rename the file to AR using the command: RENAME AR09.BIN AR
   Viola! Once this is done, AR is a viable command you can use under the OS9
operating systme.

Fm: Rod Motto 73247,424
To: ALL

Hi All, I use the VI editor on InterGraph UNIX boxes at work and have gotten
pretty good at using it.  Now I've been using TSEDIT for OS-9 for a long time
because of its simularities to VI, but as anyone who has used TSEDIT knows its
capabilities are limited... My question is; Is there another OS-9 editor that
uses more of VI's command set?  Or something simular?? Any comments/suggestions
are appreciated.             -rod

Only such editors I know of are large enough that they run on OS-9/68000. Those
are stevie and elvis, both originally written for Unix and ported to
OS-9/68000.  Might check to see whether someone's put them in the 68K DL here.

Say...at RAINBOWFest, if I remember rightly, Paul Ward said you were the fellow
from whom he got a keyboard that was hooked up to an MM/1 that was

1. small

2. had the <extremely long string of expletives deleted> control key in the
right place, unlike just about every other <extremely long string etc.> PClone
keyboard.

I'm currently using a relatively inexpensive beast I bought from Midwest Micro
Peripherals that lets me put the control key in the right place--the only other
one I know of (ones) are some rather more expensive Northgate keyboards.  If
you know where I can find a *small* but complete keyboard suitable for an MM/1
that has the control key just left of A (where <insert deity> meant it to be
:-), then I'd *love* to hear about it!

I have successfully used sterm 1.2 with my DC Modem Pak.  I now have a
Hayes-compatible modem which I use with a COCOPRO! RS-232 pak.  I have been
unable to use sterm with the new modem.  /t3 cannot be opened but I do get a
baud rate message with /t1 and /t2.  But in both cases, the modem does not
respond to my ATDT commands (or any other).  The phone dialer at ESC-p doesn't
seem to work either (is it set up for pulse only?).  The DCD line is forced
high as I do in Mikeyterm 4.7; the DCD high setting is saved in nonvolatile
RAM.  I tried ESC-e but it didn't help.  What else can I do?

Can someone with a Disto SC-II, 4-in-1 combination answer this question?
Physically, what does this device look like?  Is it a box that plugs into the
side of the CoCo3 that contains some sort of slot for the 4-in-1? Is it a big
cartridge-like device with some sort of internal expansion slot?  I'm trying to
come up with a neat configuration for my CoCo3 that doesn't involve lots of
extra boxes (like the Multipak) and wires.  Will the Disto combination fill
those requirements?

    I just bought one; and am very pleased with the no halt controller. As I
type this online, a dsave is running in the background and I'm not missing any
typed characters.
    Anyway, the SC-II is a metal box about the same size as a Radio Shack
DCMpak. It plugs into the side of the Coco or into a multipak. The top unscrews
and the 4 in 1 board, amazingly enough, plugs upside down on top of the
controller board. You punch out a cut in the side of the cover, hook up some
cables, and screw the cover back on. The whole thing is easy to do and the
resulting package is small.
    You have to plug in an extra 9-volt adapter into a plug in the side of it
to run the new RS-232 port. Altogether you get two ribbon cables coming out the
top (floppy drive and SASI/SCSI), and two cables coming out the side (parallel
printer and RS-232) plus one little plug for power in the side.
    The software under OS-9 is easy to install too. I bought mine from Cocopro,
Ypsilanti, MI. The owner Dave is a very helpful fellow.

it has now been discontinued... there will be no more.  I don't know why, and
it was a surprise, because I was just about to do the same reconfiguration. 
(I.e. lose the Multipak -- I'm putting 5 drives + COCO in an AT case,  The

Alas, I think that you'll find that pkz110.zip and lh113c.exe are (or in the
case of the former, contain) 8086 executables and hence they're of no use on
the CoCo.

Two things--OK, three--about ar09.bin.  One: rename it just plain "ar".  Two:
make sure it's in the CMDS directory of your boot disk.  (When you say "master"
you don't mean the very first copy that you bought from whoever, do you?  If
you do, then I fear you've made a mistake--back it up and use the copy
instead.) Three: make sure it has "execute" attributes set.  Once you have in
the CMDS directory, and if that's in /d0, then "attr /d0/cmds/ar e pe" should
do the job.

OK Pete,

I'm not real sure of this internet addressing tho...  It seems that unsvax
(Known as NEVADA.EDU on the internet) doesn't get the mail I send thru it VIA
uunet.UU.NET, uunet likes to bounce it back to me when trying to reach htsmm1
from CIS.

The address "uunet!unsvax!jimi!htsmm1!mikeh" gets munged into "mikeh@htsmm1"
when routed thru Internet!!!!  It turns out that 'unsvax' only talks with
'jimi' (my end) and 'uunet' (the out side world) and uunet doesn't like the
addressing.  Sheesh!

I just might end up applying for a uunet domain name or a US domain name so the
internet will know about my little machine.  At the moment, only 'jimi' knows I
exist.

It just might be time to send mail to the sysop@unsvax.NEVADA.EDU, no? <g>

A chat with Carl Kreider told be that some of the drivers are extremely
stOOpid... Apperently DTR isn't raised implicitly on first path open. There's
allegedly a setstat call (_SS_RTS ?) that will explicitly muck with the line.
Carl has apperently mixed these in on Mtsmon and Ckermit. Other (groan)
_standard_ tools (Tsmon, etc.) don't handle this.

Hmmm...I always have to look up which clib* is which--cc always takes care of
it, right? <grin>  I will go look it up again, but if you want to find out
experimentally, you can compile something short with and without -x, and with
the various 020 math options, and use -bp so that you'll see what is handed to
the linker.  That's what influences the choice of libraries.

Hi James, No I didn't mean my "System Master", I meant the master copy. Second,
it is in the cmds dir. Third, I named it "arc" instead of "ar"(does this
matter?).Fourth, I did set all of the attributes.And fifth, I had to erase a
bunch of the cmds and sys directories for the room to fit in on the disk
(cmp,format,grfdrv, modpatch,montype,etc). All thhe things I didn't think I'd
need to de-arc a file. One of the things I've been wondering about though is
that Ultimaterm has "Basic binary" and "Machine language" parameters. I've been
using the latter. How would I know which one to store the programs on disk
under? Since I'm using a Coco should I be downloading under "Basic binary"?
Thanks a heap, Mark

It's best to keep the name of the file and the name of the module in it (or the
first module in it, since in general a file could contain more than one module)
the same, because OS-9 will look for a module in memory before going to disk to
try to grab the file.  If the names are the same, you don't have to worry about
whether you explicitly loaded the file or not when deciding what to type at the
shell.  I really couldn't tell you what the Ultimaterm settings mean, but...
keep ident in the CMDS directory on the disk.  Use whatever setting on
Ultimaterm that will result in ident giving the correct CRC for the ar module.

Mark,
   Here are the files then:
     LIB 10 - UNZIP2.PAK
     LIB 9  - DEARC.BIN (and source code is DEARC.C)
     (and if you don't have the UNPAK utility for de-arcing UNZIP2.PAK then
      you'll need to grab PAK.BIN out of LIB 10 as well.)

    Now remember....anytime you have these .BIN files you will need to reset
the attributes properly, such as with DEARC.BIN:
    ATTR DEARC.BIN pw pe w e

    This will allow you to then execute or write to the file. You may wish to
write to the file to shorten the name down from DEARC.BIN to DEARC:
    RENAME DEARC.BIN DEARC

    Lemme know if you need any more help....and have fun!

If by "Plan 9" you mean the experimental distributed system that they're
working on at Murray Hill, nope, this isn't the same thing.  OS-9 refers to two
very similar operating systems intended for real time use on 6809 and 680xx
systems.  (This area also has a little discussion of the portable descendant of
OS-9, OS-9000.)

Hi James, I renamed the arc file "ar" then I did an ident and got "module

To get both those messages, what probably had to happen is that the xmodem
transfer was OK, but, thanks to xmodem's being designed for CP/M, it left stray
junk at the end.  There are a couple of ways around this:

1. Assuming that the attributes are set, type "load ar".  ar will then be
   in memory even though you get an error message; the error message is
   caused by the trailing xmodem droppings.  Now, if you have the "save"
   program, you can "del /d0/cmds/ar; save ar" and you'll have just ar,
   ready to go.  Save is unbundled from OS-9 Level Two, but there are
   freely-copyable equivalents here.  (Catch-22?  No, because once you've
   loaded something, you can run it from memory, so you can "load save",
   and then save save as well as save ar.) 2. Look at the module length that
ident shows for ar.  Use a program like
   ded to chop the file /d0/cmds/ar to that length.

Method (1) is probably the safest, since you don't have to remember or write
down any lengths--load and save do it all for you.

Well I still need a little help. As I told James, I literally had to erase
almost the entire CMDS and SYS directories to fit AR09 on the disk. Is this
normal? It seems as though the disk would have more space than that on it.(I
think it said before this that there were 173 sectors clear with the largest
having 39 blocks).Also what exactly are the commands to execute the AR file and
a program on another disk? I tried <load /d0/cmds/ar /d1/xxxx.arc> and every
other conceivable combination to no avail.

You don't want to load a .arc file; only load files containing modules
(straight modules, not compressed and archived modules).  In any case, the "ar"
program won't handle .arc files, only .ar files.  For .arc files you will want
one of the programs called "dearc" that should be available here in one of the
DL areas.

Paul - I think you might try "LS.AR" and/or "LSH.BIN" in Library 9.

I use an old version of lsh all the time, partly for the decimal sizes and
partly because it tells me the space used and free, in decimal.

Hope those are what you need! - kev
