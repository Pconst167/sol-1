Likewise the DED utility can be use to patch a file back into existence, but
one also has to understand the file structure really well, otherwise, well...

Erich,

Its no consolation, but there is an undel utility that comes with the famous
(and equally unavailable) OS9 upgrade. If I remember correctly, it required
modifications to RBF, so it I don't think its _possible_ to implement one with
the current RBF, which clobbers some critical information when a file is
deleted.

Another method of getting files back (yes, I deleted an entire directory of
source files with no backup one night) is to use a utility like DED to suck the
text off the bad disk onto a new one. What I did was to open the disk with the
deleted files on it (something like "ded /dd@") and then find the text files.
Then I opened an output file (make sure it's on a different disk!) and then I
just read the sectors and saved them out. Only took a few hours to undo the
work of a few seconds--but then what fun would life be otherwise.

It won't help on my floppy-based system, but there may be a way to do it on
hard drive systems.  It would at minimum require a new Del command. Whenever a
file is deleted, a file is created/extended as appropriate in the /h0/SYS
directory that maintains a record of the file name, its LSN's, etc.--with
provisions to keep /h0/SYS/Delrecords from overwriting any of the new file.  An
Undelete utility would go to Delrecords and see if the location(s) have since
been re-allocated to something else.  If not, they are re-marked as used and
the directory is updated.  Alternatively, the dir entry can be removed but
nothing else changes (comparable to the file hiding utils in B&B's File System
Repack).  You can then use a Cleanup command to permanently erase a file and
release its sectors.  Either way the normal Del action has to be intercepted. 
I don't know enough about the file system to assess the viability of these
schemes--let alone implement them--they're just ideas.

Hi Ed!

     No, I don't have a UUCP link going.  I don't have a lot of things going
yet.  I've had much to deal with lately, and it has prevented me from doing a
lot on my system.  Besides, my system is not working in a stable enough manner
for me to have much motivation to develop things on it.  That is going to have
to change, though...

     I'm still on 2.3 of OSK.  I have 2.4 here, but I haven't upgraded because
I am still seeing some "misbehaving" that I'd like to work out while I'm still
using the same OS9 and utilities as I was used to on my old system. On
September 12, I sent Frank a message detailing some of these anomalies. As of
today, I have not heard any reply from him.  A month and a half and counting...

I've not yet used eitther but that should change within a weeks' time; then I
may be using them regularly.  In the manual, they said that Binex requires an
absolute address even though OS-9 is normally postition-independent, and their
example has something like $100 given as the address.  So just pressing ENTER
at the 2 prompts will suffice then?  Exactly what are those specifications for
anyway?

Exactly...

BINEX and EXBIN are os9 commands, but the format they work with (S Record) is
an ascii-fied binary form developed by Motorola for all kinds of uses (not
specifically os9).

The most common use was sending code over serial lines to EPROM burners, and
for loading code into target systems via ROM debugger routines.. primarily
developmental stuff. In those cases, absolute addressing may have been required
("this goes into the EPROM at offset $4000", etc.).

Thanks for helping me with S-Records.  The way I intend to use them is to carry
binary files between different computers' disk systems, one of them being my
CoCo3.  They cannot directly read each other's disks but both can read and
write MS-DOS disks.  But the other system cannot presently import/export binary
files with MS-DOS disks.  I have found a S-Record util for the other system, so
when sending binary files to my CoCo3, I'll make an S-Record representation,
export to DOS, take the disk to the CoCo3, pcdos -get /d1 binfile.sr
/r0/binfile.sr, and exbin /r0/binfile.sr.  DOS is acting as the intermediary
link.  This may seem rather cumbersome, but considering all the hours I've been
transferring back and forth via comm programs at 2400bps, even a cumbersome
disk exchange is a pleasant change.

I have a tiny problem which I have ignored for a while now, but in talking to a
friend (Bob van der Poel) on the phone I discovered that it may have been a
topic of conversation while I was off CIS for about a year. The problem is that
I now have a Disto SC II (my older SC I is still in use on another CoCo 3 here)
and run my printer off the parallel port of the newer 3 in 1 board.

This port is addressed differently than the earlier one (on the 2 in 1 board,
remember them?) so uses a different driver. The problem is that the printer
occasionally gets line feeds (or CR's; who knows) when I am doing some
nonprinter related OS9 operation. Mostly I just leave the thing off line, but I
occasionally forget and lose my top-of-form.

So, I am told that something along these lines was discussed here some time ago
and a fix was found. Something to do with the version of GIME, Bob thinks. Can
anyone remember? Is there a fix? If so, what's it called and is it posted?
Thanks in advance.

Those flashes may be Radio Frequency Interference.  If RFI is actually present,
try moving the drives and monitor further apart.  Also try better shielded
cable between the CoCo and the drives (or add shielding with aluminum foil
around the cable).  A metal drive case ought not need additional shielding but
you can always try.  One other thing to try is connecting the monitor's power
cable and the drives' power cable into separate circuits as interference can be
transmitted through your home's electrical system. For more info, you might
want to GO CEFORUM.

If you call them, and request data sheets and specs on the 68070 and the VSC

Also, contact Microware, and for $10 (for S&H, I assume), they'll send you out

If you have BASIC 1.0, you are probably using a BASIC program you were
instructed to type in and then SAVE"*".  To boot OS-9 you type RUN"*". If this
is indeed the case, LOAD"*" and LIST it.  Check the listing against the one
printed in the book very carefully, and fix any errors you may discover.  If
that fails, are you sure you have a good OS-9 disk?  See if you can get another

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

Has any thought been given to termcap usage with Basic programs? I can see lots
of new OSK folks writing neat little things with Basic and, because there is no
termcap for Basic, ending up hardcoding display codes--and that would be a real
shame. I've given the subject a fair amount of thought and I really don't see a
easy way to use termcap from Basic (mainly because of a lack of static and
global storage--I could give more on this if there is interest), besides, a lot
of the things people will be doing will involve window codes, etc. which
termcap doesn't support. So, as an alternative, I suggest that standard
interfaces be set up. Each one of these would be written for a specific
terminal, but they would all expect the same params (and they'd be Basic
procedures, even though they need not be written in Basic). For K-windows we
might have a module called "basic_kcurses", for vt100 "basic_vtcurses", etc.
Before doing any terminal output the program could decide which interface to
use (perhaps from the TERM shell variable) and then pass this name around to
the routines which need it. To set the cursor you'd do something like "RUN
GFXPROC(path,"gotoxy",x,y)". GFXPROC would be a variable which could be
"basic_kcurses" or whatever. This is just a suggestion! But we better get
together and set some "standards". Also, I'd appreciate it if someone would
start similar threads on other services--that way everyone will have a change
to become involved.

Actually, you've mentioned previously the possibility of allocating memory on
the fly.  This seems like the best bet to me.

The first thing the program would run each time would be RUN TERMCAP("Init")
oops I mean RUN Termcap("Init",ADDR(storage))... <grin>.  Then each call would
also pass the same storage pointer.

The neat thing is, a program could actually talk to several different types of
terminals at once (!) by simply calling the Init routine with different storage
parms.

The other calls would be normal.. RUN Termcap("InsertLine",ADDR(storage)) and
so on.

BTW, it turns out that Basic/68K does pass the environment onto subprograms, so
one way to get env vars would be to fork a printenv process that was piped back
in for reading.

The result was that a procs of the system would show that mmon was NOT active.

So, I tried 'watch'.....at least that stayed active....but wouldn't respond to
a call in.

logon, of course, according to the help file, is supposed to be called from
mmon (if I can ever get it to recognize /t1)

Anyone out there have any luck with these modules??

Thanks

Jim,

Is there a 'line' option in mmon? Kind like the changes Mark just put into
Sterm where you must specify the modem line you want with an '-l' option (Sterm
-l /t5).

Just a thought .... I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about!  :-)

BTW ... an update on the PROCS output issue we were taling about a few days
ago. Seems as if reseting the clock corrected the problem for a short period of
time only ...  after a couple of days of uninterupted running, we're back to
the same ol' stuff.

Did Frank ever get back to you over on Delphi about this?

I'm attempting to run another COCO 3 as a terminal to my other 3, under OS-9
L2.

I do the tsmon /t2& command, which runs perfectly, I log on with my terminal
and I can run all the OS-9 commands & utils fine. However, how do I go about
running things like Rogue, Flight Simulator II, or any other OS-9 programs?
Nothing appears to happen when I attempt it. Do I need to be running OS-9 on my
terminal also??

Right now, I running Ultimaterm on my terminal.

How do I go about setting this up correctly??  Any help would be appreciated!!!

Thanks,

Bob

Bob - most of those programs either use VDG screens (direct access), or rely
somewhere on get/setstat calls which the serial driver doesn't know how to
process (and really can't).

If you can find a program which only uses escape codes for output, does no
get/setstt calls for windows, and doesn't use the mouse... then that will work.
But there are not many (any?) of those.  - kev

Kevin:

Hi, I found out that it works (my modem with sterm on the MM/1)

If when I type in the date I press the SHIFT 8 and DO NOT get the * then the
modem will not echo back to the screen.

The keyboard does not get iniz right some times.

Keith,

Wow.  That's weird!  (Halloween sounds in background)

Hmm.  If you have a VOM, you might check the power lines and what the t0 lines
are like on each power-up situation.  Just a thought.

thx for the update!

Believe that 's correct. To be sure, best bet is to type HELP when you get in
to cmail. There's a separate blurb on 'internet'.

Here you go Ed:

Use the "CoCo List" address to post messages. Anything sent to that address
will be re-broadcast to all subscribers.

User the  "Listserv" address to Subscribe to the List ... or issue any of the
other LISTSERV commands (get, put, Index, etc).


Give me a holler if you need more info.

By the way ... you don't need to be a subscriber to post messages to the LIST.
But to read the LIST you must subscribe.
