Jim,

I'm not aware of any 'free access' to USENET feeds here on CompuServe. What you
might have heard about was that CompuServe Mail supports a gateway to INTERNET
... or possibly about the INTERNET mailing list that supports the CoCo (better
said, OS9) that I routinely capture and post in LIB 14.

Unfortunately, both do ring up connect charges.

Sb: #LOGO just might work
Fm: REX GOODE 73777,3663
To: All

 While browsing through my D.L. Logo manual, I noticed a remote control section
that described how to use Logo to control remote devices. This may be the
answer I was hoping for to update D.L. Logo to work with my CM-8 monitor. I
might even be able to get more colors and higher resolution.
 When "LOGO" is executed from OS9, it checks for a module in memory called
"Turtle". If such a module is in memory, then all Logo Turtle commands are
routed through that module as a subroutine, with registers holding the command
and parameters, returned with an RTS.
 I'm a fair EDTASM programmer under RSDOS, but I don't even have an assembler
for OS9 and don't know where to begin. If I can figure out how, I can write
this assembler program to control the turtle on the higher resolutions instead
of artifact screens.
 Is there a way to write the module mostly under RS-DOS and then somehow
transfer it to OS9? Is there a cheap (almost free) way to program in assembly
or machine language in OS9? What entries and exits must my module have? Am I
wasting my time?

I submitted a file called 'boiler.asm' some years ago here that was a
boilerplate os9 assembler template.  Showed you what was necessary and where to
insert your code and data. You could probably use that for starters.

The hardest part is that the os9 assembler has one or two hardcoded macros for
generating the start of module header.... you'd have to emulate that in edtasm
to get things to work, or at least leave room for it and generate the header
after the fact.

     Using the kernal patch in krnl.ar, I find that I have 8k less
   free memory after booting than if I use the 'mega' command.
   This isn't alot of memory to worry about but do you know why this
   happens? 'Mega' didn't work so hot at times; certain programs
   would not run correctly if I had run 'mega' already. So I was happy
   to see this patch.
                          Just curious,
                                       Paul R.

Pete,
 I don't know if you've seen my other messages about trying to get Logo to work
on a CM-8, but I think I've come up with something that will work. Problem is,
I'm so green in OS9, that I don't quite know what to do. I stumbled on MASM.BIN
in the libs and thought, "Hey, that's just what I need." I haven't got Deskmate
working yet and still don't have a smooth way of getting files from CIS to OS9,
so I tried the following:

 1. I downloaded MASM.BIN to my IBM AT. (also DEMO1.TXT)
 2. I used AS9TOOLS to copy MASM.BIN to RS-DOS diskette. I tried two
    versions: [TOC MASM.BIN p b] & [TOC MASM.BIN d b]. If you aren't
    familiar with AS9TOOLS, "p b" is program file/binary and "d b" is
    data file/binary. (also DEMO1.TXT)
 3. I then tried to use DOSOR9 to make an OS9 disk out of it, but TOC
    must write the files to track 0, therefore DOSOR9 wouldn't work.
 4. Then I use RSDOS' copy to get a new RSDOS diskette with MASM.BIN.
 5. Then I use DOSOR9 successfully to make an OS9 disk.
 6. Then I used OS9 to copy to a regular OS9 disk. (just to be safe)
 7. I had a few problems with write permission on the files but I seemed
    to have solved them.

      OS9: chx /d0
      OS9: chd /d0

    Both MASM and demo1.txt are on the root directory. I've tried more
    specific versions of that last command, like: /D0/MASM /D0/DEMO1.TXT,
    always with the same result.

 I've never, ever, in my whole life, run anything on OS9 that I didn't buy a
whole disk for, meaning, I don't really even know how to get an executable
binary file to work. Where did I go wrong?

Did you set MASM's file attributes so that they allow execution?

Try this (assumes you have only 1 disk drive):

  1. Load attr
  2. Insert MASM disk
  3 chx /d0;chd /d0
  4. attr /d0/masm e pe

Now it should execute.

Bear in mind that BOILER.ASM was written with OS9's ASM in mind. If using MASM,
it may have a different MACRO for header generation, etc.

Also - if you're getting errors, it may be because you don't have the files or
path specified in the USE nnnnnn... directives. Essentially,, USE is just
saying 'include file nnnnn at this point'. Frequently used for specifying
EQUATES, RMBs, etc.

Sb: module upgrades
Fm: Paul Hanke 73467,403
To: Kevin Darling 76703,4227

I made the kernel upgrade recently; some questions- since OS9 now recognizes 1
& 2 meg upgrades, is the MEGA command still necessary during startup; and is
the upgraded MFREE needed yet?
-------------------

A coupla days ago I upgraded SCF, CC3Disk, CC3IO, & ACIAPAK. Before placing
them into MultiVue, I decided to install 'em into the OS9 boot.  I found that
all windows got messed up except for vdg.  I replaced the new kernel with the
old one, & booted again. This time,   the window created by
INIZ /W7; SHELL i=/W7&
was ok, but all graphics windows created by
INIZ /W#; DISPLAY 1B 20 7 0 0 50 18 2 0 2 >/W#; SHELL I=/W#&

somehow got background &/or foreground munged; border color was correct. Since
I replaced 4 modules at the same time I haven't a clue as to which the
offending one might be. The new crc's are:
         
      module              crc
     CC3DISK             $E11F29
     SCF                 $B41573
     CC3IO               $D5CD91
     ACIAPAK             $946661

My only guess is that ACIAPAK has nothing to do with the problem.  -ph-
