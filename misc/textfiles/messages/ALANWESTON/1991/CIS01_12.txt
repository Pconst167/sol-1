Frank, as far as I can tell, with DMODE the MM/1 driver (actually the
descriptor) can be set to read any format known, as long as it's "known" what
it is, grin. MM/1's "standard" is 33 (or 34?) sectors per track -- some folks
use more, but it isn't 100% safe.

I hear that some "standards" (new ones) are just bypassing Track 0, with its
confusion as to what density it is.

Anyway, there is a set of about 6 parameters that serve to describe any format
well enuf that with DMODE you can zap a descriptor to read it.  If we could
settle on a common set of names for those parameters, then vendors could label
disks with the key parameters.  I've scribbled a fewon your DS 3.5" disk
already, grin.

Oh yes, Coco 720K DS-80T 3.5" disks don't read on an MM/1 without changing a
few parameters either.  So many standards -- so little time -mike k.

The 'standard' that skips track zero is referred to as the 'universal' format.
MW does have a numbering system that used to be in their sig here on cis but
Kev tells me that it is no longer there??? I have it somewhere and will upload
it 'if' I find it.

With the ability to change descriptors and also the ability and room (memory)
to have named descriptors it really doesn't matter what each company uses as
long as the disk has the info on it that is useful. To this end I will be doing
'something' on the disks we ship out in the future.

How about a 'read me' file on the disk... (ha ha)

BTW we are working on a upgrade to DynaStar to fix some of the little bugs and
make a few changes, little ones, to make it easier to use. We are also trying
to make it work as the manual says it does. Or... we'll change the manual to
reflect what it actually does. If you have any 'small' suggestions now is the
time to speak up. This is 'not' a rewrite, just a touch-up.

He he -- a readme file on the unreadable disk, grin. Glad to hear you're
cleaning up DS.  At the moment I can't think of LITTLE fixes, other than
finding the bug which very rarely causes DS to write the last line of file
forever till your disk fills up. Oh yes, how about that final non-newline
character that sometimes can't be made to go away?  I heard that shouldbe easy
to fix.

Would be nice to be able to save yaour file and go on editing the same file at
the same place, but I guess that's not a minor fix.

Could you add a way to QUICKLY set all TABS to 4 spaces instead of 5?

Oh here's a nasty bug -- ^KA puts only 1 space instead of 2 after periods,
unless you end each sentence with a period, space, and newline. Same bug
applies to question and exclmataioion marks.  PLEASE fix that one-I saw a
reviewer really rag about it, and it bothers me too.

Dyna Form needs to crash the system less often when things aren't quite right
in the .init file.  Some printer code definitions crash it. Also you need to be
able to send zero-bytes in the printer commands (I think that's fixed in OSK?).
"nuff bugs for now -- mike k.

Both Glen's MTMIDI and Jonathan's MTPanel are available in DL4 and both work
nicely.  Unfortunately both are unfinished and Jonathan hasn't been by to see
my query and let me know whether any more work has been done on his. 
Jonathan's MTPanel has the promise of providing voice editing for the MT32
equivalent to Bill's TX81Z voice editor in RS Basic.  If you haven't looked at
Bill's, you might wish to get it out of CoCo DL4 (? or 5) and take a look at
its implementation.  'Tis interesting to compare all three. Glen's is
incomplete in the controls area and would be fun to see complete just for the
fun of having an impressive control panel.  He says he hasn't done any more
work on it and I urged him to complete both that and the Fallin.UME that is
really neat but O so short!  Regards, Ches.

I think that one *big* roadblock to my looking into doing something to let me
mung patches and the like on the MT-32 is that the docs that come with it don't
explain diddly about L/A synthesis, or what any of the buzzwords or acronyms
mean and how they affect the sound of a patch, or anything like that.  Is there
any good description of that lying around that one can find somewhere?

Not that I'm aware of.  I've just had the MT-32 a couple of weeks so I am not
very well acquainted with it yet.  I've had the Yamaha TX81Z for a couple of
years or so, so I'm better acquainted with it.  I thought it had manual
shortcomings, but it did explain much better how it synthesized tones.  The
Roland manual is somewhat better in its understandability, but I agree with
your observation that it does nothing for the user in aiding understanding of
the LA approach.  Sorry!.  Ches.

I heard that the only way to get a "manual" for the MT32 that explains how to
use the parameters, is to order a manual for the D-50 or another similar
keyboard synthesizer. I guess if they give you a keyboard they also let you
adjust the parameters too, so they tell you what they mean. Of course with a
really good grafix editor, you could learn pretty quickly by trial-and-error,
just alike a REAL synth with a square yard of knobs.

Hi Mike... I just bought a brand new D-50 last Friday. Mucho fun! Learning to
program it taught me everything I was unclear about on the MT-32. You all
should expect a decent MT-32 (and D-50) patch editor soon if I can find the
time. When I get my MM/1, I plan to write a patch librarian too. So, if you
can't figure out how to program your MT-32, get a copy of the D-50 (or D-20 or
D-110) manual - all are quite similar. You'll find it helpful...

Pete, it's beena awhile since I was last here, but I've been told that Casios
can indeed be cajoled into sending a NOTE ON by playing with the mod wheel,
etc. This is from other MIDI hackers who confirmed that Casios overuse running
status to the max, and your software must always intiialize to a NOTE ON when
recording from one. I think keyboards should use running status ONLY when "no
time" has elapsed between the note events, where "no time" depends of course on
the synth's clock speed.  In other words, a chord. I've never used a Casio
keyboard to drive anything else -- I got a real Korg for that.  --mike k

I had heard similar rumors... that a casio sends a NOTE ON on its assigned
channel at powerup, and then relies on running status for the rest.. argh! What
a nightmare. That certainly explains the proliferation of stuck note problems
with Casios. In fact, the new Sequencer Plus Gold from Voyetra has a /CASIO
switch!

Well - I'm not Umuse literate per se (Mike Knudsen is the author), but the
scoop is:

a) For the time being, UME cannot record from the MIDI INPUT. I know Mike's
working on it, but knowing what's involved, I can tell you it's a b*tch to do
under OS9.

b) Most packages these days can read and write Standard MIDI Files (usually
called MFF's or SMF's). Kind of like GIF for MIDI. I don't know if he's
installed it yet, but there have been discussions (initiated by Mike, I think)

I wrote a simple set of programs to record and playback MIDI under OS9.  All
very legitimate, no screwing around with interrupts or anything.  I will upload
them here when they are debugged, but first I havae to get a faster chip
(68B50) for my MIDI interface pack, since the current 6850 drops bytes now and
then, ugh. You certainly cannot record MIDI thru the rear serial port, even tho
it plays just fine under UME.

Getting from hand-played recording to notation score is a real, ah, fun

John - interesting thought!

One of the guys here has been working on a similar thing: it runs L-II/6809
software under OS9/68K.  It's written well enough that it could probably be
made to run under other systems also (altho I suspect that it would help a lot
if the other system was also a multitasking one).

But even tho this emulator is highly tuned, it's still tens of times slower (at
least) than a coco-3, even when run on an 030.  It's still quite useful, but it
points out that 6809 code is very optimized and powerful... emulating the 09
seems to be harder than emulating other, simpler processors.

> "... emulator ... tens of times slower ..."

I would of thought that I could at least break even with a 6809 emulator
running on a 16MHz 68030.  Case in point, here is an excerpt from page 30 of
the manual for SoftPC EGA/AT for 68030 Mac's (It runs MSDOG version 3.30):

"The absolute speed of SoftPC EGA/AT depends primarily on the speed of your
Macintosh.  On the slowest SoftPC-compatible Mac, the original Mac II, the
Norton Computing Index for SoftPC EGA/AT is about two and a half times the
speed of the original PC.

On the fastest Macs, the Computing Index is about the same as that of the
original AT, or about seven times the Index of the original PC."

Who is this other guy that implemented a LII emulator?

Is he willing to share his work with others for free?

Besides, I already got a cute Icon made up for the CoCo III emulator.  I just
need to add a CODE resource to it to complete my project <grin>.

Bob Santy wrote the emulator over the last year or so...  I believe that he'll
be selling it.  It includes source for the customizable I/O section, I think
(the places where I$ and SS.calls must be translated).

I have no idea what would be involved in a Mac port of it, altho we've talked
about his porting it to say, OS-9000. (He wrote it in C, but has def'd it so
that his extensive 68K asm quick routines can be compiled instead).

I've used it at strange times:  like when I didn't have a wordcount util under
68K.  So I just used my coco "wc" util under the emulator instead. Sure, it's
slower than a 68K util, but when you want to use something in a hurry without
writing a new one, you can't beat it <grin>.  He says the 6809 C compiler even
runs under it.

As for the SoftPC comparisons.... well, remember how we all would talk about
how a 2mhz 6809 is pretty fast at many things?  We weren't kidding! And
remember that the 6809 has addressing modes even a 680x0 cpus doesn't have! 
Plus you have two separate 8-bit regs (A and B) which sometimes are
concatenated into the one 16-bit reg (D). Not to mention that it sets condition
codes on almost all instructions, which really slows down emulations.

So faking a 6809 is _much_ harder than emulating early Intel cpus. A 680x0
emulating an AT is kinda like making an adult fake babytalk: no problem. A
680x0 emulating a 6809 is like making the same adult fake teenage slang:
similar language, but sophisticated in a different way, and harder to fake ;-).

John:

I've tried my darndest to get the emulator to go faster (in pure 6809 CPU
terms) and I haven't figured out a way to do it and still have a working
program.  The emulator I have is a 6809 object code "interpreter" with an
OS9-6809 "emulator".  I use the terms individually to describe the two basic
parts of the utility because they are different conceptually.  The 6809 address
space sections (TEXT and DATA) is kind of "emulated" as well.

Here's a list of things to think about:

 o The 6809 is an 8 bit machine with no restrictions on the
   address of an object.  The 68000 is a 16 bit machine with byte
   and word object differentiation.  At any point in the
   interpreter, a memory reference to a word object can take
   place.  Therefore, all accesses to the emulated address space
   are byte wide, slowing it down.

 o As Kevin pointed out, the D register is a nasty.  I keep the A
   and B registers in global 68000 registers, but must glue them
   together every time D is referenced.

 o All 6809 registers are kept in global 68000 registers.  X and
   Y in data registers and PC, S and U in address registers.
   But, as mentioned above, stack pushes and pulls force the
   disassembly and re-assembly of the words.  The address
   registers have the added slow-down of having to be normalized
   to the 6809 64K space.

 o Perhaps the nastiest slow-down is the darned condition codes.
   The 6809 and 68000 condition codes are tantalizingly similar
   and annoyingly dis-similar.  Plus, the 6809 CC register must
   be faithfully emulated so the program dosen't fail on a
   branch.  I'm still trying to figure out how this can be
   streamlined.  For now, every instruction that can alter the CC
   register has to do it correctly according to the 6809 rules.
   Check out the differences in rotates and the lack of a 68000
   X-bit conditional branch.

I should note that the "emulator" dosen't appear to be slow if a program does a
lot of I/O.  The operating system interface (especially the I/O stuff) runs
pure 68000 code and isn't too bad.  A port to the MAC should be fairly
straightforward assuming that the MAC can support the OS9 level II system calls
needed. The current version runs on OSK and most of the calls are one to one. 
I don't know the MAC, so I can't say how easy it would be. Start by comparing
your MAC's C runtime library with OS9 level II's system calls.

Any ideas on the above would be appreciated.

Bob -

Maybe I do have an idea...

Why couldn't we build an OS9 6809 object program loader that also creates an
equivalent 680X0 phantom executable object.  This peusdo interpreter would not
need to perform any 6809 opcode fetches since it "knows" where it is at and
what it is doing at all times.

What I am proposing is a fast 6809 to 680x0 object code translater/loader that
creates a highly optimized "peusdo" interpreter for each 6809 object program it
loads.  Each 6809 opcode would be compiled into a series of 680x0 instructions
obviating the need for an opcode fetch.

This model would break down for OS9 programs with self modify code. The OS9
Debug command would not be able to set breakpoints since this phantom is
created only at program load time.  Also programs that run amuck and destroys
its own 6809 object code space will not crash this phantom.

What do you think?

John:

Such a "translator" is actually in the works here.  The problem to be solved is
not as simple as it appears.  In order to correctly translate 6809 object to
68000, the 6809 code must be interpreted and converted only when the actual
program function is verified. How many disassemblers (as good as they may be)
are actually guaranteed to produce 100% correct source?  This is my basic
problem.  I need to guarantee that the resultant 68000 code is faithful to the
original.  By the way, I can only generate 68000 code in USER mode to allow the
program to be used on a 68000.  I don't have a 68020 to test on and will leave
any optimizations available on the '20 (and '30) for later.

With the above in mind, it would be possible to generate a 68000 object that
was faithful to the original to the extent that the original was interpreted. 
One would "exercise" the 6809 object to take it through all possible paths. 
Some method would be available (a special trap) to inform the user of an
unexercised path in the 68000 executable.  Then the program would be extended
by running the interpreter again.  That's the current theory anyway.

Even with that kind of conversion working, there's still the problem of
byte/word boundries.  What if the 6809 program had a series of byte addressable
objects that were ALSO referenced by word operations as well?  This would be a
tough problem to solve although not impossible.

I disagree.  The translator I have in mind can translate 6809 object code into
680x0 code with only 4 bytes of lookahead in a single pass!  I don't care if it
is code or data as I am only concerned about constructing macro cells for each
program memory location that specifies how the state of the 6809 microprocessor
changes if the PC pointer was pointing to it (macro cells are all the same
size).  Kinda like a strip down version of the MC6809 for each memory location.

The "Fast" mode of 6809 emulation assumes that the OS9/6809 program is well
behaved (software does not generate code and execute it).  The "Slowpoke" mode
of emulation would cause the pseudo interpreter to incrementally update itself
for each memory write for complete 6809 emulation.  I believe most OS9 programs
are well behaved which makes the "Fast" mode of emulation a practical first
choice.

I will illustrate my point with a short code fragment (Assume that the cell
size is 16 bytes in this example).

 Virtual 6809 address space   |  680X0 address space
                              |                        Relative
 Location   Value  Opcode     |  6809 Macro Cell       Cell address
  $E503      86    LDA  #$43  |  "LDA #$43"            $E5030
  $E504      43               |  "COMA"                $E5040
  $E505      8B    ADDA #$53  |  "ADDA #$53"           $E5050
  $E506      53               |  "COMB"                $E5060

    .               .                   .

Note that I have generated macro cells for "COMA", and "COMB".  This ensures
that the emulator will correctly execute even if the programmer got sneaky and
jumped into the middle of a "valid" 6809 program instruction.

John:
 
I decided to check out your suggestion of using a cell approach
to translation.  The following message shows the 68000 code that
I believe is necessary for your example instruction sequence
mapped out into cells.  I'm afraid that maintenance of the 6809
CC register prohibits the use of 16 byte cells (they are too
small to accomodate the code necessary in COMA, COMB and ADDA
#$53).  These cells are full with a 32 byte size.
 
Since I have only taken the example instructions and coded them
into cells and they are relatively simple ones, I have a sinking
feeling that 32 bytes is not even enough.  They DO however
illustrate my original statement that the 6809 condition codes
must be emulated for automated translation to actually work.
 
I have not determined how the data space references would be
handled using this cell approach.  I presume that the data
references would be handled by using the first byte of each cell
to hold the 6809 data and the code in the cells would assemble
and disassemble 16 bit references to this data space.  That would
certainly add to the complexity in such cells.
 
Another troublesome issue is how this approach would handle stack
frame references.  I think that psh and pul instructions would
probably use the 68000 stack, but then what about stack offset
references?

Finally, I feel it necessary to voice a concern that I have about
the practicality of a cell approach.  16 byte cells (which most
probably cannot work at all because they are too small) would
require 1 Mb of cells for the maximum 6809 space of 64k.  The 32
byte cells that I illustrate (marginal at best) require 2 Mb.
I think that means many OS9 68000 users would not be able to use
it.
 
The example in the following message assumes the following:
 
1.   That D0 is used globally for the emulated A register.
2.   That D1 is used globally for the emulated B register.
3.   That data space for the running program is available with
     its base address in A6.  This is OS9 68000 convention.  The
     global 6809 CC register is shown as the first byte of this
     space.
4.   That several 68000 data registers are available for scratch.
     I have used D4 and D5.

Wouldn't it be possible, when translating 6809 code, to do some lookahead to
see whether an instruction is followed by other instructions that both (1)
don't depend on the current value of the condition code and (2) set the
condition code themselves, so that when translating a given instruction
preceding it, you know from context that it really doesn't have to dot the i's
and cross the t's on condition code setting?

You'll almost certainly want to do something special for the usual
implementation of the BASIC09 syscall procedure, which pushes an SWI2 on the
stack. :-) Programs that generate code on the fly, even if they do it in a
re-entrant way, are nasty for this sort of code translation!

James:
 
Well, yes.  However, I hardly think that the cell size can be
reduced to 16 bytes by such a technique.  Even if it could, a 16
byte cell would call for a 1 Mb space for the cells in a 64k
translated address space.  Just not practical.
 
My original suggestion of doing the translation by actually
running the target program emulation would seem to offer the most
opportunity for the tightest 68000 code.  The resultant code
would not be cell oriented and consequently no restrictions on
the 6809 to 68000 relationship.
 
The exercising approach would be better able to handle the
BASIC09 and other such nasties as well.  I suppose that this kind
of a translator would be able to figure out that the PC  got into
data space and complain.  I don't think that a 68020 would allow
the address space to change like that.  That would depend on the
memory management arrangement for the particular machine.  We
could probably get a 68000 to fake it.  In any event, I think a
complaint and refusal would be the way I'd go.  BASIC09 would be
un-translatable!
 
However, BASIC09 does run using the working emulator/interpreter.

Bob,

I recoded the example over again and I was able to make them fit in 16 bytes. I
made use of the following facts:

o On entry to or exit from any cell, the 68000 NZVC bits are exactly the same
as the emulated 6809 NZVC bits.

o Code that will overflow a cell is made into a template.  I can pass up to two
short words of data to a template without destroying the integrity of the NZVC
bits. I don't know how many templates I would have to make but I know that it
is less than 1500 (<grin>).

o The emulated 6809 program counter is implicit in the 68000 program counter.

The code for "adda #$53" is complex because of the H bit.  Did you take this
into account in your code?  Did I calculate it right?  The code for "coma" and
"comb" is trivial.  The code for "lda #$43" is slightly more complex because I
have to preserve the 68000 C bit.

I also included two more examples.  One is "BSR $100" and it illustrates the
absolute limits in calling a template.  It also demonstrates how the 6809 stack
frame references are emulated. The other "TFR CC,B" shows how I remap the 68000
NZVC bits into the 6809 CC register before swapping CC and B.

I concede the point that this idea is impractical on all but the largest
system.  I have an 8Mb 68030 system so this will not deter me from trying out
the idea.

The register assignment I am thinking about for my model is as follows:

    D0 emulates A register
    D1 emulates B register
    D2 emulates CC register
    D3 emulates DP register
    A0 emulates S register
    A1 emulates U register
    A2 emulates X register
    A3 emulates Y register

The following data structure emulates the 6809 address space:

        vsect
 m6809  dz.b 65536
        ends

This is the first time I have coded in 68000 assembly language so it is
definite possibility that the code fragments have some bugs.  The code fragment
follows...

But the book on SoftPC/EGA/AT fibs. On my 32Mhz '030 Mac II Norton pegs it at
only the speed of a NEC V20. (1.5x an 8088 XT @ 4.77MHz.) & Norton don't

Bill,

Those are the kind of results I would expect for a 16Mhz '030.  What kind of
accelerator are you using?

Accelerators that consist solely of a 68030 and a 32Mhz crystal only speeds up
the execution unit, bus cycle time is still 16Mhz.  Only marginal improvement.
(Maybe I am wrong?)

The 32Mhz Dove MaraThon 030 board speeds up the Mac II by a third according to
the August 1990 MacWorld review on accelerators.

Hi Bruce;

Its kind of a long story. The ramdisk software I have installed in my
system,written by Ken Drexler, would not work with the cron utility. Cron would
error out saying that it didn't see a ramdisk installed. Cron wasn't the
problem as it would work with a different ramdisk(i.e Kevin Darlings 'Rammer').
No matter what combination of boot disks I tried cron wouldn't work.I now
realize that my nil driver (being the common denominater on all boot disks)must
have been the problem for cron works fine with your VRN and nil descriptor
installed in conjunction with Ken Drexler's ramdisk.

The other problem was with a C Compiler user interface I use when playing
around with C. All temporary files and libs are used with the ramdisk. With
VDGInt, FTDD,and AGIvirq installed my source would not compile when using the
interface program. I would get a ramdisk sector error. Without the above
modules the interface works fine with the ramdisk. However with your
VRN,ftdd,vi installed I have experienced no problems with the interface program
and VDGInt in the boot disk.

I don't have any  idea why I should have had these problems.All I know is that
the problems disappeared when I installed your VRN modules. Once again thanks.

Ted,
  Very strange... I don't know why VRN should apparently work better than
NILDRV, because  never found anything really wrong with NILDRV.  It was more a
case of VRN acted like a null driver anyway, so why not make a NIL descriptor
for VRN?  However, both FTDD and AGIVIRQDr had a few things wrong with them.
But I can't see that they could cause any problems if they weren't in use, as
when you're using the C compiler.  Or do you play Leisure Suit Larry while
waiting for C compiles?  <grin>
  Perhaps its just because VRN is a littel smaller than FTDD, but does the job
of FTDD plus AGIVIRQDr plus NILDRV, and saved you a bit of system space?  I
don't know, but I'm glad it helped you out.
  Bruce

Hi Bruce;

       The nil driver software I was using was copied from the 'Complete
Rainbow guide to Os9' originally designed for a level 1 system. Maybe something
in that caused a problem although it looked so simple.When I tested it and it
worked it didn't dawn on me that it was the problem. I do have a large bootfile
(>35k) so maybe that was it.
    Also I've applied your cc3io patch for the regular hires mouse. The most
noticable difference? Before I couldn't run my terminal without losing
characters when the gshell screen was displayed on my host Coco. Now there is
no problem. Right now I'm limited to 4800 baud as I don't have the irq hack
intsalled for my terminal port. Perhaps your aciapak replacement will allow
9600 baud without the hack? Any way great work.

Ted,
  Glad you like the stuff, and thanks.  Kevins Darling's trick to improve IRQ
response was pretty slick, I think!  I'd actually done similar things in other
drivers, but it never occurred to me that it'd work in CC3IO too.

  Anybody want to help save my sanity??
I'm trying to parse out the year from an input string passed to a function,
and can't see where I'm going wrong.
 
 Sample C code :
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
print_event(Inline)
  char Inline[81];
  {
   int e_yr;
   ...
   ...
   char ev_yr[3];
   char *inptr = Inline;
   ...
   ...
p  strncpy(ev_yr,inptr + 6,2);           /* copy bytes 6 & 7 to ev_yr */
   itoa(e_yr,ev_yr,10);            /* convert int e_yr to char ev_yr base 10 */
   printf("\nEvent year = %s",ev_yr);  <=== always prints "2"
   ...
   ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 I'm using Turbo C and stepping through the code line-by-line, and still
can't see what's wrong... anybody else see the problem??
 
 BTW - Turbo C is a neato development environment - lots of on-screen help
and it's lightning FAST, but the CoCo C compiler catches some errors that
TC seems to ignore.

Off the top:

Are you REALLY passing an ARRAY of characters to the function, or did you pass
a pointer to that array? If you called the function with the name of the array,
you passed a pointer:

   char junk[81];
   gets(junk);
   do_function(junk);

.. as in this scenario. It'll also be easier to manipulate (and faster) in the
target function. I've never passed an array in TC, but don't think you CAN
under MW C.

Also - on your reference to strncpy(), you said you were copying the 6th and
7th characters... you actually started the copy at the 7th character when you
did this: strncpy(target, source+6, 2);

  Yep, commenting error on the 6/7 bytes - stepping thru the program, I can
look at the variable (or pointer + offset) and see the value at any time. Just
got thru with 2 weeks of classroom 'C' and I guess all of it hasn't sunk in
yet.  That's what I'm trying to do now, practice until I get all the 'not quite
clear' points so that I understand them.

  The name of the array is what's being passed to the function, and I'm
declaring a local pointer to the char array.

  Have any ideas on why strncpy doesn't seem to be doing it's thing?

If you're passing the NAME of the array, then that's automatically a pointer to
the array:

 saying: assuming: char myarray[81];

saying  : myarray      is the same as &myarray[0]

So, if you called a function with 'myarray like so:

  do_it(myarray);

You'd need to declare it at the receiving end like this:

  do_it(stuff)
  char *stuff;         /* myarray arrived as a pointer to the base of itself*/
       {
       char woof[3];

       strncpy(woof,myarray+5, 2);  /* grab chars 6 & 7 */
       ....
       }

I'm sure it will (become more automatic). Even with my ASM background, the
prodigous use of pointers was baffling. It became clear to me later on that if
you simply point to things, vice moving them around, things are MUCH quicker.

Probably some of the best tutorial hours I spent were staring at Carl Kreider's
code - any of it. I highly reccomend scanning the DL's (esp. the UG LIB) for
anything by Carl. He's really a wonderful programmer.

  In both cases, my strings don't get null terminated and it prints garbage
chars after them.

Jim,
     Strcat[date,'/0']; is not the way to null terminate a string.  Strcat
assumes the string pointed to by date is already null terminated.  It searches
along it until it finds a null (from the output it obviously doesn't find a
null until it's searched along several characters beyond the space set aside
for the string).  It then tacks on the second string, a null string in this
case, at that position.  To null terminate date all you need do is explicitly
assign the null: date[5]=0;

 Thanks Bruce, I've been tearing my hair out over this one.  Originally, I was
trying to use strncpy, but found a caveat that I had overlooked : "if s2 is
longIr than s1, the string is not null terminated".  Since s2 will always be
longer in my case, I thought I'd try memcpy and explicitly put a '\0' at the
end.  Never occurred to me that strcat has to find the original '\0' in order
to know where to begin concatenating!

  I'll try yours and Pete's suggestion in a bit and let you know.

 Thanks,
 ...Jim

 Maybe you can help-

#define INFILE c:\\system\\dates.fil
FILE *fp;

main(argc,argv)
{
  add_event();
  etc.
}

add_event()
{
  char outstring[80];

  etc.

  if ((fp = fopen(INFILE,"a+")) == NULL)
     fprintf(stderr,"Cannot open output file\n");
  else
     {
      if (fputs(outstring,fp) == EOF)
         fprintf(stderr,"File write failed\n");
      }
  f lose(fp);
  clearerr(fp);
  return;
}


  This code fragment doesn't want to write to the output file for some reason.

Reads work fine using the same #define for INFILE, and checking the last char
of "fputs(outstring,fp)" returns the correct char.

  I'm obviously doing something wrong, but for the life of me, can't see what
it is!  Can you give me a clue?

  Again, I missed the quotes in the translation... they're there in the source
though, and the pgm. will read from the file O.K., so I know that it's getting
expanded properly.

  Since I posted the message, I've tried 'fopen(INFILE,"a")', "a+", "at", and
"at+", all without the expected results.  Using the debugger, and watching the
HD lights, I can see that the fopen and fputs statements, as well as the fclose
statement cause some disk activity, but nothing appears in the file after the
data that's already there.  Actually, the new data doesn't appear ANYwhere! 
Oh, and using the debugger, the outstring is what it should be.
  Messing with it tonight though, I notice that the file IS being appended -
it's grown by 130+ bytes, although when I list it or look at it with an editor,
none of my fresh input is there!  Curioser && curioser by the minute!

I dl'ed and compiled it, and ran it (on instinct anyway). I think you'll be in
for a surprise...

Your added data DID make it into the file. Two gotchas:

1) The original file had a PHYSICAL control Z at the end of the data. That
means that does won't recognize any data beyond that point (I used a Unix 'vi'
editor clone on the data file, which ignores CTRL Z, to find this out). DOS no
longer requires a CTRL Z at the end of text files, so I'd remove it if I were
you.

2) Your added records (your birthday?.. hmm - you're 4 years older than Marsha)
had no EOL's on them.

I also noted you had problems with 'system(CLS)'.... why not do it the direct
way (under dos) and use 'clrscr()'.

That should get you rolling, hopefully. If not, I only did about a 5 minute
cursory scan, and may not have dug out all the nasties.

  15 mims before we have to go, so... YES!!  Never thought to use another
editor to look at the file.  Using 'WRITE' under W3.0 shows the CTL-Z. I see
what you mean about the newlines, and have added one to the end of the string
to be stored.
  However, after deleting the CTL-Z from the original file, another one seems
to have crept back in.  It's gotta be DOS that's doing this, as the file on my
CoCo has NO control chars, and I simply PCDOSed it over.  Have to think about
this a bit and do some reading in the 4.01 manual to try and get around this.

BTW, some reading this thread may wonder why I'm asking DOS type questions in
this forum.  My intent is to become familiar with and proficient enough with
the 2 OS's that I can port programs to OS-9.  I've got a wealth of DOS sourc
available at work & it'd be a shame to let them 'go to waste' <grin>.

Hmm - how are you creating the file? My autoexec.bat and config.sys files don't
have CTRL Z's in them. Are you using 'copy con: filename.ext'? Are you using
edlin? These might be culprits (dunno if EDLIN appends CTRL Z or not...I just
tried it, and it does appear to, as you have to use a CTRL Z to get out of
insert mode). Enjoy the parties... I have to go tree shopping later m'self.

 The original incarnation of the date file was PCDOS'd over from the CoCo, but
I never thought to look at it for stray control chars.  I don't _think_ that
PCDOS is doing it, but haven't checked yet.

  If I remember the sequence correctly, the first attempt at appending the file
using 'fputs'  seems to work o.k. with subsequent appends being 'invisible'. 
This is definitely on my list of things to investigate, but it'll probably be
after the holidays and the house gets put back together before I get back to
it. (Having some foundation work done, and the downstairs is all torn apart!)

I bet that this may be some remnant of MS-DOS's CP/M-like origins.  Some
utility or program on the PC side may well be padding with CTRL-Z.  CP/M, which
MS-DOS was written to sort of behave like, at least at first, couldn't tell how
long files were other than the number of 128-byte sectors they contained, so
the convention for text files came up of marking the end of the good stuff with
a CTRL-Z character.  Anything past that was junk remaining in the last 128-byte
sector of the sort that CP/M disks used.

  I think you're right on here... what had me scratching my head was the fact
that I could step through the code and "see" the fopen and fputs lines being
executed and the corresponding disk activity, yet not see anything new in the
file!  I'm having a hard enough time getting up to speed without craziness like
this!

  Anyway, fprintf seems to solve the problem for now, and I'll investigate
further after the holidaze.

Be sure to check how the file was opened (translated mode or not). In
translated mode, reads will stop when they encounter a ^Z. Similar wierdness
happens when writing. There is a global variable that you can set to specify
the default mode (translated or not). Check your compiler manual, give it a
try, and let me know.

Translated mode can cause all kinds of headaches, so I make sure to never use
it (except when it sneaks up on me ;-) )

  Do you mean the "t"ext and "b"inary modifiers to the "a"ppend, "r"ead and

Yes. In addition to opening a file +t for text mode, you can open it +b for
binary. In MSC 5.0/5.1 the default mode is t. Sooo, it will default to text
mode.

You have two choices: set the extern global _fmode to O_BINARY ("b"), I think;
OR fopen the file +b.

Give this a try and let me konw how it works.

And BTW, keep your screwdriver ready!

  Finally got the results that I was looking for by using "fprintf".  Still
don't know how those control ciars snuck in there when using "fputs".

  On another subject, have you ever investigated those C function libraries
(order now and we'll throw in the source code for only $19.95!) that you see
advertised in the back of the computer mags, or in the card packs that seem to
find their way to your mailbox after subscribing to almost any DOS mag? For
someone in my position - ie. 'greenhorn' - having libs of common functions such
as get_date(), get_phone(), or get_ssn() would save lots of time, but on the
other hand, I probably wouldn't learn anything.  Any experience with them?

  Maybe it'd be a good idea for someone to collect and AR them (I'll volunteer)
if anyone has any good generic routines they'd like to share. C'mon back?

I wouldn't say that you wouldn't learn anything - on the contrary... looking at
someone else's (good) code is often the best tutorial there is. Don't forget
that DOS mechanisms for getting date and such will be different than in os9.

The best tool for sharpening your C skills is a flat nose.. the one you get
from falling on your face from trying, and retrying to get code to compile and
work. Take it from someone who took years to break the C-phobia (83-86). There
is just no substitute for writing volumes of code.

I saw Bruce's answer - that's the crux of the problem. Strcat assumes
that the string is already null terminated (that's how it knows
where to append whatever it's appending).
 
Memcpy() is useful for raw bytes (i.e. like copying whole
structures).... strncpy or strcpy are usually fine for characters.
Also, with mem???(), I believe there's a possibility of a byte order
problem if you move between CPU families. I'm not sure of that
though...  Anyway, given your situation, here's how I might approach it:
 
** the year, and have passed it to the function.
*/
 
print_record(recptr, year)
char *record;
int year;
        {
        char date[6], name[32];
        char *evptr;
 
        date[0] = '\0';                        /* just to be sure... */
        name[0] = '\0';                        /* that they're empty */
        
        strncpy(date, recptr, 5);        /* get MM/YY */
        date[6] = '\0';                        /* null terminate it */
 
        evptr = strchr(recptr, '*');        /* find the delimiter */
        if(evptr == NULL)
                {
                fprintf(stderr,"No delimiter found in record '%s'\n", 
                    recptr);
                return(-1);                /* return error to caller */
                }
        /* This will do 2 things: a) Terminate the name field
        ** and b) bump evptr so that it points to the event.
        */
                
        *evptr++ = 0;                
        strncpy(name, recptr+8, 31);  /* copy upto 31 chars */
        name[31] = '\0';  /* just in case we truncated name */
 
        printf("Date: %s  Name: %s  Event: %s\n", date, name, evptr);

Well, we'll be going through it together.. though not at school. I'm taking

I have just taught myself (more accurate: am still teaching myself) 8086/80286
ASM, at least to the point where I can disassemble code, change it, and
reassemble to get it to do what I want. I haven't yet learned 68K ASM, but will
be shortly. It looks a LOT easier than *86 low level stuff.

Nope - I still don't have an MM/1. Sore subject.

memcpy(), unlike strcpy(), doesn't null-terminate the destination.  strcat()
wants pointers as arguments, so you needed strcat(whatever, ""), but...strcat
itself looks for a null terminator to know where to start copying, so you can't
use it to force null termination.  (Sort of a catch-NUL. :-)

Glen,

Well, here's the full scoop, and I hope you can pass it around.

Since the Atlant CoCo Fest, we have had two challenges. To ensure that our
parts list for the manufacturer was bullet-proof (one distributor sent us a
chip as an equivalent that was NOT an equivalent and gave developer machines a
tizzy until we discovered the problem!); and the FCC certification.

The MM/1 was designed from the ground up with FCC certifiable parts. This
includes ferite beads on the connectors and a bunch of attention to grounding
and so on. So the lab we used was delighted with the system and requested only
TWO small changes. First, on the case we use, there was a little paint
overspray. This is common on PC clone cases and is no doubt present on all
those PC clones you see advertized in the Shopper or other computer magazines
that are not FCC certified. Second, the keybaord connector on the front of our
machine was not grounded -- a small oversight in the integration process.

So we sent the machine back to them with these fixes -- and the machine arrived
damaged.

By the time we got all this fixed up, time had slipped by.

We hate delays, Glen. We want to ship ASAP. But it is illegal to sell a non-FCC
approved machine. It is also IMS policy to create a MAINSTREAM company with
MAINSTREAM software and a legal, regulated, certified product.

So what is the status now? FCC lab says that they'll have the lab portion done
any day now. Hooray!

And, IMS has an idea up their sleeve to get machines in your hands ASAP. It's
legal, fun, and will make thousands of OSK and future OSK folks happy.

TTFN.

It concerns FCC certification because paint overspray can insulate the pieces
of the case from one another, so that the case doesn't behave like a Faraday

The word seems to be out (at least on the Internet) that the 'up-the-sleeve'

What are the details on that plan? How much of a savings over the constructed

Mike, I'm using a Comm-4 to send serial data to my printer, but I'm not using a
Tandy-style serial interface (4-pin DIN).  The serial device that I'm sending
the data to uses a standard RS-232 interface.

In your situation, I think I'd tie the BUSY line from the printer to the DTR
line in the COMM-4 interface.

Tying it to DSR might also be an option, but I'd try DTR first.

Lee

P.S. If you use Multi-Vue (or the Hi-Res Joystick adaptor), then you might
experience some lost data when data is being sent to the printer (via the
Comm-4 port) and the mouse pointer is being moved about.

You're absolutely right about the standard Clipboard interface. I think that,
because the programmer interface is also fairly well defined, the Mac provides
a uniform and "standard" way for a user to do real work with the least amount
of thinking. Some programmers may hate the strictures, but as Quincy Jones
said, "There is no freedom without restriction".

Jack,

You are absolutely right about the Mac clone stuff. That does NOT mean that a
point-and-click environement for OSK it a bad idea -- we'll have one for the
convenience of customers because they DO save time.

Do we want to compete with Apple? Why should we? We ARE doing some multimedia
stuff, which they are, but they have a big niche, and we'll have a small one.

IMS would be tickled pink to have 1% of the total computer market, and that
won't make Apple execs lose any sleep. Remember, if we had 1%, then one out of
every 100 computers would be MM/1s, making us rich and making the software and
hardward choices for OSK even RICHER.

I DO think getting some mainstream apps to the MM/1 and OSK is mandatory,
though, and if some of these migrate, transmogrified, from t he Mac, great.

Paul, I knew that I didn't want a Mac, and certainly didn't want to have to
program one, when I read the account in Byte about how the operating system
works, and the hoops the programmer has to jump through to get anything to
work.  Basically, it's because Apple has tried to implement a sophisticated
memory management scheme, with coelescence of NON-contiguous blocks of free
memory, to support garbage collection, without hardware MMU support.  I've also
noticed that Mac programs, including expensive and popular applications, tend
to bomb a lot.

The other day on CLMFOR I picked up this tidbit:

"Apple Finder author Steve Capps created a program called Discipline, which
intercepts Mac OS calls and reports erroneous parameters.  His results were
startling: Virtually every Mac program that he tested -- including Apple's own
applications -- made serious illegal calls to the operating system."

That's enough reason for me not to want to emulate them.

On the other hand, if you want to see how program environments can be very nice
without being GUI, you need to look no farther than Turbo Pascal for the PC.

Programmers never stand still. The new generation of Mac "program" generators
take the drugery out of programming for the Mac interface, but, you are right,
the discipline is still required. One of the reasons that Mac apps make
"illegal calls" is because Apple releases so many updates. There have been 4
releases this year. The Mac OS has had twice as many OS versions in half the
time as Messy-DOS, for example. That's a heady enviornment oy!

Yes, but .... there wouldn't _BE_ such drudgery required if the OS had a better
user interface.  There's a fiction going around that the Mac system calls, as
well as those to OS/2 and Windows, are so complex because they're so powerful. 
The general idea is that the complexity is NEEDED to get all that power and all
those features.

I think that's mostly B.S.  I've heard the same statements made about IBSYS,
OS/360, and Multics.  That puts the OS in the same category as iodine or high
colonics:  It must be good for you, because it hurts so bad.  My idea of a
powerful interface is one that makes me do _LESS_ work, not more.

At a recent conference, Philippe Kahn pointed out that it takes about 500 lines
of complex code to write a "Hello, World" program for OS/2.  I was appalled
when I got the OS/2 manuals, and discovered what I had to do to use it.  Like
MacOS (or whatever it's called), OS/2 is basically an event-driven OS.  The
user program becomes a set of what are basically interrupt handlers.  The OS
drives the program, not the other way around.  For every program that's
written, the programmer must provide code to handle the events.  If someone
resizes your window, moves it, or uncovers it, then you must redraw it.  You
must handle clicks on all the gadgets like the scroll bar.

We had a long discussion about this over on CLMFOR a couple of years ago.  I
said,  "No, wait a minute!  I want the ** OS ** to take care of that for me. I
want to write to a virtual window.  It's up to the OS to take care of moving
tiles around, covering and uncovering them, and all that.

I got all kinds of arguments about why that couldn't be done, but the bottom
line was that it's too much trouble for the OS.

There's also the issue of hardware capability and size:  Several people pointed
out to me that it would take too much video RAM, and be too slow, if you tried
to store everybody's virtual screens intact.  My reaction was, "Fine.  Let me
know when the hardware's up to the job.  Otherwise don't bother me."

To be more specific about Multics (since few people are familiar with it):
Although it's the grandaddy of Unix, it represents the exact opposite
philosophy.  Whereas the Unix idea is (or at least, was) to provide lots of
small, simple utilities that you can then build on and combine to do complex
things, the Multics approach was to make every utility have as much power as
possible.  The "open file" command, for example, had some 15 arguments, most of
which were optional, and one of which served no function that any of the
Multics systems guys could remember.  The manual section for "send mail," I
recall, was 19 pages long.  I mean, how many different ways are there to send
mail???  I got that argument from all the Multicians then:  The system is so
complex because it's so powerful ... there are so many wonderful things you can
do with it, once you learn the system commands.

Baloney!  If that's so, then why can't I manage to open a file???  And why
can't someone tell me what that mysterious extra argument is for??? And why is
it that most of you systems types don't use the system at all, but write most
of your software in shell scripts???  (I even knew some that write their
programs in "editor."  The editor had such a  powerful macro language (sort of
a pre-grep) that many guys wrote their "programs" for it, only.)

Since those discussions, I've put a lot of thought into it, and I've decided
that the problem is not the OS itself, but the fact that the vendors never
finished the toolset.  They've taken what amounts to batch-oriented assemblers
and compilers, and ported them to the new environment without doing anything to
integrate them.

If they _WERE_ integrated, then I should be able to write, in the edit window
of an integrated environment,

   printf("Hello, World!\n);

and have that compile into a program that comes up in a standard window,
complete with drag, size, scroll, and kill gadgets.

Note that I didn't even write main(){ ... }.  That's as it should be, although
I wouldn't complain too much if that were required.  We can also debate whether
printf, or even the '\n', make sense in a windowed environment, but I think you
get the idea.

Now, transporting this concept to the illegal Mac system calls, it seems to me
that the problems are

(a) The tools (compiler and assembler) are not integrated into the environment,
and therefore put all the burden on the programmer, and

(b) If properly integrated, the tools should not even allow the programmer to
_GENERATE_ illegal calls.

The Mac OS *does* take care of all that for you. But applications program must
tell the OS what to do, of course. Today, all of that code is wrtten for you by
the excellent tools (program generators) that I mentioned. In your message you
used the term "user interface" when (I think) you meant programmer interface.
The Mac is user friendly & programer hostile, OS-9 is programmer friendly and
user hostile.

Yup, and I made the prediction about six years ago, when Apple first announced
they were developing a multi-tasking OS for the Mac, that they would never get
it, without requiring total rewrite of all the applications. Although they're
claiming that they're finally close, with System 7, so far my prediction is
still holding.

I agree, the Mac is far too oriented to single-user operation to be
"retrofitted" for multi-tasking. Although, in practical terms, much
multi-tasking already takes place in the Mac world. For example, I have a fax
modem on one of my Macs. Often I'll be working on some project and some one
will call with an incoming fax.

Right, we need apps.

But that doesn't mean we don't need a GUI.

I have just snagged your message, and have not studied it in detail yet, but
the first thing I'd encourage is using SEPARATE pipes for stdin and stdout... I
wouldn't open the pipe in UPDATE mode. Who is mucking with the pipe buffer's
read pointer, for instance? Is it the parent reading responses? Is it the child
reading instructions?

Kevin, this is Jim Pottage, I talked to you a while ago about a problem with my
ST125N (SCSI) hard drive. I mentioned that it would not access the drive in the
first attempt. Therefore, it would not run my startup file off the hard drive,
or boot to the hard drive. Well, after a lot of work with Ken Scales (he did
all the modifications and most of the work, I just tested the driver) Ken has a
version of CCHdisk that allows the drive to work on the first access. I believe
he has inserted a restore to track zero to accomplish this bbut for more
accurate information you could talk to Ken. Further, the driver seems to work
with the format command. I just thought I would let you know that the problem
seems to have been solved. Further, if any one else has this problem they might
try getting a hold of Ken.

Oddly, I had just run into a similar thing myself on an embedded SCSI drive,

Michael - you'll need 16 of the 256K x 1-bit dynamic RAM chips... they usually
have numbers like 41256 or anything xx256 on them.

You remove the original 4 coco ram chips, and also two capacitors nearby...
unfortunately my memory fails me as to their numbers on the coco3 board.

Guys???

Kevin:

I'm having some trouble putting togeather this HD system, I keep getting an
ERROR 246 (Device not ready). Is it possible that a bad cable will do this? I
have sent the drive and the Disto adapter back and I get the same error. I even
pulled my 3-1 board out of the controller and put the adapter in there with the
same results. What do you think?

If it might be the cable, where can I get about a three foot SCSI cable? The
one I have is one I cobbled up out of some stuff I had around here.

Lute - could be the cable, or perhaps the power supply (?).

Try this first tho: make a boot disk with H0 renamed to HD or something. Boot,
then try an "iniz /hd" and see if that works.

Or, if you're already doing this... ummm... what kind of hard disk is it? Did
it format okay using that disto rsdos program?

I found the problem, it was an addressing thing. However there is something
else you may be able to help me with.

Quite often when attempting to run Basic programs or those with basic
subroutines I get an error #43. And now that the HD is going some of the stuff
that used to work is giving it to me.

When working up a boot file for the HD I smoked the one on my previous master
disk (the one the basic stuff worked from) and don't remember what was in it.
and the backup I had doesn't seem to work.

Any ideas? Ad9 dosn't want to work and tis the season!

Cable is a prime candidate. If I recall, SCSI is simply 50 pin end-end. You
should be able to build another cheaply, or pick one up from your local
computer place for $20 or under.

I got a JDR Microdevices (or whatever it is) catalog in the mail today.  In it
I found a SCSI controller card for PClones (floppy and hard $80, hard only $50,
to one significant digit I think :-).

What I'm wondering is this: can one connect this beast to a Burke**2 interface
and, with appropriate drivers, connect SCSI stuff to one's CoCo?  The floppy
hardware is claimed to handle all the various flavors of floppy sizes up to
1.44 Mbytes.  That would be a nice setup, I think, if it could be pulled off.
Anyone know whether it's possible?

James, the SCSI adapters for clones have a driver on-board which is loaded by
BIOS at boot time. (as a BIOS extension). You could disassemble the code on a
PC & write a driver for OS-9. (you'd prolly have to disable the ROM later) The
floppy side would be easier. I bought one of those boards for $30. The one with
the floppy & SCSI was about $6 more.

Fm: Jay Truesdale 72176,3565
To: all

I am writing a program that builds a b-tree using malloc to allocate 
memory to hold a structure that is then referenced via pointers.  The 
C books I have don't cover this sort of thing, I'm trying to figure 
out the "proper" way to reference the "next" structure item via the 
pointer links.  The stucture template looks like this:  

struct b_tree_rec
{
  int key;
  struct b_tree_rec *lp;       /* Left Pointer  */
  struct b_tree_rec *rp;       /* Right Pointer */
}

In main() I declare these variables:

  struct b_tree_rec node, *root_ptr, *node_ptr;

I allocate memory to hold the root node like this:

  root_ptr = (struct b_tree_rec *) malloc(sizeof (node));
  if (root_ptr == NULL)
  {
    printf("Error number %d in allocation of root node\n", errno);
    exit(0);
  }
  root_ptr->key=0;   /* init root node contents */
  root_ptr->lp=NULL;
  root_ptr->rp=NULL;


I'm not sure why the example code I looked at casts the pointer 
returned by malloc as it did but I figure at least it provides more 
documentation as to what is doing on.  It also ocurred to me that if 
pointer arithmetic is used the compiler needs to know how big the 
pointed to object is.  Am I correct in my assumption or is there more 
to this? 

How do I reference the fields in the second node?

This fails at execution time and I think I see why:

     node_ptr->lp->lp=NULL;

This fails at compile time but I'm not sure what to try next.

     (*(node_ptr->lp))->lp=NULL;

Suggestions?  Any books that cover this sort of thing that anyone can 
recommend?

Thanks,  -J

Jay -

First of all, great questions! Now lets see if I can answer them.... The
statement where you do root_ptr = (struct b_tree_rec *) malloc(sizeof(node));
. root_ptr is declared to be of type 'struct b_tree_rec *' above... malloc is
of type 'char *'. Since a pointer to a char is a different animal than a
pointer to a 'struct b_tree_rec' (NOTE: pointer math and size of objects was
right on ethe money), then we must 'cast' or 'coerce' the source type to
produce the same type as expected by the receiving variable, in this case
rec_ptr. Some compilers will blow you out if you try to assign different types,
and some are very lax.

On the getting to the second node, I believe it'd be something like this:

 node_ptr = (struct b_tree_rec *) malloc(sizeof(node));
  ... error checking ...

 ... allocation and linking of subsequent notes ....

  /* get at left node and determine the key */

  curr_node = root_ptr->lp;
  curr_key = curr_node->key;

Hope that helps....

Pete:

Thanks for the confirmation about why I need to worry about what the pointer
points to (pointer math) and why I need to cast the pointer returned by malloc.

I think that I have to do the same cast for the same reasons to do what I
really want to do, reference down the tree.  If I want to get the key value
contained in the left node while "at" the root node then

 (root_ptr->lp)

references the pointer field in the root node which contains a pointer to the
next node.  I want to dereference this to get what this points to (the next
node).  The pointer contained in this field is of type b_tree_rec so I need to
cast the de-reference operation to the proper type???

I then can use the -> operator to retrieve the contents to the next node like
this:

         ((struct b_tree_rec *)(root_ptr->lp))->key

This appears to work as my short test program gets the results I expected. I'm
not sure why I need to cast the de-reference operation as I declared the "lp"
field as being a pointer to type b_tree_rec in the structure template
definition right before main.

Thanks in advance,

I'm not sure why you have to cast that second dereferenced pointer either..
should be implicit because of the declaration. If you DON'T, does it break? I
recall before that you were doing root_ptr->lp->key, or something like that. It
may be a precedence thing, where you need to cluster the binding that way you
want it (i.e. (root_ptr->lp)->key. Maybe that'll let you avoid the cast?

Pete:

If I use "node_ptr->rp" then this 'is' a member of the pointed to structure,
this is probably why "node_ptr->rp->rp" failed, isn't any way to get to there
from here!

'rp' is a pointer to type b_tree_rec.  To get the 'next' item in my B-Tree I
need to use the indirection operator to get to where "node_ptr->rp" points to.

If I use *(node_ptr->rp) I get an error #102 bus trap error so I assume that
I'm referencing an area in the memory map that has nothing there.  I may try
using this as an argument to printf in hex format to try and figure out what's
going on.

If I use (*)(node_ptr->rp) I get a bunch of compile errors:

 "btree.c", line 169: ****  primary expected ****
     print_tree( (*)(node_ptr->rp) );
                   ^
 "btree.c", line 169: ****  expression missing ****
     print_tree( (*)(node_ptr->rp) );
                   ^
 "btree.c", line 169: ****  not a function ****
     print_tree( (*)(node_ptr->rp) );
                   ^ errors in compilation : 3


If I cast the pointer like this "(struct b_tree_rec *)(node_ptr->rp)" it both
compiles and works.


Guess I'll go do some more reading and experimenting and see if I can figure
this one out.  (Maybe I should have purchased that "Data Structures in C" book
I saw last week...<grin>)

Jay,

What should work is: (node_ptr->rp)->rp

If rp is defined as a pointer to the structure, then you shouldn't have to cast
the "(node_ptr->rp)" part. The trick here is the parentheses not the cast, I
think. I use this all the time with OS9 LII without any problems.

I was on Delphi last night and someone said that there is a 900 number poll
line, which is asking people to vote on which operating
system is better, CoCo/RS-DOS or OS-9.  Of course, we all know the
answer to that.  The numbers on Delphi were 900 535-4900 extension 796 to vote
for OS-9 or ext 794 to vote for RS-DOS.  The rumor is that either Lonnie Falk
of Falsoft, or perhaps someone from Microware

Well...you aroused my curiosity (besides, I felt I should register my opinion)
so I called the appropriate number.  Evidently there's some outfit that runs
these polls and also does some kind of thing for people searching for hardware
(and, I guess, can't take the time to buy a magazine instead of chew up $2 per
minute on the phone... :-(.  The outfit is called something like "Mr.
Computer."

Oh, BTW...the recording said that OS-9 was ahead by 120+ votes.  OTOH, they
didn't say how many had voted altogether, and of course this "survey" suffers
from all the usual problems of self-selected surveys as well as the fact that
one can vote Chicago style (early and often) if one wants to blow the $$$.

Dear James,

I finally broke down and blew the two bucks.  OS-9 was ahead by 125
votes today, leading me to believe that the poll was updated after
you called.  BTW, for ANOTHER two bucks, I found out that the COCO
side of things was also updated.  As you say though, this is Chicago

Do you, btw, remember me?  I am a free lance writer, we have met

If they are getting rich.  I wonder if it really is Lonnie???

For you kit-builders out there, it was a very enjoyable project. As with any
Heath kit, the assembly instructions were clear and consise. The only problems
I encountered were due to my own haste.

The clock is really a combination of a clock, shortwave receiver, and
micro-computer. It picks up the signal from either WWV in Ft. Collins Colorado
or WWVH in Kauai, Hawaii which contains the time in a binary coded format. It
automatically switches between 5, 10, and 15 MHz to find the strongest signal.
A microprocessor decodes the signal and feeds it to a clock which displays the
time on the unit's LEDs.

I also purchased an option which allows one to obtain the time information from
the MAC via an RS-232 connection. I would like to read this information via
OS9. Only, I'm not sure exactly what I need to do.

The connection only uses three pins, pin 2 (Data), pin 5 (RTS), and pin 7
(GND). The clock has two modes of operation which provide the data out the Data
pin. One is "automatic". In this mode, it sends the information out the Data
pin continuously, with a 1 second pause between transmissions. The second way
to get the data is in "Request" mode. When the clock senses a "low to high
transition" on Pin 5 (Request to Send), it sends the data out the Data pin.

(continued from previous message)

My question is two pronged.

1) What would be the harm in putting the clock in auto mode, and only reading
the data occasionally when desired? I mean, is there a problem receiving data
in the port and not reading it? Does it get buffered and when I do do a read,
do I get what was buffered up first (which may not be the current time)? If so,
how would I "flush the buffer" first so I can read the next signal which will
come through?

2) If I want to use it in "Request" mode, how do I cause Pin 5 to transition
from low to high? That is, what kind of output do I write out to the device or
what kind of system call do I do to achieve this effect?

Naturally, the sample program listing in the tech ref is in MS-DOS Basic. Plus
it does things like poking hex data in hex locations on the IO buss with OUT
statements. Plus it reads the data with a similar statement, INP.

Thanks in advance for any help!

A few thoughts....

First, if XON/XOFF is turned on for that path, the buffer management code in
the serial driver will probably send an XOFF when the buffer crosses the
threshold of 10 (or whatever) characters left until buffer full occurs. Second,
it's been so long that I don't remember if overflow errors are posted for both
chip and buffer overflows.. I know they are for chip, but don't know about
buffers... Bill Dickhaus could probably help here, since he rewote ACIAPAK I
believe.

Regarding the other mode of operation, perhaps you could cross-wire that RTS
line to the CD or DSR line. These will post an interrupt, and with a little
mucking about you could service it periodically rather than have it be free
running.

It's a little confusing since the line Heath is calling RTS should probabaly be
CTS. (clear to send). Anyway, you should try tying it to DTR. (data terminal
ready). Most ACIAPAK drivers assert DTR when the driver is inized and drop it
when 'term'd. (opened and closed). So from a Basic09 program, for example, you
would do an OPEN #path,"/t2"  FOR i=1 TO xxxx  GET #path,bite where xxx is
about two "frames worth" of time data. Then CLOSE #path to shut the box down.
You wouldn't hang on the GET 'cause the box keeps sending until the CLOSE
right? Good luck & Merry Xmas.

Zack,

As long is the port isn't opened, ACIAPAK won't buffer anything. If the clock
has been sending data continously, then the first read of the port will return
an error. Subsequent reads should then get the most recent data sent by the
clock, since the serial chip doesn't buffer at all.

If you wanted to do it the other way, then you might try tying DTR (pin 20) on
the serial port to RTS on the clock. DTR changes state when the port is opened.
I can't remember, though, if RTS and DTR have the same "active' state, so this
might not work.

Paul,
   In theory, it should fly on your 1meg CC3, at least, there's nothing that
comes to mind that would prevent it.
   You should be able to use it with other computers and boards. Just remember
to toggle the ECHO if on with another computer. Also keep in mind, that since
it ONLY implements the CIS "B" protocols, that you'll be limited to terminal
mode only, unless the other side uses the "B" protocols as well.

1.2 is still rock solid, in my opinion. 1.3 added termcap stuff (which I make

Since I hardly ever venture from CIS, either would suit my needs in terms of

Reporting on the solution to a problem aired a coupla months ago-
  A null modem transfer of files to a CoCo-3 running DM-3's telecom
program was not possible using 7E1 setup.  Even tho keyboard text was ok,
apparently DM-3 does not shift to 8N1 when xmodem is initiated,     which
doesn't let xmodem begin, evidently.  Some other comm programs do change the
setup automatically, such as Ultimaterm. 
  So the moral of the story is to start both telecom programs using the 8N1
setup and xmodem transfers should go without a hitch.   -ph-

Can anyone tell me how a file is put on a disk for a Color computer under os9?
I have a arced file from the music library that consists of 36 granules. This
file is too big to use "dosor9" or others to transform a Dos format to a os9
format. I thought if I split it into 2 files and used "dosor9" to 2 different
disks and then copied them to a genuine os9 format, then I could modify the gat
tables and file ending bytes to combine into 1 file. I have done this to files
in Dos format using a disk editor. But I have never done it under os9. I have
the "zapper". Lets just say for simplicity that a disk I want to trace a file
has only a "root " directory to make things simple. Thanks, Denise PS: I only
access compuserve via Dos system because I don't have a modem pak for os9
operation.

If you split the file on the DECB side into some number of parts, then the
simplest way to get them back together on the OS-9 side would be to do
something like

merge file1 file2 file3 >bigfile

(change as appropriate for the number of parts and the names you actually do
give them).  Doing that does imply the existence of two copies of the data, at
least for a while.  Is the file big enough that two copies won't fit on one
disk?  If that's the case, and you only have one disk, then life becomes more
difficult.

On the other hand, though, I thought someone had come up with a fix for one of
the DECB->OS-9 file copy programs that had to do with files longer than 32K. 
You might look around to see whether there's a program here that does the job
and avoids the file size problem.

If getting the file split and copied over worked, you can them combine the two
with a merge command:

I have a question about buffers and C that has no doubt been asked before, and
I apologize for that.  But anyways, given the following code: main()
 {
   printf("First line");
   sleep(1);
   Circle(1,100);
   sleep(1);
 } Why does the system sleep for 1 Second, draw the Circle, sleep another
second, and THEN print "First line" right before exiting?  I gather that it
must have something to do with buffered output since if I tack a \n after
'line' things work as expected, but how can I get the code above to work the
way it would intuitively seem to?  I noticed that I could use write and it
worked alright (perhaps), except I still wouldn't know how to print formatted
output this way.
  I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who has even the slightest idea on what
exactly is going on.

If you want to avoid the "\n", try tacking an:

     fflush(stdout);

This tells the buffering logic to toss the buffer contents even though an end
of line (typical flag for dumping the buffer) hasn't been seen. If you don't
mind losing the speed advantage of buffereing, you could just unbuffer the
stream by:

   setbuf(stdout, NULL);

Nope... the only MIDI drivers are extremely primitive, and are really only
useful for output. Some applications may send clocks (such as Lyra or Umuse
under OS9), but no drivers. FYI, MIDI Clock is an $F8 byte sent out a rate
based on the song's tempo. This allows other MIDI devices (sequencers, drum
machines, etc.) to 'sync'hronize with the master device.

Page 11-70 of the OS9 System Programmer's Manual says:

  SS.FRZ

  Input:   A - Path Number
           B - SS.FRZ function code ($0A)

  Output:  None

Function:  Inhibits the reading of the identification sector (LSN0) to memory
DD.xxx variables (that define the disk formats) so non-standard disks may be
read.

Pete

P.S. May already be defined in your os9defs or OS9.H files.

I believe SS.FRZ is a single shot affair. It prevents the next would-be read of
LSN0. In that case, the time to use it is before any implicit or explicit read
of LSN0. I'd do it just after opening the path.

Pete has it.  Try a simple basic09 program which opens "/d0@"... you'll see
that the drive light doesn't come on.  Thus you have an open path. This is
exactly what format does.

Well, I finally got it to work with:
  OPEN #path,"/d0@":UPDATE But now I have two more questions.  Is it possible
to read sector 0 if the standard OS-9 info is not there?  If the pathname is
input externally, then how can one tell the difference between a name for a
floppy and a name for another type of disk. That last question assumes that the
descriptors and drivers do not have to be the standard ones.

Not sure I understand the question. If you use SS.FRZ, I believe it's your
responsibility to know what the disk's parameters are before you attempt to
read it, and set them accordingly in the path yourself (using SS.OPT).

The business about the name being external slipped right by me... care to
rephrase & reask?

If the path to be opened is not in the program but rather taken from the
command line or an input from the keyboard, then how can it be determined that
a device is definitely a floppy drive?  Reading IT.TYP is not good enough
because some devices like ram disks look like flopies.

Does Microware have any manuals that explain everything in the defs files? 
Most are obvious, but some ...

Basically, it the descriptor _says_ it's a floppy, it's a floppy. That's as
sure as you can be. What other assurances do you want/need? Of course if it HAD
to be a floppy for some obscure reason, you could write some low level nasty
code to watch the index pulse LED from the disk bus, but that's incredibly
ugly. I guess I fail to see the need? Care to explain why it's so important?
Half of the beauty of os9/unix is that all devices and files look pretty much
the same. Looks like you're trying to head the other way.

William - I think few drivers support SS.Frz, so the general answer is: it's
pretty tough to read LSN 0 of a non-os9 disk.  If you're using any of the
Santy-like floppy drivers... the disto cc3disk, bob's cc3disk, or I think
isted's cc3disk... then I believe you can use SS.Opts to set the non-OS9 disk
bit ($40) in the Typ byte of the path descriptor.

That causes those drivers to ignore LSN0, and use the defaults from the device
descriptor (actually, the defaults in the path descriptor, which were copied
from the dev desc).  - kev

I just received a letter from someone in Belgium asking about a more recent
version of XLISP that runs on the CoCo3.  He's got version 1.1 and is looking
for 1.7 or later.  Unfortunately, I didn't do the CoCo3 port of 1.1 and don't
know who did.  I would doubt that version 1.7 would fit in the 64K address
space allowed by OS-9 L2 (or is it 64K of code and 64K of data?).  So, does
anyone know of a version of LISP or Scheme that will run on a CoCo3 under OS-9
L2?

Thanks in advance, David Betz

I did the 1.1 port; I also ported 1.2.  I don't recall seeing 1.3, and I think
1.4 got too big (no separate I & D space on the 6809).  I tried SIOD, and it
runs fine on OSK but pukes immediately on my CoCo.  I really need to go ahead
and upload XLisp 1.2 here if I haven't already.

Thanks.  I figured that 1.7 wasn't going to fit.  To tell the truth, I can't
remember what the differences between 1.1 and 1.2 were.  Also, there never was
a version 1.3 released.  For some reason, I went right from 1.2 to 1.4.  I'm in
the process of porting XScheme to OSK, but I doubt it would fit into 64K on the
CoCo3.  Do you know of any commercial implementations of LISP on the CoCo?

What it means is that an application can use more that 64k. You can a
non-mapped load, which puts modules in memory, but don't link them. You can
them call them into your space when you need them. WizPro does this by keeping
16k free in its workspace, then RUNning & KILLing procedures as needed. Last
time I tallied the total program size was about 128k.

Can you use this trick to get access to more than 64K of data?  XLisp and

Kevin,

And now they're going for $10.00 at Radio Shack bargain tables!  Too bad Tandy
never decided to market FORTRAN for the Coco! :>

I was actually hoping that someone out there in OS9 land had a dormant license
that he was willing to sell me, but, I guess if it were that dormant, they
wouldn't be looking _here_.

I've heard about a small FORTRAN source for Unix, but don't know where on earth
to start looking for it (besides the Unix and Computer Language Forums).  I
have the MW C compiler (still waiting for Radio Shack to mail me my cc2 and one
pass compiler modules :>) and could give the old college try at porting it over
(no, I don't value my sanity).

On another subject, after reading the OS9 technical information section in the
Level II manual, I wondered if there might be a modified system out there
somewhere that does something besides print the "FAILED" message when system
startup doesn't go as planned--maybe a hex code saying how far along it was, or
something along those lines?  Also, it says that the kernel initializes the
system, inolving "Loading any required modules that were not loaded from the
OS-9 Boot file."  Does this mean that I could theoretically break up my boot
and put the files in the execution directory (I know this is not a good idea -
8k blocks) and that OS9 would load them for me?  Is this what happens with
grfdrv, and, if so, why can't it go into OS9Boot?  (If you hung on through this
much rambling, take a break!)

Ths again!

In the upgrade, we modified REL so that it printed a number to tell how far
you'd gotten (eg:  BOOT FAILED #9 = no shell).  That meant of course that we
also had to modify os9p1, os9p2, sysgo, and perhaps one or two others to set an
error byte before calling the D.Crash vector.  So it's not an easy patch.

You're right.. the system normally does not load any extra modules on boot. The
exceptions are that CC3Go forks shell (which gets temporarily loaded), and
CC3IO will load windint/grfint or vdgint, plus grfdrv.  But none of those are
the core kernel.

The reason grfdrv can't go in the boot, is because it must sit alone in an 8K
block.... it creates its own 64K "map" whenever it accesses the video memory
and buffers.  Actually, this isn't strictly true (it could straddle a coupla 8K
blocks), altho the upgrade sure depends upon it.  Umm, oh.. the important
reason is because it's mapped out of the main system map, into its own map. 
Putting it into the boot would use up 8K of main system space (precious!) for
no reason.  Sorry, brain foggy ;-). kev

Kev,

Thanks for that info -- I don't quite have the distinction between system and
user maps down yet, but I know that not having enough system memory can get you
into trouble.  Thus, the loading of grfdrv at the end of the boot make sense.

Looking forward to seeing that upgrade someday.  There's not too many things
more frustrating that trying to figure out what caused that Boot Failed message
(save Christmas shopping at the  Crystal Mall in Waterford, CT or figure out
what's really going on in the Gulf).

Pete,

Is there any magic to the F$CpyMem call?

I've been trying to write a basic program - using syscall - that scans memory
in search of data, make that, lost data -  when I forget to name a Dynastar
file and then back out of the program without saving the buffer.

I can get the basic program to work, sort of. But all it grabs is multiple
copies of one particular block. Or a few system blocks... When I force the
program to look for absurdly high block numbers (above 48), I catch a few more,
but they're scattered all over creation and repeat as many as 200 times.

I set D to the block number (from 0 to 48 since I have 192K), X to 0 since I
want the whole block from the beginning; Y to 4096 since I want the whole block
and U to the address of the 4K buffer I've set up in basic. Shouldn't that
work?

Wendell -  the D reg points to a DATImage... which contains the block number(s)
of a 64K (fake) map you wish to copy from.

So (thinking online here), you might set up a one-entry DATImage, and point to
that:

 DIM datimage(8):INTEGER  \ (* CoCo has 8 entries of 8K each
 datimage(0) = blocknum   \ (* first 8K = desired block
 reg.D = addr(datimage)

The offset in X would be $0000 as you surmised, and the Y copy count would be
4K for most L-II machines, or 8K for CoCos (to get entire block).

Okay, I kinda thought you weren't using a coco.

In that case, I forgot to mention that the DAT Image could have up to 16
entries composing a 64K map... the X offset would be into the entire map (of
course, you'd need to set up at least as many entries as needed to "fill up"
the area you're copying from).

I tried your suggestion. But I changed DIM datimage(8) to DIM datimage(48) - to
fit the CMS's 48 block RAM. I enter the blocks I want (by looking at Pmap or
just guessing); then, with a FOR-Next loop, the whole mess repeatedly goes to
Syscall (depending on the number of blocks) - and Voila! It works. But, don't
ask me why! It seems like smoke and mirrors.

Glad to hear it worked... but I'm leery about the datimage(48)... the datimage
max size on your system should be (16).

It has nothing to do with the total number of blocks, but the number of blocks
which can make up a 64K map, y'see.

Ummm... and it won't work anyway <grin>: your X offset can't be over 64K
anyway. Yah?   So to get at all the blocks, you have to work 64K worth at a

Kevin,
    
I now think I understand what I've done. Since the D register is
just a pointer (right?) to a memory location holding the block
number, I've set up a loop like this:
    
DIM datimage:integer
    
INPUT "Low Block number? : ",first
INPUT "High Block number? : ",last
     
FOR look=first to last
datimage=look
D=ADDR(datimage)
     
...Figure out A and B  
...Then call Syscall and print 4K block buffer to screen or file
     
NEXT look
  
My explanation is probably totally wacko, but the basic program
works! I may even write it in assembly to save a little
space and avoid overwriting any lost data.
   
Thanks again, Kevin.

Right-o. The D register is used as a pointer to the DAT Image for a fake (or
real, in some cases) 64K map.

Normally, OS9 L-II keeps a DAT Image for each process... when that proc's turn
to run comes up, its 64K "image" is swapped into the DAT hardware, so that the
process truly has a fairly normal 64K map unto itself.

In other words, the OS keeps images of many 64K "machines".  Including one for
itself (the system map, where the kernel and drivers etc sit).

Each image is composed of as many RAM blocks as required to hold the program
code and data code... up to a 64K limit.  By setting up your own image for
F$CpyMem, you've created an artificial 64K world <grin>.

For example, an image like this (for a CoCo. Your machine will have 16
entires/image, of 4K blocks each):

 0003 - data
 0004 - data
 333E - nothing here (see DAT.Free in your DEFS/systype file
 333E -  "            to see flag value for *your* machine)
 333E -  "
 333E -  "
 0010 - program
 0025 - program

shows 16K of data RAM, and 16K of program RAM, mapped in... with 32K of
"nothing" mapped in yet... where a subroutine module or data space could go. An
X offset of $C000 for F$CpyMem would grab bytes starting at block 0010.

A more common usage for F$CpyMem and DAT Images, btw, is to grab something from
another process's space.  If you get someone's process descriptor, you can
point D to his P$DATImg, and voila! you can point X to any offset within that
guy's own 64K space... and OS9 will use that offset and the image info to find
the bytes you desired.  best - kev

Evidently "Ask Mr. Computer" does update the information, because this time

     I have a 128k CoCo 3, 1 FD-502 drive, which I have had for about 3 years. 
I recently bought OS9 and am having trouble adjusting to this new environment. 
I am conversant in CoCo BASIC, IBM BASIC, and IBM DOS.  OS9 seems somewhat like
IBM DOS, with enough changes to make me think I know what I'm doing when in
reality I don't.
     My most recent problem is this:
     I went through the tedious disk-swapping using CONFIG, to create a
customized System Master, as described in the "Getting Started" section of the
manual, and created a disk with options PIPE, D040D, TERMWIN, W, W1, and FULL
command set.  Now I need to know what I will need to do in order to change the
options, without going through the immensely painful CONFIG experience again. 
For instance, I want to change the usable Windows so that I might use graphics
windows from BASIC09.  I noticed that OS9gen can redo the Boot file, but there
is a warning that this can fragment the Boot file, rendering the disk unusable.

Other questions:
     Is the disk I made with CONFIG actually double-sided?  I tried to format
it using "format '40' 2," but through trial and error I discovered that the
option "2" was not usable with the drive, as OS9 saw it at that time as a
35-trk, SS drive.  Therefore, I did a regular '40' format and proceeded to
CONFIG, telling CONFIG that I wanted D040D, in hopes that I will at least be
able to format a DS from that disk.  I don't yet know of a way to test a disk
to see if it is DS, except from regular BASIC, and since I made the disk 40-trk
BASIC wouldn't be able to use it anyway.  It does not seem likely, in
hindsight, that the disk I made is actually double sided, as only one side was
formatted.  I hope I will not have to use CONFIG again in order to make a real,
DS, "Customized System Master"!
     Can I run a pure ML program, such as my terminal (Ultimaterm v4.0) or word
processor (Simply Better v1.1) from a window so that I do not have to leave OS9
(which involves hitting Reset twice, necessitating removing the disk)?  The WP
uses a regular BASIC boot program to

You cannot run a program under OS-9 that was not written to run under OS-9, at
least not unless you go to a considerable amount of trouble modifying it, as
Chris Burke figured out how to do to the Color BASIC interpreter to get RSB.

Download the "dmode" utility from here, and use it to modify th device
descriptor for /d0 and /dd in memory to say the dt(rive is double-sided, then
try formatting a disk.

CONFIG does not change the format of the disk it writes on; so, the disk you
made is still a plain SS one.  Reboot using that disk; then xmode the window
and printer descriptors to your liking.  Format a new disk, and use COBBLER ow
it.  Copy "startup" over to the new disk.  Make a "CMDS" directory, and copy
shell and grfdrv into it(you can also copy any other commands you want).  Now
you will have a 40trk DS bootdisk.

Thanks, William, but as a complete beginner how should I xmode the windows (I

the like, but I'm not sure exactly what I should use it on in order to get the
right results.
        If I understand this, the disk I now have should allow me to format a
new disk DS.  Then, I must create a bootfile (using Cobbler, which will put the
modules I booted with onto the new disk).  Then I copy "startup," use makdir to
put CMDS on the new disk, copy "shell" & "grfdrv" (if I understand, shell is
the actuall program I talk to OS9 through, and grfdrv is necessary if I want to
enable a graphics window).  I will try these, and see what happens!

Carlyle, to be able to do a double sided format, the drive descriptor in the
boot file (d0 and ddd0) have to be the type for double sided drives. Your
bootfile has to contain the following: d0_40d.dd and ddd0_40d.dd. You might
want to use Config again to substitute these drivers in for the old ones, but
if you feel adventerous, you can use OS9gen.  It will probably be faster.  You
need to "build" a file called bootfile containing all the modules that you want
in your system(you can find all the modules in the Modules directory of the
config disk).  Some modules that you have to include are: init, ioman, rbf.mn,
cc3disk, d0_40d.dd, ddd0_40d.dd, scf.mn, cc3io, term_win.dt, clock.60hz, cc3go,
w.dt, w1.dt, vdgint.io, grfint.io. Once the file is made "chd /d0/Modules" and
"chx /d0/cmds" for single drive: os9gen /d0 -s </d0/bootlist. Remember that the
bootlist must be in /d0.        Have fun, Dave.

Oops, some clarifications....you have to put this boot on a 35 track disk and
then make a startup file and put shell and grfdrive in CMDS along with whatever
other commands you want.  Then you can format a disk for 40 ds. The disk you
format (format /d0) will have a double sided format.  Then, load "cobbler" into
memory. Then, put your newly formated disk into your drive and do "cobbler
/d0".  Now you have a bootable 40 trk doublesided disk(don't forget to put
startup on it as well as put shell and grfdrive in the Cmds dir).

  If you have specific needs, ask and someone will remember where that 'just

  Oh, yeah, you asked about xmode'ing windows - that's what Bruce's WINVDG does
- it sets all the descriptors that you will EVER need, from w1 - w14 and v1 -
v7.  There's also a WMODE.AR that'll let you modify descriptors in real time

 Any way, even got Tony D. into the problem but still nothing.
 Finally this evening after months of runnning in the sleep mod tried something

Ken,
   It's known as the BLOB....the Boot List Order Bug. It's not a definable bug,
with a known fix, but you did what many others have done...play with it until
it works. I think Kevin Darling placed a file in LIB 10 that discusses the BLOB
in better detail.

Sb: #malloc() problem
Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

Does anyone know of any problems with the malloc() C function. I'm finding that
my data (saved in a malloc()ed buffer) is corrupted from time to time. I
suspect a wild pointer in MY code, but I thought I'd check since I can't find
the problem here. Also, I noticed that memory returned with free() does not
seem to get reused unless the request size is identical to the original. Is
there a fix for this? Or does it clear up when there is no more easy memory
available?

BTW, this question concerns the 6809 C compiler using the Krieder library, but
since I hope to port the code to 68K any comments in that area will also be
appreciated.

Hi Bruce. A couple days ago Frank Hog Labs. informed me that my Eliminator

forum what the result of your investigation is, and also could you tell me what
if any other then the WD1002-05 might be an alternative controller to be used
with the Eliminator. It seems my controller crapped out at the same time that
the Eiminator decided to quit. It might be a case one causing the other to go
haywire, but if so I will have to replace the controller, and Frank tells me he
does not have access to the WD1002-05 any longer. So what next to do.

Mike - I'd think that MW support would apply only to the companies buying the
licenses... not to the end customers buying machines that come with OS-9.

This seems natural to me.  If a company licensed OS9 for a MIDI controller, for
example, I'd expect that they got the support... but not everyone who buys the
controller! <grin>

So you'd pass on any Q's etc to the dealer you got OS9 from, and they'd in turn
help you or ask MW.  Seem reasonable?  best - kev

use a utility, such as the recommended DMODE.AR, once I've downloaded it?
 Would running my term (Ultimaterm v4.0, pure ML) from a window help, and if so
how do I manage this?
   Is there a text file in a Lib that would explain all this to me?  If so,
point me at it and I'll grab it and chew on it for a while.

Carlyle -

There's a program and documentation in DL10 called DOSOR9.BAS and DOSOR9.DOC.
Grab these, and save them to an RS-DOS diskette. These will allow you to make
an RSDOS diskette readable to OS9. That's one way you can move files over
there.

Another way is to use an OS9 terminal program. You'll NEED a serial port (not
the one in the back of the machine, but a real one like an RS-232 pak, or one
of the 3rd party versions), but it's worth it. Sterm for os9 supports ASCII,
XModem, and B+ protocols, and is the terminal program of choice for os9
Compuserve folks. Sterm and goodies are in DL7.

Fm: Zack Sessions 76407,1524
To: ALL

I really don't have time to disassemble WindInt to figure this out,
so if someone familiar with it or with this particular question, I would
appreciate some input.

Basically, what determines which palette slot(s) govern the color of
an autofollow mouse cursor?

What I know is that, the color of the mouse can't stay the same palette
all the time. What if it is moved to an area which is completely filled
by that palette? It would disappear! So WindInt (or somebody) can change
the palette of any part of an autofollow mouse cursor (and does!) as it
chooses. Just how does "it chooses"?

TIA,
Zack Sessions

Fm: Kevin Darling (UG Pres) 76703,4227
To: Zack Sessions 76407,1524 (X)

Zack - the cursor is simply an XOR of the bits on the screen.  Thus the color
depends upon the background, and the palette slot the data XORs out to. 
Nothing fancier than that.

In other words, if your cursor is over a background of palette 0 in a 4-color
screen, then the bits become palette 3.

Of course, if both palettes 0 and 3 are say, white... then you get no visible
cursor <grin>.  Which usually is no concern except in gfx paint programs. Which
is why old Max9 had two-color cursors, so that your chances increased for being
able to see the thing on most pictures.  (the two colors were done by creating
put buffers with mixed bits in them... I guess that wouldn't work ... ummm yes
it should work for autofollow too, i think).

        Kevin,
        What if you want ot change the cursor to an underscore. Thats what it
is in school on the Vax and I always like my CoCo to be more like the Vax and
the Vax to be more like my CoCo. I've always wandered if there was a way to
change it. Could you change like you can change mouse pointers or something. Is
it mapped in w/ the fonts as a character or is it in CC3io itself? Is there a
way to change the pattern of the cursor? Is there anything about this in Inside
OS9? I didn't see it so thats why I'm wondering. Its a good book though. Lots
info.

Well, I was about to say "sure, piece of cake"... until I looked at that part
of Grfdrv... and it's not just a matter of changing something in place, as I'd
hoped.

Ummm. It's a not a char in the font, no.  The text cursor routine reverses the
attributes on a rom-text screen, and does an XOR of the whole char area on a
gfx-screen... using the normal charput routines instead of a special routine...
making it harder to just patch in place.  (note: they partly did it this way
because the cursor also had to handle proportional text, too - tough one).

To: All


    Anyone was able to boot OS-9/ST v2.3 on the 68030 32 MHz equiped Atari TT?
On the 4M bytes model that I've tried, the TT crashs after STARTFD.PRG prompts
for "Insert OS9 Boot diskette and Press a key" a soon I touch the keyboard. Too
bad, the computer is very very fast and seems to be nice. No improvments even
if I ask for a ST compatible mode instead of the default TT mode. Maybe I
should try with older version of OSK, 2.2 or 1.2. But I don't think it will
help. Anyway, even if it works, drivers will have to be written for the
additional ports, like the two serial 85C30 SDLC ports, the 68882, the VME bus,
the SCSI connector, the LAN outlet, etc.

   Also the MS-DOS emulator PC-DITTO (software version) does not work. Others
TOS programs that were in the store (Calamus, etc) seems to work OK.

    Hi, Kevin.


      Yes, I'm from Montreal. The TT computers can be seen here since around
early September in computers shows, but is available on market since this
month.


    In recent european magazines, Atari TT article reviews specified the
following hardware as standard in a plain TT computer:

 - 68030-33 used at 32MHz
 - 68882-33 used also at 32MHz
 - 8M bytes of RAM divided in two banks:
     - 4M bytes of ST compatible RAM, 80 nsec, 64 bits wide
     - 4M bytes of TT RAM, 100 nsec, 32 bits wide
 - TOS 3.0.1 (512K bytes of ROM)
 - 128K cartridge port, ST compatible
 - graphics resolution same as ST plus (palette of 4096 colors):
     - 320 X 480, 256 colors
     - 640 X 480, 16 colors
     - 1280 X 960 (monochrome)
 - 2 stereo RCA ports
 - internal speaker
 - 2 MIDI ports, ST compatible (ACIA6850)
 - 4 serials ports:
     - 2 RS232 ports, MFP68901 (ST compatible)
     - 2 85C30 hi-speed SDLC ports
 - one network LAN port, LocalTalk compatible
 - one DMA ACSI port ST compatible
 - one DMA SCSI port
 - one internal SCSI 48M bytes hard disk, 28 msec
 - one 3.5" drive, 720K bytes, ST compatible
 - one external floppy port
 - one VME A24/D16 connector
 - one MC146818 real time clock


    Too bad they don't have a 1.44 3.5" drive. To have more or less memory
means a special configuration for this computer (like the one I saw in store
with 4M bytes of RAM). In reviews, speed gain over a standard ST computer
varies from 200% to 9786%, depending of the application.

    ATX, an UNIX System V release 4 with X Windows, OSF Motif and so on, is due
in March 91. But then a 80M bytes hard disk and more memory will be necessary.


     I had the idea that a 68030 CPU can emulate a 68000 CPU without problems.
Thanks for the note.

Merry Christmas.

Denis - the 030 is compatible with the 000, but only from the user program side
of things.  A few system-state things change tho, from model to model. In other
words, a few sections of the kernel have to be changed, but otherwise
everything else would run just fine (apps, even drivers I'd think).

They (Motorola) figured that having to change the OS slightly was okay, as long
as user programs were still compatible.  I think they were right, because you'd
want to take advantage of new features in the kernel if possible, anyway.  best

     Also, of course, about the list of equipment on the TT: 1 Centronics
parallel port and joystick/mouse port. There is room for 26M bytes of RAM. The
LAN, SCSI and ACSI ports work in true DMA mode. There is also a connector where
you can plug a ST compatible hard disk, in addition to the ACSI port which is
already a DMA ST compatible port.

Fm: Jack Crenshaw 72325,1327
To: All

For some time now I've been tinkering with the idea of writing an assembler for
the 68000.  I'm using SK*DOS, which doesn't currently have a relocating
assembler, and we need one.  I'm also adding a disassembler to my hex debugger.

I've made several stabs at it, but I keep getting bogged down in complexity,
and I finally figured out the reason:  68000 assembly language is _AWFUL_!

Never mind the complexities in the hardware, or the fact that, having set
themselves a goal of an orthogonal instruction set, Motorola then set out to
introduce all kinds of bizarre non-orthogonalities.  That's in the hardware,
and there's nothing we can do about that.

Let's just concentrate on the assembler language.  I finally realized (I'm a
little slow, sometimes) that part of my problem is that the mnemonics are
inconsistent and irrational.  For one thing, there are cases such as ADD, and
ADDA where they chose to use separate mnemonics for what is essentially the
same instruction (with the same opcode).  [ I know, I know ... most assemblers
allow ADD for ADDA, but they still have to support both.]

Then, on the other hand, there are cases like ASL in which the same mnemonic
refers to completely different instructions, with vastly different opcodes and
argument encoding, depending upon whether we're shifting a register or a memory
word.

Worse yet, though, is the syntax of the arguments.  Consider the two
instructions

       MOVE -(A0),D0 and    MOVE -(A06 + (4 * D05)/2)(A0,D0),D0

Both of these areperfectly valid instructions, assuming the labels A06 and D05
are defined somewhere.  But, of course, the encoding of the instructions are
completely different.  And a parser, scanning from left to right, can't tell
which kind of instruction it's dealing with until it gets to the fifth
character of the first operand.  In other words, a predictive parse is not
possible without some prefiltering by the lexical scanner.

This is the same problem as the old FORTRAN problem, often given as this
example:

       DO 10 I=1.5

which is an assignment to the variable DO10I, but the compiler doesn't know
that until it sees the '.'.   After all these years, you'd think that we
wouldn't fall into that trap again!

I finally figured out how other folks do it:  They keep a set of legal argument
strings around (things like "-(A0)", '-(A1)", etc.) and compare the whole
argument string with them, looking for the special cases. If nothing matches
the "canned arguments, then they assume it's an expression.  Even then, the
argument could be:

Now, here's the proposition:  Is anyone besides me interested in defining a
better syntax?  I figure, as long as I'm writing an assembler, why not choose
the syntax to be easier, both to code in and to assemble?

I have two alternatives:

(1)  Pick a new set of mnemonics, and a new syntax for arguments, that's
parsible by a simple predictive parser.  Make it as rational as possible, and
use different mnemonics where different operations are implied.

or (2) While I'm at it, make the language more like a high-order language. In
other words, instead of

       MOVE X(PC),D0               D0 = X
       ADD Y(PC),D0        use     D0 += Y  (or perhaps just D0 + Y)
       JSR FOOBAR                  CALL FOOBAR

I'd appreciate comments/ideas/criticisms. Anyone want to help define such a
language?  Anyone have any better ideas?  Anyone out there who _DOESN'T_ think
I'm crazy?

The C Users Group has a 68000 assembler written in C (CUG disk #190), with C
source code included.  I think they get $5.00/disk?  I suggest picking up a
copy of the "C Users Journal" at your local book store (I found it at a

Jay, looking back on it I realize I gave you a rather short answer, and one
that perhaps needs some elaboration.  I have two goals:

(1) Get a relocating assembler/linker combo

(2) Define a "more rational" assembly language, preferably one that looks more
like a high-order language.

I'd _LIKE_ to be able to get both in one shot, but there's no law that says I
_HAVE_ to do it that way.  As a matter of fact, I'm sure that there will be
people who'll prefer the conventional assembler anyway.

So the right answer should probably be: Yes, the CUG assembler may well meet
need #1.  All I'd have to do there is change the object-file format. If I still
want the other thing, I could then write it using the same format.  The same
linker would work for both, of course.

BTW, I came from the CP/M world, and there I had the world's best
assembler-language tools:  The assembler/linker/librarian from SLR.  I learned
one thing from Steve Russell, which is that the tools work much better, and are
even easier to build, when they're tightly integrated together.  Logical
extension:  Build a conventional assembler with good linker & librarian first,
then add a HOL-like assembler, and possibly a HOL compiler, all integrated
together.  Thanks for steering my thoughts in that direction.

Hi Jack!

Yeah - You're crazy --- crazy like a fox!!  And you're a rabble rouser, too
:-).

I'm all for your idea of a _new_ approach to designing an assembler and I like
the idea of a high-order language.  I suppose the current mnemonics are a carry
over from the days when memory was scarce and expensive.

So many ideas come to mind - I could easily spec out a monster!  Let me throw
some of these out so you can shoot them down.

Could the new assembler be a combination interpreter/assembler?  In other
words, could an assembler be designed to permit testing the code prior to
assembling?  This, coupled with sensible syntax, could allow concentrating on
the objectives of the program rather than the details of the code. Why not a
generic assembler?  Maybe it could cover the 680x0 series and the xxx86 series
chips.  I've noticed when coverting 86 code to 68 code, certain sequences can
be automatically converted - and if I knew more, I would've set up macros. 
Can't the assembler do this by telling it what chip you're writing for?  Could
the assembler do automatic register selection?  Tell the assembler what
registers are reserved (for system, etc.) and then let the assembler select the
registers - would probably require the assembler to automatically set-up data
areas, but so what.

I can go on but I better shut-up.  In any event I'd certainly be happy to help
you in any way I can (don't know the first thing about writing an assembler -
but I'm a terrific kibitzer)!

Good Luck,

Ed, one of the interesting things about the software business is what creatures
of habit we are.  For people who claim to be creative, it's amazing how much we
stick to the "tried and true."  Look at the following code:

       foobar: move x(pc),d0
               move y(pc),d0
               bge next
               subq #1,d1
               dbra foobar
       next:   ...

Not everyone would recognize the particular machine this is for, but almost
EVERYONE would agree that this looks like assembler language.  The layout:
Labels starting in column 1, three or four-letter mnemonics, followed by
arguments ... dates from the original assembler, SAP, for the IBM 650 circa
1952.  We've been using it ever since.  I've never understood why people pick
mnemonics like JSR or BRA when there are perfectly good words (CALL and GOTO)
already in use.

Some years ago I set out to define a "rational" assembler language for the
8080.  A few examples are show below

       MOV A,B          -->     A=B
       ADD A,B          -->     A+B
       CALL FOO         -->     CALL FOO   { That's one Intel got RIGHT!)
       JNZ  BAR         -->     IF !0 BAR

I was real pleased with the language, but at that time I didn't know enough
about how to build an assembler to implement it.  Now I do.

Unfortunately, the technology keeps passing me by.  By the time I had the 8080
syntax defined, along came the Z80, with extra addressing modes and
instructions.  By the time I got those figured out, I was suddenly in the 68000
business.  Gotta learn to work faster!

When I first started programming for the 68000, I had a real problem with some
of the branch instructions.  Like DBcc, for example, NEVER seems to do what the
instruction seems to say.  So I wrote a structured preprocessor for the
assembler.  I had constructs like IF..THEN..ELSE..ENDIF, WHILE..ENDWHILE,  and
FOR.. ENDFOR. I wrote a prototype in Turbo Pascal for my PC, and it worked like
a champ.  I was truly surprised at how easy it is. Never implemented it for
SK*DOS (early on, the development tools weren't up to the task), but it's still
in my job jar.

I don't need help building the assembler.  What I _COULD_ use lots of help on
is defining the language.  More on this in the next message:

The first decision is:  Do I keep the conventional format (label, mnemonic,
operands) ... in other words, try to remain as faithful to convention as
possible, or do I go for the A=B approach?

The next decision is:  How to handle all the addressing modes, sizes, etc.

Either way I go, I obviously have to allow for the generation of any
instruction that the normal assembler provides.

The size parameters give me fits, too.  I'm sorta toying with the idea of a
size declaration.  In other words, you could declare D0, say, to be size byte. 
From then on, until you redeclare it, every reference to D0  would produce a
byte instruction.  Saves all the '.B's.

A little history: Several people have tried to do similar things with
assemblers.  One notable is by Ed Ream, author of the editor "red."  He came up
with a unique approach, which was to make the assembler look like legal K & R
C.  In other words, expressions like
       d0 += d1; are perfectly legal C expressions.  In fact, Ed's anguage was
such a proper subset of C that it would compile under a C compiler (with the
identifiers d0, d1, ... d7, a0, a1, ... a7, etc. just compiled as normal
variables. (Not sure how Ed handled the size issue.  Maybe I'd best go back and
take another look.)

Only one problem:  The assembler ran slower than Christmas, and some of the
constructs were pretty weird.

Another fellow did the same thing for the Z-80 ... using C-like constructs. His
program was really just a preprocessor, and also too slow to be much use.  But
the worst problem was some of the instructions.  For example, the Z-80 LDIR
(load, increment, and repeat) instruction translated to the following C code:

       while(bc--){*de++=*hl++)

Frankly, it's a lot easier for me just to type LDIR!

I concluded from all this that it's a bad idea to try to warp the assembler to
fit an existing language like C.  Better to start with a clean slate. (one more
message, I promise)

I've identified three main kinds of instructions:

(1)  The binary instructions, like   D0 = X or D0 + D1.  If someone _REALLY_
wants to keep a C-like syntax, I'll settle for D0 += D1, but I sort of like the
stark simplicity of the first form.

(2)  The unary operators, like not ( !D0), negate (-D0), and shifts ( >>D0 or
<< D0, 4 )

(3)  Things like LDIR that are better left as mnemonics.  It's best to think of
these as "built-in function calls."

Whichever approach I take (modified traditional, or C-like), it's important
that the syntax be written so it can be handled by a predictive parser. That
simply means that when you see a certain character (or, more generally, a
token) you always know what to do.  That, in turn, means that constructs like
-(A0), which starts out looking like an expression, are N.G.

Hope this stimulates some thought & discussion.  I'll build the assembler if
(a) Anyone cares, and (b) we can agree on what should be built.

I've gotten one mail message so far that said don't do anything.  That may be
the consensus, but for those who are concerned about compatibility, I'd like to
point out:  A screen editor like Brief, with good global substitution
facilities, can take care of different notations pretty quickly.

Jack, 
Since this is the OS-9 Forum I have a question.  In your first message you said 
that you wanted to develop a relocatable assembler fo SK*DOS; do you want to 
write a normal assembler, or do you want reentrant PIC?  If you only want 
normal code we can fix that later 8-).
 
As you know, the reason that new assemblers still use mnemonics like BRA is 
compatability with existing code.  If you want that then you can write your 
assembler the same way.  If you do not care about that, then why not go all the 
way -- natural language interpretation.  How about a program written like this:
 
* This is a menu subroutine
window  load data register 0 with the screen width
        subtract 1 from data register 0
......
 
Notice how the code is self documenting and MUST do what is says it will do. 
In order to easily handle things like expressions, the assembler should RUN in 
a high level language.  Any variables used should also automatically be placed 
in the data area -- we don't want self-modifying code do we.

Some of the high level features mentioned are found in Forth assemblers(with 
are really cross assemblers even if running on the native chip).  Forth 
assemblers also compile code WHILE it is being written, which would allow the 
programmer to immediately be given the clock cycles for a routine.  Also, 
macros and the high level functions of the language can easily be used in such 
an assembler.
** To be fair Forth is not the only language with these capabilities, just the 
most visible.
 
The the only disadvantage of a natural language assembly interpreter I see is 
the amount of work needed to write it.

William, I'm only just getting started in OS9, and my "baseline" system is
SK*DOS, until something better comes along.  I posted the message here because,
OS9 or no OS9, this is the only forum where people talk much about 68000's.

Re the PIC:  That would be best.  SK*DOS (and OS9) requires it.  Which sort of
means that the assembler shouldn't make you do anything special to get it. 
There _ARE_ some implementation issues that I haven't worked out yet. Example: 
You can address variables PC-relative, but then if you're using OS9 you can
also address them base A6.  Since the fundamental nature of the assembler is to
let the programmer do anything the chip will support, I suppose that you can't
assume anything, or impose any coding style.  Still, there should be some easy
way to tell the assembler what you want, instead of having to write things like
foo-base(a6) all the time.  I've thought of having pseudo-ops something like

       BASE A6 = OFFSET
       BASE PC
   or  BASE ABSOLUTE

so that once declared, you could reference data from that base.  (Don't know
WHAT you do if you need more than one!)  As for control references, I'd like to
see BRA's and BSR's generated by default, with some kind of mechanism for
dealing with things out of range and/or external.

Re "natural" language:  BAD IDEA!  The last time someone tried that, the result
was COBOL.  Technically, a roaring success since it's still the most common
programming language in use today, but from a computer science (or
productivity) point of view, a terrible disaster that has cost us megabucks. I
don't think there's a language expert alive that wants to see _THAT_ experiment

Re:base addresses & assembler assumptions
Why not use command line directives to tell the assembler what mode it is in? 
Some existing assembler have Motorola or OS-9 modes, and others have 68000 or 
68020 modes that are switched from the command line.
 
Re:natural language
I did not mean to try to include everything & the kitchen sink, as COBOL does. 
Only machine language and a method of accessing system calls should be in the 
assembly language.  Only two major changes would be necessary to make the 
assembly language look like "natural" language:(1) expanding the mnemonics to 
the words they represent, and (2) automatic definition of variables with their 
use.  It is obvious from XREF type programs that computers can handle variable 
definition better after they have been used.  The syntax for "natural" language 
would be almost identical to normal assembly language.

William, thanks for the inputs.  I'll have to go off and think about them.

I have no problem with specifying the addressing modes in the command line
(although it would also be nice to be able to do so as program commands. What I
was thinking about was cases where the declaration might change. Example: 
Instead of having to say MOVE.B, MOVE.W, or MOVE.L all the time, you'd just
tell the assembler "Register D0 is supposed to hold a byte." From then on, all
references to D0 would be .B, until you tell it something different.

Even nicer might be to assign variable names to the registers.  Sort of like
the register option of C, but you'd have to do it manually instead of letting
the compiler do it automatically.

One thing I have to be careful about here:  If you go overboard with this
thing, the assembler turns out to be MUCH harder to build than a compiler. You
have all the complexity of a compiler, plus:

 (1) You have to support EVERY machine language instruction, where the compiler
can use only a subset

 (2) There are many more restrictions and special cases imposed by the
hardware, where the compiler can use a syntax that's more general.

I want to have a nice tool, but I'd rather not make it my life's work!

But yes, being able to assign a name to a register in sections of the source
would be nice.... a friend and I were just talking about wanting this the other
day.

We had a routine using a bunch of the 68K registers, and even with comments, it
got tough to follow which reg was which (and woe if you change some! ;-).

Kev, I remember a project at work on the Z8000, which has 16 general-purpose
registers.  The program had to be super fast ... among other things, it had to
compute one sine, one cosine, an arctan, and a square root, in a millisecond.  
So I had to write almost all in-line code, and keep everything possible in
registers.   What an ordeal!  Basically, I was doing global register
optimization by hand.  Had to keep a map of what was in each register, and
deciding where to put the next item was like working out a chinese puzzle.  It
sure would have been nice for me to have been able to identify the registers by
their contents, too.

Which brings me to a thought:  You'd need error messages to tell you when
something's been overlaid, wouldn't you?

Well, I guess that would be taken care of by the assembler:  If you declare a
variable x to be in D0, and then later declare it to be y, the assembler must
remove x from the symbol table.  Unless, of course, you redeclare it as RAM.

Hm.  Have to think about implementation on that one.  I'd been thinking of a
syntax something like

   assign x to d0
   .
   .
   release d0

Perhaps I could set it up so that if there is an assignment x=d0 somewhere in
between, x would be automatically set to refer to the RAM variable rather than
the register.  Sounds feasible.

Re:MOVE
I don't think there is much that can be assumed without making some programs 
difficult or impossible to write.  The only place where it would be "safe" to 
assume size would be when a variable of a specific size is accessed.  It would 
also be nice to be able to give the registers names; even a, b, c, is better 
than 0, 1, 2.
 
On another note, I assume that you are writing a two-pass assembler, but are 
you making it a macro assembler?  If so, then are you going to put the code 
in-line or in subroutines?

William, whether it's one- or two-pass is an implementation issue. Shouldn't
affect the appearance to the user either way.  Actually, I'll probably use a
one-pass with backpatching, but the first iteration may be two-pass.

Yes, might as well support macros.  As long as I'm doing it, best to do it
right.  Macros are _ALWAYS_ supported as in-line code, by definition.

Re:two-pass
Actually the user would see it if the assembler has an "ifp1" type directive, 
but I suppose you will just fake that on INCLUDEs.  I would also think that 
resolving variables would be more difficult if you want a separate data area.
 
Re:macros
Macros have always been supported as in-line code in normal assemblers.  It is 
possible for TIL assemblers to put an equivalent subroutine call in-line.

Ok on the defs, William.  I understand the definition of the ifp1 keyword, but
can imagine no earthly reason why one would want to use it.  I' having a hard
time imagining how a program, written in any programming language, could be or
should be tangled up with the way the translator was implemented.  Do you find
it useful?

Re TIL:  Again, I understand.  I used to be something of a fan of FORTH, so I
can dig the concept.  The idea of putting subroutines in line, though, doesn't
fit very well with the idea of an assembler.  In the latter, the whole point
would seem to be to do the absolute minimum kinds of transformations to the
language.  It's just a one-for-one translation from mnemonics to machine codes.

Jack,

The best use of "ifp1" is when you have big include files that define labels
(like skequate.lib) but don't generate code.  Makes assembly a tad faster.

    ifp1
   lib skequate
   endif

That's about it.

You should have your assembler accept Motorola's defined syntax without any
changes, no matter what else it does to extend the assembler language. If you
ever saw Grappel's and Hemenway's STRUBAL+ for the 6800 (yep, two naughts),
you'd see what I was thinking about.  The compiler recognized both 6800
assembler and a structured basic language.  It was a one-pass basic compiler
and a two-pass assembler that emitted a relocatble object file that you could
link with other modules.  The implementation was a dog, but the idea was a good
one.

*
    GETAD IADD=I

I like it, Bud ... not the syntax, but the idea.  The reason I asked was that I
was prepared to say that I'd rather have a separate compiler and assembler. 
But if you can mix the two languages in one program, so much the better.

I started down this road by writing a preprocessor for 68000 assembler
language.   I did this mainly because I found the 68K control constructs,
branches, etc., too confusing.  Every time I use DBcc, I have to think about it
and hand-execute it, and I _STILL_ tend to get it backwards.  So I decided to
add Pascal-like control constructs.  I had

 IF-ELSE-ENDIF
 WHILE-ENDWHILE
 LOOP-ENDLOOP
 DO-ENDDO (uses DBcc)
 BREAK

For the conditions, I replaced the 68000 CC's by things like =, !=, <= ,etc.
Carry clear was !cy, etc.

It worked out really nicely, and turned out to be easy to write.  Natch, all
control constructs were nestable to any depth.  Any other instructions besides
the control constructs just pass right through to the assembler.

I could play around with something like this.  I've toyed with the idea of
extending the HOL-like constructs.  By that I mean that, if a MOVE X(PC),D0
gets translated as d0=x, then it's a small matter to let more complex
expressions like  x = y + z/2 be generated, too.

I have mixed emotions about this, though.  For one thing, if the idea of an
assembler is to produce a 1-to-1 correspondence between source code and object
code, this is violated if you allow expressions.  Not only that, but it might
not be immediately obvious that multiple instructions are going to be
generated.  And it would take someone who _REALLY_ knows assembler language to
know when one instruction will be generated, and when it can't be.  It seems
that if the "compiler" is going to expand the code and produce what is surely
likely to be more inefficient code than the programmer can do, you should at
least give him some warning message that you've done the expansion.

Too, once you get into general assignment statements, you have to use some
intermediate storage .. either register, stack, or memory.  And this might walk
over the programmer's plans for register assignments.

Finally, it's HARD!  It turns out to be a lot more difficult to write a
HOL-like assembler than a HOL compiler, itself.  The reason in that the
compiler writer can make his own decisions as to register assignments,
parameter-passing conventions, etc., and enforce them autocratically.  With a
"pseudo-assembler," you have to honor the programmer's choices. Also, the
compiler author is allowed to use a subset of the CPU instruction set, while
the assembler writer must support them all.

All of this touches on some very deep issues of philosophy, about which I have
some rather firm convictions (surprise!)

First of all, I like to program in assembly language.  Despite the general
feeling that it's a MUCH more difficult medium to program in, I find that it's
not that much harder than a HOL, _IF_ you have good tools (including macro
facilities), a well-equipped subroutine library, and some well-defined
conventions for things like parameter passing.  With my preprocessor, you get a
lot of the advantages of a HOL with no loss in efficiency.

On the other hand, I've also become convinced, by personal experience, that
writing a full-blown compiler is also very easy, _IF_ you don't care much about
the quality of the code output.

The trick is to combine both ideas into one program.  The ideal language would
be one in which you could write either way:  Quick and dirty programs in a
BASIC-like language, and to heck with tight code, or carefully tailored code
approaching or equalling the efficiency of assembler, for those cases where
it's needed.  But writing a single language capable of doing this would seem to
be a big challenge.  Certainly it's one that people like Kernighan or Wirth
haven't tried to tackle.

Rather than trying to bite that huge bullet in one swallow, I'd prefer to start
with something more modest and sneak up on the rest.

Hi Jack!

First, you have my vote for a new assembler.

A little background - I probably spend about half of my time programming or
reviewing/testing programs written by others.  Most of this is with data-base
languages.  Occassionally, I have to get into C and/or Assembler.  While I
don't employ full-time programmers, I do employ several part-time programmers
as I need them.  When they work in assembler or C, they all use 'tools' of
various sorts to 'improve' their efficiency.  (I'm not convinced that's
necessarily true.)  When I have work done in C, I insist that the code pass a
'lint' test.  These programmers rely on volumes of libraries of sub-routines
and macros they(?) have previously written.  I doubt I get the most efficient
code possible this way but the way these people have been trained and simple
economics require that I accept the code (so long as it works and meets the
requirements I had specified).

I remember one bit of assembler code that gave me a real fit.  Most of the time
(three or four months), the program worked fine.  Occassionally, it reacted in
a weird fashion.  Took me a long time to find the error - the programmer had
tested the wrong condition code (which really wasn't a test at all in this
case).  The code fragment was -

          .                          (What it might look like under
          .                           your proposed assembler)
          .
          lea table(pc),a6              a6=table
          move.b (a6,d5.w),d7           d7=a6+offset or d7=a6+d5
          bne there                     'if n bit set' goto there
          .                             No, the first line above is wrong.
          .                             that would put the contents in d7
                                        we want the address so - why not
                                        'a6=adr(table)'

The offending code was the 'bne' - it should have been 'bmi' - he wanted to
test the 'n' flag.  Try to find it in about 12,000 lines of poorly commented
code.  So, is there a way for the assembler to pick the correct test?

Please stay away from C-like constructs - they can get messy and are not always
clear.  There is no reason to stay with traditional mnemonics per se. Yes, in
some cases what was selected may turn out to be the best but, more often than
not, it' not the best today.  One question, who is your intended user?  If
you're targeting the experienced C/assembler programmer, I suspect you'll get a
lot of resistance.  On the other hand, the new or casual user (really one and
the same) will appreciate an assembler that is easy to use and does not require
all kinds of 'tools' to increase programmers' productivity. And I fall into
this category.

Can the assembler use ordinary English words?  In order to ease the
requirements of the parser, a preprocessor might be used to tokenize these
words and if the tokens are sensible, users will probably learn them.

Another task the assembler should do is select whether the branch or jump is a
long or short.  Get tired of putting '.s's in only to get back error messages
telling me I can't do that - especially if its because I added some code.

Something I've sometimes wanted, was the number of clock cycles necessary to
execute a given instruction and a total for the program (or maybe for
sub-routines).  Sure, it can be looked up but what a job.  Can that be added as
an option?

Another area I suspect may be hairy for you is handling the various addressing
modes - especially if we want the assembler to select the proper mode for us.

While we don't want a slow assembler, absolute speed isn't as important as ease
of use and understanding.  Code that is easy to understand will result in
writing code with fewer errors requiring fewer assembly attempts. So, even if
we want more from the assembler, if its easier to use, the total time should be
less.

And I assume a linker will be included so we can write short routines.

Well, I've gotten pretty windy - only a good assembler should be this verbose!

Ed, the main reason for wanting to do an assembler is to get relocatable code
... the current SK*DOS assembler only does absolute.  It's ASM from Bud Pass. 
So the linker is a definite must.

Right after the PT-68 came out, Sidney Thompson recruited me to build a linker.
He and Bud Pass were developing a C compiler, but with no linker it makes
building modular software pretty difficult!

I did build the linker, but we had a chicken-and-egg problem:  A great linker
is not much good if the assembler and compiler can't generate the object
modules for it!  Really, the linker and assembler have to be built as parts of
a system.  So I had to begin with a linker format that ASM was capable of
generating, i.e. I was limited to what I could inject into the object file via
DC statements.

The linker's been done for about two years now, but Sidney and Bud don't like
it (not elegant enough for Bud, though he declined to offer any suggestions as
to improvement).  Neither has shown any interest in incorporating it into the
assembler or compiler,and Bud's support of SK*DOS seems to have dropped off to
zero.  So I figure if we're ever going to get a good relocatable
assembler/linker/compiler system ... in other words, adequate development
tools, I'm going to end up writing them.

Which brings us back full circle.  In a few attempts at prototyping the
assembler, I realized I was spending a lot of energy to handle a syntax that is
fundamentally flawed.  It seemed to me that, as long as I'm gonna do this,
might as well make a few improvements along the way.

I agree with you on both counts, i.e.

(1)  There's no need to try to make the assembler "look like" C.  In fact, it
could make things worse, since the programmer might then want to write other C
constructs that aren't supported.  That was a problem with Ed Ream's approach.

(2)  The programmer shouldn't have to decide whether to use long or short
branches, or short data forms (MOVEQ).  Who in their right mind would want to
use a three-word immediate when you could do it in one?  The assembler should
take care of that kind of thing.

(3) {OK, I lied about the "both"}  I need to define the audience. Experienced
assembly programmers aren't going to want to learn a new language.  I guess the
main user I'm interested in is me.  Anyone else who wants to tag along is
welcome.

Ed, in my preprocessor, the operative branch would have been
       if != there
 or
       if !0 there  (both statements mean the same thing)

The problem in your program was that the comment is N.G.  Instead of saying "if
n bit set," the programmer should have said what he really expected to happen,
i.e.  "If table entry is negative..."  This would have alerted you much quicker
to the problem, I'll wager.  In that case, my syntax would have been
       if <0 there

which is kinda hard to misinterpret!

Hi Everyone:

Just  have  a  chance to glance through the Jan 1991  Rainbow.  I noticed a few
interesting ads.

What  is  this  OS9/68000k PT68K4 single board computer  that  is being 
marketed  by Peripheral Technology and Delmar Co. If  they are  what I think
they are, then the new COCO 4 market (MM/1  and TC70  )  just got a lot more
interesting then I expected. Not  to mention  the other 68030 system based on
the AT bus plus a 32 bit bus(This one I heard through the grapevine).

Anyone got any info on the 68000 system?

Nam

P.S. The ad on page 77 of the same magazine by NMSA about a CAT.
     It is very interesting. But What do they sale for $399.95?

We are planning a 68030 machine with an AT bus and 32 bit expansion adapter.
This is still in the design stage - it will be quite a while before it will be

Rex - if there are any differences, they can't be much.  A lot of us will
format under one OS, and then write the needed info to make the disk work under
the other OS.

The biggest diff might be related to writing... L-II/coco no longer uses
precompensation because they say that it's not needed with modern equipment and
disks.  Doesn't seem to matter much tho.

Tandy didn't include and we've pointed out these calls, too, that *are* in the

Need to ask y'all about about CD drives.  It's the June 1986 Rainbow on page
218 written by Dale Puckett -- before the CoCo3 & Level 2 and even before I got
my Level 1 2.0.0 copy!  And I can't believe I've kept these old copies!  :-) 
Most of the OS-9 articles are *still* quite relevant, btw.

Page 218 contains one paragraph with its own subtitle, which I'll quote here
in its entireity for those who don't have this issue, if I may:

-*-

"Our Future {boldface}

   "The 68K version of OS-9 may very soon be the standard operating system on
most home-oriented computer systems.  At a recent conference sponsored by
Microsoft, Sony and Phillips proposed a new file format standard for the new
compact disc technology.  OS-9 68K is at the heart of the standard that
supports sound and graphics as well as data on the new disks.  The CD-I system
uses a Motorola 68000 processor and custom graphics and sound processors still
under development by Sony and Phillips.  The systems may be sold as complete
systems or as add-ons to existing audio CD players."

-*-

That's the entire article in the June 1986 Rainbow.  In 1988, we read that
Sony & Phillips will be putting OSK in ROM "in" the CD drives, such that the
host computers won't need anything special.  Last year we started seeing all
this stuff come out, BUT FOR THE IBMPC COMPATIBLES.

There are a few books I found at B.Dalton's written in/around these years that
will have you believe the CD-ROM standards will follow the CD-I pretty much,
in order for everything to remain compatible.  Yes one appendix did mention
multiple-level directories, file ownerships(!), executable files(!!) and the
"E" flag in the directory(!!!), etc.!!!!  Get my point?  But *still* not a
single mention about OS-9 or Microware or "whomever".  EXCEPT for the H.W.Sams
book on CD-I technology: they mention OS-9 and Microware a-plenty, plus this
Sams edition is published in the same year as the Rainbow article I just
quoted!  It's getting on to be 5 years OLD NEWS now.

Paul,

I think where many people get confused is that since CD-I uses OSK (OS9), the
interface to any machine running OSK is easy.  Not so.  As you pointed out, the
application software to access the data on the disk is independent of the OS
and is in fact, written to operate on the host machine. So far as I know, these
are the IBMs and the MACs.

Whether we like it or not, the fact is the OSK market is a miniscule market
(almost non-existant in the home).  The major software houses, including the
providers of CD-ROMS, do not feel it is worth their while to convert their
software to run under OSK.  They require a much bigger market than currently
exists or anyone has been able to convince them might exist.

DELMAR CO is looking at various ways the SYSTEM IV might read and execute these
application programs.  At this time, we are not prepared to claim this
capability.  Further is the question as to which system will prevail -
Philips/Signetics or Intel (Sony is playing in both camps).  Assuming we can
solve the application software problem, the SYSTEM IV is ideally positioned to
handle either system.

Microsoft has their "DOS extensions" to handle 'em.  If you presently want to
write programs to read the CDs, you must buy a $395.00 C-language component
package (libraries & stuff) to the regular PC compilers (yep you can order
these thru Tandy Express if'n ya want).  MSDOS will let you treat the CD drive
"as a drive" -- i.e. commands like "DIR D:" will work! -- and so will these
programming packages.

So ... the bottom line ... what is going on here?  How are FHL, KLE/IMS,
Delmar, Mustang, Disto, etc., going to support CDs?  We already know these
things use a SCSI interface, but that's not saying anything.  I invite
representatives from every OS-9 company & elsewhere to answer this question,
please -- inquiring minds want to know!  And I gotta tell 'em!

-- Thx, Paul Seniura.

(P.s. Intel is unveiling their DVI chips -- Digital Video Interface.  It
figures that the big-blue companies "gotta" do things their own way, eh?  By
the looks of all these el-cheapo CD drive sales coming up all of a sudden,
maybe the world is going to do things Intel's ways, and all those companies are
cleaning out their warehouses to make room for the real future.  ...

(DVI will show real-time video anywhere on any-size window area on the current
screen.  It's the kind of thing that the IBM MicroChannel [tm] is expressly
designed for [that's a full 32-bit data & address buss path, among other things
like the capability for a mainframe channel attachment, for those who don't
know].  ...

(Here we are with the TomCat and MM/1 etc., about 4 years behind technology
IF/WHEN THEY *DO* become available and IF they DO support any of these CDs
correctly.  I might have to wait for one of those proverbial "cold days" before
I buy *any* OS-9 upgrade.  Get the point?

(So I'm offering to help prototype new circuit designs for you companies out
there -- I'm currently in the process of ordering tons of IC books from
different manufacturers -- and I'm dead serious about making these items
available for the home/office OS-9 user.  I wouldn't be asking for these kinds
of details if I wasn't serious & didn't car@w

We have a local CDROM expert by the name of Bob Hall who's written books on
different subjects including CDROM and Microsoft will be publishing his new
book on CDROM technical information.  Everything I've read points to the fact
that CD-I was "first" and CD-ROM was suppose to be compatible in its storage
format.  We've also seen at least a few Specific references to the fact that
"the format" is OS9/68000 directories & modules etc.  Since the big conference
in 1986, we haven't seen any further specific information!  Not even Bob Hall
has seen anything as specifically mentioning OS9/68K as the official format.
But I have seen and I've told him where we found it, and have relayed this in
my earlier messages on Delphi here.  (If this thread is lost, I mentioned that
this info is not just in the Rainbow magazine, but also in Howard W. Sams
books.  If CD-I is in OS9/68K format, it follows in other books I found at
B.Daltons that CD-ROM is suppose to be compatible.)

What I'm after is NOT the SCSI specs ... I'm trying to ask the 3 major OSK
companies how they intend to run CDROM encyclopedias etc.  KLE's MM/1 brochures
as well as FHL's Tomcat flyers have both mentioned being able to hook in & run
CDROMs specifically (not/just/only CD-I) or will do so in the future.  Delmar
hasn't really dealt with this in their text files here but I'd still like to
know if they intend on supporting CDROMs as well.  I *know* the players use
SCSI protocols ... I'm not concerned about SCSI ... I'm concerned about how to
find/search/view the databases and graphics and animation and speech etc.  If
KLE and FHL are saying they can run CDROMs, by golly they better know what
they're talking about or they're falsely advertising the capabilities of their
machines!

And I am here inviting them to answer these inquiries. It'll drastically affect
which system I pick to buy.  OSK Windows is top on my list of priorities, but
CDROMs is a *very* close Second on my list.  If you developers want OSK to be
useful in the home and schools, and CDROMs are not *already* being supported,
then OSK is *already* about 3 years behind the times.  Just look at the
opportunities to make money ... else I fear OSK can't keep up with the Joneses
and it'll eventually wither away like the CoCo is doing right now.  Hey, I'm
talking about HOME and EDUCATION MARKETS, not industry or business.

Just this day I was trying to put the puzzle together.  It will probably
require writing some OSK applications (end-user friendly) based on the MSDOS
and Macintosh functions of any particular CDROM database.  For example,
Compton's Encyclopedia comes with MSDOS application programs (besides the
device drivers etc.).  The drivers do the low-level I/O etc.  The application
programs do the actual find/search/retrieval of the needed info.  There should
be a version of Compton's that runs on the Mac whose application programs are
possibly a "port" from the MSDOS ones (this is just an example; it might be
that Compton didn't make a Mac version).  Same database record I/O format, just
a port of the same C source code, say.  Well, of course Compton won't develop
an OSK version because there ain't no $money$ in it -- right?  Point made:
someone's going to need to get the database format from Compton and write the
application code ... the SCSI drivers etc. will already be in place under OSK
as a device driver.  If the sector & directory format of the CDROMs are not in
OSK format (i.e. away from all the literature I've been reading), there'll need
to be another system module to translate the raw sector data into
OSK-meaningful format.

See what I'm getting at?  Are KLE & FHL going to commit to this kind of support
for CDROMs?  If not, they had better stop advertising this or someone will be
going to the Fed. Trade Commission!

Paul - I agree that there's a great deal of confusion (in the entire computer
marketplace) about CDROMs.

First. The CD-I players are (finally!) due out this summer... the Japanese have
been showing units by many makers (a Sony portable is shown on Popular Science
Jan 1991 page 41).  Hard to judge yet, but with luck these players will become
as common as VCRs are now.  It's thought that perhaps 20% will be expanded by
owners out into OSK personals.

You are correct in reading that the directory structures on most CDROMs are of
a standard (which is not the same OS9 dir format you use now. that's what
different File Managers are for).  But the data files have no standard. Each
CDROM comes with its own program (you usually put it on your HD) for reading
that particular disc.  Mac users often complain about not having access to
discs available for IBM machines, and vice-versa.

So yes, we're in the same boat as Amiga, ST, Unix, and many other users
(including Mac/IBM at times)... each CDROM app must be ported to the specific
machine.  Or, new apps/discs must be created (feasible, tho time-consuming). 
One of our "aces" in the hole is because of CD-I... the people creating those
discs are already familiar with OSK. I hear that IMS is actively pursuing this
avenue, for instance.

So the possibilities are there.  I don't think I've seen any KMA maker
advertising that you can currently use Mac/IBM CDROM discs, tho.  If you feel a
need to complain to the FTC, start with the ads all around you for Mac/PC cdrom
where they assume everyone has the correct machine ;-).

The best way to help our community out is to become a good C/gfx programmer,
and be available to help port Mac/PC cdrom apps should the opportunity arise.

I believe (can't tell without pulling things apart :-) that you clip capacitors
C65 and C66 (back/front inside the ram area).  Will someone else please confirm
this for us?  Can't seem to find my old instructions.

Then pull out the old chips, and plug in the 512K board... usually you press it
carefully in, then pull out just slightly as you don't want the pins to touch
the board (the sockets have no bottom and things won't work if the upgrade
board pins touch the coco board).

On the cap-cutting, btw, I usually clip just one side... so I have a chance of
resoldering easier if/when I have to <grin>.  I know C66 is one of the two.
Just need confirmation on the other.  Guys???

you should remove C65 & C66; if you have a heat problem then you should use the
resistor mod.

I like Bonk a lot. The only thing that takes getting used to is mouse movement.
Also, I'm never sure how the ball will bounce off the ship. It seems random.

I also noticed that the ball is surrounded by a square. Is there any way to XOR
or whatever, to just have the ball without an outline?

the ball bounces at a 45 deg angle if it hit the ship on the edges, or at a 23
deg angle if it hit in the middle.  also, 1/4 of the time if bounces back the
same direction.

  re: ball with outline.  I'll see what i can do.

As far as ball bouncing, it would be better to be able to put "english" on the
ball.

Also, I noticed when I quit the game, the VIEW utility is not unlinked from
memory. You should probably make sure that all graphics buffers are also
KILLed.

Well, "english" a term used in billiards, means putting a spin on the ball. In
video games, it means if the racquet is travelling to the left when the ball is
hit, then the ball will also tend to travel to the left. Many versions of
BREAKOUT had this feature.

Neal,
     I met Vaughn at a party a few weeks ago, and asked him about
the osterm ASCII upload problem.  I had tried many times to get
it to work.  Well, I won't bother trying anymore... he said that
it never did work, and that he has no intentions of fixing it!
     There is a rumor that the source might be available for the
upload sections of the program... I'm investigating, and if true,
I will probably fix it.  In the meantime, to accomplish the same
goal, I'd recommend flipping to another window, and outputting
your text file to /t2, using a simple utility to send a
character, pause, send a character, etc.

Fm: NAM PUI 73347,3324
To: all

I   got MultiVue since it hit the market. However, after the novelty worn  off
after  the first month, I never bother with it again. Since then I have  added
hard  drives  to all my COCO IIIs. I have been getting along fine without  the
use of MultiVue. Just days ago I was going through the drives to clean out the
garbage  in  my  data files. I thought it would be great to be able to  use  a
point  and click enviroment to view and delete the unwanted files. So out come
Multivue  again.

I have been pulling my hair off since. Here is my system hardware set up. 512K 
COCO  III  with  J&M JFD-CP floppy controller  and  Owlware  hard  drive
interface/Omti  5200  controller  on  a  Y-Cable.  Seagate  St225  and  3-720k
floppy(2-5.25" and 1 3.5").

Software set up is as follow.
   Module Directory at 03:28:41 REL         Boot        OS9p1       OS9p2      
Init RBF         CC3Disk     D0          D1          D2 CCOmti      dd

Shell Cat         Dir         Display     Del         gotoxy ds          MDir

CC3Disk is the version patched for msdos ccomti.dr, dd, h0 are the Owlware
driver and descriptors Term starts up in 80 column. P1, CCPRINT are for the
parallel port on the J&M.

All  the /d0s in the autoex file is patched to /dds. Autoex renamed to Mv  for
manaul start up.

Now,  here  is the problem. Everytime I move from the root directory to a  sub
directory  on  the  hard  drive,  the window in mv  just  hangs  in  the  hour
mode(wait).  It seem to have effect the time share as well. The other  windows
slowed down as well. The whole things work well in the floppys.

Hope someone can help.

Thanks in advance.

Hmm. I think this can happen if you have lots of files and some 3-letter
extensions.  At the least, apply the MVFIX.SCR patch to gshell (from Lib 10)..
that should help.

If you do a "bro /key:gshell" there you'll find more patches.  Some people
began to use it after the patches ;-).

Larry,

I downloaded your 'ped.ar' file.  Looks like it might be interesting.  But
contrary to your comment in the docs, most can't even view the program because
we don't have a midi driver available.  The program errors out when it attempts
to open a path to the midi port.

I own a Yamaha PSR-48.  I kinda thought that it was the "big brother" to the
PSS-480.  Nowhere in the manual can I find any reference to inputing patches. 
Do you know if this synth has that capability?

As far as the question about the other Yamaha, I know nothing - as the colnel
on Hogan's Heroe's would always say - or was the large economy(sized guard? Oh
well, no I have had no experience with any other Yamaha. My gut feel is that if
it has MIDI, it probably has some form of SYSEX capability, but no tellin' what

Dennis -

Sorry about any typos/whatever on these messages... I am new to this CIS
editor... talk about computer shock!

I checked on the problem you were experiencing and I have an idea. I did test
the uploaded version of the PED and checked it out thoroughly. The idea I have
is that I forgot to mention that PED (right now, anyway) is expecting to use
the "Inkey" program that is supplied with BASIC09 and I know it put up about
most of the first screen, attempts to loa in the inkey subroutine module and if
it is not there, crashes.

A thought there - I suffered many an hour myself, until I realized that inkey
was being loaded outside the workspace, but INSIDE the "memory limitation" of
BASIC09 - I mean, if I went to a window, and typed "basic09 #32k <cr>" basic09
would load fine, but Inkey could not squeak into the memory area 'cause I had
it all earmarked. But if I used "basic09 #29k <cr>" there is ample room for
inkey... S%e what I mean?

As to the midi descriptor, even if I have none at all, or if my midi port was
named "/madd", PED would "run", it just wouldn't do midi. BTW, it really only
opens "/midi" when you are inside the editor and hit "P"lay. So if some typed
in "ped<cr>" and the ped"module was in their execution directory and "RUNB" was
there and "inkey" was there, everything would work great.

I sure hope this will help get things goin' fer ya' - I have used it enough now
to come up wit six suggestions for changes already. See you around - Larry exit

OK, I got 'ped' going - dunno what was wrong the first time.  Probably a matter
of what was loaded into memory, etc.  Anyway, looks interesting, but won't do
*ME* specifically (or anyone with a different synth) any good without the
source, and without a driver for the bit-banger for that matter.  Even then,
I'd need to find some docs about how to talk to the PSR-48.  The standard
manual isn't too clear on that point.

    Your timing is perfect.  For a use of localtime(), check out swave.ar in

latest of Carl's library uploads (December 1990).  He fixed the utime function;
the old version caused my programs to be off by a month. (Missing a month

Yesterday, I got back from spending the holidays with family, and found among

Everett, you don't say what baud you were using, although I imagine it was at
least 1200 or above, there is several sysops who run ribbs why don't you leave
a message for him. asking for the nearest sysop that runs ribbs, there is a
list of several. Another idea is that he has a ribbs echo that most of these
sysops attach to, leave a note there if he doesn't respond, lastly I don't know
what section of the country that you're calling from, but I know one sysop who
goes crazy trying to get people into ribbs, try calling his board @

The message I saw about this was, I think, on FIDO, and it mentioned problems
using Mark's UUCP to talk to a 386 and a VAX.  My guess--and it's only a guess,
of course--is, considering that VAXen and 386s both have the bizarro
leastsignificant-byte-first byte ordering, that there's some part of the
protocol that contains byte-ordering-dependent values that aren't getting
byte-swapped before use.  I haven't looked in the (very large!) uucp.ar to see
whether there is any indication of that's being the problem, though.

It's been a while, but VAX and Intel BOTH have different byte ordering schemes
from a 68K box. I seem to remember:

 68K - 1234 (MSB to LSB)
 VAX - 4321 (LSB to MSB)
 Intel 2143 .. Not sure on this last one.

   Empirically,  that would be my view too.  Byte ordering has bitten me when
porting between os9 and the intel world.  I have Mark's sources, but have not
read them all.   I do not have the Unix source for uucp.  Like I said, I
haven't the problem, so had no need to go looking for one. I was just surprised
when another claimed to have one.  Perhaps the error is on the 386 port, and
not the os9 port of uucp.
       Thanks,

Tom,

I communicate the 3 machines (besides several CoCo boxes) using Mark's version
of UUCP with my CoCo.

     1 - The Tandy Regional Office in Randolph, Mass. at least twice a
         week.  They are using a Tandy 4000 (386 box) running Tandy/SCO
         Xenix.  The version of UUCP is Honey Dan Bear.  I upload orders
         to them and receive stock updates from them using 'uucp' as
         well as mail back and forth using the 'mail' utilities.  I've
         been communicating with them since last February (1990).
         (Previously I used either 'uulink' on an MSDOS box or the
         UUCP provided by SCO on a Xenix 386 box.)
     2 - Tandy in Ft Worth occassionaly - no regular schedule.  They're
         using a VAX of some sort and I don't know what version of UUCP
         they're using.  This is primarily a mail link.
     3 - A Company in Long Island once a week.  They have a Wang computer
         and I don't know the version of UUCP they're running (neither do
         they).  I upload orders to them once a week using 'uucp' as well
         as occassional mail back and forth.

I did have problems setting up with Tandy.  They use a hyphen '-' in the site
names.  I had to set-up a different 'alias' file and I modifed uucico, login,
rmail and uuxqt to handle it.  I was the first vendor to set-up a link with the
Company in Long Island.  They had problems setting up their system.  They
finally had the Wang people set them up.

However the connection between uucico and 386/ix went like it was designed.

Yes, assuming you have enough system map space (for the text vdg windows), you
can pick a descriptor and for example:

 xmode /w6 type=1
 shell <>>>/w6&

The "type=1" sets it as a vdg type window default.  Other people sometimes make
up a set of renamed descriptors (/v0, /v1, etc) just for this purpose (there
may even be a set in Lib 10 here).

But the xmode will work fine.  Be sure to xmode back to type=80 afterwards...
just in case later on when you exit your program, an open to /w doesn't
accidentally find and use /w6 (or whatever) as a vdg window.  I'm rambling, but
I think you get the gist. <grin>  kev

Got a question and I don't know whether it's related to the way OS-9 does
redirection, or whether it's related to 'C'.  Any input welcome!

I'm developing a 'C' program that uses cursor positioning calls, and running it
from the active window, it works just fine.  However, when redirecting it to
another window, even before starting a shell on the non-active window, the
cursor positioning code seems to generate a LF rather than aligning the text in
the proper column... i.e. all the text that is supposed to be tabular is at the
left side of the screen!

  I'm using Bruce's window descriptors (they're all the same) and it exhibits
the same behavior whether the window is hardware or gfx, type 07 or type 02.

  Anybody know what's going on here?

 Thanks,

Hmmm...sounds like somehow you're emitting a CR there, and if that is done
using I$Writeln instead of I$Write, and the path descriptor has the option set
to cause CRs to be followed by LFs, then that could happen.  Could you post a
code fragment to show what is happening?  (Don't forget the SU (save
unformatted) when you do that.)

JJ;

  Originally, I had a \n after printing the date and name strings due to
the difference in the way DOS and OS-9 handle flushing the buffer.  With
the newline, all the data is positioned at the left side of the screen 
-- only when redirecting.  I have since added a fflush(stdout); statement
after the name and date, and again, in an active window, things work fine,
but redirecting causes the cursor positioning to get "eaten" and the following
data is positioned right after the name string.

 -------- code fragment from pgm. ----------
 #define CURSOR pos_cur
 ...
 ...

   CURSOR(1,curline);
   printf("%s   %s",date,name);
   fflush(stdout);

   if (span > 0)    
     {              
      CURSOR(45,curline);
      printf("%2d%s %s\n",span,suff,eptr);
     }
   else
     {
      CURSOR(50,curline);
      printf("%s\n",eptr);
     }

Any ideas on why redirecting stdout would cause cursor positioning to be hosed?

No, I can't think of any reason for redirection would do that.  I lack
experience with doing window-related stuff, so about all I can say is that
folks have had trouble, or said they've had trouble, with situations in which
they have emitted escape sequences containing CR because for some reason (if
they use C standard I/O, it will happen for SCF devices) I$Writeln is used to
write the data instead of I$Write, because in that case they got an extra LF. 
If that is what is happening to you, then the only solution I know of is to set
the _RBF bit in the _flags field in the FILE structure that you're using before
you do any output, since that will force it to use I$Write.  This,
unfortunately, also means that you'll have to explicitly emit LFs after CRs
that you want to have LFs following, since SCF doesn't distinguish between CR
as part of an escape sequence and other CRs (which is kind of a shame).

 re: portability

  Not _too_ bad, if you start with it in mind, but somewhat of a pain.  I've

(isn't there always?) that I'd like to change.
  Taking a note from your 'more' program, I'm using "read(1,keyin,1);"  where
"keyin[1]" to get a user response without having to press <ENTER>.  Under DOS,
I've tried "read(stdin,keyin,1);"  which the manual says SHOULD work, but
alas, the value returned is "\5" rather that the "y" or "n" I'm expecting.

I'd be very surprised if that worked.  read() wants a path number (or a "file

interpreted when handed to a function wanting a path number.

OK...that has to do with input, rather than output.  Unless you do something to
make C standard I/O do otherwise, like turn off buffering or set the _RBF flag,
it will use I$ReadLn on SCF paths open for input to read data.  That
accumulates data until it either runs out of buffer or it reads a CR (well, the
EOL character for the path, but that's usually CR).

  Thanks for all the input and advice... I got the program working on both

  For all those following the thread and wondering,  the program I'm working on
is a C version of my DATECK.B09 program in DL10.  Tim Kientzle, I think, posted
a message on the Net asking for such a program during a discussion of OSK
software, and I though I'd try converting it as an excercise.

  If anyone would like to 'beta' test it, let me know and I'll mail you the
code for your comments and input.  The program, generally called from Startup,
checks the next 30 days for significant events like birthdays, anniversaries,
etc., and will let you search by month or name.
  This is a learning excercise for me, so any input on additional functions or
bells/whistles is solicited.

  Program willrrun on both OS-9 systems and PC-DOS systems.  I gave my boss a
copy so he could track when performance reviews and appraisals are due.

the 'hurry-up' mode, and we didn't get to cover MAKE.  I spent the better part
of Sunday downloading the latest version of CLIB, CLIBT, and CLIBDOC between
teenagers and line noise.  Now I'd like to print out the MAN pages using MROFF,
but ahe version I've got barfs on some of the added formatting codes, so I've
got to re-compile the source in the CLIBDOC file.

  Could you give it a quick run through for me please?

  I've separately compiled the 4 .c sources using cc -r prgname.c and placed
the output in a RELS directory which, if I'm interpreting MAKEFILE correctly is
where they're supposed to be.  Trying to run MAKEFILE though gives me an error
#216g  Where am I going wrong?

Thanks,
  ...Jim

Jim -

Running make usually requires that the Makefile be named just that (in Unix the
capital is significant - is os9 it's not). The make file is a list of
depenancies, and the Make program recurses down the list. Ex:

 foo: part1.r  part2.r  foo.h

 part1.r:

 part2.r:

This makefile pretty much uses all defaults. That is, the .r's are implicity
built from .c's. It first looks at the target (foo), and then what makes it up.
It then checks the constituent parts, and sees what makes THEM up.

For now, forget a RELS dir, and just put all your .r files in the current dir.
Also, delete any macro relating to OBJS or RELS in the makefile.

  Nabbed Tim K's MAKE and got MROFF compiled with no problems... maybe I'm
getting the hang of this stuff, eh?  The learning curve seems to be flattening
out a bit.

  Also played around a bit with yours and Mark's man.c, and got an idea for the
next project... integrating a 'more'-like util into 'man' and using an
environment file for the input to man so that the libs don't have to be
'hard-coded'.  (dreams of grandeur, tempened by inexperience!!)

Hmmm... dunno about an integrated version.  I was talking about Mark's version
that he included in CLIBDOC.AR which he had hacked for his system.

  That one does indeed have 'more' "in" it, but not integrated.

 I don know nuttin' about no stinkin' termcaps! ;-)

 I'm using the cursor positioning routine "pos_cur" that I found in screen.h.
 It works fine as long as I don't try to redirect output to another window.

  I can run the program from /w2 and things are as they should be, but if I
<clear> to /w3 and redirect back to /w2, the cursor positioning gols to he** in
a handbasket.  See message #9057 for more details.

  Haven't gotten into the why's yet, but playing around with different ways of
calling the program, if I call it like so - dateck <>>>/w2 , it works the way
it's supposed to, but only redirecting stdout, messes up the cursor
positioning.  This prob is on my list of rainy day things to do, but after 5
rainless years, it may be a while! <grin> (that's a dry gryn)

The problem you are encountering with the disto 4 in 1 board and the seagate
157n is the same problem that I encountered with my St125n drive. Ken Scales
has written a patch for the disto drivers that cure this problem and also allow
formatting of the hard drive under OS9. You can contact Ken by leaving him a
message on compuserve, although it would be quicker if you have access to Delfi

Mark replies to some UUCP questions: <<>>

In Message 9015 Tom Napolitano says:

>     I see mentioned on the coco echo that some folks are saying Mark's uucp
>does not communicate properly with 386 machines?   What are the details?

Sigh, yes it is true...there are at least a couple machines that my UUCP
protocol has trouble talking with.  So far, I know about a DEC microVAX running
ULTRIX and a Intel 386 box running an unknown 386 version of UNIX. I suppose
there are more lurking out there someplace.  I think one or more Apple
implementations have trouble also.

In Message 9016, James Jones says:

>My guess--and it's only a guess, >of course--is, considering that VAXen and
386s both have the bizarro >leastsignificant-byte-first byte ordering, that
there's some part of the >protocol that contains byte-ordering-dependent values
that aren't getting >byte-swapped before use. I haven't looked in the (very
large!) uucp.ar to see >whether there is any indication of that's being the
problem, though.

You may be right there, but I think it is something less bizzare.  On all the
machines that my port has problems with, you can send to the problem machine
without any troubles, but you just can't receive anything from it, but only
after the two machines go into the 'g' protocol transfer mode.  I have looking
into the problem, but it is very very obscure as you can imagine.

On a lighter note, I do have a sliding windows version now running (actually,
sorta limping) and will be cleaning it up in the near future for release.  I
hope to have the above mentioned bug fixed by then too.  Dunno if any
non-upgraded CoCo's will be able to handle sliding windows UUCP tho....those
that had tried it failed.  I think I'll have to do some fancy optimizing to get
them to work OK.

There is a utility package sold by D P Johnson which supports a complete set of
transfer functions it also allows formatting.  Another package is sold by
Clearbrook systems and this has a similar collection ( I understand - not
having actually seen it) What I have seen from Clearbrook is their IMS database
4th Gen Language and that was excellent.  I never got past the demo system what
with not being a very organized person and having no data to base. :-) Sorry -
do not know of a public domain MSDOS formatter.

The MM/1 is not, unless either someone does a 6809 emulator or the OS/Gateway
is done.  The TC70 (the 68070 board that plugs into the K-Bus box) is not,
either.  Both of those systems use 68070s.

The TC09 (the 6309 board that plugs into the K-Bus box) *is* supposed to be
