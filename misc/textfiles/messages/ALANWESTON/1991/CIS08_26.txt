Hi Folks,

Would anybody know a way that I can get "The Interbank Incident" which is a
Level One game, to run on my 10 meg hard drive, which is running under Level
Two???

The HD installer utility "Copybank" on the Interbank disk worked great, it put
all the files on the HD perfectly, it's just that the Title screen won't come
up (looks like a mess!). It does the same thing when I try to run the game from
floppy under Level Two, so I assume it's some incompatibility between Level One
and Level Two.

Any Ideas???

Thanx in advance!

Bob

Since the game is a level one game, it probably runs in an old style vdg
screen.  The key probably is to run the game in a vdg type screen.  Try that!

Thanx for the suggestion, Sunny, but I did use a VDG screen when attempting to
run it. I don't know where else the problem might be!

Paul,

The CompuServe Network supports a ton of hosts. I understand that they handle
(or have handled in the past) all Visa point of sale transactions as well as
Red Roof Inns Reservation systems.

You can connect to the WELL via the net (Use WELL as the HOST prompt) and get
some information on that public Unix system...but suffice it to say, if you
don't know what to type in response to the HOST prompt ... you don't belong
there!  :-)

Steve,
 Beginning to suspect hardware myself, since there is no rhyme or reason to the
crash. At one time I thought it was Tymnet, since it never happened here. Then
it happened here. Then it started on smaller files! Seems as thou all input is
blocked, both keyboard and serial port, although the hotkey still works and
other shells seem normal. Procs doesn't show any weird signals or dead stuff.
Oh yea... sometimes with a buffer capture going things stop and I have to ESC C
off and ESC C back on to get things moving again. If anyone else has seen this,
please drop me a line. Already reheated all 120 solder joints to no avail so
I'm stuck.Unless the ROM thats still in the modempak? CS is tied hi, but I
think I read somewhere to pull it?
 Thanks for the response   -Rick

In using ACIAPAK, and at one time had a diode hak, but yanked it because it
even crashed RomPaks. I tried to find the 'old style' IRQ hack, but guess I
gave up, since it's not on any of the 15 or 20 floppies here! Everything is on
a Y-board (one hand drawn %#&$'$ labor of love), so I guess the IRQ's are tied
together, but not hacked inside.

The lack of the hack (grin) could be the culprit. Never did like the diode

Actually, I like the features like that.  And the one where you can pre-set
optional arguments.  I figure that should be available in all C compilers. What
I have trouble with is when the C++'ers get really wacked out and the code has
all these strange ::'s and other odd constructs in them.  All I can say is,
when we have it in OSK, I'll learn it.  Till then, like, why bother.

But by all means, let's get it available soon.  I hate to think of all the code
I'm going to have to go back and re-write when it does come out...

Scott,
 Maybe when I have finished coding a couple of the classes I designed for our
project I'll upload them, "::"'s and all <g>. I can think of a couple where the
data hiding concept is really kinda nice - users of the class don't have to
allocate storage or anything. One is a fifo message buffer that buffers up to
10 messages in ram, then starts putting them to the disk. All users of the
class have to know is
 msgbuf.putmsg();
  ... and ...
 msgbuf.getmsg();
 without knowing what it does or how it does it. And just by declaring a
"msgbuf", all the memory is allocated for you, the msg queues are created, and
the file is opened. Either way, you'll learn it when you need to (as in, when
it's forced on you, like me). :)

That's not what I wanted to hear, but I'm inclined to accept the truth of your
observations and experiences. Kevin or someone else mentioned that a Jim Omura
might have developed some software drivers for the digitizers, and that it
might be over on BIX.  A friend who accessed BIX for me sent me a directory of
OS-9 files that are on BIX, and Omura's name is on just about every other file,
but none of the files seem to be drivers for the DS-69x family of devices.
  I figured that a major addressing conflict was socking it to the OS9 Boot
process.

Thanks for the info. Lee



P.S.  What's the latest release level of MVCanvas that's available for the OS-9
Level 2 system?  I have 2.0, and it seems to be extremely clean except for a
squashing/unsquashing problem scrambled print outs (when a lot of dithering
appears in the graphic.) [D [D LV

I wasn't aware that anoyone was working on Drivers for the DS-69b.  Let me know
if you find anything.  The main reson I looked into it was, at the time, I
couldn't get a Rascan, and I put my CoCo in a PC case and didn't like having to
take the case apart just to use the DS-69.  I finally purchased bought another
CC3 with a disk drive, so I gave up on getting it to work with the B&B HD
setup.

And yes, 2.0 is the latest version,  I'm glad you like the program.

There was a mistake in the code that Kevin uploaded. Instead of type stack: in
the first line, it should be as follows:

PROCEDURE GetSType

TYPE stack=CC,A,B,DP:BYTE; X,Y,U:INTEGER

DIM reg:stack

DIM SS_ScTyp:BYTE \SS_ScTyp=$93

DIM I_GetStt:BYTE \I_GetStt=$8D


reg.A=1 \(* path = stdout

reg.B=SS_ScTyp

RUN syscall(I_GetStt,reg)

PRINT "Screen Type = "; reg.A

END

I can't believe that I actually could look at code and notice that there was a
mistake in it.

Not bad for a guy who until recently said "I should have bought the hat with

them, and download a .ar file and see whether you can extract the files from

Sometime around 1987 or so, Radio Shack used to sell this fire mans hat with a
flashing light and siren built into it. Every time I have a problem with my
COCO I would say "I should have bought the hat with the light." Instead of the
computer. Little did I know that the Brothers have been scouring yard sales and
rummage sales, looking for one. When I got back from Mass today, there by my

I remember when I was doing apartment maintenance back in college, the boss
told us we had to respond more quickly to calls.  So we all got one of those
hats on sale, and the next time he yelled for us, we showed up with light
flashing and siren screaming.  Fortunately, he laughed too :-)

is (I can't test for it).  But assuming that umacs works, then the TOPS games
must be using a different termcap library routine, which must be looking in a
different place for the termcap file.  Try looking around for a file that has
termcap entries (would be called termcap) in another directory.  If you find
it, save it off and copy our (/dd/sys/termcap) termcap in it's place.  But
first you might just try setting your TERM var to 'ansi' first.  If the termcap
file the game is looking for contains ansi, which it might, that would be the
easiest fix.

Actually, the disk (I downloaded it from here) contains nothing but the three
games files and a couple of readme's - no termcaps of any sort.  I've tried
copying the termcap from my system disk, but to no avail.  Is there something
on one of the other disks I need to get?

Thanks,

Hmm.. You have a /dd/sys/termcap that has 'vsc' in it right? Oh, wait a sec,
maybe those programs are looking for the vsc in a differnt place.  Let me get a
hold of a copy and I'll check it out for myself...

Your message re getting the TOPS games to work sounded pretty familiar. They
would not work on my system either. So I did a bit of sleuthing.

Most of the TOPS stuff uses a port of curses (called ncurses) which has been
modified to use termcap instead of terminfo. The folks who did the port wrote
their own termcap functions, which are not quite as robust as the microware
ones. The TOPS termcap routine insists that the first name listed in a name
line be two characters long (actually, my reference states that it should be
so...). All you need to do is change the termcap name line from

   vsc!k1!signetics...

to

   k1!vsc!signetic...

Note, the !s should be bars, but I'm typing this off line and I'm not sure what
CIS does with bars.

Guess we should fix all of our termcap entries. The microware stuff will handle
either form, so no problem.

Was playing around with the "NEWCAL.AR" file from lib 12.  It's a little
calendar utility - works fine, but it wants to find entries for "se" and "so"
in your termcap file. Before I figured out how to put those entries in termcap,
I killed all the lines that used termcap from the source and recompiled it
(that works too, but no highlight on today's date).  Anyhoo, after digging
around in the books, I added the following to the end of the termcap file 
:se=\037\041:so=\037\040:  (those are the octal codes for reverse video start
and  end).  As an added bonus, uemacs now displays its status line in reverse
video.   How bout that?.

I don't like the brass or solo strings on the MT32 -- most of the woodwinds are
great.  I know ROland has done a lot since, like the U-110, but I haven't heard
any of it so can't comment.  Seems like everyone raves about the Proteus box as
bang for buck.  But if you want a real surprise, find a Yamaha PSR-300 -- a
**topuch8responsive** 5-octave keyboard and 100-patch synth with 28
simultaneous voices, 15 different instrument polyphony, for three hunnnert
bucks!  You can't diddle the sounds tho -- they're canned samples.  Nice
percussion set too.

What the MT-32 really needs is better firmware in its control section-whoever
programmed that probably got fired as janitor from the Gortrtlieb pinball
company.  THat's Gottlieb on a non-Puppo keyboard :-)

ignored.  The MIDI crystal to supply that external clock is on the paddle
board.  At least that's how the prototype qwquickie hack MIDI paddle board I

I'm just getting started in the OS9/68000 world as I just bought a PT68K4
computer a couple of weeks ago. Even though the PT comes with four serial
ports, I went ahead and bought an IBM-compatible 2400 baud modem card mostly so
I could try my hand at writing a device driver and to see just how easy it
would be to make the thing work. I verified that the card DOES work by setting
it up in DEBUG. It is programmed as if it were a standard 8250 com port chip.
What I need is any information that anyone might have on writing device drivers
for OS9/68000. I'm also looking for info. on getting the thing set up with the
interrupt system. I'm hoping that maybe someone has already written some sort
of SCF device driver that I could play around with. Any ideas?????
