Thanks Roy. I knew it should be somewhere on the disks or in the docs, but
darned if I could find it... The only info I _really_ needed was the module ptr
so that I could do my own "mdir" stuff, but I was curious about the other
fields. Now, I even more curiouser -- just what does the "module group ptr"
point to and what is the "module group memory size?". Just looking at some of
my output, it must have something to do with memory allocation, since my ROM
modules have different ptrs that the ones loaded into RAM.

I expect the module group pointer has something to do with modules that are
loaded as a group, i.e. several from a single file.  (I hasten to add that I'm
guessing.)

I think James is right.  It was inherited from OS9 Level II.  To quote
my very old OS9 user's manual.
"On Level Two systems, two or more modules loaded from the same file comprise
a "group", and are always assigned contiguous memory locations, and are
treated somewhat collectively."
Too bad they don't talk about it in the OSK manual.

Jim - I am able to run ATERM from a terminal but not from the VT70 on my TC70. 
Thee is some strangeness about the way the two handle keyboard input buffering.
To use Aterm I just renamed the device driver appropriately.  On the VT70 it
gives a menu but crashes after the on line message.  From the serial port via a
Zenith terminal all is well. Mind you I still love Sterm and RZ/sz for smooth
operation.  Aterm does work with shell call too and it has got auti dialing.  I
do not know what to say about the terminal emulation values. - you do have a
TERMCAP entry for your VT70 yes? (aterm crashes if you have not done a setenv) 
Use the values from there
 if you must but they hav no effect on my terminal.

I really like my MM/1!  I don't have an IO board yet, but should have it within
a couple of weeks.  I do use a CM-8, and the graphics are very good (don't let

Anyways, good luck getting yours!

Hi Colin... I expect someone will write a better GIF file viewer real soon. Or
someone might port ViewGif over - with a couple small additions and some more
speed, ViewGif is the best I've seen on the CoCo3. Anyway, I expect I'll be
bugging ya some more once my MM/1 gets here. I wrote a zap program about 3
years ago called Snap (for RSDOS). In 88/89 I ported it to OS/9, still 100%
assembler. During the last week or so, I've been improving it. One more command
to add and it's a DEd killer for sure. I'm going to have to learn 68000
assembler quick and port it to the MM/1. Maybe I could make a few bucks ya
know... Talk to ya later.

Gifshow has made advances since the version that came on the floppies with my
MM/1.  Mike Haaland has been busy.  The interlace and overscan modes come into
their own when displaying GIF files, that's for sure.

Since viewgif spends a considerable part of its time figuring out what palette
combinations to use to make up for not being able to display 256 colors on a
CoCo 3, just porting to the MM/1, which *can* display 256 colors at a time,
will automatically speed it up (since one can cut out the code that does that)!

In LIB 10 you should find UNZIP2.PAK. That should help with the Unzip problems.
I've not seen anything on LHARC for the 6809. There are a couple of things in
LIB 12 for OSK, but probabbly won't help you much.

By the way, I found these items using the new across library searching features

Enter _any_ library and type:

There is an UNZIP3 for the CoCo.  If it isn't in our Libs (I think that it is
tho), I'll upload it.  Don't forget that your MS-DOS util will probably require
you make a change to your os9boot.  If you have PCDos in the Libs here, you'll
have to use the IPatch util to patch your CC3Disk.dr module. If you have GCS
File Transfer Utilities, a commercial program, you'll need to install SDISK3 in
accordance with your docs (I don't have GCS so I can't say just what to do). 
You may also consider adding a 720K 3.5" drive to your system too.  If you
intend to do a lot of transferring you may want to use GCS, esp. the Multi-Vue
version (if you have MV).  GCS will also format MS-DOS and will handle Disk
BASIC disks (although there is a RSDos in the libs) as well as Flex disks. 
I've heard GCS will fully support high density disks if your hardware can
support them and OS-9 is properly set up.  Going for high density may become an
important consideration if you do a lot of disk exchanging with PC's.

I have the patched version of CC3Disk already. Even though, at the moment I do
not have my new drives, I can access both RSDOS and MSDOS disks with the RSDOS

If you do want to go for high density...  You will need a disk controller that
can handle it, and the only one I'm aware of is a part of Owl-Ware's hard disk
system.  That system will not work with Disk BASIC so if you use DECB at all
you would have to either give it up or swap controllers.  If you are interested
in GCS, you can find ads for it in Rainbow.  It costs $44.95 std/$54.95MV.  You
can also order the required SDISK3 from GCS for about $30 or direct from DP
Johnson.  You can write to GCS; they'll send you copies of Rainbow reviews and
such.  For my occasional MS-DOS work, the PCDos I downloaded is fine.  But I
think GCS is better if you intend to do a lot of transferring.  I'd recommend
using a RAMdisk (which must be as big as the biggest file you want to transfer)
but any TWO disk drives will work fine.

Paul,

Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner. I see things have worked out for you,
tho...

Over the years of watching the messages and screwing up myself, the most poular
causes for 'green screen only' on boot is as follows:

1)  MPI is 'cocked' in the ROM PORT. The fit on my box is lousy. I am forever
having to shut things down and reinstall the MPI correctly.

2)  There's a memory problem (generally hits 512k systems). Board is loose,
'Hemphil' resistor came loose, board is tood deep (not deep enough).

3)  You toasted the CPU. IF you gotta replace it, socket it. You'll toast more.

4)  You're having a GIME with your toasted CPU.

Your problem was a variation on #1. With the wire missing from the upgrade
board, the system wasn't seeing the disk controller. All other systems were
good as told by the Extended Banner showing up.

Keep us posted on the results of your testing. You've got me curious!

One more thing to add to the list of things to check--- I spent several
frustrating days because of an intermittent dirty contact in the manual slot
select switch on my MPI.  The thing would work fine for a while then loose its

modem lights would flash.  Drowned that puppy in tuner cleaner - cured it.

To get the source code to the original clock module you will probably need a
disassembler.  I've recently downloaded DASM from Delphi's OS-9 Forum; I
haven't used it much yet but it seems to be pretty good.  I haven't checked our
Libs but I'd be surpirsed if we didn't have one.  You could also run a
disassembler on the Disto module.  I'd suggest you disasm the original, the
patched original, and the Disto.  See how the source code changes from the
original to the patched original and from that you may be able to ascertain how
to modify the Disto source and reasm.  When you're done and got it all working,
run MakPatch and upload DISTOC.IPC as you probably won't be the last to have
this sort of trouble:-).

   Easy to say there Eric. I have a disassembler from this forum called disasm.
I tried this before asking about source code. Try disassembling the clock
module and see what you get. I can't make heads nor tails out of it.
   Here's a new twist to this problem: with the Pete Lyall patch installed I
was still getting errors on downloads with my SACIA bootdisk and lockups when I
tried to use a remote terminal on another serial port while downloading. So out
of frustration, I switched back to using ACIAPAK and things worked fine. In
fact, they appeared to be better than usual. So I was pleased with the new hack
(which proved to be quite troublesome to install).
   So I downloaded about 400k of files from a local BBS and was transferring
them to disk using 'cp /r0/* /d2' which always worked in the past. About 5
files were transferred when an error 202- Interrupt Polling Table Full started
occuring on every next file copy attempt. The system refused to accept disk
commands after this and I lost most of the files because I had to reboot. Very
frustrating.

Doing a BROwse /key:patch in LIB 10 brought up an interesting file. CCDISK.IPC
claims to cure the 202 error in the original Disto ccdisk.irq driver. Infact,
the description of the file describes the same problem you're speaking about

 Well Steve,
             I have this Disto no-halt floppy controller which comes with
Cc3Disk.slp and CC3Disk.irq. I've been using CC3Disk.slp because I tried the
irq one and it was a real mess. I will go get that patch though. Anything is
worth a try. For some reason, my remote terminal decided it was going to lock
up the system where it had been working fine. I didn't change ANY software.
Makes me think something is hardware buggy. All these problems started when I

I've never used a special Clock module; I had been using the one that came with

I'd say look at your CC3Disk and your device descriptor.  I myself don't use
Backup; I find it faster and easier to use my DECB "512K Backup Lightning" that
came with my 512K upgrade; I will be using Backup soon though since I have a
720K drive waiting to be installed pending arrival of a new drive cable, and
"Lightning" does not support 80 tracks on 2 sides.

Great....

Yes - that extension to the hack is common, and is fine as long as you're not
double routing (two paths) the interrupt. It's a simple hack, but has worked
reliably for years. Glad to see that you have some large downloads without
errors now.

If you haven't already, apply the patches that make your serial input buffers
larger. Truth be known, stock SCF's are dogs, and they can't pump serial data
very well... this translates to bigger buffer requirements. I was using a hot
rodded SCF on my GMX for a while that helped immensely.

Are you using the WIZ for Compuserve? If so, there's a better,  easier choice
that shouldn't require hardly any bootfile manipulation... STERM. It also
supports the B protocol, which is much more effecient for Compuserve downloads.

If you're set on using WIZ, Bill Brady is author. He stops in here once in a
while, but last I heard he was managing an os9 forum on Genie.

If you're interested in STERM, go to DL7 and type BRO STERM* to see the latest

Larry,
 I think I can help you out here.  Look at the following code segment:

 os9 F$Fork
 bcs bp1       Branch if Fork unsuccessful
 os9 F$Wait    Wait for child to die
 bcs bp1       Branch if Wait unsuccessful
 tstb
 bne           Branch on child error condition

After returning from a Wait system call carry set indicates that for some
reason the system couldn't execute the call and the b reg contains the error
responsible for the failure.  If carry is clear then the b req contains the
status returned from the child: 0 if no error or the error number of the fault
the child process encountered.  Hope this helps.

 There is nothing "real" out there at all. Did you get the questionaire from MW

the choices, indicating that they might do it if interest were high enough.
Another possibility I had considered was just running cfront on another machine

Mark;

  Please pass this info on to Paul, as I have an unusually hard time contacting
him.

  I have replaced the pallette controller chip on my board and the system is
now operational.  What I found to be the cause of the trouble is that the
aluminum standoff nearest the keyboard connector had worn thru the trace that
runs _very_ close by the mounting hole and was grounding the whole board.  I
used some liquid PVC to re-insulate the trace and also used some nylon spacers
to get the board off the standoffs.

  The original power supply is now powering the setup after I replaced the
original defective fan.  The replacement PS will not switch in without a HD
connected, as the power draw of the single board is just too low.

   There is only one more problem to solve and I'm not quite sure yet what's
happening... drive /d1 now gives 247 seek errors when trying to access that
drive.  It'll do a 'dir' OK, but accessing any file or subdirectory on the disk
results in the 247 seek error.  If I copy a new file over to the disk, it'll
read that OK, but not any of the data created previously. Also, trying to
format a disk in /d1 results in a 246 error.

  In your opinion, do you think that my 'short' could have fried the drive
electronics in a way to give the above errors??

  Thanks,
      ...Jim

What kind of dmode is set up on your /d1?  What kind of diskettes are you
formatting?  (Highdensity?  Normal?)  etc.

How big a file goes over okay?  Does copying another one mess things up? Sounds
kinda like no side select, or something.

I've met one other person whose board wouldn't work without spacers... I
thought they were supplied with the kit tho (nylon spacers)(?).

The IRQ Hack is normally a simple hardware modification.  Details can be
downloaded.  I believe it's IRQHAK.TXT in some lib.  You might want to bro
lib:all key:irq to find it.  There are TWO RSSave's.  One is Basic-09, the
other is not.  Check your docs to see which you have.  Or use Ident on your
Rssave command.  If you have the Basic-09 one, delete it and get the other one.
It's better than the B09 util on which the "other" one is based.  If you are
NOT using the Basic-09 one, what do the problems seem to be; mine works fine.

The software IRQ Hack will work only if you are using the original Clock
module.  If you have a hardware clock and installed a new Clock module you
cannot use the software fix as published.  I believe the software fix was in
the August 1990 issue of Rainbow.  The Telecom article in the current issue
(11/91) may also be helpful.

At 300 baud the IRQ Hack is probably not necessary (it wasn't for me anyway).
But at 1200 you should have it.  Consider it a must-have if you want to go to
2400 baud.

 I tried copying /h0 to /dd but when I did an ident on the boot file, I could
not find /dd. Then I used DeD to internally patch /h0
 to /dd, now the disk wouldn't boot. What I want to do is boot from a disk in
/d0 and then switch over to my harddrive to function as /dd. If I have it come
up under Multivue,(Autoex) how do I change the execution directory to find
/dd/cmds on the harddrive? Btw, I have patched INIT to look for /dd instead of
/d0. Should I have made it look for /h0 instead. I have a Seagate 138N drive,
which is a 30 me g drive if that makes any difference. I know that this should
be a simple thing to do, but at the moment it is simply beyond me. Please help
and do not be afraid to be general and insult my intellegence. If ignorance is

You want two device descriptors, one for /h0 and one for /dd--of course, they
will refer to the same device.  Once you make a copy of the device descriptor
for /h0, edit the copy, change "h0" to "dd", and *don't* forget to set the most
significant bit of the last d.  Then verify the module, and put both of them in
your boot file.
