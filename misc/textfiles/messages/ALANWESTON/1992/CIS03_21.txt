I know that there are a couple of 'vi' clones for the 68K, but uEmacs is
probably as good as it gets on the '09 (unless you want to use TSedit, which is
a limited vi spinoff, which requires hacks to run in 80 column mode).

Thanks for the tip, Bob.  Changing DEFAULT solved one of my problems and a more
careful scrutiny of your script versus mine solved the other.  The reason PHONE
was hanging my computer was that I wasn't quitting before label 9.  I thought
the script would go right through the label to the quit command.  Making the
last three lines  \q  \9  \q   solved the problem. Thanks for your help.  Ches.

Glad we got you fixed up.

One other thing to keep in mind about the DEFAULT area: You have a different
set of defaults for _each_ baud rate you log on with. Expect this problem to
reappear should you log in with a different speed.

All of the 'hidden features' of the Hitachi 6309 that we've tested seem to work
as per the Usenet posting.  Has everyone else come up with the same results?

We doubt that Hitachi would go to the trouble of removing these features from
future production runs and that it is probably fairly safe to use these
features in a program that is always guaranteed to run on a 6309. Comments? 
Thoughts?

Dear Friends: I recently reconfigged my boot disk to include a patched version
of Level 1's printerr. I had also used a patched version of cc3io which would
beep on an error. Now with printerr, which for those who don not know, gives
full error messages rather that just the error number, it no longer beeps. I
got the printerr patch from Bob Santy's Patch.Ar which contains Ipatch and a
few other things. Can I have the best of both, beeping on error and both the
error number and error message for the errmsg file in /dd/SYS ?

Thank you for your help, With all best wishes, Br. Jeremy, CSJW.

I had the same problem and solved it.  I presume you gained the printerr
function by adding os9p3.  If this is the case, use dEd, EZGen, or whatever
else you use to edit modules to change it.  As you look at the ASCII part of
the dump (the right hand part of the screen if you use dEd) you can read "ERROR
#" (without the quotes).  Change the "#" to a ASCII 07 then verify the module. 
You'll have beep on error again.  (I think it's near the end of os9p3 so skip
to the last LSN of the module and work toward the beginning until you find it.)

If you use DED on the patched file you will see the string "Error #".  The "#"
is at offset $37.  You can change the "#" to $07 and get a beep instead of the
"Error #nnn".  What will be the message after the patch (and CRC update) is
"Error <BEEP>nnn".  Hope this helps.

What follows is a relatively new feature of the OS-9 Community Network. The
OS-9 Community Network Board of Directors have a private online meeting place
in Fidonet, where they can discuss how to improve the network without alot of
noise from outsiders. This does not means we keep any secrets, but rather it is
easier to get more done with less people around, just as in real life. So as
not to keep secrets, we have allowed Eric Carson in for the purpose of
reporting to the general membership our activities. The general membership is
then encouraged to offer feedback in any forum a member chooses (that the BOD
has access to). This includes CIS, as I am here every week. If anyone has any
questions on these reports, or the OS-9 CN files in the library, feel free to
ask, or leave me a message at the Internet address OS9CN@flex.com. Of course, I
am always available on the Fidonet echos as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------DISCLAIMER:
 The content of the following text is solely the view of the author. I

 or OS9 echo near you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------CURRENT
B.O.D. ACTIVITY:
 Nancy Ward's resignation from the position of OS9 Community Network secretary
is putting a semi-serious crimp in the activities of the BOD. John Wight (Int'l
Co-ordinator) has taken to wearing the secretary's hat as well as his own.

 John Wight has made a motion for Tika Carr to take on the job of editor of the
monthly NewsLetter for the organisation. He calls on her to prove herself
worthy of the position, verbally, (that is, to tell the BOD what she thinks she
can offer in skills to the position), [which is kinda like Reuben asking a
newcomer how s/he justifies his/her existence, in Isaac Asimov's BLACK WIDOWER
Mystery Stories].

 He also has a thought, about the way it is currently working out. Dave Kelly
is the acting Editor right now, until someone else can take over. Tom Birt,
Region 10 Library Co-ordinator, has had a hand in making sure the newsletter,
and other Community related output, is correct in spelling, grammer and syntax.
 Since Dave has made it clear that his position was only to be temporary, it
seems that the election will be between Tika Carr and Tom Birt. John's idea was
that when one of them gets elected, the other will be their assistant. [You
just can't lose, eh?]

EDITORIAL:
 Since I volunteered for the honour of reporting on the activities of the OS9
Community Network Board Of Directors Echo to the general membership, and in
doing so, placed a severe limitation on myself by standing firmly on the policy
of my not posting any messages on that echo, so as not to clutter up said echo
with messages by a non-voting entity, I find myself frustrated with some of the
things which are (not) occuring.
 I imagine John Wight, out of official curiousity, wanted to know just how many
of the BOD were actually reading the BOD ECHO within a given period. He posted
a message around the last week of January, for people to take part in a roll
call. As of this writing (2392) about half of the BOD has responded. 50% of the
BOD have yet to speak up!

 After giving the above some careful re-consideration, perhaps I am being
unfair on the hard working people who make up the BOD. After all, this
organisation is a not-for-profit venture...no one is getting paid for their
efforts. It (the OS9CN) is just a way for Computer Geeks to get together with
other Computer Geeks to discuss and expand interest in their mutual Compu-Love,
OS9. Nothing important in the Universal Scheme of Things, right? No Big Deal.
 Well, maybe. But for some of us, it is rather important. And we would not be
participating in this exchange of information if it weren't.
 Exciting things can happen if people join forces and work on a way to make
life easier and/or more interesting for themselves and for others. I believe
this was the major reason the OS9CN was put together.
 But, I also feel that, in order to make great things happen, it is not enough
to have yourself labeled "A Member of The Board"; you have to participate. If
you don't, then please, allow those who may have more interest in the matter
take the position and help get things done.
 With that in mind...you will have read of certain positions within the BOD
coming available, (ie, Int'l Librarian, NewsLetter Editor, Secretary). These
positions are open to ALL, and not just to existing members of the Board. If
you think you would like to run for one of these openings, by all means,
contact John Wight! He will be keeping a tally of prospective candidates, and
when the time comes, will be putting the matters up for a vote.     
Participate!

B.O.D. ACTIVITY:
 Since I last reported, there have been some serious changes. Tika Carr, newly
appointed Editor for the OS9CNetNews, was suddenly taken ill, and has expressed
her desire to resign her position due to this sudden change in health status.
She will be sorely missed. I, personally, wish her the best of luck.

 John Wight, International Co-ordinator, has brought up a couple of motions to
vote on. 1) Should the BOD accept Tom Birt as the new NewsLetter Editor. 2)
Specific voting procedures. 3) The formation of a commitee to delegate tasks in
the job jar. 4) The formation of a commitee, composed mainly of librarians, to
   compile a master list of available files from the various regional
   libraries, headed by Gene Clifton.

 Discussion on how long a position held by a member of the BOD should remain
inactive before the position is deemed open for a replacement. (In other words,
how long should a holder of a position within the BOD keep that position if
there is no descernible participation observed.)

 A couple of new faces have shown up in the echos, and it seems they are from
Australia. The BOD is working on getting a reliable gateway with them. We are
getting truely international!


EDITORIAL:
 The OS9 Community Network is a non-profit organisation developed by the CoCo
community to promote OS9 and to further and keep interest in this Operating
System.
 Contrary to certain beliefs, this does not mean that the OSCN is strictly
limited to those interested in CoCo OS9 Level II, only! In fact, due to the
"new" 680X0 machines which are becoming increasingly more popular, (MM/1 by
Interactive Media Systems, Inc., Tomcat by Frank Hogg Labs, System IV by
Delmar), interest in OS9 is growing. Also, keep in mind that there are versions
of OS9 for the IBM, Atari and Macintosh computers.

       [A Gilligan's Island-type vision suddenly fades to...]
 Three years ago, I was happily pecking my way across the keyboard of my new
128k CoCo3. I was content with typing in programs from The Rainbow, and running
basic and machine-language programs I had downloaded from various BBSes across
the country, (much to the consternation of my girlfriend when she saw the phone
bills). I bought up all the books and magazines I could find having to do with
Basic. When I had the money, I would truck on down to one of the local Radio
Shacks, to see what I could blow my cash on.
 One day, I bought OS9 Level II. Took it home, and booted it up. I made many
mistakes. But, because I only had 128k, OS9 left me with something like 48k of
free memory. Can't do much with that, so I shelved OS9, and went back to my
familiar RS-Dos Basic programming.

 Later, I happened to run across a semi-local BBS run on a CoCo3 with 512k and
OSs9 Level II. After talking with the SysOp, Jim, he said his BBS was
"homemade"; he had programmed it himself under Basic09. This impressed me.
About a month later, he sold me a 512k memory upgrade and a second 40 track
floppy drive. He had been into the CoCo since the CoCo1, and OS9 since Level I.
He incouraged me to take my OS9 Level II off the shelf, and fire it up. I did,
but because I was still making mistakes with it (simple 216 errors, File Not
Found), I was reluctant to use it. I told him that I was happy with RS-Dos, and
didn't need OS9. I had everything I need under Basic. No amount of persuasion
could change my mind. What did I need with multiple windows? Why would I ever
need to multi-task? I have trouble walking and chewing gum at the same time.

 However, one day, I got bored, and booted up that OS9, and created a couple of
windows, just curious to see what the excitement was about. I changed the color
of them, did a dir in one and listed the Startup file in another at the same
time. Hmmmm....What if I...
 Jim was a big help to me, but he was still long distance, and I had to learn
quite a bit on my own. I didn't have access to Delphi, or the other pay
services. I was the only active OS9 user in my area.
     [Another Gilligan's Island-type vision fades back to...]
 Now, I hardly ever use Rs-Dos. And thanks to the OS9CN, I can learn more about
this fascinating Operating System.
 The OS9CN understands stories such as the one above. That was one of the
reasons people formed the organisation: to help others understand OS9, and to
encourage people to try it.
 But, they also respect those die-hard Rs-Dos users. In fact, the OS9CN is an
excellent supplimental support for all phases of the CoCo; Rs-Dos, OS9,
whatever! (Even Hard-Core Os9'ers had to start somewhere!)
 Sooner or later, you might get bored, too, and boot up OS9, just for
curiousity's sake. When you do, remember that the OS9 Community Network is here
for you!

 A motion has been made and seconded for a monthly Department-Head meeting.

EDITORIAL:
 There seems to be a certain opinion out there in CoCoLand that the OS9CN is
strictly a FIDONet-bound organisation. There is some justification for this
opinion, but this is not necessarily so.
 The fact is, when people began tossing ideas around about starting a "club" to
take the place of the now-defunct National OS9 Users Group, the majority of the
discussion took place in the FidoNet. Much of the activities of this growing
and evolving Community is still happening within FidoNet. It is not because the
BOD wants to keep it that way, but because it is most convenient.
 FidoNet is not a pay service, (such as C-serve or Delfi [deliberate
misspellings]), but it is the cheapest way for people who live thousands of
miles apart, to communicate with each other. (Well, there is Snail-Mail, but
FidoNet is more reliable).
 There has been an ongoing intent to get the OS9CN into other publicly
accessible media. C-serve and Delfi are just two of them. There has been some
success with Uucp and the Internet, as evidenced by our new Australian (and
Belgian, etc...) members.
 And while I am talking about OtherNets, Our Fearless Leader, Int'l Coordinator
for the OS9CN, John Wight, has finally gotten his InterNet address. If you have
access to InterNet, you may mail him at:

If you know of anyone who wants more info on our nifty organisation, and they
have access to InterNet, but don't have access to FidoNet, this will probably
be the route they should go.
 John is also doing some intense research in getting info through to STGnet,
ACBBS, and RIME. [I never heard of this last, but, the more, the merrier!]
 The plain and simple truth of it is, there is just so darn much to do, and not
a whole lot of people to do it. We, as a community, must rely on ourselves to
get the message out to those who may not have access to the various nets. The
BOD cannot do it alone.
 Another hard, cold fact, is that no one is getting paid for their efforts in
trying to get this organisation into shape. Right now, all of the Board of
Directors are vollunteers. Almost all of the positions that make up the BOD are
open for elections, RIGHT NOW! The people who are in those positions are doing
so as acting members of the Board. As you can see in the section labled CURRENT
B.O.D. ACTIVITY, nominations for Secretary, Membership Coordinator,
International Co-Coordinator, and NewsLetter Editor have been heard and are
currently being voted on. What this means, is that the rest of the positions
are waiting for you to fill them.

If I were very nostalgic, I could say the OS-9 Community Network started when I
purchased my first computer (an MC-10) in 1984. I liked this inexpensive
computer so much, I gradually moved up to a very complete COCO 3 OS-9 Level 2
system.

Or perhaps it got its start when I went to a community college for two years to
earn my Associate of Technical Arts Degree in Computer Repair. It was there I
first experienced the excitement of sharing my computer knowledge and
experience by running a BBS on a Tandy Model 3 with a 300 baud modem and four
single sided floppy drives. I enjoyed it so much, I started dreaming and began
to plan my own BBS which went online a few years later.

However this is the OS-9 "COMMUNITY" Network. There are many others in the COCO
and OS-9 community who made it special, and have helped us to develop what is
now becoming the OS-9 Community Network. For example, if it weren't for Lonnie
Falk, Dale Puckett, and many others who had a part in Rainbow Magazine, many of
us might never have gotten started with the COCO and OS-9, and come to realize
what a powerful operating system OS-9 Level 2 really is - and at a steal price.
Over the years, Lonnie told us many stories in the Rainbow about how it grew
from some ideas and a couple of pieces of paper to a thick magazine that kept
many of us in touch with the COCO and OS-9 community for many years. It is this
community that kept the Rainbow going strong for so long.

Then as the online COCO and OS-9 community evolved, Rainbow was getting thinner
in pages, some of our favorite COCO and OS-9 experts left the Rainbow, and many
hardware and software companies stopped advertising in its pages.

Around the same time Rainbow started getting thinner, a community of COCO and
OS-9 users started getting together on FIDONET, a worldwide amateur network of
over 10,000 BBS systems. Many of us learned that it is an excellent, and cheap
(in some cases free) place to keep in touch with COCO and OS-9 experts, and
other members of our very friendly community. New users found they could get
questions answered in a day or two (or less), learn where to get software,
hardware, and the support that they were lacking from Tandy and other sources.

After I had experienced the wonder and power of OS-9 Level 2 for a while, with
its multitasking and windows, I learned about RiBBS which was written to be
FIDONET compatible. So I decided to join the FIDONET network to further my
aspirations of being a supporting member of our special community. After seeing
Tandy drop its support for the COCO and OS-9 markets, and seeing that Rainbow
was getting smaller yet, I decided to look for more ways to support this
community and do my part to help keep it alive. I eventually took on the job of
echo moderator for the FIDONET COCO and OS9 conferences, and continued to share
my knowledge and experience of OS-9 with other users, and I continue to do my
best to ensure that our community stays friendly.

Then ideas started coming in on the echos. Some wondered what Microware would
do with OS-9 when Tandy quit its support. Someone mentioned the possibility of
its release to a non profit group. So we thought, why not release it to members
of the largest amateur network in the world. (We still have yet to see if this
will be.) We also discussed the possibilities of routing and echoing files to
OS-9 BBS systems in the same way FIDONET echo messages are efficiently routed
at low cost.

It was these ideas and many more discussed among members of this special
community that is currently evolving into the OS-9 Community Network. My dream
is to see it grow into the best group of quality computer users in support of
one of the best operating systems in the world, just as Lonnie Falk's 4 page
newsletter grew into a magazine that educated many of us to the vast potential
of the COCO and OS-9 Level 2 in a mostly MS-DOS world. Just as Rainbow is now
starting to include information on the new machines designed to be an upgrade
to the COCO, we will be upgrading to include information on the new machines
and OSK as well.

I wish to thank all of you in the COCO and OS-9 community, as it is you that
has helped us to keep our favorite computer and operating system alive. I would
like to thank many individually, such as sysops who offered their BBS systems,
software authors, hardware hackers, Rainbow staff, CIS and Delphi members - I
could go on and on, but there are just too many to list that helped us to get
where we are today. In apreciation, I offer to all members of our special
community the OS-9 Community Network. m

Well,

Here's hoping that the final version of windows that Kev releases for
distribution 'accidentally' cures this problem as well!

 I hope to have my last paddle board by Monday. With that installed, I'll move
the terminal to /t1 and see if the problem moves with it. IF it does, since
both ports are manged by the 901 driver, I'd have to say we've found the
culprit.

Thanks for whatever advice you can offer.

Carl,

Thanks for reviewing the thread!

I've moved the terminal to /t3 and found no problem at all. Incidentally,
during the swap, the modem ended up on /t2. Trying to call CIS after that was
interesting. A 'fuzzy' box appears as soon as sterm fires up and then it's
dropped character city.

Reminded me of the IRQ problem with the CoCo at high speed.

Dropping the baud rate from 2400 to 1200 had no noticeable effect.

Once I get a few more of the seral ports easily available (Mark's making a few
cables for me), I'll investigate this a bit more. Still could be nothing more
that a flow control issue. I've found my PPI modem to be a bit contrary in
somme situations. :-)

Sb: #HMI, CIS, and all that
Fm: James Jones 76257,562
To: All

Greetings.  I should say here right up front that what follows is purely my
personal opinion.

A couple or so years ago I first ran into an article in *Online Today* that
described a program for the Macintosh that let one's Macintosh communicate with
CIS via "HMI," Host-Micro Interface, so that the user interacted with the
program (Navigator, I believe it's called), and the program in turn interacted
with CIS.

Gee, I said, this is nice--and sent feedback asking whether a specification for
HMI would be available for download as the GIF format is.  I've asked that
question repeatedly from time to time over the past few years.  In the
meantime, CompuServe has come out with CIM, a program for PClones that uses
HMI.

I've gotten various answers, but it sure looks like CompuServe intends to keep
it proprietary.

Some replies have said HMI is Very Complicated, and not just anybody could
write a program to use it.  (Funny, I can get freely-copyable parser
generators, compilers, text editors, communications programs.  Is HMI more
complicated than all of those?)  Others have implied that CompuServe will
eventually be more forthcoming.

I guess what's set me off about this is that CompuServe has recently adopted a
new pricing plan, supposedly in response to Prodigy and other information
utilities--but this flat rate plan specifically excludes the forums. It would
be nice if someone could write a program to efficiently access CIS; HMI would
be a considerable help with this.  (Text-oriented programs like TAPCIS could,
in theory, be fooled--after all, I could Store Unformatted a message that
contains text indistinguishable from CIS prompts, right?) Doesn't look like
this can happen, though; CIS is keeping HMI proprietary, and unless you have a
Mac or a PClone, you're out of luck.

Over on PRICEFORUM, I've said I'd hang around for six months, to see whether
CompuServe comes around.  If they don't, I'm out of here.  See you on Delphi.

There is 1 Reply.

James,

First off, I can't believe that the only thing that's going to make the
difference between you accessing the forum here or not (never mind what you do
on the other services - there's no loyalty oath you've gotta take, so you're
certainly free to use more than one service! <g>) is the availability of the
HMI specs.

I personally don't see the HMI specs being released to the public in any
forseable future.  I can understand the thinking that might produce such a
business decision.  I can also understand the thinking that says that something
so neat and groovy shouold be released to everyone, everywhere.

Shades of the old-time spirit of the original hackers!

Be that as it may...  if you've got a problem with the new pricing scheme not
including the forums, be sure and let CompuServe know via FEEDBACK. If enough
folks say the right things, who knows what might happen.

Finally... back on the HMI. IF you do decide to abstain from CompuServe and
patronize Delphi exclusively, what you'll find (other than pricing differences)
is a TTY-like interface that puts you into the same interactive mode as
CompuServe.

It appears as if there are two totally unrelated things that have gotten under
your skin.

Wayne
