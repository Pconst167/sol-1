Paul,

 .AR files have been archived with 'AR'.

You can get the binary of this archiving tool in LIB 9. Look for AR09.BIN.

Once you have the tool, set the execute bit and type AR -? for a list of the
command line options.

Give a shout if we can be of help.

here is a section of the code I am using.

int rdy_chars;
  .
  .
  .
rdy_chars = _gs_rdy(path);
if (rdy_chars = -1)
  exit(errno);

This exits with Error #000:216
I know I have opened the port properly and I can read and write to it,
because before I call this function I read and write to the remote device
without any problems.  I have declared path globally.  Here is the section
that comes before the function call:

int path;

main (argc, argv)
int argc;
char **argv;
{
  .
  .
  .
  if ((path = open("/t1", S_IREAD+S_IWRITE)) = -1) {
    error ...
  } else {
    read(path, in_line, 1);
    ...
    write(path, temp, strlen(temp));
    ...
  }
  ...
}
In this section it is ok to what for data to become available, and it
works the way it is expected.  in_line is char in_line[300], temp is
char temp[80].
Thank you for your help.

David:

If the code is EXACTLY as you have entered, the problem may be that the

 if (rdy_chars = -1)

is ASSIGNING -1 to the variable.  Try

 if( rdy_chars == -1 )

That should get by the wiping out of the _gs_rdy() return value at least.

I see that the open() call in main() has the same error as well.  Change the =
-1 to == -1.  C will do ASSIGNMENT with =.  Testing for equality is done with
==.

Geeze I had better check that !!  The truth is I know better too.
I might have just forgotten the == when I typed the message up here.
I did use the == in the open, yepp that was the problem with _gs_rdy().
I had made a couple of changes at the time I did that (I was checking
to see if it was > 0 before, but I wanted to know if there was an error).
I also just finished a Pascal course and I have to keep myself straight
now.  (I know ...  excuses, excuses)

A hint that I learned in my C course last year might be helpful.....

If you type  (c = 1) instead of (c == 1), the compiler will NOT notify you of
an error.

If, on the other hand, you type (1 = c) instead of (1 == c), the ccompiler will
kick the first one back as an illegal declaration.

C doesn't know the difference, but the compiler sure will....

Kevin,
      I just had an idea today, that I thought I would throw at you and see
what you think. You know how I have been bugging you about a SS_Tone syscall
for the MM/1, well maybe one isn't needed. I was thinking about the IFF sound
calls,(SS_Play & SS_Record), and how they take analog input, digitize it for
storage in memory or take that stored digitized info and convert it to analog
for output. The thing is, that at one point in the recording or playing process
this audio info is just a bunch of bytes, set to a particular value. With this
in mind, couldn't we just have a sound editor type program that would generate
the frequency, amplitude and wave shape data for the sounds, and output the
result into an IFF sound file.
 The main point going for doing it this way is that the processor wouldn't be
bogged down trying to generate these sounds, and it could take its own sweet
time in building up the IFF sound file.
  This idea sounds so simple to me that I must be over looking something.
  Has this idea already been kicked around ? Its so simple that someone must
have come up with it already, I just havn't heard any mention of it.

To: all

NEW PRODUCT FEELER

After we do the EK-VAK video board for the KiX\30 we are planning to do a high
resolution (1024x768) SVGA type video board. The preliminary basic specs are:

     32 Bit SVGA Graphics chip (fast)
     VGA thru SVGA resolutions with millions of colors
          (640, 800, 1024 by 400, 600, 768)
     512K to 1 Meg on board RAM
     mono sound output
     DB9 Serial mouse
     AT keyboard port.
     Uses standard monitors

This is similar to the EK-VAK. But with higher resolution and much faster speed
because of the 32 bit capability  We are considering leaving the DMA stereo
sound off for cost and board space reasons. This would keep the cost close to
the EK-VAK board. A trade of high resolution and speed for loss of DMA stereo.
We could do a separate sound board if there was demand for it. This new board
would not work with the CM8 and Magnavox monitors that work with the
EKVAX/CoCo/TC70/MM1. Monitors for this new board are readily available and
inexpensive. DMA stereo sound would add about $100 to the cost, if it would
fit.

With all this in mind I would like feedback from you on this board. We are
planning to start layout in two weeks with production in December.

What do you think?

Fm: Frank Hogg of FHL 70310,317
To: all

NEW PRODUCT FEELER

Mike and I were talking about the 8K battery backed RAM that is on the KiX\30.
Among other things we talked about is that this RAM can be used in conjunction
with the power fail circuit on the MB to store vital system information. We
rambled on about a variety of uses when we discussed using it as a mini RAM
disk. It would only be 32 sectors but if we did a simple variation of the 'ram'
driver it could be done. This conversation started running a bit wild when I
asked about doing a battery backed RAM board for the bus. Mike added that he
had been thinking of a EPROM board for the bus so we combined both ideas and
came up with the following:

     Full 32 bit, full speed card
     4 banks of 4 32K chips. (128K per bank, 512K total)
     Use Static RAM
     Use Battery backed Static RAM
     Use EPROM

The above options would be via jumper or DIP switch for each block.

     On board battery and a connector for off board battery.
     Max of 4 boards in the system. (2 Meg)

Each bank of 4 chips would have to be the same type. But each bank could be
different.The off board battery connector would allow larger capacity batteries
for extended use. Useful if the on board battery was too small.

For example:

     You could have one bank of EPROM (128K) for OSK
     Two banks of static RAM for runtime use. (256K)
     One bank of battery backed RAM for a RAM disk.
          (128K, 512 sectors.

Other combinations could be used. You could also have up to 4 boards in the
system. For speed freaks Static RAM is 10-20% faster than Dynamic RAM.

The projected cost would be $200 for a zero K board.


What do you think?

In "C", is there a call such that you can call a routine from a jump table? For
example, if you had an array    int *list[10], for example, then in the
program, is there a call where if you wished to execute the routine pointed to
by list[5], the program could do a "jsr ..."?
   Seems like I've seen this somewhere, but if so, I can't remember how it was
done.
   Oh, I'm referring to the CoCo version of "C".
