Thanks.  I assume getopt is in fact a function, that I can find somewhere. I
see the OS9 clib.l stuff in LIB 3, where is OSK equivalent, or should I work up
the sources from LIB 3?

Fm: Colin J. Smith 73777,1360
To: Bob Palmer 74646,2156

The way INKEY works (at least on the MM/1's version of BASIC) is that it
returns a value if there is something in the keyboard buffer.  You then have to
use GET to find out what it is.

Does this help any?  It's completely different from BASIC-09.  You have to do
something like this:

a=inkey(#<path>) if a then
   get response; endif

Hope this helps.

Fm: Kevin Darling 76703,4227
To: Bob Palmer 74646,2156

Hi Bob,

Normally, INKEY returns the number of characters waiting (using the SS_Ready
GetStatus call).  So you might say something like...

 DIM k:STRING[1]
 IF INKEY(#0) <> 0 THEN
   GET #0,k
 ENDIF

But the stock TC70 video driver doesn't support SS_Ready (weird! but should be
easy for them to fix), so you get the error 208 (unimplemented stat call)
instead.  There's no easy way around that without using a second process to sit
and read the keyboard for you.

However, if your desired program just needs to get one key at a time, and
doesn't mind waiting for it (instead of actually polling for a key), then you
can just:

 DIM k:STRING[1]
 GET #0,k

And/or you could set up a signal (SS_SSig) to let you know when a key is hit. I
hope one of these ideas will do what you need, until you get another driver
setup.  best - kevin

Fm: Brother Jeremy, CSJW 76477,142
To: All

Dear Friends:


As some of you may know, I have long been hoping that someone would write an
OS9 version of MAX-10. After an absence of several months, the project is on
again. At the present time I have a large collection of PD fonts which I have
gotten from various sources. Some are for First Publisher, some VGA screen
fonts, some are from a Bit-Mapped Fonts package. I am currently working on a
program which will allow me to display these fonts on a graphics screen.

I saw a program in the Feb. '90 issue of PCM (Rainbow's sister magazine) by
Bill Barden (pgs 147ff) which would do just this. It is written in BASIC and I
am converting it to OS9. The program opens a font file as a random fiule and
then reads in 100 bytes at a time. To do so it uses the following instructions:



OPEN #path, FILENAME$ AS #1 LEN=100

FIELD #1, 100 AS B$

I cannot get this to work under OS9. Can anyone help with these lines. Or
perhaps you know of a Basic09 file reader program already uploaded, with
source, that implements this sort of thing. Finally, does anyone know where I
might be able to get information on the file formats that First Publisher uses?
Any help in these matters will be deeply appreciated.

With all good wishes,

Br. Jeremy, CSJW

The approximate BASIC09 equivalent would be something like

 OPEN #path,filename
 GET #path,buf

where you've previously declared

  DIM buf:string[100]

so that the GET statement will get 100 bytes.

Windsor Systems (and Delmar as well) sells a group of utilities called the "Pan
Utilities" that have most of the things that you are looking for like 'tree,'
'whereis,' and 'filefind' (last two are really the same program), and a bunch
of other useful utilities.  A big plus is that you get the C SOURCE as well so
you can fix things that are broke or that you don't like. I you get these, make
sure that you get the version that has the 'fixes from JBM' as we fixed some
problem/bugs/annoyances.  I send in the changed source but have no idea if
they're distributing our fixes.

I don't have their phone number handy here at home, email me if you're

Bill,

I picked Hard Drive International for the memory. Lemme grab the sheet ...

ME 1x8 - 80   1MB SIMM module 80 ns $39.00 each   (they actually shipped 70
ns), and $10 for shipping via FE. At $88 total, I figure I'm still ahead.

Tried to get a Quantum 105 meg drive, but they are back ordered 'till April.
Second choice was a Maxtor .... but also out of stock. Finally settled on a
Connor CP30100 120 meg 19 ms 3.5 1" drive for $369 from Data Storage MArketing,
Inc. (They have the yellow ad around page 35 in Shopper every month.).

The Focus Keyboard I bought didn't work. Thought it was DOA, but works fine in
the XT and AT's at the office, so I'm guessing that it's another one that isn't
compatable with the MM/1. (Northgate's cause problems as well.) I have a
repacement Chicony due in. Hope I do better with that.

Steve, it sure was worth the wait. My Quantum 105 hasn't arrived yet but the
Seagate I have connected is pretty fast. I don't think it's quite fast enough
initializing because I sometimes don't get a successful boot. The problem is
most noticable with the newest drivers using rbvccs. Using the rbsccs driver
that Paul sent me I get more consistent boots. I'm happy with the machine and
have been playing with it quite a bit. Hopefully the new hard drive will solve
the occasional boot problem. By the way, the rb33c93a on my I/O board has mask
#8 and I've told Paul about that. Ernie.

Yeah .... I had wanted the Quantum, but seems I waited too long. Word from
several sources I tried said that Quantum is sending everything they have to
Apple leaving them out in the cold. They have no choice but to recommend other
manufacturers. I opted for a 120 meg Connor. Mark tells me to expect no
problems with that pick.

I sure wish IMS would have a list of 'known to (not) work) hardware. Sure would
save on the telephone calls to Paul's answering machine!

Use MODED to change the "coldstart retry count" to a higher number, maybe 50,
and you should have no more problems.  Don't use the driver you got from Paul,
use the one in the update.

If you have a mask number 8 on the SCSI controller and it actually works, you
are a lucky camper.

I've changed the coldstart retry count several times now. It is now at 150 and
the machine boots from cold start every time now. Still won't boot from a RESET
reliably though. The SCSI chip has the following markings on it:

         WD33C93A
         00-08 9022
         069019200102
         PROTO

I figure the date code is 9022 and the mask is #8. Does the PROTO mean it's 
a prototype? Doesn't matter as long as it works. By the way, I asked Paul
for the demo you were running in Atlanta. He said he'd put it on my hard drive
before he shipped it.

Jim,

The C Source Debugger is much more and much different than a Lint.  From what I
understand it allows you to run you compiled C program much like debug, but
loads in you actual C source too.  You then can step thru it, set break points,
etc. like debug.  The benifit is that you get to see which line of C your are
executing.  I can see a program like that comming in real handy to debug my
source.

Lint, on the other hand, is available from Gimpel Software for $400 to $500 in
what they call 'shrouded' C source.  To get Gimpel's number look in DDJ or the
C user's journal.  If you want more info on Generic-Lint, lemme know.

Have you tried it at all?  I run it all the time.  Haven't used shell in

didn't turn pause off, the first line after a '#' in a script gets eaten, etc.

Well, I finally decided to play with Multivue a bit and put it on a boot disk
along with Shell+ and a bunch of utilities. (Yes, I do have Gshell+ too.) I
know it's been a while and some of this stuff will be really old hat, but I see
that MV changes the default palette colors that are used when I open a window.
This plays a bit of heck with some of my other window operation.

So, the first question is, can I change these defaults back again after leaving
MV and going back to a normal shell?

And, while typing this message, I also see that MV changes the keyboard repeat
and delay on a system wide basis that also sticks after it is gone. Can I put
these back without rebooting? Or, better yet, can I change them without MV.

Finally, does MV pull any nasty tricks to change palette and keyboard
constants, or are these legal system calls?

You can set all that stuff by selecting the Control option on the Tandy menu.

Yes, MV set's all those things legally.  Thru a I$SetStt call.  I believe it's

It looks complete to me. There is no C editor... You just use whatever text
editor you're comfy with. I used to use Dynastar.

In addition to there being replacement libraries, there's also a replacement
'CC' command here. That may help some with the documentation. Also, if you have
a RAMDISK set up, the new CC will use it for a scratch area, and that will make
compiles a LOT quicker.

To:  72176,3565 (X)

I felt guilty about the last remark on bus trap errors.  I should put up or
shutup so to speak.  I find the problem in line 145 of my version of whereis.c,
which reads as follows:

        if( s = index( s, '"' ) ) *s = '\0';

It should be changed to:

        if( s = index( as, '"' ) ) *s = '\0';

The value of "s" gets set to zero two lines earlier by an unsuccessful index
function.  The memory management objects to the access to address 0 in line
145, and causes a bus trap error.  Nicely enough, the value of "s" was saved
earlier in "as", for proper use later, and can also be used here in line 145,
thus "s" is changed to "as" in line 145.

The microware source level debugger (srcdbg) helps greatly in tracking these
problems, and running programs under memory management with srcdbg sure makes
these problems easier to find.

HELP, I have a nice new Epson LQ-570 printer hooked up to my MM/1, all I can
get it to do is print one character of garbage, the the printing process goes
to sleep, never to awaken again.... its a hell of a time to take a NAP!?!?! any
deep thoughts? btw. I've tried using both the stock sc68230 driver, Bob van der
Poel's sc68230 driver, both drivers that came in the MM1update.ar pack, (altho
I haven't tried using more that 1 driver at a time yet... I'll do that next)..
oh, and FWIW. yes, I used the right /p for any given driver... (well most of
the time anyway)... any help would be, um,      helpful... (I have to have a
report typed (and printed) by Fri.)

btw. for anyone who is thinking about buying a printer, the Epson LQ-570 sure
is neat, does a bunch of fonts, has scalable fonts, 24 pin 360x360 dpi, 8k
buffer, makes coffee, etc.. if only it would PRINT! well I sapose ya cant have
everything, but who ever heard of a printer that wont print? whats the point?

Ken,

How long a cable are you using?  Anything more than about 6 or 8 feet,
depending upon the printer, does not work very well or at all on the MM/1
printer ports.  Try a shorter cable and see what it does.

Ken -

Have you tried dragging it to a friend's house and hanging it off of a PC
clone? That might clear or finger the printer.

Kevin,

Is there a way to select the window a program is going to run in? You helped me
out some time ago to do this on the coco; but now I want to do the same thing
on the MM/1. I want to have a line like:

   (display 1b 21 ; /dd/games/mygame) <>>>/w

so that the program starts in a new window and that window is displayed. Also,
it'd be nice to return to the calling window when 'mygame' is finished.

Thanks

Hi Bob,

Welllll :-), that's interesting.  From a program, it's easy to do the 1B21
select, as the system will store away its input preference.  Doing it from a
command line turns out to be slightly more difficult...

Partly because I check only for standard output's preference (I just changed
this, thanks for the thought!), and that was because the OSK shell lacks the
6809 version's "</1" type of redirection (for running from scripts).

Anyway, the upshot is that you'll need to send the Select to stderr to make it
work right from shell lines in current versions.  Easy enough: pack a new Basic
command:

 procedure winsel
 print #2,chr$($1b)+chr$($21);
 end

Then you _should_ be able to do a "(cls;winsel;program) <>>>/w" and have it pop
to that window.  The next line in a script file could be to winsel the original
window.. executed when the program dies, of course.

Let me know what happens.  Thanks!! - kevin

Dear Friends:

I am currently converting a program from BASIC to BASIC09. The Basic program
contains the line

C=INSTR(A$,CHR$(27)+")s")

A$ is 100 bytes of a font file. CHR$(27) or $1B is a control/escape code. ANd
")s" does something or other. (How's that for accurate terminology?)

I know that under COCO BASIC, the command would search a string, and then
return the location of the target string in a search string. For example:

INSTR(position,search-string,target)

I cannot find an exact command for INSTR under BASIC09. Pg 11-164 of the Level
II guide gives an example of a command called SUBSTR. I am not sure if this
will do what I need.

Any suggestions?

With all best wishes,

Br. Jeremy, CSJW

Brother Jeremy,

As you've probably figured out by now, yep, SUBSTR does what you want.  So I
guess the rough equivalent to search for "thisword" in A$ is:

 BASIC:    C = INSTR(A$,"thisword")
 BASIC09:  C = SUBSTR("thisword",A$)

Now, if you have to start the search at a certain position, then you can use
MID$ to get there, but have to add back the starting offset if found:

           STARTPOS = 5
 BASIC:    C = INSTR(STARTPOS,A$,"thisword")
 BASIC09:  C = SUBSTR("thisword",MID$(A$,STARTPOS,100))
           IF C<>0 THEN C=C+STARTPOS-1 \ ENDIF

I believe these are equivalent... but test to be sure.  BTW, the "100" was
arbitrarily picked as the max size of any string.  You may (or may not) need to
change that.  Depends on how large A$ can be.  If the string is smaller, it'll
just ignore the extra amount, and all will be okay.

best - kevin

Sb: MM/1 Update Module Fix
Fm: Mark Griffith 76070,41
To: All

To all MM/1 owners with the module update:

Apparently a mistake was made in making the update archive and the wrong
descriptors were included.  A new set of descriptors are being made up now, but
until then you should be able to get your new drivers working by changing one
vale using the DMODE utility supplied in the archive.

Use DMODE to change the rate byte to $30 for any high density disk except the
hpcx IBM disk descriptors and $10 for all double (or low) density disks.  This
should correct the problem.  Let me know if you still hahve trouble,

I have downloaded STERM and extracted it twice, I have extracted other fi
without problems, and am unable to use STERM.  I keep getting ERROR 234 Module
Not Found.  After many tries, INDENT returns a bad module header. Am I doing
something wrong here? Or do I need something else? Thanks, Mark

Mark,

The module not found error is probably because Sterm is looking for the /t2
module.  If you don't have one in your bootfile, and the ACIAPAK driver that
goes with it, you won't be able to run Sterm.  Look for that descriptor and
driver and see if including them doesn't help.

BTW:  Which version of Sterm did you get?  Ver. 1.5.1??  Which module are you
giving to Sterm on the command line?  Should be 'sterm -l /tx' where 'x' is the
number of your serial port.

   I was going to leave you a message about the problem I was having with the
newest drivers. However, I just read msg. 14207 so I'll make the needed changes
with dmode. Thanks for the support.
