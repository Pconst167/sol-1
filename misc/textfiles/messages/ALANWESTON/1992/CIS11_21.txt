Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: Hard drives

Does anyone have any advise concerning Hard Drives for the mm/1. I'm thinking
of getting a 2nd and am considering a Maxtor 130mg. They are advertised for
around $325--is this a good deal? Anyone have any experince particular brand?

When I read the ads, I'm a bit confused by SCSI, SCSI-2 and (if I recall)
SCSI-S. Any difference? Will '2' work on the mm/1?

Any help appreciated...

I know of no particular brand that is better or worse than any one else.

SCSI and SCSI-2 will work just fine.  Never heard of SCSI-S.  Only difference
between SCSI and SCSI-2 is the theoretical max transfer rate and some extra
SCSI commands unique to the SCSI-2 command set.  Nothing that will effect its
performance in the MM/1.

Thanks for the reply, Mark. Don't know what all the suffixes mean either. I
just found the ad in the Shopper. Nov/92, page 671 'Direct Drives' have a list
of stuff. The drives are labeled 'SCSI', 'SCSI-S', 'SCSI-2' and 'SCSI-2F'.
Opps, no plain 'SCSI'--maybe '-S' means plain?

Bob,

When I went looking for a hard drive for the MM/1, my first choice was the
Quantum that Mark was talking up. Unfortunately ... they were way way out of
stock and didn't have any idea when any more would show up. Something about
allocations all going to Apple.

My next choice was a Maxtor drive. I have a good feeling about Maxtor as my
company is a vendor of theirs. I have had very good dealings with their
engineering department as well as their purchasing agent. HAving talent there
speaks well of an organization, IMHO.

Unfortunately ... at the time HDI was also out of stock on the size I needed.

I ended up with a Connor 120 meg and have been very please. THe price I paid
was in the same neighborhood you're speaking about.

Using the 2nd mouse button is out.  Kev's grabbed it for cutting and pasting

name in the .TRASH dir.  Also added you double-click editor thing.  So far it
seems dandy.  The Utils menu will be filled with all sorts of System info utils
like Procs, MDir, MFree and Free.  Any utils you feel are essensial?

Is this in there to stay?  I thought you didn't like the idea?  What about
forking the shell?  I mentioned that apparently you only look at the shell
environment variable when forking a shell to execute a script.  What is needed,
I'd suppose, is a variable for what shell to fork for an interactive session
and what to fork for a script.

Keep that work coming!!

Depends how well you, Steve and I like it.  I'm not sure how to make shell

It now uses the SHELL env var for all shell access, including forking basic

automatically for it that way?

I like it, but if it means I can't click on a shell script to run it, then I'd
rather not have it in there.  My original idea was to have Desktop check the
execute attribute on the file and run it if it was set, otherwise pull it into
the editor.  If this is not possible, then I'd rather have it set to run the
file by default.  An alternative would be to allow the user to 'Open' the file
into the editor.

 > It now uses the SHELL env var for all shell access, including forking basic

Is this set in the version I have (last one you uploaded)?  No, smersh doesn't
understand BASIC i-code, and I'm sure sh and csh don't either. Could you make
two environment variables, say SHELLRUN and SHELLINTER and let the user pick
what they want?  For the BASIC i-code problem, again, you should be able to
look at the module header of the file and see it is an i-code file and then run
BASIC directly.

I know this makes more work for you, but I really believe you need to make this
as user setable as possible.  The more little touches you add like this, the
more positive response you will get from your users.

On another note, if you want me to do your docs, you should be sending me
something soon so I can get started.

Hey Robert, I remember reading about the Denning Mobile Robots back in the
early 80's.  I built a mobile robot for my Master's thesis then only it was a
great deal cheaper and did the same thing (I used 6800 chips). If I had to do
it over I would have used a 68K chip and OSK. I had lots of fun building it and
got a great deal of press coverage as well.  I used optical shaft encoders and
ultrasonic transducers for range, orientation, and object detection. See ya!

Fm: Graham Ullrich/C.B.,CO 76506,2037
To: All

I'm searching for a commercially supported source of the GNU C++ compiler (and
related tools) that is ported to _both_ the OS-9 and OS-9000 operating systems.
I need both because our product development is done in OS-9000 on PCs, and
ported to OS-9 running on a 68xxx host platform.  The latest stable version of
this compiler is around 2.1 or 2.2, with the newest release v2.3? still acting
up (bugs).  Any help locating such a "support" company would be appreciated.

P.S.  I realize that GNU source code is free, but since the Free Software
Foundation doesn't directly support OS-9/OS-9000, I think using another company
who give the ported source for free and sells "support" for the compiler system
is the best way to go for my company.

Graham:
   The only version of gcc/g++ for OS-9/68000 that I know of is gcc V1.37,
which is available on the InterNet fromcabrales.cs.wisc.edu.

I think the OSK source code is there.  It requires 4 or 5 meg of RAM to
compile. There is no port of gdb and the gcc code does not generate the
necessary debug info for MicroWare's SRCDBG to be very usefull.  Gcc and G++ do
work reasonable well though.

MicroWare has recently come out with a a full ANSI C compiler (Ultra C).  I
don't know if a C++ front end is in the works or not...

I don't think gcc 2.2 has been ported to any flavor of OS-9 (OS-9/68K orr
OS-9000/386).  I don't think the present version of gcc/g++ has been ported to
OS-9000/386.  (The present version for OSK uses the MicroWare assembler and
linker, so making cross version should not be an imposible task, just some
work.)

Well, if you are correct, that seems to rule out my use of the GNU compiler for

I don't know what would be involved in either porting gdb to OS-9/68K and/or
OS-9000 or what would be needed to get gcc to spit out SRCDBG compatable debug
info.

It should not be an imposible task to port gcc to generate 80386 code for
OS-9000 (gcc/g++ does exist for '386 UNIX and '386 MS-DOS).  I guess you would
need to diddle with the assembly code generator to generate the correct format
for r86 (or whatever the OS-9000/386 assembler is called).  All doable.  But
you may have to do it yourself -- this tends to be the case with FSF systems.

Microware is shipping their Ultra C compiler (ANSI) for OS9 now and within a
few weeks should have their OS9000 Ultra C shipping.  I've recently started
using the OS9 Ultra C within the past few days.  I could give a better reaction
later, but so far looks good.  ANSI mode will help in writing more bug-free
code, portability goes up greatly.

Chris,

The split so far is about 50/50 but I suspect it will drift more towards
business/industrial users as time goes on.

Re TC70 vs KiX\30. Since we introduced the KiX\30 we have not sold ANY TC70s!

Once the KiX\30 sale ends at the end of the year the TC70 sales may pick up. As
we are a market driven company the market will determine what machines we will
continue to make. So far the KiX\30 has caused us to discountinue the QT PC30
and QT 30/16. (Both can be easily replaced by the more powerful and less
expensive KiX\30) When we get a call on the TC70 and tell the caller about the
KiX\30 all interest in the TC70 fades away. Even though it is several hundred
dollars more expensive. (The KiX\30 is actually less expensive than a expanded
TC70) One of these days I must get around to making up a chart that compares
the two. Maybe when sales slow down. <g>

You can't "get onto Internet", although you can route mail over it to parties
that have addresses.

Example: to send me mail at US West, address the mail message thusly -

 >INTERNET:plyall@uswest.com

My actual address is 'plyall@uswest.com'... the >INTERNET: alerts the CIS mail
router that it's to be sent to the Internet.

Lee,

Pete's got you sending mail over the Internet ... here's what you need to do to
receive mail.

Your User Id is the ticket. For you to receive mail via the Internet in you
CMAIL box, folks will need to address you as 74726.1752@compuserve.com  .

Note the dot, rather than the comma ... it's required.

You may also want to take a peek at CCLIST.TXT in LIB 1. It details how to
receive the CoCo List via CMAIL.

Also be aware, Internet mail is billed differently under the BASIC plan. If you
plan on doing a lot of traffic this way, the Standard Billing plan may be
better suited. Go RATES for more info.

Also, inside CompuServe Mail, type HELP INTERNET for some detailed online help.
