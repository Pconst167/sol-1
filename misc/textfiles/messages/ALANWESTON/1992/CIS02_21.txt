Does anyone know if CRC in Montreal is still manufacturing DISTO products?  If
so, could someone provide me with their address?
After a few years of ignoring my COCO III I dug it all out and decided to
re-learn OS-9 - mostly to get some enjoyable relief from my normal Mess DOS
activities.  I would like to use the COCO for telecom so I need the serial port
adapter for my Super Controller II.

Thanks,

Disto stopped production last year.  But you're not out of luck because you
don't need to get that serial adapter.  Just get a RS-232 pak and a Slot Pak
III multipak equivalent.  Both are available from CoCoPRO!.  You can contact
them by modem at 313 292 4713.  You can also ask them about a used Disto
adapter if you want to.  A fully assembled RS-232 pak will cost $45 and the
Slot Pak $90.  Your SC-II will work fine in the Slot Pak. Put it in Slot B, the
RS-232 pak in Slot X, and you will have Slot A free for something else.

An ANSI compatible C Compiler would be nicer!  Is Microware the only vendor of
C Compilers for the 68000 market?

Never used Gnu C for OSK but do have a political comment!

I believe a bad aspect of distributing major piece of software like Gnu C for
free is it stifles the market place.  May be good for the home computer users
but perhaps the commercial users will suffer because of FSF (lack of support,
outdated technology, and etc).

I downloaded both gpp (C++ compiler) and gcc (ANSI C) from Delphi and I can say
that I am very impressed!  Although I only had these compilers for the last 48
hours, I believe I will be using them from now on.  Also gcc appears to
generate tighter code than Microware C (Don't forget to throw on the optimizer
using the -O option!).

Installing gpp was a little troublesome.  The routine perror() and _flsbuf()
were missing from the C++ library.  Also renamed libgpp.l to gpp.l (gpp.l looks
like a subset of libgpp.l). Currently employing the gpp C++ compiler to
implement computer science concepts encountered in my studies this semester! 
I'll leave a message on Delphi explaining the quirks that I have found so far.

Someone should upload a copy to CIS.  These are great compilers as far as I can
see.

Up on Delphi, there is a C Compiler called the GCC Compiler.

I've only used it a couple of times, but, according to the extensive help file
included in the command, it supports the ANSI standard, including trigraphs,
and has many features the stock MW C Compiler does not have.

The modules, compressed, are about 650,000 bytes -- the largest module being
over 425,000 bytes long.

Had no problem installing it, and it's fairly easy to use.  Wish the dox file
that came with it had the help screen in it, though.

The dox are lacking in what-all this compiler can do, and the only true help is
the '-?'.

The claim made by the folks who originally did lint was that the compiler
shouldn't bother to tell you about questionable constructs, but should do what
it's told and generate code for it even if it looks like a construct that may
be bogus (semantically bogus, e.g. use a variable that may not have been set).

OTOH, these days people expect compilers to do the kind of flow analysis lint
does, though for other reasons, and ANSI prototypes allow some of the error
checking that lint did, so there's less of an argument for a separate lint
program.

Ken,

If you are getting garbage to the printer, it is possible that the printer port
is bad or the little cable from the port to the DB-25 connector is bad. Either
one is not easy to test for.  About the only solution I can think of is to send
the I/O board and the cables to me and I'll check it out.  If you can find a
person close by with an MM/1 and a printer that works, it would help eliminate
some things.

     I may have to call Midwest and order one of those keyboards. One of the

Yeah, I forgot all about the lockout problem. Haven't tried it with a
non-interactive window. And if you switch windows to hit enter so that the
block goes away, well it defeats the purpose of the command <grin>.

Does the same thing happen when you do "(winsel;myprog)<>>>/w"? Since a shell
is being forked to handle the stuff in the line, I guess things are blocked
here too? It would be nice to have an elegant way to handle this. Hmmm, what
about having a prog. open a path to /w, select the new window and then start a 
shell there with "myprog" as a parm? Might be a lot of shells being forked, but
it should work. I just have to write a "open new window, select it and run a
program in it" program. Opps, not that simple. I'd have to close stdin, etc.
first so that the new program can use it's own paths.

Hmmm, and then there is still the problem of returning to the original
screen--esp. if the paths have been closed. Oh, guess they could be duped to
higher numbers... will give this some thought, play and let you know.

Bob,

The lockout comes from a program (like the shell) tieing up a device with a
pending ReadLn.  SCF locks the device so that someone else can't splat
characters on top of whatever you're about to type in.  Just forking a subshell
with "()" doesn't cause a lockout, as it doesn't do any reads while working.

But you're right, "(selwin;myprog)<>>>/w" doesn't work.  That's because none of
those paths are associated with the currently interactive window.

It's easy to get around this when the shell (like the CoCo's) has "</1" and all
the variations (which is no doubt why that was included!).

Hmmm.  The best I can think of right now that works is slightly hardcoded to
work only from /term:

  (cls;selwin >/term;mdir -e)<>>>/w

The ">/term" is kinda like the CoCo's "</1" method.  Except we made "selwin"
send the 1b21 to path 2, and come from path 1.

Sigh.  I think we need a new shell.  Wonder how hard it'd be to do one in
Basic?  :-)   Will work on other ideas, too.  cheers - kev

I tried just using 1b 21 to select a window without a shell, and that didn't
work either. I did the following:

Hit <f9> to confirm that the window was displaying; then back to /term.

To: all

Just thought I'd let you all know the results of some testing I've done with
Carl's new floppy drivers for the mm/1. These tests were done with a Toshiba HD
drive--I'd be interested in knowing if different drives give different results.

First off, I've discovered that I can format 37 sectors and 84 tracks. This is
probably pushing things, and is not something I recommend.

Second, here are some speed tests (I'm just showing the fastest rate at
different sect. counts):

 sects      ilv        k/sec
 36         3          596
 35-28      2          834
 27         1         1043 (not consistant)
 26         1         1390

The penalty for "turbo mode" seems to be pretty expensive.

Now we just have to decide on a standard format for interchange!

Hmmm...could you post dmode output for the various descriptors?  I'm finding
that I can't format /d0 using the new driver, even with the rates field
changed.  Thanks.

Steve,

    I just read your message to James and saw your dmode. I set typ=$27 and
rates=$30. Now everything appears to work normally. I thought I had tried all
the combinations for PD_TYP and PD_Rate on page 3-6 of the V2.4 Release Notes.
No matter. It's working now.

Thanks,

I'm pretty sure typ=$27 is done to make the driver think it's a 8" to get the
3ms step rate.  And to let the driver also know that it's a 3.5" for formatting
purposes.

Mike H. is pretty close.  Type *should* be $26.  But, due to the roms, that
disk won't boot.  If (and only if) you want it to boot, you have to add $01,
the old 8" bit.  This will (I am told) be corrected in a future release of the
roms.  I made all the distribution desctriptors that way to try to avoid
billions and billions (sorry Carl) of people complaining that they couldn't get
disks to boot.

Wish I could type - desctriptors == descriptors.

Bob,

Your speed tests look a little slow.  A 1.43 Meg MM/1 type formatted disk
should get around 15 Kbytes a second transfer (read and write).

Well, I'd suggest leaving the descriptors as thet come from IMS.  That might be
a good "standard".

Don't worry about a membership application. You apply wherever is convenient
for you. All we need is your name and address (which I already have), so that
we can start the process of exchanging information. In the case of Australian
members, we are still deciding on the method of information exchange, i.e.,
what would be the most cost effective manner. If there were enough interest in
your area, it might be to use Fido file transfers, so that you could get files
within the same day they are distributed throughout the network. Of course, if
you want the large number of files we already have, postal mail might be the
best option to start. As for method of communications, it is already
established. Here in Hawaii, I am having problems with my mail feed, but other
regional coordinators are on the echos quite regularly. I just sent the basic
information out the echos. If
 you have any questions, be sure to ask on the COCO or OS9 echo. It was
exciting to see the first message to come from Australia in the COCO echo. It
seems to prove that the COCO, OS9, and its community aren't dead, as this
community has been able to form a network that is at last reaching around the
world :-) Were you able to get our guidelines (OS9NET.ARC) from here? I am
about to upload the last two newsletters up to the miscellaneous area (in the
old IBM arc format). If you need me to send these postal mail, let me know
here, or on the COCO or OS9 echo. I will also get a care package of shareable
files together so that the region in Australia can start its library. Let me
know what disk format you want, and it would also help if you could send some
disks.

Fm: Steve Wegert 76703,4255
To: All

AS I continue my shake out of the I/O board, I've run across a problem using my
high speed PPI 9600 baud modem on /t3.

Seems that unless I turn off the local hardware flow control (RTS/CTS), data
isn't received. I can dial, make the connect, get all the nice info that tells
me I have a MNP and v.42 connection. I can also see the xmit light flash on the
modem, so data is getting through.

Flipping thought the Tech manual (nice job, Mark!), I find info to the effect
that hardware hand shaking isn't turned on. To do so, I need only to set the
high bit on the 'type' parameter.

Lessee .... it's '00' now, so that would make it $80, jes?

Reading further, I'm also told there is not software to accomplish this task.

Trying Xmode /t3 type=$80 confirms this. What's a newbie to do?

Is there a way I can do what needs to be done? Am I even on the right track?

Setting type=$80 is the way to turn on hardware handshake.  I used a binary
file editor (bedt or ded or ??) but moded works too.  I figured someone would
crank out a little util to do it.  The downside is you have to reboot after
patching.

I found you can xmode /t3 type=80  (notice no hex sign) the save it out and

Mike,

I was able to use xmode as you suggested and saved it out, used fixmod and made
a new boot. Still no luck. Everything is still as it was ... data going out,
but nothing coming back.

Which version of xmode are you using? The one that came on the distribution
disks or the one with the update modules that was here for a few days?

How do you have your modem set up? Anything special?

Mike,

The jumpers on P4 control the logic of RTS and DTR.  The jumper is labeled as:

  1 * * 2
  3 * * 4
  5 * * 6
  7 * * 8

looking at the paddle board with the DB-9 to the left.  Jumpering pins 1 and 2
allow RTS to toggle freely.  Jumpers across 3 and 4 tie RTS high.  Jumpering
pins 5 and 6 allow DTR to toggle freely while jumpering 7 and 8 tie it high.

Steve's problem is pins 3 and 4 are jumpered.  The default settings on the
paddle boards are for 3,4 and 5,6 to be jumpered.  If he moves the jumper on
3,4 to 1,2, it should work.

This is all explained in the tech manual.

Great!  Guess I had the jumpers backwards.  <eek>  Sorry 'bout that.  The way
Mark said to jumper P4 is the way I have mine too.

Have you copied the moded.fields file, that was in the update, to /DD/SYS? If
so just do a "moded t3" to the descriptor on disk.  It allows you to set the
buffer sizes.

With STerm and the PPI, just for fun try an at$h to list the modems AT menu.
You'll see that Kev's <Tab> character now maps to the old CoCo up line char.
(Bummer)  I've tried to get him to take it out.  So if you to a write to the
window, the $09 comes out as an up line command and if you do a writeln it's a
<Tab>.  'Course it makes sense to use write in a term program, right? <g> (Pun
Alert!) 'Cause write is the right way to write, right?  (Baa-daa-ping!)

When you figure out the optimal buffer sizes for Sterm and /t3 lemme know what
sizes you ended up with.  My input buffer size is 3840 and the output buffer is
32768?  Seems quite incorrect to me!  Lemme check to see If I have the latest
/t3 descriptor....   Oops!  My t3 is 8 bytes shorter than the latest.  Better
fix that right now.  Input is 80 output is 140.....

.. Ok put the new descriptor in.  I set the input buffer to 4096. Works well
for everything but CIS at 9600 bps.  @ 9600 it still drops chars with STerm on
CIS.  <Arg!>    Works fine on the local BBS's and with UUCP tho.

(Ain't this fun!)

Wow .... you're really up there with the buffer size.  I was thinking hard to
use 1024. I'll let you know what I finally end up with.

Thanks for the pointer on the moded.fields file. Without manuals, I'm running
blind. And I hate to keep asking Mark for every bit of advice.

Back to the buffer size... I wonder how Carl setled on 80/140 as defaults. Or
is he just carrying on a Microware tradition?

Yeah, I noticed with Sterm that stupid up cursor comes back because Sterm does
use write() to write to the screen.  I thought about putting writeln() in to
fix it, but then I'd have to wait until a full line of text came in from the
modem before writing to the screen.  This would make the output look pretty
jumpy if there were long lines in the data stream so I decided against it.

Seems pretty stupid to me to have that up-cursor in there again.  After years
of listening to people complain about it you would think that Kevin would not
have put it back in.  Sometimes I wonder were that boy's mine is.

Ummm, the 09=up was in there because of the people who originally wanted
(and had specified at first) "CoCo compatibility".

As for write() vs writeln()... learn some more.  Writeln doesn't always mean
"write until carriage return".  It means "write with possible editing"...
eg: change tabs to spaces for terminals which don't support tabs and/or if
you want tabs to be a different spacing than what the terminal default is.

Writeln works just like write if you specify fewer characters and turn off
certain path options.  RTM.  

Here's a program which should take any windio version and kill the 09=up code.
Load it into basic, pack it, then chd to your boot module directory and
make a copy of your old windio.  Now call the program using the name of
the windio file to modify, like "nulltab windio"... then make a new boot.
Enjoy!

If you can call the c library from asm you should be able to use the CGFX.L
here in Lib 12.  The docs are up there also.  If you can't use the library, I'm
pretty sure someone had uploaded a util that told the display codes for the
CoCo 3 in DL 10.  One was called displa.txt and the other helpwn.b09.

Any specific codes you need?  This list is quite extensive.

Kev;

  Finally got my I/O board last week and got the HD populated -- this
is *great*!  What a personality change it makes in the MM/1!!

  I'm having a bit of trouble getting a mouse to work tho, and could
use a hint or two.  ;-)

  I've got ms and ms901 (ms68901) in memory, stdpats_16 & _256 merged via
startup, but I never see a mouse pointer.  Tried both a Mouse Systems
trackball and a Logictech mouse on /t2 (they both work on a PC).

  Logictech is completely dead - movement = null, buttons = null. Mouse
  says on bottom 'Microsoft compatible'.

  Mouse Systems - buttons = null, trackball = window change. M/S is
  supposed to be 'Logictech compatible'.

  What am I missing?  Should I have /t2 in the boot?

 TIA,
  ...Jim
p.s.  For anyone looking for an audio cable for their MM/1, most stereo
  dealers carry a cable made for Euro cassette decks to amp input made
  by RECOTON - p/n AC409 for about $3.69 or so.

Jim,

Do you have ms68901 or ms901?  They are different drivers.  Make sure the baud
rate in /ms is set to 1200. And dump /ms to see which driver it wants. (Should
be at the end of the module).

The driver and descriptor has to be Gen'd into the boot or it wont work.  Also
you'll need to leave /T2 OUT of the bootfile.  The patterns should not affect
the mouse at all.

I'm running a LogiTech 3 button mouse here, Model No: CC-93-DF. (I can't
remember what the box said, I use to use it on the CoCo)

Let us know how it turns out.   If you don't get a pointer after doing the
above.  Post the Idents of the modules and the xmode to /ms for me.

  Thanks for the quick reply.  About the only thing that I hadn't checked

>Do you have ms68901 or ms901? They are different drivers.

  Hmm, the bootlist calls for ms68901, but ms901 is the one that shows up
in an MDIR.  There is no ms901 in the bootmods/win directory.  A dump shows
both to be identical, at least on screen.

Look at the files.ar source in DL9. It's fairly simple though:

  1) Open directory of choice for DIR+READ
  2) Scan entries at 32 bytes each (29 name; 3 LSN of FD Sector)
  3) When you find the name you want, get the LSN for its FD Sector
  4) Open the WHOLE disk (i.e. /d1@, /dd@), and seek & read that
     sector number. Extract the file's size from here.

I doubt the two incidents were related, but ...

Given all the problems Barry still has with the TC70 system he purchased almost

Try calling Tandy National Parts.  I just bought a copy of OS-9 LII by calling

Have any STERM users experienced lock-ups when down-loading?  It seems to me
that at least 30% of the time when downloading with Compuserve B, STERM locks
up and I have to QUIT out.  Symptoms from watching the modem lights seem to
indicate that something happens at the end of or during the pause for disk
writing (I'll have to try it with ramdisk) when transmission from CIS
apparently stops.  Then a character seems to come from CIS every minute or so
but gets no response from my computer.  Am  I correct that there is no breakout
option with STERM to get out of the downloading mode?  Thanks for your comments
and advice.  Ches.

Ches,

I'm using Sterm and not noticing any problems while downloading ....but have
had some lock ups while trying to capture ASCII files and capture dumps.

Looking closer at the data on the screen, I noticed a repeating pattern which
reminded me of a similar occurance on the CoCo when 2400 baud modems became
popular and we started to push the box.

The xmit and receive buffers are tiny and tend to overflow quickly. Sterm
looses it's mind when this happen. I've only been able to hit the reset button
to regain control.

I've bumpped the buffers up to 2K and haven't seen the problem since.

I'm curious ... how fast are you running the port and what type of modem?

Opps.... almost replied as if you were running on a MM/1.

Changing the buffer sizes will depend on whose drivers you're using. If they're
tandy stock, there's a file in the COCO Library here that details the offsets
to modify.

Try a browse /key:ACIA

or /key:buffer*

and see what pops up.

If you are locking up with B+ downloads, you are either missing interrupts or
the hard drive is not fast enough.  If you don't have the IRQ hack installed
you should.  Try specifying the -f option when you start Sterm and see how that
goes.

To judge from the number of messages in the past month or so, OS9 on the CoCo 3
is dead. I suppose it was to be expected, but, speaking as one who has to
struggle to pay the mortgage and taxes and hasn't a hope of ever being able to
afford a new computer, I'm sad to see it go. I guess whatever I've got in terms
of hardware and software will have to do in the future. Too bad ... OS9 is such
an elegant system.

I don't know whether I'd draw that conclusion, Ian.  Doing so is sort of like
the famous Literary Digest poll back in the 30's from which it was concluded
that FDR didn't have a snowball's chance in <theological region> of being
elected president.  Just as they picked people with phones to ask, and thus got
mostly the folks with money, looking here on CIS similarly skews the results,
considering how much more it costs to use the OS-9 SIG here on CIS than to
spend the same amount of time, say, on Delphi, what with the 20/20 deal they
offer.

Check out the OS-9 echo on FIDO...it seems pretty active to me, and mostly the
folks there have CoCos, near as I can tell.

Ian -

Most people here read and download, and post mostly when they have a question.
I guess all the questions have been answered :-)  Well, not really, of course.

I think there are probably more CC-3 OS9 users now than ever.  Check out some
of the cocolist transcripts in Lib 14 (they're near the top).  The coco fests
are still held, also... only most of the stuff there is for OS-9, either 6809
or very gradually, 68K.

So no, most people feel as you do: as long as the stuff works, teaches
something, or is a nice cheap hobby, they're still using the Coco-3. Strangely,
I've been getting a lot of calls lately from people who're still using L-I on a
CoCo-1/2!  Can you believe it?  I couldn't!  <grin>

An IDE drive has its controller built into it.  PC's only need a host adapter
to use that drive.  Same with a CoCo, but I doubt any IDE host adapter for a
CoCo exists.  I don't recommend even attempting to run Disk BASIC (DECB) on the
hard drive though it can be done.  OS-9 boot is possible if you get a capable
ROM etc.; contact Burke&Burke for that.  You can put that drive in your case
but you will need an adapter to make it fit in there.  Somewhere (Lib 9 or 10 I
think) there's a text file about hard drives and the CoCo; I suggest you have a
look at it.  You got a pretty good price on that drive but I doubt you're going
to be able to use it on a CoCo.  Go for a SCSI based system instead.

Do you think it's possible to use the xpad under os9, or is the address
conflict insurmoutable. I am using the eliminator setup so in theory there is a
way to not have a hardware address conflict. unless the xpad uses a reserved
address belonging to the GIME. I seem to remenmber something like that from a
long while ago??.  Joerg

The address conflict wouldn't be as much an issue to me as WHAT KIND of OS9
driver to use.  Seems to me that an SCF driver is closest.  Then again, it may
not fit the bill.  You could think about a file manager as well.  The X-Pad is
kind of like a mouse, but is a mouse compatible with the SCF concept?

I guess I don't know.  I'd probably try an SCF driver for starters and see if

rarely present data that you could use read calls for.

John, thanks for the reply. I also left a message for you on Fido Echomail, but
as you point out there has been a problem in that area. I have just downloaded
the OCNN01 and OCNN02 from CI$. Have not had a look yet, but am sure they will
be interesting. Gordon Bentzen will also be interested, and copies of which I
will convey to him tomorrow, as we work for the same company. I will also
upload to the News area on our local Fido BBS, the "Galaxy Gateway" 3:640/316.

     Thanks for the offer of files. We certainly would appreciate the
opportunity to access this database. Most of us here are using the 80 track
double sided format, with 5 1/4 floppy drives, and from memory, I think 20 meg
is average for our hard drives. A few of us including myself have fitted the 1
meg upgrade, the others (here in Queensland) are using 512 K. We also have a
few OSK users, with a local member Don Berrie (author of CENV) having ordered
an MM 1.

     Just a little info to maybe give a bit of insight to the users "Down
Under".

     I will send to you via the postal services, any number of disks you care
to nominate, by way of reply to me on either CI$, or Echo Mail. I have your
address as 814 Bannister St #4, Honolulu, HI 96819.

     Well, it's getting on now John (10 after Midnight Friday morn), so I beter
go. I will upload this to CI$ and Echo Mail, so you will receive it one way or
the other.

     Regards, & best wishes from Rob MacKay :-)

I am offering a complete OS-9 hard drive system for sale as part of my
transition to CoCo2/80386.  I have uploaded a full description of the system to
the Color Computer Forum (GO COCO) in Lib 14.  The file name is HDSYS.TXT. I
just uploaded the file so if it is still awaiting sysop approval, please go
back later to get it.  The file length is about 3.5K and is text which can be
read online.

Good news for you OSK C people.  I've obtained permission to upload the GNU C++
Compiler to this SIG, and will upload it here soon.  (as soon as I have all of
it downloaded from the 'other' service!!)

It'll be really great of an addition to your C libraries.

Steve;

  Thanks for the info on the /P ports - I'll be ordering the Tech Manual RSN I
guess.

  Have you heard of anyone doing anything with the I**C interface yet? I read
an interesting news blurb the other day about a breakout card being developed
by (I think) DEC and Phillips specifically for the I**C. Will bring the info
home and post if there's any interest.

re: Artec mouse
  Fry's Electronics and CompUsa both carry them for around $15 - one of the
benefits of living here in 'hi-tech wonderland' - lots of price competition.

Thanks for the the information on the mouse. Is this the one that that has the
scaleable resolution button on the side? Two button? Three button?

Jim,

The only stuff I've seen on the I2C buss has been in the Tech manual. Mark's
included a page of device and part numbers. Interesting reading.
 If you find out anything else, I'd be interested in seeing it.

Wayne....I am preparing to upload the cmds for the C++ Compiler, but the sign
tells me that it's out of space for uploading.

Could you take care of this?

Thanks.

Jim, I've squeezed a bit more space for you into the libs. Can you give us some
idea of the size of the upload(s) you have planned?

Fm: MARK LITTLE 70761,3147

I am using (sometimes) Deskmate3 on my CoCo3.  I have successfully downloaded
AR'd files and extracted them before. However I have twice downloaded STERM1.51
and STERM.AR and have been unable to get it working.  After much checking and
leaving a couple of messages, I have made sure all needed modules are in my
boot file
           /t2   /t1   /m2 and have tried running:   STERM -l/t2  >/1     also.



I keep getting a non-existent module error. I know the modules are on the disk,
and tried linking them in memory before running STERM, and couldn't load any of
them.  A check with IDENT shows all the listed modules below have incorrect
module headers.
      bplus.h           common.h          io.c
      bplus.c           xmodem.h          crc.c
      io.c

Could I be doing something wrong, or could Deskmate be writing the wrong header
info while downloading?
