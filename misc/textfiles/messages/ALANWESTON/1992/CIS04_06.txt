Do you know the catalog number for the development package? There isn't anyone
I know that has a CoCo for sale anymore. All my friends went to MSDOS a few
years ago. There's only one other guy in my area that has a CoCo and he runs a
BBS on his also. He's still using RSDOS though.

Geezzz.. I don't know...I'll have to look.... I'm starting to have other
problems now. I think my GIME chip has gone bad. The computer just locks up
every now and then and starts printing those sparklies on the screen. I can't
run my Burke & Burke File Repack System anymore. As soon as I type 'repack /h0'
the program will load and the drive light will come on for a second and then
nothing or the sparklies come back. Even multitasking seems to not work right
sometimes. My Deskmate wordprocessor doesn't work right either when I try to
copy blocks pf text. I figure, well it might be the GIME chip as I've heard
that when they go bad, things like that happen. It most likely is as I have
been running my CoCo for about 5 years nonstop now running a BBS. I've alreay
had to replace a HD a couple of years ago. Where can I get updated GIME chip?
Does Frank Hogg have them? Thanks...

George - try cleaning the GIME chip contacts... or at least tapping on it. Same
for the MPI connectors (if you have one).  It's amazing how cruddy the metal
gets, especially after some moist days.

I cleaned all my connections with a Nintendo cleaning kit. Those suckers were
filthy! Especially slot 4 on my multi-pak! I'm still using an old Radio Shack
floppy drive controller. I would like a nice Disto controller if I can find
one. To clean the GIME chip contacts, should I pull the chip out and clean them
or will some type of cleaner work like a Zero residue spray? BTW, I still got
the same results with 'repack' after I cleaned my connections. I hope cleaning
the GIME chip connections will make it work... Thanks for the help...

I usually just pop the GIME out, and then pop it back in again... seems to be
enough to cure a lot of ills (too lazy to spray it off so far :).

You might call CRC and see if they have any Disto controllers left.  Tony was
making a few more, and there was a false report on the nets that they were all
gone.  Actually, the CRC salespeople goofed and didn't catch on that there were
going to be a few more made available.

Same goes for 1-meg upgrades and the 4-in-1 boards, I think.

If you need to read your OS-9 disks in your PC, there is a German company
called DTR(Daten Technik Reicshke), that has made a utility for MSDOS called
OS9MAX, that will allow you to read,write,format,dir,diskcopy OS-9 disks in
your PC-drive. It will read almost any format.    If you are interested I will

The problem seems to be that you're passing 'vlu' to getkey() by VALUE... that
is, you're sending a clone of VLU, but not VLU itself.

In order to do what you want, you weel need to pass a pointer to VLU, ala:

     getkey(&vlu)

and then down in getkey() (note declaration of vlu):

 int getkey(vlu)
 int *vlu;
        {
        *vlu = inkey();
         ....
        }

Pete, your way of returning the pointer to the entered value, turned out to be
be the best approach to what I was trying to do.  I changed the 'int getkey()'
to a 'char getkey()' also, since I found that I could more easily handle the
returned value than the clone.

Actually, 'C' (or really C++) is bending in your direction...

In C++, you can pass variables by reference without using pointers:

   swap(a,b)

    .....

   swap( int& a, int& b)
        {
        int temp;

        temp = a;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
        }

There are a few nice things about this approach:

   1) You no longer have to dereference pointers
   2) It is more intuitive in the target function
   3) Because you're not using pointers, you have no
      opportunity to walk on something else.

I believe there's a GNU C++ for the OSK boxes...

Hello, C programmers!

  I have another question.  Suppose I have an array of pointers to functions,
such as the following:

int func0(), func1(), func2(), func3(), etc...;

int funcarr[] = {
   func0,
   func1,
   func2,
   func3,
   etc... };

  and I know which function I want to execute by its subscript in the array:

int whichfunc;

   whichfunc = 1;  /* I want to execute func1() */

  It seems to me, from what James Jones said earlier to me, that the proper
statement would be:

   (*funcarr[whichfunc])();

  Is this correct?  Are all of my previous statements syntactically correct?
Thank you for any replies.

  Many thanks to James Jones for his help with my programming problems.  It now
works!  Here's what I did:

  First of all, I declared my functions, as they were in a separate source
file:

int func0(), func1(), func2(), etc...;

  and then built my array:

int (*funcarr[])() = {
   func0,
   func1,
   func2,
   etc... };

  I decided to call dofunc by number, instead of by function address; here is
my (short and simple) dofunc function!

dofunc(funcnum)

/* do the func */

char funcnum;

{

   return((*funcarr[funcnum])());

}

  Thank you so much for your help, James!  I appreciate it very much.  It is
cleaner, more manageable, and faster than using switch (as I did previously).

Sb: Timing Help
Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

Has anyone done much work with timed sleeps? I think I've found a bug in the
sleep command--when the high bit of the value is set (as per MW instructions)
it does not time 1/256 seconds accurately. Look at the following test code:

 main()
 {
   register int t;
   /* this gives "exactly" 10 seconds delay */
   system("date"); for(t=10;t;t--) tsleep(0x80000000 + 256);

   /* however, this gives only about 7 sec... */
   system("date"); for(t=256;t;t--) tsleep(0x80000000 + 10);

   /* and this gives only about 1 second */
   system("date"); for(t=2560;t;t--) tsleep(0x80000000 + 1);

   system("date");
 }

As the comments indicate, the smaller the duration, the greater the error. If
anything, the loops with the short sleep values should give more than 10
seconds delay due to the loop overhead. Or am I doing this all wrong?

Oh, I'm using OSK 2.4 on a mm/1.

Please leave your name, address and phone number here, I'll take care of the

run on the STs, unfortunately there are too many MM/1 specific programs at this

(for text screen handling), so incompatabilities don't _kill_ the blossoming
OSK market. My advice to you on DLing the GNU set, is to wait for my (or

Let me try to clear up any questions you may have about the OS9CN. As I tried

newsletter (NetNews) is in the works (hard copy, pending the BOD's approval),
but an ASCII disk file should be available on your local regional librarians
board. I will UL the April NetNews here, as soon as possible (pending its
completion). The theme of this months newsletter is communications, meaning how
can we best keep in touch through the most popular msg. bases. If you or
someone you know would like to submit an article on the simplest methods for
using (and finding) these networks, it would be very much appreciated. Since
the name of this user group implies it's network nature, I think our first
priority should be to show everyone interested in OS-9, how to make his/her
connection to our services.

out. I have bought a 4M bare board upgrade ($39), but have only purchased 2M of
DRAM (want to make sure it works first). I'll let you know about the upgrade
and the GNU operation as soon as possible.

I'm looking for a program that runs under OS-9 that does what the remote PC in
a "PC-Anywhere arrangement" does.

   As you may know, PC-Anywhere allows a host PC to accessed via a comm-link
connected remote PC.  The remote PC can be in the next room, the next county or
the next country, as long as they are attached to each other through their
respective COMM ports.
   The remote PC (once logged on) can to anything from the remote site that can
be done from the local (host) site.
   A LAN is being installed here at work.  My employer's PC is across the room,
my CoCo (w/OS-9) is here on this side of the room, where all my "stuff" is.
   I think it'd be great if I could link up with the LAN-ed Po using
PC-Anywhere running on the PC and an OS-9 counterpart running here on the
CoCo3.  I could then just open a window under my Level 2 system, start the OS-9
version of PC-Anywhere, log on to the PC (running the host part of
PC-Anywhere), log on to the LAN, then do everything from where I've been doing
it all anyway.

Anything like a PC-Anywhere out there for Level 2?  I just need the remote side
to run on the OS-9 end.  The host side (PC-Anywhere) would still be running on
a PC.

"PC-Anywhere" is just example of what I'm talking about.  There are several
such programs that run in the MiSery-DOS environs.  A counterpart to just about
any one of them would probably do.

Thanks,

Lee

Subject:  Upgrade/enhancement suggestions for AR 1.2


   o  Improved compression reflecting as good or better compression
      than the unsanctioned versions of AR.

   o  Various compression formats to fit the various types of files
      available.  (e.g. one format compresses text very wfll, where
      another compresses binaries pretty well.)

   o  A MOUSE DRIVEN INTERFACE that we may use since the file exten-
      sion is only (.ar) two letters instead of three. (i.e. we can
      not use Multi-Vue.)

   o  ASCII processing for files to be displayed to STDOUT via the
      -p option.  This is to say that AR should filter out control
      characters and binary (mask high-order bit) data while send-
      ing the text out.  If that option does not appeal to you,
      the parhaps an option for this while printing would me more
      appropriate such as "ar -pp [archive.ar] <filename>" ?

   o  When files are compressed using AR 1.2, sometimes the result
      is actually LARGER than the original file.  At times like
      that, it would make sense that some kind of compression logic
      be added to the program to test the last compression to see
      if the result is larger that the original file and if so,
      simply do not compress (store as-is) or use another
      compression method.

Gee...now that I have /t0 set for 19.2Kbps, sterm thinks I'm running at 1200

James,

 >can I get sterm to get the right idea about (19.2) baud rate?

Sure, go into the io.h header file that sets up the baud rate table and change
the 19.2 value from 16 to 15 and recompile.  Either that or drop back to 9600
baud.

Look for:

   #ifdef OSK
      {5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16};

and change the 16 to 15.  That's all folks!!!

Carl (and Kev),

I recently completed adding the remaining serial ports to my MM/1. I now
have all five ports available. On the surface .... they all work. /t2,/t3
and /t4 have always functioned, so I tested /t0 and /t1 by swapping a
terminal to each port, firing up a shell and issuing a few commands.

But, when I try something a bit more intense I find I have more serial
weridness. For instance, with a terminal on /t0 and a shell active, I fire
up my com program with the following command: sterm -l /t3

As soon as I get any activity from sterm, the port is locked up. (other
port still function). Attempting to kill the process on /t0 will lock
up the entire machine. The same thing will happen if I use Kermit.

Mark muttered somthing about interupts, so I grabbed a snapshot with the
IRQS command:

OS9 St. Louis  MM/1  OS-9/68K V2.4      (max devs: 32, max irqs: 32)

Immediately the 255 priority on /t0 strikes me as odd.

Next, I start to compare the values found in the above table with those found
by using moded on the various descriptors. What I find is that for all of the
descriptors _except_ for /t0, values for vector, pirority and port address
match.

Moded reports a vector of 60, priority of 5 and an address of $80002011 on
 /t0.

Further testing and playing uncovers another bit of weirdness. With a shell on
/t1 (and showing up in the IRQS table), any request of the floppy will lock up
the machine. Only a reboot will fix it. The same this _does not_ happen with
/t2. (I'm guessing this would rule out the 901 driver causing this problem
along with the my 'one-off' problem).

Looking at the IRQS table, I notice that the port address for /t1 is one byte
higher than the clock. I wonder if this is significant, given the gap between
other devices is at least 10.

Not knowing what the heck I'm talking about reduces me to just reporting what I
see. I hope it's helpful.

Ideas? Do I have an interupt problem or should I go looking elsewhere?

Steve,

I spent a bit of time staring at your problem, and I think you may in fact have
several.  We know there is something wrong with the 901 driver because it gets
in the 'one behind' mode.  But your are right about t0 not looking right.  The
address is wrong and the priority is wrong.  The address is actually that of
the interrupt pending register B.  It seems like something or someone has
overwritten them.  Since that register does deal with floppy and hard disk I/O,
perhaps it isn't too surprising that floppy access can hang the system.  Can
Mark or anyone else duplicate those results?

Pretty trivial in the usual case.  Has to do with baud table selection not
working right with certain baud combinations, like 9600 on one port and 19200
on the other or some such.

Carl,

Mark mentioned to me on Saturday he'd be sending off the cpu board to you on
Monday.

In the meantime, a little more testing on my part has yielded a bit more info
that might be helpful as you desk test.

I removed both the sc60870 and sc68901 updated drivers from my bootfile,
replacing each with the distribution versions and got some interesting results.
(appropriate descriptors were also replaced)

Relative to the /t0 problems, there wasn't any significat change in
performance. The port still locked up trying to run a telcom program and
accessing /d0 with /t1 active locked up the machine.

What was interesting was that /t0 no longer shows up in the IRQS display.

Now onto slightly better news:

The 'one-off' problem doesn't appear while using the older version of the 901
driver. However, the port locks up frequently enough to make it unusable in my
application. (might be related to the smaller buffer sizes?)

In any event, I wanted to pass along what symptoms I can duplicate. Perhaps
it's helpful.

Thanks for your efforts,

Steve

Hey Steve,

Just thought I would drop a note in here to tell you that you are not alone
with the serial wierdies.  I noticed the 'one off' problem on both /t0 and /t1.
I also can lock up every thing by trying to access any floppy drive when there
is a shell running on /t1.  My solution (after I got the tech manual and found
out how to do it was to reconfigure the paddle board (I only have one) to use
/t3 (unplugged /t1 and made a little cable).  I figure I'll ignore /t1 until
somebody smarter than me fixes it.  For the (old) /t0 lockup problem (it gets
hung up if it sees something at the wrong baud rate), I have a little program
called 'guardian' that was uploaded to DELPHI by Randy Wilson.  It watches for
an error in the on-board 68070 serial port and resets it.

Watching this thread with interest.

The problem with the old 901 driver locking up didn't have anything to do with
buffer sizes.  It sounds like the 'off by one' feature was introduced with the
variable buffer sizes, though.

Bob,

If you could .... even though you don't have the paddle boards, you can attempt
to duplicate some of these problems. For instance, load the sc68901 driver (if
you don't already have it in memory), along with /t1. Start a shell on /t1 with
a  Shell -l <>>>/t1&

Confirm it with the DEVS and IRQS command.

Now ... attempt to access the floppy.

Let me know what happens.

Steve,

I talked to Paul today, and he promised that paddle board would be sent "right
away"! When I get it I'll try this again, but without a /t1 board I get a real
nice result when I try to access /t1--total system hangup. No keyboard,
nothing. This happens if I just do an 'iniz /t1' or attempt to start up a
shell. I don't think that this SHOULD be happening?

BTW, any idea what the sc68681 driver is for?

The sc68681 driver is for /t3 and /t4.

I'm not too surprised at your lock up, the serial stuff seems to have a few

When you did your test ... what was /t0 doing?

Carl,

When I went back to the distrubiton drivers and descriptors, I wasn't using any
mouse related stuff at all. I've had that commented out of my boot file until
just recently.

To clarify my 'same result' statement:

With the older version of sc68070 and /t0 in use with a shell running on the
terminal connected to /t0 (which appears to function fine), invoking sterm on
the terminal (using /t3 for the modem port ___ i.e. sterm -l /t3) will lock up
the port immediately upon sterm displaying it's opening screen.

Attempting to kill the sterm process at the console (/term) will lock up the
machine.

Using kermit instead of sterm nets the same result.

The only difference I noticed using the older version of /t0 and it's driver
was no entry appeared in either DEVS or IRQS for /t0 even though it had been
attached.

Well.....

It has now been two (2) years since the debut of the MM/1 at the Chicago Fest
in April 1990.  Since that time, none of the promised software packages have
made it to the markit.  Why?  Everyone is still waiting on the window interface
to be completed......the very same window interface that was demoed 2 years ago
and oh so many promises made.

Sigh.  My friends, I have given up on this and this is my last public comment
on this subject.  If someone can get the window system out to the public, then
maybe the MM/1 project can still be saved.  Hey, a new cause for the whale

Larry, perhaps you've noticed that I've been trying to find the answer to the
malloc problem.  It hit me a year or so ago and Mike gave me a fix.
Unfortunately, in a misguided fit of cleaning up, I recently lost the fix and
now I have the same problem again.  It has to do with SHELL+.  If you reboot
with the original SHELL instead of SHELL+ as SHELL, I believe you will be able
to run UmUse without problems.  I have called Mike but so far no answer;
perhaps he's out of town.  More later.  Ches.

l* Ches, Thanks for trying. I read the message thread a couple of days ago and
decided to try some of the suggestions myself(I was too impatient to wait).
Nothing seemed to work until I tried booting with the original Tandy Shell.
Voila! Umuse was running perfect. Well I did not want to have to put up with
the limitations of the old shell and I was unsure what I wanted to do until I
realized that the only version of shell causing the problem was the one that
Umuse3 ran from. I patched an original Tandy shell to the name Tshel and also
patched the prompt to VDG and put it in my CMDS directory. Then I re-booted
with my normal shell+ and begore Then I re-booted with my mormal shell+ and
used the following sequence to run Ultimuse. tshell i=/vdg&
 then I go over to the VDG window and umuse3
 and everything appears to work fine. I have been using this method for 2-3
 days without problem.

 If you do find out a more elegant solution I would be happy to hear it,
however, I am doing just fine now.

P.S. Do you have version 4.7.5a -I thing the additions to it are fabulous.
     About the only thing I wished for that he has not already added is
     the coming APPEND function and a stand alone song player.

Since you sorta said it's me, I looked more carefully.  What seems to be
happening is that a line-feed is being lost at the end of the message so the RR
#XXXXX (or whatever the syntax is) comes in over the last line. Dunno why the
only thing that shows up is the number.  Strange.  Software is STERM; no
logging occuring when # shows up.  Doesn't happen all the time.  Gotta be a
timing problem of some sort, but 'tis interesting that it doesn't occur on
anything but that last line.  Ideas??  Ches.

I take it this is a recent development? What's new to your set up? Logging in

Hi Steve... Specifically, I would like some information on getting at the guts
of the VSC chip - how to program it, how to use the pixel accelerator
functions, etc.  All the (oops) "tech manual" tells us is that there is a chip
called the VSC and that it controls the video output. Not much help there. All
the information in there seems kinda like that. It mentions stuff, but doesn't
go into any detail at all. I like to program in assembler and I like to
sometimes 'cheat' and go directly to hardware without letting the OS handle it.
Must be my coarse RSDOS upbringing, I guess... I thought a tech manual was
supposed to explain in detail everything about the machine hardwarewise, rather
than just brush over things... I'm not saying the manual is totally useless,
but so far it hasn't enlightened me a hell of a lot.M (oops) Guess Signetics
wouldn't let IMS reprint their spec sheets?? That seems kinda dumb, if they
want to sell products... I don't know what the problem is, but I want more for
my $50!!!

    If I may jump in, I too have the MM1 technical manual, and your right it
didn't get very deep in the hardware. But there is a solution, and it only
costs a phone call.
    If you call Phillips/Signetics, they will send you a load of stuff..
    Just call and ask for data books/sheets on the following

       Hardware & Software manuals for SCC68070
          Phillips #
           9398-651-50011  SCC68070 User Manual 1990 Part 1
           9398-650-40011  SCC68070 User Manual 1990 Part 2 Software
  oops- Part 1 should be Part 1 Hardware
       For the SCC66470 Video & systen Controller
          Phillips #
           98-8066-470     SCC66470 Data Sheet

   The number I have for Signitics is (408)-991-2000

    You will be suprised at what they will send you for free, the SCC66470 Data
Sheet, is actually 60 pages of info on the vsc, while those user manuals are
like some of the programming books you have probably paid quite a bit for.
    If you are also interested in the I^C stuff built into the 68070, then also
ask for the..
    I^C Peripherals for Microcontrollers
      Phillips #
       98-8080-574
   They will even send you a Master product catalog # 98-1000-000-05 without
even asking.
   You will think its Christmas, when all the stuff shows up ;-)
    I hope this helps

If you care to call the numbers I give, or write to the addresses, you'll get
SEVERAL BOOKS on just the VSC.  Yes, all the information on the VSC covers
three different books.  And I mean books of over 100 pages each. It was not
that Signetics didn't allow IMS to reprint them, it was just too much to be
included in the tech manual.  If I had re-written all of that or just
re-printed it and included it in the manual, it would have driven the price up
to well over $100.  Would you think that was a bargan?

What I did give was some specifics on the different devices where they apply to
the MM/1.  If you could have figured all this out on your own then you wouldn't
have needed the tech manual.  As it is, with the tech manual and the
manufacturer docs, you have all you need to "cheat" when you didn't have that
before.  If you think the price should be lower, then talk to Paul Ward.  If
you want to complain about the contents some more, then I'm the one to talk
with.

I tend to agree there needs to be a bit more info in the manual for the price
it carries. In talking with Mark, he mentions that he had planned on including
all the window stuff as well as addtional driver info but printing deadlines
conflicted with developer deadlines and the manual had to move ahead without
it.

Paul Ward happened to call me today and I passed on your concerns about the

Sb: 600 baud on /t0
Fm: Steve Wegert 76703,4255
To: All

An unexpected feature of /t0 showed up over the weekend. It would appear that
this port can not support 600 baud. You can xmode the descriptor to the
appropriate value, but attempting any type of use of that port (just an iniz,
for example) and a 240 error will result. Why a drive error happens, I'm not
too sure, but happen it does.

With my 5 serial ports in operation, I had plans on having my X10 controller
hooked to /t0 (thus the 600 baud), a tube on /t1, a critter on /t2 and a couple
of modems on /t3 and /t4. Looks as if I may have to swap the tube and X10.

This bit of trivia wasn't in the manual that came with the computer, nor did I
recall seeing it in the Tech manual. However, I'm told it's covered in the
technical info from Signetics.

Thought I'd pass this on to other MM/1 users ... and I'd expect a similar
feature on a TC70's /term port.
