Lee,

Addendum to all said previously...

email allows you lots of access on Internet.  There are several ftp (file
transfer protocol) sites that respond to email requests, the various internet
mailing lists, and such.

A good book that explains a lot of what's going on is THE WHOLE INTERNET USER'S
GUIDE AND CATALOG by Ed Krol.

It goes into a fair amount of detail on what you can do with email.

There are a couple of commercial Internet access companies in Dallas that
provide customers with a window on the net, too, if you want that info.

Can one of the wizards help me out? I have some code which sort of looks like:

 #define KEYS 26
 int (*indexes)[KEYS2];
 char *p;
 foo()
 {
   .... assign p to an offset into a memory module ...
   .... now set the indexes array pointer ....
   indexes=p;
   ....
 }

I need to cast p to the type of indexes. Nothing I try seems to work. I thought
that "indexes=(int**)p" would work...

Someone got the answer?

Bob -

Hmm.. lessee..

First, I'll assume that the reference to KEYS2 was a typo. Next, it appears
that you are declaring an array of pointers to a type 'int'. This array is KEYS
(26) elements long.

Now - in assigning 'indexes=p', you have told the compiler that you want
&indexes[0] = p. In other words, you have established 'p' as being the base
address of the array. If this is really what you want to do (?,?). Now since
&indexes[0] should probably only be an RVAL (something to be taken the value
of; not something to be assigned), I'm not sure the compiler will let you
assign a value, regardless of how you cast it. You may have to set up yet
another pointer to the array, or just set it up as a pointer to an int, i.e.:

  int *intpointer;

Then could still reference array type stuff by using syntax like intpointer+1,
intpointer+offset, etc. Because the compiler knows how long an int is, this is
exactly like using array references anyway. The only catch is that you will
have to becareful about the 'subscript' (offset), as the compiler will pretty
much let you do what you want.

Thanks for the help, Pete. I got some help from the CDECL program (in the TOP
library). After I finally got it to compile I had it figure out things for me.
Here's the scoop:

1. I have an array "int indexes[KEYS1][KEYS2]" which holds a bunch of
   offsets into a database.

2. These are stored in a datamod which I load into memory when needed.

3. My program links to the datamod. So it needs two things. First a
   it needs a variable indexes which can be used to access the database.

                int (*indexes)[KEYS2];

   works fine. I can now do things like t=indexes[a][b]...

   The problem comes in transfering the address of the index in the datamod
   to the variable indexes. First off, we have to link to the
   module. So we make a declaration and create a variable to store the
   address of data mod:

   Smod *module, *modlink();

   After a successful link, I want to set 'indexes' to predetermined offset
   into the module. Here is the proper way:

   indexes=(int(*)[KEYS2])(module+xoffset);

   This casts the type of 'module' to that of 'index'.

On the other question...yes, I was afraid that I couldn't get those sizes at
compile time easily. Resorting to asm for this is probably not worth the
bother...I'll just use strlen() dynamically.

Pete,

The CDECL program is a magic aid to figuring out complex C declarations. Some
sample input:

  declare foo as pointer to function returning pointer to int
  explain char *(*woof)()
  cast yy into pointer to array 44 of int

returns the lines:

  int *(*foo)()
  declare woof as pointer to function returning pointer to char
  (int (*)[44])yy

The history of this program is UNIX. I got it out of the TOP library. Not sure
which volume (I've repacked mine onto 1.44meg disks). It comes in source and
you'll need flex and bison to complile it. I had to change the flex parser to
use readln() instead of read() to get the interactive mode to work...otherwise
(if you ignore the compile warnings <g>) all works fine. Very useful for the
strange declarations needed from time to time.

The declaration int (*indexes)[26] is different than int *indexes[26]. The
latter making indexes an array of 26 pointers pointing to 26 integers.  The
first is a pointer pointing to an array of 26 integers. It is explained more
clearly like this: indexes[][26].  So it really is a form of a
multi-dimensional array.  You would access the array like this:

        var = indexes[i]  which is the same as var = &indexes[0][i]

So I don't think you can assign a value to indexes since it really isn't a
pointer.  You could do something like int *idx = &indexes and then assign a
value to idx.  Play around with that and see what happens.

I had to look around for an answer to this one.  Found it in my Plum Hall book
"Reliable Data Structures in C".

Here's another C question:

I have an array of pointer to char declared in my program. Let's say it look
like:

  char *items[]={"one","two","three"};

Is it possible to determine the lengths of the strings at compile time? I'd
like to be able to do something like:

  int len1=sizeof(items[0]);

But that sets len1 to the size of the pointer (4), not the length of the string
(3). Do I have to go through with strlen() for the whole list or is there a
compile time method?

Short of going into assembler (see below), I don't know of a compile time
method. As you surmise, the sizeof will get you the size of the pointer.

Assembly style would be something like this:

string fcc "Holy cow"
       fcb $0d strlen set .-string

You could probably bracket them with #asm and #endasm and include it in your C
program.

You could get an idea by using the CC options to go to assembler with source
embedded as comments. Then, edit the assembly source to include the 'len set
.-string_start' stuff.

Pete

P.S. Make the '.'s '*''s

I'd say you need to use strlen() or, since you know that size of each item in
the array, make another array that holds the size of each element, or make your
items[] array two-dimensional and hard code the sizes in there. Not very
elegant, but the compiler has no way of knowing what the sizes of the elements
are since you explicitly told it they were pointer items.

Hi Pete--I cant get the hard drive to format properly. I either get a 214 when
I try to access it or if I change inittbl I can do a dir and get an empty
directory of root which at first seems fine. Then if I copy a file to root, the
file name shows when I do a dump but doesn't with a dir. If I do a makdir CMDS,
I get a directory called CMDC every time and if Ido a dir of CMDC I get a 214.
If I do another makdir CMDS I will now have two CMDC directories.

Frankly Phil, I haven't got a clue initially. Sounds like it could be:

a) Crummy driver b) Flakey interface c) Hardware failure

Just for the sake of interest, the difference between the CMDS and CMDC is the
last character (or course), where S = 53 hex and C = 43 hex: a 1 bit
difference. Also, the last character of the name is supposed to have the HIGH
bit set (43 + 80 = C3 or 53 + 80 = D3).. just curious: is the high bit set?

Lastly, is the device descriptor INIZed (i.e. iniz /H0) before you start
messing with it?

Hi .. I've been reaaal bizzee .. got my ST back just last week, should be
up-to-snuff now.  ICD has a version 6.0.6 of their drivers, it's getting to be
awfully solid .. B&B should consider cache functions in their drivers.

I spent all my bonus money on getting the ST & cars fixed up, so no "true
color" card for the ST despite me already having a multisync monitor working in
all resolutions (even works on the CoCo3 :) .  However, next payday if I can
keep away from the "holiday spirit" (i.e. fingers outa my wallet), I *should*
be able to order Cumana's pkg next month.  So I'm still definitely interested
in any feedback ya get.  The guy on Delphi who actually bought the Cumana thing
is typing some details about it.  I think there *is* some SCSI support in there
after all, but absolutely no graphics :( it seems.  But I'm more than willing
to help work on such drivers for the ST and I do wanna get it standardized (not
nec'ly CoCo3 standards but future ones like ANSI/OSI/ X-Open/whatever is
happenin' with Un*x, then we'd have some fun stuff to port as end-user
applications too .. i.e. why re-invent the wheel?).

Oh well thank you for the time and I *do* appreciate it!  -- thx, Paul S.

Sb: CoCo I ROM disassembly?
Fm: John Carter 72236,154
To: all

Does anyone have a commented listing of the CoCo 1 BASIC ROM disassembly, or a
copy of Color BASIC Unravelled that they would part with reasonably? I've been
playing with the DLOAD command (it DOES work, but only for ASCII BASIC files)
and need to know what the ROM REALLY does - the Tandy docs are not totally
correct (off by a value of one is still to far off to work!). Thanks.

Fm: Robert Heller 71450,3432
To: TeX uses...

TITLE: Looking for DVI to BJ300/330 converter I have a Canon Bubble Jet printer
(BJ-330) and would like to use TeX. This printer emulates either an IBM XL224E
or an Epson LQ-1050 24-pin printers (these are the wide carriage versions - the
same escape sequences apply to the IBM X24E and Epson LQ-850, which are the
narrow carriage printers). I know there exists a DVI24PIN for MS-DOS (I even
know where I can get the
EXE file).  The problem is - I don't run MS-DOS.  I run OS-9/68000 on my
68030-based Force CPU30 system.  I need *source* code (in C).  Does anyone have
this code.  Last time I looked, Channel-1 only had the executable.

I seem to recall some message traffic about 'man' and 68k... did you carry the
banner forward into 68Kland? If so, would you mind parting with a copy? I could
really use it.

Sure, I'll upload it for you.  This is the simple one I did a few years ago
from one of your original man utils.  Look for it in DL12.

Fm: John R. Wainwright 72517,676
To: all

On a recent trip to Ft. Worth (check out new grandson), I wandered in to the
Tandy Mall and the warehouse outlet and got a 40 meg Quantum SCSI for $149. 
Seems the 40 and 202 meg SCSI drives for the 3000/4000 computers are being
closed out.  Back home now, I checked at the local (Saginaw MI) computer center
and they had a 40 too.  The 40 is $149 and the 202 (if you find one) is $299. 
The 40 meg drive I found in Ft Worth is now running in my MM/1 -- its fast too.
(Good hunting).

John, do you happen to have a Tandy number for the 202?

Does anyone know of a text formatter that will do standard UNIX man pages? I
mean for OS-9.  I'm tired of having to 'fix' em.  It would be much better just
to format 'em.

Well, there's always 'groff' (GNU roff), iffn you want to port it. Otherwise,
it's'mroff'.

I guess you could write a macro set for mroff to emulate the -man man macros...

Hi Ed!

I want to get in touch with directly over the subject of OS-9 software for
sale. We have spoken before, when I worked for Pan Controls, in Scotland. I can
be reached on Uk phone number 031-225-2545, or UK fax 031-225-2745 or home
number 0259-781-315

I have discussed the problem of US distribution with Steve Weller, and he is
not being very active at the moment.

Please get in touch. Alternatively, let me have a number where I can call you.

Regards, Robert
