 Not yet, Pete.  Do you think that would matter though?  It doesn't even attempt
 to read from the /d0 when I run it from the H/D?  It just reads from the H/D
 then quits and gives me the error.

 All we know for sure is:
 
    a) It's looking for something that it can't find (for whatever reason)
    b) You changed from /d0 to /h0 (and shifted /DD)
    c) It does a disk access before the error
 
 I suggest that the following are the most likely causes of the problem:
 
    a) A file or directory that's required is missing from the hard disk
    b) An explicit reference to another drive remains
    c) You have different startup files that load different things on
       the floppy or hard disk.
 
    d) You have different versions of code on the hard disk than on the floppy.

 Pete,
 
         This is what I found last night.  I used dEd to search for any d0's,
 and had no luck.  Then I decided to do a verify, Bingo!!  After that, it worked
 fine, except the address for the 4in1 serial is different then what is actually
 in the special /t2 it uses, but that is just a matter of changing it (I went
 from a Slotpak & RS232 to an SCII recently).  When I did a cmp of the one on
 the H/D and the one I made the copy of from the floppy, there were about 17 bit
 chanes???? I didn't do it.  Unless dEd changed all of these during the verify,
 I don't know what the heck happened.  Thanks for your time, and the little
 boost in effort that kept pushing to find the problem.

 Sorry I didn't think of CRC's... I had patched my kernel to omit the CRC check,
 which made it much faster on a HD based system. This seemed rational, as a
 corrupt module would either have shown up with a disk read error, or a not
 ready. Also, most corrupt modules (at least in those days) were the result of
 xmodem padding, which was implicitly stripped at module load time.
 
 Good fix...

   Another thing you might check is the attributes of the WIZ files and modules

 I'm just getting back to read the mail and am glad to see that you have
 succeeded in getting your WIZ to fly.  I used it (the wizpro variant) as my
 telecom program of choice on the COCO for several years and was always happy
 with the results.  Lately I have had to switch to STERM on my TC70 (and tonight
 am using TELIX on a PC because the TC70 is under the weather so to speak) but
 would be very happy if there were a WIZPRO for the TC70.  Come to think that
 should be relatively easy to port given that wizpro is mostly basic09 but the
 sources would be required.. Runtime is not going to work until a few addresses
 have changed and also the screen work.  Interestin project for someone, Bill
 Brady has not been about for a while but I do beliwve he had been looking at a
 TOMCAT 6809 machineand would bet he will be thinking. Back to your problem -
 when you patched your original wizpro to take into account the new addresses -
 did you verify the modules?  They could have been lurking about - but I don't
 know how you were loading them from floppy if that is the case.  Hmm - all's
 well that ends well . Bob

 Did you by any chance have something merged with RUNB before and not now? Has
 you bootfile size increased so that now there is not enough room in 64k to get
 runb and all of the WIZ files? That's usually the reason for process not found.
 If it was not on disk I would have expected a file not found or maybe wrong
 attributes.

 I did not have anything merged to RunB before, since all except it are merged
 into the program itself.  Yes, I have since changed my bootfile to include a
 few more modules for the H/D.  But, I did remake the old floppy Boot to contain
 these new modules.  When I run the old/new floppy Boot, it runs fine when dd is
 d0.  It seems like it just refuses to run off the H/D.

 This is the original WIZ, which just has the directory COM that holds the

 except RunB, merged in it already.  Even still, I have merged all the pertinant
 B09 files into a Runb.1, and load it prior to running the program.

 Glad to hear that Vprint is working. Yup, ya found a bug...I create some
 strings to do the searching for the init file. Unfortunately, by the it gets
 down to looking in /h0 my code used strcpy() instead of sprintf()!
 
 Well, that's fixed. So fire your disk in the mail to me and I'll be glad to
 update it. In the meantime, you can do one of three things:
 
  1. Set the shell variable VPTDIR to /h0/sys,
  2. Set the shell variable HOME to /h0,
  3. Load a /dd descriptor which matches /h0.
 
 Sorry about the phone call. That does sound expensive. Hmmm, that was during
 prime time, wasn't it? Maybe it's time to check out rates with ATT, etc....
 
 Up to now, we've not had any competition on longdistance phone rates in Canada.
 The govt. just changed it's rules and a couple of outfits have been given
 premission to interconnect and set up shop. It'll be interesting to see what
 happens here with rates--they are much higher than what you are used to paying.

 Even if the VPTDIR stuff works, do send the disk back anyway--there are some

 Hey, how can you tell what kind of switchboard we have here? You are
 right--it's an old mechanical thing (even though I'm convinced that at times
 they still bring in an old gal who does the connects via phone-plugs). Until
 they get a new switch here, I'm unable to tap into nicities like call waiting,
 etc. Maybe just as well...my bill is high enuf. But the mechanical relays cause
 lots of noice too, at times. It's been on the telephone company's list for
 years now. I wonder if the coming deregulation in Canada will hinder or help
 these projects?

 This makes no sense. You're the 2nd person who reports no errors. So far, I'm
 the only one reporting errors. Funny thing is that I got the errors when I
 still had my single board proto system--so I'm wondering if there is something
 with my hardware causing the problem? I've got a 3.5" Hitachi and a 5" CDC. No
 terminator resistor--I tryed installing one and found that the system would not
 access the 3" drive when I added one. Also, if I take the 5" out of the system,
 I still get the error if I try just accessing the non-existant drive, so I
 sort-of doubt that it is hardware. Anyone?

 I have never heard of a problem like what you mentioned.  Perhaps you should
 post CRCs for the modules in question (RBF, 33C93, d0, d1, etc) and see if that
 is the cause.  Other than that, I'd say you have a hardware problem.

 Mark, Well, it (the crashing of floppies) is definitely a bug here on my
 system. If it is a hardware bug, where do you suggest I look. Remember, this
 same bug was present on my proto (single board) system. At the time I just
 figured it was the software... At this point the only things the same are the
 3.5" floppy (and the case).
 
 Here are the current drivers I'm using:
 
   d0       #14   crc - 998410
   d1       #14   crc - BA83F3
   rb37c65  #4    crc - 1768E9
   rbf      #79   crc - F098AF
 
 For hardware, I have 3.5" floppy and a 5" 80 track. I've disconnected the 80
 and still get the same results. Just to refresh the debate, here is how to get
 the bug:
 
  1. boot normally (I do it from the 3.5" and the process continues on /h0),
  2. attempt to access /d1 with the drive door open (dir /d1 "works" fine),
  3. after an error is generated, attempt to access /d0 (again, do something
     like dir /d0)--at this point I get an error!
 
 With no disk in d1 the light on d0 flashes after 5 seconds, then the error is
 reported after another 5 secs. If I remove the drive completely, the error is
 reported right after the flash.
 
 However, if you do an access to /d0 before all this (again, dir /d0 works)
 everything appears to work okay.
 
 BTW, I don't have a terminator on /d1. I put one on to test things, but then
 the 3.5 became unaccessable, even for the boot process.

 Bob,
 
 Well, you had this bug in your prototype system, then I would think it might be
 the cable or the dirve itself.  I have not been able to reproduce this on my
 system, nor have I heard of anyone else having this problem.
 
 The terminating resistor may or may not be a problem.  Some drives need to have
 them and some don't.  When you mix drives, you run into the problem of either
 both drives need them, neither do, or one or the other do before you get
 reliable results.  The only other answer might be you are running a different
 version of RBF or the floppy drivers.  Check that all out (with the CRC) and
 see what they are.

 Well, Mark, I did post the CRC's in my last message. I assume that they are the
 latest. I did detatch the 5" drive completely, and still got the error. So I
 guess that leaves the cable or the 3" drive. Sounds pretty unlikely to me that
 either one could be causeing this weird problem. However, I will try a new
 cable one of these days. Will the mm/1 boot from a 5" drive? Just a matter of
 making a boot disk? If it's that easy I could pull the 3" drive and see if
 that's causing the problem.

 If you did post CRCs then I didn't see them.  Maybe you can post them again, or
 the Sysops here can go back and find that message and point me to it (hint hint
 Steve).
 
 It is very possible that the cable can be causing your problem, or the 3.5 inch
 drive.  If you have any other drives to try, then you should do that and see
 what happens.  As for booting from a 5.25 inch drive, OS-9/OSK doesn't care
 what the drive type or size is.  All it looks for is the LSN0 data which points
 it to the sector where the bootfile is. Then it just issues a seek command to
 get to that sector and it starts to read.  Of course, OSK Ver 2.4 can now bring
 in a bootfile that is fragmented, but older versions and OS-9 can't.  The long
 and the short of it is--if you can make a bootfile on the disk, it can be
 booted from that disk.
 
 I always make my boot disks on an Atari formatted disk cause I don't like to
 use up a HD disk just to hold the bootfile.  I have also been able to boot from
 a Universal format and a CoCo format disk.

 You will probably find what looks like a DIP socket with a "chip" containing 8

 out.  By the way - no need to buy a new link chip if the pin 0 is cut - just
 turn it around end for end.  I don't think number 8 is of any consequence to
 the Tandon.  - this is a single or double sided disk? Bob

 Thanks for the reply Bob.  I ended up ordering a real drive.  The system gave
 me a scare when it didn't work with the new drive. It did work eventually, so
 maybe I have a bad cable.  Now that my HD is up and running again, I don't
 worry too much about the floppies.

 Mike - did I hear you say that the new Ultimuse will run on the TC70 already?
 or is that soon?  HmW@has it gone about getting a midi port?  This from a TC70

 Exists there a patch for the Disto no halt driver to allow it to work with
 PCDOS? I am tired of having to keep switching to SDISK (and, in the process,
  each time I want to transfer a file.

 The Disto driver is very different from the patch you've used on the usual
 driver.  I have never seen a patch such as you described.  On my system I tried
 using the Disto driver as though it were patched and it worked fine, not only
 for PCDos but also RSDos.  Try using the Disto driver as it is on disks with no
 critical data on them and see if it works reliably on your system too.

 Erich,
 
 I had already tried using the Disto no-halt driver as-is with PCDOS, but tried
 it again just to be sure, with the same result. Any attempt to access a DOS
 diskette with PCDOS simply results in the message "Not a DOS diskette".
 Switching to SDISK corrects the problem, but leaves me without buffered I/O on
 the drives. Odd that yours should work OK and mine not, though.

 Try one more time using the Disto driver, but this time use a 360K DOS disk
 with no more than 1-2 files totaling no more than 100K in size.  Regardless of
 driver I have had a great deal of difficulty using PCDos with DOS disks
 exceeding these numbers.  For a 720K disk, the limit seems to be 1 file no
 larger than 100K.  I asked about this problem in this Forum last year and no
 one came up with an answer, and I haven't figured it out either. Also be sure
 you have at least 32K free memory before you load PCDos (even more is better). 
 I've had problems with it when less memory was free.

 I've heard of others using the no-halt drivers (Disto's, that is) with PCDOS. I
 use Sardis No-Halt controllers with SDISK3, so I don't encounter the problems
 that you're facing.  However, there are folks in my CoCo Group here that have

 I use PCDOS with the Disot SC-2 with out any problems. Just remember, if it is
 a file other than an ASCII file, use PCDOS-raw -get or utils suck as UNZIP will
 not work. I came in late so perhaps this thread has already addressed thjis,

 Hi!  Bro!
 
 I think maybe you replied to the wrong person.  I wasn't having problems with
 Disto SC-2 (since I don't own one).  There were some other folks that I was
 responding to that were however having problems trying to get the SC-2 drivers
 to work with PCDOS.  It could be something as simple as trying to access a
 double sided diskette on a single-sided drive.  Who knows.
 
 My response was simple to add a comment that I knew of some folks in our club
 that use DISTO SC-2 successfully with PCDOS.

 There's a guy down here in Dallas, that has had to resort to basically the same
 thing.  That is, if he wants to use his system to read PC-created diskette,
 then he reboots with a patched CC3Disk, but in this mode his No-Halt feature is
 not in use.  When he boots with his Disto-supplied drivers, he has the No-Halt
 features, but he can't read PC-DOS diskettes.  I'm still waiting to hear from
 one other guy down here to see what his solutioin is, but right now it don't
 look too good.

    Which Disto driver works with PCdos ? .irq or .slp ? Neither of them work
 for me. I also have a separate disk I boot with when I want to use PCdos. I've
 since given up on PCdos and just connected my COCO serially to my AST286. The
 COCO sends files fine at 19.2 kbaud and receives them reliably at 4800 baud.

 Right - none of the Disto SC-II drivers work with PCDOS... you have to make a

 Pete,
         
         The only thing is, it usually runs fine for a while, then just locks up
 for no apparent reason.  I does it quite frequently during d/ling, which
 present quite a problem.  I have only found it locking up once on a menu screen
 of a BBS.
         I was under the understanding that the 6309 only effected the modules
 that were patched, and there abilities to use the extra register W.  I do not
 think the processor is actually faster.

 Locking up after a period is an indication of overheating (or mismatched speed
 rating). I used to have some EPROMS that acted like that... fine for 20 minutes
 or so, then wham.
 
 I'm not sure what the 4in1 uses for serial port chips (Steve Wegert may), but
 you may want to verify that their 6551's are rated for proper speed a
 coco3/1.87MHZ clocking. Also, are you using an IRQ hack line for your
 interrupts? If not, this may buy you some solidity... see IRQHAK.TXT in
 DL(1?)...

         I have since removed the Slotpak, and just have the SCII directly
 plugged into the computer.  That is, since I got the SCII & 4-in-1.  So, I
 don't have a hacked IRQ.
         I found the computer locked up today in about 10 minutes, while using
 Supercomm.  The other day I was d/ling a 560k program, and got about 360K
 before it crapped out.  So, I think the heat problem is out.  I believe the
 4in1 uses the 6551a chips.  Do you think this still may be the problem?

         I am trying to rule out the heat problem, since the WIZ is doing just
 fine now.  It has its own descriptor M2W, and isn't locking up now.  Also, I
 have had the computer on for about 10 minutes and then the t2 will lock up,
 then I have had it on for 50 minutes and the t2 locks up.
         Wouldn't the t2 lock-up about the same time every time??  If
 overheatingwere the problem.

 Not necessarily.... is the room ambient temerature always the same? Are you
 always running the same code in similar sequence?
 
 Suggestions:
 
 o - Install IRQ hack o - Throw heat sinks on UART chips o - Put a fan in the
 area (better yet, put a muffin fan on the box) o - Take the system apart and
 reseat/clean everything
 
 Also, is there any special reason you're using WiZ? I recall in the early days
 that folks had nothing but trouble with it, and it was VERY hardware specific
 (i.e. hardwired code). It required several iterations to get it working
 properly.  Perhaps something vanilla such as Xcom9 or Sterm is a better choice
 until you get the problem resolved.

 It's not DIRT that's the concern... it's OXIDATION. Radio Shack, in their

 Pete- I received my 6309 in the mail today and installed it. When I tried to
 download from CIS at 2400 my /t2 locked up. My coco is always covered when not
 in use so is spotless inside. I have had a muffin fan in my coco for about 6
 months now so cooling isn't a problem. I feel the problem is software related.
 Specifically to the Powerboost software. The com program I am using is Sterm,
 so your recommendation to Bob to use it won't help. Another problem I have
 encountered after upgrading (not sure if that is a good term at present) is
 that when I use Mmulti-vue I get vertical "ghost" lines appearing on the top
 half of the screen. The lines are linked to the mouse pointer. As the pointer
 moves up the lines move up and vise-versa. My coco worked perfectly before the
 socalled upgrade. Any other ideas!! :-(

 Randy - perhaps something got flexed during installation of the 6309.  Have you
 tried the usual tapping or cleaning of the GIME?  Did you reinstall the bottom
 circuit board shield (and make sure there were no metal shavings)?
 
 Did you install a socket (I hope!)?  If so, do you have a 6809 you could stick
 in to see if it still works okay that way?

 On the T2 issue.... are you running the IRQ hack? That really does make a big

 The ghosting... hmmm. I'm not familiar with powerboost, but I do remember that
 the 6309 could be clocked at 3Mhz... Has the effective rate been bumped up? Are
 they doing the old 'manual video refresh'?

 See IRQHAK.TXT in DL2... It physically connects the 6551's IRQ line to the
 6?09's IRQ line, which avoids some of the pass through problems associated with
 the hardware in the middle.

 Rainbow.The port is completely hard wired so no MPI problems. I put my 6809

 Randy,
 
 Your problem is probably due to the powerboost code and your serial port drives
 not being too happy with each other.  I believe a few people over on the lesser
 service (starts with a "D" - grin) were having similar problems.  Don't know
 what the wanswer was, if there was one.  Hmmmm, I think something was said
 about using Bruce Isted's SACIA driver.  In any case, it is not Sterm that is
 causing the problem.
 
 Opps...that should be "serial port drivers" above.  Sorry.

      I am using a stock /t2 driver except for a patch to the address for the
 port to work with the internal RS-232 port mod from May 1989 Rainbow. When I
 tried 2400 baud yesterday it worked without a problem. Now I don't know if it
 was a freak occurance from something I did or if there is really a problem. My
 'ghost' line problem is getting worse though. This problem goes away when I put
 the 6809 back in so it seems to indicate a bad CPU. Can't think of anything
 else that would cause it. I used the same boot disk without Powerbooster
 installed to test the CPUs. It was very consistant. I appreciate your input as
 to what my system problems could be from. The more ideas I get, the better my
 understanding of how the system works.
 
 Many thanks to everyone on their input. Randy

 Randy,
 
 What 'ghost line' problem are you having?  If you are refering to a double
 image problem, perhaps it is due to a slight change in horizontal sweep
 frequency due to the change in the CPU.  Hmmmmm...maybe not, that should be
 taken care of by the GIME.  But then again, the sparklies problem could be
 taken care of by changing the CPU, still a 68B09 just a difference
 manufacturer.  I fixed mine by installing an AMD chip.
 
 Strange.

 Mark-
      I get these ghost vertical lines when I amon a high res screen that has a
 white background and the mouse pointer is active. As I move the pointer up and
 down the lines follow. With the pointer at the bottom right corner of the
 screen the lines cover the top 3/4 of the screen. When the pointer is moved to
 the top of the screen, the lines are gone. I am using GSHELL+ and when I press
 'S' for a shell window, the lines also go away. They do come back when I close
 the shell window though. The lines also get worse the longer my system is
 running. It takes about 5 minutes for them to even show up. As I mentioned
 earlier, I do have a muffin fan in my computer and when I put my 6809 back in
 the lines never show up. It has to be a wierd 6309 since that is the only thing
 that I changed. There is no reasonable explanation.

 Pete,
         Your absolutely right about the cheap tin.  Come to find out, that it
 was just the clock module causing all our Lock-up problems.  At least as far as
 me and another guy can tell.  He just gave the new clock module at our Phoenix
 COCO Club meeting earlier this evening.  So far, 2 hours and counting, now
 lock-ups.  Thanks for all your input.

 Great.. glad it was simple (as hoped). That's one of the more disappointing
 things about the coco family... It wasn't very robust. Every now and then it'd
 lock up in the middle of a term paper, the world's greatest C program, or
 whatever because of the oxidization.

 When using it at 1200 & 2400 both, the t2 will lock up.
 
 I am going to ask a couple of other people that are having the problem, if they
 have the IRQ hack.  If that is the case, it must be in the t2 decriptor.
 
 What realy gets me, is now that the WIZ is working okay, its descriptor isn't
 locking up (M2W).  So, it must not be the 6551 chips.

 I would suggest replacing ACIAPAK with SACIA and the T2 thats in the archive I
 used to have problems with some lock ups and lost chars (even though I have an
 IRQ hack) but once I replaced the drivers it works great. even supercomm can
 handle 9600 baud ok now. where with aciapak it lost characters all the time
 
 SACIA is in the eliminator package available here.

 Ah yes... if a key is down during boot, you get an error.  Dunno why...
 
 Have you tried a different diskette for the boot, btw?  I know it doesn't sound
 related (and probably isn't), but you never know.  The two times that I
 couldn't get a boot to work it turned out that reformatting solved it. Again
 tho, this doesn't sound like the case for you, but thought I'd mention it.

 Yes, it was the key stuck down that did it, I can duplicate the error by
 holding any key down. I think my cat is responsible for the busted/stuck key,
 he likes to stretch out across the keyboard whenever I'm out of the room, that
 and the fact that its not the greatest keyboard around.
 
 I did try booting from different disks, including a copy of the original 3M
 boot disk, same result. I discovered that when I was able to get my system to
 boot that the version of cio in memory had a bad CRC. It was also much larger
 than the cio I have in my CMDS dir. I saved the cio with the bad CRC (I assume
 this is the cio in the rom) and then verified it with DED to fix the CRC, now
 all is well. Wierd.

 I think the 2.4 math and cio modules are different from 2.3 and previous.
 
 I ran into a similar thing on the TC70... I was trying to use the 2.4 "irqs"
 command so I could see all the 68070 interrupt vectors, and got one of those
 errors.
 
 A lot of us have discovered that we're using old commands, btw.  I finally
 noticed that I'd never installed the lastest basic/runb, for instance.

 If I can ever get it to boot, I'll check that out. But why it would work some

 Bill, I wonder if the ROMs are decaying? Sometimes when I boot my system the
 'dir' command doesn't appear in the stuff in the ROMs, so the first dir goes to
 the disk to load itself. (I found this out when I started to use a replacement
 dir--sometimes I'd get the old one, sometimes the new one). My theory
 (dangerous ground here) is that sometimes a bit or two in the ROM is incorrect
 at the point where dir is located, so it's not mapped in. Could be that in your
 case it's a bad bit in cio. Maybe I should pull the ROMS and just reburn a copy
 and see what happens (but I'm too lazy). Hummm, one other thing I noticed is
 that it depends on how you boot. I had more luck getting 'dir' to appear in
 memory when I held RESET down for a few seconds than if I used 'break' or hit
 it momentarily.

 Bob,
 
 I think you're right, I'm thinking about ordering the new ROMs for the MM/1
 anyway (but I'm a little annoyed at the price). It looks like just a bit or two
 got messed up in the cio in the ROMs, resulting in a bad CRC. The real problem
 is that the cio I have on disk is not compatible with any of the system
 utilities, so I got the traphandler error. I found I was able to get the cio
 module with the bad CRC to stay in memory by forcing an error during the boot
 process by holding a key down (funny thing is I would never have known about
 this if it weren't for a stuck key!) when the system tries to recover from that
 error, the modules in ROM don't get rechecked, or something. I now have a
 possibly corrupted version of cio, but so far it appears to be working.
 
 This brings up another problem I've got. If I hit reset to reboot, it hangs
 trying to ccess thehard drive I can onlyreboot by pwering of and back o.
 I suspect its juimingproblem, ut where isthe prem?Any ideas?I
 have a Seagatedrive and th latest (s faI now) rivers.

 Try this string of commands to test modules in memory (including ROM):
 
  mdir -u ! grep -v sysgo ! ident -qmz
 
 If your ROM is going south you should get bad CRCs for the ROM modules.
 
 You can also use this method as a brute force quick and dirty memory test by
 loading the entire contents of the CMDS directory into RAM and doing the same
 thing. This can get tricky as some programs like to put non OS9 modules in the
 CMDS directory which then won't load. I got around this by giving all of the
 all of the non OS9 modules uppercase names and using the command string:
 
   dir -u ! grep [a-z] ! load -zd
 
 I think that's close, I'm doing this all from memory.  Hope this helps.

 Thanks, Jay. I just tried what you suggested, and came up with all good crc's.
 I'm beginning to think that only the cio module is bad. But I did do this after
 booting and loading many modules that are probably also in rom, so its not a
 good test of only what's in rom, I'll try this next time I boot. As long as I
 get the right version of cio loaded right away in the startup file, all the
 problems go away.

 Kevin,
        Hi.  For sw receivers to have facility for computer control, you have to
 get into the middle price range, Icom R71a for $850,list or Kenwood R5000 for
 about the same price.  These two are available used for about $200 cheaper. 
 There the JRC series give you better specs, and more features for more dough. 
 The Japan Radio nrd525 at about $1000 and the Drake R8 for the same price are
 the next step up.  Check out Monitoring Times for the latest adds, and reviews.
 The JRC command set, I feel, is the easiest to program.  In fact you could
 control the receiver about 80% via rs232, but being a knob twiddler, I would
 rather just let the computer do what it does best, keep data bases of
 frequencies and let me spin the dials.  You really need a fine touch to bring
 in those Papua New Guinea stations.

 Kev,
       So you were a radio operator with the military? As I recall, you were
 navy.  Are you familiar with the R390A? That was a great receiver; still is.  I
 saw a couple for sale at a recent swap, $200 asking, but I saw a guy talk it
 down to $80 each.  As a jarhead, we got to work 6 meters with the an/prc-25. 
 Not as neat as the 390, but then again, I wouldn't want to carry the 390 very
 far!
     I've seen reviews for addons to scanner receivers that give computer
 control.  These are various forms of interfaces that parallel the keypads, and
 invariably are associated with msdos software.  But I don't do much listening
 above 30 mhz.

 Tom,
 
 I was an electronic warfare voice-intercept operator/linguist for the Army
 Security Agency (a military branch of NSA).  Our job was to eavesdrop on and
 track North Korean military transmissions.  At first I operated from the NSA
 Field Station in mid-South Korea, but then was transferred to a tactical outfit
 up at the DMZ (I have lots of horror stories about that! :-).
 
 Yep, I remember the 390... we trained on it, but never used it in the field.
 There, we used either vans mounted on the back of 5/4 ton trucks (TRQ-23? and
 later TRQ-32) or backpack receiver sets (TRQ-30), plus jeep-mounted jammers
 (TLQ-17) and truck-mounted jammers (GLQ-3).  Oh, and microwave DF (MLQ-??). The
 gear used at the Field Station is something I probably still can't talk about.
 
 We would've killed for a portable digital receiver/DF-unit at the time (they
 got them a few years later on).  Instead, we spent most of our time "knobbing"
 through several bands by hand.  To this day, I hate static and headphones :)
 
 ASA is where I met Marsha, btw.  She was in my Korean class, and later was at
 the Field Station, which was about 50 klicks south of where I was... so I'd
 often go AWOL on the weekends to see her ;-)
 
 So you were a Marine?  Yikes!  <grin> -  kevin

 - geez.  I guess there is not a lot of work for German Linguists in that field
 any more - I would like to get back to Berlin now that thw "wall" is gone. 
 Ditto on the earphones and static too, I remember listening to a weak signal -
 far away - and then you hear a transport pilot right over your head (Berlin)
 key his mike.... see if you can get to the controls before he talks and your
 eardrums touch in the middle of your head. (So loud you can taste it).  Did
 most of my last enlistment at NSA.  Got my intro to computers there.  Man, what
 I coulda done with this MM/1 on my desk.

 John,
 
 No kidding?  They sent you to a University to learn German instead of to DLI?
 Lucky dog!  BTW, I had six years of high school and college German under my
 belt when I joined up... so naturally the Army picked Korean for my language. 
 Figures, eh?
 
 Yeah, at the tactical outfit we'd be complaining about how our 20-year-old
 unheated quonset huts were like Swiss cheese to the Mongolian/Siberian cold
 wind, while our USAF counterparts down at Osan were complaining about the tint
 on their room color TV being slightly off :-)   Man, you USAF had it made!
 
 You're right; what we could've done with personal computers back then. DF, etc.
 And back in the US before I got out, I made a jammer mockup out of cardboard,
 wood and plastic.  Boy, if we'd had even just CoCo's back then, I could've
 instead done a trainer which actually "worked" and had feedback.
 
 There's an awful lot of ex-Intel types on CIS, btw.  I run into AF/Army EW and
 NSA people all the time around here.  I guess wanting to be in the comm links
 just gets into the blood :-)    cheers - kevin

 Kevin,
 
 Hehe, I wanted to get into electronics when I joined - but the USAF found out I
 was partly color-blind.  My high school spanish teacher would have been
 astounded to learn that I had an "aptitude" for languages.
 
 The army types did have one little advantage - by the time I made SSGT (air
 force E-5), most of my army friends were E-6 and had been for quite a while.
 
 I do claim one personal record - I spent almost 8 years in the USAF and never
 flew on a military airplane.
 
 Off the subject, but I was wondering if you know of a way to generate a NULL
 from the MM/1 keyboard - for printer control strings in a text file and such. 
 The only way I have found is to make a file containing just a NULL and then get
 EMACS to insert it in my text.

 John,
 
 You didn't miss anything by not flying... we got shipped around in the back
 along with trucks and jeeps;  it was cold, noisy and uncomfortable... and
 sometimes dangerous:  the vehicles sometimes broke loose on takeoff, fuel cans
 with tightened lids would pop and spray fuel from pressure drops. Fortunately,
 such stuff always happened to the plane in front or behind the one I was on. 
 Still, I'd rather drive instead :-)
 
 In the later keyboard drivers, a CTRL-space created a null.  I'm redoing the
 driver again with input from Eddie Kuns and Tim Kientzle to add more.
 
 cheers - kev

 Shucks, Mark, you may indeed be correct that CIS is better here than CI$, but
 I've been calling CIS "CI$" since 1984, both here, on the service, and
 elsewhere.
 
 If Delphi, Genie or Prodigy had an "S" in it, I'd probably transpose a "$" for
 the S.
 
 No insult is meant towards CIS, but is IS a pay-per-usage service.
 
 I like CIS so much better than I frankly like Delphi, that I re-signed up for
 the service a short while ago.  (I got my start telecommunicating right here on
 this service.)
 
 I'll try to keep my S's as S's, but if a $ shows up, then no insult intended
 towards either CIS or any member of this service.

 I believe you have gotten into a habit which will take some time to break.  I
 for one do not like to see CI$ since it is all to often used as a cut-down for
 this service, which may be more expensive then any of the others (note I say
 "may"), but then, you get what you pay for don't you?

 I agree, Mark...this service may indeed be more expensive than the others, but
 I do find the message bases here much more informative and to the point than,
 say, on Delphi.  The questions here are straight, to the point, and the answers
 are eually straight and to the point.
 
 I joined CI$ (CIS) back in 1983 when I got my first CoCo, and remained a member
 for over 5 years.  In all that time, I referred to this service as CI$...not as
 an insult, but more as a reminder to those who called my BBS that this was a
 pay-per-usage service (unlike my BBS, which was free, of course).
 
 Many others called this CI$, I do not own the copyright on this phrasing.
 
 But, I will try to not ruffle any feathers here, and try to remember CIS.

 Bob,
 
 If all you want to do is read mail online, then CIS is not the cheapest service
 to use.  If, however, you are interested in getting the best publically
 available software, and download it at a reasonable cost, then CIS becomes more
 competitive with the other services.  For that matter, grabbing the entire
 message bease every day or so, and then reading offline is much cheaper than
 online reading.  This is why I said "may".

 I understand that RiBBS will EVENTUALLY be ported over to OSK, but that is
 supposed to be a couple of years off.
 
 StG should be coming out with an OSK BBS for OS9 pretty soon, and they claim
 that it'll have Usenet accesses, in addition to their own networking.  StG,
 BTW, has probably 20-30 nodes hooked up now.  Not a huge network like FidoNet,
 but it does have a pretty decent userbase.

 You got that right, Kevin.
 
 I wasn't sure exactly what the advertising prices were, so I gave Alan a call
 this morning to see what they were.
 
 For those who might be interested, here's a few representative prices:
 
                             1 month       3 months     6 months
   1/4 page                   7.50          15            30
   1/2 page                   10            20            34
   IBC/IFC                    25            50            95
 
 Camera ready art is required for the ads, but, if you don't have something
 ready, Alan is a graphics artist, and can (easily and inexpensively) whip up
 something to your liking.
 
 Shucks, a programmer could invest only $30 and have an ad displaying his work
 for 6 months.  I'll bet beer, for most programmers, is more than $30 for 6
 months.  (grin)

 As for OS-9 CN, we have success in communicating with those in Europe and
 Australia as well. I have been thinking about the many discussions of ideas
 related to OS-9 CN, and the old/new users group, in particular what you had to
 say. I feel very strongly the OS-9 Community needs both. The Users' Group is
 better suited to support business users, and those that can easily afford to
 access such services as Delphi, CIS, and the Internet family of networks, and
 to send in for membership for the Users' Group. I will apply for membership,
 although the first time didn't work out well for me, or many of us. OS-9 CN has
 its place, too. OS-9 CN is for amateur users of OS-9, in particular those with
 an extremly small budget. Many Australian and European users are now able to
 communicate with us because we use the most inexpensive means. On the other
 hand, services such as Delphi are prohibitively expensive (Delphi is $18.00 an
 hour for me, although CIS is $12.80 an hour living in Hawaii). It is even more
 expensive for Canadian users to communicate. Because we are amateurs and use
 the most inexpensive means to communicate, OS-9 users outside of the U.S. have
 given OS-9 CN much support in their communications efforts. I feel we need both
 groups to serve the OS-9 Community, so why not make sure there is
 communications between our groups? As for an efficient means, we are working on
 it. I tried Internet/UUCP, but lost my feed and don't know where to get another
 affordable one. I come to CIS regularly (once every one or two weeks), so we
 can start with that. Also, many other representatives of OS-9 CN visit CIS and
 Delphi regularly, and I am compiling a list of user names.

 Nice to see you are around.  I thought you had disappeared.
 
 I certainly think the OS-9 community needs the OS-9 User Group.  I know the
 first time didn't work out well.  In fact, it probably bothered me more than
 you to see all of my several years of hard work go down the drain.  But I
 believe that it will work better this time.
 
 Living where I do, the value of OS-9 CN isn't as clear.  As I have mentioned
 before, I don't know where to find Fido or what I would do with it if I found
 it.  But I trust you judgement that it is useful to a group of OS-9 users.  And
 I don't see how the goals of the OS-9 UG and the OS-9 CN conflict with each
 other or exclude the other.  Surely some folks will want to be members of both.
 I agree that effort should be put into cross pollination.  For example, perhaps
 the OS-9 CN would like to use the MOTD to keep non-Fido people abreast of the
 OS-9 CN doings.
 
 Like you, I don't know an efficient means to stay in communication.  A local
 public access Unix connection is reasonable in price, but isn't available
 everywhere.  For now, CIS is a common intersection. StG net is growing, but
 again the cost of moving news around has to be borne by someone.  Have you
 tried to interest the StG guys in OS-9 CN?  There appears to be some redundant
 effort there.

 I received my upgrade today so I dove in and did it. Only one problem, when
 using Multi-vue I get many flickering "ghost" lines at the top of the screen.
 They seem linked to the mouse pointer. If I move the pointer down, the lines
 move lower down on the screen. They move back up as the pointer moves up. Do
 you have any similar problems?

 Dear Randy,
 
 No, I do not seem to have that problem. I use the GSHELL1.24a version and have
 some other patches. Unfortunately, I did not always keep good notes of how I
 put the boot/system together. But I will check to see if I have anything that
 greatly deviates from stock. I have the patched GRFDRV and the INIT patch to
 fix the rollover problem. I know that they are here on CIS. I'll be in touch.
 
 With all best wishes, Br. Jeremy, CSJW

 Br. Jeremy,
 
     I also use gshell 1.24a. Have install the grfdrv patch but haven't heard of
 the INIT patch. Maybe I should get that also. Any modification that I hear of I
 make to my system so I have quite a few patches to my system. As I mentioned to
 Pete Lyall, I reinstalled my 6809 and the vertical 'ghost' lines that were
 appearing on my hi-res screen on white backgrounds went away. I will check on
 getting a replacement 6309.
      Take care 'til I hear from you again. Randy.

 Carl, I am interested in porting some C code from CoCo Level II to OSK MM/1 but
 I need some assistance with your CGFX library.
 
 Does _gs_scadd do the same thing as the _ss_mgpb call in cgfx.l in CoCo OS9?
 
 Also, do you really mean Point(path,x,y) instead of Point(path)?
 
 99% of my code is compatible except for the loading and saving of .vef files
 for graphics windows.  Obviously I have to go to another format for saving the
 pictures.  Any suggestions?

 Bert,
 
 You should be addressing your questions to Mike Haaland, the author of the MM/1
 C graphics library.  I can tell you though, if something is not in the library
 that was in the CoCo version, it is probably because it is not supported by the
 OSK version of windio.
 
 If you haven't, you might what to check the libraries for the latest version of
 cgfx for the MM/1.  Mike did a newer version for the latest release of windio
 and you might have an older copy.  Look in DL16 or DL12.

 To: all
 
 Anyone have any *minor* <grin> suggestions before I post windio v42 in a couple
 of days?
 
 For example, someone suggested that the default keypad mode on boot should be
 numeric (ie: hitting NUMLOCK would actually change to cursor key mode)... since
 everyone has separate cursor keys and thus the numbers would be available right
 away.  Sounds like a good idea to me.
 
 Stuff along those lines.  Then we can start on the big stuff (allowing programs
 to move/resize/etc).

 Not a suggestion, but I do notice that sometimes my keyboard will not switch
 from NUMLOCK mode to normal. Seems that after the first toggle it doesn't want
 to switch back. Don't know if this is the keyboard or the software? Also, why
 not have the initial mode as an option (maybe set in /dd/sys/keyboard.env).
 This file could also have other options in it (like having the Fkeys generate
 values, instead of being screen selectors).

 Larry -
 
 Your problem are the lines:
 
    char *a[5];
     ....        AND
    gets(a[x]);
 
 If that's the way the book reads, you should shoot the author!
 
 In the statement:   char *a[5]
 
 You're stating that 'a' is an array of pointers with 5 elements. These pointers
 point at SOMETHING of type 'char' - but WHAT? You haven't allocated any space
 for them to point at, nor have you initialized the pointers to point AT
 anything. There's no magic in C.. you have to do all the dirtywork yourself
 (grin).
 
 This problem doesn't rear its ugly head until:
 
   gets(a[x]);
 
 Which says: get a string [terminated by a return] from the keyboard (STDIN),
 and stuff it in the location pointed to by the pointer I'm giving you.... Well,
 we already know that the pointer is crap, and we have no idea what it points
 to, AND whatever it DOES point to will be clobbered.
 
 This program could be made to work by changing the declaration of 'a' to:  char
 a[5][256], which states that 'a' is an array of 5 arrays of 256 characters.
 This pre-allocates space to put the strings in, and also implicitly supplies
 pointers to the 0th character of each 256 character array when you call it
 a[0], a[1], etc. (in C, an array NAME by itself is the same as the pointer to
 the 1st [0th] element of the array... i.e. 'a' is the same as &a[0], and a[4]
 is the same a[4][0].

 Larry - I'd have never come up with as elegant and simple a solution as Pete,
 but I thought I'd add some thoughts.  I know that you are also a 6809 rma
 programmer, so another way to help learn C is to look at the compiler output
 (eg: "cc test.c -ca" which will stop with a "test.a" source listing).
 
 For example, the goofed up source they gave (shortened up here) was:
 
 main()
 {    int x;
      char *a[5];
      for (x = 0; x <= 5; ++x)
           gets(a[x]);
 }
 
 Compiled with the -ca option, you get this (#comments are mine):
 
  psect test_c,0,0,0,0,0
 * main()
 * {
  ttl main
 main:
  pshs u
  ldd #_1
  lbsr _stkcheck
 
 * int x;
 * char *a[5];
 * for (x = 0; x <= 5; ++x)
  leas -12,s  # make room on stack for int_x and 5 pointers (2+5*2)
  clra
  clrb
  std 10,s    # x=0
  lbra _4     # enter "for" loop
 
 * gets(a[x]);
 _2
  ldd 10,s    # x
  aslb        # multiply * 2 as index into array ([x])
  rola        
  leax 0,s    # point to beginning of array
  leax d,x    # now point to a[x]
  ldd 0,x     # pick up a[x]    <<< contains pointer to ?? nothing!
  pshs d      # push on stack as parameter for gets
  lbsr gets   # call gets function
  leas 2,s    # drop parameter
 * }
 _5
  ldd 10,s    # x = x+1
  addd #1
  std 10,s
 _4
  ldd 10,s    # x
  cmpd #5     # <= 5 ?
  lble _2     # yes, loop
 _3
  leas 12,s   # else exit
  puls u,pc
 
 _1 equ -82
  endsect
 
 So it was pretty easy to see that the parameter picked up and passed to
 the gets function pointed to who-knows-what, yah?   (cont'd in reply)

 So now we look at Pete's example (very slightly modified):
 
 main() {    int x;
      char a[5][200];
      for (x = 0; x <= 5; ++x)
           gets(a[x]); }
 
  psect test_c,0,0,0,0,0 * main() * {
  ttl main main:
  pshs u
  ldd #_1
  lbsr _stkcheck
 
 * int x; * char a[5][200]; * * for (x = 0; x <= 5; ++x)
  leas -1002,s  # make room for int_x and 5*200 one-byte chars
  clra
  clrb
  std 1000,s    # x=0
  lbra _4       # enter "for" loop
 
 * gets(a[x]); _2
  ldd 1000,s    # x
  pshs d
  ldd #200      # size of each array element
  lbsr  ccmult  # multiply stack param (x) * array_element_size
  leax 0,s      # point to beginning of array
  leax d,x      # point to a[x][0]
  pshs x        # push parameter for gets
  lbsr gets     # call gets function
  leas 2,s * } _5
  ldd 1000,s    # x=x+1
  addd #1
  std 1000,s _4
  ldd 1000,s    # etc
  cmpd #5
  lble _2 _3
  leas 1002,s
  puls u,pc _1 equ -1072
  endsect
 
 Now, even tho we had to guess at the function of ccmult, it was still clear
 that we were passing the address of an _allocated_ char subarray to the gets
 function... and not just a pointer to hyperspace.  Does this make sense?
 
 The other thing that looking at -ca output does is to impress the fact that C
 is basically an assembly macro language... and that *pointers are just
 variables being used as extra "index registers".  best - kevin

 Ha!  No way would I have come up with allocating a two-dimension array like you
 did, to make all the rest of his example work.  At least, not quickly.
 
 That's my problem.  I can't quite think in C yet (I can read it better than
 write it).  It's still far easier for me to write utils in Basic09, too.
 
 But I admit that I've started converting my window driver to C.  Seems that I
 have no choice for OS-9000... :-)  If/when I ever finish, I might know C.
 
 <sigh> I should've started learning in earnest back when you and Carl did.

 Carl predated me by years, and was my mentor and father confessor when I got
 deep into the quicksand. Best C advice? Assume that the compiler does nothing
 FOR you... your analysis of C as a macro assembler couldn't be more accurate.
 The beauty is that the #defines and functions allow you to move into a level of
 abstraction that is truly close to high level language.
 
 It's NEVER too late. Hell - it took me 3-4 years to break the mental block
 against C (1983-1986).

 Keven,
    That is what I need to start doing, looking at the assembly, and getting
 familiar with how C compiles these little example routines.
    Yes, I'm trying to tackle C again, no hard drive yet but I can set up a
 large ram disk, which makes the compile times lots faster. Its only a problem
 when the computer crashes, then it is a five minute boot up to load the ram
 disk back up again.

 Larry,
 
 If I'm not sure about what something I've written will do, I almost always
 compile it to asm source first... a bad mistake will glare out at me and I can
 avoid the usual crash/reboot C learning cycle :-)
 
 I've been after someone to port one of those small C interpreters.  Maybe even
 make it interactive like Basic.  Something like that would really cut down on
 the C learning time for most people, I think.  Quicker feedback.

 Kevin,
     I'm not real familiar withOSK assembly yet, so the mistakes wouldn't glare
 out at me like 6809 assembly would. Its just going to take time and work to get
 the hang of it.
    While I have you here, I was wondering if there will be an SS.Tone like
 syscall for K-Windows. Digital recording and playing is great but I would think
 that sometimes you would want to have the computer generate some sound.

 Oh. Oh!  I don't know why I assumed you were compiling on the 6809 instead of

 No SS.Tone thingie yet, altho I've done parts of it.  A lot of features are
 being worked on in parallel.  Either because they're inter-related, or simply
 because they're too boring to do all at once <big grin>.

 Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
 To: all
 
 Can someone confirm that I'm doing this correctly? I'm trying to declare a
 pointer to an array of ints. I have a index which I load dynamically, so I find
 I have to do declare my pointer like this:
 
    int (*index)[DIM2];
 
 This lets index act the same as if static storage was allocated with:
 
    int index[DIM1][DIM2];
 
 I can now do something like index=malloc(sizeof(int)*DIM1*DIM2).
 
 This appears to work, but seems to be highly un-intutitive! Is there no way I
 can actually have [DIM1][DIM2] in the declaration, or at least [DIM1]? I just
 get worried that a year from now when I change the index structure I'll screw
 the pointer.
 
 Also, I'm not too impressed by the way I have to calculate the size of the
 array in the malloc(). But I don't see anyway around this.

 Bob -
 
 If you're looking to allocate a dynamically sized array, then you pretty much
 MUST use malloc() (or a variation).
 
 Example:
 
    Allocate an array of pointers to type int. The array will be 'num_required'
    long:
 
   num_required = 49;    /* or whatever */
 
   .....
 
   int *array_ptr;       /* pointer to a type of int */
   array_ptr = malloc(num_required * (sizeof (int *)));
 
 
 You now have an array of pointers to int that may be accessed either in the
 form array_ptr[0...num_required-1]  or array_ptr+0...num_required-1.

 Bob,
      Yes, the way you've done the declaration is precisely the way it should be
 done.  The declaration becomes clearer when one thinks of a 2D array as 1D
 arrays nested inside a 1D array.  "int (*index)[DIM2]" declares index to be a
 pointer to an array of integer arrays of size DIM2 in the same way that "int
 *index" would declare index to be a pointer to an array of integers. In either
 declaration the number of objects pointed to is irrelevant to the declaration,
 only the size of the individual objects pointed to matters (the size of an
 array of DIM2 integers in the first case or the size of a single integer in the
 second case).  In a program one may want to assign the pointer to arrays of
 various lengths and indeed one can:
 
  int (*index)[20],yes[5][20],no[10][20];
  .
  .
  .
  if(getchar()=='y')
       index=yes;
  else
       index=no;
 
 index[2][3] would evaluate to the appropriate element in either array. (Of
 course index[6][1] would be out of bounds if index were pointing to the yes
 array) You needn't worry about changing what you #define DIM1 and DIM2 to be.
 As long as you've used the macros consistently in your program changing their
 values should not cause any problems.

 Bob,
      Another thought: the data structure of your 2D array could be made more
 explicit in your source if you use calloc() rather than malloc to set aside
 memory for the array:
 
 index = calloc( DIM1 , sizeof( int[DIM2] ))
 
 This is functionally equivalent to what you have done with malloc, but here
 calloc() explicitly sets aside memory for DIM1 arrays of DIM2 integers.

 Haven't got the book/ISBN nearby, but the cost is about $25. Definitely worth
 it.
 
 Another book which I have come to rely on heavily is the series by
 Osborne/McGraw Hill ... in my case it's "C++ The Complete Reference". I believe
 there's a C only version as well. Has both tutorial sections and reference
 sections. Explanations are _good_, and there are usually examples. Just the
 sort of thing for when you're sitting there saying "Now how does X work?" It's
 about $35, and also worth every penny.

 Speaking of books... I have 'C, The complete Reference' by Schilt. Yes, it is
 very good. Based on that I also ordered Schilt's 'Advanced C, 2nd ed.'. Sort of
 a waste of $$ since most of it was already in 'Complete'.

 Bob,
      You're very welcome.  If you're refering to Gehani, I take it you found
 the tutorial.  Your question inspired me to put a few thoughts together.
      I picked up Gehani at Walden Books,or perhaps B. Daltons, several years
 ago.  It cost around $20.  I'm by no means an authority on C texts.  There are
 many out there and I'm sure others might serve as well.  All I have to compare
 Gehani to is Purdum, which I bought back in 84 when I first got C for the COCO.
 I can't recomend Purdum at all, I think his presentation is very unorganized
 and sloppy.  I also have THE C PROGRAMMERS HANDBOOK by Thom Hogan which is very
 useful as a quick reference on questions such as "what the heck is the bitwise
 exclusive or operator?"  It is not and does not purport to be a primer on how
 to program in C however.

 Keith - of course SCROLL LOCK turns on/off its light (unless CTRL is down), so
 to use it for flipping screens a person would want to cover up the light :)
 
 I keep thinking that one key should wake up a background "master" process which
 could have a menu for forking new shell windows, etc.  Gotta play with the idea
 some tho.

 The 68070 is a 68000 clone, Graham, and is completely compatible with 68000

 I used the G++ compiler (downloaded from the InterNet).  MicroEMacs 3.10
 (haven't) snarfed 3.11 yet).  There is at present no symbolic debugger
 available for use with G++ under OS-9.  I used Microware's srcdbg, mostly in
 assembly level, and lots of printf's err <'s to cout.
 
 I prepared the documentation using LaTeX - OSK TeX (Common TeX).  Microware's
 make using the -b option and explicit rules to handle g++.
 
 Hardware is a Force CPU-30 (20mhz 68030/68882, 6U VME system).

 What version of the GCC compiler did you use?  Version 1.4 is in the Compuserve

 gpp -v tells me I'm using g++ 1.39.1 (based on gcc 1.40).
 
 I have not tried to create 68020 code (wanting to produce programs that will
 run on lowwer end machines (i.e. plain 68000's)).  My system is a 68030/68882
 system.  I *think* gcc will produce '020 code if told to, but defaults to
 68000. I don't know about g++.  My understanding of the differences in the
 user-mode instruction sets between the 68000 and 68020 is that except for some
 extended addressing modes and a full 32x32 bit multiple and divide, there is
 not much difference between a 68020 and a 68000.  The '030 only adds in an
 on-chip MMU, which only effects super-mode code (i.e. kernel and SSM stuff). 
 *I* have not noticed much performance difference between programs compiled in
 '020 mode vs. '000 mode (I have not done formal benchmarks, just gut feeling -
 no noticable delays with '000 code).
 
 Robert PS:  I downloaded gcc and g++ from hermit.cs.wisc.edu (something like
 that). RPH

 Lee- I downloaded the SMART.AR file that you uploaded. Upon reading the docs I
 noticed that the drivers are designed for the MPI, which I am not using. I want
 to put the Smartwatch in my J&M controller as it has both 24 and 28 pin
 sockets. Do you know if it will work? I only use RSDOS in the 24 pin socket but
 am hoping that the clock can be read from the 28 pin socket even though it
 isn't selected.

 Randy,
  First, the OS9 SmartWatch drivers will only be able to read from the switch
 selected ROM socket. As I recall, the ROM switch essentially just switched
 power from one ROM socket to the other. Therefoae, only one ROM socket can be
 active at a time. The 24-pin RSDOS ROM can run from the 28-pin socket, and I
 think you plug the RSDOS ROM in so that the first four pins are left empty.
 Basically, it would look like this from the pin 1 side...
 
  Notched     )----------------------
          pin#1-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|  <---- RS-DOS ROM
     ends )--------------------------
          1-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|  <---- SmartWatch (c)
      --> )--------------------------
          |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
     pin# 1 x                          <---- first four pins
                                                (two on each side)
 
  Also, I'd bet that as long as you don't have any other devices addressed (by
 using a Y-cable or some sort of mini-bus in the J&M controller, for instance)
 at the location where MPI's slot select byte is located, then the slot select
 coding in the SW routines shouldn't bother anything.
  On the other hand, if it does cause anomalous problems, then all you should
 have to do is NOP the slot select coding in the routines. In SWCLOCK2, for
 instance, the code starts at $01EB and looks like this:
 
  Addr   0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0 2 4 6 8 A C E
  ----  ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----  ----------------
  0100  E034 30AE ....
  ....                             ** **** ****
  01E0  3401 1A50 B6FF 7FD6 9034 0686 11B7 FF7F  4..P6..V.4...7..
  01F0  C4FC F7FF 9096 9185 0126 0CF6 FFA7 3406  D|w....F.&.v.'4.
 
  If worse comes to worse, you could change the 8611B7FF7F to 1212121212, but
 according to the guy that I talked to, you shouldn't have to resort to this.
 The coding for selecting the MPI slot is exactly the same in all the various SW
 routines (SWCLOCKn, GETCLKn, SWSETn), it's just in different places.

   Thanks for the information. It really helps me to understand how things work.
 You are correct that the 24 pin ROM need to have the top four pins of the 28
 pin socket left open. I have a 28 pin ROM that was modified to work in a 24 pin
 socket and it has the top 4 pins bent up and tied together.

 Fm: Ian Hodgson 72177,1762
 To: All
 
 OK, I just came across a strange problem. After lazily putting it off for
 years, I finally patched Shell+ 2.1 to turn on wildcards. Worked fine, except
 when I went to use a memory script that I have been using for many months. The
 script reads like this:
 
  chd /r0
  prompt Directory?
  var.2
  prompt File (no extension)?
  var.0
  tmode .1 -echo
  prompt Keyword?
  var.1
  display d a
  tmode .1 echo
  crypt %2/%0.cr %1
  rename crypt.out %0
 
 It works fine with wildcards OFF, but with wildcards ON the first and third
 prompts do not display (the second one does). Otherwise it seems to work fine.
 I turned wildcards back OFF again and, once more, the script works fine. What?
 This does not make much sense.
 
 In case it matters, I don't use the provided modpatch script to make change,
 but simply toggle the value of 04DC in Shell between 26 and 27 hex. Any
 suggestions?

 I was just coming back on to mention that. What the devil is wrong with using
 the question marks at that point? Why does the effect differ? On the second
 prompt, I get File (no extension)m t which seems odd. I realize that the ?'s
 are single character wildcards, but can't see why they have the effect that
 they do.

 It is the question marks. I remember this problem from many years ago, and I
 think I finally gave up and removed the question marks from things like this.
 Its been so long I can't remember if 2.1 with that patch allowed for
 temporarily disabling the wild cards (something like a special character at the
 beginning of the line). I do remember that the results were sometimes not what
 was expected, like the example you gave.

 Well, I can't speak for SHELL+, but the unix shell would see that as a command
 to run the prompt command with an argument of any filename that matches the

 Try enclosing the question + text in quotes (single/double) and see what

 I FINALLY had the opportunity to watch a video of the Atlanta CoCoFest last
 April.
 
 I thoroughly enjoyed the meeting that Frank, Ed and Paul had.
 
 The person who taped the meeting of 'the big three' also taped the meeting that
 Kevin Darling had.
 
 Kevin said one thing there in the meeting room, and that is the purpose of this
 message.
 
 He was talking in reference to new magazines that come onto the marketplace
 from time to time.  He said (and I quote) "If you wait 3-6(-12) months to
 subscribe to the new magazines, then YOU'VE KILLED THE MAGAZINE".
 
 Well, we've got a new kid on the block - the OS9 Underground, that is just
 starting to get off wobbly feet, and really produce some quality stuff.
 
 Are we gonna let it die by not subscribing??
 
 It's up to each of us not to let this happen to this magazine.  It's only $18 a
 year, so it's no back breaker on the price end.
 
 Call 818:894-0012 to order your free copy of the magazine.  If you like it,
 then place your order.

 Jim,
 
 I did get a free copy already, and was impressed. You're right, we all need to
 subscribe, and NOW! I'll be sending my order out first thing next week. Thanks

 I have patched the keydrv to make the arrow keys work on my prelim ver of tc70
 kwindows. I have also succesfully added fonts via the mm1 35 fonts file from
 delphi. Even the gifshow file viewer works but.... colors are all wrong.  The
 colors for
  the color command supplied are wrong.. looks like green and red are
 interchanged.
 
 also f9 and f10 circle thru the windows but in the same direction.  Would be
 nice
  if the went forward, other backward.
 
 Had a little trouble getting kwindows to work with dynastar but the answer came
 from
  KSCALES: check tmode and see that pag=26.  I then realized my screens have 26
 lines! Who nice.
 
 How would the gifshow file and the color command colors be fixed?
 
 looking forward to the new enhanced kwindows for tc70!

 Sb: #printf problem
 Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
 To: all
 
 Has anyone else noticed a problem with the printf() family? The following code
 fragement works fine by itself, but in a large program it doesn't:
 
    switch (fmt){
      .....
      case 'H': sprintf(buff,"%X",value);
                break;
      case 'h': sprintf(buff,"%x",value);
                break;
 
      ....
 
 The entire format loop works fine--expect when the %X format is used. In this
 case a single 'x' is printed. However, %x, does work alright. I've put a bunch
 of debug code (printf()s) in the real program and the printf() react the same
 way. For some reason, uppercase hex doesn't work. However, when I just extract
 the code out and stick it in a test program, all works alright. I've really
 pulled my hair on this one--even checked the crc while the program is running.
 No luck. I've cobbled a work-around for now by using %x and then converting the
 string to uppercase if fmt=='H'.
 
 Either there is a bug in sprintf(), or my program is cobblering something. Any
 ideas?

 Bob,
 
 Why not try reversing the two sprintf lines...i.e., do the lower case 'h' first
 and then the uppercase.  If there is a pointer clobbering something, it should
 make the 'x' statement not work then.  This is what I expect is the problem (a
 wild pointer).

 To: Mark Griffith 76070,41 (X)
 
 Thanks Mark. I already tried the obvious stuff like moving code around. No
 help. I even used debug to monitor things and discovered that the call to
 sprint() is being set up properly. Even checked to verify that the register
 pointing to the format specifier (D1) actually pointed to the correct data. It
 did. I think that a wild pointer might be the problem, but can't figure out
 things. If the pointer is corrupting the program (including sprintf()) then the
 crc of the program should change. It doesn't. So, I suppose it could be mucking
 up a static buffer used by sprintf() but that is pretty hard to track down...
 Be nice to have source for the MW library. Oh well, I'll probably find another
 nasty bug and trace this to it!
 
 For others reading--any suggestions are appreciated!

 Could someone refresh my tired gray cells? How de? one change the input &
 output buffer sizes for the serial ports on the mm/1? I thought I'd do it
 quickly (of course this was at 3am) via xmode. But I don't believe the size is
 contained in the descriptor. Annoying thing is that there have been some
 messages fly by in the past--and I choose to ignore them...

 You have to use the moded utility (I keep forgetting its there!) and make sure
 that you have the right moded.fields file in /DD/SYS. This only works on files,
 though. Somebody needs to hack on xmode to do this real time....hint...hint :-)

 To: bob santy
 
 I downloaded a os9 file to my pc because I have only one modem I thought i
 could transfer it to coco with your transfer program called pcdos. I forgot it
 was in binary instead of ascii, and it also was an "arc" file. It won't unarc
 on an os9 disk. Could I hook a null modem cable between the bit banger of the
 coco and the com2 port of my pc and transfer the file? I have a os9 terminal
 program and also one for the pc? What pins on the two computers would I use?
         I am fairly adept at making things for the coco with a soldering iron!
 Would this work? I believe the file as it sits in my pc harddrive is an exact
 copy of the one here that I downloaded I evidently am loosing data with the
 "pcdos" program because it's binary instead of ascii text. Thanks, Denise

 Denise,
 
 For binary files, make sure to use the -raw option of pcdos, otherwise pcdos
 assumes its an ascii file.
 
 Check out the file SERIAL.TXT for some good explanations and examples of
 hooking up different computers and equipment to the various serial ports of the
 CoCo. I can't remember which library its in, but try this command in any of the
 libraries:

 These questions, as posed in the Delphi poll, on AR's enhancements received

 WHAT SHOULD THE DEFAULT COMPRESSION BE? Carl Kreider is thinking of updating
 AR.  He would like to know what the users want for the default compression
 though.  Do you want the default to remain at 11 bits so that it remaini
 compatible with OS-9 Level I, or do you feel the default compression should be
 12 bit so that binary files can be compressed. I believe he is planning on
 adding the 12 bit code, but wants to know what you want the default compression
 toggle to do.  Also, if you leave a comment, please mention whether you would
 like the attributes saved with the file, and any other features you would like
 added, changed, or removed.  The results will be given to Carl on CIS.
 
 10-Jul-92 05:00pm Subject: Re: AR Developments...
 
 My comments to Mr. Krieder:
 
 I like the unsanctioned version of AR1.5b.  It's flawless (so far). I like the
 default to 12 bits, but I wouldn't be bothered by the 11 bit default if that
 were the way it would go.
 
 Automatically sensing if a compression was good or not (i.e. compress all
 files, check to see if the result was larger, if so: rewrite) is 100% necessary
 in my opinion.  I have compressed MANY MANY binaries using AR1.5b with very few
 not compressing.  And even so, the ones that didn't compress well wene "stored"
 without a noticably lengthy loss in time.  Time during compression does not
 matter half as much as time during extraction anyway!
 
 ATTRIBUTES ARE 100% necessary!!!!  Don't even think about not puating it
 in...(please...)
