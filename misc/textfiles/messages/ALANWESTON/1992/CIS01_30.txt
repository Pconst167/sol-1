Hopefully someone will have time to have a look at TOPs ncurses and figure out
the problem. I think it is more with the os9lib than with ncurses... but who
knows!

On the other hand, with the size of those routines it might be better and safer

Thanks for the information. My plans were to contact you in Australia by some
means, and now it is a bit easier now that I have a CIS number I can contact.
As I mentioned before, this group was formed among OS-9 users in Fidonet. I
have heard of some users of this forum that aren't all that fond of Fidonet,
but Fidonet does have alot going for it in that it is the largest amateur
network in the world, and the cheapest network for us OS-9 users to access. I
do know there are many Fidonet systems in Australia, so you might look around
and see if you can find someone to carry the COCO, OS9, RIBBS, and COCO_CLUB
echos that are available on the Zone 1 Backbone (if you don't know what that
means, ask your local Fidonet sysop). What this means to you is that it is an
inexpensive means to keep in touch with OS-9 users on the other side of the
globe. There is also Fidonet software available for COCO OS-9 Level 2 users. If
you have further questions, or need any help with the above, leave me a message
here.

Fm: John Semler 70324,633
To: Kevin Darling 76703,4227 (X)

Kevin,

    I got my "fast mode" emulator running!  Here is some CPU timing results
when running the floating point intensive program "ALMANAC":

 Machine    Time (seconds)    Comments

 CoCo3         55 secs
 CoCo2        110 secs       CoCo3 times * 2 (estimated)
 MacIIcx      132 secs       Running the "Fast mode" emulator

Programs are preloaded when performing the timing studies (just to be fair to
the CoCo3!).  The "fast" mode of emulation requires that the program does not
generate and execute new code.  As you can see, I almost break even with the
CoCo2. If it were not for the half carry flag calculations, the emulator would
probably match or beat the CoCo2.

This "fast mode" emulator is a little bit different from what I have previously
envisioned .  Each IOC quad word is composed of a jump vector (4 bytes) for
executing 6809 primitives and a variation word (4 bytes). Total IOC memory
requirement is 65536*8 bytes (In addition to 65536 bytes of "real" memory).
Instructions are incrementally compiled into IOC when first encountered.  Under
the "slow mode" IOC that becomes dirty will also be recompiled if executed.

Size of the emulator:

    Total 68020 instructions:      150,980 bytes
    Total data space requirement:  593,324 bytes

This emulator developement work was made much easier by the fact that I
developed a user state OS9/6809 debugger that operates like the OS9/68K
version.  I set up this debugger on both systems so that I can verify the
proper executions of millions of instructions!  The last bug I smashed didn't
occur until about 1.5 million instructions into the program "ALMANAC"!  This
debugger will have nearly everything that the OS9/68K version has including
symbolic debugging.

Am I happy to see it running?  Yes!  This program has been simmering over the
stove on low heat for a little over a year - definitely long term project.

Almost all of the 6809 opcodes have been implemented.  The exceptions are
"sync", "daa", "abx", "rti", "cwai", "swi", "swi2" (the real kind), and "swi3".
Have not encountered them yet and I'm lazy.

Almost none of the OS9 system calls have been implemented.  Just enough to get
"ALMANAC" running for the timing studies.  Had to fake out the "I$GetStt" call,
the one which returned a 32 byte path option packet.  Otherwise, it seems
relatively easy to map OS9/6809 I/O calls with OS9/680X0 calls.

Currently the emulator is running under OS9/68K.  I plan to port the assembly
code over to Aztec C which, I believe, has a decent macro assembler that can
build huge code.  I believe a decent CoCo2 simulator that runs OS9 Level One is
possible and may attempt the CoCo3 simulator if the effort proves to be
successful.

Unfortunately, this emulator is sprinkled profusely with 68020 machine language
idioms.  The most common 68020 idioms that I use are "bfextu" (bit field
extract unsigned) and "bfins" (bit field insert).  I use them to repair the
emulated 6809 condition code bits when the 680X0 instructions doesn't simulate
them correctly.  But I am interested in making this emulator run under 68000
systems.

I was wrong about the half carry flag calculations taking up a significant
fraction of the time.  It looks like the emulator will never do significantly
better than a CoCo2 when running under the MacIIcx.  Also discovered that
MAC-OS9 disables the instruction and data caches on bootup.  I re-enabled the
caches under the Mac environment and noted that the run times were reduced by
7.5% (execution times within a stone throw of the CoCo2!).

Maybe in 6 months I will have something to upload.  I am a graduate student and
Spring semester has arrived.  Darn!

Looks like you can continue for a long time without "sync", "cwai", "swi" and
"swi3".  Although support of OS9 DEBUG would require "swi".

"daa" and "abx" are definite MUSTS!  Incidentally, "daa" is the only
instruction that requires the half-carry to be correct.

"swi2" emulatihn for most OS9 programs can be limited to the subset of: F$Link,
F$Load, F$UnLink, F$Fork, F$Chain, F$Wait, F$Exit, F$Mem, F$Send, F$Icpt,
F$Sleep, F$ID, F$SPrior, F$Perr, F$PrsNam, F$CmpNam, F$Time, F$CRC, F$SFser,
F$UnLoad, F$NmLink, I$Dup, I$Create, I$Open, I$MakDir, I$ChgDir, I$Delete,
I$Seek, I$Read, I$ReadLn, I$Write, I$WritLn, I$GetStt, I$SetStt, I$Close and
I$DeletX.

The GetStt subset can be limited to SS.Opt, SS.Ready, SS.Size, SS.Pos, SS.EOF,
SS.DevNm, SS.FD, SS.ScSiz and SS.ScTyp.

The SetStt subset can be limited to SS.Opt, SS.Size, SS.FD, SS.SSig and
SS.Relea.

  >Unfortunately, this emulator is sprinkled profusely with 68020
  >machine language idioms. [bitfields]

If you intend to eventually port to the 68000, wouldn't "bset", "bclr" and
"btst" do?

I suspect that just as (or more) common is the access of words at odd addresses
which the 68020 will do at the expense of extra bus cycles but the 68000 will
NOT do.  Am I correct?

Again, looks like you've gotten off to a great start!!

Bob,

Thanks for the information on the OS9 specifics!  I will file it away for later
use.

You're right about word addressing - my emulator uses them when accessing
virtual 6809 memory.  I can fix this word addressing problem by reading (or
writing) consecutive bytes of data.  Doing this also helps to solve logical
problems with accessing words in a level two simulator where MMU memory blocks
may not be consecutive.

As for the "bfextu" and "bfins" I was planning simulate them with the help of
"Bcc" (Branch on condition codes).  Will keep the instructions you mentioned in
mind.

Reason I went 68020 was to max out my Mac and I haven't really given any
serious consideration to a 68000 version until Kevin inquired about it.  I'll
wait for the software to settle down before converting it over to 68000 code -
it is using some very complex addressing modes (scaled index for example).

I can just imagine this emulator running tens of times slower after fixing it
up for the 68000 systems! <grin>

Well, you could just leave it to the 68020 and forget about a 68000 mode. As
for Level II, may I suggest that you also forget about that too.  Your target
audience will most certainly be those with applications to run only.  An OS9
application will be concerned with the system calls I have listed and those
don't really fall into Level II function.  System mode calls will not be in the
list unless you actually emulate the operating system as a whole.  I suspect
that you'd grind down to a snail's pace even on the 68020 if you tried that.

Actually (I believe) a word access would incur, on average, 1.25 long word
accesses.  Memory on the MacIIcx is organized into 32 bit long words.  Here's
the formula:

    (0.75)*(1 memory access) + (0.25)*(2 memory access) = 1.25
       ^                          ^
       |                          |
       |                          +-- frequency of occurrence that
       |                              words DO cross 32 bit boundaries
       |
       +-- frequency of occurrence that words DO NOT cross 32 bit
           boundaries

I plan to make use of this fact when aligning the beginning of my instruction
sequences that simulates 6809 machine instructions.

I thought perhaps current and future MM1 owners might be interested in
the results of the testing I've done during the course of the development
of the disk drivers for the MM1.

The following chart shows transfer speed in bytes per second for the
drives I have tested on the MM1 with the dma driver.  (The programmed I/O
driver wouldn't get above 25,000 on *any* drive).  The test method is to
read some quantity of sectors repeatedly (not the same sectors, though)
until enough time has elapsed to give reasonable granularity.  My rule of
thumb is that the test should last at least 100 time intervals (ticks or
seconds).  By varying the quantity read, you can get some idea about the
overhead of the operating system and how the performance will vary with
application (copy moves big blocks at a time, while payroll may not).
The most obvious conclusion you can make is that speed is related to
cost.  If you know the mechanics of the drives, it is also related to
cache size on the drive and raw data rate used internally on the drive.
It is also related to the speed of the micro on the drive (the ST296
doesn't seem to keep up at 1:1) and of course interleave.

Yeah, that's pretty strange!  I've been trying for days to think of a good

Especially if dcheck didn't complain at all.  Weird.  Hmm... unless perhaps LSN
0... no, you said it showed free of 1440 sectors.

Got me!  Let us know if it happens again.  Northern lights, maybe?  UFOs? Crop

Kev,

     Now I'm sorry that I reformatted the disk. Had I been more awake at the
time (it _was_ 2AM) I might have dug around a bit with dEd and tried to find
the problem. I'm wondering if, somehow, I ended up with an invisible file. I've
seen that before, with backspaces at the end of the filename in the directory
entry I think. But no, that wouldn't work with an ls -e command. My first
thought was that the sector allocation map was corrupted, but dcheck should
complain long and loud about that. Then I wondered about the free space
reporting of ls (oh, that's lsh which I renamed), but dir and free all showed
the same thing. BTW, free didn't show 1440 free sectors, just 1440 total on the
disk (which is a 3.5" 720K). Oh well, I could speculate endlessly but the info
is long gone so I can't play detective.

     And it's not likely to be Northern lights at this time of year. Crop
circles? Naw, too much (*!"#$$!*) snow. Cold weather, perhaps; the last two
weeks have been down to about -20 at night with a balmy zero in the afternoons.

DCHECK not correctly working on a root directory that is more than 1 segment
long...

Does that just apply when using floppies?  DCHECK seems to work on my hard
drives, but then I did say it "seems" to work...

Yes, there are countries which do.  Australia used to require licenses to use,
own, or maintain radio or TV receiving equipment until the '60's. England still
does.  And there are other countries.  Full details appear(ed) in the WORLD
RADIO TV HANDBOOK at the top of each country's listing.  I haven't bought a
WRTH in several years so I couldn't say whether they still do.  In England, the
license fees are used to support the BBC.  My mother told me about when she and
my father were stationed in then-West Germany and a truck would go around
"sniffing out" radio receivers in use (yes, it is possible) and the authorities
would go ask to see peoples' licenses.  Fortunately we don't have to get a
license to just listen to the radio.  As for call signs, listeners get them as
a way to show serious interest in radio communications even if that interest
doesn't include the ability to talk in a conversation as in amateur radio.  But
some people like to berate such call signs as being a way to spend a couple of
bucks and a stamp you couldn't find any other use for. Erich Schulman (KTN4CA)

If your PC is a PC/XT/286, upgrading to 386 is not quite as simple as upgrading
a 386 to a 486.  You will need a board designed to upgrade a 286 if you have a
286, and a PC/XT is not worth the attempt.  PC SOURCES did an article on
upgrading to a 386sx recently (Jan 92 issue I think it is), and I'd suggest you
give it a look if you haven't already.  If you're still interested in the
upgrade, one you might want to consider getting is the board sold by JDR
Microdevices.  Check a COMPUTER SHOPPER if you don't have their catalog.

I replaced all 16 DRAMs in my CoCo3 and powered up.  Everything seemed to be
OK.  The memory tester that came with my first 512K locked up.  The memory
tester listed in the service manual reported ERROR!  ADDR=65535.  I powered
down and checked the chips, then reseated a loose one.  I powered up again. 
Nothing.  Not even a green screen.  With all it'll cost to as much as restore
what I had (replacing the CoCo3, the 512K (3rd time), and the Slot Pak III) I
decided that it's not cost effective to do so.  I found a CoCo2 which I will
run alongside a 386 I will eventually get. What does this mean?  Expect some
Level 1 questions getting posted before long.  I won't be going into the CoCo
and OS-9 Forums as often.  And unless I can coax the CoCo2 into running the
hard drive, I will not be able to reupload the file that I uploaded but saw
deleted because of its archive format.  If anyone's interested in a dead CoCo3
for parts (I'm 99.8% sure the GIME, ROM, and 6809 are OK) and in CoCo3-only
software just let me know what you want (allow time to convert files etc.).  My
now 16K CoCo1 has proven perfectly reliable, my CoCo3 just the opposite. It's a
disappointment it came to this but at least I'll still have one foot in the
CoCo world even if it's without Super ECB and Level 2.

I'll be doing that later.  I have megabytes to convert to PC and to downsize
for the CoCo2, and all this without the help of a CoCo3.  In fact, all I've got
to work with *right now* are a CoCo1 with 16K and not Extended BASIC and a
Macintosh, with the latter not being mine.  I don't have the CoCo2 yet but
should in another day or two.  My last "census" indicated I had 23Mb on a total
of about 700 floppies.  Even with the CoCo2 it'll be slow going.  There won't
be much in hardware I can offer but I do have a good quantity of software I
will be able to unload.  I've downloaded megabytes so I may throw in some of
that too, saving a lot of connect time.  Like my 400K of Home Publisher fonts
and clipart.  None of this should be construed as a committment, however.

The first time I upgraded to 512K, the upgrade took *days* to complete, not the
five minutes the ad said it would be.  The second time I upgraded the same
CoCo3 (retrograded?) to 512K, it took hours.  Believe me, I have experienced
every possible and every conceivable problem in installing the 512K plus 2 or 3
more.  A suggestion from Dave Myers of CoCoPRO! helped some, viz. putting
electrical tape on the RF box to preclude the board from grounding out.  So
I've been through it all, checked it all, been through it all again, and so on
ad infinitum/nauseum.  Chris Hawks of Hawksoft diagnosed one of my problem
areas as being the CoCo3's power supply being insufficient for the job and
causing my problems which does seem entirely possible.  So with $90 for a 128K
CoCo3 plus $90 for a replacement Slot Pak 3 plus $70 for a new 512K board plus
$20 for the replacement chips already wasted plus a new power supply plus
shipping/handling charges all topped with hours of work and I end up with
nothing I didn't have before except more watts from the power supply

It's not worth it to me anymore.  BTW, when I had 512K probs before, I at least
got a green screen without sign-on msg.  Now, nothing at all.

I know I will still have the CoCo around when I need it.  There will be no dust
to wipe off at each power up either.  It'll just be on a smaller scale.  After
all, there's no way a CoCo2 could hope to do what I've done on my 3 when it was
alive.  To ease my transition into being in both worlds I've written (but not
debugged) some DOS macros and batch files so DOS will accept some commands I'm
used to.  Like DOSKEY LIST=TYPE $1 and DOSKEY COBBLER=FORMAT $1 $2 /S (I had to
allow a second parameter for 4 or /f:720.).  Most of them are so simple so as
to not need any further work but some will have to be tested.  I had to stretch
a little to come up with equivalents to MDir and Procs.  I'll upload everything
here when I'm happy with the results.  As for the CoCo2, I've now learned how
to use the Level 1 Debug to fix up /d0 and /d1 to match my drives' capacities.
I'm too used to EZGen which I can't use anymore.  And if we were all together I
probably would not have thrown in the towel like this.

Erich,

     I have followed your messages about the poor CoCo 3 for the past few weeks
and I wonder if you are not giving up too easily. When I saw that you were
planning to try to persuade MSDOS to look a bit like OS9 I figured I had to say
something before it was too late!

     I make a good part of my living troubleshooting data communications
equipment (on the phone, not the bench, mostly) and I must say that the easiest
problems to fix are the "It used to work OK" type, rather than the "It never
worked" ones. I don't recall all the things you mentioned but if it were my
CoCo 3 I would check first the power supply voltages (which will probably be
OK), then look at the chips. This can be done systematically if you have the
service manual and an oscilloscope. Indeed, the service manual has an entire
section on step by step troubleshooting which should let you identify the bad
chip (by far the most likely problem) in short order. If you don't have the
service manual you may still be able to get one from Tandy (part no. 26-3334).
If there was no inconvenient border in between us (I presume you are in the
U.S.) I would say to send me the thing and I would take a look at it.

     But for heaven's sake don't give up on it. At the worst you should be able
to get another one; they show up here from time to time and there must be
thousands of them gathering dust in various places. And no matter how much you
want to pretend, you will never make MSDOS work like OS9.

I do have a service manual for the CoCo3 and I do have an analog vom (20000
ohms per volt).  I do have an oscilloscope too but it's an all-tube scope (EICO
460) from 1961 and I never managed to get it back to original specs.  About 85%
there.  I think I need to replace one of the tubes and I can't find most of its
tubes.  On my CoCo3, it seems fixing one problem ends up making that problem
worse and then a new one comes my way.  And it seems unlikely to me that
getting another CoCo3 would not just give me more of the same.  At least with a
pc I won't have to search far and wide and endure weeks of down time when a
part goes bad.  Installing the 512K was torturous the first time and every
subsequent time.  Do I want to go through that time and again all over?  It
took several toll calls to a technician before I could get my hard drive
working and then it was slow.  The scsi47 drivers only wiped out the whole disk
and left it incorrectly formatted. If I stay with my CoCo3 I now know I will
never realize half the hard drive performance I paid dearly for.  And then the
Slot Pak III.  Marty Goodman informed me that thing has a tendency to self
destruct.  Do I want to drop $180 a year on Slot Pak III's?  And of course DOS
will never be exactly like OS-9, but who said it was even intended to be.  My
CoCo1 has proved very dependable.  But I dropped hundreds of dollars and tens
of hours of work on the CoCo3 and then it dies after I had it a mere 51 weeks.

Dear Lee: I had called Tandy, along time ago, and requested the driver for the

spoke to someone named DAVID. (Rainbow 1/89 pg 6 1-800-338-2395) Also Tandy
Software Assembly. A Tandy dealer could the
 package #90-0911 if they are willing to work at it. You would get a backup
disk . Did you try Express Order? 800-321-3133? I got the Deveopers Package
that way, original docs, backup disks for $17.00 that way. Let me know, I might
be able to get the manager who helped me

I need to make sure that we're (you and I) are on the same wavelength.  I'm

Br. Jeremy.  I have just submitted a new release of UNLZH that handles the old
format (-lh1-).  This release fixes a bug for invalid file names in the archive
and processes the ! file found in self-extracting files. You CANNOT <p>rint a
-lh1- file; you will need to extract and use some other utility to view.

Hopefully the sysop will check out soon.

This is great to hear. I'm sure the OS-9 users of Fidonet Zone 1 (North Amewill
be excited to hear this ! As for getting the info to you, I can either send it
to you by postal mail (which would take a little longer), or by Fido mail if
your sysop would allow (this would be quicker, but would cost a bit more).
Netmail messages can be routed at almost no cost, but files I have to send
direct. But since it is automatic, the cost is as minimal as it can get. Either
way, I'll be in touch with you soon. Hopefully your sysop can make the
arrangements to get the OS9 (and COCO, RIBBS, and COCO_CLUB) echos real soon,
where you can keep up with the rest of us. I almost forgot, another alternative
is to download OS9NET.ARC here, which contains all you need to know to get
started, and perhaps advise us on how to grow to better serve those in other
Fidonet zones.

Yes, I believe I mean 'Screens'.  We are using terminals (mostly non-graphics).
So, I've ordered it and I let you know how I like it. While I have you... I am
looking for a C Library for an older version of Sculptor.  Apparently, when I
wasn't looking, the organization which owned Sculptor rights in the US
underwent some sort of change.  I'm not sure where to go, now, to find what I
need.  I believe the last version we upgraded to was 1.6:8, but I'll have to
check that.  We are upgrading some of our in house CAD stuff and it would help
to find a compatable library rather than to have to write it all.

I appreciate any guidance that might be out there in this regard.

I'm also in the market for a used 68020 board such as Hazelwoods board or would
also consider Frank's uniquad.  Has anyone outgrown such and want to let one
go?

To: all

The company I work for is in the midst of designing some new 6809 hardware. The
new board will have a 3 Mhz 6809 (6309? The one by Hitachi), a megabyte of
(paged) RAM, a DMA chip, a floppy disk controller chip of some type (probably
an Intel family part) and a 1.44 MB 3.5 inch floppy disk drive. We are going to
use the MESS-DOS disk format so our customers (who probably already have a PC)
can configure our unit off-line, duplicate disks, etc. I get to write the
floppy disk code which leads me to my questions:

Would a driver written in C be fast enough?  Is anyone aware of any C source
(licensable or PD) for dealing with the MS-DOS disk format?

If assembler is the way to go, are there any example '09 (or C) floppy drivers
available here or elsewhere that someone could point me towards?

Any sources of information, references, hints, etc., would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Well, OK, perhaps a bit more than $100 for the card I was talking about. 
Another card in the same unit with about the same features but no floppy
controller, 2 meg RAM instead of 1 and 2 serial ports with DMA is estimated to
cost approximatly $90.00 for parts in quantities of a thousand.

No need for ccr, as the carry bit error flag will be picked up by Basic

Yes, you have to use ON ERROR statements, which sometimes I like, sometimes I

I believe one Syscall's version used to be in Lib 12 here... it could be

Dear Friends: I am working on the fonts which will hopefully become part of

the Developers Pack) won't handle the size files that I am working with. Does
anyone know if DED could be patch to print to disk or to a printer for that
matter while at the same
 time printing to screen? At the moment I am working with a large PD set of
fonts that originally were for First Publisher. I also have a large collection
of VGA screen fonts, and Bit-Mapped Graphics fonts. I am not certain if the
screen fonts could be made to work on the COCO but as soon as I can get the
time to play with them, I will let you know the results. Finally if there is
another disk editor which will give a ded style dump, please let me know.

If what you want to do is take those fonts to your CoCo, printing a Dump will
only leave you in a quagmire of hex numbers.  About the only way you can do
this and keep your sanity is to print the character set from the application
the fonts were intended for and use a CoCo-based font editor to recreate each
character as best you can.  Keep an ASCII table handy!!!! No matter what it
will be long hard work that may not really be worth doing. I tried very hard to
bring the Macintosh's Ashley font to OS-9 a few months ago and gave up in utter
frustration.  I wish I had better news but I thought I'd better tell it like it
is.  I hope someone else comes up with a better answer or at least that I save
you some agony.  (I think I'm a glutton for punishment.  I now want to take
Ashley to the PC without Windows.  Some VGA cards will co-operate.)

Bro, why can't you use the Open file function of DED then use the Append

MAX-10 docs refer to specific addresses. When I used the RS

If you still want to print this dump and assuming dEd is running on a text
screen, a utility to dump a text screen should work fine.  But with the file
being as big as it is, it will take a long time for you to bring up each 256
byte sceen and print it.  I think the best thing for you to do is to find a
program that will create a dump from StdIn.  I saw one on Delphi somewhere but
I don't recall what it is.  Check Applications, the Users Group, and maybe the
Programmer's Den topics.  Or you can create your own with Basic09.  Open the
file in the same way you would a random access file and read it one byte at a
time.  Then convert that byte to its hex equivalent then send it to StdOut. 
Redirect that to a file you can list to the printer in the background.

Bro, I've used DED and the utility called TRIM to break up OS-9 font files. If
the font files that you're using have discernible beginnings and endings, then
it seems like you should be able to break up the sections that you want.

  "In attempting to make sense of the programs on my hard drive, I'm trying to

Yah, there's a lot of demo command thingies floating around out there... some
leftover from Rainbowfests and such.

  "iffs     - related to .iff files?"

I think that's a IFF slide show program.  Give it the name of a file which has
a list of pictures.

 "anim     - used by the mouse demo, but I have no idea of the file format"

Plays the really simple and bloated compression format I used when I converted
Amiga animations to the MM/1 and TC70 long ago.  Not much use otherwise.

  "fshow    - I think it has something to do with .fli files"

I think you're right.  Chd to your flicks dir, and try "fshow ademo >>/nil".
But first make sure the flis and sounds listed in "ademo" exist.  And don't try
to stop the sucker <grin>... it uses all sorts of named pipes etc. Hmm.  You
can stop it... but it takes a lot of "kill" commands to do it :-)

  "pflicker - again, to do with .fli files"

Used by fshow.  Pflicker is the same as flicker (for showing flis), but
understands a limited set of commands ("play","wait","quit") from stdin and
sends "okay" to stderr when it's read in the file and is ready to play. I'm
coming up with a standard set of commands for programs like this.

With named pipes, this allows astonishingly easy setup of demos and even
multimedia (overused word! but true here) applications.  For instance, using a
fairly simple basic program and named pipes to communicate with commands to
playback sounds and minature flis, I've come up with a simple but neat looking
alphabet video kid's book.  It could almost be done from a scriptfile.

I asked the same question on Delphi but got no answers.  According to Rainbow
(about a year ago) the program you need would be either Xenocopy or CoCo Util
II.  But Microcom is--or seems to be--out of business so I wouldn't hold out
much hope for them.  One of my local BBS's has something which might do the job
but it's extremely difficult to get on.  My autodialer always makes over a
hundred attempts to get on (and I give up after 150-175 attempts.)  If you have
only text files, the PC shareware program Read My Disk !might be able to do it
(I haven't tried it.)  Read My Disk! however was intended to recover DOS files
so it might not work well.  If your files are no bigger than 156K you might
want to convert them to Disk BASIC with the utility RSDos which you can
download here.  You'll also need a patch file for CC3Disk which you can also
download here.  Then go to the CoCo Forum and have your PC download AS9TOO.ARC
and you may also need SWAPAB.ZIP. As a last resort you can always use a null
modem connection; this will be very slow.

It might be easier to read/write an MESS-DOS disk on your OS-9 system.

Several months ago, when Radio Shack was closibg out everything for the Coco, I
bought OS9.

Now I've noticed that  what I bought was levrl 1.1 while everything on here is
level 2!

Did I waste my money???

What do I do with 1.1???

Thanks,

Dick

If you are using a CoCo1 or 2, no, because you can't run Level 2.  If you are
using a CoCo3, almost but not quite.  You gain an assembler which will run on
Level 2 which will do quite well in lieu of the Level 2 assembler which will be
very difficult to get.  You also gain a few extra commands (like Save and Dump)
though I'm not sure if the Lev1 versions will run on Lev2 properly.  And the
manuals might prove helpful now and then.  I've found that having full Lev1
documentation helped me determine why some things were not working for me on
Lev2:  it's because they were Lev1 and Lev2 implemented the same things
differently.  I also found a text file which referred to a specific page in one
of the manuals.  I couldn't find anything in my Lev2 books so I checked my Lev1
and found what the file was talking about (and that I really didn't have the
problem the file addressed because it's Lev1 only).  So if you're using a CoCo3
and paid less than ten dollars for Lev1 (I paid five) I'd say keep it.

Thanks for the reply...

I'm almost totally computer programming illeraye, so when I looked at the books
that camewith level 1.1, they meant very little to me.

I simply don't know enuf to understand them..

I'm running a Coco 3, but have a modified 1, and a stock 2 as well.

What happens if I try to run Ultimateterm or somethong like that that is meant
for level 2  ojn my level 1.1 ???

Will it take it???

Ultimaterm isn't an OS-9 program, so it won't run under Level 2 or Level 1 OS-9
either one.  You should give serious thought to grabbing one of the versions of
sterm to use with CIS under OS-9, since it will support CIS B protocol,
definitely the way to go when using CIS.

Hmm...I don't do much in the way of word processing.  When I do, I typically
use a plain vanilla text editor to generate a file I feed to a text formatter,
rather than using a word processor as such.  Perhaps other folks who know more
about it will respond.

As powerful as OS-9 is, it is not a simple operating system and it will take
time and effort to learn it and make it work for you (rather than you for it). 
It won't happen overnight.  If your CoCo1 or 2 has 64K and Extended BASIC you
can use your OS-9 1.1 on that.  Check the message you see on the screen when
you power up.  If you see DISK EXTENDED COLOR BASIC 1.1, put your system master
disk in drive 0 and type DOS[ENTER].  Otherwise put your Boot Disk in drive 0
and type RUN "*"[ENTER] then select Boot OS-9 from the menu.  Again, you cannot
use your version of OS-9 on the CoCo3; you must have Level 2 to run OS-9 on a
CoCo3.  Some things meant for Level 2 will run on your Level 1 1.1, but most
won't.  To make things worse, they will load:  they just won't run.  Ultimaterm
is not a OS-9 program.  When my CoCo3 was working it was my predominant
terminal program and I like it a lot.  It will work only on the CoCo3 but you
run it from ordinary Disk BASIC.  If you get OS-9 Level 2 you might want to get
STerm (which is for OS-9) as an additional terminal program.  I've used that as
well as SuperComm, OSTerm, and XCom9 but Ulterm remained my primary program.

Interesting....

I had no idea that OS9 leve 1.1 wouldn't work on a Coco 3!!!

I got it specifically because I thought it needed a 3!!!

Oh, well, I only paid ten dollars for it...   that won't beeak me (grin).

Yes, there is a lot to learn.  OS9 is supposed to like Xenix, and I also felt I
needed to know something about that system if I'm to remain a professional
electronic communications technician, which I am, or was.

I'm a prematurally retired Western Union Field Service Technician/Technocal
Rep, with some computer technician training, but NO programming training.

They had us responsible for data terminals and computers configured as
terminals, the leased phone lines, intercity multiplexing networks, and the
networks themselves.

We had pour own networks, plus maintenance responsibility for contracted
private systems all over and kinds.

Nevell and Xenix are more recent, and I feel it necessary to keep up...

Thanks again for your answeres.. apreciate it.

OS-9 was based on "classic" Unix.  OS-9 and Unix have developed apart from each
other and there are now many differences between them.  But if you are
comfortable with one you will be able to pick up the other fairly easily.  Try
out your 1.1 on the CoCo2.  You can't do as much with it as you can do with
Level 2 on a CoCo3 but it will offer enough to be worthwhile.  And if you find
a copy of the Level 2 system you'll already have a head start on it.

Also, there was an upgrade for OS-9 Lvl 1 ver 1.1 to ver. 2.0 that would allow
it to run on a CoCo3.  You might be able to dig up one of those upgrade
packages.  It would still be a Level 1 system as opposed to a Level 2 system,
but there were some patches for Level 1 ver. 2.0 that allowed the CoCo3's extra
memory to be used for RamDisk area.

The ideal thing to do is try to get up to Level 2 ver. 02.00.01.  It exploits
the CoCo3 more completely.

Also - I forget EXACTLY where (Kev?), but there's a constant that you can
change in the pre-boot or boot code from $FF00 to $FE00 and LI versions 1.00
and 1.01 will boot (this code is resident in the first several bytes on track
34). The reason is that a CC3 uses the uppermost page as an interrupt table,
and os9 LI loading there clobbers it.

The OS9 boot file on the Dynacalc disk will not work on a COCO3, but you can
run the program if you have OS9 Level II to start it with. (Mabe someone knows

you can run Dynacalc in an 80-column window, and it will use the extra space to

 What sort of errors do you get. Are they 243,244, or 247. Or do you mean that

Dear Tom, What are you using to format the drive? I think that there was a

RGB-DOS which I am not certain if it is still available. I still think,
however, I finally had luck with SCS1_4.7. I had to make a new Boot disk. Very
easy with EZGEN from BURKE and BURKE. It is possible
 that the first sector on the HD is bad. As a final thought, years ago it was
suggested that if a cassette tape did not load properly, one should turn the
tape player upside down. Rainbow always had letters proving that
 it worked. I did the same with my HArd Drive and I was able to format it. I
have some theories as to why it worked, but in any case it did. Don't give up,
the folks here were very helpful when I couldn't get mine working.

the book.  The patches will make things work faster, take less memory space, or
have additional abilities.  Some also fix some minor bugs in the Level 2 system
which you may never notice unless you're doing more unusual things.  What
you're doing is what I did and it turned out fine. You may want to download the
IPatch utility now.  When you are ready to begin applying patches the IPatch
utility is necessary for many of them. I would recommend you always keep a
backup copy available and make patches on a new disk in case something goes
wrong.  It may also help you later if you keep records of your patches.  This
way if you should run into conflicts or have any other trouble you can trace
your steps backwards and maybe find the problem faster.  I also numbered my
boot disks with revision numbers like those you find on software packages; my
last book disk is Version 9.2 (eight major revisions after my first one, and
two minor revisons since the last major one)

John,
      As I understand it we have arranged for supply of the OS-9 echo to our
BBS (3:640/316) here in the state of Queensland, Australia. I am in the process
of writing some notes for the editorial of our Australian OS-9 newsletter with
a view to encouraging subscription to the new OS-9 community network and the
Fidonet BBS network here in Australia. I am confident that support will be
substantial. I still have not been able to track down a membership application
form for the "OS-9 Community Network". Any additional information that you may
be able to provide would be great. Regards & best wishes, Rob MacKay. (27th
January 1992).

Yeah, I ordered the C compiler from RS and they gave me the disks but not
book!! I don't know if I got it all or what! I've been having trouble compiling
a few things cause I don't have the file 'string.h' or 'strings.h'. Do you know
where I can get them? I know that most everyone is moving on to bigger things.
I hoping to buy a 386 this spring. I've been looking at some 40 mhz systems
that have had me drooling over them!<grin> It would be great if the CoCo ran
that fast! Imagine that! Thanks for you help.

I always get this mixed up, but in UNIX land, System V uses either string.h or
strings.h, and Berkeley uses the other one.

You should be able to get all the .h files you need by downloading Carl
Kreider's C Library replacement stuff. Browse over in DL3.

Yell for any help you need - that's why we iz here. Also, beat on Rat Shack
until they produce a book for you. Won't help you with C, but will give you
some compiler poop to mull over.

Thanks for the help. I finally find the header files I need after replying to
the previous message. I must have missed it before or something. (who knows
what happens at 4:30am??) Now I need to find the RMA file for the CC program.
I'll probably find after I leave this but just in case, do you know the file I
need to get by chance? Rat Shack finally gave up on the book so I bought 'Teach
Yourself C' by Herbert Schildt. Its pretty much informative and shows some
great examples of stuff. Welp, I'm off!

Under the RS version of the Level 1 C Compiler (works fine on L2, BTW), RMA =
C.ASM and RLINK = C.LINK.

I don't know what level version I have of the C Compiler other than it being
version 1 (c)1983. It didn't have the files RMA or RLINK in it. I did find a
patch file for RMA and RLINK here. I tried them out on c.asm and c.link and it
didn't work. Do I have all the files that I need? Or should I just give up and
buy a new computer that has tons of software available?

Easy, pal...... let's get the facts foist:

What DO you have on the disk? To my knowledge, the ONLY C compiler R/S ever
sold for OS9 was the LI coco version, and it used C.link, and C.asm. There was
an UPDATE to these later on the LII Developer's Kit that offered RMA and RLINK.

Send a directory of your disk and we'll take it from there. Remember when you
store the message here to use 'SU' (store unformatted), or the CIS editor will
mung it as it sees fit.

Fm: Jay Truesdale 72176,3565
To: all

A few weeks ago a few people mentioned Microware's new "Mshell," and how great
it would be to have except that the price was out of the reach of most hacker
types (myself included).

Here's a marketing suggestion for Microware:

In recognition of the benefits of having an avid (evangelical?) group of users
spreading the word about their products, run a limited time special offer to
users of the Compuserve and Delphi OS-9 forums.  Set it up so that if you
mention the 'the Compuserve/Delphi special' you would get a discount on one
copy of Mshell. I don't think that this would affect their commercial sales
much, how many of their commercial accounts are on here?  In my opinion, a
selling price of $100.00 would be reasonable.

Thoughts, comments?

My personal feeling is that mshell should become a part of standard OSK system.
The current shell is about brain dead, and badly needs replacement.  Mshell is
a wonderful addition and should be seen as part of standard distribution for
enhancing user productivity.  mshell will sell the OS.  Marketing it separately
keeps the majority of users in the dark about realizing that there is a good
shell.  A good normal distribution shell is a plus.  For those who want an
upgrade of shell only, it should be made as available as possible to help get
OSK of the launching pad with acceptance.

Your idea sounds great.....but I doubt that it will happen.

I checked on the prices of both the latest version of the C Compiler, and also
MW's Lint program (well, that wasn't the name they used, but it sure does SOUND
like a lint program).

Both of them were $850, and they would NOT budge one red cent from that price.


The OSK marketplace is full of commercial users, not us home computer users,
from what I'm told, and they price their programs on the basis of what they
will sell for in the commercial marketplace.

As the OSK marketplace right now has between 5,000 and 10,000 systems, and us
68070/68000 new marketplace probably does not exceed about 250 (for all TC70,
MM/1 and System IV systems sold), our 'voice' will be little heard in Des
Moines.

If our 'new age' machines ever hit the 1-2,000 sales, then we might start
having a slightly larger say in pricing of MW stuff.

Until the, regretably,  we'll be the little fly buzzing around the head of MW.

I'm not putting us down, mind you, be we gotta look at this marketplace
realistically.
