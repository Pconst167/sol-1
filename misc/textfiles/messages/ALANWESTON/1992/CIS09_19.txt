Yes, along with the sources I got docs to the parent version.  There are enough
diffences that I'd prefer not to ship it, but I have a marked up hardcopy and
just need to type in the changes, nroff it, etc.  All I really need is more

Hi Paul... When can I expect to get my OSK manuals? This is getting ridiculous!
I've had the machine for almost a year and I'm still stumbling around guessing
at things and/or asking people questions to find out what I should know
already. Lets have some manuals!!!

Glen,

I suspect that you'll have to order the manuals directly from Microware. You
might also contact Ed Gresick at DELMAR.  He has told me he might be interested
in selling the OSK manual set to those that don't have them.

I realize that your MM/1 purchase was supposed to include manuals.  From what I
and been told, the original agreement between Microware and IMS was that they
would get only a few (I believe it was about 50) sets of OSK manuals for the
number of licenses IMS purchased (which was more than the 50).  It was up to
IMS to write their own manuals for their machine and include in them all they
felt was necessary from the Microware manual set.  Not to say it was OK form
IMS to copy the information verbatim, but to create a new set of manuals. 
Those were the manuals that IMS was to provide along with the machine.

Needless to say, this set of manuals has not been done.  I have contacted Paul
Ward about this several months ago and said I would do the manuals.  He has
still not gotten back to me on it or sent me the information he promised to
enable me to start writing them.

Last I heard, the manual set from Microware was going for about $120, or maybe
as low as $80.  Let me know what the price is if you decide to contact them or
Ed Gresick.

Hi Mark... This is starting to make me a little mad. I talked to MicroWare.
They want something like $200+ for a set of manuals. I don't think I should
have to pay extra - they should come with the machine.

Fm: Jim Sutemeier 70673,1754
To: all C programmers

I have a question regarding recursive use of functions for you C people.

If I recursively call the same function within the function, where will the
system pointer return to when the 2nd call to a function is made???

Example:

func() { /* program coding*/ if (my params exist){
   secondfunc();
   func();
   } /*other continued code*/ }

I have called up the function 'secondfunc() if all conditions exist, and after
secondfunc() runs, I want to run the original func() from it's beginning, with
information that I get from secondfunc().

After secondfunc() runs, then func() runs, does the system pointer then go back
to the end of the func() call, therefore executing rest of the code from my
original call to func()??  If so, I should declare an exit after func().

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks much for your help!!

Each 'instance' of 'func()' gets copies of all of the code within func(),
therefore upon execution secondfunc() and func(), program control will return
to whichever copy of func() called it, and execute the rest of the code in
_that_ copy of func(), before returning to its caller, which MAY be another
copy of func(). If that's the case, the calling copy of func()'s remaining code
will then be executed upon return.

Also - don't use exit() unless you want to leave the program. You could use
return(), if the situation called for it....

Thanks for the information, Pete --> that is what I really did expect, but
needed confirmation from someone who had done it before.

Now I gotta rewrite some coding so I can use a break statement after that
second call to func(), so the program doesn't re-run from that point.

Take care, and thanks again.

Great, but use 'return', and not 'break'... break is only useful leaving a

This might be heresy...but you might consider using a GOTO <ducking>. I find
goto's very useful to exit a function without a lot of flag checking simply by
putting an EXIT label at the end and then doing a goto EXIT. You might also
consider doing a loop at the top of you function to loop back rather than
calling it recursively (hard to judge that, not knowing what it is you are
doing).

return is fine, but the compiler will give all kinds of warnings if you just do
a return from a function not declared as void (return 0 is fine). And declaring
functions as void has it's own interesting side effects...

When I went to school to learn 'the basics' about C, I had a total of 3
instructors.  I got 3 DIFFERENT answers about using goto's from these
gentlemen.  1) Never use goto's; 2) they are part of the language, and
therefore can be used anywhere and anytime you want to; and 3) use them
judiciously, there is normally another way out of your problem than using a
goto.

I prefer to think in terms of using goto's as the third man told me - judicious
use.

Thanks for the tips.

We have two Denning robots - they have 68K processors (the older one a 68008,
the newwer one I think is a 68000, but I am not sure).  They both use OSK (the
older one uses OSK version 1.something in ROMs, the newwer one has a boot
floppy).

This is at UMass/Amherst.  We use these beasts for robotics research (mostly
driven from silly UNIX boxes).  The 68Ks are used to manage Z80s controling the
drive motors and ultrasonic sensors and to communicate to the outside world

Has he been nagging? Sure ... during the first several months of the missing

... over a year later he finds out the drivers have yet to be written!

The sad part of the story is that the touted compatability between the QT tape
functions/format and the TC70 was _the_ deciding factor in purchasing yet
another computer from Frank. All his data is on a stack of tapes he can't
access.

On your Kwindows .. did you get that from Frank? Or did it come directly from
