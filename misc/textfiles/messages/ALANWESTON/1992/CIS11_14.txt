So you're all fixed up for 9600 baud, eh Bob. Well ... fixed up sans modem.

Carl's posted some of his serial utilities in LIB 12 that may be of interest.
Serstat lets you look at the inner workings of the port, rtson and rtsoff lets
you set RTS on the fly.

Let us know when the new box arrives.

B+ will back down to a "send and wait" protocol (like old B or XMODEM) if
enough errors occur, and then go back to full B+ when the transmission starts
going well enough again.

B+ also specifies that the packet size is 1024 bytes at 2400 baud or above, 512
bytes for 1200 and 128 for 300 baud.  Their reasoning is to keep the packet
send time at 5 seconds or less to help reduce the cost of sending repeat
packets in case of an error, and also to reduce the amount of time it takes for
the protocol to recover from on error when there are several packets in the
acknowledgement queue (since B+ is a sliding windows type protocol).

BTW: Steve Wegert and I have the OSK version of Kermit 5A which also has
sliding windows.  Works real nice.  Now if CIS or Delphi would implement it it
would be better.

I _was_ running ver46 as I wasn't aware that Kev had released anything later.

I've just returned from Ocean BBS and have rebuilt my boot with ver48 stuff.
(yes Mark ... I'll bring that in as well!)

I'll have to ask Kev if he minds us making v48 available. Seems Warren got it
from Gary Lathem who got it from Paul. And you know how that goes sometimes!

I agree the dissappearing mouse sounds driver related. Perhaps the stuff in v48
corrects it.

Steve -

Edition 48 was put together for the CoCoFest.  Since people said it had some
sort of bug in an ANSI routine (it all seems to work to me?), I didn't post it.
But you can if you want.  I'm trying to finish up the next (final?) version
which will have built-in menu support features/etc.

I think we've tracked down the mouse thingie:  it usually happens after hard
disk access... the mouse serial driver gets an overrun error and locks up. 
Once we figured that out, I changed the v48 code in such a way that it
should've fixed the problem, but for some reason it didn't.

Then finally, either Kevin Pease or Carl found out that the *manuals* are wrong
about the way the errors are handled on the chip.  That figures. Anyway, I
believe Pease is testing a version he custom wrote which should get around all
that.  I'll try to get the code from him and make all new modules.

On another topic, I notice that Mike sometimes (usually?) forks processes with
the same main screen type to the same screen as Desktop... on a small screen
they end up overlapping all of Desktop and this is hard to tell (unless you
click on the To-Back window control).  We'll talk this method over.  - kevin

Kev,

I'll make v48 public today.

Thanks for the info on the mouse lock ups ... I'll be looking forward to the
fix.

One other area you might be able to assist with (and I'm not certain it's even
related to windows) is having what appears to be stardard in locking up ... but
all other paths are fine.

Here's what happens:

I'm running Sterm and connect to one particular type of modem (some kind of
DEC). It is 2400 baud and supports upto MNP level 3. I get a solid error
checking connect and the session will be fine for a few minutes. Then the
screen freezes.

I get nothing but anything I type is sent out the modem (I can see the lights
flicker and the guy on the other end is reporting my data back to me).

This has started to happen since I switched to my new SupraFax 9600 baud modem
and started using the console more. I haven't been able to duplicate it from a
terminal yet, but i'm still trying.

I can't figure out any particular pattern as of yet ... exccept it generally
hits me when I'm inside an OSK mail editor replying to mail.

Do you have any ideas I can try that might help isolate this?

Here are my possibilities ... have I left any out?

        1) The modem. Swap in an old 2400 non error correcting modem and the
        problem never occurs. Set the new modem to no error correcting and
        the problem hasn't occured. However, I only have this happen with
        this one particular DEC modem in Southern FL. He swaps to a different
        modem and all is fine.

        2) Serial driver related. I'm always on /t3 for the modem so perhaps
        there's still something with the sc68681 driver.

        3) Windows. Perhaps some escape sequence is getting back and locking
        the screen?

Please read msg # 16776 - is there anyone that knows about Atari/OSK from a
company in the UK?  I thought this was the OS9 SIG .. maybe I'm wrong .. maybe
I was wise to ditch this place a year ago and probably should stay away from
OSK altogether if this is the kind of help I'm going to get. (e.g. NO help)

An Atarian said the exchange rate a few weeks ago made him pay about $251. (US)
and the original post I put here tells the rest - 8kg of books is over 17 lbs.
to us non-metric types.

And I'm wondering if this version of OSK has a windowing environment, too, even
if I hafta get it from another company, does Atari/OSK have windows??

Whether or not windows for Atari/OSK exists, is $251 a good price for the
package?  I am dead seriously thinking about getting it.  I do not have any
kind of budget to get any other kind of 680x0-based machine -Atari-ST I already
own, put on 4-meg RAM, upgraded to Turbo-16MHz board (with instruction cache),
and I've even gotten a multisync monitor working with all 3 resolutions
accessible (and I'm presently using that same monitor on my CoCo3, too).

Paul,

Actually, I had thought your original posting was more of an informational
nature... that you were going to get the package anyway and then tell the rest
of us all about it :-)

See, the Cumana port has only really been sold overseas. That's why it would be
unusual to get a response here on US-dominated boards... nobody here has it! 
(People here had instead bought the ST port which Microware took over.)

The only thing (besides the MIDI driver, which you mentioned) that I recall as
being different from the MW version, is that supposedly all the drivers are
completely standalone.  (The MW version's drivers use some of the builtin TOS
ROM code.)

I *think* I've heard that the Cumana port has some form of multiscreen
environment, but I can't swear to it.  We're still trying to figure out if my
KW driver works on all STs (so that people won't get it for no reason). I
believe you can buy G-Windows for the Cumana port, but again, I just haven't
seen it in person and can't swear to it.  I'll try to ask on the internet for
more details.

Is it worth the price?  I think so, if it's the Pro package with C compiler
(which I believe it is).  Does it come with Basic too?  As you said, the ST is
a good machine (and quite okay in speed)... and super inexpensive these days.

I'd *greatly* appreciate some more input from internet folks if you could do
that for me!  I just got my access to internet/ftp/telnet on Delphi and will
probably start "living" over there 'cuz of their cheap rates.

Well the problem with MW's port is that I wouldn't get all that tonage of books
& software with their back-level "personal" Atari/OSK, which is the only
version MW sells that I can afford.  The "Pro" is still around $600, isn't it? 
I'd rather spend $250 with fluctuating exchange rates to get something very
close to MW's Pro package.  Cumana's seems to be much more complete, too, with
meeses & MIDI support (we gotta get Mike Knudson working on an Atari version if
rewriting is needed!). And then I'm very apprehensive about ROM levels -- I
almost ordered the TOS 2.61(?) hdwr upgrade which extends the buss to 24-bit I
think going to/from the ROMs, and that could play havok with MW's OSK.  So once
again I'm talking myself into Cumana's being a "safer" port.  I thought there
was a trick in accessing the I/O circuitry directly, and MW's port would be
"safer" in this regard.  But I dunno!  Ya know I can do some hacking &
'sperimenting, but this time I'm in the dark.  Blowing a wad of money at the
local RS store was a safe bet on buying OS9 there, but having to go overseas to
get it -- I gotta get more input!

I also forgot to ask if MW and/or Cumana can support my ICD SCSI adaptor? (only
1 40-meg h.d. is hooked up right now, but who knows, maybe we can get CD-I or
CD-ROM going one of these days?!  wonder if we could compete against Philips 
;)

Well lessee the bottom line is if there's some kind of multiscreen pkg or
support for either MW or Cumana ports, and which support the ICD SCSI adaptor
(prob'ly one of the older/original ones w/o its own SCSI ID except for the
real-time clock circuit on it).  Those two answers will sure help me pick which
OSK to buy and then finally I'd be "in with da big folks", eh?  -- thx, Paul
Seniura.

Urrgh.  I'm not sure that either port supports the ICD adapter.  Back when the

Oh I know ICD's BBS phone # so lemme ring 'em up (after 10:pm of course).
Anyone can d/l their latest drivers, and boy that cache feature can really make

run rings around a PS/2 model 70 or so.  I had planned to get a "true color"
card but other things ate up my yearly bonus check this time.  With the tech
info on all this stuff, and the right Pro OSK pkg, surely we can do some
incredible things!  But it's sure not easy adding RS232 ports or extra cards to
an ST like the CoCo/MPI can do.  Thanks for all your help!  If OSK falls thru,
there's a "real" port of UNIX for the ST I can think about .. *shudder* ..  --

Yah, it's not easy to add cards to an ST... everything has to be done by
"reads" from the ROM port.  People use reads from 256 different addresses in
order to fake "writing" a byte at a time, for instance.

It's been so long since I formatted my hard disk, that I can only vaguely
remember the details.  Do you have Disto manuals?

First things first:  what kind of controller board are you using?  A SASI one
with two hard drive connectors?   Or are both drives embedded SCSI?  It'll make
a difference.

If it's a separate controller board, then I believe that the default Disto
descriptors are for 20Meg drives.  You can check them to see.  The main thing
is that you'll be using 256-byte sectors instead of 512-byte sectors (eg: IBM
style), so the sectors per track would be about twice the IBM style, or 32
sectors/track.

Hmm.  I don't have the Disto dmode around, so I can't recall if it took hex or
decimal.  Post the output of a dmode of your current hard drive and we can
figure it all out.

The init command and table, btw, usually contains something like this in hex:
 0C    -- sasi init command
 0280  -- 640 cylinders
 08    -- ?? number of heads
 0280  -- reduced write current cylinder
 0280  -- precomp cylinder
 0B    -- max error correction data length

The drive number needs to be different for a second drive, of course.  Try the
Disto H1 descriptor.  - kev

People are working on such things.  Since most of us have to interleave our
programming time with our regular jobs, family obligations, etc, it takes some
time to get the things we are working on done.  If you really need something
that badly, why don't you write it up yourself?  Most of the programs available
for OS-9/OSK were done for that reason....the user needed it.

I'd wait until you have it all together and working properly before you release
it.  Also, do some more work on the current versions and add some error
messages to them.  If you don't put a parameter on the command line or a wrong
parameter is given, it just spits out the help message and doesn't tell you
what you are missing.

Mark, they do spit out error messages and then the help.  That is, if a
parameter is incorrectly specified it tells you so.  Maybe you want me to
complain about not specifying a parameter??  Well, the help should be enough to
tell the user what XYZ expects.  Like are you going to try to record a sound
without specifying a sampling rate?  No, hiffrecord will display help if any of
the necessaries are omitted.  Should I make the docs such that a 4th grader
could use?  I don't think so, but point well taken. %-)

OH, I have most of it working just fine just not together.  I've spent more
time developing the componets instead of the actual interface.  Though the
interface is very important.  What I've decided on is to display only a second
of sound at a time with the screen divided in two(left/right) with indication
of mode Stereo/Left/Right or both Mono etc...  I'm open to any creative ideas.

Steve,

When something is missing from the command line, yes you should put up a
message for the user.  If you think it is too much trouble to try and help the
"4th grade" users, then you shouldn't be trying to sell your programs. Also,
your help messages could be more specific.  Again, the more info you give the
better it will be.  The interface is very important.  If it is not up to snuf
as the user sees it, then they won't have much confidence in the rest of the
program.  Look at the MS-DOS world, help messages are very detailed and context
sensitive.  Not that you need to go that far, but that is what the users want.

The internal cable I was using was an IBM internal cable.  (The manual

I think that the Kix\30 is a great machine.  I have been using an Atari
Mega 2 ST that I upgraded to 4Meg RAM running OSK v2.2, and the Kix\30
is A LOT faster.  One comment (no reflection on the Kix\30): I tried
to frestore the disks that I fsave'd on my Atari and the index structure
was bad (luckily I decided to try it before I reformatted my HD on the
KiX\30).  So I copied the OSK2.2 frestore and tried it on the KiX\30 and
it worked fine (keep this in mind for anyone upgrading from Atari OSK2.2)

The assembly went OK.  Oh I almost forgot the holes in the MB need to be
a little larger in diameter, I had to file down my standoffs in order to
push them into the motherboard.  There also is no mention on how to build
the parallel printer cable.  I assumed from how the serial pinout was done
and from the schematics that I just had to wire it pin for pin to the DB25.

I think it is a wonderful machine and I am hoping that it becomes very
popular (mainly because I would like to see some interesting boards for it)

I'll add the comments about the internal cables to the Tech Manual. The holes
in the MB are the right size but the board house over plated or over tinned
them. We're afraid if we ask them to correct this it may affect the other
holes. If you are very carefull you can ream them out with a 1/8" reamer. Mike
is doing that on boards from here on out so it won't be a problem for future
customers

Interesting about frestore. Our fbu and frs are backward compatible. I'm
surprised that MW didn't make frestore backward compatible.

I'm glad you like your KiX\30. The first production run sold out within weeks.
Orders are coming in very strong for it and interest is building as word gets
out. Looks like we have a winner here.

Kev,

Here's an update on the hanging problem I described earlier.

I had the same thing happen running off my Wyse terminal, so that lets windows
off the hook. I've also had the same thing happen with just using Kermit as the
terminal program, so Sterm seems to be in the clear.

Hmmm... it sounds as if the device descriptor bytes are set improperly.

Most HD formatting routines simply issue a FORMAT TRACK 0 to the device driver.
This in turn causes the driver to issue a formatting command to the hard disk
controller, which handles the physical formatting.

When the formatting is 'done', the hard disk driver causes all sectors on all
platters to be read back to effect a physical verify. This part IS controlled
by the computer, and is where you seem to be getting into trouble.

Since os9 uses 256 byte sectors (not usually the 512 byte sectors used by DOS),
there's typically more overhead per sector, and you can only get 32 256 byte
sectors per track on a traditional MFM disk.

Use the DMODE utility to verify that your hard disk descriptor is setup for 640
cyls (or maybe 639), 4 heads, and 32 sectors per track, both on track 0 and the
regular tracks.

Hi Kev--I have a wd1002-shd controller--the dmode readings are now cyls=640,
 hds=4 step=4 sectrk=32 sectrk0=32 alloc=1 ilv=5 initcmd=0c inittbl=028004028
002800b000000000000000000000000. The drive is actually rated at 22meg. After
using the info you sent, I set it up as shown and I was able to format for the
first time. It then did a physical verify and came back with the statement that
the number of good sectors was $0040000. I then tried a dir and got a 214.

Well - #214 is a permission error.

Does rebooting help? Also - is there a H0 or DD descriptor permanently setup
with those parameters (cyls, heads, etc.)?

Also - try a simple DUMP of H0@. Snag the first couple sectors to a floppy or
printer, and we'll have a look at the LSN0 information.

How do I configure a 1.44 floppy to the correct drive number?

I have a Citizen which I'd like to set as drive 1. I see a real small switch
next to the stepper motor which seems to have two settings. I assume these are
for High density/normal modes. There is a small jumper block behind the power
connecter. It appear to have 6 pins; looking at the top it is set as follows:

        X--X  X
    X--X  X

I assume this to be the drive number select. Anyone with a tech manual?

Do you know if there is an implementation of OS/9 for the  Intel 80x86

Yes there is a version of os9 for 80X86 machines. It is called OS9000. And I
believe it is Romable like os9.
