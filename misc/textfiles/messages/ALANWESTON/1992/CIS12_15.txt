Dear friends:

I am looking for either a stock Tandy controller preferrable for the 502
doubled sided 40 track disks, or a Super Controller 1 or two. If anyone has one
for sale, please let me know price, shipping arrangments, etc. I thank you for
your response. With all best wishes, Br. Jeremy, CSJW

Jeremy,  You can still get a Super Controller 2 from CRC in Canada. I just got
one from them a month ago.  Here is their phone number:

Thanks Bill.  BPDOC.ARC in IBMCOM was just what I needed.

I'm not exactly sure.  There is a file you can download from CIS that has the
full protocol specs in there, but I can't remember the name or where it is. 
Perhaps a more knowledgeable SYSOP here will be able to tell you. Hang on for a
day or so and I'm sure the information you need will magically appear here
(grin).

I'm glad you liked Sterm.

Is there any way to initialize a variable to the value of the offset of a field
within a structure? I want to initialize various structures with a table driven
approach, and don't want to have to initialize each offset or pointer variable
at run time.

Bill, hope we're not working on the same project <g>. I had to something which
I think is what you are asking. Code like:

 struct {
   char sc;
   int si;
   char *spc;
 }teststruct;

 char *test=&teststruct.spc;

Does produce the correct results with the 68K compiler. Don't know about the
6809... Oh, and remember that the above is NOT the best way to structure the
structure. 3 padding bytes are inserted inbetween 'sc' and 'si' for alignment.
You're best off to put the chars and shorts at the end of the structure. Mixing
chars and ints really eats up lots of memory when using structures.
