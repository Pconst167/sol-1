Believe me, gratuitous insults and flamage *are* wasted effort, and I think
that we now have more than enough examples of that.  Perhaps further study of
how to motivate people is in order.

Sure, a few people have had prototype machines for years.  What's your point? 
There aren't a bunch of OS-9 developers with any graphics experience, and even
they only work on programs in their spare time.  So I don't think anyone
expects a multi-color Lotus 1-2-3 clone to suddenly spring forth.

I think we *will* see some neat stuff, but it takes time and money... which are
both in short supply during this recession.

But going around posting morose messages with "I don't think the windows will
ever be finished" and crap like that sure doesn't help any.  And no, insults
don't make difficult code easier to write.  What a strange idea.

Hey, doomsayers are a dime a dozen everywhere.  Try stopping into Amiga or
Atari groups sometime... there's always a heavy thread going on about how
"Ohmigod it's too little too late" or "Our system is doomed" or you-name-it.

It's so sad it's almost funny.  What a misdirected waste of time and effort!
And frankly, it's a slap in the face to people who're still working hard.

Don't nitpick :-)  I meant $300 for the additional G-Windows developer's
package if bought separately, of course.  The point being: you need it if you
want to program G-W specific stuff, vs just being a user.

I've got nothing against that, of course.  I can no longer live without
charging something either :-)

Hate to admit it, but I haven't fully hooked up the TC70 yet.  It ended up
arriving a week or so after I got in Tony's color digitizer, and things got
clogged up around here.  You know how that goes <sigh>.  Should have it working

I'll answer in the order of your questions: On FidoNet (OS9), the regional
libraries are posted monthly. On other networks, they have been posted
irregularly (this should change to monthly, soon).

Our services include: The NetNews 8 OS-9 file areas Member directory
(international) Vendors listing (1st in 2 mos.) Job listing (time?) Microware
(and other relevant vendor's) product announcements

Our former secretary was overburdened with too many resposibilities. Her duties
are now assumed by two officers.

Yes, I must admit that I have an ST1040FM running OSK(V2.4), allthough I don't
run it every night. The problem with the GNU-c-compiler is that it will most
likely not run in the Atari, because of to little memory. The ansi-c-compiler
is almost 500k in object when it is unpacked, and the C++ is over 700kb(it
takes a bit to load it the first time). I have used it a bit, to port
'unix'-stuff to os9. Using the 'v7make' from top-munic-package and the
GNU-c-compiler made the ports not so painfull as with Microwares compiler.

Paul,

Can't help fixing the OSTERM problem but I can offer a work around for the bit
with needing a control C to log into CompuServe:

Instead of hitting a ^C, just thump return. You'll be prompted for a HOST, to
which you need to reply CIS or CPS.

After that it's just like you're used to.

There is a big advantage using this method over the ^C, in that you won't
inadvvertantly drop the line. You're always taken back to the HOST prompt for a
final OFF command.

Hope this helps.

Thanks for the feedback, Steve.  I've been out of town and will have to get
back to the missing LF problem now.  I will look (again) at DEFAULT, but that
was source of some problems of a different nature a couple of weeks ago and I
think it's all ok now (but will recheck).  I'll also have to try to be more
critical in my observation of the glitch to see as exactly as I can when and
where it happens.  I'm inclined to a belief that it is something related to the
scrolling of the screen at the end of a message.  I suspect there's something a
bit different about the sequence of characters at the end of a message that at
the end of a line in the middle of a message; and that this is somehow tangling
with the scrolling of my local monitor.  I don't know of anything unusual in my
setup; Magnavox monitor connected to the RGB output of COCO3; running Shell+;
using the Shack Serial Pak; using the Disto Super Controller and the OWL/LR
hard disk controller.  I don't really believe any of the disk controller paks
likely since I'm not logging when the line feed gets dropped.  So.o.o.o, I'll
ponder and watch closely and see what occurs.  Thanks for encouragement.  Ches.

Steve, it may be a longer search than I feared.  Apparently, STERM is inserting
a $09 at infrequent intervals.  The result is to bump the cursor up one line
part way thru the line, then the next $0D starts the next line and over writes
what was on that line.  The $09 apparently comes in just after the   * Replies:
so the reply msg number(s) show up in the body of the message and the next line
writes over the  * Replies  .  Interesting but somewhat confusing.  The message
that had the garble is quite repeatable as to the insertion of the $09 on STERM
but no such garble when that same message is received on WIZ.  Wiz and STERM
use different drivers so that may give me a clue.  But why is a $09 always
inserted just before the reply msg numbers???  Cute, huh.  Ches.

Interesting that $09 is the COCO/MM1 control code for cursor up. Sterm is just
doing what it's told to do ... passing the $09. Your screen is just acting upon
it. Sterm is not inseting it ... but it must be getting it from somewhere.

Now ... why doesn't this happen on my screen?

Take one more trip to Default. I'll bet your TABs are set to REAL.

Since the CoCo windows interprets a TAB (^I) as a cursor up, your screen is
gonna dance whenever an $09 is in the stream.

Change that puppy to SIMULATED and I'll bet the problem dissappears.

 Does it hot key instantly between screens like coco windows or does it paint

Mike - It's not a bug, just something you don't see very often :-)

Actually, you probably did a "dirm" and it showed FFFF as the link count.

The stock command "mdir e" more appropriately shows "Lock" for the same value.

As you know, $FFFF is the highest possible value for a module link count (max
value that can be held in two bytes).  Any links afterwards won't increment the
count (because you'd roll over to 0000, then 0001, etc). Therefore, unlinks
can't be honored either (the link/unlinks might not match up).

So the module can't be unlinked and is considered "locked" into memory. You
could write a util that did that many links to any module if you wanted it to
stay around for sure :-)

well one thing for sure is OS9 is stable! The longest record for running the
machine without re-booting is 4 months. Im sitting about 2-3 months now and
unlike that time I use the machine more. (that 4 months i was away at college
the bbs was the only thing running)

I assumed it would roll over and i was told that it would unlink from memory
(roll over to 0 and drops out) but obvoisly this proves that wrong.

hello George.

I have just posted 'OS9MAX'-demo in lib 12 of OSK. Unfortunate I couldn't find
'lharc', so had to use 'pkarc'. As this is a demo-version, there is some
limitation in what you can do, but if those commands work, it is very unlikely,
that the full-featured program should not work.

Dear Friends: During the past few weeks I have noticed a lot of negative
comments on the networks regarding certain members of our COCO community. I
realize that some of these comments are made out of frustration. Folks have
bought MM1's or one of the new systems and are waiting for he bugs to be worked
out. Others are continuing to use the COCO3 and are worried about a lack of
support. But I would like everyone to step back for a moment and look at the
situation.  Our machine has officially been out of production since Sept '89.
The COCO's are gone. Tandy is no longer interested...Microware...? Mcuh of what
we have seen come out since has been the work of "hobbyist" Sure some of the
people are professional programmers, but many have gone way beyond just
developing commercial products. If I had to pay for all the free advice I have
gotten from Kevin Darling, James Jones, Lee Veal, Mike Haaland, Shawn Driscoll,
Marty Goodman, and many others who I don't have space to name, it would far
exceed my connect charges. If I might be so presumptious, I have come to
consider these people my friends. It was very exciting for me to meet many of
you last year at Rainbowfest. As you introduced yourselves to me, (I do have a
way of standing out in a crowd, you know) I was like a little kid. I felt, my
goodness I'm meeting the famous (you fill in your own name.)
 I feel our community is special. Oh sure, I have hounded Kevin about the level
2 upgrade to the point that I am surprised when he answers my messages. I
bemoan the lack of an OS-9 Version of Max-10, while making very slow progress
on writing one. And I publically apologize to all of you. But you folks have
been wonderful. Please, keep criticisms directed in valid ways, not personal
attacks. I'm not trying to be the COCO Chaplain, (but I would accept the
nomination...), but I hate to see people discouraged in their efforts , on all
of our behalf, by comments said in anger or frustration.

With all best wishes, to all of you, my dear friends, Br. Jeremy, CSJW

Very nicely said, Chaplain.  As one of many "lurkers" on the MM comments, I
have also been somewhat saddened by the occasional vitriol that appears. Folks,
we have a mighty fine computer in the CoCo and some mighty fine potential in
the MM and others; they're worth a bit of struggle to keep and enjoy.  But even
more important is the camaraderie and joy of accomplishment represented by the
Kevins, Steves, and Martys (please excuse the shorthand for naming so many
helpers) who so willingly and patiently explain (again and again) the mysteries
of OS9 etc.  The frustration is evident, but it would be nice to see comments
focused on tangibles and not on personalities. It is a real pleasure to be
associated with you all.  With highest regards, Ches.

Of course, you are 100% correct. The only problem is that everyone around here
is only human, and such are subject to getting pretty frustrated at times. I
just hope that when someone dumps on another member of our commnunity it is
taken in the most charitable manner possible. Not only do we have to remember
the human frailities we all have, but also the very real problem of this
written communication medium which is so unforgiving (it's real hard to read
between the lines like you can in a face to face conversation).

Thanks for reminding us all.

Thanks for info, Larry.  Referring back to your last message and your interest
in "a more elegant solution"; I think your approach is probably better than the
one I was using with a patched Shell+.  The problem with a non-standard
approach is exemplified by my loss of the patch info and thus the loss of a
useable method.  What I'm doing now works with either MultiVue or without by
using the following script under the title of MUSE in the CMDS directory: 
xmode /w7 type=1;tshell umuse3<>>>/w7&  .  tshell is the original tandy shell
patched to have the name tshel but saved as tshell. Typing MUSE <enter> starts
UMusE in a VDC window, but I still have to <CLEAR> to go to that window and use
UMusE.  Regards, Ches.

The Mouseman is a Microsoft compatible mouse, not a Logitech compatible mouse. 
Go figure that one out.

It would take a new driver, but I can't do it.  The MM/1 mouse drivers are not
drivers per se but interrupt handlers as far as I know.  I don't know how it
could be interfaced unless Kevin wants to make a mouse driver for the Microsoft
mouse.

Bob,

 >Is there a way to do a real physical format on these?

If you have a Quantum or a Conner, no.  I take it from your message that you
did select a physical format but it only took a couple seconds.  This is what
the drives above do.  They are already formatted from the factory and use a
special format to get the increased speeds.  When you send a SCSI format
command to the drive, it just does a check on itself and returns a success (or
something like that).

If you need to do a real format, you'll have to send the drive out to a depot
repair site or return to the manufacturer.  You can still mark out bad sectors
by doing a physical verify and it will mark out in the bitmap those sectors
that it can't read.

If you have a Quantum Drive, you can use the SCSI Mode Select command to set
the "Fill Data Pattern Enable" bit in one of the Quantum Unique Drive Control
Parameter pages.  Then you can specify a data pattern in the SCSI Format Unit
command.

I have not actually done this myself, but this is what the "Product Manual" for
my Quantum drive says.  The Quantum drives seem to be so reliable that I just
let the drive take care of itself.  Well, most of the time anyway :)

I personally like the Televideo 965 terminal. We used to get 955s until they
were priced more than the 965.  The 965 is a better terminal anyway.

I like the fact that they are one of the few terminals on the market that DO
NOT come with a BRAIN DAMAGED PC style keyboard layout (but this is just my
opinion).

It has a lot (16 I think) of programmable function keys. It has a good number
of specially labled editing type keys like "page", "home" "line insert/delete",
"char insert/delete," etc.  The cursor keys are laid out in a reasonable
pattern.

The CTRL key is only separated from the "A" key by a caps lock key.  I would
have preferred that it be RIGHT next to the "A" but this is as close as they
come (I looked at a lot of terminal keyboards). At least it isn't off down by
the space bar.

We've had some trouble with reliability of 955 keyboards but so far the 965
keyboards (which are newer) have not given us any trouble.

The 965 can go at least 19.2 KB, if not 38.4.  I know the 955 goes 38.4 but
can't remember for sure if the 965 does. Since it is newer than the 955 I would
expect it to.

Just my .02.
