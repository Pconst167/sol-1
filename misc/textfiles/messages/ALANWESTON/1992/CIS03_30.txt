Agreed, Delphi will have the very same interactive mode--but at the price, I
can deal with it there.

I've been looking at PRICEFORUM, and a fair number of people seem to be saying
they'd like at least some forums (those who don't say all forums propose that
each user choose up to n for some small n to be billed at a flat rate) included
in a flat rate package.  I've said that, too, on PRICEFORUM and via FEEDBACK.

We'll see what happens, I guess.

Wayne,

I have to say I agree in part with what James says.  CIS is not making any
points with members who do not own a Mac or IBM clone by not releasing the
specs to develop an interactive program.  They could at least give some sort of
license or get a non-disclosure agreement to one or two people in each of the
forums to develop such a product.

I've also noticed the membership here getting smaller and smaller over the
years while Delphi continues to flourish, mostly because of the pricing
schemes.  Delphi's interface is slow, cumbersome, difficult to use, and
whatever other phrases one cares to make up.  It stinks, but you get what you
pay for eh? On the other hand, most of the new uploads are appearing there. 
Looking through our data libraries is dissapointing compared to Delphi's OS9
section.

I guess what I'm saying and what James is saying too it unless CIS starts doing
some more to try and intice new members and keep old ones, the exodus to Delphi
will continue until this forum is dead.  I realize that they might only care
about the hundreds of thousands of members in the Mac and IBM forums, but we
also help pay the bills too.  A tiny little crumb thrown our way once in a
while would do much to help.

Mark

Yup... I agree with a lot of what you say, and have used those same points in

Wiz,

I can recall when HMI was released, it came with the announcement of CompuServe
wanting developers to make use of the protocol ... and even went as far as
saying C routines were being developed to make it easier.

I suppose opinions have changed over time, eh?

Is Sandy Trevor still with CompuServe? I wonder if a note dropped his direction
might be of some help? Or have you already covered this ground?

Sandy was helpful to the CoCo crowd once ... perhap he would be interested in
reprising his role?

Steve,

As far as I know, Sandy is still with CompuServe - I've not heard otherwise.

At this point, though, I'd just recommend that anyone who is seriously wanting
to develop an HMI platform on the CoCo contact CompuServe's software support
folks and explore the possibilities of working with them on it.

Note, though, that from what I'm gathering this kinda deal is NOT what James is
talking about - he wants it released ala publicly available but still
copyrighted, as was the GIF standards.

I, like you, have had no success in prying even the simplest of specs on HMI
out of CIS. I have to admit that I haven't exactly bombarded them with
requests. They are really pushing CIM, I get irritated every time I see it
mentioned. They are effectivley locking non-PC/non-MAC users out, and it isn't
fair. Its particularly frustrating when I see what CIM can do, and is not
available to us "outsiders". To be able to download a file in one window, while
reading messages in another and having a one on one conference with another
user all at the same time, on the same screen, is really something to see.

Hopefully they will eventually release something, like they finally did with B
protocol. Meanwhile I've toyed with the idea of hanging a data scope on a CIM
connection and try to decipher the packets, of course they may have already
thought of that and have encrypted the packets, or compressed them, which would
make it just as difficult to figure out.

On a lighter note, I'm in the final stages of testing out a TAPCIS-like set of
programs that I have been working on for the last year or more. I intend to
upload the CoCo version here, possibly as shareware. As soon as I get the I/O
board installed on my MM/1 (waiting for SIMMs and a cable) I will start working
on a version for OSK. (Now you know why I'm interested in HMI :-)

Well...like I said in a message on another forum, Lauren Weinstein is said to
have puzzled out UUCP protocol by experimentation; it should be possible to
figure out HMI similarly, though it would be hard work.

James, CIS's PC & Mac packages are not the only automated
packages/platforms to improve CIS accessability(affordability). Jim Ness
74415,1727 has written and is constantly updating a very good package for
the Atari ST called QuickCIS. Jim's package is freeware, uses the CIS
abbreviated commands (available I believe in a FOR-SALE manual) and it is
extremely functional. I am using it now. I have the program setup to read
the new messages in selected forums,check my e-mail,get new upload listings
for selected forums and save any announcements. I just downloaded >250
messages in <15 minutes (2400 baud). I then scan them off-line and reply as
necessary. I mark new programs for auto download, and request QuickCIS to
post the replies and download the files all with mouse clicks. 

The point of all this is HMI many not be the only option, or is available
online or in guides. You can contact Jim Ness through e-mail or in the
AtariPro forum section 14. Note this section is specifically for QuickCIS.
CIS supports other efforts because it keeps people like you and me online.
Also be aware that Jim is usually busy tweaking QCIS or traveling, but he
is always helpful.

Best Wishes in finding your information.
Bill Healton (not associated with CIS just very satisfied with QuickCIS)

There is also a similar package for the Amiga called "Whap!" that I use for
accessing Compuserve.  This is available in the AMIGAVENDOR forum here and is a
commercial program that you can try.  If you purchase the program, they E-Mail
you an electronic 'key' that unlocks all of the features of the program, pretty
slick in my opinion.

The Icon for the Whap! program shows a terminal that reads "CI$" with a large
weight overhead.  When you double-click the icon to run the Whap! program, the
weight crushes the terminal, "Whapping" your CI$ charges down to more palatible
levels. I think that this is why the program is called "Whap!", in any event it
works even with its (in my opinion) quirks. -J

OS9 Release update-
 Nancy Ward, former OS9CN Secretary, related to the BOD her conversation with
Bill Nobel concerning "control" of the OS9 source code. It seems that Microware
doesn't want to just throw the source to everybody, but wants an organisation
to support it. It seems that, while Microware doesn't support the 6809 version
of OS9, they don't want OS9's reputation to become sullied, which might result
from an indiscriminate release of the code. Actually, the OS9CN was formed, in
part, from input by Microware.
 This being the case, the BOD is advertising positions for Net Coordinators of
the various Networks. The positions are open to those who are willing to put
forth the effort in supporting OS9, and who have a reliable means of storing
the source code. The Net Coordinator positions are similar to the position of
Regional Coordinator, as defined in the OS9CN By-laws. (The current By-Laws can
be found in the January '92 issue of the OCNNetnews, and may be downloaded from
your nearest Regional Library, filename "OCNN.jan91").
 What follows is a listing of the various Networks to be represented:
  STG, RIME, ACBBS, INTERNET, BITNET, CI$, DELPHI, GENIE, WWIV-Link. (There may
be others to be announced in the future).

EDITORIAL:
 Bill Nobel, Int'l OS9CN Representative, has been in contact with Microware,
discussing the release of the OS9 source code to the OS9CN. Microware
apparently does not "own" the windowing system under OS9; Tandy does. Ken
Kaplan, President of Microware, has been in contact with Tandy concerning the
release of the windowing portion of the code. According to Ken Kaplan, via Bill
Nobel, Tandy does not want to release it, but it seems they want to do
something with it, yet. [Hmmm, wild guesses, anyone? Does "upgrade" come to
mind? We'll see...:-) -EC]

 I hope you can help me out. I have been using the shareware version and I
was looking forward to the new menu version.

Kevin, please read msg 14716.  Can you help Larry?  I remember having the
"malloc" problem but can't remember the fix.  Mike hasn't been around since
December.  Thanks, Ches.

Ches - I don't have UMuse, so I'm not of much help.  Hopefully someone who does
have it can aid Larry in tracking down what's happening.

Oh.  Was it something about some util merged in with the shell, or was it a
shell+ thingie or ... ?  Hoping to jog your memory :-)

I knew you weren't a UMUser, but I thought the malloc error might trigger
something.  Seems to me it was a merge of some sort but it's been so long I
can't recall.  Isn't the malloc error a C problem of some sort?  Something
about memory allocation.  Perhaps, as you said, something merged with the
shell.  I'll check my setup more carefully for unremembered merges. Thanks for
feedback.  Regards, Ches.

Ches -

A 'malloc()' error simply indicates that there was not enough 'heap' ram left
to allocate the amount requested by the program. Heap ram is that which is
outside the amount allocated by the initial program fork. Malloc is a C library
function that typically grabs a little more than requested, so the next time a
malloc is requested, memory can be granted from an already snatched pool of
free memory.

Thanks, Pete.  I've gone thru my implementation and see no merges (Kevin's
suggestion).  I've also gone back thru some copies I kept of correspondance
with Mike and find a partial answer by him on the problem.  Seems he has
written some of his own routines to bypass Shell's memory handling routines and
one or more of these was causing the problem earlier (if I'm interpreting his
messages correctly).  Anyway, I've put through a voice message asking Mike to
reappear so we may find out from the "oracle" shortly.  Thanks for your
response.  Regards, Ches.

Ches,

Mike tried to squeeze the absolute maximum amount of memory out of the 64K
limit. In doing so, he made some assumptions about how much memory the shell
would allocate when forking a process. The standard shell uses a minimum of 1
page, shell+ requests a minimum of 31 pages (just under 8K). There is a patch
for shell+ that fixes this. Another possible problem is merging modules, other
than as specifically specified in the UMuse docs.

 I did get screens to work--- but not on vt70 only on gwindows (the demo).  I
beleive it will work
 on a terminal as well.  Vt70 nis just too buggy (and is supposed to be in the
process of being rewritten)

Got the CompuCom Star going with /t0 on my MM/1.  Just had to use the at\q1
command to tell it to use xon/xoff flow control.  Not as fast as it could be,
but it works.  Once I have the paddle board for /t3, I'll move it to /t3.

Can someone help this poor frustrated fellow.  I've been trying to get
a value returned from my getkey function to my main function, and I
have tried many ideas starting with using a 'return()' in the getkey.
I am getting the correct value from the 'printf' statement within the
getkey function, but when I print the value from the main function, I
consistently get some number like 19802 for both 'j' and 'vlu'.  So
it seems that nothing is getting back up, unless the new value is a
pointer to the returned value - just a wild guess.  The following
is a listing of what I have ended up after many trials.  What do
you suggest?
 
   ** program name 'hello/c' **
 
  #include <stdio/h>
  #option INLIB
  int j, vlu;
    main()
    {
     int i;
     int getkey();
     void clearsc();
     void gotoxy();
         clearsc();
         printf("Enter a key when you are ready\n\n");
         getkey(vlu);
         j = vlu;
         printf("vlu answer is %d,  j answer is %d \n\n",vlu,j);
    /*    for(i = 0; i < j; i++)
           {
             gotoxy(i*2,i);
             printf("This is my first program\n");
           }                                             */
    }
    void clearsc()
    {
         fputs("\x1c\x1f",stdout);
    }
    void gotoxy(col,row)
    int col,row;
    {
        cursor(col,row);
    }
    int getkey(vlu)
    {
        while (TRUE)
        {
            vlu = inkey();
            if (vlu != 0)
                break;
        }
        printf(" the answer here is %d \n\n", vlu);
    }
 
    This program is being programmed on a Model IV computer, so if
    there are any peculiarities, I have tried to avoid them.  If I
    seem to be making some silly code, please forgive me, since its
    been three years since I last wrote in C.

Bob,

Change the call to getkey() from getkey(vlu) to vlu=getkey(). Then change
getkey() to:

    int getkey()
    {
        int v;
        while ((v=inkey())==0);
        return v;
    } Hope this helps.

C programmers, I have a question:

  How do you pass a function address to another function and have the second
function execute it?  Example:

  I have a function foo()

int foo()

{
  ... }

  that I want to have another function dofunc() execute.  I call dofunc() in
some manner like

  dofunc(foo);

  so that dofunc() executes foo().  How do I code this?  Your help is
appreciated.

That's exactly what you want to do when you call dofunc.  Now, the interesting
part is the declaration of dofunc():

dofunc(fp)
int (*fp)();
{
   /* blah blah blah */
   (*fp)();
}

Give it a try and let us know how it comes out, OK?

Dear Friends: Once again I am playing with my boot disk. I replaced CC3io with
the version from SMOUSE, and patched Windint with patches from KBCOM and the
"rollover" patch, (stops the title bar from showing when changing windows. I
also wanted to add the clock from SMOUSE, but I don't want to give up my DISTO
RTC on the 4-in-1. I tried using DSETIME but I could not properly get the time
from the RTC. I would hate to have to go back to using SETIME each time I start
up. Can a clock module which allows for IRQ's read the RTC as well? I thought
that my system seemed faster when using the clock from SMOUSE. FInally, I
booted up with my new disk, still using the DISTO clock module, and called up
OSTERM from MV, I run it in a type 2 80 x 24 window. Much sto my surprise, it
ran in a graphics window. I know this for a fact because the fonts I use with
MV are from the MAC, Mike Haaland uploaded them with some window parts. My /w7
was still using the normal text fonts... After logging off, and quitting OSTERM
I restarted it, this time in its normal type window. What do you think
happened?
