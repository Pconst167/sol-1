Thanks, Mike, for the explanation of the C Source Debugger.  The book I have on
it made it sound like quite a program, but was a little terse.

Sounds like a great program; but for $850, I can do a heck of a lot of
debugging on my own.  :-)

Generic Lint--> Yes, Mike, if you have or know where I could get a generic
flavor of lint that is cheaper than the $400-$500 range from Gimpel, please let
me know.

Would seem like as popular as lint apparently is, that there'd be a pd version
somewhere that would do some checking of the code.

Thing is that writing a lint program entails writing most of an optimizing C
compiler--everything except the code generation part--since the data flow
analysis one winds up doing is just what an optimizer wants to see to get rid
of the apparently unnecessary calculations that lint gripes about as potential
bugs!

So...if someone has the urge to do it, go for it.  It wouldn't take that much
added effort to go ahead and write a C compiler.

I've never used lint, but something I have never understood is why it exists at
all. Why have a separate program that is essentially, as you stated, a compiler
minus the code generation parts? Why not just have a compiler with a "don't
generate code option"? This has always puzzled me.

Mark,

     I tried changing the rates=$30 but got the same results. Error 247 until I
dmoded sct and t0s=31. Then formats went fine. Thought you'dlike to know.

I got a relatively inexpensive Honeywell keyboard from Midwest Micro
Peripherals.  People who have seen it have complained about the feel and about
the on-keyboard artificial "click" sound it generates (which I have turned on),
but it had the EXTREMELY important feature of being able to treat the key just
left of the "A" as CTRL, which feature I think I can attribute what little grip
on sanity I have left to. :-)

Glad I made the suggestion <grin>. Uh, I tried the little program, but no luck.
Maybe it's the window version I'm running (#30), but it does nothing. Actaully,
even from the command line a "display 1b 21 >/wx" just hangs things up until
ctrl-c is hit. Certainly doesn't switch windows.

This is not a big deal right now (but it would be nice for a little menu
program I'd writing so my kids can play games....). But yes, it should be avail
on the production model.

Bob - when you do the "display 1b21 >/wx", is there a shell on /wx?  Or another
program waiting on input?  Remember, the file manager locks out the device in
that case (shell++ got around that by waiting on a key signal instead...
another case where we need a new osk shell :-).

Mark, STERM needs to be pointed to the T2 device.  If T2 is already in your
loaded modules try STERM -1 /t2</1  which tells STERM to use /t2.  I had the
same problem and found the answer somewhere in the STERM documentation. Good
luck - Ches.

welp, I tried a 6' cable like Mark suggested, and it helpped, but now all I get
is a bunch of garbage... and things still go to sleep and never wake up again,
and they dont die when you try to kill them either... anybody got any really
great IDEAS? like witch xmode param's should be set to what? any Ideas on how
to get a program to let go of /p so I can try changeing xmode things and try
again? its a bit of a hassle to have to reboot to try something different... of
well

Ken.
