Mike,

I've been playing with Gifsho to view CompuServe Weather maps and am scratching
my head over the displayed size of the graphic.

With the recent change to the Maps area, I now can select a VGA resolution
(Item 1) and download a map as usual.

When I display with gifsho, I get a nice looking map ... but it's very narrow
and centered in the middle of my type 0 screen. Is this correct or should I
be using a different combination of screen type and resolution?

What follows is the output from a gifsho -i on a recently downloaded file:

GIF version '87a'
378 x 240 screen
Global bitmap : 16 colors
Image 378 by 240, Top 0, Left 0
Interleaved Image - 4 bits per pixel


Have any suggestions?

Steve

Steve,

It looks to me like the EGA and VGA maps are the same (I checked this out on my
PC at work as well as on my MM/1). Maybe they intend to provide better
resolution in the future. Gifshow has always (at least for me) displayed the
weather map as a narrow picture in the middle of the screen. It also won't
handle more than one file at a time without ending with an error. A command
like "gifshow current.gif tomorrow.gif 48hour.gif -s" displays the first map, a
few lines of the second map, then ends with the error: "illegal code in raster
data". Each of the maps displays just fine by itself.

Thanks for the input.  If the picture happens to be a different number of bits
per pixel, something doesn't get reset in my decoder.  I just have to track it
down. :(  I've got the same report from several sources and have run into the
problem myself.  Can't for the life of me figure this one out. <sigh>

Hopefully it will be something really simple I overlooked.

PS  If all the pictures are the same res (bits per pixel) then they will work
in slide show mode forever.

I wondered what caused it to happen, since I do know that the slide show works

I just grabbed a few maps and see what you mean.  The maps are in the old 87a
format and don't have an aspect ratio built into the file.

GIFShow thinks it's a clipping from a 640 x 240 screen and displays it on a 640
x 240 screen.  That's why it's long an narrow in the middle of the screen. 
Wonder why they picked such a weird size for the maps.  320 x 240 would fill
the entire screen as expected.  GIFShow makes a decision to center the picture
if it's greater than 368 pixels wide.  It's being displayed on a type 2 screen.
Have you run into many 378 x 240 GIFs before?  Maybe I need to up the deciding
width by 10, huh!

I've noticed that the weather maps are a strange size. Some of the viewers I've
used on other machines have similar problems trying to scale the picture to
match the screen, others seem to figure it out. Maybe the addition of the VGA
mode means they will start providing higher resolution, and standard sized,
pictures.

Mike,

I rarely spend much time with gif files. The two notable exceptions are the
weather maps and the stuff displayed over in the MQUOTE area.

The only problem with the financial stuff is they provide no way to capture the
display to a file, and only provide for decoding on the fly. I'm bashing Mark
to add such a feature to StermPro.

You have any ideas for work arounds with something like this (o wizzard of the
gif format!)  :-)

Only idea I have is to make gifshow force 16 color 378 pixels wide or less to
full screen.  But I've run into GIFs that are 370 x 240 and look perfect when
displayed like the weather maps are.  But I think they were all 256 colors.

I'll play with it.

With pause on in a window, I find that Lha pauses after about 6 extractions

I think that's because of the status display of 'o's moving across the screen.

Right,  the status line get's written thusly:

filename - ................

Then LHa writes a CR without a LF and writes the filename again,

filename - o...............
           ^
The cursor just stays at the current 'o' till the file is decoded, then
writes another CR, clears to 'o's and tells you it's been melted.

filename - Melted

So, you have 3 CR's for every file extracted.  So, It'll pause after
1/3 screen cause SCF has gotton a full screen of CR's.

Steve,

Why have pause turned on at all?  I know you might want people dialing it to
have pause enabled so you can set it on in the terminal descriptors, but you
can turn it off for all the window descriptors.  The 'more' utility is better
anyway since you can backup and just.  You might want to try using 'less' from
the TOPS distribution.  It has all that more has only more (or less). ( grin)

The magic required back in the days of V2.2 was as follows:
     char *argv [2];
     argv [0] = "-shell";
     argv [1] = NULL;
     os9exec(oskfork, 1 + argv [0], argv,...); This will do it.  When shell
sees the leading '-' on it's forked named (passed as it's argv[0]) it will read
the .login file.  Before the fork, you should already have chd'd to the
directory where .login is to be found.

If you are going to make a 'high end' video board it seems reasonable to want

>>Is 1 MB RAM enough for millions of colors at 1024 X 768? Yes, at 8 bits per
pixel 3/4+ meg is enough. All those colors come from the RAMDAC (palatte
controller) Just like the EK_VAX.

>>What about 1024 X 1024? Not on this board. That would require a very high

monitors come down we can quickly do a new board to match.

Thanks for you input on the sound. Space may be the big problem. A daughter
board strikes me as a cluge. I would rather do a separate sound board that
could do much more, like MIDI. That way it would not 'require' a particular
video board for use. Also it could be used in a terminal system.

Well, The EK-VAX has stereo support and should be somewhat better than what you
are used to. The separate board for sound etc has appeal to me as it would
allow upgrading video without having to rebuy sound capabilities. Video is a
fast moving area with prices dropping and capabilities increasing. Sound on the
other hand seems more stagnant. Once you have a good sound board you wouldn't
need to upgrade it. Not as often as video anyway.

Mark, about what you said... now that I've thought about it, you must have got
the very first hrecord/hplay - the buffering routine needing fine tuning.
Remember the presently SNDDRV only supports a max. of 30720 Hz and only
multiples supported by the timer.  If you use and adequate buffer size or
multiple for hiffplay/hiffrecord one should be able to use their system without
noticeable problems.  If your drive seeks sufficiently fast then smaller
buffers/multiples are ok, else use larger buffers.  I've recored up to 15
minutes while working on mplay and compiling.  I'm only using a ST296N 1.1
meg/sec, 15 minutes at 20KHz Stereo for 36meg of monophonic sound.

I suggest you download the newer hrecpla.lzh fron dl12.  I will be releasing
the functions I've developed for sound recording as shareware perhaps?  Or
maybe I should just sell them.  I'm getting quite a library... YES I'm going to
have to write docs, just so I can live/work with myself! %-)

Also, I thought in the quick help I had the correct command line arg setup
documented.  Try... hrecord -f=<freq> -b=<size> -s=<seconds> you can optionally
omit the equal though I support both.  All Version 1.01 of the utilites has
this corrected!

Try the newer stuff out and let me know how it works with slower drives,
espically using larger buffers.

When can I expect to see a version of Desktop that opens a text file in the

I'll do the attr utility for you, just have it call 'attr' and not open any
screens or other windows.  Attr will run in an overlay.  Still working on the
'gpr' utility for you.  Printing is worked at so it runs in the background.  I
could set it up so it would call the printing utility of the users choice in
case someone has one they like better.  What do you think?  Of course, they
could just rename their favorite printing utility to 'print' and it would work
as long as it would take a parameter for the filename and.....naw, too many
other options that it would get passed.  Forget it (grin).

opens the file into the program specified by the environment variable EDITOR.

Or would it make more sense the other way around?

The Attr utils sounds neat.  How about gattr to differentiate from the regular

        OPEN infers examination .. so fire up the editor and let's take a peek.


But!

I think Mark's original suggestion is the most elegant. If the execute bit is
set, we can presume it to be something that needs to execute ... shell script
or application. If it's a read only thing ... then let's fire up the editor and
examine the contents.

If I, as the operator, need to modify an exisiting shell script, I'd select the
file, use 'gattr' and turn off the execute bit(s), then double click the icon
to bring it up in the editor.

Of course I'm a user (unable user, to use a Delphi term, sheesh!), so what
appears to be a no brainer to me may be unobtainable programatically.

What do you think?

Mike,

What you might want to do is make up a separate icon for a shell script and put
that up when you see a text file that has the execution bit set. Of course,
this may make things more dofficult.  I don't know how you are doing it now,
I'd guess you look for any file with the execution bit set and make that a
program and then anything else is a text file.

I've been playing with Open Look version 3 on one of the Sun workstations at
work.  It has a different icon for each file.  It must read each and every file
to do this thought since it can tell the difference between a "C" source code
file and a header file, as well as a postscript file and a normal text file. 
Pretty slick!  Each icon type then gets a different set of parameters for
forking and printing.  I don't think this will be easy to do for OSK, if at
all, but it sure would be nice!

To answer your question, like Steve said, if it has the execution bit set, and
the first few bytes in the file are not a module header, then make it a shell
script, other wise it is a text file.  If you double click on a text file, run
the editor given in the EDITOR environ variable, or run thhe script if it is
not a text file.

 You can do this under OSK.  G-WINDOWS has this feature.  The file icon
 shows the name of the file and what type it is; i.e., "C", "ASM", "PROG",
 "SUBR", "SYS", etc.  Since there will be files G-WINDOWS doesn't recognize,
 you can write your own file recognizer program and add the info to the
 'config' file.  Sample source code for a file recognizer program is included.

 Have at it <g>.

On the gpr util.  Should that be brought up by selecting Printer Device? and
print be brought up by chooseing print on the files menu?

Strike that first option, the name should probably be changed to Printer on the
deskmenu.

Mike,

Call 'gpr' when you select "print

errrrrr.....opps...

Call "gpr" when you select "print" after clicking on a file.  I'll try to do
some fancy work and determine if the file is a printable file or a binary file
and then exit with an error message if it is binary.

Setting up the printer port should be a separate utility, like the "port" util
in Multi-Vue.  All the printing utility will do is allow the user to select
some page layout defaults like margins, headers, and such and then call the
printing routine passing these settings as command line parameters.  The "port"
utility should allow the user to setup the device descriptor a la
xmode.....turn on/off linefeed, set the printer device, and so forth.  The
"port" utility should be smart enough to change the fields shown depending upon
if it is a serial or paralle port being configured.

What do you think?

KiX\30 Update 10/16/92

FLASH!

The first KiX\30 production board was shipped today! One day, just ONE day
behind schedule! We are now in full production with orders being filled within
2-3 weeks.

The EK-4S2P is now in production with first shipment expected within a week.


In other news...

The original specs called for all SIMMs to be the same type. Both banks had to
be the same. This is no longer true. You can now mix memory types. For example
you could have 4 one meg SIMMs and 4 four meg SIMMs. In addition you can now
use 512K and 2 Meg SIMMs. It is even possible to mix SIMMs within a block. The
block will then take on the size of the smallest SIMM. If you have 2 one meg
SIMMs and 2 four meg SIMMs you will have 4 meg total.

See the full descriptions of the KiX\30 in the databases 'DL15'.

Thank You

Thanks, Mike.  Just read a message from him in mail.  He told me about the
articles.  I'll check them out.
  It was great getting to meet you in Atlanta.  Had a really good time.
