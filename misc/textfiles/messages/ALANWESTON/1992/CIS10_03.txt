Frank finally uploaded to me the newest version of the sc2661 driver and the

Wondering if I could ask a TC70 owner, with the current, correct, modules, to

Hi Mike... I've got a small problem with UBox. I'm trying to transfer all my
old Umuse sequences over to Cakewalk on my MSDOG box via MIDI. Ubox isn't
sending out MIDI sync codes (or at least isn't sending song-start or whatever
it is). It did work once or twice a long time ago when I first got UBox, but it
didn't work consistently. One boot-up it would work, then the next it wouldn't.
Without MIDI sync, I get a sequence in Cakewalk that I can't do anything with -
timing is too far out of whack to edit - quantizing just screws it up worse.
Any ideas why UBox doesn't work for me? I've got a lot of work tied up in some
of those sequences - need to get them transferred! Thanks in advance...

 Could it be that you're using a foreign (non-stock) version of XMODE?
 The IDENT on my XMODE command is:

 Header for:  Xmode
 Module size: $03B1    #945
 Module CRC:  $865DE1 (Good)

 Prog mod, 6809 obj, re-en, R/O

 I'm not sure if this module is 100% stock, but
 entering the following command--

 OS9[W4]:xmode /w1

 gives the following results on my system--

 just not through /t1 (which is where zmodem is required to operate).

Steve,

Yes, I think those prices are outrageous. Even on mainframe software, the high
priced manuals are only about $30 or $40 apiece. I really am beginning to think
that Microware is out to rip all of us off. It has taken years to get them to
agree to reduce prices on OS9 itself, but to charge those kind of prices for
two relatively small (and incomplete) manuals is highway robbery. Hey, maybe I
can get the state of Florida price gouging group they've set up AA (after
Andrew) to challenge the price! ;-)

 Bill,

 Aren't you being a little rough on MW?  I'm not defending their position
 necessarily, (I have many beefs) but it is important to understand how they
 work.

 MW's primary customers are OEMs.  They have set-up a few dealers (I'm one)
 and they will, reluctantly, deal with the end user.  Because of the wide
 variety of hardware and the market base each OEM targets, MW believes the
 OEM knows his hardware and market better than they do.  Therefore, they
 leave it to the OEM to decide what modules and documentation his customers
 will require and to provide primary support.  The per copy license fee is
 negotiated accordingly.

 Apparantly, your OEM decided he needed only a limited number of copies of
 the documentation for his market.  From the queries I've received, he
 apparantly erred on the low side.  He is either unwilling or unable (because
 of the terms of his contract) to order additional manuals.

 ---- Part 2

 When I contacted MW re obtaining manuals, they did agree to a slight increase
 in the discount to me to allow a slightly lower end user price.  They are
 aware of the price I am offering.  However, to get this additional discount,
 I must order in multiples of 10.  Note, I don't need these for my customers
 (SYSTEM IV).  Professional OS-9 Manuals from MW are included.

 You say the manuals are small and incomplete.  I don't understand that
 statement.  My guess is that the manuals comprise about 1000 pages (I
 haven't counted them).  Sections include a complete technical explanation
 of the OS, an explanation of the commands, the C-Compiler, the RMA and
 the debugger.  I'm not aware of any other OS that includes all this infor-
 mation at this price.  No, there is no tutorial.  It is a technical reference
 manual.  If you need to learn OS-9, Microware does provide courses through-out
 the country at various times for various levels of knowledge and needs.

 I often have to purchase 'programmers' manuals for various terminals just
 to get information for termcap entries.  These vary in price from $30 to
 $60 with most being around $50.  The exception is the VT series from DEC -
 they want $135 per manual.  Now, that is a rip-off.  By the way, most of
 these manuals are 100 pages or less.

 -----  Part 3

 When I first took on the SYSTEM IV, I contacted AT&T re porting UNIX to
 the SYSTEM IV.  My cost for manuals, if I had gotten a license, would have
 been $200 per set and that didn't include the C-Compiler or the assembler.
 SCO gets a similar price for their manuals; again, with the same limitations.

 I'm not trying to defend any of MW's practices - rather, I'm trying to put
 them in perspective with regard to comparable OSs I'm familiar with.  Your
 complaint, if any, should not be with MW (or me) but rather with the provider
 of your equipment - he is responsible to see that you have the necessary
 information for your system in accordance with the terms of your purchase
 agreement.

 BTW, is your hardware provider offering you 'Ultra-C'?.  MW is offering
 the upgrade for $500.00.  You must prove you are a legitimate owner of
 Professional OS-9 and/or the C-Compiler and the offer expires the end
 of this month.  Alternatively, most OEM's are offering the upgrade to
 their customers at a price lower than MWs.  Customers of DELMAR CO and
 Peripheral Technology will be able to get the upgrade for $200 - not
 much over cost.  All of the OEM offers will probably expire the end of
 this month, also.

Ed,

Yes, I guess I was a little rough, I have to admit that I considered going back
and deleting that message after I had left it.

I was _not_ defending "my OEM", in fact I got my set of manuals before I got my
machine! I don't know why IMS decided not to obtain more manuals, but I suspect
(but I really do not know) that its because MW wanted to charge an obscene
amount of money for them.

As far as my reference to small and incomplete, I was referring to a lack of
detailed technical information, rather than tutorials, but it came across as
more critical than I intended. I do think the manuals are not too well
organized, but there is a lot of information there for the middle of the road
user. Not enough for the beginner, or the highly technical user, but still a
lot of good information.

My beef is not with MW alone. We constantly battle with software vendors at
work about high prices for manuals, and in most cases we win, though its
usually a tough fight. I did not mean to single out MW in this case, but was
annoyed at the high price of the OS9 manual set, I still think its a rip off to
charge such high prices for manuals.

As I have already stated, I have no complaint with anyone, MW, IMS and
especially not with you.

I have not heard if IMS has made any arrangements about Ultra-C, and quite
frankly, I don't care. I am happy with the GNU C compiler. Why should I pay MW
for something I can get for free? Ultra-C may be a good package, but I can't
justify spending even as "little" as $200 for it. (You just had to toss that
"ad" in there, didn't you! ;-)

 Jim,

 The 'import_gif' program originally provided by Steve Adams handled only
 the older 'gif' format.  He has upgraded it to handle the newer 'gif'
 formats.  Contact your G-WINDOWS supplier for the upgraded copy.

What does "(E.g, the profit margin on)" mean, Paul??

If you promised Glen the Manuals with his purchase, then you have a legal and
moral obligation to provide them to him NOW, not 6 months or so from now when
you get the manuals written.

WEven if your purchase of the manuals from MW cost you $150+, and you loose
EVERY DIME you make off of Glen, you MUST provide him with the manuals YOU
promised him.

If not, he has every right to 1)demand a refund from IMS for the full purchase
price, or 2)to file suit against IMS for a broken contract.

Cut the cr** and get him his manuals!!

Sb: #Chart for OSK
Fm: Jim Sutemeier 70673,1754
To: all

Got a question for all you OSK guys out here in CIS land....

I am CONSIDERING stocking a chart here at my little company, that will give all
the instruction sets for the 68000 (and, therefore, for the 68070, too),
including flags, cycle times (not app. to 68070), registers, exception vectors,
supervisor & user state modes, pinouts, and much more.  (excludes hex opcodes).

If I were to stock such a chart (an 8-1/2 x 11 laminated double sided chart),
would such a chart be usable by you guys who program in machine code, and,
therefore, be a salable product for my company??

These cards are relatively cheap, but I don't want to carry them unless there
is an interest in them.

Please advise.....

Thanks.

Hi Jim... I'm interested in the chart. Would save looking up little things in
the book all the time. Where do I send my money?

Glen:  I'm getting a 'sample' from my supplier late next week.  IF it looks as
good as the C Chart (that I currently distribute), then I'll order some of the
68000 charts, and place a notice in Hot Topics here.

Thanks for your reply, Glen, all I needed to know was IF there were SOME
interest.  You've given me that assurance.

I am writing a program in C that reads and writes through the serial ports. I
am using Professional OSK v2.2 and trying to use _gs_rdy() to see is there is
any data to be read (I have a version that does just a read, but I don't want
the program to wait for something that might never come).  My problem is when I
call _gs_rdy(path)  (where path is the return value from open()) it returns -1
with an Error #216 (from errno).  Am I on the wrong track?  Is there another,
better way to communicate through the serial ports than just doing an open on
/t1?  (I am opening with S_IREAD+S_IWRITE). Any help or comments would be
greatly appreciated. David George

Perhaps a code segment would be best... upload a chunk and we'll look at it. 
You _are_ on the right track.

Lee: Thanks for the number. Yes, it works. I ordered the data sheet and it is
hopefully on its way.

Mark: I do hope I get the data sheet quicker than you did. I just want to see
how the Daylight saving time flags are set in the chip (and I guess in the
clock driver too). Seems that this beastie knows all about DST. But in this
little valley where I live, we don't. We are on the boundry between MST and PST
and rather than change our watches, we just hire a guy to more the sign
advising travellers to change their watches from one end of the valley to the
other.

So, I'd like to unset the flag in my clock so that I don't have to redo the
time every six months -- not a big deal, but fun.

BTW, I asked Motorola for their RTC data sheet, but they were out of stock. (I
called them first since they have an 800 number...) They did have some in Hong
Kong and Holland, and promised to order one from there and mail it to me when
it arrived. Wonder how long that'll be?
