size of uploads--> Mike, the cmds for the C++ Compiler take up 690,000 bytes
(compressed).   (The main module for this compiler is 849,000 bytes,
uncompressed!)

I had also intended on uploading a GCC compiler, which is ANSI compatible.  It
is smaller in size than the C++ Compiler, should only be about 750-800,000
bytes total for that set.

When I started the uploading, wasn't aware that there were any space probs here
on CI$.

I'll try to get the C++ cmds in now, please advise me on the ANSI compiler.

Thanks.

Jim,

I've made a little bit more space available, so if you run into problems again,
please let us know.

There aren't really any space problems here on CompuServe..... just a problem

Kevin, I recently started using STERM and began to experience lockups that Mark
Griffith thinks may be due to lost IRQs.  He urges me to install the IRQ hack
so I looked in the files and found the Lyall hack and the diode hack. 
Apparently both are intended to tie the IRQ from the RS232 pak to the IRQ input
on the 6809.  What is the problem with the original design? It looks like a
multiplexer should be sending the IRQs through, so is the problem that the
multiplexer misses IRQs under certain conditions?  On the diode hack, what is
intended by the direction to tie the #8 ports together? Tie all pin 8s on the
pak sockets together?  What about tying the combined #8s to the #8 plug to the
CoCo?  In other words, is the diode hack intended to bypass the multiplexer by
the "brutal" method of shorting the four inputs to the single output?  In the
diode hack, is it necessary that the diode be germanium?  Is the input that
sensitive that the .4 volt difference between germanium and silicon diodes is
important?  Thanks for your help. Regards, Ches.

Hi Ches!

Background:  the GIME's external IRQ input is edge-sensitive, instead of
level-sensitive... meaning yes, interrupts can be lost (or ignored).  It seems
that the GIME design was changed to this method towards the end, but the
updated info slipped through the cracks... L-II still expected otherwise.

The other needed background is that the MPI only allows one slot to pass
interrupts at a time (this is left over from the ROMPAK startup days).

So, right, the basic idea of all the "IRQ Hacks" is to bypass the GIME and/or
the MPI irq-slot selection.  (There are also software hacks to bypass the GIME,
and many aftermarket drivers do that, but...).

MPI: You only need the MPI hack (pins 8 tied together) if you have more than
one device out there which uses interrupts.  So, for example, if you only have
one such device (the RS232 pak), then no problem.  If you have more (a couple
of RS232 paks, or a pak plus a no-halt controller, or etc), then you clearly
have to bypass the MPI selector.

GIME: Some people simply bypass it all together, and run all the external IRQs
straight to the 6809 (you should see my lazy computer mess, btw: my SC-II irqs
come thru my stock MPI, and so I have an external wire running to the cpu from
my PBJ dual rs232 pak - ugh).  Anyway, the diode hack takes any interrupts that
can get out the MPI (modified or not) and bypasses the GIME.  The diode part is
so that old ROMPAKs can also be used.  I believe that it does have to be
germanium, from what people have found.  Of course, if you do the MPI hack, I'm
not sure the diode hack (vs just using a jumper) makes sense.

Clear as mud? :-)  Basically, the MPI is a SP4T switch... tieing pins 8 bypass
it.  The GIME is a latching doorbell... so you sometimes can't tell how many
people are pushing it.  - kevin

OK, Kev.  I've put in the diode hack as follows:  tied the rom-pak-socket ends
of r11, r12, r13, r14 together in the MPI, and put in a 1n34 between the IRQ
end of r2 and pin 8 of the rom-pak-plug of the CoCoIII.  One attempt of a
download using STERM on a 180K file in the non-sliding-window mode of B+
protocol worked without a flaw.  Trying the sliding window mode seems not to
work - first and second blocks come thru head to tail, then there's a long wait
followed by 3 and 4 then a long wait (perhaps as much as a minute) then 5 & 6,
etc.  Should I have also tied the #8 pin of the MPI to the 4 resistor ends? 
Tried a silicon diode without success, btw. Comments??  Ches.

Ches - I'll have to look up the schematics, but it sounds right.

The STerm thing may simply be because of the smaller serial input buffers on
the coco... they could be overrun and it takes a while for CIS to notice the
reported error and resend and slow down because it knows things aren't going so
hot, etc.

Perhaps someone else can confirm (or deny :) this. - kev

Take a peek at PAKMOD.TXT and PAKMOD.SRC in LIB 10 if you're still using the
stock stuff from Tandy. That will get you a couple of more extra bytes.

You might also want to look at Bruces Isted's SACIA stuff. I believe it allows

I haven't gotten much further than to start listing out the defs files, myself.

But, 'cause I ALWAYS try something out before reading the dox (grin), I simply
HAD to run a test comparison between the MW Compiler and this GNU C++ Compiler,
as it will 'try to imitate traditional C'.

I compiled a program of 27,375 bytes first with the MW compiler...it took 2:14
minutes, final outfile was 23,428 bytes.

Using GNU 1.40, it took 2:21 minutes, and, using the -O (for optimizer) option,
the final outfile was 22,806 bytes.

That really impressed the heck out of me.  Over 600 bytes optimized out, on a
compiler that says it will "TRY" to compile it.

Now, I gotta go buy some books on C++, so I can start to learn that
implementation of C.

Have fun!

dox files for C Compiler--> Bob, I uploaded two different compilers from GNU,
the ANSI C Compiler and the C++ C Compiler.  The ANSI C Compiler is complete
and intact, just as it sits (all dox and cmds are in the same archive.)  The
C++ Compiler, on the other hand, are so extensive (and VERY long) that I left
those in idividual archives in the database.

So, the DOX 1 & 2 belong to the C++ Compiler, as does the lfiles, defs, and gnu
cmds.

I haven't decided if I want to tackle C++ myself.....yet.....but I LIKE the
option of being able to do so if I want to.

Take care.

RMA and RLINK come on the DEVELOPERS PAK disks. Technically, you could use a

Then you would of course also have to rename the files to the same names.

Optionally, you could get the developers pak.

floppies (in COCO OS-9 format). Then I hope either you or John Kelly will (or
both of you together) establish a means of distributing this information with
the rest of the OS-9 community in Australia. With the number of systems in
Australia already picking up the Fido COCO and OS9 echos, those of us are

Thanks for your guidance, Kevin.  After the IRQ diode hack and using a ramdisk,
downloading appears to be pause free between packets.  BTW, I had to go out to
buy some 1N34s (never thought I'd run out of those) and found 1N93s (germanium
power diodes), as well as silicon diodes, don't let the IRQ diode hack work. 
Still uncertain about the original MPI design flaw.  Edge detection ? - another
way of saying the multiplexing of IRQs is just too slow in the original design?
or is it really using the pulse created by differentiating the square wave
level change?  Or is the multiplexing losing an IRQ in the times when the
multiplexor is looking at other IRQ sources?  And is there a bad side effect of
strapping all the PAK IRQs together so that identification of which IRQ is from
which PAK is lost?  Anyway, thanks for the encouragement and guidance; STERM is
now working at full speed on my system.  Regards, Ches.

This question should take a few of you back a bit in time. I have recently
taken out and dusted off my copy of Deskmake 3, and put it on a real disk with
Vdgint, etc. It's not very sophisticated in some ways, but is perfectly suited
to the needs of a beginner who uses my CoCo 3 from time to time.

Now, for reasons unknown, the mouse/joystick will not move the pointer all the
way to the right side, nor to the bottom, of the screen. Normally this is not
too much of a problem, but with PAINT it seriously limits the type of drawing
you can do. I checked the joystick and it indeed covers the normal 0-63 range
horizontally and vertically just fine. Has anyone run into this and found a
solution?

Secondly, what in Deskmate 3 binds it to /term? It won't run from another VDG
screen. Not a serious problem, but I do like to use it concurrently with other
tasks and prefer to come up in 80 column mode.

Finally, why do most of the modules show up as non-shr in an ident? Does this
really mean that they are not reentrant, ie. I can't run two Deskmates at once
(provided that they could work from other than /term, of course)?

Ian,

Get DESK3.SCR in Lib 10.  It's a modpatch script to make DM3 use the hires
mouse, and run from any vdg screen (not just /TERM).

For that matter, do a "bro /key:desk*" in Lib 10.  There are some interesting
files and mods there.

I have no idea if more than one DM3 can be run at a time.  But heck, change
them all to shareable and try it <grin>.  Luck!

Kevin,

I got DESK3.SCR from lib 10 and it worked out just fine. Thanks for the tip.
One odd thing, though. The hires mouse works now, but unlike its very smooth
movement with MultiVue, with Deskmate the movement is jerky and erratic and
difficult to control. Any idea why there shoul be that difference?

Come to think of it, just where is the driver for the hires mouse? I have no
idea how it works, though I suspect there is a digital ramp generator
controlled by software somewhere; 8 bits, I would guess. Given OS9's modularity
I would have expected a device driver and descriptor for the mouse, but that
isn't the case, so where does it hide?

Ian,

Hmm. Deskmate must sleep a lot between reading mouse/joystick (like CoCo Artist
did).  Would have to track it down.

The hires mouse driver is in CC3IO.  You're right: it tells the hires interface
to begin charging a capacitor... and the driver shuts off interrupts and counts
in software until ramp meets the joystick position.  If the mouse is in the
lower right corner, this can mean irqs are disabled for a very long time (I
think up to 10ms or maybe more).  Therefore, when doing nothing else, it's best
to move the mouse to the upper-left corner where the delay is negligible.

Or Ian could now install Bruce Isted's serial mouse support (in MOUSE.AR). I'm
using a Logitech mouse on one of my CoCo3s and an Impression Mouse (which is a
Microsoft-compatible) on another.  The problem of loosing IRQs during mouse
movements goes away when the serial mouse is used instead of the Hi-Res
adaptor.
         I have no IRQ hacks on either of my systems, but now have the freedom
of using GSHELL+ or any other mouse-driven software while doing uploads or
downloads from BBSs or other services.  I have had NO lock-ups due to IRQs that
were lost due to mouse operations since installing Bruce's Serial Mouse
Drivers.

Incidentally, I use multi-port seral cards on both of my systems, so I'm able
to run multiple serial applications simultaneously and the mouse drivers, too.

 For example, I have a line on the screen "[JThe OS-9 Forum;70HCompose"
Finally, the B protocol worked fine for one dowload, and then every
 thing locked up. I originally used OSTERM 2.08 for CIS. Do I have to change

Sounds like a couple of problems cooking.

First, the weird characters are probabbly VIDTEX control codes. GO DEFAULT and
set your terminal to OTHER or DUMBCRT. THat should fix that.

Loosing characters is indicative of an IRQ problem. Have you installed the IRQ
hack as described in in LIB 10? BROwse IRQ* and see what pops up.

There are two ways of doing this ... the diode hack and the original method as
told by Pete Lyall. I perfer the later.

A third alternative would be to replace your ACIAPAK drivers with Bruce Isted's
SACIA package. It fixes in software the problem that causes the missing
interupts.

welp, another stupid question bout my MM/1,  I've tried Mike K.'s recplays
program, works fine, sept when I plug in my stereo to the audio in of the MM/1,
the MM/1 is grounding out my stereo, whitch makes the recordings sound like
crap... I tested the cable and its not shorted, also all the wires are going to
the right place (that tends to help)... so just for kicks I measured the
resistance between the audio in signal pin, and the audio in ground... both
channels were about 620 ohms... since they were both about the same, I dont
think anything is fried or anything like that... but only 620 ohms? shouldn't
it be more? thats a real load for my amp, and it cant take it... is that normal
though?  would puting a op amp betwwen the stereo amp and the MM/1 (with an Av
of 1) help? them little suckers have a high Z in...(or hay, even an Av of
100,000... amplify the **** outa it :-) oh well, anyone got any Ideas?

If it helps, I think R2 and R6 back by the connector are the resistors to
ground on the sound input (600 ohms each).  R1 and R5 (100 ohms) are in series,

I have read carefully the ocnn.0192 file which I obtained from Delphi.  (Even
printed out a hard copy on my printer so I could read it more carefully).

At first read through of the by-laws of the organization, I thought (still do)
that the organization appears to be well set up, and most every detail has been
well covered.  Whoever wrote these by-laws should be congratulated on a job
well done.

A couple of points stick in my mind, however, after having read this 'edition'
of the NetNews.

Why were there no other "Portions" mentioned in 17B?  Is this because the OS9CN
is going to be strictly a domain of FidoNet and RiBBS?  I know for a fact that
none of the StG SysOp's were contacted about their BBS being part of the OS9CN,
and I suspect that none of the AcBBS BBS's were, either.  While RiBBS is the
'biggie' of the networking CoCo BBS's at this time, asking AcBBS and StG BBS's
to join into the OS9CN would net an additional 30 (or so) BBS's, thus giving
the OS9CN a wider potential user base.

The point here is that the more people, networks, etc., you contact and set up,
the more 'dominant' you become.  RiBBS/FidoNet are not the entire world of OS9,
there is UseNet, and the other OS9 BBS's that network that should be contacted.

If you feel I am being a little 'touchy' on this apparent OS9CN/RiBBS tie-in,
might I call you attention to the fact that the NetNews I have just read
contains the laws and by-laws of the organization, followed immediately by an
apparently complete listing of RiBBS Systems.  By attaching that listing to the
'official rules and regulations' ANY user would say that RiBBS and OS9CN are
connected to each other.

Sorry if we gave you that impression, but actually the opposite is the case.
One example is that I came here regularly to exchange information on behalf of
the OS-9 Community Network. We are also brainstorming ways to regularly
exchange information with those on other networks such as Internet, Usenet,
UUCP, Stgnet, Rime, ACBBS network, and there are most likely others. What we
need is volunteers to help us brainstorm how to make these gateways come about.
For example, MS-DOS systems are capable of handing both Fidonet mail and UUCP
mail, as well as other networks. So if we took advantage of those OS-9 fans
that run BBS systems on MS-DOS systems, we could make this exchange of
information automatic. We do have a few volunteers that are sending information
for us to some of the other popular networks. But we do not want The OS-9
Community Network to be based only in Fidonet, as there are members of the OS-9
Community on almost any network. For those of us that use OS-9 on the COCO,
using RiBBS and Fidonet is the most feasible and economical way to go (for most
of us), and Australian OS-9 users have already joined us on Fidonet. If someone
will offer ideas of better ways to do it, or ideas on gatewaying, we are all
ears!

By the way, StG and ACBBS members have both been contacted long before you left

author would attempt a port to Fidonet. I have yet to get a response from
Carmen Izzi, but have gotten responses from users of ACBBS echo areas. It is

YES!!!!!!

Just compiled C Kermit 5A on my MM/1.  (I hasten to add that ALL I did was
tweak a makefile a couple of times--Chris Hemsing in Germany and Bob Larson,
with whom folks who have been here for a while should be familiar, did all the
work.)

I'm using it now.  I am having NONE of the problems I had with version 4F
talking to the modem.  I've yet to try to transfer any files, but I'll let you
know how it comes out.

C Kermit 5A has LOTS of bells and whistles: sliding windows (say, is CIS going
to do sliding window Kermit for up/downloads?), long packets, attribute packets
(a truly Great Thing, because it lets Kermit pre-allocate space for incoming
files!!!), an extensive scripting language, the whole nine yards.

possible to twist knobs at make time to just get the pieces you want.

More news as it happens.  This is the beta version, so I don't quite feel
comfortable about uploading it.  Instead, I'll send off the makefile tweaks to
Kermit Central (at Columbia U), and I expect the official 5A version should be
uploaded here.  (I'll do it if nothing else.)

Hold onto your hats, folks!  Several days ago, someone on Usenet asked if there
were any faster/better replacements for the 6809.  A student from Japan replied
that there had been an article years ago about new modes in the Hitachi 6309...
and he also said he had tried many of them himself.

After exams, he's going to post more info.  If this pans out, someone may have
to locate a good source of 63C09E's :-)   In any case, these are some supposed
features he has mentioned...

 1. More registers (additional two 8 bit accumulators, 8 bit
     register, and a 16bit register),
 2. Two modes (6809 emulation mode and native mode),
 3. Reduced execution cycles in native mode,
 4. More instructions (16 bit x 16 bit multiplication, 32 bit / 16 bit
    division, inter-registers operationa, block transfer, bit
    manipulating operation which is compatible with what 6801 has, etc)
 5. Error trap by illegal instruction, zero division.

Some of this jibes with rumors I've heard previously.  So keep your fingers
crossed... this could be the fun scoop of the decade for 6809 fans!

Well...if there are extra registers, you need to be vewy, vewy caweful (as

right, I fear that the process descriptor would have to be modified and that
the kernel would have to save any extra registers at context switch time.

That might make for an interesting project, were there people with skill and

Well, judging from your messages on the BITNET CoCo list, you have already
started playing around with it on your system.  While I can understand the
exitement this causes you, you can see by reading the BITNET messages that
there are a number of people having trouble with the earlier versions of the
window driver and the differences between them.  Getting a stable version out
to everyone is extremely important.

Paul Ward mentioned here last Monday that your window driver would be uploaded

Kevin,

The source that I found for HD6309 microprocessors is:

Marshall Electronics 2045 Chenault Dr. Carrollton, Tx  75006

(214) 233-5200

I called them yesterday (Thursday), and the guy that I talked to said that they
did in fact carry them, but were currently out of stock.  However, he added
that it looked like a new supply was coming in in a couple of weeks.

I guess if you wanted to order a few, then you'd just be backordered for a
little bit.

I went over there today and picked up a data book that includes most, if not
all, of Hitachi's 8/16 bit microprocessors.  The book's in the car now, but I
seem to remember that there were 6301s through 6809s (which includes the 63B09,
63C09, 63B09E and 63C09E microprocessors).  And Hirotsugu was right on in his
"Secret Feature Memo", the new features are not documented in the data book. 
It looks like they just took the MC6809 specs and retitled the document for the
6309.  I'm going to call Hitachi America to see if they now have official (or
at least "semi-official) specs written for the heretofore secret 6309 features.

The data book that I got today also included some MC68000 counterparts, too.

I wonder of some of them have "secret" features, too, that could blow the doors
off stock 68000 operations.   Hmmmm....

Just thought of something the other day: with the 6309 in native mode, wouldn't
the layout of the register packet (see Technical Manual, page 6-15) have to
change?  Maybe not; guess it depends on how that's saved.

Right... the register packet would have to change, which could be critical to
some drivers (and of course, the kernel and file managers).

A simple way around that would be to have the interrupt kernel code move the W
register someplace else, and also diddle with signal intercept routines, but
it'll take some thinking on what is the best method (whole hog or hack?) to
handle things.

Another note is this: if I recall correctly, Basic09 *cheats* in its intercept
routine, and looks for the DP reg on the intercept stack.  That'll have to be
patched as well.

With software, anything your hardware can handle is possible.  However,
supporting the hi-res 'stick requires that special analog pulses be generated
through the cassette port and requires the co-ordinates for hi-res be handled. 
So you can change joystick support from lo-res to hi-res but about the only
viable method is disassembly, changing of the source, and reassembly.  No
simple patch can do it.

You might instead look into the hi- / lo- res joystick adapter that will let
you switch between modes without all the plugging and unplugging.

I disagree slightly with Erich because very simple patches are all that's
required to make Deskmate/3 use the Hi-Res Adaptor instead of the stock Lo-Res
ports.  It would probably require a disassembly to figure where to patch the
Hi-Res Mouse Call in, but unless the logic in Carmen is extremely convoluted,
then I think it'd be quite possible to effect the change.

prompts might be different. I suggest you capture the logon stuff to a file and
compare the prompts to what PHONE is expecting. I use this prog. all the time,

I'm not sure if what I'm trying to do is possible, but it should be <grin>.
Maybe someone with a bit more C-knowledge can help... I want to get the size of
one element of a structure. Problem is that I don't have an actual structure to
work on, just a pointer or typedef.

Assuming

  typedef struct{
     char a1[40];
     int  i1[10];
  }foo;

What I'd like to do is this:

  int t=sizeof(foo.a1);

Which should set t==40. I just get an error. I tried it without the typedef and
used sizeof(struct foo.a1) but got the same problem.

If you actually create storage, things work fine:

  foo dummy;
  int t=dummy.a1;

I've worked around this by using  #define ASIZE 40 and then using this to set
the size in the struct. But there should be a way to do it my way! Any ideas?

Maybe there should be, but there isn't.  Look again at the permissible operands
of sizeof: you can either have an expression, or a type.  foo.a1 is neither.

The nearest you can come to what you want is to use yet another typedef for the
type of the structure member; then you can hand sizeof *that* type.

To: All

I have a question about Sterm on the CoCo. I have just, for what seems like
about the thousandth time, accidentally dumped myself out of Compuserve by
hitting the BREAK key, without thinking, to abort an Sterm operation (in this
case opening a capture file). Now, BREAK is a good way to abort most operations
within CIS, but to have the same key, under slightly different circumstances,
abort Sterm itself is ... shall I say counterproductive (5 minutes ago I used a
much stronger word).

I don't have the source, but even if I did I don't understand C well enough to
track it down. Does this bother anyone else? If so, how much of a change is
involved to fix it? I have an uncomfortable feeling that the BREAK is being
handled by Shell rather than Sterm, but am certainly not sure. Suggestions?

Also, does anyone know how long it takes CIS to recognize that I have suddenly
disconnected and stop the meter running? (Actually, with the new flat rate I am
no longer even sure when the meter _does_ run, but that's another story).

Bob, Steve,

     OK, try this: while in Sterm, hit escape C to open a capture file. When
Sterm asks for a filename, hit BREAK. Unless my version 1.5 is different from
yours, you will find yourself immediately back at a shell prompt, and no longer
in Sterm or connected to Compuserve.

     This happens to me when I hit esc-C by mistake, perhaps intending to hit
esc-T or something else. My knee-jerk reaction is to hit BREAK to abort. Well,
it aborts, all right ...

     Let me know if you have the same result.

Oh, that was neat (and expensive)... When I was dumped back to OS9 I went off
to another window and composed my reply. When done (about 4 or 5 minutes later)
I loaded Sterm again and tried to get the attention of my modem. Rather to my
surprise, I found that I was still in the OS9 forum! Even though Sterm
disappeared, my modem and CIS were apparently happily conversing during the
interim. Good thing I didn't decide to do some long computing task that took

Steve,

I have just been on the phone with Bob van der Poel and have this Sterm thing
more or less sorted out. First, there is no problem with Sterm 1.3, only with
1.5.1. With 1.3 if I hit BREAK it just tells me that there is no filename, with
1.5.1 it dumps me out.

Now the cure; since I call Sterm with a procedure file (I can't remember all
the darned parameters) I just added to the procedure file:

     tmode quit=0

and this effectively disables the BREAK key for the duration.

Ian,

The problem with Sterm breaking out when you are prompted for a filename is due
to setting the screen parameters back normal (meaning turning on break again)
to allow SCF to echo charcters and allow command line editing while inputting
the filename.  The actual code has not changed from several versions back.

What I need to do is change things around so the echoing an editing features of
SCF can still be used, but the break and abort signals are still disabled.
Thanks for finding this.

I have a problem related to MultiVue and STERM.  I can use STERM with no
problems if I don't use MV (the OS9Boot modules include VDGInt in both cases,
but the MV bootfile uses WindInt and the other boot uses GrfInt). In my use of
STERM, it appears that a ramdisk must be used for B+ file downloads to be
successful since (apparently) my hard disk is too slow and causes lockups. If I
start a ramdisk and then try to use STERM, OS9 tells me it can't load T2.  If I
deiniz R0, STERM runs fine.  Running the boot without MV, the ramdisk and STERM
work fine together.  Any ideas?  Ches.

It is possible that your hard disk is too slow.  I would recommend you download
to RAMdisk then immediately copy the file to your hard disk.  If t2 is your
normal terminal you need to either have it in memory before you launch Sterm
(preferably as a part of your boot file) or LOADed manually. You can put /t2 in
your execution directory and have it loaded as needed but putting it in OS9Boot
is the best thing to do.  You can use just one boot disk for both MultiVue and
non-MV.  Prevent MV from starting on boot by deleting autoex and run MV
manually with Multistart.  For all your OS-9 purposes, just let WindInt
completely replace GrfInt: just put in WindInt and forget you even have GrfInt.
It is OK to have VDGInt in your boot file along with WindInt (or GrfInt) as
long as you use VDG screens, otherwise get rid of it and use the memory for
something useful to you.  If you have both 512K and a hard disk you have a lot
of room for a big bootfile that will cover all your text and graphics needs and
serve them well.  Your OS-9 can stand a tuneup and one boot is proabably the
best way.  Go for it, and good luck!

Erich, I'm afraid I didn't make my problem clear.  T2 is in memory, along with

STERM, the system tells me it can't open T2.  This is when I boot my MV system
which has WindInt in the OS9boot.  If I deiniz R0, STERM initiates and works
fine (but I don't have a ramdisk).  If I boot my non-MV system (which has
GrfInt instead of WindInt) and iniz R0, STERM initiates fine and works well
(and I have the Ramdisk).  The question is why won't the MV (and WindInt)
system let the ramdisk be started and have STERM run? ???   Ches.

Ches,

BLOB = BootList Order Bug can manifest itself in a number of ways. Most
frequently seen is the BOOTFAILED message at boot. But it can be subtle as
well.

I had a bootlist combination that gave the outward appearance of all being
well. The system booted normally and everything seemed fine. Until, that is, I
tried to copy or format.

Those two commands just flat out refused to work.

'Re-ordering' my bootfile and making a new boot fixed it right up.

There's no one perfect list order. It seems to varry from one machine to
another, so all I can suggest is to play around and see what happens.

Keep a copy of what you presently have, tho!  :-)

Steve, I found a solution to my problem, but I don't fully understand why the
problem occurred in the first place.  The symptoms are that using GrfInt
permits simultaneous operation of T2/ACIAPAK and R0/RAMMER when each pair is
loaded separately but that WindInt does not permit T2 to be opened after R0 is
INIZd.  The solution is to merge all four modules in one file and then load the
single file.  I can sorta understand why a driver and its descriptor should be
merged, but why must both pairs be merged into a single file?  And why does
WindInt insist on such a merge when GrfInt does not?  Thanks for your
encouragement.  Ches.

Your work around further suggests that the BLOB is the problem. You've
effectively changed your bootlist by removing the modules and opting to load

But ... you're also robbing yourself of valuable system space if you're loading
the merged file after boot.

Well-l-l-l, I'm not directly removing modules and then manually loading, but I
think I see your point. (Kevin kinda rubbed my nose in it, too, by Email. Isn't
there a limit to the size of the bootfile?  I thought that was supposed to be
8k or less, but your comments now and earlier make me wonder whether I'm
remembering incorrectly.  Thanks for your help.  Ches.

Ches, it's 8K multiples. My boot file is around 32K.

The other place where you may be rembering 8K limits is when you load a module.
It take a fulk 8K. Eats up the space real quick.

Yep, I think what I'm remembering is the limit to the size of a file called
shell which has shell plus other modules totalling less than 8k. I suppose one
should make the boot file as close to a full multiple of 8k.  For example, if
the boot is approx 33k, maybe it takes 40k and wastes almost 8k.  Is that
reasonably correct?  Ches.

You got it, Ches. I'm thinking I'm just under the 32K boundry.

I'd think the same would be true of any file. When it's loaded into memory,
it's gonna take 8K. So you mays well make use of the space.

Ches!  You're running out of system space.  Put all those drivers/descs in your
bootfile.   Loading them after boot is okay for some testing, but also really
eats up the 64K kernel map.  Use "smap" and "pmap" to see.

Hey, I didn't take it bad - I enjoy the exchange - what I don't enjoy is having
to re-learn lessons I thought I had learned earlier. Ah well, the alternative
to advancing age and memory loss is less pleasant than an occasional
embarassment.  Somewhat more seriously, I continue to marvel at the capability
of this "little" computer.  Just about the time I think I understand it pretty
well, it stings me.  Great fun - Thanks again, Kev, for your guidance and
encouragement.  Regards, Ches.

Dear Jeremy,

<grin> Yeah, I knew you'd ask... and you should know that my answer will be:

Drop into the CoCo library (Lib 10) and do a "bro /key:kernel"  :-)

Up comes KRNL.AR, which is an AR'd ipatch file for making a new kernel which'll
accept numbers as the first character of a filename.  Hopefully, it also tells
you how to install the new kernel.

Keith,

As far as I know, no one is writing any drivers for CD-ROMs.  The problem is
getting the drive manufacturers and especially the CD-ROM makers to release the
specifications on how it is done without paying them large sums of money.  If
you can do this, then please do and let us know.

It is just like when I decided to do UUCP for the CoCo.  There were no
specifications written down anywhere.  There are now after several people got
together and reverse engineered it which is more or less when I had to do with
the help of some already existing source code.

Mostly, you'd need an ISO-9660 file manager.  I'd guess that MW has one, but I
don't know the price or availability.  Alternatively, someone could write one,
but I don't know anyone capable of it right now.

Check around on nets/BBSs tho... there may be some Unix C source for such
things, or at least rough readers.  thx! - kev

I have a FOCUS 3001 keyboard with the two DIPS set as follows:

1 = ON 2 = OFF

Sometimes when I turn on the MM/1 the following lights come on and then go off

Caps Lock Num Lock Scroll Lock

if these lights do not come on and then go back off the keyboard will not
execpt UPPERCASE letters by using the SHIFT key.

Is their a way to fix this problem?? I paid 60+ bucks for this (Second)
keyboard. The first one did the same problem but only cost me $20

If they (the leds) do not come on then I can not get the SHIFT keys to work.
They have to come on and then go back off. It did it Ii'Za few minutes ago, I
have to turn the MM/1 off wait a few seconds and then try again, it worked the
second time.

The GNU C compiler has not stifled the marketplace. On the contrary, it has
done much to improve it.  First, the Microware C compiler is the one with
outdated technology and lack of support - look at the K&R Microware offering
vs. GNUs ANSI, not to mention GNU C++.  Also compare bugs in GCC against
Microware C and see who loses!  Second, look at what GCC has done for companies
in the marketplace - Next, Wind River, and next DEC (with Wind River) all use
it as their standard compiler.  This way they don't have to waste their
resources creating and supporting what will likely be an inferior C compiler. 
Instead they can apply their effort to generating customer features, such as
POSIX functionality.  Note the lack of POSIX offerings from Microware.  Note
also that Wind River uses GDB as the debugger for VxWorks and thus provides it
for free while Microware wants $850 for its source debugger.

GNU software is a boon both to individual users and to the industry at large.
Microware will learn their lesson the hard way as OSK systems in the hands of
home users lead to the porting ond development of replacements for all but the
kernel of OS-9/68000.  Then ALL anyone will buy from them is an industrial
license at $29 per system.  Even in Des Moines you can't live on that.

Fm: Steve Wegert 76703,4255
To: Kev 76703,4227 (X)

Kev,

I've been tracking down a problem with my MM/1 and it leads me suspiciously
toward either the windowing software and or tsmon.

I've got a 3meg MM/1 with 5 serial ports, tho /t2, /t3 and /t4 are all that are
in use at the moment.  /t2 is a local terminal while /t4 is set up to be my
dial in. (tsmon /t4&).

Within a 24 hour period, /term and /w1 will have locked up. /t2 is still fully
functional. Rebooting has been the only way out of this fix.

Sometimes, with /term and /w1 locked up, /t2 will demonstrate what I've named
the 'just one off' effect. For example, if I wanted to issue the 'dir' command,
pressing the 'd' would net no echo. Pressing the 'i' would net a 'd' echo,.
Pressing the 'r' would net the 'i' echo. Hitting <enter> would complete the
command and again to execute.

Any thoughts on what's going on?

I've taken to just running a shell on /t2 rather than using tsmon to see if
that makes any difference. (By the way, using mtsmon doesn't make any
difference. The same things happen.)

I'm using version 30 of wcf and windio but the same problems appeared with 22.

I've also noted unexpected values for xon and xoff in the window descriptors.
WHat's behind $0F and $02. CHanging them to 00 has caused an interesting result
at boot. Black border, black background, black type and a white cursor.

Blindly using the color command sets things right but it's still got me
wondering. (Thought the xon/xoff parameters might be related to the locked
probelms).

Anything you can suggest would be appreciated.
