Hi Stephen... I've been playing with your Gadget/Button files. Real nice - I
know I could do it myself, but is there any chance I could get a copy of your
lib when you're done (with some simple docs). No use reinventing the wheel.

  I'll upload the lib for GADGETs soon.  I've made some minor changes to
improve memory efficiency and soon will have the bitmaps for gadgets worked
out.

Mark Some of the boot rom source is copywrite by Microware. The rest is
copyrite by Myself. The boot rom code is lisenced to IMS for the MM1 and I use
it in other places. I would prefer not publishing it.

 The only thing that people would give-up is the single density modes. Since
the universal format doesent use track 0 side 0 the sacrifice of the single
density might not be so bad.

Kevin,

Well, since the boot ROM code is licensed to IMS, then I suppose I should
contact them about getting permission to publish the code in the tech manual.

If you think the users should be able to use 2.88 meg disks, then get going on
the driver.

BTW: did you ever get a complete schematic of the MM/1 printed?  If so, can I
get one from you?

Mark it is not up to IMS to publish the source code. As a licensee of OS9 they
don't have any right to publish microware code. Why should they have a right to
publish the code that I have supplied them. I have licensed to them executable
code not source code.

Mark I long ago supplied complete schematics to IMS. I don't know what they did
with them.

Sb: #NEW Microware "Ultra C"
Fm: Jay Truesdale 72176,3565
To: all

I was browsing through a new magazine that I just started receiving at work
"Personal Engineering and Instrumentation News," when I happened across an ad
from Microware touting:

        "A Truly *New* C Compiler Comes Along Only Once In A Generation.

        Introducing ULTRA C. It lets you explore the boundaries of
        performance for hard real time."

The ad goes on to say that most C compilers were written over ten years ago and
since then a lot has been learned about how to write better compilers and that
Microware has incorporated this knowledge into their new compiler.

        "Microware's Ultra C uses a modular architecture that created a
        virtual playing field for vigorous action by dozens of optimizers to
        analyze, arrange, accelerate and compress code into fast, compact
        executables.  Heuristic analysis of register and variable usage FAR
        SURPASSES THE CAPABILITIES OF WHAT HUMAN PROGRAMMERS COULD DO
        THEMSELVES." (Emphasis Microware's)

I called Microware and asked about Ultra C. The scheduled release date is 21
September 1992 for the OS9 resident version. The next issue of "Pipelines" will
be dedicated to discussing Ultra C. Pricing and upgrade details have yet to be
determined.


Should be interesting!

Jay:

A couple of months ago, I was talking to MW up in San Francisco.  The guy I
talked to said there would be a new C Compiler come out "the last quarter of
this year".

I asked him how much it would run (as I told him it was absurd that they wanted
$800+ for the currently available C Compiler), and he said there was nothing
definite regarding price, but he thought it would run in the $500 range.

This new C Compiler really looks like something, based on what you have had to
say about it so far.

Thanks a lot for the info.

Ooooooo..! I thought it was that new SOFTWARE product: DOS PEROT.

When you start it up, it puts a message on the screen indicating that it's
_thinking_ about running, then it scans the system for any competing products.
If it finds any, of course it aborts!

To: Bill Dickhaus 70325,523 (X)

Does anyone know how to get a program to run in the Supervisor mode? I am
trying to manipulate some of the on-chip peripherals of the 68070. I have
written a driver and descriptor but it does not work.  Now I am writting a
simple program to try and solve my problem.  If I set bit #5 of the Attr byte
then the program is in the Supervisor mode but hangs up the entire MM/1.  But,
if I don't set the S bit and go into Sysdbg, I can step through the program
after setting the S bit and everything seems fine!  What am I doing wrong? Any
suggestions?

Thanks

Thanks!  I've asked Kevin, he hasn't done this yet!  I'll try to figure it out.
I think the problem is once a process is in the supervisor mode, there is no
multi-tasking!  Meaning I can't be in another window looking at that process
using sysdbg!

Any suggestions out there?

I am developing machine vision applications under os9 running on a 68030 board

fast, but exceptionally big and a royal pain to lug around. In order to make
life on the road easier for me and my collegues, I am looking for a laptop
solution. I could imagine it to be os9 running on an Apple Powerbook or a
PC-DOS based crosscompiler for the 68020/30 CPU's. Anyone ever come across
something like that?
