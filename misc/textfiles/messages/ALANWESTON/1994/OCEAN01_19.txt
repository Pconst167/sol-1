Clyde,
    I think I read it in a file or message base somewhere. Which is how I
pick up most of my tips from. There are a lot of people on here that could
tell you a whole lot of stuff about the MM/1. I'm just getting started with
the MM/1 myself. So I don't have to much to offer to begin with. But I try.
I save messages, write myself notes(unorganized), and try to track down the
information files that are out there.

Warren,

You're already on my mailing list. Essentially anybody who posted their 
address either here, or on the Internet, (ie in a public forum), is on the 
list. In your case, since you purchased OSTerm 68K, you are on the list as 
well.

BTW, Ken and I decided that 10pm tonight is the last time for software changes

to OSTerm 68K v2.1. I'll incorporate the final changes in the manual, and 
print them off in the next couple of days, and everybody with beta copies, 
such as yourself, will have the package, complete with a printed manual.

TTYL. Colin.

Colin,
      Thanks for keeping me on your mailing list.  BTW it is allowed to
post a listing of what items you do have for sale as a service to MM/1
Users.  Just so long as you do not quote prices.
