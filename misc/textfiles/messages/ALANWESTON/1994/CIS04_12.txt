Wayne,

Thanks for the reply.  I'm using CIM to con
nect with Compuserve.  Maybe I'll go
back to the good old White Knight and try that.

Thanks,

I have a friend who would like to run DeskMate v1.01 on a VGA monitor but
claims the cursor disappears. Is there a switch or anything he can do to see
the cursor ?

Any input will be welcome.

Thank You

Sb: CoCo stuff for sale

I have come to the realization that since I work 50 hours a week and go to
graduate school, so I can work 70 hours a week when I'm done, that I never will
be able to set up my old CoCo's like I'd always planned. As you can see I was
really into it, attended Rainbowfest Princeton several times and used to do
some programming. I hate to see this stuff slowly deteriorating in the basement
so it's all for sale. I have no idea what things are going for these days, but
some of the items are probably hard to find. I'll entertain offers for the
whole bunch at first (I'll deliver 200 miles from Connecticut, otherwise figure
you pay shipping.) If there is no interest in the whole lot I'll break it up.

Best bet is to call my BBS at (203) 753-8351 and leave a message to SYSOP or
call me voice (203) 754-6723, ask for dave.

Jay,

Sure.  Mike and I (and Pete used to) work for a company which makes a system
designed to play Bingo, Poker, Pulltabs, Keno, Slots, and other casino gambling
games on video player terminals.  Basically, it's comprised of:

1. VME host computer (68040 with 4-8 MB RAM, 2MB battery-backed RAM [enough
room for about 10,000 accounts], several intelligent 68000-based I/O cards to
talk to the terminals, etc).

2. Normal text terminals with cash drawers and printers as cashier stations.

3  The player terminals themselves... currently 68000-based with a TI 34010
graphics processor, lots of I/O, and a VGA monitor with touchscreen.

There can be anywhere from a dozen to hundreds of these connected to the host.
You buy credits from the cashiers, then log onto the player terminal and play
the game(s) of your choice via the touchscreen.

The host runs OS-9;  future versions may have dual cpus, one running OS-9, the
other Unix.  The player terminals may also use OS-9 before long.

best - Kevin

Oh, I didn't know that Pete was is the "used to" catagory. Any idea what he is
up to now? Speaking of your gaming machines...did anyone read the article in
the CIS magazine about CD-i? Interesting that they never mentioned the OS it
uses. Maybe they didn't want to upset Bill Gates?

Bob -

I'm now managing the systems staff over at the Charles Schwab Denver Base.
We've implemented the new OSF DCE architecture (actually, a variation on it
using the Andrew filesystem vice DFS), and have hundreds (soon to be over 7000)
of Sun Classics & SparcServer 010's connected via LAN, MAN, and WAN gear) using
everything from 56K lines to T3 trunks. Applications are all Motif based, and
serve primarily as market watching and mainframe connectivity tools for the
present.

Other than that, I'm pretty much twiddling my thumbs (grin)...

Gee, Kevin, are you recruiting all the old folks from this forum to work with
you....the only problem is that once they start at your place they disappear
from here! Guess that's what happens when you start to work for money.

Bob,

Hey, don't joke too hard;  we may be hiring lots more people soon... and that
could very well include other folk from this forum <grin>!

Our sales are taking off.  We have installations in major halls in Canada and
Milwaukee, and will be installing two more major sites within weeks both in the
northeast (at one of the largest casinos in the world) and in the midwest.
Installation on cruise ships is a definite possibility as well.

This all means we'll need more people to make up multiple installation and site
customization teams.  If our next generation player terminals use OS-9, then
we'll need OS-9/gfx types as well!

cheers - kev
