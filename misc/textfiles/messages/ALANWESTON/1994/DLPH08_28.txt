I just thried itr, and it worked fine for me. Did you use Delphis FTP or
FTP from somewhere else? Did you supply "anonymous" as the username.
The password really won't matter after that, but convention has it that
you should enter your Username@Site.Domain for the password.

First, practical matters:
   A friend of mine who's considerably more knowledgable about telnet
than I am suggested that ZModem might actually work over telnet.
If you're logging into a Unix host through modem, then you may
need to make sure you have an 8-bit connection (not 7even as is
common for Unix dial-ins).  You may also need to enable ZModem
control escaping.  Worth a try, certainly.

Second, other issues:
   One of Kermit's strengths compared to, say, ZModem, is that it's
possible to implement very simple Kermit programs that will work
quite well with any other Kermit implementation.  On the other
hand, modern versions of Kermit are both very fast (only slightly
slower than ZModem) and extremely flexible.  In fact, over connections
that aren't noiseless, windowing Kermit has the potential to be
significantly faster than ZModem.  Unfortunately, Delphi is not
alone in only supporting very basic Kermit.  It's kind of odd,
really, since windowing Kermit is doubtless more widely used
than WXModem, which Delphi does support.  With Delphi's push
for Internet connectivity, perhaps it's time they re-evaluated
their decision not to support windowing Kermit, which is one
of the few protocols that consistently works over Internet
connections.

     RE: Make command (Re: Msg 89436)
     From: TIMKIENTZLE  To: ALWAGNER

To reiterate something James Jones said, and which bears repeating:

   `make' knows NOTHING about C, or the C compiler, or the C linker.
It doesn't know what `main' is, or how files get included.  In fact,
`make' is used to compile assembly language, fortran, perform
backups, etc.  I'm working on a large project right know which
includes three moderately-sized programs and a 300-page book.
I have a makefile set up which enables to to type `make book'
to run all the source code through a formatter program, and
collect that together with the text of the book and run the
whole thing through a typesetting program.  Alternatively,
if I type `make programs,' it compiles the programs.  The reason
this works is that `make' is in fact a general tool that can
be used with any project that works from building new files
from old files.  (I can also type `make backup' to automatically
build an archive of the 50 or so files in the project that
I can copy to a floppy disk for safekeeping.)

`Standard' make behavior is that if no target is given on the command
line, then the FIRST target in the makefile is built.  This is why
`all' is typically the first target in the makefile.  Often, `all'
is the second target in the makefile if the makefile builds a lot
of programs.  The first target would then be something like `default'
that compiled only a basic collection of the programs.  That way,
`make' with no arguments would build the basic collection, and
`make all' would build everything.

     RE: ZModem Info Needed (Re: Msg 89287)
     From: TIMKIENTZLE  To: BOISY

When a ZModem sender starts up, it goes through the following steps:
   1) Sends `rz<Return>' to attempt to start a ZModem receive program
on the host.  This allows you to upload to Unix, for instance, without
having to give a command at both ends.
   2) Sends a `ZRQINIT' packet, whose first five bytes are ALWAYS
**<CAN>B00   The `**' is padding, the <CAN>B identifies a hexadecimal-encoded
packet header, and the 00 identifies this as a `ZRQINIT' packet.
The next 8 bytes are the argument to ZRQINIT, which is normally zero,
and the last four bytes are the CRC, which is again, normally zero.
By convention, CR LF XON are included after any ZModem hexadecimal
packet (Well, almost any.).  Sometimes ZRQINIT has a non-zero argument,
which is probably what's confusing you.

In practice, the four bytes <CAN> B 0 0 are typically used as an
auto-detect string.  The <CAN> rarely appears in terminal emulations
(pretty much never in ANSI X3.64-derived emulations such as VT100),
so you can often get by with searching for a <CAN> and then just
checking the next three bytes.

Automatically detecting a ZModem receiver is similar, except that
the ZModem receiver starts with a `ZRINIT' packet (packet type 01).
Don't watch for the argument or CRC unless you're mildly masochistic,
since the ZRINIT argument varies considerably.  The catch is that
you should only do this if your terminal program allows you to
set up which files to transfer well in advance, since once you
see the ZRINIT packet, you typically only have 30-60 seconds
in which to start the transfer.  Prompting the user for a file
to send after you see ZRINIT is not recommended.

Conveniently, I've been researching ZModem lately.  Feel free to ask
if you have any more questions.   I get on Delphi about every two
weeks lately, but you can also reach me at: kientzle@netcom.com.

  I have been using it to translate the 6809 code that the RIBBS BBS uses
into 68000 code. You still have to make some fixes, but at least it does
the hard work for you. it will not translate the header part. That is the
beginning psect part. If you know a little bit about 68K assemble, you
should not have any problem finishing the conversion. once I did that it
was a snap to compile. The only other problem I ran into was, the compiler
barfed on things such as "bne.s, bra.s, & ect." All I had to do was change
them to "bne.w, bra.w & ect".

Thanks for putting "xlate.lzh" on Compuserve. The aurther has some more
programs that he may put int PD. When he does, I'll be putting a copy of
them here on Delphi.

InfoXpress is a program that can dial up CIS and/or Delphi and
grab your messages and email as fast as possible so that you can
read them offline at your leisure and reply offline at your leisure
without incurring lots of connect time charges.  (InfoXpress is
actually a pretty general program, script-driven, but as far as
I know, the only scripts written so far are for CIS and Delphi.)

Where can you get it?  That's currently under discussion/in flux.
See recent messages from/to BILLDICKHAUS.  If you're interested,
send him email (he wrote the program, and IMHO it's a nice piece
of work--I hasten to add that I'm not associated with him save
that I bought a copy of InfoXpress).

 > also how can i zmodem at 9600. will nitros9 help.

Judging by recent messages to the BITNET CoCo mailing list, yes
it will.  "Sliding window" protocols, of which zmodem is one,
put a pretty heavy load on the machine because they're designed
so that the sender does *not* wait for acknowledgement before
sending the next packet (most of the time), which means that
the receiver has to be able to keep reading incoming data even
while it's writing to disk what it just read.  If you have a
sufficiently large RAM disk, try downloading to it and then
copying to more permanent storage afterwards.

    I think it would probably be a good idea for me to clear up some
possible confusion here before it has a chance to get started.

    A number of you have downloaded the Gold Runner 2000 announcement file
that I uploaded several days ago. I happened to be looking through a
compuetr gaming magazine of some sort yesterday and happened to see an ad for
a new version of the old game Lode Runner, something like Lode Runner: The
Adventure Returns. Lode Runner also happens to be the game I redesigned with
Gold Runner 2000. I jsut want everyone to know that my game and the new Lode
Runner bear no resemblance to each other whatsoever. I wasn't even aware that
someone else was re-doing that 10 year old game until yesterday. In my own,
obviously terribly biased opinion, the screen shots the ad had for the new
Lode Runner didn't resemble or give any idea of the old game at all, whereas
I stayed true to the idea of the old game, though improving it greatly by
expanding and detailing the graphics characters and background.

    How dare some other mainstream programmer take my idea and turn it into a
probable huge success on the IBM! :)

If you have source, you can add -M=16k to the link line in the makefile,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is InfoXpress?

InfoXpress is a software package designed to automate the process of
connecting to communications services, then downloading, viewing and
replying to the message base.  InfoXpress will automatically log onto a
service, check for any waiting electronic mail, enter one or more user
forums and download all messages not previously read - and do this for
more than one service in a single session.  Once all the messages have
been collected, InfoXpress allows the user to interactively read and
reply to the messages while offline.  Replies and messages are stored
and then uploaded th next time InfoXpress connects to that service.  The
purpose of InfoXpress is to not only automate the message gathering
process, but also to save you time and and reduce online connection
time.

InfoXpress is available for OS9 LII and OSK (OS9/68000).  For the OS9
LII version, minimum hardware requirements are: a CoCo3 with 512K, a
hardware serial port and a modem that will reset itself when DTR is
toggled.  At least 160K free memory must be available, as well as 4-6K
of system memory.  A hard drive is recommended, as the programs and
supporting files take up about 550K of disk space, and this does not
include message file space requirements.  If a floppy system is used, a
no-halt type is recommended.  SACIA, or a similar serial driver (not the
stock ACIAPAK) is recommended, with the input buffer set to at least 1K,
as well as any other patches or modifications that improve serial port
performance.

The OSK version requirements: a minimum of 256K of memory, a hardware
serial port, a modem that will reset itself when DTR is toggled and
approximately 300K of disk space for programs and supporting files.
Disk space requirements do not include message files, which can become
quite large.  Although InfoXpress was developed on an MM/1, K-Windows
calls are not used, so InfoXpress should run on any standard OSK 2.4
system, and might also work on other versions of OSK.

The current release of InfoXpress is 1.2.0, which supports forums and
Mail on Delphi and CompuServe.  Additional scripts are provided for
capturing weather and stock quote information on CompuServe.

I have seen such a program, unfortunately it was on an MSDOS machine.  I
can check with my boss (who has it) to see if by chance it was written
under Qbasic or something where the source code would be available.

Hi Paul,

  KBcom?  Is that not for OS9/68K?  Or am I thinking of another program?
What is the name of the program which was OSTerm ported to OS9/68K?  I
forget off hand.  Oh well!  If it is for the CoCo I may try it out, but
I have tried other communication programs such as Telstar, Supercomm (I
think is the name)...  I have always returned to OSTerm.  I do like it!
I have never used any non-OS9 program for communicating.  I do not use
non-OS9 programs for much of anything!
  I have re-submitted DScan V4.0 and had much better success this time.
THIS LAST STATEMENT IS FOR ALL WHO USE DScan!  Well, gotta go.  See ya.

LONG LIVE OS-9! <FOREVER> ** In whatever form it is in!

KBcom has been released (both a shareware and an enhanced commercial version)
for CC3 Level 2.  Eddie has also created a version for the MM/1, but has
not yet released it.

 > What is the name of the program which was OSTerm ported to OS9/68K?

Originally, Vaughn Cato did a quick port of OSTerm for the MM/1, which was
marketed as TasCOM by CoCoPro!  After CoCoPro! left the market, Northern
Xposure arranged to upgrade the program and distribute it
as OSTerm/68K.  The MM/1 version now contains significant enhancements
compared with the earlier versions:  optional GUI frontend, external
(user-definable) protocols, significantly enhanced VT100 and ANSI emulation,
and many other enhancements.  Since I have been involved in this project,
I will stop there...

Hi Terry,

  I AM sorry, Terry, but I feel the need to aid the defense of all the
OS-9/68,6309 users out here.  From what I have read, you are a user of
RSdos (which in reality, there is no such thing).  My question then, is
this:  If you do not use or use OS-9 Level 2 on a limited basis, why be
so concerned about the OS-9 Level 2 users getting support through the
OS-9 Users Group?  I, myself, am not a current member of any User Group
and still I receive plenty of support for OS-9 Level 2.  By reading the
messages in this forum, I have gotten as much or more support then I
might have if I were a member of a Users Group.  Please correct me if I
am wrong about your "RSdos" usage.  See ya.

     From: CPERRAULT    To: MRUPGRADE (NR)

        Terry, when your group called for more OS-9, they got it why?
   Because the USERS got active and supported OS-9. At this time, there
   is not activity for the 6809 because none of the users are
   communicating<that is now changing I think, with the new conferences,
   and increased Internet activity>.
        The UG will support OS-9 Level two, hence it's own VP, but how
   much support you get reflects the amount of activity coming from us
   the users. This is what a users group is all about. As others have
   already told you, it's not a business where products are being sold,
   yet an organization where projects and activities can be centered
   around. If you have something you want to see done for the coco
   community, you can round up the people for the project and start your
   game plan, and will have the UG backing that, depending on how
   reasonable the request is, can help bring all the parts together so to
   speak. Consider it the kernal of the OS-9 community.

        >>if it's and OSK group, fine. Say so,,...<<

        Why? It's not an OSK group. It's an **OS-9** group, meaning
   anything related to OS-9. If it presents itself as a majority of OSK,
   that is only because the USERS of OSK are making the difference. The
   directors of the UG will probably have a little bias against Level II
   where it makes sense, such as financial sponsorship. I can't think of
   too many things that would be reasonable for the UG to drop money into
   for projects/materials relating to OS-9 level two, since it will
   probably not come back in any form. It would need a sure way of
   getting the money back to the UG. Even that's not definate tho. I
   imagine we have to wait for a specific situation involving funds to
   come along to get a clearer perspective. I think a few exceptions
   would be a few hardware/software projects.

        >>and perhaps the OS-9'ers,, will get something together "FOR OS-
   9",, instead of sending on another twenty five bucks,, and hoping next
   year will be different.<<

        First off, the OS-9'ers already have something together "FOR OS-
   9". It's called the OS-9 users group, something we have taken for
   granted so much, we  haven't begun to utilize it. Why start yet
   another group to complicate things more, and only get similar results?
   If they want a more intimate atmosphere, they can also subscribe to
   regional  UG's such as MI&CC, Glenside, CHI-UG, as well as ACS and
   others that aren't as well known. Btw, hopefully in the near future we
   can get a reference of all such smaller clubs<technically most of you
   guys are probably larger, membership wise, than the National UG, but
   I'm referring to the regional coverage>. I would like to see the UG
   with a good working relationship with all such clubs, perhaps setting
   up some more regional branches<clubs> itself in areas that can use
   them. Again, this depends on the needs and willingness of users. That
   is the whole point of the UG. As far as hoping next year will be
   different, perhaps if we did more than sit on our hands last year it
   would have been a little better? What is the exec supposed to do about
   that?
        What we need is a snowball effect. Let's get things rolling, even
   if it's only many smaller projects. That way, people with little
   leisure time can still have at least a little they can contribute.
   What would you like to see Terry? Btw, since you are the President of
   MI&CC, you are very qualified to answer this. How do you think the UG
   can help your club as well as others, and how would you like to work
   with the ug? I think a lot of collarboration with it's smaller clubs
   could be a driving force into the UG's future, and I think both sides
   should tap into each other.

        See Ya

        This is good news! Keep us updated, and hopefully if the system
   is complete and mature enough, we'll be able to get a promotional
   project going as well as porting Amiga software to OS-K, making it a

   can't see me personally involved in any such promotional program(until
   after I do everything else), but I can see where when the time is
   right, you should push it heavily, if you do become a rep. Btw, do you

        I agree, the live interaction can really help those of us who
   want to learn more about programming. I imagine general use of OS-9

   hopefully we'll get some programming stuff in there<as I could sure

   too serious with it for a while. I do plan on taking it up tho<it
   looks like a good language anyway>, so I try to soak up whatever I see
   mentioned about it, as much as possible as it will come in handy
   later. Btw, do you still plan on covering basic09 in the Underground?
   I really like the Basic training series, tho I understand you plan to
   move more in the direction of C there. Is there anything in the works
   for Basic09, such as covering system calls,errors and debugging, and
   small routines.

     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL

        This is just a reminder to all that Tomorrow we will be having
   the first of hopefully many OS9 conferences.


                       ***OS-9 Late Night ***
                       ***Monday August 29, 1994**
                       ***At 10:00 PM !!EASTERN!! :-)***
                       ***Topic:General***

        Bring your thoughts,questions,opinions, and Money...(Ok, maybe
   I'm getting a little obnoxious<G> ). This conference is going to be
   directed by those who attend, so if you have system problems this is
   the place to go for answers in real time :-) What should we be doing
   in the community to improve the quality of the Coco and OS-9? Monday
   night we can throw some ideas around.

        If I get my way the following three conferences will be dedicated
   topics covering some important current events within the community.
   Once I have things finalised, I'll make the official announcement in
   forum, hopefully by either Tuesday or Wednsday night.

     New Ug Project
     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL

        I am currently in the process of compiling a nationwide list of
   Computer shows/fairs for the OS9 Users Group. If anyone would like to
   help out with collecting information regarding shows in your area,
   please leave me some email.
        I will be seeking out shows that will be held in the Boston/New
   England area, but will need help from people in other states. If you
   can provide information about shows held annually each year<or
   upcoming one time events> in your area,  please send me a message with
   the details and I will add it to a Database. Once I have enough
   entries, I will send the list off to the UG, and will keep it updated
   regularly.
        This will be a great help for the UG so that we can keep a
   regular record of shows coming up, should the exec plan to send a
   representative to these general computer shows to inform the people
   there of OS-9 and the UG. The vendors could also send attend with OSk
   hardware and software. Being present at general PC shows may be one of
   the better ways currently to promote OSK, and while it won't show
   right off, I would not be surprised to see a decent upsurge in sales
   after a regular attendance of these shows throughout the country.
   Eventually enough interest will emerge that people will look forward
   to seeing OSK Machines when they attend. The more they see of OSK and
   understand, the more they will get comfortable with it, and be willing
   to be such a machine. We all know who likes to attend Computer
   fairs...PROGRAMMERS!!!<grin>

        If anyone wants to jump in on this with me, please leave me mail.
   I would like to compile as thorough a list as possible, covering as
   much of the country as possible<and canada perhaps>, before sending
   the first edition off to the UG. Hopefully MW will find this usefull
   also.

        What I need for info is:

        The Name of the show
        The name of the people who are running it, as well as who to get
   in touch with for info regarding it,and a phone number/mail address.
        Date the event will be on.
        The location  of the the event itself<street,city,state,zip if
   possible>

        And any more info you can come up with is welcome.
        This project is open to anyone who wants to participate, be you
   Level II or OSK ;-)
