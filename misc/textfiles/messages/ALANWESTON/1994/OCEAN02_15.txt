John,
        Pardon my denseness, but which "OS9 Sig" is this happening in?
  
        I'm erratic about capturing (and reading) the OS9 Sig on 
Compuserve, haven't really gotten involved on GEnie (which I'll 
probably drop soon), and haven't gotten back on to Delphi yet, because 
their records don't show that I actually did pay them off on my first 
go-round. (tremendously annoying!)  I'm going to persevere in getting 
back on Delphi as CLYDEPRICE, especially since they've expanded their 
Internet access, and I'll be trying to get the bugs out of my MM/1 
system, or failing that, get my System IV back up and functional "on 
the net", and I'm _eager_ to explore "cyberspace"!
  
        Having "hosted" a Waffle (DOS) BBS with two techie gurus 
actually running the system, I'm eager to learn whatever it takes to 
get an OSK box functioning as a node in a store-and-forward uucp web, 
and also occasionally (frequently!) navigating directly on Internet.
  
        As a non-techie and non-programmer who's just trying to USE 
this hardware/OS/software to DO what I want to do, I've experienced 
some _wierd_ problems and tremendous frustrations, but this is the 
operating system that makes the most sense of anything I've seen "out 
there", and I'm stubbornly going to keep learning enough to USE it.
  
        When you need a dunce-level beta tester, I'm right here.

John A.,
    My capture works fine here. I do start mine as a seperate procs 
 Kterm & . The only 2 things is one When I try to u/l (Y-modem Batch) I have 
to go back to the orginal window and hit enter, the name of the file pops up 
and the u/l starts working. The other is when I use the dial directory to
place a call to a bbs I have to wait for a connection and mouse up to the
menu bar and pick 38,400 baud, else all woud be garbage. The connection
works fine if made from the terminal screen using ADT#######. BTW: I used
DED to change the t0 to t3.

Warren,
    I d/l the new math module the other night from your bbs called
CALSMATH.LZH. It is a lot faster. I have this one program from the EFFO_PD#
called EPHEM(Astromany plotter) wht use to take about 7 seconds to update
the planets positions now just takes 1 second. Huge difference. That was
letting it go on a free run mode. I didn't time the updates on the main data 
screens. BTW: I let the Monte.Carlo run for 20 minutes on my system before
aborting it using the math ed#13 module.

Warren,
  In the last week or so, I received a FIDO mmsg from a person that
tried to use the YModem to do a batch type download and it failed.
  I think I have xydown, so I'll take a look at it. I'm getting closer
in getting both the "shell" window and ZMODEM receive to work. Zmodem
transmit works great.
  I am leaving for Salem, Va. sunday and will be gone all week. BTW, I
tried your bbs today (2-11-93) at noon CST and your modem answered but
the bbs did not come up. Guess you know by now.

You are quite right.  One little change to T$LtoA did the job.
"Sorry about that, Chief!"
I may have another trick or two up my sleeve - if so, you'll hear about
it here!  Also, I'm glad to hear that someone finds this useful.

Calvin,
     Sorry to say even if you feel you fixed it with the cal6math.lzh it 
isnt working at all with basic.  Calling either math or math.340 gives a 
**** Can't install trap handler ****
**** math ****
Error 000:214
     So I have no idea with this error but I have seen it before.

Paul,
     Be careful with this math module.  It has a bug in working with
basic.  Calvin is working on it.

John, 
     That was I complaining about the Ymodem batch mixup but thought I
replied about it before.
     I don't recall seeing any failed connects on Friday.  If it happens 
again it is best to reinitiate the call in a few minutes. There is a
brief perioud (less than a second) that when RiBBS is finished with one
call it resets the modem but the BBS is not quite ready and calls that
hit that time slot will get bounced.  Maybe when we get KBBS up and
running that can be eliminated in the Binkley port (hint, hint !)

Clyde,
  The OS9 Sig on DELPHI is where the OSK (MM/1) UUCP activity is at. As
of now PALM V2.0 is on the database ready to be downloaded. The FULL
UUCP is just about ready. It is in beta testing.
  I too am looking forward to the release of the UUCP. I have access to
a UNIX system with Internet and UUCP.

  YModem on KTerm does not have batch mode YET. I just got docs on X &
Ymodem protocols.
  Just the other day I noticed that I had put 38400 in the main baud
rate section but NOT in the PHONE BOOK section. I modified it and now
you can select 300 - 38400 in the phone book.
  Thanks for the report.

John A.,
    I do successful d/l Y-modem batch all the time(as long the bbs gives me
1024 byte blocks(one bbs don't)).

Hmmm...I think you're right; emacs is blocking on an EOF lock, because
KTerm hasn't closed the capture file.
 
Speaking of the 68340...how fast is your RAM?  I've had some troubles
that look like they're attributable to my 80 ns RAM not being able to
keep up at 16 - epsilon MHz, because I've slowed the CPU down to 15 MHz, 
and the problems have gone away.
