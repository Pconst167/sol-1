Paul,
        I'm a non-programmer very interested in exploring Internet and 
in eventually networking OS-9 machines together smoothly.
  
        I'd really like to hear about any developments in TCP/IP and 
other such software for the OSK environment.
  
        One of the drawbacks in the attempted (and failed) port of the 
Waffle BBS to OSK was the lack of the ancillary uucp programs in the 
OSK environment which usually come packaged with the Un*x operating 
system(s).  If anybody can fly an MM/1 as a realtime terminal on 
Internet, and/or participate in a store-and-forward Usenet/uucp 
network, I really _need_ to hear about it.
  
        Thanks for the encouraging report.

John,
        I agree with your desire for a TBBS-like program, especially if 
it can include eventually a TDBS-like database support.
  
        I feel like a voice crying out in the wilderness continuing to 
ask for at least the option of an ASCII-interface and optional 
non-graphics and non-ANSI support.
  
        The ability to specify display-screen width and the extreem 
configurability of TBBS has kept my admiration and appreciation ever 
since I started BBSing about 6 years ago.  I just never got around to 
_buying_ the program...
  
        Our environment needs both Fido support and Usenet/Internet 
capability, and it would be great if we could have that in the same BBS 
package.  A TBBS-type interface would top it off perfectly, IMnsHO.

        About 3 years ago a programmer who I had working on a port of 
Waffle set up the Unix BBS on one of the systems he was tinkering on. 
It could be his lack of experience in that area, but it really didn't 
work well (at least in that incarnation).
  
        The Waffle BBS for Unix employed gobs of Unix-specific system 
calls, and at that point we did not have the appropriate library to 
compensate for that.  Waffle causes culture-shock for folks who're 
already used to BBSing in the clone world, but it provides the 
possibility of an ASCII-based BBS interface to be a private Usenet 
newsgroup reader/responder and/or a call-in BBS and/or a leaf or node 
system in a store-and-forward uucp-type network.
  
        Somehow, Tom Dell quit sending me updates on my registered 
version of the UNIX (source-code) version.  I'd _love_ to contract with 
another OSK programmer (for $peanuts) to attempt the port again, and 
_document_carefully_ the modifications to the code, since Mr.Dell won't 
allow distribution of the resulting binaries.
  
        I always thought Waffle was a strange program, but it does the 
job, and if you want to start out with a program that works on other 
boxes, this one works pretty well.  We'd also need _code_ for the 
ancillary uucp-family of programs.
        (The lack of the "other" programs has, I think, been the main 
reason why nobody else has attempted this.  Any source-code bird-dogs 
out there want to point to sources for the sources?)

Clyde,
   A FULL UUCP & MAIL package is about to be released for OSK and the
MM/1. There has been much discussion about UUCP, OSK, & the MM/1 over on 
DELPHI.

John,
     Is this your port of Binkley or someone elses work ? If someone
elses then will it do all the differant mail networks like Binkley ?
See my next msg. announcing the available sources for an OSK BBS.

     PS I recall several persons were working on a FAX program for OSK
and in particular Joel Hegberg.  Has anything been released in this area 
lately ?

         *** Announcement ***
I have the sources for the OS9 APBBS from Mike Guzzi, Maximus 102 C,
Craig Crosses OS9 utilities for RiBBS and a copy of Binkley from John A. 
Donaldson all archived and fitting on one 1.4 meg 3.5" floppy disk.
Anyone interested in working on part or all of the OSK BBS let me know,
send me a blank 3.5" floppy and $3.00 for shipping and I will put this
all together for them.
  I am still waiting for the source for RiBBS but may not need it if
what is included is sufficient.
  Lets put K B B S on the map !!!

WH> post a listing of what items you do have for sale

But if somebody else states a price, am I allowed to correct them with
the real price?

Actually, the best way seems to be to just get an address, and send them a 
catalogue. I just mailed out around 100, to people who posted their addresses 
here (Fido) and on Internet within the past three months.

Hopefully that will elicit some responses. (ie sales!)

Colin,
     As moderator it is up to me to enforce the Fido rule of no
commercial sales.  So if you were to correct an error that someone else
made in just posting info I beleive it would be permitted, at least I
would allow it. But if you were to quote and then a customer answered
and accepted an offer using the Fido msg base then that would be a
violation.  
     I can allow posting a listing of items for sale with prices if it
is a first time offer but should be clarified with a disclaimer that a
person wishing to purchase anything should contact you direcrtly by
voice or mail to confirm the price and shipping costs.  Of course there
is nothing wrong with a person posting his tel. number and/or mail
address for you to contact him reguarding a sale.   BTW what is the
Internet policy on commercial sales. ?
