    WOW! You got 7th Guest AND Comptons?!! Wow.

    I got Ecco The Dolphin CD, Sonic CD and a "Classics Disk" with 5
cartridge games: Streets of Rage, Revenge of Shinobi, Columns, Golden Axe,
and the worst driving game in the world (except in the arcades) Super
Monaco GP. I then bought Rebel Assault (super awesome game) and Silpheed
(a polygon lovers heaven, 100 times better than the MS-DOS version). I am
looking to get Space Ace as soon as it comes out in November. What did you
buy for it since you have to wait for your freebies?

     Wow, super-awesome. How are the movies? Lazer quality? I like FMV when
you can tell it's digital. :) I don't have to ask how DL and Space Ace are.

     Hmmm, looks like they were REALLY mass producing them. When I was a kid
I allways liked picking off that stuff. It sucks when your'e painting led

       Sounds cool to me. Sounds like switching from cassete audio to CD's.
Looks like I'll be going with a full blown CDI player sooner or later.

Yeah, I see how that would work.   I have a System V, and don't have
KWindows, and I startup into the text window (TERM).  I could, I suppose
do the setenv's, then "shell" without the &.  Then I'd have the original
shell waiting.  Not a problem, but just a little more clutter in memory.

I still wonder (for a single-window start) how doing the setenvs would work
then do an "ex shell" to get rid of the original shell.  This seems like it
would work.

 Much easier way to do this.  Simply add the following line to the end of your
 startup file - "ex tsmon term" (I use 'ex tsmon -p term').  Create a file
 called '.login' in your default working directory, usually /dd or /h0 which
 contains all your setenv's.  When you power up or reset, hit enter and you'll
 get a prompt to login (tsmon calls 'login').  After you've successfully logged
 in, login will call the file .login in your current working directory and
 set your environment variables for you.

 Note - your password file does have to be set up but you don't have to have
 entries for user name and password - these can have no entries allowing a
 simple <ENTER> to allow you to log on to your system.

 If you have need for different environment variables for different
 applications you can set up different password file entries.  The first might
 be empty as I described above.  The second might contain your name, 'dave'.
 (You can still leave the password entry blank.)  The 5th and 6th fields
 respectively set the CMDS and WORKING directories.  If you use a different
 default working directory, you can use a different .login file which will
 set up different environment variables.  Actually very simple and flexible.
 Read the commands 'tsmon' and 'login'.  Alternatively, you can continue
 to use 'profile' to change you environment variables as you're now doing.
 I find the latter to be useful when I'm experimenting.

    Come to think of it there is a problem that is annoying me lately, but
not because of XY/Z. Using Sterm on Delphi, Delphi seems to send a code at
one time or another (maybye going into mail) that the window interprets as
transparent characters on. Then when I ESC-S to get a shell and "z;display 7"
the file % update (wich I really like) writes over itself making it a garbled
mess. How can this be avoided? I know it's something Delphi sends me because
Iv'e ESC-S and fixed it with a display code and it creeps back again.

While we're giving hints <G>....  I think I mentioned it before, but I've
had a little problem of losing the dload if I have screen pause turned on,
and the screen pauses..  If you don't already do anything with the OPTS,
would it be a hindrance to _gs_opt, save it to restore on exit, then turn
off pause?  I think it would be a help.

Is your modem not error-correcting?  I wouldn't use -G with a non-correcting
modem, but with E-C modems, I've been fairly successful with my local BBS.

I still tend to use ZModem most of the times, however.

BTW.. Last night I had a funny occurrence. I tried Z for the first time
here and dloaded a file.  At the end, suddenly, Z started again (From the
menu, it appeared to be only one file.. Anyway, the thing seemed to stick
for a while, I think I hit CTRL-C, then suddenly Delphi seemed to be
receiving my logon, Getting my Handle, then my password, of course responding
with error messages..  Apparently Delphi was sending it to itself, because
I use STerm, manually logging on.  I first thought it was sending my capture
buffer, but my password was not even in that file, so I don't know what was
going on.

Sounds like Delphi is sending you the sequence "ESC <" ($1B $3C) which
is the GFX code for setting transparent mode (needs a parameter: $00 is
off; probably any non-zero would be on).

This coincides with the VT52 sequence to set ANSI cursor mode.  Perhaps you
can eliminate this by changing your terminal type in Delphi.  (Sorry, I
don't recall the Delphi commands for doing this -- I usually traverse
the Delphi maze by trial and error... or let InfoXpress do it for me <g>.)

I think DEC Mail sends either ESC ( 0 or ESC ) 0 when entering mail. I don't
remeber what they are supposed to do, off hand, but I've got a VT102 manual
at home if you really need to know. Anyway, try one of those to see if it

I just checked and the specific sequences I see (VT102 emulation) are

        ESC )0 ESC [4l ESC )0 ESC [4l ESC =

The l character is a lowercase ell. I had forgotten about the ESC = sequence.
If you are using VT52 emulation, you might try VT102 emulation to see if
that helps.

Hummm, I've seen that too Ken, only not on this coco. But when I capture
the stuffs with a "vlt" script on my amiga, there sure is. It puts my
amiga in the BOLD text mode, adding a pixel to the width of any vert lines
in the character. I('m not sure that its supposed to, but then "vlt" is
supposed to know all about vt-100/220 codes, or even tektronix stuffs
as its used a the Stanford Linear Accelerator labs to make terminals
out of all their amiga's. Nice proggy, docs could use some help tho.

Hi, Hugo -

I went in tonight and checked.  I changed my Delphi terminal type
(under Using Delphi; Settings; Terminal) to VT52, then went into Mail
via the OS-9 Forum.

The data I captured included:
   ESC =    ($1B $3D) --> VT52 Alternate Keypad upon entry into Mail
        (This is also the KWin code for BoldSw; expects a parameter
         of $00 for off; non-zero for on)
   ESC >    ($1B $3E) --> VT52 Numeric Keypad upon exit from Mail
        (Can't find this sequence documented for L2Win nor KWin.)

So, sure enough, that will set your terminal into Bold mode.

You could either change your Delphi setting to a safe one ("Unknown"), or
switch to a terminal program that handles the sequences safely (that is,
one that doesn't pass the VT control sequences directly to the screen).
Better yet, get one that does a good job of VT100 emulation, and change
your Delphi terminal setting to VT100...

Cheers... / Ken

     From: CPERRAULT    To: BOISY


        >>After posting my message regarding my inability to continue to
   host OS-9 Live!, I recieved no responses.<<

        Boisy, let's wait till the end of tonights OS-9 Late Night. I'll
   ask when enough people get there if there is anyone interested. I
   think I do get a few in the conferences who don't normally get on
   forum as often as we do(ie 4 times a day<grin>. I may or may not be
   able to find someone, tho I sure hope I do. Things will be lonely in
   the conference world without OS-9 Live!, and since the range of OS-9
   Late Night is so broad(I'm open to DECB if there is ever the
   interest), I felt OS-9 Live! really filled in an important gap in
   covering OS-9/68k and OS-9000, which I could only cover so much. With
   the latter two versions of OS-9 being the NOW and the Future of OS-9,
   I really hope that if OS-9 Live! can't continue on, some form of
   Profession OS-9 conference will come along to take it's place.

        >>I think Chris Perrault's OS-9 Late Night conferences will be a
   good substitute as long as there are some topics pertaining to OS-
   9/68K on the agenda.<<

        I am certainly willing to pick up as much of that slack as
   possible, but again, the area covered is very broad which leaves us
   with a lot of possible discussion topics, even for a weekly
   conference(there are FIVE this month btw!). I am more than willing to
   cover OS-9/68k and OS-9000 as I have always, but I still feel the need
   for OS-9 Live! which gives top priority to Professional versions of OS-9.
Of course, if Coco interest should drop, I'll most definately slant
   it towards more Professional OS-9 or whatever the people who attend
   want, but I don't see that happening. OS-9 Late Night was actually
   born out of OS-9 Live! which is another reason I am fond of your
   conference. I wish you were able to continue, or we could at least
   find someone to continue running this conference, since you really had
   the right idea with this. Once OS-9 Live! came out, I decided that we
   could also use a conference to compliment that, something that also
   had room for Professional OS-9, with a slant towards the Coco for the
   majority crowd here that wanted it(such as people like me), as well as
   a general chat get together where we weren't tied down to one specific
   topic(so people can just show up with their questions about anything),
   hence the reason I try to have at least two Open Forums a month. Also
   I feel the vendors and User groups/clubs and other organizations of
   the community need more outlets than what they have to inform users,
   so I wanted to use this conference as one more they could add to their
   disposal, which is why we have a lot of confernces with them. Right
   there you can see there is a lot covered in the little time we have,
   showing the need for that second and perhaps third conference.

        On the brighter side, a lot of what is discussed for OS-9 Level
   II is very applicable to Professional versions of OS-9, so there is an
   even bigger percentage supported than one might think. As Winter
   approaches I am hoping to  slant the conference more towards system
   specific stuff, such as making boots, programming, shell+ usage and
   shell programming, and software based stuff. If anyone has anything
   they want to offer as far as hosting a conference on something in that
   area, let me know. If anyone is interested in taking over Boisy's
   conference please get in touch with him. I'm glad to see OS-9 Late
   Night has done as consistently well as it has, but we need another 1
   or 2 conferences to really help cover a good portion of what is out
   there with OS-9.

        Oh geeze, I went overboard again....<grin>

     UnDel and multisector clusters
     From: WDTV5        To: ALL

Welp, I think I've got it working! As in I've got a couple of floppies
here that have been del *.* and then recovered by this UnDel till they
are about worn out. So before I leave tonight, I'm uploading this new
UnDel to go with the RBF patches that also enable multiplesector clusters.
Its been checked on disks whose cluster size ranged from 1 to 8 in powers
of 2.
Cheers all, Gene Heskett, WDTV5@delphi.com

                          Topic:Farna Systems
                          Speak with Frank Swygert of Farna Systems
                          Monday October 10, at 10:00 pm est

                       Come talk to Frank about what is in store for
   Farna Systems, and what is in store for those who buy from Farna.
   Farna is the publisher of perhaps the newest magazine dedicated to the
   Color Computer, OS-9, and anything related to the 68xxx
   microprocessor. It is one of the most popular magazines since the
   Rainbow, so if you are interested in learning more about this
   publication, as well as perhaps becoming a new subscriber, it may be a
   good idea to stop in and ask Frank anything you want to know.
                       Also, he has an impressive catalog of hardware and
   software, specifically for your Coco, such as the Rascan Digitizer,
   the Ken-Ton SCSI Controller, and the Coco Family Recorder. Come on in
   tomorrow night and find out more about Farna systems.

        See Ya

   Add my kudos as well!!! An excellent game!!! (I'll be spending toooo much
time playing it!!!!).

   BTW check with your local stationary supply for "Angler's Roslyn Handi-Loc
polybags". Stock # 5111C is a perfect fit for software packaging. At about $12
per 100 a good deal too!

    Thanks, Chris! The response you guys have given GR2 makes all the time and
effort I put into it well worth it.

the wrong 4 business supply stores. :)

     From: CHYDE        To: 01GEN40 (NR)

I don't think there is any documentaion for Shell+ 2.2.  For the most part
I think the docs came from the original Shell+ v 2.0 and all the other
versions just included ipatch code and readme files.  I couldn't seem
to find the origial in the database (but I didn't look very hard <g>), there
is v 2.1 in the applications area.  It's a rather large file so it may
have the docs with it.  Just do a rea shell+ v2.1 in the applications
area and download it.  If it doesn't have the docs I can email you a copy of
all the shell+ docs I have.
