Hello Bruce

The reason for being 18 times faster than OS/2 and not 4.5 times is because
we(os-9-peoble) call it for os-half. Sorry just joking.  OS-9 is the most
widely used 'hard-real-time' operating system for the 68K-family and for some
years ago also the 6809. It is one of the only that is selfhosted, which means
you can connect a floppy/harddrive and edit - compile -debug directly on your
target. A special version called RTOS is the hart/kernel in the CDI-players
from Philips. It is the second most sold real-time ope- rating system in the
World. Only the PDP-11's have sold more, and they are about to exit the field
due to age. It is also quite popular amongst pri vate people, because it is
multitasking,multiuser,realtime,romable and unixlike(on the io-system). I could
go on for ever......

OS9 is a multi-tasking, multi-user, realtime operating system originally
developed by Microware to run on the Motorola 6809 processor, and now running
also on 68XXX processors. They've also developed OS-9000, which runs on several

Hi all!

I'm new to OS-9, and this forum. My new company is redesigning its user
interface to be multi-tasking (from DOS), and we're going to switch to an
operating system.

We want to do real-time data acquistion (worst case: 600-700 Hz), display the
data graphically, have a GUI, etc., etc. etc. My question is this: while I
don't much care for Windows, should we go with the US flow, or should we go
Motorola and OS-9.

I expect a biased answer, since I'm asking this group, and I doubt that many
people out there even know about OS-9. I've been working as a software engineer
for 11 years, and I just heard about it. However, I'm leaning towards it, and
I'd like any reactions, facts, opinions, whatever about it.

Thanks for your time,

If OS-9 is good enough for NASA, etc. I too tend to think that it is fine.
There are a lot of embedded applications out there using OS-9, but you'd never
know it. There are good gui's available (g-windows, mgr, etc) and good solid
support (even though you do have to search out suppliers). Have you called
Microware and asked for some of their literature. Their 'OS-9 Catalogue' has a
lot of general and tech-type information in it.

Scott,

OS9 is a multi-user, multi-tasking realtime operating system developed by
Microware for Motrola processors (6809, and 68xxx). OS9 is a lot like Unix,
only better, IMO. OS9 is used quite a bit in embedded systems, a notable
example is the Phillip's CDI player, which uses a modified version of OS9. For
a lot more information, check out OS9FAQ.TXT in LIB 1.

Sb: problem with OS9K
Fm: Zack Sessions 71532,1555
To: all

I anyone aware of a known problem with using MS-DOS's DBLSPACE on a system
which is also running OS9K?

I have two hard drives now, a Conner 500M as drive C and a Seagate 120M as
drive D.

I have OS9K installed on drive D, which I can access and use just fine by
booting from the original installation floppy.

I can install MS-DOS on drive C and go back and for just fine.

UNTIL, I install DBLSPACE!!!! I can install DBLSPACE, create a compressed drive
E which uses free space on drive C and that works fine, UNTIL I then boot OS9K
with the installation floppy and run a directory command on /hd1.

With the VERY NEXT boot of MS-DOS, DBLSPACE refuses to mount drive E saying it
is too corrupted. And sure enough, the new 6.2 SCANDISK utility reports all
kinds of errors on BOTH drive C and E and the only recourse is to reformat and
start over with MS-DOS. OS9K's drive still appears to be unaffected and working
just fine.

Any thoughts, comments, ideas?

(Yes, I have just sent EMail to Microware's hotline, but don't expect a reply
until Monday or Tuesday.)

Sb: followup on os9k problem
Fm: Zack Sessions 71532,1555
To: all

After playing a little more, I have come to the conclusion that DBLSPACE is
not helping to cause the problem I am having.

I re-installed DOS 6, and upgraded to 6.2, ran SCANDISK and all was well.

I booted up OS9K from the installation floppy and did the following:

tmode nopause
chd /hd1
dir -ure

The directory display runs for a second or so, and then returns the error:

dir: can't open "CMDS/BOOTOBJS". Error #000:219

You know, of course, that a 219 is an E_IBA, illegal memory block address.

I immediately rebooted DOS. Since I had not yet installed DBLSPACE, there was
no indication from the boot that there was a problem, but a manual run of
SCANDISK on drive C showed the same type of problem I was seeing before.
SCANDISK reports that the backup copy of the disk's FAT was wrong and it
reported that a file was reporting its size incorrectly.

I rebooted OS9K and tried the same commands as before, with IDENTICAL results,
the 219 error on CMDS/BOOTOBJS. This time I recalled the command with a ^A and
this time the 219 error occured when it was trying to open CMDS, ie, the error
message was

dir: can't open "CMDS". Error #000:219

Running a dir with no switches ran OK and displayed the files in the root of
/hd1, but any subsequent use of the -r switch gave the 219 error on the CMDS
directory. What is strange is this. I then did:

chd /d0
chd /hd1
dir -ure

and it worked perfectly!! All the way through the entire file structure!!

So, bottom line here is that just getting a SINGLE 219 error somehow corrupts
something on the C drive, but I have no way of predicting WHEN I will get a
219 error, or what is causing it.

When I had just one 120M hd and it was partitioned 50/50, I ran and used OS9K
for weeks with no problems, that is, with the same 16M of memory I am using
now. The ONLY difference is that I have no OS9K partition on drive C and all
of drive D is an OS-9000 parition.

  I just been catching up on the messages here in the forum.  I don't know if I
fit
what you would call a power user but I am a beta site for Ultra C.  I use it to
do
all of my OS-9 Ports (drivers etc.)  To get really small code you must use the
SC
libs. and I-code link the files.  If you need an example makefile I can provide
one.  Basically you compile thru the IOPT phase to a I code modle, then ilink
with
the sclib.il libraries. When you run this thru the backend and final link the
code
should be considerably smaller or faster depending on the way you tweak the
knobs.  best results are with "-t=0  -i -j -n -iom" this should shrink your
application
considerably. BTW don't use this combination with anything other than 1.1.1.

Now, that is not a big problem unless you happen to be using register variables

If it doesn't say, its probably 8N1, 8 bits, no parity, one stop bit. If that

To: All

Anyone using "scred" has probably encountered that awful bug where
the system will crash about any time an ALT+KEY combination is pressed,
as well as F1.. really any MSB-set character.

I finally dug in and found it (I think).  Just fixed it last night, and
tried all kinds of combos & no crashes.  Here is a modpatch file to fix
it in memory, if you have the save utility (I believe a version is available
online if not(???)).  Simply cut between the cut lines and save to a file
(say.."scredpatch").  Then with scred in memory, enter the cmd
"modpatch scredpatch".  Then save it.  If you have save shell+, save to
an alternate file and then merge {thisfile} >-/dd/cmds/scred and you will
still have the original originate date.

This patch fixes the bug, increments the Edition #, and updates the version
# (screen printout) from 4.0 to 4.1.
*------------- CUT HERE ---------------
* Fixes bug in "scred" where alt-key crashes ???
l scred
c 0012 3c 3d
c 05db 2c 24
c 05f1 2e 22
c 05f7 2f 23
c 108d 30 31
v
*-------------- CUT HERE ----------------

If you do not have the save ability, you might create a B09 procedure to
open a copy of "scred", and with SEEKS and PUTS of these chars, you
can modify it.  In this case, you will need to change the CRC (the last 3
bytes) to $6E, $42, $88.

Hopefully, this will fix the prob...

Thanks Ed, I'll give Bob Hartage a call about the screen stuff.

BTW do you know if there is something akin to the xterm program that runs under
X for gwindows??? I would really like to get a jump scroll in a shell window in
gwindows and it seems like putting it into a terminal emulator (ala xterm) is
the accepted way to do it. I wasn't too familiar with X until recently but I
have done some programming in windoze and the app is responsible for jump
scrolling there. I guesssupII in X is just an app that will let you run shell
processes.

Are you still having problems with the screen port I did? I have my other
system back (as 68030 with SSM) and it works on that without any problems. Your
system IV shouldn't be doing anything all that differently....

Sb: realloc is broken
Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: All

A little while ago I posted a message suggesting that the realloc() function in
the MW C library might be broken. I wrote the following program to prove it one
way or another...yup, it is broke. I have not tested this with gcc or with
ultra (anyone?). The problem is that when the memory request fails and a NULL
pointer is returned the old memory should NOT be deallocated. In this case it
is. The "b=*bstart" causes a bus error (#102) on a machine protected with SSM.
If you don't have SSM don't feel safe...since the buffer has been deallocated
(memory returned to the system) other processes can now write over your buffer.
I suggest that you either don't use realloc() or do an immediate exit if it
fails or at the least mark the original memory as no longer avaiable. I had the
problem occur in one issue of Ved which I figured I was being very clever in by
using realloc(). I have now switched to the more sedate method of expanding the
buffer by always grabbing an entire new block of memory and copying the old
stuff into it. This is what realloc() does...but sometimes realloc() can just
expand the buffer and skip the copy. Feel free to cross-post this elsewhere if
you think it useful.

 #include <stdio.h>
 main()
 {
  char *bstart, *newbuf;
  char b;
  unsigned int t;

  for(t=1024, bstart=NULL; t<0xffffffff; t<<=1)
  {
   printf("bsize=%08x ",t);
   newbuf=(char *)realloc(bstart, t);

   if(newbuf)
   {
    bstart=newbuf;
    putchar('\n');
   }
   else
   {
    b=*bstart;          /* try to access OLD buffer area */
    puts("ALLOCATION FAILURE");
    exit(0);
   }
  }

Has anyone used curses?

I am porting a  program that I wrote in Unix and I am having a problem
getting the screen to scroll.  I have scrollok(stdscr, TRUE) and I am
using scroll() to scroll the screen.  When I get to the botttom of the
screen it just stays there and outputs on the bottom line.

Any comments would be appreciated.

P.S.  I wrote a small test using termcap and it works, but I need the
      window capabilities in curses.

Thanks.

Just a wild guess...but are you sending a CR or a LF to scroll the screen? You
might need the opposite to what you are using....

Thanks for the input regarding Curses.  I had checked that.  I got some
responses from another place that I left a message.  The Terminfo
version of curses is the one that I am having a problem with.  I just
got ncurses from the effo forum22 disk and that one does scroll properly,
but it is missing some of the functions that I need (I was able to create
some of them).  I will be testing a lot more regarding curses.

Thanks again.

Fm: Eric Crichlow 71051,3516
To: All

Fresh back from Winter CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas I thought
some of you might be interested in some of the info I got from the Philips
booth.

    First of all, the following info came from the only man at the show
knowledgeable in the hardware aspects of CDI, since everyone Philips staffed
there was only up on the software end of things. However, this man was "just"
the head of marketing, meaning his specialty still is not in hardware.

    In all the MM/1 accelerator card talk I thought it was said that the
Motorola 68340 was going to be in the next series of CDI players. The guy from
Philips, however, had no knowledge of the 68340 and said that the 68070 would
continue to be used, the only upgrade being the full motion video card (Digital
Video card), which, by the way, is being used for more than just showing movies
off of CD, they were demoing some games which used the Digital Video card. It
would be wise to take this info with a grain of salt, since, as this man
mistakenly thought that the 68070 was a Motorola chip, he could just as easily
be mistaken about the 68340.

    Now for the big question. I asked him about Philips' possible plans to
provide an upgrade for CDI players to become computers. He said that players
continue to be made with the expansion port for just such a possibility. In
fact, the idea is currently being investigated. The big holdup, according to
the marketing rep, is the US government. He said that, due to the possibility
of people being able to easily use a CDI computer to "capture" copywritten
images and use them for their own personal unauthorized use, the government is
reluctant to allow easy public access to such a device. It would seem to me
that doing such things is already childsplay with current computer hardware,
but that's what the man said. Because of this government resistance, he said
not to even expect an announcement on such an expansion product for another 2
to 3 years. He also says that he already knows of someone who has converted has
CDI player into a full fledged computer, and he *thinks* that that computer is
running under OS9.

    The final question I discussed with him was whether or not a CDI computer
from Philips would run OS9 as its primary operating system. He said that it was
a distinct possibility, but not definite.

<<<

Although Philips have no (public) plans for upgrading from the 68070, others
have already taken a lead.  The French company I2M are just about to launch
Nubus (for Mac) and ISA (PC) cards that comprise a complete CD-i player, based
on a 68340 CPU, so it runs a good deal faster than the Philips one.  This has
caused a deal of debate as to whether the performance increase is a Good Thing
since optimising for this unni_<<<iwtees your title won't run in base case.

Incidentally, using this kit the CD-ROM in your PC/Mac, provided it's the right
type (Sony is OK but strangely  hw Philips drive in the PowerCD is not),
becomes a CD-i drive.

Since the card runs CD-RTOS (= OS9+) only the hefty price tag stops it being an
attractive PC/Mac add-on for those dwelling in this forum.

Bob,

  > BTW, how is the game coming along?

    Its going rather well, actually. In fact, its going ALMOST better than
expected. I think when I released Gambit, the game board editor, I reported
that I didn't think it would be possible to do a full screen animated game in C
using Get/Put buffers. Well, now I don't think that's entirely true. Right now
the game is mostly done, and though it does slow down considerably when several
characters are on-screen, I think it still borders on playable, (I'm gonna have
to get some other peoples' opinions on that.) Of course, it helps if no other
major backgrund tasks are running.

    I do have to fess up that I'm planning on cheating a little. I don't have
OSK manuals, but as I understand it, the "memcpy ()" call in C copies data one
byte at a time. I want to do the copying with long words, which will mean
making some (I hope) minor modifications to the code in assembly. Unfortunately
I am assembly illiterate, so either I'll have to learn some assembly to
accomplish this, or find someone else who can do it. Or, perhaps there's a way
to access the assembly block copy commands from C? Like I said, I don't have
manuals.

    Anyway, as I said, the game's mostly done. The major things left to do are
building most of the game boards (and testing them,) and adding the sounds and
soundtrack, (if I determine that its feasible to have a soundtrack.)

    Thanks for asking. BTW, is KVED being advertised anywhere? I know it exists
but have yet to see any mention of it being available.

To:  all

Just uploaded a new version of GhostScript for OS9/68000 with a new KWindows
display driver.  The earlier one tends to crash the machine on complicated
graphics when the Gets and Puts start to trip over each other (I think).

The new KWindows driver also does color.  If you are using Ghostscript to check
Postscript text layouts, the older version is fine -- but if you want to see
what those graphics demos, like `tiger.ps', `escher.ps' or `snowflak.ps' REALLY
look like, try this.

NOTE - this program was compiled with the GNU GCC compiler on a 68340-equipped
9-meg MM/1.  It SHOULD run on a 3-meg 68070 machine.  I need one brave
volunteer to download it and report back.

Bob,
        To bypass the pause at the end of each page, put

  -dNOPAUSE

 in your command line.  This works for both printer and screen output.

Sigh, Yes and No.  We have OS source but encountered only 1 kernel bug, which
Microware fixed at our expense...  Support for libraries has been terrible, and
of course we have no source for those and ever since UCC appeared the stock
answer to every problem is "Oh, that's fixed in Ultra-C".   That's fine, but
IMHO UCC is not yet a usable product.  I did a search on Ultra-C message and
noticed you have had a few bumps with it yourself.

Our biggest fear was that the OS vendor would disappear off the face of the
earth, which Microware has not done yet, though I think their foray into CD-I
will leave them very wounded in the long run.
