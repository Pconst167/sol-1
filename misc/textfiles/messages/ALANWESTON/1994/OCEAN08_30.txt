David,
     The update disk should have a note telling a customer which floppy
drivers to use.  If one formats a floppy for larger size than the
bootlist /d0, /d1 includes it will not boot.  Thus he should use the
mm1.d0 and mm1.d1 descriptors which are for the full 1.44 meg floppy
drives.

I got the docs on KWindows in the mail.  Thanks!  I would be very
interested in getting Gem Quest back on the market.  It looks like the
KWindows graphic escape codes are the same as for the CoCo3 so I
shouldn't have any trouble making it a BGFX-free program.  Also, I saw
in the docs that KWindows also works on an Amiga running under OS9. 
Well, I have an Amiga and was wondering if you know where I can get OS9
for it?

It should be readily available in any B. Dalton's, Waldenbooks, Software
Etc., or whatever local bookstore or magazine chain is near you. Remember,
it's the September issue; if the issue you see has a mostly lime green
cover, that's the August issue.

(BTW, about the handling of messages to the list--as a recent message
shows, if the text of messages is fed through a shell and subject to
file name wild card expansion, it's going to be VERY hard to send any
code fragments to the list. (For that matter, will the contraction I
used a line or two back give the shell problems with quoted string
handling?) That's a bad restriction for a mailing list for software
developers, IMHO. If there's no other way to handle the mailing list,
perhaps if people knew whatever quoting conventions or escape sequences
are available, we could get around it.)

FasTrak is the Microware cross development software. It was mentioned
briefly in the Microware history article I wrote in MOTD, and may be
covered more extensively in a future article.

Essentially Fastrak allows you to develop OS-9 software on MSDOS and Unix
platforms.

For all those interested, the "ar9408..." stuff above was caused by a
wildcard expansion since the author of the message used an astrick
(star) character in his message. Normally, this expansion would be
about 100 times longer, but I personally purged most of the archived
messages taking up space so expansions will just be annoying rather than
several screens for each occurance!

Actually, I would very much like to have someone port over my latest
version to the MM/1.  It fixes some bugs and adds kneeling.  I can't
remember the name of the gentleman who ported over the first version. 
If you can find the docs, his name should be in it.  Maybe he would be
willing to do another port.  OR you could just send me an MM/1 and I
could write a super version! :) Just kidding.  Anyway, maybe we should
touch base over the phone.  My number is 513-251-4472.

You are correct... the clipboard must be mainstream. The proposal is
currently working under K-Windows, and general systems (non-graphics
systems) and is being ported to G-Windows as well, so this will let us
MM/1 owners who can run multiple windowing systems cut&paste between
software over windowing system boundaries, with supporting software.
Also, the standard is very flexible and easy to use, so it should be a
breeze for programmers to utilize. It should be available very shortly.

> The standard I wrote accomodated for text only, graphics

I have not thought too much regarding animation, but the standard is
expandable so there will be little trouble adding such a capability in
the future if the need arises.

Well, it's the program's responsibility for displaying the clipboard
data, but there are clipboard functions to actually get the data from
the clipboard and, say, draw the graphics data on-screen, so it really
isn't tough from the programmer's point-of-view.

No problem... I've received lots of great input from a great many
people, and it's helping make this a great proposal! Thanks!

Great job on GR2000, Eric... I love it, and the keyboard controls make
things so much easier to play. I hope it does well for you... you
certainly put enough graphics & sound in to increase its appeal.

The MM/1 Tech manual consists of 15 chapters covering the memory map,
and all the major chips.   This provides the most necessary information
for programming - though the use of multifunction (VSLI) chips has
forced the condensation of included information.  Still the addressing
of devices and what different registers are used for is essential for
using the machine to it's fullest.   It also includes addresses of the
manufacturers for those who want more indepth info on each chip. 
 
This manual runs about 100 to 125 pages in length.  Includes block
diagrams, though not schematics.   By Mark Griffith and Carl Kreider.

I've got a floppy drive that gives an error 247 unless you format 
a disk on the drive.  This descriptor is initialized on startup. 
 
Any ideas??

Clyde, I am a lot closer and willing to help! Last I heard from you was when 
you had a hard drive to install in the MM/1. I offered to do it for you and 
have not heard from you since. I'm still here and still willing to help!
Have you ever found the set of manuals that you mis-placed? They would be 
helpful! Give me a call, I have lots of free time!

Al,
        You've been on my mind, but I guess I had slipped more into the 
thought of sending the problem away hoping it would come back fixed. 
I'll definitely get in touch with you soon. I found the MM/1 User's 
manual, but even when following the directions exactly, I failed to 
create another boot disk. It's possible that most (all?) of the 
problems with this machine could be s
solved by making a GOOD boot disk.
  
        Anyhow, I now have a larger SCSI drive that I'd likue to add or 
exchange, and this would afford a good opportunity to update all my 
drivers-&-stuff.
  
        It might be after Labor Day before I can actually get together 
with you, but I'll try to have all my ducks in a row to be ready to do 
everything my little monster needs to have done.
  
        I really appreciate all the past help, and real soon I'll be 
appreciatin' for this round too.

OK Clyde, If we can't get it running properly then there's always a 
bunch of good help available at the CoCofest. I hope you have your 
weekend planned for October 1 & 2!!!! We do need more helpers and any 
pair of hands will do!

DG> Any OS-9 users around Dallas???

    Since this is the MM/1 echo
and it is not carried in the
Dallas/Fort Worth area I will
answer you question.

    There is a very active club in
the D/FW region. About 25+
members.

    Some you should have met at
Chicago.

    David Wordell
    Wayne Thompson
    Lee Veal

    There is no MM/1 there but
there is a Kix 70 and a System IV.

    Most of the members use OS9.
David Wordell read the OS9 echo if
you wish to contact some of them.

David,
     I recall a similar thing with an earlier version of the driver for
the floppy.  If I, say, did a dir of /c1 on a 720 disk then put in a 1.44 
disk I would get the error and could cure it by calling format /d1 then
aborting the format. Naturally when I put in the 1.44 disk I used /d1.
Hope this helps.

Ok 11 it will be but what are you talking about?? 11 what?  I'll just look 
back in the mail to see if that is the time slot you prefer.
Just pulling your leg David!

Clyde, I'd be happy to reintegrate the system for you.  My service
charge is $35/hour.   (about 1/3 what the DOS guys around here charge.)
And it should not take long, assuming that your problems are software
related.  Hardware stuff might be a problem.  On the Hard drives - what 
models are they, and do you have the documentation for them???

Has anyone come up with a reset-proof ram disk driver for the MM/1
yet?

If so, could I _please_ obtain a copy?
