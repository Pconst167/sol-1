??!?! You should look around.  I think the Stylus 800 these days is less
than that...<dig, dig>  Yup, USA*FLEX in the April 94 *Computer Shopper*
quotes $249 for the Stylus 800, and $229 for the Stylus 300.  Looks like
that's counting a mail-in rebate, so it's a good idea to check the fine

Make a point of finding someone who has the printer, and ask said person
if he or she could run it with some program configured to output the
stuff appropriate for the kind of Epson printer MAX-10 supports.  I find
that when I try to print out an UltiMusE score on the Stylus 800, it comes
out looking pale gray, and I'm not sure why.  (One wild guess that just
came to mind--gee, do you suppose that it's spitting out 360 dpi sized
dots at 1/72 inch intervals?)

Terry, an observation from the last Atlanta fest:  It looks to me like
there has been a major shift in buying patterns towards L2 OS-9 and OSK.

For example, the Northern Xposure booth had a mix of products for DECB,
L2 OS-9, and OSK.  I just spoke with Colin, and he estimates that about
95% of his sales were L2 OS-9 and OSK.  Although he had some nice stuff
for DECB (including the Oblique Triad games), these customers were
just browsing, and not spending money.

The 95% OS-9/OSK breakdown was roughly 60% for OSK, 40% L2 OS-9.  The
OSK users are the ones who are investing in their systems.

Bob van der Poel also remarked that he was quite surprised by the division.
At the Mid-West fest a few months before, his sales had been mostly
L2.  But in Atlanta they were very much dominated by OSK.

I also suggest that the OSK version be made generic (not K-Windows
specific).  I have noticed the number of non-MM/1 users has been growing
over the last year.

 > My fears always were if it were ported to

Actually, it is just the opposite:  the Operating System should be an
"enabler", allowing the programmer to concentrate on the application,
rather than on details of how to read a directory, read/write a file, etc.
DECB (I consider it a Basic programming environment rather than a DOS, so
avoid the misnomer "RS-DOS") is extremely weak in providing programmer
support.

With a 64K CoCo, your observation of the disk drive having to do a lot of
work is right on target. you can only load so much into 64K (heck, even 128K!)
and still have room for a program to function properly. Does Home-Pak OS-9
require 512K? Actually, if all you're doing is running that single program and
not trying to do someth
ing else at the same time, 128K is sufficient. It's when you try multi-tasking
or loading enough commands for a general purpose system that you run out of
memory fast. When I use my 512K boot, I have 384K left after I load some
general, much used commands.
 I did nearly the same on a 128K system, and only had 40K left.... not even
enough to format disks!

  Re: Granted DECB is pretty much ended for Fests.  And the trend
toward OSK seems to be more dominate in (do we still call 'em)
CoCo-Fests?  However this is "Fests".  The communuty at large is
still buying both some DECB and more OS-9.

  I keep saying the route to success and sales, is diversity.  With
our (The UPGRADE) support; having the broad base support in mind:
The Van der Poel statement doesn't surprise me.  I keep telling
vendors there is a good market for OS L2.  Yet most ad requests go
of the edge of the earth.  But the CoCo market place has never made
good marketing sence.  No reason to change now.
  I think really, though some may not like to admit it,,, what we're
talkimg about here is a hobby.  "Be it user or vendor".  And if the
vendor happens to like his OSK (which many do), that's what he'll
sell and support.  (irreguardless of what he could sell)  In America
we can do that.
   And remember to some; The Fests represent, the community.  For
others it's certain mags, Fidonet, or Delphi.  To me they all
comprise the CoCo community.   end of speech (ain'tcha glad)

  Anyhue,,, Home-Pac though a very nice and powerful home manager,
is a highly practical program.  I learned (grin) how that goes over
in a Rainbow Fest booth next to MAXSOUND playing Startrek routines.
  As my prospective buyer heres Captian Kirk bellowing,, he sez,,
lemme get back in a minute.  GIMMESOFT flew home and bought his
Lazor Printer that year.  So it goes,,,,
  Finally Ken,, I'd agree this home-management package would sell a
few in OSk.  Problem is; the author has only OS-9, and if you can
understand,,, we're not yet itching for a chance to pass out source
code.  Hopefully there will be a few CoCo'ists, at the CoCo Fest.

Which chess programs have you seen, and what would you say makes for a good
chess program?  The only thing that comes to my mind is Chris Burke's package
that does for a cartridge chess program for the CoCo 3 what he did for Color
BASIC some years ago, but you may have already seen that one.

Any chess program is necessarily a major time cruncher, walking all those
game trees and evaluating positions.  You'll probably have to drop the
priority on any chess game you run while you're downloading.

Chris Burke (Burke & Burke) sells a product he calls "World Class Chess"
for the CoCo3 and OS-9 Level 2. It requires that you have the Cyrus
Chess cartridge which was produced for the CoCo3. It's my impression
the way it works is that you run some setup type program which copies the
necessary contents of the cart to an disk file. It either patches this
file with the necessary code to make it work under Level 2, or there
is then a "front end" which accesses this disk file to play the game.
Either way, it is Chess for OS-9 Level 2. Last price I am aware of
was $29.95 for Chris's program. I have no idea as to the availability
of the Cyrus cart. It still may be availble by mail order as a lot of
CoCo3 software still is.

There is a program called GNU Chess which has been ported to OS-9/68000
and works fine, but I doubt if it can be ported to OS-9 Level 2. The
main program is just under 200K and when it is running eats up just
under 700K!!! I guess with the new 1 and 2 meg CoCo's it might be possible,
but how many CoCoists who are still around have 1 and 2 meg systems?

shamless plug follows:

At the Chicago Fest I will be unveiling K-Windows Chess which is a GFX
front end for GNU Chess. Total point and click interface with full color
graphics. Requires a 3M MM/1 (or more) running Edition #51 or greater
of K-Windows.

Mike,

I have "World Class Chess" by Chris Burke of Burke & Burke.  I think I paid
$29.95 for it about 2 years ago.  Zack Sessions (COLORSYSTEMS) is correct.
It requires the Tandy "Cyrus Chess" cartridge.  By the way, the Cyrus
Chess cartridge does NOT by itself run on the CoCo III.  Maybe it was a
CoCo II program?
In any case, the "World Class Chess" program instructs you as to how to
"unload" the cartridge "Cyrus Chess" program to a disk (floppy).  After
this is accomplished, the diskette becomes your chess diskette.  I find
the graphics very good for the CoCo - certainly fast enough for a game of
chess - it is also possible to select a fast or slow speed if one should want
to play
speed chess.
The board has settable colors, the program has 9 levels of play.  I am
an average chess player, and I find it to be a better than average
chess player - as good or better than most computer chess games -
except for the most expensive ones available for more powerful computers.
The program is MUCH better than the program which comes bundled with OS2
for the IBM compatibles.  "Cyrus Chess" also allows you to set up the
pieces in any configuration for solving chess problems.  You can store
and recall games or games in progress, making it perfect for chess by
mail as well.  The Cyrus chess cartridge is probably available from
Tandy though I have not checked recently.  If it is not available through
normal channels, check with your store manager for the special order
catalog mentioned here in a thread authored by TOMFANN.

The only deficiency in the "World Class Chess/Cyrus Chess" package which
I have found is pawn promotion will only allow you to promote a pawn to
a Queen, even though the program asks you which piece you would like.
That is the only bug.  Otherwise, I have spent many hours battling
"Cyrus".  He anticipates your moves about 8 or 9 moves ahead and even
allows you to read the constantly updated move analysis or turn it off
if you prefer.  I think this program is a great bargain.

I hope you can find a copy.

Bill

I have seen Chris burkes software for that cartridge, the game play is

I have seen various chess program on other systems (but I am no means
pretending we could get something like that for the CoCo) I am not
concerned with flashyness of the game graphics for whatever, just so
long as it plays a decent game of chess at higher levels.. A game that
could play at grandmaster chess level would be great, but I dont expect to

Sorry, Ted, we've been through this one before in the forum.

The 31 KHz output mode on the MM/1 is pretty much a USELESS capability
which provides a half-width, double-height display.  To use a VGA monitor
on the MM/1 in any practical way will require a new hardware interface
and new driver software.  Until these become available, only 15.75 KHz
monitors will be of any use.

Took me a bit of digging through the Forum, but there was a thread on
"MM1 graphics".  At least one message in there (81248 from MITHELEN/Paul
Jerkatis) mentioned the uselessness of the 31.5 KHz modes on the MM/1 --
I was going to post something then as well, but Paul beat me to it ;-)
I have the Signetics docs for the VSC chip here, and that mode just gives
you a tall, narrow display that wouldn't be of much practical use.

The driver doesn't support it for the following reasons:
 1) to keep a hapless user from blowing his 15.75KHz monitor
 2) it wouldn't be much use, anyways.

 > Would a driver be capable of

No.  Well, I guess maybe if you were willing to live with only having a
48-column (in overscan mode) display...

 I'm getting on my soapbox so you might want to skip this message.

 The author of PGP is Phil Zimmerman.  He may be a little hard to reach since
 he could be in jail by now.

 It seems that someone OTHER than Zimmerman posted PGP to internet ftp sites
 that are accessible from outside the U.S.  Our freedom-loving government
 deccided that this violated Export Regulations Regarding Encryption and
 decide to haul Zimmerman into court over it.

 This action has put a damper on PD software using any kind of encryption
 being distributed and is, I think, a blatant attempt by the government to
 clamp down on "independent" programmers and bring them "into line".

 Governments are going to do their best to control whatever the currency of
 power in the world happens to be.  Four hundred years ago it was religion
 and every government in the world regulated what church you could go to and
 when and where you had to pray.

 Today the currency of power is technology.  With the advent of the personal
 computer, a large part of that technology became controllable by individuals
 without requiring large investments.  This effectively bypassed the
 'traditional' controls on things like "freedom of speech and of the press".
 With a computer and a dot matrix printer anybody can go into the newspaper
 business.  Even this message represents the new freedom that the personal
 computer brought.  Not only will it be read by many more people than would
 have seen it before the advent of cheap online sevices but is much more
 difficult to censor.

 Believe me, modern governments just HATE it when they don't have control
 over everything.  The push for 'standardization' of hardware and operating
 systems and the whole Information Superhighway are two examples of how
 government is trying (succeeding) in establihing it's control over the
 technology of computers.

 BTW, I noticed source for DES on chestnut - wonder how long it'll take Big
 Sister to close them down.

Problem with ANY  math module is that the software has to know it's there then
be able to take advantage of it. I had seen floating point units in industrial
controller catalogs for 6809 controllers and wondered where it came from, as
Motorola doesn't list one. I recently ordered some 68000 lit, and there it
was! "designed to be accessed by 8 to 16 bit processors". And the indication is
that it can be accessed by ANY processor, not just 68000 (though it doesn't
specifically state that, it does lead one to that conclussion). But software
would have to be written specifically for the 68881. Do that and you could evne
use it with an Intel pr
ocessor! Least it could do something right then!

     Help with LZH files
     From: 10BAUD       To: ALL

I can't decompress lzh files that I have downloaded from DELPHI.
I have lzh 1.0 which I downloaded from DELPHI on Nov 11, 93.
Every time I try to use 'lzh x' I get a CRC error on every file.
The file that has the CRC error is created but contains garbage.

I have also tried to use a command called unlzh.  It tells me that
there is an extended header of length 15.

This behavior has been consistent on a number of .lzh files.

I have been using y-modem batch in Osterm, which has always worked
for .ar files.

lzh.10 isn't what everyone is using now, get lha2_11 I think its called.
Do a "sea lha" in the database and it should fall out, the key string is
the 2.11 or 2_11b.  lzh.10 was Matt Thompsons, and while it did a nice job
of smashing and reinflating its own files, was not compatible with the rest
of the industries header information.  The lha can inflate almost any machines
output that has an .lzh extension. That should handle the problem. Cheers.

I've had similar experiences. "unlzh" will decompress them though, right?

I feel that lzh 1.0 has problems handling exttended headers or something.
I also found that if you compress files with 1.0, if you don't use the
"e" option, to suppress the extended header that 1.0 adds (see docs), other
LHA's cannot expand them. (I caused an MS-Dos system to crash with a file with
the extended header that I uploaded).  I would suspect that 1.0 needs a little
more work.

Actually the Eliminator had a proprietary interface that used a

used a WD2797 controller chip.  I have a few of these controllers and
at least 2 have been tested as good.  I also have access to a person
who still has a Coco 3 / Eliminator system up and working.

The Disto HD II and the Disto 4-in-1 had an interface that could be
used with SASI controllers or with SCSI drivers.  I believe Kenton
also had a SCSI interface for the Coco 3.

I also have a Disto SASI system up and running if anyone needs a little
help, plus some spare Disto stuff....

I probably have a few 512K upgrade lying around too... Someday I
will have to inventory and get rid (i.e., "sell Cheap") of this

Ah, no. Not with the CoCo as we know it. The Gime chip is responsible for the
video display. It takes the data in the designated video ram, and assembles the
picture. It then puts this picture out to the three video ports concurently.
 SO, though I see no reason you couldn't run a RGB, a composite, and a normal
TV all at the same time, you would get the exact same picture on all three
monitors.

  However, if some enterprising young fool would design and market a VGA-style
video card to go into the cartridge port, then what you want would be possible.
That's what it's gonna take, though. A complete seperate video port with it's
own memory.

Actually, all it would take is drivers for the VGA card, an 8-bit PC
VGA card would work fine with the coco, all you would need is the CoCo-XT
interface from B&B, however, I too doubt the software will get written..
HOWEVER.. there IS a way to use a mono monitor with an RGB monitor at
the same time, with different displays in each, Randy forgot about the
WordPAK cards.. you could get a Wordpak and have that drive the mono
monitor, and have the RGB monitor display something else, however
you wont be able to run SuperComm on the Mono monitor, as it uses OS-9
controls and such that wont display on the wordpak monitor. You could
use another terminal program though.. if you are interested in buying
a wordpak, I will look around and see if I can find one for you..
I know a few local guys that might have one or two..

not entertaining ;)  I have been looking at many different 68XXX based
machines besides the ones discussed here. This has sent me to many Internet

systems with other users, I found myself going on about the capabilities
of OS-9. So much so that I realized that I have no reason to leave the
OS-9 community. I also notice that the OS-9 forum usually has many more
forum messages than other forums with considerably more content to be
gleaned. The OS-9 SIG is much more special than I originally realized.

I use the HP DeskJet 500 on my CoCo and the 500c on my UNIX box, both
printers give real nice output, and there are a good amount of font
cartridges for it there is also an epson emulation board, to allow
compat. with programs that drive epson printers, I have the 256k RAM
upgrade cart. for the HP 500, and an external font cart. There is a
screen dump in the databases for the HP 500, so, overall the HP
is a pretty good printer for the coco, as you are only concerned with
text, I would possibly lean more toward a cannon bubblejet for text..
these are both inkjet printers..which give high quality output, I havent
looked to much to lasers..
