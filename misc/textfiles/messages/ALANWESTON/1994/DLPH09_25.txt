 Why not?  Everything else in the state is.

 Seriously, both MCI and Sprint are very unreliable at 9600 out here.  I've
 complained to them several times and they keep putting the blame on Delphi.
 Delphi claims the problem is with MCI or Sprint - whichever I had the latest
 problem on.  I think it must be that new "Tattler" the government has
 patrolling the Info Sighway.

".gz" is a GNU-Zip (or gzip) file. It is very much like "compress" (even
handles compress ".Z" files) but does MUCH better compression. gzip is
usuallt used in conjunction with tar (or gtar), since gzip itself
does not make archives (just compresses/decompresses)

That's the default extension for gzip or gnuzip.


*-  rmUIX tar'd files
 that use hyphens in the directory/file names - it converts them to
 underscores.  I may have it but can't remember the name.  It uses the
 following rule -

 BEGIN
 {
    if (match( $1, @[FILE-ABC]@ ) )
       $1 = "FILE_ABC";
 }

 Do you know the program I'm referring to and where it can be found (just in

The CD-i can be hooked to your TV or to some monitors.
My new cheaper model has an external RF Modulator for connection to
the TV but I don't use it since I am connected to an old CoCo Color

     Syscall+Basic09
     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL

        I am reading (yet again) the tech section of the OS-9 Level Two
   manual and am trying to make sense of a lot of the syscall stuff I was
   trying to understand before. Online forums are really the only place I
   can get further information relating to this. The Tech manual makes a
   great reference section, but does not, as I said before, supply
   anything to the novice who needs to understand more about how syscall
   works before attempting too much. I am just listing some
   miscelleaneous questions here that are popping up regarding syscall.

        1)   There are many prefixes to the calls, which causes confusion
   as to what goes with what else. For instance there are File Descriptor
   related calls(FD) and Path descriptor calls(PD) in the RBF part. What
   is the difference between these. Is there any relation between these
   and the other calls such as those that begin with
   "V.","IT.","F$","I$", etc...

        2)   What is the Path number, which is normally option letter 'A'
   in the calls I read, associated with? What's it for?

        3)   Do you pretty much have to have a knowledge of Assembly
   Language in order to understand System calls?

        In David Breedings reply to me, where he supplied me with the
   undocumented(can you believe it) SS.FD call, it goes as follows:
        A=path #(again, what would that be?)
        B=$0F (wouldn't this already be specified in 'Run Syscall'
   command parameter?)
        X=ADDR(buf) (I imagine in my case of filename, the variable
   'Fname' would go in the 'buf' section?)
        Y= # of bytes to read (How does one know?)


        Sorry about the unlimited amount of ignorance here, but it seems
   no matter what,I still wind up lost. David's previous message did make
   things look a little easier, but I was still pretty useless when it
   came to applying it. Does anyone see where I'm coming from?

OK...like the poem says, today we have Naming of Parts. :-)

First, though, you need to know what an OS-9 system call really is
underneath.

On the 6809, an OS-9 system call is implemented as follows:

  SWI2
  <number>

The <number> is a real live numeric value that the operating system
can look at, because the SWI2 (software interrupt) saves the address
of what would normally be the next instruction--the operating system
looks there, picks up the value, and uses it to decide which system
call the user wants.

The F$, I$ are symbols that are defined in assembly language header files,
and via those in a library that you can link against.  Those symbols
are defined to have the numeric values that get plugged in after the
SWI2.  There's one of them for each system call, and they're named to
suggest the system calls they represent.

The FD., PD., V., and so forth, are different.  They are also symbols
defined in assembly language header files, but they are NOT system
call numbers; they are offsets of fields in various system-related
data structures, such as file descriptors or path descriptors.

 > 2)   What is the Path number, which is normally option letter 'A'
 > in the calls I read, associated with? What's it for?

When you write in BASIC09, for example,

   OPEN #path,"/p":WRITE

path has to be a variable.  The OPEN statement stores a value there.
That value is a path number.  A path number is a number OS-9 gives
you to when you open a file, the idea being that whenever you want
to do something to an open file, you have to identify it by the path
number.

(PEDANTRY ALERT: a path is in a way an entity unto itself, since you
can do things to it, e.g. I$Dup.  It's a connection to an open file.)

 > 3)   Do you pretty much have to have a knowledge of Assembly
 > Language in order to understand System calls?

All you really have to know is the interface.

 > Y= # of bytes to read (How does one know?)

You know because you look at the description of the file descriptor
sector layout in the manual, decide how much of that you need in order
to get the information you want, and use that size to put in the
(image of) the Y register.

 > Sorry about the unlimited amount of ignorance here

You do yourself an injustice.  You know what questions to ask, so
we're talking a quite limited, and shrinking, amount of ignorance
here.  (Even if I totally botch the explanation, there are others
who can do it right, so I'm sure about the shrinking part. :-)

Refer to JEJONES's reply.. Basically, if you are dealing with a file,
and after having opened it, OS9 automatically attaches a path # to
it, and when you open the path, it is up to you to keep up with it..
Normally, in Basic, you will want to have a variable, say, "pth", and
it can either be BYTE or INTEGER, and when you issue the command
         OPEN, #pth, "myfile" --- you can also include an access mode,
  (READ,WRITE, UPDATE), (update = read OR write), or if not specified,
  it will be opened in UPDATE mode, I believe.  If the open (or CREATE,
I forgot that, works the same)..  is successful, the path # will be
stored in the variable "pth".

These refer to the CPU registers.  To execute a system call, several of
these registers will need to be loaded with certain values, and some
calls use more registers than others.. BUT.. in all cases, REGISTER A
will ALWAYS contain the path #.  Also, in the case of the GetStt/SetStt
calls, REG B will ALWAYS contain the value assigned the "SS.???" call.

Before executing SysCall, you will have to set up a data structure
as follows :

   TYPE registers=cc,a,b,dp:BYTE;X,Y,Y:INTEGER
   DIM Reg:registers  \  (* this assigns a variable Reg defined by
          the structure "registers"

to mimick the registers.  You then assign each unit with whatever value
is appropriate.. the above SS.FD call would be set up as:
   Reg.a := pth \  (* Using my above example
   Reg.b := $0F \  (* for neatness, you might previously define a BYTE
      variable SS_FD and set it equal to $0F, then you would say
      "Reg.b := SS_FD.. You can't use "SS.FD", since Basic confuses this
      with a structure member like Reg.b.
   Reg.X := ADDR(buf) \ (*  Where buf is a buffer large enough to hold the
      File descriptor data.
   Reg.Y := (the # bytes you want to read into buf.

Now, for neatness, I like to define my syscall #'s..  I would set up
a variable (either BYTE or INTEGER) I_GtStt, and then, I_GtStt:=$8D.

To do the syscall, then, you would:  RUN SysCall(I_GtStt,Reg).

Hope this helps...

     OS-9 Last Night
     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL

        Last night's OS-9 Late Night was another great conference. It
   wasn't quite so busy as the first one, but we had a steady flow of
   people(about 7 people in the room at a time average), and a lot of
   good conversation. Mike Rowen was telling us about how he got his ESDI
   Hard Disk system from Radio Shack. He had trouble getting it to work
   on the Coco and it was realised that he would have to write a whole
   new driver for it. Probably not worth the effort, as was said in
   Conference. It was good in that Rick Uland and Steve Ricketts both
   added a lot of harddrive and HD interface information that I found
   interesting, since I knew nothing about it beforehand, such as the
   difference in the Ken-Ton and Burke&Burke HD controller/interface.

        There was also more discussion about the possibility of writing
   an API or similar set of programs that would allow the OSK programmer
   to write a program that could run on any Windowing
   system(Kwindows,Gwindows,XWindows,Rave,etc). This would allow users to
   run any program that is written for this API, on the Windowing GUI of
   his choice. This is unlikely to happen anytime soon, but I would love
   to see it.

        Don't forget, next week Newton White of the Atlanta Computer
   Society will be with us for our 'See U In Atlanta' conference! This is
   for those who want to discuss Cocofests and more specifically, the
   upcoming Atlanta Fest this October. The ACS is once again sponsering
   the event and this is a good time to ask questions if you are
   interested in attending, and is also good for nostalgic talk of the
   fests of yesterday and the discussion of the future of these great
   events. Again if you are interested in attending the Atlanta fest,
   this is the place to be. Monday September 19, at 10:00 Eastern.
        Also, this Saturday, September 17 at 10:00 Pm Eastern time is
   going to be another OS-9 Live! w/Boisy Pitre. The subject is going to
   be, 'The Future of Personal OS-9' and I encourage anyone who can
   attend to do so. With the return of the MM/1 and the rise of
   commercial applications being made available for it, the consistent
   availability of The Delmar and FHL Systems, and the successfull rise
   of CD-I, we will have plenty to talk about!

Thanks for the kind words, Chris!  It was a fun program to write, and I
really was tired of balancing my checkbook by hand, also!  The graphs were
just an after-thought and something I did for fun.  (Not many people need
graphs of their checking accounts!)  I mainly wanted to try my hand and
(at) circle-graphs, line-graphs, and bar-graphs.

Again, thanks for the note.

Well, it is really funny since the software I have (and have used) I cannot
use in the "school" computer because it is not "board approved".  Yet I can't

I don't know, it sounds pretty typical of the bureaucratic mind set.  This of
course says something for the small school district at least we knew all
the board members (some where neighbors), so board approval was a little
easier (though probably not much <g>).

Well, it seems that the story is (might be) that someone was doing taxes on
their laptop during school time.  It was a second job for them.  They got
busted and in typical knee-jerk reaction someone down the board offices
banned all personal computers owned by teachers.  Yeah.......and when I
drive a car I get arrested because sometime in the future I could be involved
in an accident.  Of course, there is added pressure since the state is
running the system and this is their last year so they gotta look good.
Unforch (for them), the state takeover was an utter disaster so they are
over sensitive to any "problems" that will tarnish their image.

Most of the colleges and universities around here also require them for
students who are taking "techinical" and science majors.  I did find out more
though.  Seems some one had a "prepare your taxes" business and their were
doing their second job work at their first job.  Friday, I was in a training
session for the network in school (more like a sales pitch) and I mentioned
the ban.  The person in charge is going to look into it and put out his own
SOP memo to cancel the other one.  (Now bring up the music for "Dualing
Paperwork")  This is getting interesting (grin).

     Windows95 ???
     From: FHOGG        To: ALL

For your enlightened entertainment,

When I spotted this I had to read it 3 times before I beleaved it.

I read the following in the September 12th 1994 issue of Infoworld on
page 10. The title of the piece is: "It's official: Chicago will be
called Windows95"  The article describes why Microsoft decided on the
name Windows95 rather than Windows 4.0 because...

"According to Microsoft, users had difficulty understanding which
version of Windows, 3.0, 3.1, or 3.11 was the latest."

Explains a lot doesn't it.

However we must ask the question. Which came first?

Do stupid people buy Windows or does using Windows make people stupid?

I'll let you decide.

For what it's worth, I think having different products with the same name is
a detriment that really does lead to confusion. It also limits the potential
lifespan of a product. Novell, for example, came out with a different version
of NetWare and called it 4.0. Just looking at the product catalog, you might
think NetWare 4.0 is anewer version than NetWare 3.11 where, in reality, the
two are unrelated. Perhaps NetWare 4.0 should have been called NetWare Plus
to separate it from the NetWare 3.11.

Could be, Frank. I think research proved years ago that backwards byte
ordering causes a mind warp in programmers that trickled down to the end
users. I think the overall effect is causing technology to reverse so it may
not be too much longer before we're back to the 8088. :-)

Hi Frank,
  I read about this very thing in the computer magazine in our local
newspaper here in San Diego, just last week.  I say, if someone can-
not figure that the higher the number the newer the version, there is
something wrong.  I do not see any logic in what Microsoft is doing
unless this problem is with thier own people.  A number is just a num-
ber, either higher or lower than the ones on either side of it.
  I use Windows (3.1) at work for one thing, playing games during slack
time.  T me, that is all Windows is good for.  There should be an "o"
after the "T" in the above sentence.
  Here is a little diversion for those of you that have access to the
use of Windows 3.1 (other versions are different).  In 3.1, hold down
the SHFT-CTRL keys at the same time while opening HELP on any of the
Windows moduals.  Click on About (modual) and double click on the
ICON in the upper left hand corner. Enjoy! See ya.  Oh, one more thing,
you may have to do the above more than once since sometimes it will
not work all the time.  Al, make sure that you press SHFT-CTRL at
all times through the above procedure.

     OS9000 - descriptors
     From: EDELMAR      To: JEJONES

 James,

 I have a question which I hope you can and are willing to answer; hoping
 you don't find answering to be a conflict with your work at MW.  It
 requires your expertise re MW's C Compilers.  I'm asking here on the forum
 because I believe others can benefit from this information.

 To set the stage - we're dealing with OS-9000, descriptors, Ultra-C and
 1.1 C.  I have Ultra-C installed and had removed 1.1 C.

 I installed a fax/modem board and to get it to work under MSDOS, had to
 change the IRQ (comm 3) to IRQ 5.  This meant changing the descriptor for
 T3 under OS-9000.  (Made the change in the systype.h file.)  When I went to
 compile the new descriptor, it bombed out.  Went back to the Ultra-C manuals
 and found a sentence stating "Makefiles and shell scripts which reference
 'cprep', 'c386', or 'o386' with the Version 1.1 C compiler are guaranteed
 not to work with Ultra C.".  OK, it was obvious from inspection that the
 makefile was written for version 1.1.  I tried to re-write the makefile
 for Ultra-C but was unsuccessful.  Called MW's tech support people Monday
 morning and outlined the problem and asked if they had a makefile for Ultra-C.
 They called me back later and informed me they did not have a makefile for
 Ultra-C; I had to use 1.1 C to compile the descriptors.  (I re-installed
 1.1 C and everything compiled fine - port works.)  Unfortunately, when they
 called back, I had umpty-ump things going on and wasn't able to dig as
 deeply as I should have.  I think he said that Ultra-C needed a different
 header file but I'm not sure.  Can you enlighten me on this - or what is the
 problem?

 For those who haven't dug into this, the descriptors for OS-9000 are written
 in C - not assembler.  And, OS-9000 does not include 'moded'.

 Thanks,

 Ed

Thanks a lot!  I spent WAY too much time this weekend "having fun" <g>.
Thought I would follow up and let you know the results.

I tried running the files on several different telecom packages to get
a comparison, and so that I could have a "frame of reference" to see
any problems that might occur.

I set up my '386 running Telix V3.12 (shareware) and the Windows 3.1
"Terminal" accessory (which I will call "WinTerm" for short).

On the MM/1, I tried OSTerm/68K V2.2.0 and V2.2.1, as well as a port of
Brian Marcotte's "vt100" program and a beta copy of KTerm.

I quickly dropped "vt100", after having to reboot twice after using it.
("000:171 (E$Damage) System data structures have been damaged." following
one attempt...)  I also decided to drop KTerm from the sample, since
I only had the beta version, and that version didn't even really claim
any VT100 capabilities.  (We'll let John D. or David G. cover the
official release.)

There was a fairly noticeable difference between OSTerm V2.2.0 (the official
distributed version most users have), and V2.2.1/beta.  The V2.2.1 was
created to fix some problems reported by Boisy and JEJ.  These "movies"
seemed to trigger several of the changed areas.  Guess we're going to have
to try to package this update for release RSN...  (V2.2.1 has only had
limited distribution.)

So, most tests were with OSTerm/68K V2.2.1, Telix, and WinTerm.

Known limitations of these Emulation packages:
==============================================
 - OSTerm:
     - does not support double-height/double-width characters
     - does not support support alternate/special/line drawing character
       sets.
     - Due to the lack of "blinking characters" on the MM/1, these are
       shown using bold font.
   (Note:  Since we want to port OSTerm to non-KWindows environments, we
   specifically decided NOT to incorporate these capabilities at this
   time.  A bug in K-Windows pushbuttons is another contributing factor...)

 - Telix:
     - does not support double-height/double-width characters

 - Windows Terminal ("WinTerm")
     - Specific info not available; but from tests:
        - does not appear to support "blinking characters".  They seem to
          show as bold.
        - does not appear to support "newline" mode.

========
 - General notes:
     1) OSTerm only used the standard character set, and substituted these
        characters for the VT100 special/line-drawing set.  This is
        standard behavior for all test files, and should be assumed below.
     2) As stated above, only WinTerm supported double-height,
        double-width characters.  Telix and OSTerm behaved similarly when
        these sequences appeared (e.g., "fireworks", "xmas"), displaying
        double-height characters as duplicated vertically.
     3) Some of the files required "newline" mode to be set externally to
        the file.  For OSTerm, this is a menu option (or can be set by
        host).  For Telix, I sent the sequence "ESC [ 2 0 h" prior to
        sending the file.  I could not find a way to set "newline" mode
        for WinTerm (may not be supported).

 - "beer"
     - Much of the graphics info was missing under WinTerm.  This may
       have been due to the use of a monochrome monitor (?).
 - "duck", "moon", "sun", "twilight":
     - No special notes.
 - "cobol":
     - See note 3 above (newline).
     - Without "newline" mode, WinTerm performed poorly.
 - "fireworks":
     - See note 2 above (double-size).
     - Both Telix and OSTerm left some "firework debris" on the screen,
       which may result from double-height/double-width characters.
       Telix also seemed to leave noise from unimplemented VT100
       sequences.
 - "fish":
     - required "newline off" for OSTerm.
 - "outer_limits":
     - See note 2 above (double-size).
     - OSTerm performed an extra scroll around the start of the "sine wave".
     - WinTerm did not handle the "soft blur" as well as Telix, due to the
       poorer special/line character set (or possibly the monochrome
       monitor again).
 - "ship":
     - See note 3 above (newline).
     - Without "newline" mode, WinTerm was an absolute mess.
     - OSTerm did not "sink the ship".  It was confused by the
       "1B 5B 48 0A 1B 1B 1B 1B ... 1B 1B 1B 1B 5B 48 1B 4D 0A 1B ..."
       sequences used to create delays; the odd number of $1B's caused
       it to get out of sync and display the "[H" and "[1;25r" commands.
       Replacing one $1B with a $20 (space) in each sequence fixed this,
       but we'll need to make the program robust against this.
 - "trek":
     - Telix did not display the top front of the ship.
     - Telix and OSTerm left some debris from the RCA explosion.
     - WinTerm did not appear to show stars at different intensities.
     - WinTerm and Telix both had the Enterprise partially re-emerge on
       the left side of the screen.  OSTerm ("autowrap off") let it "exit,
       screen right", while "autowrap on" gave behavior similar to the
       other programs.  Dunno which was intended, but I preferred the exit...
 - "xmas":
     - See notes 2 (double size) and 3 (newline) above.
     - Without "newline" mode, WinTerm was an absolute mess.
     - WinTerm's special/graphics characters were not as good as Telix's.
     - Telix mangled the jack-in-the-box.

Three "bugs" in OSTerm/68K V2.2.1's VT100 emulation were identified,
excluding the "non-supported character sets":
 - handling of sequential "ESC" characters (used in "ship" for time delays).
 - one spurious linefeed in "outer_limits" -- cause yet unknown.
 - the "debris" left in "fireworks" and "trek" also needs to be
   investigated to determine the cause (both Telix and OSTerm).

It sure would be nice to include support for the special/line drawing
character sets -- it would make these "movies" look a lot prettier.
But our preference right now is not to increase MM/1-specific
dependencies.  I am glad that the basic VT100 protocol support held
up so well under these files <whew>.

Regards... / Ken

PS - BTW, Boisy has provided me with a bunch of similar files for ANSI
graphics, too.  Uncovered some interesting things, like IBM ANSI homes
the cursor after "ESC [ 2 J", while VT102 in ANSI mode specifically
does not...

PPS - You probably are already aware:  there are some news groups
that carry these types of files:  alt.binaries.pictures.ascii and
alt.ascii-art are two I have run across.  I picked up a variation
of "xmas" on one of these last year, but haven't been back much.
Yours was a nice collection.

>>Hope this long message hasn't bored you... <g>
   Not at all.  I hadn't heard of the two Usenet groups with these
sorts of pictures.  Definitely a good place to look next time I need
this type of stuff.
   The ``trek'' problems with losing the front part of the ship
(Telix??) were probably due to a failure to properly support underlining.
As I recall, ``trek'' uses underlined spaces to draw that part.
   Generally, I've been quite disappointed at the various bugs
I've found in many commercial programs claiming VT100 emulation.
Sounds like OSTerm is now on a par with many PC and Mac commercial
programs I've seen.
   If you have a Coco around, you might try these movies against
KBCom (OS9) and V-Term (RSDOS).  These particular movies were just
part of the testing that Eddie and I did on those programs, and it's
kind of neat to see how these programs work in full.  (The
only weaknesses I know of are that KBCom doesn't support blinking;
V-Term doesn't support blinking on graphics displays and lacks
double-width/double-height/special chars on hardware screens.)
    I should also upload the ``vttest'' program I have sitting here.
It's a menu-driven program that exercises a lot of odd VT features.
    Also, feel free to ask me any questions you have.  I spent
a lot of time over the last eight years implementing and testing
several VT100 emulations (V-Term was only the beginning!).  Someone
else should benefit from those years of effort... <g>

Unfortunately, it requires another computer or a null modem cable
and two serial ports under OS9.  Basically, you just put them somewhere
where you can ``list'' them while using KBCom.  Unfortunately, Delphi
won't allow you to ``list'' a binary file, and they must be uploaded
as binary files lest they be damaged in transfer.  With a null modem
cable and two computers (or two serial ports on one OS9 system),
you can use KBCom on one machine/serial port and dump the files into
the other serial port so they come through KBCom's screen.
     I'm sorry there's not some simpler way, but there's really not.

Hmmm.... Last time I heard about that many things blowing at once,
the culprit was eventually tracked to the power supply.  A bad power
supply can TOAST your entire computer very quickly.  My parents
have also had computers toasted by lightning coming in over the
phone wires (through the modem), and through the power lines.

Heh.. ya.. just ask eddie about his MM/1... 8-) He unplugged the modem,
phone line, power on computer, power on monitor/tv.. BUT, forgot to unplug
the CABLE on the TV/monitor... zaped his MM/1 good... He finally has a
wroking system again, but it took over a year to get it repaired.

So, for thos that use a TV/monitor on their systems, keep in mind that
lightning can also com in through your cable connection...

BTW Tim... I liked the VT100 movies you uploaded... Wish I would have
saved all the ones we had at school... KBCom handles them all perfectly!

Heck, you don't even need the lightning......just the induced voltage from
a nearby strike.  The phone lines/power lines act like one big antenna.  We
had a local teenager killed when talking to his girlfriend on the phone during
a thunder storm.  No sign of arcing in the phonebooth (where he was when
making the call) or equipment damage.  Imagine what that could do to a

Of course, it should take a great deal less than 1 year to repair a system now,
as Ray Patterson has more equipment than Mark was forced to get along with,
and it is Ray's full time job.   (He has income from old contracts, and can
devote the majority of his time to the

Thanks, Paul.   Of course, it's nice to have the information Ray's come up
with, and nice to have someone working with the newest modules after a big
jump from a much older set of modules.   Ray is working out some information
regarding some possible incompatibilities between some MM/1 modules that
may be responsible for some wierd 'KWindows bugs'.   That is VERY tentative,
and Ray should be talking to several folks, gathering information and
writing some documentation for us.   He is also a great resource person,
helping me to find some more programmers, and some engineering help.

Nice goin, Greg!

Looks like you have the OS9-related Usenet groups pretty well covered.

For FTP's, I think cabrales BECAME chestnut (chestnut.cs.wisc.edu).
Another one I get into a lot is wuarchive.wustl.edu  -- lots of GNU
stuff (an lots of everything else too).

     From: JOHNREED     To: ALL

Attention PostScript/Ghostscript & TeX/LaTeX/dvips users.

I have just uploaded a few handy utilities to help manage
PostScript files.  With these utilities, you can shuffle
pages, set up for book or booklet (both sides) printing,
resize documents etc.

I found them while wandering around Internet.

Compiled on my MM/1a - should run on other OSK boxes.

(Source included - GNU/FSF-type distribution)

If you use PostScript, you gotta have these.

If you don't use PostScript, don't bother -- they are
no good for anything else -- except maybe as examples
of C programs that rewrite text files.

Look for "psutils" in a few days.

Tim, I'd like to get someone to write an article on using Ghostscript/LaTex,
etc. on an OSK machine. The stuff that comes with LaTex isn't easily
understood as written. I also need some generic postscript stuff for later.
Willing to fill in anything? Would be for "68' micros" magazine..

     Floating point data types in C
     From: MITHELEN     To: ALL

Well, just had to get message number 90000! Heh... But, on the serious side
I'm working on a program that store "double" type variables in a file
and have come accross a problem... I want the datafiles to be interchangeable
between the OS-9/6809 and the OS-9/68000 versions of the program, BUT
it apprears that they write doubles out to the file in a different format
(even though both are 8 bytes) is ther a quick/easy/clean way to store
this data, and not have to work out fancy workarounds? Any suggerations
woube be apprieciated... currently, I am writeing out a struct that
has a long, and a double as it members, with a single "write(pn,
&struct,sizeof(struct));"
and reading it in with a similar read statement..

Umm, Paul, I looked into this, think we had a discussion about this recently.
I think it would be pretty hard to get interchangeable files.  I would have
suspected that the 2 systems would write a float in the same format, and
it could be that they do.  One problem is that OS9 uses "align", where it
puts in pad bytes to get 2-byte data types to start on an even byte.  In this
case, one system trying to read a file written by the other might be starting
on the wrong byte for the read..  You might try writing a file under both
systems and checking the size.. There's a good chance they won't be the same
size.  I've given up on trying to share files.

     RE: Floating point data types in C (Re: Msg 90000)
     From: TIMKIENTZLE  To: MITHELEN

The simplest way to share files across platforms that I've found is
to use ASCII-format files.   Especially with floating point, as
machine-native floating point formats vary so incredibly between
platforms.  Just use `fprintf' instead of `write.'  Another benefit
is that it's much easier to debug your file I/O routines if you
can read the file.  Double-checking binary file formats is not
particularly easy.
   A lot of people shun this approach because they think: 1) it's
harder to read, 2) it gives bigger files.  In fact, it's no harder
to read than binary files if you use fixed-format and `scanf', and
ASCII-format files can be just as compact if you exercise a bit of
care in designing the format.  (For example, `0' takes up only
one byte in the output as ASCII, but four bytes if you write a long
value!  `Most' numbers are less than four digits long!)

I've decided to rewrite the program to used fixed point arithmatic, and save
the data as a long and a char (I onlt need two decimal point percision any
ways, ie, dollars and cents...) It's a shame that there is no standard for
storing floating point data.. but thats life (maybe there are just too
many standards for this 8-)

     Shell22a
     From: VE3DAC       To: KSCALES

It seems that this is the first, am I the only one having a problem?
I installed the SCF and made my new merged shell module and generally it
seems to work ok.  I installed it to use with my Nitro boot, and all I
get is a technicolor screen. We'll see how it goes when the 1.20 update
arrives.  But one utility  fstat  no longer seems to work on two different
systems.  All i get is a read error, on the hard disk or floppy.
  I installed the scf and shell on my Ribbs BBS  system, not Nirtro, and
ribbs won't load or run. Its ok with the new scf and my shell2.1.  Seems
to me I had another problem, but can't find that note.
   Perhaps you can pass this onto Bill, or make a suggestion?

Supercomm.
   Sorry about the formatting, I forgot to put in the CR's, do it all the

What wild card feature are you refering too?  Shell 2.2 supports all
the wild card features that 2.1 supports, just start the line with
a ":".  For example: ":del *.txt" will delete all the files in the
current directory that has ends in ".txt".

It seems that the new shell+ v2.2 has new locations for turning on/off some
of the various options. Here they are:

offset    on     off
$017d     26     20    toggles block function on/off
$04f7     26     27    toggles default wildcard on/off
$04a5     26     20    strip @ from non superuser command lines (security
toggle)


Also left out of the new shell plus was the patches to use only 1 page of ram
as the minimum data size instead of the shell+ v2.1 default of 31 pages.

l shell
c 137b  11 01
c 137f  1f 01
v


The cd/cx access mode fix and the F$Unlink subshell fix are included in v2.2a
so they don't need to be mentioned here.



I don't know if the new SCF has the following patches included:
scf.ipc or scfkd.ipc from gshell124.ar to allow the mouse button to unpause a
sreen
scfkd.wp.ipc or scfstd.wp.ipc from gshellpat.ar to fix the disappearing window
problem.
scf14.ipc from scf14.ar that allows for non sharable devices.

If someone knows, please let me know. Thanks.

see forum message #90034

To use shell wildcards when they are turned off, the first character on the
command line should be ':'.
ex.

:echo d*       {prints all files in current dir that start with d}

The : can also turn off the shell wildcards when the default wildcard option
is on. This is for commands that use town wildcards.

  From what I have been told, the first three are definded under OS9 LII,
but the fourth ($8F) is not. Can anyone shead some like on this one.

     reg.d0= path
     reg.d1= 143

 Quickly, offhand, I can't say about $8f, (you have the others, don't you?)

Is $8f something that comes from the Level 2 program you are working with, or
is this an OSK code?  Most of the codes above 128 differ between OS9 and OSK,
(in fact, some of the lower ones do, too)... However, I suspect that $8f is
something that someone came up with - probably when they wrote or patched a
driver.. Umm, look at what you are working with... it seems that William
Brady came up with one or two for his WizPro, and it seems that some others
(maybe vi?) came up with one, along with several others..

  Further investigation shows these Setsst codes are used to set various
features in the SACIA Serail Driver used under OS9 LII. Since I will be
using the OSK serial driver, these codes are no longer important.
  Thanks for the response. I had to trace the code thru many Basic09

  Hopefully very soon, I will be announcing what I am up to. Right now

Glad you found what you were looking for.. In my response, I did fail to

     Hi speed modems and RiBBS
     From: DGANTZ       To: ALL

I'm still searching for many answers.  I have a LineLink 144e fax/modem that
serves me well enough for all but one application.  That is using it with
RiBBS.  I cannot seem to get it setup right to work with RiBBS no matter
what I do.  I also could use more detailed info on hi-speed modems, protocols
(V22, V32, V42, .bis of those, MNP, etc.)

Anyway, I've tried seven ways to hanah to get this thing to work with RiBBS
including turning off all of its advanced features and setting everything
it has in common with my now defunct Avatex 2400 to the same as my Avatex
was when I had RiBBS working.

Can anyone help in anyway, shape or form?  I'm best reached through email
but I'll try to make a point of getting in here for replies too.

                         Thanx

   other things. Attendance at the conference is still real good, and
   hopefully we will say the same about the fest!
        The transcript should soon be available in the New Uploads
   database.
        Also, don't forget that next week we will have none other than
   Alan Dekok and possibly even Colin McKay and others from 'NORTHERN

     Usenet and Gopher
     From: GREGL        To: ALL

The Usenet and Gopher areas should be available as soon as DELPHI unlocks
them. The menu items are Usenet for the news groups and Internet Gopher for
the Gopher area -- note that Gopher includes search utilities (i.e., Veronica)
along with FTP sites.

I added pretty much what I though y'all might want in the Usenet area so let
me know if you want more added or think some news groups shouldn't be here.
There's about four pages of news groups, from alt.best.of.internet to the
gnu.* groups, plus the German OS-9 groups (de.comp.os.os9 and de.comp.os.os9.
sources) for those of you fluent in die blizterschniggle -- whatever that
is. :-)

The Gopher area is somewhat bare at the moment. Your favorites are at the
top followed by a Gopher menu then a link to the main Internet SIG stuff.
The Gopher menu contains a link to the Internet SIG search tools, and some
FTP sites -- mostly just the four CoCo/OS-9 sites like wuarchive.wustl.edu,
chestnut.cs.wisc.edu, lucy.ifi.unibas.ch, and musie.phlab.missouri.edu.
wuarchive and chestnut seem to work fairly well in my tests, but either
lucy or musie (I can't remember which) gave me fits trying to get in -- I
figure either it's slow or just too busy. If you continue to have problems,
let me -- I'll keep an eye on it in the next day or so as well.

Above all, let me know of any changes you want to see, additional sites,
stuff that might make it easier, etc. For example, you think it might be a
good idea to add the GNU archive sites along with perhaps ftp.dec.com -- the
mother of archive sites? :-)

     Dynacalc on a VT100
     From: MROWEN01     To: ALL

HELP ME!

     I'm trying to use Dynacalc from my Coco3 on a /T2 attached terminal. I
downloaded the VT100 for dynacalc file from the apps database here. There
are no instructions with it. I presume that the .trm file is to replace
the normal dynacalc.trm file. I am using a Wyse-60 setup for VT100
emulation. When I type dynacalc, it processes for a few seconds and then
simply returns the prompt. No errors, it just ends dynacalc.

     How can I get this to work. With no instructions, perhaps I'm doing
it wrong. The vt100 .trm file is the same size as the coco .trm file (12800)
If anyone else is using this or has a work-around, please let me know.

Thanks

     From: WDTV5        To: MROWEN01

Unforch, theres a totally junk message here, I clicked on the flippin .info
file instead of the text. Here is the right answer (I hope)
Mike; If I'm not mistaken, that .trm for dynacalc on /t2 assumes that it
was called from a shell started by tsmon/login. tsmon and login then assure
that your paths are correct, with /t2 becoming stdin, stdout, and stderr
because it detected your terminal attached. You wake up tsmon with a
carraige return (I think) and then tsmon determines the baud rate if its
a late version of tsmon. It then calls login, which in turn asks you for
a password entered at the terminal. It then looks up the password in the
file /dd/sys/password, and if that same password is there it starts a
shell on /t2. You then start dynacalc from the terminal. Dynacalc (if I
recall correctly, its been a day or 500 since I read this) then determines
that its running on /t2. The .trm file for /t2 should have all the control
aliases for that particular terminal preset. In the case of the VT100, its
pretty generic for most of the stuffs that dynacalc needs.

While this may not be exact, its the general sequence that takes place to
set up the paths to /t2 and get a shell running with /t2 as the 3 paths
quoted above. Once thats done, then it should be pretty straight-forward.

Read up in the os9 manual about tsmon and login to finetune this.

I hope this helps; Cheers, Gene

Thanks. I tried this, but I still just get my OS prompt back when I enter
the dynacalc command. It definitely does some processing, but nothing is
letting me know what's wrong. I tried putting the .trm file in both the
CMDS dir and the  home dir set up in the password file. Perhaps the vt100
image I downloded is flawed. I'm stumped!

use Gh(P)ostScript and haven't found mentioned in the docs anyplace are:
"PostScript Language, Tutorial and Cookbook," published by Adobe Systems

a lot more info including info about Level-2 PS.

     annoying process #
     From: TEDJAEGER    To: ALL


OS9 naivete on display! Been trying to write a bit of BASIC code to fork
a background process from within another BASIC program. Have found that
this approach works:

DIM mod1:string[10]
mod1="testproc &"
shell mod1

In this example, testproc would be packed and stored in the execution
directory. Only problem is this puts the process id (e.g., +13) assigned
to testprocs on the screen of the main program. I dont want that +13 popping
up on the screen of the main program so is there a modification, perhaps
to line #3 above using /nil, that would avoid it? Thanks

     From: TIMKIENTZLE  To: TEDJAEGER

Try this:
   mod1 = "(testproc &)>>/nil"
   shell mod1

The thing to remember is that teh ``+13'' message is printed by the
shell that puts ``testproc'' in the background.  The parentheses here
give the command ``testproc &'' to a subshell, whose stderr is
redirected to /nil.  The thing to be careful about is that this
redirection will be inherited by testproc, so you have to be
careful that testproc doesn't need stderr.  (If my guess was wrong,
and the shell uses stdout for that message, then you'll need to
make the corresponding changes.)  What I suspect most programs do
is either clear and redisplay the screen after running the test
program (equivalently on CoCo or OSK/KWindows: open an overlay and
close it immediately after, with backing save enabled), or directly
call the F$Fork call to run the background process.  The latter
path is definitely trickier, and requires knowing a few subtleties
to get it right.

     Seagate HD info
     From: TEDJAEGER    To: ALL

My friend has a Seagate 40 meg IDE HD model #st-351 A/X. He needs
to know the number of cylinders, sectors, etc to configure his
BIOS on his PC compatible. Also he needs to know how to set jumpers
so the drive will function as a slave (second drive) on his
system. Thanks for the info!

Dear Ted:
There is a rather large file here on Delphi called seagate.ar that has the
info you are looking for.  It should be in the OS9 database, I think under
general.
With all best wishes,

Holy cow...less than a week until Atlanta.  Once again I'll go see old friends
and spend money. :-)

If you haven't gone to a Fest, you really ought to if you can.  It's a lot of
fun.
