Maybe I don't get "out" enough.  However, look at this forum.  So far, we

I'm afraid that if we sit on our duffs, our descendants will have a very
poor life.  The issue is not just whether a person can carry a gun or not.
This is just one step toward a condition that looks very bleak to me.  If
you will, just look at the entire issue from an objective view.  Look at
-ALL- the developments, and especially ask yourself if you really think
the methods of attack that the government is taking will help one bit.

What difference does it make whether it is repealed or if you just can't
utilize it.  What value would the Second Amendment be if you still have
the right to own a gun but just don't happen to be allowed to own any
particular kind in existence?  Same difference.

While it is very true that no gun control law will prevent the hardened
criminal from getting guns, that is not the purpose of gun control laws.

And gun control does not take legitimate guns out of the hands of legitimate
owners. A target pistol, high quality or low quality, that weighs that
much could very well be abused. Good enough reason for me. It does not take
a huge weapon to put holes in a piece of paper.

Just because you think differently than I on the gun control issue does not
mean in any way that I think that you or anyone who agrees with you is a
wild-eyed radical lunatic.

And just because Delphi OS9 forum and contributors to your local BBS, local
or whatever, seem to agree with you means nothing as far as nationwide
public opinion is concerned. My local BBS is just like  yours, with
most contributors expressing anti-gun control sentiment. Still, it appears
to me that anti-gun control advocates are more vocal in these electronic
discussion forums.

And while I do not consider public opinion polls as the "gospel", they
have usually held true to the point in question. And they have been asking
the questions concerning gun control issues for years not, and there is
a definite trend towards more gun control.

I do not think that whether one is armed or not has anything to do with the
person's "quality of life". The proverb has NOTHING to do with gun control
but with the environment, and activities of our government, guided by
the various environmental groups HAVE made improvements. Be glad to
document some of them, if you wish.

There are those that say an AK-47 is not needed for any reason by a
private citizen, that the gun itself is too powerfull. This makes me
wonder:

A) How many 'system crackers' need to break into military computer systems
   or crash certain government computers, before the govt. decides that
   computers are to dangerous for us to have, and outlaw PC's? We would
   all say "Go after the crackers, not our computers". Does that sound
   familar?

B) People should not need a reason for having or wanted any item, if
   I want a Cray supercomputer, and have the money, should I need a
   reason for why I want it? It shouldnt matter that I could never
   use its full power, or that someone says that I dont need that much
   power.


I personally have no interest in guns myself, but those that do should
have the right to own any kind they please. Stores do instant credit
checking on our Visa's and Mastercards, they could do it on our criminal
records and such as well. The technology is available, lets use it.

As for keeping a gun out of the hands of a "well-behaved" citizen that
woke up one morning and snapped, set up a 10-20 day waiting period, or
whatever on handguns, and so-called "assault weapons". Banning guns that
can hold more than 5 rounds, and calling them assault weapons is silly
because a gun could be MADE to hold 4 rounds in the magazine, but the
magazine could be modified to hold more than that, it would probably
just "stick out of the handle" a little bit. That action of all semi-
automatic guns are basically the same in principle (I believe, someone
will have to back me up on that) the guns physical styling and looks
have no bearing on its power, but they LOOK scary, so they got banned.
I am sure there are semi-automatic hunting rifles that are more powerful
than an AK-47, but the AK has a higher capacity "clip". All one would
need to do is make or aquire a higher capacity magazine, and that rifle
would be more deadly than an AK, so the concept of assault weapons and
legitimate weapons is really a non-issue. What really needs to be
done, rather than banning the guns, is to really get the criminals, yes
the police are out-gunned and out-manned.. so, give the police more money
and more men to do their job, while it is unrealistic for a cop to walk
down the street with a large-scale semi-automatic weapon, the standard
pump-action shot gun in the police car could be replaced with a "better"
weapon.

While I agree something needs to be done about crime, getting rid of
guns isnt the ansewer. In fact, I cant really say for sure that I know the
ansewer, but for that matter.. nobody in Washington has had the right
ansewer in the last 100 years so.. why start now?

But, weight of a gun has no relation to the power of the gun... Most target
pistols use very small caliber ammo, and also, low power loads. The weight adds
stability to the gun. I've hefted 22 cal. target rifles that weighed ove
30 lbs.

The "problem" is, there is very little firearms education. Just like Drugs, or
Sex, people should receive proper education about firearms when they are
young.

I can't wait til BB guns, and dart pistols get included some day as weapons

Zack, the reason for the weight of target pistols is that the weight makes them
steadier for aiming. The size of these items and low capacity (many are single
shot, especially the larger ones) should preclude them from the law. They
aren't easily carried a
nyway!

I've followed this most of the way through, and I'm afraid that the parallel
between the computer and the AK47 just isn't valid. I'm not sure about your
system, but mine will not accept a bayonnet, or a multi-round clip, and as
far as I know, I can't plug someone 12 times before they hit the ground with

than a fishing rod, and I feel that anyone who wants to possess an assault
weapon is looking for bigger game than I've ever heard a liscense issued
for...Man.
Just the other night on a radio talk show, someone mentioned that they saw no

supposed to be used for. What a chilling thought. Those weapons are designed to
kill

One of my friends owns a high powered snipers rifle (the kind that you see
in moview, that breaks down in to a bunch of small peices, and fits in
a little case) Certainly this type of firearm has no praticle use for
the recreational user, it is the type of firearms one would use if they
were in the business of contract killing, or wanted to assinate someone.
But, infact, he does use it for recreation. He says it is idea for hunting.
Compact, light weight, easy to take care of. and very accurate. I don't
know if this type of firearm is included in the current legisation, but
it would be only a matter of time. The point is, once the government is
allowed to start restricting something, then it is just a matter of time
til it decides that it will just do 100% restriction. If the government is
really concerned about crime, then they should concentrte on better enforcement,

and stiffer penalties. Criminals will always find alternate tools to do
the crimes if the "usual" ones arn't available (which, no mater what type
of gun control is in effect, criminales will still be able to get their
tools of choice)

Paul,

I hesitate to jump in here, but...you "better enforcement and stiffer
penalties" people are just as wrongheaded as the "ban anything that might
be construed as a weapon" people.  Each of those approaches only swell
the prison populations which, because the prisons are the best training
grounds for career criminals, makes the crime problem that much more
difficult to deal with.  In addition, the spawning of ever growing police
powers and agencies means that more and more of the population becomes
dependant on the police agencies for their livelihoods and careers.
Unless the underlying social problems are dealt with, no amount of gun or
weapon control, no amount of punishing deterrence will be effective beyond
a small blip in the statistics.  I am old enough to remember the death
penalty.  It was common around the United States then.  It didn't deter
anyone who had the urge to murder, it only made enforcement harder because
then the perp had the motivation to hide the deed well or frame someone
else.

Thomas Jefferson knew why the Feds should not have the power of life and
death.  The botching of the investigation of John Kennedy's murder is all
the example anyone needs for that point to be illustrated.

Let's address why there are homeless in the streets, and why people are
so desparate as to turn to crime and why the various kinds of family
abuse causes the monster personalities.  If these things are not done,
we will all live in a police state during the 21st century guaranteed.

No, a computer wont kill a person (though my parents think I will get
electrocuted :) ) however, both the computer and the gun are tools...
banning a tool will not stop the crime be it hacking or murder from being
commited.. hackers that want classified info and get paid for it, will
buy their systems blackmarket or buy the parts to make one.. murders will
just modify their guns, use a bigger clip or whatever, to accomplish what
they already do... murder. That is of course, if they actually buy their
guns from a store.. I will bet my money that they get them from the blackmarket
not Bob's Gun Shop.... the damage that the tool has the possibilty of doing
does not warrant it being banned.. computers should be banned because of
hackers.. and guns shouldnt be banned because of killers....we have no
reason to fear the tools.. just the people behind them. We dont mind
the police and military having assault weapons, they are the "good" guys.
Well guess what, anyone that doesnt run into a McDonalds and shoot people
is a good guy, and they should be allowed to have the gun they want.

 Reckon that depends on what you define as an assault weapon.  Used to mean
 weapons that would actually be used in a military operation.  Now it means
 any weapon that _looks_ like one that would be used in a military oper-

 You better believe it.  The purpose of every gun control law since 1963 has
 been to make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to obtain firearms.

 The Ruger Mark II target pistol weighs 44 ozs empty.  Add some better sights
 and a weight or muzzle brake to control rise and it could easily top that 50
 oz mark.  Of course being a .22 LR caliber it's probably used in drivebys
 and holdups all the time.

 The purpose of the Bill of Rights is to keep all those well meaning
 majorities from stomping all over the right of minorities.

 Remember Brown vs. Board of Education?  For years, democratically elected
 legislatures had mandated "separate but equal" schools.  That didn't make it
 right.  Public opinion polls in 1942 supported the incarceration of American
 citizen whose only "crime" was having Japanese ancestors.  That sure as hell

Of course your friends break-down rifle has legitimate sporting reasons! It
would DEFINATELY be easy t ocarry on a long trip, especially if the trip
was conducted through the air (easy in the baggage department). However, since
I'm in the military and know how to handle an M-16, I can agree with you that
assault rifles ARE designed to kill people and are generally of little use
to a hunter. They are to short and don't have the stopping power required
for big game at reasonable ranges, especially the newer small caliber
weapons. The hunting rifles I have are much better for long range. If I
intended to murder someone (for the sake of argument), I wouldn't use an
assault type weapon. I'd most likely use a .22LR rifle at 50 yards or so.
It is effective (well, 2-3 rounds anyway), and nearly untraceable. There are
more .22s in this country than any other caliber. Pick up a cheap one at
a pawn shop in some remote area, preferably anopther state, wait at least a
month,
then shoot the fellow and ditch the rifle. No assault weapon involved. Most
people who buy assault weapons do so for collector purposes or simply "show-off"

purposes. Very few people buy a weapon of any type with the intent to go out
and shoot someone. And most of those are law enforcement people or criminals.
I don't disagree with making a firearm not so easy to get (not necessarily
difficult though) so that people who are unstable or have criminal records, and
juveniles, can easily get them.
 One can now legally own a true machine gun with a class V dealer license, and
they must register the weapon with local law enforcement personel. Licensing
assault weapons would be more effective than banning altogether. The ban will
leave those who really want them most (criminal types) with having them.
For personal defense, I might add, an assault weapon does make some sense.
They are designed to be manuevered in close quarters. And six shots may not be
enough. We are taught to "double tap" (two shots) anyone we shoot. That means
three people if all shots hit.. something not likely in a panic situation.
Education is the real answer. You need to have at least a basic course in gun
safety, even if lecture only, before being allowed to purchase a gun. In
some states, such a course is necessary before a hunting license is issued.
It would be a simple matter to require a hunting license before gun ownership
is allowed. The "hunters safety course" only has to be taken once and a card is
issued. Simply show it at the counter before purchase...

Actually if the users are only accessing the DB for reads then no special
work is needed, since the OS takes care of those things.  The problem
arises when you have multiple people wanting to write to the DB.  There
are several ways to deal with this, the easiest of which is to only allow
one person to open the file for read/write at a time.  This can also be
mostly handled by the OS (if I remember right) with only a little additional
programming.

 You can lock out a section of a file with the SS_Lock SetStat or the
 _ss_lock() function in C if your working in OSK.  This will lock out the
 section of a file from the current file pointer up to the number of bytes
 requested.  You can't use buffered calls for this but setting up your own
 buffering isn't that hard and is usually faster than the buffered C calls
 anyway.

 Be careful as two users trying to access the same record can create a
 deadlock.

:) That is a good one. If you are serious about buying an OS-9 computer..
a CoCo 3 with a hard drive makes a nice little system.. for a more modern
faster computer a Delmar System 5, KIX/30 (by FHL), or an MM/1 (now sold
by BlackHawk) are all good choices, I myself lean toward the Delmar..
because it uses a PC-style bus and the cards for it are pretty cheap..
Although, from what I have seen, more graphical-based PD apps exist
for the MM/1 than the others..

 This ain't the gun control forum!  Just happens that most OS9er's believe in
 the idea of individual rights.  Add such anti social notions to the kind of
 intelligence they have already demonstrated (by choosing OS9 :-) and you
 have a bunch of politically incorrect "anarchists" who just don't take too

well, I suppose its like this.. a CoCo, out of the box will only be
able to play little game cartridges.. you buy a CoCo, play a few games
when ya get the money, you can buy disk drives.. get some more spending
money, by an RGB monitor.. then maybe a multipak..after a slow, but
steady climb, you will have a "full computer".. and now that you have
the hardware.. maybe you will buy OS-9, or maybe get 512k first..its all
a personal decision.. the same thing goes with the Delmar..

only thing is, rather than get just the motherboard at first and playing
games, you get the motherboard, floppies, and (i believe 4) serial
ports... for $1000.. then when you get some extra money you buy a
monitor, VGA card, and keyboard.. there, now you have graphics.. oh
and you can throw a mouse on too.. down the line a little ways you
complete the software buy getting Gwindows.. there ya go.. there is the
basic hardware stuff down.. now, maybe add a few extras.. more memory
maybe an ALT-86 board (to run DOS apps) ....ect.. buying a delmar
(or KIX/30) is similar to buying a coco, in that it too allows you to
slowly upgrade.... I myself dont have a delmar.. but when (if) I get
an OSk machine, I know it will be a delmar.. right now, I dont need OSk
I have level 2 on the CoCo, and 2 different flavors of UNIX on my
PC's ....I actually might skip OSk and go right to OS-9000.. but that
depends on how the OS-9000 scene looks when I have the money..

The monitor and card for a Delmar system would add $300-$500, depending on the
quality of the monitor. A card is under $100, 640x480 VGA monitors can
be found for around $200, higher resolution would cost more.

 I gues my point is: when I buy a computer these days, I expect to start
 with: The main computer & keyboard  (I don't know what I'd do with one
 that didn't have theh key baord with??) with at l4east one 3 & 1/2" drive,,

 two types), a beginning memory of a meg or better, and a system DOS,,
 8be it (MSDOS/ Workbencjh/ or OS) plus a basic to fit the machine.

  that is theh starting point of nay computer I've heard of.  Except FHL,,
 who sells the pieces.  But until these are together,, a comparible computer
 to me it ain't.
  Hard dirves,, extra mem, monitors,, like printers,, are parriffials to
the discression of the user.

Mark,
  First off, grab COCOOS9.BAS from the OS9 General area. This is a DECB program
that will make a disk readable (only) by OS9. Then, download the SuperCom
version 2.2 binary, only the binary. Save SuperComm to a DECB disk as binary
data (like a picture file), and use the COCOOS9.BAS to make the disk readable.
Then boot os9, copy SuperComm onto your normal disk, set the attr, and run.

  SuperComm is intuitive enough that you don't need the docs to do basic stuff.
Run it with the command "supercomm [#xxK] <>>>/w&". "F1" or Alt-? will get you
a list of commands. Now you should be able to get online with OS9, and download
archivers, doc files, and, if you insist, KBCom. :>

  BTW, I uploaded the Supercomm binary seperate and unarchived just for
situations like this. Yell back if you need more detailed info on how to do
all this.

I see Zack got you an answer, though I have a minor correction. The magic
size is n*8K - 512  (not 1024). Do keep N to a minimum, though. when Os9
sets up the map for a program to run, it maps in eveything that was merged
with it. If you run N up, this will eat into the data space you'll have
available.
  For instance, SC is currently around 18K. Due to the 8K granularity, you
can run it with up to 40K of data. If you merge things in, and stay under
23.5K, you can still use 40K of data. But if you go over 23.5K, even though
SC itself is still 18K, you'll only be able to get 32K of data, 'cause
everything you merged in also gets put into SC's map.
