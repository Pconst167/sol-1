That's ok, Terry.  So long as you don't leave 4 times the typos, we'll

     RE: Shell+ 2.2a bug (Re: Msg 90418)
     From: MMCCLELLAND  To: 01GEN40 (NR)

   My version of Shellplus 2.2a doesn't leave a '.' anywhere when using <ESC>.
Rather, it gives 'ERROR #246'es repeatedly. The only way to break is with a
<CTRL> <ESC> and then a <SHIFT> <ESC> following it. This causes an EOF. Are
you using the SCF that came with Shell+? This seems to be what is causing the
problem in my machine, but using the old SCF is even worse. The new SCF doesn't
let one click the mouse button to unpause text output to a window either, and
the new Shell+ doesn't support logging functions. Someone should inform the
author of these problems.

You can still get the front-loader and then get the optional FMV cartridge;
I don't know of a front-loader with FMV built in yet...though the GoldStar
player, from what I've read in the magazines, is supposed to have FMV built
in.  (Now, do I remember whether it's front or top loading?  No, I don't.)

     From: MREGC        To: ALL

    If any MM/1 owners, and particularly programmers, haven't downloaded Boisy
Pitre's program LinkUp yet, please do so immediately. This is *exactly* how
MM/1 programs should have been looking over the last 4 years!

    This program has been released as freeware, and yet it puts most other MM/1
programs, including most commercial releases (and, I'm ashamed to admit, the
utilities I've written), to shame.

    This program has set a new standard. Can we match it?

    EXCELLENT work Boisy!

     Help with 1.2MB 5.25"
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

Hi all,

I just purchased a TEAC FD-55GFR 1.2MB 5.25" floppy drive for my
MM/1.  I cannot seem to read CoCo OS-9 formatted disks with the
following dmode parameters:

name=c1
 drv=1 stp=3 typ=$24 dns=$01 cyl=40 sid=2 vfy=1 (off) sct=18 t0s=18
 sas=8 ilv=3 tfm=0 toffs=0 soffs=1 ssize=256 cntl=$0000 trys=0 lun=0
 wpc=0 rwr=0 park=0 lsnoffs=0 totcyls=80 ctrlrid=0 rates=$10
 scsiopt=$0000 maxcount=65535

When I attempt to read, I get an error #247.  The light comes on and
the drive is apparently trying to read the disk.

I recall hearing discussion that some 5.25" drives use a different
spin rate to read hi-density while others use a different data rate.
While I'm not trying to read a hi-density disk in this case, I wonder
if this drive will work as a 1.2 meg floppy?

Does anyone have any experience with this drive on the MM/1?  I would
appreciate any answers.  If I can't use the drive, I'm taking it back.

  Try playing with the `dns' bits above.. like dns=$02 or 3 and
see if that works.  I don't have a 5.25 on the MM/1, just use
the 3.5 to read my old coco 3.5 inch disk...  Hope that helps.

I can't speak specifically to any OS9 aspects of the 1.2M
5-1/4" drives but I can report that they are nothing but
trouble in MS-DOS systems.  They work fine for reading and
writing in the high density mode (360 RPM, 500 kHz data).
Nothing but trouble, though when trying to be compatable with
the 40 track, 360k disks.  If you can get your hands on a copy of
"Upgrading and Repairing PC's", take a look at chapter 8, where
the author devotes about three pages to explaining the problems.
I don't know what additional problems you may encounter dur
opps - due- to the pecularities of OS9.  I use a 3.5" hd on my
Kix\30 and can transfer easily, in 720k mode, between the Kix
and the CoCo and from the CoCo to MS-Dos using "PCdos".  I
believe the 3.5" is the way to go!

 Boisy,

 Hi density 5 1/4" drives run at 360 RPM.  To read CoCo disks (or universal
 format disks), you need to change the drive speed to 300 RPM.  So far as
 I know, the only way of doing this is to find the jumpers on the drive and
 strap them - not all drives have jumpers.  The other alternative is to
 find a 360K (or 720k) drive.

 Hi density 3 1/2" drives look for the second hold in the disk to determine
 and set the speed.  Therefore, much easier to write a descriptor for them.

Litil Divil is kinda a dungeon gam. You are a runt Devil called "Mutt" sent
on a mission to retrieve lost souls from the abyss... There are 6 levels
to work up through, each getting harder as you progress. On each level, you
will find pizza, which is used a curency at the shop on each level to buy
necessary items to complete your quest. There are several doorways on each
level, that require you to complete some task (combat, figure out a puzzle
or a skill type thing) after you "solve" the room, the corridor will open
to another part of the level...

The graphics are of course great, and it has a lot of subtle humor in it. It
is pretty difficult to get killed, but some of the doorways are really
a challange to get past...

In *Litil Divil*, you play a demon who's in search of the Mystic Pizza of
Plenty.  (*CDi* says that there's a sequel in the works, in which he's made

 I believe that announcement may be somewhat incomplete and misleading.

 Bill Wittman has committed to Kreider to sell his boards.  We (Delmar)
 have also been talking to Kreider re his board but are waiting to receive
 the first board for evaluation.  We will be offering it if -

    1) it works properly.
    2) we think there is a market for it.

 > You can then add a graphics card in one of the PC slots to run an

 Maybe.  It will depend on the gfx card.  Kreider intends to have MGR
 ported to it.  MGR will be the public domain, unsupported version.
 Bringing MGR into the personal market place will simply add another windowing
 system.  What software, etc. will be written and made available for it?

 According to the last conversation I had with him, they hadn't made a
 final selection of the gfx card.  I will probably do a port of G-WINDOWS for
 it regardless of whether I sell the machine or not.  But, it will be
 only for cards using the TSENG LABS ET-4000(xx) chip set.  Also, I don't
 know whether he will write a driver for a video card to permit it to
 run in the native mode (without a windowing package).  I understand a
 port of K-Windows is also planned but this will be a major effort.  I
 suspect availability will fall into the same category as the ports of
 K-Windows for the SYSTEMs IV & V.
