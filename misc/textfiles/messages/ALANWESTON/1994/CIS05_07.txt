Kevin,

I would like to give more details but I don't know what OS/9 is....my company
manages the internal computer system so this is beyond our scope. I do know
that it is an intense amount of work on a new project.

If someone can give me a brief profile, I will put them in contact with the
appropiate people.

Thanxs,

Phil

Sb: #pipes vs. signals
Fm: Lou Tiberia 70431,3410
To: ALL

I'm using OS-9 on a 68000 CPU board in an embedded VME system. I need to send
information from an interrupt service routine to a process. Is it OK and/or
good practice to write into a named pipe from an interrupt service routine ? Is
using signals a better way ? lmt.

Lou,

Most of my experience with interrupt service routines is with 6809 OS9, but I
would think the same rules apply: limit any system calls within any interrupt
service routine, particularly those that involve other device drivers, even if
it is just a memory device like pipes. I would go with the signals. Maybe
someone else with more OSK experience will also answer.

Doing I/O in an interrupt routine is _not_ recommended. However, I've done a
couple of games using this and haven't had them crash (yet). But signals are a
much better way to go than named pipes. Don't forget another method--shared
data modules.

Greetings to everyone

We have been attempting to install a user trap for catching ex. zero division
etc. inside
a trap handler, containing our own libraries. The result is that we can't
really catch
anything, and for example 102 is shown in procs listing as 166 (bull ??). In an
OS9 task
the same handler works perfectly ok. What's the big difference, or are we
really getting
some stack problems as 166 suggests ???

Thanks in advance

Hannu
