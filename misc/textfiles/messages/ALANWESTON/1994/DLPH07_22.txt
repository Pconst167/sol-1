Well, my friend, if you are interested in some exotic home brewed hardware,
you are in the right place ;) Check the forum here and the Coco SIG. Take a
look at the Hardware Dat at the coco sig and the Gen and OSK Dat's here. It'll
give you a lot of insight. Many folks here have hardware and info available...
I'm sure that they will drop you a line...

Ken,

 You,ve found the right Sig. Lots of Motorola spoken here. The majority of
the machines used/talked about in this sig are:

  Tandy Color Computer 3  (coco) with a 6809 or Hitachi 6309
  MM1  (68070 and 68340)  contact NIMITZ
  PT68/Delmar (680x0)  contact EDELMAR
  FHL/Hazelwood  (680x0)  contact FHOGG

 The first machine is no longer made, but plentiful used. The last three are
all in production (last two having multiple models), and come in "kit" form.
ere, kit form means you get the populated boards and maybe a case/keyboard;
much like piecing together a PClone. If by kit you mean a few boards and
a baggie full of chips... well, I think those days are pretty much gone.
Maybe someone like GMX still has such to offer. But it's doubtful.

 All of the machines run a version of OS-9, obviously. The PT machines (maybe
FHL as well) do have alternate operating systems. If you have questions on
the specifics of the machines, send email to the vendor reps I listed.

Dennis,

Fred Brown (Peripheral Techonology & Computer Design) designed the
PT68K-2 that was described in the articles that Peter Stark wrote for
Radio Electronics in 1987/88.  PT also manufactured peripheral boards
for the SwTPC system (6800 and 6809) and single board 6809 and 68008
systems.  It was Peter's idea to put XT-compatible I/O slots on the
PT68K-2.  Peter supplied the HUMBUG ROM monitor and the SK*DOS operating
system.  PT later supplied Dan Farnsworth's MONK ROM monitor and REX
operating system (not as nice as HUMBUG & SK*DOS, in my opinion).  Fred
and Peter later had a parting of the ways.

Joel, I found that the following:

     l68 sysgo.r -l=/dd/lib/sys.l -o=sysgo

works to compile sysgo.a fine. Linking both usr.l and sys.l also works
and produces an identical sysgo.r. However,

     l68 sysgo.r -l=/dd/lib/usr.l -o=sysgo

leaves an unresolved error (TotRAM I think it was.)

BUT, there are some mysteries re the sysgo.a file! Notice that on the first
page of the source there is an OptTime label at the beginning of a line
that supposedly gives the user an option to have or not have the time
displayed in the startup message. That option is not set in the source
but I got the time displayed anyway. Didnt want it because it wraps
around to the next line on my startup screen, looking kinda ugly! Anyway,
I started looking through the source and there are no lines like:

     ifne   OptTime
     ...
     ...
     endc

that would seem to allow for conditional assembly of the display time
option.

Another oddity I noticed was that after installing sysgo version 9
my system tried to boot entirely from floppy. I had been using version
5 of sysgo and with it the os9boot was read from floppy but .login and
startup from HD. My init had /d0 set so I dont know how it managed to
go to HD but it did. Anyway, I changed /d0 to /dd in init and then
the new sysgo booted as did version 5 but still with the time displayed.

Could you pass along what modifications to make to  sysgo.a to get
the conditional assembly of the time display?

Yep.. you seem to be right... the conditionals for OptTime
seem to have been left out.... You can "fix" you code by putting in
a:
 ifne OptTime

before the block of code that has the comment "Print time of boot..."
and an:
 endc

Sorry about leaving off the OptTime conditionals.  Paul has exactly
the right points for putting those in.

This sysgo is different from the sysgo distributed with OS9/68k.  As
you can tell from the comments, it's had a number of different folks
beating on it, and I pretty thoroughly rearranged a lot of stuff.
If you dump the old sysgo, you'll notice it has a reference to /DD
hardwired into it (look near the very end), which the version I
uploaded here lacks.  (On the rationale that it should follow Init.)

And may I say, you did an excellent job in cleaning up the source and
arranging its storage in a logical order.  That helped a lot when I
decided to modify the code.

That's where I think I've always kept my .login and startup file(s).  It
boots faster if it can get those off the HD.

  I heartily agree! I was so impressed with the auto-ex that I wrote a sound
file player for G-Windows and a file recognizer. G-Windows automatically
shows my custom icon for the sound files and plays them with just a double-
click! I recently had an inquiry from a fellow that wrote a driver for the
System 5's DAC regarding the MM/1 system calls, so he could make his calls
compatible with our existing programs. That would make porting our sound
programs to you a snap!!

That's just what I would love to see.  I think that if we can get it so
you can write an advanced windowing program that will work for all 3 systems,
then that would give more incentive to write.  When/if your sound player
gets available for the Sys 5, I, for one will be interested.

Yes, I am harboring hopes that G-Windows might be the tie that binds.

I would love to see K-Windows available for us, too, but I fear that
this may not be.

  I'm afraid that G-W would be too expensive to include as part of the
MM/1 hardware (or Kix or SysIV/V).

   Well, IF you're a programmer and very ambitious <g> contact David
Graham. I know that the source for windio is NOT available to the public,
but, the MM/1 port of G-Windows (as I undestand) was done by an MM/1 owner
without the source. After all the hardware is supposed to be similar.

Yes, I can read and write to CoCo formatted floppies *as long as they were
formatted on a real CoCo*. I can read and write to floppies I format on
the MM/1a, but I can't read them on a CoCo. Here is a dmode of my /c1 device

RE: your comment on support for PC's

I own three PC's and have built several systems for others.  Your comment on
support was about as off base as most comments I see when people in this SIG
start a discussion on PC's.  I've never had anything but good support from
the PC vendors I use.  I've heard horror stories about some OS-K machine
vendors (I will NOT list vendor names in an open forum).  I have been involved
in making OSK machines work for some time now and also use PC's on a regular
basis.  Support is directly related to the vendor that you buy from.  If you
buy a PC clone from Wal-Mart you can expect support that is lousy.  If you
buy the same type of computer from a PC marketter (a person that makes his
living from building and selling systems) you will get better support.  If
you buy a computer from COMP USA (a store that sells only computers, software
and related hardware) you will get excellent support.  Where does the Rat
Shack fall into the equation?  Somewhere in between Wal-Mart and COMP USA.
Why?  Because they sell more than just computer related products.  With such
a wide assortment of products the personal can not be trained to be computer
specialists.  It isn't cost effective.  Of course you can always luck out and
find a Radio Shack that has knowledgeable people but it usually isn't due to
training that they received from Radio Shack (ex-computer center or outlet
employees are the exceptions to this rule as are some managers).  So.....
If you want good support look for it before you buy.  Buy wisely.

Terry,
     You've made many comments here in this thread that I need to comment on.
First, attendance at the CoCoFest was actually a little higher than last year
for show attendees.  We had three fewer vendors (actually only one fewer if
you discount the one time attendance of M'Ware and the International OS-9
User Groups.  All in all it was an excellent turn out.  So good that we have
already reserved the Holiday Inn for next year.  We need to work on the
seminars (plans are already being discussed) and we want to try to lower the
prices again (we are looking at that area as well).  It would be nice if we
could do it all for free but reality strikes again.
     As far as OSK programs, etc.
     OSK has much more available than OS-9/6809 does.  The programs that are
available are better in most cases and thus cost more.  Because OSK is has
fewer memory limitations due to inherently more powerful processors it is
much easier to port utilities from the UNIX world over to the OSK machines as
well.  ELM is an excellent example.  You complain about the acronyms being
cryptic...well, so is homepac.  Why do I need a program to help me pack up
my home?  A lot of the utilities mentioned are well known in the UNIX area
under the names mentioned.  DYNACALC...A calculator program?
There can only be so many descriptive names.  Feel free to name any program
something else when you use it or do what I do, write a startup script and
name that something you like.  I will also comment generally about the
number of new programs available for the CoCo as opposed to OSK machines at
the show.  I'd say it was closer to 50/50.  Northern Xposure had a  lot of
new 68(3)09 stuff and I saw other new stuff for the CoCo.  Unfortunately a
few of the older CoCo vendors didn't have anything new for the CoCo but
have turned their creative talents to OSK pretty much exclusively.  I can
only remember two items that were new for RS-DOS.  That is a shame but to
be expected.  The same goes for OS-9 6809, it will continue to lose the
programmers as they look for more power to write bigger and better programs.
If you were in the PC area you'd realize that this is exactly what is happennin
there as well.  You almost have to have a '386 with VGA to run any new
applications.  Games aren't even being written without sound-blaster support
and VGA is a must as is extended/expanded memory.  So much for the old
original IBM PC users.  The same thing has happened to the original MAC
users, AMIGA users, etc.  This is called progress.  While we can lament the
loss of our excellent programmers we must be realistic about it as well.
This trend will continue.  It isn't only about money either.  Money is
frequently used as an excuse because it is something that everybody can
understand.  After talking with quite a few programmers that have moved
away from the CoCo I find that while they say that they moved away because
the market is dying when questioned in greater detail they actually moved
on because the CoCo doesn't allow them the freedom to build the large
programs that intrigue them.  These are creative people and they feel that
their creativity is stifled by the CoCo/OS-9 6809 and the limitations of
the 6809(6309).  I can't blame them.  It is also their choice.  All in all
they are still willing to help others that haven't moved on by answerring
questions and providing examples on how to work around the limitations
that the 6809 imposes...they just don't want to do it themselves any more.

I was only addressing the fact that so many people think that if you don't
own a PC, you don't have a computer.  To begin with, I wouldn't even consider
recommending an OS9 machine to a computer illiterate person.  However, this
same person, however, is bound to have difficulty with any computer he/she
buys.  In my case, I spent a very, very great deal of time trying to decide
on whether to go to an OSK system, get a PC, or a Mac.  In the end, I went
with OSK, fully realizing I can't go into Wal-Mart and see rows of software
for my system.

One thing that did influence me was what I referred to in msg 88202.  On the
BBS's these guys often had to go in and juggle their interrupts around and
whatever to install an internal modem.  What I was referring to was the
fact that you can't plop even a PC down and expect it to do it all itself.

RE: support, in an earlier message, I referred to a friend's experience
with customer support.  This is only one case, but a true case, nonetheless.
I recently read an article in a PC magazine, or maybe Computer Shopper,
regarding customer support.  According to him, the Gateway forum in CIS
was filled with complaints in this regard.  What I was referring to in
my latest msg was the fact that should I have a problem, I did have a
few questions, or if a customer of Dave Graham or Frank Hogg has a
problem, you will be able to get in touch with one of them personally,
not a sales rep, and while they might not be on top of this particular
problem, I expect that they will be knowledgeable enough to find an
answer.

No, the PC is a good computer, and probably the best choice for the
true _user_.  But I think my OS is every bit the equal, to say the least.

        >>To begin with, I wouldn't even consider recommending an OS9
   machine to a computer illiterate person.<<

        I have a little different of a view on that. I don't think OS-9
   is any harder on the computer illiterate person than Dos, and as a
   matter of fact would recommend it over Dos. It is much more simplistic
   to operate. I admit OS-9 is not yet for most people but I think it's
   good for many more than some of us think. OS-9 as a system is MUCH
   easier to operate than Dos, judging from what users have told me<I'm
   talking OSK here obviously>, and I think I have enough knowledge of
   OSK and Dos to draw a decent conclusion.
        The big difference between the two is the often talked about
   software availability. Dos won't give up this advantage anytime soon,
   but I think the OSK software has improved enough to give it a decent
   software base. If someone says "I need Wordperfect" or Dbase or any
   other specific piece of Dos/windows software, than obviously I have to
   recommend a PC, as I did recently for the rest of my family when they
   were looking for a computer to buy my father<which everyone else in
   the house uses>. I was thinking of recommending an MM/1 but then my
   sister and others came along saying "Well I wanna run Microsoft
   Word..." among other things, which we obviously don't have under OSk.
   Now if they had simply said "Well, I want to do some Word Processing
   and some Database Developement..." that would be a different story. We
   have that stuff and we basically have enough software to meet almost
   all your basic computer app needs. It sure needs some work, but we are
   in decent enough standing to promote OS-9 machines to those who have
   GENERAL software needs. I think now's probably as good a time as any
   to get these machines to some of the larger Computer shows going on
   around the country. The San Diego Users Group had the right idea.

        This was a bit long winded, but I just wanted to post it as a
   response to some of the recent postings regarding OS-9's supposed lack
   of user friendliness. If you<not you specifically David>, are
   referring to the COCO, yes it is lacking obviously, but that is to be
   expected considering Tandy left it up to us users to hack and patch it
   up in a million different versions. There's not much we can do about
   that, nor should we worry about it at this point. Professional OS-9 on
   the other hand is obviously still supported and is therefore much
   easier develope for with end users in mind. From what most PRO OS-9
   users tell me, installing programs is just as easy as it is with Dos.
   This just goes to show that when referring the user friendliness
   situation, you need to make it clear which version of OS-9 you are
   talking about.

        Again, this message isn't really directly aimed at you David, I
   just thought your post was a good opportunity to get my post out.

Well worded, Chris.

I would like to address the issue of OS-9 (and I mean OSK) not suitable
as a personal operating system:

I am a firm believer that OS-9 is not only well suited, but optimal as
a personal computer operating system.  When people think of OSK, they
generaly think of xmode, grep, etc...  Can you imagine a new computer
user trying to use xmode when he/she doesn't have a clue as to the
difference between path descriptor and device descriptor?

The "key" is to write software that is easy to use, intuitive and
spiffy.  Mike Haaland's GPORT utility (that comes with DeskTop for
the MM/1) allows the user to set baud rate, parity, stop bits, etc.
at the click of a mouse button.  No typing nasty xmode commands, just
point and click.  And the interface is very neat...  In fact, I've used
GPORT as the auxiliary program to interface with a K-Windows terminal
program I'm writing.

I know I'm picking on xmode here, but there are other computer
functions that can be done with class in OS-9.  Looking back,
Tandy had the right idea with Multi-Vue, though it was way under
powered.

THe main challenge is to sell people on _WHY_ an OS-9 system would
make a good personal computer.  THe bottom line for most folks is
software.  I agree with Chris -- if people want general computing
software such as word processing and spreadsheet, then the MM/1 or
other OSK systems can fill the need.

I really think you are right.  There's nothing that hard about OSK,
and I hope for the day that maybe we'll see OSK provided as a users
system.

The biggest problem at this time is for the user to know where and how
to obtain their software.  RE: Coco.  Yes, that was one problem I was
beginning to run into - all the hacks and stuff, and it was getting
to where you just could not get enough memory to do what you really
wanted to do.  I still haven't gotten all my stuff for my OSK system,
but a lot of what I've seen has impressed me very much.

Really, what you said about people wanting a specific app is the main
thing that would make me hesitate in recommending to someone.  Really
more in that I would be a little reluctant in taking the responsibility
of making the recommendation.  I think a lot of people would not
be satisfied with software availability right now, even though we can
do just about anything any other system can do, and what we can't is
just due to the fact that it has never been implemented yet.  I'm
referring to such things as widespread CD-Rom availability, and the
like.

Again, I heartily agree.  The system itself is ideal.  Your statements
are extremely well on the mark.  You hit on the biggest thing right now,
and I feel that this is changing, and the key is to get more of "us" in
to get a beginning user base so that we can get all the user-friendly
stuff going.

I think the best thing that could happen to us is to get a common base
by which we can easily write software, based on the user interface, that
will be universal across all platforms.

The real advantage that MSDOS has over OSK for the "average"
user is one that has been pointed out over and over again.
Most MSDOS users never use MSDOS - they have an interface
that hides it completely.  Just watch your favorite average
messydoser when confronted with the dreaded "C>" prompt.  He
has a look on his face like he is holding a dead rat by the
tail.  He is every bit as confused as he would be if he had
just booted up OS-9.

So how do we get these neat interfaces?  That is the
problem, where do we find a programmer with the skill and
the time to write the monster for our little bitty market?

What we need is for a relatively large company to assign a
programmer or three to come up with a great "user friendly"
interface for OS-9, bite the bullet, sell it for peanuts,
then sell the development stuff for peanuts too.  Maybe that
would get enough "slick" programs on the market so we could
actually recommend an OSK system to someone who just wants a
computer to do a job, not program it as a hobby.

The new machines are wonderful.  It was a tough choice for me when I
decided I needed a new machine to replace my CoCo -- should I go with a
PC or stay with OS-9.  I toiled over that for many months, as it's so
much money.  I finally decided on an OSK machine (the MM/1), and I love
it and will never regret making that choice.  If you truly love OS-9, an
OS-9/68000 based system is truly, in my opinion, the way to go.

        It is already. Heck you have one of them you lucky Devil ;-)

        Unfortunately that has been the biggest problem haunting us level
   II users for years. Technically, even if we don't get MW source, we
   can still use all the hacks and patches to our advantage by coming up
   with what we as a community feel would be the ideal 'standard' Coco
   using all the patches and stuff that we have at our disposal. This is
   an old idea that can still work if a great majority of Coco users can
   cast their votes and decide. This type of project is well suited for
   the UG, assuming they don't have a million other projects tieing them
   up right now<which could be the case given all the work that needs to
   be done to get the OSK work started>. Any member could carry such a
   project if he/she is willing to see it through I suppose. I tried it
   once, and just couldn't get it done for a few reasons.
        Achieving such a goal would help bring back the usability of the
   Coco for those who use them and program them. As it is now, almost

        I agree, that is the hardest thing. You have a LOT of SOMEONE
   ELSES money that may technically be in YOUR hands, so it is a good
   deal of responsibility that you have. I still feel OSK is a great
   choice for many people, but I must admit it is hard to be unbiased
   when you are a hardcore OS-9er. I am always asking myself, "Maybe I'm
   looking at his/her situation the wrong way. What if OSK isn't
   right...." .
        Hopefully in time we will get some better CD-Rom materials as
   well as the other goodies the other systems have as bragging points,
   but we do have a fairly decent foundation that still needs some work.
   The best thing to do right now, imo, is to keep supporting the current
   base of OSK users by not only writing some good utilities and apps,
   but also getting some more programming Languages and Tools out there.
   I know Professional OS9 comes with C which is a good deal, and 2 out
   of the 3 personal machines come with Basic but after that it seems
   that programming support is a little less than spectacular.
        For instance, a good Pascal and/or Basic compilor would be nice
   for those who don't know C<the only language that get's the good
   support for obvious reasons>. I know C is probably the best way to go,
   but it shouldn't be the only way. FHL had the right idea when they
   mentioned their Basix for Gwindows in a posting a good while back<year
   or so?>. Only problem is, I haven't heard anything 'bout it since :-(
   . Hopefully it's still in the works. Also, it would be nice if BGFX or
   some future equivelent were released with Kwindows instead of sold
   seperately. I imagine there's a good loss in there starting out, but
   if it helps promote more programming from the communities Basic
   programmers, it may be worth the gamble for a long term gain. It is a
   setback I think for Basic programmers who have to require that users
   buy a graphics subroutine program in order to run graphic based
   programs. I think the more languages supported, the better we'll do
   application wise, and I think those should be emphasised much more
   than Apps at this point since the majority of OSK users are
   programmers who would love to write those apps, if only they have good
   tools.

        So to make a long story short...<Big Grin>, I agree :-)

How many of you would be willing to pay $35 to 50 extra to get them??   There

Yes, we *DO* have it as a user system, but I meant as something for the
*GENERAL* user.  As I said later, I just couldn't take the responsibility
of having a practically computer illiterate person invest in the system.

I have two cocos, and set one up for my brother.  No HD, but 1 360K and
1 720K 3.5.  To be honest, about the only thing he knows about computers
is the word "RAM" <G>.

I have attempted to set him up with some stuff, all he needs, if he
needs anything at all.  But he can't or won't get in there and dig for the
info.  He is a "user" in the strictest sense.  All he can talk about is
being able to get a PC - something "you can get software for".  Now fact is,
when/if he gets one, he will have no more power in what he does than now,
and he'll probably be in the same boat as he's in now, but at least I won't
be setting him up with something "that you can't use".

I think this would happen in most cases.  As I mentioned before, most people
think the only computer there is is a PC.  If you get someone to get an
OS9/OSK machine, when they go to encountering problems, and they will
regardless of what system they get, then you've given them a bum steer.
If these same people have a problem with OSK, then you've messed them up,
and in their mind, wouldn't have this problem with a PC, whereas if this
same problem should occur with a PC, then it's just something that happens.

My point exactly.  Maybe I'm just chicken, but in most cases, you get
lots less flak if you let them make their own "mistakes".

I don't know just how such packaging really should be handled, but I think
what is needed is some sort of standardization.  I'm not all that familiar
with BGFX, think it's the equivalent of GFX2 on the CoCo?

Anyway, it does add a little complication if a programmer wants to include
routines for a run-time module, but must contend with the fact that there
may be users who do not have this module.  I can see where a potential
customer for software might be hesistant if he is faced with the necessity
of having to purchase an additional program to run it.

As for Desktop, you may already be doing this, but it seems that it should at
least be offered as an option installed at time of purchase.

David,
     I agree with most of what you wrote except the part about having to to
juggle interrupts, etc.  The CoCo and the MM1 approach this from a different
aspect because of the hardware they use.  PC builders and "accessory"
manufacturers could  have avoided the "interrupt" problem by building the
internal modems with a set interrupt but that woul require them to build several

different modems.  This is due to the way the CPU works and is not determined
by the OS.  It is strictly a hardware requirement.  It is much better the way
that they are set up now.    Actually there are OSK systems that require the
setting of interrupts for the COMM ports.  Again this is a hardware
requirement.

I have never actually dealt with a PC personally, so only have what I've
heard and seen to go on.

The point I was really trying to make is that so many people seem to think
that OS9 is so user-unfriendly whereas PC's are almost automatic.  In
actuality, the biggest problem for us is 1) most of us have to order our
systems and many have to be set up yourself, and 2) Automatic "install"
programs are a little hard to do, since there are so many variables in
system setup, and OS9 is by nature, a terminal-oriented environment.

I don't think anyone is trying to bash either system.  I think everyone
has put forth some pretty valid points.  I have gone on to OSK, but
am still using my CoCo and still respect it, and to be honest, there are
a few sections where the OSK systems have not yet caught up with the CoCo
in software development.

I do suspect that I will continue to gravitate toward OSK, but the CoCo
will always be near and dear to me.

I think what they are trying to express is that there are some limitations in
the way OS-9 is implimented on the CoCo which is not present in the OSK
machines.  System RAM can get filled faster, there is a 64K boundary problem
that has "overcome" in only a few software packages, speed on the CoCo is
lower......that sort of thing.  Yes, you can do more fster on an OSK machine,
but I don't thing you should throw your CoCo under a steamroller just yet
(big grin).  BTW, I have an old QT (Helix UniQuad) on the desk here and the
CoCo seems a little bit easier to use than that....even my hard drive is
faster on the CoCo (grin).  I say, IF it works......use it!

     Cryptic?
     From: MRUPGRADE    To: CBJ

  You covered a wide area.  And I'd liek to re-comment (if that's
a word) on what I mean by cryptic code.  i.e. cryptic code =
understood, only by those within an insider framework.  Or not
intelligable to the public.
  May we step back a bit, and remember in the beginning most all
software was written in a manner so that: you had to be somewhat
computer fluent, or being a programmer helped in understanding how
to use it.  Unknowingly programmers were writting programs using
terms that only that only programmers could understand.
   This is fine for hackers.  But does not add up to
user-friendlyness.  And yes, I've seen this trend for needing to
know DOS and computer language functions, as part of getting a
program up and running.
  As example: I bought MV Canvas.  But not knowing OS-9 I could
not get it up and running on my computer.  A learned friend in OS,
had to make several tries.   Further there author said he could
not gice a step by step proceedure to do so?  Due to possible
differences in systems.  When I didn't buy the upgrade, whose loss
was that?
  PROGRAMMERS HEAR THIS: If your software is easier to understand
and use more people will buy it!
  My complaint is; and I believe it a valid one; TOO MUCH OS
SOFTWARE is written in this manner.  And more importantly IT IS
NOT NECCESSARY.
  On the plus side (5 years back) I had Van der Poels OS-mailer.
And was amazed that I could simply follow a half page of
instructions of what to type,, and WALLA!  His mailer was up and
running in OS-9, "without a need for me to be a hacker".
  More recently I've been impressed with Chris Dekker's OS-9
software.  With a few lines of which disk to insert, followed by
"an INSTALL program", that does the (hacker) work for you.  Yet
all the modules, and subdirectories, etc. are there for you folks
that like to tinker.

  You mentioned Home-Pac, from the beginning there was a special
effort to replace computer terms with common english language.
Where it's very easy for many of us to say: Input Data, it's
understandable to more, to say: Add new checks.  Etc.  Why must
you have Home-Pac?  You don't!   Many; perhaps most; "home
computer users", could easily grow old and quite happily in the
process, while never having a computer in the house.  But, many of
us enjoy the learning (yes, and tinkering) with them so we have a
computer. And if you have one,, it may as well be "useful as
well".  Many (grin) CoCo users overlook that point.  Keeping your
check balance?  Most of us can do that.  But finding the check
that Bill Co. said they didn't get,,, last month?  Last year?
When did you buy that car battery, that just went dead?  It's lot
faster then sorting though a book or so of hen scratches.  And tax
time... need I say more?   I'll cut the <g> ad short here.  But
you get the point.
  Back to the original point,,, I am asking programmers to be less
cryptic, with their computer terms in software.   Make them easy
to install; without OS knowledge.  And there will be more people
like myself, that will start using (and buying) OS-9.
   Or is that wrong?
       for what it's worth,,, Terry Simons

if you want to use a second coco as a terminal, you need a serial port
on the main coco (like a deluxe rs232 pak, or like me a COMM-4) and then
on the second coco run a terminal program (like ultimaterm or supercomm)
to access the main coco. I do this alot since i have two coco's both have
hard disks, but the second one is connected to my main one VIA /T5 and that
second coco has 2 rs232 paks (in case i hook a modem to it)

to physically share the hard disks, there is only one option. buy KEN-TON's
SCSI adaptors (2 of them) one will be modified (i think) then you need to
hook the hard disks to SCSI if there not already. then both coco's can
physically share the hard disks. I was planning to do this (it would cost
about $90 for me) but i just saw it as impractical since I don't need to
access the main hard disks much from the second coco

Hi Robert,

MIKE_GUZZI missed mentioning 1 very important point when it comes to
using 2 rs232 paks at the same time.  That point is that all the paks
are addressed the same so you will have to re-address one pakfor this
to work.  I think I still have a text file that explains, in good detail,
how to do this modification.  This modification also requires that
the descriptor you use must have the new address in it as well.

I had my CoCos set up so that I could go online here on Delphi and down-
load a huge file and still be able to do other things as well on the
CoCo used as aterminal.

I also did not use TSMON or LOGIN to use my terminal.  All I did was
to start a new SHELL and redirect it to the /T discriptor for my
modified rs232 pak.  I think that the text file I mentioned earlier
might be here on Delphi, I am not sure.  I did this about 2 years ago
and do not remember where I found the file.  If it is not here, and if
I do still have it, I can E-Mail it to you if you so request.

Ya.. come to think about it, doesn't that rsdos to os9 transfer/converter
program have problems if the file is over a certain size... I know ther was
a patch to make it handle larger files, but I don't know if it removed the
size limit entirely...

     DCHECK
     From: MROWEN01     To: ALL


     I have just spend about four days trying to reconstruct my hard disk. I
don't know if I just had corrupt files or what. I restored from backups made
with stream. The system would flake out once in awhile and I would get 244
and 245 errors. When I try to use dcheck on /h0 it reports some files and then
stops with an error 211. Is dcheck reliable? I ran scand to check the disk and
it was OK. This is after running format, B&B ccheck, and zapping a few entries
in the directory. I can run dcheck multiple times and it will report different
files each time. Is there a utility out there that can sanity check my file
system better than dcheck? All low level utils say the physical disk is good,
but I still run into an occasional 245 when restoring with stream. Thanks!

first run dcheck with using another device for its temp files such as /r0
the command like goes like this

 dcheck -w=/r0 /h0

 that will help, the #245 is a write error, you might have some flakey sectors
on the hard disk, B&B utility CCHECK will remove these after formatting (but
can be used while files occupy the disk) These utilities are with the
file system repack package ( a must have!) once ccheck identifies the bad
areas you can tell ccehck to list the files occuping the bad areas, zap them
off and then restore them from backup. that should prevent barfing from
dcheck and furthur damage.

BTW: CCheck and most of his utils are useless if you clustered your hard disk!

the same drive (although, it looks a little different) It is a single

David,

  The machine that I would want (I do have a specific app in mind; one that
I'm currently using a ms-dos laptop for and hating it) would not be cheap.
And  realize that the market would be fairly small, so there would be no
volume to amortize development costs. So... $2500 for my machine, yes.
$2500 for a machine with lots of glitz and no FPU, no.

  To answer your next question....

  Strong CPU with a FPU
  768x480 mono
  small (by todays standards) hard drive, say 120 meg.
  Three serial (at least one capable of 57600)
  One parallel
  Expensive color LCD's not needed or wanted
  Built in pointer devices not needed (besides, I've yet to find one that
    is usable left handed)

   Stick with Computer Shopper and Ham 'fests/Flea Markets. Mac stuff is
always over priced (the same stuff, no less). As a wise man once said:
"Macs are for people with more money than brains."

   So long as the drive is SCSI it should work.

  I won't go into the details here but, FROM Delphi, send it like this:

    IN%"@pucc.princeton.edu:listserv@pucc.bitnet"

  Type it just the way it is here.  Delphi in NOT on bitnet, but the

Seems like I saw a post that you had the directory entry solved, but
maybe you're still having problems?  If so, here's a sample of code
that should work, typing off the top of my head here, but...

  (* you might want the directory entry to a var, call it dn
  DIM dn:string[31]
  DIM ch:BYTE
  DIM pt:INTEGER

  pt = ADDR(dn)
  WHILE (LAND(PEEK(pt),$80) = 0 ) DO
    pt=pt+1
  ENDWHILE
  POKE pt, LAND(PEEK(pt),$7f)
  POKE pt+1,$FF

This should get the directory entry into basic format.

You may have had the problem already solved, but this might give you
an alternative method.

     RE: Latest in Basic problems (Re: Msg 88583)
     From: WDTV5        To: CPERRAULT

One other reply in this thread triggered another gotcha possibility on
getting the directory entry into memory. That is (& we already covered it
earlier I think) that each directory entry is 32 bytes long. Because of
this I always define 2 vars and read them both in the loop so that the
reads are in fact in step with this 32 byte size. The name is of course
the first 29 or less bytes with the remainder being whatever was there
before *unless* you make a habit of running my gsort on the directory
quite often. Gsort cleans up the garbage between the end of the name and
the last 3 bytes of that 32 byte assignment for each slot. Thats incidental
though. What counts is the reading from the disk the full 32 bytes for
each slot of the directory file. And of course I always do a seek #path,64
just to skip the first two entries which are the infamous . and .. entries.
There have been a multitude of answers to this problem presented and at
least 4 or 5 of them will work. If its not working yet, let us see the
code you are using, that "paragraph" so to speak, along with the
declarations of the vars used.  Its not that heavy duty a problem, really!
The gotcha I was refering to was one fellows defined string of 31 bytes.
Thats one byte short, thereby getting you out of time/step for reading
the NEXT entry. I define mine as string(32) and byte(3). Not that
exact syntax of course, but the mail I sent should have shown the exact
syntax. That code works and has for several years now.
Cheers from WV, Gene

That example was just a quickie thing I wrote off the top of my head.  You
might have to embellish on it a little to do what you want it to do.  Someone
pointed out that my example was dim'd wrong.  It was not for disk read, and
actually, I had forgotten, was thinking that the filename size was 30 bytes
instead of 29.  This example was for an alternate variable space, and I would
add an extra byte for the terminator, in this case.  If I remember correctly,
Basic allows you to store up to the string size, that is, if you dim
xx:string[29] then you can have a string of 29 bytes, and don't use the $FF
terminator.  To add an extra byte takes up more space, but you don't have
to worry about this case when parsing the filename.

Of course as he pointed out, my example would not work for a directory read.

Marty-

   Thanks for the info! I'll try some of your suggestions when I open my CoCo
up to install the 6309.

   A few days ago, I tried to install a Teac 3.5 inch, 1.44 Meg floppy that
had been accidentally connected to 12 volts. When I tried to read a disk, I
got both read and write errors. I proceeded to dismantle the drive, and
noticed a burnt IC (a Teac(?) 3479). It appears to be a stepper motor
controller. During a format, I noticed that the heads stepped erratically, as
if the motor was receiving pulses that were too short or out of order.
The rest of the drive appears to function properly. Any suggestions on how it
might be repaired? Is it worth the effort?
Thanks again for all of the help!

I know of no source for the chips in question.   Anyway, I don't
consider floppy drives to be WORTH repairing.  One pickes up used
3.5 in drives at flea markets for $5 to $20 each in my area, and
a replacement chip could take hours to locate, and cost $5 or more.
Just not worth the trouble.    Anyway, if the thing was given
improper voltages, it's probably damaged in ways other than
that one chip, and is not worth repairing on those grounds.

Ok.. look in the System Modules database for SAcia, and Clock Edition #9,
they replace the standard ACIAPAK, and clock modules, and _should_ solve
your lockup problem... Also, make sure you don't set your comm program faster
than 9600 baud, the stock coco (and even performanced modified ones) can really
handle faster then that (without more advanced RS-232 interfaces)

Not with your current RS-232 pack (and, unfortanately, the RS-232 packs that
will let you handle higher speeds, arn't on the market yet) Under DECB, the
coco only has to worry about one thing, and can grab the data from the RS-232

You need to keep an emergency floppy boot disk  handy for cases like this.

make up a floppy with your necessary drivers, etc and have CMDS and grfdrv
& shell on it. A trick Disto uses is to have your /h0 on this disk named
something else (they use /hf).  Since it can't find /h0, it defaults to
reattr your shell or whatever else you need to do.

The real "fix" is topatch your init module to look for /dd as the boot

your floppy drive, and you can then leave the hard drive as /h0

The standard software that controls the floppy drive (it is a module called
CC3Disk) is written to enable slot 4 as the active MultiPak slot for
addressing the floppy, and to enable slot 1 as the source for interrupts
which are used by the RS232 pak.

The reason behind this is due to limitations in the design of the MultiPak.
It wasn't designed to handle the more advanced requirements of OS-9.
(Hardly any DECB programs are sophisticated enough in their use of the
external hardware to require using interrupts -- Ultimaterm may be an
exception that does this as an option, I believe.)  As a result,
Radio Shack established a standard configuration for the
hardware to make it easier for non-techies to set up the system.  Of
course, the more demanding OS-9 users established ways to enable other
configurations.  As you test out the OS-9 waters, you may encounter
several situations like this, and should be able to get quick answers
here on how to deal with them.

For this particular configuration restriction, you may only need a one-byte
patch to the CC3Disk module to allow your reconfiguration.  (I've been
away from Level 2 for too long, and my memory is getting fuzzy -- I may
have forgotten some details.)  A more preferable approach would be to
go directly to the root cause, and make a minor hardware mod to the
MultiPak (strap all pin-8s together -- possibly skipping one slot if you
need to retain the ability to use autostart RomPak games.)  We can give
you more details if you need them.

That's not a property of OSTERM, but rather of the device drivers.
As long as the system calls work as advertised, OSTERM doesn't care.

    You can change the slot assignments in the MPI if you know where the
slot select code is in cc3disk driver by simply changing that value to the
desired values. Only thing is, where is the slot select code of cc3disk?
    Some authors of os9 drivers are sympathetic to the coco-os9 user and
provide you the slot select addresses that their programs use and some even
give you a modpatch script to change them.
    Examples of such software pachages are: SACIA, Matt Thompsons SCSI 1.0
system. and I also think SCSI 4.7. Being I have a Burke and Burke system.
Chris Burke also allows you to change your slot selection while you are
creating your HD device descriptors.

        What is happening is, I will hit the online command, or the

   string to the modem<or some string, as I see the SD and TR lights

I don't think this would affect the dialing, but do you have modem set to
send a CD at all times  (Hayes=at &c0)?  I _think_ ix looks at the returned
strings for autodial response.  Seems I tried it once, believe it _did_
dial but would not go through logon process.  Do you get anything back
on the screen?  My ix shows the ATZ, etc, that it sends.

Have you reviewed your config.ini file to be sure it is initializing
correctly?  One other idea, are you setting your baud?  Kinda obvious,
but it's something _I_ might do <G>.

 I doubt it's IX causing your problems, but more a setting with the modem. If
it's truely Hayse compliant, then you should have no difficultiy making
it work properly.

BTW, the atx commands having nothing to do with the verbose mode of the modem,
does it? Shouldn't you be looking at the ATV parameter as well as the ATE.

 > Yes, it operates fine in every way when I use Supercomm or any

So ... if you're using another terminal program, what's reported when you issue
a ATZ command? How about when you make a successful connection to another
system?

 > I know it is the fault of IX, it is just finding WHERE in IX that

IX has 3 variables in the OSK version that deals with the modem ...ModemInit,
ModemReset, ModemHangup. I've been using the default values that came with IX
and haven't had any difficulties.

I don't know of any, compatibility problems.  Here's my xmode of /t2,
maybe you might duplicate some of the stuff.  One thing you might be
sure of is the "par".  I found that with some Clock modules, if xoff is
sent to the modem in cmd mode, and the modem will return the xoff, then
you are in a locked-up condition. You're shut out of the modem by the
received xoff and cannot send an xon to  turn it back on.  Another wild
stab, but possibly.  This happens in supercomm it you open a capture
file then close it while in command mode.  Not all Clocks will do this.

Can't remember the "par" setting but you need to have "xmit xoff" I think

 > I'm gonna bet there is something either buggy with the IX I have,
 > or maybe my descriptor isn't agreeing with it?

I don't think that "IX" is at fault per se.

One other thing, possibly.  You have a ModemReset option, if reset is
"ATZ", ix will do that for you.  It could be that if you had the reset
string in the ModemInit position, ix might not be delaying here long

Chris,


Just tried my own suggestion about putting modem reset code in for ModemInit.
(see previous msg)

What I saw was first the default ATZ
I then saw my "atz", monemtary pause then "atz" again, on the same line,
pause, then "Modem Error".

I think what may be happening is that while the modem is resetting, ix has
begun to send the dial code.

(Note that I'm not the one having trouble, at least on this <G> .)

To review, as an experiment in trying to help someone (CPERRAULT?) I
am in my editor now and can't check for sure who- find out why he couldn't
get his modem to dial, I tried putting modem reset string (ATZ) in the
ModemInit string.  When attempting to go online, I would get this display

 ATZ      <= from default init (ix)
 OK       <= from proper "ATZ"
 atzatz   <= from ModemInit string.

You would get the first atz, a pause, then a retry, pause then "Modem error"

As I said I suspect the atz was issued followed immediately by the dial
string, and this was before the modem got reset so missed part of the dial
string.

No, there was no OK after the "artificial" atz's, suggesting maybe my theory
is correct.

They are indead seperate things... The question as to which one is better,
depends on how you look at it. They both try to accomplish the sam end goal
(make the CoCo faster by running in 6309 native mode), but take very differant
approaches... PowerBooster is very easy to install, and doesn't have problems
patching already patched systems... Nitro gives better speed improvements,
but the patches all need to be done to stock modules, and it tends to be much
more dificult to get to install smoothly. (I have a friend that has been working

for over a month trying to get a working Nitro boot, with no luck)

     RE: PowerBoost/Nitro (Re: Msg 88569)
     From: WDTV5        To: MMCCLELLAND

Well, first off, PB uses a routine thats in series with any interrupt,
hardware or software, to reset the stack image presented to the rest of the
system *back* to normal even tho the 6309 is actually running in the native
mode. In this manner, no re-write of any module is required to make it run
in the native mode environment. B&B's PB therefore can run all the original
software written for the 6809.
Nitros9 on the other hand, does not reset the stack image, therefore
requireing often major re-writes of the system and other IRQ driven software
before it will again run on the native mode 6309 systems.
So the are advantages both ways. PB makes use of some of the native mode
characeristics to get an approx %20 speedup with no other mods. One must
also take into consideration the amount of time it takes to service an
interrupt, such as the next incoming character from the modem. Since PB
takes some of that time to reset the stack image, the IRQ "latency" must
be a longer value or time than a system wherein the native mode stack image
is written or re-written into the software/opsys. There are other tradeoffs
I expect, but the loss of a character if the modem is spitting them out at
9600+ would happen a lot quicker with PB than with Nitros9. While I don't
have any figures I can quote for direct comparison between PB and Nitros9,
I can state that the IRQ latency as measured here on my Nitros9 system
has been reduced by around 50% by the combination of the system re-write
for the native mode operations as compared to a stock 6809/os9 level 2
machine. That translates into the limited ability to actually multitask
with another program while captureing from this forum non-stop. Or to
drive my printer on another job, its on a parallel port and doesn't
requuire those timing loops the seriel port does.
So you take your pick. I'm Nitros9 here, and its taken quite a while to
get the rest of the programs modified to where they will run on this
machine now. But I think I'm also faster.  Apples/Oranges maybe, but
thats how it seems to me.

I had powerboost and switched to nitros. yes its more of a pain for nitors
to install, but the speed difference is considerble. I could not get
reliable 9600 baud with powerboost but i couldn't get it to enable native mode
due to the patches for ribbs to allow non-os9 filenames. nitros is suited for
this and the speedup is overall. i have no problems running programs with
nitros.

Maybe I don't understand the question.  Check what SCF device drivers
come with it, or better still, look for a device descriptor module named
"p".  If there is one, then things should work just like they do under
OS-9, i.e.

   list woof.txt >/p

ought to do just what you expect.

 The same command structure exists for OS-9000 as for OS-9 (well, mostly).
 You can use 'list <file name> >/p', 'pr <options> <file name> >/p' , etc.
 Make sure the driver for 'p' is loaded.  I have the following line in

 Well, it is a little convoluted to find what port to use.  The manual doesn't
 cover this except they do list pcpll as the parallel printer driver -
 see page B-6 in the section entitled 'PC/OS-9000 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS'.
 Also, if you do a dump of one of the three descriptors, you'll see pcpll
 listed - looks like ....'scf.pcpll'.. .

 Finding out which descriptor to use can be a little more complicated.  If
 you know which ltp(n) you're using, you may be OK.  If you're not, you have
 several methods at you're disposal to find out.  The first is the table
 displayed (AMIBIOS System Configuration) when you boot the system.  Mine
 shows the parallel port at '378'.

 The second is to use debug under MSDOS.  At the debug prompt '-' enter
 the following - 'd 40:0 f'.  This will give you the addresses of the
 serial and parallel ports in use.  The first 8 byte entries are the
 serial ports and the last 8 are for the parallel ports; LPT1, LPT2, LPT3 and
 LPT4 respectively.  The entries work in pairs.  On my machine, entries 8 and
 9 are '78' and '03' respectively.  There are no other entries after this.
 (Remember, byte ordering for Intel chips is backwards.)  So my parallel (LPT)
 port is '378' and since it is the first entry, MS-DOS calls it LPT1.

 Alternatively, I believe Norton's utilites (and some of the others) will
 show the proper address(s).

 OK, now we know the address of the port.  We don't care what MS-DOS calls
 it.

 Go to OS-9000.  Change directories to 'ports/pcat' and list the 'systype.h'
 file.  Go down a couple of screens and you'll find some '#ifdef's for LPT1,
 LPT2 and LPT3.  These show the addresses for the respective ports - they're
 called 'PBASE'.  Select the LPT(n) that corresponds with the address you
 found above.  BTW, according to the books I have on MSDOS, MW's addresses
 and port designations are correct - not sure about some of the MS-DOS
 hardware suppliers, though.

Do you have the latest version ?  Version 4?  Earlier versions *DID* have
this problem.  I think most of them just quietly quit, though, I think.

Don't know if there is a limit for version 4, but this was one of the

     mm/1 screen
     From: LARRYOLSON   To: ALL


   Could someone tell me how to get the pixel data from an MM/1 kwindow
screen ?
   The C routine that I have been trying, is either wrong or I'm not up
on how the data is stored in memory.
   For the test, I open a type 3 320x208 256 color window. Then using SetDPtr
I set the pointer location to 4,0 then I draw a line from there too 4,15.
   Now what throws me is, that this type window should use 8 bits per pixel,
which means that if I get the screen start address using _gs_scinfo, and print
out the first dozen or so bytes, all the bytes should be the same(screen is
cleared), except the 5th byte, but when the test is run, it is the 3rd byte
that is changed.
   Trying different locations:
        screen x location       byte changed
               5                    3rd
               6                    4th
               7                    4th
               8                    5th

   This appears to me to be 4 bits per pixel, where are the other 4 bits ?
  I am opening a window as a type 3, with the following:

       Wpath2 = open("/w",3);
       DWSet(Wpath2, 3, 0, 0, 40, 26, 255, 1, 1);

      and getting the screen info with:

       _gs_scinfo(Wpath2, &sc);

   This has me stumped

  Zack,

    Yes, there is, _gs_palette will return palette register values, and no
  doubt I will be using _gs_palette to get the rgb color values, as I'm
  attempting to write some kind of screen print program that I can use with
  this hp550c printer.
    At this point I'm not bothering with the color values, I'm just trying
  to print out the pixel values, and with a 256 color screen, each pixel
  would need 8 bits, but for some reason the pixels appear to be using only
  4 bits.

Usually, you use color=_gs_point(path,x,y);

Everything looks good, and the type 3 screen does in fact use a full
byte for each pixel.  I would bet that graphics scaling is what's
confusing your test results.  Try turning off graphics scaling using

One more problem for you infoxpress users. Is it possible to access
other forums here. I don't have a problem with SIG forums. But I have
tried to get into some custom forums and the program hangs up at the
propmt for the forum menu. It requires a carriage return (I guess) to
get to the menu. I did try but all that happen was when I got to the
return for custom forum menu (say 1) the computer locked up.

I had the same problems accessing the custum forums.  To access
the custume forums use the following line in the delphi.ini file:

GoWord = gro cus 17

substitute the 17 with the number of the custum forum that you
want to access.

If you are looking for just a VT-100 simulator that runs on a CoCo3 under OS-9
there is an excelent one in the database.  It is a short simple program and I
no problem downloading it.  Included is a script file for setting up a screen
and calling the program and three pages of documentation that are almost un-
necessary.  This is just a terminal simulator.  You even have to escape to a
shell to download.  The name of the program I think is appropriately "VT-100"

Keyboard problems can be caused by a bad PIA chip, or by bad contacts on
the ribbon cable, or by a damaged ribbon cable, or by bad
key switches in the keyboard.

  MOST of the time when a SINGLE key fails, it's the fault
of a bad key switch.   Your tale of the switch getting better
when someone pushes it repeatedly is also consistent with
a failing key switch that gets a bit better, perhaps only
temporarilly, with exercise.

  A broken or intermittent trace on the ribbon cable
or contact, or a blown single pin line on the PIA, would
cause an entire ROW or COLUMN of keys (in the electrical matrix)
to go dead, not a single key.

Yes, except, DD.SPT is a two byte value.

DD.DSK = Disk ID
DD.FMT = Disk format

David,

Thanks for the pointer:
DD.FMT is defined on page 5-16 of the Tech ref and it says (roughly):

Bit0 = Number of sides  0=ss    1=ds
Bit1 = Density          0=sd    1=dd
Bit2 = Track Density    0=48tpi 1=96tpi

I still don't know the difference between DD.TKS and DD.SPT other than the
fact that DD.TKS is a single byte and DD.SPT is a word. Why two different
places for the same value? I am _assuming_ that the only value I will see on
a stock CoCo is 18 for both. Is this a safe assumption ?

I also don't know what legal values are for DD.DSK. The only reference in
the tech ref that I found is on page 5-2 and it says (roughly):

DD.DSK ( Disk identification) is two bytes and is for internal use.

If I change that value, will OS-9 choke? What is the valid range of values ?
Is it used as a serial number, filled with random data, or based on date and
time the disk was created?

DD.OPT : The manual is fairly mute: It starts at offest $3f, but no length
or size information is in the table on page 5-2. Is DD.OPT related to PD.OPT
which is described on page 5-7?

I realize these are a lot of questions, and that they are are mostly academic
since the OS normally handles access to these values, but I am trying to do
file access using strictly RAW access to the floppy, including (but not
limited to) <g> filling in these values from scratch.

Thanks, I appreciate the help. Keep it coming!

Thanks to everyone in advance for any further comments, amplifications.

Not sure about it.  Didn't ever get into this very deeply, so can't say.

The purpose of this is to detect disk changes.  When the disk is formatted,
the system generates a pseudo-random # for this value.  Think it takes the
date-time and juggles it around.  Saw it somewhere, can't remember where.
Not sure if OS9 Lvl 2 supports it or not, but it can check this ID # and
get a pretty safe "guess" whether the disk has been changed or not.

  David;

  I can't resist making a comment regarding the "50" varieties of COCO-OS9
  L2 right now. While there may be a valid argument that each of us has
  "customized" the system such that it now does "what we want it to do", I
  would also argue that the "customizations" were brought about in nearly
  every case because we wanted it to do something that the MicroWare's
  original vision discounted as "not important enough to waste a variable
  on".  And please Boisy, don't take offense as much of this thinking
  probably pre-dates your involvement.

  I refer you to such things as the hard-coding of many things that we had
  to dig into and find later (or sooner in many cases) because they really
  were important enough to "waste a variable" on.  The original release
  cc3disk comes to mind for starters.  All the (relatively simple) patches
  required to make the C compiler actually run were another. Same comment
  applies to the Pascal too.

  Then comes Multiview, DeskMate I & II, DynaCalc, Profile.  All of these,
  WITHOUT EXCEPTION needed massageing in one form or another.  I won't
  belabor the point on DM I or II, nor send it flowers in memory of its early
  demise.  Multiview of course has had its main module "gshell" redone
  several times along with grfdrv.  DynaCalc yet needs some way to really
  control how it treats the printer instead of all these patches to get rid
  of the spurious form feed.  It really wasn't spurious if the last job left
  it sitting in mid page, but *nobody* thought of that. The real cure was to
  have the printer ignore the darn thing IF it was allready sitting at
  pagetop.  Not many printers are that smart tho. A one byte var could have
  taken care of that in DCalc.

  Profile as I recall needed something done too, but I don't at the moment
  recall what it was, I did it so many years back. And yes, I still use it
  on a semi-stock L2 system at the station.

  The C & Pascal compilers, DynaCalc and Profile were all originally L1 and
  they required patches NOT to make them run on level 2, but to make them run
  on the average system which didn't quite match the bare minimum system
  used as a hardware model. Hard-codeing things like the devicename was/is
  pretty inexcusable. I hear somebody saying "but we didn't have /dd then",
  which is pure hog-wash! The idea was just as valid on a level one system.
  WE just hadn't thought of it YET.

  (Pulling out soapbox)
  The last point I'd like to make refers to the other comments in this
  thread regarding gfx drivers..  If the machine can support the graphics
  that apparently the MM/1 can, then the graphics drivers ARE PART AND
  PARCEL of the op-sys AS SHIPPED! The fact that you would have to raise the
  price of the package by some nominal sum (I saw $50 mentioned) has
  absolutely nothing to do with it in terms of "a marketing decision"
  because *then* you are shipping a system capable of running the application
  regardless of what that application might be.  The application will then
  be written to "your" standard.  And thats worth far more in the long run
  than any $50 you might "save" in the short term.  Later "for fee" upgrades
  then will build on that standard as they will be forced to remain
  "compatible" unless the distribution version is so buggy it really does
  need thrown out . . .  Nobody enjoys re-inventing the wheel unless the
  first model was square or ?

  It also has the effect of setting a short-term "standard" way of doing
  things thereby enhancing right up front, the "compatiblility" issue we now
  have in the L2 arena because so many of us have gone on to the Hitachi CPU
  in the native mode.  The PB folks have the ability to "run what they
  brung" while the slightly faster Nitros9 group had to wait for a patched
  "Home Publisher".  Not many of us chewed any fingernails waiting for it
  but now we have it again. (And its *still* painfully slow)

  The point is that if we would have had a Multiview that actually worked
  shipped WITH the OS-9 distribution, I think the playing field between us
  and the Intel crowd would have been much closer to level. The folks in
  Westchester might have turned up the heat a bit faster too. (Commie
  Amiga's) We've also wasted entirely too much time on the BLOB. This has to
  be a hardware thing, probably in the GIME.  That it should never have seen
  light outside outside the back door of 1 Tandy Center is a given! I have
  personally written letters to the people whom I thought could answer
  questions like "How much for another run of 5000" and "are the databases
  to define it available so the bugs can be fixed?".  Nobody took the time
  or the postage to reply. Had my letters been answered, you can bet yours
  that I would have been on here asking for donations to help offset the
  "OTE" costs involved. Obviously I haven't.

  So I wasted a page on your printer. But thats how it seems to me.

  Cheers - Gene

I think each and every patch was an improvement.  However, I think the
point is that it has introduced an element of compatibility.  None are
that big, as soon as you recognize them.  The most notable thing has bee
the thing with shell+ allocating a minimum of 8K data storage.  A few
programs - ix, the new ar using 13-bit compression, UMuse(I think), barf
on this.  Again, it's not a big problem, as long as you recognize it.
I still wouldn't go back to a stock system for love or money.

I agree here, at least almost totally.  This seems logical, as I said in
a previous post.  Of course the marketing decision is up to the mfgrs., but
I do think this would be the way to go.

Gee, I'd like just once to have something happen here that would confirm
all this stuff I hear about shell+ needing a min of 8k. The patches to
fix that were avaiable, almost the next day! I did 'em once and promptly
forgot about it and have never had any problems with it.  There are/were
a couple of progs that I edited the size request in, like asm, mine has
been asking for 16k since '86 or so. Other than a couple of items like
that, its a non-problem. The point is that the fix is available, and as
far as I know, right here in the databse.

The marketing methods used are usually designed to maximize profits, never
miind that it might work a hell of a lot better our way. And, I contend,
would be more profitable in the long view by a factor of at least 2!
But bean counters don't really want to recognize that there are various
quality's of beans avaviable(available) and unless the populace is starving,
will always pay 5% more for a better quality bean.

Oh, well. . . Cheers - Gene

I have the patch, just figured there was a need for 8k.  Seems I saw
something to the effect that if the data is not large enough, it will barf
or crash on wildcarding sometimes.  The progs that barf with shell+, I
have renamed the stock shell "ohell" and call the progs from it.  Might
go ahead and patch shell+.

Yeah, I went ahead and edited *my* asm, too.  I bumped it up to 20k.

However, I still feel that we have gotten a little divergence with the
CoCo - especially with the advent of the 6309.  Personally I would love
to have *EVERYTHING* set up for the 6309.  That's system and run-time progs
both.  I think a whole bunch of features could have been implemented.
The C compiler could be completely redesigned.  The latest version of the
C compiler ( never released to us ) passed the first variable to the
called function in the D register.  With the 6309, 2 could be passed (W),
or a long or float could be passed without stacking.  There are lots of ways
to fix things up, but this would require almost everyone making a standard
switch, and it would be just too much to ask.

I'm afraid I have to agree regarding the inability to do a "standard"
switch.  We as a group have prooved (sp) one thing if nothing else, and
thats that we are individuals as a group, much more so than the pc'rers
IMHO. They tend to be bound to the limitations as if a workround was
against some moral law or something. We don't seem to work that way!
When we see a problem or something on some other machine that would be
nice to have, it seems that availability of the "oterh guys", darn "other"
source doesn't seem to stop us. If its worth doing, we just go do it!
At least thats been my approach on more than one occassion. And yes, I'll
have to plead guilty to useing some of us as unwitting alpha testers, not
because I intended it to be that way, but because I'm no more infallible
than anybody else who isn't doing this for a living. On balance, I'd
like to think I've contributed a positive effect, but thats pure ego
too. Like you, I'd like to see one cpu again so that we could have a
bit more compatibility, and just because I'm a 6309'er, I'd like to
see that as the standard. But then we still have 2 competing, non-
compatible 6309 conversions on the opsys. Unforch, neither of the
folks who brought it to life have stuck around to put the "spit and polish"
on it, at least not visible here on what I think is the best coco/os9
gathering place ever. I understand that there is a release of Nitros9
to 1.20 coming up. Now what we need to do is see if we can come up with
some benchmarks that are real to us, not something borrowed from the
pc'ers and which doesn'T really have much to do with us. Once a real
suite of tests and the results are known, then just maybe, we might
all migrate to the same opsys again. Hopefull said, but not going to
hold any breathing up till it happens.

Paul, please do such a hack to rz.... it would solve alot of

think I'm crazy when I say that Delphi doesn't support crash
recovery since their zmodems allow them to recover with no problems.
Can you post a message to the Internet forum and the to Future

 You set up the stack image differently:

  TYPE reg=d0,d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6,d7,a0,a1,a2,a3,a4:INTEGER
  DIM  r1 {,r2,r3,etc} : reg

  From there, you'll need to change what values get stuffed into what reg,
and sometimes what the code does, do to the differences in CPU and reg sizes.
This pretty much has to be done on a call by call basis.

INKEY for Basic/00 is different than in Basic/09... it returns the
number of characters in the input buffer (I suppose it's just like a
_gs_rdy() in C).  So, it doesn't actually get the character for you.  Do
something like:

DIM numchars:INTEGER
DIM keypress:STRING[1]

100 numchars=INKEY(#0)
if numchars<1 then 100
get #0,keypress

It's syntactically correct, but...

1. BASIC09/Microware BASIC will let you do better than that!

   REPEAT
      numchars:=INKEY(0)
   UNTIL numchars>0
   GET #0,keypress

2. Over and above control flow questions, it's not nice on a multitasking
   operating system to do a "busy wait" loop like that--it hogs the system
   waiting for what's probably a SLLLOOWWWW human to press a key.  Consider

   LOOP
     numchars:=INKEY(0)
     EXITIF numchars>0 THEN ENDEXIT
     RUN bgfx("sleep", 1)
   ENDLOOP
   GET #0,keypress

   as an alternative that other processes will thank you for.  To be even
   more considerate, using the SS_SSIG setstat, takes some more work.

You can compress VEF with most anything, but the archivers which work better
on binary files for input like lzh format is best. GIF on the other hand
is already compressed using the same compression algorithm lzh uses. So,
you can archive them, but you will find that most of the time the
archived version of the file is actually larger than the original file!

   With the VEF files you can use either AR or LZH and get good
compression.  Don't bother with the GIF files.. they're compressed
darn tight in that GIF format.  Have fun archiving <g>.

Most GIFs are compressed by nature so any compression program will just
store them.  Most VEFs though are not compressed and I would suspect that
LHA (much better than LZH) will compress them the tightest.  That is...
until we get a Zip on the CoCo... I use Zip (or is it gzip) on my Unix
account and it compresses mail messages about 75% (25% of previous size).
This is much better than 13 bit compress or even lha.

Good luck.

Brother Jeremy,

VEF files come in a couple of flavors, original and extra crispy--er,
run length encoded.  Either AR or LZH should do quite well with the
original, and tolerably well with the run length encoded.

GIF files, on the other hand, are already 12-bit LZW compressed--that's
why it takes so long to display them, you have to uncompress the data
as well as displaying it.  For that reason, you're unlikely to get much
in the way of compression out of GIF files.

(BTW, this past Saturday I had my first neume reading experience.
My skills definitely need work.)

     Review of Microsoft Windows 4.0 <grin>
     From: MARTYGOODMAN To: ALL


- -------------------forwards removed--------------------
*** REVIEW: - AMAZING WINDOWS 4.0 ***

We are privileged this month to bring you our long overdue article on
Microsoft's groundbreaking Operating System, the incredible Windows 4.0. Our
exceptional journalistic standards demand that we preface this article by a
restatement of our policy concerning review of non-shipping products. While our
policy has always been that we would review no product that is not actually
shipping at the time of publication, WE HAVE CHANGED OUR POLICY FOR THIS ISSUE
ONLY. Our policy for this issue is that we will review any product that someone
tells us might possibly be developed at any time in the future. After this
issue, our policy will revert to what it was prior to this issue until such
time that Microsoft begins to again consider their next edition of software and
begins another high-visibility promotion geared to discourage users from
looking at the competition.

We put the wonderful Windows 4.0 operating system through our grueling bench
benchmark program which was magnanimously donated to PC Labs by Microsoft
Corporation. Our test bed was the standard by platform used most PC users--a
Cray Supercomputer with 3 Gigabytes of RAM and a $9000 Windows graphics
accelerator card with 512 Megabytes of SRAM. Our testing was made more
difficult by the fact that no actual code was available at the time of the
procedure. We did have available, however, a screen shot of the stupendous
Windows 4.0 which we put through its paces. Our staff was speechless over how
pretty the screen shot was. We also had the benefit of the assistance of 12
Microsoft employees who provided invaluable input, and also took us to lunch as
well as provide us all with free copies of MicroSoft Office.

The tremendous Windows 4.0 was a dream to install. We didn't even have to open
the box! All of our applications were immediately migrated into the new OS,
except the OS/2 applications. They mysteriously disappeared. We were told that
this is a bug in the way that OS/2 apps are written and that this was IBM's
problem. The screen shot scored a respectable .000001 Winmarks on our testing
platform. Microsoft officials assure us that performance of the actual code
promises to be even better. The only compatibility problem arose when OS/2 for
Windows stubbornly refused to load the screen shot. Microsoft officials advise
us that this was also IBM's problem.

Microsoft officials told us that 4 Megabytes of RAM minimum would be needed in
the release version. However, they also said that they would recommend 32
Megabytes for typical usage. Microsoft officials said, and we agree, that all
serious PC users will have 32 Megabytes of RAM on their systems by the time Win
4.0 is released. Windows 4.0 is too sophisticated an OS for those that refuse
to keep up.

We were at first concerned with the reports of the apparent absence of 32-bit
code contained in Windows 4.0. However, the Microsoft officials soon set us
straight. Due to Microsoft still having the patent pending for the new
technology, MS officials couldn't tell us how it worked, but told us of a new
Microsoft compression technology. It turns out that all of the apparent 16-bit
code present in Win 4.0 is actually 32-bit bit code that has been compressed by
Microsoft to look like it is only 16 bits. Microsoft officials say that this is
the wave of the future in 32-bit computing.

In order for you to take advantage of the power of Win 4.0, Microsoft will be
releasing three new products. These products are Visual COBOL,Visual Assembler
and Visual Machine Language. The Microsoft representatives gave us a sneak peak
of the Visual Machine Language product. Visual Machine Language will contain
the famous Microsoft App Wizard. At first the App Wizard looked like it was
only generating huge random streams of ones and zeros. However, one
representative assured us that this was not the case and that MS had used it to
write most of the Windows NT code.

In summary, we can state without any fear of being accused of hyperbole that
the most excellent Windows 4.0 is the greatest technological breakthrough since
the discovery of fire and the invention of the wheel (neither of which,
unfortunately, is patented by Microsoft..... yet). The God-like Windows 4.0
ranks right up there with the other accomplishments of Microsoft, such as the
graphical user interface,the mouse, memory management and on-the-fly disk
compression.

It is at this point that we should state PC Magazine's new policy with regard
to software patents, viz., We feel strongly that any software patent not held
by Microsoft is void and bad for the industry.

There will be a plethora of applications specifically written to take advantage
of the astounding Windows 4.0. All major software developers are expected to
begin work on products immediately after reading this article. Versions of
WordPerfect and Lemmings for Win 4.0 should be shipping by the time you read
this. If you cannot wait for your copy of the sexy Windows 4.0, we suggest you
immediately go out and buy a copy of the highly innovative MS-DOS 6.2. Follow
that up with several copies of the award winning Windows for Workgroups 3.11.
If you are still impatient, buy the long awaited Windows NT, which is available
in bulk quantity from your local retailer at huge discounts. By that time, if
the most esteemed Windows 4.0 is still not shipping, buy a few more copies of
Windows NT.

While we usually don't give awards to products that are not even in Alpha
release, we feel that we have no choice but to award our prestigious ZIFF-DAVIS
Editor's Choice to the awesome Microsoft Windows 4.0. And even though it is
only July, we have also given it our ZIFF-DAVIS Year-End Technical Excellence
Award in ALL categories for the years 1994 through 1999. We expect an even
better version of Windows in the year 2000. So, what are you waiting for?

     OS-9 Patches for the Coco III
     From: MROWEN01     To: ALL

     I've caught up on the messages piled up here from the past week. I'm
putting my two cents worth in here because I am a "late bloomer" when it comes
to Cocoing. I only discovered Delphi about a year ago. Until then, I was pretty
clueless about OS/9. I could write simple programs in C and MWBasic09. I had
some software and I finally purchased a COCOXT for an ST-255. It wasn't until
I got a Delphi account and started cruising this SIG, that I even began to
do anything substantial with my Coco 3. However, it is apparent to me that I
am behind on much of the technical knowledge most message posters here have
aquired. This started me on the road to patching the living @#$% out of my
OS. Now I have encountered the so called BLOB. It seems to be a subject that
makes forum memebers weary. It's probably been discussed to death. What course
of action should a user like me expect. I'm in a difficult situation. I'm
trying to learn so that I can possibly contribute to other new users. This
forum is the only place where I can be "mentored" to a decent level of
understanding. I don't want to clutter the forum with old old problems, but I
have no other source for help. If you caught Mark Griffith's message on the
Cocolist, you know that some users are hanging it up, hopefully not because of
people like me.

     Discussing standards is kind of pointless with so many patches out there
for Level II, but it would be nice to at least understand some of them. My
real intent is to determine whether someone is willing to donate some time to
help me fix my system, or should I go the way of Mark Griffith? I love my
Coco and it does what I need it to do, but when I pushed a bit further, I
created the BLOB. When my system is running OK, I marvel at what OS-9 and
my Coco can do. When I screw it up badly trying to add yet another capability
I start to feel guilty begging for help here on the forum. I don't know if
other's feel the same way, but I believe there are a number of members who
read the forum and never post must of anything. If you are willing to help me
offline, sent me a mail message. If I am annoying everyone with my problems,
send me a mail message telling me so. Many of you have helped me in the past.
I'm in a bind that's over my head now. Many of you are now using OSK. I can't
afford the leap right now. To sum it up, I feel kind of bad because I take
without ever giving much other than some loyalty to the OS-9 community. Your
responses are appreciated.

Isn't Delphi amazing?  I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't "connected"
to the outside world.  I also didn't know what I was missing until I got
onto Delphi.

 > Now I have encountered the so called BLOB.

I don't have much experience with this, but I know it seemed to be a
very technical problem that people could not seem to agree on what the
cause was.  I heard discussions on memory swap timing problems,
byte-alignment stuff, etc.  Whatever the cause, BLOB stands for Boot
List Order Bug, so try changing the order of your boot modules until you
get something that works.  I only once had a BLOB problem (before I
moved to MM/1 OS-9/68000), and I just rearranged things until they were
working.  I believe Eddie Kuns uploaded a possible BLOB fix to the
database here, so you may want to do a search for BLOB there.

 > If you caught Mark Griffith's message on the Cocolist, you know that

Nah, I don't think anyone would leave OS-9 because someone asked for
help learning OS-9.  That's what we love to see! The reason why Mark is
leaving is lack of professional applications and, what he views, as no
potential for OS-9 in the personal computer market.  I'm unsure about
OS-9's personal computer future, but I know it works great for me on my
personal computer, and I haven't found an OS that I'd rather use (and
I've used LOTS of them).  You choose what's best for you.  I believe
Boisy posted some excellent points in his recent message as to why OS-9
truly is a fantastic OS for personal computers.

 > or should I go the way of Mark Griffith? I love my Coco

I hope you don't choose Mark's path, for the reason you stated above...
"I love my CoCo".  Don't give up the things you love.

Hey, if I felt guilty about asking for on-line help here, I would really
be in bad shape.  There are no stupid questions.  Sometimes I may feel a
little dumb after asking a question I realize I knew the answer to, or
found in my manual the next day, but people are always happy to help
I've found.  And besides, you're not "begging for help", rather you're
"asking for assistance".

 > To sum it up, I feel kind of bad because I take without ever giving

That's something OS-9 desperately needs... I'm glad you've found an OS
you can be loyal to.  I did.

     From: MITHELEN     To: JOELHEGBERG

General concensus seems to be that, cc3disk tends to be semi position dependant
and that only 1 in ever 4 byte positions will produce a truely stable floppy
access. 2 of the positions will usually work, but may be flakey, and the last
position will mostlikely give the "BLOB". The typical fix to a BLOBed boot is
to add 1-3 bytes (I usually just add 2, since that has always worked) to
the end of a module that is before cc3disk in the boot file (usually init).
This can be done with the "xtend" command within EZgen (which people with
a Burke^2 hard disk setup should already have) Or, use DeD to "diddle" the
length
of init before os9gen'ing a new boot disk...

Thanks for your feedback Joel! I7ve already gotten a few mail responses with
some help. The BLOB has always been referenced to but never fully explained. I
guess I can understand why now. I'm working with some very sizable manuscript
stuff right now. I'm using ved and vprint. Would you recommend this same set
of tools under OSK or is there something more elaborate under OSK? Again
thanks for taking the time to respond. I guess Mark's message made me think
about what I'm doing with OS-9. I'm trying to patch things to the point where I
can do document processing, read/write PCDOS files, and support an additional
user who is terminal connected. One of my first problems was finding an editor
for use on a terminal. Finding none, I have been writing one with BASIC09. IT's
half done. I started in C but have some learning to do yet. Do you know of
a terminal editor anywhere? I expected to see something VT100 capable, but the
search has been fruitless so far. I didn't even see UNIX C code that I could
adapt. Delphi is amazing.

The "BLOB" has been around a while and driven a lot of people to #$%^ a lot!
<G> The RBF file MUST be within one block...The CC3Disk and others also...
there is a electronic fix also which fixes the Timming problem,I have not had a
BLOB problem since!<touch wood> the Electronic fix strangly enough is VERY
much the same as the OLD org fix for the ORG 64k computer...back then 64k was
a do it yourself add on,the problem was the ROM was getting into the 64k memory
causing problems! the fix was a Gate clocking the Rom select chip!
The FIX for the CoCo-3 is basicly the same!    S1 to gate....E to gate
 Gate to pin 5<I think>pin has to be cut and bent up...The 74ls02 can be hung
on top of the 74ls138.......I think there is a file on it in the Database!
Timming fix!........I did this fix to mine! and I use a HD6309E instead of the
MC6809E......

There are several things more elaborate under OSK: one would be TeX and
LaTeX; another would be Lout and either a PostScript printer or GhostScript.
BUT...that doesn't necessarily mean that I wouldn't recommend ved and
vprint under OSK!  The OSK versions are even better than the 6809 versions,
and the kved front end for ved makes it very easy to use.

Dear Joel:
One of the most enjoyable parts of OS-9 for me has been the willingness of
people to be willing to answer questions.  Goodness, if asking stupid
questions was a crime, I would be Public Enemy #1....I have said this many
times, there is a wonderful spirit of cooperation here.  People who I have
met on-line have become very dear friends to me.  I would think that even
if the day came when I would move on to another system, as long as there is
this Forum, I would still stop in to say hello.  You know, there are so
many special moments for me as I look back over these past 7 or 8 years.
Getting started...going on-line...the Fests...my humble offerings to the
group...our special time of fellowship on Sunday morning...I can't put a
price on this.  The technical knowledge I have gained is worth a Degree,
but the intangible things far go beyond that.  I guess, I'm in it for
the duration.

With all best wishes,
Brother Jeremy, CSJW

Well, yes, there is something more powerful under OSK -- called Ved and
Vprint <g>.  You'd feel right at home -- but have a built-in spellchecker,
multiple edit buffers, column operations and a myriad of other
enhancements.  Bob seems to add a new feature to Ved every 2 weeks...

A good choice for that would be DynaStar, which was my mainstay for
editing under both Level 1 and Level 2.
