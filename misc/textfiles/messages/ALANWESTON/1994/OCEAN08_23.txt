Has anything ever been thought out on the K-Windows logo?

I would really like to include it in my program before Atlanta.

I know David is being careful not to be overly optimistic but
that must be a slip of the keyboard ! Maybe his key caps got switched !

Subj: OS-9 Clipboard

Just another brief message regarding the forthcoming OS-9 Clipboard
library... Currently, the G-Windows implementation is being ported by a
good friend of mine. Before releasing the K-Windows implementation and
the Generic implementation I want to be sure the parameters I've
provided are adequate for the G-Windows port to provide consistency in
the libraries.

Thanks for all of the email and interest in this project. Several
programmers who have looked at the library have already said they are
excited about how it works, how easy it is to use, and are committed to
supporting it in their software! This comes from K-Windows programmers,
G-Windows programmers, and others, which means we may finally have found
the bridge we've needed for data transfer between applications!

The library will be available very shortly (for free, of course!) for
general use.

Best wishes,

I agree with Boisy... we must come to an agreement on the K-Windows logo
very quickly. Some new members have joined this list, and we also now
have the audience of the MM/1 Tech echo, so perhaps I should fill in the
holes here.

A while ago, a few of us posted a few possibilities for an official
K-Windows graphical logo. We have a couple GIF files of the samples.
I'd like to get a vote on which one people like best in the next week.
So, here's a plan that might work. Go ahead and review the gif files.
Anyone who does not have the GIF files, send me a message and I'll email
you the UUEncoded gif's to look at. In a few days, I'll call for a
vote and may the best logo win! :)

Paul,
Actually if I had just did a 'format -?' I would have found the key
to the error msg. I got when attempting to format. The error msg alone
tells you 'cluster size to small, must be at least 2' or something to
that effect.
What I would like to know is if SCSI 2 drives will work correctly
on the MM/1 with the drivers we have ?

Subj: Clipboard

Hi, Joel.

Was thinking about one addition -- a method of copying one
block of memory to the clipboard, and then back to memory.
This would be needed (I think) under systems with a SSM.

mem_to_clip() - copies a block of memory to the clipboard
clip_to_mem() -        the clipboard        a block of memory

  HI all,
 
  Seeing this talk about pushing/popping/reading the cursor's position
reminded me that I have found a set of display codes that push and pop the
cursor's position:
 
 $1b37 <col> <row> - push cursor position
 $1b38 <col> <row> - pop cursor position
 
I don't know of any way to READ the cursor's current position, though.

Think about it people (we've been through this before.) The bitmap size is
two bytes. Each bit is one cluster (usu. one sector) thus you can have
65536*8 clusters. At 512 bytes per sector (1 sector per cluster) that gives
you 256MB per disk. You can change the sector size or the cluster size or
partition the drive.

Glad to hear that things have been moving along, opening the library to
non KW environments.

A question comes to mind: is there any provision for maintaining
ownership of the clipboard info (i.e., userid)?

Example 1: If my son saves something in the clipboard, will my daughter
be able to access it if she later logs in? (Each has their own userid
on the system.) Ideally, she should have her own private clipboard.

Example 2: On a KiX30 with running G-Windows on multiple MGA boards,
will ownership integrity be maintained? Similarly, on any other system
with multiple users logged in simultaneously?

Hopefully, you've already covered this, or else it won't be too tough
to implement.

Cheers... / Ken

Subj: MM/1 Dev Group note!

Recently, I've added a few new people to this developers list.
First of all, glad to have all of you!

The reason I'm writing this message is because I just realized I added
these people without filling them in on what _not_ to do on this list!
The problems stem from the way the mail server works... namely, it's not
a mail server, rather just a user account with a shell script doing the
work. This works fine in most cases, but...

NEVER EVER EVER send a message with an astrick character in it... not
even in your signature!! You see, each word in your message is
considered to be a parameter to the shell script forwarding your mailing
(which is why additional spaces between words is stripped out). The
astrick is taken to be a wild-card character and is replaced by all the
filenames in mushroom's directory... which is many many many!! Please
review your signature files and remove any astricks, and try to remain
aware and alert to any astricks that may be in your messages. C source
code files are especially treacherous!

Also, if the system that receives your electronic email will expire, go
down, or for any other reason bounce mail back to the mushroom "server",
please try and alert me _before_ this will occur! There appears to be an
inifinite loop problem as the shell script does not handle the error
condition properly and everyone on the list gets flooded with tons of
email error messages continuously until someone goes up and stops it
some way (Boisy, can you tell me how you stopped it last time?).

Don't be troubled by this message... the system has worked very well for
all of us so far. The inifinite loop thing has only happened once, and
if you do accidently include an astrick or two in your message, you'll
notice it real fast when your message is sent back to you and quickly
learn not to do it again. :) Thanks for your time.

 Joel Mathew Hegberg.

There are calls to copy raw memory to the clipboard, but the method is
currently associated with "display codes". I like the mem_to_clip() and
clip_to_mem() ideas, so I think I'll add those to make things even
simpler. Thanks!

Subj: Joystick Info

I got this last night from Mike Haaland, and thought it would be
good to pass around in case anyone hasn't seen it.

  -----

For the last few years I've had this real strange problem with the MM/1
joystick ports. It seems that the values it returns are bogus.

Well, I finally needed to use the port and this is what I discovered.

From ground to the high side of the pot in the joystick I get approx.
.85 volts. From ground to the center poll of the pot I was getting 1.7
volts. Wierd.

Problem:

Joystick centered returned. x=80, y=80.
Joystick Upper Left returned. x=0 , y=0.
Joystick Lower Right returned. x=60, y=60.

Solution:

Remove pin 5 (+5V) the joystick internally.

Now I get,

Joystick centered returned. x=80, y=80.
Joystick Upper Left returned. x=0 , y=0.
Joystick Lower Right returned. x=110, y=110.

Problem solved.

NOTE:

It turns out some of the earlier MM/1 I/O boards have 100 Ohm
resisters installed as R-13 and R-14. This is causing the problem.

Better solution:

If the resistors R-13 and R-14 are 100 Ohm, replace them with
200 Ohm resistors. After replacing them I get the following
values:

Joystick centered returned. x=100, y=100.
Joystick Upper Left returned. x=0 , y=0.
Joystick Lower Right returned. x=127, y=127.

I'm not sure why but the above values tend to float by +/-5.

I just might try 220 Ohm resistors to see if I can bring the
center values down to around 65. Any ideas?


Here's the program I use to test it with.

/* ssjoy.c - Mike Haaland <mike@htsmm1.las-vegas.nv.us> */

#include <stdio.h>

#define XADDR 0xE00100

Ok kiddies, I'm getting ready to open my machine up for network access, but
the d*mned shells on OS-9 systems have to have write access to chd to them.
The was a shell fix for this but it isn't working on the MM/1. The shell
in the kernel module directory is supposed to have this anoying "feature"
fixed. All the other shells use the defaults in the cio trap library or
the clib library. What I want is to fix the libraries so this doesn't happen
and then fix the existing applications (shell, sh, bash, etc.)

The only thing I can tell you is the 2.5" hard drives would be used.

In article 173@rcisnet.org, rcisnet2!rcis_hq!coco_hacker () writes:
:PCF is included with OS-9, as far as I know. Its a PC-DOS file manager,
:which allows you to access PC-DOS disks as if they were OS-9 disks (well
:almost).

According to Microware's White Paper on OS-9 V3.0 the PCF software will form
part of the "disk-based" and "extended" OS-9 configurations.

With V3.0 Microware has changed from having Industrial OS-9 and Professional
OS-9. There will be 6 different configurations:

1. Atomic OS-9
2. Atomic Node OS-9
3. Embedded OS-9
4. Embedded Node OS-9
5. Disk-Based OS-9
6. Extended OS-9

and the software that each comprises is summarised below:

1 2 3 4 5 6 ! OS-9 Software Modules
---------------+-------------------------
x x x x x x ! Atomic Kernel
- - x x x x ! Standard Kernel
x x x x x x ! IOMan
- - x x x x ! PIPE (named/unnamed pipes)
- - x x x x ! SCF (serial/parallel)

! ! ! ! +-----> Disk-Based
! ! ! +-------> Embedded Node
! ! +---------> Embedded
! +-----------> Atomic Node
+-------------> Atomic

I am sure you will find the above table interesting. It provides some
interesting pointers to the way things are going. In particular the NFS
client support in Atomic-Node, Embedded-Node and Extended is a clear
indicator that FasTrak is Microware's strategic technology for development in
the future.

BTW can anyone say whether FasTrak will be ported to platforms other than
SUN3, SUN4 and HP9000? What about SG machines? This is especially important
since Unibridge is available for SG machines and the single-workstation
Unibridge is not good value when compared against a 5 workstation FasTrak!

Get a copy of the White Paper ... it contains interesting information.

Ciao!

Subj: Gone Temporarily

This is just a quick note. Any mail sent to me may not get a reply for
a couple days, depending on the local SprintNet node (actually phone
connections). The problem is due to a very bad storm that hit DeKalb
yesterday (at least 4 funnel clouds sighted, 2 touched down on my side
of town). There really isn't lots of damage... trees down and snapped
telephone poles, downed power lines, streets littered with branches and
such. The SprintNet connection is very sporadic now as repairs go
underway, and power will be out for a bit tomorrow as they try to
restore power to the South East side of town and to right the telephone
poles.

I was at work when the storm hit (I work at a restaurant to get me
through college) and was safe inside the store's cooler while one of the
tornadoes passed by, while others hid under the tables. (I'm not sure
why they did that... really no protection and there are about 10 huge
glass windows in the main room, which would really cause some injuries
if they were blown in!)

I'm connecting to Delphi via the local University using a friend's
system, but won't be on again until SprintNet comes back up, so talk to
everyone shortly!

Joel,
    Unfortunately I didn't get around to reading this until long after
you posted it, but I thought I would add my 2 cents worth anyway. About
a year ago I wrote out a MM/1 Clipboard Standard. I just never took the
time to implement it. There's two points that I think need to be made
about your proposal.
    Even though no one may ever take the time to write the software to
do it, I think its necessary to prepare for every reasonable
possibility, and by reasonable I mean whatever the "mainstream" systems
are doing. The standard I wrote accomodated for text only, graphics
only, sound only, animation w/out sound and animation w/sound. As far as 
the animated clips go, I was thinking of supporting Apple's QuickTime
format, but I was never able to get ahold of the specs for it. We may
never use it, but it would be nice to know that it was provided for if
someone ever wanted to give it a try.
    I'm not quite sure exactly what you have in mind for displaying
clipboard item(s) once they've been saved to the clipboard. From your
proposal I couldn't tell if the program had to have its own routine for
looking into the clipboard or if it would be a system function. I
believe we should "borrow" the basics of the Mac's method. A program
should simply call the universal clipboard accessing routine, and that
routine would pop up a window over the program and display the clips,
allowing you to scroll through them. The program would also be able to
tell the clip viewer when it calls it exactly which types of clips it
can support, and the clip viewer would only display those clips that fit 
the description, (i.e. a word pro would ask for only text clips, and the 
viewer would then ignore everything else.)
    From the sounds of your last messages it sounds as though it's too
late to even consider this, but oh well, I'll just have to react faster
next time.

Date    : 94/08/22 22:58:51

    Digital Fronteir Productions, (formerly VideoSonic Productions,) the 
company that brought ShellMate, Image Master and Gambit to the MM/1, is
now very proud to announce the release of the first full-screen
animation, arcade style, action game ever for the MM/1.
 
Introducing...
 
                    Gold Runner 2000
 
    This name may be familiar to long-time CoCo users, as Gold Runner
and Gold Runner 2: The Sequel, (both of which were clones of the
immensely popular game Lode Runner from Broderbund for mainstream
computer systems,) were two of the most popular games in Color Computer
history. As its name implies, however, Gold Runner 2000 is a variation
on the theme that's decades beyond its early 80's predecessors.
 
Gold Runner 2000 Features:
 
  * Full screen horizontal and vertical scrolling on a 312 x 208 x 256
    screen
 
  * 30 levels of play, each consisting of a 3 x 3 screen playing field
 
  * Over 16 Megabytes of graphics data
 
  * A complete digital stereo soundtrack consisting of seperate tracks
    for each level as well as intro and outro music
 
  * Over 6 Megabytes of stereo sound data
 
 
Gold Runner 2000 System Requirements:
 
  * 3Meg MM/1 or MM/1a
 
  * Hard drive (highly recommended)
 
  * Stereo speakers (highly recommended)
 
  * Joystick (optional)
 
 
    Gold Runner 2000 will begin shipping on Thursday, August the 25th.
For ordering information, see the complete release announcement on
Delphi or Compuserve, or leave me e-mail.

Message # 2705 *MM1 TECH Echo*
To      : All
From    : Eric Crichlow
Subject : MM/1 vs. CD-i
Date    : 94/08/22 23:12:44

    I originally posted this msg to Delphi, but it unfortunately got
very little response, so I figured I'd try it here. (I'd try it on the
Mushroom list if I had access! <hint> :) )
 
With the recent conversation online here about CD-i and the titles
available for it I've been thinking. As a programmer I have tapped the
limits of how much speed I can get out of a 68070 equipped MM/1 using C
to do full-screen scrolling while programming "by the rules". Yet when I 
look at some of the titles available on CD-i that do full-screen
scrolling they do it several times faster, and I'm sure CD-i programmers 
aren't programming in assembly.
 
    This leads me to 2 possible reasons for the performance difference,
(well, 3 reasons, but the most obvious, poor programming on my part,
I've ruled out since 2 other programmers whose opinion I value highly
agree that the code I'm using couldn't be done any more efficiently,)
first, it could be that CD-i programmers are using features of the 68070 
that we aren't, or second, the extra VSC chip that CD-i has is giving
them extra power to utilize.
 
    If option 1 is correct, then what are they getting out of the 68070
that we aren't? I must admit to being somewhat, if not completely
ignorant of the hardware abilities that lie outside of the normal range
of programming, but one thing that comes to mind is our DMA channels.
Maybe I'm off on what DMA really is, but, as I understand it, aren't we
using 1 DMA channel for sound and the other for SCSI device access? Is
it possible for a programmer to change this setup in a program so that
one channel gets used for sound and the other gets used to speed up
movement of screen data to screen memory?
 
    If option 2 is correct, and the second VSC chip gives them more
programming power, then the 1 VSC we have should give us SOME extra
programming power. I know the VSC has a PIXAC, and its my understanding
that the only thing we're using it for is the mouse pointer. Can we get  
access to the PIXAC from within C? Or would we have to program in
assembly? Since K-Windows is using it for the mouse pointer, would
accessp K-Windows? Are there other VSC features that we aren't using or
don't have access to?
 
    Whether DMA or the PIXAC is the answer to the CD-i speed difference, 
the reason for their underutilization on the MM/1 is tied directly to
K-Windows, and how Kevin decided to use them. As much as I love
K-Windows and regard Kevin Darling as a top-notch programmer, I don't
think he wrote K-Windows with optimizing graphics manipulation in mind,
whereas CD-i was designed with just that purpose in mind. Can we gain
access to these underutilized features of the MM/1 hardware without
wreaking havoc on K-Windows and remain "within the rules" of OS9?
 
    Are both of these options incorrect, and there's another reason for
the performance difference?
