Tim,
    Are you on the MM/1 developers list ?.  That is the one closed to
non developers/dealers/programmers.
    RE RiBBS_OSK, John got sidetracked a bit when the rains came and
then the river fire.  In fact his plant is 1/2 mile from river where a
barge was on fire and his Co. closed down and sent everybody home.
     When he does get a working release I don't know if he wants the
bother of sending out disks, keeping track of who has what etc so I have 
volunteered to  help that way.  Also I can adapt the RiBBS docs for the
OSK version and may do that.
    Yes thanks to David Graham and a bunch of dedicated developers for
not giving up on the MM/1.  David has pulled it together and is now
getting the 9meg upgrade boards out and also new systems.

From    : William Chapple
Subject : SysCall
Date    : 94/10/22 12:49:12

 
Bill,
^^^^
What I am looking for is the correcceader for the registers used by
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
syscall.  What I have is:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  TYPE=address D(8),A(8),PC:INTEGER
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
John,
 
     Here is how I setup to call syscall from Microware BASIC:
 
 TYPE registers=d0,d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6,d7,a0,a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,cc:INTEGER
 DIM regs:registers
 DIM callcode:INTEGER
 
Notice there are eight data registers and seven address registers, and
following is the CC register.  All are integers.
 
You can check the CC register after you call syscall.  I sometimes check
it for any possible errors that may occur during the call...
 
As for the PC register, its not passed to/from basic and syscall in any
way that the basic program can check it??  Now if you changed PC to CC
in your example above, that would look more like it...
 
The above is from BASIC's point of view.  If you are working on an
assembly language program and want to access the passed registers,
there is a listing of the syscall program in the Microware BASIC version
2.3 user's manual, end of appendix A on page A-19.  It should help give
you an idea of how to check for them...
 
Its something I haven't tried yet on OS9/68k <G>.
 
Also it says the register pack must be at least 48 bytes in size, for
registers D0 thru A4,but this is incorrect...  It would be 52 bytes for
registers d0 thru A4 plus the CC register, or, 8 data registers + 4
address
registers + the CC register Times 4 bytes for each register = 52 bytes.
The Microware BASIC release notes for version 2.3 tellss the above error
and says it should be 52 bytes.
 
I hope this helps clear things up a little <G>!
 
 
The way I check the CD and handle the DTR for now.  In the MM/1 tech
manual
it describes how to check the cd and other things for the ports, but not
all info is given!  For now all I can do is check the CD and handle DTR
on
port /T0.  The MC68901 IC on the processor board provides control
functions
for devices on the board. The following table shows the functions
handled
by the MC68901 and the MC68901 GPDR (General Purpose Data Register) bits
that you can access to get at them:
 ________________________________________________________________ 
 |   7   |   6   |   5   |   4   |   3   |   2   |   1   |   0   |
 |-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
 | KeyBd | Modem | Floppy| Motor | Master|Carrier| Drive | debug |
 |  IRQ  |  DTR  |  IRQ  |  ON   | Slave |Detect | Ready |       |
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 
o Keyboard IRQs can be turned off by masking bit 7, floppy drive IRQs
can
  be turned off by setting bit 5 to zero, etc, etc...
 
o Modem control lines are handled in the same way:  You can toggle the
DTR
  on port /t0 by setting/resetting bit 6.  You can also 'read' the GPDR
  to get the status of the above.  To check for the CD you would read
  the MC68901 GPDR and mask to detect only bit 2.  A ZERO means the CD
  is high (Got CD).  The address of the GPDR on the processor board is
  $09ffc01.
 
This method can be used to check ports /T0 and /T2, but the /T3 and
/T4 ports use the MC68681 DUART, and I don't know the address of the
6-bit input and 8-bit output control ports.  I just got a /t3 port and
will be checking it out soon.
 
I haven't tried port /T2 because its my mouse port, but it should work
by
checking address $0e00381, but bit 0 = CD, bit 1 = DTR, the other bits
control sound mode, SCSI, etc..
 
/T1 doesn't support CD and DTR.
 
I have in mind to make a cd watchdog type program that uses the SS_DCoff
and SS_DCon I$Setstt calls, but haven't decided exacly how I want to
handle
it yet.  Seems a lot like the ML program you mentioned...
 
Well, I guess I've talked (typed) enough tech-talk for now <G>.  I hope
at least some of this will help you out somewhere!
Now for a quick question -  I am trying my hand at C, and it would help
a lot if I had a book on K&R C.  Where can I find such a book?

  Hi Warren,  this is just a test to message to see if I'm getting out. Since
the echo has been turned on, I haven't seen anything come in, so I thought I'd
post a message to see if I can get it kicked in the pants to get it going.

Yep Houston was a mess. Not that I wish it on anyone, but I'm gald it didn't
get that bad here. I'd have to say that RiBBS_OSK would have to be a real LOW

Agreed, David seems to have done a great job sparking the forward development

"super OSK programmers" in the advancement of K-windows.

Brian,
    Are you now solidly located ?  I have had go arounds with Brenda
about FD 2.20. She claims there is no new release fixing the timeout
bug.  You mentioned it was available a while back, what gives ??
    I just tried freq'ng the new osk files from Tim Jones's system and
it hung up before mine could send the xxxxxx.req.  Dont know if he
supports freq for OCN OSK files or not.  Anyway keep on keying !
    BTW The RiBBS_OSK is getting closer and closer.

You made it at least half way to Warren. I asked about the slowness of this
echo a while back and Warren pointed out the some of the internet message
areas about the MM/1 are not being crossposted here any more.

We need to make some sort of correction to your distribution notice.  I
do not have the OSK files on the Coco Exchange.  Since Warren Hrach is
maitaining a library of OSK files on his BBS, and we are in the same 
area of the country (San Diego), and I have a limited amount of storage
space (the Coco Exchange is and will stay on a Coco), Warren and I
agreed to this split.

Hi all:
  I am looking for information on using both p and p1 ports at the same
time to connect two printers.  I have been read that the two ports
will not work together and that only one can be connected at a time.
If anyone has current information or has used this configuration I would
like to know.
  I have tried the system with both p and p1 connected and when I try to
use p1 the system locks and must be rebooted.  Thanks in advance.
 
                                    George Hine

Brian,
    Thanks for setting up the new files I was looking for. Hope you get
your RiBBS system up again and can check on why my freq has been flaky.
    Please check on any sources you may have for RiBBS , namely rlist,
cparslst, bundle and unbundle and menushrink and let me know if
available for John A Donaldson to use with the RiBBS_OSK port.  We do
have the orginal basic09 sources for bundle and mailimport.
