Humm, I wonder what that is? I've had so many diff versions of cc3io go thru
here that I long since gave up! I did the patch that lets me use the seriel
mouse, and then patched that one to get rid of the slow disk bug caused by
a clashing of IRQ mask bytes, and haven't changed it since. Do you have the
seriel mouse? If so, then the one I'm useing will probably work b but may
need an address patch if you're using the 4n1 seriel as the mouse port. I'm
using a set of pgyy-backed chips in the regular 232 pack, just never got
around to mmaking up the cable to use the 4n1 with it. Nothing else would
change except that address as far as I know. Cheers Mike, Gene  WDTV5@delphi.com

Not so!!!  The speed of light (c) is aa universal CONSTANT, which cannot be
exceeded.  Hence the light from the headlamps would travel forward at the same
speed as the car, as viewed from a stationary observer.  Time and distance
compression of the driver would cause the light to appear to move forward at
the speed of light (c) relative to the driver, but that would require total
(100%) time and distance compression (i.e., distance = 0 and time =0).  This
phenomenum implies that  travel in excess of the  speed of light causes
distance and time inversion, the basis for reverse time travel theory.  The
unanswered question is whether sufficient energy exists to accelerate any
real mass to or beyond the speed of light, and if mass converts to energy at
the speed of light
of light , since energy is the only known quantity able to travel
at that speed.  Perhaps mass travelling in our universe in excess of the
speed of light is actually anti-matter travelling at the inverse speed.  The
acceleration attainable by close orbiting or directly targeting a black hole
(near infinite gravity) is hypothesized as adequate to attain or exceed the
speed of light, but who knows?  Any volunteers?

 What happens when a value greater than c is used the equations involve the

 The answer is simple, it takes infinite energy to accelerate a non zero rest
 mass to light speed.  The truth of the equations that predict this get
 tested a million times a year in particle accelerators all over the world.
 No deviations from the predictions of special relativity yet.

 There is a way to approach a collapsar in a spacelike way and leave it in a
 timelike way so it _may_ be possible to move backward in time but you will
 still never exceed the speed of light.

 If that isn't confusing enough, consider that if you had a "wormhole" and
 put one end on a spacecraft headed off to A Centauri and back at .99c whilst
 the other end stayed at home you might think the total trip would take nine
 years for the stay at homes and about 1 1/4 years for the travelers.
 However, general relativity requires that the two ends of that worm hole have
 to be "synchronized" and the total trip takes 1 1/4 years in both frames of
 reference.  But you will still never exceed the speed of light!

 Before somebody starts pointing out the things that were "impossible" in the
 past that are commonplace now, I'll add that we are dealng with a fund-
 amental law of the universe, not someones' opinion.  Relativity has been
 tested against reality for over half a century and has never failed to yield
 accurate predictions.  That adds up to a pretty solid theory and is as close
 to certainty as an honest person can ever come.  It may not be a complete
 picture of reality but it is not a wrong one.  Any future theory must
 account for relativity just as relativity had to account for Newtonian
 mechanics.

Yeah, I thought about that after I posted the message -- my

light.  As far as the rest -- when (yeah, WHEN, not IF)
someone does find a way to get somewhere a light-year away

In one way, quite a bit (e.g. demolished Newton's notion of absolute time);
in another way, not much (since pool balls, pistons, pulleys, etc. don't
travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light, people still use
Newtonian mechanics to figure out how they behave and get answers that are
good enough).

Well, Dennis, I think I understand this.  The refillable cartridges I have
seen have a sponge inside which holds the ink suspended.  The high
capacity cartridges probably use the seal vacuum to hold the ink inside.
The ink probably flows by capillary action.  Without the sponge inside,
it is possible to have a larger ink capacity.  However, that also defeats
the possibility to refill them.

Definately souunds like a software problem... does "HD" show up when
you do an "mdir". Perhaps the internal module name is something else. Also
make sure the driver name encoded in the device descriptor (/hd) is set
to "bbfhdisk", and not "bbfhdisk.dr" (do a "dump hd.dd" in the directory that
hd.dd is in and look towards the end for the bbfhdisk string)

public improvements that you will want to get that will make things much
faster, and better... Look into getting CC 2.5.2, C_Prep, Krieder CLib.l,
Mike Sweets cgfx.l, Tim Kientzle's "make", ansifront, and probably a few other
things I forgot. All of these things add much moire functionalit to the
stock compiler, as well as inproveing it's execution speed, and speed of
outputed executables...

The simplest form of comileing a program would be:
CC program.c
which would create the executable module "program" in your current execution
directory...
large, complex program often have a type of "script" file called a "makefile"
that a utility called "make" processes, and figures out exactly what needs to
be done in order to produce the final result. It then does all the work
automagically, starting up the compiler with the proper options, and whatever
else it needs to do.

Sounds good.  perhaps a bit of time could elapse after the FEST! before we
undertake this.  Then we would have a bit more to storm about.  There's a few
good eating establishments around the bend....but then, a trip to the lair
of the RS232 wizard?  Who could resist?  and what is another 39 minutes travel
time, anyway?  How many people will the apartment hold?
hehehehe   we have about 18-30 people that meet at the library.
wonder if they would all fit?     ..........nasty thought, that, eh?

87203 7-MAY 00:15  System Modules (6809)
     Merging files
     From: CHARLESAM    To: RANDYKWILSON (NR)

Randy, since os9 stores in 8k blocks, and SC (my version) is 17861 in size,
that would mean SC would occupy 23040 or 3 8k blks. Since the space is there,
could I merge a few commands in with SC and save paying rent. For that matter
would it work with other applications??? My startup file is working fine now,
but I don't have much memory left after Dynastar, Supercomm, and Presto-Partner
get theirs. I also have an empty text window besides term. Memory left is
20 blks or 160k. Sys memory is 56 pgs or 14k. Thanx Charlie
