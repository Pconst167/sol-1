Warren, is there a way to use the 2 megs on the I/O board and the 
additional 8 megs provided by the new mini-bus? 3-4 weeks?  How many 
are being made?  Why do I ask?  It will probably take 4-8 weeks to save 
up that much. %-)
 
Later...

Stephen,
      As I understand the new 8meg upgrade is versatile in that one can
use it with 2 4meg SIMMS, keep your 2 1meg SIMMS on the I/O board and 
get 11 meg total.  Or you can add 2 1meg SIMMS to the upgrade board for
a total of 5meg keeping the existing 2 1meg SIMMS on the I/O board.
      I am waiting for mine and when I get it the docs may make it 
clear on how it is all implemented.

The following is a crosspost from the cocolist.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

UUCPbb v2.1 has been uploaded to the /incoming directory on
chestnut.cs.wisc.edu.  Shortly, it will be move to its permanent directory.

Due to differences in compression between the OS-9/68K and OS-9/6809 version
of LHA, we have decided to use the lowest common denominator for archiving.
Since OS-9/6809 LHA 2.11b and OS-9/68K LHA 2.01 generate compatible archive
files, these are the archivers that were used for this package.  For this
reason, OS-9/68K should use LHA 2.01 dearchive these files.

All the archives were created with LHA 2.11b.  To burst the archives under
OS-9/6809 you will either need LHA211 or UNLZH7.  Both are available on
chestnut.cs.wisc.edu and Delphi.

UUCPbb v2.0 made its debut back in April.  This update fixes most, I hope,
of the bugs reported to me since then.  This includes the mutant RNEWS which
got itself into v2.0.  Thanks to Brad Spencer, RNEWS was completely rewritten
making it a lot faster and more reliable.  The package is now completely user
configurable.  The only hard-coded directory is /DD/SYS/UUCP.


What UUCPbb is NOT
------------------
UUCPbb allows you to run a UUCP node on your OS-9 system.  UUCPbb is NOT a
terminal program.  UUCPbb is not a BBS program; although it could be
interfaced with one.  UUCPbb will NOT connect you to the Internet.  You can
make use of some systems which are on Internet and provide access via e-mail,
but you will not be on the Internet.  So, sorry, no FTP or SLIP.  These are
not part of UUCP.  (There are FTP mailservers on the net, so you still have
indirect access to FTP sites.)


So what the heck is it?
-----------------------
UCPbb is an update of the UUCP software Rick Adams wrote a few years ago for
the Tandy Color Computer 3 running OS-9 Level 2.  It gives you a way to hook
your CoCo or OSK machine to the world UUCP network for exchanging email, news
and files.  The original software has been extensively rewritten with many
new
features added.  It was ported to OS-9/68K; although not to OS-9000--yet. ;-)
The features include:

   * Calling multiple systems from a single command line

   * Ability to process mail after each call, after all call (when calling
     more than one system), or not until a later time.

   * Retrying a call every few minutes if the initial call fails

   * Improved logging of call progress and error messages.

   * Tested with UUCPs on DEC Ultrix, Taylor (GNU), UUPC (MS-DOS), whatever
     UUNET Technologies uses, HoneyDanBer, and itself.

   * Improved mailer with lots more features.  In addition, Jeff Shepler's
     Elm-like mailer, Palm, is has been ported.

   * Software to let you read and send Usenet news.

   * Mini-listserver written and donated Rick.  (Thanks Rick!)
     Now you, too, can be a fileserver! :-)

   * Utilities to do UUCP administrative chores.


How much does it cost?
----------------------
Zilch...nada...nothing!  Thanks to Rick, UUCPbb is released as free software
under the GNU General Public License.


Where do I get it?
------------------
The official site for this and all updates will be the OS-9 archive site on
the Internet.  Right now, this chestnut.cs.wisc.edu.  It will also be posted
to Delphi, Compuserv and various landline BBS.  Official updates will always
show up on chestnut first.  It will probably be on the OS-9 mirror archive
site, wuarchive, after a short while.


What do I need?
---------------
For OS-9/6809, a 512K (128K may work but it hasn't been tested) CoCo 3
running
OS-9 Level 2, with a hard drive.  Floppies may work, but it will be painfully
slow (I know ran it on 720K *halting* floppy controller system!) a C compiler
if you will be compiling the source yourself.  Or you can get the "add water
and stir" executables.

For OSK, you need any OSK machine with either Microware's Ultra C or C
compiler ver3.2.  I received one report that GCC was also used to
successfully compile the code.

You need the following files in order to compile and run this software:

   uucpbb21.lzh         -the source code
   uub21doc.lzh         -documentation and miscellaneous files

Not required but a good idea for OS-9/6809:

   clib1990.lzh     -this is the 1990 edition of Carl Kreider's CLIB
   cc250.lzh        -latest replacement of Carl Kreider's C compiler
executive

The "add water and stir" version for either OSK or the CoCo is a second
option.  Unfortunately, these executable files are rather large.  Sorry,
there is no real way to crunch them down significantly.
The CoCo executables were compiled both with and without termcap support. 
The OSK execuatables were compiled only with termcap support.
For OSK, you need the file:

   uub21osk.lzh         -executable modules for OS-9/68K

For the CoCo, you can choose between two files:

   uub21os91.lzh        -executable modules for OS-9/6809 with a 6809
   uub21os92.lzh        -executable modules for OS-9/6809 with a 6309

If you opt for the executable files, you will also need the docs archive.
Questions, comments, suggests and bug reports can be sent by e-mail to me.
Share and enjoy!  More is on its way! ;-)

I shall get the executable and docs for the OSK version and put in my
OSK_TEL download section.

I just finished compiling the new version.  Went without a hitch except
for the end where it errored because the makefile.c32 had a missing CR
at line 258.  Fixed that by veding it and adding a \[CR) and next line a 
$(MEMOPT)3K statement which seemed to be missing.
Now that I have it working my host has crashed and can't check for mail
but I can leave mail to myself and other users in the password file.

PS the new source and docs and readme are available for download or freq 
and are in my OSK_TEL dir. Filenames are 'uucpbb21.lzh', 'uub21doc.lzh'
and 'readme.uucpbb'.
