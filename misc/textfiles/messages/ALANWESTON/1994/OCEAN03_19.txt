In a message to Alan Weston, Warren Hrach says:

Hmmm... sorry to "butt in" here, but you've certainly piqued my curiosity 
<g>!
 
Could you fill in a few details?  What type of program was this?  Was 
there a particular error reported?  I have tried to ensure that OSTerm's 
shell capability is as flexible as possible (within the 80x24 window), 
and would be glad to see if there is something that could be done to help 
interface with this program.
 
Thanks... / Ken

Good stuff. Now I dare you to try adding in support for Kermit!
 
(I can hear Ken chuckling in the background, because it isn't a trivial 
addition!)

Ken,
      The program in question is Alan Westons 'ladialer.lzh' it is an
autodialer that comes up in a 80x24 graphic window with the usual point
and click options to dial, edit, delete or add a new number. It works
fine with Sterm, and of course Kterm I have doesn't have the shell
option working yet.  I did not try it with Aterm.  My uneducated guess
is that Osterm or Tascom shell window being less than 80x24 is too
small.  Anyway Alan should be contacting you by now and between the 2 of 
you can figure it out.  I have for downloading in my OSK Tel. section.
If I can I will see if there is an error number but it all dies so fast
I dont see any.

Never mind.  Two errors: I referred to the paddleboard, though /t2 isn't 
one of those; also, a friend with an MM/1 has a trackball that nominally 
wants 12 VDC working even though his /t2 voltages measure about the same 
as mine, so it's a driver thing.
 
Duh.  It's a good thing I don't make my living doing hardware.

Hello all. I was just wondering if anyone has ported the infozip & unzip utils
to OSK (namely the MM/1) yet? Knowing me it probably came out and I missed it.
Thanks....

Tim,
    I have both zip and unzip available for osk.  Freq 'unzip.ar' and
'zip_1_0.ar' first is 28.8k and the zip is 350k. 
    The unzip.ar is in my osk_uti downloads and zip is in osk_pro
downloads.
(warren_hrach@f343.n202.z1.fidonet.org)
    PS the zip is big cause it includes C source.

Thanks, Warren.  A version popped up in the Delphi database the other day,
so I downloaded it to give it a try.  (Edition #7, CRC $90C55C).  It did
seem to work from an OSTerm shell:  at least I got a CONNECT message 
after clicking on the Ocean Beach entry.  Some parts of the display 
looked like they may have been a bit "cramped" for space in the 80x24
shell window, but it didn't appear to affect operation.  However, when
I went back to OSTerm, I wasn't getting good data.  I suspect that
LaDial is changing the baud rate, and my system is configured for
"locked baud" operation (fixed at 9600 between the modem and the 
computer).
 
Note that OSTerm 68K now uses 80x24 for its shell window.  If the version
you have has a smaller shell window, this could account for the problems. 
(Updates should be shipping RSN, we hope!  Three user-definable external 
protocols, support for multiple ports, 16-colour ANSI, fixed prompted 
ASCII file transfers, linefeed and ANSI/VT100 control character stripping 
in captured files, true line break, up to 24 digits for the autodialer 
numbers, and many other little changes.  Colin's manual has now grown to 
over 100K in size.)
 
Regards... / Ken

Ken,
     I just chatted with John Baer and he tells me his osterm has Zmodem 
and several other things I am missing, and his is a beta version whereas 
mine is Version 2.00, Alpha release 1.
