   Thanks for the info.  I'll have to start asking around to see
what's out there now that will work with the MM/1...
The CM-8 I have won't last forever <g>.

   That $125 is a good price for the spect's you gave out.
Good catch.. and enjoy.

John, you can pick up a NEW Commodore 1084S (made by Magnavox for Commodore-
basically a 1CM135 with the addition of separated as well as standard combined
composite inputs) for $199.95 from Tri-State Computer (NY) 1-800-433-5199.
These are made for the Amiga and have twin speakers (not amplified). I use one
with my CoCo 3 . Has analog and digital (IBM/CGA) inputs also.

  I'm using a set of KOSS Hard Drivers with my MM/1 and Magnavox515. They are
made for computer use. (I had to change the mini-plug to connect to the MM/1
and to hookup the sound from my CDrom unit) They cost about $25 at my local
Target store and work well (and the color matches the rest of the equipment).

   Are you coming to the 'fest?? I'm always at the 'Chicago' 'fest 'cause
I can see the hotel from here!

I'm using a Mitsubishi Daimond Scan AUm-1391A with mine.  Another "no longer

years ago from a liquidator.  Someone was collecting this info but I guess

Hey Chris,

Thanks for the info on the speakers.  Thanks to Bill Clinton I don't have
extra money to invest in a sound mixer/speakers now since it's tax time, but
I'll keep them in mind.

You bet, I'll be at the fest.  Wouldn't miss it!

True.  When I went back to visit my folks and fired up the CoCo,
I couldn't believe what I saw...the CM-8 was *so dim* compared
with the Magnavox monitor I use--heck, compared with what I remember
the CM-8 being like!--that I couldn't believe it.

When I look at monitors, I see them list the *maximum* scan rate they
can handle, but I don't see a minimum listed.  Is there a minimum, or
can any of them handle 15.whatever KHz?

most new monitors will NOT "multisync" down to 15.?? KHz... I just went through
this delemawhen looking for a monitor that I could both use on my MM/1 AND
my Sun... (I was looking at 17" - 21" size range) I eventually gave up, and
just got one that would work on the Sun, and down to 30.?? KHz... The Sun
sncs at like 66 KHz...  it was tough  to find a "reasonable" priced
monitor that would go that high even... The monitor I eventually
got is from Dell.. and is just barely adiquite... its pitcure quality isn't
the greatest.. but is useable (it ia also only 17" and I was hopeing for
19") it's not useable on the MM/1.. but, it will at least be usable on
a DOS box is I ever get one to run OS-9000 on.

I suspect that it is gonna be very hard to find monitors that sync down
to coco/mm/1 rates in the near future... especially NEW ones, thaqt will also
work on VGA/SVGA systems...

Funny you should ask that question!

Yes, you can sort of "hide" all the the mail files, the MAIL.MAI file and
all of the MAIL$xxxxxxxx.MAI files. At the "MAIL>" prompt you can enter:

MAIL> set mail_directory [.MAIL]

This command will move all files associated with VAX EMail into a
subdirectory called [.MAIL]. You can use any name you wish.

I have FIVE drives connected to my DECB (Ext. ADOS 3) system. You figure it out!



Nah, I won't do that to ya! I have three PHYSICAL drives. Two are 40 track
double sided units configured as 0,1,2,3. The third is a 720K NOT USED under
ADOS, just OS-9. I pulled the drive 2 select line from the cable and put
a toggle switch in it, effectively switching it "off" when using DECB. I was
a little surprised to note that ADOS used the drive 2 and 3 select lines
when configured for double sided operation! Without the switch, when I
accessed the back of drive 0 (drive 2) under ADOS3, the physical drive 2 would
activate also, even though drive 0 and the side select pins are the ones that
are actually being used, NOT the physical drive 2!

Hi all,
     After a thread in forum about monitors for the MM/1, I remember someone
who was collecting this info but I don't remember them posting anything.  IF
they didn't, I will.  So if you have an MM/1(a) let me know what you are
using as a monitor.  I'll collect the info and post the list for those who
are tired of the CM-8 or Maggies on they MM/1's.

If anyone in the NJ area is going to the Trenton ComputerFest on the 16th and
17th, let me know.  I am going to try to be there both days.  Maybe we all
can meet in person.  I also know the infamous Bob Billson (UUCPBB for the CoCo)
will be there on Sunday.  You might be able to bump into him.  (I know he'll
love me for this <g>)  IF you are a ham, we'll be listening on 146.52.  If not,
look for a fat guy (that's me) with an HT.  This fest is the biggest in NJ and
I've been trying to get Bob and some of his friends to get a seminar on OS9
going during the fest.  Geez, they even have one on CPM, why not OS9.  Anyway,
it is at Mercer County College outside of Trenton.  They park you in Mercer
County Park since there is no room for all the peopl on campus.  You get
bussed from the park to the campus.  I'm not a member of any club or
organization running this but it is a good one.  Where can you get an OSK
machine for $50?  (OK, an old one but still.....)  Like to see OS9/OSK people
there since we don't have any OS9 fests in this area of the country.

     From: TIMKIENTZLE  To: LARRYOLSON (NR)

Part of your problem is that IFF _by_itself_ doesn't describe how
to store pictures or sound or anything else.  IFF is just a way
of keeping a bunch of data in a single file.  That data can
be pictures or sounds or nearly anything else.  In addition to
knowing IFF format, to find the pieces and extract them, you must
also know how to decipher the pieces.

    I have a document here which calls itself "EA IFF 85".
The EA stands for Electronic Arts, the company which originally
developed the IFF format.  IFF stands for "Interchange File Format",
and the 85 is the year in which this specification was released.
The most common format for graphics stored within an IFF file
is the ILBM format (?) (InterLeaved Bit Map).  Other data formats
that can be stored within an IFF file include: 8SVX (8-bit sound),
ANBM (animated bitmap), FNTR (raster font), FNTV (vector font),
TEXT, FTXT (formatted text), and many others.

    The best way to find out details of this format is probably
to contact Electronic Arts and ask them for copies of the
specifications.  They'll probably send them to you for a modest
fee.  Ask around Amiga folks if you need an address for EA.
They've published a lot of Ami stuff.

    If you look in the "help system for OS9" that I uploaded about
two or three years ago, one of those archives includes a bunch
of documents explaining graphics formats.  Probably, this IFF
document is in there.  If not, bug me until I upload it.

     RE: protocol (Re: Msg 85291)
     From: TIMKIENTZLE  To: BKITT (NR)

Of the protocols you mentioned, only one has a good published
description: Kermit is described quite thoroughly in a book
by Frank de Cruz, the inventor of Kermit.  It's a good book and
highly recommended.

For ZModem, I've seen one book that discusses it.  That's
Mark Nelson's "Serial Communications: A C++ Developer's Guide".
It contains a subset of the description given in Chuck Forsberg's
electronic document "The ZModem Inter-Application File Transfer
Protocol".  Nelson's book also contains essentially a copy of
the rz/sz source.  You mentioned that "ZModem standards are
evolving".  That's not quite correct.  "ZModem" is a fixed protocol,
defined by the combination of Chuck Forsberg's document and the
rz/sz source code, versions 1.xx.  Later versions of rz/sz implement
a "ZModem extension" which is PROPRIETARY.  Versions of rz/sz
later than 1.xx are NOT public domain.  No online services that
I know of implement anything other than the basic ZModem protocol.

ZModem is very different than XModem/YModem.  Feel free to ask
if you need any pointers in understanding it.
                    - Tim Kientzle

P.S.  If you find a place that has Forsberg's other documents on
YModem, etc, I'd be interested in knowing.  I have a couple of
his documents, but there are quite a few that I'm missing.
Unfortunately, I'm not sure I have any of them in electronic
form; I seem to have printed them out and then deleted them.

I'd be interested to know how GCC compares to those figures.
When Ultra-C first came out, I recall some figures that were posted
to Usenet showing that Ultra-C code was significantly poorer
in both speed and size than GCC code, and was occasionally
worse than C 3.2!  Hope that situation has improved.
   I'm also curious to know if Ultra-C is less buggy now.
