Car trouble??? MY car is in pieces waiting to be put back together at the
shop.... broke a ring (compression) and had one hell of a time finding another!
Couldn't get it before the fest so I rented a car to drive the 2000 mile
round trip in. Only $200!! But I got there! Now I just found and ordered the
ring.... should be back in the seat of the Rambler in another week or so,
unleeI find SOMETHING ELSE that needs to be fixed while the motor is opened up
again!!
The probelm that lead to this is a long story.... will leave that out!!

Of all palces, AVIS was the cheapest! They charged me $186 for a Chevy Cavalier
2 door for a week with unlimited miles. I told them I'd be bringing it back a
day or two early, but with 2000 miles on it! I figure it actually only cost
me about $140-$146.... the Rambler would have probably used that much more gas!!

Don't listen to those guys with names like "Budget" and "Economy"..... I don't
know WHERE they got their names from! The closest was about $240 from one of
those
for nearly the same car... or smaller!!!

I am not surprised with Avis. Think also Hertz has something also. Budget

either driving, taking the train, or mabey take a week's vacation for the

Mike -

The Unix utility 'screen' has been ported over to OSK, and allows
use of many virtual terminal sessions, in full-screen mode (for termcap
and terminfo-based applications).  I believe there is a version here in
the database, but recent versions of SCF limit it to only 2 or maybe 3
sessions.  Bob van der Poel has posted a couple of updated versions
(latest update a week or so ago) over on CIS that fixes this problem.

I also use 'screen' on my HP-UX account when dialed into the office, so that
I can switch between several different sessions.

However, performing this screen switching is a bit more complicated than
just maintaining an array containing a virtual screen.  The utility must
interpret all of the appropriate (termcap) control codes for cursor
positioning, character attributes, etc.  (Essentially, it needs to
emulate the native display characteristics, capturing this information,
and "re-playing" it whenever a specific screen is selected.)

Hi, Mike -

I don't believe that any of the currently available Level 2 editors allow
you to load more than about 53K into the buffer at a time, although I did
hear of one (private/undistributed) that used VRN to allow this.  There
is a viewer ("vu" or "view"???) that will allow browsing of large files.

To handle large files, you will either have to have to use a file
splitting utility, or else use an editor (such as DynaStar) that loads
a portion of the file at a time into the edit buffer, then lets you
write that section back to disk and load in the next section.  Works
OK (I used DynaStar for many years under L2), though you cannot go
backwards to edit previous sections without writing everything back out
to disk, and opening the file again at the beginning.

   Yep!  The CoCo 3 version I last used gave you 55/56K..

And Bob included his Vsplit program that let you break up a text
file in either number of parts, or number of `K' you wanted.
I use to use 30K.. a good round number.

RE: too big text files...

Ved has the utility "vsplit"(?) which will automatically break the file
down into smaller fragments.  It is a little trouble, but it will work.

Microware's "scred" will handle the entire file, reading in whatever mem.
will hold (about 36k max), don't hit me Bob VDP :-).  Also "edit" which
comes with the system will, but edit is awful to work with.

You are looking at the actual - shall I say "extended" - memory available
to the system.  That is memory left free for additional use.  However, as
has been said before, a process can only utilize 64k for itself, that is
the program AND all data(variables) it uses.  Of course you can "cheat" and
get more, actually what you are doing is "peeking" into another process's
address space.

Yeah, but when I call him, he always refers me to Ed. Hathaway. And Ed is
very fussy about what time of the day/nite you try to call him, and while
denying it, is doing his darndest to convince me I'll never see the upgraded

This is because Ed works from about 11PM every weekday evening until about
10AM (or sometimes later, in the morning. If I worked those hours, I'd

Too bad. If it were the MM/1 version, I'd simple mail you the upgrade myself.
I do not own the commercial version for the COCO.

I cannot speak for Ed as to why he has been lax in filling your order, but
I can say I have known Ed personally for 4 years and everything dealing I
have had with him was extremely pleasent. I even spent several hours in his
van with him and Paul Ward two years ago sharing a ride to the Chicago
fest. While some of our ideological ideas differ, he was quite a pleasent

I agree, Zack. The conversations I've had have all been pleasant. It's just
that I'd like to get the program/upgrade before I shut the CoCo down forever.
Which, while I hate to say it, may eventually happen. At the instant, I'm doing
this on an Amiga 2000-020. The reason I'm hesitant about shutting the OS-9
machine off for good is that I know enough about OS-9 to make it do anything
the hardware is capable of.  Unfortch, so far the ability to record from a
midi source seems to have eluded the 6809 world, while virtually ANY music
program for the Amiga can record a midi performance direct to the hard drive
in real time. I intend to transfer the music I do have on the CoCo over to
the Amiga by simply running the midi output of the coco over to the Amiga,
just as if it was a null modem cable.  The main prob;lem is the relative
cost of the programs, DMusic is in the $80 area, makes very nice screens
BUT can't stay up with the music in its on-screen display. Maybe with a
25-33 mhz 040 cpu, but not with this 14 mhs 020. Bars & Pipes does the
screen in a different format that non-music-reading types seem to find
works ok. Either one can turn your music into some awful nice printed copy.
ALL THE cabling to do that is an adaptor for the seriel port thats usually
someplace in the $40-$80 area depending on what other bells and whistles
you might want, one of the $65 ones even having an 8 bit digitizer built
right into it! Now admittedly you wouldn't want to listen to that 8 bit
sound on your $2500 audio in the living room, but for previews on a pair
of 3" boxes sitting beside your trusty 8515, its pretty good. Whew!

  Seeing the "quote" Commadore or Amiga Monitors,, I'm nearly shure
 they are Mag monitors.  Donno if the pin configuratiion is the same for
 sure,, but The Amiga plugfgs right into a Mag 515.   So it could be.
  Having An Amiga,, I use theh Mag monitor.  and wouldn't have a
 Commafore,, I think thye call it a 1040 GS.  The Mag has more

  The newer 135's that replaced theh 515's have stereo or two speaker
 s  and sound inputs.  But then I wouldn't recommend a monitor speaker
 foro quality sound anyway.
  If you see a 515,, new?  It's gotta be a rebulit, returned item.  They

     "I recently heard that Commodore Monitors work on the coco,
      that they're actually magnavox 515s."

One or more versions of the Commodore 1084/1084s were essentially
rebadged Magnavox 8CM515's, but ADDED the chroma/luma inputs the
8CM515 lacked. However, Magnavox's own 1CM135 had everything the
version of the 1084s that mirrored it had (including the stereo sound
support and chroma/luma jack).

Older Commodore monitors, such as the 2002 and the 1080 (like the two
I have) have no resemblance to any Magnavox monitor I have ever seen.
I know for a fact that my 1080 was not manufactured by Magnavox, nor its
parent company, Philips, as the label on the back says so. <grin>

Seriously, Shinjyo General Company, Inc. of Japan was the manufacturer
of my 1080's (and likely all 1080's).

Actually, if you compare the first 1084 to it's Magnavox contemporary,
the 8CM515, you will find that 1084 has more jacks...specifically,
the one that allows split chroma/luma input. The 1CM135 has this,
but the 8CM515 only supported RGB (digital and analog) and composite.

The same is true if you compare a Commodore 1902A to the Magnavox
8CM562. (I think I got the numbers right).

Essentially, the 1CM135 was the first Magnavox monitor to support
split chroma/luma (S-video) inputs, while all the 15.75Khz-only color
Commodore monitors had it. (Commodore has also sold a few multi-syncs
and mono monitors, so I had to be specific).

Not so on the Amiga monitor Terry! I have a 1084 (the 1040 you referred to was
the ultra low cost job, sort of like a CM-8) that I've used for years now. It
is IDENTICAL to the 8CM515 except that an additional jack and switch is on the
back to allow using
spilt composite input (ala c-64/128) as wall as standard composite. The 1084S
(what I have) is stereo in that it has dual speakers and input javks for them,

The Amiga model number is 1084 or 1084S. The S is for stereo.. it has two

I thot I'd jump in here re the commie monitor discussion. I do in fact
have the service man for the 1084s thats being talked about, it is in fact
made by NAP (Maggie), and major parts of the pcb are identical to the older
Maggie 8CM515 we've all used for years on our coco's. I am in fact running
the 8CM515 here on the coco, and on the next desk to the left on a commie
2000-020. Other than the flicker if you run it interlaced on the commie,
its a great monitor. This service man is now 5 years old, so commie may
have changed suppliers at some point, but all of the 1084S's we have at
the tv station are Maggies. Other than an occasional cold solder joint
where the inputyt jack tugs on the edge of the pcb, we have had zip probs
with them.  My CoCo's 515 is now 8 years old, the commies 515 probably
9 or 10 as its in fact Dennie Skala's old monitor! The 1CM135 is the next
unit newer in that same series, and so far as I know, funcionally identical.

Heh.. I was helping a friend install nitro this weekend, and
ran into almost the exact same thing... a problem with grfdrv... my solution
was to grab the stock OS-9 Level 2 Boot disks, boot up with them, then
load thard disk driver/descriptor off the distribution disk that
they cam on ( Burk and burk setup, had to also make the descriptor
with the "ddmaker" program" then I just iniz /h0; chd /h0; chx /h0/cmds...
and then fixed what I messed up... My friend through we were REALLY screwed.
Only took about 5 minutes to "recover" to a usable state. I ran outa time,`
so didn't get to finishing the nitro installation... One thing I
got to say for nitro... it is not the easiest thing to install.
and is perhaps the most confusing thing I ever worked with... Especially
cause the install program options don't do exactly what they say. It also
is REALLY picky on what the modules are that it is going to patch.

It also made a great monitor for the Atari STe series, since they
added stereo sound. In fact, Atari sold a 'stripped down' version of
the Magnavox 1CM135 under the Atari name as the SC1435. (Unlike the
Commodore version, it was inferior to the 1CM135, in that it lacked
both the composite and split video inputs, and AFAIK, did not handle
RGBI, either...just RGB analog).

If you have a hard time with it, imagine what I'm going thru. I must have
made 20 or more bootdisks and still no luck. I got back to my HD the hard
way by making a new bootdisk that load grfdrv from /d0. I'll keep a couple of
copies
handy for future blunders. I'm starting to believe its a joke. 'Nitros9 I
mean. I have all my modules patched that can be patched and still fail.
I took out os9p3 cause I couldn't find a patch. I did notice that since
grfdrv was patched, my Klondike has noticably increase speed in which it
puts up a new screen, like BAM! There it is. If the rest of the stuff
works like that, it might well be worth the effort I'm investing. Its
just that I'm starting to feel I'll never get it right, never get it to
boot. Frustration, plain and simple. I'm sitting here with reams of
printouts, dozens of disks, most unlabeled, and I don't have any idea
where to go from here. I think I'll clean up the mess and put it aside

I can understand the difficulties you are haveing.  I went
through the same thing when I was trying to patch OS9 with just the
normal patches (via the patch OS9 disk).  After that lesson, when I
got NitrOS9 I got myself organized before I tried anything.
ie. Created a boot disk with hard drive descriptors but with the floppy as
 dd
   /dd
I also formatted  bunch of disks to plenty of blanks ready to go, and I also
found a fantastic time/frustration saver, a product called ErasaLabel.  I has
It is a special label and pen that erase with alchohol.  VERY Handy!
  Anyway, it is frustrating but in the end it WILL be worth it.  Nitro is
faster and smootherthan stock os9 and you will end up
wondering how you got along without it!

You first step is to verify that hardware handshakeing is taking place. Get

I don't have a line status indicator, if they are cheap (Radio Shack?)
then I may pick one up.  In the meantime assuming that handshaking is
taking place then what?

By the way I have tried downloading to a ramdisk too, but ymodem at
9600 yeilds about 450 or less cps.

Is PROTOCOL:LAPM (V-42 LAP-M Error Correction) the same as handshaking?
Usually my modem responds with this message.

Jim,

I thought I would jump in here because I want to learn all I can to facilitate
my own move to a higher speed modem when it comes.  "Handshaking" is the term
used for the exchange of signals which takes place during a transmission
between two modems.  You can monitor this process by purchasing an RS-232
"mini-tester" from Radio Shack for only a few bucks (I am sure mine was less
than $5).  The "mini-tester" plugs in to your RS-232 output plug on one end
and to your RS-232 output cable on the other end.  It has 7 indicator lights
for TD - transmit data, RD - receive data, RTS - ready to send, CTS - clear
to send, DSR - Data set ready, DTR - data terminal ready and CD - carrier
detect.  By watching what happens during transmission, you can monitor
when the signals are being sent to and from your modem.

Error checking protocols are methods of checking the data stream for various
patterns to detect or correct errors caused by line noise or interference.

The RS-232 signals must be sent in the correct sequence so that both modems
will continue to transmit and receive "in sync" with each other.  On the
other hand there are several error checking and correction protocols, so
you must know which are compatible with your system and the host system
to which you are calling.

I hope that this has not confused you more, but I am sure that our colleagues
here will add to the discussion and that we will both learn more.<grin>

Assumeing you are getting soe kind of RTS/CTS handshakeing, and the CoCo
is indeed getting the signals. Then, you might have to fine tune some of
the "S" register settings that deal with intewrnal buffers and transition times
in the modem.
Get the tester first, they are cheep, definately under 10$, and help solve
many problems (I just had to use mine to figure out why my MAI terminal
was not handshakeing properly... Seems it likes to use DTR instead of RTS
to signal that t is bust, and to not send anything to it)

Also, don't expect to get massivly high throughput rates until you are
running in 6309 mode. What you want to acheive first are error free receives.
Then you might want to do some hacks to fix the CTS problem so you
can get error free transmissions.

Another side note... Saw a CoCo connected at 38.4K baud to my Unix box
at the fest and have no problem handleing a zmodem receive (only got 984 CPS)
but, it didn't loose any characters or interupts, and we even loaded the
coco with a few other tings to do...this was using a serail port
with a 16550 UART. It was in Mark Marlette's (?SP) machine (Quite an
impessive machine!)

How can the average CoCo user get one of these 16550 ports?  There's
several of us that wonts one!

WELP... I'm not sure if the serial port board he had was of his own design,
or, if it was a redesigned version of a prototype CoCoIO board
( it actually had 2 16550's on it) He also had his own home

Just letting you know that I have the same modem though it is hooked to
my MM1. I have not yet achieved any 9600 baud delphi connections but havent
tried real hard yet. Initially I was getting 9600 CONNECT on my screen,
then garbage echoing, and then nada. I will be piddling with this over

Have you been able to call out to local PC boards at 9600 or 14.4?

Unless the port is real bad there is no reason a 68K based system
can't do high speed connects.  What is your modem settings?  Do a
AT&V to list them to your terminal.  From I hear both S-term and
TasCom (OSterm) should work fine.

Which S register settings in particular?  I've scanned my modem's manual
and didn't see any that I think could be changed that would help except
for maybe S26?

I got one of the testers yesterday, Radio Shack must have risen there
prices there are no $15 not under $10.  It is a neat little toy.  It
seems that RTS/CTS handshaking is working properly.  I noticed that
the RTS light goes red only during streaming protocols such as
zmodem.  I guess the ymodem protocol itself handles the flow control.

It will be a while before I can get a 6309 installed, not anytime soon.

I would like to hear from other people who have claimed to have gotten
reliable communication at 9600 baud from the CoCo without the 6309.

I still say that it doesn't look it the CoCo can do it.  Please
someone show me that I am wrong by telling me how MY CoCo can do it.

The coco can indead do it running in 6809 mode... I've done it myself when
SandV was running on a CoCo. That was a long time ago though. The reason that
YModem and Xmodem seem they don't require the RTS/CTS handshakeing is that
because they are blocked protocals, the receive buffer is must likely
large enough (in SAcia) to hold an entire 1K packet, so the system never
gets to the point that it needs to halt the transmitter.  I can't recall your
original setup, but, do make sure you have the new Edition 9 clock installed
with SAcia...

Try playing with the S49  (ASB Buffer size lower limit) and S50 (ASB
buffer size upper limit)

I Take it you are using /T3 or /T4? If not, that is most likely your
problem... Also, check the jumpers on the paddle board. On the P4 jumper
block, you should have it jumpered as follows:
:|:| P4
(where '|' is a jumper, and yopu are looking at the board from the front)
Also, make sure you are the TYPE set to 80, or have RTS/CTS flow control
enabled from the term program (if it provoids that option)

I'll relate some of my experiences, don't take word for gospel, as I didn't
do some of the tweaking Paul spoke of.  My setup:  Coco 3, 6309 w/Powerboost,
MPI w/ Tandy RS-232 Pak - it has 6551 ACIA, not 6551A, have one but didn't
install it.  I have an edition 9 (?) clock - thought it was supposed to be
edition 7.  It's for Disto clock, anyway.  My modem is Hayes Optima 2400.
I have my /t2 "xtp" set to 5 "par"= 2.

I have supercomm 2.2, also OSTerm.  In logging on to local BBS w/40 MHZ PC,
I would lose some characters especially when a big bunch of stuff came in to
display.  On a ZModem d/l, I would get a few errors (that's with error-
correction turned on in modem).  I think on one file about 100K, I got 3 or
4 errors.   This was all at 9600, and the 6551 might be too weak for this
rate.  I began logging on @ 4800 and it's beautiful.

I notice with error-corr & h/w handshake on, my "rd" light blinks rapidly
with CIS & Delphi.  On the local BBS, the light blinks at oh, maybe 1/2 that
rate.  However, the BBS has compression turned on, with CIS & Delphi comp.
is off, but err-corr is on.

This is only my experience.  I wonder, speaking to Paul, are your successful
9600 connections with another coco?  I can see where a CoCo-CoCo connection
would be quite successful, since I would think neither would be supplying
the data faster than the other could receive.  But can a Coco keep up with
a much faster computer at 9600?  I'm thinking that by the time the coco
detects a buffer-almost-full condition and shuts flow off, that the buffer
might be overflowed?  Could this be?

My experiances were between a CoCo, and a 486/33 Unix box. Also, I was using
a true 9600 baud modem (ie, v.32), but, that is besides the point. One of the
newer version of SAcia may be needed to get the reliability I had. I can't
really give too much more help, cause, I no longer have a CoCo, and it has

OK, that answers my question.  I didn't pursue the project all that far.  I
did have SAcia.  My modem was a 2400 Hayes using v.42bis.  I think maybe the
screen output was overtaxing my system or something - well I did get errors
on zmodem downloading so I dunno.  I had everything I was told I needed -
except didn't do the DSR/? switching (think it was DSR) that was recommended
(believe this was developed by you, wasn't it?).

Well, I suppose it's a moot question for me, too <G>.  Just received my
System 5 Fri the 28th.  Soon as I get my serial ports rewired for straight
RS-232, (or get the internal modem), I'll probably be using the OSK sys
for all telecom.

I have read the patch doc file, but can't use it since I can't modify
my cable, hopeuflly my friend Tim will help set up a modified cable
for us to test.

I uploaded a fire for the first time at 4800 baud got a blazing 315 CPS
using the latest SZ!  Why so slow, moving the file to ramdisk did
not help much, so it's not the hard drive slowing down the tranfer.
Unlike Zmodem receive at 4800 baud (which yields about 400 CPS) I noticed
that the SD light on my modem was not on constrantly using zmodem.  Ymodem
batch yeilded closer to the expected 400+ CPS.... why is zmodem so slow?

I would like the users on my board to be able to download using SZ but
I can't recomend a 300 CPS transfer rate... that is way too slow.

Any sugestions... if any CoCo user gets better result WITHOUT a 6309
could you please send me a copy of your os9boot file, and a copy of
your modem settings?

NO sound and when I finsih off the bad guys, the screen explodes. If I
do a MAP command, I get the map and when I exit MAP the trek screen comes
back.
  If I turn off sound, the the game plays correctly.

  Can anybody tell me what is wrong???????

On a hunch, I called Colin McKay, who picked up Trek at the Fest, and
asked him to try it after configuring to use "sh" (the TOP "Bourne shell"
mini-clone).  He encountered exactly the same SYNTAX ERROR reported by
John when using this configuration.  Normally (using the stock MW shell),
Colin reports having no problems with the game, but says he has some
suggestions/ideas that he plans to forward to Budgetware.

Hi, John -

Nice meeting you at the Fest!  Good to now have a face to match to the

Please see my message to Mark on the Trek sound problem:  are you using
"sh" for your shell?  This could be causing the errors you have been

        Hehe, good point :-) This is also a good example of how a single

   "gee, I'd like to maybe contact the author about getting the rights to
   the software, but hey, if he was going to do it, wouldn't  someone
   have already gotten the rights by now?" when in fact the reason no one
   has the rights to the software is because, NO ONE bothered to

   good example for the rest of the community, for not only getting the
   rights to do software ports and/or updates, but in other areas such as
   promoting the system itself. Btw, since I mentioned all that old Coco
   software from the old classic Rainbow days, imagine if we were able to
   get a majority of that software ported to OS9, and updated, and if it
   is OS9 software already, simply getting the rights and updating it? I
   don't know if Level II  sales would pick up considerably or not, but
   if it was ported to OSK, in the long run it would be a BIG plus. Since
   the NEW OSK/ K-Gwindows software is still being written, having
   reworked old Coco software would help fill some voids with POSSIBLY
   less work. I say possibly, because in some cases having to redo all

Hi, Chris -

Well, aside from Brother Jeremy's Max10 endeavors, there have been other
successful efforts to maintain/upgrade some of the better programs.

  - Mike Sweet's "Terminal" for the MM/1 has been licenced by Blackhawk
    Industries, and is being upgraded by John Donaldson
  - Dave Philipsen's "SuperComm" for CC3 Level 2 is now being supported
    by Randy K Wilson
  - Vaughn Cato's "TasCOM" for the MM/1 has been upgraded and has been
    re-released as "OSTerm 68K" from Northern Xposure (a project with
    which I have been involved).

I agree that it's a shame if the authors just let their code stagnate
if there are people willing to take over the reins and keep it alive.

However, I can certainly understand if the original authors are hesitant
to release their code:  they would be concerned that their reputations may
be tarnished if the new maintainer of the code does a poor job on a
product that has not only been associated with their name, but has been
the result of many, many hours of painstaking effort.  From what I have seen,
John and Randy have both done a good job of maintaining the quality of
the original programs (and I have been trying very hard to ensure that the
same can be said of OSTerm 68K).

But I think that this discussion should not just be limited to existing OS-9
programs:  there are a large number of non-OS-9 programs waiting to be
ported over to our environment.  When I asked Geoff Kuenning for permission
to post my OSK port of "ispell", he was very co-operative.  There are a lot
of other programs out there that could be supported under OS-9, if someone
would take the initiative to make it happen.

Cheers... / Ken

 Well I can only agree with your points. I don't want to take away from
 those programs that are being ported and updated, since we are lucky  to
 have them, but still they are so far a drop in the bucket as far as the
 quantity of other such programs out there are concerned. We could sure use
 a lot more of them. Also like you said, we shouldn't limit such projects to
 the OS-9 software. I was mentioning this to someone in conference the other
 night. I'm sure if we had people familiar with software from other platforms,
 including Atari and Amiga computers, negtotiating with the authors, we
 could gain several benefits, including possibly turning users of those systems
 on to OS-9 when they see their favorite programs.
  It is true that software authors have legitimate reasons for not wanting to
 release code, but those who are familiar with the OS-9 community should know
 there is not much to worry about. If Advertisements and documentation
 pointed out that the original author was not involved with the program
 from let's say Version 1.0 on up or whatever, it would probably clear a lot
 of things up. If it was me personally, I wouldn't have any fears. Like you
said Randy and all the others have done the software justice
 and from what I've heard from those who attended the fest, you won't
 have any need to worry about the future reputation of OSterm :-)

  I'm not saying this will be easy, as I'm sure it won't, but once the
 resources and volunteers are available, it will make for a very good
 OS-9 User Group project.

 See Ya

The Puppo simply connects to the keyboard connector, and you need
to also supply +5 and a Ground lead to it... The other lead goes to the
reset circuitry. To one end of a diode near the PAK connector. It is onlt
necessary if you want CRTL_ALT_DELETE reset capability.

     Help ID-ing Sony Microphones
     From: MARTYGOODMAN To: ALL

I recently acquired (for $15 total, on a whim) two Sony brand
microphones.

   One is a Sony ECM-18 older, electret condenser mike, which came
with a bizarre home-brew anti-vibration desk mount consisting of
a tetrahedron of soldered heavy copper wire and a weird spiderweb
of ribber band material supporting the microphone.

   The other is a rather new-appearing Sony F-98 "low impedance"
cartioid microphone.  It appears to be a dynamic type microphone.

    I got these at a local surplus outlet.   Can you tell me
anything about the quality or specs on these microphones?

   The ECM-18 has a balanced mike cord connector in it, the
F-98 as an integral unbalance cord with 1/4 in phono plug at the end.

   Any help in understanding what this mics are and where to best
employ them would be appreciated.

Depends on what you want to do in the Internet. If all you are going to be
doing is FTP, then you do not need a VT100 emulator. The problem comes in
if you want to TELNET out to another computer.

Another program that is in the databases (I think) is called vt100, it
not only emulates vt100 but vt220 and others.  It is not a smart term
like kbcom is, no extras, but it is small and can be ran at the same
time as Supercomm.

The ANSI option in Supercomm is only a subset of VT100.  It works for
some internet systems but not all.  IRC does not work at all, neithor
does the Talk command (on Infonet).

For those systems that don't work with Supercomm I use VT100 at the
same time as running SC, or I run KBCom if I need to capture VT100
sessions (such as chats).

     RE: MECI #86 catolog (Re: Msg 87624)
     From: MARTYGOODMAN To: DONALDS

I've used Sony TV's with the CoCo 3 RGB analog output in the past.
These were the KV1311CR and KV2011CR, which were both predecessors
of Sony's XBR series... top of the line home TVs at the time.
Those had a 34 pin RGB video connector that had all sorts of
weird stuff on it (audio, audio signal control lines, RGB / video
switching control lines) as well as RGB analog inputs.

   The WORD "RGB" is not enough to tell you if that monitor
supports the RGB of the CoCo 3.  In this case, while we can be
pretty certain the monitor supports 15.75 KHz sync rate, what
we DON'T know is whether the "RGB" involves is analog or some sort
of digital RGB (such as CGA).   If you can determine that the "RGB"
in question IS analog RGB, THEN I'd be virtually certain that you
CAN use the monitor to good effect with the CoCo 3.

   You may have to make a custom cable for it, and may even have
to mess with the sync lines, to get things to work... but that's
VERY easy to do.  I can help there, if you are not up to the task.
For the Sony KV series I made hundreds of custom cables for
individuals and dealers.   Those cables required sync fixing...
I used a TTL logic chip (74LS02) to combine the CoCo's positive H
and V syncs into a single negative combined sync line, for the Sonys
wanted negative combined sync information, not separate postive sync.
The circuit is trivial... just run H and V sync into the two inputs
of one of the four NOR gates on the 74LS02... and use the OUTPUT
of that gate as combined negative sync!


 Hope this reply helps... let me know if you get more info on that monitor.

The vendor that sold it to me is suppose to forward the docs. I guess I'll
wait till then. BTW, I'm using a Tandy enhanced keyboard. Its suppose to
emulate the keyboard this puppo unit is designed for. What is the name of
that keyboard? Just in case I have to get one should this one be dead.
Again thanx, Charlie

Just thought I'd mention that the Sept '93 issue of '68 Micros had an
article on the Puppo keyboard.  If you don't subscribe, check with DSRTFOX,
I'm sure he could ship you a copy. It might help you.

  Just to put in my 2 cents worth. As I recall the puppo needs more than
+5 volts. That's why the regulator and heat sink. I was designed to pull
power from the +9 or so instead of the already well loaded +5 line. The docs
say to connect it to the cathode (banded end) of diode D1. The boys show
up if the interface is not getting power. Also I have an old Eagle keyboard
that came with it originally, but, switched the puppo rom to one that works
with a standard keyboard. The control keys are different.

Thanx Chris, I thought thats where it was when they hooked it up in Chicago.
Problem is that even when I hook it up there, I still get the THREE. Maybe
the keyboard went but I'm inclined to think its a problem with the puppo.
Could you give me an idea which chip could go cause the appearance of
the THREE. I can't get them off. Charlie

   Don't have a clue (the puppo is one of the few things I havn't messed
with). The thing I remembered is that when I forget to hook up the power
clip and then put the AT case back together and pwered-up, all I got was
The THREE MUGateers! Are you sure you have a good ground?? That will cause
no power (and the three) as well.

     Cumana/OSK for Atari-ST: working, but st
     From: PAULSENIURA  To: ALL



Hello people, got some good news.  I can actually use Cumana/OSK v2.3
for Atari-ST on my ICD hard drives now!  Even boot up from it!

But... y'all might remember how Seagate put some kind of "feature"
into their SCSI drives (the older ones at least):  If ya don't access
the drive after a while, it'll "go to sleep".  Do any of y'all
remember how to deal with this "feature"?  It's actually causing OSK
to freeze-up when I try to access the drive after it's done that...
and I hafta reboot it all up again just so to reset it.

I've zapped the word at offset $8DC in the STHD driver from $0080 to
$2080 -- that has seemed to fix my original "Not Ready" errors just
fine.  (FYI:  My STHD is Size=$A9C, Edition=$1F, Revision=$00,
original CRC=$C45E91.)  My ST has FasTech's Turbo16 CPU upgrade in it
(16MHz with instruction cache that can't be turned off).  Should I
make this "delay value" even larger?

I've already patched the device descriptors to have a huge PD_Trys
value (offset $60 in the descriptor = "number of times a device will
try to access a disk before returning an error").  Setting this to a
$01 says only One Try and No Retries.  Setting this to $00 is saying
to use whatever the Driver (STHD) wants to do as a Default (even if it
doesn't want to).  Also "any other value" says to use this Default.
(Cumana sent me a OSK Tech Manual for v2.1 and not for v2.3, darn it,
so that's all I know what to try next.)

Right now all my /Hx & /DD things have PD_Trys set to $77 just in case
the driver I got will "honor" this many retries.  But it isn't...
After not exercizing the drive for a while, then accessing it, I'm
still getting Error #000:246 (Not Ready).  If I access it again right
after that error, the system stays locked up (while the STCON cursor
continues to flash!), and the drive's LED stays lit solid 'til I
reboot (powering off/on the drive [only] doesn't help either).  I.e. a
Ctrl+C can't get me out of a 'DIR', for example.

ICD's own drivers (for "native" ST TOS/GEM) deal with this problem
just fine:  With their v6.4.3 driver, you can set the number of
retries up to 4.  I've not had any trouble with ICD this way running
this very same h.d. when it goes to sleep like this.  (You can tell it
is retrying, however; and it's recovering & resetting itself just
fine.)

So I need the same "recovery" for Cumana/OSK v2.3 in this STHD
module.

Yeah, this is *so* irritating...  If & whenever I can get this fixed
in the STHD driver, I'll post everything in a synopsis so y'all will
know what to do to make any make/model drive and your ICD interface
work _reliably_ with OSK.  (Could even put it into the FAQ.)

Thank you a bunch for your time -- we're getting close but still no
cigar!

     From: 10BAUD       To: DBREEDING

Oh yeah--the ^C problem.  Some one here on Delphi gave me the
solution to that one,too.  I run osterm from the following
procedure file:

t
chd /d0/USR/DLD/telcom/WORK
display c
tmode .1 abort=0 quit=0
load osterm&
osterm </1
tmode .1 abort=3 quit=5


The "abort=0" in the tmode command prevents the operating system
from intercepting the control-c character allowing osterm send it
to delphi.

Another solution to that problem is to get to an os9 prompt (by using
the shell command or the clear key to get to another window) and
typeing:

  display 03 >/t2

You're right that it could use a few touch ups, but by now, it feels
to me like the software equivalent of an old comfortable sweater.
And I just make allowances :>

I never had any problem with it being intercepted, I just sent it from
the keyboard and then let the autodialer do the rest.  I just could not
get the control sequence to work from a macro.

I like it too.  And as you say, it is pretty comfortable.

Also I guess any software you name has something somewhere that could be
fixed.  I know "we" can always find something that could be done better <G>.

all! Mines as oddball as they come, its been patched for the seriel mouse.
CC3Disk... Unless you are running an aftermarket controller, whats going
on is that probably its been modified for quicker motors/step etc. Go
back to the distribution disks and get that one. The aftermarket stuffs
have been pretty well covered tho. My disto no-halt (SCII) runs great.
SmartWatch... I don't think thats covered in what I've got here either, and

Yeah, I got back after making a new boot disk. I'll keep this disk for
future blunders(and we know there will be many) so that I won't have to
do again. I copy your statements on os9p3. This is what I've been doing
wrong. After the original patch pass, I gathered all the modules that
needed a different version until I had a complete os9boot patched. I
went crazy trying to figure out why it won't boot. It finally dawned
on me that my bootfile might be good(patched) but my kernel in memory
wasn't. So now I have a patched kernel in a file in my root directory
of my bootdisk and I'm trying to figure how to put the kernel and
os9boot together on track 34 where they belong. I tried the util
called kwikboot but it does work the way I want which is to overwrite
the existing kernel(unpatched) with my patched version. Of course
there is another tedious way. Gather all the patchable modules in a
new boot, boot it up and let nitros find all good patchable mods
and create a new boot that way. This is not easy. Thanx Gene for all
your help. Charlie

     Ramdisk
     From: WDTV5        To: ALL

I'm in the middle of doing a fresh ramdisk for the os-9'ers, based VERY
loosely on the devpack version but capable of useing ram up to the amount
in the machine even if its a 2 megger!
I started on this because the compiler chokes if /r0 isn't iniz'ed first,
thinking that was a bug. Well it is and it isn't. OS-9 is doing that to
us as it does its own "iniz" on the module if it hasn't been already,
then allows the write of a file to the ramdisk without reporting any
errors.  Unforch, if it self initialized it, it also de-inits it at the
end of the write! So the file is lost, and c.pass1 (ansifront) can't
find the output from c.prep. I want to stop that, effectivly making the
ramdisk refuse to deinit if the directory isn't empty. I'm torn between
using the regular error paths to report it, or just outputting the
phrase "the root dir isn't empty" on stderr. If I use an error number,
then the compiler and other progs will probably choke on it anyway when
in fact they could keep on truckin! So I need some input, what do tou
all (you) want it to do. The choices are to ignore it without errors, and
let you folks learn to delete all files before deiniting, haveing an
error mesage pop up at odd times, or returning a process killing error.
What'll it be folks?

You're doing something I've not done, use the ramdisk as a dl catcher. I
always goto the default dir option I'v got programmed into SC23 here.
Which is direct to my hard drive as i figure if I don't like it, theres
always that 'del' I wrote to handle bad puppies. So I can't define by my
own experience whether or not the ramdisk is flakey when running SC.
However, I will check into that before I'm done. Right now, whats happening
to the ramdisk if you forget to Iniz it is that os9 iniz's it just long
enough to allow an error free copy into it to take place, but as soon as
the copy operation is done, os9's internal link count for that device goes
back to zero so os9 deinits the darned thiing. Increasing the link count
in the root directories FD sector does NOT tell os9 to leave it alone.
According to what I'm reading, and my interpretation of same, if the link
count is greater than 0, it should leave it alone. It don't, needless to
say. I may be able to diddle os9's own copy of that link count but so far
have not investigated that path yet, time constraints and all that.
On another tack, I did figure out how to divide my golf score by 3 legally.

Maybe, but thats poor housekeeping too. Yeah, I know, if forgetting to iniz
it is poor housekeeping, then I'm guilty many times. But if it refuses to
deinit from either the os9 automatic, or from the deinit command until its
empty, to me that would be much the lesser of the evils. If I do that, I
think that instead of attempting to define a new error code, I'd have it
spit out a short msg via stderr, clean up the carry and B reg and return
with no error to report. That would depend on something to display the msg
sitting on the stderr path, but we have that 90+% of the time anyway.
Not fixed yet, not even a general shape in warm butter! Still looking

A friend of mine has a used RS PC, but wrote a program in basic. I asked him
to give me a 3.5 disk of the program and someone here may see if it can be
used for OS9. I doubt that the above is possible, but if he gives me the
program, I will try to upload it to see what you think unless told otherwise
by a Sysop. I realize this is OS9, but he has in enexpensive RS (so he says)
and wrote the program in basic.

Hi Frank!

   Thanks for the replacement disk! G-Windows is now running fine, except!
I'm having some problems with the file-recognizer. I wrote a recognizer to
use with sound files, and, it doesn't work. But, neither do the three
included with G-Windows. Any un-recognized file is shown as binary and
the information menu says that the file type is 'umacs <>>>/win &'. Looks
like a problem parsing the list within desktop. (I did a little fiddling).

I'm afraid I may have tossed out a pretty bad curve with that last msg
regarding os9p3. It turns out that the one I have in memory has been stretched
by one byte at some time back about the kt boundary in an attempt to de-blob
the system, and has since propagated down thru all the boot disks I've made
since then. The real size of every copy of os9p3 (includeing from the
NITRO directories) is $140 (320 decinal) and the crc is $3B3304.  It hasn't
des that I know of. Sorry about the
confusion that $141 long os9p3 may have caused, its local to my system,

Yep, at least for Las Vegas blackjack.  You can make an insurance bet
any time the dealer has an ace for the upcard.  If the dealer has 21,
the player gets twice the amount of the insurance bet.  If the dealer
does not have 21, the player loses the insurance bet.  The player's
insurance bet can only be half the original bet.  Example:  Player's
original bet is $10.  Dealer has ace upcard.  Player makes insurance
bet of $5.  Dealer has 21 -- player gets $10; no 21 -- player loses
$5.

Player can double down, that is, double the original bet on any two
cards.  Then the player receives only one more card and the player's
card count must beat the dealer's card count for a win.

Hope this helps, can go into more detail if you like.

     From: PAGAN        To: CURTPANTLE

 Curt,

 Sure does help, thanks.  Let me recap the algorithm briefly to make sure I
 understand:

 Insurance:

    1. Dealer has ace showing.  Else go to 4

    2. Player can place a bet of 1/2 his original bet that the dealer
       has a "natural" (21).  Rounded up or down?

    3. If dealer has 21 the player recovers the insurance bet and is paid
       twice that amount by the house.  Else the insurance bet belongs
       to the computer.

    4. play proceeds normally.

 This changes things a bit since the version of Hoyle I based the program on
 says the dealer wins automatically if he has a 21.

 Double down:

    1. Player doubles bet right after deal is done.  Takes one more card.

    2. Player's turns ends.

    3. Play proceeds normally

 I assume that this is only invoked if the player has 11 in his hand.  It
 doesn't make much sense otherwise.

     RE: rule for blackjack (Re: Msg 87738)

Stehen,

Your algorithmns are perfectly correct.  On an insurance bet the dealer
will make change in quarters so that the player can make the bet exactly
half of the original bet.  Most players take the insurance bet (it's
actually just an extra bet) if they have 21.  If the dealer has 21,
the player will win the insurance bet, but "push", that is get back his
original bet.  If the dealer does not have 21, the player loses the
insurance bet, but wins his original bet, since the player has 21.  In
this sense then it's an insurance bet for the player who has 21, because
the player will win the hand regardless of what the dealer has.

On the double down most players will always double if they have 11 as you
are saying.  However, if the dealer has an upcard that is not a ten,
most players will double down in this situation.

Anyway, these are rules of strategy rather than rules of play.  Speaking
of books on card rules, there are books that lay out what is called
basic strategy.  Basic strategy is a set of decision-making rules for
the player that determines the player's course of action depending on
the player's card count and the dealer's upcard.  Basic strategy in
many cases was devised by a computer program that did three things:

1.  implemented the game according to the rules of play

2.  automated the game to play thousands of hands automatically with
the player's decisions being made according to a set of rules

3.  kept track of the outcomes so that the success of the player
could be determined in accord with which set of rules were being used
for the player's decisions

Well, anyway I'm always fascinated with applying computer power to
games and probability models -- good luck with your project!

     OS-9 Live! Conference
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

In the spirit of promoting OS-9, I've set up the OS-9 Live! conference
on the first and third Saturday night of every month at 10:00pm Eastern.
This conference is open to all OS-9 users, but I would hope to keep
topics mainly geared toward OS-9/680X0 and OS-9000.  For the first few
conferences, I don't have a specific topic planned, but anticipate
that will change.

Hopefully some fruitful discussion will eminate from these conferences.
I certainly plan on being consistent with this idea.  I don't intend
for this to be "yet another conference" or a bull session, but something
with substance.

The first conference is planned for this Saturday, June 4 at 10:00pm EST.
I look forward to seeing you there.

 Well,  you pulled through for us Boisy! :-) I plan on being there unless
 something comes up.
 A couple ideas for conference topics you may want to consider:

 1) Every couple of months or so, the topic should be devoted to the latest
    going's on of the OS9 UG. This may help inform nonmembers and turn them
    into members.
 2) At this stage one idea is to develope an ongoing theme of the conference
    with that theme being the migration from OS-9 Level II to Profession OS-9
    This could prove beneficial, as people who have been putting off
    upgrading due to lack of understanding the OSK environment. Even if the
    so far non-OSK users aren't Coco users, it is possible that people from
    other platforms may be interested in 'zomething different' :-) If we
    inform them on what is available and show all the possible paths they can
    travel with OS-9<notice the '-' you demand<Grin>.
 3) At a certain point before each fest, we should devote on or more
conferences    to the upcoming fest.
    Well, I'll quit now, but I'm just getting warmed up. There are so many
   topics we can cover with the conference, we may need to start a couple
   more. :-)

Ken,
  It was great seeing you too. I had a great time. Didn't get much sleep
friday or Saturday night. Toooooo busy talking to everyone and checking
out all the behind the closed door stuff. (future products and such).
The wolfinstien clone was very outstanding. When he gets it ready to sell,
it's going to be a hot item.
  anyway, yes I am using the "sh" shell, but I have tried various ways to
run the game. I open another window using the standard shell, error
I then reset my SHELL enviroment to "shell", still error.
Then I reconfigured the OS9Boot to use the stock "sysgo", still error.
Sure thought by using the stock sysgo, it would work.
Memory should not be a problem. 2033 KBytes befor starting game and
1813.5 KBytes after starting game.
Sound works if executed as:

   phasers
   shell phasers

When I reconfigured using the stock "sysgo", this was off the new upgrade
disk that I got from David at the fest and using the latest "bgfx" that
I also got from David at the fest.

As a software engineer, I know all too well the trials and tribulations of

Heh, heh. Yeah, some of them are tough to win. Particularly Spider and
Canfield. Pyramid normally has about a 2-5% win rate, while Klondike has

     Nitros-9
     From: CHARLESAM    To: MITHELEN (NR)

   Well Paul, I finally got it working, Nitros-9 that is. Had to start
   scratch and put all the patchable modules in a boot. After I booted
   with these modules, I used nitros9 to make a new boot from memory.
   It works fine, with an obvious increase in speed during boot. My
   long startup which gives me Dynastar, Supercomm, and Presto-Partner
   all up and running, plus an extra window for working, takes 1:15 as
   opposed to 1:45 prior to Nitros-9. That includes 31 modules loaded
   into memory other than my boot mods. The only set-back being none of
   my games work, coco crashes if I try loading them. I'll just use
   my old bootfile when I want to run them. Grfdrv is the most important
   module where graphics are concerned, and I've updated that mod. The
   speed increase with just that change (grfdrv) is remarkable. When
   I play Klondike(Solitaire), I get instant results when calling for
   a new deal. I'll just get good use out of the multiboot utility I
   got at the Fest. Did you finish doing your friend's upgrade yet? I
   found some modules that the upgrade bombs on, like RBF $4B1153. It
   upgrades okay but an ident shows BAD CRC. Of course it won't boot.
   I used RBF $EFBE13, which is the original. It happened twice like
   that, so I know its a bug in the patch program. Well now I got some
   more docs to read so I can install more STUFF.... I have the multi-
   boot util, CocoTop- a mouse driven utility, a games disk with five
   games included, VED - text editor and some other stuff I forgot I
   bought. Oh yeah, QuikLetter, which I should do first cause it will
   save me memory over Dynastar. Of course I'm waiting for the two meg
   upgrade also. Busy, busy, busy.... My wife is talking divorce here.
   Thanx for your input, I'm always glad to get the help. Charlie

It is probably that the Klondike he is referring to is not mine. My
Klondike uses perfectly "legal" OS9 code and should work on any OS9 engine.
And there were numerous Klondike's for OS9 released.

Can't really help here, except to provide some encouragement:  Since Alan
DeKok is a confirmed NitrOS-9 user, it's a safe bet that his Smash can
be made to run under Nitros.  And, assuming that you are referring to the
NX version of Shanghai, it was ported to OS-9 by Alan and Bill Nobel, one
of the Nitros authors -- so it should also be compatible.

A shot in the dark from the blind... perhaps these programs are using
'vdgint'.  Did this module patch OK during your installation?  Is it
included in your bootfile?

Best of luck... / Ken

        Hi again Mike, long time no see. I'm just writing to update you
   on the latest progress I have made with my Protector utility project I
   told you about before. And of course, I have questions about my latest
   non-feature<Grin>. This is also aimed at anyone else in forum who may
   have some clues, and a little time to check the source, or run it in
   from basic09. Since hooking my fathers printer to the Coco, I have
   started working on my programming projects once again<I can't stand
   not having the printouts. I don't care for having to constantly switch
   through windows to compare code>. I have since fixed, as far as I
   know, all the problems I was reporting before. Of course it's been
   about a week or two, so I already forget what those problems were I
   was having, but it was a matter of modifying a loop structure a
   certain way that did the trick. I couldn't quite understand why the
   fix I did worked<it didn't seem to logically differ from the code I
   already had, but since it worked...>. I should be keeping printouts of
   the old source so I should remember exactly what those questions are
   so I can post to all here, just to better understand things. Anyhow,
   that's not what I'm here to ask about.

        For the most part, I have MOST of the program done. Once I get
   through this latest glitch, I will just add a couple more features I
   am hoping to add, which, knock on wood<a couple times> shouldn't be
   too much trouble. Just for a quick rundown for those who don't know or
   remember the purpose of this program, it is designed to take files
   entered in standard input<keyboard> or from a text file<once I add the
   -f flag>, and compare those files with the filenames in the current
   data directory. If the names are NOT equal to eachother, the program
   will delete the files else if they do equal eachother, the program
   will 'protect' them and spare them from being deleted. So basically it
   deletes all the files in the directory except those entered by the
   user. The opposite of delete :-)

        After studying your _Toupper.b09_ and _Protect.b09_ programs, I
   incorporated toupper into my program, as well as some of  'protect'
   and for the most part, after some fine tuning and debugging, things
   started to work out. After giving the filenames of those I want
   protected, in array form, the toupper procedure takes it and converts
   all lowercase to uppercase and then list all those files to the
   screen<in uppercase form>. Then the program opens up the dir file and
   reads all the filenames into an array, and converts them to uppercase.
   I then put in an 'if/then/else' statement that tests to see if
   'newname(count)',the name array given by the user from keyboard, is
   equal to 'name' which is the current filename being retrieved from
   disk. If it is not equal it is supposed to print:

        Deleting: filename

        and if they are equal it is supposed to print:

        Filename is protected

        Now the screen will then print the filename from disk to screen
   and it appears to work fine. The problem is, the program thinks that
   all of the files are NOT-EQUAL, so if the delete command wasn't
   commented out, it would go one to delete all files in the directory.
   It simply prints: 'Deleting: filename' for all the files, even tho the
   files I entered were entered correctly were coverted to caps just like
   the files that the program read from disk. I can't for the life of me
   figure out where the program is finding a difference between the two
   sets of filenames. If you, or anyone else reading has a chance to go
   over the code and maybe try running it from basic, I sure won't object
   ;-). And keep in mind, I commentout OUT the 'Delete Name' command so
   you won't lose any files. I'll include the source in the next message.

        Thanks...

     From: VE3DAC       To: WDTV5 (NR)

Well following some advice from Wes Gale, I went back to the RBF  from
nitro 1.15.  That seems to have solved my problem.  Wes has an occassional
archiving problem with LHA and he feels there is something they have done
in RBF which is causing some of us a problem.
   I am now using  RBF30 (undelete)  CRC        FA84C1.  Could it be that your
RBF isn't a Nitro 1.16 module?  Wes wants all the help he can get to solve
the problem.  Thanks for letting me bend your ear.

     Multivue
     From: CURTPANTLE   To: COLORSYSTEMS (NR)

Zack,

I found my recent reply to you was garbled - since then I found that three
"#define"'s near the end of stdmenu.h had a "\" and a CR.  When I deleted
these, it compiled fine.

Also, if anyone else is working with Multivue for the first time (I just got
it 2 weeks ago), the MV manual says to comile the C source to a .r file;
then link cgfx.l, clib.l and sys.l in that order.  You have to put clib.l
first in the linkage order, otherwise you get a linker fatal error.

In addition to header and library files, I still need menu and window
descriptors and mouse code.  Seems like a lot of work to point and click,
but I guess the hard part is putting it together for the first time.  On
the plus side, MV works as advertised and I figured out how to write the
AIF's to start several apps from MV.

     Programming in C
     From: MROWEN01     To: ALL

     I need some help with 'C' on the Coco 3. I am diving into writing some
programs, one because I need the programs, two because I want to leanr C. I
haven't done anything elaborate yet. I have been working with C in both DOS
and UNIX environments up to this point. I prototyped some code under DOS, but
als, it will not be portable to UNIX or OS9. DOS compilers support the
getch function. This is the same as an inkey$ function in Coco basic. You
press a key and  program flow continues.  How do I duplicate this function under

Microware C or UNIX C? I tried to use getchar and getc under UNIX, but they
still require a carriage return. If someone could enlighten me....

     The code under UNIX that I tried was :

        key = getc(stdin);

even this !

        key = fgetc(stdin);

NO LUCK! I need to write some terminal based apps for my Coco 3, and C seems
to be a good way of doing it. Anyone who has written in C on the Coco; If
you can give me tips or point me to patches and libraries you would recommend
I would appreciate it. I will upload what ever code I manage to hack.

Thanks.

Mike
