I plan to play with the cables by hooking the original connector to H1 and
powering up. If the light comes on then, it has to be else where(the problem).
Thanx for the tip, I'll try it your way too. Keep you posted. ...Charlie...

Mike, I tried alot of different things now but in answer to your question,
yes it did stay on. I loosened the face plate and it went off which leads
me to believe that that problem was a pinched wire. What I have now is
my new drive hooked up as the only drive. I replaced the termination
resistors, and took off the jumper sleeve altogether. Just like my original
setup for /h0, which btw works fine. I used my lockout boot with DD=D0.
I booted and now when I do a directory, format, or chd to /h0, I get a
#246 which is device not ready. Now for sure I'm lost. BTW, when I address
Thanx Charlie

Just an effect of laziness.  With one drive, a lot of people don't bother with
adjusting the ID of the drive (no jumpers it seems to be zero) so it reads
anything on the buss.  Put a second drive on there and it is "scratch-head"
city when a conflict develops.  Why it works with no jumpers, I dunno.  The
"controller" is usually 0.  I banged my head on the wall for a month on this
until someone explained it to me real carefully.  BTW, I have 2 hard drives and
a CDROM drive on my MM/1 and they are all talking to the machine very happily.
I guess I got it right! (grin)  Good luck. I hope this did solve the problem.
, H0 is #0, H2 is #2 and the CDROM is # 1.  Look
at ctrlid on dmode and see if they are different on the two drives.  They
should be or else they will fight with each other.

I seem to understand that the Id has to be different. I'm using scsisys and
I believe my Ids are straightened out but there is also a jumper to the
left of the control cable and I'm not sure about the placement of that.
Also, I substituted my new drive for the existing drive as H0, but os9
refuses to recognize it. I get Unit not ready ERROR. I believe now  that
there is some problem with the drive. I'll keep working on it. Thanx

 If I order PowerBasic, do I have to pay the $300 price or $800.  Understand,
 if performance of the object code proves satisfactory and my productivity is
 improved, I will use it for commercial software.  Some object code might even
 find its way into some VOD (DAVID) stuff (drivers and other system state
 modules).

 It is to be expected that 'undocumented features' crop up in a new package
 such as this (no negative conotation intended - just an unfortunate fact of
 life).  As bugs are found and fixed, will updates be sent automatically?

However I don't know when the sysop will get to it. The following
is the contents of the last file, the ReadMe file.

                  PowerBasic Benchmark results
                             12/9/94

This archive has 49 files. 4 versions of each benchmark and a
ReadMe file. It is archived twice. Once with Ar V2.0 (40476
bytes) and again with LHa V 2.01 (28458 bytes). Both done under
OSK.

The nature and results of bench2 through bench12 are as follows:
(all tests were run on an 030 system @33MHZ w/ 1 wait state)
(all times are in seconds)

 PB      MW      Name of Test       Nature of Test
 3       33      bench2          increment variable in loop
 2       N/A     bench2m       same as bench2 but with assembly MACRO

 15      237     bench10       assign constant to integer variable in loop
 6       72      bench11       control structures "false" in loop
 2       32      bench12       "land" function in loop

There are 4 variations of each benchmark. *.b is the PowerBasic
source, *.b09 is the same source with minor mods needed for
Basic(09), *.obj is the compiled code and *.a is the unaltered
output of PowerBasic in assembler source. The *.a files are
complete but you cannot assemble them because they need the
runtime subroutine package called 'runsubs' which is part of
PowerBasic.

Note that 'shell date -j' was used because the early version of
PowerBasic that was used to compile these benchmarks did not have
the 'date$' function implemented yet. Note that these times
should be viewed on their own rather than as a test of the speed
of any particular computer. They are just to show the speed
advantage of the compiled code of PowerBasic.

I have downloaded almost every Basic source program here and I
hope to compile then under PowerBasic to see what is involved in
a typical conversion and to see what size and speed advantage
PowerBasic has. In the above benchmarks you will note the small
size of the *.b09 files compared to the size of the *.obj. Don't
forget the the *.b09 files have to have 'runb' which is about
24K. Obviously using PowerBasic on small programs will result in
a very small runtime program over Basic(09). (BTW I know that on
OS9/68000 it is called BASIC and not Basic09. I use the (09) to
avoid confusion.)

I've just uploaded an example utility for the date function. After I uploaded
the stuff last night I got to playing. This is my actual first attempt at
several things. 1... Writing an actual program in PowerBasic, 2... Doing
anything in assembly language. Doing the second is very easy in PB. The
upload is this:

Name: POWERBASIC DATE UTILITY EXAMPLE
Type: PROGRAM
Date: 10-DEC-1994 16:02 by FHOGG (able to edit the Group)

This is a example of a date utility written in PowerBasic. It shows doing a mix
of assembly and Basic and the use of alias's. PowerBasic source, the assembly .
a
file and the object are in the archives. The same stuff is in each file. One is
in LHa 2.01 and the other is ar 2.0.

   2  POWERBASIC DATE EXAMPLE (LHA) (Size: 4476 Count: 0)

The source for PowerBasic is short so it now follows:

**************************************

* This is a good example of the flexability and power of mixing
* assembly language and Basic statements in one program.

 dim dateB(2):short alias=date
 dim day:short
**********************************
* Month and day are bytes and year is a short (2 bytes) the easiest
* way to get them out of the long is by using alias arrays. The byte
* array gets the month and day while the short array gets the year.
* Note that these do not take any additional memory, they just point

**********************************

 print dateA(3);"/";dateA(4);"/";dateB(1);
 print "  ";timeA(2);":";timeA(3);":";timeA(4);
 print " and ";tickA(2);"/";tickA(1);" Seconds"
 goto Quit
Perror
 move.w d1,TimeError(a6) Error code is now in TimeError
 print "Err: ";TimeError
Quit
 end


Sure is easy to do things I would never have been able to try in either C
or assembly. I don't know if this could be done in MW Basic but I don't
want to bother. BTW the compile time for this is 13 seconds which includes
running PowerBasic, r68 and l68. I'm using a somewhat slow hard drive too.
I suppose I could do this on /r0 but 13 seconds is fast enough for me.

It appears the lines you are having a problem with are INTL, MSG ID and PID in
the header. Offhand, the MSG ID should be a unique message identifier (in this
case it appears to be composed of the FIDO node/net number followed by what
could be the time in UNIX ctime() format). The PID appears to be nothing more
than the name and version number of the BBS software and the last line is a
signature -- in this case an advertisement for RiBBS v2.10. The INTL 1 line
could be the source and destination node/net numbers of the FIDO systems, or
perhaps something inserted by the mailer.

If it's not documented, you either need better documentation or these lines are
optional.

     Install program
     From: TEDJAEGER    To: ALL

Hi all,
       I'm trying to develop an installation program for applications
written for the MM1. To date, I have a point and click shell that
allows user to specify from what drive, to what drive, name of
program, etc. Once the parameters are established, the install
program runs a script that is provided by the programmer. The script,
of course, is responsible for actually moving the files from
installation disk to wherever.

What do you  guys make of this general plan? It is hard to do error
checking in the script file from the install program. (Tips?) Also Joel H
discussed copying files from an installation disk to a pipe and
then from pipe to target disk in a 68 Micros column. I tried that
approach but quickly ran into the limitation that you can't create
a directory inside a pipe or do a backup of a disk into a pipe. Least
I kept getting error messages! Seemed to mean that the install program
would have to assume that all the component files of the application
program would be in the same directory (/d0) on the installation disk. I
really dont want to make that assumption.

Thoughts appreciated

Have you considered using the `oddjob' program?  You can do things
that the fancy UNIX shells do, and everyone with an MM/1 should have
it..
