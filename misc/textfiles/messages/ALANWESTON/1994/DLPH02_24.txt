Yes, but, transmissions are even a worse problem. Especially when using
a modem that requires hardware handshakeing. Most of that problem lies in
the standard 6551.

When trying to use an advanced bi-directional protocal like netxfr for StG,
all these little problems stack up, and reliable transfers become near
impossible on a "stock" setup. With the proper hardware hacks, and software
changes, you can get decent reliability (although throughput still isn't near
what the theretical max throughput should be)

With Supercomm 2.3 beta, and using a LineLink 14.4 modem it will connect
just fine at 9600 but during the online session, characters are lost.  This is
using a CoNect 6551A board and SACIA (patched).  Downloading with any
protocol (compression turned off) yeilds about 400 cps average.  The
highest that I have ever received with Ymodem batch was 500 cps.  There
are alot of errors during the transfer which slows the system down.  Zmodem
will top out at an average of 250-300 cps.  At 4800 baud ymodem yeilds
425-450 cps and zmodem gets an average of 375-400 cps.

My bbs and uucp software works fine at 4800 baud but not 9600.

Jim,

  You have something wrong, very wrong. SuperComm 2.2 (and 2.3) will do 9600
with a 920 cps thoughput (ramdisk, about 750cps to harddrive) with box stock
OS-9 with the exception of upping AciaPak's buffer to greater than 150
characters.
  If you are missing chars, then *something* is hogging the CPU with IRQ's
off for long amounts of time. The usual culprit isa non-stock clock. Use
Eddie's edition 9 clocks. I do know from my own personal machine that the
Disto Xn1 clock driver limits the system to 4800. Eddie's disto clock works
fine.

BTW, does it really take twelve lines to tell everyone who you are?

I don't currently have access to a high speed modem for testing but
when I did have one here I wasn't able to get reliable 9600 baud.
I am using Eddie's edition 9 clock for the B&B, and the patched scaia
driver, XTP=8F.  Downloads were done to the hardrive, but nowhere near
750 cps.

Actually 10 lines but who's counting <grin>.  If I get InfoXpress to

Well.  I'm using the patch sacia (xtp=$8f) and Eddie's clock Ed. #9

I don't have a high speed modem to test it here but when I had one here
we couldn't get better then 4800 bps throughput.

The WANG I operate is considered a "mid-range". Our system has to run 24hrs
also, but we do an IPL on occasion (let's see.. that's "Initial Program Load"..
BOOT to anyone but a mid-range/mini person!). If we change the device list,
we have to IPL anyway (change terminal type, add a termina change printer,
etc.). So it gets done during "quiet time". We don't actually power-down
the CPU and drives either, just everything else.

Al, I agree.. there should be some way to allow at least one other terminal
to perform as a system console. We have to reset from the system console,
but all underlying functions can be shut down by any sys-op from any terminal.
A person still has to have rights to get that far. We don't have a security
problem on our large system, you shouldn't have one either. But no one here
has rights to do any more than their job calls for either..

        It seems to me the question is not how to shut down from a
terminal, but why the heck is the console crashing? Once the console is
gone, a mere hour for a sloppy restart isnt that bad, considering the
system was already corrupted when powered down.
        FWIW, drives are kinda like lightbulbs- MTBF is better when always
on, but actual use hours may be better for _lightly_ used machines if shut
down between use.

You are exactly right in that the real problem is that the console keyboard
locks up
but it happens so in frequently ( once a week or so ) its hard to have someone
who knows what he's doing there when it locks.  We have been hoping to have a
work around until such time as the failure becomes more reliable.

Humm, I don't know about that. Didja stop to think just how big the
referenceing file would have to be (and be ratained (retained) in memory too)
which would take one heck of a hunk of the 64k of ram available for that
process. I think some limited use might be made of it tho. The "prtr_contrl"
file it presently uses is what makes it as close to universal as it is now.
I suppose we could make it bigger (al lot bigger) and define whats beyond
the current setup as extensions. Due to the variable size, that would need
an int reserved in the first line to define how big the file really is.
I'll think about it, but not having an escp2 myself, it will run into
communications delays I'm sure. My present printer can take a downloaded
font which I've not played with, and I'd assume we're talking basicly the
same thing here. Download the alternate font, and switch to it for the

thought about buying it. I'd like to
get your input on the packages capabilities etc... I beleive TSEDIT itself
is going for less than $20 so I dont expect perfection but nor do I want

Having used both packages (Scripsit and TSEdit), I'd say it really depends on
what you want the software for.  TSEdit & TSWord make a poor word processor.
For example, You can't change the font in the middle of a line.  You get 1
font per line because of the way TSWord expects the font command.  It must
be at the beginning of the line.  However, TSEdit (with the 'vi' patches)
makes an excellent source code editor.  Esp. for those of us stuck using
UNIX at work.

If you're looking for a word processor, there are a couple of others out
there, but I've never used them.  Maybe someone else can help you there.

Keith,

It is my recommendation that, instead of TSEDIT or SCRIPSIT, you find Max-10,
Wordpower 3.3 or VIP writer on the RSDOS side or Dynastar 3.4 and Dynaspell,
The WPShel, VED, VPrint and TSPell combination available here from
COLORSYSTEMS, Bob van der Poel (not here) and Tandy Express Order on the OS9
side.

There are also available here many good text editors which may be used in
conjunction with good text formatters also available here on the SIG.  You
may even find a spell checker here too.  Good hunting.

        >>Bob Van der Poel(not here)

        Just wanted to let you know, that while Bob Van Der Poel is not
   available on Delphi<because he can't get local access in his neck of
   the woods>, you can talk to David Graham of Blackhawk ent. about
   getting Ved and Vprint. For those  who want to contact him or are
   interested in ordering something from him, his user name is 'NIMITZ'.
   That is where I got my copy of Ved+Vprint. As I've said before, while
   not technically a word processor that combination is probably the best
   piece software I've ever gotten, and contains more than all the
   features I would look for in a word processor, and is very complete.
   Also, Blackhawk is a good company to deal with<obvious with their
   determination to get the MM/1 back where it belongs. The plan to be
   here for a while>.
        I've heard great things about the Dynastar package<with Dynaform
   and spell and such> as well as those RSdos packages, but can't really
   speak for them myself. I'm willing to bet they are all better choices
   than the TSword/edit packages. I do have Simply Better for RSdos which
   is a great piece of software which I just haven't used for a while.
        My philosophy is, unless you need to don't buy Tandy products
   except maybe if it's from one of the vendors. For one, the third party
   stuff right now is for the most part better, and these vendors that
   still operate and SUPPORT the Coco and OS9 could use the buisiness
   more than some company that could care less.

        Wow, did I write ALL that?!! ^

Well, allow to be off-forum for the moment. The best word processor for the
CoCo is still Simply Better, which is DECB based. It is still available
from Rick's Computer Enterprises for $17, with V-Term thrown in for good
measure. The latest phone nunber I have for Rick's is 606-787-5783.

There are several editors free from delphi if used with MRoff or one of the
other print-formatters it works pretty good, there is also an editor named
Sled, which is one of my favorites, there is a spell checker for OS-9 in the
OS-9 Users Group directory, although the dictionary file isnt in there
(however, Paul (MITHELEN) might be kinda enough to supply ASCII format
dictionary file from his Sun UNIX system..so you could use that..)
If you really want to buy a commercial product, I suggest Ved/Vprint
both are very nice. If you do buy TSEDIT, there are patches in the database
to enhance/spruce it up..

Mike,

I think these were products of Frank Hogg Labs.  They may in fact be
discontinued, but you might try CoNect from here (RICKULAND) to see if
Rick may be able to turn up any copies of Dynastar/Dynaspell.  Sorry,
but I am not aware of other commercial sources for these now.  I included
them because sometimes these things turn up in the CoCo community if they
appear here.

Jim,

I forgot about Simply Better.  I have a copy of it too, but I only use it
sparingly because I don't like its interface to the user.  I find it
awkward to learn and so I have favored other programs.  However, I am
aware that many CoCoers swear by it, and it is a fully-functional word
processor.  Forgive my oversight.

Do you mean "Home Publisher" from Tandy?  Given that and your other requirements

I would consider Ved/Vprint combination from Bob van der Poel.

Yep.  I think everyone who has ever done that installation has had problems
getting the new kernel on their new boot disk.  I think you have to give it the
 -N option to tell it not to update the OS9Boot file, or you have to give it
the -l to link the OS9Boot file.  I think I just played with the command
options untill it worked.  You might also want to try 'chd /d0' before you
do the kwikboot command.  just some suggestions.  Wish I could remember.
Good Luck.

        There is a patch to feed busspower to 4n1- which will go on mpi.
But stock, it always needs the lump. Now, a drive problem won't show on an
unpowered 4n1- it's dead. A powered system will either work or crash the mpi
(as in your case) or the whole coco (if plugged in direct). Time to sniff the
drive side.

Your disto power supply could be the problem also, On my brothers Disto System
we did not have to original power supply, so I used a 12v 300miliamp pack, and
we had the same problem You are having, then I purchased a 1.5 amp pack and the
problem just disap

     From: DONALDS      To: ALL

I am looking for someone that is running 2 ST-XXXn drives with Matt Thompson
 new drivers. I am running 2 - ST277n drives with the version 1.0 drivers.
I got the version 2.2 drivers. I was able to make discriptors for drive 0
 and update to version 2.2. I maded discriptors for the second drive. did
a PHYISICAL (low level) format OK then; when I went to do a LOGICAL format
the lite would flicker a bit then just stay lite; after a 1/2 hour I shut
 it off. Now with version 1.0 after several formats (PHYS and LOGIC) I am
able to use both drives. But; I tried version 2.2 again but when I do a
dir on drive 1 the lite comes on and just hangs there. Logical format is
the same lite will flicker then hang there. Does anyone have a idea as to
why this is happening.

SuperComm on startup checks the montype, and if mono sets up a different
than normal palette. This particulat chunk of code has been in there since
the old days. I haven't touched it, and frankly, I can't remember even testing
it out. So, make sure you have the montype set correctly (add the line
 "montype m" to your startup file), and get back to me if it stil doesn't
work.

Also, make sure you're starting SuperComm with the recommended "<>>>/w&"
redirection. This is recommended because on some machines, in certain
windows, starting SC up directly will cause things to hang in the middle
of screen redefining. hen it hangs, you end up with a pure white screen.
BTW, I've been looking for this "bug" for three years. Does anyone have a
clue??

if you make up descriptors for it, which shouldnt be too hard to do, if you
