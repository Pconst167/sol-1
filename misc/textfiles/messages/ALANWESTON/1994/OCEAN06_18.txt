Colin, one more possible difference is that KTerm uses a resizable and
movable window for the shell.   That will be emphasized more in future
releases.   Thanks for the comments.  I'm looking forward to comparing
products at Atlanta, If we both can get there! 
 
BTW - any of you guys interested in a Dallas Fest?   We're thinking of
having one for OS9er's only called 9Con '95.  Probably in February.....

Colin, I just bought OSTerm at the Chicago fest, and I am using it
to send this message, but,(I bet you knew this was coming<g>), it
seems to be working alright, till I try to do a download.
 I tried once on the Ocean Beach board and once on Delphi, but with
the same result. I would go through all the setup's for an Xmodem
download, and still everything seemed ok, but when the download is
done, from that point I get nothing but garbage characters on the
screen. It acts like the baud rate or parity has been changed.
  I know that it is probably something that I am just not settin up
correctly, but I'm hoping you could give me some clue as to what I
am doing wrong.
Larry

They both sound pretty impressive John. Who markets Kterm? Suppose there will
be any "feature borrowing" between the two? <grin>

Colin, Thanks for the great comparison between OSTerm and KTerm. They both
sound great. You guys are making it tough for folks who are in the market for
a term program. What other new and exciting things are in the works for the
MM/1?

  KTerm is sold by Blackhawk enterprises. Warren Hrach of OcenaBeach BBS 
is a Dealer, He can give you the price and even take the order.

Larry,
    If you can give a bit more info on your setup, ie; term port, baud
rate of modem, I can give some help.  I just tested xmodem1k on my /t0
prot with my old 2400 baud modem and it is doing fine.  Note that other
than /t0, /t3 or /t4 you will not be able to download. I found this the
hard way and also the tech manual will tell you that the other ports are 
missing essential parts.

Of course, I can't vouch for Colin, but I know *I* would be interested
in heading for Dallas in February to an OS-9 event.  (Gee...perhaps I
should post the message that Russ Hoffman posted to comp.os.os9 and the
BITNET CoCo mailing list.  Suffice it to say that people interested in
an OS-9 gathering in Pittsburgh in late summer or early fall should
contact him at reh@fore.com.  That last period ends the sentence and
isn't part of the address. :-)
