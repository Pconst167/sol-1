Anyone...

I am not sure this is where to ask but I got to start some place.....

One of my clients has need for a consultant that is familiar with OS/9, C
programming, realtime data aquisition, signal processing, Motorola 68040 and
Greenspring interface boards. This client is nationwide, but the project
manager is around Pasadena in Southern Calif. However, they do use consultant
in other locations. Right now, they have a consultant in New York doing massive
Microsoft "ACCESS" programming.

If anyone has any idea what this is and wants more detail, send me your number
and location, a brief profile and I will get it to them.

Thanxs,

Phil

Hi Phil,

This is indeed the right place, although you may need some patience.

Can you give any more details in public?

Phil,

This is indeed the right place to post this type of information. I know of a
couple of folks right off the bat that might be interested. I'm sure they'll
see the note and reply if they are.

Thanks!

Saw Bob's original post yesterday, and, like you, the thought had crossed my
mind about trying to get some stuff up here, but thought it *WOULD* look like
scavenging.  The quietness here is a little disconcerting.  Really, I don't
understand, unless it is due to CIS's bad rap RE: co$t.  I don't think it is
all *THAT* bad.  IX is helping at that. I usually call in 2-3 times on weekends
and now usually on Wed nite (I have to pay on both ends of the line <G> ).

Wonder if anything can be done to get some of them back.  I wonder if there are
any CoCo users (except me) still here.  Can't remember now about the last few
msgs.  Seems a big bulk of the traffic on the other service is coco-related
(OS9 sig), and more stuff here is OSK.  This might be good in some ways, but
don't want to see a division.

Ken,

I found your scsi47 on a BBS so I will be giving it a whirl later on this
evening.

I also called Northern Xposure and talked directly to Colin.  He is sending me
the Thompson software.

All set, I think . .

Can someone tell me where to get SCFDEFS and RBFDEFS for OS9 level 2. I
understand they were here at one time but I'm not able to find them. I'm trying
to write a driver for the Speech Systems MIDI card that sends and receives. If
you know where to get such a driver or the defs files, I'd appreciate hearing
about it.

Not sure if they are available here or not.

If you are using "asm", you _SHOULD_ be able to use the Level 1 data for
offsets, etc., anything else that might be needed, you could provide yourself.
The "rma" codes are provided in the Development Pak.
