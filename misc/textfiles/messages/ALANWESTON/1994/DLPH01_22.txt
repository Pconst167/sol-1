Thanks for the info Ken--I tried Matts package and I get as far as getting
a message telling me that there's an error sending message. This comes after
it has read the drive for its data and asks if I want to procede. I left a
message for Matt but no reply yet. I'll try your st225n descriptor and see
if I have any luck. If I bomb out I'll put it up for sale. Thanks again!

2 times there was 18"+ overnight snowfalls while I was coming back after

 That may not be as far fetched as it seems at first read.  One consequence
 of higher average temperatures is increased evaporation from the oceans and
 more energy to drive storm systems.  The net result is more precipitation
 during the 'rainy' season.  If a lot of this extra precipitation is dropped
 as snow the local albedo is increased and more energy is reflected back into
 space.  The melting of the winter snows happens slower despite higher
 average temperature.

 If this cycle repeats itself it can (note: can not will) lead to enough
 energy being reflected back into space to trigger a runaway drop in
 temperature and an ice age.

 Then again, the whole thing could go the other way.

 Water warmed by the sun in the tropics is transported by currents in the
 ocean at moderate depths until in meets colder, more dense, water nearer the
 poles and rises to the surface liberating enormous amounts of heat to the
 atmosphere.  This transport mechanism provides enough heat to keep the
 climate of Europe and North America (relatively) mild.

 Increased temperatures could increase the rate of glacier melt and increase
 the amount of fresh water flowing into the seas.  Since fresh water is less
 dense than salt water it is conceivable that this decrease in salinity of
 the ocean surface would interfere with the mixing.  Without this heat
 transport northern temperatures would begin dropping rapidly and lead to a
 similar catastrophic temperature drop and an ice age.

 Even if both of the above are unlikely - the Earth's weather has proven
 pretty contemptuous of human action so far - something has caused rapid
 temperature drops and glaciation in the past.  Ice cores from Greenland and
 Canada show that glaciers advance much faster than they retreat.  In fact it
 may have taken less than 100 years for the area where Chicago is now to go
 from a climate warmer than it is now to being under a mile of ice!

 Of course, variations in weather are normal with, sometimes, bizarre
 consequences.  Near the end of the 13th century a cold snap in Europe (the
 so-called Little Ice Age) not only wiped out wine making in Briton :-( it
 also prompted a southward migration of the Norway rat which brought along
 it's fleas which brought along the Plague.

Umm... not intending to break in on the Underground news (it IS good to see

I will be dropping the first third class mailing of "68' micros" at the post
office in the morning (20 Jan 94). Should take 7-15 days to get to you. PLEASE
make a note of the day you receive it and post me a message! Anyone else
getting it
and on Delphi can do the same. I'm trying to judge the difference in receipt
across the country. I mailed a week earlier than normal this time, will get two
weeks early next. Also added a bit to the content! You'll note 32 pages plus an
insert this issue, with 32 the targeted norm from now on. It seems one concern
with third class
mailing is that different sections of the country will get the
magazine over a wider time period.... Atlanta (I'm in Georgia, remember?) might
get it in 3-4 days, California two weeks, etc. I  sending Alaska and Hawaii via
first class though, as it takes 7-10 days even first class. Canada is staying
the same at surfac

Yes, "public domain" almost literally means "belonging to the public,"
i.e., anyone can do anything they want with it.
   Many people confuse "public domain" with "freeware".  freeware/shareware
are both "copyrighted", meaning the original author claims some control
over what people can and cannot do with the work.  The GNU software,
for example, has a fairly restrictive copyright which forbids commercial
sale of GNU software or derived works.  "Public domain" is exactly the
opposite of "copyrighted".

Wonderful!  The reason I released XYDown into PD is so that people

Yeah, rz/sz is a weird one.  The early versions of rz/sz are actually PD,
as far as I understand.  It's just the later versions which have that
weird restriction on them (only to be used to communicate with
Omen Technology products?!).  I recently found an early version of
rz/sz sources on the Internet (had to go to Sweden to find it, though!).
I'm planning to work it over and improve it somewhat for use in some
of my own projects.  I believe the version I just grabbed is version 1.24,
and it does appear to be PD (although frustratingly enough, it doesn't
SAY it's PD, just doesn't say it's copyrighted... <sigh>).

 I can relate to that.  Maybe it's because of all those years I spent running
 RPG's but I still believe that a well written text adventure (with some
 graphics) provides more excitement than the pure graphics games.  The
 excercise of the brain is actually good for you!  Sort of like reading a

Hmm...  I'm not using the header files supplied with the GCC distribution,
just the standard Microware header files, and have had no problems at
all.  For the record, I'm using gcc version 1.42.

I have run into some programs that compile with Microware C but not
with GCC.  The problem occurs with references to constant strings
in large modules (over 32k).  GCC seems to stick all the strings
at the beginning, and always uses 16-bit offsets to refer to them.
So you might want to not throw away your Microware C compiler.
Other than that, GCC is _much_ nicer than Microware C.  It gives
better error messages (though you will have to fix the headers before
you start routinely using -Wall), and it supports prototypes, which
I find much easier to use than the old K&R style declarations.

Hope this helps...

 gs2 -sDEVICE=escp2 -r360x360 -sOUTPUTFILE=/p tiger.ps

(I have an Epson Stylus 800.)  In the past, it has sufficed to do

 xmode /p nolf tabc=0

to prepare for output...but after a while, I noticed the paper didn't
seem to be advancing very much!  When it was done, I ejected the page,
to find a VERY wet and VERY black stripe across the top of the page.
Fortunately, the only thing it dripped on was my skin and the plastic
thing for chairs to roll on.  <sigh of relief>

So...I'm tempted to try with "xmode /p lf," but I can't help expecting
that some escape sequence has a 0xd in it somewhere.  What's the right
xmode setting for /p?

James

P.S. As readily as the ink on the Stylus 800 (and ink jets in general)
is water soluble, one would think that I could easily get it off my
skin.  One would be wrong.  :-(

P.P.S. From looking at earlier sources, the Stylus 800 paper margins
seem to be a little different from what the escp2 driver structure
is set to (Stylus 800 wants top .12", left .12", right .38" (unless
inserted manually, in which case it's .12"?!), and bottom .51").  Is
there a way to get this without recompiling?

James,
        I just hooked up my Epson ESC/P2 printer and duplicated
your problem.  Then I looked again at the source for the
epson drivers.  Somewhere between version 2.4 and 2.6, I
reconfigured my desk and gave the Epson to the messydos
machine and the DeskJet to the MM/1.  I used to have a box
that switched either printer to either computer, but since
the 68340 upgrade, the MM/1 printer driver will not tolerate
the long ribbon cables and switch boxes to the printers.

        I looked at the epson drivers and compiled them into
version 2.6.1 and the new gs2 version and I ASSuMEd they
were the same ones as prev versions.  WRONG - someone went
and "improved" them.  When I looked closer at the source, I
saw a "\r\n" sequence getting sent to the printer at the end
of a line and some other changes.  More testing and fixing
is needed.  Meanwhile, the version 2.6.1 and gs2 versions
seem fine on my DeskJet, but EPSON (and IBM Proprinter)
owners better hang on to the older upload.  I'll fix them
and reupload as soon as they are done.

Dunno about MM/1a, but my MM/1 dumps a lot of noise through the
parallel connector.  If I run the printer through the serial port,
there's almost no TV interference, but if I have a cable connected
to the MM/1 parallel port, the interference is pretty bad.  Mouse
shows the same type of problem (mouse plugged in -> more interference).
You might try unplugging peripherals from the MM/1 to see where the

     From: TIMKIENTZLE  To: ROYBUR

Depends on what you mean by "handle multitasking".  Unix and OS9
multitask differently.  OS9 is designed for process control environments
where differences in priority have real meaning.  For that reason,
OS9 priorities work quite differently than Unix, where priority
differences are merely "hints" to the kernel.  Under OS9, a program
with slightly higher priority will tend to lock out lower priority
programs, while under Unix, a slightly higher priority has a much
milder effect.
   If you mean "task switch speed", then OS9 is generally going to
be faster since it has a simpler hardware model (no virtual memory
or other complex hardware state has to be saved).
   OS9's simpler memory management does become a problem in
heavy multi-process environments.  Memory fragmentation becomes
an issue when you have dozens of processes running, a situation
common on Unix machines.

So, I would say it depends on what you want.  Unix is probably
"better" in an environment where real people are working on
networked machines.  OS9 is probably better on a computer that
has to deal with outside hardware.  Those are the environments
each system was designed for.

    Quite true. However, the idea here is to have a function that works FAST.
I could write the function, but you'ld need an MM/1a squared to have it run
fast enough! :) OK, maybe I'm exaggerating here. With this game I have become
MUCH better at writing efficient code, but I still think the version of the

Not true--remember that for the most part, those routines are just layers
around the features windio provides, so that if you pried the lid off,
you'd see that all it did was fill up a buffer with a few bytes and then
write the buffer out where windio will see it and do it.

     C question
     From: ZOGSTER      To: ALL

Hi everyone.  In writing a simple C program I ran into a small problem.
I want to be able to use level 2's cursor controls 0x06,0x08,0x09,0x10
for right, left, up and down cursor positions.  I have been defining
those codes with C's #define statements, then outputing them with
the putchar(right), putchar(left), putchar(up), putchar(down) statements.
They all work fine except for down, which not only prints a linefeed but
also returns the cursor to the beginning of the next line (x=0)...
In Basic09 (and C) this happens with the Print chr$(9) and Printf("%c",down).
But in Basic09 I can avoid OS-9's editoring of the output by using
PUT#1,chr$(9).  How do I do this in C?

Ok... I have been trying to figure out how to use Write and think I have it
but there is a problem... here's the code that I am using to test write.

#include <stdio.h>
#define STDOUT 1
main()
{
printf("hello ");
write(STDOUT,"\x0a",1);
printf("This is a test\n\n");
}

When ran this program prints:

hello This is a test

test!dump reveals:

Addr   0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0 2 4 6 8 A C E

0010  2074 6573 740D 0D                         test..

Why is the linefeed being printed before the "hello "?

I want it to print:

hello

 Your problem here is mixing buffered and unbuffered output.  The printf()
 function writes to stdout with buffering while the write() function does a
 raw unbuffered write.

 Heres what happens:

 1. printf("hello "); puts the string "hello " in the output buffer.

 2. write(STDOUT,"\0x0a",1) sends a $0A directly to the device on stdout
    with no buffering.

 3. printf("This is a test\n\n"); adds teh string "This is a test" the
    output buffer and the \n\n cause it to be flushed to the screen.

 Since the buffer gets flushed _after_ the linefeed gets written things look
 out of sequence.

The solutio, of course, is to fflush(stdout); after the first printf(), and
before the write(). This fources a flushing of the output buffer before
you do the unbuffered write...

Eh?  On what ANSI calls a "line buffered stream," putchar('\n') will
definitely induce a writeln() call.  (For pre-ANSI, read "line buffered
stream" as "FILE that has the _SCF bit set in its flag field.")

Output is buffered to reduce system overhead...  You can do several
printf()'s or purchars()'s, but no system call (I$Write) will be done
until a newline is encountered, the buffer limit is reached, or you force
the buffer to be output...

I'm not surte on the specifics on Basic09's output calls, so cant really comment

on how they work...

This forces OS-9 to use I$Write instead... I think I got this trick oiriginally

throughput of sz quite a bit over all the previous versions.

 I think BacisO9 uses buffered I/O all the time.  It was designed as an
 application devlopment language whereas C was (originally) intended for
 writing operating system stuff.  C is a lot more powerful but Basic09 is
 really underappreciated when it comes to simpler applications.

 In fact, Basic09 would be a crackerjack language for small applcations under
 G-windows if it had the necessary gfx module and (maybe) a window editor
 designed to interface with Basic09.

 The solution I usually use for this sort of thing is to assemble the output
 in a program supplied buffer and write it out to the screen with a write()
 or writeln().  It's not that I have anything against the buffered calls but
 I've found that they tend to be pretty slow so I only use them for simple
 stuff.  Also if you need record locking the buffered calls are worse than
 useless <g>.

 Last time I checked putchar is #defined in stdio.h as:

    #define putchar(c)      putc(c,stdout)

 Unless you mess with the stdout._flag this will definitely generate a
 writeln() when the buffer is full, a '\n' is sent or call is made to
 fflush(stdout).  You can force use of write() if you set the _flag field to
 _RBF (I think) before performing any I/O on the path.  I'm not sure why
 anyone would want to so this to stdout but it could be useful for some SCF
 applications.

     Microware makes it big!
     From: FHOGG        To: ALL

The following are some excerpts from the 1/18/94 article in The
Wall Street Journal by Staff Reporter John J. Keller. Page B1.

"Little Microware Aims to Be a Multimedia Giant"

First it gives some background and then...

"Little-known Microware has just landed a coveted piece of
business. BELL ATLANTIC Corp., the regional Bell company, expects
to distribute an interactive service to 10 million households by
the turn of the century. It has placed orders for set-top boxes
from three suppliers. All the boxes, in turn, rely on Microwares
OS/9 software."

More background about what and who Microware is and then later in
the article...

"Microware's OS/9 went head-to-head with a prototype from
Microsoft called Modular Windows in a test by Bell Atlantic, says
Arthur Orduna, a Microware marketing manager. he brags that OS/9
beat its rival. A Microsoft spokeswoman doesn't dispute this
account."

There is more to the article that I quoted here but it is
important that Microware landed this contract for many reasons.
It assures Microwares place in the future and thru them ours. By
making OS/9 so visible it will make it easier for all of us to
justify OS/9 to new users. The influx of money into Microware
from this deal will likely help Microware provide new and
important software in the future for all of us. It will also
quiet those nay sayers who proclaim the demise of OS/9.

Whether it will directly help those of us in the market now is yet
to be seen. However in my mind this deal can only help to expand
the market for OS/9 and therefore the slice of the pie that each
vendor has can only increase.

All in all this is a milestone for Microware and I congratulate
all of those who worked long and hard to put this deal together.

A hearty WELL DONE!

Sculptor is the MOST powerful 4th generation DB language available for

The language is similar in syntax to BASIC, so learning it is not too

drawback is there are no other documentation to help explain some of

  Ok, mistake noted ;-)
I recommend the 9meg upgrade. It makes programming so much easier. Those
errant pointer problems have so much more room to hide. ;-)

  Yea, the problem only showed it when you would try to use any of the
save functions.

     Ghostscript
     From: JOHNREED     To: ALL

The Epson drivers in the latest ghostscript ver 2.6.1 and
gs2 uploads seem to be screwed up - I blew it.  DeskJet
drivers and the new KWindows color display are OK.  A
new version will be uploaded as soon as I figure it out.
see messages to/from JEJONES about xmode /p and gs2.

     Monochrome
     From: REVWCP       To: ALL

Dear Friends:
I haveVM-2 Tandy Monochrome Monitor hooked up to one of our COCO3.  I know
that CC3io could be patched to boot up in RGB mode (see msg 12709) Does anyone
know of a patch that could set it to Monomode, without using montype?  It
is illegible when it first boots up.  Eventually it turns out okay.  I am
running Multivue on it so the control-e kind of messes things up a little.
While we are on the subject, I also would like to patch one system to come
up on a composite monitor...those of you who make it to Chicago this fest
will get to see our Monastery's "dream machine"...A COCO3 using a Northern
Telcom Display phone as a terminal/Composite Monitor/XT keyboard through a
Puppo adapter.  This thing is really slick.  Maybe this old monk is being
guilty of the sin of pride, but this one is impressive.

So any help in those patches will be greatly appreciated.
With all best wishes,
Brother Jeremy, CSJW
OS9 Users Group Treasurer

     spreadsheet formulae
     From: ROYBUR       To: ALL

 i know some of you will think i should post this plea in the PC SIG since
 the question i have involves LOTUS 1-2-3 specifically. (i'm going to try to
 simulate the situation with SC, later today, btw.) my boss asked me to try to
 create a "timing" spreadsheet. most of it is pretty simple, just grind out
 the number of shifts needed to produce a certain amount of product and then
 convert no. of shifts to production days. i have, as user inputs, shifts/week,
 working days/week and of course some other things to calculate production
 days, but those aren't relevant to my question.
 suppose that in cell C9 is shifts/week, in D9 is workdays/week and in E9 is
 no. of days to produce the product. he/i want to convert that last number to
 a calendar date. Lotus's date functions work with serial date numbers such
 that day #1 is Jan.01,1900. i _almost_ get it to work with this thing:
 "@if(@mod(e9,d9)>0,7*@int(e9/d9)+@mod(e9,d9)+7-d9+@now,7*@int(e9/d9)+@now)"
 the problem being that sometimes the calendar date is off by a day. does
 anybody know of a better way, or a different approach? i'd ask in the PC sig
 but but i _know_ there are some honest-to-god programmers in _this_ sig! <g>
 i'll keep pluggin' at it - i have an idea that i need to do more testing in
 the part between the commas - but i won't get back to the machine to try
 anything until monday at the soonest. thanx for listenin'! 8*)........roy

Did anyone else see the article about Microware and the new information
superhighway in Tuesday's "Wall Street Journal"?  They're on top of page B1
with an description of how OS-9 beat "modualar windows" from Microsoft for
use in several vendor's interactive TV systems.  Pretty neat to see; even
had a sketch of Ken Kaplan!
