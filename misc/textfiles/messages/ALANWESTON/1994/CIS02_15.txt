Brother Jeremy,

I have a CoCo3 with 512K, Puppo keyboard adapter, Disto HD interface with a 10M
SASI drive, Sardis no-halt floppy controller with one 5 1/4 and one 3 1/2 drive
and a Comm-4 serial interface.  Serial devices include an X10 controller, a
Star NX-1000 printer and my MM/1.  I've purchased, but not yet installed, a
Disto 2M upgrade, 6309 and a KenTon HD interface that will inherit my MM/1 SCSI
drive when I replace it with a larger one.

I use my CoCo not only for InfoXpress development, but also for a lot of my
personal record keeping using a variety of software, and even though I have an
MM/1, and at some point plan on purchasing a DOS machine, I intend to keep my
CoCo for quite a while.

I hope that the UG can manage to acquire the upgrade, as well as the other
system parts, such as SBF.  I've already told Carl that I would be happy to
help.  Does anyone know if NFM was ever developed for the CoCo? A serial NFM
system for the CoCo would be awesome!

I plan to continue support for CoCo InfoXpress, it has been very difficult to
implement so much in such a small address space, but I've managed so far.  Once
I get my 2M and 6309 installed, I plan on optimizing InfoXpress to take
advantage of additional memory, and some of the 6309 capabilities.

Dear Brother Jeremy,

I have not really been aware of the activities of the OS-9 user group, having
left the OS-9 scene years ago.   I still own (and occasionally use) a SSB
Chieftain with two 5.25" and 64K.  At the time (some 10 years ago) I used it to
develop some control software, but abondoned it when it was no longer
mainstream (the lack of support from Microware didn't help either).

I would be very interested in getting back into OS9, especially if source code
is availabe, and would appreciate more details of the User Group's activities.

I think I remember hearing that a composite monitor from an Apple would work
with a CoCo.  I've acquired an Apple monitor from I think a IIe.  It's labeled
RGB model no. A9M0308 and has a 15 pin female connector.  Can I use this with
the CoCo ?  Does any one have the pinout hack for it ?

Thanks

In the old days, I used to get 103's if I used the wrong cio-traphandler. This

Nope, not yet.  Been working on systems where people are dead until I get their
boards back.  I'll be doing yours next and getting it out. Whew!  Too much to

Sb: Screen Fix
Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: All

To aid in the on-going problem with some folks running the SCREEN package I
posted awhile ago, I had a look at a problem which was causing my system to
lock from time to time...specifically when I sent a XOFF from the keyboard. The
problem is in the main file, screen.c, in the function my_gs_rdy(). The ptyman
returns a -1 when no keys are ready (as per OS9 requirements). And when screen
sees this, it stops, assuming an error. Following is a replacement for the
offending module. Hope it helps...

my_gs_rdy(path) {
        int i;

        i=_gs_rdy(path);

        if(i<0)
        {
                /* I added the test for a 246 (not rdy) here. OS9 will returns
                        a -1 to _gs_rdy() if there are no chars avaiable on the
                        input path...not a fatal error! [bvdp]
                */
                if(errno!=246)
                {
                        Msg(0, "Got %d [err %d] from a _gs_rdy()",i,errno);
                        while(1);       /* not sure if this is best.... */
                }
                i=0;
        }

        return i; }

Sb: #Printer Problems
Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: All

Can one of the hardware, expert types help me out? I am having some very
frustrating experiences in getting my computers to work with a printer switch I
recently purchased... All I'm trying to do is to get two computers to share one
printer...surely not a difficult task! Here is the hardware:

    Printer - Epson Action Laser II with Parallel interface
    Switch - Agiler 4-in, 1-out auto selecting switch,
             power apparently from the printer???
    Print Buffer - 128K Microfazer parallel-parallel,
                   power from a remote 'cube'
    Computer #1 - MM/1 extended
    Computer #2 - MVME 147S-1 (68030)

I have determined that the following setups work:

    MM/1 --> Printer
    MM/1 --> Buffer --> Printer

    MVME --> Printer
    MVME --> Switch --> Printer
    MVME --> Buffer --> Switch --> Printer

The following configurations do not work:

    MM/1 --> Switch --> Printer

This seems to skip every other, or more, character. Apparently this is caused
by the low logic levels on the MM/1....So, I put the buffer on the circuit.

    MM/1 --> Buffer --> Switch --> Printer

With this setup the buffer shows "ERROR" and nothing gets printed.

This doesn't appear to make a lot of sense. After all, the buffer should appear
as a printer to the switch and any level problems should be between the MM/1
and the buffer. The other configurations indicate to me that the switch and the
buffer are okay.

Any ideas?

What sort of switch are you using?  A parallel or serial switch?  Some serial
switchs doen't have all 25 lines.  Either that or a cable is bad.

The switch has 4 parallel inputs and 1 parallel output. Course, in true logic,
all the plugs on the switch are DB-25's. Can't see it being a cable problem
since I am using the same cable between the buffer and the switch in both
cases; and the same cable between the switch and the printer. All that changes,
cable-wise, is the one between the computers and the buffer or switch (the VME
has a centronics output, the mm/1 has a DB-25).

Bob,
        I'm not exactly a hardware expert, but I have some experience in this
area that I can pass along.  I used to have two 25-pin switches set up to
switch either the DeskJet-500 or the Epson-24pin to the MM/1 or the "386"
without moving cables.  Since installing the 68340 in the MM/1, I can still use
the switch boxes or a printer buffer I borrowed with the DeskJet, but the ONLY
way I can print on the Epson with the MM/1 is a direct 6-foot cable.

A longer cable, any kind of switch or buffer, (and maybe a full moon) and the
Epson prints trash.  Slowing the CPU speed to 8 megs did not help.  Cussing at
it in three languages didn't do much either.  Now, the "386" has the Epson and
the MM/1 has the DeskJet.  If I want to change it, I have to move cables.

Some time ago I asked for input on what needed to be fixed in sh.  No I am not
on the verge if workin on it ...  But one of the complaints was the lack of
something equivalent to the profile command of shell.  Well, surprise,
surprise.  There is a thing called the dot command (that all good *nix guys
knew about but didn't tell us) that does what is desired.  That is:
  $ scriptfile     will fork a copy of sh to process 'scriptfile'.
  $ . scriptfile   will process 'scriptfile' in the current sh.
That is dot space scriptfile.

Feel free to pass this folklore to any and all who also use sh!

Carl, were you working on some "docs" for sh? For a non-*inx guy this would be
even more useful than any possible fixes. Hmmm, maybe I should buy, beg, borrow
or steal a copy of "sh for Dummies"...
