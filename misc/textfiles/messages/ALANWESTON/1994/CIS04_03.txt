Announcing! X10 Master Control Program for OSK and KWindows!

Features:

Dual user selectable interfaces. One is the "standard" K-Windows Menu Style
interface. It has a menu bar of functions functions and a "toolbar" of quick
action buttons. The other interface is in a "popup" style window which is "on
top of" the window it was created on and only contains buttons for quick
action. It is movable and resizable.

With the single click of your mouse you can now turn a light on or off. With an
additional mouse drag of a slide bar you can dim a light to any of 16 discrete
levels. With just a few more mouse clicks these actions can be performed on up
to 16 remote modules at the same time. With menu bar functions you can access
all modules available from you X10 Powerhouse Controller, a total of 256
different remote modules, with direct commands which are executed immediately
or with programmed events which occur at the date, day and time you specify.

Store pre-programmed commands to turn units on or off or dimmed on any date and
time or on repetative times, like at 4PM every Tuesday. You can even have the
X10 vary the time just slightly each repetition to give would be robbers the
illusion of non-computer control.

You can save your configuration of known modules and current X10 program memory
to a disk file for later recovery after a power failure and you were caught
without a good battery! Access all other functions on the X10 like, display
current base house code, display current date and time and even run an X10
diagnostic on the X10 controller via other menu bar functions, all using full
mouse for input. Remote Module Identification is one of the only times you need
to touch your keyboard while using the X10 Master Control Program from
ColorSystems!

X10 Master Control Program will be available for delivery at the upcoming
Chicago CoCoFest at a special introductory price. After the 'fest it will be
available for mail order for a slightly higher cost.


Features of the X10 Powerhouse Controller:

Access remote modules which are fully compatable with the line of "Plug 'n'
Power" modules available at Radio Shack.

Eight on/off rocker switches control units 1-8 for the currently selected base
housecode.

Access up to 256 modules with one controller. (Sixteen units for sixteen
housecodes, access must be either with computer interface or pre-programmed
event to act on any module outside the range of the keypad or in a housecode
different from the controller's current base housecode.)

Store up to 128 pre-programmed events.

Once programmed, may be detached from the computer, but while connected,
pre-programmed events and events initiated via the on board rocker switches are
reported back to the computer interface.



At Chicago I will have a limited supply of brand new X10 controllers and
assorted Plug 'n' Power modules and will be offering them at a special price
when purchased with the X10 Master Control Program.


If you would like to get pricing and ordering information just drop me a line
in private Email.

Sounds really neat!

So what does the normal OSK interface look like? Command line only? Full screen
text mode?

So when will the G-Windows version be available?

The initial version might have (if I have time) command line access only to
rudimentary functions of the X10.

Sb: #FTP problems
Fm: roy harrell 72520,1636
To: ALL

        We have a tcp/ip network consisting of a Force CPU30 box running OS9
2.4, an OS2 box running 2.1 and an HP Integra system running SCOUs Xenix. In
addition, we periodically attempt to tie into a LANtastic network of seven
pcUs, one of which has ArtisoftUs tcp/ip package. When separate both the tcp/ip
and LANtastic nets appear to work ok. When connected, things may run smooth for
a week or so with ftp and telnet services working properly across the various
platforms. Eventually however, sparks will fly, packet collisions detected on
the LANtastic net go through the roof and our periodic, background ftp tasks
originating on the Force hang during execution even though you can successfully
ftp in the foreground from the OS9 shell.


        We are prepared to sever the LANtastic connection in order to restore
network integrity which will, in most likelihood, eliminate our OS9 ftp
problems. Regardless, I would like a better understanding of the problem. Our
ftp tasks are periodically initiated from a C program with a system call
similar to the following:


#define FTP_TRANS R/dd/internet/ftp_tranpsS

I

I

I

                system(FTP_TRANPS);


The ftp_tranps file contains the following:


ftp -nv </dd/internet/tcpscript1 >-/dd/internet/output.ftp >>-


The tcpscript1 file contains the following:


open hphost

user opus meadow

lcd /dd/internet

append produxion.new

bye



When the system is working properly the data are transferred, the errors.ftp
file is null, and output.ftp contains the following:


Not connected.

When the ftp task hangs the output.ftp file remains open and contains:

ftp> 331 Password required for opus.


<Error #000:003>


The Error #000:003 message originates after I <CTRL>C to break out of the list
output.ftp command. The procs list entry for the ftp task is:


Id PId Aging   F$calls I$calls Last      Read Written Module & I/O

22  21   250         7      47 SetStt     309     498 ftp <dd >dd >>dd


or, more typically,


Id PId Aging   F$calls I$calls Last      Read Written Module & I/O

22  20   250         5      17 Read       128     341 ftp <dd >dd >>dd


It is interesting that, by killing this ftp task, our data is transferred and
the system runs normally until this happens again.



IUd appreciate if someone could explain whatUs going on here. One last note,
the IP addresses all begin with 127 (eg, 127.1.1.1, 127.1.1.2 and 127.1.1.3).
Could this be part of the problem?

A bit odd... typically collisions are an issue for the hardware/firmware to
resolve... Are you sure that one of the interfaces isn't going into 'spew'

I suspect the LANtastic machine hurls from time to time. Even so, why would
this cause the os9 ftp task to lock?

Shouldn't lock - but that may be the cause of the excess collisions... And
don't go thinking that the Microware os9 TCP/IP is rock solid... It;s a minimal
implementation, really. They don't support socket optionsm\, for instance...

Fm: Frank Hogg of FHL 70310,317
To: all

                      NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCMENT

      MONTOR MOUNTED RECHARAGEABLE MAGNETIC FLOPPY DISK HOLDER

                              4/1/94

                                THE

                            "DISK-MAG"

 After 3 years in development the DISK-MAG will be available soon
 to solve the common annoying problem of misplacing floppy disks
 and risking possible damage. The DISK-MAG is placed on the side
 on the computer monitor with velcro tape. The DISK-MAG is
 capable of holding six 5 1/4" floppy disks or three 3.5" floppy
 disks. Multiple DISK-MAGs may be used for those needing larger
 capacity. The DISK-MAGs secret is the incredible holding power of
 the rechargeable magnet made of a special material that gets
 its recharge from the automatic degaussing coil that is in all
 color monitors. This coil is activated at power down and
 normally demagnetizes the monitors metal dot screen. The
 DISK-MAGs special reverse magnet becomes magnetized by this coil
 which is the reverse of what common magnets do. This reverse
 magnetism is then filtered thru our patented circuitry and powers
 the DISK-MAG. Normally a magnet would erase the contents of a
 disk but the DISK-MAGs reverse rechargeable magnet actually
 INCREASES the data integrity of the disk*. Therefore use of the
 DISK-MAG will help insure against data loss while being a
 convenient place to hold your disks.

 We are researching ways of using this technology to insure
 against data loss in tape and hard disk use. In addition we are
 looking into using the technology to recover data inadvertently
 lost thru normal deleting of files etc. Other possible uses are
 restoring old audio tapes.

 Price and availability will be announced soon.

 *The DISK-MAG circuity only attracts the positive magnetic pulse
 or binary '1' in the case of computer data. By attracting the positive
 pulse it increases the power or size of the pulse thereby increasing
 data integrity. The circuit is fairly simple for binary data which is
 1's and 0's. Analog data requires a more sophisticated circuit and
 more research before we can announce a product using this technology.

Can you tell me where to find, or upload, your text on the type variable in
xmode and how its settings effect the parity and stop bits?  I can't seem to
find that information anywhere.

I'm trying to interface a barcode scanner and the unit has no docs on the
serial interface.  I can get garbage at 1200 baud, so I expect I need to change
the number of stop bits and/or the parity and can't figure out how to do this
with xmode.

Thanks for your help.

This is typed online, but looks right.  I notice it isn't in the manuals - you

If you can't find the parity info, try using moded. Go into edit mode and
advance down to the parity field and then enter a ??. You'll get a nice little
