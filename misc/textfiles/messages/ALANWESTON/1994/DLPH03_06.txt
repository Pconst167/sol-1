   Well, it's definitly something in the windowing codes (I think). I am also
sending a short test program called 'wintest'. Try running that on a
freshly opened window. It creates a button, then a sub-window, and then does
a 'change working area' to create a view-port. After that it prints 'done'
near the bottom of the screen and exits. Let me know where it fails. It
shouldn't clear the screen if it does create an error.

   Thanks in advance for the info! Oh! BTW what version of windio are you
running?? I know it won't work with 41 or lower, but, it does with 47 and
48. I don't have any of the in betweens.

     MM/1A Screen Problems
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

I found the problem with dots and missing bits appearing on the screen
when scrolling while connected at 38400 baud.  I set my input and ouput
buffers on the /t3 device descriptor to 256 bytes each.  This fixed the
problem.

I only have one other problem:  The Logitech mouse I am using does not
work properly.  When I move it, I only see the mouse cursor some of the
time, and then, it randomly moves across the screen in an uncoordinated
fashion.  Also, the screen changes to another window at times.

Above is the ident output of the mouse driver.  Can someone tell me
what mice are compatible with the MM/1?  I looked at msdrv with
dED and it does contain the address of the port which I'm connected.

Just curious, when you resized the /t3 buffers, did you increase
them to 256 or decrease them to 256?

I *increasd* them.  Actually the input buffer was 20 characters and the
output buffer was 80.  For good measure, I kicked both buffers up to
1024 characters.  No problems have occurred since.

Boisy, save me some research time. I was looking at my /tn modules to
see about increasing the buffer sizes for them, but moded does not indicate
a field identfied as a buffer size. Which field is it? Can I change this
with moded? If I need to change it with dEd, what is the offset and
field size?

THANKS!!

sounds like your have an old copy of the moded.fields file... there
should have been an updated version that was with the new serial drivers.
Also.. there are two versions of moded on the MM/1 distribution disks...
You want the one with the higher editions number (think it is 15, and was on
the 3 meg boot disk)
But, even with 1024 byte buffers, AND having maxcount set to 1024 on the
hard drive descriptors, I STILL have receive problems... mostly, they only
occure when a window scrolls, or flipping rapidly through windows... so, it is
more of a problem is the windoing code if you ask me...

Hi Zack,

On my descriptors, the offset is at $70.  The first word is the input
buffer and the second word is the output buffer size in bytes.

The offset is specified by the M$DevCon.  At offset $3C is a word
which points to the offset within the module where special device
configuration info can be placed.  If the word at offset $3C is not
$70, then the input/output buffer fields are at the location in $3C.w

I changed the fields to be $0400 each (1K buffer size on input and
output).

Good luck.

 I had a file on this from way back when. Have to look
it back up- it seems grfint worked fine, windint short of gshell1.24a bomber o
on white screen, and windint latest moves thru a white screen on startup-
looks weird but recovers. (current windint $3a6033)

        Most Tandy games use vdgint- this is in whatever boot KQ3 uses
so many games will run so long as you use the KQ3 hard drive boot. Flight
Simulator has
2 special modules, just like KQ3 does. These are more work- they have to be in
boot.
        MultiVue is easiest to live with when it's part of the main system.
If windint is in os9boot (the extra w are optional), that system will run MVue
from the hard drive if the MVue disk is simply dsaved to the hard drive. Forget
Tandy's install- if windint replaces grfint MultiVue is 'installed'- it will
run from any chd/chx- with exception of env.sys, which has to be
in /dd/sys (this is probably /h0/sys anyway).

        Dennis,
        Are you sure about that? I haven't actually installed my HIO
yet but recall it's main feature is that you DO NOT format the hard drive,
rather install a series of decb disk size files on the fly, to your otherwise
OS9 hard disk. There are no partitions- thats RGB dos, methinks.

        HyperIO is a bit different from the most common way to split a hard driv
e.
Normally, a drive is split into partitions, with each opsys getting one.
HyperIO gives basic the smarts to borrow space on the OS9 hard drive you have
so painstakingly set up- please dont format it at any level.
        If you get to awful stuck give me a call (I have ver 2.0).
Perhaps we can work it out.

os-9 puts its DIR stuff in the root sector track one..where rsdos puts it at
track 18.....you DO low format FIRST...THEN format the drive to the OS-9
format,at that time the OS-9 root Dir is setup on the drive..the Rsdos is
already setup for basic.....The formater Just ADDS the Os9 ROOT.....
OS-9 is the partitioned part! GOT IT!<grin>

IF it is a new drive YOU DO LOW FORMAT it! I have HyperIO as well ..The
DISTO version!If it is already formated to OS-9,and has stuff on it,you is
right!from what I gleaned from his post,it seemed to me it was a new drive
he was using!

BTW, Carl's latest version is supposed to be 1.9 and Thomas will be receiving
it for porting as noted in above message.  So the future will bring the
