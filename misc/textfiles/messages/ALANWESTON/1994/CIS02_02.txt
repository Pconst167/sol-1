'fraid I'm not going to be of much help as my interests lie with the 6809 and
68070 chips.

But that's not to say others in the forum won't jump in with information.

Welcome aboard!

Hannu,

There are people out here, but apparently there aren't many who have used the
cross compiler. Is this a Microware product? Have you tried Microware product
support? They don't frequent this forum, or CompuServe, for that matter, so
they probably won't respond here.

One thing that you might try, which would help narrow the problem down a
little, is to merge some of those .R files together. If the problem is with too
many files, this would be a workaround. Not knowing how large these .R files
are, the problem could also be that one of the .R files is too large or that
the combination of all the .R files is too large for the linker to keep track
of. You might also check to make sure that one of the .R files didn't get
corrupted somehow.

Don't know why a NFS solution should be cleaner ...
NeWLink uses a server NLM in the Novell Server just as Novell itself for the
Mac clients. At the OS-9 systems, NeWLink needs much less resources than
NFS/TCPIP and runs much faster (>450 kBytes netto with new machines!). Besides,
it supports the most of the common RBF utilites (dsave, dir, fsave ....). Thus,
NeWLink makes access to the Novell Netware quite transparent and effective.
You are right, NFS is interesting in multi-platform environments, but for pure
OS-9/Novell systems, NeWLink is a good choice.
