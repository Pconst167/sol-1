Dear Friends: While visiting with RICKULAND of Conect fame, we were discussing
what was now the minimum requirement for a COCO OS9 system.  For example, at
CSJW we have:
     1. A 2meg COCO 3 with a 6309, 5-1/4 and 3-1/2 drives, 20 meg
        harddrive, SC 2 with 4-in-1.
     2. A 512k COCO 3 with 6309, 2 5-1/4 drives in a Tandy 2000
        Case with an st252n with Disto SC-2 and 4-in-1.
     3. A 512k COCO 3 with 6809, 3 Tandy 5-1/4 80 track dsdd,
        Mulitpak, a Disto MEB with HardDisk Controller, two
        10 meg Bernoulli Drives, and soon a Tallgrass Tape Backup
        Unit.
     4. A Northern Telcom DisplayPhone being used as a terminal
        on the COCO/2000 box.
     5. EARS, the Voice and various esoteric hardware. I think it is clear that
the 6309 is now basic operating standard.  512k minimum with 2 megs desirable.
We have both Powerboost and Nitros9.  Obviously, RS232 packs, etc. are also
required equipement.  I would like to know what hardware you are running.  This
is for several reasons:
     1.  What is being used so that programmers could write for
         this hardware.
     2.  So that the hardware vendors would know what hardware is
         still needed.

     3.  What software you would like to see.  Obviously there
         are many of us in the 6809/os9 world who still want to
         see the Level 2 upgrade released.  This is a mandatory
         project for the Users Group to undertake.
     4.  The SBF module from Microware.  It was written for 6809,
         but never released.  We should negotiate with with
         MicroWare to get any unreleased 6809 specific modules.
     5.  Certain RSDOS progras to be ported to 6809/OS9. Of course it should be
noted that 6809 and 6309 should be considered interchangable as far as need.
While OSK is the future, OS9 (6809,6309) is still a present reality and should
not be abandoned.  To do so would leave little reason for the 6809ers to
support the User Group.  Please take a few moments to respond to the questions
raised in this posting, and feel free to post it where-ever you wish.  If you
would like, a postcard to:
     Brother Jeremy, CSJW
     Box 1903
     Racine, WI 53401 with you opinions would be very helpful.  The views
expressed in this posting are not neccessarily those of the User Group, and I
take full responsibility for them.  Please respond.  We need a large amount of
replies if we are to get any meaningful guidance.

With all best wishes, Brother Jeremy, CSJW OS9 User Group Treasurer

Hi Bob, The screen program still doesn't work right. I get error 103's
sometimes and when I do a ctrl-w on a screen it gives a rdy -1 message and
freezes. Could there be a problem running on 68000's with the bus errors? That
could explain why forked programs crash also.

Thanks, Bob

Damned if I know...I do know that if I do a crl-w on my MVME system I get the
same error message. Hmmm, do you have XON/OFF enabled? Try turning it off? I
think the problem is with the ptyman stuff, not screen. Someone out there what
to wade though that? However, I do use screen quite often on my MVME and so
long as I don't do any xon/off stuff it all works fine. The system has SSM and
I've had upto 10 virtual terminals running a variety of programs including
BASIC, Ephem and ved.

 Mark of Dirt Cheap Computer Stuff has a CD-ROM that he sells that comes
 with the drivers. Joel Hegberg of Sub-Etha is working on a fax program
 for OS9/68000.

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

If some MM/1 users are still having problems accessing the printer port due to
the unbuffered parallel port on the mm/1...you might want to try putting a
print buffer between the computer and printer. I just picked one up from Terry
Laraway. He is selling these surplus units for around $50.00 (I think). He has
various models...some are parallel to parallel, others serial to parallel (good
for a coco). The memory on them varies between 64 and 512K. Terry can be
contacted at:

I see you took my advice.  Glad it worked for you!

Yes, I did take your advice. Thanks. However, I still don't know if it works
with the printer switch...the switch has db-25 inputs and the buffer box is
hardwired with a centronics cable. Rather than re-wiring I just ordered a db25
to centronics converter...but it isn't here yet.

BTW, did you send my board back yet?

I did a search of database # 12 for "BSPLT68" could not find it. Could you

Hi all,

I was wondering how OS/9 compares to pSOS. Any opinions out there?
