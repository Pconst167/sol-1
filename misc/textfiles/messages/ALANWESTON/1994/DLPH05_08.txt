Absolutely! Magic maximum size for a merged module is n*8K - 1024 bytes,
where n is some number.

What I used to do on my CoCo was to merge together groups of the commonly
used CMDS together in 8K chunks and would load them at startup.

If you do an ident of the Shell that comes on the OS-9 System Master disk,
you'll find several of the more commonly used CMDS merged onto the end of
it.

Yep, I have several merged modules that I use at startup. With grfdrv I
have 10, shell has 7 boarders, runb has 9 tagalongs. I figure I could get
from 6 to 10 good utils with supercomm and the same with Dynastar by
merging to the next 8k border. These are all loaded at startup and are
running before startup finishes. Oh, Presto Partner too. I timed the
whole thing and it takes two minutes from DOS till startup finishes.
this is with my HD of course. If I tried it from floppy, it would
probably take 5 minutes. Thanx for the help, Charlie

Correction on the time it takes to boot my system, 1:45 from DOS to prompt
and that also includes merging fonts and cursors, putting up a pretty
screen and a few other minor items. Not bad for a 8 year old machine
running at 2mghz. Imagine what a 33mghz coco could do. Later Charlie

     Partgen: split your HD
     From: JWILKERSON   To: ALL

   I used partgen to try to get my hard drive to go into 2 drives.... However
the patch fot my version of BBFHdisk didn't work.  Seems that my version must
be a later version than whapartgen package can handle...

here is the ident for my bbfhdisk....


Header for:  BBFhdisk
Module size: $06B6    #1718

Dev Dvr mod, 6809 obj, re-en, R/O


    I would like to split my HD into 2 drives.... it'd make accounting for
stuff sooo much easier...

Any ideas?

Gee, a mind is a terrible thing to lose! Mine that is! No, and at the moment,
I'm tied up with 3 other projects. #1 being the ramdisk, I'm trying to get
rid of the 504k limit, and it will be pretty much a "from scratch" effort
when its done. But to see what its doing, I need a working os9p4, and the
currant NITROS9 version is slightly broken, as in not reporting the stack
value correctly. So thats project #2, with a +127 priority. Then I bought
the missus (yeah, get him) an Amiga 2000-020 the other day, and its hard
drive and controller are both junk. Can't get another drive into it before
late next week since the UPS runs that slow around here, and alltho it
boots from the existing drive, I have to give it a whap on a corner, sideways
so's the heads will release from the disk and it can get started. The
existing controller, an A-2090, has provisions for 2 mfm drives. I have NO
setup info on it and can't seem to get it to access a 2nd drive to even
format it. Next stop,, Amiga forum to ask about that Jurrasic controller.
So don't worry about it just yet Merv, and I'll get back when I have time
to attack it again.
Cheers, Gene

Well, I may have to give it a try.  I have just sent in my order for a
System 5 and of course will be on the lookout for a good telecom program.
'Course my Delphi/CIS msg stuff will be handled by "IX".

BTW...  is there any t'com support for something like XModem-G or some
non-error-correcting protocol?  I want to use V.42bis or '32, but as
everyone has written, I found out that all the error-correcting protocols
are actually slower with this turned on.  I wanna go hi-tech with this <G>

Hey, thanks for your reference to "slowio".  I've heard of it, but never did
get it to use.  OSTerm is a pretty nice app, could use a touch-up or two.
One thing I could never get it to do was send CTRL-chrs correctly.  Tried
to get it to send CTRL-C for CIS logon and never did work.  Learn produced
a string "\3c" (I think) but didn't work.  Aside from this and maybe another
or two, it is really neat.

If you refer to my rep to KSCALE's rep to your msg, I have a System 5 on order
so may not be pursuing my coco stuff as avidly, bad as I hate to leave it.
I hope to do some more with my coco, but I figure that OSK will occupy most
of my time.

WHERE ARE THEY?  Everywhere I go, here, on our local netted bbs, etc. the

BTW. I captured a post last night.. haven't had the chance to check its
validity yet, but it stated that the May 5 bill goes MUCH MUCH farther than
the proponents claim. It:

1) contrary to their claim that it will not affect weapons already out there,
 it makes the "manufacture, sale, or POSSESION of such weapon illegal.

2) handguns weighing more than 50 oz unloaded will be illegal

3) the attorney general shall have the authority to add any weapon to the
   list that he/she/it deems necessary (without consulting with anyone).

I have not checked this out yet, however, this surprised me, if it is true.

This is what I have said all along.   They may have been guilt, but unless
it could have been established that some foul play with or on the part of
the first jury had occurred, that should have been it.  It is SUPPOSED to
be one of our constitutional rights to not have to face a condition of
double jeopardy.

You really need to get "out" more. According to national public opinion
polls, a majority of Americans favor handgun control. Even more than that
favor some kind of gun control legislation, such as the ban on assault
weapons.

 > 1) contrary to their claim that it will not affect weapons already out
 > there, it makes the "manufacture, sale, or POSSESION of such weapon
 > illegal.

I do not think this is the case. It is my impression that the possesion
clause is intended to apply to possesion of assault weapons which were
obtained AFTER the law is in effect.

 > 2) handguns weighing more than 50 oz unloaded will be illegal

I don't have a problem with that.

 > 3) the attorney general shall have the authority to add any weapon to the
 > list that he/she/it deems necessary (without consulting with anyone).

And I really doubt the validity of that claim as well.

 > I have not checked this out yet, however, this surprised me, if it is
 > true.

It would surprise me if they were true, except for item #2.

And I do not. Congress does not have the right to pass any law which
supercedes a Constitutional Amendment. If the Second Amendment is ever
repealed outright, it will be by the People, not Congress.

RE: Handgun oger 50oz being illegal.

This would make many high quality target pistols illegal. The whole ide
of gun control is a joke... It takes guns outa the hands of law abideing
citizens. It has no effect on criminals. They will still get "illegal" guns/
weapons, by the same illegal means that they usually use.

I have just uploaded a port for the `gnuplot' program for
the MM/1 (and other OSK machines, I hope).

The latest version I have seen is 3.5.  This port is for
version 3.2.

It is based on an OSK port by Chris Thewalt.  I
changed a few things that the MM/1 complained about and
added a Kwindows display.  See docs for copyright and
distribution info.

Although it is called "gnuplot", and is distributed with
other GNU software, it is not GNU/FSF material.  It IS
copyrighted, and freely distributable.  Again, see docs
for complete information.

Using simple commands, gnuplot will plot anything from
a simple line on a chart to a complex 3D surface.  Output
can be directed to any one of several printer types or
to a Postscript or Latex file (or device).

Even if you have no practical use for it, it is fun to
watch it work.
