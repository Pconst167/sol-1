Bingo. When using AciaPak and T2, you need to have the device in slot one
of the MPI. Aciapak sets the MPI to send through interupts *only* from slo
one. This is why you're missing so many chars. The packs interupts aren't
getting through. You're only getting what is caught during the 60hz clock
IRQ scan.
 There is a hardware hack to get around this, but it is only needed if you
want to run more than one IRQ driven device at a time. For now, just move
the pack.

  While on the subject, there is one more thing you'll run in to. With the
stock clock and Aciapak, the mod-pak will appear to lock up on occasion.
SAcia and Ed #9 clock were written to fix this. So get them installed
soonest. :>
   Oh, in the mean time, if it locks, hit another window and do a "dir" on
a floppy drive. IT isn't the pak itself locked, it's the IRQ logic in the
GIME chip. Accessing a floppy will shake it free on motor off. Kludgy, but
it will keep you rolling.

Yes, I've been using "lha2.11b", I'm Nitro'd, no problems with it. Matthew's lzh

now is another problem, but it still works, you just have to feed it files it
made. Even tho the filename extension is the same, the headers used aren't so
they don't like each others output. I wish we had defined a new ext for the name

and that would ahve fixed a LOT of Matts lzh probs.

  Yes,  you are correct about setting about the descriptors for another slot.
Another you have to do is rename the driver and make the new descriptors use
that driver.  The driver itself won't handle to interfaces.  I've done it this
way in the past.
  I'm just not able to do it with an older interface.

Well...I'm here in the Land of Pig, trying to get ready, and hoping that
things don't turn out on the road like they did last time I rode back from
the Chicago area.  That afternoon, a state trooper pulled us over.  We
wondered whether a tail light had gone out, until she walked up and told
us she was headed down the road to check out a report of a tornado, and
we'd better be ready to pull over and jump in the ditch.

"Yes, *ma'am*," we said.

We were at a point at which there wasn't much but road, so we didn't have
much choice save to drive on and look to see whether the cars approaching
from the other direction were on the ground.

We will arrive real late Thursday (or early Friday)
to give Christie more time to haul me into Chicago
to see museums, dolphins & whales, and other tourist-type
stuff.  Christie tolerates computers, but she is not
especially fond of them.  Her only sign of interest in

(honest!).

it would cost me $70 or more for that 20 meg so I think I will go across

Sorry to bother you but I bought my 20 meg mfm seagate for $1 a meg.The
used computer store across town has a little higher prices but worth the

int kill(pid,sigcode) where pid is an int and sigcode is a short.  conventional
meanings of sigcode are found in Signal.h  returns -1 if an error occurs,
with the appropriate error in errno.  If the PID is zero, the superuser can
send a signal to all processes.

Gee...I didn't know anybody even remembered it any more.  I have it, and I'll
upload it.  (It was a port I did of a C Users Group program--I sped it up,
at the expense of internal fragmentation, and made the syntax more like Unix
ed.  Oh, yeah...I added the ability to escape to a shell; CP/M, of course,
didn't allow that sort of thing.)  The archive I'll upload will include a
list of things that really ought to be done to the program; if you have the
inclination to improve it, I expect that people will appreciate it; it
still has some uses, especially in shell scripts and the like.

     Panasonic Printer
     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL

 Ok here's the latest with my Serial to Parralell converter adventure. Make
 that, the Blue Streak Ultima. A while back, on a few occasions I asked
 whether the power required on pin 18 to run the ultima was supplied on
 Panasonic printers, and so far everyone has said no. Recently my folks got
 a new 486 for the house and my mother got an HP 560 Deskjet for her hair
 Salon so she print out color envelopes and such. They brought the
 Panasonic home for the new computer, so I decided it would be a good time
 to test for myself, since it is now at the house :-) This is the model K
 KX-P1123(24 pin) btw. I hooked it up to the ultima and powered it up, and it
 actually APPEARS to be getting power. When I type 'dir >/p' it does send
characters to the printer BUT, all it prints is a line or so of
 garbage. I changed my baud settings in xmode and on the ultima to try and find
 some improvement but got none. There was one thing I noticed tho. If I had my
xmode for the printer baud at 2400 and
 the Ultima was set at 9600 I got that garbage, but if they were both 9600 or
2400, I got nothing.
 Would that indicate I am not getting enough power, or am I just dealing with
bad settings either in xmode or somewhere on the printer<as I hope>?
 I can't find the Dip switches on the panasonic, but am not sure if it even has
 those hidden anywhere. I'll check the printer manual to see what I can scrape
up
 there, but if anyone can confirm that I am getting power<and enough of it>,
 please reply.
 See Ya

When one of my TEAC F55BR's died recently I picked up a couple of the same

solenoid that moves the head into contact with the disk media when the
drive is accessed.  The noise is bothersome, especially when the house is
quiet.  None of the jumpers on the unit seems to allow the solenoid to
stay engaged; HS was jumpered...moved that to HL.  Does anyone know if it
going to cause trouble if I swap the solenoid & associated hardware with

            int pid;
            short sigcode;

 function:  Kill() sends a signal to a process. Both the sending and receiving
            process must have the same user number unless the sending process
            user number is that of the super user(0).

            the value in sigcode is sent as a signal to the process whose ID
            number is pid. you can give any value in sigcode. The conventional
            code numbers are definded in the <signal.h> header file.

            kill() returns -1 if an error occurs and the appropriate error code
            is placed in the global varible errno.

 caveats:   The super user can send a signal to all processes running on the
            system if the pid is zero.


Hope this helps. Right out of the manual.

Thanx much, that's exactly what I needed to know. Now that I know that I
have the syntax correct, I obviously must be doing something else wrong since
the 2 processes don't seem to be communicating properly!

     Fest Weather
     From: BOISY        To: MITHELEN

I've been watching the weather closely too.  The latest I have is that
Chicago is going to be clear and warm from now (Wednesday morning) to
Saturday.  Actually, it looks like we here in Des Moines will have a pretty
good week left, with clouds moving in Friday.

We're leaving Friday morning, heading east, so we'll be in the sun all the
way there.  What better way to start off a great weekend than with great
weather!

BTW, for those of you with Internet access, telnet to downwind.sprl.umich.edu
at port 3000 for up to date weather information from the NWS.

     Holiday Inn Elgin Phone Rates
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

Can someone tell if it is cost effective to use the Holiday Inn Elgin's
in room phone service to make modem phone calls to a local number?  What
I plan to do is to bring my MM/1 and modem to call Delphi through a local
access number.  I need to know as soon as possible.

Off hand, I don't know... Try calling up the hotel and asking how they bill
local phone calls.
