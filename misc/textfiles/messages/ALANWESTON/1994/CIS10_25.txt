>>Perhaps you could use the SIZE(str) function.

Well, I was really looking for simple IPC mechanisms and one of them was to
find a way to pass a pointer to a string. This would mean I'd also have to pass
SIZE(str).  Maybe this elegant IPC stuff is just too much under the
circumstances.

Just to recap this whole thread, and why I think we're getting confused, was
thay Dick wanted to know what ADDR() returned. Then we got talking about string
lengths, etc.

        ADDR(string) - returns the address of string. This can be used, with
great caution, but using POKE and PEEK.

        LEN(string) - returns the length of string

        SIZE(string) - returns the storage allocated for string.

You needed worry about overwriting the string storage since B09 will not permit
it (unless you do POKE/PEEK).

BTW, B09 is a pretty good and very fast language. It has some limitations which
I was hoping would be addressed in the 68K version, but, alas, it seems not to
be so. I would like to see some was to implement Global and/or Static variables
and a way to limit the name space pollution with all packed functions be
available to the entire system...should be some way to make private functions.

Yeah Lee!  That'd be great!  Don't forget your DalTRUG friends when you start
handing out v2.0!  I know I'd like to see my emulator running it!

Okay, and I'll go on record as saying that I lost my CoCo years ago and miss it
a lot.  I love my PC too but only because it's incredibly souped up to the
point that it's useful (485DX50, 20meg RAM, VESA local bus everything).  I'm
experimenting with the CoCo2 emulator but I really miss the CoCo3's abilities.


From my experience, each process under OS9 has its own unique attributes that
are changable only within itself but are passed down to its children (but not
it's parent) processes.  That being the case, either the program you're running
must be responsible for changing the execution directory or you should write a
small program that will change it and call the program from there.
