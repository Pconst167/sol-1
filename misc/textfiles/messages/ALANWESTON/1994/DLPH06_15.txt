You've gotten some mis-information.  Attendance was atleast as good as last year

and many booths were OSK & OS-9.  RS-dos has some support still but for the
most part there are few vendors that are willing to write new programs under
that environmemnt.  The vendors that made the most money were the ones that
had new products to sell.  Most of the new products were in the OSK area but
Northern Xposure was an exception.  The Glenside Club has already reserved the
Holiday Inn for next year.  We have at least 75% of the vendors saying they will

be back next year.  I suggest you ask some of the vendors directly for their
impressions of the Fest.

  I have asked,,, but not being into OSK, I usually don't get much response.
  From what I heard there still just isn't much available foro OSK.
  Several remarked attendance seemed down.  But it may have just appewared that
 way to them.
  the important thing, as youo state, there are enough vendors oto support
 it's continuation.

Terry, it's true that there aren't a large number of commercial software
products for OSK.  But if you include the many, many powerful
non-commercial programs available, it far exceeds what is available for
Level 2, except in the areas of games and graphics, IMHO.

Well...let's see.  As far as text processing, there's TeX, Lout, and
Ghostscript (a PostScript clone so that you don't have to have a PostScript
printer in order to use PostScript), just off the top of my head.

sc is a considerably more capable spreadsheet than DynaCalc, and the
price ($0) is right.  Ditto for gnuplot versus Phantomgraph, or elvis
or stevie versus tsedit.  I think Microware still sells SmartWare for
OS-9/68000, which is an integrated word processor, database, and spreadsheet.

For that matter, I'd bet that a fair number of packages available both
for OS-9/6809 and OS-9/68000 are developed first for OS-9/68000, or
improvements made first in the 68xxx version, because the developer
can concentrate on the product rather than on working around the
limitations of the 6809 and the debugging environment is a lot better.
Some improvements don't make it into the 6809 version (vide Vprint and
Ved).

Terry:

   For what it's worth (2 cents). The 'fest was as well attended (maybe better)
than last year at Chicago. Altho I do work with os9 and osk, my biggest
seller was an RSDOS program! HAWKSoft Home Control allows you to use the
old Coco Plug 'n Power controller from RS with your Coco 3! It doesn't have
the questionable block graphics that the Rom-Pak used, but, does allow
you to program the controller to run your home.

   Also, it was the BEST 'fest (profit-wise) in several years!!

Hi, Terry -

I'm afraid that there is a tendency for Level 2 users to see OS-9 through
"CoCo coloured glasses".  I won't try to kid you that we don't long for
more applications under OS-9/68000 -- there are still lots of opportunities
for folks to fill in the gaps!  But the world of OS-9/68000 applications
really is significantly expanded beyond what is available under Level 2.

As one of the publishers involved in this market, it would probably be
a good idea for you to familiarize yourself with what is really out there,
in order to ensure that you "know your potential market".

Here is a sampling of the available applications.  I will try to avoid any
that are specific to a single platform (e.g., MM/1):  most of the
following should run on ANY sufficiently configured (e.g. enough memory,
etc.) OS-9/68000 box.  No attempt to be comprehensive here -- mostly just
some of the stuff I have collected on my harddrive, or am aware of...

A while back I was watching Larry King Live on CNN, and King had as his
guest the comic Rich Hall.  Hall is probably most famous for his "Sniglets,"
and people were calling in with suggestions for new sniglets.  Most of them
fell extremely flat.

It occurred to me then that I was very lucky to be a programmer--because
if I go to a party or meet a friend of a friend, and it comes up in
conversation that I'm a programmer, the person to whom I get introduced
will never collar me and show me this great new sort routine he came up
with.  Comedians aren't that fortunate.

I think that these days one can find v.32bis modems going for $150-$200,
and those run 14.4K bit/sec, so 9600 bit/sec should run less than that.
I wouldn't be a good source for what good brands are...heck, I bought
a CompuCom Star just before the company went bankrupt.  (OTOH, aside from
not having gotten the v.42 modes promised in a later firmware version,
it's been a reliable beast, so I don't think their demise was for
technological reasons.)

Yes, as James says, 14.4K baud modems (v.32bis) are going for ~ $150 -$200
for external units (I have actually seen some even less then that though on
specials) For long term reliability, I'd have to recomend Hayes, or US Robotics
they cost a bit more (especially the Hayes) but the tech support is great
and you have guerenteed compatiblity. I have a Hayse Optima 96 (it is only a
v.32 9600 baud modem) and it is a real trouper (a friend has 8 of them on his
Unix box) My other modem is a Zypcom Z32b-SZ, which is a v.32bis 14.4K/FAX
modem. I've only had it for about 4 or 5 months, so far it is still working,
but it does have a few weird idiosyncrocies (?SP?) that make it act strange
once and a while. (i paid 150$ total on it) it is also upgradeable to V.Fast
which is the 28.8K baud "standard".

If you are buying new, I would strongly recommend going with a 14.4Kbps,
as the price difference between these and 9600bps modems is typically
small. In fact, flipping throught the July issue of Computer Shopper,
I note that quite a few places don't advertise 9600bps (V.32) modems...
even those that also advertise 2400bps models.

I myself have nothing but good things to say about Practical Peripherals.
I currently own a used 9600SA, which has performed very well for me,
and on an occasion in which it did not, it was replaced for a mere
$15, which included 2-day UPS return shipment.

I have had mixed experience with Supra's equipment. My first, a basic
2400bps model, worked without problem. Later, when I acquired their
2400+ (with MNP & V.42bis), I found it could not connect via Sprintnet
with a MNP-4 connection. Neither my older Data Race modem (with MNP) ,
nor my current PP 9600SA (with MNP & V.42bis)have had any problem of this
sort. The fact that Supra offered no means to upgrade the ROM or
otherwise alleviate the problem left me wary of their current products.

Hi Charles; I expect the printer problem is because you're useing a seriel
printer and the nitro speedup just made your 2400 baud driver into a 3100
baud driver! /send jrupple dunno, it was/is slow to my thinking too
Try the program utility called tuneport, it may restore operation. As I recall,
you'll have to resave 'printer' afterwards as its been modified to adjust its
time delay loop that control the fine tuning of the baud rate. Essentially
the same thing I had to do to 'um3play' to make the midi driver work again.
I expect ypu'll get other similar msgs too. Cheers Charley; Gene

Charlie, this is a common problem with folks after they first set up
NitrOS9.  You probably need to run the "tuneport" utility to adjust the
timing on the bit-banger port, since NitrOS has changed the speed of the
timing loop.

     Survey
     From: REVWCP       To: ALL

Dear friends:

I am currently working on an article for one of the OS9 magazines
and I need to conduct an informal survey.  While at the Fest in
Chicago, I got to meet so many of you and I came to realize that
with the amount of gray hair in my beard, and the lack of hair of
any color further up, I am beginning to feel like one of the
geezers of OS-9.  After all, I am over forty.  I was amazed at how
young some of you are, and that brings me to the point of this posting.
Could you please take a moment and answer the following:

    1.  Name.
    2.  Current age.
    3.  Age at which you got started on the COCO.
    4.  Age at which you got started with OS9.
    5.  Did you have formal programming training?

For example, I am going on 41.  I was 33 when I aquired my first COCO2.
And I started working with OS9 in 1988 with OS9 at age 35.  I have not
had any formal programming training, just what I have learned with the
help of so many of you.

Thank you for you replies.

With all best wishes,
Brother Jeremy, CSJW

Brother Jeremy:

1. Gene Heskett
2. 59 (& holding, but my grip is weakening)
3. 51, CoCo 1, it still worked a year ago!
4. 52, OS-9 1.00 its bugs nearly sent me away.
5. No, I started out on a Quest "Super Elf" kit, RCA 1802 based, which
is still running and doing the job I programmed it to do in 79! Then
tried the Z-80, TI9900 & then found the 6809! The instruction set sold me,
the only one that made ANY sense that I had run into. I mean, who ever heard
of a relative branch limited to -126 +128 distance? NO long relative branchs
allowed! As for the 9900, its a very unique architecture, no internal
registers except its register pointer. To switch tasks, just reload the
pointer to a new set of vars in memory. No flags to save or anything like
that. It doesn't have "relative" branchs. 6809 beats it easily for overall
ease pf programming (IMHO)

Cheers, Gene

Bill and/or Curtis should be making an announcement here some time this
week regarding the status of NitrOS-9.

Summed up briefly, v1.20 is scheduled for release around mid-July, and you
should wait until then before purchase, as the price has been lowered.

If you need further information, you can contact me at (613)736-0329.

Those who already own NitrOS-9 should also wait for the announcement.

   Maybe put a RE: NitrOS9 on the address as well so Bill or I can tell if it
is regular work business or NitrOS9 related (our work is letting us use their
address for correspondence, since one of us is bound to be their every
weekday. Prevents letters from getting locked up for a couple of weeks if one
of us is on vacation).
   For dire emergencies, you can call us (by name) at work too, but don't do
it too often, as our work doesn't want to pay us for doing support for a
product that they have nothing to do with (except for printing our manuals at
a good price). The number there is (306)-384-8000.
    In the evenings, you can call me (306)-384-4722 or Bill (306)-978-0834 at
home.
    We will have some distributors soon for the new Version 1.20 release, as
well as our new upgrade/purchase policy, hopefully by the end of June, work
schedules permitting. We were pretty busy after getting back from the Fest,
and finally had time to print some manuals (V1.15/16) for backorders this
afternoon, so we haven't had too much time to do much with NitrOS9. We should
get the manuals mailed out to individuals waiting for them by the end of the
week, and then start doing some bug-hunting/last minute updates & the new
manual after that. We will keep you posted as to our progress on this echo. If
anyone with Delphi/Internet/Compu$erve access can pass this info along, please
do...I don't have access to most of it anymore.

     RE: C programming again
     From: MROWEN01     To: COLORSYSTEMS

     Thanks for the feedback. I tried changing the increment operator on
Monday night. This of course showed no change, nor did the number of times
the loop ran. I knew something was up. I'll try the global declaration. I
take it you have done some significat C programming on the Coco? Should
large arrays generally be declared as global in any C programming
environment? I'm definitely looking for style tips, something books won't
generally tell you. It's also difficult to find any books on C under an
OS other than MS-DOS. I have a good older UNIX book that has been helpful.
What I would really like to see is some good source code for the Coco. This
would help me learn some techniques and get a flavor of the style. Where
can I find some well written C source?

I market two game packs for the CoCo3 and OS9 Level 2. Each game pack
has 5 variations. All 10 of the game programs were written in C using
the Kreider Lib and the Tandy cgfx.l library from the Development Pack.
The compiler front end used rma and rlink also from the Dev Pack.

All use 100% "legal" OS-9 code. All graphics are done with standard cgfx.l
calls and Get/Put Buffers.

 > Should large arrays generally be declared as global in any C
 > programming environment?

No, you need to understand how the compiler implements that kind of stuff.
In the micro world, you tend to have to worry about memory in some way or
another. With CoCo C, you cannot write a program that either starts out
larger than 64K or dynamically grow (using the malloc() function) past
64K.

You also need to worry about how the stack is implemented. In CoCo C,
there is normally stack overflow checking, but apparently it doesn't always
work.

 > style. Where can I find some well written C source?

One place is books on C programming. Most books come with a disk of the
source files. There is also an abundance of source files here in Delphi's
library. Some contributed by myself. Go look in the Programmer's Den.

Since he's the author of WPShell, and lots of games for the CoCo, I
would reckon that Zack has done significant C programming on the CoCo
(and other systems, since I've wasted more time than I'd like to admit
playing his solitaire games on my MM/1. :-) :-)  Not to say "gee, didn't
you know," just justifying my suspicions.

 > Should large arrays generally be declared as global in any C
 > programming environment?

Depends.  If you don't know how big the array needs to be until run
time, then you can't declare it as global; instead, you have to declare
a pointer and allocate the space dynamically with malloc() or something
like it.  Also, there's a lot to be said for keeping data access sort of
like security, namely on a "need to know" basis.  (And like security,
if too many people "need to know," then something's seriously wrong.)
Making stuff global that doesn't have to be violates that principle, so
you might want to consider making such an array static.

 > I'm definitely looking for style tips, something
 > books won't generally tell you.

Style is to some extent a religious issue (i.e. it induces many "holy
wars").  Thomas Plum puts out some good books with advice on C style
and conventions, but keep an eye out for examples of good style.

Shucks, you were way ahead of me already.

 > Where can I find some well written C source?

IMHO, you might, ahem, want to take a look at the source to QED, recently
uploaded here on Delphi.  (Ahem. :-)

 A little more info might help. Does the problem occur on your system or
your friend's MAC or both? What kind of parameter are you requiring?
(it is defined properly in the PARAM statement, right?) Are you copying the
parameter to another structure? I usually use:

   PARAM that:integer
   DIM this:integer

   this:=4   *default
   on error goto 100
   this:=that

100  continue program (this=4 if no param)

There is only one, and it is available in Tandys Developers Pack.

These _can_ be still ordered from Tandy (at least that is what I have heard)
Not sure if it is through Express order, Special order, or Software
assembly. Basically, ANY software package from Tandy can still be obtained,
it just takes a little work. Someone else might be able to fill you in on
the details

Kala Software sells it, sorry, don't have their address or phone number.
Mike Knudsen occasionally pops onto delphi (ragtimer) he is also a member
of the Glenside Color Computer Club, and may sell directly to you.

> -A subscription to Rainbow (if it is still in existance)

Alas, the Rainbow has been truely discontinued for some time (has it been 2...
or three years now) There are several other small publications that have
sprung up and are all excellent (from what I hear. I don't subscribe to all
of them) Unforch, I don't have info on any of them handy. I'm sure
someone else here will point you in the right direction.
