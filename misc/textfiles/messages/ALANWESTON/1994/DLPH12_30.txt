Ya... D.L. II is much better then the orig... I still rank Mutant Rampage
above it though...

I picked up NFL Hall of Fame Football a week or so ago... it is a must for
the Foot Ball fanatic... lots of great information, and old clips of
the Hall of Famers. And the football game itself is decent. Although if you
want to set up your own leauge/team, you pretty much can't have anything
else stored in the CDi players NVRam (anyone figure out how to add more
NVRam yet?) My brother in law really enjoyed playing it Christmas day
(kicked my behind: 40something to 0!)

I agree that the files should be marked for each computer and that it
should be the resposibilty of the uploader to use the appropriate
keywords when uploding ANY file to this or any section!

    I was just about to post the same thing. Allthough I didn't down any of
the new uploads that just popped up I looked at the descriptions and it
seemed they were 6809 files so I left them alone. I do hate when I have to
search the descriptions for things like "runs fine under MultiVue" or
"you will need (a level2 program) on the same floppy" in order to distinguish
6809 from 68000. Once, I didn't know until I SCOURED the docs that what I
downed was 6809 code.

    I also think we should all decide on a GUI to support on OSK, or support
them all (even better idea). The ones I can think of are Desktop and EthaGUI.
It would also be wonderful if the GUIs made installation of programs as easy
as on the Macintosh.

    Before I forget, whoever is in charge of seminars for Chi Fest '95, I
would like to do a seminar. Please send me mail. <DIGIGRADE>

    I'll be making a few heaping uploads as I update and write docs for some
shareware I've been working on for the MM/1 and had available on the now
deceaced (sp) Compiler Disk Supplement. Digigrade will be at the fest so keep
your eyes peeled those who are going. The Chi Fest is usually my favorite
time of the year. Didn't mean to drag this on... :)


    Have a happy new year! I know I will!

       Dave

It must be you... Seriously, unless otherwise stated in the keywords as for
something other then for OS-9/6809 then in most cases the program can be
assumed to be for generic OS-99/6809... If the submission is for OS-/68000
the keyword "OSK" should be present. If for OS-9000, the keyword "OS9000"
(or maybe it was OS9K) will be there. If GWindows, or Kwindows is required
(or multiview) then those keywords will also be present...

If you finde submissions in the database that do NOT conform to what is listed
above, then PLEASE, let me know the Group Name, and Database Name, and what is
incorrect. It is impossible for me to correct these things without being told
specifically what the problem is.

Then it must be me. At one time I thought an OS-9 program would have OS-9/OS9
or CoCo as a key word.  Since I haven't uploaded anything (nothing I have
written is really worth the storage space.....believe me) I don't if that is
one of the prompts (reminding uploaders of using certain keywords) \---know
or that is added later.  I assumed (we know what that means) that no keyword
specific to a machine or version of OS-9 meant it would run on anything or
there were files present for all machines or it could be compiled on any
machine.  Well, now that I'm straight on what is what, if there are any
submissions that don't conform.....I'll let you know.  On a lighter note,
OS-99?  Boy, I haven't been in touch (grin).

    Nope, just Delphi and Compuserve, good enough! I was really blown
away by how easy it is to use. It even lets you choose what offline editor
you want to use. That reminds me, MicroEmacs started (all of a sudden it
seems) to think that the ix_tmp.0000xx files ix uses to store your replys
and posts are C source, so it enters CMODE. That can be a bit annoying. But
I switched to UMacs and it doesn't seem to care what the extension is, it's
NOT going into CMODE unless you tell it to. I think UMacs is what the nice
big PRINTED AND HOLE PUNCHED (oops, sorry about some of you other
developers) manual reccomended. Infoxpress also includes sample config files
that are commented and easy to understand. (darn I'm replying to the wrong
person again) <g> You can organize forums (and custom forums) into different
call groups. When you type "o" it will ask you what call groups you want it
to call and process. You could have Group1 with OS9 SIG, Hobby SIG, and
personal mailbox or all as seperate groups. Each group is a different call
since the groups could be Delphi and then Compuserve, or even different
accounts. It is very configureable. The four best buys for OSK are (IMO)
in no particular order, Write Right! THE WYSIWYG word processor, DeskTop
(just from the images & demo I know it's good!), EthaGUI, and InfoXpress.
Each one is fully functional and fully featured.

      Excuse the sidetracking please.

      Yes, it's nice to have if Delphi or Sprintnet spits up at you. Ix is
pretty smart (as you may well know) and when things lag to a stop or there
is alot of line noise ix will sometimes leave Delphi or Compuserve and
display a message (until you look at the screen and see it) that an error
occured and you can look at the logfile (if you told it to log that group)
and see just what happened online. If it happened in the middle of forum
grab then it will most likely just do that forum over (and get the rest) the
next time you press "o". Ix knows when a file is damaged by line noise and it
will stamp DAMAGED on the file header, so you can request to re-read it or
mail that is in your packet. Anyway, I should leave this for an in depth
review.

It's nice for me to have 2 hard drives.It makessetting the first one back
up a lot easier and quicker! Until I find that I don't have room for
all those copies of directories and files witch I don't realy see
happening in the near futer! I have a lot of space on both drives still
and have only 13 megs on one drive in the past.Do you see the extra
chrs cuased by line noise or is that just shown on my end?There are a
few *'s that arent supposed to be there!

David, I don't think releaseing source is advisable either, especially since
it CAN cause headaches later. I should have said releasing source to the
general public!! Source should be made available to those who can properly
use and handle it. A notation in the docs that source is available from the
author upon request (at the authors discretion) should suffice. Not many
people are concerned about source anyway, and if they want to change soemthing
contacting the author would give notice of what was being attempted anyway.
(and by whom!)

     RE: Install program (Re: Msg 91015)
     From: DSRTFOX      To: TEDJAEGER (NR)

Ted, you may have to have two different install procedures: one for single
drive and one for two+ drives. Actually, you could write the script righback
toithe drive you're installing from. Then you could just prompt to reinsert that

disk at the proper time. Alternatively, you have a "scratch disk" that is
inserted for the script to save to, then reinserted when necessary. Windows
and MS-DOS do that when installing in some cases. That would be the best
scenario (a scratch disk) for single drive machines, and would be useable
with multidrives also. It only has to be done once, so no big problem using
a "scratch" disk!!

I understand what your saying about having a hybrid monitor. I just loosened
every connector iI could reach and reseated them. The monitor has been fine
now for 15 minutes or more which is longer then I've had for awhile. If it
stays on much longer, I'll figure I might be on to something. Then I'll
take all those connectors and lightly sand the males and spray some cleaner
into the females. Hope this is it. I already resoldered alot of joints but
that didn't help. Going on 20 minutes now and hoping.... Thanx Marty.
BTW, do you happen to know the model of an NEC Multisync monitor that
sync'ed low enuf to handle the Coco. Several people had mentioned such
an animal. Better yet if you could get me one. Price is not an issue, least
not a big issue, I do have limits. Still going... Be back soon to relay
my progress here. Again, thanx, and thanx to all the other parties that
left help messages for me concerning this problem. ... Charlie ...
