 Not quite correct.  CDS and PT are separate Companies.  Fred Brown designed
 both boards.  The Companies share some resources.  But I wouldn't call
 them competitors.  Don't know the reason for 2 separate Companies but my guess
 is that it was done on the advice of his accountant and/or attorney.

The only problem with that is that your code is no longer portable.
I want to write portable code which means staying with only the
standard library (putchar,putc,puts,getchar,getc,gets,printf,scanf,etc.).
Writes and reads are non-standard and machine dependant.

If you're using gets() or scanf() then you are using buffered I/O (unless
you set it to nonbuffered with setbuf()).  If you want to use unbuffered
I/O try using read() or readln() itead.  Using readlin() will allow you
to use the standard line buffer editor commands (just like you were typing
at the OS9: prompt) and no BS char will enter the string typed in.

Again if you really want to use unbuffered I/O you should the system calls
rather than the library calls, since this is what they were made for.  If
want to use a 'hot key' try the following:

        char ans;

        printf("Enter answer: ");
        fflush(stdout); /* flush it just to be sure */
        read(0,&ans,1); /* will wait for a single key press then */
        /* return with the value in ans */

        do whatever here

I do this all the time for hot keys (all the hot keys in DevSys are done
using similar code {shameless plug}).

Since you want portablity you'll find that all the stdlib I/O functions
use buffered I/O and that OS9's fix setbuf() is not available for other
OS's.  Use of system calls does not necessarily mean non-compatiblity
however, it depends on the systems you're porting to.  You can try an
old trick if you'd like for your hot keys, rather than use the read()
call try the follwoing function:

        int hot(char *ans)
        {
          read(0,ans,1);
          return ans;
        } /* oops the function declaration should be char *hot(...) */

Then for each port you will only have to rewrite (maybe) this function.

I've done this with several Unix programs and GNU does it regularly, just
a thought.

 > Isn't '\0' a NULL in standard C?

'\0' is a character constant.  In standard C, it has type int (weird, eh?);
in C++ it has type char.  Its value is zero.

What the ANSI C standard says is that *if you cast 0 to a pointer type*,
the result will be a null pointer.  There are, in fact, systems in which
the null pointer does not have all bits zero, so it does make a difference.
In ANSI C, you can get away with passing 0 to a function expecting a pointer
IF a prototype is visible at the call, because then the implicit cast will
occur.  If a prototype is *not* visible, then you're taking a chance.
On some systems, you'll luck out, and on some, you won't.

In pre-ANSI C, there are no prototypes, so you're taking a chance if you
pass the integer 0 to a function expecting to see a pointer and hoping that
the called function will get a null pointer.

I think read() and write() are going to be part of the standard in C++,
at any rate, most of the code I write depends on support from KWindows
and is therefore not very portable to begin with. Top that with every
system I've ever used a C compiler on HAD read() and write() type calls
and they worked the same as they did here on OS-9.

I figure if I want to port some of my code over to some OS which doesn't
have read() and write(), well that's what conditional compilation is all
about! <grin>

setbuf(), along with the now-preferable setvbuf(), are part of ANSI/ISO
standard C, and while I don't have a copy of the standard at hand, I
think it does say that if you hand setbuf() a null pointer constant for
the buffer pointer, it will make the stream an unbuffered stream.

Even so, your suggestion of hiding non-portable functions is good practice
in any case.

Right.  For "hot key" responses, your program would
have a routine that checks the input and (hopefully)
does something smart if the input char doesn't match
what is expected.  My problems came from trying to
port some messydos "C" stuff to the MM/1 and duplicate
the "getch()" and "getche()" functions.  There are
lots of ways to do it -- all of them have little snags
that have to be dealt with.

I have a Panasonic 2123 w/color kit and I have been VERY happy with it.
You really can't go wrong with the 2124!  As far as getting power for the
s-p converter, the Panasonic does not have the voltage on pin 18.  You
will need an external power source for the Blue Strekak.
  Or, if you are adventurous (sp?), you could open up the new printer,
find 5v somewhere inside and run it to pin 18.
  FYI if you do go with the color kit, the color screen dumps written

In the MS-Dog world it is common to buy machines that have the DOS installed

running Windows or the various MS-Dog programs that may have been bundled
with the machine.  There is also the option of going to the MS-Shell program
and using the mouse that is invariably included with the machine.  If you
don't ever want to see a command line prompt or learn anything about the DOS
it is very easy and you don't have to be limited to just a few programs that
are included either.  You can launch the install programs from Windows and
just allow the program to set itself up with answering a few simple questions
such as does this screen come up in color?  This is what OS-9 has been unable
to provide for the users.  It isn't a fault of the Operating system nor is it
impossible for us to achieve.  It just takes work and the willingness to do it
that way.  I for one would love to be able to install new programs without

No, I had never even owned a disk drive  before I bought OS9!!! Really!  I
went straight from the CCR-81 (cassette recorder) to OS9 Level Two.  I guess
we just disagree.  The only real problems I had were omissions in the manual,
such as the fact that having the execute attribute turned off will give you
a "pathname not found" error, or that COPY will not work with single-sided
disks and double-sided disks together in the same drive (i.e., if you have
only one drive).  But all in all, I think the OS9 LII manuals are as well

is just a lot to it.

I don't think we disagree at all - we are saying the same thing.  Of course
OS9 can be set up easy to use, but someone has to do that, and in order to do
that, one must have some understanding of the operating system.  In the CoCo
world, the end user (the purchaser of the software) is the one who has to know
his way around OS9.  The reason why OS9 got its reputation is simple.  Under
RS-DOS, if you buy, say, CoCoMax 3, to get it up and running all you have to
do is put the disk in the drive and type "Run CM3".  Anyone can do that.  But
to get MVCanvas up and running, you must "install" the program and that
demands a certain amount of know-how.  A lot of people just didn't want to go
to that much trouble, which is too bad.

Ken-Ton's address is:

187 Green Acres oad
Tonawanda, NY 14150

Phone: 716-837-9168

I've been using a Ken-Ton SCSI controller for almost 4 years, and it
has worked flawlessly.  I *HIGHLY* recommend it to anyone considering
a SCSI hard drive system.

Good luck.

I have a friend who has a 75 meg Fujitsu MFM and a Kenton interface and an
Adaptec 4000A controller.
The problem is RiBBS crashed on him and now when he tries to acess the drive he
gets error 240 in OS9 and IO Error in RSDOS. The light on the controller
flickers
but nothing happens in rsdos. The light just keeps flickering and the drive
sounds
like it is stepping. In OS9 the dirve light comes on for a       second then he 
gets
error #240 -unit error. Is there a way to recover what is on the drive or will
the
drive need to be reformatted? But attempts to reformat have ended in error 240
or IO error depending on if it's in RSDOS or OS9.
WW Thank you again for the CC3Disk drivers for his Super Controller II. He said
they are working fine! Rather they were working fine!

Anytime I've encountered Error #240 with the Ken-Ton, it meant that
the sectors being accessed on the hard drive are physically damaged.
I had a ST157N which had this same problem as you describe.  My problem
was that I was running it under a less than ample power supply.

It sounds as though your friend's drive sectors (at least the first
few) are trashed.  I'd suggest he try formatting it on an OSK box
or some other computer.

        Well I own a secondhand B&B Coco-xt Rtc which is great<got it
   used with a  whole bunch of stuff>, so I don't think you could go
   wrong with, but getting in touch with Chris to get one in the first
   place might prove tricky<G>. The number to Burke and Burke is (206)
   432-1814. That's the easy part. After reading the adventures of some
   of the others here, the hard part will most likely be actually getting
   a hold of him, but it can't hurt to try. Who knows, he may finally get
   a break and be able to get back to you :-)
        I can't remember the number to Ken-Ton, but someone here will
   have it. From what I hear it is a GREAT system, and my next HD system
   for the Coco will most likely be Ken-Ton, IF I get another.

I plan on running a hard drive issue of 68 micros, but will be August or
September. I intend to have a very detailed coverage of the subject with
several articles and set-ups, including a B&B and SCSI (Ken-ton and Disto).
If you have a Disto Super Controller with the mini-buss, get a Disto HDII or
4-n-1 board hard drive controller. If you go SCSI, you can get almost any of
the new SCSI drives IF you use Matt Thompson's drivers here on delphi or the
B&B 512 byte sector drive
r. The drawback is you can't use the HD for DECB with the 512 byte drivers. The
Ken-ton system can be accessed yr

The problem is Ribbs crashed on him and now he gets error 240 when trying to
access the hard drive. He tries to load RGG-DOS but the drive light flickers
but nothing happens and the light keeps flickering. Attempts at formatting in
RSDOS yeild an IO Error
and attempts at formatting in OS9 yield error 240. Do you know how he could get
the drive back up with or without losing the 6 or 7 megs that are on it already?

About the only thing I can think of is boot from a floppy with the hard drive
descriptors in place (but not as /dd) and then try to read the hard drive. If
you can't read it, I'm afraid you're stuck! But you mentioned attempts to
reformat were giving errors also... just OS-9 format or a low-level format?

     Emulator Support
     From: JES68K       To: ALL

To all those wishing to use the CoCo2 Emulator program:

Recently a new SIG message base and file area was added to ACS BBS in
Atlanta ...... known as the EMULATOR SIG - it will support the use of
the CoCo2 Emulator program.  I am currently the SigOP for this special
interest group.  We are providing the area to encourage the use of
CoCo software on PC clone systems and to aid those wishing to do so
to allow all users to know the full capability of this program.

Files uploaded to this area will utilize the .DSK and .PAK file formats
for direct use with the Emulator program.  All files must be PD and not
violate any copyright laws.  This is an opportunity for original .PAK
games to be created.

I expect the greatest help will be from the .DSK files and .HLP text
files which will be uploaded, plus the message base discussions of any
problems/solutions, etc.

ACS BBS phone is (404)636-2991, we are now online with a new 1Gig hard
drive supporting CoCo, OS9/6809, OSK, OS9000, and now COCO2 Emulator!

    Wow, that's kinda annoying that it doesn't work on a 320 screen.  There
seem to be a few things that don't work perfectly on those screens.  You could
still write your own function, but it would be a little complex.  How many

I don't know if you've come across this one... I haven't been able to

a problem with the patched grfdrv for Disto 2 meg upgrade.  Recently,
I discover under DECB that when I type WIDTH 40, the system goes
south as well.  I don't remember this occuring when I first installed
the 2 megs.  Any thoughts?

Welp... I finally committed my Sun 3/160 to running the SandV BBS this
weekend... It is now on line, but, not yet open to users, as I still have some
"bugs/quirks" to work out.... Please note, that all old user accounts have been
deleted, so, if you were coresponding with someone on the "old" SandV, you
won't be able to send Internet Mail to them until they apply for an account
again (although, old users that were "contributing" users will have their
account restored by the end of the week)

Also, please note, that I will no longer be "sysop@sandv.chi.il.us", instead I
will be using "mithelen@sandv.chi.il.us" as my primary account on SandV.
