Bad news on your hard drive.  I'm doing OK on recovery, other than
having no sick time left to cover my time off!  Need to sell some
sytems,   have one working board set available, need to find problem
with SCSI drive circuit on new I/O boards though.   Have Ray Patterson
working on it now.  TTYL!

Stephen, my number is (405) 234-2347.   My schedule is very erratic, but we're
working on getting MM/1 I/O boards shipped.  The SCSI is acting up at the
moment, but we're hopeful of a fix soon, that will involve actually being able
to add another improvement in performance.  It's the nice thing about working 
with proven technology, which the MM/1 is now, other than the SCSI.  The 
joystick problems are fixed, the sound is better, and the software is coming 
of age!

  Are there presently any Memory upgrade boards available?  If so, how 
soon could I get one?
 
  BTW, how fast can a MM/1 with 68340 run?  I've been running mine at 
16MHz since I got it with hopes that using 60ns memories will allow
20MHz.  What about the speed of the video memory?
