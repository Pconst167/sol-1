Subject : 5 1/4 CoCo disk read?
Date    : 94/07/04 20:22:15

Once again, I'm searching for the right combination of jumber settings
and Dmode settings to allow reading CoCo format 360K diskettes with an
MM/1.   This time thedrive is a FD55FGR.   I have it working in High
density mode, but not double.... 
 
Was also unable to get a Chinon drive to work.  Any suggestions? 
 
OH- almost let the smoke out of the machine with the Teac in.  
line 2 melted on me, when tryiing to use Turbo switch to allow switchin
between pin 2 high and low with J13.

I had just installed a new Maxtor 290meg SCSI drive and it ran fine for
about 3-4 days and all of a sudden died.  The access led would lite but
no action.  Must have blown a chip on the controller or something. 
Anyway the warrenty is complete replacement on a drive not over 30 days
in service and that is what they are doing.
I wonder if it is just my keyboard but I accidentally discovered the
home key duplicated the CTRL A key to repeat a cmd line. I like that
even better than the shift + right arrow key on shell + to repeat a cmd
line.

David,
     Received your post of 94/07/06 today 94/07/09.  Not the best Fido
can do but reasonable.  I am getting mail as new as 1 day old however.
     What's HOT! ?  Temp here is always (yearly extremes) 65-75 with an
occasional Santa Ana the will get it up to the mid 80's but cools off in 
evening.  San Diego (beachs) are world known for fine weather.
-Warren.
