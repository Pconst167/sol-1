Frank,
        I have been looking for one of those for a long time. Another think I
never could find was something that an Air Force Sergeant in a comm center sent
me looking for many years ago -- you got a good deal on a "bucket of line
feeds"?

Sounds like a few things we used to send the new Navy boots on board ship.
Like:

        10 yards of water line

        a bucket of steam

        some relative bearing grease

John,

I looked all over my garage for a "bucket of line feeds". I coulda swore I had
some. Used to store them next to the nulls I used after my carrage returned
from the shop.

(Space reserved for pithy remark, if I think of one)

Sb: #Bad Header?
Fm: Mark Logan 73354,1245
To: All

I'm having trouble restoring downloads from this forum with the ARC utility.
Every time I try it, I get an error message that says the file has a bad
header.

I'm downloading files onto my Mac, then porting them via DOS floppy to my
Philips 605 running OS-9.  Are the files possibly coming across as Mac Binary
during the download? I've looked but can find no switch to force the downloads
not to be treated as Mac Binary.  Or maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree.

Any ideas?  A reply via Compuserve mail would be most appreciated.

Thanks,

Mark Logan

Mark,

Your terminal program on the Mac should have a switch that allows you to engage
MacBinary or not. If you don't, trash that stupid program and get one of the
ones that does.... TermPlus, ZTerm, ClarisWorks, etc.

Once you've got it in straight binary form, well.... it's anyone's guess from
there.

Sb: Sorts
Fm: John R. Wainwright 72517,676

OSK users:
        This has been bugging me for a while - never got around to asking about
it before.

        On the distribution disks for the MM/1 there are two sort utilities,
"qsort", documented in the OSK manuals, and "sort", documented absolutely
NOWHERE.  They seem to do about the same thing, but sort is bigger, and seems
to handle input a little differently.

        "qsort file"  will print file (sorted).

sort will do it too, but you have to tell it:

 "sort <file"

"qsort" will print a help message, but "sort" will not.

either will print to a file if output is redirected.  Both will read from stdin
if no filename is given - that is about as far as I have gone in playing with
them.

        The reason I started fiddling with them was a program that called
"sort" would hang up until I patched it to call "qsort".

        Anybody seen any docs for "sort?"
