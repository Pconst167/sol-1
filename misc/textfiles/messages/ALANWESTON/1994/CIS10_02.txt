HECTOR,

I am currently working for a FUJI America Corp. as a software engineer
specializing in OS-9 control systems. My principle duties are in the area of
system integration ie:UDP;TCP/IP;Machine Control. I have written a bit of code
for setting up sockets, device drivers etc. however I do not consider myself a
"GURU" of OS-9.

I would be interested in obtaining more information on the position you
mentioned if you have not filled it yet. Thank you for your time and I hope to
be hearing from you soon.

For your enlightened entertainment,

When I spotted this I had to read it 3 times before I beleaved it.

I read the following in the September 12th 1994 issue of Infoworld on
page 10. The title of the piece is: "It's official: Chicago will be
called Windows95"  The article describes why Microsoft decided on the
name Windows95 rather than Windows 4.0 because...

"According to Microsoft, users had difficulty understanding which
version of Windows, 3.0, 3.1, or 3.11 was the latest."

Explains a lot doesn't it.

However we must ask the question. Which came first?

Do stupid people buy Windows or does using Windows make people stupid?

I'll let you decide.

Gosh, Frank, I use Windows for seven or eight hours a day at work, and Mensa
doesn't think I'm stupid yet! Mind you, maybe using OS9 at home is an antidote
of sorts. Actually, I like Windows' point-and-shoot launcher, but it is
miserable at actually running things, and its multitasking is a poor joke. And
talk about slow!

But which one is the latest? Gee, does it matter? They ALL crash with amazing
regularity.

Oh, it was MY decision to buy Windows at work, for the simple reason that all
the sophisticated software works only with Windows, and we have some 45
MSDOS/Windows computers in our office; kinda hard to be odd man out!

Hmm.. Looking over my original Disks, You MAY have ver 1.01, which will not
boot on the coco3.  My Ver 1.01 disks say "OS-9 BOOT", and "OS-9 System
Master".  The cat # is 26-3030.  However, you can get the original Level 1
assembler off this if you are into assembly language.  If you do, indeed, have
this non-bootable Version, and don't have a bootable version, I'm sure someone
has a spare copy of Level 2 that they will don't need and will let you have
very reasonably.

 > Will this thing only use Radio Shack drives? Or can an old IBM external
 > drive be used?

You can use about any type drive up through Double Density.  If you plan on
doing much with it and don't go to a hard drive, I'd suggest installing at
least one 720K disk.  The controller will not support High-Density disks,
however, you can use a 1.44 drive and use the 720-K disks, but can't use the
1.44-K disks.  The computer will support up to 3 double-sided disks. Oh, BTW,
is the Drive controller Radio Shack or third-party?

I have  all kinds of disk drives (3 inch! - not 3 1/2) but only have one

hook disk drives together?  I  get I/O errors all the time with the 5 1/4...

Chances are that its the drive, or the disks. I recently went through a box of
old 5 1/4 disks and could only get about half of them to even read, and the
ones that worked got lots of I/O errors. If its one of the older Tandy drives,
its also quite possible its out of alignment.

Not sure about 3" drives..  I'm not really up on exactly what is what on the
various drives.  Hopefully, someone here can enlighten you better than I.

Re: cables. you Might be able to special order them but, if you want to do a
lot with OS/9, you would be better off to set it up for double sided drives, it
will give you more capacity (Well.. of course it would <G> ).  I'm not sure, if
the drives are RS, they are probably actually double-sided, but the cable is
wired goofy so it will work 4 single-sided drives.. I believe you have to
modify the power supply board, I'm not sure, and the cables are easy to make..
all you need is a 34-wire flat cable, a standard 34-wire edge card connector
for the controller end, and the same for the 5 1/4 drives.  The 3 1/2 drives
require a different connector (not sure about the 3's).  However, all the 3
1/2's I've fooled with have #1 pin on opposite side than the 5 1/4's, so for
these, if you make up the cable, have them facing the opposite side than the
connectors for the 5 14's and then twist the cable.  Oh, most coco cables don't
have the twisted pair found in the PC cables.

I doubt it's you.. It could be the connections are dirty on the controller,
some cleaning might help.. Also, the drive COULD be slightly out of alignment.
Do you have 2 drives or 1?  If 2, are errors on both drives?

Will your case hold 2 or more drives?  If so, all you might need to do is add
another connector for the additional drive(s).  Then add the descriptor "d1" to
your bootfile.  What's the capacity of the 3" drives?  You can have up to 3
double sided drives or 4 single sided drives in the system (you can get more,
but it's a little complicated).

Oh, to get double-sided operation, if the cable is Radio Shack, you might have
to do more.. not familiar w/ RS cables, but it seems they might be connected a
little squirrely.. not sure.. never fooled with the RS versions myself.

Just thought I should add that if you are using a Amdeck Disk Drive (if memory
serves...) then these are a single sided drive using a 3" disk. However, the
disks are flippies. Don't know if cable hacking would hurt with these, but
please remember that they are single sided drives.

To check for the non-OS/9 disks, under RS-DOS (what you start up in), insert
them individually and do a "dir" on them... if text shows up, they are DISK
BASIC disks and you can run them without OS/9.  Do you have docs for any of
them?

Well, unless the disk is glitched, it should boot (although it doesn't). Since
it was with the CoCo 3, it SHOULD be either Level 1, Version2, or Level 2, but,
just in case, if you know someone who has a coco 2, you might try to boot on
it.  If it is level 2, it won't boot on the coco 2, but if it does boot and
says "Version 2" (of either level), then it is incompatible with the coco3.  Do
you have the games Flight Simulator 2, King's Quest, Rogue, koronis Rift, or
anything that says it's for the coco 3?  Any of these operate under OS/9..  On
some of these, you can exit to the DOS, and then you might be able to do dir's
on some of the disks you have in question. (Not the RS-DOS disks, I mean the
OS/9 disks)... One catch, all Standard disks are single-sided, and as supplied,
don't support double-sided disks, and the disks in question might be
double-sided..  Double-sided disks will boot, but the disks that come from
Radio Shack are not set up to support the double-sided disks.

However, you might look through your disks and look for another boot disk.

Good news... looking through the millions of disks that came with this computer
I realized that the version of OS/9 I was trying to get to work was version
1.00.... I then managaed to find Version 2.00... put it in and it workds like a
charm - well - if I knew how to use it - it would!

Next step - read the millions of manuals that came with this stuff and actually
DO something with this stuff...

Thanks again for the help...

Good.. I was almost certain this was the case.. Now, is your working version
Level 1, Version 2?  If so, and you want to do some neat stuff, see if you
have, Level 2.. If not, try to get a copy.. post here.. someone is sure to have
a spare copy they'll let you have cheap or nearly so.  It's far better,
windowing capability, 80-col screen etc (do you have a monitor?)

If you are into playing with computers, you'll be truly amazed at what this
little computer can do.

I believe you'll be thrilled...

Gee, every time I think I'm getting the hang of this computer a little bit -
you guys ask me another question!  I'm not sure what Level the OS/9 disks
are... HOw do you figure that out?  There's a sticker on the disks that says
"2.00", but nothing else....

I was reading through one of the CoCo magazines that came with this and it
talked about all the great things that level 2 could do... sure seemed ahead of
its time...

The monitor I'm using is one from an Amiga in the school that's been sitting
around for more than a week - we kind of have a "use it or lose it" policy -
luckily for me...

I have a really silly question about os/9 - how do you get programs to run with
it... I have this huge book on OS/9 - it talks about all the great things it
can do, but I can't find out how after it's running I can stick in a disk that
runs under OS/9 and just run it (or load it, or EXEC it...) Maybe I'm just
overwhelmed and will figure it out eventually....

Jean -

Simple - all you do is type the name of the program, and it will be loaded from
disk and executed.

There are some assumptions made:

   a) That the program is indeed executable code
   b) That the program is on the disk, and in the execution directory
      (usually /dd/cmds or /d0/cmds)

If you need to change disks to run your program, you need to help os9 find the
execution directory on the new disk. Your best bet here is to type the
following:

   chx /d0/cmds (or /dd/cmds)
   chd /d0      (or /dd)
   {program_name}

That should do it!

When you boot up, you should see a logo at the top of the screen. If it is
Level 2, it will say so.. There will also be a version #, but look for the
"Level #".  If you have your docs, they will be in a loose-leaf binder.  Also,
you can issue the command "mdir" and look for certain names.. Level 1 will have
a name "SysGo" there, Level 2 will have "CC3Go".

With Level 2, you will be able to access numerous windows, You will have to
start them up yourself (the docs should tell you how).  You can switch between
them using the "CLEAR" key.  Then you can start up numerous programs and have
them executing at the same time.  If you have "Flight Simulator" going in one
window, you can switch to another window and if you don't pause the program,
the plane may have crashed, because it will still be going, even though it is
not displayed.  If you want to print out a file to the printer, you can issue
the command "list {filename} >/p" and go to another window and do something
else.  (You can add "&" to the end of the above line and stay in that window
and the printout will proceed, and you can do something else in that window.
This will work with Level 1.

Yes, it was.  It is still pretty up to date, except for the speed on some
tasks, and memory can sometimes be a little tricky for programmers.

Pete Lyall did a good job in answering this question. To recap... OS9
"remembers" 2 directories..  an "execution" directory and a "data" directory.
If you issue the command "dir", OS9 first checks to see if the module (program)
named "dir" is in memory.  If not, it looks at the current "exec" directory to
see if a file by that name exists (the filename does not HAVE to be the same as
the module name, you COULD have a module named "cls" that will clear the
screen.  But, in this case if it is stored in the "exec" dir under the name
"dir" (and "dir" is not in memory), then it will load that file, and clear the
screen.

Lastly, if the file is not found in the execution directory, it will look in
the current "data" directory for a procedure file (same as "batch" file under
MS-Dos), and execute it if found.

You can also specify a specific full pathname for a command.  Suppose you have
2 drives (second drive is "d1").  There is a directory named "FOO" and say, in
that directory, there is a directory "FOO2", and in that directory, a program
(of either type) named "fooey".  You could, without doing a "chx", simply enter
"/d1/FOO/FOO2/fooey" and it will be found.

The best way to get the feel of it is to play with the "dir" command on various
disks.  One other thing.. filenames are not case-sensitive, but one standard
convention, although not required, is to have directory names in all upper-case
and filenames in lowercase.

Sorry to be so windy... just thought this might help.  Be sure you understand
Pete's msg.

Fm: Rob Hilligoss 74503,2303
To: BOB VAN DER POEL 76510,2203 (X)

BOB,

I got past the initial problem of being able to transfer files to the tape
drive /mt0 by makeing a few system calls. But, now I need to somehow be able to
see the file after I transferred it using <frestore>. I believe the way to do
it is to update the index file. I looked at the the files in the /h0/sys dir
(backup_date etc.) but I am still not sure what needs to be updated and how to
go about it using "C" where it will be transparent to the user. I tried
manually updating one of the log files but when <Frestore> read in the index
file it read in a different date than the file I changed.

I know the file is there I did a <tape -r> but i am not sure how frestore is
supposed to tell what segment I wrote it to.

I would appreciate any hints or help anyone could contribute to the cause!

Thanks again
Rob

To: Rob Hilligoss 74503,2303

I'm certainly not a tape drive expert...I just use one to backup my hard drive,
but I've never tried to restore it. However, as I understand it, fsave writes
all the files into a single tape block and you have to use frestore to extract
stuff from an fsave file since normal os9 utilities don't know about the format
fsave uses. Of course, using frestore on something not created by save will be
sure to fail. I don't believe the index portion of the file is ever updated.
fsave just stores the date in backup_dates and uses this on incremental
backups.

Does this help?

Actually, I ran into the same problem.  I checked TMODE, and noticed in the
wows I was having the problem in, the QUIT had been changed to 09 instead of
05.  I think I had aborted out of a program, so it didn't have the chance to
change the value back.  As soon as I changed it back to 05, it worked like a
charm in any window.  Also, do you know what the new offset is to turn
wildcards on?  I like to have them turned on all the time, so when I noticed
this one came defaulting to off, I checked the 2.1 archive to see what byte the
modpatch changed, went into shell with DED, and noticed the value wasn't
correct.  As well, have the 2 bytes been fixed for the 8K of memory that shell
used to grab for each process it called?

Thanks.

Curtis,

Some further comments on Shell+ 2.2a. First, the crashing problem disappeared
when I reinstalled it, so something must have glitched the first time. As for
the extra "." at the beginning of a command line following a BREAK, this does
not always happen. It appears to happen in windows opened with the TYPE
utility, but not with windows opened with shell i=/wx&. Doing a TMODE on the
two different windows doesn't show any difference, so I've no idea what the
difference could be. Also, if I open a subshell (by just typing SHELL) in a
window which does NOT have the problem, the subshell DOES have the problem.
This includes /term. Any ideas?

Ian

This is getting more confused.

I had another look at the sterm source. The code which saves stuff to a file
strips out extra LFs. Did a bit of fiddling and discovered that when I do a
AT&V to get my modem settings (a good test to duplicate the bug), the modem is
returning LF/CR pairs. So, that is why a write() to the terminal works.

Still doesn't explain why 'pro' doesn't work.

Decided to try it on my other system. 'Pro' aborts immediately with a 102 error
on the system with SSM. So, I have made a quick assumtion...'pro' does
something nasty to something in the system which prevents it from working
properly <g>. Sorry...but nothing else really makes sense. I know it appears to
be SCREEN, but with everything else working properly and no source to track
things down, I really don't know where to even start to look. If anyone can
point me to something...I'll look!

BTW, good old sterm works fine with SSM.

Hmmm, just decided to do a few more tests:

1. If I hook up a terminal to the mm/1 and run screen and 'pro' I get the same
bug.

2. However, if I turn my MVME machine (with SSM) into a terminal (what a low
thing to do <g>) and run screen on the MVME and then run COM to hook up to the
mm/1 and then run 'pro' on the mm/1 remotely, all works fine. Again, I suspect
that 'pro' is hitting something in screen/ptyman????

Thanks for taking the time to even look, Bob. I know it's almost impossible

And in speaking with Mark, it's obvious that he has no intention of pursuing
this product, so I'd say don't waste any more time on it. Sterm_1.5 works fine
for my purposes. I was concerned about PRO only because it might have uncovered
another problem with screen/ptyman. It could also very well be it's own
problem!  :-)

You may want to do more than that ... perhaps a phone call is in order before

all of his MM/1 stuff ... parts, boards, everything along with his MM/1 so he's

I'm sure he's kept your board separate, but ...

He also mentioned that proceeds from the sale would be used to refund the

I've tried a number of calls. No luck. I do have a "loaner" board...so it is
not the end of the world. But I just don't like to get ripped off, even if it
is only fifty bucks. Frankly, I'm surprised that Mark is acting this way...I
think he is basically honest, but, for some reason, has gotten really turned
off of the OS9 crowd (which is his right). I'm sure that it is just a matter
 of making my 50 a priority.

I have just uploaded a few handy utilities to help manage PostScript files.
With these utilities, you can shuffle pages, set up for book or booklet (both
sides) printing, resize documents etc.

I found them while wandering around Internet.

Compiled on my MM/1a - should run on other OSK boxes.

(Source included - GNU/FSF-type distribution)

If you use PostScript, you gotta have these.

If you don't use PostScript, don't bother -- they are no good for anything else
-- except maybe as examples of C programs that rewrite text files.

Look for "psutils" in a few days.

I have uploaded the newest source and binaries for SCREEN to lib 12. Give the
sysop a few days...then you'll be sure to the new one since I just left the
desc. etc. the same. Let me know if any more problems. Feel free to repost to
other places.

Does anyone have a copy of lha version 2.01? Someone just sent me the uucp
stuff on a disk and the readmes state that this is the only version which will
dearc them. They are right. I have version 2.06 and it scrambles them quite
nicely. I deleted the old version I had a long time ago since I figured that
2.06 would handle 2.01 files just fine <g>.

Thanks. Funny how we have to keep old versions around.

Help please;

Some time ago I picked up a 'junked' 68000 machine that HAD OS9/68000
installed.  I say 'HAD'  because when I was fooling around I, huh, learned how
to delete my CMDS directory/files, and I have never been able to awake the
beast since.

I live in NYC and wounder if anyone has a 3.5" single sided floppy boot disk
and maybe a utility to reclaim these files.  As far as I know I never wrote nor
copied anything to the disk at any time, and that they still should be viable.

I'm open to most suggestions; thanks.

 > Will OS9 in future run on PowerPC processors ?

 MW is working on a port of OS9000 for the PowerPC.  I don't have complete
 details of the hardware but I understand they have machines from IBM and
 VME boards from Motorola.  May have others as well.  They haven't announced
 any release date.
