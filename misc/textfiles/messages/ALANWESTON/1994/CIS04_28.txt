If you have a Graphics Library for a 680x0 that interfaces to standard VGA
(640x480 16 colors) I want to here from you !!!

Computer Design Services in Marietta, Ga, has some VGA drivers (Tseng Labs
ET3000 chip) that he uses for his CD68020 '020 mother- board. I  think the
libs. include the primitives like line, circle, box,etc,...) Call him at

I have reposted my Diskcat program to Libary 12 (OSK). This disk cataloguing
program originally only compiled on OSK. However, I have make a few changes to
the source and it now works on the Coco too. So, if you don't normally check
out Lib 12, do get this program. This is a shareware package. In case you
forgot, the program will maintain a catalogue of floppy disks on a hard
drive...this makes finding a program on a floppy much easier.

The file is stored as DSKCAT.LZH.

Someone just advised me that LHA is not available on the coco...so I have
uploaded my diskcat program into lib 10 as dskcat.ar. Sorry for any
inconvenience.

Actually, Bob, LHA is available for the CoCo, but not many people have it.

Hmmm, like so many other programs, it hasn't seemed to make its way here. I
wonder if OS9 folks are going to return to this place...after all, the rates
have dropped and the service improved. What else do they need to do? Mind
you...I'm not on the other services so I can't compare.

Bob,

Yes, a lot stuff doesn't seem to make it here like it used to. I've had it in
the back of my mind to pick up some of the more useful stuff, like LHA, which
is freely distributable (and has been uploaded to several services by someone
other than the author). But I don't want to look like I'm raiding the libraries
from other services, either. I was/am hoping that InfoXpress would bring the
cost down enough for folks to come back, so far a few have returned, but its
still fairly quiet here.

Sb: #Coco Hard Drive
Fm: Mike Fahy 74656,2340
To: All

I am attempting to get a hard drive running with a Coco3 and
have some problems & questions:

Equipment:

   Coco3, 512K Ram, Multipak with mods and irg's strapped for
   slots 1-3-4.  Tandy floppy controller in slot 4.  Disto RS232
   Pack in slot 1.  Seagate ST138N SCSI hard drive.

   The hard disk controller's origin and make is uncertain.  It
   is a plain white SCSI controller with no other ports or
   identification.  The seller to me had no documentation and
   simply identified it as a "DSI" controller and I thought he
   meant a Disto Hard drive interface (not 4 in 1).  The
   controller is "full size", and as I said, plain white.

Software:

   I am using Matt Thompson's freeware SCSISYS drivers with
   OS-9, Level 2 with the intention of reqistering it as soon as I
   can get it going.  The documentation is good enough if you have
   a working knowledge of OS-9 and know how to manipulate
   drivers, descriptors, and modules.

Progress to date:

   Nothing. The initial step of creating drivers was
   accomplished (the software has a clear and well written
   interface).  But when attempting to either verify or format the
   hard drive, no activity occurs, the drive light never even
   flickers, no error messages appear and the system requires a
   reboot.

Questions:

   1. Can anybody give me a clue, based on the above
   description, what the hard drive controller really is?

   2. Is the parity jumper on the hard drive left on or removed?

   3. Will Thompson's freeware version of the software work with
   a multipak?  Seems to me I read somewhere that it doesn't.

And finally:

   If I can't get anywhere with this setup, would someone please
   give me a source for a Coco SCSI interface with software and
   docs.  I see this stuff for sale now and then and perhaps this
   will inspire someone to part with one (a Disto 4 in 1 maybe?)
   that is no longer in use or is a spare.

Hi, Mike -

 > 1. Can anybody give me a clue, based on the above

My guess would be that it is a Disto HDI, or maybe HDII.  Only a guess.

 > 2. Is the parity jumper on the hard drive left on or removed?

The parity jumper must be removed (parity DISABLED).

No, the freeware version does NOT handle slot selection.  You will have to
order the registered version, which is now being distributed by Northern
Xposure (Colin McKay) for Matt.  The address is:
      7 Greenboro Crescent
      Ottawa, Ontario
      Canada
      K1T 1W6
      Phone 613-736-0329

You can also reach Colin via Internet mail ("cmckay@northx.isis.org").

An alternate source for a driver might be my "scsi47.ar" package in the
database.  You might find this useful for testing that you can get the system
working, but I have been recommending to folks to move to Matt's driver,
because he needs the money...  (And he's a friend, too.)

Seriously, though, Matt's drivers are the way to go.  (He has put a lot of work
into them, making them the most sophisticated CC3 OS-9 SCSI drivers, and
continues to provide support.)

Cheers... / Ken

Thanks, Ken . . that is exactly what I was looking for.

I am getting in touch with Northern Xposure for the Reg. Version.

I couldn't find your sasi47.ar.  Brow [74646,2237] Lib:All only produced one
file, in lib 10, a patch for the Disto Drivers, which of course I don't have.
NBD, I can wait for the Thompson material, but it would have been nice to try
it.  Put it up here if it's not too much trouble.  I'll take any excuse I can
get to avoid making a living on my Intel machines <g>.

Thanks again . .
