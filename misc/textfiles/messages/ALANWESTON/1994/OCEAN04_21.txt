Colin,
      I posted a prev. msg. to All that explained what I found.
Basically init the modem to ATQ1 (result codes off).  Now it works fine
with /t0, no gardian and now will try mtsmon.  Also need to find out how 
to trip DTR to hang up the modem. As it is now the caller has to hang
up.

OK...here's my dial.sys file (aside from my putting a space at the
beginning of each line, to try to avoid RiBBS reformatting it):
 
 Ocean Beach (14.4K);16192244878;DT*70,;38400;8N1;YES
 Delphi (2400);2886206;DT*70,;38400;8N1;YES
 Delphi (9600);2884626;DT*70,;38400;8N1;YES
 ACS Inc. BBS;14046362991;DT*70,;38400;8N1;YES
 
(There are another couple of lines, but this should give you the idea.)
I say they're all 38400 bps because the modem is set up to always
communicate with me at 38.4 no matter what the far end uses, and the
*70, is there to kill call waiting.  With this setup, ladial seems to
pause part way through dialing a number, and then the rest of the number 
is echoed followed immediately by "NO DIALTONE."

Curse the clock manufacturer twice a year, I guess!

I'd imagine that they could:

   1. Hunt for a new clock chip.
   2. Set up a CRON entry to run a program to fix the time by
      an hour twice a year.
   3. Manually reset the clock twice a year.

Okay, I'll look into it and see what I can do.
Thanks
