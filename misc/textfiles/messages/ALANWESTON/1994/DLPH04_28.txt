Anyhow, how would anybody know if someone spied on private messages without
getting permission from anyone. If the government has the wherewithall to
read encripted messages they will do it with or without permission. <Phil>

You come up with VERY valid points! I guess the main thing I'm concerned about
is that there is really not much reason for the average individual to be so
concerned with encryption. Businesses with large amounts of valuable dat to
protect are a different story. My point of view to this point has been from
the average computer user. You must admit that the "average user" cares
and knows little compared to the "average" OS-9 and now CoCo user. We tend to
be more technically oriented because OS-9 has pretty much made us that way,
but mostly because you need to know more to squeeze that extra bit of
usefullness from a CoCo..  to do almost anything with a CoCo nowadays! I
just bought a 128K CC3 and CM-8 from a guy for $75. All because RS said
they couldn't even get him a cassette cable a year ago! Those dealers know
nothing.... so we have to know more (pretty easy... huh?).

     Epson ESCP2

John,

I see you uploaded a TEX driver for Epson ESC P2 printers.  I recently
purchased an Epson Stylus 300 and am hoping to get some tex experience
under my belt.  In the docs for your program, you stated that
things were still a little rough.  Have you developed the
software any further?

Hugo,
  The DVI->ESCP2 driver was an early attempt to get a decent printout
of TEX documents on my Action Printer 5000.  It does pretty well with
plain text, approximating font styles and sizes with the printer's
built-in scalable fonts.  It gets real confused with some horizontal
and vertical lines (rules).  I didn't go any farther with the driver
after TIMKIENTZLE uploaded a more complete TEX/LATEX package with
a whole herd of DVI-printer drivers.  If the Stylus 300 will accept
older 24-pin Epson Graphics commands, you should find that Tim's
dvie24  driver in that package gives excellent results.  You can
also run DVI files through the `dvips' program (also uploaded by
TIMKIENTZLE), and then print them with Ghostscript's ESC/P2 driver.

John,

Thanks for replying.  I'll take a look at Tim's most recent
uploads.  I really don't want to get into Ghostscript stuff.  It
seems to add complexity to what should be a simple task.

You should contact Owl Computer and see about an upgrade to v.1.3, otherwise
any patches I write might (probably) won't work with your version.  The
upgrade wasn't significant, as I remeber, only a 1 page addendum to the
original manual, but it fixed some bugs and I think it changed the file
format.

There are a lot of patches and such to wade through, so much so that I came
out with an "upgrade" disk that many have referred to as "Level II version 2"
though it isn't that officially. What it is is a collection of the most
used/needed/recommended patches for Level II all on awo disk set that gas
(has!!) an auto-patch util with it. Answer a few questions and the patches
are installed! All you do then is edit the supplied bootlist to your liking
and run OS9Gen. You need 2 DS40T drives (at least1... the other can be 80T)
to run the autopatch feature, also 512K. The disk set is $7.50 + $2.50 S&H,
or you can get it from FARNA Systems at the fest in Chicago.

Can anyone give me some information on OS9000? I'm working with a
company who is undertaking a project that will require a real-time
multitasking system and they are seriously considering OS9000. I'm
especially looking for any information or help regarding device
drivers and embedded assembly language in c source code. Also, I am
assuming that programming the 386/486 in assembly language may be a
little different than DOS assembly language.

     Real Make...
     From: RHELLER      To: ALL

I am looking for a real live make for OSK.  Microware's make is somewhat
braindead (a real pain to use if one is use gcc/g++, etc.).  I just downloaded
and tried the "MAKE FOR OSK" make in the Programmers Den file area here, but
it too seems to have interesting problems -- it does not use "Makefile" by
default (instead, it leaves its "makefile" variable uninitialized (== NULL),
and I get a #102 (bus error) error).  And it does not know how to deal with
a full abs. path for a target.  Sigh.

Has anyone ported Gnu Make to OSK?

GNU Make is on chestnut, I think.  It is probably in the databases here,
and almost certainly on lucy.ifi.unibas.edu.   If you can't find it, let
me know, and I'll upload it.
